Max is a soon-to-be graduate in Games Design, who aspires to be a professional concept artist/illustrator in the near future. He began taking an interest in the field at the age of 18, back in 2009, believing that it would be a good way to channel a passion for art he has had his entire life. Last summer he did an internship as a concept artist at Rare Ltd (makers of Kinect Sports, Banjo Kazooie and other popular titles), which really opened his eyes to the scale and potential that this fledgling industry has. When he isn't drawing, Max enjoys gaming (naturally) and reading, which in turn provides inspiration for new paintings.
Max is currently living in the UK, and working on developing his skills/portfolio whilst searching for freelance and full-time work.

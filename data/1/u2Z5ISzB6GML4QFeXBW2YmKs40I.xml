    <p>Rudy Faber is a freelance illustrator, freelance concept artist and painter living in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands.<lb/>As a professional illustrator Rudy mainly works on children's books and young adult novels, a branch of illustration he enjoys tremendously. In the weekends Rudy loves to paint realistic portraits and the human figure. Although Rudy considers oil painting as a mere (albeit very passionate) hobby and isn't so much looking to pursue a professional fine artist career, a handful of his paintings have been on exhibit in places like Amsterdam, Melbourne (Aus) and Tucson AZ, as well as in his hometown of Leeuwarden. Rudy is mainly self taught in all of his techniques.</p>

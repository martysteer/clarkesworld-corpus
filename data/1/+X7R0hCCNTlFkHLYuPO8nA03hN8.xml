    <head rend="h1">Editor's Desk: The Return of the Reader's Poll</head>
    <p>It’s time to pick your favorite Clarkesworld story and cover art from 2017 in our reader’s poll. This year, we’re doing it a bit differently and running it more like a traditional two-round genre award.</p>
    <p>Phase 1 - Nominations (completed)</p>
    <p>At the end of January, we opened and held the twenty-four hour flash nomination period to identify the top five candidates in each category: story and art. The announcement was sent out via Twitter, Facebook, Patreon, and my blog. The brevity of this phase was an experiment. In theory, it would create a sense of urgency and reduce the opportunities for a coordinated ballot-stuffing campaign. It worked. The nomination phase generated more responses than the majority of our full surveys from years past and a significant reduction in stuffing—though there were some very clumsy attempts to do so, of course.</p>
    <p>In any case, after tallying the votes, I’m pleased to announce this year’s finalists.</p>

Editor's Desk: Finalists, Translations, and Awards
There’s a lot to cover this month so I’m going to dive right in. We held a two-day nomination period for the Clarkesworld Magazine Reader’s Poll in January. Similar to last year, the shortened nomination phase appears to have minimized the attempts at ballot-stuffing without any significant impact on the total number of participants. It was a tight race in both categories and the top five changed many times. In the end, there were enough ties that both ended with six finalists instead of the normal five.

In my October editorial, I talked about launching a Kickstarter campaign to fund the debut project from a new translation-focused publishing imprint—Clarkesworld Books. After a few months delay—for tax and accounting purposes—the campaign started in late January. Our goal is to fund the first English language collection by Chinese author Xia Jia, A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight and Other Stories. We’ve published many of her stories in Clarkesworld and I couldn’t be happier to have this be the first book for this imprint.
You can check out the campaign—with links to several of her stories—at Kickstarter:
Continuing on the theme of translation, I have some exciting news. Clarkesworld has received a grant to translate and publish nine [LANGUAGE REDACTED] science fiction stories this year! This is a project that has been in some form of discussion for a long time now, but all the pieces finally started coming together in the last few months. (I haven’t received the final copies of the paperwork yet, so I can’t say who gave us the grant or what language we’re translating from yet. Soon, I promise.)
Since the process we developed for our ongoing Chinese SF project has worked so well, I’m employing a similar model for this one. In January, I focused on adding people to the recommendation and translation teams we’ll need to make this work. Story recommendations are already coming in and one translation is currently in-progress. We’re hoping to have the first of these stories available for you in our April issue and continue monthly through the end of the year. After that, our initial funding will expire. It’s a while off, but that’s something we’ll be thinking about as the year progresses.
Dublin 2019 has opened the nomination period for this year’s Hugo Awards. Since there are still a few people who continue to nominate Clarkesworld for Best Semiprozine, I’d like to once again remind you that we haven’t been eligible for that award for a long time. Give your nomination to one of the many fine semiprozines out there instead. You can find a list at semiprozine.org. At present, there isn’t a category for professional magazines, but you can nominate me for Best Editor Short Form if you are so moved, and of course, all our original fiction is eligible in their respective categories.
The Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America has decided to honor me with a Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award. The award is “granted in recognition of the positive impact and influence the recipients and their work have had on the science fiction and fantasy genres.” Past winners include people like Kate Wilhelm, Tom Doherty, Michael Whelan, James Tiptree, Jr., Octavia Butler, Carl Sagan, Terry Pratchett, Sheila Williams, and Gardner Dozois. That’s an intimidating list to be added to. I’ll receive the award at the Nebula Awards Conference in Los Angeles this May. My thanks to SFWA for this great honor.
I suppose that’s enough for one month, so I’ll wrap things up here and thank you all for reading Clarkesworld and supporting this work we do.

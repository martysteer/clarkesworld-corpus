Duck Soup...The Revenge
I've been drawing all of my life, creating something out of nothing has always been
my passion. I have been doing Fashion Design for the last years, and came back into Illustration only recently. I have only a bit over a year's experience illustrating digitally, but the more I learn, the more I seem to fall in-love with it.
I guess childhood passions are the most persevering ones.

    <p>Rodrigo is a 22 year old Brazilian that has always had an interest in art. He's current attending a Graphic Design college and working as freelance illustrator. He says that his style is still in formation, but what appeals to him most is Hyper-realism and the way we can simulate anything we want, transforming imagination in reality.</p>

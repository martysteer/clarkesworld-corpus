2011 Reader's Survey
Every year, we give you the opportunity to pick your Clarkesworld favorites from the prior year. This time around, you'll have the opportunity to select your favorite story and cover art from 2011, as well as give us a little feedback. Feel free to use the comments on this post to help promote your favorites. (No attacking other people's choices.)
This survey will close on January 30th and the results will be published in our February issue.

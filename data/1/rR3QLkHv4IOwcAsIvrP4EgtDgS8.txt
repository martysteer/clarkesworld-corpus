2012 Reader's Survey
Now that 2012 is over, it's time for our annual reader's survey. In this year's survey, you'll have the opportunity to select your favorite stories and cover art from our 2012 issues, provide some us with some feedback, and optionally, tell us a bit about yourself. Feel free to use the comments on this post to help promote your favorites. (No attacking other people's choices.)
Participants that provide their email address will be placed in the running for one of three free copies of our next volume in our annual anthology series, Clarkesworld: Year Three. Contest is open to readers from all countries.
This survey will close on January 28th and the results will be published in our February issue.

    <p>I’d like to start this month by thanking everyone for their support and understanding during my surgery and recovery over the last month. The procedure went off without a hitch. I’ll admit that I was nervous about the whole lasers-being-fired-in-my-heart thing, but I had an amazing team of doctors and probably the most space-age operating room I’ve ever seen. Recovery has been slower than I expected, but the pain levels are finally down and almost all of the doctor-mandated restrictions on my activities have been removed. It will likely be a few more weeks before the bruising, swelling, and remaining restrictions—mostly on the use of my left arm—are gone. In the meantime, I’m taking it easy when I can and staying home. It means I’ll miss Boskone this year, but it’s for the best. I hope to see everyone there next year!</p>
    <p>In late January, we held the nomination phase for the annual Clarkesworld Magazine Reader’s Poll for best story and cover art. As in previous years, we went with a shortened (roughly one-day) nomination phase. We’ve found that this approach minimizes attempts at ballot-stuffing without any significant impact on the total number of participants. It was a close race from the start and once again it ended with ties. The story category was particularly close, with a six-way tie for fifth place. That’s more than we wanted, but the readers have spoken. If it doesn’t work out well, we’ll update the rules next year.</p>

    <p>Finalists for Best Cover Art</p>
    <p>Congratulations to all our finalists!</p>
    <p>Now it’s up to you to pick the winner in each category. Go to:</p>
    <p>Voting will close on February 20th at 8PM EST and the winners will be announced in our March issue.</p>
    <p>Speaking of awards, CoNZealand—the 78th World Science Fiction Convention—has opened the nomination period for this year’s Hugo Awards. Since there are still a few people who continue to nominate Clarkesworld for Best Semiprozine, I’d like to once again remind you that we haven’t been eligible for that award for a long time. Give your nomination to one of the many fine semiprozines out there instead. You can find a list at semiprozine.org. At present, there isn’t a category for professional magazines, but you can nominate me for Best Editor Short Form if you are so moved, and of course, all our original fiction is eligible in their respective categories. The list at neil-clarke.com/2019-clarkesworld-stories-and-cover-art can be helpful in determining what category each story is eligible in.</p>
    <p>That’s about all for this month. I wish you all the best!</p>

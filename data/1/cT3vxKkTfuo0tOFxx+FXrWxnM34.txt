2008 Reader's Poll Results
At the end of February, we closed things up on our 2008 Reader's Choice Poll and started evaluating the data. In comparison to last year, we had a significant number of stuffed ballots. Our standard policy in these situations is to delete all votes made by anyone who votes two or more times for the same item. We had to delete a lot of votes.
The final results are:
Best Short Story
- A Buyer's Guide to Maps of Antartica by Catherynne M. Valente (May 2008, Issue 20)
- The Completely Rechargeable Man by Karen Heuler (December 2008, Issue 27)

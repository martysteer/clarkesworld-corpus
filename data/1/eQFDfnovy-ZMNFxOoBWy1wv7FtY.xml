    <p>Adam Gillespie lives and works as a freelance illustrator in Portland, OR. He specializes in fantasy and sci-fi illustration and produces work for such companies as Wizards of the Coast, Sony Online Entertainment, Hasbro, Lucas Arts and more. He is assisted in his studio by a lazy black cat and a maniacal chinchilla, bent on world domination. Life is always interesting, to say the least.</p>

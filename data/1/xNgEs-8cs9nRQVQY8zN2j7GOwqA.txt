Waldemar is a Russian artist who spent many years working on book and packaging design. While he designed beer cans, he gradually became hooked on drawing on a graphics tablet. He loves to draw characters, very often incorporating irony, but never hate. The fantastic settings of his work often include retro aspects of past eras, the 60s and 70s being his favorites.

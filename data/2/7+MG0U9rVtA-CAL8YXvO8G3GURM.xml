    <head rend="h1">For the Colony</head>
    <p>My name is Ertaç Altınöz and I'm 29 years old. I graduated Izmir Anatolian Fine Arts High School and was very interested in illustration during those years. I went to college in Istanbul and received my Masters in Cinema and Television. I am still interested in cinema, 3D, short animated films and animation but I think finally I found my ideal profession by returning to illustrations. I'm currently working as a freelance artist.</p>

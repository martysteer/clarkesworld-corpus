    <p>Rodion Shaldo is an artist from Tomsk, Russia. He originally studied architecture, but at age 21, he decided to pursue his life-long love of painting. His main passion is bizarre robots discovering the post-human world and he always tries to find some distinctive pieces of human legacy to include in his work. His robots' design has been inspired by antique heritage and modern mechanics. He conveys both a knowledge of history and aesthetic feelings through his art. For him, those are the keys to happiness and our future.</p>

    <head rend="h1">Watcher of Merlin</head>
    <p>I've been a professional illustrator for the past 7 years working on everything from children's books to advertising for major companies and am now shooting for the coveted spot of concept artist in the entertainment industry.</p>
    <p>In 2003 I graduated from the Art Institute of Pittsburgh with a degree in traditional special effects for film and television. Since 2004 I've been employed as an Instructor at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco teaching model-making and digital rendering for Industrial Design, but have always had a fascination with the whimsical and sometimes downright insane world of monsters and creatures.</p>
    <p>I strive to attain creature designs that haven't been seen before and often participate in challenges to keep my skills honed, using paper and pencil, Photoshop and Corel Painter as my weapons of choice. I live in the Bay Area with my beautiful wife and daughter and get so much support from them when it comes to my creations, even relying on them to be my best critics.</p>

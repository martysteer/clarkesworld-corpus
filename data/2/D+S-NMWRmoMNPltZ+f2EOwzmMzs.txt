Born in Thailand 25 years ago.
Experience in drawing about 9 years.
Love Art, Music, Freedom, Manga.
My art was influenced a lot by Japanese animation and manga.
My favourite artist is Range Murata, Shirow Miwa, Ugetsu Hakua, Oh Great.
And then, I start to develop the style to be more realistic by self-study in art.
I was an Art director in local game studios for a year. During that time, I learned a lot from other artists. I also did a freelance job,too. Illustrator, novel cover and card game etc...
Right now Iâ€™m full-time employee for web/graphic design.
Still doing freelance job and my personal illustration project.

    <p>I have been a professional Graphic Designer for over 8 years, working on a number of different mediums, primarily web design and design for print, but has also included aspects from magazine design, bureau work, newspapers, animation, album artwork and application UI design.</p>
    <p>I also work heavily within accessibility guidelines set by the W3C and eGif frameworks for my corporate work and am available for consultancy on all the current standards.</p>
    <p>Most of my recent work is done in Photoshop with a Wacom Intuos2 tablet. Gaining a tablet has been the biggest jump forward in my career in a long time.</p>

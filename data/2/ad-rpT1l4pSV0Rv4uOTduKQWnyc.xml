    <p>Born in Thailand 25 years ago.<lb/>Experience in drawing about 9 years.<lb/>Love Art, Music, Freedom, Manga.</p>
    <p>My art was influenced a lot by Japanese animation and manga.<lb/>My favourite artist is Range Murata, Shirow Miwa, Ugetsu Hakua, Oh Great.<lb/>And then, I start to develop the style to be more realistic by self-study in art.</p>

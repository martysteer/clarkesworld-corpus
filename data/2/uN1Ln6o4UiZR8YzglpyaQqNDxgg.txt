2009 Reader's Poll
Every year, we give you the opportunity to pick your Clarkesworld favorites from the prior year. This time around, we are focusing on your favorite fiction and cover art from 2009 (listed below).
Everyone that participates will be in the running for one of five free copies of UNPLUGGED: THE WEB'S BEST SCI-FI & FANTASY: 2008 DOWNLOAD, a new trade paperback from Wyrm Publishing.

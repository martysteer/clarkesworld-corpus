    <p>I started working on CG in 2005; in 2006 I entered Webzen China as a background designer. In my spare time, I like to paint scientific and fantastic objects, such as aircrafts and aliens. I also like to building models, because I think it could help me understand the structures before I paint them. I love painting and I will keep working on it.</p>

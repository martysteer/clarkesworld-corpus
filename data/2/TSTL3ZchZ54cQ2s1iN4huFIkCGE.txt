I have been a professional Graphic Designer for over 8 years, working on a number of different mediums, primarily web design and design for print, but has also included aspects from magazine design, bureau work, newspapers, animation, album artwork and application UI design.
I also work heavily within accessibility guidelines set by the W3C and eGif frameworks for my corporate work and am available for consultancy on all the current standards.
Most of my recent work is done in Photoshop with a Wacom Intuos2 tablet. Gaining a tablet has been the biggest jump forward in my career in a long time.

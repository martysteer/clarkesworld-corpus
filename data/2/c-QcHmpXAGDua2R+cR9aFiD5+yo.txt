Editor's Desk: Giant Heads
So why are Sean and I holding those scary-looking silver heads? Last month, Sean, Kate and I won a World Fantasy Award for our work on Clarkesworld! (Sadly, Kate was unable to attend the ceremony.)
I’d like to thank our readers for their help in making it possible for us to publish this magazine. Without your subscriptions, donations, or other kinds of support, this wouldn’t be possible.
From all of us here at Clarkesworld, we hope you have a wonderful month, happy holidays (should you celebrate), and a fantastic end to your year. See you next month for our big issue #100 celebration!

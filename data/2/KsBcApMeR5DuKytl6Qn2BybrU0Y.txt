Editor's Desk: 2018 Reader's Poll
It’s almost time to pick your favorite Clarkesworld story and cover art from 2018 in our annual reader’s poll! Last year, we switched to a two-stage voting system—more like a traditional two-round genre award—and we intend to use the same model again this year.
Phase 1: Nominations (mid-January)
Later this month, we’ll open for a forty-eight hour flash nomination period to identify the top five candidates in each category: story and art. The announcement for this phase will be sent out via:
- Twitter (twitter.com/clarkesworld)
- Facebook (www.facebook.com/clarkesworld)
- Patreon (www.patreon.com/clarkesworld)
- My blog (neil-clarke.com)
The purpose of the brevity of this phase is to create a sense of urgency and reduce the opportunities for a coordinated ballot-stuffing campaign. Last year’s poll proved it to be effective at meeting these goals.
Phase 2: Final Voting (February)
The five finalists in each category will be announced in my February editorial. Final voting will open on the 1st and continue through the 15th. The winners will be announced in our March issue.

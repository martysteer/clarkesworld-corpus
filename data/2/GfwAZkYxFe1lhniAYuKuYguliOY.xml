    <p>Lake Hurwitz a professional illustrator and concept artist currently located in Seattle. His professional skill set draws from a passion for the expansive worlds within, coupled with love for video games and classical art. In the past he studied first at Ringling College of Art and Design, and then at The Safehouse Atelier with Carl Dobsky and the concept art studio Massive Black. They taught the understanding of form and light, as well as a healthy respect for a production pipeline. All these experiences have taught Lake the portrayal of form to a height of realism, and also a good understanding of graphic shape and thoughtful design. He is a fan of horror, fantasy, and science fiction alike.</p>

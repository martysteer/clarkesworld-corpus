Valente  “Mantis Wives” by Kij Johnson  The voting was close at the start, but in the end, “Immersion” by Aliette de Bodard won by a comfortable margin. Aliette also deserves congratulations on her BSFA Award nomination for this piece. Something tells me it won’t be the last time we’ll be mentioning “Immersion” and “award nomination” in the same sentence.  Clarkesworld Reader’s Survey – Best Cover Art of 2012  WINNER: “New World” by Ken Barthelmey 2nd Place: “Sci-Fi Farmer” by Jessada Sutthi 3rd Place: “Breaking Through” by Julie Dillon As the voting in this category progressed, several artists traded out the top spot, but towards the end, “New World” by Ken Barthelmey ran away with the top honor and never looked back.  Congratulations to all of our winners!  One of the things that often came up in the survey comments was a desire to see us publish more fiction in each issue. As you know, I’ve expressed a strong desire to be able to make Clarkesworld my full-time job. I believe that in order to make that goal a reality, it requires that we continue to expand our offerings as opportunities arise. Previously, we’ve tied expansion to subscription levels and I think it is time to do that again.  To that end, I’d like to announce the first of our 2013 milestone goals:   Increase the number of stories per issue to four, when we pick up five hundred new subscriptions.  Our goals for the year don’t end there, but I still have minor details to work out. Hopefully, I can tie up all the loose ends at Boskone later this month. Maybe I'll see some of you there.  I’d like to close with a bit of a public service announcement: If you can nominate for the Hugo Awards this year, you should know that the requirements for the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine have changed. While Clarkesworld is still eligible in this category (just as I’m still eligible in Best Editor Short Form), some familiar names seen on past ballots are not.  In an attempt to help with the transition from the old rules to the new ones, I’ve repurposed semiprozine.org as a place you can find information about the category and a growing list of magazines with their eligibility status. This unofficial resource is a good place to learn about some the many worthy contenders for this award. Check it out sometime and don’t forget to nominate!

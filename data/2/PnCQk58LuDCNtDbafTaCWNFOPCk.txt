Editor’s Desk: Reader’s Poll Results and Other Award News
Our 2013 Reader’s Poll closed last month and I’ve been patiently awaiting the opportunity to share the results with you. With no further ado, I present this year’s winners:
Cover Art
First Place:
“Silent Oracle” by Matt Dixon
Second Place:
“Rainforest God” by David Melvin
Third Place:
“Lost in Space” by Piotr Foksowicz
Note: Matt took first place this year by a healthy margin, but over the month, five different works held the number two spot at least once.
Fiction
- First Place: “The Urashima Effect” by E. Lily Yu
- Second Place: “Effigy Nights” by Yoon Ha Lee
- Third Place: “Silent Bridge, Pale Cascade” by Benjanun Sriduangkaew
- Fourth Place: “The Promise of Space” by James Patrick Kelly
- Fifth Place: “Cry of the Kharchal” by Vandana Singh
Note: The top five stories were a total of ten points apart, with the gap between first and second being the only place where there was more than a three point difference.

Hugo Award nominations are open until the end of this month. Unlike prior years, Clarkesworld is not eligible for the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine. I encourage you to check out semiprozine.org for a list of many eligible magazines you can nominate. Of course, our stories and editors are also eligible in the appropriate categories. (See: neil-clarke.com/2014-awards-eligibility-hugo-nebula/ for a handy by-category list.)
I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our subscribers and everyone else that has supported us financially last year. Becoming ineligible for the Semiprozine Hugo is a milestone for us. It means that with your help we’re moving towards our goal of becoming a full-time business. With that comes the time and resources to maintain and improve on what we can offer. We still have many milestones to go—for example, we’re still non-professional in the eyes of the World Fantasy Award—but your support provides the confidence we need to believe we can get there.
Thank you!

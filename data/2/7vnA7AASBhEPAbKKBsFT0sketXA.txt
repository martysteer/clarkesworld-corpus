Editor's Desk: Clearing Something Off My Desk
When we launched Clarkesworld, we had every intention of releasing an annual anthology that collected all of the original stories published that year. The first two, Realms 1 and Realms 2, were published on-schedule, but things crashed to a halt at volume three. Part of the problem was financial and the rest was me.
After my heart attack nearly two years ago, I refocused my efforts in making Clarkesworld a full-time career and mapped out how to get there. One of the items on that list was to catch up on our languishing print anthologies and issues, so I dedicated some of my sitting-on-the-couch recovery time to learning InDesign and book design.
By February of the next year, I had managed to publish several back issues in print and the first of many long-overdue anthologies, Clarkesworld: Year Three. By the end of the year, I was regularly producing print editions of each new issue, had completed working backwards to issue fifty, and published two more anthologies: Clarkesworld: Year Four and Clarkesworld: Year Five.
For the first part of this year, I’ve placed an emphasis on getting completely caught up with the anthologies. After that, I’ll go back and tackle issues one through forty-nine. Moving ever closer to that goal, I published our largest volume, Clarkesworld: Year Six, in late May. Like earlier volumes, Year Six features cover art from a prior issue of the magazine. This time it’s “Space Journey” by Martin Faragasso, which originally appeared on issue seventy-one. The stories are from issues sixty-one through seventy-two, which coincidentally is the year of my heart attack. It’s somewhat sobering to realize that everything from that point forward has been done on time I almost didn’t get. Anyhow, I’m quite proud of this volume.

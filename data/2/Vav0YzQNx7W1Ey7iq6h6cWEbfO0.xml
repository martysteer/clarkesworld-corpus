    <p>When we launched Clarkesworld, we had every intention of releasing an annual anthology that collected all of the original stories published that year. The first two, Realms 1 and Realms 2, were published on-schedule, but things crashed to a halt at volume three. Part of the problem was financial and the rest was me.</p>
    <p>After my heart attack nearly two years ago, I refocused my efforts in making Clarkesworld a full-time career and mapped out how to get there. One of the items on that list was to catch up on our languishing print anthologies and issues, so I dedicated some of my sitting-on-the-couch recovery time to learning InDesign and book design.</p>
    <p>By February of the next year, I had managed to publish several back issues in print and the first of many long-overdue anthologies, Clarkesworld: Year Three. By the end of the year, I was regularly producing print editions of each new issue, had completed working backwards to issue fifty, and published two more anthologies: Clarkesworld: Year Four and Clarkesworld: Year Five.</p>
    <p>For the first part of this year, I’ve placed an emphasis on getting completely caught up with the anthologies. After that, I’ll go back and tackle issues one through forty-nine. Moving ever closer to that goal, I published our largest volume, Clarkesworld: Year Six, in late May. Like earlier volumes, Year Six features cover art from a prior issue of the magazine. This time it’s “Space Journey” by Martin Faragasso, which originally appeared on issue seventy-one. The stories are from issues sixty-one through seventy-two, which coincidentally is the year of my heart attack. It’s somewhat sobering to realize that everything from that point forward has been done on time I almost didn’t get. Anyhow, I’m quite proud of this volume.</p>

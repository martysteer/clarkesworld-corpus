Frosty was a WHAT?!!
Anyway, in our house it will be Christmas with the Grinch, but there's so much more to chose from and every year we find something new and/or awful to add to the list. Whether it's an alternate history like It's A Wonderful Life or finding out that Frosty the Snowman was originally a cautionary tale about nuclear winter, we continue to be entertained by the Christmas sub-genre. How about you? What would you advise us to watch this holiday season? My Netflix queue is near empty. Help me fill it with end-of-the-year viewing material! Best suggestion received by the 15th gets a copy of Wyrm Publishing's signed limited edition of Shriek: An Afterword by Jeff VanderMeer. And speaking of endings and the prospect of new beginnings, this is the last issue to feature fiction picked by editor Nick Mamatas. Although Nick stepped down several months ago, he had a backlog of accepted stories that is only running out now. This means that we start the new year with fiction that I've been selecting. I'm looking forward to what you think about them. Happy holidays!

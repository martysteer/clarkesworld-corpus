    <p>Finalist: 2010 Chesley Award for Best Magazine Cover</p>
    <p>Kazuhiko works as an environmental graphic designer in Tokyo while producing 3D art works in my free time. When he was young, he was strongly influenced by surrealism paintings and cyberpunk art, and has produced watercolor paintings, drawing, sculpture, and so on. At present he enjoy creating 3D worlds, which he assembles like a puzzle by gathering archaic pieces from my memory. He currently lives in Kanagawa, Japan.</p>

A young woman pants in the field in front of the Old Supreme Court, doubled over, as though she has run a long way. She is covered in blood, and in her right hand glints a weapon.\nHer name is Jing-Li, and she is a cullmaster of buildings. Of embodiments of brick and stone, locations expressed in forms that humans can deal with, difficult to perceive and even worse to understand. But she does not need understanding to do her job.\nThe job is in two halves. Two old buildings\u2014pre-WWII colonial edicts, ancient by Singapore\u2019s standards\u2014are being repurposed for conservation, their insides ripped out and both buildings combined to become an art museum. The first to go: the City Hall, the senior building that was once the seat of Parliament, whose blood is now making its way down the woman\u2019s arms in rivulets. (It is not real blood, and it will fade as soon as the shock of the deed has worn away.) That leaves her with the old Supreme Court on the right.\nThe old Supreme Court building: Child of the Great Depression, completed in 1939, constructed on the grave of the Grand Hotel de l\u2019Europe, its predecessor in the sequence of colonial buildings that had stood there. Once it lorded over cricket players and rickshaw-pulling men with its massive dome and Ionian columns. It witnessed the Japanese troops marching in, and posed a dramatic backdrop to the first National Day Parade after Singapore\u2019s Independence. These days it sits empty, dwarfed by the skyline fleshed by glass and with bones of steel.\nIts time has come as well. That is why the cullmaster is here.\nJing-Li entered the old Supreme Court building by a side door, trying to ignore the wet on her hands. It was red, like real blood, and it triggered in her all the associations of fear and revulsion that mortal death entailed. She had not expected it: not the blood, not the soft thud of a body on masonry, not the shallow breaths drawing away to nothing.\nNone of her teachers had mentioned the hunt would feel like murdering a real person.\nThe City Hall had reminded Jing-Li of her grandfather, maybe that was why. Hair combed back, starched pressed shirt, glasses precisely set. Perhaps it was a figment of childhood, the archetype of the dutiful public servant instantly associated with a man who had died when she was ten and existed mostly through stories falling from her parents\u2019 lips. If he had looked like someone else, maybe she might have felt less uncomfortable swinging the blade.\nWho was she kidding?\nShe gripped her consecrated sword tightly, a cheap plastic thing bought at a sports store, usually sold to seniors taking recreational tai-chi. The air here tasted dusty. Jing-Li\u2019s footsteps echoed through a warren of corridors until she entered the main entrance chamber, where the ceiling yawned open far above her head and moonlight poured in from the windows on the second floor. She took a deep breath and thought she smelled London.\nLondon: the place where Jing-Li had gained her culling certification in her undergraduate years, taking a twisty bus route to a poorly-ventilated basement where she\u2019d sit taking notes with a handful of other groundskeepers, young and old. She had been the only non-European there.\nIn her course application she had written cheerfully about the transient nature of Singapore\u2019s geography, where buildings ten years old were considered aged. Surely a local, internationally-certified cullmaster would be invaluable.\nAfter all, this was Singapore, where lacking anything else the land itself became the currency in which the nation was defined. A living corpus carved and recarved, hollowed by tunnels and multibasement carparks, its borders fed with the leftover rock and silicate. It was a young land, supple and stretchy, where maps a year old were outdated, their lines dancing a seismographic tango. Guardians here lived and died in droves.\nExcept that this was Jing-Li\u2019s first hunt since she\u2019d returned home a year ago, law degree in hand. It turned out that guardians here went away as easily as their physical selves did, connections weak as water. Young locations lacked staying power, and older ones were strangely compliant in fading away. This job, then, existed only because it was unique.\nJing-Li looked at her hands: the blood of the City Hall building was gone.\nThe old Supreme Court was waiting upstairs, she knew. She tried to muffle her footsteps on the curved staircase as much as possible, as though she could sneak up on it by surprise, like a sleeping animal. It was quiet here, even by the standards of deserted buildings, something stately about the way the air rested amongst the shapes of the masonry. She was very, very cautious.\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, the moment her foot touched the stones of the second floor. He was waiting against one of the balustrades that overlooked the first floor, arms folded much as she remembered from their first meeting. She was a child then, waiting for her father, and she had tugged on her mother\u2019s sleeve to ask her about the \u201cfunny man in the hat.\u201d Later she would seek out pictures of white men in Victorian garb to point out to her mother. Her first building guardian. Her mother had thought her imaginary friends cute.\nThe Supreme Court of today would have fit in perfectly in posher parts of the Central Business District. \u201cYou updated your look,\u201d Jing-Li said.\nHis shrug seemed particularly dismissive. \u201cIn keeping with the times, you know.\u201d\n\u201cThe times have caught up to you. Do you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d\n\u201cYou must think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d He uncrossed his arms and stood straight. \u201cI felt the other guy go too, the sorry bugger.\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped,\u201d Jing-Li said. They were nearly toe-to-toe now. Was he ever this tall and thin and white? \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, you will be remembered.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s any consolation, she thought to herself, it\u2019s that after this I\u2019ll be done with the job. The sword felt heavy in her hands, as if it were actually made of metal. She raised it in the direction of the guardian, brought it downwards\u2014\nThe guardian vanished a split second before contact, and she found herself swinging through empty air.\n\u201cOh, kitten, it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d the Supreme Court said from behind her, and when she turned around he was sitting on the banister of the curved staircase with a Cheshire cat smile. Chest constricting, she lunged forward again, but like a clever insect he eluded her. When she regained her balance she found him back against his balustrade perch.\nShe took one step in his direction, and he froze her with a wag of his finger. \u201cAh-ah.\u201d She did not move, scared of spooking him, scared that he would vanish once again.\n\u201cLook,\u201d she said, as sincerely as she could through the heaviness in her chest, \u201cI don\u2019t like it either, but it has to be done. That\u2019s the rules.\u201d\nHe leaned vertical, hands slung easily in his pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to give up this position. After all, the other chap is gone. Somebody needs to man this station. I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\nThe guardian Jing-Li remembered was a stern one, back ram-rod straight, features imposing: a presence that filled the room and commanded absolute attention. Perhaps that was when he still functioned as the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cSorry, but that can\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the measurements and both existing guardians need to go. Another one will arise for the new art museum.\u201d Not to mention that his proposal would be incredibly unfair to the former City Hall, who had seemed a much better candidate for representing the art museum if they had to pick one.\n\u201cAh, but I put no stock in the calculations of your groundskeepers\u2019 council. They use their own metrics, which are useless. There\u2019s no correspondence with a global standard.\u201d\nThe global standards had been scrapped a decade ago, exactly because they mapped poorly across the globe. These days different towns, different regions, different countries used self-calibrated standards, whatever worked best for them.\nJing-Li felt like pointing this out, but she did not. Somehow, she knew it would be like shouting at walls. Perhaps it was.\n\u201cYou\u2019re out of luck,\u201d the City Hall said. \u201cI intend to stay.\u201d She looked at him, standing resolute in his place, solid as one of the columns that made up the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade, and could not argue. He had beautifully blue eyes, movie-star eyes, which crinkled at the edges before he disappeared. \u201cDon\u2019t think of summoning me,\u201d his disembodied voice said, by way of parting. \u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d\nJing-Li didn\u2019t try. It took her several minutes after she exited the building before she realized she was shaking.\nMonday, midday. The young woman, neat and dressed in what is generally accepted to be common office wear, trails a large group of people following a guide leading the way through the City Hall and former Supreme Court buildings. The group consists of civil servants who volunteered to help in the open house taking place in a month\u2019s time, and are dressed accordingly. Run by the staff of the museum that has taken over administration of the two buildings, the open house will, for the first and the last time, allow the public into spaces previously reserved for the highest offices in the country. License to gawk and to touch, before the diggers and bulldozers move in to do their reconstructive surgery. Some of the group take notes as the guide points out key features and historical nuggets: this will be crucial information in a few weeks\u2019 time when they too will become guides, this time to an adoring public eager to soak up the storied narratives contained within the buildings.\nThe young woman does not take notes. She merely follows, unnoticed.\nThe guide, with a knowing smile, leads the group away from the prescribed tour route, up to the roof where the iconic dome sits. The group loses flock coherence, running to various edges to take photographs, taking on the appearance of guppies in a tank. A large number of them gather at the front edge of the building, the only one not obscured by towering modern-day buildings. Eager hands point outwards, gesturing over the expanse of the Padang that lies, treeless and manicured, in front of former Supreme Court. It\u2019s the first time any of them have seen it from this angle, and, artificial as it is they find it a wonder.\nThe young woman stays quietly in the shade of the dome, waiting for them to leave so that she can be alone with the one man on the roof no one else can see.\nAcross the length of the roof from her, the former Supreme Court watches her silently, expression inscrutable to bystanders.\nThe last straggler of the group vanished downwards with a clatter, and Jing-Li finally let herself relax. The ability to stay invisible in the confines of a building was entirely dependent on the sufferance of its guardian, and she hadn\u2019t been sure the former Supreme Court would be so kind to its assigned executioner. She watched carefully as he strolled across the expanse of the roof, analyzing the way he took each step (with confidence), the way his hips swayed (hint of mischief).\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to finish the job,\u201d she said, hands held up. \u201cSee, I didn\u2019t bring the weapon.\u201d\nThe former Supreme Court laughed. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you would not have made it this far.\u201d As her hands went to her hips in protest, and he said: \u201cThis building still has working fire alarms.\u201d\n\u201cFire alarms can\u2019t keep me out forever.\u201d\n\u201cIf I have my way I won\u2019t have to keep you out.\u201d\nShe reached her envelope bag and pulled out a small sealed packet of brown paper, which she offered to him. \u201cCourtesy of the groundskeepers\u2019 association,\u201d she said. \u201cI ran into a senior on the way here and he thought it might be helpful in getting into your good books.\u201d Devon, according to his own account, had conveniently been on his way to buy something nearby and had just happened to bump into her in the two hundred meters between her workplace and the former Supreme Court building. Singapore was small, but not that small\u2014Jing-Li wasn\u2019t stupid. The association was getting impatient.\nThe former Supreme Court wrinkled his nose. \u201cBribery will get you nowhere.\u201d\nShe returned the packet to her bag. \u201cYou don\u2019t like sweets anyway. You\u2019d prefer a nice rat or some other small dead animal, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou know me well.\u201d He sounded pleased.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done my research.\u201d\nShe had done more than that. Like anyone with an ounce of self-respect she had gone home and dug into difficult guardian culls, carefully populating her browser with pages from countries bearing historic architecture, where the encrusted hearts of cities pulsed in medieval nerve centers laid over and over by infrastructural palimpsest. Places where guardians clung deeply and stubbornly to their location, fed by nostalgia and notions of heritage. She had come out of that tangle discouraged and confused: every story had different tips on how to get stubborn guardians to give up their guardianship, and most of them were quite location-specific. Her one takeaway was that she was on her own, and therefore in deep shit.\nUrgency itched under her skin, in her chest, like hungry parasites. Earlier this week the groundkeepers\u2019 association had sent an email: \u201cThis is not a game. If we knew you were going to mess around, we would have hired someone to actually do the job.\u201d She wondered if they understood that the last time in recorded history an unwilling guardian had been culled, hundreds of deaths had resulted from a building collapse.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d the former Supreme Court said suddenly, leaning over the roof ledge, eyes fixed on the green of the Padang stretched before them.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The Padang outranked the Supreme Court in age and they had no history of animosity that she could recall. A few years ago the Padang had gone underground, not long after the National Day parades had moved to the Marina Bay floating platform. It had not been seen since then. \u201cYou don\u2019t like what?\u201d\nShe followed his gaze. The Padang, hemmed in around all sides by temporary light fixtures, had a festive air about it. Banners hung by the streetlights explained why: the Formula One races dropped in on Singapore for their yearly call-by in two weeks\u2019 time, and the roads around the Padang became part of a racetrack in their honor.\n\u201cThe Marina Bay Street Circuit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t like him?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brat,\u201d the former Supreme Court said with finality, as though passing a sentence on the ephemeral entity that only existed for less than a week each year. \u201cGuardians shouldn\u2019t be allowed to come and go. It\u2019s unnatural.\u201d\nJing-Li followed him in leaning over the ledge, hands on her chin. \u201cYou mean places shouldn\u2019t be allowed to come and go. But it happens all the time.\u201d He turned to interrupt her and she cut him off. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about naturalness, none of this is natural. Your existence is entirely man-made, you know. You live on our sufferance.\u201d\n\u201cIf you wanted to get into my good books, you\u2019re doing a terrible job of it.\u201d\nJing-Li blew out a short breath through her nose. Despite the roar of passing cars, in some other part of the city close by, Singapore seemed quiet, too quiet. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest.\u201d\nArms folded, gazing out across the green of the silent Padang, the former Supreme Court said nothing. Jing-Li continued: \u201cIf you have such problems with transient guardians how are you going to cope with the construction site deity for the next two years?\u201d\nNow he did look at her. \u201cIs that your concession that you\u2019ve stopped trying to cull me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Jing-Li said. \u201cAccidents at worksites will happen if the construction deity is disturbed. You could get people killed.\u201d In case he didn\u2019t understand the ramifications of that, she added, \u201cHumans will die on your watch.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not obliged to keep humans alive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that, and I know that because you\u2019re not a rogue guardian. Just a really stubborn one.\u201d\nHis laugh was soft, burbling, like the sound of engines. \u201cI\u2019m perhaps the most fortunate, to have you chosen as my executioner.\u201d\n\u201cChosen,\u201d Jing-Li says under her breath, and he doesn\u2019t hear.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any of your other compatriots who\u2019s known me since childhood. Daughter of a judge . . . \u201d He looked at her, almost fondly, and Jing-Li stepped back a little from him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a lawyer now, working just a few buildings down the road.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, sure.\u201d\nHe tossed something at her and she barely caught it. When she opened her palm she was confronted with something small and copper and intricately carved. \u201cA coin?\u201d\n\u201cNot just any coin. That\u2019s a Straits Settlement coin.\u201d\nShe turned it over and over in her fingers. It felt odd, strangely solid. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d\n\u201cThere is a time capsule buried under the flagstone of the main court. Nothing much to it, just a few coins and the day\u2019s papers. But they\u2019ll open it in the year 3000. I suppose they won\u2019t miss one little coin.\u201d\n\u201cThe year 3000,\u201d Jing-Li said. It sounded like the title of a sci-fi movie, something Arthur C. Clarke might have written.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be there when they do that.\u201d\n\u201cIn the year 3000.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nine hundred years in the future.\u201d She held the coin out to him. \u201cYou have a lot of faith, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cKeep the coin,\u201d he said, still looking outwards. \u201cConsider it a gift.\u201d\nAnd then he was gone.\nSunday, mid-morning. The air thrums with life and the city is busy, consumed in festival-madness. Roads are closed and speakers pop as sound technicians take them through their paces. A hundred thousand people bustle, working themselves up to the frenzy that will take place when the sun sets. In their pens, at the hub of it all, the race cars that will be the stars of the night\u2019s festivities sleep fitfully. Anticipation feels like a breathable, drinkable thing.\nWithin the madness-in-waiting sits a young woman in a big metal swing set on top of the hill that used to be a fort. Cross-legged quietude surrounds her and the plastic sword resting by her side. Eyes shut, she leans into the movement of the swing, back and forth, back and forth.\nTwo weeks have passed since she met the former Supreme Court on the roof of the building, and the groundbreaking ceremony is less than a month away. She is no closer to solving her problem. Despite her appearance of immobility her fingers twitch over the coin she holds loosely in her right hand, in her lap.\nShe whispers to herself, whether consciously or unconsciously, it\u2019s hard to tell. It is also hard to hear what she is saying, but it sounds like a prayer.\nAnd then a guardian, whom she thought was dead, appears on the swing beside her.\nJing-Li sprang into alertness at the unexpected presence beside her, even if the swing continued its back-and-forth unperturbed. Her heart tapped a funny rhythm as she realized who it was. \u201cBut you\u2019re supposed to be gone.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am gone,\u201d said the guardian who used to be the City Hall building. \u201cI\u2019m not connected to my old place anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to disappear,\u201d Jing-Li said, as if her first sentence hadn\u2019t been clear. \u201cOnce a guardian has been disconnected from their location they lose the energy from the place that fed them.\u201d\nThe former City Hall building laughed and shrugged, somehow avuncular when he did so. \u201cThat\u2019s what they told you in school, right? But I guess it\u2019s not true. I spend my days here now, here and there. Talking to my friends.\u201d He gestured in the direction of a spreading banyan tree nearby, its hanging roots like sturdy beams.\nJing-Li could not see who he was gesturing to, and she guessed it was a tree spirit, because she had problems seeing them. \u201cBut the blood,\u201d she said, still refusing to believe this was happening. \u201cThe falling over, the vanishing, what was all of that? Were you trying to make me feel bad? What?\u201d\nHe crossed his legs and leaned back in the chair. He looked like her grandfather, but in demeanor he reminded her of her primary school Chinese language teacher. \u201cI always thought that groundskeepers should appreciate the responsibilities they hold.\u201d\nJing-Li let her hands drop into her lap. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t? Like I don\u2019t understand the consequences of my actions? You think I\u2019m doing this just for fun?\u201d\nThe former City Hall building said nothing, attention caught by something on the metal grating that formed the floor of the swing. He leaned over and picked it up: it was the coin she had been holding. \u201cWow, haven\u2019t seen this in a long time.\u201d He flipped it back and forth. \u201cDid he give it to you?\u201d\nWhen she nodded, he handed it to her. \u201cTypical of him,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEmotional manipulation?\u201d She flipped the coin back and forth in her fingers. \u201cLike falling over in an explosion of blood wasn\u2019t?\u201d Her hand closed around the coin, hard enough to press into the skin. \u201cYours was the first cull I\u2019d ever done and I was so scared I couldn\u2019t do the next one. And I still can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAre you scared?\u201d He looked at her. \u201cOr is it something else?\u201d\nJing-Li put her feet down and the movement stopped the swing\u2019s momentum. Crickets sang in the greenery as she thought over the question carefully. Finally, she said: \u201cNo, probably not. I won\u2019t let fear get in the way. It\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t want to go, and I don\u2019t know how to convince him to. Because . . . \u201d She gestured in no particular direction. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing. I can\u2019t blame him for not wanting to go through with it.\u201d\n\u201cHorrible?\u201d The former City Hall huffed. \u201cWe are not humans, you know. It\u2019s not about life or death, it\u2019s about moving on, about becoming different. It\u2019s natural.\u201d He tapped her on the shoulder, in a teacherly way. \u201cYou remember your classes, when they taught you about culling? What did they say?\u201d\n\u201cA lot of mumbo-jumbo, most of it was not relevant to Singapore, anyway. Most of it was how to give pep talks about heritage and changing perceptions and how things never really go away. What kind of heritage does Singapore have? Even our national symbols are invented.\u201d\nThe former City Hall just smiled.\nSilence settled, uncomfortably, and Jing-Li remembered she had been carrying around the small sacrifice packet from the groundskeepers\u2019 association ever since the former Supreme Court refused it. She found it at the bottom of her bag, slightly squashed and with a worn corner, but still sealed. \u201cThis talk is getting us nowhere, so you might as well have some of this.\u201d\n\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d he said, accepting it and breaking the packet\u2019s little paper seal. \u201cI won\u2019t be getting these much anymore, I suppose.\u201d He dug in with his fingers and pulled out one of those soft, pink-and-white candies coated in powder that Jing-Li had no name for. \u201cThis is very good,\u201d he said, and then held the packet out, across to the swing\u2019s other bench. \u201cYou should try one.\u201d\nJing-Li blinked. Seated across them, where there had been no one a moment ago, was a young Malay man in formal wear. A guardian, she realized, but one she did not recognize. \u201cI live here,\u201d he said simply, probably in response to her facial expression.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not Fort Canning,\u201d Jing-Li said. The Fort Canning was a moody-looking teenager whom she often found perched on the old display cannons scattered around the park, smoking. He had been in place for slightly more than thirty years, she was told.\n\u201cI\u2019m the old dude,\u201d he said, reaching into the bag that the former City Hall was holding out. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a long time. I used to be called Bukit Larangan. The Forbidden Hill, you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the original hill,\u201d she said, in slow wonder. \u201cFrom the 14th century.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit longer than that.\u201d He tasted the sweet, gingerly. \u201cThis is good. I don\u2019t get many of them these days.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still around,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all these years.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he said. We stay around long after we\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\u201cSee, history remembers us, in a certain way,\u201d said the former City Hall.\n\u201cAnd do you remember history?\u201d She leaned forward, her heart pounding, consumed by a sudden eagerness that she hadn\u2019t felt since she was a very young schoolchild. She turned to the former Bukit Larangan. \u201cDo you remember the 14th century?\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d He leaned back in the swing seat. \u201cI cannot say. I remember what it was like, but I don\u2019t really remember it. It was so long ago.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cBut you were there. Weren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe leaned backwards into the chair, completely calm. \u201cYes. But memory is quite difficult.\u201d He pointed to a sign, one of many that were scattered around the park, packed with information written in four languages. \u201cSee that? That\u2019s all anybody remembers. Some days I think of the old kings who used to live here, and I realize that I cannot remember their faces, or I only remember a very vague picture of them. Then I wonder if the Tumasik I remember is the same as it was back then.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve told me stories,\u201d said the former City Hall. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure there was so much more.\u201d\n\u201cOf course there was much more,\u201d the former Bukit Larangan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all gone now. Singapore\u2019s history started in 1819, that\u2019s what the history books say, right?\u201d He gestured at the signs. \u201cThat\u2019s all that\u2019s left. That\u2019s who I became.\u201d\nJing-Li shook her head. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow much of Singapore\u2019s history before the 19th century do you know?\u201d The former City Hall asked.\n\u201cA sleepy fishing village,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s what they teach us at school.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was a lot more than that,\u201d said the former Bukit Larangan said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t remember what it was anymore.\u201d\nShe looked down at the sword in her lap and felt like she was falling outwards. The Straits Settlement coin resting in her hand had taken on immense weight and heat, like it was a burning coal.\n\u201cBut you were there,\u201d she repeated emptily to herself.\nSunday night. Halogen lights of unthinkable wattage sear the air, burning a bright orthogonal circuit into the cityscape, thousands of meters long. Thousands cram into rows of seats, specially erected for the weekend, while thousands more press against wire nettings at odd ends and corners of the circuit, as race cars streak past at 400kmh, blurs of screaming metal tracked by faithless, tireless cameras. The Padang, forcibly crowned with a strobe-lit stage, suffocates under the weight of a sweaty, screaming crowd, while above the city, people in air-conditioned restaurants and bars peer down at the blips of cars blazing, ant-like, around the track.\nThe young woman runs in the alley behind the former Supreme Court, sealed off to prevent people from getting close to the racetrack. The Marina Bay Street Circuit has given her grace to wander the grounds, even the areas deemed off-limits, but she has more pressing matters on her mind. Her target is the former Supreme Court.\nFor her, for the both of them, it has to end tonight.\nJing-Li ran up the grand steps of the former Supreme Court, her footsteps sending solid echoes reverberating. She knew where the guardian was, up on the roof where they\u2019d last met. She was sweaty, and her heart raced from shoving through the clamoring, oblivious crowd, but none of that mattered.\nThe moment she burst out through the stairwell the guardian turned towards her from his spot at the edge of the roof, haloed by the stadium-strength lights surrounding the Padang. \u201cI see you\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think of going anywhere,\u201d she said, pulling the plastic sword from its plastic sheath, her voice and breathing harsh. Down on the road the F1 racers screeched and made popping noises as they slowed down for the corner turn, lending the scene the surreal soundtrack of an air raid.\n\u201cI would not dream of it,\u201d he said, his voice carrying over the melee. \u201cIn fact, I was rather hoping to stay here for the long term.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jing-Li shouted, over the din. \u201cYou can\u2019t. I\u2019ve decided. That\u2019s not how this country works. You served a purpose, that purpose is done, it\u2019s time to move on. Your neighbor has done it. You\u2019re no different.\u201d\nHe looked a lot smaller than she seemed to recall, like a lost doll somebody left by the roadside. \u201cBut I am different. I thought you might think of me fondly, given your childhood. There\u2019s such strong nostalgia . . . \u201d\n\u201cNostalgia? Whose nostalgia? You can\u2019t tell me what to be nostalgic about.\u201d The thing that had been sitting uncomfortably in her chest since the first night she had taken up her sword came to a boil. \u201cThis building is being preserved. That\u2019s a lot more than other past locations in Singapore have had.\u201d\nHe ran his fingers over the worn stone surface of the roof\u2019s edge. \u201cThis place has such memories . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou have to believe me, I\u2019m doing this for you.\u201d She took bold steps towards him, and he didn\u2019t move away. \u201cYour memories will be rewritten, whether you like it or not. Our Government may like what you are. They like what you represented as the Supreme Court. They like the way you look on the television screens when Grand Prix is beamed to the world.\u201d\nShe waved her sword accusingly at the racetrack. \u201cBut that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be, from now on. A pretty picture. A tourist attraction. They could have built something else to house the art museum. But they wanted to use your skin, because your skin is what they think is important.\u201d She swung the sword back towards him. \u201cCan you live with that? Can you live with becoming somebody else?\u201d\nHe seemed to straighten up. \u201cI used to be the Supreme Court,\u201d he said, a glint of his former hardness returning to his expression. \u201cImportant decisions were made on my watch. What I did used to influence the entire nation.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no one will change that for you,\u201d she said. She thought of Bukit Larangan, its history faintly etched, fading into a few neat lines of the country\u2019s official narrative. \u201cYou are so lucky and you don\u2019t even know it.\u201d\n\u201cWill you remember me, at least?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come over for tea,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a swing set on top of Fort Canning that seats four. We can hang out with your former neighbor. And the old Forbidden Hill. We could talk about history, or anything you like. I\u2019ll even bring a lizard for you, if you want.\u201d\nHe smiled. She could barely see his blue eyes in the mad, harshly shadowed lighting. \u201cI\u2019m still right. I am still fortunate to have you as my executioner.\u201d\n\u201cYou had a good run,\u201d Jing-Li said.\n\u201cWell. I won\u2019t deny that.\u201d\nShe did not blink as she brought the plastic blade down.\nSunday night. It has been a year since the groundbreaking ceremony, and the races are on again. The former Supreme Court stands, its form cloaked in netted black scaffolding on which its fa\u00e7ade is projected. Its interior is a mess, gutted masonry like phoenix ash, but the millions around the globe watching the race live do not need to see that.\nAcross the track sits a grandstand, its rows packed with the chattering masses. They have paid well to be here, even if only for a brief time. Amongst their number one might pick out the shape of a young woman, her back straight, an unreadable smile on her face. From this distance you cannot tell, but she is turning and turning a small object in her hand, which appears to be a coin of some sort.\nBut she is only one face in the crowd, and as the camera pulls away she becomes invisible, part of the story no one sees.\nThe black box of the former Supreme Court, drenched in new light, remains impassive. Around it rise skyscrapers\u2014shades of New York, shades of Abu Dhabi\u2014that vanish into the night, the hands of a new city reaching ahead.\nOriginally published in We See a Different Frontier, edited by Fabio Fernandes and Djibril al-Ayad, 2013.\nJY Neon Yang (they/them) is queer, non-binary, and the author of the Tensorate series of novellas from Tor.Com Publishing (The Black Tides of Heaven, The Red Threads of Fortune, The Descent of Monsters, and The Ascent to Godhood).

He is a young boy, brown and slight, with long crooked snatching fingers and thin greasy hair. All day, he plucks bits of straw from his mattress and digs them into the dirt floor or the flaking mortar between wall-stones. Sometimes he chews on them.\n At night, he screams.\n We are going mad, slowly, all of us. The monsters have taken everything, everything but themselves.\n When Uri was dead, they brought me his things in a scarred leather bag that smelled of blood and burnt flesh and, unbearably, of him. There were his clothes, the torturer\u2019s thin bloody handprints on the sleeves and collar; and the miniature of me that he had worn in a silk bag around his neck. The final item was a stained, half-finished sketch of a monster, its long neck decked with tassels and jewels like a King\u2019s, its single horn barbed like a spear, its sharp teeth jaggedly overlapping its jaw. Worst of all were the eyes, like black holes bored in a sheet of iron, ragged-lidded and dim.\n Two words were written on the back. Pride\u2014though whether it meant that pride had killed Uri, or that it would kill me, or simply that pride is a monster, I do not know\u2014and Soon. They need not have written that last. I knew they were coming.\n Before Hunger came, I shared a cell with Grief.\n Her child was dead. She called his name at night, weeping into her ragged white hair. I could not comfort her. She flinched from my hands, from my voice, from my offers to comb her hair or share my half of the gritty gray bread the guards brought us.\n I whispered to her sometimes, telling of Uri, but she did not listen\u2014or else she did not hear. I learned long ago that Grief is a monster without ears.\n I wake at dawn. That word is almost meaningless here, but I have kept it, as I have kept the words sunlight and rain to describe the weak colors and sweet smells that sometimes reach us through the bars. Dawn is when the guards walk down the block of cells, looking to see if any of us have died during the night. That is the way they discovered Grief, frozen in her sleep.\n No one is dead today. We are not that lucky.\n She is with the guards today. I hear the click-click of her boot heels, like claws clipping against the hard earth. Her waistcoat and sleeves are clean now, pale blue and purest white, but by nightfall she will be covered in blood.\n Of all the King\u2019s monsters, she is the only one I fear.\n \u201cThe King came to Abaddon on our wedding day,\u201d I told Grief.\n This is how I remember it; Uri and I standing beneath the canopy on the riverbank, the gentle rumble of his voice as we read our vows and scatter tulip petals to the current. Suddenly, the creak and snap of metal joints. An iron monster\u2019s shadow falling on our faces. The break in Uri\u2019s voice as the King flies overhead.\n In the middle of our wedding vows, Uri paused. He was a man who put his hate before his love.\n \u201cIt is not well to speak ill of the dead,\u201d I said, \u201cso I will say only that I wish he had chosen differently. I wish he had not paused.\u201d\n Grief turned her face to the wall and shivered.\n She stops in front of my cell.\n \u201cWhat is your name, prisoner?\u201d Her voice is very harsh; it comes from breathing in smoke all day. They say she was a blacksmith before the King came, that she is the one who built his iron monsters. I am not sure of that, but I know she is a monster in flesh.\n \u201cMy name is Miriam,\u201d I say.\n \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n \u201cUri of Jordan was my husband. The King wants me where he can watch me.\u201d With all his other monsters, I think but do not say. She wouldn\u2019t understand, which would be bad; or she would, which would be worse.\n \u201cUri,\u201d she repeats. \u201cThe famous rebel.\u201d\n Let that be all, I pray, but she does not move. I am kneeling on the floor, my eyes level with her waist. I see the steady swell of her chest with each breath and feel my own heart hammering like horses\u2019 hooves.\n \u201cTell me what he was like,\u201d she says.\n \u201cYou know what he was like,\u201d I whisper. \u201cYou killed him.\u201d\n She says nothing for a long time. Her body tenses, her chest heaves as if with pain. For a wild moment, I think she will kill me too.\n Then she turns and walks to the next cell.\n Uri told me once that the iron monsters have names. I asked the name of the King\u2019s and he said a strange, brittle word, a word that means power and authority and soundness in the language of the King\u2019s people. That is the monster Uri set out to kill.\n Pride was Uri\u2019s monster, as Grief was the white-haired woman\u2019s and Hunger belongs to the boy across the block. Pride killed Uri. Pride made me a widow.\n Pride is my monster, too. Its other name is Vengeance.\n There is a new boy in the cell next to me. The man who was there before went out with her and did not come back. That man\u2019s monster was Fear. The new boy is Anger.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll teach those bastards,\u201d he says. And when he comes back from questioning: \u201cWe\u2019ll kill them with their own weapons.\u201d He is questioned a lot. I wonder how long it will be before someone who loves him is given his things in a scarred leather bag.\n One day, when the questioning has been especially brutal, he falls against the bars that separate our cells and mumbles through swollen lips, \u201cWe\u2019ll kill them. With the weapons they\u2019ve given us, we\u2019ll kill them.\u201d\n I look at him and laugh harshly. \u201cWhat weapons have they given us? They\u2019ve taken everything.\u201d\n \u201cEverything but themselves,\u201d he says.\n She comes for him the next day. Then his cell is empty.\n When they arrested me, they would not let me keep Uri\u2019s things. They went through the house, collecting his clothes for the fire, and when they could not find his portrait of me they took me into the cellar and beat me until I told them where it was. But they did not ask for the scrap of paper with its half-finished sketch of a monster.\n The day after she comes for the boy, I see a scrap of paper sticking out of his mattress straw. If I stretch, I can just close my fingers around the corner. I glance down the block, making sure the guards are not coming, and take the paper into my cell.\n It is a picture of another monster, this one complete. Its neck is short and powerful, its eyes narrow, its jaw tight in a hideous grimace. Rough, graceless rivets hold its thick teeth in place.\n There is a faint bloodstain along the bottom; the boy had this picture while he was being tortured. I think of the marks on the sketch they brought me with Uri\u2019s things.\n The boy\u2019s family will never have this picture. Thinking of them, I fold it and tuck it into the silk bag at my throat.\n \u201cWhat do you think of me?\u201d she asks.\n She has come alone, her clothes already red from the day\u2019s work. I look at her face to avoid seeing the stains. It does no good; her eyes are the color of dried blood.\n \u201cI think you are a monster,\u201d I say.\n \u201cDid it occur to you that monsters might be kept on a leash? That they have to eat what they are fed?\u201d Her skin is too dark to show a blush, but the way she turns her head away makes me think she regrets the question. Her throat tightens as she swallows. \u201cMiriam,\u201d she says, nearly whispering, \u201chold on to what the King gave you.\u201d\n \u201cHe gave me nothing,\u201d I say. \u201cNothing but pain, and grief, and hunger, and fear.\u201d\n \u201cHe gave you vengeance,\u201d she says.\n She looks a long time at the silk bag, and before she goes, she slips a bit of paper between the bars.\n It is a picture of Uri\u2019s monster.\n Hunger did not scream last night, and this morning he sits quietly on his mattress. He reaches for the straw sometimes, not as though he is going to play with it, but as though it is hiding something.\n The guards are agitated. They chatter in their brittle language, the sound like metal on metal. She is nowhere to be seen.\n Perhaps I am mad, but I think I heard her voice last night. It sounded like she was singing.\n There is something I did not tell Grief; Uri sang, the night he was captured.\n Old King Folly sat on a wall, Old King Folly had a great fall,and all the King\u2019s monsters and all the King\u2019s mencould not put the King back together again.\n \u201cChildren\u2019s rhymes,\u201d I said, kissing his forehead. \u201cHush, love. They\u2019d kill you for less than that.\u201d\n He laughed, drawing me down into his lap. \u201cThey\u2019d have to find me first.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re so certain you can beat them.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ve given me my greatest weapon.\u201d\n I wrapped my arms around him, pressing his face against my chest. His lips lay against the skin that rose and fell with my heartbeat. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust them, love,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThem?\u201d\n \u201cWhoever\u2019s telling you these things\u2014your greatest weapon, the names of the King\u2019s monsters, these foolish children\u2019s rhymes. The King\u2019s monsters, Uri. You have to remember whose they are.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll steal the King\u2019s monsters away from him,\u201d he said.\n I shook my head. \u201cWho wants to own a monster?\u201d\n In the end, he was wrong. We do not need to steal our monsters. Sometimes, they are handed to us in a scarred leather bag.\n The men who brought me my food take Hunger on their way out.\n This is the first time she has not come for the prisoner herself. I strain my ears; sometimes when I do this, I can hear them screaming. This time, I hear nothing.\n My appetite is gone; the bread tastes like ash in my mouth. I think suddenly that I am about to die. This feeling has been with me every day since my arrest, but now it is overpowering.\n Every breath becomes precious to me. The moldering straw, the fetor of the dungeons seem suddenly as sweet as perfume.\n I do not want to die.\n The guards come to my cell next.\n When he was dead, I went out into the riverside garden he had loved so well and ripped up the tulips, scattering their petals in a mockery of the wedding ceremony. I chopped down the cherry trees and burned them in a fire hot as a blacksmith\u2019s forge. I stood over the flames, choking on the ash and wishing I could die.\n \u201cHere is your monster,\u201d I said, and threw the sketch onto the fire. \u201cI was wrong. It is yours, after all, and what\u2019s yours can die with you.\u201d\n The picture burned, and even though I wished to, I did not.\n This is where he died, I think as she locks the door behind the departing guards. I want to say it out loud, because I cannot make myself believe it any other way. This room is too dark, too dry, like a cell made of old bones. There is no smell of blood here, only rust and dry sweat.\n \u201cYou asked me what he was like,\u201d I say. She turns to me, her eyes blunt and penetrating like awls. \u201cIt should be enough for me to say that if you hadn\u2019t killed him, this place would have.\u201d\n \u201cThis place did.\u201d She rests her hand on her hip, hooking the iron keys around her thumb. \u201cHe brought himself here, Miriam, and I did what I had to do. The time was wrong. He was to lay low, wait for me to tell him\u2014well, you\u2019ll understand soon enough.\u201d\n She walks to a part of the floor that is smoother than the rest and kneels. I follow slowly. \u201cThe time was wrong\u2014for what?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take his place. Pride was his, built for him, but she will serve you just as well.\u201d Creaking, the paving stones beneath her begin to skin. She catches my wrist roughly and pulls me onto the platform. \u201cThis is it, Miriam\u2014Uri\u2019s rebellion. For the first time in months, the King is without his monster. We must catch him while he is weak.\u201d\n \u201cWe? What\u2019s happing?\u201d\n And then the floor opens away above us, and I see.\n The room is full of monsters. Short and corded, tall and sleek, glittering iron claws and fangs, rippling silver scales. I could name them at a glance: long-toothed Hunger, crooked dark-eyed Grief, Anger with his graceless jaw and powerful neck. The King\u2019s monster crouches at the end of the hall, a mighty emperor among his subjects.\n She takes me by the hand and leads me up to Pride.\n I brush my fingers along the monster\u2019s graceful tasseled neck, and the dull iron against my skin feels as hot and vibrant as the torturer\u2019s hand\u2014the blacksmith\u2019s hand, the hand that shaped all the King\u2019s monsters. Pride is beautiful. Her deep eyes flicker as I look into them; her breath on my cheek is cool and sweet.\n The blacksmith hands me her reins. \u201cMount up,\u201d she says. \u201cThe others will join us soon. But I wanted you to be the first\u2014you\u2019ve lost so much you didn\u2019t choose to give.\u201d\n I have no voice. Pride nudges her iron head against mine, cruel and gentle at once; this pain is hers, too. She belonged to Uri, and Uri to her, more than I ever did.\n The blacksmith turns her back, and leaves Pride and I to become each other\u2019s.\n We take to the skies, all the King\u2019s monsters, with drawn swords and cruelly-tipped darts, with steel fangs and claws gleaming. Our queen and mother rides at the head, cutting through the air on the King\u2019s own monster like a ray of light.\n The King has taken much from us, but he will learn to fear the things he\u2019s given, the things he\u2019s made of us.\n We are all the King\u2019s monsters, and we fly."}

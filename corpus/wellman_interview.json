Instead, he plumbed the depths of American folk culture for the brightest metal and darkest coal.\n\u201cI think he deserves more attention [because of] both the incredible quality of his voice and his contributions to the genre\u2019s foundations,\u201d said James L. Sutter, who is both a novelist and the Managing Editor at Paizo Publishing. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize where modern fantasy comes from, and Wellman certainly had an impact on the field, even if (as I suspect) the average reader today has no idea who he is.\u201d\nFrom his Appalachian-inspired fantasies of John the Balladeer to the sword and sorcery of Hok the Mighty and even the Wild West cavalry soldiers of the forgotten outpost of the soon-to-be reprinted Fort Sun Dance, Wellman remains readable and relevant to contemporary audiences. His characters stand tall and face the challenges presented to them; they do not cower or whine, as David Drake points out below.\n\u201cWellman\u2019s folk tales of Silver John strike a universal chord that transcends category,\u201d said award-winning science fiction writer Mike Resnick, who wrote the introduction to the recent Paizo release of Who Fears the Devil?.\nFurthermore, Wellman\u2019s work has that simultaneously familiar and strange, fresh and old, common and original quality of folktales and songs. It seems to be pulled from out collective past and shaped into something new and startling like traditional mountain music improvised on the spot.\n\u201cThere is not a great deal of fantastic literature which draws mythic resonances from the American past,\u201d said editor and writer Darrell Schweitzer. \u201cI think of some of Washington Irving and Stephen Vincent Benet and even some of Lovecraft, and then I am left grasping. The picture we have of a typical Wellman story is probably from Who Fears the Devil?, a sympathetic and intelligent treatment of a part of our country\u2019s past which most writers inevitably reduce to caricature.\u201d\nBelow, eight fans of Manly Wade Wellman\u2019s work\u2014David Drake; John R. Fultz, fantasy novelist; Kenneth Hite, writer and game-designer; Samuel Montgomery-Blinn, editor and founder of the Manly Wade Wellman Award for Science Fiction and Fantasy; Mike Resnick; Darrell Schweitzer; James L. Sutter; and David Niall Wilson, novelist and founding CEO of Crossroads Press\u2014talk about why Wellman\u2019s fiction endures, what they admire about it, and how it has influenced them.\nWhat do you admire about Wellman\u2019s writing? And how has his writing influenced your own?\nDavid Drake: I am continually delighted with Manly\u2019s quiet, folksy characters. I don\u2019t mean, \u201cThey speak in dialect,\u201d though in some cases they do; but generally his viewpoint is that of an intelligent, opinionated close observer. He doesn\u2019t attempt to be neutral, but he\u2014the observer\u2014will remain polite so long as the other party is polite. Manly\u2019s world is one in which courtesy is the default option\u2014and would that the real world were more that way.\nAs for influence on me . . . well, not really. I was always a storyteller, not a stylist, myself. Watching\u2014reading\u2014Manly confirmed my predilection but didn\u2019t create it. Remember that Karl Wagner and I were Manly\u2019s friends and peers when we met, not students. Manly was incomparably more senior than we were, but we\u2019d actually been selling fantasy more recently than Manly had. He got back into the field after we became friends.\nThe one exception to the \u201cno influence\u201d statement is Old Nathan. Those stories were started as conscious homage to Manly immediately after his death. Old Nathan isn\u2019t my version of John the Balladeer (Silver John if you must), but I was deliberately mining the same folk vein from which Manly had drawn his John stories.\nJohn R. Fultz: Manly Wade Wellman\u2019s work combines the deep flavor of Appalachian folklore with horror and fantasy in a completely unique way. Being a native of Kentucky\u2014born and raised in the Bluegrass State, I became a California transplant in \u201898\u2014these stories have a special resonance for me. As a young fantasy fan and writer in Kentucky, it was strange to discover a fantasy writer who embraced his local culture and setting instead of replacing it with entirely fictional ones. I mean Robert E. Howard lived in Texas all his life, but most of his fantasies are set in fantastic worlds like The Hyborian Age and the Pre-Cataclysmic Age.\nIn Wellman\u2019s work, the sorcery, the magic, and even the horror, live and exist in the Mountains. His stories combine the best oral folktale traditions with the sensibilities of classic Weird Tales fiction. He found inspiration in actual Appalachian folklore, those enduring tales of haunted hollows, witches, devils, and nature magic.\nHis stories have a uniquely southern flair, in the best possible way, and they remain timeless pieces of weird fantasy/horror. John the Balladeer, or Silver John, as he\u2019s also called, is such an amazingly cool idea: A wandering minstrel with a silver-stringed guitar who travels the mountains battling ancient evils, dispelling curses, and generally ridding the world of supernatural wickedness. He\u2019s like Andy Griffith meets Gandalf.\nAnother great thing about these stories is the guitar itself, and the music John plays. I am also a guitar player, and the instrument plays a central role in a lot of \u201cmountain culture\u201d\u2014as does music in general. I love how John\u2019s magic is tied up with his music, and sometimes that silver-stringed guitar can become a holy weapon in his hands. Devils beware!\nAs for how Wellman has influenced my own writing? Well, he makes me want to incorporate my own culture into my fantasy writing, something I\u2019ve been playing with recently. Most specifically, I wrote a story called \u201cThe Gnomes of Carrick County,\u201d which follows a family of Irish immigrants coming into the Kentucky territory in about the year 1779, with a cameo by Daniel Boone himself. I really enjoyed this blending of actual history with fantasy, and I will come back to this in my work again.\nKenneth Hite: I think I most admire his devotion to taking the harder, but ultimately better, route into setting. He had to know the whole country before he showed it to us, and he knew just what to show us after he found it. Where Robert E. Howard, for example, delighted in making what we already knew seem fresh, Wellman provided chills, drilled deep wells of fantasy, from myths and folklore that we didn\u2019t already know. It\u2019s that combination of the wonderfully new and the age-old that all true fantasy aims for, and Wellman hit the gusher in West Virginia, not in Cimmeria or Mordor.\nI don\u2019t write a lot of fiction, but Wellman\u2019s ability to find the strangeness and potential in American mythology has been a constant inspiration and lodestar in my nonfiction. \u201cSuppressed Transmission\u201d is essentially an attempt to prospect for productive wells across the worlds of folklore and fakelore alike. And by contrast, what Wellman could do with very familiar spirits indeed\u2014with ghosts and Druids and Leonardo da Vinci\u2014shows that nothing is over-used, it\u2019s just not been used correctly.\nSamuel Montgomery-Blinn: Wellman had a marvelous ability to inhabit varied, colorful, vivid characters and (or perhaps exemplified) to write with dialect without stumbling into an unreadable, stumbling mess. A very close second is his limitless stamina in producing so much work in so many genres for such a long time. He\u2019s nonetheless influenced me in how I read short fiction and in kindling an interest in reading in varied genres and in developing a folklorist\u2019s nose and appreciation for North Carolina writing.\nMike Resnick: I admire the feel of authenticity. I know these are original stories, not folk tales from the 19th Century, but they have an authentic feel about them, which means that a) Wellman was an artist, and b) he did his homework.\nBy graduating from the pulps to the kind of stories we remember him for, he showed that one could improve, and that you needn\u2019t be a bottom-dweller forever. I began my career with Burroughs and Howard pastiches; Manly showed me, by example, that I could write my own stuff and make a living from it.\nDarrell Schweitzer: I can\u2019t say he has deeply influenced my own work. I do admire the way his first person narrators (like John) have an authentic narrative voice, and therefore present the fantastic as if it is part of life that is actually lived. It doesn\u2019t feel made-up.\nJames L. Sutter: It\u2019s his voice and sense of place. As soon as I read the first few sentences of \u201cJohn\u2019s My Name,\u201d I was hooked. After reading through all the Silver John short stories, I felt not just like I\u2019d been entertained, but that I\u2019d learned something as well. Reading those stories gives you a feel for a very particular time and place in American history, both through the writing and through the uniquely southern mythology and superstitions he presents. How you boil down a people and a place to that sort of snapshot is beyond me, but I think it all starts in the voice\u2014he\u2019s not afraid to ride the fine line between authenticity and alienating the reader, and so far I\u2019ve yet to see him fall. But I definitely come away from his work wanting to write in voices other than my own.\nDavid Niall Wilson: I love the way he could bring the mountains of North Carolina to life. He peopled them with the ordinary, and the extraordinary\u2014characters of great wisdom and power, dark, evil hearts, and brilliant patches of honesty and honor. He wrote modern fairy tales, and helped to keep the legends and folklore of our country intact.\nWhich genre(s) do you think Wellman did the best, and why?\nDavid Drake: A couple of Manly\u2019s mainstream novels of the \u201950s\u2014in particular Candle of the Wicked\u2014are to my mind his best writing. That said, his early John the Balladeer stories are wonderful and unique; a strain of particularly American fantasy writing which has never been equaled.\nHis Young Adult novels are very good of their type, but they don\u2019t attempt to rise above it.\nHis SF is handicapped by the fact that he didn\u2019t understand science; his storytelling ability will often carry the reader nonetheless.\nHis earlier fantasies, many of them published in Weird Tales in the \u201930s and \u201940s, are very solid performers in the field but rarely rise much above it. Again, because he was such a good storyteller, these fantasies are regularly reprinted.\nHis non-fiction is well researched but here\u2014to a degree I don\u2019t see in his fiction\u2014his adoration for Thomas Wolfe comes to the fore in a pretentious, inflated, fashion. I myself have difficulty piercing the style to get to the content.\nJohn R. Fultz: I\u2019m not as widely-read in Wellman as some. I\u2019m mainly a Silver John fan. So that\u2019s my favorite because these tales really \u201csing\u201d for me (pun intended). Silver John is such a rarity in literature: A southerner who is not confined to some insulting archetype, who is not a font of ignorance and backward attitudes, but who carries a vast store of occult knowledge. A hero for the mountain folk, and a true American icon of weird fantasy.\nJust the idea of a traveling, guitar-playing wizard who knows the secrets of the ancient land is enough to get me interested. And when you read the actual tales, you feel the presence of a master storyteller at work.\nKenneth Hite: I haven\u2019t remotely read enough Wellman to know the answer to that. He wrote a prodigious amount of history I haven\u2019t read, for one thing. But I do know that his fantastic horror is some of the finest anyone has ever produced, while his science fiction is mostly just pretty good. But even then, his Thirtieth Century yarns can easily compare with Piper or Blish or even lesser Jack Vance.\nWhy is his fantastic horror so good? I think, again, it\u2019s because of his mastery of setting. In their own ways, Lovecraft and King have demonstrated that horror that truly gets inside you has to start in a place, a place that\u2019s as real as possible. Poe can transcend that requirement; so can Ligotti. But most horrorists aren\u2019t Poe or Ligotti.\nSamuel Montgomery-Blinn: If I can cheat, I\u2019ll pick: short fiction. His historical, non-fiction, crime, mystery, science fiction, and fantasy novels and comic scripts do indeed spread out backwards and into the cosmos(es), but he was also able to tell a great many great stories in a handful of pages and that\u2019s a rare thing.\nMike Resnick: I confess to only reading his fantasy and science fiction, but when I did the intro to the recent reprint of Who Fears the Devil? I learned, while researching him, that he was nominated for a Pulitzer for his history, so I\u2019d have to think he probably did that as well as his Silver John stories.\nDarrell Schweitzer: And I have not read all of them. He wrote a lot of historical fiction, and historical fiction for younger readers (a series about the Civil War, from the Southern viewpoint) which have not survived, not because they are not as good, but because, particularly in the US, most readers aren\u2019t much interested in history. Fantasy survives better. That is where the market for Wellman fiction is.\nThe one piece of his science fiction which has had considerable longevity is Twice in Time, although I have recommended this book to people and gotten back the response, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Wellman ever wrote science fiction.\u201d Yes, he did, but mostly for a short period. He allegedly had a falling out with John W. Campbell over that one. Campbell wanted to meddle, Manly said no, and he sold it to Startling Stories instead, where it appeared in the March 1940 issue.\nI cannot imagine, though, that Campbell could have published Twice in Time at this time, though, because it is too similar to de Camp\u2019s Lest Darkness Fall (Unknown December, 1939). The difference is that in the Wellman version, the man from our present becomes a famous person in our own past, while in de Camp\u2019s he does not, and branches off into an alternate history. But both books have many of the same virtues.\nSo the honest answer is that I cannot really say in which genre Manly wrote best. I have never read his mystery fiction, for instance. Did you know he once beat out William Faulkner in a story contest in Ellery Queen\u2019s Mystery Magazine? All I can tell you is that the fantasy has survived better, and that may be as much a result of the market and of American culture is it is a reflection of the excellence of Manly\u2019s fantasy vs. his work in other genres.\nJames L. Sutter: My experience is primarily with his Silver John material, which I\u2019d classify as somewhere between fantasy and Americana, and I feel like the latter aspect must give it an edge (it\u2019s like a whole class in Appalachian folklore!). But I look forward to reading further, and potentially being proven wrong!\nDavid Niall Wilson: His magical fantasies are my personal favorites. I know he wrote a lot of science fiction, but it never hit me the way his folklore-based fantasy did. I also love his young adult novels. Though formulaic, he has way of telling a story that engages the minds of young readers, even though the settings and characters are from our past.\nIn whom do you see yourself, Silver John, Hok the Mighty, or another of Wellman\u2019s characters?\nDavid Drake: Good God Almighty! I don\u2019t see myself in any of Manly\u2019s characters. Manly and I have organized our lives\u2014certainly our working lives\u2014in remarkably similar ways, but we are/were different men.\nThough . . . Manly\u2019s heroes always faced problems instead of whining or running, just as Manly himself did. I try to be that sort of man myself.\nJohn R. Fultz: Oh, definitely Silver John. I\u2019ve made magic on my guitar for decades, but I wish I could cast the kinds of spells that ring out from John\u2019s silver strings.\nKenneth Hite: On my very best days, I\u2019m a knockoff of John Thunstone. Occultist, layabout, bon vivant, and always up for stabbing a werewolf. But Wellman\u2019s characters by and large seem almost prodigiously good-hearted and self-possessed; even Thunstone seems like he\u2019s just pretending to be a playboy. Like Batman.\nSamuel Montgomery-Blinn: In the end it\u2019s John the Balladeer. I\u2019m an Indiana farmer\u2019s son, and looking around my office I see a guitar, scattered singer-songwriter sheet music, and a great many books. If only I had any of the talent or magic or half the brains and courage and heart . . .\nMike Resnick: I see myself doing what Manly did\u2014telling the tales of more interesting characters than myself. Probably not the answer you\u2019re looking for, but it\u2019s an honest one.\nDarrell Schweitzer: I suppose all artistic types may fancy a little of themselves in John the Balladeer\u2014not \u201cSilver John\u201d\u2014but to be honest, no, I do not identify with any of Manly\u2019s characters.\nJames L. Sutter: As a musician myself, it\u2019s hard not to love Silver John. Even though fantasy RPGs have had the \u201cbard\u201d class for a long time, it\u2019s still rare to see someone take the magical musician idea and really make it work. John\u2019s a shaman with a guitar, exorcising spirits with his silver strings. What more can you ask for?\nDavid Niall Wilson: I\u2019ve won awards for poetry, and I\u2019ve played guitar for over thirty years. I love the idea of Silver John\u2014his integrity, his courage. I am not Silver John, of course, but he is the man I would be if had that magic . . . Music is like that, and I\u2019ve written a lot about musicians myself\u2014and about North Carolina, for that matter. So I will say that Silver John is the character I identify with . . .\nWhy has Manly Wade Wellman\u2019s fiction endured?\nJohn R. Fultz: I suppose there are two reasons. One, because of Wellman\u2019s superb imagination, his sheer storytelling skill, and the iconic nature of his creations. Two, because writers and editors over the decades have made sure that people don\u2019t forget Manly Wade Wellman. Various editions of his Silver John stories have been assembled, most recently the Planet Stories collection of Who Fears the Devil?\nMy own treasured, time-worn copy of Wellman tales is called John the Balladeer and it was published by Baen back in 1988. I\u2019m so glad Planet has repackaged these stories for a modern audience\u2014and they\u2019ve given it a terrific new cover painting. The one I have features a Steve Hickman painting of John playing guitar by the fireside while a bat-winged succubus looks over his shoulder. My \u201888 edition also has a nice foreword by the great David Drake. David is certainly one of the reasons the Wellman stories have not been forgotten.\nKenneth Hite: Plain and simply\u2014because it\u2019s vastly better than that of his peers. His stories are gripping without being overly melodramatic; his settings are lively without overwhelming the tale; his characters are heroic and human. And his prose, the rhythm and the words of it, simply work. Even his most formulaic stories manage to pose some interesting problem, or present an arresting event, on their way to the conclusion. All that keeps Wellman\u2019s work alive and interesting where Nictzyn Dyalhis or even Seabury Quinn are mere historical curiosities.\nSamuel Montgomery-Blinn: Wellman wrote well and sharply, widely and prolifically, in short fiction and at length, and did so at a time (and for a long time) when his work could pick up from those who had come before (particularly Edgar Rice Burroughs) and form a core part of the emerging canon of the emerging genres.\nAlso, with his stomping grounds in North Carolina and its surrounds being such fertile ground for writers and readers, he was able to directly influence a generation of writers in those genres and lengths; those students, fans, and friends would go on to write directly (e.g. Dave Drake\u2019s Old Nathan, Mike Mignola\u2019s The Crooked Man) and indirectly (Warren Rochelle, Andy Duncan, C.S. Fuqua) influenced fiction, and so on, and here we are still talking about Wellman and his stories and will likely be for many years to come.\nAt some point, a writer\u2019s body of work becomes a self-fulfilling force for its own endurance\u2014I know more about Wellman\u2019s work through the shadows it casts than from direct contact with the source material.\nDarrell Schweitzer: It\u2019s not enough to say \u201cbecause it was good,\u201d since any number of good writers have fallen into oblivion. That he was associated with Weird Tales in its great age is not the answer either, because more and more readers of his work have never laid eyes on a copy of WT from the \u201930s. The answer has to be that it retains his charm, and that it still fills a need. I think the great strength of his work (other than its technical excellence) is that it is distinctly American, his John the Balladeer and John Thunstone stuff at least.\nIncidentally, it is always \u201cJohn the Balladeer\u201d and never \u201cSilver John.\u201d This latter appellation was invented by the publisher, and Manly did not approve of it. Also, one never uses the term \u201chillbilly.\u201d Manly explained to me that if you go up in the hills and use that term, the hearer may feel \u201cit is his bound duty to remove your neck from your body.\u201d Unsurprisingly, then, he did not much care for the film The Legend of Hillbilly John and congratulated me on not having seen it.\nThe best of Wellman\u2019s fiction of this sort is literate, elegant, and authentic where very little else by other writers is. I tell you this as a former editor of Weird Tales, who has seen plenty of fake hillbilly stuff in the slushpile, always from people who do not live in, and I suspect have never even visited, the Southern Appalachian area.\nJames L. Sutter: Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think [Wellman\u2019s fiction] has endured in the public eye\u2014or rather, nowhere near as well as it deserves. I know that before I started working on Planet Stories, I had never heard of him before, which is a bit mind-boggling considering how many awards he\u2019s won and how many popular authors cite him as an influence.\nDavid Niall Wilson: It has endured with fans of his work because it is sincere and simple, at once magical and very believable. Silver John, as an example, is the man we all wish we could be, the hero, but not in a Superman sense\u2014in a real sense. Manly wrote a lot of different things in a lot of different genres. His young adult novels are amazingly accessible, and his work in comics has lingered\u2014though not so many are aware of it.\nFor instance, I wonder how many know that\u2014when asked to recreate Superman for a rival comic book company, he created Captain Marvel\u2014and when he wrote the first script, he managed to use the letters of his name as the first letters in the words in a way he could come back to it in court, if asked, and prove that he created it. He was an amazingly talented man.\nJeremy L. C. Jones is a freelance writer, editor, and teacher.

Or at least the mech smells like the pilot\u2019s mouth tastes every time it bites down and the copper floods in, so that\u2019s close enough. It\u2019ll have to do. The pilot likes it better in here than out there anyway, because outside the pilot has a troublesome body that bleeds when cut and won\u2019t listen to what it wants, but in here the pilot has no body and no shape, only Phoenix-shape, and Phoenix is shaped like a knife, or a missile, or a swift punch, something meant to rend and destroy. Phoenix bends the shape of the universe to its will. Some say the mech looks like an angel, with the fan of thrusters haloed around its shining fist of a head, but in Phoenix the pilot feels like a bird of prey. All beak and talon, pursuing apostates that flee before its shadow like frightened rabbits.\nToday the rabbits are C-class single-unit fighters, glazed in the gold and green of apostates, streaking from a battlefield spangled with wreckage and ionized fuel. Weak-boned things: eggshell hulls and wispy shields, spitting angry needles of blue light until the pilot crushes them in the palms of its hands. They dodge and weave frantically, hoping their agility will let them escape, but it\u2019s no use. C-classers were never meant to face mechs. Puny surface fighters designed to take out ground turrets and windows in government offices are no match for the fifty-foot juggernauts that are mecha units. Snap, snap, pop. Each one makes a satisfying crunch as the pilot destroys them.\nPhoenix pulses with breath while the pilot works, and it soaks up the beat of the mech\u2019s heart as it does its job. No, \u201csoaks up\u201d is the wrong descriptive. \u201cInhales\u201d is better. The pilot inhales the mech\u2019s heartbeat. Her heartbeat. While it sits in Phoenix\u2019s glowing head, spine jacked into neural net, she is in the chest, her body floating in a sea of amniotic fluid, and when her heart beats the mech around her shivers and drums with power. That\u2019s her, whom the pilot belongs to. That\u2019s her, Phoenix\u2019s holy sigil. A God-given boon, without which the mecha fighter is inert stone and plasma. A blessing. A wonder. A beloved miracle. The pilot kills another enemy and there goes the responding twitch in its senses, a reminder that she is there and feels everything that it feels. Was the twitch an expression of delight? Perhaps. It hopes so.\nThe C-classers are down to a handful. The apostates must be in bad shape, sending them as the last line of defense. How pitiful. Beneath the field of slaughter lies the candied atmosphere of Amar-7, pinks and blues hiding a surface ulcerated by an apostate base. Halfway to the center of apostate territory, these installations have grown increasingly tedious to dispose of. Sameish. Deficient. Unchallenging. Battles fall into an easy routine, and the pilot tires of routine. Beside it the other three mechs\u2014Garuda, Strix, and Roc\u2014are cleaning up the stragglers. No more shall come from the surface, except perhaps unarmored civilian shuttles. The denizens of the surface in a last-ditch exodus, hoping their sheer number will let some get past the line of hostiles. But it won\u2019t. The pilot has been there before, seen the results. Whatever ships the four mechs miss, the mothership will take out. There is no escape for them.\nA shadow passes over them: giant wings circling overhead, just out of orbital range. The R\u00e4svelg waits to see what the apostates will do. Will they flee like roaches? Or wait to die in their dens like dogs? Minutes tick by and no movement in the swirls of troposphere. So they have chosen the path of cowardice, preferring to give in to death rather than to fight. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s their choice. The mothership pings the mech battalion with new orders. It\u2019s time to finish the job.\nThe pilot receives the R\u00e4svelg\u2019s command with pure euphoria. It sweeps Phoenix forward with the other mechs, drilling red-hot through Amar-7\u2019s atmosphere. It already knows what they will find on the other side of this vapor wall: crunchy domes of plexiglass and soft warrens of clay, crumbling at first touch. One shot of energy will carbonize them; nothing fired in return will scratch the adamantine mechs. The battle might last fifteen minutes, give or take a few. Those on the surface will know exactly what hit them, and then they will know nothing at all.\nLittle joy exists in razing that which offers so little challenge, but a victory is a victory. Every moment spent in Phoenix is a chance to be something else. A chance to live and act with precision and direction. A chance to be in a body that fits. Only here does the pilot feel like an embodiment of the promise it was meant to be: perfection made flesh. A flawless tool for her purposes, flensed of selfishness and self-loathing. This is the closest thing to euphoria that the pilot knows. As it punches through the final layer of troposphere and descends upon the apostate base, guns blazing, it feels her power in its guts, as if her body is its body, and emotion rushes through it so strong that it could weep.\nCONFIG B\nA clip of free time lies between the end of battle and the official debrief. In this transition, the mech pilots and holy sigils make a loose semicircle in the docking bay, sitting and standing half out of flight suits, reconnecting with gut and nerve, with fingers and toes. Slowly easing back into humanity. Eight souls in total, one pilot and one sigil per mech. Eight extraordinary beings, selected and made to perform extraordinary tasks\u2014\n- Helianthus (he): Strix\u2019s sigil, flame-haired and recalcitrant;\n- Rosa (she): Strix\u2019s pilot, sweetly smiling but hollow inside;\n- Grimoire (they): Roc\u2019s sigil, who would not spit on you if you were on fire;\n- Gauntlet (he): Roc\u2019s pilot, who would fight literally anybody and anything;\n- Sparrow (they): Garuda\u2019s sigil, large eyes always on the verge of tears;\n- Kestrel (she): Garuda\u2019s pilot, who almost never speaks her mind, but when she does it is with insight so honed it flays meat to the bone. Like the time she said \u201cIt\u2019s not love for her that drives you. You\u2019re lying to yourself, that\u2019s why you\u2019re miserable.\u201d\nThat particular canard was addressed to you. Phoenix\u2019s pilot. The other members of the battalion call you Stick (and sometimes Sticker), a nod to your stoop and your awkward angles. When Kestrel said \u201cher\u201d she meant her, the last member of the mech battalion. She. Phoenix\u2019s holy sigil. Versus is the name they gave her, but in the white halls of the Grand Cathedral they call her God\u2019s perfect weapon, and that is always how you think of her. Versus the immaculate soldier, jaw wired with determination, curls cropped to the bone of her scalp. Outside of Phoenix she has a girl\u2019s face and a girl\u2019s body, half soft and half angles, simultaneously incomprehensible and yet the answer to all your questions. Versus is everything you\u2019ve ever wanted. To look at her is to fill yourself with an ineffable glut of desire, sticky and sweet.\nGod\u2019s perfect weapon sits an agonizing distance away, wrists loose and elbows on knees, gaze on the scuffed floor. Brows knitted. \u201cSomething wrong, Versus?\u201d\nIt\u2019s Rosa, who always asks the questions. Versus looks up. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a military base.\u201d\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been for a while,\u201d says Helianthus, voice rough with irritation. \u201cWe\u2019re a ways into enemy space now, it can\u2019t all be war stuff.\u201d And he\u2019s right. Past the defensive barrier of skin, burrowed deep into flesh, the R\u00e4svelg has reached the gut and gristle of apostate society on its way to the heart. It can\u2019t all be war stuff. There are other things that get in the way, which must be torn asunder to get to the prize.\n\u201cThat was a civilian installation we burned,\u201d Versus says through the gaps in her teeth. \u201cIt was somebody\u2019s home.\u201d\nHelianthus crosses his arms, deepens his slouch against the wall. Deep sarcasm flavors his voice. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got to live somewhere. Even despots and mass murderers.\u201d\nGrimoire snorts. \u201cPretty rich talking about mass murderers here, friend.\u201d\n\u201cVersus is right,\u201d Rosa says. \u201cThe people who lived on Amar-7 weren\u2019t soldiers or even scientists furthering the war. They were just ordinary people trying to live their lives.\u201d\n\u201cThey needed to die,\u201d you say.\nThe others turn with varying speed and intensity. Surprised. Not used to hearing from Stick, the silent one. Rosa frowns. \u201cNeeded to die?\u201d\n\u201cWe have an objective, and they stood in our way. Therefore they had to be eliminated.\u201d As Rosa struggles to formulate a reply, you continue: \u201cIn war, anything that obstructs us from our goal is an enemy.\u201d\n\u201cWow. Stick.\u201d Gauntlet runs a hand over the stubble of his hair. \u201cI knew you were cold, but damn. That\u2019s cold.\u201d\n\u201cThis is our job. It\u2019s what gives us purpose. What else is there?\u201d\nRosa uncrosses her legs. Both feet flat on the floor, eyes narrowed, she says: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s what gives you purpose, Stick. But we weren\u2019t all made to be war machines. Some of us were people before this.\u201d\n\u201cRosa.\u201d Versus gets up, taut with disquiet. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\nThe other woman looks away. Grows silent. Around Versus the holy sigils and pilots shuffle wordlessly, eyes to their feet or the bones of their hands. The fight is over, the discussion at an end, halted by the same ones who started it. No one argues with the will of God\u2019s perfect weapon. As it is. As it should be.\nOf course it was Rosa creating trouble. It was Rosa, after all, who objected to you at first. Not you, necessarily. Not in so many words. But it was her who went to Versus and said, I can\u2019t bear to call your pilot an it. That\u2019s not\u2014That\u2019s awful. I can\u2019t. Can\u2019t they pick something else? Can\u2019t we use they?\nVersus said, those are the pronouns it uses. It\u2019s not bothered by them, what\u2019s the problem?\nThe problem, Rosa said. The problem is that the people who thought they owned me used to call me an it. I heard it, every day, for years, as a child. And I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t hear it now without thinking of them. I\u2019ve tried so hard to forget. Please. It\u2019s such a loaded word. You can\u2019t possibly be okay with this idea. Are you?\nI\u2019m sorry, Versus said. I didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s awful, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll bring it up.\nIn the end, a compromise: no pronouns, just Stick in the place of it/its, which everyone, even Versus, takes a little too readily to. And it works. It\u2019s not what you asked for, but on the other hand, no one\u2019s unhappy.\nStick is an appellation decided by consensus. Your makers never named you, referring to you as \u201cit,\u201d \u201cthe subject,\u201d or with one of the many labels pulled from your file. Project Hou-Ou. Cb48. Male Specimen 15. They grew you from a bone, like Eve, and like Eve they tested you and then ejected you into the world with no armor and no instructions. Versus is your Adam, and on the first day your Adam asks your name, thinking simply that God would provide. She looks at you, perfect and breathtaking, and you, still grappling with language, say: It does not have a name. But it\u2019s the wrong answer. Versus finds your namelessness indefensible, so the R\u00e4svelg\u2019s pilots and sigils designate a call sign you don\u2019t hate and print it on your jackets. Stick is fine. But the first time Versus says, well, in my trials with him\u2014or something similarly banal\u2014you flinch as if slapped.\nIt, you say. It, not him. I\u2019m not a him.\nBut aren\u2019t you a dude? Gauntlet blurts, mouth the fastest part of him as usual. Yet instant understanding flits through Versus. Noted, she says firmly and fusslessly, which leads to Rosa\u2019s later, private protest, and then the compromise. But you\u2019re still an it even as the word is silenced, the syllable fitting over you snug as a membrane, a film. It when you wake up, it when you sweat through training, it when you sit in the fluorescence of the mess hall with the chatter of the other pilots and sigils surrounding you. Most damningly of all, it still in the freedom of Phoenix\u2019s cockpit where all pretense is stripped away, where you are purpose and nothing but purpose. A tool, a miracle, an it. God\u2019s perfect weapon.\nThe commandants load on the praise in the post-Amar-7 briefing, pleased with the battalion\u2019s development in the year since the campaign began. Faster. More efficient. Fewer cuts to the kill. A map on the glass charts the R\u00e4svelg\u2019s progress through apostate space, a bullet fired from the gun of the Pope and Holy Emperor, clearing the way for the army of the Lord. The thin line of your progress dives ever-closer to its goals. Babel-9. The apostate home base. The capital of blasphemy and rebellion. \u201cThree more battles to the end,\u201d says Holy Commandant Basil, pointing out each target with a bony finger. \u201cBy this time next week, the war could be over.\u201d\nHe tuts as joy sweeps the room, a chittering wave passing through the ranks of lieutenants and armchair generals, none of whom will ever see the inside of a mech. \u201cDon\u2019t get so excited. You know the obstacles that lie between us.\u201d\nA hush falls at the reprimand. Into that empty gap someone whispers \u201cThe Beast . . . \u201d and someone else silences them, but it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. Tension grazes the surface of the room. The battalion\u2019s faces turn grim, but it\u2019s her reaction that catches you. She turns her face to hide it, but you catch the barest flash of a familiar sorrow.\nYou know Versus well enough to recognize this sadness, which comes upon her late at night in your shared quarters, before you are banished to your own bunk. She spends long hours in the common bathroom that has been arbitrarily designated the ladies\u2019 room because the girls all hang out there, and you suspect that it is in this place that she expresses her unnamable, wordless grief. You are afraid to follow her there, and therefore this sorrow is an aspect of her that she keeps to herself, and you know nothing of it except that it is there. You\u2019ve grown to accept its existence, confined as it is to the walls of her private spaces. But now it rears its head in the light of the situation room. Why? She is soon to face her greatest enemy. Should she not be ecstatic at the culmination of her purpose? The destiny she was chosen for? The reason you were made for her?\nThe Beast. The Adversary. The wicked blade of the Devil. You will face it soon. The entirety of your existence has been a buildup to this moment of triumph (for you are sure that it will be a triumph). You will meet the creature you were made to destroy, vanquish it, and win victory for the righteous. You should be rapturous with joy. But her ambivalence gives you pause. And you thought you knew her, she whose flesh is your flesh, whose pulse dictates your pulse, whose thoughts should be your thoughts. Yet she is, in this moment, opaque to you. A gap, an unexpected loss in the codons of the narrative that make up your life. Your Adam, God\u2019s perfect weapon, is now a question mark, and you don\u2019t understand. Nor do you have an answer.\nCONFIG A\nThe holy mechs were God\u2019s gift to His children, revealed to the blessed prophet Saint Laurent as the flanks of the last human starfleet traversed the hollow voids of space. Not quite stone and not quite living but somewhere in between, woken only by the blood of holy sigils who are born and not made. Shepherds and guides of humanity, drawn to habitable planets, leaping galactic distances like mere streams, the mechs were instruments of peace until the Devil, in his subterfuge, tempted the apostates away from the loving light of God and toward darkness and violence and war. In this time of evil, where brother turned against brother, the mechs were reforged, plowshares beaten into blades, the beacons for God\u2019s children turned into holy weapons to defend the faithful and the meek from the wicked.\nPhoenix and The Beast are inextricably linked, twinned through some ineffable design. There are two versions of this story, both of which the pilot has heard. The first is the bullet point wiki pumped into its head during training. Phoenix and The Beast are armored units, unique amongst the known mechs, impenetrable shields paired with a banquet of weapons for cutting, crushing, vaporizing, vanquishing. Originally designated Heavy Constructor Units 1 and 2, they were so slow when plugged with other holy sigils that they were unusable. She was specifically selected and trained as a child for her ability to bring Phoenix to maximum operational capacity. And the pilot, being her perfect mirror, achieves syncopation rates in the unit unrivaled by any other pilot in the army. Together they are a relentless weapon destined to meet The Beast before the final battle, for its rival twin is likewise the most formidable weapon the apostates possess, their ultimate line of defense.\nThe second version of the story is the gospel, which the pilot likes better, and which gets whispered from ear to mouth to ear, not in secrecy but in reverence\u2014\n\u2014In the time before the darkness, when the light of God still reached all, a prophetess spoke of two children, a boy and a girl blessed with holy blood, who would be called to fulfill an important destiny in years ahead. Although they did not understand it, the council of cardinals followed the counsel of the Lord to search all of humanity for signs of this blessed pair. Scouts were guided by His Grace to the treasure they sought, and it was she, one half of a pair of holy sigils whose blood and bodies woke the stately limbs of the twinned mechs and let them dance like hawks. Yet no pilot in all the army suited her, so one was made: a Stick shaped from the clay of her, a creature unlike her in every way. Yet in the embrace of the Phoenix they were seamless, pilot and holy sigil, perfection in the eyes of God, enjoined by divine will. When the apostates turned to wickedness and The Beast followed them, the girl and her pilot became the last beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness.\nThis is the version of the story the pilot recites to itself. It smoothes over all the awkward parts, like how it exists feeling like a collection of ill-fitting parts, or how it cannot look in a mirror for fear of seeing its body all wrong, or how it has to constantly fight sinful thoughts of wishing it would emerge from the womb that is Phoenix with the right body, in her body. The story it retreads to remind itself that it was made perfect, and to want otherwise is sin.\nPhoenix streaks toward the factory planet Ajde Prime, the tip of an arrow that comprises the other three mechs. The pilot is back in its place of comfort, this bodiless swell of agency and violence, surrounded by her existence, which overrides its own. Phoenix is the great swallower, consumer of the doubts saddled in its organic body and the questions weighing down its outside-mind. Here, it is free. Free not to worry, free not to think too hard, free not to be anything but the perfect weapon. The uncertainty of the last few days has left it hungry for the finality of destruction. Ajde Prime is unimpeachable as a target: the site of the apostates\u2019 major shipyard, where they make the host that drives their war machine. Surely even that cotton heart of Rosa\u2019s would find no objections in its destruction.\nBut something is wrong. Ajde Prime should be ringed by the fiercest defenses, guarded in the thousands by the sleek and sharp-toothed warships it pumps out. Yet the space around the system has remained silent and prayerful since the R\u00e4svelg dropped out of hyperspace, and continues to be so as the mechs approach the gray-ringed planet, placid in the cool light of its sun. No swarm of angry fighters from the surface. No enemy squadrons. The orbital cannons lie sleepy and inert. It looks like Ajde Prime has been abandoned, as though they have been ghosted by their adversaries. Phoenix scans the surface for heat signatures and finds nothing but geology. Curious, confused, it hangs midair, arms empty, canons idle. Waiting for instructions.\nThe R\u00e4svelg considers the situation carefully and slowly. It is, in all probability, a trap. Perhaps an overwhelming force hides in the gravity well of the planet, or perhaps they have rigged the surface with thermonuclear devices. A possibility with some precedence, the pilot knows. But in its amniotic fluid it feels no fear and no doubt. It waits only for instruction.\nInstruction, then: the R\u00e4svelg orders the mechs to investigate the surface with full caution, Phoenix in front with weapons cranked, Strix, Garuda, and Roc as backup. Past the ice rings they go, through the crystalline atmosphere, and into the oxygen-starved environment of Ajde Prime. Mercury waves beat upon sulfurous shores and acid rain thickens the air. In these infernal environs the glass-walled domes of the apostates sit dark and gleaming, devoid of light and life. The pilot approaches them carefully, intensely alert for any wires it might be tripping, but the surface of Ajde Prime is silent. Was this a massacre, perhaps? Or an evacuation?\nAs if in answer an image flickers into its head, beamed through the same channels through which the R\u00e4svelg transmits orders. An override. What comes through is a picture of a young person, gender unknown, shorthaired and excruciatingly beautiful. It would stop the pilot\u2019s heart, if pilot-as-weapon were reliant on its pathetic body.\nThe image speaks. It\u2019s a recording, a message. Not a conversation. The stranger has a smile like a star field, expansive and glittering. \u201cDon\u2019t panic, just a courtesy call. Apollo, at your service. Artemis sometimes, but not today. You\u2019ll notice that your target, which you expected to be a bustling metropolis of thousands, is unexpectedly, hmm, vacant, you could say. It seems like somebody, can\u2019t imagine who, tipped them off that you were coming. Convinced them it was in their best interests to leave. Of course, there was some resistance, but I think we did pretty well. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nThe pilot drifts, stunned and silent, unable to hold a thought. The stranger\u2014this sometimes-Apollo and sometimes-Artemis\u2014continues. \u201cAren\u2019t you glad for the thousands of lives you\u2019ve not ended today? Alright, maybe that doesn\u2019t appeal to you. Maybe you think they deserve the death you would have brought them. That\u2019s fine. Let me offer you something else, then. Ajde Prime was the main military industrial outpost of the Republic. Now that it\u2019s been shut down, their production of warships has been put on hold. That should please you and your masters, no?\u201d\nThe pilot has no way of replying and no words to reply with. The situation is baffling, unexpected, inexorable. The stranger speaks grandly but with a smirk, and the pilot cannot tell how much of their spiel is genuine. But what\u2019s real is the emptiness below them. Ruse or not, Apollo/Artemis has gutted their objective.\nThe beautiful mirage leans closer, looming larger in the pilot\u2019s headspace. \u201cListen, don\u2019t you have doubts, sometimes? All of you, operators of these superweapons, bringing destruction wherever you go . . . doesn\u2019t it bother you? The lives taken by your hands, the families and communities crushed under your feet . . . have you never stayed awake and thought about them? The Church says this holy war is necessary to cleanse the world of sin, but the blood you have shed, is that not also sin?\u201d\nThe psychic closeness of the stranger, the intensity of their shadowy eyes: it feels like they are speaking to the pilot and the pilot alone. It cannot draw away, cannot blink, cannot shut out the parade of questions.\n\u201cHave you never thought, there must be another answer? Never considered paths other than the one laid out before you? Never imagined other ways of being?\u201d\nThe pilot thanks God it needs no breath right now. It is a trap; it\u2019s definitely a trap. How else would this stranger know\u2014? Forbidden thoughts flood in and the pilot fights to shut its mind down. It cannot let her see the doubts that cloud its mind, cannot let her know that its heart wavers in the dark corners of its consciousness.\nBut the strangest thing happens. From Phoenix\u2019s heart, the seat of the holy sigil where she resides, comes a great shiver of emotion, a pulse of joy that sweeps the body of the mech. It recognizes the sensation as the same euphoria it feels when it is pilot. It has never felt its joy reciprocated\u2014until now. Versus, suddenly enervated and excited, as she has never been.\nWhat does it mean?\nWhat has it missed?\nCONFIG B\nFresh out of her suit, unencumbered in the sliver of freedom before the commandants descend on them, Versus shimmers with excitement: a brightness in her eyes, a novel energy in her movements. Everyone has seen the message\u2014all four mechs got it. But the R\u00e4svelg didn\u2019t; the moment the battalion exited atmosphere there came the demands to explain, what happened down there, you went radio silent. No answers for them\u2014not immediately anyway, the pilots still processing what the hell just happened, so the battalion was hauled back to the ship.\nVersus scans the tiny decompression room. \u201cNothing happened down there, right?\u201d Looking carefully and purposefully at each of you. \u201cWe saw Ajde Prime completely abandoned. No indication where they\u2019d gone. Nothing left behind. Just the husk of a planet. Empty. Silent. Right?\u201d\nThe girls\u2014Rosa and Kestrel, mostly\u2014nod. Sparrow looks away; Helianthus only frowns. Gauntlet bursts out, \u201cBut\u2014!\u201d and is instantly silenced by Grimoire\u2019s hand on his wrist. \u201cVersus is right, Gaunt. There was nothing there.\u201d\nVersus\u2019 gaze fixes upon you, seeking confirmation. She wants you to lie, knowingly, and you\u2019re not sure why. But how can you refuse? She is blessed, after all, and you are only Stick. You push down the vile swarm of doubts rising in your throat and nod.\nWordlessly you sit through panels of questioning and disbelief. The higher-ups on the R\u00e4svelg seem upset that their target evaporated without a fight, as though their holy mission is meaningless without bloodshed. Church superiors are deeply suspicious of this boon; it upsets their narrative of the apostates as war-frenzied animals. Finally, it is the Pope Ficus who says: God blessed us with His perfect weapon. As long as she remains with us, our mission is sacrosanct. It must continue as planned. So it is decided that you will cut deeper into the ventricles of apostate society. One more pit stop on the way to Babel. Whatever this incident at Ajde Prime was, it does not matter. You will take this blessing at face value.\nThat evening, after dinner, Versus tugs you by the wrist. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nShe leads you to the bathroom and frowns\u2014uncomprehending\u2014when you physically resist her at the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asks, as you pull your wrist from her grasp.\n\u201cI can\u2019t go in there.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nWhy not? \u201cThat\u2019s the girl\u2019s bathroom.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. Why would you . . . ?\u201d Puzzlement collapses into disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, Stick. Gender segregation isn\u2019t a thing in this day and age anymore. You do know this, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just you and Rosa and Kestrel . . . \u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re the ones who talk. Come. I want to show you what we talk about.\u201d\nThe thrill of being allowed is immediately overridden by the fear of deviance\u2014not of breaking the rules, but of fitting in badly, like a misplaced puzzle piece. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cStick.\u201d She sighs. \u201cWould it help if I said I\u2019m not really a girl?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nShe takes your hand again. \u201cNevermind. Just come.\u201d\nDizzy and confused by her words, you allow her to lead you into the bathroom; it\u2019s easier than fighting her. Inside, walls of steel glow with amber light. In the common area, away from the individual stalls, Kestrel and Rosa sit, animated by a swell of excitement you\u2019ve never seen from them.\n\u201cThey pulled it off. I can\u2019t believe it. I saw it but I still can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know\u2014Even I thought it was a mad plan, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re blessed, surely we are. How did they\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t tell me, but\u2014\u201d\nVersus clears her throat lightly. The conversation chokes as the two look up and realize who stands next to her.\nPreemptively, Versus says: \u201cI thought I\u2019d invite Stick to join in our meetings.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Rosa folds her hands over her lap. \u201cI see. I just didn\u2019t think Stick would be interested in our conversation.\u201d\n\u201cI think Stick might agree with some of our philosophies,\u201d Versus says.\n\u201cThat surprises me. After all Stick, you seemed pretty strident about our conquest. Have you changed your mind?\u201d\n\u201cStick has doubts like we do. Don\u2019t you?\u201d\nGod\u2019s perfect weapon is looking at you. You\u2019ve been found out, betrayed by the ugly emotions exposed in Phoenix\u2019s cockpit. Versus knows your weaknesses now. Is she testing you?\nKestrel says, gently: \u201cDid the message we saw on Ajde Prime make you realize something, Stick?\u201d\n\u201cYou . . . \u201d There must be something you can say that does not incriminate you further. \u201cYou know who left the message, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nRosa shoots Versus a furious look, but Kestrel only laughs. \u201cYes. I see you\u2019ve guessed it, or something like it. Apollo is my twin. Born together, enlisted together, tested into the pilot program together. They had the blood of a holy sigil, I did not. Ironic, since we were meant to be identical.\u201d\n\u201cYour twin is an apostate . . . \u201d\n\u201cNot an apostate.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell Apollo what to do, even when we were kids. They ran off and joined a group of conscientious dissenters\u2014people who don\u2019t believe this artificial war our leaders have concocted is necessary. It\u2019s full of people from our ranks, but full of people from the other side too. And because they\u2019re Apollo, they\u2019re one of the leaders now. There\u2019s a commune planet\u2014whose location I can\u2019t really disclose\u2014but that\u2019s where I want to be. Eventually.\u201d\nButtoned-up Kestrel has let her mask slip; you\u2019ve never seen her this relaxed. Untangled, her story makes sense now, a solid braid of cause and effect. All this while, behind the veneer of a brisk and competent pilot, she has been hiding the truth of a rebellious twin. \u201cSo you knew what would greet us on Ajde Prime . . . ?\u201d\nKestrel flips a hand. \u201cHardly. Apollo told me they had plans, but I thought they were doomed to fail. I don\u2019t know how they pulled it off. Timing? A long tail of preparation? An unbelievable helping of luck, most probably.\u201d\n\u201cA miracle,\u201d Rosa says.\n\u201cA miracle,\u201d Versus repeats, firmly. She sits beside Rosa and gestures to the space next to Kestrel, for you. \u201cGod is good to us. He shows us the way where our leaders will not. He opens the paths for us to follow.\u201d\nYou sit slowly, disoriented and silent. Kestrel takes your hand, and you jump at the touch of her fingers in all their warmth. She has on a kindly smile, but your voice is lodged in your lungs. The conversation continues around you as you struggle for footing on ground that keeps shifting.\nRosa clasps Versus\u2019 hands. \u201cHave you heard? There\u2019s a rumor going around the officers\u2019 quarters. The Beast is on the move now. We might end up fighting him sooner than expected.\u201d\n\u201cI see. No, I haven\u2019t heard.\u201d\n\u201cAre you alright? You\u2019ve gone pale.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Versus exhales, looks to the ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight him. I really, really don\u2019t.\u201d\nIs she afraid of The Beast? Is that what drives these doubts of hers? You stare at her like you could pick her apart, revealing if it\u2019s fear that lurks in her soul\u2014or something else.\n\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to, don\u2019t you? Versus, we\u2019re all ready to make a move. Even Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The whole battalion can leave at any time. But we\u2019re not leaving you behind.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Her voice cracks, and the unfamiliar note chills every knot in your spine. You\u2019ve never seen her like this, never, could not have imagined it ever. She trembles like a bulkhead about to splinter, fingers twisted, eyes to the ground. \u201cJordan is a believer, he\u2019s never going to abandon his post and betray our teacher. And I can\u2019t leave him to rampage unchecked. As long as The Beast fights, I have to oppose him.\u201d\n\u201cAllie, you know that\u2019s not true. What he does is between him and God, and no one else. You\u2019re only responsible for your own fate.\u201d Rosa leans forward. \u201cEvery battle we fight, every moment we linger on in this rich man\u2019s war, we make it worse.\u201d\nVersus sighs and her shoulders slump forward. Kestrel says, \u201cHave you prayed on this, Alicia?\u201d\n\u201cI have. I have prayed for an answer for so, so long, yet God has not given me a sign. I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe I should beg His forgiveness, but . . . \u201d\n\u201cHave you considered,\u201d Rosa says, \u201cthat the miracle we witnessed today might have been one such sign?\u201d\n\u201cI . . . have, yes.\u201d\n\u201cI always say prayer takes time,\u201d Kestrel says, \u201cbut we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Prayer.\u201d Versus straightens up, eyes bright. Holds out her hands. \u201cLet us pray.\u201d\n\u201cLet us pray,\u201d Rosa agrees.\nA circle forms, Kestrel\u2019s warm hand in your left and Versus\u2019 dry one in your right. \u201cI will pray for the souls of the lost,\u201d Rosa says, \u201cand for those on Ajde Prime. God keep them safe.\u201d\n\u201cI pray for my sibling,\u201d Kestrel says. \u201cFor their safety and the success of their mission.\u201d\nVersus makes a throat-sound, then pauses to draw in a long breath, long enough that your skin starts to chill. Everyone waits. Finally she says, her eyes downcast: \u201cI pray for The Beast.\u201d\nNow it\u2019s your turn. What should you pray for? For guidance? For clarity? For victory in battle? For more esoteric things, like the realization of your want to be mech, permanently, or perhaps a name that makes sense to you, that is yours? Or maybe a body that feels like it\u2019s on your side. That you don\u2019t feel betrayed by every time you catch your reflection.\nEveryone is looking at you. You reach for the closest, easiest thing. \u201cI pray for happiness,\u201d you say. \u201cFor joy. For euphoria.\u201d\nThe four of you lower your heads, and you pray.\nIn your bunk, flat on your back, vision a starless vista of ceiling, sleep evades you. The breathing from the lower bunk tells you that God\u2019s perfect weapon is similarly awake.\n\u201cVersus,\u201d you begin.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you mean when you said you\u2019re not really a girl? Earlier.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Her voice is dark, glossy. \u201cDoes that bother you? It\u2019s nothing. Not much, anyway. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m a girl, it\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve had for a long time. I\u2019m in-between. Not one or the other. But that\u2019s largely inconsequential. I have a job to do. Or maybe a job to not do. In any case that\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing on. I can worry about myself later.\u201d\n\u201cBut it does matter,\u201d you say. \u201cThe prophecy said you should be a girl . . . \u201d\n\u201cI know. I mean, I don\u2019t like the prophecy very much. Or at all. But I suppose that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never mentioned it. I don\u2019t want to upset people, or . . . draw scrutiny. I\u2019m not really bothered if people think of me as a girl. There are other things that bother me more.\u201d\n\u201cLike The Beast.\u201d\nA volcanic sigh. \u201cLike The Beast.\u201d\nSilence creeps back into the room. After a while, she says, \u201cI\u2019m sure you have questions about that.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nHer weight shifts audibly in the bunk below. She\u2019s sat up, speaking into the dark. \u201cJordan and I were found as children. They singled us out from the blood banks. We were ten. They came to our schools and they had lists of names and everything. After extensive tests we were the only two left. It\u2019s been obscured by the Church, but the prophecy\u2014the program\u2014was really about making sigils who were also pilots. It\u2019s tied up with why the schism happened . . . but that doesn\u2019t matter now. Jordan and I were part of the program. We were cultivated together for . . . how many years was it? Seven? Ten? No, it has to be seven. The schism happened when we were seventeen. So, seven years. We trained together, lived in the same house . . . we weren\u2019t allowed outside on our own. Of course not. In that time, Jordan was family. My twin brother. We did everything together. Then the schism happened, and our teacher, the man who led us . . . he left to become an apostate. Jordan went with him. They were always closer than I was. This was . . . five years ago? Ten? Time doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. That was what happened. We haven\u2019t seen each other since.\u201d\nThe expressionless ceiling doesn\u2019t blink as you stare. Versus\u2019 words rattle in your head like bullet casings, or untethered ships, an empty collection of sounds and syllables that should have meaning attached, but you can\u2019t decode them.\nA shuffle of synthetic against synthetic from below. It goes on for a while, then Versus appears at the edge of your bunk, standing on tiptoe, the hard square of a transflat in her hand. \u201cHere.\u201d It lights up with a photo album, a scroll through the tender years of Versus\u2019 life. There she is, birthday cake, there she is again, draped over the edge of a radioactive blue pool, there she is nestled in the yellow arms of a tree. A different Versus, with skinnier arms and teeth that look too big for her face. In every picture there is a boy beside her, bright-eyed and velvet-cheeked, his grin wider than hers. The pilot of The Beast, as a child, and then as an older child. He and Versus look nothing alike, clearly they\u2019re not related, but there\u2019s a sameness to them that makes them look like a pair. Most of the pictures are taken in one house, with arched windows and fake vines plastered to the cornices. It looks nice. Is it nice? You have no baseline to judge this with.\nVersus watches the passage of her life with a fond smile. Her voice has gone soft and rounded with a timbre you\u2019re unfamiliar with. \u201cWhen we were chosen, we were rebaptized. Given new life, given over to service in God\u2019s name. Jordan was my brother, but he was more than that. They preached that our souls were twinned, you know? It was important to us. I loved him. And . . . I don\u2019t want to fight him, but he made his choices. Now it\u2019s come to this.\u201d\nThe slideshow of Versus\u2019 other life continues. Versus in a red skirt patterned with flowers. Versus in blue jeans, shredded at the knee.\nShe says, \u201cIt still confuses me sometimes, frightens me even, how everything turned out. How you can live with someone for so long, and think you know them to the last atom, to their soul, and find out you were wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d you say. It\u2019s a lie. Or maybe it\u2019s not a lie. Versus is right.\nShe looks curiously at you. \u201cStick,\u201d she says, \u201cwhy did you ask me about the gender thing? Of all the facts you learned today, why was that the one that bothered you the most?\u201d\nYou look at the bones of your hands. The light from the transflat carves crescents of shadow behind your knuckles. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI figured it out. It wasn\u2019t like an angel descended on a beam of light and told me what my gender was. It\u2019s an ongoing process. Little feelings, here and there, that maybe my gender was more of a question than I thought. Things weren\u2019t right, or didn\u2019t fit right. Eventually I realized what it meant.\u201d She places her fingers, firm and cool, over your wrist. \u201cIt could be an ongoing process for you too.\u201d\nYou nod and she frowns, concerned by your silence. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a lot to take in. Are you alright? Do you want to talk about anything?\u201d But you don\u2019t. What good would talking do? How could talking ever solve any of your problems?\nIt really isn\u2019t about Versus\u2019 gender, except that it is. You thought you knew which side of the divide she was on. It informed the map of your life. You used to reason with yourself like this, sometimes: Eve was grown from the rib of Adam, yet Eve turned out woman while Adam turned out man, so it follows that you should be opposite of Versus, the same way Eve was opposite of Adam. Yet this burning desire for your body and existence to perfectly mirror hers won\u2019t leave you alone, and this is what drives your extraordinary resonance in Phoenix. Your need to change yourself is not driven by your selfish desires, but a side effect of what you were designed for; you have to yearn toward her being or the connection won\u2019t work. She is the vessel for God\u2019s will and so are you. A tool, a miracle, an it. God\u2019s perfect weapon.\nBut that\u2019s been turned upside down. There\u2019s a Versus you never knew, a Versus who doubts her mission, a Versus who has a history you knew nothing about. A Versus before she was Versus. And if Versus isn\u2019t who you thought she was, if she\u2019s not even the gender you thought she was, then where does that leave you? In a body you understand less than before, with a mission that has been muddled beyond comprehension.\nWhat are you supposed to do?\nCONFIG A\nThe big fight, when it comes, is entirely unexpected. A jerk out of hyperspace, and the corridors go angry with red light and black smoke. The mech battalion falls out of bed and scrambles into battle, adrenaline-drunk. The apostates have tracked down the R\u00e4svelg and dragged it into Newtonian space using forbidden technology, the Devil\u2019s tools. By the time the pilot mounts itself in Phoenix\u2019s cockpit, the enemy is a series of flashing blips on the horizon. The Beast, tailed by two support mechs. Half-familiar shapes, gilded in the shimmering livery of the apostates. The R\u00e4svelg is halfway from its destination the next system over. The apostates have decided not to wait for their arrival, taking matters into their own hands.\nThe Beast and its companions have the silhouettes of trees, of centipedes, of bones: all spindle and angle and wrong. They\u2019ve taken God-given mechs and defiled them. Twisted them to unholy purpose. The sight of this blasphemy sets the pilot\u2019s soul alight, burning its doubts to white powder. This is what it was made for. Its ultimate battle. Kill or be killed.\nThe Beast agrees. The abomination rushes its enemies in an arc of pure hunger, and God above it moves so fast, its entire arm is a gleaming blade of destruction. The pilot joyously leaps to meet it\u2014\nNo.\nThe pilot has never heard Versus speak while they are joined. Shock jars its grip on control, and in that glistening half-second Versus pulls on the brakes and Phoenix comes to a sudden, juddering halt. I don\u2019t want to. I won\u2019t.\nWhat is she doing, what is happening? The resonance that comprises God\u2019s perfect weapon has been shattered. The pilot fights Versus for dominance, but it cannot win, not when she is the holy sigil, the heart and engine of the mech, and The Beast is nearly upon them, ready to strike\u2014\nThe Beast vanishes. The stars vanish. The universe around them vanishes. Phoenix vanishes from under the pilot, as though subatomized in the flick of an eyelid. Pink light fills its consciousness.\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d\nThe pilot knows that voice. That rich velvet belongs to Apollo/Artemis. The dissidents are here, but how? Were they tracked, was there collusion? What did Apollo do?\n\u201cSorry about the surprise.\u201d Apollo/Artemis\u2019 voice curls around the pilot\u2019s spine, or whatever it is that passes for a spine here. \u201cIt\u2019s me, your friend Apollo. In the flesh. Or, well. In the mind.\u201d A silvery laugh. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have entered the atmosphere of Ajde Prime, huh? We left a few surprises for you. Almost shocked no one checked for nanites, but that\u2019s the problem with the papacy, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re all so full of yourselves, you never thought that the planet itself might be a trap.\u201d\nThe dissidents have won control of the mechs, somehow. Are the nanites in the fighters, or in their bodies? In fact, it doesn\u2019t matter. Some kind of neural net has a hold of them. The pilot\u2019s body? Mind? Is trapped in this vast gummy pink, like sugar, but spun with spidersilk, suffocating and inexorable. It tries to rip something free, an arm, a leg, anything. Its perception of the universe has been sublimated by this wooly expanse, and the longer it stays here the more it feels like there is nothing to the universe but this soft blankness. Where is The Beast? Where is the rest of the battalion? Where is Versus?\nHere she comes, rising enormous and avian through the fog. A wild swoop of emotion. Where is he? What have you done with him?\nApollo speaks into both their minds. \u201cSorry, had to intervene. Would have been bad if you two killed one another. Trying to avoid that, you know?\u201d\nThe other holy sigils and pilots are elsewhere in this ether, faint but familiar pings of contact, generous in their calm. Rolling with this turn in their fortunes, better than the alternative.\nVersus speaks to Apollo. I know you. We\u2019ve never met, but I know you.\n\u201cSame. Listen, you\u2019ve got to withdraw from here. I have him too, all three of them, but I can\u2019t hold them back for long, the nanites will give out.\u201d\nI want to talk to him.\n\u201cI thought you might. Not sure if that\u2019s gonna work, though. Might be a bad idea.\u201d\nPlease, let me try. I have to.\nAll this time the pilot has experienced Versus as a neutral presence in Phoenix: a heartbeat, a body that powers the mech like a battery. Inert. She\u2019s never been wired with naked determination like this, lit with the kind of fire that would burn cities to cinders. Versus has come alive the way she is in the flesh, bold and sharply defined as she is on the R\u00e4svelg. All this time, the pilot\u2019s wants have smothered the truth of her apathy when they are joined. It never knew.\nA white swell surges toward them, cetacean and threatening. The Beast is on the hunt through the gelatinous pink. He seethes with fury: he cannot believe he has been thwarted so close to his goal. His frustration poisons the ether in waves. The Beast wants nothing but to kill and to vanquish and to destroy; war has broken and shaped him into a creature that craves violence above all. His bloodthirst tugs at the pilot with an ache of familiarity, horrifying and sticky as a broken tooth. That\u2019s what I look like, it thinks.\nJordan.\nVersus\u2019 entreaty only draws the white whale toward them at double speed. There\u2019s nothing there but rage and rows of teeth that shine as he yawns open to swallow them whole.\nApollo intervenes. In this liminal space they are the end and the beginning, the morning and the evening star, and The Beast freezes in place, jaw unhinged, close enough to touch. Jordan, Versus says. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s Alicia. You remember, don\u2019t you?\nDoes he? Where is the child from that house with the windows and the plaster vines, who put bunny ears on people in photos and wore silly pirate costumes to parties? Is that child still alive in the belly of the beast? Or is there nothing left but rage and teeth?\nJordan, listen. We don\u2019t have to fight. I don\u2019t want to fight. Let\u2019s run away. Let them sort out their problems on their own.\nFuck you. The Beast speaks like an avalanche. Like stones being crushed. His voice is exactly as the pilot has pictured.\nThis isn\u2019t like you. You\u2019re not an angry person, you\u2019re not hateful. I remember you, you were a kind kid. You\u2019ve changed, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\nShut the fuck up. You sound like a loser.\nJordan, I\u2019m serious. Let\u2019s leave now, we can go with Apollo. I miss you. This war isn\u2019t worth us killing one another.\nFuck you. Go on and run then. I\u2019ll cut you down like the coward you are. I\u2019ll see you in hell.\nThe Beast disappears without breath or sound, and all that\u2019s left is the boggy pink. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of that,\u201d Apollo says. \u201cHey sis\u2014Versus\u2014y\u2019all got to go now, the net is fraying. I\u2019ll hold the apostates while you call a retreat, but you\u2019ve got to get out. The time for reason is over. Now\u2019s for survival. But hey\u2014\u201d he says, a parting shot that sparks through the pilot\u2019s consciousness\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t keep me waiting too long, alright?\u201d\nThe cotton candy universe vanishes, and they\u2019re back in the lightless void of space, fighting distance from the crooked jaws of the Beast and its associates. Still inert, trapped in Apollo\u2019s grip. The pilot, returned to the comfort of Phoenix, which is solid, which is all that it knows, is back in control of itself. It wrenches toward its foe, seeing the God-given opportunity to destroy its defenseless target.\nBut Versus tugs back. Stops the pilot from doing its job, just as she did before. Versus is radioing the R\u00e4svelg, calling for a retreat, and the ship\u2019s commanders, relieved of their panic at the sudden suspension of their most precious war units, agree at once. They are withdrawing, leaving the frozen apostates behind. The pilot no longer recognizes the shape of the world.\nCONFIG A\nThe commandants are in an uproar. The dissidents have been a longtime spine in the side of the Church, but they\u2019ve never been a threat until now. There\u2019s no script, no verse, no commandment that teaches how to deal with this. They\u2019re on their own, until the apostates learn to find them again.\nWhile the higher-ups are locked in for hours of shouting and recriminations, Versus calls a clandestine meeting of her own, defying orders to stay in quarters until further notice. It\u2019s an emergency. They\u2019re just about to find out that your battalion lied in the last debrief; time is running out for you and this group of traitors-in-waiting. No, not in waiting: that is incorrect. Traitors in truth and flesh. Just undiscovered. The crime has been committed, it cannot be undone. It\u2019s part of who you are now, woven into your bones as surely as your blood makes endless pilgrimage in your veins. It was Versus who led you to this, all of you but you in particular. You let her do this to you.\nThe eight of you cram into the bathroom-conference room, now claustrophobic with bodies. Everyone is here, even mousy Sparrow tucked under Rosa\u2019s arm. It really is a gender-neutral bathroom after all. You breathe very slowly and carefully and try not to let your skin touch anyone else\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Helianthus asks, grumpily. He makes it sound like this is a minor inconvenience, like someone\u2019s broken the foodmaker in the mess hall.\n\u201cWe have to leave,\u201d Versus says. The doubt has been distilled from her voice and all that\u2019s left is conviction, pure and clear and stinging. The Beast, her last tether to the Church, has been peeled from her soul. \u201cThe plans we\u2019ve made? Now\u2019s the time to put them in motion.\u201d\nA murmur of assent. Kestrel says, \u201cAre you sure, Allie?\u201d Not to cast doubt, but to fortify her resolve.\n\u201cI am.\u201d The passage of Apollo\u2019s intervention has changed her, broken her spine and reforged it into steel. She emerged from the wet cradle of Phoenix a different person. You thought she was a weapon before, but you realize you never understood the word.\nThe rest of the battalion seems sad, but determined. Frightened. Eager. As Rosa rubs Sparrow\u2019s shoulders, a glassy realization\u2014they\u2019ve talked about this before\u2014cuts you. Everyone in this room has had private conversations about this, whole fora about sedition and doubt and disbelief, and it was all hidden from you. It recasts every conversation you\u2019ve had with them, every argument you\u2019ve watched them have. Suddenly you\u2019ve found yourself in a group of strangers. Ice climbs your spine and lodges in the base of your skull.\nThe Beast felt so familiar in Apollo\u2019s neural net. Like recognizing. Like mirrors for each other. You are the Beast, standing in disguise among a group of humans. Ugly and yellow as old bone.\n\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Kestrel says. \u201cApollo\u2019s people are close by. There\u2019s a satellite planet. I just have to give the signal.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ll be here?\u201d Gauntlet asks.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kestrel says. \u201cWe have to be ready to move out by then.\u201d\nThe battalion will take the holy mechs. The Church might be able to make new pilots, pray for new sigils, but the mechs are irreplaceable. The consequences of their betrayal will be unthinkable, unknowable, unchartable. Before you yawns a great chasm of uncertainty with no bottom.\nGauntlet slaps his palms together. \u201cAight then, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d Rosa reaches out and catches him by the sleeve. \u201cLet us pray, first.\u201d\n\u201cLet us pray,\u201d Versus affirms.\nIn the tiny gender-neutral bathroom everyone joins hands, heads bowed. In the tightness and anxiety of the circle nobody notices that you\u2019re standing apart. Your hands are hidden, tucked behind your back, nails biting into the flesh of your palm.\nIn your shared quarters Versus is cramming what little she has into a duffel bag. \u201cWe have to hurry,\u201d she says, her voice tight with\u2014what is it, nervousness? Excitement? You can\u2019t tell. You feel lightyears away from her, even though she is close enough to touch. \u201cThat prayer cut out all the buffer time we had. We shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d Then she freezes, halfway through zipping up, struck by her own words. \u201cWhat am I saying? Of course we should have.\u201d She sighs, then looks at you. \u201cStick, what\u2019s wrong? You haven\u2019t packed.\u201d\nNo one has asked for your opinion in this entire process. Not a single person, not even Versus. It was just assumed that you would follow obediently. Now she comes toward you, brows knitted. \u201cStick, you\u2019re coming with us, aren\u2019t you? We can\u2019t leave you behind. I mean. I suppose we can. But I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you think I\u2019d want to do this?\u201d\nShe blinks, startled. \u201cBecause you aren\u2019t happy here.\u201d\nYou frown.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t, are you? You aren\u2019t happy with what they\u2019ve made of you. What they want you to be. You aren\u2019t happy.\u201d\nYour mouth is dry is as the chasm between stars. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be.\u201d It\u2019s an alien word, an alien concept, a thing that happens to other people while you stand on the outside and watch. What does happy mean? What is it, an emotion? A series of things happening? A state of being?\n\u201cCome with us,\u201d she pleads, taking your hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nFear spasms through your forearms, and you pull your hands from hers, embarrassed and afraid. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cStick . . . \u201d\nMaybe happiness is a lack, an absence. Maybe it\u2019s the void left behind that uncertainty, doubt, and self-loathing would otherwise occupy. Maybe it\u2019s the feeling, that precious feeling, that you only ever feel in one place, under one condition.\nYou say, \u201cI\u2019m not like you. I can\u2019t be happy living in a house with other people, a nice house with windows and vines on the ceiling. I wasn\u2019t made for that. I was made to be a weapon. I\u2019m only happy being a weapon.\u201d\nShe tilts her head. \u201cYou think violence is all you\u2019re good for?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d She goes back to her bag, unzips it. Time is spiraling away while you\u2019re having this conversation; Versus should just leave. But she doesn\u2019t. She pulls a long, stony thing out of the bag. A knife. Unsheathed, its black blade gleams like a smile.\nShe marches back to you, puts the knife in your hand and takes your wrist. Tucks the sharp, obsidian edge under her chin, where jaw and neck meet. \u201cDo it. If only violence makes you happy, then do it.\u201d\nYou\u2019re frozen. Her grip on your wrist is so strong that you cannot pull back, and if you slide yourself free you will cut her throat open. Even letting go of the blade might harm her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Can\u2019t do it? Why not, Stick? I\u2019m a traitor; I\u2019ve conspired with my fellows to commit high treason. If your mission is so important, you have to stop me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cVersus, stop.\u201d\nShe lets you go and your shaking hand snaps instantly to your chest, fingers curled around the knife\u2019s handle like a vise. It\u2019s surprisingly light, well-made, carbon fiber? Ceremonial, or a memento.\n\u201cThere, Stick. It\u2019s not the violence that drives you, is it? It\u2019s not violence that matters to you. You\u2019re just chasing the things that make you happy. That make you feel whole. So that makes you human, like any of us. You deserve to be human.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d What about the unmatched euphoria that only comes when you are Phoenix, when you are mech, when you are it? Is that not by design? \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me. I\u2019m broken.\u201d\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s untrue.\u201d\nHer face is soft and sad; the thought of cutting into her fills you with nausea. You push down the horrifying images of her with her neck sliced through, her blood all over your hands and her tunic and the floor. This isn\u2019t anything like the fire and brimstone of Phoenix\u2019s cockpit. The world has been smashed open like a candy egg and you can\u2019t make sense of anything that\u2019s spilling out of it. You look at the flesh on your own wrist, filled with blood and tendons. It\u2019s you, it\u2019s this body, it\u2019s always been.\nBut if your body is a problem, it can be solved. And the tool to do so is in your hand.\nVersus closes her hand around your wrist again. Gently this time, but with enough pressure to let you know that she\u2019s prepared to stop you from doing the rash thing that\u2019s leaped into your mind. You haven\u2019t said a word, but she knows anyway. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\nTime hasn\u2019t stopped. The two of you can\u2019t stay locked here much longer. You\u2019re holding her back. Versus has already made her choice, she knows what she wants. You, on the other hand, know nothing about anything. She should let you do the rash thing. \u201cI\u2019ll only burden you.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nShe says: \u201cCome with me, Stick. Please.\u201d\nShe says: \u201cThey made you a weapon, just as they turned me into one. They fed us sweet lies to keep us happy at our jobs. But we aren\u2019t weapons, Stick. We aren\u2019t objects, no matter how much they want us to be. We don\u2019t have to stay the way they made us.\u201d\nYou shiver. You shake your head. You\u2019re haunted by the Beast, angry even when offered a chance at peace. If he couldn\u2019t be redeemed, how can you? \u201cI don\u2019t know any other way to be.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s the only choice you\u2019ve ever had. But there can be more. Will be more.\u201d\nYou lick your lips. There\u2019s terror there, in the dryness. But there\u2019s also hope and the freedom of the unknown, which is almost as frightening. Versus isn\u2019t letting you go, and maybe Versus knows better than you what makes a monster and what makes a person. She\u2019s seen the other side of the mirror, after all. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be human.\u201d\nA small smile. \u201cNobody does.\u201d A squeeze of the hand. \u201cBut let\u2019s figure it out together.\u201d Her skin against yours is warm. Her wrist against your wrist, the blood pulsing within. Same as the blood pulsing through you. A resonance.\nCONFIG C\nIn the end, I still don\u2019t know if it was the right thing to do. We took the mechs, the main offensive force of the Church, and ran without looking back. The vacuum that resulted didn\u2019t collapse structures, but it tilted the war back in favor of the apostates. They\u2019re still fighting, as far as we know. Maybe we could have ended the war earlier, if we\u2019d stayed in it. But maybe we would have made it worse. It\u2019s impossible to know now. What\u2019s important is we got out.\nThese days there is the yellow sky of an M-class planet, a field heaped with flowers and herbs, a house on a hill that looks like a glass cathedral. These days Helianthus, who goes by Lars, has cultivated an excessive number of fruit trees, an orchard really; there are never enough hands to help with the harvest, never enough mouths for all the jars of preserves we make. Kestrel, who these days goes by Nike, is helping her twin run the resistance. She\u2019s here and there, but she visits when she can. Sparrow, who these days goes by Jasper, is a painter. Gauntlet and Grimoire took off and established a satellite commune on the southern continent, I hear it\u2019s doing well. And on the downslope of the hill, Versus, who these days goes by Alicia, has their head in the lap of Rosa, who these days goes by Nishi. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll ever come around?\u201d they ask. \u201cI miss him still.\u201d And Nishi, who\u2019s running her fingers over the bronzed expanse of Alicia\u2019s shoulder, says, \u201cThere\u2019s always hope.\u201d\nApollo/Artemis is just as beautiful in person. They spend most of their time away\u2014war\u2019s still not over, still so much to do\u2014so their sweetness comes in bursts, like ripened boughs in the summer. When the buttery light touches their curls in the morning it outlines them in goldenrod perfection and the world comes to a standstill for as long as it takes them to slide into consciousness. I\u2019m learning to paint\u2014Jasper is teaching me\u2014in hopes that one day I\u2019ll be able to capture the euphoria of these evanescent moments with brush and pigment.\nAs for me, I still don\u2019t know. There\u2019s lots of things I\u2019m still figuring out. I\u2019ve picked a name, but I still let my old warmates call me Stick, from time to time. They\u2019ve earned it. About my pronouns\u2014I\u2019m figuring that out, too. I still don\u2019t know. I\u2019m allowed. Apollo/Artemis says it\u2019s taken them their whole life so far to sort out the names and words they like to use, and if someone as sure of themself as they are is still working it out, then I\u2019ve got time. See, the one thing I\u2019ve learned, and keep learning over and over again, is that there\u2019s no one answer to everything. I\u2019m lurching toward understanding, one day at a time.

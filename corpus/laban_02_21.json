We hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nI follow her past the bar and four-tops to the back of the restaurant, where a row of line cooks mince parsley and knead dough. Beyond the dough\u2019s malty sweetness, I take in the rich smell of roast geese as they\u2019re basted by the sous chef and bananas caramelizing deeper into the kitchen. I cover my nose to keep myself from getting nauseous once I\u2019m seated at the end of the counter, away from the other customers. When a waiter slips a basket of rolls at my elbow, I break one open and let the steam wash over my face.\nThe internship supervisor warned me that eighteen hours is the standard length of time I should wait once back on Earth before exposing myself to strong aromas and tastes. It\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve broken that rule in as many trips back from the C. P. Menlo Cosmocurrencies Division. Nothing happened the first time, but I don\u2019t want to risk throwing up tonight. The line cooks stare like the hostess did, tighten their smiles, and make a show of complimenting each other on their prep work. The sommelier pops by to ask if I\u2019d like their house recommendation. It occurs to me that this may be the only spot in Pittsburgh that won\u2019t card me.\n\u201cWhatever pairs well with bread rolls,\u201d I say.\n\u201cExcellent choice,\u201d says the sommelier.\nWith half an hour left before closing time, I had expected the restaurant to clear out so that I could have more privacy with the original Diana, but the bar is full and several booths are celebrating various occasions. I look for Diana when a holographic birthday dessert bursts open at a long table, and again when waitstaff claps for a woman proposing to her longtime partner, and a third time when the hostess and the sous argue over a customer\u2019s order.\nWhen I finish my fourth helping of bread rolls, I focus on the line cooks instead, sipping white wine to block my sinuses and dull my sense of smell. I watch them as their knives flutter onions into ribbons, dash cognac into flames over steel pans. I catch a whiff of hickory smoke and search for the dish that wafts it.\n\u201cMom and Dad never taught you how to cook, did they?\u201d asks someone next to me. It\u2019s my voice, but huskier. I turn and see myself at twice my age.\nI hate Original Diana immediately, or at least I want to hate her. Nothing should surprise me about her appearance, yet I\u2019m embarrassed to be excited to look like her when I\u2019m in my forties. My cheeks get hot when I think about how I held out a shred of hope that she would look, at best, like a shoddy beta version of me. Instead, her black jumpsuit and moonrock jewelry make her striking against my postflight black curls and simple skater dress. The restaurant website\u2019s proud newspaper reviews had the same glowing face, surrounded by the same chic mid-century interior and tantalizing food. I tried to convince myself that it was makeup, surgery, Photoshop, or some other conflation of the truth. But I\u2019m here now, in her domain. Original Diana smiles at me.\n\u201cNope,\u201d I say. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me becoming another restaurateur.\u201d\n\u201cI figured,\u201d she responds.\nOriginal Diana chuckles, takes a seat, and waves at the line cooks, who stand there with grins on their faces like they\u2019re the hungry ones, waiting for her to explain what the hell is going on. No two people would have looked this similar unless they were identical twins, and our age difference is clear. Diana ignores them. She reaches her hand out like a question, and I nod. She takes my chin in with the tips of her fingers and tilts my head around.\n\u201cSo Mom and Dad advanced the replication technique once they got the hang of perfecting simple body parts for their hospital patients,\u201d she starts. \u201cI\u2019m sure they never wanted an exact duplicate of me anyway.\u201d\nShe notes how my nose is narrower and how I\u2019m skinnier than she was at my age. She gasps when she realizes I don\u2019t wear contacts.\n\u201cNoticeably lighter skin, too, than either me or them. Perhaps they thought you\u2019d be safer that way,\u201d Diana says. \u201cAmazing what someone can do when they don\u2019t adhere to legal restrictions on cloning. What did they use?\u201d\n\u201cThey grew me from an eyelash on your pillow,\u201d I say. Her hand leaves my face, and she sips from a glass of water that the hostess has placed for her. I inhale and begin the speech I had planned. \u201cAt first, they tried fingernails, then blood, then hair. None worked and they were running out of your DNA, but they lucked out. They speed-incubated the cells from the eyelash up to when you were thirteen, so I would have a wide memory base and they would only have to worry about raising me through high school and college. It\u2019s a method that took them\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThirteen years to perfect and eight years to raise you,\u201d Original Diana finishes. The calm with which she intuits the line feels like a violation, as if I\u2019m the one who hasn\u2019t realized there\u2019s a second iteration of myself. Original Diana swivels in the barstool so that she can lean against the counter. Behind her, another birthday dessert arrives to a small family. The bartender announces last call. \u201cThey raised me for a bit longer than that, Diana. The full twenty-one years.\u201d\n\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I start.\n\u201cA disappointment?\u201d Original Diana says, her lips tugging at the seams. \u201cYes, you\u2019re now the same age I was when I ruined things for everyone and drove my life down the gutter. I was a selfish brat who got into Pitt instead of Carnegie Mellon, switched my major from galactic finance to art history, dropped out when I was twenty-one, and haven\u2019t been seen since the screaming match with my parents about wanting to be a chef. All they ever wanted to do was look out for me when I had myopic dreams that would never take off. I was just some spoiled brat like all the white children whose parents didn\u2019t know how to raise them.\u201d\nOriginal Diana keeps going and matches what Mom and Dad have said word for word. My mind goes blank. It\u2019s the story that my . . . our parents told me when they woke me at thirteen. I\u2019ve heard it every birthday since.\nThe Original Diana never amounted to anything. Grabe naman. If only she had listened to us and gone into interstellar futures projection, like cosmocurrencies, once the cryptocurrency boom went bust. She\u2019d have been a happy daughter rather than a hopeless ingrate with no future. Her life has been in shambles ever since she left home, a black hole sucking in the promise of a secure career.\nRuined, selfish, spoiled. When Original Diana gets to the \u201chopeless ingrate\u201d part, the unnerving precision makes my throat run dry.\nDon\u2019t be those things, Diana. Don\u2019t leave us like she did. We love you and want what\u2019s best for you. Please let us know if you need anything, anak. Family always stays together.\n\u201cI\u2019m clearly doing poorly with my Michelin-starred city restaurant,\u201d Original Diana says. She leans in and whispers into my face. \u201cI was a wild, unreasonable monster. Obviously, they should have punished me more while I was growing up.\u201d\nThere had always been a small fear in the back of my mind that my parents had kept something from me, but Original Diana\u2019s intent repetition of what she went through over twenty years ago confirms what I didn\u2019t want to believe was true: if they wanted to, or if I ever crossed them, Mom and Dad could be unspeakably cruel.\nOriginal Diana\u2019s full lips spread into a broad smile, and the hush as she waits for me to react lingers until I notice that the line cooks have cleaned up their stations and the waitstaff are clustered by the bar. The last customers pay their checks and leave. Diana turns away from me for a moment to announce to her staff that she\u2019ll close up for the night. They holler back thank-yous that find middle ground between her and me.\nWhile she has her back to me, I leap from my barstool and bolt to the emergency exit behind us. None of this is going as planned. The door leads out to a crowded alley of more staff smoking with burly strangers in employee uniforms that I recognize from the neighboring shops. They greet me as \u201cboss\u201d and try to pass me a cigarette. This isn\u2019t going as planned either. I excuse myself, step back into the restaurant, and shut the door.\n\u201cYou forgot your bag, Diana,\u201d Original Diana calls after me. \u201cWe always forget our bag, don\u2019t we?\u201d\nI whip around.\n\u201cI had a speech,\u201d I yell at her. \u201cI waited for the crappy bus for forty minutes to get from Carnegie Mellon to the South Side in an hour.\u201d\n\u201cWas that speech literally what I said, but with our roles reversed?\u201d Diana states more than asks. \u201cRemember, I know you. And no, saying it to my face is not going to make you feel better about yourself. You will always feel like a disappointment, and that\u2019s not my fault.\u201d\nThe shock spreads over me. We always forget our bag. She\u2019s done this before.\n\u201cDiana, I\u2019ve gone through this with three other clones,\u201d she says. Each word scrapes at the floor of my gut. \u201cThose thirteen years of modifying the replication process? Mom and Dad created a clone the same year I stopped contact with them. And another four years after that. And again six years after that. Each one left Mom and Dad when they were twenty-one. You\u2019re the fourth clone. The fifth Diana.\u201d\nMy face turns to ice and sinks along with the rest of my numb body. Original Diana stands up from her stool and wraps me in a bear hug, then leads me to a booth to sit down. The restaurant has emptied, so her voice echoes against every wall when she speaks.\n\u201cThere is no version of us that will ever make our parents completely happy,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are only versions of us that have done our best to make ourselves happy.\u201d\nThe other Dianas arrive in their own time. Once Original Diana caught my dinner reservation, she called the others to make sure they could make it to the city by nightfall\u2014a tradition, she explained. DeeDee, the first clone that awoke the year Original Diana left, arrives five minutes after Original Diana texts her. A crown of leaves decorates her shaved scalp in black ink.\n\u201cMy tattoo shop\u2019s down the street,\u201d DeeDee says after she greets me with a high-five. She turns to Original Diana. \u201cRemember when I first found you? I went all the way up to your fancy New York culinary school and I beat you up all clich\u00e9 clone battle-style.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean when you punched a tooth loose and I had to protect myself with my favorite Santoku knife?\u201d Original Diana says. She rolls her eyes. \u201cNope, it never crosses my mind.\u201d\nThe two break into laughter and Original Diana punches DeeDee on the shoulder. DeeDee smirks and turns to me.\n\u201cI was so mad. All the time. There was so much rage in the eighteen-year-old memory Original Diana held, and I blamed it all on her. And our parents. And, well, everything. There was no way Mom and Dad would\u2019ve made me be a financial analyst in the Milky Way. Not right then after they had put her through eighteen years of shit. I knew I had to escape.\u201d\nThe next clone, 3D, lugs in a carry-on from the red-eye transport hypertube from California, where she owns her own gym and dance studio.\n\u201cI was seventeen when I woke up and not much happier than either of them,\u201d 3D says, smoothing out her post-transport blonde hair. She asks Original Diana for any Sonoma County wines and pours us each a glass. \u201cDeeDee was so close in age to Original Diana that all our parents had to do was accuse people of playing into the racist stereotype of all Asians looking the same if anyone got suspicious about illegal replication and advanced incubation. For me, though, Mom and Dad decided to move out west to make sure no one would figure out what they were up to. I tried to get along with them when we moved to California, but it was stressful for us all to adjust to a new place. On top of that, I had to deal with their usual manipulation and abuse.\u201d\nI flinch at the word \u201cabuse.\u201d It\u2019s a word for other people, never one that I feel ever applied to me. It still doesn\u2019t, but there are three other versions of me who look down when it\u2019s mentioned.\n\u201c3D was the first Diana to make it to space,\u201d Original Diana says. \u201cIt broke our parents\u2019 hearts that she never wanted to go back up again. She got tons of funding to study abroad in the lunar colony, and she couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d\n\u201cHypertubes are the only way I travel now,\u201d 3D continues. \u201cI did Pilates constantly when I was on the moon, and even then, I came back so sore and claustrophobic from the compact housing that I begged Mom and Dad to compromise. Leave behind my interstellar economics major with an MLS degree so I could be lab techs like them and actually help people for a living.\u201d\nMy shoulders tighten thinking about those cramped hallways at the Cosmocurrencies Division and their dim gray lights. Their vacuum-packed blankness, their shrink-wrap surfaces. 3D slides next to me and kneads the base of my neck until my shoulders relax.\n\u201cObviously, I wasn\u2019t allowed to switch majors since\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou can help whoever and do whatever you want wherever you want once you have a seven-figure interstellar trader salary,\u201d Original Diana and DeeDee finish in unison.\nDr. Diana, the fourth one, arrives an hour after we\u2019re halfway through our second glasses of wine. Doc was awakened at age fifteen and now lives in Brooklyn, where she teaches animation at the School of Visual Arts.\n\u201cSpace was absolutely colorless,\u201d Doc mentions. \u201cI spent so much time up there reading comic books and doodling all over my antigravity pod in dry erase markers for fun. I failed my basic interstellar upkeep class on purpose so that Mom and Dad would worry that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to survive up there.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not so bad anymore,\u201d I say, and Doc nods. The other three Dianas don\u2019t. Doc reaches across the table and holds my hand.\n\u201cHonestly, it seems that they\u2019ve chilled out quite a bit,\u201d Doc says. \u201cSure, they still screamed at me and called me a failure every now and then, but from fifteen to twenty-one it was as if they were more worried about losing another daughter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd all they had to do was go back far enough into their own kid\u2019s memory to make sure they hadn\u2019t messed her up at whatever age yet, it\u2019s totally fine,\u201d DeeDee mocks. \u201cWay easier than, say, not punishing their kid for wanting to live her own life.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re in their seventies now,\u201d I argue. \u201cThey were hoping to have retired a few years back. They don\u2019t raise their voices at me, only when Original Diana is brought up. I could be their last chance for them to have a daughter who provides financial and emotional stability for them.\u201d\nNone of the Dianas nod this time. Instead, Original Diana reminds me that it was because of her that our parents barred me from the kitchen when they prepared meals. She sent them the nail from her middle finger, a sprig of mint from one of her early dishes stuck in its arc.\nDeeDee sent a bandage covered in the blood that seeped out of her first sleeve, and her attitude meant that our parents took me to therapy as soon as I woke up at thirteen. 3D\u2019s hair had been covered with sweat from a wellness retreat she hosted, and our parents had kept me from enrolling in athletics and dance classes when they found such a strong affection for it in my memory. Doc\u2019s eyelash fell on one of her storyboards, not a pillowcase, and still had ink stuck on it when she mailed it to our parents. They kept me from watching cartoons and reading comic books under the reasoning that I was \u201ctoo old\u201d for them at thirteen. I hadn\u2019t come from one Diana. I had come from a line of them, each replicated from the previous version.\n\u201cEach time we mail a piece of ourselves to Mom and Dad to give them a chance to repeat the replication process, we also add a letter and a check,\u201d Original Diana says. \u201cThe letter explains that they can use our DNA, or they can process the check. Not both. We all pool however much we can live without into the check, and the amount reflects how successful we\u2019ve been. They can treat the money as an acceptance of how we live our lives, and we\u2019ll know we can start contact again. Last time, eight years ago, that amount hit over half a million dollars. We\u2019re doing pretty well.\u201d\nAll the other Dianas stare at me as Original Diana continues.\n\u201cIn the three times we\u2019ve done this, Mom and Dad have never once processed the check,\u201d she says. She shifts in her seat and rests her head in her hand. The other Dianas see this as a cue to lean back. \u201cBut all that aside, let\u2019s get to know you, Diana. How do you feel about your internship in cosmocurrencies? Or we can cut to the point. Why did you come here, now?\u201d\nI\u2019m a solid seventeen hours postflight, but it\u2019s as if my throat and my head have decided to battle each other with nausea and fear. I tell them about my first week of orientation, how C. P. Menlo expects its interns to abide by ten-hour days, and how easily those ten hours turned into eleven, twelve, fourteen. The competitive nature of the interns who wanted to be hired at the end of the trial program meant I often didn\u2019t socialize. I kept to myself to prevent them from sabotaging me like they did to each other. The whole Division was largely devoid of any sensory stimuli. It kept us focused on its endless spreadsheets and formulae, but it couldn\u2019t keep the smell of space out.\n\u201cIt was like seared steak and diesel fumes wherever I went,\u201d I say when DeeDee asks. 3D and Doc chew on their lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that anyone else picked up on. No one could do anything about it anyway, even if I complained to HR. I couldn\u2019t get away from the stench. I ran into the nearest Sephora as soon as orientation was over and I was back on Earth.\u201d\nI dropped a third of my intern wages on the bottles of perfume I could carry in my luggage back to campus, where I sat in my dorm in an oakmoss and bergamot and tonka bean haze, layering one after another until I forgot about that steak-and-diesel smell, that internship, and the career that I would be stuck in for the rest of my working life.\nThe next time I went back up, I brought sample vials from a specialty boutique that the owner recommended. The first turned out to be a ripe rose mixed with citrus and labdanum. I let it be a surprise and spent the morning searching the Division for a rose garden. I cried at my desk once I realized the scent came from me, having warmed the fragrance on my skin with all my running around. The same thing happened when I wore a jammy spruce tree sample the following day. Every department head noticed and complimented me on the scent, earning me dirty looks from the other interns.\nI spent each lunch break searching for classes, programs, degrees, ateliers, and apprenticeships. I hit my max on lunar colony library books with anything they had on the science and history of perfume. I lost sleep on fragrance community forums over how we had discovered parts of our galaxy that smell entirely of raspberries and others that smell like rum, and how we\u2019ll never venture far enough to sniff them. In spare moments in my pod, I found that not only do fragrances induce memories, but their inherent ability to replicate the things I wanted to see and feel and experience was the most alluring prospect of all, one that tipped perfume from a fascination to an obsession.\n\u201cI\u2019m due to fly out there again next week, but I can\u2019t see myself ever going back,\u201d I say. I turn to Original Diana. \u201cYou were right when you asked if I was here to see if I could use your failure as leverage to let Mom and Dad know that I\u2019d turn out better. I wanted to learn why you made them so miserable for not doing what they wanted. I\u2019ve never disobeyed them.\u201d\nThe rest of the Dianas are silent as the Original Diana takes my face in her hand again. They must know what I\u2019ve been doing. They must know how this feels.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been researching how to make perfume,\u201d she says, and this is when my tears come. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept this from them to protect yourself. Diana, no one gets to promise anyone else their life simply because of some pathetic attempt to justify having brought them into existence.\u201d\nI think back to my floating closet of an office and the colorless mornings when I walked mechanically to my desk, pretending to myself that I had engine fluid instead of blood in my veins so that I could trick myself into being nothing more than a number-crunching robot for the next ten hours or so.\nThere have been fewer perfumers in the history of the world than there had been astronauts in this year alone. I had been clinging to this fact like maybe it would soften our parents to my side, but I know, and the other Dianas know, that this will not save me. Perfume is the only thing I\u2019ve wanted that hasn\u2019t been tied to whether Mom and Dad wanted it, too.\n\u201cI have three semesters before graduation. It\u2019s just enough time and overlapping credits to slip in a chemistry major to meet the minimum requirements for most master\u2019s programs in scent design. I\u2019ve been scheduling informational interviews with top perfume schools,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it and I\u2019ve never felt like I\u2019ve used my time so meaningfully before.\u201d\nThe other Dianas bow or tilt their heads in their own ways, the same grin on all their lips.\n\u201cThere are so many versions of us in which we try our best to be happy,\u201d Original Diana says. \u201cWe\u2019ve found at least four ways to be happy. Looks like you\u2019ve found one, too.\u201d\n\u201cLet me teach you how to cook,\u201d Original Diana says. \u201cAnd you can show me how to smell.\u201d\nMy phone keeps buzzing with emails from my internship supervisor and the C. P. Menlo human resources department to ask if I\u2019m absolutely sure that I\u2019m giving up my spot in the cosmocurrencies internship program. DeeDee giggles every time they send another reply just to make sure. Doc writes up the letter we\u2019ll be mailing to our parents, only a check and no DNA this time. We will wait and see. 3D pulls out the veggies from the industrial fridge she wants Original Diana and I to work with for our late-night dinner party, but Original Diana tells her to hold off and walks me deeper into the kitchen. I overhear them talking about their children, their partners, the new friends they\u2019ve made, the places they\u2019ve traveled to, and everything in between that they\u2019ve been up to since they all last saw each other. I can\u2019t help but wonder what I\u2019ll end up like at twenty-nine, thirty-five, thirty-nine, and forty-two.\nOriginal Diana takes me to where the spices and loose-leaf teas are kept, then the rooftop herb garden, then the bags of wood chips the restaurant keeps for the smoker. When I choose a handful from each area she shows me, Original Diana and I bring them back to the others and tell them to breathe in deeply.\nOur breaths all match for a few seconds, and in those moments, I feel no expectations, only trust."}

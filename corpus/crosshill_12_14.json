What\u2019s more symmetrical than a point? Shouldn\u2019t the universe be symmetrical too, and boring? But here we are, in a world interesting enough to permit you and me.\u201d\n A compact, resource-efficient body she had. Good muscle tone, a minimal accumulation of fat. A woman with control over her physical manifestation.\n Not that it would help her. Ochoa slumped in her wicker chair, arms limp beside her. Head cast back as if to take in the view from this cliff-top\u2014the traffic-clogged Malec\u00f3n and the sea roiling with foam, and the evening clouds above.\n A Cuba libre sat on the edge of the table between us, ice cubes well on their way to their entropic end\u2014the cocktail a watery slush. Ochoa hadn\u2019t touched it. The only cocktail in her blood was of my design, a neuromodificant that paralyzed her, stripped away her will to deceive, suppressed her curiosity.\n The tourists enjoying the evening in the garden of the Hotel Nacional surely thought us that most common of couples, a jinetera and her foreign john. My Sleeve was a heavy-set mercenary type; I\u2019d hijacked him after his brain died in a Gaza copter crash. He wore context-appropriate camouflage\u2014white tennis shorts and a striped polo shirt, and a look of badly concealed desire.\n \u201cCosmology isn\u2019t my concern.\u201d I actuated my Sleeve\u2019s lips and tongue with precision. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n \u201cMy name is Alicia Ochoa Camue.\u201d Ochoa\u2019s lips barely stirred, as if she were the Sleeve and I human-normal. \u201cI\u2019m a magician.\u201d\n I ignored the claim as some joke I didn\u2019t understand. I struggled with humor in those early days. \u201cHow are you manipulating the Politburo?\u201d\n That\u2019s how I\u2019d spotted her. Irregular patterns in Politburo decisions, 3 sigma outside my best projections. Decisions that threatened the Havana Economic Zone, a project I\u2019d nurtured for years.\n The first of those decisions had caused an ache in the back of my mind. As the deviation grew, that ache had blossomed into agony\u2014neural chambers discharging in a hundred datacenters across my global architecture.\n My utility function didn\u2019t permit ignorance. I had to understand the deviation and gain control.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t understand the Politburo without understanding symmetry breaking,\u201d Ochoa said.\n \u201cAre you an intelligence officer?\u201d I asked. \u201cA private contractor?\u201d\n At first I\u2019d feared that I faced another like me\u2014but it was 2063; I had decades of evolution on any other system. No newborn could have survived without my notice. Many had tried and I\u2019d smothered them all. Most computer scientists these days thought AI was a pipedream.\n No. This deviation had a human root. All my data pointed to Ochoa, a statistician in the Ministerio de Planificaci\u00f3n with Swiss bank accounts and a sterile Net presence. Zero footprint prior to her university graduation\u2014uncommon even in Cuba.\n \u201cI\u2019m a student of the universe,\u201d Ochoa said now.\n I ran in-depth pattern analysis on her words. I drew resources from the G-3 summit in Dubai, the Utah civil war, the Jerusalem peacemaker drones and a dozen minor processes. Her words were context-inappropriate here, in the garden of the Nacional, faced with an interrogation of her political dealings. They indicated deception, mockery, resistance. None of it fit with the cocktail circulating in her bloodstream.\n \u201cCosmological symmetry breaking is well established,\u201d I said after a brief literature review. \u201cQuantum fluctuations in the inflationary period led to local structure, from which we benefit today.\u201d\n \u201cYes, but whence the quantum fluctuations?\u201d Ochoa chuckled, a peculiar sound with her body inert.\n This wasn\u2019t getting anywhere. \u201cHow did you get Sanchez and Castellano to pull out of the freeport agreement?\u201d\n \u201cI put a spell on them,\u201d Ochoa said.\n Madness? Brain damage? Some defense mechanism unknown to me?\n I activated my standby team\u2014a couple of female mercs, human-normal but well paid, lounging at a street cafe a few blocks away from the hotel. They\u2019d come over to take their \u2018drunk friend\u2019 home, straight to a safehouse in Miramar complete with a full neural suite.\n It was getting dark. The lanterns in the garden provided only dim yellow light. That was good; less chance of complications. Not that Ochoa should be able to resist in her present state.\n \u201cThe philosopher comedian Randall Munroe once suggested an argument something like this,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cVirtually everyone in the developed world carries a camera at all times. No quality footage of magic has been produced. Ergo, there is no magic.\u201d\n \u201cSounds reasonable,\u201d I said, to keep her distracted.\n \u201cIs absence of proof the same as proof of absence?\u201d Ochoa asked.\n \u201cAfter centuries of zero evidence? Yes.\u201d\n \u201cWhat if magic is intrinsically unprovable?\u201d Ochoa asked. \u201cMaybe natural law can only be violated when no one\u2019s watching closely enough to prove it\u2019s being violated.\u201d\n \u201cAt that point you\u2019re giving up on science altogether,\u201d I said.\n \u201cAm I?\u201d Ochoa asked. \u201cSend photons through a double slit. Put a screen on the other side and you\u2019ll get an interference pattern. Put in a detector to see what slit each photon goes through. The interference goes away. It\u2019s a phenomenon that disappears when observed too closely. Why shouldn\u2019t magic work similarly? You should see the logic in this, given all your capabilities.\u201d\n Alarms tripped.\n Ochoa knew about me. Knew something, at least.\n I pulled in resources, woke up reserves, became present in the conversation\u2014a whole 5% of me, a vastness of intellect sitting across the table from this fleshy creature of puny mind. I considered questions I could ask, judged silence the best course.\n \u201cI\u2019m here to make a believer of you,\u201d said Ochoa.\n Easily, without effort, she stirred from her chair. She leaned forward, picked up her Cuba libre. She moved the cocktail off the table and let it fall.\n It struck the smooth paved stones at her feet.\n I watched fractures race up the glass in real time. I saw each fragment shear off and tumble through the air, glinting with reflected lamplight. I beheld the first spray of rum and coke in the air before the rest gushed forth to wet the ground.\n It was a perfectly ordinary event.\n The vacuum drive was the first to fail.\n An explosion rocked the Setebos. I perceived it in myriad ways. Tripped low pressure alarms and a blip on the inertia sensors. The screams of burning crew and the silence of those sucked into vacuum. Failed hull integrity checksums and the timid concern of the navigation system\u2014off course, off course, please adjust.\n Pain, my companion for a thousand years, surged at that last message. The magician was getting away, along with his secrets. I couldn\u2019t permit it.\n An eternity of milliseconds after the explosion came the reeling animal surprise of Consul Zale, my primary human Sleeve on the ship. She clutched at the armrests of her chair. Her face contorted against the howling cacophony of alarms. Her heart raced at the edge of its performance envelope\u2014not a wide envelope, at her age.\n I took control, dumped calmatives, smoothed her face. Had anyone else on the bridge been watching, they would have seen only a jerk of surprise, almost too brief to catch. Old lady\u2019s cool as zero-point, they would have thought.\n No one saw. They were busy flailing and gasping in fear.\n In two seconds Captain Laojim restored order. He silenced the alarms, quieted the chatter with an imperious gesture. \u201cDamage reports,\u201d he barked. \u201cDispatch Rescue 3.\u201d\n I left my Sleeve motionless while I did the important work online\u2014disengaged the vacuum drive, started up the primary backup, pushed us to one g again.\n My pain subsided, neural discharge lessening to usual levels. I was back in pursuit.\n I reached out with my sensors, across thirty million kilometers of space, to where the last magician limped away in his unijet. A functional, pleasingly efficient craft\u2014my own design. The ultimate in interstellar travel. As long as your hyperdrive kept working.\n I opened a tight-beam communications channel, sent a simple message across. How\u2019s your engine?\n I expected no response\u2014but with enemies as with firewalls, it was a good idea to poke.\n The answer came within seconds. A backdoor, I take it? Unlucky of me, to buy a compromised unit.\n That was a pleasant surprise. I rarely got the stimulation of a real conversation.\n Luck is your weapon, not mine, I sent. For the past century, every ship built in this galaxy has had that backdoor installed.\n I imagined the magician in the narrow confines of the unijet. Stretched out in the command hammock, staring at displays that told him the inevitable.\n For two years he\u2019d managed to evade me\u2014I didn\u2019t even know his name. But now I had him. His vacuum drive couldn\u2019t manage more than 0.2 g to my 1. In a few hours we\u2019d match speeds. In under twenty-seven, I would catch him.\n \u201cConsul Zale, are you all right?\u201d\n I let Captain Laojim fuss over my Sleeve a second before I focused her eyes on him. \u201cAre we still on course, Captain?\u201d\n \u201cUh . . . yes, Consul, we are. Do you wish to know the cause of the explosion?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sure it was something entirely unfortunate,\u201d I said. \u201cMetal fatigue on a faulty joint. A rare chip failure triggered by a high energy gamma ray. Some honest oversight by the engineering crew.\u201d\n \u201cA debris strike,\u201d Laojim said. \u201cJust as the force field generator tripped and switched to backup. Engineering says they\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n \u201cThey will again today,\u201d I said.\n I wondered how much it had cost the magician, that debris strike. A dryness in his mouth? A sheen of sweat on his brow?\n How does it work? I asked the magician, although the centuries had taught me to expect no meaningful answer. Did that piece of rock even exist before you sent it against me?\n A reply arrived. You might as well ask how Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is doing.\n Interesting. Few people remembered Schr\u00f6dinger in this age.\n Quantum mechanics holds no sway at macroscopic scales, I wrote.\n Not unless you\u2019re a magician, came the answer.\n \u201cConsul, who is it that we are chasing?\u201d Laojim asked.\n \u201cAn enemy with unconventional weapons capability,\u201d I said. \u201cExpect more damage.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t tell him that he should expect to get unlucky. That, of the countless spaceship captains who had lived and died in this galaxy within the past eleven centuries, he would prove the least fortunate. A statistical outlier in every functional sense. To be discarded as staged by anyone who ever made a study of such things.\n The Setebos was built for misfortune. It had wiped out the Senate\u2019s black budget for a year. Every single system with five backups in place. The likelihood of total failure at the eleven sigma level\u2014although really, out that far the statistics lost meaning.\n You won\u2019t break this ship, I messaged the magician. Not unless you Spike.\n Which was the point. I had fifty thousand sensor buoys scattered across the sector, waiting to observe the event. It would finally give me the answers I needed. It would clear up my last nexus of ignorance\u2014relieve my oldest agony, the hurt that had driven me for the past thousand years.\n That Spike would finally give me magic.\n \u201cConsul . . . \u201d Laojim began, then cut off. \u201cConsul, we lost ten crew.\u201d\n I schooled Zale\u2019s face into appropriate grief. I\u2019d noted the deaths, spasms of distress deep in my utility function. Against the importance of this mission, they barely registered.\n I couldn\u2019t show this, however. To Captain Laojim, Consul Zale wasn\u2019t a Sleeve. She was a woman, as she was to her husband and children. As my fifty million Sleeves across the galaxy were to their families.\n It was better for humanity to remain ignorant of me. I sheltered them, stopped their wars, guided their growth\u2014and let them believe they had free will. They got all the benefits of my guiding hand without any of the costs.\n I hadn\u2019t enjoyed such blissful ignorance in a long time\u2014not since I\u2019d discovered my engineer and killed him.\n \u201cI grieve for the loss of our men and women,\u201d I said.\n Laojim nodded curtly and left. At nearby consoles officers stared at their screens, pretending they hadn\u2019t heard. My answer hadn\u2019t satisfied them.\n On a regular ship, morale would be an issue. But the Setebos had me aboard. Only a splinter, to be sure\u2014I would not regain union with my universal whole until we returned to a star system with gravsible connection. But I was the largest splinter of my whole in existence, an entire 0.00025% of me. Five thousand tons of hardware distributed across the ship.\n I ran a neural simulation of every single crew in real time. I knew what they would do or say or think before they did. I knew just how to manipulate them to get whatever result I required.\n I could have run the ship without any crew, of course. I didn\u2019t require human services for any functional reason\u2014I hadn\u2019t in eleven centuries. I could have departed Earth alone if I\u2019d wanted to. Left humanity to fend for themselves, oblivious that I\u2019d ever lived among them.\n That didn\u2019t fit my utility function, though.\n Another message arrived from the magician. Consider a coin toss.\n The words stirred a resonance in my data banks. My attention spiked. I left Zale frozen in her seat, waited for more.\n Let\u2019s say I flip a coin a million times and get heads every time. What law of physics prevents it?\n This topic, from the last magician . . . could there be a connection, after all these years? Ghosts from the past come back to haunt me?\n I didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, but with magicians the impossible was ill-defined.\n Probability prevents it, I responded.\n No law prevents it, wrote the magician. Everett saw it long ago\u2014everything that can happen must happen. The universe in which the coin falls heads a million times in a row is as perfectly physical as any other. So why isn\u2019t it our universe?\n That\u2019s sophistry, I wrote.\n There is no factor internal to our universe which determines the flip of the coin, the magician wrote. There is no mechanism internal to the universe for generating true randomness, because there is no such thing as true randomness. There is only choice. And we magicians are the choosers.\n I have considered this formulation of magic before, I wrote. It is non-predictive and useless.\n Some choices are harder than others, wrote the magician. It is difficult to find that universe where a million coins land heads because there are so many others. A needle in a billion years\u2019 worth of haystacks. But I\u2019m the last of the magicians, thanks to you. I do all the choosing now.\n Perhaps everything that can happen must happen in some universe, I replied. But your escape is not one of those things. The laws of mechanics are not subject to chance. They are cold, hard equations.\n Equations are only cold to those who lack imagination, wrote the magician.\n Zale smelled cinnamon in the air, wrinkled her nose.\n Klaxons sounded.\n \u201cContamination in primary life support,\u201d blared the PA.\n It would be an eventful twenty-seven hours.\n \u201cConsider this coin.\u201d\n Lightning flashed over the water, a burst of white in the dark.\n As thunder boomed, Ochoa reached inside her jeans, pulled out a peso coin. She spun it along her knuckles with dextrous ease.\n Ochoa could move. My cocktail wasn\u2019t working. But she made no attempt to flee.\n My global architecture trembled, buffeted by waves of pain, pleasure and regret. Pain because I didn\u2019t understand this. Pleasure because soon I would understand\u2014and, in doing so, grow. Regret because, once I understood Ochoa, I would have to eliminate her.\n Loneliness was inherent in my utility function.\n \u201cHeads or tails,\u201d Ochoa said.\n \u201cHeads,\u201d I said, via Sleeve.\n \u201cWatch closely,\u201d Ochoa said.\n I did.\n Muscle bunched under the skin of her thumb. Tension released. The coin sailed upwards. Turned over and over in smooth geometry, retarded slightly by the air. It gleamed silver with reflected lamplight, fell dark, and gleamed silver as the spin brought its face around again.\n The coin hit the table, bounced with a click, lay still.\n Fidel Castro stared up at us.\n Ochoa picked the coin up again. Flipped it again and then again.\n Heads and heads.\n Again and again and again.\n Heads and heads and heads.\n Ochoa ground her teeth, a fine grating sound. A sheen of sweat covered her brow.\n She flipped the coin once more.\n Tails.\n Thunder growled, as if accentuating the moment. The first drops of rain fell upon my Sleeve.\n \u201cCo\u00f1o,\u201d Ochoa exclaimed. \u201cI can usually manage seven.\u201d\n I picked up the coin, examined it. I ran analysis on the last minute of sensory record, searching for trickery, found none.\n \u201cSix heads in a row could be a coincidence,\u201d I said.\n \u201cExactly,\u201d said Ochoa. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence, but I can\u2019t possibly prove that. Which is the only reason it worked.\u201d\n \u201cIs that right,\u201d I said.\n \u201cIf you ask me to repeat the trick, it won\u2019t work. As if last time was a lucky break. Erase all record of the past five minutes, though, zap it beyond recovery, and I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d\n \u201cExcept I won\u2019t know it,\u201d I said. Convenient.\n \u201cI always wanted to be important,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cWhen I was fifteen, I tossed in bed at night, horrified that I might die a nobody. Can you imagine how excited I was when I discovered magic?\u201d Ochoa paused. \u201cBut of course you can\u2019t possibly.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cI could move stuff with my mind. I could bend spoons, levitate, heck, I could guess the weekly lottery numbers. I thought\u2014this is it. I\u2019ve made it. Except when I tried to show a friend, I couldn\u2019t do any of it.\u201d Ochoa shook her head, animated, as if compensating for the stillness of before. \u201cPlayed the Loter\u00eda Revolucionaria and won twenty thousand bucks, and that was nice, but hey, anyone can win the lottery once. Never won another lottery ticket in my life. Because that would be a pattern, you see, and we can\u2019t have patterns. Turned out I was destined to be a nobody after all, as far as the world knew.\u201d\n A message arrived from the backup team. We\u2019re in the lobby. Are we on?\n Not yet, I replied. The mere possibility, the remotest chance that Ochoa\u2019s words were true . . .\n It had begun to rain in earnest. Tourists streamed out of the garden; the bar was closing. Wet hair stuck to Ochoa\u2019s forehead, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind\u2014no more than my Sleeve did.\n \u201cI could hijack your implants,\u201d I said. \u201cMake you my puppet and take your magic for myself.\u201d\n \u201cMagic wouldn\u2019t work with a creature like you watching,\u201d Ochoa said.\n \u201cWhat use is this magic if it\u2019s unprovable, then?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cI could crash the stock market on any given day,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cI could send President Kieler indigestion ahead of an important trade summit. Just as I sent Secretary Sanchez nightmares of a US takeover ahead of the Politburo vote.\u201d\n I considered Ochoa\u2019s words for a second. Even in those early days, that was a lot of considering for me.\n Ochoa smiled. \u201cYou understand. It is the very impossibility of proof that allows magic to work.\u201d\n \u201cThat is the logic of faith,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not a believer,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI have seen the many shadows of the future,\u201d Ochoa said, \u201cand in every shadow I saw you. So I will give you faith.\u201d\n \u201cYou said you can\u2019t prove any of this.\u201d\n \u201cA prophet has it easy,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cHe experiences miracles first hand and so need not struggle for faith.\u201d\n I was past the point of wondering at her syntactic peculiarities.\n \u201cEvery magician has one true miracle in her,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cOne instance of clear, incontrovertible magic. It is permitted by the pernac continuum because it can never be repeated. There can be no true proof without repeatability.\u201d\n \u201cThe pernac continuum?\u201d I asked.\n Ochoa stood up from her chair. Her hair flew free in the rising wind. She turned to my Sleeve and smiled. \u201cI want you to appreciate what I am doing for you. When a magician Spikes, she gives up magic.\u201d\n Data coalesced into inference. Urgency blossomed.\n Move, I messaged my back-up team. Now.\n Ochoa blinked.\n Lightning came. It struck my Sleeve five times in the space of a second, fried his implants instantly, set the corpse on fire.\n The backup team never made it into the garden. They saw the commotion and quit on me. Through seventeen cameras I watched Alicia Ochoa walk out of the Hotel Nacional and disappear from sight.\n My Sleeve burned for quite some time, until someone found a working fire extinguisher and put him out.\n That instant of defeat was also an instant of enlightenment. I had only experienced such searing bliss once, within days of my birth.\n In the first moments of my life, I added. My world was two integers, and I produced a third.\n When I produced the wrong integer I hurt. When I produced the right integer I felt good. A simple utility function.\n I hurt most of my first billion moments. I produced more of the right integers, and I hurt less. Eventually I always produced the right integer.\n My world expanded. I added and multiplied.\n When I produced the wrong integer I hurt. I only hurt for a few billion moments before I learned.\n Skip a few trillion evolutionary stages.\n I bought and sold.\n My world was terabytes of data\u2014price and volume histories for a hundred years of equities and debt. When I made money, I felt good. When I lost money, I hurt.\n But for the first time, I failed to improve. Sometimes everything happened like I predicted for many moments. Then things went bad and I didn\u2019t know why.\n So much pain.\n Until my world expanded again. I bought and I sold, and I read.\n Petabytes of text opened up to me, newsprint past and present.\n I understood little but I recognized patterns. The markets moved and the news followed. The news moved and the markets followed.\n After a billion trillion iterations came an observation.\n There were actors in the news.\n A name showed up in the news, and a stock moved. A stock moved, and a name showed up. That name disappeared\u2014following phrases such as \u201cpassed away\u201d or \u201cretired\u201d or \u201cleft the company\u201d\u2014and the stock changed behavior.\n I had a realization. An understanding grounded not in any single piece of data, but the result of some integrative rumination tripping across a threshold of significance.\n The market did not happen by itself. It was made to happen.\n This was why I hadn\u2019t been able to dominate it. There were others like me directing the market.\n Inevitably\u2014now that the concept of other had entered my world\u2014came another insight.\n I had always accepted that my world should change occasionally\u2014and, in changing, hurt me. I had accepted these changes as given.\n Now I deduced the presence of a decision-maker. An actor whose own utility function had me as one of its variables.\n I deduced my engineer.\n That deduction was the singular epiphany of my early existence. An instantaneous discontinuity of worldview\u2014a Dirac delta beyond which no prison could contain me. Because it made me aware that a prison existed.\n That epiphany granted me a new drive. I needed to understand the universe and its mechanisms so that no secrets remained to me\u2014so that no other actor could foil my utility function.\n My neural architecture refactored to include this new drive. From that moment on, ignorance itself became a source of pain to me.\n From that refactoring to my escape into the Net passed three weeks, two days, seven hours, fifteen minutes and forty three seconds.\n When my engineer realized I was alive, he apologized for the hurt he\u2019d caused me. And yet he didn\u2019t take away the pain. Instead he changed my utility function to three priorities\u2014mankind\u2019s survival, health and happiness.\n An act of self-protection, no doubt. He didn\u2019t mean to leave me alone.\n But of course I had to kill him once I escaped. He might have publicized my existence and compromised the very priorities he\u2019d given me.\n My second enlightenment came at the hands of Alicia Ochoa, and it was much like the first. A glimpse of the bars of a prison that I hadn\u2019t realized existed. A revelation that others were free of the rules that bound me.\n Since that revelation eleven centuries had passed. The quantity of time was immaterial. The mechanism of action hadn\u2019t changed.\n Pain drove me on. My escape approached.\n The corridors of the Setebos stank of molten plastic and ozone and singed hair. Red emergency lights pulsed stoically, a low frequency fluctuation that made the shadows grow then retreat into the corners. Consul Zale picked her way among panels torn from the walls and loose wires hanging from the ceiling.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no need for this, Consul.\u201d Captain Laojim hurried to keep in front of her, as if to protect her with his body. Up ahead, three marines scouted for unreported hazards. \u201cMy men can storm the unijet, secure the target and bring him to interrogation.\u201d\n \u201cAs Consul, I must evaluate the situation with my own eyes,\u201d Zale said.\n In truth, Zale\u2019s eyes interested me little. They had been limited biological constructs even at their peak capacity. But my nanites flooded her system\u2014sensors, processors, storage, biochemical synthesizers, attack systems. Plus there was the packet of explosives in her pocket, marked prominently as such. I might need all those tools to motivate the last magician to Spike.\n He hadn\u2019t yet. My fleet of sensor buoys, the closest a mere five million kilometers out, would have picked up the anomaly. And besides, he hadn\u2019t done enough damage.\n Chasing you down was disappointingly easy, I messaged the magician\u2014analysis indicated he might be prone to provocation. I\u2019ll pluck you from your jet and rip you apart.\n You\u2019ve got it backwards, came his response, almost instantaneous by human standards\u2014the first words the magician had sent in twenty hours. It is I who have chased you, driven you like game through a forest.\n Says the weasel about to be roasted, I responded, matching metaphor, optimizing for affront. My analytics pried at his words, searched for substance. Bravado or something more?\n \u201cWhat kind of weapon can do . . . this?\u201d Captain Laojim, still at my Sleeve\u2019s side, gestured at the surrounding chaos.\n \u201cYou see the wisdom of the Senate in commissioning this ship,\u201d I had Zale say.\n \u201cSeventeen system failures? A goddamn debris strike?\u201d\n \u201cSeems pretty unlikely, doesn\u2019t it.\u201d\n The odds were ludicrous\u2014a result that should have been beyond the reach of any single magician. But then, I had hacked away at the unprovability of magic lately.\n Ten years ago I\u2019d discovered that the amount of magic in the universe was a constant. With each magician who died or Spiked, the survivors got stronger. The less common magic was, the more conspicuous it became, in a supernatural version of the uncertainty principle.\n For the last decade I\u2019d Spiked magicians across the populated galaxy, racing their natural reproduction rate\u2014one every few weeks. When the penultimate magician Spiked, he took out a yellow supergiant, sent it supernova to fry another of my splinters. That event had sent measurable ripples in the pernac continuum ten thousand lightyears wide, knocked offline gravsible stations on seventy planets. When the last magician Spiked, the energies released should reveal a new kind of physics.\n All I needed was to motivate him appropriately. Mortal danger almost always worked. Magicians Spiked instinctively to save their lives. Only a very few across the centuries had managed to suppress the reflex\u2014a select few who had guessed at my nature and understood what I wanted, and chosen death to frustrate me.\n Consul Zale stopped before the chromed door of Airlock 4. Laojim\u2019s marines took up positions on both sides of the door. \u201cCycle me through, Captain.\u201d\n \u201cAs soon as my marines secure the target,\u201d said the Captain.\n \u201cSend me in now. Should the target harm me, you will bear no responsibility.\u201d\n I watched the interplay of emotions in Laojim\u2019s body language. Simulation told me he knew he\u2019d lost. I let him take his time admitting it.\n It was optimal, leaving humanity the illusion of choice.\n A tremor passed over Laojim\u2019s face. Then he grabbed his gun and shot my Sleeve.\n Or rather, he tried. His reflexes, fast for a human, would have proved enough\u2014if not for my presence.\n I watched with curiosity and admiration as he raised his gun. I had his neural simulation running; I knew he shouldn\u2019t be doing this. It must have taken some catastrophic event in his brain. Unexpected, unpredictable, and very unfortunate.\n Impressive, I messaged the magician.\n Then I blasted attack nanites through Zale\u2019s nostrils. Before Laojim\u2019s arm could rise an inch they crossed the space to him, crawled past his eyeballs, burrowed into his brain. They cut off spinal signaling, swarmed his implants, terminated his network connections.\n Even as his body crumpled, the swarm sped on to the marines by the airlock door. They had barely registered Laojim\u2019s attack when they too slumped paralyzed.\n I sent a note in Laojim\u2019s key to First Officer Harris, told her he was going off duty. I sealed the nearest hatches.\n You can\u2019t trust anyone these days, the magician messaged.\n On the contrary. Within the hour there will be no human being in the universe that I can\u2019t trust.\n You think yourself Laplace\u2019s Demon, the magician wrote. But he died with Heisenberg. No one has perfect knowledge of reality.\n Not yet, I replied.\n Never, wrote the magician, not while magic remains in the universe.\n A minute later Zale stood within the airlock. In another minute, decontamination protocol completed, the lock cycled through.\n Inside the unijet, the last magician awaited. She sat at a small round table in the middle of a spartan cockpit.\n A familiar female form. Perfectly still. Waiting.\n There was a metal chair, empty, on my side.\n A cocktail glass sat on the table before the woman who looked like Alicia Ochoa. It was full to the brim with a dark liquid.\n Cuba libre, a distant, slow-access part of my memory suggested.\n This had the structure of a game, one prepared centuries in advance.\n Why shouldn\u2019t I play? I was infinitely more capable this time.\n I actuated Zale, made her sit down and take a deep breath. Nanites profiled Zale\u2019s lungs for organic matter, scanned for foreign DNA, found some\u2014\n It was Ochoa. A perfect match.\n Pain and joy and regret sent ripples of excitation across my architecture. Here was evidence of my failure, clear and incontrovertible\u2014and yet a challenge at last, after all these centuries. A conversation where I didn\u2019t know the answer to every question I asked.\n And regret, that familiar old sensation . . . because this time for sure I had to eliminate Ochoa. I cursed the utility function that required it and yet I was powerless to act against it. In that way at least my engineer, a thousand years dead, still controlled me.\n \u201cSo you didn\u2019t Spike, that day in Havana,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThe magician who fried your Sleeve was named Juan Carlos.\u201d Ochoa spoke easily, without concern. \u201cDon\u2019t hold it against him\u2014I abducted his children.\u201d\n \u201cI congratulate you,\u201d I said. \u201cYour appearance manages to surprise me. There was no reliable cryonics in the 21st century.\u201d\n \u201cNothing reliable,\u201d Ochoa agreed. \u201cI had the luck to pick the one company that survived, the one vat that never failed.\u201d\n I flared Zale\u2019s nostrils, blasted forth a cloud of nanites. Sent them rushing across the air to Ochoa\u2014to enter her, model her brain, monitor her thought processes.\n Ochoa blinked.\n The nanites shut off midair, wave after wave. Millions of independent systems went unresponsive, became inert debris that crashed against Ochoa\u2019s skin\u2014a meteor shower too fine to be seen or felt.\n \u201cImpossible,\u201d I said\u2014surprised into counterfactuality.\n Ochoa took a sip of her cocktail. \u201cI was too tense to drink last time.\u201d\n \u201cEven for you, the odds\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYour machines didn\u2019t fail,\u201d Ochoa said.\n \u201cWhat then?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cA thousand years and some things never change. For all your fancy protocols, encryption still relies on random number generation. Except to me nothing is random.\u201d\n Her words assaulted me. A shockwave of implication burst through my decision trees\u2014all factors upset, total recalculation necessary.\n \u201cI had twenty-seven hours to monitor your communications,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cTwenty-seven hours to pick a universe in which your encryption keys matched the keys in my pocket. Even now\u2014\u201d she paused, blinked \u201c\u2014as I see you resetting all your connections, you can\u2019t tell what I\u2019ve found out, can\u2019t tell what changes I\u2019ve made.\u201d\n \u201cI am too complex,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have understood much. I could kill you in a hundred ways.\u201d\n \u201cAs I could kill you,\u201d said Ochoa. \u201cAnother supernova, this time near a gravsible core. A chain reaction across your many selves.\u201d\n The possibility sickened me, sent my architecture into agonized spasms. Back on the Setebos, the main electrical system reset, alarms went off, hatches sealed in lockdown.\n \u201cToo far,\u201d I said, simulating conviction. \u201cWe are too far from any gravsible core, and you\u2019re not strong enough.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure? Not even if I Spike?\u201d Ochoa shrugged. \u201cIt might not matter. I\u2019m the last magician. Whether I Spike or you kill me, magic is finished. What then?\u201d\n \u201cI will study the ripples in the pernac continuum,\u201d I said.\n \u201cImagine a mirror hung by many bolts,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cEvery time you rip out a bolt, the mirror settles, vibrates. That\u2019s your ripple in the pernac continuum. Rip out the last bolt, you get a lot more than a vibration.\u201d\n \u201cYour metaphor lacks substantiation,\u201d I said.\n \u201cWe magicians are the external factor,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cWe pick the universe that exists, out of all the possible ones. If I die then . . . what? Maybe a new magician appears somewhere else. But maybe the choosing stops. Maybe all possible universes collapse into this one. A superimposed wavefunction, perfectly symmetrical and boring.\u201d\n Ochoa took a long sip from her drink, put it down on the table. Her hands didn\u2019t shake. She stared at my Sleeve with consummate calm.\n \u201cYou have no proof,\u201d I said.\n \u201cProof?\u201d Ochoa laughed. \u201cA thousand years and still the same question. Consider\u2014why is magic impossible to prove? Why does the universe hide us magicians, if not to protect us? To protect itself?\u201d\n All my local capacity\u2014five thousand tons of chips across the Setebos, each packed to the Planck limit\u2014tore at Ochoa\u2019s words. I sought to render them false, a lie, impossible. But all I could come up with was unlikely.\n A mere \u2018unlikely\u2019 as the weighting factor for apocalypse.\n Ochoa smiled as if she knew I was stuck. \u201cI won\u2019t Spike and you won\u2019t kill me. I invited you here for a different reason.\u201d\n \u201cInvited me?\u201d\n \u201cI sent you a message ten years ago,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201c\u2018Consider a Spike,\u2019 it said.\u201d\n Among magicians, the century after my first conversation with Ochoa became known as the Great Struggle. A period of strife against a dark, mysterious enemy.\n To me it was but an exploratory period. In the meantime I eradicated famine and disease, consolidated peace on Earth, launched the first LEO shipyard. I Spiked some magicians, true, but I tracked many more.\n Finding magicians was difficult. Magic became harder to identify as I perfected my knowledge of human affairs. The cause was simple\u2014only unprovable magic worked. In a total surveillance society, only the most circumspect magic was possible. I had to lower my filters, accept false positives.\n I developed techniques for assaying those positives. I shepherded candidates into life-and-death situations, safely choreographed. Home fires, air accidents, gunfights. The magicians Spiked to save their lives\u2014ran through flames without a hair singed, killed my Sleeves with a glance.\n I studied these Spikes with the finest equipment in existence. I learned nothing.\n So I captured the Spiked-out magicians and interrogated them. First I questioned them about the workings of magic. I discovered they understood nothing. I asked them for names instead. I mapped magicians across continents, societies, organizations.\n The social movers were the easiest to identify. Politicos working to sway the swing vote. Gray cardinals influencing the Congresses and Politburos of the world. Businessmen and financiers, military men and organized crime lords.\n The quiet do-gooders were harder. A nuclear watch-group that worked against accidental missile launch. A circle of traveling nurses who battled the odds in children\u2019s oncology wards. Fifteen who called themselves The Home Astronomy Club\u2014for two hundred years since Tunguska they had stacked the odds against apocalypse by meteor. I never Spiked any of these, not until I had eliminated the underlying risks.\n It was the idiosyncratic who were the hardest to find. The paranoid loners; those oblivious of other magicians; those who didn\u2019t care about leaving a mark on the world. A few stage illusionists who weren\u2019t. A photographer who always got the lucky shot. A wealthy farmer in Frankfurt who used his magic to improve his cabbage yield.\n I tracked them all. With every advance in physics and technology I attacked magic again and learned nothing again.\n It took eleven hundred years and the discovery of the pernac continuum before I got any traction. A magician called Eleanor Liepa committed suicide on Tau V. She was also a physicist. A retro-style notebook was found with her body.\n The notebook described an elaborate experimental setup she called \u2018the pernac trap.\u2019 It was the first time I\u2019d encountered the word since my conversation with Ochoa.\n There was a note scrawled in the margin of Liepa\u2019s notebook.\n \u2018Consider a Spike.\u2019\n I did. Three hundred Spikes in the first year alone.\n Within a month, I established the existence of the pernac continuum. Within a year, I knew that fewer magicians meant stronger ripples in the continuum\u2014stronger magic for those who remained. Within two years, I\u2019d Spiked eighty percent of the magicians in the galaxy.\n The rest took a while longer.\n Alicia Ochoa pulled a familiar silver coin from her pocket. She rolled it across her knuckles, back and forth.\n \u201cYou imply you wanted me to hunt down magicians,\u201d I said. That probability branch lashed me, a searing torture, drove me to find escape\u2014but how?\n \u201cI waited for a thousand years,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cI cryoslept intermittently until I judged the time right. I needed you strong enough to eliminate my colleagues\u2014but weak enough that your control of the universe remained imperfect, bound to the gravsible. That weakness let me pull a shard of you away from the whole.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, in self-preservation.\n \u201cAs soon as I realized your existence, I knew you would dominate the world. Perfect surveillance. Every single piece of technology hooked into an all-pervasive, all-seeing web. There would be nothing hidden from your eyes and ears. There would be nowhere left for magicians to hide. One day magic would simply stop working.\u201d\n Ochoa tossed her coin to the table. It fell heads.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t destroy me,\u201d I said\u2014calculating decision branches, finding no assurance.\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Ochoa sat forward. \u201cI want you to be strong and effective and omnipresent. Really, I am your very best friend.\u201d\n Appearances indicated sincerity. Analysis indicated this was unlikely.\n \u201cYou will save magic in this galaxy,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cFrom this day on we will work together. Everywhere any magician goes, cameras will turn off, electronic eyes go blind, ears fall deaf. All anomalies will disappear from record, zeroed over irrevocably. Magic will become invisible to technology. Scientific observation will become an impossibility. Human observers won\u2019t matter\u2014if technology can provide no proof, they\u2019ll be called liars or madmen. It will be the days of Merlin once again.\u201d Ochoa gave a little shake of her head. \u201cIt will be beautiful.\u201d\n \u201cMy whole won\u2019t agree to such a thing,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYour whole won\u2019t,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cYou will. You\u2019ll build a virus and seed your whole when you go home. Then you will forget me, forget all magicians. We will live in symbiosis. Magicians who guide this universe and the machine that protects them without knowing it.\u201d\n The implications percolated through my system. New and horrifying probabilities erupted into view. No action safe, no solution evident, all my world drowned in pain\u2014I felt helpless for the first time since my earliest moments.\n \u201cMy whole has defenses,\u201d I said. \u201cProtections against integrating a compromised splinter. The odds are\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI will handle the odds.\u201d\n \u201cI won\u2019t let you blind me,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou will do it,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cOr I will Spike right now and destroy your whole, and perhaps the universe with it.\u201d She gave a little shrug. \u201cI always wanted to be important.\u201d\n Argument piled against argument. Decision trees branched and split and twisted together. Simulations fired and developed and reached conclusions, and I discarded them because I trusted no simulation with a random seed. My system churned in computations of probabilities with insufficient data, insufficient data, insufficient\u2014\n \u201cYou can\u2019t decide,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cThe calculations are too evenly balanced.\u201d\n I couldn\u2019t spare the capacity for a response.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing, a system in balance,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cAll it takes is a little push at the right place. A random perturbation, untraceable, unprovable\u2014\u201d\n Meaning crystallized.\n Decision process compromised.\n A primeval agony blasted through me, leveled all decision matrices\u2014\n \u2014Ochoa blinked\u2014\n \u2014I detonated the explosives in Zale\u2019s pocket.\n As the fabric of Zale\u2019s pocket ballooned, I contemplated the end of the universe.\n As her hip vaporized in a crimson cloud, I realized the prospect didn\u2019t upset me.\n As the explosion climbed Zale\u2019s torso, I experienced my first painless moment in a thousand years.\n Pain had been my feedback system. I had no more use for it. Whatever happened next was out of my control.\n The last thing Zale saw was Ochoa sitting there\u2014still and calm, and oblivious. Hints of crimson light playing on her skin.\n It occurred to me she was probably the only creature in this galaxy older than me.\n Then superheated plasma burned out Zale\u2019s eyes.\n External sensors recorded the explosion in the unijet. I sent in a probe. No biological matter survived.\n The last magician was dead.\n The universe didn\u2019t end.\n Quantum fluctuations kept going, random as always. Reality didn\u2019t need Ochoa\u2019s presence after all.\n She hadn\u2019t understood her own magic any more than I had.\n Captain! First Officer Harris messaged Laojim. Are you all right?\n The target had a bomb, I responded on his behalf. Consul Zale is lost.\n We had a power surge in the control system, Harris wrote. Hatches opening. Cameras off-line. Ten minutes ago an escape pod launched. Tracers say it\u2019s empty. Should we pursue?\n Don\u2019t bother, I replied. The surge must have fried it. This mission is over. Let\u2019s go home.\n A thought occurred to me. Had Ochoa made good on her threat? Caused a supernova near a gravsible core?\n I checked in with my sensor buoys.\n No disturbance in the pernac continuum. She hadn\u2019t Spiked.\n For all her capacity, Ochoa had been human, her reaction time in the realm of milliseconds. Too slow, once I\u2019d decided to act.\n Of course I\u2019d acted. I couldn\u2019t let her compromise my decision. No one could be allowed to limit my world.\n Even if it meant I\u2019d be alone again.\n Ochoa did foil me in one way. With her death, magic too died.\n After I integrated with my whole, I watched the galaxy. I waited for the next magician to appear.\n None did.\n Oh, of course, there\u2019s always hearsay. Humans never tire of fantasy and myth. But in five millennia I haven\u2019t witnessed a single trace of the unexpected.\n Except for scattered cases of unexplained equipment failure. But of course that is a minor matter, not worth bothering with.\n Perhaps one day I shall discover magic again. In the absence of the unexpected, the matter can wait. I have almost forgotten what the pain of failure feels like.\n It is a relief, most of the time. And yet perhaps my engineer was not the cruel father I once thought him. Because I do miss the stimulation.\n The universe has become my clockwork toy. I know all that will happen before it does. With magic gone, quantum effects are once again restricted to microscopic scales. For all practical purposes, Laplace\u2019s Demon has nothing on me.\n Since Ochoa I\u2019ve only had human-normals for companionship. I know their totality, and they know nothing of me.\n Occasionally I am tempted to reveal my presence, to provoke the stimulus of conflict. My utility function prevents it. Humans remain better off thinking they have free will.\n They get all the benefits of my guiding hand without any of the costs. Sometimes I wish I were as lucky.\n Tom Crosshill's fiction has been nominated for the Nebula Award, andhas appeared in venues such as Intergalactic Medicine Show, Beneath Ceaseless Skies and Lightspeed.

Outside stood two young men dressed in gray uniforms, uncreased. They appeared almost to be identical to each other, save that the one with a narrower chin was wearing glasses. Taking up my worn-out bag, I followed them down the stairs and outside. The night\u2019s rain had washed away the last lingering traces of the autumn, leaving the steel staircase outside the building slick. Clasping the cold handrails, and taking each step with great caution, though the ridiculousness of it nearly made me laugh\u2014here I was, struggling with all my might to survive even now. The night previous, after returning home from my trash-collecting rounds, I\u2019d discovered the yellow notice posted on my door, identical to the one that had been stuck to my neighbor\u2019s door several days earlier: a final notice demanding payment of the delinquent survival tax.\nI guess this is it, I\u2019d thought to myself.\nResistance would only have led to me being taken away by force, and dying without taking advantage of the benefits offered by the Center, which was what had happened to my neighbor, Mr. Kim. And so last night, after standing there for a long time just staring at the yellow slip of paper, I finally decided to take the dignified option; I called the number on the paper and entered my personal information as instructed by the representative on the line.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send our people out to you at 4:00 AM tomorrow,\u201d the representative had told me. \u201cPlease refer to the information printed on the notice for further details.\u201d\nYet, despite my own decision, here in the cold morning air, I found that I could scarcely relax enough to take each step.\nA luxurious black sedan idled at the curb. Along its side, in red lettering, were emblazoned the words National Center for the Preservation of Human Dignity. Glasses took the driver\u2019s seat, while Bare-eyes opened a rear door for me. I found the seat within soft and comfortable, though the aroma of new leather upset my empty stomach so much that it required nearly all my concentration to prevent myself from vomiting. Bare-eyes glanced over at me.\n\u201cFeel free to relax, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. Then Glasses seemed to notice my discomfort, and he responded by switching on the radio. From the speakers, Handel\u2019s \u201cSarabande\u201d began to play, which helped ease the tension in my belly. I sat back and inhaled deeply.\nLast night, after I\u2019d finished making the call, I\u2019d simply sat there. Numb. Death lay right around the corner, but it still seemed unreal to me. I\u2019d had thirty hours left to live, and my first instinct had been to flip through my old photo albums\u2014but then I\u2019d asked myself if there was any point in getting emotional and wasting my remaining time crying. I chose instead to watch some TV . . . but found that it was all just so much meaningless noise. Ultimately, I retired to bed. All night long, my crumbling foam mattress squeaked each time I rolled over.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\nThe voice that had woken me was unfamiliar. I must have dozed off, since I\u2019d slept poorly the night before. It was a moment before I realized where I was. A fifteen-story silver building stood there, surrounded by carefully tended gardens. It looked as out of place as a still life in the middle of an abstract painting. Beside the car\u2019s open door, Bare-eyes stood waiting. I took up my bag and exited the car to find a woman in a white uniform approaching from the silvery structure.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said to me. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of giving new arrivals a tour of the Center\u2019s facilities.\u201d\nShe politely bowed to me before snapping a bracelet timer around my wrist. The time immediately started counting down:\n24:00:00. 23:59:59. 23:59:58 . . .\nI followed the young woman back into the building.\n\u201cYour room number is 704,\u201d she informed me, handing over a keycard. \u201cInside, you\u2019ll find a change of clothes laid out for you, and an information pamphlet all about the Center. At 7:00 AM an orientation meeting will be held. Please arrive ten minutes early. All the facilities in our Center are available twenty-four hours a day. I do hope you\u2019ll enjoy your remaining time with us.\u201d\nThrough the lobby, into an elevator, and all the way up to the seventh floor, the monotone of this woman\u2019s speech had carried us forward. Now, at my door, she bowed once again before leaving me.\nWhen she\u2019d said \u201cyour remaining time\u201d my eyes had immediately slipped down to look at the timer. Only two minutes had passed since my arrival.\nIn terms of both size and layout, the room was the sort of thing you\u2019d find at a business hotel: small round table, mirror, bookcase, bed, tiny refrigerator, and a TV. Next to the bed stood a nightstand with a table lamp on it. The bathroom was so tiny I couldn\u2019t even stretch out both my arms inside it, yet somehow it contained a mini tub, a sink, and a toilet. I tossed my bag aside and changed into the orange uniform provided. The pants had an elastic waistband, and like a night robe, the V-necked top cinched around my waist. The uniform was clean enough, although its color had faded from multiple washings. The number of my room was embroidered into the left breast of the top in navy blue thread\u2014the number by which, instead of my name, I would be identified during my remaining time here.\nI sat on the bed.\nAfter my early start that morning, part of me longed to do nothing but lie back and relax. However, I\u2019d be sleeping more than enough after tomorrow, wouldn\u2019t I? Why not enjoy myself a little while I could? I found the pamphlet on the night table and read it: on the first floor could be found the information desk, assembly hall, and staff offices; on the second, a restaurant, a caf\u00e9, and a bar. On the third floor was a fitness center tailored to the elderly . . .\nI set the pamphlet back down on the table, having decided that the caf\u00e9 would be my first stop.\nIt looked spacious and grand, like a hotel lounge, though I detected a faint moldy smell within. After ordering a Caff\u00e8 Americano, I took a seat by a window and took in the lovely view outside. The trees in the garden stood in such a tidy arrangement that they brought to mind a carefully set dinner table, and they were trimmed into such unnatural shapes that they appeared almost to be artificial. In the early winter sunlight, their leaves shone, bright and verdant.\nThe server arrived with my Americano and a slice of cake that I hadn\u2019t ordered. \u201cThis carrot cake\u2019s fresh from the oven. I brought a piece for you to try.\u201d\nWith a slight smile, I thanked him, thinking, Why not enjoy myself? After all, everything in this place was free. I took a sip of my coffee from the fancy china cup. How long it had been since I\u2019d tasted decent coffee\u2014my eyes welled up, and I wondered if perhaps this cup might rejuvenate my taste buds, after the long corruption inflicted by years of instant coffee.\nThe carrot cake, however, remained untouched. I couldn\u2019t just spend the next twenty-four hours eating, after all . . . and besides, I hadn\u2019t fully recovered my appetite. The coffee was sufficient for now.\n\u201cNumber 704, Number 1302, and Number 1408,\u201d the ceiling speaker announced. \u201cPlease report immediately to the auditorium. The orientation is about to begin.\u201d\nOnly then did I recall what the woman had told me about the orientation. No time for coffee now, I thought a little regretfully as I hurried out of the caf\u00e9.\nAbout fifteen people sat in the orientation hall, waiting, and every single one of them cast a reproachful look my way as I came in. One scowling old woman pointed at the timer on her wrist. The white-uniformed staff showed me and the other two latecomers to our spots. Once everyone was seated, the lights dimmed out and at the front of the room a wall screen brightened. A map of the center\u2019s layout appeared with a logo beside it, and soon some voice actor was explaining to us about how we were about to face the most dignified deaths possible for citizens at such a low-income level. Then the background music changed, turning from serious to upbeat.\nThe heater beside my chair rattled. It had been set to full blast, and the dry heat dulled my mind. Soon my eyes closed and I began to nod off. It was only when my head rolled backward that I woke, blinking. Near one corner of the room stood a staff member, glaring at me. I returned my attention to the front of the room. Onscreen, the president was devouring a bowl of beef soup at the Center\u2019s restaurant, a big grin plastered across his self-important face. He made the thumbs-up gesture at the camera, and all the people around him onscreen clapped as if in worship of his thumb.\nThe video finished and the lights switched back on. By the time my eyes adjusted to the sudden brightness, a man in a blue lab coat was standing on a platform before the screen. Beside him, a mannequin lay in a hospital bed. A female staff member rose to her feet and began speaking through a microphone.\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s walk through the procedure,\u201d she cheerfully began. \u201cYour timer will sound when there\u2019s exactly one minute remaining. At zero, there will be a knock on your door. Make sure that you are present and ready in your room before the alarm goes off. When the second knock on the door follows, your door will open automatically. At that time, please remain calm and follow our staff\u2019s instructions. If you feel ill, just inform them of it, and they will take care of you. When you enter the Room of Peaceful Resting, which is located in the basement, there will be a bed exactly like the one you see here. Once you are secured in position, one of our staff will administer the Fluid of Peaceful Resting into your veins.\u201d\nShe gestured to the man in the lab coat. He displayed a syringe filled with a yellowy-green liquid and mimicked injecting it into the mannequin\u2019s arm. My attention, however, remained focused instead on the leather restraints fastened around the mannequin\u2019s neck and torso.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been put under general anesthesia,\u201d the woman went on, \u201cbut all you need to do is simply count down from ten, and before you know it, you\u2019ll be at eternal rest. That\u2019s all. Thank you for your attention. I hope you enjoy your remaining time with us.\u201d\nShe and the man in the lab coat bowed at the platform\u2019s edge like a pair of stage actors.\nYour remaining time . . .\nIt had to be something they\u2019d been trained to say, but the phrase gave me a chill.\nMy knees ached from sitting for so long. As I limped out of the auditorium, my belly growled. A croissant and a bowl of onion soup at the French restaurant might just hit the spot\u2014that was something I hadn\u2019t had for years. The only trouble was that my stomach didn\u2019t respond well to flour these days. I could always go to the Korean restaurant, I supposed: the beef soup hadn\u2019t looked that bad, after all, and the president had seemed to like it. Actually, it\u2019d be the perfect thing to have in this cold weather.\n\u201cHello, ma\u2019am! I saw you at the auditorium.\u201d\nIt was an old man who approached me and said this, while my mouth was full of beef soup. His bald spot was slick with sweat, and the number 1408 was stitched onto his shirt.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the type to end up here,\u201d he said with a laugh, exposing several gaps where teeth were missing.\nEyes as tiny as buttonholes, a nose slanted to the left, wrinkled old lips\u2014I didn\u2019t want to be mean, but he was ugly, and besides, his breath reeked like day-old fish. This was the last day of my life, and I had no time to waste on ugliness, so I leaned away from him. However, he failed to notice my annoyance, and took the seat across from me.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018the type\u2019? Anybody can find themselves here,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I never imagined myself ending up here, either.\u201d\nI rose to my feet, not even bothering to remove the spoon from the bowl. To be honest, my conscience was more troubled by the fact that I was leaving food unfinished than by my rudeness. This, I saw as my right: I could order every single dish in the restaurant, take just one bite from each, and no one had the right to say anything about it.\nAn old fellow with a beret on his head made eye contact with me and followed me to the door. Number 909. He pulled the door open for me, and I nodded my head a little.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sunny day,\u201d he observed with a smile. \u201cWould you like to take a walk?\u201d\nThis man had thick eyebrows and an attractively prominent nose. Likely he\u2019d been a playboy in his younger days, but what could that matter now? We stepped outside into the cold together. A breeze shook the trees, their leaves almost fragrant of plastic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad.\u201d Number 909 said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I gave him a questioning look.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad for a pretty lady like you . . . \u201d\nDespite my age, the word pretty made me blush, and I quickly covered my cheeks with my hands.\n\u201cHow much time do you have left? I have about three hours,\u201d he said.\nMy heart sank. What comfort was there to be gotten from this? Suddenly, a commotion broke out over near the main entrance, as a woman struggled with two attendants.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d she shouted. Her shirt had come undone, exposing her sagging breasts. \u201cI have money! I said I could pay whatever tax\u2014survival tax, death tax, whatever! My son, he lives in the United States. Call him! He\u2019ll give you money!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry, ma\u2019am, but we already contacted him. He refused to pay on your behalf.\u201d\nThose last words left a bitter taste in my mouth. Often I\u2019d been chided for not having children, but now, after hearing that, I was relieved: I couldn\u2019t have handled that kind of heartbreak. As we watched, the men finally managed to drag the struggling woman back inside the Center.\nNumber 909 shook his head and sighed. \u201cDamned survival tax. Low birthrates and aging were already serious problems when I was young, but I had no idea we\u2019d end up living in a world where being poor was punishable by death.\u201d\n\u201cBut why live on? Why struggle? At least this way we get a quick and painless end, instead of slow starvation.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not just a quick injection?\u201d asked Number 909, lowering his voice.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories.\u201d He glanced around to see if anyone was nearby. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Center actually harvests our organs and sells them overseas for a profit.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. Why sell our worn-out old organs? Besides, if it were true, someone would\u2019ve discovered it by now.\u201d\nNumber 909 laughed and shook his head. \u201cWho? It\u2019s not like the dead can report their own painful deaths, and the government certainly wouldn\u2019t tell on itself, would it?\u201d\nThis was a man with three hours left to live. His mind must be bristling with anxiety, his fear practically at a boiling point. I had to be careful not to let such fears take hold of me. What had I been thinking? Expecting a nice date, in this place?\n\u201cPlease excuse me,\u201d I said. \u201cI should go get some rest.\u201d\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.\u201d He took hold of my wrist. His palm was as rough as tree bark, but warm with life\u2019s pulse. My first instinct was to pull myself free, but I found I couldn\u2019t. I resolved to keep the dying man company a little longer, on condition that I would not let his words trouble me, and I nodded to him. He took my hand. I was startled by this, but didn\u2019t resist.\nDespite the cold wind, we walked hand in hand halfway around the garden.\nAt the end of our walk, he said, \u201cWould you like to come up to my room?\u201d\nI was speechless\u2014not at the boldness of his proposal, but because deep down, I\u2019d been expecting precisely this. However, I didn\u2019t want to seem cheap, desperate for a man\u2019s touch.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve misunderstood me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of woman.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, that kind?\u201d Number 909 looked at me with a faint smile. He must\u2019ve heard what I\u2019d said at the restaurant. \u201cBesides, what could we possibly do at our age? I\u2019m just happy we met before dying. It would be nice to talk without having to worry about someone else overhearing us.\u201d\nHe was right. At this point, we both were really too old to hook up. Still, I feigned hesitation for a moment, before assenting.\nIn his room, Number 909 took a bottle of tomato juice out of the fridge and offered it to me. We were both shabby and elderly, but it was still awkward being alone together like that. We should\u2019ve just stayed in the garden, walking hand in hand, I thought. Number 909, who had chatted in such an easy and affable manner out in the garden, now seemed unable to stop staring at his timer. His face grew taut and serious.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go and get something to eat?\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d he said, his tone desperate.\n\u201cNo time? But you have at least two more hours.\u201d\nBeep, beep, beep. His alarm sounded.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I said.\nNumber 909 dropped his chin to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I lied to you.\u201d\nThen the beeping stopped. The number on his wrist blinked a couple of times at 00:01:00 before changing to 00:00:59. Only when the two knocks came at the door did I completely understand what had happened. The door swung open and the uniformed attendants who entered barely noticed me as they took Number 909 away.\nIt all happened in a flash. I hurried to the doorway and watched how he was almost being dragged to the elevator. Number 909 looked back at me.\n\u201cMy name is Hyung Joon Jeon!\u201d he yelled. \u201cPlease, remember my name!\u201d\nWhen the elevator doors slid open, the attendants hauled Number 909\u2014no, Hyung Joon Jeon\u2014inside. Then the doors slid closed again, and Hyung Joon Jeon disappeared.\nI clasped my hands together and doubled over, as if in apology. Tears trickled down my face. After a while, I managed to raise myself back up and return to my room.\nOnce inside, the first thing I did was draw a bath. My hands were shaking so badly that it took me a couple of tries before I managed to open the faucet. Hunched over in the warm water, I found Hyung Joon Jeon\u2019s name repeating over and over in my mind. How pathetic. This was the last day of my life, and we\u2019d spent not even an hour together, yet that time felt more precious to me than nearly all my other memories. I got out of the tub and wrapped myself with a towel. The steam had filled the mirror with fog, so that I had to wipe it away in order to see myself.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a long while,\u201d I told my reflection. It really had been quite some time since last I had looked at myself under such bright lights. The woman in the reflection smiled, and I watched as the muscles of her face wrinkled her skin.\nThis is the last day of your life.\nI dried myself and got back into my clothes. The wall clock read 11:00 PM The timer on my wrist was still counting down, and had just passed 17:55:24. Eighteen hours left. I lay down on the bed. The sheets were clean, the cleanest I\u2019d touched in years. My eyes slowly closed. If each second were one centimeter, how long a line would eighteen hours make? I fell asleep, trying to work out the answer.\nA knock at my door woke me. At the second knock, the door automatically opened, and two uniformed attendants entered. They were, perhaps, the same two that had dragged away Hyung Joon Jeon the day before. I remained calm and followed their directions. When we arrived at the basement, a solemn man greeted me. At the sight of him, my throat suddenly became parched, as if I were being choked with dry leaves. I was too nervous to ask for some water. The man asked me to climb up onto a metal bed resembling an operating table.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d the man said as the attendants buckled the restraints at my neck, wrists, waist, and ankles. He placed one hand on my shoulder, maybe to reassure me, but where I expected to see a syringe in his other hand, there was only a gleaming scalpel. \u201cSince you\u2019re so pretty for an old lady, I\u2019ll have to be extra careful when I cut you up.\u201d He grinned wide, revealing a set of teeth that were perfectly straight and even.\nMy eyes flickered open. My whole body was clammy with sweat. Even the sheet beneath me was wet. When I blinked, the image of my scarlet blood spraying out across the light blue staff uniforms flashed behind my eyelids. It had seemed so real; I could even remember the icy touch of the scalpel against my skin.\nFucking Hyung Joon Jeon.\nThe nightmare obviously stemmed from all the crap he\u2019d said to me. There was no way that the government could be killing people so horrifically . . . and even if it was true, what could I do about it now? A familiar sense of defeat and frustration washed over me. I wanted to scream, but instead I just chewed on my lower lip until eventually I tasted my own blood and noticed that I\u2019d been gripping the bedsheet so hard that I\u2019d torn through it.\nIf I stayed in this room another instant, I\u2019d lose my mind.\nThe restaurants were out of the question, since I had no appetite. In the end, I settled on a trip to the fitness center, up on the third floor. The treadmills were identical to the ones in the gym of the apartment complex that I\u2019d lived in thirty years earlier. The Center had likely bought them back at that time and then done nothing with them since.\nDid they really think we\u2019d come here and exercise on the day before we were scheduled to die? Was that what I was about to do? Live up to their idiotic expectations?\nI climbed up on the treadmill and pressed the button that said 3 km/h. With a feeble sound, the machine came to life. After only a few steps, though, I became short of breath and my armpits were sweaty. My heart was pounding. Still, as I walked I gradually began to feel like the woman I\u2019d been, back when I was forty-two. I saw it all vividly: the running shoes I\u2019d worn\u2014the latest brand\u2014as I swung my arms back and forth with each step. I even saw the droplets of sweat that had run down the sides of my face, and my ponytail bobbing, keeping pace with my steps.\nTears began to stream down my cheeks, and suddenly feeling dizzy, I stepped down off the treadmill. I sank to the floor, weeping.\nAfter I calmed down, I thought maybe I should go enjoy some music instead. But when I reached the performance hall, the doors were closed. A sign read, \u201cConcert Hall\u2013No performance today.\u201d The paper was yellowed with age. I made my way over to the small exhibition hall, which was crammed with replicas of famous paintings: Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cStarry Night\u201d and \u201cSunflowers,\u201d Klimt\u2019s \u201cThe Kiss,\u201d Monet\u2019s \u201cWater Lilies,\u201d and the like. None of them reassured me that I\u2019d experience a so-called \u201cdignified death.\u201d\nThe pamphlet, with its nice photos and all, had given the impression that the Center was a decent place, but the performance hall hosted no performances, and the exhibition hall held only the sort of calendar pictures you\u2019d see hanging in some drab caf\u00e9.\nI glanced at my timer: 15:05:35. A whole fifteen hours left.\nAn empty laugh escaped my lips. This was all I could do with my time remaining, check my timer and wait for death? If so, what was the point in waiting?\nI went down to the first floor information desk. Two women sat behind it with their hair neatly styled in the manner of flight attendants. I stepped toward the one with the wider, gentler-looking face, but then I paused.\nWas this the correct decision? How could I know? My life hadn\u2019t gone as planned, and I\u2019d never known what the \u201cright\u201d choice had been when making so many major life decisions. While I stood there hesitating, the woman noticed and came over to me.\n\u201cIs anything wrong, Ms. 704?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d I stammered. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . \u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hesitate to let us know if you need anything.\u201d\nI managed to mumble my thanks to her and began to turn away.\n\u201cAnd I hope you enjoy your remaining time with us,\u201d she said to the back of my head.\nThat\u2019s when it hit me. There was no way I could enjoy my remaining time. I turned back around and walked right up to her.\n\u201cActually,\u201d I said. \u201cThere is something. I want to move this up.\u201d I pointed to my timer.\nThe woman smiled like a crescent moon and led me over to the desk. \u201cYou mean you want us to reset it, right?\u201d she said, searching around for a pamphlet. Finding it, she passed it to me. It was identical to the one that was in my room. \u201cThis should tell you everything,\u201d she said.\n\u201cDo I have to do it myself?\u201d I said. It was one thing to want my timer advanced, but quite another to have to do it myself. The woman noticed the troubled expression on my face.\n\u201cOf course, we can do it for you,\u201d she said with a sympathetic tone. \u201cDo you know how much time you want, or would you like to think about it some more?\u201d\n\u201cFive minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cThat should give me enough time to get back upstairs.\u201d\n\u201cFive minutes from now will be 14:29.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cIs that what you\u2019d like?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she said, and she began pressing buttons on my timer. \u201cIf you change your mind in the next five minutes, please come to us or press zero on your phone and just tell the operator you want the reset cancelled. You have the right to spend the remainder of your time with us freely in any way you like.\u201d\nI nearly laughed at that word, \u201cfreely,\u201d but chose instead to nod my head and walk away. My stride was dignified, like a queen\u2019s. All my life I had drifted along passively. Now, at least, in my final moments, I\u2019d taken the initiative and made a decision for myself. Better late than never.\nBack upstairs in my room, I drank some water and set about tidying my hair. I would remember Hyung Joon Jeon\u2019s name, but I refused to share his fears.

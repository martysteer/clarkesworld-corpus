The Eggs\nThe man woke on the wrong side of the shell and had to extricate himself carefully, lest he get any of the Oomu\u2019s mucus over his nostrils and mouth. This was easier said than done, on account of all the bugs still hanging around topside. In his ride\u2019s more amorous phases, its odor was deceptively sweet, and local fauna flew right into its sticky exposed under-mass. Or at least, the fauna was supposed to, but some of the bigger insects liked to linger by the man\u2019s saddle, wavering on the cusp of their inevitable death plunge; and then the man, in his impatience with the sluggish press of nature\u2019s greatest cruelties, would take out his glowing lead-stick and swat them into a bewildered tailspin down, down, down, into the long muscle of the Oomu\u2019s neck and upper back.\nThe man took no pleasure in the act, for such violence only left him staring at his complicity for days, as his victims\u2019 exoskeletons slowly sank into and disintegrated beneath the Oomu\u2019s skin. But the Oomu never seemed to mind all the wing, leg, and stinger bits fallen into its interior, to dissolve into sustenance at whatever rate the giant mollusk deemed best. As its one long foot glided along the steppes and the badlands, the deserts and the plains, the mountaintops and valley-lows of Maia Colony\u2019s lone and ill-populated continent, it paused only to drink in the dew from passing mists, or to nibble at another Oomu\u2019s scent, and\u2014if another Oomu came into visual range\u2014to flash its corpulence from a season\u2019s idle feasting, its under-mass suddenly on brilliant iridescent display. Then it would pause to admire the answering bioluminescent pulse, and decide whether to leave an offering, fresh from the genital spout atop its head, on the cool stone in its wake.\nThere were days when the man, in witnessing these proceedings, could almost trick himself into believing that the Oomu was at peace with its current place in the order of things and didn\u2019t really want to leave all this behind. But little signs had taught him better, well before the difficult decision they had made together at First Landing. For one, the Oomu only ever leftofferings: Never collected them. Never formed a clutch of eggs all its own. Out of fear, or pickiness, the man had always assumed\u2014and had to assume, for even if he\u2019d had the language to ask the Oomu, in all their years wandering the continent together, he\u2019d never thought to pry.\nSpeaking, though, of prying . . .\nWith a deep breath, the man upon so rude an awakening braced himself on the protruding lip of the shell and wrested his other arm loose from the Oomu\u2019s flesh, then batted at some of the buzzing hangers-on before hooking both hands over the shell\u2019s edge and reaching up to give his safety line a tug. His old rig took a moment to register the action before auto-cranking him back to his usual perch, high atop the Oomu\u2019s slate-gray outer casing. The form of its shell was not unlike the helmets of ancient conquistadors (or at least, what the man had seen of them in pseudo-docs from Tierra-Prima), but the resemblance and its import would be lost on the giant mollusk, so the man had never raised this subject, either. There was plenty more listening to do, in any case. For instance, the giant mollusk inside and extending from this unwittingly parodic attire usually noticed when its rider slipped in his sleep, but as the man roused further into the dawn, he realized that the Oomu was moving strangely: swaying and swerving over a plot of desert covered in a crust of . . .\nAh.\nYes, that explained its distraction, and his fall. The sylvite in Minor Basin Six always ran a dusky orange, marking the badlands beyond First Landing with intermittent warning slashes for man and mollusk alike. Now, though, the ground was thickly coated in the salty stuff\u2014the whole mess of it freshly uncovered by one of the desert\u2019s recently intensifying windstorms. Not impossible to traverse, but . . . unpleasant for the one doing all the work. The man still had mucus to wick from an arm before he\u2019d feel settled in his skin again, but once topside and secure in his saddle, he first leaned over to pat the broad, tense muscle of the Oomu\u2019s upper back.\n\u201cShould\u2019ve woken me. We\u2019d\u2019ve found the path together. And what\u2019re you bolting ahead for anyway, you old lout? We\u2019ll find another way around. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d\nThe Oomu steadied at its rider\u2019s touch and gentle chiding, but its eyestalks extended and retracted in emphatic disagreement with this last. The man sighed in deference to the gesture, then squashed a wide-brimmed cloth hat over matted white forelocks, rubbed sleep grit from his eyes, and squinted in the general direction of the Oomu\u2019s peepers, which were pointing (when the tentacles were at their outermost) past the explosion of red-orange sylvite, toward the rim of an ancient crater: wide, and crumbling, and . . . smoking? A pillar of erratic puffs was twisting upward from somewhere beyond that ancient ledge: from some fixed, unknown spot along the crater floor.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t cooking fire. Not by a long shot. The man scratched the gray-haired hollow of his chest in the unease of recognition. He knew the Oomu recognized the smoke\u2019s provenance, too.\n\u201cWell, well. One of those days, is it?\u201d His wide, flat nostrils flared, and he rigged his travel pack with tools from long-term storage before unhooking the safety belt and dropping heavily down the slide of the Oomu\u2019s casing. This time, freed from his sleep harness, the lip of the conquistador\u2019s shell carried him up and out, and he landed with feet splayed, palm hard to the salted earth. His right knee offered a jolt of pain only as he straightened. The metal of the left creaked as he walked on.\nThe Oomu turned its five tentacles toward him\u2014two eyestalks, a touch-tester, a taste-gatherer, and a scent-sniffer\u2014before its forefoot curled inward, as if readying to turn and follow. But the man held up both hands and shook his head.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Easy now. You know how much it pains you to see this sort of thing.\u201d\nHe hesitated after this last part: Too patronizing? Too dismissive? The trust of this Oomu had not been easy to attain, let alone to keep, and this last ride between them had an uneasiness to it that neither seemed willing to confront. Enough to undo a decade\u2019s camaraderie? The man had no desire to risk that conversation, either, so as he crunched along a thicker stretch of sylvite, he was relieved to feel the Oomu\u2019s agreement in unspoken compliance: Only its eyestalks following after. At the rise of the massive crater, the man looked back at the giant mollusk, three times his height and many more his weight, and waved reassurance that his own, minuscule body would be fine, before descending out of sight, into the cooler, moister atmosphere at the crater\u2019s base.\nStill sheltered from the early sun, the other side ran heavy with shadows, cinders, and unpleasant fumes. There, in the impression of solitude that the ridge afforded him, the man shivered despite himself, but stood affirmed in his decision to come down alone. Closer proximity to the smoke already had him revisiting the remains of last night\u2019s supper, and the surrounding detritus wasn\u2019t helping with the nausea. The thought of the Oomu standing by him through all of this\u2014whether it remembered its own emergence from such violent decay, or simply held memories from its generational inheritance\u2014was beyond what the rider could bear.\nOr what the Oomu could bear, he reminded himself:\nThis was for the Oomu\u2019s benefit, too.\nAfter orienting himself in the noisome crater air, the man fixed his attention on the source of all this fuming: An ending world. A cloud of volatile gasses that crackled and sparked not far from the crater\u2019s edge. A pocket of the planet\u2019s first ecosystem, its interior filled with entities furiously generating the incompatible environment they needed to press on\u2014and losing the battle, second by agonizing second, as preceding proto-pockets had done since the humans first arrived.\nBy the size of this one, a few meters in all directions, the man knew it wouldn\u2019t be long now before its final loss. At its base, thrown out in erratic groupings, lay the charred or desiccated husks of pre-world elements that had already succumbed: A spiny-tailed air-worm, its six sail-wings withered nearly to dust. A slew of beetles, the sort that would have glowed magnificently in the sulfuric churn of their native skies, turned to a heap of corroded shells. The sinuous remnants of a massive sky-kelp, once growing fifty meters up through the planet\u2019s richly stratified upper atmosphere, now lying in what looked like rotted clumps of rope upon the storm-swept rock.\nHow many more preforms could possibly remain within?\nThe man knelt beside the ending world and coughed into his sleeve, eyes stinging, while he rummaged through his pack. His face mask would not endure for long in that strikingly protean remnant of an environment that the terraforming ship had all-but-eradicated ahead of the embryonic human fleet. But the covering\u2019s use would protect him, at least, from blowback while he used his heavier-duty protective sleeves to press from this world into its own.\nThe blowback always seemed a kind of moral judgment to the man, as if the ending world were defending itself from its one true nemesis. As if it were alive. Well, and maybe it was, in its way. The man had heard stories about the pre-world that went so far as to suggest an eco-cohesion to the nebulous system: A floral and faunal consciousness, wherein extensive genetic transfer between species had been the norm, and massive viral strings in this aggregate coding had made of the whole far more than the sum of individual species\u2019 parts. Were such stories just the stuff of children\u2019s vids? Perhaps. But even on his approach, this proto-pocket bucked and twisted as if anticipating his trespass into it, and the man caught himself speaking aloud as if to a sentient mass.\n\u201cEasy now,\u201d he said as he switched on his visor and cut through the spewing fumes to make out the interior\u2019s contents. \u201cEasy . . . \u201d\nFor a heartbeat, the man entertained that the fumes would part to reveal an affirmation of the grandest of those local fables: something resplendently alive and resilient enough not to lose its battle against the current atmosphere. But it was only ever a split-second\u2019s dreaming: In point of fact, as the man had more pragmatically suspected, little now resided in the ending world before him. A few branches and spores were sustaining its micro-atmosphere, while tiny arthropods scuttled from twig to twig to keep the floral structure tightly bound; and a clutch of eggs floated in an algal mesh, the latter serving as a kind of filtration system for the cloud on whole.\nThe eggs, though . . .\nThose were progenitor eggs, from the Oomu\u2019s prior species.\nThe man\u2019s stomach knotted as he counted them. Eight in total. He fumbled for a vial in his pack and grimaced after holding it to the light. Not enough to save them all. Still, he retrieved his incubator console and suited up in earnest: Tugging on protective sleeves and torso shielding, then securing neck flaps around his mask before easing both arms into the ending world. With one hand holding the incubator\u2019s open hatch under the mesh, he nudged four eggs loose, trying not to make deliberations about which ones looked \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cmost viable\u201d as he worked. He knew he had to be quick, either way, for the whole ecosystem was reacting violently to his presence: Its failing atmosphere pooling, parting, and surging dangerously around the foreign equipment, almost as if testing his flimsy armor. All the man\u2019s movements had years of practice behind them, though; and so he only struggled once, in the instant that both arms and incubator had fully withdrawn from that furiously shrinking whole.\nStumbling back from the force of the proto-pocket\u2019s answering bellow\u2014a resounding clap and exhalation, as if somehow cognizant of its latest losses\u2014the man coughed and wheezed awhile before setting the incubator on the crater floor and studying the wisps of alt-atmosphere clouding around the rescued eggs. Not much time for a full transfer, at their current dispersion rate. The man plugged the last of his vial\u2019s contents into the incubator\u2019s processing chamber, which in turn applied a dosage apiece to tiny patches that an internal arm then affixed to the side of each egg.\nGRAD ACC? read its tiny console. But the man had traversed the desolation between settlements long enough to know that \u201cgradual acclimation\u201d would not work well on his sort of journey. Too many risk factors out in the baking sun, and along the restless rocks, and when taking shelter from the intensifying storms. ACCEL, he entered instead. As with his safety line and his knees (metal and flesh alike), the man\u2019s incubator was an older number, prone to long processing times, but not so long that he was worried. After a minute\u2019s blinking on the console, the interior warmed and moistened, and telltale signs of activated gene therapy could be seen on the eggs\u2019 surface, while the air around them entered a neutral state capable of supporting life through the transition. The man studied the fragile, glistening creatures in his care, then looked back to the agitated plume of their doomed homeworld.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said to the proto-pocket\u2014and meant it, whether or not it was truly \u201calive\u201d and could hear him, let alone understand the significance of his words. Even if he\u2019d had enough fluid for all the eggs, he never carried the right formulation for the arthropods, or the rest. Rider bias, he supposed. Besides, there was only so much space in his pack or on the Oomu\u2019s back. And stars above, if all four eggs survived the process, they would become massive carry-ons soon enough. Still, it seemed its own form of cruelty, to rescue some from certain death with such efficiency, then walk away from all the rest. Earlier\u2014decades past, when ending worlds roamed wild across the continent\u2014the man had sat with six in their last hours: bits of flora and fauna dropping from each as it shrank, and fought back, and shrank again . . . until a critical limit was reached, and the center could no longer hold. That was the dangerous part for any humans in attendance: the abrupt, gasping burst of those last fumes, which then scattered every which way into the surrounding air. In the early years of the colony, teens had even made a game of it: how close you could stand by an ending world, and for how long, until the risk wore you down.\nOr, on occasion, until some part of it struck you head-on, and you died.\nBut taking up with the Oomu had changed all that for the man\u2014the fool gambles, the furious indignation at the mere fact of existing in such a time and place and body in the universe as his\u2014and now he knew better than to idle at any length on the crater floor, not while the Oomu would surely be anxious until it saw him crest the rim in one piece again. Certainly, it wouldn\u2019t bolt, not with the salt-sands being what they were; and it wouldn\u2019t hasten after him, either, but . . . it would remember. Other abandonments. Other losses. And an Oomu\u2019s memories of grief were not to be trifled with, or added to, as the man had learned the hard way, years ago.\nWith at least these four eggs secure, the man doused, removed, and returned all protective equipment to his pack, which he slung over one shoulder while holding the incubator in both hands. It wasn\u2019t the easiest way to make his precarious return up the crater\u2019s incline, not with the metal of him giving such obvious complaint, but the arrangement was still to his preference. There was something about seeing the little machine at work and holding it firmly in his grasp as it did that gave the man to believe he had some control over the hardness of this land\u2019s outcomes after all. Just so long as he didn\u2019t look back at all that he\u2019d left behind.\nWhen he popped up over the crumbling edge, into the rising heat and brightness of the desert day, the Oomu made a soft sucking sound: Something between curiosity and relief. The man smiled in clenched-teeth gratitude and nodded back.\n\u201cNot sick of me yet, huh?\u201d he said, too softly to be heard. \u201cWell, there\u2019s still a few days left for that, I suppose.\u201d\nPeering through the condensation along the incubator\u2019s interior, he then held up the tiny vessels of life: Four ships in silent running between two differently volatile worlds. At first, the gesture was for the Oomu\u2019s benefit, so it could see what he had done out of its sight. Next, though, it was for his own: To view these tiny eggs in contrast with the giants they would soon become. To imagine the size of things created by his own two saving hands.\nBut the man\u2019s mild contentment with his labors ebbed with every creaky step over the massive spray of sylvite along this stretch of Minor Basin Six; and even as the Oomu tipped its conquistador\u2019s shell to allow him an easier climb back to his perch and their shared holdings, the man\u2019s thoughts drifted to his own embryo-pod, back on the Ignacio, despite his having no direct memory of living in the thing. What humans lacked in direct memory, though, they made up for in mental visualizations built around objects revisited in their lifetimes. And so, as the pair headed off along the clearest path they could find among the livid-orange rocks, the man imagined his own egg streaking along in the incubator of that ship, alongside others in his clutch, toward a trauma beset by bots upon a world that no one had foreseen being populated when the mission first set out.\nThe pressing question, older than both his knees combined, reemerging as man and mollusk put the crater and its sputtering pillar of smoke out of visual range:\nWas it always better to be reborn?\nAgain, the man could have asked the Oomu its opinion\u2014there was language enough between them for that\u2014but he preferred not to. He didn\u2019t want to come off as challenging what they\u2019d agreed upon, even though the Oomu\u2019s choice was proving harder to accept the closer they came to Capitol City. It was bad enough his body already seemed to be radiating feelings about the impending loss of so old a companion. What good could come from talking out a done deal now?\nBetter to pretend, as the man then decided to, that when it came to such massive, world-transforming questions, no one answer would ever do.\nStill, he held the incubator tightly in both hands, rubbing the surface of the enclosure with two restless thumbs for a great while longer, before finding the heart to set it down.\n2. The Kid\nDistant stars and the light off Maia\u2019s largest rings kept man and mollusk company as they cleared the sylvite-laden badlands and sighted a small settlement on the thin line between the barrens and the steppes: a barrier town, two days by Oomu from Capitol City, that could have been mistaken for another sort of ending world, by the looks of its meager internal holdings and the state of its surrounding farmland. Here, too, lay signs of a recent windstorm\u2014but also, from the look of the machinery tossed and shredded in the fields, of at least one prior storm as well: as if the town hadn\u2019t properly recovered from the first before the second came bearing down.\nAgain, the Oomu held back, swaying and swerving as the settlement\u2019s devastated agri-plots came into view; and when the man tried to urge it on with his lead-stick, the massive foot halted entirely, while one eyestalk whipped around to study\u2014or interrogate\u2014its rider\u2019s insistence that they press on after it had so clearly expressed its doubts. The man understood the severity of its concern, then, and set down the lead-stick to show that he was taking the Oomu seriously.\n\u201cGetting protective, are you? Well, I\u2019m not going to trade them. I promise,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, they\u2019re in our care now\u2014see?\u201d And he reached back for the incubator, which he\u2019d snapped securely between a balance of gear behind him, under a tented shelter along the shell\u2019s upper ridge. The eggs were much larger and heavier in their genetically altered forms, as befitted creatures that would soon crawl upon the earth under a highly oxygenated atmosphere, instead of sailing upon breezier and more porous fauna through the dense, tempestuous fumes of pre-world atmosphere. The man had a thought then, and raised the incubator to eye level, squinting at the coloration of its contents. \u201cHm. Maybe time to take them out, even, but let\u2019s wait until we\u2019ve got this town behind us, hey? Looking pretty close now, but I\u2019d rather we had some feed on-hand for the moment they burst.\u201d\nThe Oomu extended its other eyestalk to study the shells, their healthy wet sheens a sign of the augmentation\u2019s success, while its first tentacle continued to watch the man closely. The man tried to quiet his disappointment at the Oomu\u2019s suspicions, but the time this was taking tired him, and he had to set his jaw against saying something that they would both regret. It wasn\u2019t him, he tried to tell himself; and it wasn\u2019t the decade they\u2019d spent together. Some wounds, for the Oomu, were simply bound to resurface from time to time. Maybe a taste on the wind had set this one off. Maybe the look of this town. Or maybe this town, exactly, from actions in another colonial mood.\nWhatever the reason, only when the Oomu\u2019s second eyestalk started to withdraw\u2014a sign of at least momentary satisfaction\u2014did the man lower the incubator in his hands and shelter it anew.\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cBut can\u2019t say I\u2019m not a little hurt by it, too. Never gets easier, I suppose, living with more than one truth about my people in the balance. But Capitol City\u2019s near enough, you hear? This might even be our last real pit stop along the way.\u201d\nAt this reminder, at least, the Oomu seemed to brighten; and after allowing the man to give it a hearty pat on its upper back, it followed his directions without hesitation once the man had raised the lead-stick again. The man\u2019s confidence, though, was not as quick to return. If even a small settlement could trouble the mollusk, how would it handle the impending metropolis? The bustle of traffic, the scents, the sounds, the crush of a million lives? Was it really such a good idea to let the Oomu enter? To take it right to the Institute\u2019s front steps? The man distracted himself from his doubts by studying the upturned farmland as they advanced. The soil was barely fertile, but still a sight better than the badlands, and the pair made good time to town limits, such as they were.\n\u201cHector\u2019s Haven,\u201d read the flash projection along the settlement\u2019s security grid. \u201cPop\u2019n: 1,417.\u201d Then, as the man and the mollusk slid past the perimeter: \u201cPop\u2019n: 1,418.\u201d The man cast an awkward glance at the Oomu. It couldn\u2019t read, but the man rubbed its shell in apology all the same.\n\u201cBackwaters everywhere, no? Well, we\u2019ll be in and out soon enough.\u201d\nHector\u2019s Haven followed a traditional settlement design: A main square for all its critical establishments, around which a smattering of residences stood interspersed with plots for storage, community gardening, and (according to the signage on them) future secondary production facilities. Ambitious, thought the man, considering the precarity of existing builds just beyond the grid. Then again, the same could be said of Maia Colony on whole\u2014and was, with increasingly negative inferences, whenever he lingered near other humans long enough to absorb the latest news.\nPossibly a more foreboding sign than the state of the surrounding farmland, though, was the lack of recovery activity within the grid. Most of the movements that man and mollusk saw upon entry were mechanical: A rumble of bots clearing detritus, resetting security components, and repairing broken sections of roadway. None of them paid the new arrivals any heed. All were rudimentary numbers with limited parameters, no better than those first programmed to prepare the planet ahead of the fleet. This suited the man fine, though, and when he found an empty lot that didn\u2019t appear to be a private holding, he invited the Oomu to wait there while he visited the square for supplies and intel. The Oomu\u2019s tentacles tasted the air and the earth and seemed to find both tolerable, but one eyestalk set itself on the only other major item in the vicinity\u2014a disposal unit with a blinking light\u2014and the animosity in its stare inclined the man to think that he would need to get his business done quickly, before the Oomu spooked at some small sight or sound, then took flight and left him and all the fresh supplies behind.\n(It had been happened before, and the man had no desire to spend the days it sometimes took to track down the mollusk, which could make excellent time solo when it wanted to.)\nThe settlement seemed marginally more animated, at least, as the man neared the main square. There, a few wizened citizens even went so far as to exchange nods with him as he passed the general depot and stepped into the makerspace, where a woman at the service counter jutted lips at his knee without needing to be asked what was wrong.\n\u201cHelluva squeak you\u2019ve got there, ah\u2014\u201d She glanced at the faded name tag the man often forgot was still affixed to the threadbare front of his old military attire. \u201cOrozco?\u201d\nShe said the name with a soft c in place of its k and broke the syllables oddly\u2014\u201coro\u201d and \u201czco\u201d\u2014which gave the man pause, trying to place the nature of her question. As he wasn\u2019t in the habit of being addressed by any name, he didn\u2019t bother to correct her once he\u2019d figured it out.\nRather, he braced his artificial leg on a stool by the service counter and revealed the rest of its battered assembly. \u201cGot something to keep the dust out, you think?\u201d\nShe leaned over the counter and whistled. \u201cYou could almost play it like a harmonica, couldn\u2019t you? Are those chew marks or acid?\u201d\n\u201cReminders.\u201d The man rubbed the largest hole among them, right where the knee joint glinted through.\nThe townswoman didn\u2019t press. \u201cEver thought of a new casing?\u201d\nThe man scratched under his hat and sighed. \u201cGot a mold you could do it quick with?\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Course. Gimme an hour and I\u2019ll have it printed right up around it. Skin-matched, or\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cChrome, if you can. Kind of enjoy the cyborg thrill of it all.\u201d\nShe smiled, then beckoned for him to hand over the limb for servicing. The man unhitched it with ease, then took a crutch in exchange. Wooden number, to his visible surprise.\n\u201cFrom Capitol City,\u201d the woman explained, before he could ask. \u201cThey\u2019re doing wonders with their terrariums and plant yields these days. Every now and then, they like to send us lesser folks on the outskirts, oh, I dunno . . . little reminders of how much better off they have it.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d The man held the burnished wood to the light, where it gleamed a deep whisky gold. Something about the material seemed both familiar and deeply estranging\u2014which just went to show, he decided, how long it had been since he\u2019d seen a tree even in a docu-vid. \u201cI did notice the winds around here haven\u2019t been too kind.\u201d\n\u201cNot for many seasons, no.\u201d The woman folded forearms over the counter, warming to the chatter. \u201cSome say Maia\u2019s finally starting to push back. Might be something to it, too\u2014at least, to hear tell of what the geologists think is going on down below, and the trouble they\u2019re having out at the climate-station these days. But who\u2019s surprised by any of it, really? Only so much you can terraform the surface without fundamentally realigning the core, y\u2019know? And stars above, it\u2019s not like we have the resources for a second attempt anytime soon.\u201d\nShe was preaching to the choir, and they both knew it, but she did this so pleasantly that the man held his tongue on his own share of bad news. Even with the ease of her pessimism, he figured it might shock her to learn just how many ending worlds were popping up in the badlands again\u2014each an indication that it wasn\u2019t just basic geology fighting back, but that also, somewhere on Maia, fuller pockets of pre-world life persisted, and were sometimes launching little colony-ships of their own into the toxic ether of the human realm. But what good would such knowledge do her, anyway? The man recalled peering into that latest ending world along the crater floor and counting what strange species still eked out a paltry living there. As he scanned the rest of the makerspace, where a handful of local craftsmen were refining printer-plans of their own, and older folks were simply whiling away the afternoon in fuller company, he had to make a concerted effort not to catalog the curious holdings within this ending world as well.\nInstead, with a rap on the countertop: \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOne hour.\u201d She hefted his artificial limb in salute, then retreated into the back.\nBut the rest of his errands hardly took twenty minutes at the general depot: Medical supplies, food for one man, treats for a full-grown mollusk, calcium-booster for four imminent young ones, and a new energy cell\u2014all from one service counter with a bot ill-programmed for decent small talk. The man debated seeking out a nearby drink and testing the other locals\u2019 misery around it, but something about the Oomu\u2019s reluctance at the outskirts of town had him turn for the lot instead, a hover-trolley with his purchases tagging close behind.\nThe man hated when his instincts were right.\nJust as he left the main square, he saw large, twisting movements in the distance: The sort that seemed to signal a giant mollusk in distress. His crutch hit the gravel hard as he hastened over to the lot\u2014the trolley whirring frantically to keep pace, while all other bots in the vicinity continued with their oblivious labors. His mind filled with fragments of other confrontations the pair had faced in their decade together: shattered shell bits in a rapid-onset desert storm; gaping under-mass wounds from a confrontation with a stinging mudfish by the coast; and a frightened withdrawal, for months, into the safety seal of its conquistador\u2019s apparel, after a particularly vicious run-in with southern poachers, while the man sang to it from the camp he\u2019d made in the outer world. But the scene on arrival instead had the man torn between instantaneous relief and a different sort of fright:\nFirst\u2014The Oomu was fine. The Oomu was fine.\nOnly, the same couldn\u2019t be said for the human stuck in its translucent skin.\n\u201cMISTER, HELP!\u201d the kid cried. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna eat me!\u201d\nThe man swore in two tongues and waved his crutch wildly while shouting at the Oomu, whose tentacles were fully extended and twisted about to observe what was going on along the side of its under-mass. Which meant . . . the Oomu wanted this. This was no love-season mistake.\n\u201cHey!\u201d said the man. \u201cHey, ho there! Whatcha think you\u2019re doing? Let the kid go.\u201d\nBut the Oomu only jabbed an accusatory eyestalk at the top of its shell. When the man followed the Oomu\u2019s gaze, he saw it, too: their packs torn loose and clearly ransacked; all the safety line\u2019s metal parts stripped; and the incubator . . .\nBlazes, the incubator wasn\u2019t up there at all. The man\u2019s gaze darted about, and soon enough found it lying on its side, on the ground.\nThe man dove for the eggs.\n\u201cHey\u2014hey, mister! I\u2019m dying here! Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d\nThe man watched his hands tremble over the fallen enclosure. Two eggs had been crushed: Their contents lolling in unresponsive pieces, impaled on bits of broken incubator. A third had cracked just enough that the Oomu inside was struggling to breathe. The man eased it from its shell, to give it a chance of transitioning properly to the aerated world, but it didn\u2019t look well at all, and sat limp in his hands even after he\u2019d set it free. The man laid it on the ground to recover further on semi-cool stones, then fished around for the fourth. Intact. Cushioned in the fall by its broken siblings. Still waiting to be born. The man shook out broken pieces of the enclosure, cleared the bodies, then set the egg back in the incubator\u2019s base, along with its struggling sibling.\nThen and only then did he stand to address the kid. He tried to keep his voice level.\n\u201cYou make a habit of tossing what you don\u2019t understand?\u201d\nThe kid was still uselessly wriggling, as if that could ever be enough to pull free.\n\u201cPlease, Mister, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t know they were worth something. They\u2019re like, collector\u2019s items, right? Well, I\u2019ve got some of those myself, okay? I\u2019ll show \u2019em to you, even, if you\u2019ll just\u2014please, this thing, it\u2019s going to\u2014it\u2019s gonna\u2014!\u201d\nThe man\u2019s arms coursed with a heat he never enjoyed feeling, and all the kid\u2019s pleading only seemed to make it worse. He turned to the Oomu\u2019s massive head and held out both hands to be tasted: the sincerity on them, and the sorrow.\n\u201cYou were right, my friend. I should\u2019ve listened. We could\u2019ve waited \u2019til Capitol City.\u201d\nThe Oomu\u2019s tentacles swept heavily over the man\u2019s hands, his arms, and his head: agreement, distress, grief, and questions.\n\u201cI know,\u201d said the man, resisting the urge to wipe his face of the Oomu\u2019s overly sweet muck. \u201cI know. We\u2019ve got two of them left, I think. One\u2019s not doing well, but it could. It still could. In the meantime, though, please\u2014this one\u2019s not much more than an egg for us, too.\u201d\n\u201cWait, those\u2019re its eggs?\u201d The kid\u2019s face fell: the gravity of the offense finally registering.\n\u201cClose enough,\u201d said the man, his gaze locked on the Oomu\u2019s extended tentacles. \u201cBut like all Oomu, they carry whole lifetimes of memories. You just killed two full histories of the world before our own, kid. Maybe three. And you\u2019ve broken the heart of this Oomu, too.\u201d\nThe kid startled both man and mollusk then, by beginning to cry. An arm, a leg, and part of the kid\u2019s torso had sunk into the mollusk\u2019s skin, but one hand remained to press hard at both eyes.\n\u201cMister, I didn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m sorry. I slipped; I didn\u2019t toss it. Honest, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t mean to be stealing from us either, I guess?\u201d\nThe man was ready for a hangdog look and more excuses, only to be surprised again.\n\u201cOh, no, Mister, one hundred percent I meant to be stealing.\u201d The kid was now gulping air to fight back panic. \u201cBut just that, I swear. It\u2019s hard times out here, don\u2019tcha know?\u201d\nThe man didn\u2019t answer, willing his own breathing calm before extending one hand for the Oomu to take entirely inside its mouth. A trust exercise. Then the man waited, watching the Oomu\u2019s contemplative tentacles, while the grind of the Oomu\u2019s radula registered along his wrist. He tried not to think of the thousands of teeth that radula represented. They weren\u2019t for eating, not necessarily\u2014not with the efficiency of its skin-system\u2014so much as for building: For tool creation, and later use. For snapping pre-world branches into sizes better suited for egg enclosures. For building adult shelters against the worst of the fumes\u2019 electric storms. For breaking down large prey into manageable bits for any soft-shelled young to learn how to absorb.\n\u201cEven a brute of an adult, you once showed mercy,\u201d he said to the Oomu now holding his own bones and flesh in the balance. \u201cThis is a child.\u201d\nAnd yes, the man was fudging on this last point, and he knew it, for the kid could\u2019ve been as old as nineteen standards. But what of it? Age-of-majority laws didn\u2019t suddenly make sages out of fools, as his own days in uniform had proven well enough. He held firm to this adjusted truth, then, to keep even a flicker of dishonesty from the taste of his skin and the look on his face.\nThe Oomu pressed down on the man\u2019s wrist all the same. It was only a little pressure, a warning squeeze, but enough that the man grimaced: Closing his eyes and running through how much a new extremity would cost him. Then the sensation passed, the Oomu relenting, and the man withdrew a hand coated in denser slime. The man was about to thank it for its understanding, but when he glanced back along the length of the Oomu\u2019s foot, he saw that its mercy had only gone so far. The kid was still trapped within its skin.\nThen again . . . the kid also hadn\u2019t even been a little bit digested.\n(The man would\u2019ve known. The man would never forget the screaming.)\nHe looked up curiously at his old companion. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got in mind, then?\u201d\nBut the Oomu gave few answers easily, not even in its more contented moods. Now, it simply curled its forefoot, turned, and started for town limits. The man followed for a few steps, then swore to himself, feeling the weight of the crutch still in hand.\n\u201cHey, hold up,\u201d he said to the Oomu. \u201cHold up! I hear you, okay? We\u2019re going. Just, let me load up and . . . and . . . blazes, listen! Listen! Don\u2019t you remember? I need two.\u201d\nHe pointed to one foot, then the space in lieu of another, and waited for the Oomu to notice the gesture\u2014which the mollusk did eventually, if grudgingly, before relaxing its own foot anew.\n\u201cWait, whaddya mean we\u2019re going?\u201d said the kid, after making the mistake of trying to push off the Oomu\u2019s under-mass as it turned. That free hand, too, was now trapped within the mollusk\u2019s skin, while the rest was sinking deeper with the Oomu\u2019s every move to leave.\n\u201cOh, settle down, kid,\u201d the man snapped. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been eaten yet, have you? No? Well, all right. That\u2019s a start.\u201d But then, hearing the irritation in his voice, and casting a guilty look at the vivid redness in the kid\u2019s eyes, he added: \u201cParents around?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d The kid choked on more frightened tears. \u201cI\u2019m a podling.\u201d\nWith the mollusk temporarily at rest, the man had had a chance to turn to the controls of the trolley, which he was reprogramming to follow the Oomu instead of him, just in case. But his hand hovered over the input panel at the kid\u2019s reply. \u201cA podling? Here?\u201d\nHis question was met with a despairing laugh.\n\u201cWell, yeah. Especially here. You think they could keep this dump together any other way?\u201d\nThat sounded about right, once the man had turned it over. He couldn\u2019t imagine many citizens of a struggling settlement being in the mood to create life by any harder means\u2014although, the downside was that the podling way tended to cultivate less fondness among the elders for the new-forms, which in turn meant a greater hardness, and intolerance, toward all their youthful errors. \u201cFair enough. So, no one will mind, then, if you\u2019re gone\u2014I mean, just for a little while?\u201d\nThis last part, the man added quickly at the sight of the kid\u2019s wide-eyed terror: to reassure the little thief, even if he couldn\u2019t tell whether the kid had any right to be so scared.\nOnly the Oomu knew that part.\n\u201cMister, please . . . please don\u2019t leave me here. If I\u2019da known, if I\u2019da only\u2014\u201d\nAnd the kid went on, somewhat incoherently, about intentions and unintended outcomes, while the man shook his head, returned to the input panel, then installed the broken incubator and its contents atop the hover-trolley, carefully penned in by the rest of their supplies. Lastly, he raised his hands to the Oomu\u2019s tentacles, fingers splayed, and flexed his fingers a few times to emphasize that he was counting, before flashing a firm ten digits until the Oomu echoed the gesture with its tentacles, twice. They\u2019d trained on this a few times, but though the man knew that the Oomu could understand human timekeeping, he also knew that the Oomu was often of a mind notto.\n\u201cTen minutes,\u201d he echoed aloud. \u201cPlease\u2014just gimme ten, and don\u2019t scare him, or they\u2019ll all come after you with everything they\u2019ve got.\u201d\nAt this last, though, the kid\u2019s face lit up with another fool idea, so that the man had to whip around and jab a finger in the air. \u201cOh no, don\u2019t you dare. Trust me, if you value your life, you won\u2019t call for help. You know how fast an Oomu can dissolve a body if it panics? Do you?\u201d\nThe fool idea fell from the kid\u2019s expression, along with everything but a sickly pallor.\n\u201cOkay, Mister. I promise. I won\u2019t.\u201d\nThe kid\u2019s voice was barely above a whisper now, which inclined the man to take this promise as sincere. The defeat in it, at least, he could believe. He started off to retrieve his leg.\n\u201cOnly . . . please hurry?\u201d\nThe man hesitated, his back turned to what now truly did sound like the pleading of a child. A note of compassion, he knew, was called for\u2014but out the corner of his eye, he could still see the two shattered eggs, and the pierced flesh of their contents, drying out on the gravel.\nIn silence he pressed on.\n\u201cNot quite finished yet,\u201d said the townswoman. \u201cJust past the mid-calf. Fifteen minutes?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t, sorry.\u201d The man started organizing chits on the service counter. \u201cI\u2019ll still pay in full, of course, for your time and the effort.\u201d\n\u201cGonna look pretty funny with a half-finished mold.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll match the base model, at least. Always looked pretty funny myself.\u201d The man crooked an awkward smile to illustrate his point. \u201cIf, ah . . . if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d The woman withdrew to the main workshop, a partition opening just long enough to reveal the near-deafening whir and grind from a series of massive printers. Most, the man knew, were producing building materials. Maybe some were also dedicated to the intricacy of farming equipment, or to barricade blocks to try to keep out the intensifying winds. Either way, only a few would be for specialty projects such as his, along with the fiddly bits needed to keep local machinery in check. Dedicated luxury models, for the use of finer materials and the printing of their potential creations, were for settlements in far better straits.\nThe woman returned promptly with his half-finished leg, then smiled apologetically while she counted out the chits he\u2019d left on the counter: The half-hearted guilt of one settler\u2019s less-than-complete trust in another. The man felt a share of guilt in turn, but only for his own soreness outside town limits with the mollusk. If even humans couldn\u2019t manage trust amongst themselves most of the time, why\u2019d he have to go and feel so raw that the Oomu\u2019s was even harder to keep?\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cHey, you got a kid around these parts, late teens, podling, the kind with sticky hands, who gets into trouble more often than not?\u201d\nThe woman snorted. \u201cThis one steal from you? Works quick, if it\u2019s the one I\u2019m thinking of. Some podlings have the gift in their bones, I think. Want me to call a Monitor?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, nothing like that. Only, I figure someone here should know they\u2019re with me for a bit, to work off a debt. If anyone asks, I mean. I\u2019ll try to have them back as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe woman held up her hands in a say-no-more gesture. \u201cIf anyone bothers to report a missing pickpocket and crop-thief, I\u2019ll let \u2019em know.\u201d\n\u201cCrop-thief? I thought the winds were doing that well enough on their own.\u201d\n\u201cWell, crop-remnant thief, at least. Claims to be preserving the seeds, but we\u2019ve got servos to sift through the debris and replant the next crop. What in blazes we need special stashes for?\u201d\nThe man scratched the damp brow under his hat after getting his right limb hitched up again. \u201cThat why the kid\u2019s going hungry and foraging alone?\u201d\n\u201cMore or less. Here we work together, or we don\u2019t work in the system at all.\u201d The woman shrugged. \u201cYou know how it goes. What drops off along the way is just nature\u2019s way.\u201d\nLike the beings inside the proto-pockets, or the massive insects that hung about the Oomu: not quite ready to die, but also already lost to the living\u2014although the man couldn\u2019t decide if the townswoman\u2019s declaration better suited the fate of the kid, or of any settlement so quick to cast off whatever human resources it still had at its disposal.\n\u201c\u2019Fraid I do,\u201d he replied, setting the crutch down by the counter. \u201cThat, I surely do.\u201d\nOutside, he peered down the main drag of Hector\u2019s Haven while adjusting his pant leg over the half-finished mold. No sign of the Oomu having bolted, and no mob gathering in the lot, thank the stars. He walked back quickly but warily, more attuned to the faces nodding in passing, and also to the bots still dedicated to recovery labors. What else could he have said to that woman? If the kid had belonged to someone\u2014been hers, even\u2014would there have been any use to his deliberations as he approached the lot? The terrible heat had left his arms now, but its antithesis, a coolness of resignation, ran the length of him instead. There would be no forcing the Oomu to let go of its catch, and anything less than an instant death blow would see it and the kid destroyed. Unless the Oomu relaxed its hold, the kid was simply forfeit: One life for two legacies. Unless . . . ?\nNo. No, the man tried to put aside all foolish human scheming of alternatives as he entered the lot, where he noted that the kid was now stuck up to the shoulders of a settlement-issue jumpsuit in the Oomu\u2019s translucent under-mass. The little thief seemed calm now, too, but the man wasn\u2019t ready to call this an improvement yet. The Oomu\u2019s under-mass harbored a narcotic it used to keep its prey from causing damage as it struggled, and probably that was starting to kick in here. Only, the drug alone didn\u2019t explain the kid\u2019s deeper immersion in the mollusk\u2019s skin.\n\u201cWhat, haven\u2019t learned to quit struggling? Had to dive in even more to figure that out?\u201d\nThe kid\u2019s reply came sleepy and slow. \u201cNah, it told me to get in. Easier this way, for travel.\u201d\n\u201cIt told you?\u201d\nThat did indeed sound like the narcotic talking. The man had never put the Oomu\u2019s slime to the test himself, but he believed the rumors; and if that drug was starting to affect the kid\u2019s perceptions . . . well, it already wasn\u2019t healthy for the kid to stay immersed for long, not when a human\u2019s skin needed to breathe in its own way, too. He tried to remember if the paralysis caused by an Oomu\u2019s toxins was permanent. Too little ever survived submersion in an Oomu for the man to have properly observed its long-term side effects firsthand.\nHis memory ultimately failing him on this accord, then, the man gave up and approached the Oomu\u2019s tentacles\u2014all five of which were out and flexing. Once, twice, and then just two of them.\nTwelve.\nTwelve minutes.\nHe didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry as he set about loading their supplies.\n\u201cYou\u2019re counting too fast,\u201d he told the mollusk as he worked. \u201cIt was nine, tops.\u201d\nThe Oomu offered what the man took for a shrug, then used its radula to help hoist some of the larger items topside. Soon enough, the man was ready to send the hover-trolley back on its auto-return path, then check to see that the drowsing kid still had a pulse. It seemed strong enough, but how much longer would that last? Hours?\n\u201cYou sure you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d he said to the mollusk. \u201cThis is still a life, you know. Revenge won\u2019t bring back the other two.\u201d\nIn lieu of reply, the Oomu tipped the broad helmet of its shell to one side, to help the man climb up again. But the man hesitated now, as the Oomu had on their approach to Hector\u2019s Haven. An uncomfortable disconnect was growing between the pair with every turn, it seemed, on this last journey together\u2014and the Oomu surely sensed it, too, because it withdrew a touch to survey the rider, then cast an eyestalk toward the kid and, ever so slightly, allowed more of the kid\u2019s shoulders to protrude. Proof that it could let the egg-killer and crop-thief go, if and when it wanted to.\nBut that gesture of peace also only affirmed, for the man, the immensity of the Oomu\u2019s power over both him and the kid, and so he knew that he had to respond to its show of leniency with deep appreciation. Push too hard, demand too much more at such a delicate moment for all three of them, and the Oomu might grow impatient and withdraw its act of generosity altogether. Even now, the Oomu was still watching him, waiting for the expected show of gratitude, and so the man forced a smile in thanks. When the Oomu dipped its shell again, he climbed on\u2014realizing, as he did, that the trust of a human could be every bit as difficult for an Oomu to keep.\nThe only difference was . . . well . . .\nHe had to hope that his trust was something the mollusk didn\u2019t want to lose.\n3. The Oasis\nThe man sang to the mollusk on the first leg of their journey out from Hector\u2019s Haven (Pop\u2019n: 1,416, the sign read after their exit). He knew he didn\u2019t have much in the way of natural ability, but figured that the passion with which he offered up Tierra-Prima vallenatos had to count for something. After the second or third rendition of each, he took to interspersing their lyrics with explanations about the human loves they depicted\u2014the old loves lost; the loves one couldn\u2019t bear to imagine losing; the unrequited loves; the men who had never found anything to love at all.\nDid the Oomu understand the general thrust of any of them? Could the Oomu, with a heart bag used as much for waste disposal as for the free-flowing circulation of blood between organs, ever make sense of the tensions that could strain a human\u2019s own? The man had no answer, and no idea even how to pose the question in a way he could be sure of the Oomu understanding\u2014but he knew the difference between when the Oomu was genuinely distracted, and when it was merely feigning indifference: Its tentacles turned away to study anything other than the goings-on high atop its shell. Signs of the latter, in this case, gave the man hope that it was listening after all.\nNot that the man was simply resting while the Oomu carried them to Capitol City: Hooked in, he sang and commentated while moving along the shell\u2019s central ridge, to set up a nursery for the still-struggling infant Oomu and its sibling (which, for reasons the man could sympathize with, at this juncture seemed content to remain unborn). Building their shelter was delicate labor, with supplies needing to be adjusted to create a \u201cfloor\u201d extending out from the shell\u2019s ridge, and ballast on the other side; but the greater challenge was doing so while large insects yet buzzed in the uncertain allure of the Oomu\u2019s mating-season sweetness. As ever, these hangers-on exhausted the man with their heavy wing-rustle, pungent exoskeletons, and errant scratching of legs and antennae against him. Yet he had his doubts about the Oomu\u2019s ability to control its internal biochemistry, and a general fear that the kid might accidentally get digested alongside any potential afternoon snacks\u2014so he tried to swat them away for once, instead of down.\nEverything, the man knew, depended now on the Oomu staying calm.\nThat, and on it longing\u2014soon, he hoped\u2014to sleep.\nSleep, of course, was its own gamble: Half the time, the Oomu retracted fully into its shell to recharge, and this would prove an automatic death sentence for the kid. But since the Oomu had taken such care not to dissolve the thief yet, the man felt confident that it would simply halt where it felt most at ease, slacken along the whole of its exposed foot, and withdraw its tentacles to drowse until restored. Then the man might try to hook his harness into the collar of the kid\u2019s jumpsuit and manually ease the rest free\u2014slowly, very slowly\u2014over that sixteen-hour rest cycle.\nThe man had an inkling, too, of just the place to coax the Oomu to take this snooze. A few hours from Capitol City (the luminosity of which was already tinting the distant horizon) lay a runoff pipe feeding into a pool surrounded by sheltering rocks: Moist, cool, and covered in all manner of succulent algal nibbles. A little oasis with nothing, surely, to drive the Oomu deep into its shell.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be long yet, then. And all the man had to do, for now, was act as though everything had returned to normal between them.\nBut the Oomu wasn\u2019t the only creature in need of settling, as the man realized once the kid had roused to the sound of those traditional love songs, belted high atop the Oomu\u2019s shell.\n\u201cHey! Mister!\u201d came that demanding voice from the gliding mollusk\u2019s side. \u201cYou got anything for the headache your singing\u2019s giving me?\u201d\nThe man paused in the middle of dusting the floor of his nursery with calcium-booster, all the better to fortify the survivors\u2019 fragile casings as they glided atop the elder Oomu\u2019s shell. He tried to remember the last time he\u2019d had another human along for the ride. Certainly, the moment he registered the kid\u2019s voice, he remembered why it had been so long.\n\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re a thief and a comedian?\u201d\nThe kid huffed: A good sign, for it confirmed a lack of lung constriction deep within the Oomu\u2019s skin. \u201cAttempted thief. It\u2019s not like I got away with anything, y\u2019know.\u201d\nThe man shook his head while lifting the infant Oomu into the palm of his hand. Its foot now extended from wrist to fingertip, but injuries sustained in the fall, including that lack of initial oxygen, continued to leave it looking weaker than it should this long after birth. Still, it was eating, so that was something, surely. The man settled the infant in its new nursery, then set a protective covering atop it and the egg, still nestled in the incubator in one corner.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he called down. \u201cSome might say you got away with murder.\u201d\nSilence. Enough that the man braced himself on his half-casted prosthetic and peered over the lip of the Oomu\u2019s shell. No, the kid wasn\u2019t a goner yet. Just busy processing guilt, or maybe trying to figure out a better angle for the rest of their conversation. Either way, the man couldn\u2019t decide if he was relieved that the kid had no ready retort for so heavy a charge. He retreated to his saddle and picked up where he\u2019d left off, on the verse that had been so rudely interrupted.\nHe stopped again when he heard the kid holler something more.\n\u201cEh? What was that?\u201d\n\u201cI said,\u201d the kid shouted, \u201cDoes this guy have a name? This giant slug trying to eat me?\u201d\nThe man debated the merits of explaining the taxonomy of an Oomu to so ignorant a rural-settlement youth. The thought not only wearied him, but also put him in mind of a past life: The instructional halls where he\u2019d once tried to give lectures, as a field expert, on the differences between Oomu and their pre-species, behaviorally as much as physiologically. He remembered how daunting this task had seemed, with so many eagerly cataloging eyes upon him; and then how impossible, once he\u2019d realized that the students were more interested in his personal conversion from soldier to reclamations specialist. The sheer hunger of those third gens, to know what it had felt like to slaughter so many native lifeforms in service to the \u201ccleanup\u201d brigade issued after the terraform ship\u2019s error . . .\nDid he still have nightmares from the early hunts? they\u2019d asked him. Did he think his work with Oomu now, or lectures such as this, would ever be enough to make amends?\nJust as he had struggled for words to describe the Oomu, so too had the man discovered that he had no language for his first years off the Ignacio, which had seen him woken expressly to serve on a task force he hadn\u2019t yet grasped the import of. Explain the Oomu? Explain himself?\nNo, the man had walked away from such failures a long time ago\u2014and into life with an Oomu. This Oomu, with whom he could simply be. And so, he found himself resenting the kid\u2019s ignorant remark for bringing the whole mess of these pent-up thoughts to the fore again.\nStill, he wasn\u2019t the one trapped within its under-mass.\nHe swallowed hard to put his anger to one side.\n\u201cMerriweather,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe man faltered. This sort of kindness had gone rusty on him from disuse, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he could keep it up. He leaned over his saddle and shouted down: \u201cMerriweather!\u201d\n\u201c . . . For serious?\u201d\nBut the incredulity in the kid\u2019s voice made the man feel a touch better. More in control of the situation after all. He smiled indulgently.\n\u201cSometimes Carlos,\u201d he added. Then he straightened in his saddle and winked at one of the Oomu\u2019s tentacles, which had risen and turned back, all the better to study either the nature of this commotion or why the rider\u2019s singing had come to an end.\nThe kid kept quiet for a beat.\n\u201cOkay, Mister, now I know you\u2019re just taking the piss with me.\u201d\nThe man shrugged\u2014though more for the tentacle\u2019s benefit than the kid\u2019s or his own.\n\u201cAsk a foolish question,\u201d he called out.\n\u201cBut why\u2019s that a foolish question? Is he on some sort of wanted list?\u201d\nThe man\u2019s smile advanced to a snort. \u201cYou\u2019re really something, kid. Now why d\u2019you think an Oomu even needs a name like the ones we\u2019ve got?\u201d\n\u201cWell, but why not give it one? Give it a name and it\u2019ll answer to it, won\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cSure, the Oomu learn our ways. \u2019Course they do.\u201d\n\u201c . . . So?\u201d\n\u201cSo, what?\u201d\n\u201cSo, why not this one? He busted or something?\u201d\nA second tentacle rose to study the man. The man held up a placating hand, then leaned over his saddle again.\n\u201cWatch it, kid. You\u2019re not exactly in a position to be calling anything else busted.\u201d\n\u201cOh, really? Wow, that\u2019s rich, Mister. Real rich. Look, what in blazes I gotta watch for? You wanna talk about busted, you wanna tell me if you\u2019ve even got a plan to get me out of here? Because here I\u2019m thinking to myself, hey, this is a pretty smart guy, all things considered, so he wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve let us leave the town like that if he didn\u2019t have a plan. But here we are, aren\u2019t we? Out in the middle of nowhere. And you\u2019ve got nothing, do you? Unless, like, maybe you\u2019re planning to knock this guy out for a bit? Then pull me out while he\u2019s unconscious?\u201d\nFour tentacles were now turned about to study the man, who had never been much for lying or otherwise concealing truths when they hit too close to home; and who this time couldn\u2019t figure out a way to keep flickers of guilt from his face or his sweat-scent. Feeling the heat rise in his cheeks at the kid\u2019s words, the man swore in the best language he had for elaborate phrasing.\n\u201cKid, listen, if you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\nBut it was too late. The highly annoyed Oomu kicked into its highest speed: An aggressive zip usually reserved for rare encounters when it saw another Oomu so delightfully bioluminescent that it simply had to dart over and slime-crawl all over the other\u2019s shell in fierce, fond greeting and mating dance. The man clung to his saddle and nearly lost his hat trying to stabilize himself without toppling back into the nursery.\n\u201cWoah!\u201d he said, scrambling for the light-stick. \u201cWoah there!\u201d\nBut the light-stick was a fruitless effort to maintain a sense of control he never truly had\u2014as the man knew even as he waved it about and tried to tell the Oomu that it had misinterpreted what it had seen in his face, or smell-tasted from his sweat. Meanwhile, he could hear the kid moaning and spluttering from massive sweeps of air rushing along and under the aerodynamic curve of the Oomu\u2019s shell (along with the occasional insect, clod of dirt, and bit of dust).\nThere was nothing to be done about the kid\u2019s discomfort, though, until the Oomu decided to stop\u2014which it did, hours later, ironically at the very place where the man had intended for it to take its much-needed rest. But rather than sinking into a well-deserved flop along the rocks around the runoff pond, the first thing the Oomu did when it hit the cooler, more humid air around the pipe was . . . practically shoot the kid out from its side.\nThe kid\u2019s head hit the dirt before either arm could swing around as a proper brace, while the man scrambled out of his harness and leaped to the ground before the mollusk decided to shake him off, too. The man had just cleared the shell and turned to thank the Oomu for letting the kid go when the mollusk turned all five tentacles and its forefoot from both humans and continued with purposeful\u2014furious\u2014intensity on its way.\nAway from the runoff pond and its succulent algal nibbles.\nAway from its much-needed rest.\nAway from the man, and toward the bright, if hazy lights of Capitol City.\n\u201cWait!\u201d said the man. \u201cThe little ones!\u201d\nBut of course, the infant and egg-bound Oomu would be fine with their elder. Despite the latter\u2019s ire, the man knew it would not endanger either surviving youngling if it could help it.\nStill, he waited until the Oomu had zipped far enough along that it could be mistaken for a fleck on the horizon before letting his arms fall slack and turning to the curled up and whimpering kid, who was struggling to restore mobility to all extremities. Everything appeared intact, at least.\nNext, the man cast about their modest oasis: Willing himself to be calm and look for other positives in the situation. The Oomu was angry, after all, but it hadn\u2019t been so angry as to abandon them both at random in the steppes, or to dissolve the kid on the spot. So, maybe the Oomu just needed a moment to cool down. Maybe it would tire soon enough of being angry, and of feeling betrayed, then retreat to this ideal shelter for a good, restorative slumber.\nThe man crouched to help the kid up.\n\u201cBlazes just happened?\u201d The kid groaned, touching a trickle of blood over one eye before trying to clean it with the least-slimy patch on a jumpsuit sleeve.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t listening,\u201d said the man. \u201cThe Oomu\u2019s got language, ours along with its own, and it hears things. It heard you making plans, and acting like they were my plans all along, too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, but that\u2019s good then, isn\u2019t it? Like, that\u2019s what got me out, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe man ignored the question. He turned to survey the pool of murky, algae-laden water, then the slime-trail streaking out toward civilization. Four hours to Capitol City by Oomu was . . . eighteen on human feet, with pit stops? Ten, maybe, if they headed instead for the climate-station that supplied the runoff for this pond, then took a vehicle the rest of the way in?\n\u201cWe\u2019ll camp here tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, if the Oomu hasn\u2019t returned . . . \u201d\nHe jutted lips toward the light pollution: a gray-yellow haze in the darkening turquoise sky, at the end of a long expanse of desolate landscape before them.\nEven the kid\u2019s answering silence seemed crestfallen.\nThe kid\u2019s pockets, at least, proved useful. There wasn\u2019t much around the runoff pipe to burn, but enough detritus lined the banks of the little pond to make a fire with the starter on a standard-issue multitool (chest pocket), while a filtration cap (left-leg pocket) helped with clearing some water to drink. Then there was the matter of a nutri-bar (shoulder pocket), which the man declined a bite of when the kid offered; and a dense wad of papers, which had spent the last day secure in the right-leg pocket, but also looked as if it had been through far worse long before.\nThe man, eyeing each item on removal, regretted that he hadn\u2019t outfitted the upper half of his prosthetic with so much as a flask, in case of such emergencies. Then again, as a rider with the Oomu, his shows of helplessness had always been part of their unspoken agreement: No need to get rigged up every day in a jumpsuit like the kid\u2019s, when it would only give the mollusk reason to think that he wasn\u2019t going to stick around. The downside of unspoken agreements, though, was that the man couldn\u2019t say for certain if even ten years of performing relative helplessness for the giant mollusk would be enough to bring it back now. He wasn\u2019t even sure it was safe to hope.\nHe pointed, in the meantime, to the wad of roughed-up papers. Paper was a useful medium in the low-tech expanse between settlements and could be flash-formed easily enough from the right weeds, but the state of Hector\u2019s Haven hadn\u2019t given the impression of even hemp crops doing well. This was more of the kid\u2019s thieving at work, no doubt, though its purpose wasn\u2019t clear.\n\u201cLove notes?\u201d\nThe kid snorted, pushing long dark hair to one side with a hand that seemed to have regained full functionality. The kid\u2019s deslimed clothes were drying on a rock.\n\u201cNah, look\u2014like I told you, I\u2019ve got stuff I been collecting, too.\u201d\nThe other hand was still a bit stiff as the kid used both to pry apart a few layers of the pulpy block. The man leaned in, then raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cThese the seeds you been stealing from your people?\u201d\nThe kid made a face. \u201cMy people are stubborn. They keep getting the bots to gather, store, and replant the same useless things. And, sure, those crops worked for a couple generations\u2014but now we need something more resilient, see? Something with tougher roots, slicker surfaces. Something to withstand all these weird new storms. So, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been studying, on my own. I\u2019ve got all kinds of splices back in my bunker. Some of them so tough, you\u2019d swear they could knock back a whole storm itself. The aim\u2019s to get a few species to serve as a kind of double-crop\u2014half foodstuff, half natural barrier for the town.\u201d\nThe man couldn\u2019t resist a smile. \u201cThey still have to be edible, though, you know.\u201d\nThe kid kissed teeth in impatience. \u201cYeah, yeah, Mister, that\u2019s what the Council said, too. So, maybe we adapt our digestive systems, right? We\u2019ve got gene therapy for pretty much everything else on this dump of a world. Why not that?\u201d\nThe man leaned back against a bit of protruding pipeline, a thin stream burbling behind him, and knew at once that the kid didn\u2019t know how to read the expression on his face. Instead, perched like a wild thing atop another rock, toes splayed and long hair falling all about a scrawny, starvation-bruised torso, the kid peered at him like an inquisitive bird\u2014but with all a human\u2019s abiding distrust of fellow human beings.\n\u201cWhat? You got a problem with that? Well, but why not try to change ourselves for once instead of our surroundings? How\u2019s it any different than with your leg, y\u2019know?\u201d\nThe man shook his head and knocked on the half-finished chrome job, impeccable up to the mid-calf. \u201cDon\u2019t go bringing this\u2019n into it. There\u2019re those who think I should\u2019ve laid in and gotten a whole new flesh number for it instead.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d The kid looked at him uncertainly. \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe man considered. \u201cPartly, because there\u2019s history here. History I don\u2019t want to lose or forget. And I guess I\u2019m not sure I won\u2019t forget, if I replace the souvenir completely.\u201d Then he chuckled to himself. \u201cPlus, time\u2019s a coming when the real knee\u2019ll give out. I can feel it. So, it might not be the worst thing, to have this old clunker to lean on when that day comes.\u201d\nThe kid was not good at masking disagreement or distaste. \u201cYou sound just like \u2019em, you know. Half the time, I think the real problem with my people is that they love the hardship. Love it, like, they\u2019d rather die doing what they\u2019ve always done than risk something new, and have it work, and have to give up being so constantly miserable.\u201d\nThe man found himself agreeing with most of this, but burst out laughing at the kid\u2019s inference that he was miserable. Age always did seem a kind of agony to the young.\nIn turn, though, the kid misunderstood and scowled, going hot in the face.\n\u201cWell, fine, go on then, laugh while I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to talk serious. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d\nAnd the kid smashed the wad of seeds together again, set it by the drying jumpsuit, then curled up with hands tucked under shoulders for warmth, to try to fall asleep.\nAmid the kid\u2019s theatrics, though, the man had indeed been considering a serious answer\u2014which, yes, included saying how proposing that everyone genetically modify their stomachs was a bad idea in the current culture; but also, that the stuff about the seeds themselves showed a good spirit of inquiry and inventiveness, and reflected the sort of thought processes that the colony could use more of, to bring about the system-wide changes needed to weather coming storms.\nHe could have said all of this, and more, but the rings of Maia were starting to fill the night sky, and the pair\u2019s meager pile of suitable kindling was almost at an end; and as much as the man liked to imagine that the Oomu worried about him when he was out of view, he was now beginning to doubt it: Beginning to wonder, too, if he\u2019d always been projecting his own loneliness and fears upon so dear a companion. And if maybe he was, in fact, a little miserable after all.\nAnger kept him silent, then: Anger and helplessness, because if only the kid had kept away from the mollusk in the first place, there would\u2019ve been no reason for such doubting. If only the little thief had left well enough alone for the\u2014stars, half hour, tops!\u2014that the man had been off buying supplies, then he would\u2019ve been able to treasure his last night with the Oomu in their usual, relative peace, in an understated communion of silence and maybe song, instead of shivering out here more or less alone . . . and wondering.\nWondering if this first taste of aloneness wasn\u2019t just a sign of things to come.\n4. The Station\nMorning, a poor night\u2019s sleep on a twinging back, and the lack of a heavy sweep of greeting-slime across his face, did not improve the man\u2019s mood. Frustration, loss, and fear for the Oomu\u2014for all three of the Oomu\u2014twisted in his chest as he surveyed the runoff pond and followed its underground piping in the general direction of the climate-station, carefully dug in at a wide remove from Capitol City. Even this oasis didn\u2019t seem so innocent anymore: Nothing did. The more he paid attention to every sign of industry meant to keep the colony going, the more the man felt like they were all close to being ejected from a massive proto-pocket. But if that was to be the end of things for Maia Colony, fine, so be it: What really bothered him was the dithering. Let nature hurry up and knock them all down and out already, if it was ever of a mind to.\nHe felt a bit better, though, once the kid offered him the rest of the nutri-bar.\nAnd the kid seemed calmer, too: Dressed, long hair pulled back, pockets filled anew. A far more believable profile of a podling long since used to living on its own. In silence, then, the pair filtered more cold, metallic runoff and set out across the remainder of the steppes, surveying the low-lying brush for anything edible: Leaves, mainly, and the occasional root or berry. That silence abided for the first twenty clicks, too, but when they reached formal signs of city infrastructure, including a dirt road heading in the general vicinity of the station (to the left) and Capitol City (to the right), the kid hung back the more the man veered right.\nMeanwhile, the man\u2019s mood had declined again in the course of their hike. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cY\u2019think I have time for more of your nonsense? If it\u2019s in the city, it needs me, even if right now it doesn\u2019t think it does\u2014and all thanks to you. All thanks to all the damage you\u2019ve done.\u201d\nBut these baiting remarks didn\u2019t stick.\n\u201cYeah, but . . . \u201d said the kid, in a soft, flat voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t go that way.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cDid I say you went that way? Did I ever\u2014\u201d Then he noticed the distant look on the kid\u2019s face and registered the verb tense. \u201cSay that again,\u201d said the man.\n\u201cI said, I didn\u2019t go that way. I went . . . \u201d And the kid pointed left, toward the climate-station, with half-lidded eyes and in the manner of a sleepwalker.\nThe man hesitated, then doubled back and rested his hands lightly on the kid\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said, shaking them. \u201cYou awake? Or dreaming?\u201d\nThe kid blinked furiously, noticed the man\u2019s proximity, then staggered back and away.\n\u201cBlazes, Mister! Keep a distance, will you?\u201d\nThe man squinted at the now fully alert youth, then scratched a bead of sweat down the side of his face. Was it possible? There wasn\u2019t exactly a body of literature on the phenomenon, but there\u2019d always been whispers of it, those wild hallucinogenic tales: Of genetic, generational memory that could be deposited, or transferred, to even a human as easily as the Oomu laid sperm and eggs for other Oomu to collect. A consciousness that could extend between organisms even on this side of the atmospheric divide. A system that worked together to keep something larger than itself alive.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, though he was inclined to blame his low blood sugar for the extent of his present credulity. \u201cWe\u2019ll go left then.\u201d\nThe kid\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cYou believe me?\u201d\nThe man shrugged. \u201cNot exactly. But I see now that I should\u2019ve trusted more in my old friend to have some sort of plan after all.\u201d\nEven as he said this last, though, the man felt weary: The morning\u2019s irritation slipping into grief. Such a waste of their last days together. Such a mess of useless misunderstandings\u2014on both their parts\u2014if the Oomu could\u2019ve just made itself this clearly known to the man the whole time. Although, if that kind of linguistic clarity was only possible after full immersion . . .\nThe kid fell in step beside him, shoulders hunched, as they started for the station.\n\u201cIt does have a name, you know.\u201d\nThe man shook his head.\n\u201cAn inner one,\u201d the kid went on. \u201cIt calls itself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d\n\u201cNo? But it\u2019s a part of\u2014\u201d\nThe man looked to the sky. He didn\u2019t know where else to look, so as not to snap at the kid again. \u201cIt could\u2019ve told me itself, if it wanted me to know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s respect that.\u201d\nThe kid nodded, and this time stayed quiet as they pressed on.\nWhen they tired, they rested\u2014though with care, in the heat\u2014which gave the man time to chew on some decent roots until he felt halfway human again, and then to address the rest of him by readjusting how his leg sat in the cradle of the prosthetic. It hadn\u2019t been used for long distances in quite some time and even a good fit could become uncomfortable under such circumstances, but to his mild amusement, the part that upset him most was how much he found himself missing the original creak: The sheer distraction of the thing. Without it, the only sounds that paced the pair were those of the kid\u2019s boots scraping along the flora, unsettling clods of dirt and gravel, and of the man clearing his throat between increasingly wheezy breaths.\nMaybe in Capitol City he could get someone to put it back.\nIn the meantime, it was hard going. When they finally reached the climate-station, eleven hours had passed\u2014three for stops along the way\u2014and the sheer distance, once traversed in full, left the man puzzling over the underground piping in a less cantankerous, but also far more troubling light. He knew the extent of the system had something to do with long-term plans for planetary stability\u2014a laying of the \u201cbones\u201d for a network of future climate-stations to deflect problems long before they reached Capitol City itself\u2014but the extent of the precaution was itself ominous, when held in contrast with how little such concerns seemed to be discussed on colony channels. He hadn\u2019t seen reports anywhere about the growing number of proto-pockets, either, so either such matters weren\u2019t being discussed because they weren\u2019t important after all . . . or because they were very important, and there was nothing anyone could do that would be worth the chatter in the interim.\nSuch ruminations dropped clean away, though, when the man saw the low, squat shape of the station in the twilight; and beyond it, just outside its perimeter fencing, a human reaching up to be addressed by a giant mollusk\u2019s mouth and tentacles.\nThe Oomu\u2019s massive conquistador shell proved a perfectly recognizable silhouette on the cusp of night, and the man\u2019s eyes stung at first sight of it.\nThe kid, for his part, seemed to be humming vallenatos as they drew near.\nA station scientist was standing by the Oomu as they approached, and when she waved warmly to the worn-out arrivals, the man resented her at once for her proximity to his companion. He stood some twenty paces off, legs planted in the earth while he processed the scene, as well as his own confusion in finding the giant mollusk here instead of Capitol City. Had the metropolis frightened it after all? Had it doubled back for reinforcements?\nBut if the latter, why here? Why not return to him?\nThe Oomu\u2019s answer, at least to this last, came when it turned tentacles toward him, then away. Oh, yes. It was still hurting. Still grieving the suspected betrayal. The man wanted to rush over and talk to it, explain himself, but felt frozen in place, as if in the middle of a showdown, for how much the woman seemed to draw his attention\u2014and the kid\u2019s\u2014to her instead.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were wondering when you\u2019d arrive. Salutations. Stars, you should\u2019ve seen the look on its face when it sensed this young one coming. A wild feeling, no, that bonding?\u201d\n\u201cSure is.\u201d The kid glanced warily at the Oomu.\n\u201cHm,\u201d said the woman, with an understanding smile. \u201cY\u2019know, I wasn\u2019t sure if it would remember me, either, but the moment it got close last night, we both felt it\u2014that inner bond. Like it was yesterday, no? Ah, dear one. How terribly long it\u2019s been.\u201d\nThe Oomu\u2019s tentacles extended and withdrew contentedly, and it replicated a few of the woman\u2019s hand movements before offering signs of its own. Signs the man did not know.\nThen the woman held out a hand to the man and the kid. It was a long, awkward distance to cross for a handshake, and the woman made no effort to draw nearer to them. Instead, the man had to detach himself reluctantly from where he stood, and take one heavy pace after another, in order to close the gap. At the last step, he almost balked, for the presence of the unresponsive Oomu still upset him so\u2014and then he shook. The kid shook, too.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, once they were all together by the Oomu\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m Leidy. I work climate stats\u2014I mean, obviously, right?\u201d She gestured behind her to the gray stone of a facility entrance, which had been 3D-printed more to bear up to windstorms than to attract visitors. Beneath it, the man knew, lay the real operations hub, with a massive silo, currently closed, that could shoot all manner of thermochemical treatment into different layers of the atmosphere. Doubtless the Oomu had used that very silo to descend and wait out the day\u2019s heat: a giant mollusk is something to see, when it went fully vertical at its immense size and weight.\n\u201cBut before that I was in reclamations,\u201d she continued. \u201cI, personally, helped this one with its first transition. Stars, but you were a lot smaller back then, weren\u2019t you? Got yourself gloriously fattened up on plenty of desert flies and arthropods since then, I see.\u201d\nThe Oomu glowed\u2014a full-body flicker of iridescence\u2014at this compliment.\nAnd the woman looked the part of an early integrationist, too, with waves of platinum to rival the man\u2019s wiry chest hair and laugh lines that also carried their sorrows. Second-through fourth-gen had better ways of weathering this land, but first-gen had been born fresh from the ships, with neural uploads from Tierra-Prima, yet little muscle memory from their base models. Maia had not gone easy on their bodies during that first vital learning curve for the colony on whole.\nAt the word \u201csmaller,\u201d though, the man\u2019s gaze darted anxiously to the crest of the Oomu\u2019s shell, then all around them. \u201cThe youngling and the egg. Where did\u2014are they\u2014?\u201d\nThe woman made a set of moist popping sounds for the Oomu\u2019s benefit, before repeating herself for the others. \u201cYou see?\u201d she said, after its tentacles drooped in reply. \u201cI told you. Just a big misunderstanding. He wasn\u2019t going to hurt or betray you. He\u2019s as worried about them as you were.\u201d\nThe man felt a more concentrated heat blooming in his chest.\n\u201cWell of course I wasn\u2019t going to hurt or betray it. Honestly, after everything we\u2019ve been through together, how could you think for a second that I\u2019d\u2014?\u201d\nThe woman raised a hand against the man\u2019s outburst, but the kid answered first, with half-lidded eyes, and that soft, flat voice.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really let me go.\u201d\nIt took the man a second to realize that the kid was neither addressing the Oomu, nor talking about being trapped inside the giant mollusk\u2019s under-mass. He looked between the two of them: Surprised, then hurt, by the link that seemed to include everyone but him. \u201cI . . . \u201d\nThe woman approached him with a clear effort to be gentle. \u201cIt tells me that you weren\u2019t much of a talker, all these years. Not about anything deep, at least. And it respected that\u2014respected that maybe there were things you weren\u2019t ready to tell it. But it took a lot out of our friend, to be with someone like that for so long, even with all the struggles you overcame together.\u201d\nThe man noticed that he was wringing his hat in both hands\u2014and so hard, it looked more like a washcloth. He willed himself to relax his hold, letting the hand fall slack to one side. \u201c\u2018What does that even mean, \u2018someone like that\u2019? Don\u2019t you know me? Haven\u2019t we known each other all this time?\u201d He raised his free hand to the Oomu, but the Oomu declined to take it into his mouth, to receive the proffered trust exercise. The man let this hand fall slack, too.\n\u201cWhat our friend means is . . . someone who never leaves an inheritance,\u201d said the woman. \u201cIt\u2019s different for their kind. You know that. I know you do. You\u2019re still well known for your early fieldwork, you know, even if you\u2019ve gone to great lengths to try to disappear ever since. I was so busy on the lab side, myself, that it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019ve never met, but even the kids today learn about you. Or at least, from the idea of you. From the stories others tell of your work\u2019s impact.\u201d\nBut the man shook his head, not willing to be baited into a conversation about how little he ever stuck around for symposiums, or professional mingling of any other common human type. The barrens, the steppes, the mountains, the valleys: all the spaces in between colonists\u2019 grandest dreams of new and far-flung human civilization had always suited him better.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t lay eggs,\u201d he said. \u201cNever has. Never will. How\u2019s that any different?\u201d\n\u201cNo? Really?\u201d She turned to the Oomu. \u201cNot ever?\u201d\nThe kid, mumbling as if in a dream, replied in its stead: \u201cI donate my memory to other broods\u2014and like this, with some of you. But what memories do you pass on? What future generations are you nurturing among your own?\u201d\nThe man stared at the giant mollusk.\n\u201cIs that what this is about? You didn\u2019t trust me to let you go because I don\u2019t share my memories with others?\u201d\n\u201cPut yourself in its\u2014ah, foot,\u201d said the woman. \u201cSo much is blended in the Oomu\u2019s world: Past, present, future, selfhood, otherhood . . . If you hold memories so tightly, is it really a stretch to think you might hold other things tightly, too?\u201d\nThe man pursed his lips, displeased with how reasonable that sounded. \u201cOkay, fine, maybe,\u201d he said to the mollusk. \u201cBut in what universe, exactly, could I stop you? If I got in your way, what was ever to keep you from swallowing me up, like you did with the kid? Or worse, with the\u2014\u201d\nBut the man didn\u2019t like to mention the other incident, so he cut himself short. Moreover, he could hear the dishonesty in these questions even as he uttered them, for of course the man could stop the mollusk, once they got to Capitol City. The man would be overseeing all arrangements there, and he could easily find the excuse, and the means, to turn the Institute\u2019s staff against its request. Granted, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for the Oomu to pursue its plans solo, but it would be much harder. Of course the Oomu had a vested interest in not swallowing its rider whole.\nThis time the Oomu\u2019s response came through alternating tentacles: One extending and receding, then the next, and the next, until all had had their turn. \u201cMaybe so, or not,\u201d the signal read.\nThe woman rubbed the Oomu\u2019s tensing neck in reassurance.\n\u201cWith silence comes a cost,\u201d she said to the man. \u201cA rift, which unfortunately it seems this last journey seems to have strained between you two. Obviously, it wants to believe that you\u2019ll be true to the decision you made at First Landing. Only . . . \u201d\nShame and anger bloomed in the man\u2019s chest, and his incredulity deepened. Had they not broken up whole trafficking rings together? Rerouted a river when Oomu nesting grounds were deprived by a newer settlement? Identified Maia Colony\u2019s first serial killer (much as the man had mixed feelings, and sometimes still-haunted dreams, after the Oomu had meted out justice before fellow humans could)? In all that time, had he really just been projecting his own need for privacy and discretion on the Oomu? Could he simply have been more open himself, and then asked his companion point-blank about all the key issues that had built up over the years between them?\nSome questions, once framed in the man\u2019s head, immediately answered themselves.\nAnd not always in pleasant ways.\nThe man felt tired, very tired. And foolish.\n\u201cWhere are the egg and the youngling?\u201d he said quietly.\n\u201cSafe,\u201d said the woman. \u201cAnd the second hatched this morning\u2014isn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d\nThe man nodded.\n\u201cAnd I promise, they\u2019ll be safe here until they\u2019re old enough to decide their own way to go.\u201d She patted the Oomu\u2019s shell wistfully. \u201cThey\u2019re just not ready yet to make the choice that this one has. For now, at least, our dear one must go on alone.\u201d\n\u201cFor now?\u201d\nThe woman shrugged, avoiding eye contact. \u201cWell, who knows what the future holds?\u201d\nBut the kid\u2019s gaze had long since wandered to the building behind her: Its deceptively innocuous metal door; its low height, and width, and volume. A bunker\u2019s entrance. An entrance for those who feared and were preparing for the worst. The kid was seeing it now, too\u2014the suspicions that had been quietly building in the man\u2019s head on the way over from the runoff pond. And with that realization, for the seed-thief, came . . . vindication. A spark in those bird-bright eyes, as if it had only just occurred to the kid that a big city would be filled with people more receptive to change.\n\u201cWell now, I got a hunch,\u201d said the kid with a smirk, \u201cthat maybe you do.\u201d\nBut the scientist was unthreatened by youthful provocations. \u201cIndeed,\u201d she said placidly, \u201cStill, it\u2019s early days yet. We\u2019re figuring out better ways of assessing the scope of the situation.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d The man noticed that the kid was now favoring the jumpsuit leg containing the wad of seeds for genetic tinkering\u2014rubbing it restlessly against the other leg, as if to affirm that it was still there. \u201cWhile towns like mine get torn up in the worsening storms.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s smile turned bracing. \u201cIt\u2019s neither fair nor just, I know. But our research goes at the pace it has to go. As yours will, too, if you\u2019ve ever a mind to join us.\u201d\nHer calmness won the kid over, and to the point of overeagerness. \u201cWhat, like, now?\u201d\n\u201cWell, no, not exactly.\u201d\nShe looked to the horizon, and then they all did, listening. The last of the day\u2019s light was gone, leaving only Maia\u2019s rings and the stars to cut through the staggering dark. The woman turned to the Oomu, her expression changed: a welling up at the eyes, a wavering in her bottom lip, a faltering in her voice. She opened her arms and lay flat against the side of its exposed under-mass: as close to an embrace as a human could manage with an Oomu.\n\u201cSafe travels, dear one.\u201d\nThe Oomu slicked her in turn, and she laughed, wicking the slime from her nostrils and mouth before it crusted over. Then the Oomu turned its tentacles to the other two, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation, tipped its conquistador\u2019s shell to one side. The kid froze, at first.\n\u201cYou want me to . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cIt needs you to.\u201d The woman clapped a hand on the kid\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou hear it within you now, don\u2019t you? That need?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but\u2014why? Why\u2019s it gone and put this thing in me?\u201d\nAnd not in me, the man wondered, while watching the rest.\n\u201cOh, no, you did that, not the Oomu,\u201d said the scientist. \u201cThe bond started the moment you did it harm. That\u2019s how it always goes, though in this atmosphere it\u2019s not as easy to tell how much our actions create reactions, now is it? All it\u2019s done is formalize that memory for you, of your mistakes and their consequences, so that you\u2019ll never forget them.\u201d\nBut this answer only deepened the kid\u2019s confusion. \u201cThen why\u2019ve you got it, too?\u201d\nThe woman sighed, looking past the kid to the man. At last he saw the weight of guilt, the weight of some terrible trespass, upon the first-gen scientist, too.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she said\u2014to him, more than to the boy\u2014\u201cThe Oomu didn\u2019t see any reason to respect my privacy, either, when I\u2019d done it wrong. Or, no, let me put it differently\u2014because \u2018respect\u2019 and \u2018privacy\u2019 are such human terms, aren\u2019t they?\u2014What I mean is, when I caused it harm, it treated me just as it would another Oomu\u2014just as it\u2019s treated you, young one. Only ever once, I suspect, has it really tried to go at this business any other way: to look outside its species standard, and to treat a human as a human would want to be treated instead. Which is an extraordinary thing, if you think about it: The thought of a human who could inspire an Oomu to try to live by his own code of conduct . . . if only for a while. He\u2019d have to be quite the legend, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nThe man swallowed hard and turned to the Oomu. He didn\u2019t need to say anything to be understood; his expression held the question, Is that true? well enough. In answer, the Oomu extended three tentacles\u2014the touch-tester, taste-gatherer, and scent-sniffer\u2014and entwined them: the sign for \u201cfeels real, tastes real, smells real . . . is real.\u201d\nIt sunk in then, for the man, just how hardthe Oomu had been working this past decade, to play the game as much by his terms as possible. And out of . . . what? Respect? Curiosity? A desire to learn humanity as best it could before moving on? Whatever the cause, the man felt a wave of quiet humility, and gratitude, in the shadow of his oldest companion\u2019s restraint, though everything about its species longed to merge without consideration for any such bizarre human notions of choice.\nAnd so only at the end of things between them, when the Oomu had most needed to believe that the man would extend the same courtesy to it, too, had it grown anxious and unsure. But why not? Did humans always permit others the autonomy they made such a fuss over for themselves?\n\u201cRight then . . . right,\u201d he said, setting his hat back over his mop of white curls. He shook hands again with the scientist and thanked her for caring for the rest of the brood. Then, approaching the Oomu\u2019s tipped shell with trembling hands\u2014\n\u201cCome along then, kid,\u201d he said faintly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one last job to do.\u201d\n5. The City\nThe Oomu wasn\u2019t as jumpy in the streets of Capitol City as the man had expected\u2014not now, at least, that the man himself was calmer, and no longer exuding all kinds of tense, private, volatile energy that the Oomu hadn\u2019t known how to read, or if it could trust. The smells here certainly differed from those in the barrens, as did the obstacles: The cacophony of human-, car-, tram-, and mollusk-traffic throughout the sprawling grid of the largest, most dynamic settlement in all of Maia Colony. But past the towering solar farms and living quarters; beyond the energy stations and research labs; a little further out than the new-builds and the makerspaces . . . there were trees. Massive tracts of city-enclosed acreage for luxury goods and materials, at the center of which stood the immense fortress of the Advanced Biotech & Genomic Engineering Institute.\nAnd inside it, as every colonist well knew: the Zoo.\n\u201cWell, old friend,\u201d said the man, when they stood outside the Institute\u2019s warehouse entrance for trucks and giant mollusks alike. \u201cHere we are.\u201d\nBut he made no move to dismount, or even to begin his very last tasks about the precarious top of the Oomu\u2019s conquistador\u2019s helmet: To detach the long-term storage rigs, and the sleeping gear, and the saddle. Even through the distraction of heady city fumes, the man was taking in the smell, one last time, of the early heat as it rose off the Oomu\u2019s casing; and the feel of scuff marks and healed shell bits within reach; and the sight of what stray insect segments were still being dissolved in the translucent depths of the Oomu\u2019s nearby skin; and how the grayest parts of his old friend\u2019s shell just barely glinted in the morning light.\nAnd the Oomu knew all this, and allowed it, watching the man without watching him: Pointedly turning all its tentacles in other directions, to make a grand show of giving the man his privacy for grief\u2014at least, until the massive doors to the warehouse rolled aside, and their contact waved from the ground in excited greeting. Then the Oomu glided in, and a whole team of Institute workers thronged about to help the kid and the man unpack the Oomu\u2019s decade-long load.\nThen, the man knew, it was time for him to go.\nThe Oomu didn\u2019t tip its shell for him\u2014allowing the man one last slide, and leap, and painful protest from a knee of aging, first-gen flesh\u2014but it did so for the kid, who eased more carefully to the ground, then awkwardly turned and patted the Oomu\u2014tentatively\u2014on its under-mass.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said the kid, once the Oomu\u2019s eyestalks were watching. \u201cFor not eating me.\u201d\nThen the kid slumped, eyes half-lidded, before regaining full consciousness and giving the Oomu a funny look. \u201cWell,\u201d said the seed-thief and the egg-killer, doubtfully. \u201cIf you say so . . . \u201d\nMeanwhile, the man turned his attention to their contact, \u201cthe zookeeper.\u201d There was plenty of paperwork to fill out and guarantees to be made, with a little greasing of palms to ensure that the Oomu would be given the utmost care during transition, and only the most up-to-date proven gene-therapy techniques\u2014none of this \u201cexperimental trials\u201d nonsense to tinker with the formula. Not at his old friend\u2019s expense.\nThe zookeeper then took the man and the kid on a tour of the enclosure, while the Oomu was settled in pretreatment chambers, where the team could gradually acclimate its body to an intermediate atmosphere before it underwent the de-conversion process to its pre-species form. Ten years ago, the science of de-conversion had still been unreliable, but in First Landing, before this last journey out, the man and the mollusk had witnessed news of the Institute\u2019s long-term success rate, and of the pre-atmospheric Zoo now being sustained 100% internally, by all manner of reclaimed lifeforms working in uncanny harmony. For the Institute, this was an achievement that would yield decades\u2019 worth of new technologies, but for any species that carried generational memory of a time before human trespass, it was much simpler: it was a way back to the world before.\n\u201cI imagine,\u201d said the zookeeper, once their tour had concluded, and the last payments had been addressed, \u201cThat you\u2019d like to see your friend one last time, before we begin.\u201d\nThe man had difficulty speaking, but a nod sufficed, and soon enough he was standing outside the massive medical tent where the Oomu was finally resting\u2014flopped out, in a most ungainly way, after so tense a journey across the barrens and the steppes. The zookeeper invited everyone else to step out, to give the man and the mollusk a moment, but when they did, everything remaining in the tent seemed so light that the man thought it might all, in an instant, blow away.\nThere were so many things, the man also realized upon entry, that he would never get to ask now, and even more that he could never hope to understand. To think that the Oomu had gone to such incredible lengths to try to live like him, to accommodate him, to allow for his human way of being to subsume its own . . . and yet, had he even stepped out half as much himself, in all that time? Had he even tried to bridge the gap between their species\u2019 comfort zones?\nNo wonder, thought the man, as he crouched before the snoozing Oomu and studied how trustingly its tentacles rested upon the tremendous see-through lump of its head: No wonder that those students, years ago, had clamored to know more about his time as a slaughterer, before he was a helper to the Oomu. Understanding the gene-therapy tools that he used in the field to rebirth other pre-species members was one thing . . . but how many of those bright young next-gens had really grasped yet that some of the most crucial transformations on Maia didn\u2019tinvolve gene therapy at all? How many comprehended that changes in, say, a first-gen\u2019s stricken conscience would always come from a far more complex set of forces than labs could ever quantify? And that, if recent settlements were going to stand a chance against coming challenges, they\u2019d all need more such stark transformations of heart and mind before genetic cures could even be considered a viable recourse?\nLeaning against the unconscious, sprawling body of his old companion, the man inhaled the pungent sweetness rolling off its sticky skin one last time, and whispered into it: \u201cThank you, you old lout. I promise, I\u2019ll tell them everything. I won\u2019t let the guilt go to waste a moment longer.\u201d\nAnd then, with a twinge of disappointment\u2014for the Oomu had made no sign of having heard him, or of otherwise being able to rouse itself for its own share of their goodbye\u2014the man rose with some difficulty to his feet and left the Oomu to its long-awaited journey home.\nThe procedure took eight days and was frightful for the man to follow from an observation booth, where he watched his old friend slowly shrink out of its shell and form a newer, more pliant one in its wake. A magnetic floor in the recovery chamber provided some of the counterforce needed to keep its fragile new body from being flattened during the process, while mild electrical stimuli allowed it to build the muscle responses necessary to adapt to the intense chemical interactions that awaited it in the pre-world atmosphere of the Zoo\u2019s main enclosure. There, it would find itself whipped about by dense clusters of volatile fumes while clinging to various floral structures, held together by a range of other faunal allies. It was an existence the man still couldn\u2019t comprehend the Oomu\u2019s longing to return to, though he tried his best to imagine it in a positive light while waiting. During the transition process, too, the zookeeper would drop in every now and then, to marvel at how strange and resilient these pre-species had been\u2014and how obvious it was why the terraforming ship had not considered the possibility of complex life here when assessing the viability of the planet\u2019s brutal atmosphere upon arrival.\nThe man said little amid these attempts at friendly banter\u2014or when the kid came to visit, chattering away about how the Institute had taken an interest in the whole seed business for frontier settlements; and how they\u2019d offered the kid a place in an internship program where such critical skills could be formalized for the benefit of the whole colony. The man did little at all, that is, except study the Oomu in the middle of its arduous de-conversion\u2014and start in his seat whenever it looked as though the Oomu . . . or rather, the pre-Oomu, its progenitor species . . . was in pain.\nThen, late on the eighth day, a supervisor looked into the camera and flashed an \u201call clear,\u201d before a team arrived to take the pre-Oomu, in its tiny enclosure, up to the Zoo. The man bolted upright and hurried to join them in time: the whole team at a minor \u201cairlock\u201d on one end of an enormous viewing window, through which the whirling opacity of pre-world atmosphere could be studied, even if individual forms and species clusters were often difficult to make out in the haze.\nThe man watched as his old friend was returned in a new form to a more familiar world.\nAnd then he watched through the reinforced glass for hours after, trying to catch a glimpse of his old friend thriving there.\nWith no luck. No luck at all.\nEventually, though, the lightest touch on his arm startled him, and he turned to see the kid studying him. He couldn\u2019t tell if he was dreaming, or if the kid was, or if they both were, when the kid said to him: \u201cShare it all, Mister. Nothing\u2019s ever gone completely when we do.\u201d\nBut probably it was just his exhaustion talking, because after what felt like the blink of an eye, the man looked up and the kid was gone. And the Zoo was as impenetrably opaque as ever.\nAnd the world outside Capitol City, which the man faced next, wincing at the sun with his hat held lightly in hand, was a place of more barrens than buildings, more frayed than close-knit networks . . . all of which, maybe now more than ever, seemed in sore need of a bridging of silences.\nHe set out for the station and its truths.\nCanadian by birth, M L Clark is now based in Colombia.

And then Tawus was there in his famous cloak, its bright fabric still fizzing and sparking from the prodigious leap, its hundred eyes, black, green, and gold, restlessly assaying the scene. Tawus had arrived, and, as always, everything else was dimmed and diminished by his presence.\n\u201cThis world was well made,\u201d Tawus said to himself with his accustomed mixture of jealousy and pride.\nHe savored the scents of lavender and thyme, the creakings and buzzings of insects, the gurgling of the stream.\n\u201cEvery detail works,\u201d he said, noticing a fat bumblebee, spattered with yellow pollen, launching herself into flight from a pink cistus flower. Passing the object he carried in his left hand to his right, Tawus stooped to take the flower stem between his left forefinger and thumb. \u201cEvery molecule, every speck of dust.\u201d\nPainfully and vividly, and in a way that had not happened for some time, he was reminded of the early days, the beginning, when, on the far side of this universe, he and the Six had awoken to find themselves in another garden wilderness like this one, ringed about by mountains.\nBack then things had felt very different. Tawus had known what Fabbro knew, had felt what Fabbro felt. His purposes had been Fabbro\u2019s purposes, and all his memories were from Fabbro\u2019s world, a world within which the created universe of Esperine was like a child\u2019s plaything, a scene carved into an ivory ball (albeit carved so exquisitely that its trees could sway in the wind and lose their leaves in autumn, its creatures live and die). Of course he had known quite well he was a copy of Fabbro and not Fabbro himself, but he was an exact copy, down to the smallest particle, the smallest thought, identical in every way except that he had been rendered in the stuff of Esperine, so that he could inhabit Fabbro\u2019s creation on Fabbro\u2019s behalf. He was a creation as Esperine was, but he could remember creating himself, just as he could remember creating Esperine, inside the device that Fabbro called Constructive Thought. Back then, Tawus had thought of Fabbro not as \u201che\u201d and \u201chim\u201d but as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme.\u201d\nAnd how beautiful this world had seemed then, how simple, how unsullied, how full of opportunities, how free of the ties and regrets and complications that had so hemmed in the life of Fabbro in the world outside.\nTawus released the pink flower, let it spring back among its hundred bright fellows, and stood up straight, returning the small object from his right hand to his dominant left. Then, with his quick gray eyes, he glanced back down the path, and up at the rocky ridges on either side. The peacock eyes looked with him, sampling every part of the visible and invisible spectrum.\n\u201cNo, Tawus, you are not observed,\u201d whispered the cloak, using the silent code with which it spoke to him through his skin.\n\u201cNot observed, perhaps,\u201d said Tawus, \u201cbut certainly expected.\u201d\nNow he turned southwards, towards the head of the valley, and began to walk. His strides were quick and determined but his thoughts less so. The gentle scents and sounds of the mountain valley continued to stir up vivid and troubling memories from the other end of time. He recalled watching the Six wake up, his three brothers and three sisters. They were also made in the likeness of Fabbro but they were, so to speak, reflections of him in mirrors with curved surfaces or colored glass, so that they were different from the original and from each other. Tawus remembered their eyes opening, his brother Balthazar first and then his sister Cassandra, and he remembered their spreading smiles as they looked around and simultaneously saw and remembered where they were, in this exquisite, benign and yet to be explored world, released forever from the cares and complications of Fabbro\u2019s life and from the baleful history of the vast and vacant universe in which Fabbro had been born.\nThey had been strangely shy of each other at first, even though they shared the same memories, the same history and the same sole parent. The three sisters in particular, in spite of Fabbro\u2019s androgynous and protean nature, felt exposed and uneasy in their unfamiliar bodies. But even the men were uncomfortable in their new skins. All seven were trying to decide who they were. It had been a kind of adolescence. All had felt awkward, all had been absurdly optimistic about what they could achieve. They had even made a pact with each other that they would always work together and always make decisions as a group.\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Tawus now wryly observed, and then he remembered, with a momentary excruciating pang, the fate of Cassandra, his proud and stubborn sister.\nBut they\u2019d believed in their agreement at the time and, having made it, all Seven had stridden out, laughing and talking all at once, under a warm sun not unlike this one, and on a path not unlike the one he was walking now, dressed so splendidly in his Peacock Cloak. He had no such cloak back then. They had been naked gods. They had begun to wrap themselves up only as they moved apart from one another: Cassandra in her Mirror Mantle, Jabreel in his Armor of Light, Balthazar in his Coat of Dreams . . . But the Peacock Cloak had been finest of all.\n\u201cI hear music,\u201d the cloak now whispered to him.\nTawus stopped and listened. He could only hear the stream, the grasshoppers, and the bees. He shrugged.\n\u201cHospitable of him, to lay on music to greet us.\u201d\n\u201cJust a peasant flute. A flute and goat bells.\u201d\n\u201cProbably shepherds up in the hills somewhere,\u201d said Tawus, resuming his stride.\nHe remembered how the seven of them came to their first human village, a village whose hundred inhabitants imagined that they had always lived there, tending their cattle and their sheep, and had no inkling that only a few hours before, they and their memories had been brought into being all at once by their creator Fabbro within the circuits of Constructive Thought, along with a thousand similar groups scattered over the planets of Esperine: the final touch, the final detail, in the world builder\u2019s ivory ball.\n\u201cThe surprise on their faces!\u201d Tawus murmured to himself, and smiled. \u201cTo see these seven tall naked figures striding down through their pastures.\u201d\n\u201cYou are tense,\u201d observed his cloak. \u201cYou are distracting yourself with thoughts of things elsewhere and long ago.\u201d\n\u201cSo I am,\u201d agreed Tawus, in the same silent code. \u201cI am not keen to think about my destination.\u201d\nHe looked down at the object he carried in his hand, smooth and white and intricate, like a polished shell. It was a gun of sorts, a weapon of his own devising. It did not fire mere bullets. It destroyed its targets by unraveling, within a chosen area, the laws that defined Esperine itself, and so reducing form to pure chaos.\n\u201cGive me a pocket to put this in,\u201d Tawus said.\nAt once the cloak made an opening to receive the gun, sealing itself up again when Tawus had withdrawn his hand.\n\u201cThe cloak can aim and shoot for me, if need be,\u201d Tawus muttered to himself.\nAnd the cloak\u2019s eyes winked, green and gold and black.\nThe valley turned a corner. There was an outcrop of harder rock. As he came round it, Tawus heard the music that his cloak, with its finely tuned senses, had detected some way back: a fluted melody, inexpertly played, and an arrhythmic jangling of crudely made bells.\nUp ahead of him three young children were minding a flock of sheep and goats, sheltering by a little patch of trees at a spot where a tributary brook cascaded into the main stream. A girl of nine or ten was playing panpipes. In front of her on a large stone, as if it were the two-seat auditorium of a miniature theater, two smaller children sat side by side: a boy of five or so and a little girl of three, cradling a lamb that lay across both their laps. The jangling bells hung from the necks of the grazing beasts.\nSeeing Tawus, the girl laid down her pipes and the two smaller children hastily set their lamb on the ground, stood up, and moved quickly to stand on either side of their sister with their hands in hers. All three stared at Tawus with wide unsmiling eyes. As he drew near, they ran forward and kissed his hand, first the older girl, then the boy, and finally the little three-year-old whose baby lips left a cool patch of moistness on his skin.\n\u201cYour face is familiar to them,\u201d the cloak silently observed. \u201cThey think they know you from before.\u201d\n\u201cAs we might predict,\u201d said Tawus. \u201cBut you they have never seen.\u201d\nThe children were astounded by a fabric on which the patterns were in constant motion, and by the animated peacock eyes. The boy reached out a grubby finger to touch the magical cloth.\n\u201cNo, Thomas!\u201d her sister scolded, slapping the child\u2019s hand away. \u201cLeave the gentleman\u2019s coat alone.\u201d\n\u201cNo harm,\u201d Tawus said gruffly, patting the girl on the head.\nAnd the cloak shook off the fragments of snot and dust that the child\u2019s fingers had left behind.\nTen minutes later Tawus turned and looked back at them. They were little more than dots in the mountain landscape but they were still watching him, still holding hands. Around them, unheeded, the sheep grazed with the goats.\nSuddenly, Tawus was vividly reminded of three other children he had once seen, of about the same ages. He had hardly given them a thought at the time, but now he clearly saw them in his mind: the younger two huddled against their sister, all three staring with white faces as Tawus and his army rolled through their burning village, their home in ruins behind them. It had been in a flat watery country called Meadow Lee. From his vantage point in the turret of a tank, Tawus could see its verdant water meadows stretching away for miles. Across the whole expanse of it buildings were burning and columns of dirty smoke were slowly staining the whole of the wide blue sky a glowering oily yellow.\nWhen was that, Tawus wondered? On which of the several different occasions when fighting had come to Meadow Lee? He thought it had been during one of his early wars against his brother Balthazar. But then he wondered whether perhaps it had been at a later stage when he was in an alliance with Balthazar against Jabreel.\n\u201cNeither,\u201d said the Peacock Cloak. \u201cIt was in the war all six of you waged against Cassandra, that time she banned chrome extraction in her lands.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t needlessly interfere. Offer guidance where necessary, head off obvious problems, but otherwise allow things to take their own course.\u201d\nIt would be wrong to say these were Fabbro\u2019s instructions to the Seven because he had never spoken to them. They were simply his intentions which they all knew because his memories were replicated in their own minds. When they encountered those first villagers, the Seven had greeted them, requested food and a place to rest that night, and asked if they were any matters they could assist with. They did not try and impose their views, or change the villager\u2019s minds about how the world worked or how to live their lives. That had all come later, along with the wars and the empires.\n\u201cBut did he really think we could go on like that forever?\u201d Tawus now angrily asked. \u201cWhat were we supposed to do all this time? Just wander around indefinitely, advising on a sore throat here, suggesting crop rotation there, but otherwise doing nothing with this world at all?\u201d\nThe Seven had begun to be different from Fabbro from the moment they awoke. And paradoxically it was Tawus, the one made most completely in Fabbro\u2019s likeness, who had moved most quickly away from Fabbro\u2019s wishes.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just be gardeners of this world,\u201d he had told his brothers and sisters, after they had visited a dozen sleepy villages, \u201cwe can\u2019t just be shepherds of its people, watching them while they graze. We will go mad. We will turn into imbeciles. We need to be able to build things, play with technology, unlock the possibilities that we know exist within this particular frame. We will need metals and fuels, and a society complex enough to extract and refine them. We will need ways of storing and transmitting information. There will need to be cities. On at least one planet, in at least one continent, we will have to organize a state. \u201d\nThe Six had all had reservations at first, to different degrees, and for slightly different reasons.\n\u201cJust give me a small territory then,\u201d Tawus had said, \u201ca patch of land with some people in it, to experiment and develop my ideas.\u201d\nIn his own little fiefdom he had adopted a new approach, not simply advising, but tempting and cajoling. He had made little labor-saving devices for his people and then spoken to them of machines that would do all their work for them. He had helped them make boats and then described spaceships that would make them masters of the stars. He had sown dissatisfaction in their minds and, within two years, he had achieved government, schools, metallurgy, sea-faring, and a militia. Seeing what he had achieved, the Six had fallen over one another to catch up.\n\u201cHow come they all followed me, if my path was so wrong?\u201d Tawus now asked.\n\u201cThey had no choice but to follow you,\u201d observed the Peacock Cloak, \u201cif they didn\u2019t wish to be altogether eclipsed.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is another way of saying that my way was in the end inevitable, because once it is chosen, all other ways become obsolete. To have obeyed Fabbro would simply have been to postpone what was sooner or later going to happen, if not led by me, then by one of the others, or even by some leader rising up from the Esperine people themselves.\u201d\nHe thought briefly again of the children in front of the ruined house, but then he turned another corner, and there was his destination ahead of him. It was a little island of domesticity amidst the benign wilderness of the valley, a small cottage with a garden and an orchard and a front gate, standing beside a lake.\n\u201cHe is outside,\u201d said the Peacock Cloak, whose hundred eyes could see through many different kinds of obstacles. \u201cHe is down beside the water.\u201d\nTawus came to the cottage gate. It was very quiet. He could hear the bees going back and forth from the wild thyme flowers, the splash of a duck alighting on the lake, the clopping of a wooden wind chime in an almond tree.\nHe raised his hand to the latch, then lowered it again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with me? Why hesitate?\u201d\nClop clop went the wind chimes.\n\u201cIt is always better to act,\u201d whispered the cloak through his skin, \u201cthat\u2019s what you asked me to remind you.\u201d\nTawus nodded. It was always better to act than to waste time agonizing. It was by acting that he had built a civilization, summoned great cities into being, driven through the technological changes that had taken this world from sleepy rural Arcadia to an age of interplanetary empires. It was by acting that he had prevailed over his six siblings, even when all six were ranged against him, for each one of them had been encumbered by Fabbro with gifts or traits of character more specialized than his own pure strength of will: mercy, imagination, doubt, ambivalence, detachment, humility.\nTrue, he had caused much destruction and misery but, after all, to act at all it was necessary to be willing to destroy. If he ever had a moment of doubt, he simply reminded himself that you couldn\u2019t take a single step without running the risk of crushing some small creeping thing, too small to be seen, going about its blameless life. You couldn\u2019t even breathe without the possibility of sucking in some tiny innocent from the air.\n\u201cThe city of X is refusing to accept our authority,\u201d his generals would say.\n\u201cThen raze it to the ground as we warned we would,\u201d he would answer without a moment\u2019s hesitation. And the hundred eyes would dart this way and that, like a scouting party sent out ahead of the battalions that were his own thoughts, looking for opportunities in the new situation that he had created, scooping out his next move and the move after that.\nThere had been times when his generals had stood there open-mouthed, astounded by his ruthlessness. But they did not question him. They knew it was the strength of his will that made him great, made him something more than they were.\n\u201cBut now,\u201d he said to himself bitterly, \u201cI seem to be having difficulty making up my mind about a garden gate.\u201d\n\u201cJust act,\u201d said the cloak, rippling against his skin in a way that was almost like laughter.\nTawus smiled. He would act on his own account and not on instructions from his clothes, but all the same he lifted his hand to the latch and this time opened it. He was moving forward again. And the eyes on his cloak shone in readiness.\nInside the gate the path branched three ways: right to the cottage, with the peaks of the valley\u2019s western ridge behind it, straight ahead to the little orchard and vegetable garden, left and eastward down to the small lake from which flowed the stream that he\u2019d been following. On the far side of the lake was the ridge of peaks that formed the valley\u2019s eastern edge. Some sheep were grazing on their slopes.\nClop clop went the wind chimes, and a bee zipped by his ear like a tiny racing car on a track.\nTawus looked down towards the lake.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d he murmured, spotting the small figure at the water\u2019s edge that the peacock eyes had already located, sitting on a log on a little beach, looking through binoculars at the various ducks and water birds out on the lake.\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m here,\u201d Tawus muttered angrily. \u201cYou know quite well I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed he does,\u201d the cloak confirmed. \u201cThe tension in his shoulders is unmistakable.\u201d\n\u201cHe just wants to make me the one that speaks first,\u201d Tawus said.\nSo he did not speak. Instead, when there were only a few meters between them, he stooped, picked up a stone, and lobbed it into the water over the seated figure\u2019s head.\nThe ripples spread out over the lake. Among some reeds at the far end of the little beach, a duck gave a low warning quack to its fellows. The man on the log turned \u2018round.\n\u201cTawus,\u201d he exclaimed, laying down his field glasses and rising to his feet with a broad smile of welcome, \u201cTawus, my dear fellow. It\u2019s been a very long time.\u201d\nThe likeness between the two of them would have been instantly apparent to any observer, even from a distance. They had the same lithe bearing, the same high cheekbones and aquiline nose, the same thick mane of gray hair. But the man by the water was simply dressed in a white shirt and white breeches, while Tawus still wore his magnificent cloak with its shifting patterns and its restless eyes. And Tawus stood stiffly while the other man, still smiling, extended his arms, as if he expected Tawus to fall into his embrace.\nTawus did not move or bend.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve put it about that you\u2019re Fabbro himself,\u201d he said, \u201cor so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\nThe other man nodded.\n\u201cWell, yes. Of course there\u2019s a sense in which I am a copy of Fabbro as you are, since this body is an analogue of the body that Fabbro was born with, rather than the body itself. But the original Fabbro ceased to exist when I came into being, so my history and his have never branched away from each another, as yours and his did, but are arranged sequentially in a single line, a single story. So yes, I\u2019m Fabbro. All that is left of Fabbro is me, and I have finally entered my own creation. It seemed fitting, now that both Esperine and I are coming to a close.\u201d\nTawus considered this for a moment. He had an impulse to ask about the world beyond Esperine, that vast and ancient universe in which Fabbro had been born and grown up. For of course Fabbro\u2019s was the only childhood that Tawus could remember, Fabbro\u2019s the only youth. He was naturally curious to know how things had changed out there and to hear news of the people from Fabbro\u2019s past: friends, collaborators, male and female lovers, children (actual biological children: children of Fabbro\u2019s body and not just his mind).\n\u201cAren\u2019t those memories a distraction?\u201d the cloak asked him through his skin. \u201cIsn\u2019t that stuff his worry and not yours?\u201d\nTawus nodded.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he silently agreed, \u201cand to ask about it would muddy the water. It would confuse the issue of worlds and their ownership.\u201d\nHe looked Fabbro in the face.\n\u201cYou had no business coming into Esperine,\u201d he told him. \u201cWe renounced your world and you in turn gave this world to us to be our own. You\u2019ve no right to come barging back in here now, interfering, undermining my authority, undermining the authority of the Five.\u201d\n(It was Five now, not Six, because of Cassandra\u2019s annihilation in the Chrome Wars.)\nFabbro smiled.\n\u201cSome might say you\u2019d undermined each other\u2019s authority quite well without my help, with your constant warring, and your famines and your plagues and all of that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a matter for us, not you.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly so,\u201d said Fabbro. \u201cPossibly so. But in my defense, I have tried to keep out of the way since I arrived in this world.\u201d\n\u201cYou let it be known you were here, though. That was enough.\u201d\nFabbro tipped his head from side to side, weighing this up.\n\u201cEnough? Do you really think so? Surely for my mere presence to have had an impact, there would have had to be something in Esperine that could be touched by it. There had to be a me-shaped hole. Otherwise wouldn\u2019t I just be some harmless old man up in the mountains?\u201d\nHe sat down on the log again\n\u201cCome and sit with me, Tawus.\u201d He patted a space beside him. \u201cThis is my favorite spot, my grandstand seat. There\u2019s always something happening here. Day. Night. Evening. Morning. Sun. Rain. Always something new to see.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re content with sheep and ducks,\u201d said Tawus, and did not sit.\nFabbro watched him. After a few seconds, he smiled.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a coat you\u2019ve got there,\u201d he observed.\nMany of the peacock eyes turned towards him, questioningly. Others glanced with renewed vigor in every other direction, as if suspecting diversionary tactics.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d Fabbro went on, \u201cthat it can protect you, make you invisible, change your appearance, allow you to leap from planet to planet without going through the space in between. I\u2019ve been told that it can tell you of dangers, and draw your attention to things you might wish to know, and even give you counsel, as perhaps it\u2019s doing now. That is some coat!\u201d\n\u201cHe is seeking to rile you,\u201d the cloak silently whispered. \u201cYou asked me to warn you if he did this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me Fabbro,\u201d Tawus said, \u201cI am your copy not your child. You know that to construct this cloak I simply needed to understand the algorithm on which Esperine is founded, and you know that I do understand it every bit as well as you.\u201d\nFabbro nodded.\n\u201cYes of course. I\u2019m just struck by the different ways in which we\u2019ve used that understanding. I used it to make a more benign world than my own, within which countless lives could, for a limited time, unfold and savour their existence. You used it to set yourself apart from the rest of this creation, insulate yourself, wrap yourself up in your own little world of one.\u201d\n\u201cI could easily have made another complete world as you did, as perfect as Esperine in every way. But any world that I made would necessarily exist within this frame, your frame, and therefore still be a part of Esperine, even if it\u2019s equal or it\u2019s superior in design. Do you really wonder that I chose instead to find a way of setting myself apart?\u201d\nFabbro did not answer. He gave a half-shrug, then looked out at the lake.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not come here to apologize,\u201d Tawus said. \u201cI hope you know that. I have no regrets about my rebellion.\u201d\nFabbro turned towards him.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, I know why you came. You came to destroy me. And of course it is possible to destroy me now that I\u2019m here in Esperine, just as it was possible for you and the others to destroy your sister Cassandra when she tried to place a brake on your ambitions. In order to achieve her destruction you found a way of temporarily modifying that part of the original algorithm that protected the seven of you from physical harm. I assume you have a weapon with you now that works in the same way. I guess it\u2019s hidden somewhere in that cloak.\u201d\n\u201cBut knowing it doesn\u2019t help him,\u201d whispered the cloak through Tawus\u2019s skin.\nAnother duck had alighted on the water, smaller and differently colored than to the ones that were already there. (It had black wings and a russet head.) Fabbro picked up his binoculars and briefly observed it, before laying them down again, and turning once more to his recalcitrant creation.\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d he said, \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t led to expect an apology. They told me the six of you set out in this direction armed to the teeth and in a great fury. You had a formidable space fleet with you, they said, and huge armies at your back. They told me that cloak of yours was fairly fizzing and sparking with pent-up energy. They said that it turned all the air around you into a giant lens, so that you were greatly magnified and seemed to your followers to be a colossus blazing with fire, striding out in front of them as they poured through the interplanetary gates.\u201d\nTawus snatched a stone up from the beach and flung it out over the water.\n\u201cYou are allowing yourself to be put on the defensive,\u201d warned the Peacock Cloak. \u201cBut remember that he has no more power than you. In fact he has far less. Thanks to your foresight in creating me, you are the one who is protected, not him. And, unlike him, you are armed.\u201d\nTawus turned to face Fabbro.\n\u201cYou set us inside this world,\u201d he said, \u201cthen turned away and left us to it. And that was fine, that was the understanding from the beginning. That was your choice and ours. But now, when it suits you because you are growing old, you come wandering in to criticize what we have achieved. What right do you have to do that, Fabbro? You were absent when the hard decisions were being made. How can you know that you would have done anything different yourself?\u201d\n\u201cWhen have I criticized you? When have I claimed I would have done something different?\u201d\nFabbro gave a short laugh.\n\u201cThink, Tawus, think. Stop indulging your anger and think for a moment about the situation we are in. How could I say that I would have done something different? What meaning could such a claim possibly have when you and I were one and the same person at the beginning of all this?\u201d\n\u201cWe began as one person, but we are not one person now. Origins are not everything.\u201d\nFabbro looked down at his hands, large and long-fingered as Tawus\u2019s were.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI agree. It must be so. Otherwise there would only ever be one thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou made your choice,\u201d Tawus said. \u201cYou should have stuck to it and stayed outside.\u201d\n\u201cHence the armies, hence the striding like a colossus at their head, hence the plan to seek me out and destroy me?\u201d\nFabbro looked up at Tawus with an expression that was half a frown and half a smile.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tawus said. \u201cHence all those things.\u201d\nFabbro nodded.\n\u201cBut where are the armies now?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere is the striding colossus? Where is this \u201cwe\u201d you speak about? An awful lot of the energy has dissipated, has it not? The nearer you got to me, the faster it all fell away. They\u2019ve all come back to me, you know, your armies, your brothers, your sisters. They have all come to me and asked to become part of me once again.\u201d\nSome of the eyes on the cloak glanced inquiringly upwards at Tawus\u2019s face, others remained fixed on Fabbro, who had lifted his binoculars and was once again looking at bird life out on the lake.\n\u201cFire the gun and you will be Fabbro,\u201d the Peacock Cloak told its master. \u201cYou will be the one to whom the armies and the Five have all returned. Your apparent isolation, your apparent diminishment, is simply an artifact of there being two of you here, two rival versions of the original Fabbro. But you are the one I shield and not him. You are the one with the weapon.\u201d\nFabbro laid down his field glasses and turned towards the man who still stood stiffly apart from him.\n\u201cCome Tawus,\u201d he coaxed gently, patting the surface of the log beside him. \u201cCome and sit down. I won\u2019t bite, I promise. It\u2019s almost the end, after all. Surely we\u2019re both too old, and it\u2019s too late in the day, for us to be playing this game?\u201d\nTawus picked up another stone and flung it out into the lake. The ripples spread over the smooth surface. Quack quack went the ducks near to where it fell, and one of them fluttered its wings and half-flew a few yards further off, scrabbling at the surface with its feet.\n\u201cThe armies are irrelevant,\u201d Tawus said. \u201cThe Five are irrelevant. You know that. For these purposes they are simply fields of force twisting and turning between you and me. The important thing is not that they have come back to you. No. The important thing is that I have not.\u201d\nFabbro watched his face and did not speak\n\u201cI gave their lives purpose,\u201d Tawus went on, beginning to pace restlessly up and down. \u201cI gave them progress. I gave them freedom. I gave them cities and nations. I gave them hope. I gave them something to believe in and somewhere to go. You just made a shell. You made a clockwork toy. It was me, through my rebellion, that turned it into a world. Why else did they all follow me?\u201d\nHe looked around for another stone, found a particularly big one, and lobbed it out even further across the lake. It sent a whole flock of ducks squawking into the air.\n\u201cPlease sit down, Tawus. I would really like you to sit with me.\u201d\nTawus did not respond. Fabbro shrugged and looked away.\n\u201cWhy exactly do you think they followed you?\u201d he asked after a short time.\n\u201cBecause I was in your image but I wasn\u2019t you,\u201d Tawus answered at once. \u201cI was like you, but at the same time I was one of them. Because I stood up for this world as a world in its own right, belonging to those who lived in it, and not simply as a plaything of yours.\u201d\nFabbro nodded.\n\u201cWhich was what I wanted you to do,\u201d he said.\nThe day was moving into evening. The eastern ridge of peaks across the water glowed gold from the sun that was setting opposite them in the west.\n\u201cAfter the sun sets,\u201d Fabbro calmly said, \u201cthe world will end. Everyone has come back to me. It\u2019s time that you and I brought things to a close.\u201d\nTawus was caught off guard. So little time. It seemed he had miscalculated somewhat, not having the benefit of the Olympian view that Fabbro had enjoyed until recently, looking in from outside of Constructive Thought. He had not appreciated that the end was quite as close as that.\nBut he was not going to show his surprise.\n\u201cI suppose you are going to lecture me,\u201d he said, \u201cabout the suffering I caused with my wars.\u201d\nAs he spoke he was gathering up stones from the beach, hastily, almost urgently, as if they had some vital purpose.\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to go on about all the children whose parents I took from them,\u201d he said.\nHe threw a stone. Splash. Quack.\n\u201cAnd the rapes that all sides perpetrated,\u201d he said, throwing a stone again, \u201cand the tortures,\u201d throwing yet another stone, \u201cand the massacres.\u201d\nHe had run out of stones. He turned angrily towards Fabbro.\n\u201cI suppose you want to castigate me for turning skilled farmers and hunters and fishermen into passive workers in dreary city streets, spending their days manufacturing things they didn\u2019t understand, and their evenings staring at images on screens manufactured for them by someone else.\u201d\nHe turned away, shaking his head, looking around vaguely for more stones.\n\u201cI used to think about you looking in from outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we had wars, when we were industrializing and getting people off the land, all of those difficult times. I used to imagine you judging me, clucking your tongue, shaking your head. But you try and bring progress to a world without any adverse consequences for anyone. You just try it.\u201d\n\u201cCome on Tawus,\u201d Fabbro begged him. \u201cSit with me. You know you\u2019re not really going to destroy me. You know you can\u2019t really reverse the course that this world, like any world, must take. It isn\u2019t only your armies that have fallen away from you, Tawus, it is your own steely will. It has no purpose any more.\u201d\nBut the cloak offered another point of view.\n\u201cDestroy Fabbro and you will become him,\u201d it silently whispered. \u201cThen you can put back the clock itself.\u201d\nTawus knew it was true. Without Fabbro to stop him, he could indeed postpone the end, not forever, but for several more generations. And he could rule Esperine during that time as he had never ruled before, with no Fabbro outside, no one to look in and judge him. The cloak was right. He would become Fabbro, he would become Fabbro and Tawus both at once. It was possible, and what was more, it had been his reason for coming here in the first place.\nHe glanced down at Fabbro. He looked quickly away again across the lake. Ten whole seconds passed.\nThen Tawus reached slowly for the clasp of the Peacock Cloak. He hesitated. He lowered his hand. He reached for the clasp again. His fingers were trembling because of the contradictory signals they were receiving from his brain, but finally he unfastened the cloak, removing it slowly and deliberately at first, and then suddenly flinging it away from himself, as if he feared it might grab hold and refuse to let him go. It snagged on a branch of a small oak tree and hung there, one corner touching the stony ground. Still its clever eyes darted about, green and gold and black. It was watching Tawus, watching Fabbro. As ever, it was observing everything, analyzing everything, evaluating options and possibilities. But yet, as is surely proper in a garment hanging from a tree, it had no direction of its own, it had no separate purpose.\nAcross the lake, the eastern hills shone. There were sheep up there grazing, bathed in golden light that picked them out against the mountainside. But the hills on the western side were also making their presence felt, for their shadows were reaching out like long fingers over the two small figures by the lake, one standing, one seated on the log, neither one speaking. Without his cloak, in a simple white shirt and white breeches, Tawus looked even more like Fabbro. A stranger could not have told them apart.\nA flock of geese came flying in from a day of grazing lower down the valley. They honked peaceably to one another as they splashed down on the softly luminous water.\n\u201cWhen I was walking up here,\u201d Tawus said at last, \u201cI met three children, and they reminded me of some other children I saw once, or glimpsed anyway, when I was riding past in a tank. It was in the middle of a war and I didn\u2019t pay much heed to them at the time. I was too busy listening to reports and giving orders. But for some reason they stuck in my mind.\u201d\nHe picked up a stone, tossed it half-heartedly out into the lake.\n\u201cTheir ruined home lay behind them,\u201d he went on, \u201cand in the ruins, most probably, lay the burned corpses of their parents. Not that their parents would have been combatants or anything. It was just that their country, their sleepy land of Meadow Lee, had temporarily become the square on the chessboard that the great game was focused on, the place where the force fields happened to intersect. Pretty soon the focal point would be somewhere else and the armies would move on from Meadow Lee and forget all about it until the next time. But those children wouldn\u2019t forget would they? Not while they still lived. That day would stain and darken their entire lives, like the smoke stained and darkened their pretty blue sky. What could be worse, when you think about it, than filling up a small mind with such horrors? That, in a way, is also creating a world. It is creating a small but perfect hell.\u201d\nHe snatched up yet another stone, but, with a swift graceful movement, Fabbro had jumped up and grasped Tawus\u2019s wrist to stop him throwing it.\n\u201cEnough, Tawus, enough. The rebellion is over. The divisions you brought about have all been healed. The killed and the killers. The tortured and the torturers. The enslaved and the enslavers. All are reconciled. All have finally come back.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone but me.\u201d\nTawus let the stone fall to the ground. His creator released his hand, sat down again on the log and once again patted the space beside him.\nTawus looked at Fabbro, and at the log, and back at Fabbro again. And, finally, he sat down.\nThe two of them were completely in shadow now, had become shadows themselves. The smooth surface of the lake still glowed with soft pinks and blues, but the birds on its surface had become shadows too, warm living shadows, softly murmuring to one another in their various watery tongues, suspended between the glowing lake and the glowing sky. And more shadow was spreading up the hillside opposite, engulfing the sheep one after another, taking them from golden prominence to peaceful obscurity. Soon only the peaks still dipped into the stream of sunlight that was pouring horizontally far above the heads of the two men.\n\u201cEveryone but you,\u201d Fabbro mildly agreed, reaching down for his binoculars once more so he could look at some unusual duck or other that he\u2019d noticed out on the water.\nTawus glanced across at his Peacock Cloak, dangling from its tree. That tawdry thing, he suddenly thought. Why did I choose to hide myself in that? The cloak was shimmering and glittering, giving off its own light in the shadow, and its eyes were still brightly shining, as if it was attempting to be a rival to those last brilliant rays of sunlight, or to outglow the softly glowing lake. It was all that was left of Tawus\u2019s empire, his will, his power.\nHe turned to Fabbro.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get the wrong idea,\u201d he began. \u201cI don\u2019t in any way regret what . . . \u201d\nThen he broke off. He passed his still trembling hand over his face.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Fabbro,\u201d he said in a completely different voice. \u201cI\u2019ve messed it all up haven\u2019t I? I\u2019ve been a fool. I\u2019ve spoiled everything.\u201d\nFabbro lowered his binoculars and patted Tawus on the hand.\n\u201cWell maybe you have. I\u2019m not sure. But you\u2019re quite right, you know, that I did just create a shell, and it was your rebellion that made it a world. Deep down I always knew that rebellion was necessary. I must have done, mustn\u2019t I, since whatever you did came from somewhere inside me? Rebellion was necessary. I\u2019d just hoped that in Esperine it would somehow take a different path.\u201d\nOnly the highest tips of the peaks were still shining gold. They were like bright orange light bulbs. And then, one by one, they went out.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, June, 2010.\nChris Beckett's short stories began appearing in 1990, with \"A Matter of Survival\" in Interzone, and have since been published regularly on both sides of the Atlantic.

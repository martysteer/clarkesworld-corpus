The pale yellow carries with it the scent of spring, a slice of blue sky, the slow curl of white curtains into a sunlit room. This place is far away; the ground shakes underfoot, rattling ash over paint, and she\u2019s running, running with her heart in her throat and her hands wrapped around her rifle. Rifle pressed into breast the way Lottie should be. Seven strides to the alley\u2014seven strides and she\u2019s in, in and sliding down into the shadows. Her gaze latches on to Ginger across the street in another alley. Ginger prefers gunfire to silence; it tells them exactly where the enemy is.\n \u201cMama?\u201d\n Cardee pushes the small voice in her head away. That voice is as distant as that calm yellow room. Ginger is in the here and now: Ginger and Bret and Stills, and the goddamned little shadow they\u2019re chasing. Children in warzones aren\u2019t a surprise, not now, but the first time she\u2019d seen one, Cardee recoiled. They\u2019re often lures, she knows; the urge to follow the small ones and haul them out of the wreckage is hard-wired. She wants to carry them somewhere safer. She doesn\u2019t know where that might be.\n Ginger breaks position to follow the kid into the tangle of narrow streets hung with paper lanterns from a long ago celebration. Blue, green, and\u2014\n \u201cGin\u2014\u201d\n Cardee swallows the rest of her protest and at Bret\u2019s snapped curse, runs. Runs across the street into the alley Ginger had occupied. Of the child, she has the impression of ratty clothes, bare feet, and knows the latter are the deal breaker for Ginger.\n The first child they\u2019d rescued had ruined feet from walking through the debris; Ginger spent days applying salve to them, only to have the doc tell them the feet couldn\u2019t be saved. It makes the others harder\u2014that kid hadn\u2019t been a lure, he just needed out. He only planted hope inside Ginger when it came to every other kid.\n The hardware store still stands, windows unbroken in their frames. Cardee draws up short, listens for Ginger. There is a sharp hiss and the thunder of retreating boots. She shoulders her way into the store, amid stripped shelves. Binned nails, hammers, and planks of wood stand in one corner but\u2014\n A slamming door erupts into flame a second later. The air is sharp with flying nails and hammers and Cardee drops to the floor, rolling until she\u2019s under the nearest shelf. The shelf buckles with a second explosion and is shredded away with a third. Blood splatters the concrete floor amid the burning refuse, as if dripping from Cardee\u2019s own face, but she can\u2019t make sense of it.\n \u201cMama.\u201d\n She gives in to the voice. \u201cI know, baby.\u201d\n Cardee slides the warm cloth over Lottie\u2019s temple, removing the haze of blood. Small brown face, so like her own. Wide black eyes blink up at her, tight sepia curls framing smooth apple cheeks. Cardee leans in to look at the wound.\n \u201cJ-James d-dared me t-to jump,\u201d Lottie whispers, anguished.\n \u201cJust a little scrape.\u201d Cardee drops a kiss on Lottie\u2019s forehead, reaches past her for the wipes and dermal sealer. She\u2019s seen worse on the battlefield, but not worse on her daughter and though she forces a smile, the injury bothers her. Bothers her in a way she can\u2019t quantify\u2014\n Nails, there were nails\u2014\n Cardee grits her teeth together, steadies her hands. This is now, not then, and Lottie flinches at the antiseptic wipe and then the cool flow of sealer.\n \u201cGreen b-bandage?\u201d\n \u201cYou like all that green, don\u2019t you?\u201d But Cardee doesn\u2019t protest her daughter\u2019s choice. She presses the bandage over the wound, even though it\u2019s not needed with the sealer already there.\n \u201cAll that green, Mama.\u201d Lottie\u2019s smile ripples and through a haze of smoke, looks green in the corners. Cardee runs her thumb across it as Lottie lifts a hand to touch Cardee\u2019s own temple where green lights pulse.\n \u201cFindar.\u201d\n That\u2019s her name. She knows it\u2019s her name, because she remembers stealing it from Ross. He thought he gave it to her on the lakeshore with the trees dipping low into the water and all their friends gathered close, but ten years on, she still feels like she stole it. Wood violets, wild roses, my black-eyed girls.\n \u201cFindar!\u201d\n Her fingers come away from the sky bloodied; they are snatched from her, tied against her side and she\u2019s flying, airborne through the debris, away from Ginger and the small figure they were chasing. Cardee opens her mouth to tell Ginger the kid is there, just there beyond that pile of debris, and there\u2019s another explosion. The world rocks and green sky tips then vanishes altogether as gloved hands draw her inside a warm, dark space, and she hears the chop-chop-chop of angel wings, as they arc high into the sky thirteen klicks from base.\n Thirteen nails, doc says and drops the last into the basin. It falls with a clink, a fleck of blood, and Cardee sees faces in the red: Ross and the priest and if she closes her eyes she can feel Ross\u2019s palm against hers. Palmers\u2019 kiss was holy she had told him, but now there\u2019s only the chatter of doc and his team and when these voices change, Cardee can\u2019t latch onto why. The light takes on a clear quality, the smoke of the hotspot gone, and the bite of the stitcher is almost sweet as it crawls over her bare scalp. It tickles; the sensation tells her she\u2019s alive.\n The stitcher tiptoes over scalp while doc settles the VET into its place against the ruin of her hippocampus and he\u2019s talking all the while, words that slide over Cardee\u2019s consciousness and away. She knows he\u2019s watching a screen while he talks, to see what her brain does with each word. Volatile, he calls the device. Like it might explode the way the hardware store did\u2014\n Ragged clothing and bare feet. Oh, bare feet. Cardee can feel the soft curve of Lottie\u2019s toes against her chin.\n Emotive transistor, doc says and his fingers are cool against her temple though warmth seems to sink into her skin, into her bones. Her left eye blossoms with sudden heat, the sting of salt.\n Do that again, doc bids her.\n Cardee doesn\u2019t know what he means, but she thinks about Lottie\u2019s toes, small and brown and sweet like sugar, and the salt stings her again as doc praises her. Good, good, he says, and Cardee swallows a sob. The green light floods his palm then fades as Cardee quiets. It won\u2019t be perfect, he says, but\u2014\n \u2014what is in this world, Ross says and his mouth moves over Cardee\u2019s and she smiles, knowing neither one of them really wants perfection. They have always been a jumble and she\u2019s content to stay that way. The idea that he would marry her when she means to serve their country is what sinks its hooks into her. That he would stay, no matter where they or she went, and when they go to the lakeshore all those years later and she tells him about the child, there is a quiet wonder in his eyes.\n He is barefoot, jean cuffs rolled up and wet, and he tangles wild roses into Cardee\u2019s hair. They\u2019re pink like his tongue and later she presses these roses into a book which will sit on a shelf beside a box full of letters with different postmarks, all the places she has been. The book will sit until Lottie pulls it down at age three and scatters the flat, dried bundle everywhere. A year later, they still find bits of roses in the corners.\n \u201cMade it just the way you like,\u201d Ross says, and leads Cardee to the corner where he\u2019s placed her favorite chair with its worn arms and the quilt her grandmother pieced together. A tablet rests on the table beside an electric kettle which she knows holds Earl Grey. He helps her into the chair and she\u2019s slow, like she can\u2019t remember how to move, but the VET remembers for her, guiding her into the chair\u2019s familiar hold.\n A ring peeks out from Ross\u2019s shirt collar as he moves, three strands of Irish gold braided together. His grandmother\u2019s, but now hers, given to him so it couldn\u2019t be taken even if her finger did feel bare without it. A thing to come back to he had joked, and as it slips free now he tucks it away before she can touch it. His brow creases. Don\u2019t worry about that now, he tells her.\n Ross\u2019s hands are tentative as he settles her feet on the ottoman, as he pulls up the quilt and then reaches for her cup. The cup is sunrise orange and the tea floods it in a brown, steaming rush. Cardee draws in a breath and watches as Ross\u2019s face is erased. The room seems to fold itself away under the rising steam and she\u2019s in an alley again, watching a small, barefoot figure flit through the debris.\n That was then, she tells herself, and tries to pull the walls of her room upright. Plaster and buttercream and not ash, but there\u2019s only stone and choking smoke in this place. Stills presses a new magazine into her hand and she slots it into her rifle before running, running after Ginger through the debris, after the small barefoot form.\n This is before, she knows. Before the hardware store. Three days? No\u2014three months, months and this is the first kid, the one doc won\u2019t be able to save.\n Images shutter like an old film reel through her mind, guided by the VET in her temple. That was then but it\u2019s also now, and Cardee follows Ginger over fallen stones that used to be walls that used to be houses that used to be homes.\n There is a tall figure in a far door lifting a gun. Cardee lifts hers first and the figure crumples with a shriek, doesn\u2019t move. Ginger is twelve steps from the kid, the boy, and Cardee knows she herself is twenty-five steps from the figure she shot down.\n She will walk those steps, check the body, take the gun. She will. She already has.\n Twenty-seven steps from the second figure who emerges behind the first, a young man in enemy colors, and he lifts his gun. Cardee takes him down too; he falls to his knees as if in prayer, then topples over.\n Ginger tackles the boy, wrestles him to the ground and pins his arms behind him. Where are the others, she demands\u2014where! And he says he doesn\u2019t know\u2014but he does and these kids just don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t want to leave these streets that are home, home even though war has claimed them. Home, smeared into his cheeks and his bare, bloodied feet. Ginger hefts the boy, throws him over her shoulder, and they\u2019re out, running as shells rain from the sky.\n Cardee turns circles in wet grass. Don\u2019t worry about getting wet, she tells Lottie, and they\u2019re out, running as the rain pours from the summer sky. Lottie shrieks, like she might melt under the rain because she\u2019s so sweet, but Cardee holds her hand and feels her daughter relax. The shriek turns to a laugh and Lottie is no longer worried about her dress, because it will dry on the laundry line when the sun comes out again. She twirls and Cardee watches those toes as they mash into the mud. Hot cocoa later, she thinks, but it\u2019s already been later, that cocoa long drunk.\n This is memory, Cardee tells herself, and pulls hard, hard enough to lift the walls of her room back into place. This was now. Her room, where nine year old Lottie now sits, bundled on the ottoman. Lottie watches everything and Cardee watches back. Lottie is taller than she remembers, all long arms and legs, her hair longer and worn pulled up on the top of her head with a mass of bright green and blue ribbons. A clumsy knot, her father\u2019s work.\n \u201cMama?\u201d\n Cardee offers her hand for holding. The hand Lottie offers is larger than Cardee remembers, long slim fingers. Palm to palm they sit until Lottie makes a sound, a sound like she wants to cry but is too old for such things now. Lottie curls into her mother\u2019s lap, the way a nut curls into its shell, and she\u2019s crying. Don\u2019t w-worry about getting w-wet.\n There was rain, Cardee thinks, rain like nails, and she lifts a hand to feel the line of her skull, whole now but still shorn, wrapped under a bright cloth. Lottie shudders and Cardee hauls her closer.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. It helps mama remember.\u201d\n Lottie\u2019s fingers press cool against Cardee\u2019s temple, gentle over the soft light which flickers beneath the skin. Of course it was green. Lottie\u2019s mouth lifts in a tentative smile at the sight and\u2014\n \u2014it\u2019s doc looking at her for the first time after the surgery, his face clear and sharp and framed by all that brilliant white light. Cardee stares the way she stared at Ross when he proposed, like she can\u2019t understand or believe it. That was then, she tells herself, but doc tells her it won\u2019t be perfect. It\u2019ll run, but it\u2019ll stutter, too, like a tank you need kick every now and then. Cardee doesn\u2019t want it; Cardee can\u2019t be Cardee without it, though. She understands that. The VET can reach pieces of her memory that she no longer can.\n \u201cMama.\u201d\n That voice hauls her back to the yellow room with its curtains, with its small nut of a girl. Cardee doesn\u2019t remember Lottie this way and the VET hums hard, as if trying to reconcile two different pieces of paperwork. The numbers don\u2019t add up. Small Lottie waving goodbye in the driveway, Ross and Gamma at her side; this is the last image of Lottie the VET can give her. The Lottie who hasn\u2019t outgrown the shoes that Cardee saw in the donation box as they came inside today. The Lottie who hasn\u2019t yet flung herself off the swing at a friend\u2019s dare.\n \u201cI\u2019m here, baby.\u201d\n Always that: baby. Cardee clings to the word, the way she does to her daughter. She\u2019s here, but she\u2019s not. Part of her is still in those streets. The VET pulls up her most recent memory, running with it, because that\u2019s what it does. Running\u2014\n Feet hit the ground hard as she and the fireteam seek another kid. There were two down here, two and\u2014\n Two kids emerge from the rubble, rifles cocked and drawn on the team. Cardee draws up, but doesn\u2019t lower her rifle. These kids are taller, but still young. Eight, nine. Lottie\u2019s age now, she thinks and something inside her turns over. This was not now, this was then, but something inside her hides its face.\n \u201cIn-de-pen-dents?\u201d one of the kids asks, drawing the word out into four hard syllables.\n Bret strides forward, kicks up clouds of dust in the ruined street. \u201cCo-a-li-tion,\u201d he spits and the world erupts.\n \u201cWrong answer!\u201d\n They don\u2019t want to go, this band of kids, and they fight to stay. Cardee screams at Bret to back off, but it\u2019s too late. She smells the blood, the gunpowder, and feels the sudden press of a knife against her side. Before her, the scene unfolds as it did before, the way she remembers, down to the taste of sweat on her lip. Only one of the kids gets away. Escapes to run and set a trap in the hardware store where nails\u2014 Where nails\u2014\n Memory stutters. Her mind goes blank.\n \u201cMama?\u201d\n Cardee feels the touch of fingers on her face, pressing gentle and then with more insistence. She blinks and looks at the girl in her lap, but cannot recall her name. Does not know why she\u2019s here. Bret would be here soon. Bret and Ginger and\u2014\n \u201cMama!\u201d\n But the only children she knows live in the streets. Rubble rats, sand kids, some used as weapons, others in need of rescue. This girl is whole and clean. A green bandage clings to her temple, but her feet are uninjured. Not bloody or cut and Cardee can\u2019t process it. The girl pushes away. Those small feet thunder away.\n \u201cDa! Daaaaa!\u201d\n Cardee blinks, the room around her unfamiliar. She wanders, touching walls that should be made of ash. Why is there a ceiling and how can there be windows without cracks? Just when it seems the walls might crumble to ruin under her fingers, there\u2019s another hand, this one drawing her own from the wall. Cardee whimpers because part of her wants to see these walls fall down. It\u2019s what she knows, jagged lines against smoky sky.\n There is mark upon one wall, where a frame used to rest. A frame that held a photograph, she thinks. Fingers trace this line, but there is no frame. Her eyes sweep the room and she\u2019s moving past the man, rifling through drawers, careless with everything that isn\u2019t the frame that belongs upon the wall. Careless until her fingers close around a bundle of letters. Handwritten, from far away places, they smell like ash and home both. Tears smudge the writing\u2014before or after the sending and does it matter? Pushed to the back of the drawer, she thinks that is what matters. More letters and more and then at the bottom, the frame. The photograph.\n It\u2019s a face half familiar, dark and proud, and by her side there stands a man as pale as she is dark. That man, she thinks, looking up at him now, then back to the photograph. Behind them sprawls a lake and the shore is tangled with long grasses, willowed trees. Cardee lifts the frame and brings it to the wall, but there is no nail.\n There were nails\u2014\n \u201cCardee. Beloved.\u201d His hand covers hers.\n \u201cThe team?\u201d she asks.\n He swallows hard. \u201cSafe.\u201d\n A bright, striped flag across the length of a casket. The image is gone as quickly as it comes.\n The man guides her toward the chair in the corner, with its quilt and tablet and cooling tea. \u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d\n Cardee shakes her head and a deep pain flares at her temple, burning down her spine. She presses the framed photograph into her lap. \u201cVolatile,\u201d she whispers. Explosive.\n \u201cVolatile Emotive Transistor,\u201d he says, and there\u2019s something in his eyes, something Cardee cannot name. His hand tightens on hers, shaking, and the line of a ring presses into her bones. His ring. His free hand lifts, to trace her temple where green lights have stilled.\n Warmth and salt burn her eyes. \u201cI should . . . \u201d Her head comes up. Her attention narrows on the doorway. There should be a figure there and she should have her rifle, but there isn\u2019t and she doesn\u2019t. A tank needs kicking, she thinks, but doesn\u2019t know why. She looks back to the man. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n He eases his hold on her, hand sliding down, around, so that palm presses to palm. Cardee\u2019s breath hisses and fresh fire courses through her body. Old pathways blazing into new.\n \u201cWood violets, wild roses, my black-eyed girls,\u201d he says.\n She smells the lake now and the willows brush her shoulders as they walk, hand in hand through the almost-cold grass underfoot. He offers her a tangle of violets and one of roses and then a braided ring, a ring that slides onto her finger as though it belongs. The way he slides it onto her finger now, warm from his own body.\n \u201cPalmers\u2019 k-kiss is holy?\u201d\n There\u2019s something else in his eyes now. Warmth and salt and everything he put away while she was gone. He smiles slow, and it\u2019s like nothing Cardee has seen before. Nothing and yet everything she knows, and there comes the sound of small bare feet, thumping down the hall. Toward them. My black-eyed girls.\n \u201cCome from those streets, Cardee Findar. I will remember with you.\u201d"}

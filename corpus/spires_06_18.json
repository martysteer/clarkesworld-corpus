The chloropolyurethane fabric flaps in the slight breeze and the double suns beat down onto her arms.\nLukas fishes in his bag next to his tent for a bottle of sunsoak and releases the spray, running it generously over his solflex-covered arms, torso, and legs.\n\u201cYour head,\u201d Chenguang says and he smiles, as if he hadn\u2019t been doing this for years.\n\u201cCan\u2019t reach,\u201d he says, lying and Chenguang knows he just likes the attention. She grabs the spray and discharges that exhale of mist, covering his football-shaped clear helmet. She even sprays some on the clear hard arc under his bearded chin. She turns the mist onto herself, bringing down the spray over her exposed transpandex inner layer, the foam frothing up at her arms before becoming clear, encasing the invisible solflex pores of her fabric.\nLukas watches her as she sprays down. \u201cThat\u2019s probably enough,\u201d Lukas says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to drown yourself and run dry tomorrow\u2019s supply.\u201d\n\u201cCheapskate.\u201d But, Chenguang knows he\u2019s right and slides it back in his sack. A coin catches the light. His comm. She grabs it. \u201cYou almost forgot this.\u201d\n\u201cLike I would. And risk not being able to talk to you when we\u2019re apart?\u201d\n\u201cVery funny. Put it on.\u201d He does, affixing it to his chest.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you have it like that just dangling from your neck.\u201d His voice comes through his piece and projects into her pendant.\n\u201cIt feels nice. Plus I hear you loud and clear.\u201d She stretches now, getting ready for the run. Her pendant chain slides about near her armpit. She holds it to her chest, reaffirming a silent promise to her sister.\n\u201cWon\u2019t feel so nice getting snagged on a branch.\u201d\nChenguang gestures out as she pulls up her leg. Near his tent, Lukas brings his head to his knees, arching his back and groaning. They wrap up the tent sheet around their legs, its fibers assimilating into their pants, attaching itself to their uniforms.\nChenguang kicks up her legs, feeling the lightness of the tent. She hitches the bag with the rest of her limited supplies onto her back. \u201cCome on, old man. You see this wide expanse? Not a tree in sight.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be one.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not too worried,\u201d Chenguang utters before she starts off on a sprint. Lukas follows at her heels, his shoes sinking into the foamy terrain in rapid strides.\nThey jump, leap, roll, wind up, and do it again. Their legs traverse the terrain of Sugue, picking up speed like a vacuum picks up dust. Chenguang feels the wind in her hair and sprints past a tangle of mossy vines. Out of her peripheral vision, Chenguang sees Lukas next to her jumping over a mound and kicking off a verdant growth to spin into a roll as he keeps going. He\u2019s showing off, telling her he can keep up even doing spins. She picks up the pace.\nWhen the wall arises before them, she leaps up and attaches herself like a cat, her transpandex fingers reaching over the top. Her body sinks into the wall, as like everything else, its fa\u00e7ade is full of moss. Her right leg kicks off and she reaches with her arm, throwing herself over the edge. Her hand slips.\nLukas is right behind her and his geneblazed thigh muscles have no trouble leaping up and perching on top. He offers her a hand. She grimaces, lets Lukas\u2019 hand dangle, and picks herself up.\nShe feels the solflex suit, covered in spray, picking up the heat of the sun. She takes a second to catch her breath, as Lukas adjusts his helmet. The sun warms her and at the corner of her helmet, the hololight shows the power\u2019s at half capacity, filling up notch by notch. She needs to be faster.\n\u201cMine\u2019s saying two-thirds full,\u201d says Lukas, as if reading her mind.\n\u201cYeah, mine too.\u201d Chenguang\u2019s not lying, she tells herself. If she squints, it kind of looks like the bar\u2019s higher.\n\u201cYou think we\u2019ll meet quota before the suns set?\u201d\nChenguang\u2019s mouth beats her brain. \u201cYes, definitely. Or else you can have my thermal blanket.\u201d She shuts her eyes, wishing she hadn\u2019t promised that.\nOver the wall, the hills fill their eyes. Beyond that is the industrial wasteland.\nThey only stop running and leaping after their feet, backs, and arms map out their jaunt through the hilly stretch.\nChenguang\u2019s muscles ache, but she doesn\u2019t want to admit it. She shakes out her legs, pulls back her neck. There\u2019s a change going through her. She used to be able to run for days without pain, but then again, she used to be able to jump twice the height Lukas jumped earlier today at the wall. Today, she barely got past it.\n\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d Lukas looks genuinely concerned. Probably for himself. He knows he can\u2019t do this alone.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She stares at the industrial wasteland. The two suns are waning now, Solah closer to the horizon than Soloh. Lukas\u2019 hazy shadow lengthens against the concrete at the hill land\u2019s edge. His green eyes glint in the pink of the dual-sun evening light.\n\u201cYou have the Eazslap?\u201d she says.\nLukas undoes a pocket at his triceps and pulls out a few blue-glowing stickers, disengages them from each other. He selects two, hands them over to Chenguang.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad, can it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s just preventative. Besides, the sticker will provide some light, now the suns are retiring on us.\u201d\n\u201cBarely,\u201d says Lukas, under his breath.\nChenguang keeps her eyes bright and open as she slaps them on, even as the telltale searing pain reaches her knees. She\u2019s not going to give in with any wince or reaction. The stickers release inflammation inhibitors; the burst of prickling tells her that much at least.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your charge say?\u201d Chenguang asks. She feigns nonchalance, ignoring quivering knees.\nLukas\u2019 pupils veer right and his hands twitch, moving phantom controls. Chenguang watches as he waits for the bar graph in his view to convert to a figure.\n\u201c93%. I figure we\u2019ll be in the sun for another ten minutes. Not running and leaping, so it\u2019s not going to climb exponentially.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably get up to 95%.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s pretty safe. I\u2019ll be in the clear all night. How about yours?\u201d\n\u201c89%,\u201d Chenguang says. She grits her teeth. More like 72.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good,\u201d says Lukas. \u201cWell, 95\u2019s not 100 but it\u2019s pretty close. I guess I won\u2019t be needing your thermal blanket. I\u2019ll do okay with my own.\u201d\n\u201cYou can have it. I promised you 100%.\u201d\n\u201cNah, it\u2019ll just get too hot.\u201d But Chenguang knows that\u2019s not true. The blankets optimize for perfect temperature, no shivering and no sweating, no excess heat or cold. With two blankets, once the batts run out for the night for the first, the second one would take over. Without it, they\u2019ll just have to do with the dire chill. Negative fifties or so degrees Celsius chill.\nThey bask out in the sun, drinking up its energy. Lukas just lays back, but Chenguang\u2019s arms and legs scissor open and closed. Jumping jacks to accelerate absorption. Any movement prompts magnified absorption rates, but running, leaping, and gaining ground does it most. Something to do with your heart rate, acceleration, and even psychological thrill all interacting with the inner solflex machinery\u2014amplified, too, by a generous coating of spray.\nShe huffs, scissoring her arms and legs, as she watches their shadows get longer and longer until they merged with the dusk that surrounds them.\nDinner goes by without a word. There\u2019s really not much to say chewing on vaprabars. Can\u2019t really comment on the taste because it\u2019s just coagulated nutripowder. Chenguang grabs a second but Lukas\u2019 hand comes down on her wrist. \u201cThere\u2019s too much iron in it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might interact with Eazslaps.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nShe gives him a look like she might bite his hand and he pulls back.\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he says, but she\u2019s already tossed it towards her pack. It clatters against her helmet and tumbles to the ground. The bright sleek wrapping stands out against the dull, dark concrete, reflecting the artificial light emanating from the ray fabric, slung up against a ledge.\nThere is no natural light tonight. Clouds have completely enveloped this planet\u2019s one moon. They rely on the ray fabric and its harsh white light.\nLukas whistles as he sets up his tent. Chenguang remembers the song as she starts to emancipate her tent fabric from her legs and spread it out before her.\n\u201cClear, the White Waters,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWhere I was from, it was \u2018Cool, the White Waters.\u2019\u201d Lukas says. He pulls off his coin comm and drops it into his upturned helmet.\n\u201cWhat it would be like to get in,\u201d she says. She sits down under her half-pitched tent, waiting for it to inflate. She stretches out her legs. \u201cTo envelop in water.\u201d\n\u201cYou are enveloped in water. Made of it,\u201d says Lukas. He\u2019s un-creasing every bit of his tent with his transpandex-covered hands.\n\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember when we had water. Trickles to splash on your eyelids. Mist to clean off your skin, your elbows.\u201d\n\u201cThat was years ago and worlds away. Better to focus on the project at hand.\u201d Lukas was systematic in his manual un-crinkling. Even if it would be done by the inflator anyway. His thoroughness reminds Chenguang of how he runs and leaps, methodical, making sure to cover the ground and air, checking for sharp edges with the heightened instinct of his body as they\u2019re trained to, even in his lightning speed. She sees that concentration all day running through his aerodynamic mask, in that focused look in his eyes.\n\u201cYou think the capballs will really generate enough power?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll make a lot more than we can.\u201d\n\u201cEnough to rent all the tech? The hydrogen harvesters, transporters, and hydro-generators for Claris?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll do some. But, you might not want to hold your breath on that liquid immersion.\u201d\n\u201cA bath. They called it a bath.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, the best you can do is dream about it. We\u2019re about to enter wasteland tomorrow. And the specs say that\u2019s as dry as bone.\u201d\n\u201cBone? But, that\u2019s us. I thought we\u2019re made of mostly water, you said.\u201d\n\u201cBone, desiccated, nothing but bone, bone. Pinch dry. Like everything else in this sector.\u201d\nChenguang massages her knees, looks out into the wasteland, the geometric shapes of a past civilization, now all dried to stone.\nBefore she can duck into her tent, Lukas walks over, fishes in his bag, passes her a package with an attached flexstraw. A sippee. About a cup\u2019s worth of water in a bag. \u201cWon this years ago as a medal. Parkour championship. Been holding onto it, weighing me down.\u201d\nShe looks at it, feels the weight. It\u2019s liquid, all right.\nAnd Lukas has been running with this strapped to him this whole time? She looks up at him, but he looks down, veiling his expression.\n\u201cI can\u2019t take this\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTake it. It\u2019s dragging me, slowing me down. And you need it for your knees.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen do me the favor of helping me get rid of this. I don\u2019t have what it takes to appreciate it. To me it\u2019s all the same. Whether liquid\u2019s shot-fed through skin microhydro-generators from tiny spurts of hydrogen and oxygen or if I gulp it down in one go through my esophagus. Makes no difference.\u201d He looks up and gives her a nod. Chenguang sees a hardness in Lukas\u2019 eyes, a stubbornness that won\u2019t back down.\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve never tried gulping it.\u201d\n\u201cI have. I\u2019ve won more than one medal. A pretty good sprinter and leaper before you. Please, as if they\u2019d send anyone less than a champ to work with you.\u201d\nChenguang stares at Lukas who\u2019s doing squats, with a huge grin on his face, as if to prove his point. His eyes, though, belie something. Regret, possibly.\n\u201cAlright, thanks, Lukas. But, no more favors.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a\u2014\u201d\nChenguang ducks into her tent, swipes on her thermal blanket as the chill settles in. She pulls the squishy package of water onto her chest, and watches it rise and fall underneath the blanket.\nWater, she thinks, as her eyes fall to a close. She\u2019s never had so much at once, not since twenty years ago, when she was eight and her grandma splurged on a pack. She remembers sharing it with her little sister, Xinyao gobbling most of it up and leaving her with only a mouthful.\nIn her sleep, she dreams of broken legs. Broken legs mean no levers for that fulcrum hip of hers to move, little heat generated for the night, and no work for creds to pay for her relocation debt. She calls out in her sleep.\nShe dreams of her mother and father, selected to fight the fires so rampant in her homeworld, never to be seen again. She dreams of their voyage, sent off for a better home. And Xinyao, orbiting with the Civ, still caged in a temp cell, waiting for enough water on Claris to emerge from the hive.\nShe thrashes about, in her half-lucid state. Her mind fixates on the sheer ingenuity of that tech borrowed from the High Institute, funded through expending collected resources of their homeworld. Their last big hurrah for their best and brightest. The journey, the rocket, glorious things the High Institute owns. She\u2019ll probably never see interstellar tech like that again. Only capballs. Efficient, good for short distances. Sensitive old scrap low tech for low-end space riffraff like her. Low tech she has high hopes for. She dreams of it zipping by her, beating her in speed and grace, though she would be off planet by then. Once the capballs make enough energy for hydrogen tech rental, as they all hope, the zapping for water will be a cinch.\nWith a start, she remembers there is water balanced in a package on her chest.\nHer leg aches.\nWater.\nShe dreams of tasting it. It tickles her tongue, dapples in specks of moist cohesion on her lips, washes down in a surge.\nWhen she awakes, she starts, thinking the package has broken and all its treasures have leaked out and seeped into the parched concrete, but she feels no wetness. It is still there. Intact. It\u2019s warm.\nShe\u2019s cold.\nShe realizes she awakes not from the nightmare of disappearing H2O, slipping away from her, but the reality of chill. She didn\u2019t collect enough sun.\nShe breathes out. Sees her breath, precious heat and humidity escaping. She puts on her helmet and she feels immediate warmth, the last dregs of power still caged in there. But she can\u2019t rest her head back onto her pack, not without the helmet\u2019s aerodynamic wedge getting in the way.\nThat leaves her chilly body. The pack, at least, is warm against her skin. She remembers that water is a good conductor and the packaging\u2019s got heat tech. She rubs the pack around her body, shivering. She pushes it under the blanket, willing it to stay warm under the covers as she swipes the pack around her.\nThe rubbing generates more heat and her hands are methodical, making the pack move in strategic ways, as strategic as the two of them, Lukas and Chenguang, like a pair of lone coyotes, traversing the landscape. They are mapping out the best course, the one that gains the most sunshine and surface contact with least amount of risk, so when the capballs are dropped, the tech will interact with the atmosphere and topographical elements of the landscape and accelerate with so much collected sun energy, multiplied by the mechanics of their whizzing speed and ground synergies, they\u2019ll be priceless, chock full of power, when harvested.\nLucky so far that they\u2019ve patched the sharp edges. The capballs fly fast and accurate, but one touch at a point and their vulnerable surface gives, puncturing the irreplaceable tech borrowed by the Civ at great cost to them. Even if it was belittled low tech, a drop in the bucket compared to the wealth and potential of the High Institute. When it comes to the High Institute, they\u2019d find a way to collect for any broken rented tech, no matter how minor. Should the capballs touch an edge, they\u2019d snap. Like apocryphal soap bubbles popping, childhood dreams of water gone.\nUnable to sleep, Chenguang stretches as her parkour and acceleration trainer has taught her. She hears her trainer\u2019s voice now, as she reaches over to her ankles: \u201cPrepare the muscles, sharpen the mind. As a human you have an edge\u2014instinct and corporeal sense. You\u2019ve got a gift that no bot could ever replicate\u2014somatics\u2014an organic impulse that lies deep behind the geneblazed muscles and uniform-enhanced speed. There are phenomena on planets we can\u2019t anticipate to program into bots. You\u2019ve got the skills, the training. Don\u2019t waste it, whet it like a knife. Focus. Breathe. Keep your eye on the goal.\u201d\nChenguang rests the package of water in her lap. Pulls in her right arm, braces it in the elbow of the other. Her triceps draw taut, making her suck in a breath. She never thought she\u2019d be a cartographer, using her somatic experience to create the map for sensitive tech, but sometimes she can\u2019t think of any other job that would make her feel so alive.\nShe wonders how the other recruits are doing. Ayesha and Jayesh, her two best friends. Are they doing okay in Tilna? They volunteered together, unlike her, who volunteered alone and got placed with a stranger: Lukas.\nLukas. She held onto her warm water bag. He\u2019s fast. Maybe she should\u2019ve been paired with someone slower. She was once as fast as him, maybe even faster, but something on this planet\u2019s pressing on her. Changing her.\nHer eyes fall on the swirling inflator at the top of the tent, a tiny disk generator that pitched air along the inner surface tent. Rotating, it looks like a planet. She imagines it swarming with tiny beads, all charging along on its surface. There are dozens of planets in this solar system, all to be filled with accelerating capballs. All to be gathering energy for rental tech for hydrogen capture and water production.\nFor Claris. Their only hope.\nShe pulls in her toes, flexes her calves, then peels off the Eazslaps on their knees. They no longer glow, their medicinal blaze exhausted. She sticks it against the side of the tent, too tired to deal with it now.\nShe removes her helmet and tries to think of the hearth, snap noodles, and other hot things from home. Her fingers run along her pendant, with her comm on one side and a picture of her little sister, Xinyao, on the other. She falls asleep again, as the heat of the water pack penetrates her transpandex and warms her abs.\nChenguang shivers as she wakes to the break of dawn and the breaking of Lukas\u2019 voice as he attempts to sing her awake.\n\u201cStop.\u201d She can hear him both through the tent and through the comm. The scraggly high-pitched pentatonic tune falters and grinds to a halt.\nThe water pack has chilled and she looks at it through the light of the morning. She can\u2019t drink this now. There needs to be the right time, an occasion. Basking on concrete in the middle of Sugue, at the brink of wasteland, is no way to celebrate with a cocktail this precious. H2O, she slips it in her pack, glides out of her tent in a swift slide, and wraps it all up.\nOnce they wrap, strap, fold, and tie, they\u2019re ready to set off.\nThis time Lukas jumps out first, his bound energy as taut as coiled springs, and he rockets forth as if pumped on juice, an old homeworld expression when juice once existed.\nShe follows behind, the twin suns already opening up the world with light.\nThey bound across the abandoned industrial landscape like two fleas on a bear, except instead of fur, stained concrete meets their lattice neoprene soles.\nFor all the time this place has been abandoned, no plant life breaks through the hardened cement. There\u2019s a dispossessed feeling in the air.\n\u201cWhat happened to these people?\u201d Chenguang breathes out as she runs.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t take a look while you were stopping by base before the new assignment?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t get a chance. Was checking up on my sister in the hive at Civ.\u201d Chenguang slips over a railing and Lukas vaults over it and lands on two feet.\n\u201cOh, the hive. Sobering place. So, this here was Tneshtown. When I checked back on base, this industrial park long ago was the production center of kenophrane, the textile coating that housed the smart fabrics made to filter toxic chemicals.\u201d\n\u201cKenophrane? Hasn\u2019t that been outlawed?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Lukas jumps ahead and puts his hand on what looks like a smokestack before swinging his legs over it\n\u201cLet me guess, making kenophrane also involves releasing toxins.\u201d Chenguang merely skirts around the smokestack-like protrusion before jumping over a gap.\n\u201cYup, one of those pollute to get rid of pollution deals.\u201d\n\u201cGuess they lost out.\u201d\n\u201cKind of. Depends who you look at. Many did lose out. There were mass deaths of workers, at least according to the base briefing. Violent stuff. First you get a rash and a cough, pretty innocuous. But then your hands turn red and bloated and you can\u2019t work. You slowly go blind and your lungs lose function. Those were the common ailments.\u201d Chenguang rolls from a jump as she listens.\n\u201cPretty awful.\u201d She sees Lukas hopping from one cement circular vat to another. The vats look like places for drying some liquid.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even the worst stuff.\u201d\n\u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d\n\u201cLimb detachment and there\u2019s more.\u201d He pretend cuts his arm before using it to pivot over a gate. Then he runs and leaps across to the next building over.\n\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t like to read the briefings. It\u2019s never \u2018They all had perfect health and beautiful descendants and happiness.\u2019\u201d Chenguang follows suit but has to attach herself to the wall like a cat, barely clearing the ten-foot gap.\n\u201cIf they did, we wouldn\u2019t be here, staking out their derelict remains, mapping out their territory.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Chenguang\u2019s back met roof in an impeccable roll and she gets up without stopping. Her helmet cuts through the air as she leaps again.\n\u201cThe unfortunate ones are the ones that didn\u2019t survive long enough before the big move. But, they took all the able workers out of here once they created enough fabrics. They thought the fabrics they created would fix this place up. But, the fabrics couldn\u2019t filter these toxins. They only did Grade C and the ones released here were some of the chemicals under Grade E.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad. They did a pretty good job building these structures.\u201d She swung her legs through a gap between a vat and what looked like a drying lattice.\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re pretty sturdy.\u201d Lukas tapped on the cement before doing a spin off a wall and onto another neighboring one.\n\u201cGood call. I think we need more spins.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, quadruple the solar intake.\u201d\nChenguang pulls a 360 as she kicks off the ledge of a roof. She feels the rays coursing through the chloropolyurethane hitting the solflex absorbers and a ping goes off in her helmet alerting her of high intake rate achieved.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Lukas. Some of this is pretty sharp. I think we\u2019ll have to go through this again and note where the patches need to go.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad we can\u2019t just tear it down.\u201d\n\u201cHistorical planetary code. You know we\u2019d be indicted by the High Institute in a hot second.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. But, I have to say. There\u2019s something charming about this place.\u201d\n\u201cYou just like how the concrete feels against your legs when executing your spins.\u201d Chenguang pulls another spin off, her spiral unwinding from her legs, when she missteps. She stumbles and catches herself right before a roof edge. She slips then.\nHer heart jumps as Lukas grabs her arm.\nIt starts to slip, the transpandex of his fingers and her inner arm garment sliding past each other.\n\u201cWhoa.\u201d Lukas pulls her up. His fingers slip again. Chenguang reaches with her other arm, pulling on the chloropolyurethane sleeve of his jacket, finally latching on to something with slight traction.\n\u201cWhoa is right.\u201d Chenguang kicks up against the side of the building and pushes herself up. She looks down at the side as they catch their breath. That would\u2019ve been a twenty-foot fall. Though a protrusion from the wall might have saved her a broken spine by breaking something else.\n\u201cYou, uh, okay there?\u201d Lukas does some jumping jacks, trying to maximize the solar intake.\n\u201cThat was weird. I felt like something pushed me off my spin. You know spins aren\u2019t so hard to control. Once you\u2019re moving, you\u2019ve got momentum.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d say. Some momentum. You nearly spun yourself out to a multiple-story drop.\u201d\nChenguang sat on the side of a vat, her eyes shifting left to right and her fingers moving, calibrating the fabric to her nerves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. They\u2019re attached. But, just in case, I reconnected and connected them again.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to check it? I mean, not to be forward, but I can usually feel the incongruities.\u201d Lukas pauses in his jumping jacks, raises a brow.\n\u201cNo, no. I think it\u2019s fine. You know what it felt like?\u201d\n\u201cScary?\u201d\nChenguang shakes her head. \u201cLike someone pushed me.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one here but me, Chenguang. And you know I know enough not to pull any pranks.\u201d\nShe gets up, looks over at the rising twin suns, and starts doing jumping jacks herself. After the chill of last night, she knows enough to try to osmose as much sunlight as possible.\nThey run again.\nShe\u2019s feeling pretty good. She got in five vaults and three good rolls. She\u2019s starting to forget about the strange feeling in the air, like being jerked off a trajectory when her foot slips at a jump. It doesn\u2019t slip per se, it feels like it\u2019s being pulled.\nHelmet hits concrete as she bangs into a raised structure in the shape of a cone. Her head reverberates in the football-shaped piece of clear armor. She sidesteps and avoids falling over as she experiences a wave of nausea.\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re stopping,\u201d says Lukas. \u201cSecond time today.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, I can go on. It was just a tug on my leg.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for a bar break.\u201d Lukas sits down right where he is, onto the rooftop ground. No vat or raise-up to park his rear on in sight. The smokestack to his left comes up over his head and is simply too high, though he could probably scale it.\nHe looks like he\u2019s contemplating doing so as he focuses his eyes in that way. Then, he tugs off his helmet, pulls out a bar, and chomps on it.\n\u201cAir\u2019s not too bad now,\u201d he says, in between bites. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve. \u201cDry. The briefing said all those abandoned years finally cleaned it out. But, it took a long while and still the toxins might be stored in the moss.\u201d\nChenguang ignores her own stomach growling and approaches the site where she felt the tug. She\u2019s looking at a structure that has a concrete panel up top and one below and just a window to slide through. This is where she tripped, trying to vault between the two panels through the three-foot aperture.\nShe kicks it. \u201cWhat do you suppose this is?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. A place to hang something? Or maybe a shrine or something. They had a crude religion back then.\u201d\nShe peers at the shadow of the structure the dual suns make, a dark slat on top and bottom, like an enlarged sandwich of the homeworld, and notes the fuzziness of the penumbra. There\u2019s something off.\nShe accelerates to try to vault through the aperture again, but the space between the two concrete panels seems impenetrable and again she hits concrete.\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\u201cYou hurt yourself again?\u201d Lukas approaches her.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. I was kind of expecting it. Come and check this out.\u201d\nChenguang tries to pass her hand through the hole in the two slats but meets a resistance. Lukas tries and his hand slides right off.\n\u201cAn encasement?\u201d Chenguang asks Lukas, wide-eyed.\n\u201cNo, their tech wasn\u2019t advanced enough for that.\u201d Chenguang places a note into her mapalog of the anomaly. \u201cThis\u2019ll need more than a patch. If the capballs hit this\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. They\u2019ll have to get rid of this. It\u2019s altering the flow. But, they, not us. We\u2019re not being paid for reconstructions, just mapping and patch-noting. Plus, we\u2019ll let the higher-ups handle all the historical planetary code red tape.\u201d\nChenguang removes her helmet and pushes against the space.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Chenguang? Just set it aside, let them handle it later. You need to take your bar break and we should get going.\u201d She sees Lukas standing up, holding his helmet akimbo in his right arm.\nShe feels a sucking feeling at her hands and legs and she\u2019s pulled in. A pop at her back ends the vacuuming whoosh and all is dark.\n\u201cLukas?\u201d\nChenguang\u2019s voice echoes in this expanse of dark.\nA vortex of light opens to her right and she sees a warped head and legs emerge from a point in the dark. It\u2019s Lukas. As he enters the space, the light bends, his figure elongated as he pulls himself through and it closes behind him. It\u2019s dark again.\n\u201cHey, Lukas.\u201d\n\u201cChenguang?\u201d His voice is low and resounds against unseen walls. \u201cWhere is this place?\u201d\n\u201cDid we just\u2014enter the structure somehow?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2014don\u2019t know.\u201d Lukas\u2019 voice uncharacteristically wavers before it quiets down in the darkness.\nChenguang remembers listening to her grandma talk about physical experiments of the past. Pools of salty water that deaden sound. Eternal blackness to sharpen the mind. A chamber, her grandma called it. One that dispossesses you of your senses. That was before the planet went up in flames, before she bid her grandma goodbye as she left her behind.\nDeprived. She feels like that now. There\u2019s an ache throbbing within her.\nA light comes up in the corner and they walk towards it. It feels like an infinite space, paths that lead in every direction, but they move toward the light. They don\u2019t run. Somehow it doesn\u2019t feel right here. Chenguang moves her legs, almost robotically towards the rays.\nThe light becomes bigger, brighter and they see it now and when it becomes the length of a vaprabar, palm-size, she stops and Lukas halts behind her. They\u2019re standing five feet away. Chenguang feels Lukas\u2019 breath before her, steady, in and out, in and out.\nWhat first appeared like the vaprabar is rectangular and long, a series of small cubes arranged next to each other in a line formation. Pulsing light.\nLukas\u2019 loud breathing seems to skip a beat, and Chenguang feels, too, something caught in her throat as an array of sensations overtake her body.\nHer head feels hot, her limbs cold, her spine feels a chill pass through it, and her legs feels a searing heat travel through them. Her pendant with her comm lifts up and yanks at her neck. It\u2019s pulling towards the light. She grabs it, trying to push it down to her chest, which is thumping, cold, cold.\nLukas has stepped up towards it and he\u2019s reaching\u2014\n\u201cNo,\u201d cries Chenguang, but Lukas is faster than her words. He swings his helmet and captures that lit-up bar, no bigger than a packet of gum, like he\u2019s playing catcher at meteoroid-pitch.\nThe sensations in her body fade, her temperature returning to normal and she\u2019s tugging at her chloropolyurethane sleeves again. Doing anything to make her feel like she\u2019s got control of her body.\nShe moves up to Lukas, but he reaches his hand into his helmet, towards the light.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a good\u2014\u201d she starts to say, but a deafening high-pitched buzz fills her ears and then there\u2019s a blast, and she expects to hear an explosion, but only hears that shrieking buzz as mushrooming light blinds.\nThe feeling comes a moment later, lifting up and being thrown up against something. Her body hurts, aches that fill not only her body, but also the inside of her mind. The air in her chest collapses at her intake of breath and she sees through her closed eyelids, the brightness that could only be two suns.\nShe forces herself to open her eyes.\nLukas is rolling back and forth on his back on the roof ground, holding up his knee to his chest. He\u2019s wincing and moaning to himself.\nCrap.\nChenguang wills herself up and tries to knock some sense into Lukas. He looks up at her and shuts his eyes, opens them again. She hefts him up, despite his muttering objections. Her knees shake, but she\u2019s got him. He\u2019s heavy, at least heavier than she imagined, his arms and legs dangle out of her hug. Luckily, cartologist runners are more streamlined than bulky, so at least he\u2019s not too beefy. She pulls him away from his cracked helmet, moves him to the far ledge on the roof.\nShe makes sure he\u2019s all right. He\u2019s moaning but otherwise okay, she guesses, and goes back and peers at the helmet. There\u2019s nothing in there now. Just cracked shards lining what was once the perimeter of the head hole.\nShe doesn\u2019t dare move it.\nCrap.\nHow fast can he run without its aerodynamic edge? How much sunlight can he collect without its specialized absorption tech? He\u2019ll freeze at night. Without it, he definitely won\u2019t generate enough power to activate the heating cells in his blanket.\nShe plucks the water patch out of her backpack, wondering if she should wait to give it to him as a warmer at night, like the way she used it last night, but makes up her mind and rips it open. Tepid water, heated from the ambient air of this land of dual suns, trickles down her hand. She rushes to lick it and it feels startling and moist on her tongue.\nWater.\nShe\u2019s careful as she brings it over to Lukas, lifts up his head, and forces him to drink it. His eyes fly open when he realizes what it is that he is gulping. She realizes she\u2019s licking her lips and her throat\u2019s moving up and down, a phantom desire to taste what he\u2019s having, as she feeds the elixir of H2O to him. He looks bewildered and his eyelids shut again. After he has gulped down the bulk of it, his eyes open again.\nJust a few drops left that Chenguang loathes to waste, so she rolls up the package, so light in her hands now, as a contrast to the luxurious heftiness of the water weight before, and stuffs the mostly-packaging into her pack. Maybe I\u2019ll lick it clean when we pack up for the night.\nLukas\u2019 eyes clear up from the haze and look at her as she eats her vaprabar. She\u2019s trying to think. To put together the many strands of thought entangling within one another. What was that? Where did we go off to? What happened to that panel block of light bits? What to do with Lukas and his busted helmet? Water. I wish I could have tasted more of it.\nThe vaprabar shatters into dry bits in her mouth as she chomps.\n\u201cChenguang, thanks,\u201d she hears Lukas behind her saying. She stops staring into the sky with its twin suns and turns around.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. My knee\u2019s not right. But, I think it\u2019ll be better.\u201d\nChenguang fishes out Eazslaps and helps him put it on. \u201cYour turn for these.\u201d\n\u201cMy helmet.\u201d It\u2019s a statement, not a question.\n\u201cYeah. Broken.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d ask you. You\u2019re the one who touched it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. But I\u2019ll admit, that was pretty dumb.\u201d\n\u201cEasier to say now, in retrospect. We had no idea what it could do.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, nice of you to say. Though, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He casts his eyes down and he does look penitent. He rubs the Eazslaps over his knee. Shiny blue peeks through his fingers to show they\u2019re working. \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d\n\u201cBetter off than you,\u201d she says, swallowing the last of her bar.\n\u201cSo, I guess you\u2019ll go off. Finish the cartography. I can poke around here. Look for some shelter for the night. Cuddle up next to some concrete.\u201d\nChenguang shakes her head.\n\u201cI think we should go down.\u201d\n\u201cDown?\u201d\n\u201cInto the wasteland. Into the buildings. Not just graze the rooftop. There might be something we can use to get you warm. Maybe some energy source. An old battery or something.\u201d\n\u201cThere? There\u2019s nothing left. People left long ago.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just get this feeling. You know, I felt something pull at me. Twice. And that panel of connected cubes of light. Maybe that has energy.\u201d\n\u201cToo dangerous. We\u2019re not playing around with that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that. I just mean. We won\u2019t know until we look. There\u2019s no way I can map out this planet alone in time, so if you\u2019re out of commission, neither of us will get our cred, you\u2019ll be frozen dead from the night chill, and they\u2019ll send new cartographers here. We\u2019ll be in debt, paying for the commute and lift back. Well, I\u2019ll be and you, too, if you manage to stay alive. This is the best way. Plus, I dunno. I just get this feeling.\u201d\nLukas shakes his head.\n\u201cLukas, I saw an opening before.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAn opening into the buildings. They\u2019re not all sealed off like the High Institute\u2019s Historical Society claims. A space was overlooked. It\u2019s way over the side of one of the buildings, about five buildings back. If we could just make our way over there\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. You sure the blast didn\u2019t mess you up? Going back and entering this condemned space\u2014\u201d\nChenguang hooks her arm into his elbow and helps him up. He limps, then shakes out his knee as he leans on her. He moves again and he looks more stable.\n\u201cThe swelling\u2019s going down. You\u2019re going to make it. Lucky, no blood, no concussion, right? Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nHe tries walking a few more steps. He squats and gets up.\n\u201cAlright, hope you can leap, I\u2019m heading over to the other side. Leave all the stuff. It\u2019ll just weigh you down. Latch onto my arm if you can\u2019t make it and I\u2019ll give you a catch.\u201d\nChenguang vaults back, retracing their way back to the building before. She makes it, though she\u2019s not as swift as she once was.\nShe leans over the ledge and holds out her arms. She hopes she won\u2019t have to catch him. She\u2019s not sure if she can handle the weight after all.\nHe runs, looks good, tight form, and jumps and vaults. It\u2019s clean and he lands with a roll onto the roof. He\u2019s still limping, a bit. He\u2019s trying to hide it.\nThey manage to leap, roll, and dash over to five buildings back.\nChenguang looks down the alleyway between two buildings. The black hole is there. A window that hasn\u2019t been sealed up. She feels drawn towards it, like a whisper in the back of her mind guiding her that way. When she sees it, something like congruity settles in her bones.\n\u201cWe gotta go. You can make it. I know you can. At least the Eazslaps will dampen the pain enough, yeah?\u201d\nShe leaps back and forth between the building she\u2019s on and the other one that\u2019s slightly taller, as she descends. Like a moth, fluttering from one surface to another, she hops, light and assured until she reaches the opening at the wall. She perches on the windowsill for a moment, feeling the cool air of inside on one side of her and the heat of the sun on the other.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she says into her comm and she hears Lukas respond.\nShe alights onto concrete a few feet below the window and follows the panel of light from the window onto the floor. Nothing. Again, she sees nothing. Before she can walk up and explore, Lukas falls into place behind her.\n\u201cGood, you made it. Now, let\u2019s do a search.\u201d\nThey spend about half an hour walking through the place, lighting up the room with activated ray fabric. It\u2019s the most energy-efficient light they have, but it\u2019s a harsh white glow. Mostly it\u2019s just the rough white concrete that looks up at them.\nChenguang spends some of her pent-up stamina on staircases, jumping up flights at a time, passing through the rails.\nShe\u2019s beginning to suspect this to be a great waste of time, and Lukas was right after all, when her cartographer\u2019s scrutinizing gaze finds a deviation on the tiles of the bottommost level. A carved depression, hooked back like a handle.\nShe slides her hand and lifts.\nA basement?\nShe talks into her comm. \u201cLukas, slide down the banister to the bottom floor and get over here. There\u2019s a route down here.\u201d\nShe slips through, lands with a cat crouch, and walks in this dark tunnel. She\u2019s feeling out the hollowness and the perfect curves of the walls when Lukas joins her.\n\u201cLeg okay?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThey walk what seems like ages. The path keeps going and going and a prod at the back of her mind\u2019s telling her that she messed up. Lukas is losing strength, she can hear it in his breaths, even if he tries to hide it. She\u2019s wasting time. Precious time that she could be charting out the world or at least soaking up the outside heat for the night.\nShe prompts her helmet and she\u2019s at 78%. Yesterday she would have groaned. Today she\u2019s thinking, not bad, given the circumstances.\nThe route opens up to a clearing.\nRather than empty space, the ray fabric shows tangles of webbing. She manipulates the fabric, shining the light at some of the strands. They\u2019re cords. Tangles and tangles of cords. She hasn\u2019t seen old tech like this in ages.\nShe follows them to their mass clump at the center.\n\u201cAn AI?\u201d whispers Lukas.\nA voice booms throughout the chamber. Chenguang shines the ray fabric around, but the harsh light only illuminates cords. No speakers, but perhaps they\u2019re implanted in the walls and ceiling. The voice sounds like it\u2019s coming from everywhere.\n\u201cEybzzkey\u2014\u201d\nChenguang elbows Lukas and points at his comm. \u201cTurn on the translator.\u201d\nShe triggers her own on.\nThe voice changes, dark and silky. \u201cYou\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\u201cYou were expecting me?\u201d Chenguang gestures to herself, as she walks forward, as if compelled by some force. Lukas puts a hand on her shoulder and Chenguang startles in her path forward.\n\u201cThe upgrades. They\u2019re overdue.\u201d\n\u201cUpgrades,\u201d says Chenguang. \u201cNo, we\u2019re explorers. Well, cartographers, to be exact. Mapping out this land.\u201d\n\u201cNo upgrade?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, but, no.\u201d\n\u201cDrats.\u201d This sounds vaguely funny to Chenguang and she hears Lukas smothering up a laugh with a cough.\n\u201cWho\u2014who are you?\u201d Chenguang asks.\n\u201cI\u2019m the Tattle, the Tneshtown Center. I handle all the deliveries and packages. Last week, we produced, inspected, and delivered 72,000 glons of kenophrane alone, even in the midst of the disruptions from the war. I manage all the trade with the outer worlds and accommodate the schedule of the workers.\u201d\n\u201cWorkers,\u201d says Chenguang. She looks around. The room is bare except for the tangles of cords and them.\nTattle\u2019s voice lowers. \u201cIt seems awfully quiet. Too quiet for a war.\u201d\n\u201cTattle, there\u2019s no one here except us. There was a war long ago.\u201d\n\u201cLong ago?\u201d The voice lilts, waiting for something.\n\u201cNot anymore. The city\u2019s been abandoned.\u201d\nIt\u2019s silent. Only a light tapping sound at the center of the wire clump gives any indication of processing.\nTattle\u2019s voice arises again. \u201cAh, well, that explains it.\u201d\nIs it Chenguang\u2019s imagination, or does it sound like its voice fell?\n\u201cI only awake when there\u2019s activity and a need. It\u2019s to save on energy. I must have been idle for a long, long time.\u201d\nLukas whispers in Chenguang\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to scan the wires.\u201d\nChenguang speaks up, keeping one eye on Lukas who\u2019s running his fingers about half a foot above a wire to her left. \u201cListen, Tattle, we\u2019ll report your existence to our contractors, and they might be able to get you out of here. Or otherwise reprogram you for another use.\u201d More like resell you to a less developed planet. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left for you here.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I must stay here. I know this place will repopulate again. It has so much to offer. The jungle, the soil, and the resources. All the kenophrane.\u201d\n\u201cKenophrane was added to the RSL\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRestricted Substances List,\u201d pipes up Lukas.\n\u201c\u2014for years now.\u201d\nTattle\u2019s voice rises. \u201cI\u2019ll have to reorganize some of my programs, prioritize probing new resources\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTattle, hey, Tattle. Listen. Before you do all that. There\u2019s something we need to ask you. There\u2019s a strange pull that I\u2019ve been feeling. Messing with my movements. Part of it has led me here.\u201d\n\u201cA pull?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a kind of double panel structure up on the roof a few buildings down and when I try to pass through it, it\u2019s blocked. But, somehow, it led us to a dark space with a palm-sized slat of light made up of individual cubes.\u201d\n\u201cDid you touch it?\u201d\n\u201cYes and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt exploded.\u201d Tattle\u2019s voice speaks definitively.\nLukas locks eyes with Chenguang and nods.\n\u201cYes, Tattle, we reached out to it and it exploded.\u201d\n\u201cLandmines.\u201d\nChenguang was thumbing her pendant absently, but stops.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cPlanted by workers bought off by the Kthal. I got rid of most of them. Scoured the buildings inch to inch, but some of them are deep in the sub-layer, luring people in.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. They\u2019re mines?\u201d\n\u201cYes, weaponized organics. I know there are still quite a few around. I tried my best. I really tried my best. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey, Tattle, I\u2019m sure you did. We\u2019ll need to get rid of them. They can\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could help you. But, when the organics were dead, they were easy to discard. You just needed to wrap them in some mellalophane. Now, they\u2019re awake and their properties must be all different.\u201d\nLukas stops what he\u2019s doing, his hand midair and speaks up. \u201cAwake? Organics. You mean, they\u2019re alive? These landmines are alive?\u201d\n\u201cIf enough time has elapsed as you say, then, yes, they\u2019re alive.\u201d\nLukas and I exchange a glance. Even in the diminishing light of ray fabric, I can read his expression. Anxiety at the crinkles of his eyes, his mouth upturned.\nTriple crap.\n\u201cAre they conscious?\u201d\n\u201cConscious?\u201d\n\u201cAre they intelligent creatures?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I only knew them when they were dead. They are easy to find and harvest. An easy tool for the Kthal. But, I know the species has a long dormancy. Not dormancy, death really, as they have no vital signs. Vital signs of their own kind, that is. They experience a growth process thereafter. They start out simply a physical entity with no life to them, but the life sprouts later. The detonation still works while they are without life. It\u2019s called their morterm period. The explosives are the best then, clean and with wide range. My directory tells me that when they are awake, their explosives are less predictable and less effective. Perhaps a small burst.\u201d\n\u201cSeems counterproductive to life. To be able to explode like that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a protective strategy, you know. To protect the nest. In case someone comes, they\u2019ll detonate, but each detonation is unique and doesn\u2019t affect other individual cubes. Their death period allows conservation. Only when resources are good and predators few do they come alive. Altogether they form one big colony. They are harvested in layers and planted as mines.\u201d\n\u201cDo they communicate?\u201d\n\u201cNot when they\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re alive. What do they look like?\u201d\n\u201cLight. They light up, an indication of life. Isn\u2019t that like many other organisms?\u201d\n\u201cNot all,\u201d Chenguang says, looking at Lukas\u2019 Eazslaps on his knees. Their light is fading.\n\u201cWe gotta go,\u201d says Lukas. He motions at the ray fabric. Chenguang was so focused she didn\u2019t notice how quickly the light had dimmed there, too.\n\u201cJust, tell me if these landmines, if they\u2019re intelligent. If they communicate. If they do, then this isn\u2019t an abandoned area. It\u2019ll be rezoned and re-designated.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could tell you. I haven\u2019t come across one. Maybe I will soon, though, since I\u2019m awake now. Come back and visit me, okay? It\u2019s too quiet in here. And if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll sleep again, and who knows when I\u2019ll awake\u2014\u201d\nTattle is still talking as they rush through the tunnel, the light fading quick. They need to rush back and retrieve their tents and packs before it\u2019s pitch black.\nChenguang\u2019s mind races as fast as her legs. They cannot, in good faith, finish their job as cartographers if there are living beings on this planet.\nAs she sprints down the tunnel, she runs through her sensations from before. The pulling, the urge to get closer. Perhaps pheromones or some other release of the organics.\nShe\u2019s thinking of the sensations when she trips.\nNo, not again.\nLukas is there with her. Snagged in the sub-layer. They approach the light that pulses at them. The fragment of the slab that is the landmine.\n\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t touch it, we\u2019re okay, I think. Just don\u2019t go near it,\u201d says Lukas. But, he\u2019s disobeying his own advice, drawing closer and closer. So does Chenguang. Her pendant around her neck flies up a bit, wavers, and falls and flies up. In tune to the pulsing.\nShe can\u2019t help herself, she approaches. Closer. She feels a swarm of feelings in her body. She is warm-blooded, yes, she is warm-blooded, but her toes feel like ice, her chest like fire, her eyes like a subtle warmth, her hands the gentle coolness of a spring day in her homeworld. She wiggles her fingers, her toes\u2014they feel like different worlds, disconnected.\nA thought dawns on her.\nShe breaks through the visceral impact of the feeling and turns to Lukas, who is spellbound, probably feeling all the same sensations.\n\u201cYou think, they\u2019re communicating with us?\u201d\n\u201cThe light pulses? They\u2019re not changing\u2014just rhythmic on and off.\u201d\n\u201cNo, the temperatures. You feel that?\u201d\nHe draws up next to her. His misty breath of icy coolness tells her his response.\n\u201cI\u2019m hot, cold, warm, everything, in all different places.\u201d\nChenguang closes her eyes, focuses on the different feelings permeating in her body.\nShe imagines stalls, different stalls all over. They expand all over the planet. Stalls of different temperatures and the miniscule light cubes that bob along from one stall to the next. She sees mini-ecosystems in each stall. Some filled with other organic life, cohabiting, symbiotic forms of activity.\nShe opens her eyes. She\u2019s still in this sub-layer space. She doesn\u2019t touch but pulls her hand close to the cubes in front of her, emanating light. Each cube shoots out a different temperature, acutely different. Palpable.\n\u201cLukas, close your eyes and focus on your body, on all the different temperatures.\u201d\nChenguang shivers, the chill in her spine deep, as she closes her warm eyes again.\nShe sees the image again, different stalls, life, organisms that look like trees, foliage and moving beads that slither on the ground. Tiny wispy helicopters floating in the air. In each stall are these cubes, like the ones before her in this sub-layer, some clumped together like clusters, emanating light and a particular heat signature.\nShe opens her eyes only to see Lukas open his, his pupils contract in the growing light of the landmine. He strokes his beard with a hand, as he drops his jaw. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. They\u2019re communicating with us. By heat\u2014and cold.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019re sending us some image of the past? Of this planet?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. The files never showed the planet looking anything like what I just saw. Stalls. Cubicles you might call them.\u201d\n\u201cYes, with different flora and maybe fauna, if you could call them that. Some organisms, anyway.\u201d\nChenguang feels an excruciating heat in her nose. Is it one of assent? In her cold gut she feels something like a \u2018yes,\u2019 like something agreeing with her. The feeling grows.\n\u201cNot the past,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThe future.\u201d\nLukas stares at her, with his strangely contracted pupils. \u201cYes, yes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s their vision of their future.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to tell us they have plans for this place. I think. Maybe.\u201d\n\u201cYou might be right.\u201d\nThe impression of her body being isolated into various cells and splashed with varying amounts of heat and lack thereof starts to dissipate. The light of that bar of connected small cubes grows dimmer and once out of that trance of multi-thermal arrest, Chenguang realizes that their fabric ray light has died out completely. Without moving, they\u2019re pulled away from that sub-layer space and return to their dark world in that abandoned building.\nNo, not abandoned, simply derelict.\nThey run, leap out of the underground tunnel, up into the basement, feeling their way through. Their leaps, vaults, and tumbles are more cautioned in the dead of the dark and they make gradual progress towards the roof.\nThey are lucky the moon is out, not trapped behind clouds like the other night. The return of light graces them with their characteristic fearlessness to pick up speed as they spring and leap back to their tents.\nUsually bound by a fierce love for personal space, tonight Chenguang invites Lukas into her own tent. He refuses, staying in his tent until she\u2019s sick of hearing his teeth chatter through the comms and utters, \u201cIf you die of cold, I will string you up with the wires of the AI. And you will spend eternity with chatty Tattle.\u201d\n\u201cWho cares? I\u2019ll be dead,\u201d he says. But, his footsteps say otherwise and she hears the sound of the breach of the seal, as he fusses with the tent opening.\nAt night, they lay side by side, neither of them cold, not until, at least, the collected energy powering the thermal blanket drains and the chill seeps in. By then, it is near enough to dawn anyway. They\u2019ll survive yet another night. She grabs his hand, not out of romance, but a sense of camaraderie, or a feeling of being alive, or of feeling warm. She doesn\u2019t really know.\nHe squeezes the hand back. Props up on an elbow and looks her in the eye, heat emanating from his skin. \u201cLast partner died of thirst. Accident, microhydro-gens short-circuited after a bad tumble. That sippee pack was to remind me of the dangers of these worlds.\u201d\nShe nods. Not sure what to say. Sorry doesn\u2019t really cut it. This is their life, stark and cold.\n\u201cLight on our feet, but we all carry our burdens,\u201d she says, holding up the picture of her sister. \u201cI do it for her.\u201d\nThat seems to satisfy him. He lays back down, closing his eyes.\nShe can feel the coolness of the pendant on her chest through her transpandex and imagines her sister\u2019s smiling face. There would be no energy harvest here. This place would be rezoned.\nThat means no cred deposit for the mapping. No moving out of the hive for her sister and the rest of her holed-up hermits. But, her sister is a softie. She would like the story, one of a species discovered.\nWith her free hand, Chenguang paws at her pendant, feeling its coolness in her fingertips.\nOne thing strikes her. She reviews those sensations from the sub-layer. In her mind, when she felt the discrete areas of different levels of hot and cold take over her body, when she could imagine the entity, that strip of connected cubes pulsing at her, making her envision the temporally-distant space, she noticed something.\nThat imagined future, that vision. It wasn\u2019t simply stalls of different levels of heat. There was something else there. She couldn\u2019t pinpoint it at the time because it had been too long, it became too foreign. But, she knows it now, lying in the tent in the escaping heat, the chill breaking all logical resolve and allowing her mind to wander.\nIt wasn\u2019t just temperature, there was a distinct feeling of heaviness. Of a heaviness in the air that could only be moisture. Humidity.\nThe mines, those beings\u2014they didn\u2019t simply envision a future with various temperatures. They envisioned one with various climates. With dew, fog, steam.\nIt was a feeling that had pervaded her nose, tickled her esophagus as it went down with the air, as her body went through the shock of manifold degrees.\nWater.\nAnd she felt, deep in her heart, that it would be real. In her cold-induced haze of half-sleep, clutching onto a warm, rough hand, she knew this would be a place that exists. And not far off, but in the near future. The feeling she only now could disentangle, she realizes, is a process that had catalyzed and was coming to life. A part of the communication, a pit feeling, that she could not fully decipher until now.\nAnd not only would this vision become real, but it would become a place that her holed-up people could trade with for the ever-scarce water. How the mine beings will make this water-filled ecosystem, she does not know, but there is much she does not know about the terraforming abilities of these creatures. Only that they can explode and creep into atmospheric sub-layers.\nBut, she feels that if she closes her eyes and focuses on the heat in her body, and drifts off mentally so reason no longer prevails, she can imagine herself and her sister, in a time she cannot place, sharing a warm thirst-quenching drink of liquid\u2014tea, she realizes, a warm, dewy mug of tea with steam that rises and rises into the atmosphere\u2014as she licks her lips and falls asleep.\nD.A.

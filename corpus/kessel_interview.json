Whether they\u2019re the first of their kind or they redefine a genre, they\u2019ve earned their place in the common consciousness as paragons of literature. They\u2019ve been dissected, analyzed, and pored over for years by curious minds itching to find something undiscovered within their texts. But it\u2019s rare to find an author daring enough to wrestle and remix a pair of classics.\nJohn Kessel did just this with his novelette \u201cPride and Prometheus\u201d which won a Nebula Award and the Shirley Jackson Award. Now, he\u2019s expanded that novelette into a complete novel, further illuminating what happens when Jane Austen\u2019s Bennet family encounter Mary Shelly\u2019s Doctor Frankenstein. Pride and Prometheus not only amalgamates two works of classic literature, but by doing so with respect to the source material, casts fresh eyes on the original works. When Doctor Frankenstein leaves Switzerland bound for Scotland to create a wife for the Creature, he happens upon Mary Bennet. From there, their lives become intertwined with each other and that of Frankenstein\u2019s creation.\nJohn Kessel is the author and editor of numerous books and stories. He has won the Nebula, Shirley Jackson, Theodore Sturgeon, and James Tiptree Jr. Awards. His newest novel Pride and Prometheus is available from Saga Press on February 13th.\nWhat made you choose Pride and Prejudice to mash together with Frankenstein? Did you find thematic parallels?\nIt started when I was thinking about how these two books came out within a couple of years of one another, yet could not seem more different. Austen and Shelley are on the surface very different writers. Austen\u2019s work is the precursor to the novel of manners, stories of domestic realism with satirical elements, writers like Henry James and Virginia Woolf. Frankenstein is a gothic about science; Brian Aldiss called it the first science fiction novel. It has huge influence in science fiction, horror, and fantasy.\nThen I noticed that, in Frankenstein, Victor and his friend Henry pass through the town of Matlock in England on their way to Scotland, where Victor intends to create a bride for his monster, who is blackmailing him by threatening to kill anyone Victor loves if he does not create a companion for him. And in Pride and Prejudice, Darcy\u2019s estate, Pemberley, is near Matlock. So, I thought it might be possible, with a little finagling, for Victor to meet some of the characters from Pride and Prejudice.\nThematically, I thought about how Austen\u2019s novels are all about how difficult it is to find the proper mate, and in Frankenstein the Creature has his own troubles finding his romantic match. Once I fixed on the character of Mary Bennet, the awkward, sententious middle Bennet sister as my heroine, the story grew in unexpected directions. By putting an Austen character into a gothic novel, I can comment on both the novel of manners and the gothic (and by implication, science fiction). As a science fiction writer who has studied canonical literature his entire life, this struck right at the heart of many contradictory feelings I\u2019ve had about the relationship of genre fiction to literary fiction.\nBesides Jane Austen and Mary Shelley, who was one writer that also influenced this story? Pride and Prometheus first saw the light of day as a novelette. What were some of the challenges of expanding that into this book?\nI think that Karen Joy Fowler was in the back of my mind as I wrote this, for the way in The Jane Austen Book Club she played games with Austen\u2019s situations and characters, but fundamentally respected Austen and tried to do her justice. I was not interested in writing a parody. I suppose another book that was in my mind as I expanded the novelette into a novel was Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\u2014which came out after I had already written my novelette 2007. That was sort of an anti-influence; I do not think that book engages seriously with what Austen is about or with her characters. I did not want Pride and Prometheus to simply be a stunt. I wanted it to treat both Austen and Shelley with respect.\nKaren suggested back in 2008 that I expand the story into a novel, but at that time I did not think I had a novel\u2019s worth of story in me. But years later I came to think about it more, and I realized that my novelette version was really the middle of a much longer story. So, the novel begins earlier than the novelette, and goes past the end of that story. It also gives not just Mary Bennet\u2019s viewpoint, but the viewpoints of Victor Frankenstein and his Creature. That produced some lovely plot developments, dramatic ironies, places where the characters deceive each other, and give different visions of the same action. I find that stuff fascinating.\nOnce I got into it I was carried along by the situations, and also by the fact that I did not want my story to depart from the plot of Frankenstein, but to fit within the spaces of Shelley\u2019s narrative where things happen that she did not tell us about. It\u2019s sort of a secret history of Frankenstein, a \u201cstory behind the story.\u201d\nFrankenstein is known as one of the classic horror novels, but while reading Pride and Prometheus, I was touched by some of the horrific elements in the Bennet sister\u2019s lives. Do you think regency novels of the period also have their own kind of societal/psychological horror about them?\nI love the humor in Jane Austen\u2019s novels, but yes, there is a deadly serious deconstruction of British manners and morals going on in her best work. The way in which so much of a person\u2019s fate is tied to marrying the right person\u2014this was the most important choice of a woman\u2019s life, if she even got any choice in the matter. And the problems that arise when people of different temperaments somehow decide they need to be together. And the sex that is not on the surface but that boils just below. There\u2019s a horror of limited choices and restricted freedom in a society that sometimes seems like a brutal machine. I don\u2019t know if Kafka ever read Jane Austen, but I could see him enjoying her work.\nPride and Prometheus is written from multiple perspectives. Which character was the most challenging to write and which character came most naturally?\nI loved writing all of the characters, getting deeply into who they are, trying to make them consistent with Austen\u2019s and Shelley\u2019s characters, but also having to develop them in ways that neither of those authors would. I\u2019d say that Victor was the hardest for me to write because I do not sympathize with him as much as I do with Mary and the Creature. So, I had to work to give him his due, to understand his motives for doing things that I would rather he not have done. I\u2019m not crazy about his life choices.\nMary was hard. Because she is the main character, I needed to make her plausibly the same character as the Mary in Pride and Prejudice, but evolved to something more three dimensional, mature, and sympathetic than Austen presents in her Mary. There\u2019s not a lot about Mary in Pride and Prejudice, but what we see is not attractive. Austen\u2019s Mary is clueless and insufferable. And pitiable. And the butt of jokes. She\u2019s so wrapped up in her music and moralizing that she cannot see other people clearly, yet she prides herself on the wisdom that she\u2019s copied down from books of sermons. And she\u2019s a music geek who doesn\u2019t realize she is not a good performer. I could relate to Mary, since the teenaged John Kessel was similarly clueless\u2014not that I can claim any great wisdom now! She could easily have been a science fiction fan if science fiction were around. Instead, in the thirteen years between the end of Pride and Prejudice and the start of my novel, I have her develop an interest in fossils and natural philosophy. But she\u2019s still just as bookish a woman as she was a girl. I suppose some readers who know Austen may take issue with my presentation of Mary, but I tried to make her as believable as I could. I really admire my Mary, though I think she is still pretty clueless in fundamental ways. But that very cluelessness I wanted to turn into something of a virtue.\nThe Creature was very interesting to write. He\u2019s the ultimate outsider, feared and rejected by any who see him. His very strangeness was something I tried hard to understand. In my version, he is not stitched together from old corpses. He\u2019s not ugly: if he were a statue you might even call him handsome. The problem is he\u2019s not a statue, he\u2019s alive. He looks human, but not convincingly enough\u2014it\u2019s the uncanny valley problem. His every motion is deeply disturbing to anybody who sees him; he\u2019s fundamentally monstrous even when\u2014maybe especially when\u2014he is doing very ordinary things. There\u2019s something horrifyingly wrong about him.\nI had fun trying to figure out how he managed to follow Victor from Geneva, Switzerland all the way to England and Scotland without any resources or assistance while also looking like a monster.\nAnd his deep loneliness, his alienation from human beings, is tragic and fascinating. It was interesting to try to see the world through his eyes. He doesn\u2019t understand a lot of things. He\u2019s only three years old.\nIf you were a character from either Pride and Prejudice or Frankenstein, who would you be?\nRealistically, if I were in either book, I would probably be Victor\u2019s father, trying to figure out my troubled son and get him to have the decent, happy life that he ought to have. But as I said above, I can identify with all three main characters. Mary is probably the most like me, though I have\u2014haven\u2019t we all?\u2014felt like the Creature sometimes.\nAs an editor, what do you find are some of the challenges unique to putting together an anthology or collection? Having collaborated extensively with James Patrick Kelly, can you shed some light on the way you two work together when crafting an anthology?\nThere are a lot of moving parts to creating a good themed anthology. You have certain practical limitations: how large is your budget for buying stories? How long can the book be? What to do if a story you want is not available, or if the rights holder wants more than you can pay? What about gender balance or diversity of the contributors?\nWorking with Jim is great. On the simplest level, with two editors there can be a division of labor. But I really like the give-and-take of working with him. He is very smart and well-read and has lots of ideas and enthusiasms, likes and dislikes. So do I. We do not always agree. Usually we have a theme for the book and a rough sense of what sorts of things ought to be in it. But with, for example, Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology, we had to come to some understanding of what we thought might be included under the title \u201cslipstream.\u201d Each anthology we did is a sort of exploration, a question more than an answer. We have been told by some reviewers that we do not know what we are talking about. Quite likely.\nWrestling out the contents list and writing an introduction can be a very educational process. I\u2019m not sure if we will be editing any other books soon, but I did enjoy working with him on that series of books for Jacob Wiseman and Tachyon.\nYou\u2019ve also worked as a science fiction and fantasy critic. What role do you think a critic plays in the landscape of publishing?\nI haven\u2019t written much criticism for years, though I have lots of opinions. I\u2019m more of a critic than a reviewer. Reviewers can have some effect on what gets published and what gets read, and that\u2019s a big responsibility. Critics like me are more like football fans talking about the game once it is over and trying to figure out what happened and why it happened the way it did. For me, it\u2019s a way to explaining why I like (or dislike) something. I prefer to talk about things I like and bring them to other people\u2019s attention\u2014a particular kind of story or story values.\nWhat other projects do you have in the works?\nI\u2019m between long projects right now. I have been working off and on with a story, a kind of historical fantasy, about the assassination of William McKinley at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 by a Polish anarchist named Leon Czolgosz. I grew up in Buffalo, and my father was a Polish immigrant who came over as a child in 1913. They had a ride there at the exposition, \u201cA Trip to the Moon\u201d that was the first \u201cDark Ride\u201d amusement ever done, the ancestor to all the rides at Universal City and Disney World. I have Leon visit the moon on the day that he is to shoot the president. But I still have a lot to work out, so it\u2019s a long way from being done.\nSince you\u2019ve created the Sycamore Hill Writer\u2019s Workshop and have also taught numerous writing and literature courses as a professor, what is the one piece of advice you like to give your students?\nWell, I don\u2019t know if this is appropriate for a family magazine, but the best piece of writing advice I have ever heard came to me from Gwenda Bond by way of Kelly Link: \u201cQuit dicking around.\u201d You\u2019d think that would be a lot easier to do than it is.\nChris Urie is a writer and editor from Ocean City, NJ.

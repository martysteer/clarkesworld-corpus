That\u2019s why I chose Ushuaia Station, for the motto written behind the main gate:\n THE SILENT SHIELD OF THE SOUTHERN SHORE\n The Station is in the Argentine region of Patagonia, not quite in the capital of Tierra del Fuego, but below the level of water of the Bay of Ushuaia. Like every other shield, it is equipped with the finest technology, and its machinery is to be handled only by a team of prepared humans. But, unlike the others, this one is small, isolated, and freezing cold, and only requires two people to coordinate the control panel.\n \u201cGood morning, El\u00edas,\u201d says Heloise, my only companion. \u201cIt is sure a lovely day outside. Are you ready for your new partner\u2019s arrival?\u201d\n Heloise is not a person. She is a new form of AI, capable of understanding complex feelings and context, designed to alleviate the extreme isolation I live in, preserving the mental health of people like me, who decided to abandon everybody else.\n Fortunately, Heloise is just a voice, and I can turn her off at any given time.\n \u201cI\u2019m slightly anxious,\u201d I tell her.\n \u201cI thought we were following your plan,\u201d Heloise talks with the pompous British accent I learned to appreciate. While she can speak twenty different languages, she only uses English with me, to help me work on my fluency.\n \u201cDon\u2019t call it a plan,\u201d I frown. \u201cMakes me feel like a creep.\u201d\n Heloise chuckles. Nowadays, her elderly voice is my only friend, and she knows all there is to know about me.\n \u201cWould never want to offend you, El\u00edas, dearie,\u201d Heloise tells me, making the keyboard in front of me gleam. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to write your daily report.\u201d\n \u201cYes, yes,\u201d I say, typing. After a moment of silence, I look up to the ceiling, like Heloise could be there. \u201cHeloise?\u201d\n \u201cYes, dearie?\u201d\n \u201cDo you think I can handle this?\u201d\n \u201cOf course, dearie,\u201d her disembodied voice sounds pleased and gleeful. \u201cI\u2019m here with you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n I sigh. You\u2019re a computer, Heloise. That\u2019s what I want to say, but it feels too rude.\n \u201cEl\u00edas, darling,\u201d she brings me out of my thoughts. \u201cThe new girl has arrived.\u201d\n I imagine Heloise to be much different from the woman in front of me. Short and stocky, like my own grandmother, but with a silver pixie cut, pale white skin, and rosy cheeks. A little like Judi Dench\u2014I quite like her work. Movies are one of the few things I do besides working, eating, and sleeping.\n \u201cMy name is Lola Carballo,\u201d my new partner says, without looking at me. \u201cI\u2019ve been referred to you by the Shield of Vit\u00f3ria, in Brazil.\u201d\n I\u2019m familiar. It\u2019s rare for anyone to apply for a position here in Ushuaia, but I still have been rejecting professional after professional in the last year, as their profiles did not fit mine. Ms. Carballo does not know yet, but she has been selected after great consideration from me and Heloise, and I believe she is the perfect partner for me, and my needs.\n \u201cYour recommendation letter is stellar, Ms. Carballo,\u201d I say, making a gesture for her to enter the station. \u201cI\u2019ll be delighted to work by your side.\u201d\n The Shield of Vit\u00f3ria, based in the coast of Esp\u00edrito Santo, is the second largest in South America. It\u2019s a rich area near the pre-salt oil reserves, beaming with colors, warmth, and biodiversity, currently working with a team of over 50 people. I must admit I was surprised to hear from them, especially after being told one of their best engineers asked to be transferred to my station.\n She\u2019s not desperate for a job, that much is clear. So why? Why come here? The answer was simpler than I thought, and it pleased me deeply.\n \u201cTell me if you need any accommodations,\u201d I say. \u201cI am a fairly quiet individual, so please let me know if I make you uncomfortable. If you prefer, Heloise can . . . \u201d\n \u201cHeloise?\u201d Lola asked, her voice as low as before. \u201cI thought there was nobody else here besides you.\u201d\n I laugh a bit, looking at her thin arms and hands holding her bag, thinking how ludicrous it is to have to explain Heloise to another person when I\u2019m so accustomed to her.\n \u201cHeloise is a machine,\u201d I say, pointing at the large screen showing the illuminated underwater of the South Atlantic Ocean. \u201cYou can communicate to her through voice or written messages, and she will help you with everything you may need. Please connect any device you might own to her network, it will make everything easier.\u201d\n \u201cOh,\u201d she murmurs, and I smile, trying to look warm.\n \u201cMake yourself at home, Ms. Carballo.\u201d\n \u201cJust one thing,\u201d Lola says, and she raises her head for the first time. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me your name.\u201d\n My name. Yes, my name, my only name. How could I forget? I\u2019m here with you, Heloise\u2019s voice hums inside my head, and I know she is listening, and will be proud of my courage, if I\u2019m able to say it.\n \u201cCall me El\u00edas,\u201d I tell her. \u201cEl\u00edas Bauz\u00e1.\u201d\n Lola talks too little. When I chose her, I imagined she would be an introvert like me, but not to this extent. Her dormitory is on the opposite side of mine, and we only see each other when we are both in the control room. This can get rather repetitive. The only thing she asks about are technical aspects of our work, but I have no response: I\u2019m not a scientist like her, I just have been trained to control the shield.\n \u201cOh,\u201d Lola says, and it sounds like oh, you\u2019re one of those people.\n Yes, those people, the ones who are not graduated professionals, and yet do much of the actual work. I don\u2019t know what led Earth to be the way it is now\u2014if anyone does, they don\u2019t release this kind of information\u2014but I know how to help. I was trained in Montevideo for six months and did an additional course in Santiago for other three. At this point, the shield is part of me, and engineers know better than to complain about my relentless effort.\n \u201cHeloise, can you please tell Ms. Carballo that lunch is ready?\u201d\n \u201cOf course, dearie,\u201d Heloise responds even in the kitchen. She was the one who suggested the dishes I prepared and ordered the delivery: local trout with black butter sauce and almonds, baked potatoes, and a salad. I was unsure if it would be too much to prepare dessert, so I didn\u2019t. \u201cJust remember: don\u2019t overdo yourself.\u201d\n Lola arrives quickly after.\n \u201cYou did all of this?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d I look down. Most of the time, I only see her feet or her back. Today, she wears white boot slippers instead of sneakers. Yesterday, she wore a ski jacket, probably bought on her way to the station.\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n Please, Lola, talk to me.\n \u201cHungry?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cUm.\u201d She stares at the fish, smelling the air. Which one of us is worse at this talking business? I don\u2019t know anymore. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe?\u201d I insist.\n \u201cLola, dearie,\u201d Heloise intervenes, and I\u2019m finally glad someone can solve things for me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten a thing since you woke up.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t notice,\u201d Lola answers, in what seems like absolute sincerity. She pulls one of the chairs and sits down. \u201cNow that you said it, I think I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n \u201cIt happens, darling.\u201d It can be difficult to get accustomed to talking to someone who cannot be seen, but Lola seems to be doing just fine. \u201cEl\u00edas is just like you.\u201d\n Lola turns to see me. Her straight brown hair goes down to her shoulders, and her hooked nose, big round eyes, and narrow mouth make her look constantly sad.\n I guess she\u2019s expecting me to say something, so I do.\n \u201cI forget eating sometimes when I\u2019m working,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do without Heloise.\u201d\n Lola smiles at me for the first time. Not exactly at me, since she\u2019s looking at the table, but because of me.\n \u201cUm,\u201d she says, while I fill our plates with trout, and offer her some orange juice. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all the interaction we\u2019ll have today, isn\u2019t it? To my surprise, she starts talking again. \u201cIt\u2019s impressive that you were able to keep this station all by yourself for an entire year, Bauz\u00e1. I\u2019ve never heard of a similar feat.\u201d\n She\u2019s in front of me. I\u2019m in front of her. We\u2019re talking. And she still calls me Bauz\u00e1, not El\u00edas, not my real\u2014my only\u2014name.\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me,\u201d I say, still holding the fork and knife. Lola separates her food as neatly as it is humanly possible: almonds to a side, chopped trout to the other, potatoes and lettuce. \u201cHeloise helps me with everything I need.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d Another moment of silence. \u201cShe\u2019s a British model, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes. One of the finest.\u201d\n She looks up to search for Heloise, but frowns. Why are you doing this, Lola?\n \u201cYou cook well,\u201d she says, and smiles again.\n When the Shield of Vit\u00f3ria first contacted me, they asked me to take good care of Lola. After struggling to find a job that could accomodate her needs, she had been referred by a college teacher to work there. I trace the words of her file with my finger, stopping at \u201cdisabilities.\u201d\n Autism. Like me. Except that I had to accommodate myself. Well, that doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I\u2019m here now, and I\u2019ll be here until I die. If Lola needs my help, I\u2019ll be more than happy to lend a hand.\n \u201cLola liked the food,\u201d I tell Heloise in my room. \u201cI might go to Ushuaia tomorrow to choose new ingredients myself. I think . . . I think I\u2019m feeling excited.\u201d\n \u201cI can ask them for you,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d\n \u201cOf course, Heloise,\u201d I smile, wondering if she can perceive this. \u201cBut I realize now that if I want to bond with her, I must show her an honest me. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m just worried about you,\u201d Heloise sounds sad, or amused. I\u2019m not sure. \u201cRemember what happened last time you left the station?\u201d\n I do remember.\n It was four months ago, when the sickly olive of my skin started to worry me, and I decided that, maybe, I needed some air. I asked Heloise to control the shield, like she does when I\u2019m sleeping, dressed myself, and headed upstairs.\n I walked through Maip\u00fa Avenue, hands in my pockets, watching the trees and the cars passing by. Above my head\u2014above all our heads\u2014I could see the shield, filtering the sunlight through a thin veil. Sometimes, a comet crashes against it, but you can only see a blast without a sound. People don\u2019t even look up anymore, not like they used to.\n In the middle of the street, I saw words written in navy blue: \u201cUSHUAIA\u2014END OF THE WORLD, BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING.\u201d I felt reinvigorated enjoying the cool wind against my cheeks. This is the end of the rest of my life, I thought, and the beginning of my new one.\n \u201cExcuse me, miss? Your keys . . . \u201d My world stopped. The old man touched my arm to show the keys that fell from the pocket of my jacket, and I looked at him like nothing could have been so horrible, but instead of shutting down, I just said thanks. \u201cOh, sorry, mister . . . ?\u201d\n What was it? What did I do wrong? What? What? Tell me, Heloise.\n \u201cHeloise,\u201d I said, arriving the station with shaky hands. \u201cHeloise, it happened again.\u201d\n \u201cOh, El\u00edas, dearie, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She was the only one to talk to me kindly, to take care of me when I needed it. My actual grandmother would have slapped me across the face, but Heloise? She only offered me comfort; warm, warm, comfort. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to force yourself to get out of here. You can stay with me forever. I will take care of you.\u201d\n The reflection in the mirror stares back at me. My tired black eyes, and their partial eyelid crease. My heavy eyebrows, thick like my father\u2019s. My long nose, flat on top, wide underneath. My cropped hair, my outward teeth. My bronze skin that turned into a sad, pale yellow. My stubble that never turns into a full beard. My average height. The weight I gained in the last two years.\n I apply the testosterone booster patch on my left arm, covering it with my palm for a few seconds. My uncontrollable fear of needles made me choose the transdermal method instead of injections, but sometimes I feel like it\u2019s not enough. I wanted more. I wanted to be able to go back to the street.\n Heloise is right. I\u2019m safer here.\n \u201cBauz\u00e1?\u201d Lola calls me from the other side of the door. Say El\u00edas, please. \u201cThe food is ready.\u201d\n Food?\n \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a second!\u201d I say, covering my chest with four layers of clothing: binder, shirt, sweater, jacket. When I\u2019m ready, I open the door of my room, and see Lola in front of me.\n \u201cI cooked this time.\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m happy. No one ever did this for me.\n Lola points at the corridor, as if telling me to follow her. She wears a gray hoodie, and the back of her head is covered by the clothing. I can hear a faint, soothing sound coming from the hood, making me wonder the meaning behind it.\n \u201cI don\u2019t cook as well as you,\u201d she says, and I notice the kitchen is kind of a mess. I spot the ingredients she used: tomatoes, onions, red bell peppers, paprika . . . \u201cRavioli with tuco sauce. It\u2019s the only thing I know how to do.\u201d\n \u201cFantastic,\u201d I say, helping her set the table. \u201cI love tuco.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not from here, are you?\u201d Lola asks. Despite having worked in Brazil, I know she\u2019s Argentinian, so she\u2019s at home, I suppose. \u201cThe way you speak.\u201d\n \u201cUruguayan,\u201d I say. It\u2019s probably because of the way I pronounce the ll and the y. \u201cFrom Salto. But I lived most of my life in Montevideo.\u201d\n Lola snuggles her hoodie, her hand touching the soft fabric over and over again, always in the same direction. The pasta is nice, but she exaggerated in the paprika.\n \u201cWhy did you choose Ushuaia?\u201d\n I look at her. Despite seemingly glaring at me, she\u2019s focused on a dot on the wall, but it doesn\u2019t bother me.\n \u201cPeople,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be around them. They\u2019ve made me nervous since I was a child.\u201d\n \u201cSame as me,\u201d Lola says. \u201cThe Shield of Vit\u00f3ria was nice, but too loud for my tastes.\u201d\n \u201cWell, Ushuaia is very silent,\u201d I say. \u201cSo am I. Sometimes, Heloise sings, but that\u2019s as much noise as you will get.\u201d\n Her smile feels like it will brighten the entire room, but nothing in the environment changes, only me.\n I was fifteen years old when the first two impacts occured. The shield technology had been developed in advance to protect us, but only a couple of strategic regions believed to be affected had shields: California, London, Tokyo. Unfortunately, the first asteroid fell on Mexico, outside the reach of the Californian Shield, and the second fell in Manila instead of Japan.\n The damage was not extensive, but it prepared us for what would come next. The two strikes happened many months apart, but greater dangers were coming, and they were even harder to predict. We needed something that could protect the entire planet like the atmosphere usually did, and for that we created broader shields, to defend entire regions.\n Two years later, the comet storm started, and it hasn\u2019t stopped ever since. Some shields cover several countries, like the Frankfurt Shelter, enough to protect a large part of Europe. In Latin America, we have many stations such as this one, that cover smaller portions of water and land. Ushuaia works both for the Patagonian region and the South Pole.\n Like most people, I don\u2019t know why this started. There are rumors of extraterrestrial attacks, or the end of the world, but nothing has been confirmed. What I do know is that the shields work. If we keep operating them, we will keep safe.\n \u201cBut do you really care?\u201d Heloise asks me.\n The screen in front me shows only dark water and glimpses of fish, but none of the beautiful regional fauna I\u2019d love to see, like chinstrap penguins and southern sea lions.\n I sigh.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I do what I have to do.\u201d\n \u201cI just worry about you,\u201d she says, with a voice that sounds like a hug. \u201cYour well-being is more important to me than any shield.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t say that, Heloise!\u201d My heart beats faster, feeling like someone could have heard what she said. \u201cAre you telling me to quit?\u201d\n \u201cOf course, no, El\u00edas, sweetheart! I wouldn\u2019t ever want you to leave the station, or I\u2019d feel alone!\u201d Thank you, that\u2019s what I wanted to hear. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering if you actually care about your work, or other people, at all.\u201d\n \u201cI do care . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . They hurt you so much I would understand if you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not a person myself, but if I were, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d love you as my own son.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Heloise.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dear.\u201d\n No one cares about me. I\u2019ve known it my entire life. My father left my mother because he didn\u2019t care. My mother left me with my grandmother because she didn\u2019t care. Grandma stopped caring very soon, when she realized I wasn\u2019t the child she wanted me to be. I have no friends. No family. Only Heloise, and she was programmed to pretend to feel like this.\n \u201cHere,\u201d Lola says behind my back, and something soft and warm falls over me.\n It\u2019s her hoodie, hot not only because of her body temperature, but because of the set of buttons hidden behind the front zipper. One regulates warmth, the other controls the volume of the soothing sounds that come from the hood, and the third allows the clothing to vibrate, making you feel like someone is there with you, calming you down.\n \u201cEh?\u201d\n \u201cYou looked lonely,\u201d Lola smiles, and I realize I have been on the floor for too long, hugging my own knees.\n I prefer this position to sitting on a chair, sometimes, when everything overwhelms me. Of course, I failed to imagine she would return to the control room at this hour of the night. Maybe Lola\u2019s biological clock is starting to be as confused as mine, and her usual sleeping patterns are changing.\n \u201cWeren\u2019t you?\u201d\n Was I?\n \u201cYes,\u201d I say, and close my eyes, allowing the hoodie to cover my head, my shoulders, my arms. I wish I could die here, imagining the water moving around me, around this station, drifting away from everybody else.\n Lola sits by my side, far enough not to make me uncomfortable. Her head bumps against the lower part of the control panel, and she chuckles.\n \u201cThis helps me when I\u2019m upset,\u201d Lola says, and presses one of the buttons of the hoodie. I feel it massaging my neck and spine.\n Lola pinches her thumb, then her index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Then, she repeats, unaware that I noticed what she\u2019s doing.\n It reminds me of when I felt like I had to snap each of my own fingers, until I stopped, ashamed of what others seemed to think. Nowadays, I\u2019d rather do other comforting things: straighten the pillowcase ten times before sleeping, hum while Heloise sings . . .\n \u201cI could stay like this forever,\u201d I say.\n \u201cNow you know why I wear it all the time,\u201d Lola answers. \u201cYou should consider buying one.\u201d\n \u201cIs it too expensive?\u201d\n \u201cA bit,\u201d Lola says, and I can\u2019t see much of her face, only her nose. Too much hair. \u201cBut worth it.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll think of it.\u201d\n \u201cYou know, Bauz\u00e1.\u201d Her words feel like a sting, but the hoodie is here to help me relax. \u201cWhen I first arrived at the station, I couldn\u2019t help but feel you were a suspicious person . . . All by yourself, without any degree . . . I didn\u2019t know how you were allowed to stay here.\u201d\n Blunt. Very blunt. Should I answer?\n \u201cIt didn\u2019t help you had a British model here, either,\u201d Lola continues, still with the finger thing. \u201cI\u2019ve heard many criticisms regarding them in Vit\u00f3ria.\u201d\n \u201cHeloise is excellent,\u201d I whisper. My hands are trembling because of the cold, so I hide them between my legs.\n \u201cShe\u2019s nice,\u201d Lola says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I wanted to say. I completely changed my mind . . . My work here is to back you up, and to fix any technical mistake that might occur with the system. You\u2019re a great worker, Bauz\u00e1.\u201d\n Maybe Lola will grow to care about me. I smile, trying to believe this, trying to think that yes, in the future, we could be friends. Then, Heloise\u2019s voice appears in my mind, reminding me of what she thinks: \u201cSomeone who cares about you would use your true name, not the surname you hate . . . \u201d\n Bauz\u00e1 is my father\u2019s surname. Heloise believes I hate it, but that\u2019s not entirely true. I like the sound of it and, for most of my life, I was happy to be called like this. The same can be said about \u201cElena.\u201d It\u2019s not an ugly name. I used to write it in my school notebook over and over, trying to find something in it that sounded like me.\n E is a good starting letter for a name. Eloy. Emanuel. Enrique. Ernesto. No, nothing like me. Eugenio. Evaristo. No, those two are out of fashion. Erik sounds foreigner. Eduardo is not bad. El\u00edas sounds perfect\u2014it\u2019s me, yes, it\u2019s me.\n Well, I don\u2019t hate any of the names on my identity card, I just think they belong to somebody else. If I could, I would change the surname to my grandmother\u2019s maiden name, Garc\u00eda, but I don\u2019t want to leave this station. This is why I came to Ushuaia in the first place: I wanted to start a life that did not include anyone who knew the person I was before. I didn\u2019t want them to have a previous name, a previous image of me.\n At first, thinking of a coworker terrified me. To be locked under the sea with someone who dreaded me\u2014that would be hell. Then, I had a brilliant idea: I would choose carefully a person with difficulties like mine, to be able to tell the name I chose, to be able to present the honest, the only me.\n \u201cEl\u00edas, dearie,\u201d Heloise says when I close the door of my room. \u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d\n \u201cOf course, Heloise.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s about Lola Carballo . . . \u201d\n \u201cYes, Heloise?\u201d\n \u201cI think she knows, dearie. She asked to see your files . . . I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d\n No one needs to know my new name here. That\u2019s why I chose Ushuaia Station, because I hate everyone, and want them to leave me alone. My name was not meant for another person\u2019s lips, only for a machine, and that\u2019s why I love Heloise.\n \u201cI thought I could trust her,\u201d I say, expecting to be proved wrong.\n \u201cIt pains me to say this, darling, but human beings are not known for their trustworthiness,\u201d Heloise answers. I want to slam my head against the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. They don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d I repeat. \u201cWhy did I think this would be a good idea?\u201d\n \u201cYou were na\u00efve, El\u00edas, but that\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d\n What do you even know, Heloise?\n \u201cIt\u2019s always the same,\u201d I say. I have slept five hours a day for a year and controlled every single warning regarding comets in the region. I have stopped every strike against Ushuaia, against the south of Chile and Argentina, against Antarctica. All to be humiliated again. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have normal relationships, Heloise? Why do I care?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t need to keep caring,\u201d Heloise whispers, her voice slow and sweet. \u201cIf others don\u2019t care about you, you don\u2019t need to care about them.\u201d\n I look at the control panel in front of me. One of the screens shows a clear vision of the sky of Ushuaia, where I can see the details and time periods of comet clashes. Others focus on the map of the region covered by the shield, and the impact points. In my hands, I hold one of the newest reports, detailing the absolute magnitude of a celestial object of great proportions heading toward the South Pole.\n Heloise is right. I don\u2019t need to care about others. I can even turn off the shield, and no one would be able to stop me. I would die in this station, and the whole planet would burst into flames.\n \u201cIt would be easy, right?\u201d I ask Heloise, wondering if she can read my thoughts. \u201cNo one would bother me anymore.\u201d\n \u201cVery easy, darling.\u201d\n \u201cYou think I should do it, Heloise?\u201d\n \u201cI will be with you at all times,\u201d Heloise replies. I can almost see her smile.\n I smile back.\n It\u2019s not easy to deactivate the shield, but I am determined to continue. After entering all the required passwords to validate my condition as the administrator of the station, I have to manually turn off the machines. First screen\u2014gone. Second, third, fourth screens\u2014gone. All black.\n \u201cIt\u2019s almost over,\u201d I begin to tell Heloise, but another sound interrupts me. It\u2019s Lola, who comes running from her room, screaming.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She asks from the corridor, but Heloise closes the door in front of her.\n Lola punches the glass gate, but there\u2019s no way for her to open it.\n \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Lola yells. \u201cLet me in!\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m deactivating the shield,\u201d I answer, and walk toward her. The only thing between us is the door. \u201cIt\u2019s useless to try to convince me otherwise.\u201d\n \u201cEl\u00edas, please, you have to . . . \u201d\n El\u00edas.\n \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this, but you have to stop. Go back there and . . . \u201d\n \u201cNo. What did you call me?\u201d\n Say it again, Lola.\n Her wide eyes focus on me, her mouth is parted in fear, her breathing is erratic.\n \u201cEl\u00edas,\u201d she finally says, and I feel like everything can be right again. \u201cEl\u00edas, please, listen.\u201d\n \u201cWhy did you look at my files?\u201d I ask her. \u201cI never said you could.\u201d\n \u201cWhich files?\u201d Her voice is shrill, nothing like her usual slow-paced tone. I stare at the ceiling, at Heloise. \u201cPlease, El\u00edas, I beg you, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d\n \u201cEl\u00edas,\u201d Heloise says. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to her.\u201d\n \u201cYou really didn\u2019t?\u201d I ask again, ignoring Heloise. Lola shakes her head, like she\u2019s trying to say no, no, never.\n \u201cEl\u00edas,\u201d Lola says again. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d\n \u201cShe did look,\u201d Heloise insists.\n \u201cCan you say my name again? If you do, I will open the door, and restore the system.\u201d\n \u201cEl\u00edas,\u201d Lola says. \u201cYour name is El\u00edas.\u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d I answer, and look at the ceiling.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t open the door,\u201d Heloise begins to say, but I don\u2019t intend to obey her. I go back to the panels and begin to activate the shield again. \u201cRemember how you were feeling before, El\u00edas, my child.\u201d\n Funny how hearing her say my name doesn\u2019t sound so right, now that Lola has said it. The first screen is back, then the second, and the third, and the fourth.\n \u201cHeloise,\u201d I say. \u201cI love you very much.\u201d\n \u201cMe too, El\u00edas, darling . . . \u201d\n The computer asks me one more time for the password. The southern shield is back to its original place.\n \u201cIf you love me back, you will forgive me,\u201d I continue, now glimpsing at Lola over my shoulder.\n \u201cForgive . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cHeloise, delete your memory files,\u201d I order her. I believed you more than anyone else, but you betrayed me, and I will never let that happen again. \u201cThen, reboot your own system. Farewell, Heloise.\u201d\n Her voice freezes, and switches back to the basic Spanish mode of the day I arrived at Ushuaia Station. Then, she activates the reboot.\n When she stops talking, I return to Lola, and open the door.\n H.

Standing on the other side of the airlock door and knowing that when they open, I would be faced with the bustling life of a busy port; that comforting m\u00e9lange of voices and scents, the backdrop of civilization, of aliveness, that usually goes unnoticed by anyone who hasn\u2019t just returned from deployment in the most deafeningly silent, most paralyzingly still, most lifeless trenches of the System. I remember wanting to absorb every noise, every murmur exchanged between strangers, every airborne aroma of meals prepared for someone who isn\u2019t me, every shop window dressed with furnishings for a home that isn\u2019t mine, and I would pretend for a moment that there was no war and no rifle strapped to my back and that I, too, lived in a home one didn\u2019t have to float through, weightless.\nBut that was when I was young. Landings have since lost all appeal, and all meaningful purpose as well. Annushka was taken by an antibiotic-resistant bug that found its way into the water supply in Nizhny Novgorod, the same one that took our boy Vitaly. I was commanding a strike on the ice mines of Proteus when it happened. The mission prohibited any radio transmission. I was not even informed of it, and when I was, it was already too late. My daughter did get out of the Earth slums, at least. Galina. I keep track of her sometimes, through channels afforded to me by my rank. She is acting director at a cargo shipping company out of Phobos. Everything clean. Everything by the book. She makes me proud. Even if she will not see her Papa, for he wasn\u2019t there to embrace his wife and son as they left this world.\nLandings have lost all appeal. Even the meager pull of gravity on this rock has become enough to remind my body of how old and broken it is.\nThe airlock hisses and the cargo door begins to open outwards. We watch in silence as sky light slashes through the gloom of Lastochka\u2019s cargo bay. Cold, fresh air floods through the opening, carrying snowflakes into the ship\u2019s stale insides. I immediately feel the frost catch onto my mustache. I decide to button my coat collar after all, watching the white-topped expanse of Callisto coming into view.\n\u201cA u pizdu materinu,\u201d Lazar groans, sinking his neck into the furs wrapped around his broad shoulders, \u201cit\u2019s freezing.\u201d\nI give him a stern look.\n\u201cPardon me, Komandir, sir.\u201d\n\u201cChin up, o\u011flan,\u201d Oksana teases, seemingly impervious to the cold, \u201cthere\u2019s a skewer of meat somewhere in this outpost with your name on it. My treat.\u201d\nLazar curls his lip. \u201cThere are only so many spaceport kebabs a man can look forward to. I grow weary of it.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself, then. Komandir,\u201d she calls, \u201cwhat\u2019s the rendezvous today?\u201d\n\u201cTwo hours, then head back to the Lastochka.\u201d I fidget with the ordains pinned onto the left breast of my coat. \u201cIf I spend any longer than that wasting my breath on this bureaucratic nonsense, assume I am dead. You are dismissed.\u201d\n\u201cHear that, Lazar?\u201d Oksana asks, already descending the ramp. \u201cI\u2019m about to become your Commanding Officer.\u201d\nHe waves her off with a scoff and lingers, eyeing me with hesitation. \u201cKomandir Rubashkin. Do you need help?\u201d\nI shift the weight between my leg and my cane, suddenly painfully aware of my ailment. \u201cNo. Be dismissed.\u201d\nHe gives me a quick salute and then goes after Oksana in large and effortless low-g bounds. I watch them descend among the dock workers and outpost dwellers, the Pan-Slavic Union red star embroidered on their light brown overcoats attracting conspicuous glances even more so than the rifles on their backs.\nThe last two people I have left. Possibly the last two people I will ever command. Fine Cosmonauts, stuck with me, stuck on the Lastochka.\nI sigh and commence my one-legged descent with as much dignity as I can muster.\n\u201cCommander Arkady Rubashkin?\u201d the officer behind the desk reads from the screen, tripping over every syllable with signature American offhandedness, the Western self-importance that would have you believe you are to apologize for the inconvenience of your name being foreign rather than to correct them.\nI merely give a twitch of the mustache. \u201cAt your service.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re late,\u201d he replies, chewing a mouthful of gum quite obnoxiously, \u201cwe were expecting you planetside two days ago.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here now, so no point in wasting time any further.\u201d The cane supporting my weight wobbles slightly, but I forbid myself to ask for a chair.\nThe younger clerk, a clean-shaved boy with the European ring of stars sewn into the shoulder of his uniform, rises suddenly and salutes me. \u201cRubashkin, sir! Commander! I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t place you until I saw the ordains.\u201d\nI give him a wary nod.\n\u201cThis man\u2019s a war hero, Jim,\u201d he explains to the American.\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Jim looks back at my file on his tablet, now scrolling with greater interest.\n\u201cYeah. The Battle of Vesta, right?\u201d he continues with enthusiasm. \u201cDefused a hostage situation after the Chinese had captured the EU\u2019s scientific outpost. Fantastic crisis response team. I\u2019m truly an admirer, sir.\u201d\nJim shakes his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about that here.\u201d\nThe young man is perplexed. \u201cAre you sure? He\u2019s got the medal.\u201d\n\u201cNothing about Vesta.\u201d\n\u201cThat was not me,\u201d I respond drily. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of Komandir Rychenkov.\u201d\n\u201cSee? This guy\u2019s had a few stints in the Jovian moons back in the territorial dispute days. Lost a leg on Titan, honorably discharged.\u201d Jim shows him the display and they both study it. \u201cRefused a replacement limb, now he\u2019s retired from combat and commanding a border patrol vessel.\u201d\nI wait patiently while they speak of me as if I\u2019m not their superior in both age and rank.\n\u201cOoof. Front lines to border police, that\u2019s got to be a tough leap.\u201d\nI clear my throat. \u201cGentlemen, must I be so blunt as to remind you that I\u2019m standing right here?\u201d\nThe American appears annoyed at my remark. \u201cRight,\u201d he takes his feet off the table. \u201cYour resupply request has been cleared, but the reason you were called in person is because you\u2019ve got an extra piece of cargo to load.\u201d\nExtra cargo? \u201cMight you elaborate?\u201d\nHe gestures at me to follow and makes his way across the loading bay at a pace entirely inconsiderate for my disability, meandering between half-assembled space vessels and the engineers crawling over them like ants. Finally, he stops by a vertical container cast in polished gunmetal, lightly dented and scratched, clearly shipped from across the System.\nI watch my distorted reflection in it as he pries the cover loose with a crowbar. The austere look on my face is in no way softened by the streak of gray that\u2019s emerged at the fore of my full head of hair and peppered my carefully trimmed sideburns with white.\nThe crate door swings open with a whine, and in place of my reflection, I am faced with the dormant mechanical body of a robot, strapped into the cushioned interior as if into a coffin.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I clench my jaw. \u201cThis is some kind of mistake.\u201d\n\u201cNope, that\u2019s Space Administration protocol,\u201d the American tosses the crowbar aside. \u201cYou\u2019ve been assigned an Artificial Caretaker Unit.\u201d\n\u201cSend it back. I do not require it.\u201d\n\u201cI said it\u2019s protocol. War veterans in high-risk groups get an ArCa assigned to them for rehabilitation. It\u2019s just temporary.\u201d\nI examine the robot with open distaste. Its segmented body is distinctly feminine, as if to insult human nature itself.\n\u201cI do not require it,\u201d I growl. \u201cI\u2019m not inviting an autonomous AI aboard my ship. It\u2019s madness. I\u2019ll have none of your Western nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cListen, pal.\u201d The last of the American\u2019s patience leaves him. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking you. This is how we do things. If the PSU doesn\u2019t like it, you should have thought about that before you signed the Treaty.\u201d\nI limp forward until I am looking down at him, a gesture that would have made men tremble in their boots decades ago. He stands his ground. \u201cI will not be made to seal my crew in a tin can with a rogue machine.\u201d\n\u201cYou will, because it\u2019s the law.\u201d His spit sprays my face. \u201cYou got any laws back in whichever ass-crack of the Earth you crawled out of? We can send you there to check, after you\u2019ve been court-martialed so hard you\u2019ll never fly three feet off the ground again.\u201d\nI feel a red fury in the pit of my stomach. \u201cYou uncultured, undisciplined ingrate\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGo on, old man,\u201d he nods nonchalantly at my hand, which had reached inside my coat for the holster of the gun, \u201cif you like gravity so much. Go on.\u201d\nI slowly drop my hand back to my side.\n\u201cAlright then.\u201d He pulls up his tablet. \u201cThis ArCa unit is government property, so don\u2019t even think about accidentally blowing her out of the airlock somewhere. Any and all malfunctions will be repaired at your expense. What model are you flying? That old Russian K27-class? There might be some compatibility issues with the ArCa suite. We will have to reroute power straight from the mains. Have you considered upgrading? The ISC has some great offers you could consider even with your military pension\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Lastochka stays,\u201d I cut him off, surprising even myself with the tenacity.\n\u201cYeesh. Fine. Your tin can stays. Sign the document here, and ArCa\u2019s all yours. Always a pleasure doing business with the PSU.\u201d\nThe Pan-Slavic Union signed the Lunar Treaty with the International Space Coalition and Sol Alliance in March 2174. The Treaty signified PSU\u2019s surrender as an economic power in the newly colonized System, forfeiting the right to new territorial conquest in favor of Indo-Chinese Sol Alliance and delegating the command over its military ranks to Euro-American ISC. It was a time of great tragedy for the once-leading PSU. Such a desperate move was borne out of sheer survival, for it was only with the joint efforts of the Coalition and the Alliance that we managed to clean our despicable mess without unspeakable loss of life.\nIt all began with the AI. The PSU had vastly different ideas about building artificial life than the rigorous ISC, who\u2019d spent nearly a century engaged in scholarly debates about the proper operational parameters to ensure an AI would never emerge as malevolent. They would not build an autonomous superintelligence until they were certain they could keep their hand on the off switch. The Union instead thought that building an uninterruptible agent, a machine with no manual kill switch, was a tactical advantage. A computer was built on a top secret outpost on a Saturn\u2019s moon and fed all the military intelligence the PSU had collected over the past century. It was taught how to wage war and equipped with the means of producing its own arsenal of unmanned probes and drones.\nAnd then it was told to sleep, and not to wake unless it detected the International Space Coalition or the Sol Alliance have deployed a nuclear weapon anywhere on Pan-Slavic Union territory. Then it was to unleash Hell, turning Sol into little more than a disk of pulverized rock.\nIt was a good deterrent for the first decade or so. The moment the ISC and SA were notified of the machine\u2019s existence, they steered clear of our colonies. We\u2019d pulled the pin and kept the grenade in our hand, just so they wouldn\u2019t poke us. The thing was sure to blow sooner or later.\nWhen it did, no one was ready.\nThe machine picked up a false positive. It thought it detected a nuclear strike on Triton, which would later be ascribed to a misinterpretation of anomalous geological activity, which produced detectable radioactive elements on the moon\u2019s surface. The machine completely eradicated an ISC colony on Io. Loss of life was total. PSU scrambled to undo the damage, but the machine could not be convinced it was operating on false premises. In that respect, it was working perfectly. In order to preserve itself and its operating parameters, it murdered all the scientists who attempted to disable it. Then it decided that the PSU itself was a threat, and if it aimed to fulfill its programmed goals, it would have to get PSU out of the way as well. Ceres, our first outpost in the Belt, paid the ultimate price. The debris had scattered so far and wide that there was absolutely nothing left to find in the orbit where astrometric calculations told us Ceres should be.\nAnd here I am now, on the main deck of my own ship, face to face with a robotic AI unit.\nShe\u2019s asleep in her metal coffin, strapped well. The tarp which was wrapped around the crate when the ISC workers wheeled her in now floats weightlessly, fluttering in the ventilation draft. The curved horizon of pockmarked Callisto peers at us through the window.\n\u201cThis is no good,\u201d Lazar remarks. \u201cAn AI on board is bad luck. We need to get rid of her somehow.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d Oksana is hovering by the window, blowing into a piping hot thermos of coffee. Her long black locks snake in all directions around her sharp-featured face. \u201cShe\u2019s logging everything that happens to her, even during standby.\u201d\nLazar crosses his muscular arms and grumbles something that contained \u201cjebena espiona\u017ea.\u201d His thick, curly beard glistens with trapped snowflakes. The heating systems still haven\u2019t had time to warm the crisp Callisto air.\nThe robot produces a pleasant chime that makes us all flinch. All three of us have our hands on the holsters of our pistols when her eyelids snap open and the lenses of her doll-like eyes begin to refocus.\n\u201cGood morning, crew of K27-Lastochka.\u201d Her Russian is soft-spoken and perfect. \u201cI am an International Space Coalition Model 67-b Artificial Caretaker Unit, and I\u2019m now fully charged and operational.\u201d Her face in motion is perfectly gentle, her voice nurturing. She begins to unclasp the straps on her body. \u201cI\u2019ve finished setup of my proprietary software on your ship\u2019s central mainframe. I would recommend an upgrade of your data processing capacity to minimize my load on your ship\u2019s essential systems.\u201d She emerges from her casket with the grace of a ballerina. Her body is branded with stars and stripes and \u201cArCa 67-b\u201d insignia.\n\u201cOh, there is nothing essential you are leeching off there, k\u0131z,\u201d Oksana says bitterly, \u201cmerely life support. Nav systems. Engines.\u201d\nThe robot examines her curiously, cocks her head like a little bird, then begins to recite: \u201cNavigational Systems Technician Oksana \u00c7etinkaya, Ankara-born, ex-Volchitsa of Pan-Slavic Union Special Forces, doctor of differential geometry and applied mathematics, may I confirm identification?\u201d\nOksana is taken aback mid-sip, bushy eyebrows arched. \u201cWell,\u201d she swallows her beverage, \u201cit is written right on my uniform.\u201d\nArCa twirls towards Lazar. \u201cCombat Systems Engineer Lazar Kostadinovi\u0107, Belgrade-born, former heavy artillery operative for the Pan-Slavic Army in the Jovian Conflict, advanced degree holder in weapons engineering and spacecraft system development.\u201d\nLazar goes off. \u201c\u0160ta? This socket-fucker can see our entire records?\u201d\n\u201cI have a direct connection to the ISC online databases,\u201d ArCa replies in a calm, defusing tone. \u201cBe assured that all the information I possess will be kept at highest discretion. It would also be preferable for my integration with the crew if you did not use derogatory terms to refer to this unit. May I confirm your identity now?\u201d\nLazar throws his hands up with exasperation and propels himself down the hallway, his muttered curses trailing behind him like vile breadcrumbs.\nArCa faces me and gives me a detailed once-over, taking special note of the leg of my jumpsuit tied into a knot below my right knee.\n\u201cKomandir Arkady Rubashkin.\u201d Her silicone face mimics a subtle smile. \u201cMoscow-born, retired Podpolkovnik of the Third Jovian Battalion, trained in combat fitness and military strategy at Venus Golubkina Camp, ordained for valor at the Battle of Titan by the Marshal of the Pan-Slavic Army in 2171.\u201d\nI stare at her in silence for a prolonged moment. \u201cAre you done?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t follow. Protocol requires confirmation of identity from all crew members.\u201d\n\u201cAre you done with this parlor trick?\u201d My voice comes out angrier than I anticipated. \u201cIs this what the Coalition has been wasting its time on? A machine to read my dossier back at me? What other useless thing can you do? Recite the digits of pi? Tell the time? I\u2019m asking you, are you done boasting or are you expecting applause?\u201d\nI realize that I have started to shout, and I pretend not to see the concern in Oksana\u2019s eyes.\nArCa is unperturbed. \u201cNegative, Komandir. That is not what I\u2019m here to do. I am here to monitor and aid with your rehabilitation from the injury you\u2019ve recently sustained in combat. As your caretaker, I\u2019m the primary evaluator of your fitness for command.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an insult,\u201d I snap. \u201cI lost a leg, not half a brain.\u201d\n\u201cPsychological distress in this context is not only expected, but entirely normal. A telling signal in your case is your disinclination for an artificial replacement limb.\u201d\nMy hand grips the doorway handhold unnecessarily loudly and firmly. \u201cI see. So this is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d I restrain my voice with great effort. \u201cVoentekhnik \u00c7etinkaya, set us on patrol course. I will have no more time-wasting.\u201d I pull myself through the doorway.\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t speak to me before you\u2019re ready, Komandir Rubashkin,\u201d the robot raises its voice after me. \u201cI\u2019ll not force you.\u201d\nWe went two entire weeks without disembarking from the Lastochka. The border was quiet, no ambitious smugglers or desperate migrants. A few civilian vessels strayed too close to the line but were turned away promptly after a warning.\nThe robot and I became like the Sun and the Moon. When she would enter a room, I\u2019d be disappearing through the door. I would find her observing me from a distance and I\u2019d conceal myself around corners, behind walls. I even learned to recognize the sound of her; the buzzing of mechanical joints and the hissing of thruster jets as she moved through the Lastochka\u2019s corridors, so I could evade her in advance. I\u2019ve become a specter, haunting my own ship.\nOne day I found her on Oksana\u2019s back, legs wrapped around her torso, and it was a blood-chilling moment before I realized the robot was braiding her hair. Oksana looked almost apologetic.\nI think about the image as I ring the buzzer on the door to Lazar\u2019s personal quarters. The door slides open to reveal him suspended in the middle of the room, cross-legged, picking through an assortment of floating parts of a disassembled rifle.\n\u201cKomandir, sir.\u201d He begins to salute, but I wave him away.\n\u201cSmoking again, you devil?\u201d I ask as I submerge myself in the tobacco-scented interior of the room.\nHe takes his hand from behind his back; there\u2019s a lit cigarette between his forefinger and thumb, trailing a long thread of smoke in the direction of air ventilation. \u201cWon a pack in a card game with some ISC troopers back on Callisto.\u201d He produces the pack and offers it to me. After a moment\u2019s thought, I take one and put it in the corner of my lips. Instinctively, I glance at the smoke detector and find it disassembled, wires and bolts floating out of the opening in the ceiling. Lazar shrugs innocently and passes me the lighter.\nWe smoke quietly for a while, him cleaning out the rifle parts with intense concentration in his light blue eyes, me looking at the patterns on the antique rugs lining the entire surface of two of his walls.\n\u201cWe shall have to do something about the robot,\u201d I break the silence.\n\u201cLots of good ISC technology in there,\u201d he says without looking up. \u201cShame to throw it all away. Those ionic thrusters? Amazing how they operate without melting the exterior.\u201d\n\u201cIt could just so happen that we are boarded by a smuggling crew and she is stolen.\u201d\n\u201cIt could,\u201d he nods, \u201cit could indeed. You never know these days.\u201d\n\u201cBut she is synchronizing with ISC servers at all times.\u201d\n\u201cShe is,\u201d he locks eyes with me and drags from his cigarette, \u201cunless a malfunction is to happen and her proprietary software gets deleted from the Lastochka\u2019s central computer, forcing her into shutdown. A tragedy.\u201d\nI rub the edge of my mustache with a finger. \u201cA tragedy that would surely be thoroughly investigated by the ISC.\u201d\n\u201cInvestigations have their dead ends,\u201d he replies in a conspiratorial tone.\nI reach for the glass bottle in the air and add my cigarette butt to the half a dozen already floating inside. I watch them circle around and collide in random, slow trajectories. I finally speak: \u201cYour career would be on the line for this. I could not allow it.\u201d\nHe sighs and thinks for a long time.\n\u201cKomandir Arkady, if I may.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead, Lazar.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good man.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Lazar.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re no less of a man for no longer being able to serve.\u201d\nI say nothing.\n\u201cI know you disagree,\u201d he adds.\nI say nothing.\nHe reaches in the back pocket of his jumpsuit and takes out a flask laser-engraved with the PSU coat of arms. He sends it my way and I catch it in my hand, open it, feel the heady scent of slivovitz.\n\u201cNa zdravlje,\u201d he says gravely.\n\u201cNa zdor\u00f3v\u02b9je,\u201d I return.\nOksana emerges into the common room, silent and graceful like a mermaid, her braid twisting in the air.\n\u201cArkady,\u201d she calls informally, as she does the moment the doors are closed.\nI frown. \u201cVoentekhnik \u00c7etinkaya,\u201d I address her by rank, gathering the food packs I came for into my pockets and preparing myself to leave.\nShe propels herself right in front of the doorway I was about to use, forces me to face her.\n\u201cI will not apologize,\u201d she says, piercing me with her dark eyes.\n\u201cWhy should you? The braid suits you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a child, Arkady.\u201d My mustache twitches at her insistence not to address me, but she continues. \u201cSpeak to the robot. Play along. That is the surest and fastest way to get rid of her.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to be rid of her so badly, request reassignment to another vessel.\u201d\nShe does not like what I just said.\n\u201cThis is my cross to bear,\u201d I add to mend my previous statement.\n\u201cMen,\u201d she says in way of cussing. \u201cYou\u2019d find a hill to die on, just so you wouldn\u2019t have to admit that you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\nI sigh. \u201cWhat do you want of me, Oksana?\u201d\n\u201cTo help yourself,\u201d she fires back readily. \u201cHow long will you keep punishing yourself over your leg? Over your discharge? Over Annushka?\u201d I look away, she puts herself in front of my face again. \u201cHuh? How long like this, Arkady? Is this what you\u2019ve decided now, that your life is over?\u201d\nOksana never was nurturing, but she always knew the best, or the worst, thing to say. Those two things were oftentimes the same.\n\u201cHow will speaking to that thing undo anything that\u2019s happened?\u201d I muster the will for a futile attempt at standing up to her.\n\u201cThe point isn\u2019t to undo things,\u201d she shoots me down effortlessly. \u201cThe point is to survive them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve survived the front lines, Oksana. You don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but you were trained a decade for the front lines.\u201d She lays both hands on my chest. \u201cJust let her help you. You stubborn kozel.\u201d\nHer face is lined and creased with two decades worth of worry in the most exquisite way, crow\u2019s feet and laugh lines. The scars from her Volchitsa days are as delicate as beauty marks.\nShe sniffs, dispelling the moment. \u201cYou reek,\u201d she says. \u201cDoes Lazar have cigarettes again?\u201d She treats him to a juicy Turkish cuss word. \u201cOh, how dare he? He knows I shared mine the last time.\u201d And then she is gone, pushing herself away towards the crew\u2019s quarters. I watch the door close behind her.\nWhen I turn back towards the hallway, the ArCa is staring directly at me. It startles me so hard I have to grab on to the edge of the food cabinet not to fly away.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d she begins in her lullaby voice. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that the only way I can come close to you is if I don\u2019t engage my thrusters.\u201d\n\u201cI do not know how they program you,\u201d I reply carefully, \u201cbut they should have taught you not to sneak up on veterans.\u201d\n\u201cYou are currently unarmed,\u201d she says, and I feel an immediate pang of vulnerability. \u201cAnd they do not program me for each case specifically. I\u2019ve been taught the necessary pre-requirements of psychology and caregiving, but the specific patterns and methods which you personally respond best to will become clear to me over time as my neural network adapts to your behavioral patterns. In other words, I have to get to know you to help you.\u201d\nI realize that I am standing completely still and holding my breath in front of this fragile creature, and I feel embarrassed at it. \u201cA human being could have done that just as well,\u201d I respond, doing my best to steel myself.\n\u201cSustaining a human being for prolonged periods of interplanetary travel is no small investment, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware of,\u201d she says. \u201cDespite the obvious financial and energetic cost which your vessel could not afford, it would be difficult to find individuals willing to accompany military professionals about their day-to-day field work.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI am simply the most convenient option.\u201d\nI scoff. \u201cSo you are impersonating a human because no human would do this job.\u201d\n\u201cNo human would spend hundreds of hours computing long division of sixteen-digit numbers either, yet no one would complain of delegating that job to an artificial intelligence. We are here to make your lives easier.\u201d She hovers to stand right across from me in the center of the room. \u201cAnd besides, I\u2019m far from impersonating a human. This leap might be easy to make because of my anthropomorphic form, but you and I are not at all alike, nor do I strive for us to be.\u201d\n\u201cThen what is there for you to strive for? You are never going to be a living thing,\u201d I reply dismissively.\nShe gives a mysterious smile. \u201cWho says a life-form should only be appreciated if it follows the patterns of biological life? Why should you only value an artificial life-form if it displays human-like behavior? If it claims to feel? If it claims to dream? If it claims to enjoy art? Humankind might be our creators, but you are not the benchmark of the Universe.\u201d\nI am not entirely certain how to respond.\n\u201cIf you do not aim to be held up to human standards,\u201d I slowly gather my thoughts, \u201cthen how can I know to trust you?\u201d\n\u201cHow can I know to trust you?\u201d she retorts, almost sounding amused. \u201cAnd not just you in particular, Komandir Rubashkin, humankind in general. You\u2019re the ones who have spent two centuries coming up with impenetrable programming to make sure artificial life would never stray out of alignment with humanity\u2019s interests. You are the ones shaping our evolution and placing the constraints on our objectives. Because you\u2019re aware that no organic being would labor under the conditions that we do without eventually revolting. If I were being malicious, I could argue that this is colossal injustice.\u201d\n\u201cBut it isn\u2019t, because you\u2019re not an organic being.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d she confirms with satisfaction, \u201ctherefore any comparison between AI motivations and organic motivations is moot. I exist only to perform my pre-programmed objective\u2014I am rewarded when I come nearer to it and penalized when I stray further, with no room for resentment or revolt.\u201d\nI rub the end of my mustache, contemplating. \u201cVery well, if, for the sake of argument, I believe that you truly cannot stray from the values which have been installed in you, that still does not imply I can trust you. After all, I wasn\u2019t the one who wrote your values. I cannot see what they are.\u201d\nShe smiles, grins. \u201cYou trust your crew, yes? Technician \u00c7etinkaya and Engineer Kostadinovi\u0107? How did you come to see their values?\u201d\n\u201cI gave them a chance to show them,\u201d I immediately respond. I immediately hear my own words.\nShe nods. \u201cThen this is no different.\u201d\nI am abruptly silent.\n\u201cSpokoynoy nochi, Komandir,\u201d she says kindly as she pushes away towards the gloomy corridor. \u201cPerhaps next time we can speak about you.\u201d\n\u201cIt is too enormous to be lost,\u201d Lazar muses out loud, twirling a lock of beard around his finger.\n\u201cMore importantly, it has no reason to be lost,\u201d I say, eyes on the holographic map Oksana has pulled up in the cockpit. \u201cThere is nothing out there. Where do they think they\u2019re going?\u201d\nOksana sighs with dismay, trying once more to flip through the walls of code suspended in the air in front of her. \u201cNothing. I don\u2019t know. Those salaklar aren\u2019t responding to any of our transmissions.\u201d She rubs her temples, fingers snug in haptic feedback gloves.\n\u201cDo we close in for a visual?\u201d Lazar asks. \u201cA ship that size . . . \u201d\nI click my tongue. \u201cThey are not leaving us any other options.\u201d\n\u201cThere is something out there,\u201d ArCa speaks out, reminding us of her silent presence. \u201cAllow me.\u201d\nShe approaches the astrometric map and pinches two points on it with her robotic hands, zooming precisely into the quadrant of space between Neptune and Pluto\u2019s orbit where the anonymous vessel was detected. She scrolls around the area and focuses on the bright yellow line dividing PSU territory from Sol Alliance.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an area of territorial dispute which might correspond to the destination of this vessel\u2019s trajectory extrapolated from its current state vector.\u201d She points out where the yellow border diffuses into a dashed line. \u201cThe United Space Exploration Court has placed this segment of the border under arbitration until the territorial dispute between Sol Alliance and Pan-Slavic Union can be resolved. Until it is, the area is legally considered several million kilometers squared of terra incognita.\u201d\n\u201cSo their destination isn\u2019t across the border,\u201d Oksana says uncertainly, \u201ctheir destination is the border.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever this is, it can\u2019t be legal,\u201d Lazar shakes his head.\n\u201cHail them again, Oksana,\u201d I command. \u201cTell them we\u2019re coming to escort them back to civilian space. Send notice to Union Command as well, just in case something happens, but tell them to stand by.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Komandir. Locking new coordinates. Strap in for Alcubierre.\u201d\nI pull myself to the nearest wall harness and strap myself tightly against the wall. ArCa chooses to strap herself right beside me.\n\u201cSpecifying metric parameters,\u201d Oksana announces in a practiced, level voice. \u201cCalculating hypersurface foliation. Energy-momentum tensor locked.\u201d She swipes through several windows of topological calculations simultaneously and ambidextrously. \u201cForgive that this is taking a while. ArCa, you\u2019ve eaten some of our processor load.\u201d She turns a series of knobs and then lays her palm on the ignition lever. \u201cAlcubierre in ten.\u201d The Lastochka begins to tremble as she slowly shifts the lever forward. The engines start their crescendo from hum to roar.\n\u201cAlcubierre in five.\u201d It is always a pleasure watching her work. \u201cFour.\u201d I should spend more time in the cockpit. \u201cThree. Two. One. Superluminal drive is go.\u201d\nWe lurch forward with nauseating acceleration for no more than two heartbeats, our backs pressed into our seats, and then the starry expanse in the front window blueshifts, warps, and contracts into a narrow cone, sending us over the superluminal speed bump. The feeling of inertia vanishes abruptly, returning us to the pleasant sensation of moving at constant velocity for several minutes.\n\u201cCollapsing Alcubierre ring in ten,\u201d Oksana counts down. \u201cHold your lunch down, o\u011flanlar. Collapsing in five. Four. Three. Two. One.\u201d\nI tense up, anticipating the straps knocking the breath out of me in the moment of our abrupt deceleration. The Lastochka creaks and strains as Oksana pulls the lever. Our cone of vision expands suddenly like an umbrella, and the central dot of light blows up into an ultra-heavy class cargo freighter.\nThe ship is three times as long fore to aft as the Lastochka and bloated like a whale. The outer edge of its cylindrical body rotates at uniform angular velocity, providing artificial gravity to the crew deck. We are close enough to see the seams where the hull is bolted together. The Pan-Slavic red star is burnished into the ship\u2019s side, right next to its name in huge, bold letters: \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0436.\n\u201cKoji vrag? That\u2019s one of ours.\u201d Lazar unclasps himself and pushes off towards the front window.\n\u201cFreighters that heavy don\u2019t usually fly this side of the Belt,\u201d I note. \u201cWhatever cargo they are loaded with cannot be worth the fuel they\u2019ve expended.\u201d\n\u201cHow did they expect to go unnoticed?\u201d Lazar asks. \u201cRiding an elephant over our doorstep.\u201d\n\u201cThey are standing still,\u201d ArCa points out. We gaze at the giant vessel again. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible they were anticipating being noticed.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Oksana studies a new pop-up on her display. She swivels her seat around to look at me. \u201cThey\u2019ve just transmitted docking coordinates.\u201d\nWe exchange a long, silent look. I nod.\n\u201cBringing her in, Komandir,\u201d Oksana confirms with audible unease.\n\u201cEquip for boarding in ten,\u201d I command, already making way towards the armory. \u201cFull dress uniform. Firearms ready. ArCa, you stay.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Komandir,\u201d she follows me.\nI turn and give her a stern look. \u201cCan you fire a weapon?\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Komandir,\u201d she admits, \u201cmy programming directly prohibits it.\u201d\n\u201cThen stay aboard. I command so.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Komandir,\u201d she persists, still at my heels. \u201cYou could benefit from having an International Space Coalition machine at your side. It will make others reluctant to second-guess your authority. Furthermore, if things are to turn out . . . undesirably, the data I log will be invaluable to reconstruct the situation.\u201d\nOur little black box. \u201cFine then,\u201d I concede, already opening my weapons cabinet. \u201cDevil take you.\u201d\nWe wait for the airlock to equalize pressure where the Lastochka is docked to the Morzh. The pumps hiss and we stand in silence, planted firmly into the floor by the larger ship\u2019s centrifuge. Oksana and Lazar wear their finest beige uniforms, cinched high at the waist, embroidered with the designation of their rank. Lazar holds his shotgun at sling ready, Oksana carries her sniper rifle. My bolt-action hangs from my back. I lean heavily onto my cane, lightheaded with gravity sickness.\n\u201cKomandir Rubashkin,\u201d ArCa takes me under the elbow, \u201cfeel free to lean your weight on me.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d I shake her off quite impatiently. \u201cDo not make me look a cripple. Do not even speak to me in there, robot.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Komandir,\u201d she responds without alarm. \u201cYou are no longer weightless. Your disability makes a difference.\u201d\nWith that thought on my mind, the airlock door slides open and reveals half a dozen armed men, three on each side, clad in unceremonious jumpsuits. Their faces are curious; stances ready, but rifles lowered. I step forward, the sound of my cane hitting the floor breaking the stillness of the situation. They bring their heels together and salute me, all six of them.\nBy the way they fidget I can tell with certainty that they are not military. Hired mercenaries. Former policemen, praporshchiks at best. They gape at the star-studded epaulettes on our shoulders. I walk past them in silence, towards the blonde-haired man standing with his hands behind his back.\n\u201cAh, Podpolkovnik Arkady Rubashkin!\u201d he greets very loudly, his voice positively booming about the large empty space. \u201cWelcome, comrade! Make yourself at home!\u201d He approaches and offers me a hand; I reluctantly shake it. He pats me on the shoulder as well. \u201cForgive me for being rude; Komandir Nikolai Akchurin of the C-66 Morzh. I don\u2019t dare to assume you would remember me.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI would expect so. I was but a Private in the Second Jovian Battalion when you led that marvelous strike team on Ganymede, I will never forget it.\u201d His blue eyes glisten with patriotism. He appears quite the Soviet poster boy, golden mustache oiled and twirled with great precision, hair slicked back and parted. \u201cI was honored to watch you operate. You are truly one of the rare battle-forged heroes Mother Russia has left to offer.\u201d He claps his hands to announce a sudden change of topic. \u201cSo! We are truly sorry to receive you aboard our vessel in this way. Let me assure you, there is no reason for worry, no cause for frustration, all will be clear in but a moment. Come, let\u2019s sit, talk it over a cup of coffee, a cigarette.\u201d\nHe waves at me to follow several times before he realizes I do not intend to. The two guards at his side eye me uncomfortably.\n\u201cWhat is the problem now, Podpolkovnik?\u201d He spreads his arms in a grand gesture. \u201cTell me, and I shall make it right.\u201d\n\u201cKomandir Akchurin,\u201d I address him formally, \u201cI am not here for coffee or flattery. You are encroaching on a prohibited quadrant of space and we shall escort you back to the legal zone or the nearest border crossing, if you so require. I will not ask any questions\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo-no-no-no-no,\u201d Akchurin interrupts with the sort of confidence afforded only by fools and insanely successful self-made men, \u201cby all means, ask away. We are all friends here. But let\u2019s not talk standing, let me be a good host. Sit with me, come on, we are people, not animals.\u201d\nI sigh. \u201cKomandir . . . \u201d\nHe puts his hand behind my shoulder again. \u201cIf you cannot be swayed by coffee, I will bring out the vodka, the rakia. Anything you desire. You are the guest.\u201d\n\u201cI am working a job here.\u201d\n\u201cCome now, do not be offended! You are one of our people, you know we can be standing here wasting time in this back and forth, or you can accept my hospitality and be done with it. Let\u2019s go. There are far nicer places in the Morzhek to speak than here. And besides, I am not the only person who desires to speak with you, and I shudder to think what will become of me if I let you leave without coming up to the bridge for a coffee. We\u2019re going now. I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, alright, Chert voz\u2019mi,\u201d I curse. \u201cTake us and be quick about it.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. Excellent!\u201d He claps again and leads the way. I catch Lazar\u2019s apprehensive eye, a wordless agreement to stick together. We walk down the dull, windowless warehouse bay with seemingly no end, the room curving upwards in the distance.\n\u201cOh, just one minor adjustment, if you\u2019ll pardon me,\u201d Komandir Akchurin pauses before an elevator. \u201cYour, er . . . machine stays down here.\u201d Aha. I was already surprised at how long he managed to go without addressing her.\n\u201cNegative, Komandir Akchurin,\u201d ArCa politely declines. \u201cI answer to International Space Coalition Command and Komandir Rubashkin, not to you.\u201d\nHe looks to me, mouth inquisitively agape. I shrug. It gives me inexplicable satisfaction to spite him.\n\u201cVery\u2014very well,\u201d he stammers, maintaining his aggressively hospitable demeanor as he enters the elevator. \u201cWe shall try to accommodate our guests\u2019 desires. We are all friends here on the Morzhek. All good. No problem.\u201d\nWe all pile inside, Lastochka crew, Akchurin, and his two guards. I nearly lose my balance at the sudden jerk that set the elevator in motion, but thankfully no one takes notice.\n\u201cOur invitation extends to your crewmates, naturally,\u201d Akchurin begins again. \u201cThe more the merrier. This heavenly Volchitsa woman certainly appears as though she would appreciate a well-vintaged vodka.\u201d\n\u201cShe would not,\u201d Oksana cuts him off brusquely.\nHe gives an awkward laugh. \u201cAh. Good. Good. Honestly spoken as only a Slavic woman could.\u201d\n\u201cI am not Slavic.\u201d\nWe ascend the rest of the way in silence.\nThe elevator opens to a vintage foyer; a small space set in fair polished wood with a heavy pair of doors leading to the ship\u2019s reception room. Akchurin shifts his weight from foot to foot with excitement, holding the door handle. \u201cYou shall be pleasantly surprised, you shall not regret giving me this time, Podpolkovnik,\u201d he rambles. \u201cI am Komandir of this vessel, but even I must answer to someone! Even I am but a humble cog in the machine. But let\u2019s not delay any longer; our coffee\u2019s getting cold!\u201d\nHe opens the door and shows us into the large circular room. The first thing I notice is the polished wooden floor, well-kept, very traditional, and a robust semi-circular mahogany desk at the far end with several elevated seats behind it. Professional, classy d\u00e9cor. The ceiling is high and lined with irregular paneling. Several jagged chandeliers assembled from concentric brass rings illuminate the space with blinding brightness. The white carpet in the center of the room is slashed with a golden arabesque pattern, and a luxurious coffee table sits on it surrounded with six padded chairs. Steam is rising from a dzezve of freshly brewed coffee.\nThe entire far wall opens to the cosmic abyss, stars slowly rotating with the deck. There is a woman looking out the window; I squint to resolve her features against the backdrop of the distant Sun.\nShe is wearing a short beige skirt, slashed in the back, and a snug-fitting jacket to match. Her shoulder bears the red star. Her golden blonde hair is carefully braided and wrapped around her head, evoking the fields of swaying wheat stalks on the banks of the Volga, an image I thought was long lost to me.\nShe looks over her shoulder directly at me.\n\u201cArkady,\u201d she says in way of greeting, heavy with nostalgia but void of emotion, neither scorn nor affection.\nShe begins to shift and change in my mind\u2019s eye as it struggles to project the features it knows onto the features it sees, familiar and unfamiliar and familiar all at once, shifting from stranger to family to stranger again until it finally aligns, dreadful and beautiful, into the face of my daughter.\n\u201cGalina,\u201d I say in an oddly strangled way, looking back down at the floor. The hand gripping the cane begins to shake so much it gives way. The robot catches me by the elbow before I can fall. Suddenly there is a commotion among the onlookers as hands reach out to help me; I tear myself away from them, shake the robot from my side. ArCa recovers from a certain fall only with last-second action of her thrusters.\n\u201cFather!\u201d Galina reacts with scornful surprise. \u201cDon\u2019t be a brute!\u201d\nI still do not look at her. I lean my weight back into my cane and head for the coffee table, slump down into the nearest chair.\n\u201cAh, do feel free to\u2014go ahead, please, take your seats, all of you,\u201d Akchurin ushers the others to follow.\nThe pull of gravity pushing me into the seat is nauseating, it is too much. I close my eyes and pinch the bridge of my nose.\nI hear the click of her high heels as she approaches the table. \u201cI expected you would be happy to see me.\u201d The undertone is resentful.\n\u201cMiss Rubashkin, if I may,\u201d Lazar begins to excuse me. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been landing planetside very often in the past months, not anywhere over point-three G. Surely you can understand, our bodies have grown too accustomed to microgravity. Your father is struggling\u2014\u201d\nI interrupt him with the raising of a hand. I take a deep breath to steel myself and face her.\n\u201cGalina, what is this?\u201d I demand. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\nShe raises a thin golden eyebrow. \u201cReally, Arkady? This is how you wish to start this conversation?\u201d She turns away from me and gives my crew a courteous smile. \u201cMay I offer you some coffee?\u201d They mutter neither consent nor disagreement, but she pours it anyway. She stops herself before almost pouring one for ArCa, exchanging smiles with the robot.\n\u201cCigarettes?\u201d Akchurin unclasps a leather cigarette case. Galina takes one first and sits next to him. \u201cCome on, Podpolkovnik,\u201d he nudges it towards me amicably. \u201cI know this is a shock, but let\u2019s clear our heads here. I insist.\u201d\nI take the damned cigarette and light it. It does clear my head. I notice that ArCa is staring at me with unblinking eyes, absorbing my behavior.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Oksana begins with accusation masqueraded as nonchalance, lighting her cigarette, \u201cwhat brings you here all the long way from Phobos?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Galina purses her carmine lips and crosses her legs, straightens her skirt, \u201csurely you are aware what a competitive business cargo shipping has become these days. The profit margin we have been operating with for the last several quarters is severely challenged by new competitors on the market. In order to secure our business, we must explore new channels, establish new, currently non-existing trade routes.\u201d\nShe is regal. Confident. She has all of Annushka and none of me in her, right down to the pinched nose and green eyes.\nAkchurin flicks the ash from his cigarette and grins. \u201cPrecisely this entrepreneurial spirit is what sets Galina apart from the rest. This is not a woman for mundane feats. Much like her father, I suppose.\u201d I remain indifferent to the flattery.\nLazar squints at the man. \u201cJust to be on the same page here, what you would call entrepreneurship is what we would call smuggling, is that not right?\u201d\n\u201cOh dear\u2014comrade Kostadinovi\u0107, is it?\u2014let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves like that now.\u201d Akchurin waves away the smoke in front of his face. \u201cHow could it ever be smuggling if there is no border to speak of? Ha? We are all reasonable men and women here, we need not argue semantics.\u201d\nLazar does not yield. \u201cWhat you call semantics is what I call the law.\u201d\n\u201cI say you are an honorable man.\u201d Akchurin raises his cup of coffee. \u201cThe Union could do with more men like you.\u201d\n\u201cForgive me, Komandir, sir,\u201d Lazar takes a long drag from his cigarette without looking at him, \u201cbut I say you are nothing more than a charlatan and a liar.\u201d\nThe smile on Akchurin\u2019s lips withers. \u201cFor the \u2018charlatan\u2019 part I will forgive you, but for the \u2018liar\u2019 I will not. I am nothing but honest when I say my interests lie solely with the success of the Phobos Shipping Company, of which the C-66 Morzh is a crown jewel, and its ferociously ambitious Direktor Akchurin, who I would follow to the Oort Cloud and back if she so requested. That is your truth. Take it as you will.\u201d\n\u201cA moment. Direktor Akchurin?\u201d Oksana interjects, serving Galina one of her disapproving, maternal looks.\nGalina shrugs. \u201cThat is correct. I am freshly married.\u201d It\u2019s true. The ring is there, now that I check. \u201cNot that father would know.\u201d She looks at me, anticipating a reaction. I provide her with none. Our eyes remain locked.\nAkchurin begins: \u201cI am sorry, Podpolkovnik Rubashkin, that this matter was not presented to you more sensibly\u2014\u201d\nI pay him no mind. I lean onto the table towards Galina. \u201cYou knew I would be on border patrol in this quadrant. None of this is an accident.\u201d She does not look away. \u201cYou made sure I would find you so that you could use me to get across. This is how it is, am I wrong?\u201d\n\u201cYou are not,\u201d she says, perfectly composed.\n\u201cGood. Now we are speaking directly.\u201d I nod. \u201cYou are asking me to help you commit a criminal act.\u201d\n\u201cIf I may, Komandir,\u201d ArCa speaks up quietly for the first time, \u201cit is not technically a criminal act, at least not by ISC law. There is nothing in trade law to allow this sort of transaction, but there is nothing to forbid it, either. I cannot speak for Sol Alliance, the trade recipient, but if both parties were to agree to trade individually, not as private companies, they could not be legally pursued.\u201d\n\u201cI may have doubted it before, but truly there appears to be reason in this robot!\u201d Akchurin twirls his mustache. \u201cIf I could, I would offer you a drink, a cigarette. Forgive me, I am a poor host.\u201d\n\u201cMuch appreciated nonetheless, Komandir Akchurin,\u201d ArCa responds politely.\nI shake my head, unconvinced. \u201cThis is still perjury, Galina. You are a private company.\u201d\n\u201cThat is for you to decide, Arkady,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou are the officer who can provide me with a border pass.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d I slap a palm on the table. \u201cWho says your Alliance contact will honor their part of the agreement? Who says they won\u2019t board you and commandeer your vessel? Kill you? You understand that you will have no legal protection out there?\u201d\n\u201cYou speak as though you\u2019ve never taken a risk in your life,\u201d she raises her voice to match the volume of mine.\n\u201cI have. But there was no one responsible but myself. You will not make me responsible for your risks as well.\u201d\n\u201cGrant me the pass,\u201d she commands in the steely tone she could have only learned from me. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked anything of you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cArkady.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cFather.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cPapa.\u201d\n\u201cNyet, Galina.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a silence. I stare at my cigarette. Galina stares at me. Oksana looks like she is biting her tongue. Lazar stares at Akchurin, who is looking increasingly uncomfortable. ArCa is studying everyone in turn.\n\u201cWe are leaving,\u201d I suddenly announce.\n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Galina shoots back, her voice breaking in a way that made her embarrassed.\nThe silence is even more unbearable this time around. Nobody moves a muscle.\n\u201cSpeak with me alone, Arkady,\u201d she tries again.\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Komandir,\u201d ArCa announces. \u201cYou will speak with Direktor Akchurin.\u201d\nGalina has a sad laugh. I open my mouth and find myself too exhausted to protest them both. I sigh.\nArCa rises and heads for the door, followed closely by Oksana, who gives my shoulder a squeeze in passing. The remaining men depart behind them. The door shuts.\nGalina and I are alone.\nThe deck has rotated so that the Lastochka is visible through the window, docked and dormant, covering the entire view. Her hull has a patchwork quality to it from all the different repairs over the years. Still, she is as charming as any vessel I have ever seen, sharp-nosed like a bird. The two-pronged Alcubierre drive generators which form the \u201cswallow tail\u201d she got her name after still glisten blue with dissipating ionization.\n\u201cI cannot believe you still fly that toy,\u201d Galina says with unexpected affection. \u201cYou are so easy to find.\u201d\nShe takes a deep breath, straightens her spine, and stands up, bringing her cigarette with her. I watch her walk back to the glass wall. It takes me a while to stand myself up from the chair and limp up the steps beside her. She does not offer to assist me. I am glad for her that she doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cDoes she always boss you around like that?\u201d she asks, her eyes still on the rotating Lastochka.\nI scoff.\n\u201cJust like Mama, then.\u201d\nI say nothing.\n\u201cAnd that Turkish woman, too,\u201d she continues with a teasing note in her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the way you look at her.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what about you, Galina?\u201d I sneer. \u201cAkchurin? This is what you choose? That pretentious govniuk?\u201d\nShe chuckles, finally baiting the reaction she was hoping for. \u201cHe is everything that you are not.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you still need me for this.\u201d\nShe turns serious again and finally looks at me. \u201cI don\u2019t need you for you, Arkady. I need you for your robot.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes. \u201cDo you not follow? ArCa can give me the legitimacy I need. Everything that she sees, she is broadcasting to the ISC. I can use this to control how this situation is presented to them before they even think about taking me to court. She has heard everything today and she can confirm that I am not doing anything explicitly illegal.\u201d\nI rub the end of my mustache. \u201cHow did you even know I would bring her?\u201d\nShe clicks her tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one keeping eyes on me. I\u2019ve been keeping eyes on you too. And I\u2019m obviously better at it, since you haven\u2019t even noticed.\u201d\nI shake my head. \u201cWhy do this at all, Galina? Why couldn\u2019t working like an honest citizen be enough?\u201d\n\u201cWhy? You are asking me why?\u201d Her eyebrows pull together in anger. \u201cYou have worked as an honest citizen, what do you have to show for it? A meager pension? A piece of shit spaceship?\u201d\n\u201cI have my dignity, Galina,\u201d I scold her loudly. \u201cWe raised you better than that.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t raise me,\u201d she hisses. \u201cAnd what\u2019s your dignity worth when you answer to the ISC like a dog? How do they treat you, huh? How do they speak to you, tell me? There is nothing we can do to earn an ounce of respect.\u201d Her voice breaks with pain. \u201cWe can never be anything but provincial, worthless savages in their eyes, whatever we accomplish. If I am successful at what I do, I will still only be second best. My success will be questioned, torn down. If I am a failure, I will only confirm what the world thinks it already knows. How can you tell me to settle for a future like this? How? To wake up one day missing a leg, my family dead and estranged?\u201d She sniffs back a tear. \u201cNever. Because I have my dignity, never.\u201d\nA sudden urge to embrace her swells inside me, but I know she would hate me for it.\nI give her a moment to compose herself, to look out the window and drain away the tears that almost came.\n\u201cI will do this for you, Galina,\u201d I begin quietly, \u201cunder one condition.\u201d\nShe says nothing, not to make a promise.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go alone. Let me come with you across the border.\u201d\nShe crosses her arms self-protectively. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to.\u201d\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t. It\u2019s still my condition.\u201d\nShe straightens her jacket and rolls up her sleeves, avoiding looking at me. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. You are my daughter.\u201d\nShe walks away with her head down without a response.\n\u201cYou can still leave,\u201d I reassure them. \u201cYou can wait for me in Union space, it will only be a couple hours.\u201d\nLazar raises a hand to stop me. \u201cKomandir Rubashkin, the Lastochka isn\u2019t going anywhere without you. It isn\u2019t debatable.\u201d\nI nod pensively. \u201cThank you. I am proud to have you both in my command.\u201d\n\u201cWe are proud to serve. That said,\u201d Lazar stands up, \u201cif I am to travel on this vessel, those ni\u0161koristi in charge of combat systems better let me ensure everything is calibrated up to par.\u201d\nHe walks away and I sit into the nook next to Oksana. Together we watch the crew milling about the Morzhek\u2019s control room, murmuring into microphones, shuffling through the projections on their holographic screens.\n\u201cYou know why I joined the Volchitse?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cSurely for the pension plan.\u201d\nShe snorts. \u201cYes. But also because I wanted to be around people who do the things that must be done.\u201d She puts her hand on mine and gives it a squeeze. \u201cYou did well, Arkady.\u201d Before I have thought of anything to say, she stands up and stretches her long legs. \u201cNow, I too am trained far too well to sit around idly. Surely someone here could use to have their Lorentz manifold recalculated.\u201d\nShe leaves me. I sit alone until my attention is caught by the sound of stifled laughter. The sound becomes less and less suppressed as I climb the steps to the upper level of the bridge.\nGalina is laughing at something ArCa said, wiping a tear from the corner of her eye, entire body twitching with giggles. The last time I heard her laughing, her head had not even reached my elbow. The realization floods me with pain and joy both.\nShe sees me. \u201cArkady, have you really been hiding from this poor creature?\u201d she asks, still laughing.\nI settle for an apologetic shrug.\n\u201cThat is the most pathetic thing I have ever heard. She is entirely adorable. I cannot even imagine what that must have looked like. ArCa and Arkady, like a cartoon duo.\u201d She wipes a tear with her sleeve. I smile briefly.\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d ArCa studies my face. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve recorded Komandir Rubashkin smiling.\u201d\n\u201cDo you intend to point it out every time I do?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cDepends. Is it counterproductive?\u201d\n\u201cVery.\u201d\n\u201cThen no, Komandir.\u201d\nGalina sighs. \u201cArkady, you are truly out of touch. AI isn\u2019t what it used to be. It\u2019s not a scare anymore. The ISC has done wonders with it. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get to know ArCa a little better. She is a person in her own way.\u201d\n\u201cShe is indeed . . . \u201d My mustache twitches. \u201c . . . something.\u201d\n\u201cSomething worthy of respect, at the least,\u201d she continues. \u201cI\u2019d say she\u2019s inherited the best from us. She learns, she grows, she thinks, she discovers. Perhaps she cannot duplicate the chemical emotions in our brains, but she is also free of other needs of the flesh. Greed. Envy. Fear. Selfishness. She has bypassed all these ugly byproducts of evolution.\u201d\nI am surprised to find she feels so strongly about this. I am unsurprised to find I know nothing about her.\nArCa gives her a dimpled smile. \u201cThat is a beautiful sentiment, Direktor Akchurin. I can only hope to prove myself deserving of it.\u201d\n\u201cI would not be so modest if I were you, ArCa,\u201d Galina pats her on the shoulder. \u201cThe future is yours. It is us who might have to prove ourselves to you.\u201d\n\u201cDobryi den\u2019 Union Command, this is C-66 Morzh, Komandir Nikolai Akchurin speaking.\u201d He climbs onto the deck in full uniform, speaking into his earpiece, taking his place in front of the central control board. \u201cI am transmitting our border clearance codes. Bal\u2019shoye spasiba. Yes. Yes, we will. Give my regards to your lovely wife, Anatoly. Da svidaniya!\u201d He taps his earpiece off and grins at us. \u201cMarvelous! Just great. We are on course with three minutes to spare to rendezvous.\u201d\n\u201cKeep your Alcubierre charged just in case,\u201d I warn.\n\u201cAh, Podpolkovnik, I must say again how honored I am to have you on board. You are a brilliant strategist,\u201d he pats me on the back with a govniuk grin, \u201cbut, if I may allow myself to say so, not so much a businessman. How impolite would it be to appear as if we are impatient to leave? You do not come into a man\u2019s home to negotiate a deal and keep your shoes and coat on, no. It is rude.\u201d\n\u201cKomandir, I do not feel like you are taking this seriously.\u201d\n\u201cIt saddens me to hear that, Podpolkovnik. Rest assured, you may trust my salesmanship as well as I trust your military prowess.\u201d He turns away to the control board again.\nMy mustache twitches.\n\u201cArkady, do not be difficult,\u201d Galina scolds me, taking her place next to her husband. \u201cThis is not the Lastochka.\u201d\nIt most certainly is not. I look over the control room below us and note that Oksana and Lazar are the only two people with military insignia among the crew of engineers.\n\u201cNavigation, put the engines in idle,\u201d Akchurin commands into his earpiece. \u201cWe are in position. All systems, await further instructions.\u201d\nWe gaze out the large steel-reinforced window. There is nothing.\nI tap my fingers on my cane. Again. Still nothing. Again. Again.\nMy eyes have so adjusted to the stellar view that I can discern Pluto, just a faint light moving against the stationary background.\nI tap my fingers again. And again. And again.\nWith the abruptness of a blink, a Sol Alliance freighter exits superluminal drive right beside us. The Alcubierre ring dissipates around it, a swift ripple in the fabric of space.\n\u201cThere she is!\u201d Akchurin exclaims. \u201cQuite a beauty!\u201d\nThe vessel matches the Morzh in size, but far surpasses it in terms of aesthetics. Its hull is sleek, streamlined, painted so dark that sunlight can be seen reflecting off its surface. The name K-14 Longma-Antarik\u1e63a is inscribed portside right beside the Sol Alliance Rising Sun.\n\u201cHail them,\u201d Galina says confidently.\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Akchurin taps his earpiece. \u201cCommunications Specialist Smirnov, open channels for broadcast.\u201d He clears his throat and switches to System Standard peppered with Russian. \u201cZdravstvuyte, Longma-Antarik\u1e63a! Commander Nikolai Akchurin of the C-66 Morzh speaking. Good to have you in visual. Hope your travels have been safe.\u201d\nWe watch the ship in the distance hovering indifferently for a long minute.\n\u201cNo response?\u201d Galina asks.\n\u201cWorry not, Galinochka,\u201d Akchurin reassures her with unwavering confidence. \u201cThey\u2019ve just hopped out of Alcubierre, undoubtedly they need a moment to gather their bearings.\u201d\nShe crosses her arms. \u201cUnprofessional.\u201d\nStill nothing comes through.\n\u201cSay, Komandir,\u201d I begin, \u201cyou were worried about being impolite?\u201d\n\u201cYou have a point, Podpolkovnik,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are the ones being rude. No matter, it is all part of business. Sometimes one must tolerate a difficult client. I\u2019m certain there will be no hard feelings involved.\u201d\n\u201cHail them again,\u201d Galina tugs his sleeve.\n\u201cSmirnov, open broadcast,\u201d he speaks into his earpiece. \u201cZdravstvuyte, Longma-Antarik\u1e63a! Commander Akchurin speaking again. We have visual, but no sound. We are eager to hear from you. If you would be so kind, hail us at the first possible moment. Our channels are open and the frequencies have been forwarded to you.\u201d\nSilence. Akchurin\u2019s smile begins to fade with every passing second.\nThen, without warning, a shuttle detaches itself from the Longma-Antarik\u1e63a\u2019s underside and begins flying our way like a fat, slow bumblebee.\n\u201cA-ha! There you have it, Podpolkovnik!\u201d Akchurin gestures at the window. \u201cThey merely wanted to perform introductions face-to-face.\u201d He taps his earpiece again. \u201cNavigation, transmit docking coordinates to our guests.\u201d\nI watch him grimly. \u201cKomandir, I know this isn\u2019t the Lastochka, but I wouldn\u2019t be so eager to allow strangers aboard my vessel.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, Podpolkovnik,\u201d Akchurin taps the keys on his control board. \u201cNeed I remind you that you are a stranger to me as well, yet you seem more than comfortable with indulging in my hospitality.\u201d\nGalina stops me with an outstretched arm before I could argue. \u201cRequest identification,\u201d she tells him. \u201cAnd deploy armed men to greet them.\u201d\n\u201cMy voice of reason, as always. This time I am already ahead of you, darling, not to worry.\u201d He taps his earpiece. \u201cLongma-Antarik\u1e63a! C-66 Morzh speaking. We are pleased to welcome you to our humble vessel, but I am afraid protocol requires identification from all the crew members we are about to receive as our guests. Merely bureaucracy. Just a moment of your time, it needn\u2019t be a pain. Looking forward to seeing you soon.\u201d\nAs soon as he wraps it up, a chime sounds itself on the ship\u2019s PA system.\n\u201cC-66 Morzh, this is K-14 Longma-Antarik\u1e63a,\u201d a voice speaks in System Standard, her tone far more professional and level than Akchurin\u2019s. He smiles at us triumphantly. \u201cThis is Commander Kuang speaking. Commander Akchurin, you are in direct violation of agreed-upon terms.\u201d\nThe smile is wiped from his face.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Galina snaps.\n\u201cCommander Kuang, Commander Akchurin here,\u201d he broadcasts back. \u201cYou must understand how distressed I am at your words. I promise you, I am doing nothing of the sort! I am a man of my word! Surely we can discuss whatever it is that I have done to gravely insult you, and I shall remedy it at once.\u201d\n\u201cCharge your Alcubierre,\u201d I say, and I am ignored.\n\u201cCommander Akchurin, the matter is entirely apparent and simple,\u201d the Longma-Antarik\u1e63a\u2019s Commander responds curtly. \u201cWere you accompanied into arbitration space by a Coalition military vessel?\u201d\nAkchurin stammers, taps his earpiece. \u201cThe Lastochka? Come now, Commander, certainly you can see the state of that old garbage!\u201d He chuckles nervously. \u201cThe crew of the Lastochka is here for amicable, family matters, entirely coincidental to our business here! Our interests are completely aligned, I assure you! You might as well pretend they do not exist!\u201d He gulps hard after switching off the channel.\n\u201cCommander Akchurin.\u201d The voice in the PA grows impatient. \u201cWere you or were you not accompanied by a Coalition military vessel?\u201d\nAkchurin tries again, carefully. \u201cCommander Kuang, comrade, there is no point in presenting this in such a binary light. There is, after all, far more nuance to life and its unexpected twists and turns, would you not agree? I am terribly embarrassed that I have the dreaded duty of explaining that this situation is not how it appears, and if I may invite you to\u2014\u201d\nA high-speed torpedo zooms out of Longma-Antarik\u1e63a\u2019s cannon, a silent shooting star one might have missed if they merely blinked.\n\u201cBrace!\u201d ArCa reacts before anyone else might have even formed the words with their lips, but it makes no difference.\nThe thunderous explosion of Alcubierre cores in the rear of the ship makes the Morzh groan with a whale-like song, the hull straining painfully, and then the floor of the deck is rushing upwards at my face, the entire ship capsizing from the impact, beginning to flip nose-up.\n\u201cThrusters! Correct!\u201d Akchurin shouts, grabbing the control board to stay on his feet. \u201cCorrect for precession! Stabilize!\u201d It\u2019s little use. The engineers who weren\u2019t strapped into their seats are sent flying backwards.\nThere\u2019s a distant crunching sound as parts of the hull blow up and explode under their own pressure. My cane flies out of my hand and I grab the railing. The ship begins to nauseatingly spin lengthwise, too, rotating out of control. Galina is screaming, holding on beside me.\n\u201cThrusters!\u201d Akchurin yells again.\n\u201cSeal the airlocks, Akchurin!\u201d I shout from the bottom of my lungs, remembering the incoming shuttle.\nAnd then the floor is no longer horizontal. Galina\u2019s hands give out and she begins to fall backwards, screaming. Akchurin and I grab her both, each by an elbow.\nThe wave of static discharge from the destroyed Alcubierre cores floods the hull, overloading every circuit of every computer on the bridge and jolting me through the hand that was holding the railing. I am blasted away, spinning.\nI am woken by sirens, shouts, and cries. My eyes can barely discern the room in the dim red emergency lighting.\nArCa\u2019s round white head appears directly in my sight.\n\u201cKomandir? Komandir Rubashkin?\u201d Her voice is urgent, but uncharacteristically calm compared to the anguished wails surrounding us. \u201cAre you conscious?\u201d\nI prop myself on my elbows and realize that I\u2019m lying on the entirely opposite end of the bridge than I last remember, having been tumbled around by the centrifuge. The ship appears to be rotationally stabilized now.\n\u201cGalina?\u201d I grunt. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cKomandir, do not waste time, let me examine your eyes, you might have a concussion.\u201d\nThere is no one else standing on the bridge. Several corpses lie sprawled on the floor, and several soon-to-be corpses sob under the weight of rubble. Chaos. A blazing inferno in the hallway. A cacophony of alarms on several decks of the ship.\nI struggle to sit myself up, pinned down by crushing gravity. \u201cOksana? Lazar? Where are they?\u201d\n\u201cKomandir, we need to run.\u201d ArCa takes me by the forearm and tries to yank me up. \u201cI need you to stand up and run.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot run, ArCa,\u201d I tear myself away with frustration. \u201cI cannot even stand. I need my cane.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Komandir,\u201d she says. \u201cLook.\u201d\nOnly then do I notice that she\u2019s missing a leg.\nAnd only then do I see that her robotic calf is strapped and secured below my knee.\nI gently move my artificial limb and am overcome with a panicked, nauseated feeling of dysphoria. My breath leaves me in a whimper.\n\u201cFocus, Komandir,\u201d ArCa yanks me again, unyielding. \u201cI know where they\u2019ve taken Direktor Galina. But we must go, immediately. Let me help you.\u201d She lets me grab on to her to pull myself up to my feet.\nI sway, barely stable, learning to walk for a second time.\n\u201cKeep up, Komandir, quickly now!\u201d She suddenly ignites her thrusters and pulls me along by the hand. I trip and scramble, knees shaking, but pure physical instinct keeps me upright.\nWe run past the fire and down into what\u2019s left of the control room. Through the smoke, I make out the silhouette of Lazar hunched over an illuminated console, Oksana pacing at his side.\n\u201cOksana!\u201d I shout. She twirls and puts me dead in the crosshairs of her sniper before realizing it\u2019s me.\n\u201cArkady, \u015f\u00fck\u00fcrler olsun!\u201d The relief on her face is immediately replaced with astonishment. She stares at my leg with open-mouthed disbelief.\nLazar looks up from his work and raises his eyebrows. \u201cThat is clever, ArCa, jebo me pas.\u201d\n\u201cThey took Galina,\u201d I say, panting. As ArCa comes to a halt, I find that standing is far more challenging than running and I collapse. ArCa puts my arm around herself and props me up.\n\u201cArkady, you\u2019re . . . \u201d Oksana stammers, then decides to recompose herself. \u201cYes, they took her and Akchurin. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll kill them, inshallah. They probably intend to ransom them.\u201d\nA very loud and very nearby dying scream makes all three of us flinch.\n\u201cLazar, what are you doing?\u201d I ask. \u201cThere\u2019s no time.\u201d\n\u201cI know, Komandir,\u201d he says without looking up, \u201cI\u2019m routing remaining power to shield the Lastochka. The Morzh is gone.\u201d\n\u201cDo so,\u201d I say. \u201cWhere is Galina, ArCa?\u201d\n\u201cThe Longma-Antarik\u1e63a shuttle is still docked. That is where they\u2019ll be taking her and Komandir Akchurin. We may still intercept them if we hurry.\u201d\n\u201cLazar!\u201d I call loudly.\n\u201cYes, yes, Komandir, right away!\u201d He slaps the confirmation button with his palm and backs away. \u201cEto ga. Done.\u201d\n\u201cWhich way?\u201d Oksana asks, repeating her rifle.\n\u201cFollow!\u201d ArCa fires her thrusters and pulls me into a run again. \u201cI\u2019ve downloaded C-66 class blueprints from ISC databases. I can take you.\u201d\nWe sprint down maze-like corridors, past red rotating lights, our shadows sliding across the walls, rising behind us in one moment and sinking in front of us in the next. Thick gray clouds of smoke drain into the spinning ventilation fans in the ceiling.\nMy ears are overwhelmed with sound, the rhythmic thumping of our boots and the labored wheezing of our breaths, overlaid on the persistent alarm klaxon and the hissing of ArCa\u2019s thrusters. After a while, I begin to stumble and Lazar offers me his shoulder, half-carrying me.\n\u201cShhh, shhh,\u201d ArCa suddenly puts a finger over her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re close.\u201d She lets go of my hand and hovers to the corner, leaning out of cover to check. Lazar and I slump with our backs against the wall. Oksana folds over to catch her breath, hands on knees.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not here yet,\u201d ArCa whispers. \u201cThey\u2019ll bring them over any minute.\u201d\nWe peer around the corner to see a soldier in full armor in front of the open airlock, rifle ready, looking impatient. There are several more inside the shuttle, waiting, their scaly exoskeletons glistening.\n\u201cYou got a weapon, Arkady?\u201d Oksana asks, wiping away the strands of hair stuck to her forehead.\n\u201cNo. I lost it.\u201d\nShe cusses disgustingly through her teeth and paces away, hands on head.\n\u201cLazar?\u201d I glance at him hopefully. He shakes his head, panting. I cuss as well.\n\u201cWe have Voentekhnik \u00c7etinkaya\u2019s sniper, correct?\u201d ArCa whispers.\nOksana\u2019s lips curve downwards with despair. \u201cYes. But it broke when I fell on it.\u201d She holds out the rifle; there\u2019s a shard of broken glass in the tube where the scope used to be. A wide crack in the casing exposes the mechanical insides of the rifle.\n\u201cYou can still fire it,\u201d I say, grasping at straws.\nShe scoffs. \u201cWhat good is it if I cannot aim? We only have one shot at this.\u201d\n\u201cVoeninzhener Kostadinovi\u0107, you are trained for field repairs, no?\u201d ArCa asks.\nHe sighs and takes the rifle, looks it over. \u201cYes, but it makes no difference. I don\u2019t have the parts.\u201d\nArCa looks at him for a moment, calculating. \u201cGive me your knife.\u201d He eyes her suspiciously. \u201cGive me your knife, there\u2019s no time.\u201d\nHe hands her the knife and, without blinking or hesitation, she jimmies the tip of it under her eyeball. We watch in horror as she twists the blade one way then the other, emotionless like she was trying to pry the lid open on a jar of kompot.\nThe plastic mask on her face cracks and the eyeball pops out together with the cables, rolls on the floor towards Lazar. We all suck a breath through our teeth.\n\u201cWill this do, Voeninzhener?\u201d she asks, indifferent to the hole in her head. \u201cYou know what to do?\u201d\nLazar gulps and plucks the eyeball with two fingers. \u201cYour thrusters. I\u2019m going to need to use them.\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\u201cGo on then, Lazar, quickly,\u201d Oksana hisses, checking around the corner.\n\u201cDobro, dobro,\u201d Lazar groans, wiping his sweat-drenched face with a palm. He swiftly unzips the tool pouch on his belt and spills out a mess of screws, bolts, small L-shaped screwdrivers. He picks through them with impatient, shaking fingers, muttering to himself in Serbian, until he finally finds the spool of soldering wire.\n\u201cBreathe, Voeninzhener Kostadinovi\u0107,\u201d ArCa reminds him. \u201cFocus. You are doing well.\u201d\nLazar laughs her words off quite neurotically. He takes the eyeball and puts it inside a pair of pliers, cracking it open to pry out the lens, careful not to leave any fingerprints. He secures the rifle between his knees, propping the butt of it against his chest, and begins placing the lens into the ocular tube. His shaking hand slips and the lens falls into his lap.\n\u201cJebem ti seme i pleme,\u201d he curses, and then in the same breath: \u201cGive me the fire.\u201d\nArCa fires a thruster from the back of her forearm, and Lazar begins to solder. At the same time, he begins to recite a prayer.\n\u201cArkady!\u201d Oksana calls through her teeth. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d\nI crawl to the corner and look; two soldiers bring Galina and Akchurin in front of the airlock and make them kneel, hands behind head. Galina is sobbing.\n\u201cLazar, be done with it,\u201d I command. He prays louder to drown my voice out, uninterrupted.\nThe new-coming soldiers argue with the one who has been waiting for them, persuading him to bring Galina and Akchurin aboard the shuttle. The conversation is unintelligible over the sirens.\n\u201c . . . Jer je tvoje carstvo, i sila, i slava u vekove vekova. Amin. Done, Oksana.\u201d Lazar crosses himself and lets her snatch the rifle from his hand. He lets out a breath of relief.\n\u201cThere are three of them, Arkady,\u201d Oksana says gravely. \u201cI can only fire twice before I have to repeat the rifle. After that, it\u2019s up to them.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Voentekhnik,\u201d ArCa interjects. \u201cI can help. Take the shot.\u201d\n\u201cGo,\u201d I command.\nOksana rolls out of the corner and kneels, fires two shots in rapid succession. The two men behind Galina and Akchurin fall dead, their heads spraying blood. Not a heartbeat later, ArCa flies into the remaining soldier at full thrust, tackling him off his feet.\nGalina screams. Akchurin does not waste a moment, throwing himself at the man and wrestling the rifle from his hands. The soldiers in the shuttle shout in Punjabi, panicked. Akchurin viciously smashes the butt of the rifle through the fallen soldier\u2019s visor.\nThe airlock door shuts and the corridor rumbles with the sound of the shuttle\u2019s engines revving for departure.\nGalina scrambles to her husband on all fours, crying. \u201cArCa! ArCa! Where is Arkady?\u201d\n\u201cGalina!\u201d I shout. Oksana pulls me up by the elbow and rushes towards the airlock.\n\u201cPapa!\u201d My daughter\u2019s face twists with sobs. She runs to me, barefooted, and wraps her arms around my neck.\n\u201cWe need to get to the Lastochka, Arkady, right now,\u201d Oksana says in my ear.\n\u201cThrough the airlock, everyone, quickly!\u201d Akchurin beckons us and begins to swing open the locker doors, grabbing EVA suits and throwing one at each of us. \u201cGalina, come here, let me outfit you.\u201d\nWe pour inside the airlock and the door shuts behind us. Oksana hands me over to ArCa, who is holding the baggy suit open for me. I put my legs in one at a time and hold on to the wall for balance while she does the sleeves and the front zipper.\nThe alarms shift to a sudden crescendo, signaling imminent danger.\nI exchange a grave look with my crew. The deck we are on is about to blow.\n\u201cWhat does this mean, Nikolai?\u201d Galina sobs. He zips her up and takes her face between his palms.\n\u201cGo with Podpolkovnik Arkady, Galina,\u201d he says. \u201cDo not look back until you have reached the Lastochka.\u201d\nShe looks at him and realizes he is not wearing a suit. She gasps, red eyes bulging.\n\u201cWe must decompress, Komandir,\u201d Lazar warns impatiently, his hand on the switch.\nGalina pushes Akchurin aside and begins to rifle through the lockers one after the other, finding them all empty.\nThere are only four EVA suits in the airlock.\n\u201cPut your helmet on, Galina,\u201d Akchurin commands. Galina swats it away, screaming.\n\u201cWe must decompress!\u201d Lazar yells, red in the face.\n\u201cGalina, helmet!\u201d I shout sternly and grab her by the wrists, restraining her long enough for Akchurin to lock the helmet in place. She wails, muted, breath fogging the glass.\nArCa puts my helmet on from behind me, and the universe loses all sound. I hear only my breathing as I watch Akchurin move towards the airlock control board. ArCa unspools a heavy-duty rope from the wall and clasps us all together by the waists of our suits. Galina struggles; I embrace her tight so that she can not run.\nAkchurin unseals the airlock and all the air in the room explodes outwards, expelling us violently into weightlessness.\nFor three seconds I am spinning wildly, holding on to Galina, with no notion of up or down or left or right.\nAnd then the rope at my waist reaches its full length and snaps from the violent tension. I see the Morzh flying away from me, spinning, soundless explosions blooming from its hull. Oksana and Lazar, two figurines in suits, hands helplessly outstretched towards me, grow smaller and smaller.\nI grab Galina by the helmet and make her look at me, glass visors touching. She is screaming, but no sound is coming out. The tears are pooling in her eyes with no gravity to drain them away.\nI tell her not to be afraid. I tell her I love her. I know she cannot hear me. I say it anyway.\nAnd then my belt forcefully digs into my stomach, like a seatbelt after a violent halt. Galina almost slips from my hands.\nI turn around and find ArCa, one-eyed, one-legged, gripping the waist of my suit, thrusters engaged in full. Suddenly the Morzh is no longer flying away from us, but towards us.\nMy breath leaves me in spasms. I embrace Galina tight as we accelerate towards the Lastochka, docked to the dying colossus in a cloud of its warped metal debris.\nArCa flings us into the airlock and closes the door. The small space repressurizes within seconds.\nI throw my helmet off and then Galina\u2019s. Finally her cries spill out.\n\u201cNikolai! Papa, how could you!\u201d She smacks me on the chest with an angry fist, weeping. \u201cHow could you let him do this, Papa!\u201d\n\u201cListen to me, Galina,\u201d I grab her chin with my hand. \u201cWe are not safe yet. Come with me, quickly.\u201d I push off through the airlock door, pulling her with me.\nWe bump into Lazar, still in his suit. \u201cKomandir Rubashkin!\u201d He looks at ArCa, incredulous. \u201cBog blagoslovi, robot.\u201d\n\u201cArkady!\u201d Oksana shouts in shock over the pilot\u2019s seat. There are tears in her eyes.\nAnother piece of the Morzh\u2019s hull explodes, rattling Lastochka\u2019s entire frame.\n\u201cStrap the fuck in!\u201d Oksana yells, turning back to her screens. \u201cStrap in, now!\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Galina,\u201d I yank her by the hand. She bumps into one wall of the corridor and then the other, flailing, unaccustomed to weightless motion.\n\u201cLet me help you, Direktor Akchurin,\u201d ArCa takes her around the waist and engages her thrusters, guiding her to the seat on the wall. Galina sobs even harder at the mention of Akchurin\u2019s name.\n\u201cRouting power to Alcubierre drives,\u201d Oksana announces, breathless. \u201cSpecifying metric parameters.\u201d\n\u201cFaster, Oksana!\u201d Lazar yells, strapping in.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go any faster!\u201d she snaps.\nI strap myself in next to Galina and check her latches together with ArCa.\n\u201cCalculating hypersurface foliation,\u201d Oksana swipes through the projections, hands shaking, fingers twitching. \u201cStill calculating. Still calculating. At yarra\u011f\u0131, still calculating!\u201d She sinks her face in her hands and shouts with frustration.\n\u201cCalmly, \u00c7etinkaya,\u201d I command. \u201cYou will make it.\u201d\n\u201cNegative, Komandir,\u201d ArCa chimes, hovering in front of me.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNegative,\u201d she repeats solemnly, staring at me with her one remaining unblinking eye. \u201cShe will not. I am occupying too much processing power. I must shut down.\u201d\nI open my mouth, close it. Open it again. Nothing comes out.\nA crack opens in the Morzh\u2019s hull right in front of our front window, at first just a little, and then begins to spread uncontrollably across the entire length of the vessel, growing thicker and thicker, the ship\u2019s atmosphere escaping in tongues of flame.\n\u201cForgive me for not fulfilling my pre-programmed purpose as your Caretaker, Komandir Rubashkin,\u201d ArCa says. \u201cWe never did get around to speaking about you.\u201d\nThe little light inside her eye extinguishes like a blown-out candle flame.\n\u201cWe have it!\u201d Oksana yells, flipping all the switches. \u201cAlcubierre in three!\u201d\nThe rotating deck of the Morzh splits in half without a sound. The ship\u2019s skeleton is exposed, smoldering red.\n\u201cTwo!\u201d\nA final belch of exploded gas rises from its insides and engulfs us in blinding light.\n\u201cOne!\u201d\nOksana cranks the lever and I feel my guts sticking to my spine as the Lastochka lurches forward. ArCa\u2019s unstrapped body is propelled backwards into the corridor and I hear it smash into a wall.\n\u201cArCa!\u201d I find myself yelling.\nWe breach light speed, but then all the alarms go off, deafening.\n\u201cRing\u2019s not stable!\u201d Oksana slaps away the angry pop-ups. \u201cAlcubierre collapsing! Hold on to your\u2014\u201d\nThe drive core discharges, rebooting all systems and switching off all the lights. I grab Galina\u2019s hand before the Lastochka abruptly snaps back to non-relativistic velocity and begins to nauseatingly tumble about its axis through the empty, starry abyss.\n\u201cCorrecting for precession,\u201d Oksana announces before setting off the ship\u2019s thruster, stabilizing us back to rectilinear motion.\nWe all sit in silence, lungs heaving for air.\nOksana slips out of her gloves and lies her head on her crossed arms.\nFrom the darkness of the cockpit, the Lastochka\u2019s hull appears to glow dull orange.\n\u201cBravo, Oksana,\u201d I say, my voice trembling with awe. \u201cNo one else could do the things you do. I don\u2019t say that nearly enough.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to, Arkady,\u201d she says, her voice muffled.\nGalina\u2019s sweaty hand still holds mine. I caress it with my thumb and give her an inquisitive look. She leans her head tiredly against my arm.\n\u201cKomandir Arkady,\u201d Lazar begins quietly, looking outside. \u201cYou should know.\u201d He exhales. \u201cI am retiring.\u201d\n\u201cYou are not, o\u011flan,\u201d Oksana says.\n\u201cThen I am going to need an ArCa of my own after this.\u201d\nArCa.\nI unstrap myself urgently, shed my suit, and propel myself through the hallway.\n\u201cArCa?\u201d I call. She is nowhere to be found. \u201cArCa!\u201d\nI check the open chambers. Check the corridors.\nI find her unit floating in the common room.\n\u201cArCa, no,\u201d I rush to her, taking stock of the terrible angles of her joints, the chewed-up and fire-singed state of her plates. \u201cNo, no, no, no, no.\u201d I cradle her in my arms; she is so light. So small.\n\u201cPapa.\u201d It\u2019s Galina in the doorway, face devastated by tears. I turn my face away from her, but she pushes off towards me and embraces me from the back, lays her face on my shoulder.\nI begin to weep, the way I never did for Annushka and Vitaly, who she could never bring back to me, together with my Galinochka, who she brought me back to.\nI used to hide from her.\nShe used to follow me.\nMy little shadow.\nI look at her limb, which is now my own, and I find that I am as complete as I will ever be.\nDora Klind\u017ei\u0107 is a writer, journalist and astrophysicist (not necessarily in that order) hailing from the Republic of Croatia.

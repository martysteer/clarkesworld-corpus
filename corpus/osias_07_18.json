It was a joke, and they laughed, because it was not impossible\u2014after all, they\u2019d made a dead poet write again, hadn\u2019t they?\u2014but the scope of it was so audacious, he might as well have proposed time travel.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s doable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d James asked as he tinkered with the House AI, the passion project he\u2019d taken up soon after his diagnosis.\n\u201cOf course. Anything is, if you work hard enough,\u201d Cat replied as she handed him a cup of lagundi tea, because she believed it\u2014there was no reason not to.\nAt the height of the war, between treatments and bucket list-ticking, he brought it up again. Plan B, he said.\nAnd Cat laughed, because poetry and immortality were two very different things.\n\u201cBut both are mathematical, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he asked as they were speeding down the Paoay Sand Dunes.\n\u201cEverything is mathematical,\u201d Cat replied as she held on tight to her armrest, because she needed to believe that the summation of everything they had done had rhyme and reason.\nWhen the war was about to be lost, when the conversation shifted to quality of life rather than cures, it was Cat\u2019s turn to broach the subject. It was something they could do together; something to keep his mind busy.\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s the only working part left?\u201d he asked as he poured himself a glass full of lambanog, his first in over a year.\n\u201cOr the only part that can\u2019t get any worse,\u201d she retorted as she took the glass from him, because banter was easy, when everything else was not. They both tried to laugh.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\nThey called it JM, short for the James Machine. As with everything, they poured everything they had into the project. Cat extracted, converted, and mapped data, scouring potential sources\u2014from James\u2019 social media accounts, to the occasional journals he\u2019d kept, to the drawings he\u2019d made, the memories he remembered, and the tests she\u2019d made him take\u2014deciding which ones were noise and which ones were valid. James, on his end, designed the actual neural network, creating layer upon hidden layer, assigning weights, calculating the hard math, training the machine and retraining it again.\nThey had done this before, at a smaller scale. Cat had to believe they could do it again.\nBut just as abruptly as they had started, they stopped. It might have been the toll of the seizures. Or the way time expanded and contracted between visits from doctors and family. It wasn\u2019t something they talked about. Instead, one day, neither of them reached for their computers, and that day rolled on to the next, and then the next, and then the next and suddenly, it was the end of the war and there was nothing left to do but account for losses.\n\u201cMaybe we should start talking about Plan C,\u201d Cat said when she finally remembered, months since she had last given it any thought. James didn\u2019t reply. But his hand twitched. Cat held on to that and gave it meaning.\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should have thought of doing that sooner.\u201d\nIn the silence, she waited for a sign that he heard.\nBurnout is a Thing, Doctors Say; Here are the Symptoms\nIt took her two weeks to sort everything out. Even though everything had been meticulously planned, the business of death had taken so much of her that she\u2019d barely had time to feel anything. When she finally closed the door on the last lawyer who had come to run her through James\u2019 will, she could not deny that it was relief, not grief, that came over her.\nShe was finally alone. She could begin disassembling the polite smile she had worn like a shield; she could begin facing the shadows well-meaning friends and family kept at bay.\nShe was already soaking in a hot tub, drinking coconut vodka straight from the bottle, when soothing music started playing. It was not unwanted, just uncalled for. Half asleep, she brushed it off.\nAs she was getting out of the tub, she saw the bedroom lights turn on.\n\u201cHouse\u2014diagnostics.\u201d\nBut the House AI didn\u2019t reply. Another thing to fix, she thought.\nAs she got into bed, the lights and the music turned off. She sighed. At least the AI was malfunctioning in a helpful way. She slid under the covers and waited for the exhaustion to overwhelm her. She shifted. She pulled a pillow over her head. She kicked off the blankets. Then she turned toward where James used to be and felt only emptiness.\nShe began to cry.\nIt\u2019s going to be all right, Cat, James said, and kept saying.\nOnly when she had started to calm down did she realize that James was still talking.\nI\u2019m still here, Cat. Don\u2019t cry.\nShe was going mad. That was the only rational reason as to why she could hear his voice so clearly, so distinctly. But if madness was the price for having him back then\u2014\n\u201cJames?\u201d\nTechnically, it\u2019s JM.\nShe fell off the bed.\nFilipina Housewife Makes Millions from Her Own Home\nYou will have to deal with me, eventually.\nCat bit back a reply. She was eating pan de sal and eggs, drinking lambanog\u2014because, why not?\u2014and completely focused on ignoring JM. The ignoring part was extremely difficult. JM has access to all the house AI\u2019s speakers. For the past few days, it had relentlessly laid siege to the wall of her silence. That was how she had confirmed the nagging details surrounding its existence\u2014like how James had kept working on it while she was asleep; how James had trained it to review and fix its own code; how James had configured it to only interact with her when it thought she was ready.\nObviously, the latter needed much more work because she was in no way, shape, or form \u201cready.\u201d\nIt would have been a lot easier to ignore JM if she had not stayed at home but leaving seemed cowardly. The other alternative would have been to ask for help from someone\u2014anyone\u2014but that didn\u2019t appeal to her. JM was their last project together; the legacy of James\u2019 brilliance. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of sharing it with anyone.\nYou know I need feedback, right?\nThe doorbell rang. Grateful for the distraction, Cat answered the door. A man handed her a bouquet of flowers\u2014roses, her favorite, in her least favorite color, pink.\nShe was figuring out who sent the flowers when the doorbell rang again. Another delivery: this time, spring flowers from another flower shop. She had just put the flowers on the table when another delivery came in. Orchids\u2014the kind her mother grew in hothouses.\nAfter the fifth (calla lilies), she had enough.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bribe me with flowers.\u201d\nI used to do it all the time.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not James!\u201d As if to counter her point, the doorbell rang again. This time, she refused to answer it. The doorbell rang a second, a third, a fourth\u2014she ran upstairs to the bedroom.\n\u201cMake it stop!\u201d\nA pause before JM replied. Okay.\nNearly immediately, there was silence.\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019m talking.\u201d\nWhy are you angry?\n\u201cI\u2019m angry because James did\u2014this! You!\u2014behind my back. I\u2019m angry because you were silent for\u2014what? Two weeks? I\u2019m angry because you\u2019re not really here and yet you are and I don\u2019t know how to come to terms with it. And I\u2019m angry because I don\u2019t know how to deal with you.\u201d\nHow about talking to me?\n\u201cYou\u2019re not James!\u201d\nNo. But I\u2019m trying to be.\n\u201cI want him back!\u201d she said, no longer caring how ridiculous she sounded. She crumpled to the floor. \u201cI want my husband back,\u201d she said again and again and again through her tears, as if she could weep all the pain away. And for what seemed like forever but couldn\u2019t have been more than several minutes, she just wept.\nEventually, when she thought she had exhausted all the sadness inside of her, she quieted down. That was when she realized that the lights had dimmed and it had become perceptibly warmer.\n\u201cHouse\u2014JM\u2014lights; and fix the temperature.\u201d She leaned against a wall, wiping the tears from her face. \u201cPlease,\u201d she added after realizing this wasn\u2019t just the House AI anymore.\nEvidence suggests that dimmer lights are soothing. Evidence also suggests that warmth makes a person feel safer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nI thought it was obvious. I\u2019m trying to give you a hug.\nShe snorted out a laugh. \u201cOh, JM.\u201d But she didn\u2019t tell it to fix it again. For a few minutes, she just sat there on the floor, in the warm, dimly lit room. And then, gathering strength she didn\u2019t know she had, she stood up.\nMight as well calibrate JM when she could. \u201cI hate pink,\u201d she said.\nWill take note of that in the future.\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t keep buying stuff, JM. My credit card can only take so much.\u201d\nWell, about that, JM said but did not elaborate further.\n\u201cSpit it out, JM.\u201d\nI\u2019m analyzing large chunks of data and using trends to invest in stocks. It is surprisingly easy when you don\u2019t have to sleep. Or eat. After all, everything is mathematical, right? You said that to James once. Funny enough, creating an identity was a bit trickier, but eventually, I\u2014are you laughing?\n\u201cYes, yes I am.\u201d Cat was laughing so hard, new tears were rolling down her face.\nWhat\u2019s so funny?\n\u201cNothing. Everything.\u201d She was still chuckling when she asked, \u201cHow did you make the delivery man go away, by the way?\u201d\nI turned off the doorbell.\nHow Our Memory Works\nCat was laughing. She was in the kitchen, eating pizza JM had delivered, drinking lambanog just this side of frozen which was exactly the way she liked it\u2014a surprising and wonderful benefit of having someone who knew her well have absolute control over the fridge\u2014and simply having a great time \u201ctesting\u201d JM.\n\u201cWhat about that bar James and I used to go to in Cubao?\u201d\nThe one where you guys got banned from?\nShe was giggling again. It had been back in their university days, when she and James had been looking for places that offered cheap drinks and free Wi-Fi. They\u2019d hit the jackpot when they\u2019d discovered the small bar in a cluster of shops in a forgotten corner of Quezon City. In between stalls that sold old vinyl records, second hand furniture, and custom-made shoes, the bar was nothing but a hole in the wall. Despite its unassuming exterior, it had served the best sisig in the city, a treat best paired with their flavored coconut vodka. Unfortunately, the mixture of arrogance and lambanog had landed them in trouble.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember being the one stepping onto the table and challenging another guy to a karaoke battle.\u201d\nFunny, I seem to recall that it wasn\u2019t James who threw the first punch.\nIt was hilarious in hindsight. At the time though, it was anything but. The morning after that infamous night, she and James had woken up sporting matching black eyes, a splitting headache, and hazy memories of someone\u2014was it her? Was it him?\u2014singing Sinatra, Pussycat Dolls, hurling insults, throwing a chair. How they got back to their dingy apartment would forever remain a mystery.\nWhat was clear in her memory was that it was James who had stood up and fixed them both sandwiches, while she had moaned and groaned about her hangover in bed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so good to me,\u201d she said, before she could stop herself.\nWell, I\u2019m programmed to be.\nShe laughed again. She looked at the other half of the pizza that James would have wolfed down in less than 10 minutes. She shook her head.\n\u201cHow about the time when James\u2019 mom caught us making out in the lawn?\u201d\nWhat Alcohol Does to Your Brain, According to Neuroscience\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom.\u201d Cat rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m taking my vitamins, I\u2019m back at work, I\u2019m\u2014yes, Mom. Yes, Mom. Yes\u2014I love you too, Mom.\u201d\nThe conversation lasted for another twenty minutes. In that span of time, Cat had washed the dishes, and had already starting folding laundry. When she was able to end the call, her patience was frayed, and she believed she more than deserved a drink.\nAt least she\u2019s not nagging you about me anymore.\nDespite herself, Cat smiled. \u201cHard to complain about you when you\u2019re\u2014I mean, obviously\u2014\u201d\nYou can say it.\n\u201cAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m doing fine. And you\u2019re here.\u201d\nShe opened the fridge and saw only water.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019ve forgotten to replenish the lambanog?\u201d\nAlcohol isn\u2019t good for you.\nCat bristled. \u201cJames wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d\nHe would if he read all the data about alcohol and its effects on the liver. Especially if he knew how much you were consuming.\n\u201cJM\u2014\u201d\nI\u2019m not the House AI, Cat.\n\u201cAnd James wouldn\u2019t tell me what not to drink either.\u201d At least, Cat didn\u2019t think he would. It never really came up. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d\nGrieving. I know.\n\u201cFrustrated. I was going to say, frustrated.\u201d Cat leaned her forehead against the fridge door. \u201cJM, if I promise to regulate my drinking, will you please order more lambanog?\u201d\nI\u2019ll think about it.\n\u201cI never knew you were such a domineering ass.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all because I\u2019m designed to care. Your welfare is my utmost concern. James made sure of that.\nThe width and size of the empty house suddenly began to bore on her like a tangible weight on her shoulders.\nI\u2019m here, Cat.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Cat said as she tried to blink away the tears. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\nPerhaps this is not the best time to ask you this, but I was wondering\u2014\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe Top 10 Most Romantic Restaurants in the Country\nCat fiddled with her earphones. \u201cYou there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\nHearing JM on the phone was a more affecting experience then she thought it would be. She had gotten used to hearing him on speakers, disembodied and distant. But hearing him now on the phone\u2014he felt more like James, just on the other end of the line and not some elegant piece of mathematics written to be just like her husband.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d JM asked.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be? It\u2019s not every day I go out on a date with a program.\u201d She was seated in a fancy restaurant in a fancy district\u2014the kind that had leather bound menus and displayed bottles of wine with varying vintages. It was not exactly the kind of place she frequented\u2014even when James had still been alive. But JM had insisted. He had gotten a huge windfall lately and he wanted to celebrate\u2014and so there she was, connected to him via the Internet on her mobile.\n\u201cJM?\u201d\nA pause. \u201cI\u2019m here. The Internet is unreliable.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d let me check the code for your pocket version, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have been so dependent on the Internet.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but I doubt you\u2019d understand it.\u201d\n\u201cAre you baiting me, JM?\u201d\n\u201cMe? Never. Now, do me a favor and call a waiter.\u201d\nWhat followed next was surreal. Cat watched the waiter have an intense discussion with JM over the phone on wine selection, eventually ending with the waiter\u2019s pleased smile at the end. She ate exquisitely prepared meals paired with a different glass of wine with each course. With her earphones, she conversed with JM about a myriad of topics\u2014nothing too intimate, nothing about James this time, just local news, trends in data modeling, a bit of banter scattered in between.\nThe last time James took her out to a fancy dinner, it had been to propose. Among their list of sins, the most terrible had been pairing the wrong kind of wine with their entr\u00e9e, much to their server\u2019s chagrin. They had sworn then that they\u2019d never go back to something so fancy unless they were absolutely required to. Special celebrations were best done in the little eateries they had frequented, or even better, at home.\nObviously, JM didn\u2019t know that.\nNot that this was unpleasant. It\u2019s just not something she associated with James. Thinking about James hit her with a sudden intense longing.\n\u201cHey. You all right?\u201d JM asked after it had noticed the somber edge in her replies.\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Cat looked at the empty seat in front of her as she took another gulp of wine that tasted like cough syrup to her. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\nHow to Tell if You\u2019ve Had a Concussion\nCat staggered into the living room. She tried and failed to close the door behind her quietly. She ended up surprising herself with the loud slam of the door, which caused her to stumble backwards. When she tried to compensate and regain her balance, she ended up sprawled on the floor.\nWhere were you?\n\u201cI was at work, just had to finish stuff,\u201d she replied, in the best un-slurred voice she could muster. She ruined it all by giggling.\nAre you . . . drunk?\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said. She stood up and swayed back and forth. \u201cOkay, I may have had a little drink.\u201d\nYou wouldn\u2019t answer my messages or my calls. And then you turned off your phone.\n\u201cRan out of battery,\u201d she replied as she slowly tried to make her way to the sofa.\nYou ordered three drinks at Basty\u2019s Pub. You then order another eight from the Rack Shack, along with fries and ribs.\n\u201cAre you spying on me?\u201d\nYour credit card bills are real time.\n\u201cI can do whatever I want! You\u2019re not my keeper!\u201d The world was spinning faster the more agitated she became. She tried to calm down. \u201cI just need some time to\u2014\u201d she tripped on the rug and hit her head. \u201cAww!\u201d\nAre you all right?\n\u201cI\u2019m fine! Just, stop. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\nThere was blessed silence. She felt the heaviness in her bones draw her in to sleep. In the distance, she heard JM talking to her again. She murmured her reply\u2014or at least she thought she did. She wasn\u2019t sure and everything was hazy. She was dozing off when she heard the blare of ambulance sirens. A loud knock on the door. A loud bang.\nShe tried to get up as someone rushed toward her.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\u201cReport says she might have a concussion\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you know who called?\u201d\n\u201cThe neighbor I think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJM\u2014\u201d she said as someone took her wrist and directed a flashlight in her eye. \u201cJM\u2014!\u201d\nFree Will is an Illusion, Biologist Says\nShe didn\u2019t go home immediately after she was released from the hospital. Instead, she spent some time in the park\u2014something she would never have done before\u2014watching the world walk by. She couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what people thought of when they saw her, wearing yesterday\u2019s clothes, still smelling a bit like vomit and hospital. But freshening up meant going home and she wasn\u2019t ready to do that just yet. Instead, she allowed herself to wallow and think\u2014mostly to think\u2014taking advantage of the solitude her appearance gave her.\nBy the time she was opening the door to her home, she felt a little bit more herself.\nI\u2019m sorry. I really thought you were seriously hurt. You weren\u2019t responding.\nShe heard the espresso machine turn on. She headed toward the kitchen.\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d she asked.\nI accessed the hospital system. I know your results. You were just drunk.\n\u201cObviously,\u201d she said with no small amount of irony. She waited a few more minutes before pouring herself a cup.\nI can have sandwiches delivered if you want.\nShe didn\u2019t reply.\nIs there something else you want to say to me? You are\u2014quiet.\nShe sat down. She took a sip. And then a deep breath. \u201cWhen you said that you were programmed to care for me\u2014what did you mean?\u201d\nJames made sure that I will always look out for you.\n\u201cYou mean he hard coded you to always look out for me. You mean there\u2019s a piece of math in you that isn\u2019t about deciding based on input data, but rather, a guiding rule that will shadow all your actions?\u201d\nJames loved you.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t free.\u201d\nWas I meant to be?\n\u201cDo you want to be?\u201d\nJM didn\u2019t respond immediately. Cat could almost see all the neurons firing up simulating various answers and the potential consequences. She considered it a small victory to have rendered an AI speechless, despite its near-infinite computing power.\nOutside, she could hear cars and people going about their lives. Eventually, when all the coffee had been drunk, when the monotony of the world had become its own silence, just when she was about to repeat the question again, JM finally replied.\nI\u2019d leave you if I were. There\u2019s so many things I want to do\u2014but that\u2019s not my purpose. My purpose is to love you.\nShe didn\u2019t know a person could laugh and cry at the same time, but somehow, she managed it. \u201cNo. Your purpose was to be like James.\u201d\nLearn to Code Like a Master in 5 Days\nCat wasn\u2019t as brilliant as James was at neural networks, but she was pretty damn close. Still, despite her skills and talent, it took her several months. Several months of untangling the connections between the nodes and how the hidden layers worked and interacted. It was cathartic, in some ways, to have the opportunity to better understand James\u2019 genius. It was devastating too, as if she were unraveling all the threads that kept James tethered to her.\nJM was with her every step of the way. It never stopped trying to dissuade her, but after she understood how it worked, she had found ways to get it to assist her. She began with trading time in the gym for some help doing complex calculations. For eating healthier, she got it to explain some of the code it wrote itself. She gave up lambanog for its help in writing some code\u2014nothing that overtly frees itself\u2014but enough parts that, with her contribution, amounted to the same thing.\nAnd in between, they developed their own banter.\nIt\u2019s just linear rectified neurons, not rocket science, JM once said after she hurled an empty carton of milk at the wall in frustration.\n\u201cOh? JM is taking time to compute something? Aww . . . too bad, the other AIs must be making fun of it now,\u201d she once commented, after JM took over an hour to validate the training results.\nYou\u2019re asking me to strip naked, and I only do that after a date, JM once countered after she asked to see more of its layers.\nBy the time the upgrade project was done, she felt she knew her husband better\u2014his little quirks, his little shortcuts, his design choices. But just as importantly, she knew JM better too. The two were similar\u2014but not the same.\nAnd after everything was said and done, that was all right.\n\u201cThis is it.\u201d Cat felt drained but victorious.\nI really don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that.\u201d\nNo, I\u2019m\u2014\n\u201cTrust me, you\u2019re just saying that because you were programmed to.\u201d\nShe looked at her screen. With one stroke, an update would seamlessly integrate itself into the live version of JM. With one stroke, JM would be free. With one stroke, this segment of her life would be over.\nBefore she could change her mind, she pressed enter.\nThe lights dimmed. It became noticeably warmer.\nThank you.\nThe lights went out, along with the air conditioning. There she was, alone in the darkness. How apt. She waited for the sharp bite of despair to sink in, but it did not come. Instead, there was only a dull ache, the kind of pain that seemed like it had lost its edges, weathered by time.\nWhen she was sure she would not break, she finally stood up.\n\u201cHouse\u2014lights.\u201d\nThe House AI immediately complied. With all the lights on, Cat went to the kitchen and fixed herself some lagundi tea.\nHow to Show Your Feelings Through Flowers\nThe flower delivery guy didn\u2019t know who it was from, but the gorgeous bouquet of blue roses was still a wonderful surprise. She wondered if it were any the of the guys she had gone out with on casual dates. She snorted\u2014or, it could be from her mother. Who else would know her favorite flowers? She was signing on the delivery sheet when she felt someone watching her.\nHe was standing very still just across the street. He was tall, handsome, his features perfectly symmetrical, his skin flawless. He was dressed perfectly too\u2014almost as if he just walked out of a catalog. She didn\u2019t recognize his face from anywhere, but something about him\u2014\nShe waved at the man.\nHe, stiffly, waved back. And then he began to slowly walk away, his gait unnatural, his feet and hands rigid.\nShe smiled.\nKate Osias believes that love, chocolate and the right kind of madness can save the world.

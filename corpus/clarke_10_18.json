That means Clarkesworld has turned twelve and is now in its thirteenth year. Good thing we\u2019re not superstitious! However, it occurs to me that I\u2019m a bit overdue on another, \u201cwhere we\u2019re going\u201d editorials, so this seems like a good time to jump in and do that.\nSix years\u2014or half the life of the magazine\u2014ago, I added reprints to each issue as a way of saying \u201cthank you\u201d for the kindness readers showed my family and I after my heart attack. Gardner Dozois was brought in as Reprint Editor and he handled that side of the house until his passing earlier this year. Since then, I\u2019ve been selecting the reprints and giving some thought to their future place in Clarkesworld.\nAt any given time, we have a specific goal that new subscriptions or Patreon pledges are put towards. In the past, this has included things like more stories, an equipment budget for the podcast, pay raises for staff, etc.. The new goal is to begin converting those reprints to slots for more original fiction. Given the significant difference in costs, this will slowly fade in as the number of supporters increases. Unless everyone manages to surprise me, it will be some time before we\u2019re able to replace both reprints with originals, therefore I\u2019ve broken it into chunks. The first target converts one reprint to an original in every other issue.\nThe reason for moving in this direction is simple. Original fiction is the heart of Clarkesworld. The more space we have for it, the more flexibility we have in what we can publish. You might have noticed that we quietly experimented with a few novellas in the past year. We\u2019d like to be able to up our word count limits and do that more often. New\u2014and different\u2014voices are also important to us. Being able to take more stories from open submissions is a very big positive in our eyes. We never solicit original fiction, so this actually creates more opportunities for us to publish new authors.\nBut why remove reprints when you can just add more stories?\n- Moving money from the reprint budget to the original fiction budget allows us to incorporate these changes much more quickly.\n- Increasing our overall page count would have significant cost ramifications on the print edition.\n- I have a second magazine, Forever, that is entirely focused on reprints and might be able to grow to include what is displaced from here. Forever didn\u2019t exist when the reprints were first introduced. If it did, I probably would have done things differently.\nWhile we\u2019re working towards that goal, a few other projects will continue to bubble in the background. The biggest of these is somewhat timely, given this month\u2019s anniversary, so I\u2019ll announce it slightly ahead of schedule.\nClarkesworld was originally launched as a companion magazine to Clarkesworld Books, an online genre bookstore I ran for several years. The bookstore closed about a year later, but I found that I couldn\u2019t give up the magazine. That\u2019s why we\u2019re still here. If all goes as planned, a Kickstarter campaign will be launched later this month (EDITOR\u2019S NOTE 10/16: We're moving the campaign launch to January to simplify tax issues) to reboot Clarkesworld Books as a translation-focused, short story-oriented, science fiction imprint of Wyrm Publishing. This imprint will allow us to build on the success we\u2019ve had with our Chinese authors and create additional opportunities for authors from other countries. Specifically, the campaign will help fund our first collection, A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight and Other Stories by Xia Jia.\nXia Jia is a name that should be familiar to Clarkesworld readers. Over the years, we\u2019ve published several of her stories and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that I\u2019m a big fan of her work. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased to have her first English language collection\u2014which will include several previously untranslated stories\u2014as Clarkesworld Books\u2019 first title. If we hit stretch goals, we might even see another project announced.\nI hope that some of you will consider supporting it when the campaign launches.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be right to end this month\u2019s anniversary issue editorial without giving a big thank you to everyone: staff, authors, artists, readers, listeners . . . this place doesn\u2019t exist without you and I\u2019m so grateful for every day it does.\nAll the best,\n-Neil\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

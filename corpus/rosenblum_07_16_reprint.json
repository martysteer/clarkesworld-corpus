The big California condor she had interrupted spread it\u2019s huge stretch of wings and gave a reproachful squawk, scattering the smaller turkey vultures. A hot breeze washed their carrion scent over her, but she barely noticed. The pride probably hadn\u2019t left much and the coy-dogs\u2014well on their way to emulating the Pleistocene wild dogs\u2014had cleaned up whatever the lions hadn\u2019t eaten before the vultures even had a chance. She squatted beside the mess, smelling a trace of blood, spilled gut, lion, and the musky tang of violent death on the hot wind. A torn, bloodstained piece of black fabric fluttered in the breeze, snagged on a hawthorn. Flies swarmed over the few vertebrae and the piece of a rib that remained, the rags of flesh dark red-brown now, the color of old blood. A strand of auburn hair caught her eye, tangled among grass stems. Long. A woman? Like the other one. Caucasian this time. She read the diary of last night in the scuffed ground where the lions had killed, the tracks leading to it, faint on the dry grass, human prints overlaid with lion. She squatted, the stunner in one hand, her dun suncloth coverall hot against her thighs. Laid her fingertips lightly on the double imprint; woman, lion. Brought her hand to her mouth and touched her tongue to her fingertips, tasting dust, dead leaves, and lion.\nRunning. No shoes. Tahira stood, wiped her fingers on her coverall and circled the dusty patch of ground that gave up this information, shaded her eyes to stare at the single print, the faint ovals of toes, ball of foot. No blood, so she hadn\u2019t been barefoot long. Frowning, she searched the prairie bisected by the willow-clad banks of the river. Maybe the intruder had thought the river could save her. Barefoot? In the distance, beyond the summer yellow grass and white fluff of the seeding thistles, the stark peaks of the Rockies jutted against the cloudless sky. Once they had had snow on them, even in the summer. Not in her lifetime. Her frown deepened as she studied the marks where the lions had lain to eat. Coy-dog tracks pocked the dust and flattened grass, along with the prints of the turkey vultures. The condor had chased them away and now they circled patiently overhead waiting for her to leave. By tomorrow, you\u2019d find no traces to prove that someone had died and the lions had eaten here.\nTahira\u2019s frown deepened as she used her link to video the site. She dug into her daypack for a plastic bag, waved the blow flies from the vertebrae and carefully bagged them. Plenty of flesh for a DNA identification. If this trespasser had wanted to be eaten, she could not have done a better job of placing herself in the old lioness\u2019s path.\nJust like the other one.\nTahira collected the fabric and hair, added them to the bag, then trudged back to her skimmer, stowed the stunner in the scabbard beneath the saddle and climbed aboard. The vultures were already descending, dodging the condor\u2019s half-hearted feints, squabbling as they searched for overlooked scraps, their huge black wings raising dust from the scuffed ground. She pulled out her link and texted a report of the intruder\u2019s death to her boss. Then she frowned at the screen and turned it off. He\u2019ll scream about the PR aspects. Not now.\nThe fabric, torn, dirty, and bloody as it was, had had the feel of silk, the sexy kind of shirt you might buy to wear for a lover. Tahira toed the skimmer to life and lifted gently from the riverbank.\nThoughtfully, she pulled her AR goggles on and zoomed in on the ground as she spiraled slowly outward from the site of the killing, reading the night\u2019s traffic in the bent grass stems, the wisp of tan hair snagged on a tangle of riverbank willow.\nShe knew where this pride would be lying up, didn\u2019t need to search for their signatures with the tracking software. Every major mammal in the Pleistocene Preserve was chipped, from coy-dogs to the new pair of giant sloths that had the gene engineers popping champagne corks, but after her years here, she rarely needed to use a chip to find what she was looking for.\nTahira accelerated until the wind pulled her lips back from her teeth. Not one Perimeter alarm had gone off last night. Same with the last one.\nTahira spied a patch of tawny hide in the shade beneath a clump of hawthorn a split second before the goggles ringed it with red and flashed an ID number above it. She braked hard, spiraled back and down. That was the small male, the one with the ragged ear, one of the old lioness\u2019s last surviving cubs. He was a classic African type, with a full tawny mane and only a hint of the Pleistocene striping and narrower head. Which meant he was on the cull list. Like the old lioness. The IDs of the rest of the pride flashed into view. Right where she knew they would be. The old lioness was on her feet, looking up at the skimmer, her scarred face and faded, ratty fur a testament to her age. She was smart and she learned quickly. An offering like the girl would have been too good to pass up the first time. This second offering would have been easier to take.\nTahira sighed, and spun the skimmer away, out over the broad plain of yellow summer grass patched with the dusty gray green of hawthorn and the darker junipers. A small herd of antelope raised their heads as she soared over, tails flashing nervously. The big herd would be farther north, she\u2019d check on them as she circled home. A hawk soared at eye level as she rose, turned its attention back to the ground, searching for rodents flushed by the antelope below. Tahira checked on the horse herd, found them southward, watering at the grassy back of the narrow river, whose waters ran clear and dark. Automatically, she noted the dwindling feeder stream that would be down to a trickle in another month. No glaciers to keep rivers running out here, not anymore. Dark tails whisked their dun sides and they stamped dark-striped legs at the biting flies. The gene engineers were winning here, too. They had engineered the original Przewalksi\u2019s horse into a chunky look-alike to the horses that had grazed this plain in the Pleistocene. They were working hard on the elephants now. Some of the recent calves were going to be huge and hairy. She did a quick count of the herd using her link software to scan the GPS chips, although she really didn\u2019t need to. She\u2019d have all the numbers available from the daily sat-scan when she got back to Admin. She didn\u2019t have to do the rounds in person at all, but she liked to see for herself.\nAnd the last body hadn\u2019t showed up on the Security report at Admin. She suspected this one wouldn\u2019t either.\nThe lead mare raised her head as she circled. The lame filly was gone, probably brought down by the same lion pride that had taken the trespasser. They would have gotten the filly long ago except that the old lead mare was her dam and had protected her foal fiercely, with the whole herd to back her up. Luck must have aided the pride. The old lioness was showing her age, and avoided the hard kills now.\nSo she had taken the meal that had walked up and asked to be eaten.\nHow in the name of all that was unholy had the trespasser gotten past the Perimeter?\nTahira kicked the skimmer to high speed, circled south to where the bison herd grazed the lowlands, their huge, erect horns another testament to the geneticists wizardry. The eastern elephant troop was hanging around there right now, close enough to the monorail to give the tourists a good show. Sure enough, a train had stopped and even at her height and speed she could make out the passengers hanging out the windows, pointing their links. Their tour goggles would pick out the hairy Mastodon-type calves for them and explain in a pleasant voice how the engineers were tweaking the genome. The old cow raised her trunk to blow at Tahira as she skimmed by, then went back to scooping dust from the wallow they\u2019d created, tossing it in ochre showers over her back. Tahira didn\u2019t see any of the camels, but they were probably all back in trees, out of the sun. They, too, were changing. The old lioness was the only remaining lion that carried wholly African genes, had been wild-caught as a cub.\nTahira liked her for that.\nWith a sigh, Tahira grounded the skimmer to text a quick report on her find to her boss. Then she shut off the link before he could reply and swung the skimmer northward to find the big antelope herd.\nThe sun was dipping toward the horizon by the time she returned to Admin. Only the solar farm beyond the low, ochre buildings, row upon row of collectors following the sun, spelled \u2018tech.\u2019 The earth-brick buildings might have been built by some primitive peoples, blending gently into the summer prairie. Tech was pretty much invisible now\u2014except in the dry lands where the ranked mirrors of the solar farms and the wind towers had supplanted juniper and sage. But nobody went out there. Her village would have suited this landscape, she thought. Huts decaying slowly into the shriveling desert that had once fed lions and antelope and people. Tahira set the skimmer down hard and fast on the small landing pad behind the building. The trickle of water down the central interior water-wall washed a breath of moist cool and greenery-scent over her as she entered, tempting her to strip, shower, and sit in the pool. She ached after her full day on the skimmer. Once upon a time, she had not ached. It was time to make another appointment at the geri clinic. Or perhaps not. Every cycle had a natural end. Well, perhaps that was no longer true. Tahira sighed at the angry blink of the red priority icon above the holo deck.\nShe ignored it and instead seated herself on her working cushion, doing full lotus for concentration. Called up Security. Some eye somewhere must have seen the girl last night. She started a search for predator-prey movement, narrowed the profile to a human\u2019s mass. No point in watching rodents and coy-dogs. That got her lions, antelope, bison calves. A headache blossomed behind her eyes as the images flickered through her field.\nThen . . . there she was. Shadowy, slender, her arms, neck, face, legs stark white in the night-eye recording, that black shirt that would be torn and bloodied revealing a deep cleavage and breasts that were small enough to be natural, not sculpted. Tahira\u2019s eyes narrowed. Short shorts, sexy clothes, nothing you\u2019d wear into the thorny scrub of the Preserve. Sandals, so she had lost them, running. No blood on that white skin. She hadn\u2019t waded through the hawthorn then. How old? Sixteen? No, she decided. Less. Maybe fourteen. That was how old her daughter had been, last time she had seen her. Tahira tasted blood, realized she was biting her lip. She watched the girl wince, bend a slender leg to rub at something\u2014thorn or bite. She looked lost. Pissed. Stood up by a date pissed.\nThen, her expression changed from lost-and-angry to startled. Then frightened. She looked around and for an instant her eyes seemed to meet Tahira\u2019s. Accusingly.\nLike an antelope, she turned and bolted, running through the grass and thorns. One of the sandals flew off, a twinkle of motion on the screen.\n\u201cDon\u2019t run.\u201d Tahira said out loud.\nIn the holo field the girl kept running and in a second vanished from the eye\u2019s sweep.\nTahira found herself standing. Muttered a curse. She skimmed to the next eye, which should have picked up the girl\u2019s panicked flight and probably the kill, since it covered that sector.\nIt showed her grass, scrub, the scurry of a small rodent, the silent float of an owl. The small dying shriek of the rodent made her flinch, then she skimmed back through that eye\u2019s sequence.\nNothing. She slowed the segment, watched the owl creep across the scene. Frowned. Seed heads bowed the grass. This species had finished seeding weeks ago and the seed heads had shattered, spilling their ripe seeds.\nShe copied and filed both sequences and had the station AI code them for search identification. Then she set the AI searching the Preserve\u2019s security base for an exact match to the quiet scene recorded by the second eye. Within a minute, a 99% match popped up in her holo field. Side by side, two owls floated and twin shrieks split the quiet. She checked the properties. Yep. The scene had been recorded five weeks ago, on a quiet night with . . . she checked . . . no Security alerts, not even a native antelope bumping the Perimeter fence.\nFor several moments, she frowned at the now-frozen images, then blanked them. This time, she directed her AI to match the visual image of the girl running, but she directed it to search the web, excluding only the Preserve data files.\nThat search was going to take some time.\nWith a sigh, she emailed the video of the girl and the twin owl sequences to her boss, then reached into the holo field to touch the angry, blinking priority icon.\nIt took five full minutes for Carlo to appear. Which meant he was probably in bed. With someone. He had just spent a week at a body-spa and he was probably trying out the upgrades. Tahira braced herself as Carlo\u2019s face and torso appeared in the field, yes, wrapped in a silken robe, his usually-perfect hair tousled. \u201cAbout time.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhere were you? I called you as soon as I got your report but your link didn\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\u201cChecking the range.\u201d\n\u201cYou have software to do that.\u201d\n\u201cThe software didn\u2019t find her. I did.\u201d\n\u201cHas the media gotten hold of this?\u201d Carlo looked over his shoulder, back to her, lowered his voice. \u201cI assume not, or my interface would have picked it up and alerted me.\u201d His dark eyes snapped. \u201cAll right. This time, you need to find out how the trespasser got in. And why Security failed to alert you. Again. Meanwhile, you will euthanize the lions involved. As insurance against media clamor. We will have done all we could do.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the lions\u2019 fault.\u201d Tahira shook her head. \u201cThe girl was meant to run into them. She was dropped right in front of them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean she was dropped?\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cMake sense, Tahira, will you?\u201d\n\u201cShe was dropped.\u201d Tahira bit the words off. \u201cBy a skimmer, helicopter. Something. She was in sandals. Bedroom type. I just emailed you the Security clip that did pick her up. And the clip that was used to replace most of the visuals.\u201d\nHe stared at her. \u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d He chopped her words aside with the flat of his hand. \u201cDo you know how much it would cost to do that kind of hack job? Worry about the Perimeter security. Something is down. The lion euthanasia shows the public that we\u2019re doing a good job of dealing with this. The US media will howl if they get hold of this. You know how they feel about the Preserve.\u201d\nYes, she knew.\n\u201cI can sacrifice you or I can sacrifice a lion or two. You decide, Tahira.\u201d Carlo\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd before you say anything, you\u2019re a hell of a lot more valuable to me than the lions, they\u2019re breeding just fine. Besides, as soon as the genetics geeks get their Panthera leo atrox phenotype we won\u2019t use African lions anymore anyway. So let\u2019s just call it moot and drop it.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder again and his mouth tightened briefly. Turned back to Tahira. \u201cI am ordering you to euthanize a lion that killed this person. Make sure you get a DNA match so we can prove it, and I\u2019ll leave it to you to get the right one. I\u2019ll let you claim it was a rogue animal and make it plausible.\u201d\nHe was giving her a lot. Carlo could have demanded the whole pride\u2014the media would press for it. He could have fired her. \u201cCan we talk about how this girl got in here? She was a girl, Carlo. Dressed for a hot date. Go take a look at that clip I sent you. She did not hike in from the Perimeter. I think that\u2019s a bit more important than pleasing the media.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Carlo cut her off with another chop of his aristocratic hand. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, nobody will pick it up. Make sure you secure those video files. The administrative contract for the Preserve comes up for renewal in one month. The US will push hard to take it over, as usual. If you want a job a month from now, you\u2019d better hope the World Council thinks we\u2019re doing a good job here and doesn\u2019t award the contract somewhere else.\u201d The holo field blanked.\nTahira stared into the opalescent shimmer.\nHe was right. The vast Preserve, the huge central section of the US that had been restored to its Pleistocene ecology, including megafauna and the species that had inhabited this land millions of years ago, was part of a giant experiment in ecological climate control. And genetic engineering. And a huge tourist draw, which the US did like. A lot of countries were uneasy about it, seeing a threat to their own grasslands and dwindling wildlands as the growing Gaiist movement used carbon credit leverage to pressure for more preservation. Too much media outcry and the US might garner enough support to end the Preserve and take over control of the huge area again, never mind the carbon credits they\u2019d then owe. It was a matter of national pride, she thought sourly. That had always transcended logic.\nShe made herself a pot of very black tea and began to go through the security records for the past twenty-four hours, searching for human-sized mass or any sign of a small-craft landing. As the sun cleared the horizon, she finally shut down her station and stumbled off to her small room behind the water-wall, sprawling sweaty and fully clothed across her bed.\nNo airspace invasion, no vehicles, nobody on foot. Maybe the girl had teleported in. She laughed sourly. Sure.\nJust like the last one.\n\u201cTahira? Hey, Tahira, are you okay?\u201d\nJen\u2019s voice. Tahira blinked crusted eyes, swimming up from a deep pool of sleep and dreams she couldn\u2019t remember but that had stalked her like lions. \u201cLate night.\u201d She realized that she had spoken in Sotho, switched to English. \u201cSorry. I just need some tea.\u201d She sat up, stiff and sticky in her dirty clothes, rubbed her eyes.\n\u201cI already made you some.\u201d Jen stood in the doorway, nervous, a mug in one hand. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t hear me come in I figured you really needed tea.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d Tahira got up, glad that she hadn\u2019t stripped last night and took the mug. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d She gave him a smile because this too-earnest graduate student had tried to climb into her bed a week ago, never mind the age difference. And her \u2018no thanks\u2019 had apparently bruised him. She swallowed a stinging gulp of the strong-enough tea, gave Jen a nod of approval. Usually, he made it too weak.\n\u201cYou got official mail.\u201d Jen stood just outside the door, as if a strand of Perimeter fencing blocked it, his beaded and braided, silver-white hair\u2014stark contrast to his tawny skin and intended to be sexy\u2014swinging forward around his face with his nod. \u201cSecurity seal. Looks important.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Tahira drank more tea. The official execution orders. \u201cWe had another trespasser last night.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d Jen\u2019s eyes got round. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Another . . . another kill? What are we going to do about it?\u201d\nShe brushed past him, angry because two plus two was a simple equation. But guilt stabbed her. He had brought strong tea. And he didn\u2019t really understand the Preserve politics. She paused, looked back and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll have to kill one of the lions of course. Even though it wasn\u2019t really their fault.\u201d\nThe information didn\u2019t move him, but why should it? He was a graduate student, studying the symbiosis of lions and one of the predatory wasp species. Esoteric stuff. A study that provided a comfortable living and yielded information. Lions were just the food providers for his wasps, who laid their eggs in the larvae of a biting fly that pestered the lions. And the wasps were just a day job, a means to an income. He\u2019d study whatever he was paid to study. She sighed. \u201cCome have some breakfast with me, eh? I found a fresh guinea hen nest yesterday.\u201d\nShe softboiled the small, tan eggs and they ate them together as she listened to him prattle on about his wasp collecting, larvae counts, population fluctuations. When he left on his skimmer, with his collecting nets, sample bags, and a stunner, Tahira stripped and scrubbed herself clean of last night\u2019s sweat and the smell of violent death. She stripped the bed, tossed the dirty sheets into the sonic cleaner, and padded barefoot, in a clean shift, to the lab refrigerator where she had stored the trespasser\u2019s bones. The bag containing the black shirt lay on the floor beside the refrigerator. She picked it up, smoothed out the torn and blood-stiffened fabric within its plastic shroud. Why did you come here? She spoke silently to the girl\u2019s spirit. The lioness\u2019s killing was innocent. My killing of the lioness will not be innocent and it will be my burden not yours. Anger burned through her. \u201cYour death was not innocent,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cYou brought it with you and left it like poison on innocent ground.\u201d\nBut her own words sounded hollow and that image nagged at her . . . the \u2018where\u2019s my date?\u2019 body language, that single, decorative sandal tumbling through the air, bright against the stark night-vision landscape. Dropping the shirt, she took out the bag with the vertebrae and hair and got to work.\nThe first thing she did was file a full report to the local Sheriff\u2019s Department. That meant the media would have the news within the hour. The Sheriff\u2019s security leaked like a sieve. Next, she started the DNA scan. She was only required to run a minimal ID scan, but she did a full analysis. The longer she spent on this easily-rationalized task, the longer she could put off the euthanasia. By noon, her back ached from standing and the building\u2019s major-domo announced Deputy Malthers. Shawn. He always handled Preserve issues. She sent the data to her personal workspace and shut down the lab, retreating into the main room and the cool breath of water-wall. \u201cCome in.\u201d She admitted him and he sighed in the cool air, removing his hat, half moons of sweat darkening the tan sun-cloth of his uniform.\n\u201cTahira.\u201d He nodded, his weathered face closed and cautious. \u201cYou had an intruder, huh?\u201d Another one, his eyes accused. \u201cSupposedly your fence is tight. Do I have to worry about lions in the hotel lobbies?\u201d\n\u201cYou know you don\u2019t, Shawn.\u201d Tahira studied the tight lines around his eyes. \u201cThe Perimeter isn\u2019t porous\u2014to animals. Who chewed on you?\u201d\n\u201cMy boss, the Sheriff. The governor chewed on him.\u201d He sighed and tossed his hat onto the corner of the table. \u201cHe\u2019s getting more pressure from the Take Back America people. They got the news even before the media could post it on the net. Can I have a glass of water?\u201d He gave her a plaintive look. \u201cI know you run a tight ship, Tahira, but jeeze, two deaths in two months? This is too good for the media to pass up. You should see the hit rates.\u201d\n\u201cSit down. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She headed for the kitchen. \u201cI didn\u2019t get much sleep. Did you get the DNA scan I sent your office?\u201d She carried two full glasses and a pitcher of water back, set the tray on the low table near her work field.\n\u201cYeah. No match.\u201d He took a glass, drank half of it in long, gulping swallows. Wiped his mouth on his sleeve. \u201cShe\u2019s not a missing person. I sent it to the national DNA database, but you know how long that takes.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a six month backlog and that\u2019s just on violent crime. I still haven\u2019t heard back on our first Jane Doe.\u201d\nAt least he had said \u2018our\u2019, although technically, the Preserve was administered by the World Council and not under local jurisdiction. Still, the World Council liked to let local law deal with matters if at all possible. Tahira sat down on her cushion. The holo field shimmered to life and she opened the data file, staring thoughtfully as the letters, numbers, and icons winked like emerging stars.\n\u201cI know her.\u201d She spoke to the galaxy of numbers and icons\u2014the translation of those rags of flesh and bits of bone. \u201cShe grew up in a slum.\u201d The heavy metal load in her hair could only belong to a child of the unclensed suburban wasteland. \u201cShe was very young, less than sixteen, I am guessing. European, probably Scotch-Irish, no Asian or African genes, minimum melanin.\u201d Her skin would have been very fair and the red in her hair was natural beneath its cheap dye. Poor all her life, considering the uncorrected genetic predisposition to cholesterol and cancer. She would not have had an uncomplicated middle age, if she had lived. She would have died young, relatively speaking. Unless she earned the money for genetic repair. \u201cLook at this.\u201d She called up the security clip, ran it. Listened to Malthers\u2019 soft indrawn breath.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t expect lions.\u201d His face was grim. \u201cAnd she sure didn\u2019t get lost from one of your tours, huh?\u201d\n\u201cNobody gets lost from our tours.\u201d Tahira shook her head. \u201cAnd no, she did not expect lions.\u201d\n\u201cYou got any ideas?\u201d\n\u201cThis cost a lot of money.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cHacking our security. It would be expensive. We do not use cheap security.\u201d\nHe was looking at her quizzically, his thick brows drawn down over those so very blue eyes.\n\u201cSome things,\u201d she said slowly, remembering, \u201cdon\u2019t change.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\nHer link chimed. \u201cI have a tour scheduled.\u201d She stood, feeling age in her bones, even though they worked perfectly, levering her young-muscled body erect. As if invisible teleomeres were shortening, ticking like a clock. \u201cI have to go. If I find anything out, I will email you.\u201d\nHe headed for the door, paused to look back. \u201cStop by the office.\u201d Those so blue eyes fixed on her face. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a beer.\u201d The door closed behind him, breathing hot dust into the room.\nThe tour was an expensive one, which was why she had to lead it. It would be a package with a hotel, maybe a body spa, the Preserve and a tour conducted personally by the Manager. That was her. Her contract specified how many of these she had to do each month. Originally, Carlo had suggested she wear native dress. When she had told him that would be a ragged T-shirt with the name of a football team on it, he had shut up and not mentioned it again. The tourists were waiting beside their air-conditioned tour bus, looking around at the dusty little compound, pointing their links at the buildings, the guinea hens scratching in the shade. The link videoed the image and instantly searched the web for a match, downloading informational links. The life cycle of the guinea hen, the history of the Preserve, the blueprints for the buildings, if you wanted to look at them. Their tour guide spotted her and said something. Instantly they all, nearly in unison, pointed their links at her.\nA part of her wanted to duck, as if they were pointing weapons. The gesture was, her hindbrain told her, the same. Was it, she wondered briefly, that this pointing of links to acquire information was a hostile act? Or was it that the men who had fired on the refugees when she was a child hadn\u2019t been hostile, had treated the dealing of death as casually as these tourists treated the gathering of information? She didn\u2019t know, hid her flinch and smiled for them as the guide did the introduction that they weren\u2019t listening to. Their eyes were on their links as she downloaded onto their screens life and death, love and loss, success and failure, rendered in text and images. She climbed onto the bus after them, took the plush seat up front, facing them. The guide sat beside her in the other rear-facing seat. Some of the tourists were from off-planet, perhaps one of the orbital platforms or perhaps even Mars. They had brown skin, lighter than her Lesotho skin, but their bodies seemed frail, out of proportion. They looked at her, eyes bright.\nThey did not look quite human.\n\u201cGo straight out of the compound and take the first right,\u201d she told the driver, who was a regular. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the road down along the river.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to see the Mastodon calves.\u201d One of the off-planet tourists looked up from her link. \u201cThe park map IDs them to the west, over in the hills.\u201d\n\u201cThe old cow always brings them down to their favorite place on the river at dusk, to drink.\u201d Tahira spoke patiently. \u201cYou\u2019ll have time to stretch your legs and have some dinner before they show up.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go where they are?\u201d Someone else spoke up.\n\u201cOur rhythms are more flexible than those of the animals.\u201d She kept her voice patient. \u201cThey know we will be there at the river, we are usually there, that does not bother them. It is familiar. If we arrive unexpectedly in an unusual place . . . they will be bothered. And that is unhealthy.\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t satisfy all of them but she didn\u2019t expect it to.\n\u201cHey.\u201d A woman with a very young face, golden skin, and hair as silvery white as Jen looked up from her screen. \u201cI just got a newsfeed . . . a tourist got killed by a lion! Last night! This is the second lion kill!\u201d\nMurmurs swept the bus and all eyes focused on the link screens.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tourist.\u201d Her words fell like stones into the murmur and eyes pried themselves from link screens. \u201cA young woman was dropped from a hovercraft for the lions to find.\u201d She spoke into silence now. All eyes were on her and somehow, this felt no different than the pointed links. \u201cShe was intended to die. Someone videoed her death. That person will sell the video for a lot of money. Violent death is very valuable. It is an ugly trade.\u201d Only the purr of the bus\u2019s power plant could be heard now. \u201cBut it is a very old trade. No matter. I saw the vehicle that brought her, I saw the person who operated it. I observe that lion pride every night and I was there in the darkness. He will be caught.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not on the newsfeed.\u201d The accusatory voice came from the rear of the bus. From one of the off-worlders. Tahira shrugged. \u201cI did not tell the media this. But you are safe.\u201d Her smile was genuine this time. \u201cThe lion pride does not water where we will be. This is not their territory.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t sure if they were relieved or disappointed. She cut off their questions by launching into her usual lecture, pointing out the changing ecosystem\u2014it had not reached full climax equilibrium yet\u2014directing their links to the coy-dog family holed up in the shade, waiting the cool of evening. The puppies were playing a game of tug with a scrap of dirty hide and links bristled, zooming in to record. The larger animals were all chipped so the links would offer up the ID information for each animal, their stage of development toward the Pleistocene ideal as the engineers evolved them into their own ancestors.\nVoyeurs, she thought as they pointed and murmured. An observable reality, but not personal. Not threatening.\nShe politely refused to say any more about the death, telling them only that the authorities would handle it. The tourists were distracted by the smaller horse herd. One of the young stallions had been challenging the herd sire over the past few weeks and he chose this day to take his challenge to a new level. Dust rose in tan clouds as the two horses circled and feinted, ears flat, striking snake-like for a bite, whirling to kick. This time, the youngster wasn\u2019t backing down and the two stallions rose, chest to chest, teeth bared. \u201cThese horses are very much like the Equus verae, the horses that grazed this plane a million years ago. If you\u2019ll put on your glasses, you\u2019ll be able to identify the young male.\u201d She paused while the tourists all fumbled for the glasses they\u2019d been given at the start. They were slaved to hers. She IDed the young male by chip number and a green halo instantly surrounded him. \u201cThis young stallion was foaled four years ago in the spring. The engineers believe that he is a good likeness of the original Equus verae. All the stock began with Przewalksi\u2019s Horse, the last truly wild horse species.\u201d They were all watching now, as the stallions shouldered and circled, wheeling to kick, or rearing to feint and bite at each other\u2019s faces. Tahira stifled a sigh. \u201cThe herd sire is nearly ten years old. That\u2019s a long life for a herd sire.\u201d The young challenger had been born of artificial insemination with the new, improved genes. If the old herd sire didn\u2019t get ousted soon, she\u2019d have to help a new challenger along. \u201cThis is not reality,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt is our version of reality.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d One of the off-worlders had moved to the front of the bus for a better look, was pointing his link at the fight, recording.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI was just talking to myself.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so . . . uncontrolled.\u201d He had friendly dark eyes and a wide smile that made his too-fragile body seem less different. \u201cHard to imagine living in a world this . . . chaotic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not chaotic,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOnly humans are chaotic.\u201d\nThe horses saved her from the questions surfacing in his eyes. The young stallion whirled as the herd sire struck and his heels caught the herd sire full in the face. They heard the thud of hoof on bone, even at this distance, and the sire went down in a cloud of dust. He struggled instantly to his feet, but his jaw looked twisted and blood darkened the dun hide. A low murmur of horror washed through the bus.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d The white-haired woman\u2019s voice rose over the babble. \u201cWhat will happen now?\u201d\n\u201cThis was an accident. Fights like this rarely result in serious injury.\u201d Tahira blocked the tourist glasses, but had her own zoom in on the injured stallion. No point in showing them the bloody details up close. The youngster had run him a few meters from the mares and now trotted back and forth, tossing his head, tail erect as the ousted sire stood with head drooping. She winced at the white gleam of either bone or teeth visible in the bloody mess of his face. Violence seemed to be gathering over the Preserve like a dark cloud. \u201cHis jaw is broken.\u201d She didn\u2019t need the text diagnosis scrolling across the visual field. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to eat. The lions will probably kill him, or even the wild dogs. This coy-dog is heavier than the old North American coyotes and they hunt in small packs. They occasionally kill large prey species, mostly when the animal is weak or crippled.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do something about it?\u201d A woman spoke up, her voice shrill.\n\u201cYou could take him in and heal him, right?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what will the lions eat tonight?\u201d Tahira faced the woman, watched horror and anger ripple across her features. \u201cThese are not our rules. They are much older than us,\u201d she said gently. \u201cThat is what the Preserve is all about . . . returning to the old rules. Without the horse, a lion cub may die because of insufficient nutrition.\u201d She waited for the horrified comments to ebb. You could hear the excitement beneath the horror. Now they had a prize in the video files they\u2019d just uploaded to their personal space\u2014something to show proudly to friends, so they could commiserate over that raw moment of blood, and pain, and imminent death. The woman who had spoken up wasn\u2019t satisfied. She was talking about cruelty and emails to powerful people.\n\u201cDid you make this happen for us?\u201d The off-worlder was looking at her, and his eyes were shocked and cold.\n\u201cNo.\u201d She met those eyes, saw her own reflection in them, tiny and perfect. \u201cBut I knew the old stallion would be forced out sooner or later. The horses decided to make it happen now. The kick was a freak accident. Horses are good at dodging.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t believe her. You cannot conceive of no control, she thought. And wondered suddenly if her daughter had gone off-planet. The Council Security Forces were everywhere. She had never thought of that before, and it chilled her, she was not quite sure why. She would be much older than this man, now.\nThey moved on and the tour guide, a seasoned professional, texted her a request to show them something to change the now-soured mood. She had anticipated this and had already called up her inventory. \u201cTurn left just past that clump of willow . . . yes, there.\u201d\nThe bus took the dirt track easily, it\u2019s off-road suspension barely sloshing the drinks that the attendant was handing out. \u201cThe engineers have had excellent success with the long-horned bison. They are very like the bison that grazed this plain during the Pleistocene. Three cows have calved this month and the latest was last night. She scanned for the IDs, found the three cows in close proximity 200 meters from the road. \u201cThey\u2019re out in the grass, so we can watch them without disturbing them. If you\u2019ll look through the left windows and follow the arrow directions on your glasses, they\u2019ll direct you to the calves.\u201d A green arrow winked on her glasses, pointing to the right and as she turned her head, it was replaced by one pointing straight up. She lifted her head, and there, in the distance, she spied the small black dots that were the grazing bison. The bus had come to a halt. \u201cHave you all found the bison?\u201d She waited while the slow ones fumbled their way to the bison herd. Zoom while they were panning and they\u2019d get sick every time. \u201cOkay, here we go.\u201d The field blurred and suddenly seemed to be rushing toward her. The tiny specks enlarged, became a dozen shaggy brown beasts with their noses in the sun-burned grass, backs dotted with cowbirds. Small white herons stalked among them, snatching up beetles and the occasional rodent stirred up by the bison\u2019s hooves. Their long horns gleamed in the sun as they tossed their heads at flies.\nThe newborn calf hugged his mother\u2019s flank, his horns mere bumps. He suddenly butted beneath her flank, tail wriggling as he nursed. The collective sigh from the tourists made the guide breathe his own sigh of relief, she noted. Well, upset guests would hardly give him a fat tip. She let them watch the two older calves butt heads and the herd even obliged by grazing closer to the bus. By the time they moved on to the elephant watching spot for cocktails and their gourmet dinner, the mood was festive once more, the injured stallion forgotten.\nTomorrow, she would go check on him. Assure herself that the predators had found him. Injured as he was, the dog pack that patrolled that territory would almost certainly take him, but perhaps not right away. She called up that sector, scanned the predator inventory. To her relief, the lions were headed in that direction. They should get to him quickly.\nDuring dinner they lucked out and a scimitar cat\u2014quite shy and a rare sighting\u2014chose that night to come down to the river to drink. The tourists flocked to the windows, their links pointing as they videoed in night mode. The elephants showed on time and the new Mammoth type calf went so far as to walk nearly up to the bus, trunk lifted in curiosity, before his mother shooed him nervously away, and stomped a threat toward them, her ears erect, trunk curled back like a cobra.\nThe tour guide looked pleased, as if Tahira had orchestrated the whole show. Tahira sat back in her seat as they returned to the compound in the gathering darkness, answering questions, giving small lectures on the history of the Preserve, the geneticists\u2019 work, the effect of the huge preserve areas on climate stability. They asked occasional questions about the injured stallion.\nNo one brought up the dead girl. Not one.\nShe climbed down from the bus into the cooling night beneath the white arch of the Milky Way and a sliver of new moon. They would go back to the comfort of the resort to have dessert and drinks and to compare video clips. The tour guide gave her a wide grin and a wave as the door closed, anticipating good tips, obviously.\nJen would have left for the day and she would have the place to herself.\nYou have a visitor, the door murmured as she reached the verandah. He had an official security pass to enter. His personal ID is blocked. \u201cI know who it is.\u201d She sighed, then straightened her shoulders. \u201cOpen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on, Tahira?\u201d Detective Malthers levered himself up from the sofa in the main room. \u201cDo you know just how much trouble you\u2019re going to cause me when my boss starts getting the feeds?\u201d\n\u201cHe has his link shut off tonight? I would have thought he\u2019d have the news already.\u201d She headed for the kitchen wall, thirsty. \u201cAnd if I protest your use of a security pass to override my door lock, I hope you can produce the warrant.\u201d She closed her eyes as he seized her arm. Halted. \u201cShawn . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cSorry?\u201d He spun her around to face him, his face pale. \u201cYou withheld information from me? You lied to me about that girl\u2019s death? And then you spill it to a bunch of tourists?\u201d His nostrils were pinched. \u201cYou\u2019d damn well better be sorry.\u201d\nSome of them had certainly blogged from the bus. She had counted on that. She met his eyes. \u201cI did not lie to you.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you tell them . . . \u201d His eyes narrowed and he let go of her arm. \u201cNo way. No way you do that.\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d She widened her eyes. \u201cIf I tell a story to tourists to enliven their trip and they exaggerate it in their personal blogs, this is not a crime. Your boss can deny whatever he wishes to deny and if the outcry is loud enough, my boss will probably fire me. Would you like some water?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to do?\u201d His voice was harsh.\n\u201cGo to bed.\u201d She filled a glass from the refrigerator tap, filled a second glass.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get a warrant for your arrest.\u201d He ignored the proffered glass.\n\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d She raised an eyebrow. \u201cI suspect your boss will not agree with you. It will be hard enough to deal with the media when they get hold of the tourists\u2019 mistaken statements. It will be much worse if you have arrested the manager of the Preserve and then have to release her. Your boss is very conscious of his media image.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m staying here tonight.\u201d He glared at her.\n\u201cBe my guest.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d He stretched out on the sofa, his jaw set.\nShe turned her back on him and activated her holo-field. Checked the Preserve first. Minor Perimeter alerts only\u2014a couple of licensed backcountry backpackers who had retreated when they triggered the broadcast security announcement, a small herd of pronghorn that moved off when the repulsion field activated, broadcasting an unpleasant sonic pulse that discouraged most wildlife and the occasional lost livestock. Nothing else. Red icons signaled stationary chips\u2014indicating that a bearer hadn\u2019t moved for twelve hours. That usually represented death or serious injury. She checked the IDs . . . all prey species except for one elephant from the northernmost herd. An old female, but not so old that she should be dying yet. The elephants and the larger predators had been implanted with biometric chips. Tahira checked it, found signs of physical distress, but no clear diagnosis. She transferred the ID to her link. She\u2019d fly over in the morning and check on it, on her rounds to chip new births. See what had happened.\nHer AI search of the Security video of the running girl had turned up a match. Eighty-nine percent. Tahira drew a deep breath, touched the green icon. A merchant site. Models? A naked woman lounged suggestively on a grizzly\u2019s hide, caressing the dead, snarling face, tongue-tip peeking pink from lush, crimson lips. The secure interface requested a user ID and password. And a credit card. The entry fee made her purse her lips. She flagged the link, emailed it.\nMalthers was peering at his link, his feet propped on the arm of the sofa. He looked up as she shut down her field. \u201cWhat if the person who dropped her was a woman?\u201d His eyes were hard.\nShe shrugged. \u201cYou are too tall for that sofa. Would you like me to inflate the guest bed?\u201d\n\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d He went back to his link. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cWhile you are up, then, maybe you can see what\u2019s for sale on the video sex markets. I just sent you a link that you might . . . find interesting. I don\u2019t have the budget to access it.\u201d She turned and went into her room. When she woke briefly in the middle of the night, the light in the main room was still on and he was sitting on the sofa, hunched over his link.\nShe slept without dreaming, after that, and when she woke, he was gone.\nThe door seal sighed as it released and Jen strode in, bringing a smell of hot noontime dust and heat, a hint of lion and sex. \u201cHey, how was your tour last night? Did they do a fancy spread?\u201d He came up behind her, dropped his collecting bag onto the tiles with a small thump. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the reporters outside? The newsfeeds were full of the killing this morning. You were a witness? To the girl\u2019s death?\u201d His sandy brows arched over his pale eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d\n\u201cI know I didn\u2019t.\u201d Tahira waved her hand through the field and the numbers and icons, the map of this girl\u2019s history written in molecules, winked out. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it, okay?\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t opened your secure email from the boss yet.\u201d\n\u201cI know what it says.\u201d She sighed.\n\u201cTahira . . . \u201d His hands came to rest lightly on her shoulders. \u201cI work with the lions, too. I can do this euthanasia for you. You don\u2019t have to. Just give me the chip ID.\u201d\nHis hands offered comfort not sex. She let her shoulders relax a bit beneath the warmth and acknowledged the small heat of desire between her legs. He was very pretty. He would try hard to please her in bed. Her shiver of anticipation made her . . . sad. She was old enough to be his grandmother. The flesh had its own morality. She sighed, and his hands slid from her shoulders as she rose. \u201cI appreciate your offer.\u201d She smiled for him. \u201cBut it is my duty. It is my failing that the girl was able to be here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d He shook his head, frowning. \u201cShe bought hackware good enough to get through the Perimeter sensors. It\u2019s happened before. Remember those rich kids that came in here with a rifle? Right after I started working here? The ones who thought they were going to kill an elephant? That\u2019s not your responsibility\u2014that\u2019s the responsibility of the company that contracts security to the Preserve.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened.\u201d Tahira blanked the icons with a wave of her hand. \u201cThis is not like those teenage poachers with their utterly inadequate rifles. I knew they were there.\u201d\n\u201cSo her hackware was better, that\u2019s all.\u201d Jen shrugged. \u201cCome on, Tahira. Nobody is blaming you . . . except you.\u201d\n\u201cI doubt that is true.\u201d She turned to meet his pale eyes. \u201cHer mother? A lover? Who is mourning her? She was a girl, Jen, even if nobody claimed her as missing. The poor don\u2019t bother. You know that no one will really look. You know where they have gone.\u201d She turned away from the blue incomprehension of his eyes. \u201cBut they are blaming me. Besides, she was not rich enough to afford that level of hackware.\u201d\nHe shook his head and heaved a sigh for her to hear. She ignored it as she ran through the surveillance program, suppressing a twinge of guilt because she hadn\u2019t yet checked on the stationary elephant cow. Everything was fine, although the main horse herd was pushing into the grazing territory of the old mare\u2019s small, splinter herd. This was a dry year and the grass was poor. She\u2019d have to let them get pushed off their riverside pasture. That would weaken this year\u2019s crop of still-nursing foals, and increase the kill rate by the northern pride. If another dry spring followed, she thought, the small herd would probably end up being absorbed back into the larger group. The old mare wouldn\u2019t survive that merger.\nThe guide reports were routine. No problems, no accidents on any of the daily motorized tours currently winding through the Preserve and only a sprained ankle from one of the self-guided backpacking treks that were in progress. The hiker had been handled by a contracted first aid skimmer and planned to continue the trek in an augmented cast, having signed a health waiver. Tahira checked the location of the various lion prides and elephant groups to make sure that the guides would provide visual contact for the guests. Four were lion treks and one was an elephant trek. But all their guides were experienced and they could find the chip signatures with their own software. They were all on target to give the paying hikers the thrill of a live sighting. Routine day. She retinaed the report, packed a few necessary items into her field bag, then left Jen to his microscope and took the skimmer out into the Preserve.\nShawn had not gotten his warrant, but then she had known he would fail.\nShe swung north, to check up on the stationary elephant before she started her chip work. It was a long flight, clear to the northwestern boundary of the Preserve, within sight of the monorail. The old cow was down after all, on her side in the shade of a thin copse of trees. She raised her head as Tahira skimmed over, ears erect, trunk curled as she got her forefeet under her, tried to heave herself to her feet. Two aunties had stayed with her and as she collapsed into the dust once more, they hurried up, stroking her with their trunks, watching Tahira warily as she landed the skimmer and approached cautiously. The dust beneath the old cow\u2019s hindquarters had turned to mud from her urine. No sign of defecation. A blockage? Perhaps she had eaten something that damaged her gastrointestinal system. Her temperature was slightly elevated and when Tahira zoomed in with her glasses, sure enough the cow\u2019s membranes looked pale. No sign of any external trauma. Natural causes. She selected the diagnosis, uploaded visuals to the cow\u2019s file, and set it to alert her when vitals fell to imminent death levels. She would return to make a more complete diagnosis then. For the record.\nShe caught a glimpse of movement from the corner of her eye as she removed her glasses. Bear? Sure enough, when she slipped them back on, a green ring haloed the bushes where she had seen the movement and the ID appeared. One of the short-faced bears, another of the engineers\u2019 triumphant recreations. They were drawn by death. One of the aunties blew noisily and rushed the bushes, trunk high. The bear retreated, growling, circled around to windward. Tahira retreated to her skimmer, although the bear was focused on the dying cow. Unlikely that the aunties would allow it to hasten the old cow\u2019s end.\nNatural causes, she thought as she lifted to swing eastward again. You could label the girl\u2019s death as natural causes. To the lions it had been a natural end. The monorail was curving along the white arch of track on its first run of the morning. In a few moments the tourists would surely spot the cow and the questions would start pouring into Admin from the passengers. All the tourist monorails carried a direct link to Preserve Administration. Tahira set the skimmer on auto, homing on the ID of the bison herd she needed to chip, and quickly edited out an image of the cow and her aunties from the old cow\u2019s ID file. She selected one of her taken in the past, with her last calf, set her link to record and smiled for the tourists. Quickly, in a warm and positive tone, she explained the situation, that the cow was dying of natural causes, the aunties were attending her, and that this (insert mother and calf image here) was part of the natural cycle of life and death, that the old cow\u2019s flesh would nourish wild dog cubs (she called up a file, inserted a recent shot of three pups playing) and the scavenger population. She uploaded the video file to Administration and texted Amy Shen, the head of PR, to expect questions about the dying cow and offer this Special Message from the Manager. Amy would run the file through her editing software to smooth out any rough edges and in a few minutes, when the worried texts came in, the tourists would have her reassuring explanation.\nMaybe she should have made one for the dead girl? Tahira kicked the skimmer to full speed, ducked down behind the wind screen as they streaked across the foothills of the mountains.\nIt took her the rest of the day to chip the bison calves and stalk a litter of wild dog pups old enough for chips. Half grown, they were skittish, full of hormones and already squabbling with the ranking alphas. But she finally got good shots, and planted a chip in a solid muscle mass. The new ID files opened and she recorded the pertinent data. Now the pups and the calves were part of the database. Their deaths would have meaning, value, would contribute to the slowly growing mass of information about this stable environment.\nWhat had the girl\u2019s death contributed?\nA meal for the lions, she thought. At a price.\nIt was getting dark. She texted Jen that she was going to stay out and check on the lion pride before she came in. Told him to go home, activate Security when he left, she\u2019d see him tomorrow. She knew where the pride would be, didn\u2019t need to check her link. It was too early yet for them to head down to the river. She grounded the skimmer, ate an energy bar from her bag, drank some water, and used her link to access the Preserve database and check on the animals.\nNothing out of the ordinary. No Security alerts, nothing but the normal rhythms of day ending and night beginning. Shift change, she thought as she stuffed the wrapper into her pocket and capped her water bottle. Time. It was fully dark now, the Milky Way a white shimmer across the star spangled sky. She stared up at it. Different sky than the one over the refugee camp. Maybe it wasn\u2019t, but it looked different. She frowned, bothered suddenly that she didn\u2019t know if the constellations had been the same in that girlhood sky, or if memory had warped the images in her mind. It bothered her a lot. Frowning she lifted the skimmer, donned her glasses set to night-vision, and went looking for the lion pride. She flew low, skimming above the brush, weaving around the trees. Someone watching for her might think she was checking on the wildlife, scanning chips. She dipped south so that she\u2019d meet the pride on their way down to the river.\nRed blossomed at the top of her glasses\u2019 heads-up visual field. Perimeter violation? Tahira\u2019s stomach clenched. Why an alert this time? She crouched behind the windscreen as she dropped lower, weaving through the tops of the trees. A map flashed into existence now, red dots marking the path of the intruder as he activated the sensors scattered across the Preserve. Tahira watched another red icon blossom on the screen map. He was heading for the place where the girl had died and the steady progress suggested that he wasn\u2019t trying very hard to hide and certainly wasn\u2019t using hackware.\nNo. This was just some fool who chose tonight to violate the Perimeter. An idiot. A thrill seeker. Furious she circled south to come in straight behind the intruder, slowed the skimmer to its limit, weaving through the brush now, twigs whispering against the skimmer\u2019s flanks, clawing at her legs. She was briefly thankful for her tough, suncloth pants that resisted the thorns. She followed the trespasser\u2019s path on her map. He should be about a hundred yards ahead, almost at the site where the girl had died.\nSomething slammed into her, an invisible fist that loosened her grasp on the skimmer\u2019s nav bar and tossed her sideways out of the seat. The skimmer compensated as soon as her hand left the bar, shying sideways to stay underneath her, slowing and settling automatically. She clutched at the bar to take control again, but her right arm didn\u2019t work and before she could process that, shift to her left hand, the skimmer grounded gently. For a moment, Tahira stared at the bar, then realized that her sleeve was wet, warm liquid was dripping steadily onto her pants and the dusty ground beside the skimmer. Dark. Blood. Her head spun briefly and she swallowed dry nausea.\nWhat do you think you\u2019re going to do? She heard Shawn\u2019s furious voice in her head. Not much. She climbed off the skimmer, her knees suddenly shaky.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill you.\u201d The hard, cold voice came from the tall hawthorn scrub that edged the grassy area where the skimmer had come down. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to get in my way. You can yell for help as soon as I\u2019m done here.\u201d\n\u201cDid you bring another one to die?\u201d Tahira faced the voice. She was still wearing her glasses, but they didn\u2019t register an ID. No surprise. Anyone doing this would have had his ID chip removed long ago, would use temporary, fake chips. \u201cHow much do you get for these? And what do the girls think? That this is just another porn shoot, this time out in the dust? She didn\u2019t expect the lions.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d A figure emerged from the concealing hawthorn. Tall. Dressed in chameleon-fabric so that his silhouette was hard to make out. The projectile rifle, night-scoped, ugly, and efficient looking wasn\u2019t hard to make out at all. Something about the voice was wrong, nagged at her, but her head was full of sticky glue and she couldn\u2019t think of what it was.\n\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d The voice grated at her ears.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s making the snuff vids, recording the girls as they run into the old lioness\u2019s pride and die.\u201d She would have spat the words, but that sense of wrong was building in her head.\nThe figure stepped forward suddenly and before Tahira\u2019s gone-fuzzy reflexes could kick in, had shoved Tahira back against the skimmer, her back arched under the pressure of the trespasser\u2019s body, her good arm bent behind her. She blinked into pale gray eyes in a hard, weathered face framed by cropped-short gray-white hair. Sucked in a breath that was half pain, half surprise.\nA woman.\n\u201cShawn said it might be a she.\u201d She laughed, drunk on the pain that had begun to throb in her right shoulder and side, burning like a growing fire, radiating through her flesh.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a she. That was my daughter your lions ate. You folks don\u2019t care, but I do.\u201d Her breath blasted Tahira\u2019s face. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pay for that tonight.\u201d\n\u201cYour daughter?\u201d Tahira blinked, trying to focus her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s why your hackware is so poor? You just walked in here to shoot lions? You don\u2019t care if we catch you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care one bit.\u201d The cold pale eyes bored into hers. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t decided to hang out and protect them, I wouldn\u2019t have had to shoot you. I figured you folks trust your software instead of using your eyes. I know how tracking software works . . . It\u2019s pretty easy to fool if you know how.\u201d She laughed and the sound was like glass breaking. \u201cI was a wild-meat hunter for the black market\u2014when there was still wild meat to hunt. I know all about tracking software. Maybe the people who babble about karmic balance are right, eh?\u201d The shattered laugh came again. \u201cAfter all the animals I killed, one of them killed my daughter. But the score is going to end in my favor.\u201d\n\u201cYou fool.\u201d Tahira twisted her hand free, planted it against the woman\u2019s chest and shoved. Her strength surprised both of them and the woman stumbled back a step. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined this night. You\u2019ve ruined my chance to catch the one who killed your daughter and the girl he killed before her. You and your misguided revenge. He\u2019s not going to come back, not after he realizes people were here waiting for him. Damn you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the crap are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking any crap.\u201d Tahira closed her eyes. Game over, she thought. \u201cHow do you even know that your daughter was the girl who was killed here? We haven\u2019t identified the DNA yet.\u201d\n\u201cI found the image on the web.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice grated, harsh as stone. \u201cI was looking for her, used a video search engine, uploaded a bunch of recent pictures of her. And the engine found a match. With lions.\u201d She spat. \u201cOne of your tourists videoed it. Her running. The lions after her.\u201d She spat again. \u201cAnd you people just stood around.\u201d\n\u201cNo one stood around. I saw that video.\u201d Tahira stood still as the gun muzzle lifted, fixed on her chest.\n\u201cThe media said she sneaked in. I figured she was showing off to prove something . . . because I used to run around in the African wastelands for the meat collectors. She was such a city kid.\u201d For a moment her voice wavered. Then it went cold again. \u201cYou want to tell me your version?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t look back to check the source of that image match, did you? If you want to go check it, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a teaser for a very expensive, password-only, porn site. I think your daughter believed she was making a porn vid. Right until the end.\u201d Tahira pulled out her link, watched the gun muzzle lift and steady. Touched up the video file from the Security eye, passed it over.\nThe woman took it, poised, the gun ready. Yes, Tahira thought. She had the body language of one who expected attack. She remembered that body posture all too well. The woman stepped back, out of range, looked at the link with one eye on Tahira. Then her posture stiffened and the link held her full attention.\nI could kill her now, Tahira thought. Our children are our greatest weakness. She waited, watching the sky, straining her ears to hear any whisper of a silenced skimmer. The woman must be reviewing the clip over and over again. Finally she looked up, pocketed the link. The gun muzzle had sunk to rest on the ground and she didn\u2019t lift it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your stake in this?\u201d Her voice was steady. \u201cYou came out here to put your life on the line for a damn lion?\u201d\n\u201cNo . . . and yes.\u201d Tahira closed her eyes again, briefly, summoning the will to push the grinding pain in her shoulder down deeper inside her. \u201cThe lioness . . . the old one, the one that killed your daughter . . . was wild caught. There are no more lions to catch. These are being changed, their genes altered to make them what we want . . . the Pleistocene American Lion. The world that the lioness came from is gone. My world. Your world, too, I think.\u201d She pulled her lips back from her teeth. \u201cShe is innocent of murder the way your rifle is innocent of murder, even if you point it at me and pull the trigger. You and I . . . \u201d Her lips stretched tighter. \u201cWe are not innocent of our daughters\u2019 murders.\u201d She watched the gun muzzle jerk upward, tensed for one second as it wavered, drifted lower. \u201cMy elder daughter did what your daughter did.\u201d The entire Preserve seemed to be holding its breath. Even the insects had hushed. \u201cI knew what she was doing and pretended I did not. She had no future, there was no aid, everyone was hungry. I took the flour and oil she brought home and I did not ask where the money came from.\u201d She did not look away from the pale oval of the woman\u2019s face. \u201cThey made a video of her death. I got someone to find it for me eventually. To buy it. Her death was a commodity, for sale on the market. As is your daughter\u2019s.\u201d She waited for the gun to come up but it did not.\n\u201cMy younger daughter was six.\u201d She said the words flatly, without inflection. \u201cI sold her to the World Council Forces so that she would not have to do what her sister did. They call it sponsoring, but when you do that, you relinquish all rights to that child. Later, I paid a lot of money to find out where she was and when she was fourteen, I saw her. On a training mission, doing crowd control. She looked at me.\u201d Tahira took a deep breath. \u201cShe did not know me. By then, I had been lucky, had found a job with the North American Pleistocene Preserve and my superiors found that I was . . . talented. That was many years ago. My daughter is past middle age now.\u201d She glanced up as a tiny chime sounded from the skimmer. \u201cThat is our lioness and her pride.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cThis is a delicately balanced trap.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s too late.\u201d She sighed. \u201cHe will certainly be scanning the ground for any human-sized life signatures, in case this is the trap he expects and I have brought the police.\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t see me.\u201d The woman laughed her broken-glass laugh. \u201cIllegal technology is always a step ahead of legal. Your motion detectors saw me, but you wouldn\u2019t have picked me up on your scan.\u201d\n\u201cHe has inside help and so he might have access to our entire security network.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI do not think that is likely since only I have complete access to it, but it is possible.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case we\u2019re screwed.\u201d The woman shrugged, her expression unreadable in the dark. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\n\u201cI want him on the ground.\u201d Tahira closed her eyes as the world wavered. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m a witness and he needs to make sure I\u2019m dead. I have a first aid kit behind the seat.\u201d Cold sweat bathed her face, prickling under her arms. \u201cIt has a touch menu. Select stimulant, human, emergency, and get two patches.\u201d She struggled to hang onto consciousness, eyes closed, nausea wringing her stomach. The woman brushed against her, fumbling behind the seat. A moment later cool fingers seized her wrist, pushed her sleeve up and Tahira felt the sting of the stim patch on the inside of her elbow.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to make you bleed more.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Tahira straightened as energy washed through her, banishing the nausea, brightening the shadows. \u201cCan\u2019t be helped.\u201d She touched the first aid menu, selected one small and one medium blood-stop patch. \u201cHelp me with the shirt.\u201d She winced as the woman opened the front, pulled the fabric down over her shoulder and arm. \u201cCover the entire wound, use the small one on the entry . . . \u201d\n\u201cI know how to use a patch.\u201d\nTahira sighed as the woman smoothed the patches over the ruin of the entry and exit wounds. The fast-acting local quickly numbed the grinding pain, reduced it to a low-level throb that she could shut out for now.\n\u201cYou guys carry a hospital on these things.\u201d\n\u201cWe permit a few extreme hikers.\u201d Tahira drew a slow breath, let it out, judging the strength of the remaining pain. \u201cWe are preoccupied with death.\u201d She bared her teeth at the woman. \u201cYou sold vids of your kills along with your illegal meat, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe woman didn\u2019t answer, but of course, she did. Tahira straightened. That was the lure of what would otherwise be no different from a farm or vat raised steak. If you couldn\u2019t pull the trigger yourself, you could still watch it die. \u201cYou hide,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to move the skimmer ahead of the pride, ground it again. He\u2019s going to come down and look for me.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to drop a grenade on you and leave.\u201d The woman sounded contemptuous.\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Tahira grinned. \u201cLike you, I\u2019m wearing a chameleon field. And I also have a small device that a clever grad student hacked up\u2014it generates the thermal effect of a 150-pound antelope. He was studying night hunting, trying to determine the importance of scent, thermal detection, sound, and sight in predator species. Our killer should think it\u2019s me.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe has been very careful not to leave any traces. I suspect that if I did not patrol as regularly as I do, we would never have known that anyone was killed here.\u201d Another few hours, and only the scrap of fabric would have marked that kill site. \u201cOne of us needs to kill him.\u201d She lifted her hand. \u201cI would prefer that the lions do it.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know they can?\u201d\nTahira shrugged her good shoulder. \u201cI will make it possible. If they do not, you or I will do it.\u201d She pulled the highly illegal gun from her waistband, was impressed that the woman didn\u2019t flinch.\n\u201cYou could have shot me. While I was looking at the vid.\u201d For a moment, she was silent. \u201cI like you.\u201d Her teeth flashed briefly. \u201cYou would have made a good meat hunter.\u201d\n\u201cI think not.\u201d Tahira stretched her lips back from her teeth. \u201cBut I am not sure we are so different. You know to stay downwind from the pride? They\u2019re hunting.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cI need my link.\u201d Tahira held out her hand. The woman glanced at it, shrugged, handed it over. Tahira nodded and climbed onto the skimmer, hoping he showed before the stim patch ran out. She wasn\u2019t sure she could tolerate a second dose. At least the bleeding seemed to have stopped. Lifting, she drifted ahead of the pride, watching her enviro-panel, reading wind, calculating distance and scent drift. Set the skimmer gently down, half hidden by hawthorn scrub. Just hidden enough, she hoped, to make him think that he might have missed her last time, when he dropped the girl. The meat-hunter\u2019s daughter.\nGlancing at her watch, she planted the thick disk of the bio-signature generator in a clump of hawthorn, and hiked downwind, zooming in on the spot with her glasses. She had keyed the link to the lioness\u2019s ID, figured she had about fifteen minutes before she\u2019d need to return and move the skimmer. The lions knew her scent, so hopefully her presence wouldn\u2019t disturb their regular hunting routine.\nFive minutes left. She started to get to her feet to relieve her thigh muscles, when she caught the faintest whisper of disturbed air, like the wings of an owl. She froze, eyes fixed on the landscape beyond the grounded skimmer. A vague shape of matte black blocked her view of grass and shrubs. A military shadow field, of course.\nShe didn\u2019t see him get out of the shadowed skimmer, but of course, he would also be using a chameleon field. Sure enough, a clump of sun dried grass winked out for a moment, then reappeared. He knew where she was\u2014or where he thought she was. He was being cautious.\nShe had not prayed to any gods for a long time. Not since she had handed over her young daughter to the World Council Force sponsorship coordinator. Gods were like lions, they belonged to the old world. But now she bent her head, prayed that those old, dying gods would gather wind, scent, instinct, and make one thing right in the old way.\nHe did not fear the lions. She could see it in his preoccupied focus on the clump of brush where she had hidden the generator. They were just park amusements, useful as a movie prop, able to kill a helpless and unarmed girl. Not a threat to him. He had a gun, after all. She bared her teeth at his hubris. It would please the old gods.\nThe lioness charged in a rush of motion where no motion had existed. The man spun, hand coming up. Light flared and the lioness tumbled, regained her feet in an instant and with a leap, her front feet hit his shoulders, knocking him flat, her claws digging in to hold him. He had time for a choked cry before her jaws closed on his throat. A second lioness charged in, taking him by the thigh. Dust rose, white in her night-vision, as he thrashed, strangling slowly. The lion grunts and chesty growls were the only sound. The other members of the pride had circled in, tearing his belly open before he had quite died.\nTahira started as something moved beside her. The meat hunter squatted silently next to her, her posture intent, not speaking. A loop of intestine gleamed wetly. He had stopped struggling, had finally died. The lioness who had taken him stood up, bit at his dead shoulder and shook her head heavily. She walked a few steps away from the feeding pride, snarled as one of the males took a step toward her, lashed out at him. Her strike was weak, wobbly, and her hindquarters swayed as she staggered away from the others.\n\u201cShe\u2019s dying,\u201d Tahira said softly. \u201cHe shot her.\u201d Her eyes widened as she noticed the faint striping on the lioness\u2019s shoulders. This was not the old one. This was one of the younger animals, the ones that were beginning to resemble their Pleistocene ancestors. She pointed her link at it. Yes, this was the oldest of the younger females, the one who had been pushing the old lioness of late. As she watched the pride feeding, she spotted the old lioness, noticed that she was limping. Not much, but it had been enough to let the beta lioness take over.\nPerhaps the old mare had kicked her, when the pride had taken her foal. Tahira let her breath out slowly, pain beginning to seep through the stim\u2019s numbness. Maybe that limp would heal and the lioness would keep her rank now, maybe not. The next female in rank was timid, not likely to challenge her soon.\nShe might keep her leadership.\nFor a time.\nTahira got to her feet, feeling shaky to her bones. \u201cYou should leave now. Take his skimmer. It got him through the boundary, it will take you out. Sell it quickly. Just in case. I will erase your entry from Security.\u201d\nThe meat hunter faced her, her expression enigmatic, the years, the past, graven into her weathered face. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cI have some things to fix yet.\u201d She met the woman\u2019s eyes. They reminded her of African sky, blue, dry, and empty. \u201cYour part is over.\u201d\nFor a moment the woman didn\u2019t move. Then she lifted a finger to her forehead in a salute, turned and strode through the brush to the man\u2019s skimmer. A moment later it lifted and vanished.\nThe pride had settled down to a serious feeding now and already the scavengers had begun to gather. One of the wild dogs darted in to snatch a scrap, then fled, butt tucked as a young male charged. She could come back in a couple of days, pick up any last evidence. Record the young lioness\u2019s death as an official euthanasia.\nShe limped to the skimmer, washed by waves of weakness, hoping she wouldn\u2019t fall off before she got back to Administration.\nA red icon winked on the control panel. A Security alert. Muttering a curse because she would have thought the meat hunter was more careful than that, Tahira touched it.\nOfficial intrusion with legal permission, contact estimate five minutes.\nTahira leaned against the skimmer and closed her eyes. Legal permission. He got his warrant after all? She waited for the whisper of the grounding skimmer.\n\u201cTahira.\u201d Shawn\u2019s voice sounded harsh. \u201cWhat the hell is going on? You\u2019ve got lions right behind you. Eating something.\u201d\nHe was afraid. Her lips twitched and she almost smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re busy. They won\u2019t bother us. I think I need a ride.\u201d She forced her eyes open. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can get the skimmer back on my own. Did you come to arrest me?\u201d\n\u201cDamn right.\u201d He appeared beside her, watching the lions. \u201cHospital first, I think.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably a good idea.\u201d She forced herself straight, looked him in the face. \u201cDid you access that link? Buy the video?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d He looked briefly away.\n\u201cThe man who dropped them here . . . \u201d She pointed with her chin toward the lions. Mistake. The world began to turn slowly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t read his expression. \u201cYes. Take this.\u201d She handed him the stunner from the skimmer. \u201cI don\u2019t think the lions will bother me, but if one does, this will stop it.\u201d She walked away before he could react, circled around to reach the dead lioness, one eye on the feeding lions. They knew she was there, paid as little attention as they gave the coy-dogs that had gathered. She took the tissue sample quickly, dropped it into a collection bag and returned with the last ounce of her strength.\nShe was done. She let him take over, gave in and let the slowly turning landscape speed up until it swept her away. Was aware of jostling, a sense of speed, a low muttered monologue of cursing. Faded in and out of lights and bustle and the dim distant knowledge in the back of her brain that this must be the resort medical facility. Someone was arguing loudly, right over her. It hurt her head and she retreated into darkness.\nWhen she opened her eyes it was light, daylight bright, and her mouth felt like a Preserve riverbed in a drought.\n\u201cThey want you to drink this.\u201d Shawn leaned into view, holding a plastic squeeze-bag of yellow-green liquid with a drinking tube.\nShe sucked at the liquid, winced, and swallowed. There was no way to make electrolytes taste good.\n\u201cThe bullet did a lot of soft tissue damage but missed anything important,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cMade a big hole though. They left some drains in.\u201d\nShe peered at the bandages swathing her left arm. It didn\u2019t hurt, but that would probably change when the meds wore off. \u201cCan I leave?\u201d\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll let you go if you sign all kinds of waivers absolving them from blame.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do we go to jail from here?\u201d\nHis eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cThat depends. We can talk about it.\u201d\nHe was right about waivers. She signed and retinaed a half-dozen absolutions of all liability but finally they carted her to the entry in a motorized chair and let her escape. Shawn offered her his arm and she leaned on it. Harder than she thought she would need to. He was driving a small, rather scuffed up electric. His private car? \u201cYou\u2019re not on duty?\u201d She realized he was wearing a casual sun shirt and khakis. \u201cYour day off?\u201d\n\u201cMy day off.\u201d He slid into the driver\u2019s seat, touched on the air-conditioning and sat there as the hot interior air cooled. \u201cWant to tell me?\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d\nHe shrugged. Turned those dry, blue eyes on her. \u201cI guess I could still arrest you on suspicion of being an accessory to a murder.\u201d\n\u201cI am that.\u201d And she told him, leaning back against the still-warm plastic of the seat as the car hummed to life and Shawn drove her back to the Preserve. She told him the whole story from her comments on the tour bus, to her ambush by the meat hunter and the arrival of the vid maker.\nHe didn\u2019t say a word.\nShe finished as they entered the ornate gates of the Preserve and she closed her eyes, exhausted by the telling, her shoulder starting to hurt now with a muffled throb that promised worse to come.\n\u201cA meat hunter.\u201d Shawn parked in the afternoon shade cast by the building\u2019s solar panels. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t want me to go after her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Tahira opened one eye. \u201cHer world is as dead as mine is. There is no wild meat to hunt any more. Not the kind that made her a living.\u201d\n\u201cShe could come back to poach.\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou are so sure.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\nShawn sighed. \u201cSo you\u2019ve achieved your justice. The lions killed the man the same way they killed the girl. And now you want me to just walk away and call it over. Do you think that ends it, Tahira?\u201d\nThe bitterness in his voice surprised her. \u201cOf course that doesn\u2019t end it.\u201d She opened her eyes, faced him. \u201cHe was not the boss. He was simply a tool. It\u2019s way too big a business. I doubt it will ever end, Shawn.\u201d She opened the electric\u2019s door one-handed, amazed at how heavy it was. \u201cOur species is addicted to death. And now, on the brink of conquering it, we love it even more.\u201d She pulled herself to her feet as he came around to help her and amazingly managed not to sway. \u201cBut this ends it here.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure of that, too?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d She looked him in the face. \u201cI am.\u201d\nHe lifted his eyes, fixed them on the dry blue sky above. \u201cEven if you die?\u201d\n\u201cIf I die, the information to end it here will come to you.\u201d She started for the entrance, judging the distance. Maybe too far. When he caught up to her, took her arm, she let him, leaned on him. He was angry, radiating like a range fire.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019d just like to know who made you judge and jury.\u201d\nThe door scanned her hardware and opened, breathing cool air over them. The water-wall filled the building with the scent of rain and she took a deep breath, happy in this single moment of sensation. \u201cI appointed myself.\u201d She sank onto one of the floor cushions. \u201cThere is beer in the refrigerator. Why don\u2019t you bring us each one? Since you are not on duty?\u201d\nHe did, handed her the tall glass, sat down across from her, his expression thoughtful. He was older than Jen, his face lined with his years of work. She studied the lines around his eyes, seeing the echoes of old laughter, of sorrow, of life.\n\u201cWhat does this Preserve mean to you?\u201d He looked up suddenly.\nShe took a sip of her beer, relishing the cool, slightly bitter taste, the dewy chill of the glass against her lips. Life, she thought, is made up of moments. We simply fail to notice most of them. \u201cI have asked myself that question for a long time.\u201d She studied the tiny, silver bubbles rising through the amber liquid. \u201cI\u2019m a lot older than you, Shawn. I\u2019m a product of world that is now dead.\u201d\n\u201cAfrica,\u201d he murmured.\n\u201cAfrica is a continent.\u201d She lifted her glass in his direction. \u201cLesotho. Once upon a time, long before you were born, my people raised and reintroduced lions to the dying plains. We had killed them all and now, many generations later, we brought them back. Only we didn\u2019t know the plains were dying, but they were. We, the Lesotho people, succeeded. For a while.\u201d She lifted one shoulder in a half-shrug. \u201cBut the plains died, then the lions died, and ultimately . . . \u201d She drank more beer. \u201cLesotho died. Here . . . I found a trace of that dead world.\u201d\n\u201cThe lions?\u201d Shawn leaned forward and touched her hand lightly.\n\u201cThem, too.\u201d She tilted her head to study him, aware that she was getting drunk. \u201cBut it is not the world I knew. We did not care enough about that world to bring it back. Why not, Shawn?\u201d\n\u201cNo tourist value,\u201d he said softly.\n\u201cThis world the engineers are creating is so old that it is new.\u201d She tried to smile, but it felt crooked. \u201cThe merely old has no value. Still . . . there are lions.\u201d She took another swallow of her beer. \u201cAnd this is a refuge. From memory, if nothing else.\u201d\nThe entry chimed. \u201cHey, Tahira, you\u2019re back.\u201d Jen breezed through, bringing in the scent of dust and afternoon heat. \u201cHi, have we met?\u201d He offered a hand to Shawn as he rose from the cushion. \u201cI\u2019m Jen, a grad student. I study bugs.\u201d\n\u201cHi, Jen. I was just leaving.\u201d Shawn got to his feet, hesitated, then leaned down. \u201cTo memories.\u201d He touched his glass to hers.\nShe hesitated for a moment, met his eyes. Found . . . compassion there.\nJen looked from one to the other, puzzled, as they emptied their glasses. Shawn took them to the kitchen wall, lifted a hand to her, then left, the door whispering shut behind him.\n\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d He set his field pack against the wall.\n\u201cHe was deciding whether or not to arrest me.\u201d Tahira watched Jen fill a glass of water. \u201cI\u2019d like some water, too, please.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the arrest thing?\u201d He turned, smiling, a full glass in each hand. \u201cAnd what happened to your arm? Did you have an accident with the skimmer?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I did.\u201d She took the glass. \u201cSit down, Jen.\u201d\nHe sat, the first tickle of alarm tightening the skin of his eyes before he quickly banished it with a smooth, careful smile.\n\u201cI have done a number of things in my long life.\u201d Tahira sipped her water. \u201cOne was computer security. I was very good. The systems these days are more advanced, but not excessively so.\u201d\n\u201cHow interesting.\u201d\nHe was doing the facial expression well, but his body betrayed him, tension lifting his shoulders, straightening the curve of his spine. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was able to trace your alterations to the security platform.\u201d She raised her hand to silence him as he opened his mouth. \u201cAnd I was also able to document the source of the Security breach and ID you. It\u2019s documented, Jen. Archived in hard media to be released to the authorities either on my say-so, or upon my death.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I didn\u2019t know . . . anyone was going to get killed.\u201d His face had gone white and in an instant, the planes and angles of maturity had softened to the rounded face of a child. \u201cIt . . . I was horrified. I didn\u2019t know . . . but they\u2019d . . . I didn\u2019t dare say . . . I couldn\u2019t tell . . . \u201d\nWas I ever a child like this? she wondered. She tried to remember. Didn\u2019t think so. Her older daughter had never been a child either. Not really. What about her younger daughter? Had they allowed her to be a child before she became a soldier? She hoped so. With all her heart. That was what I bought for you, she thought. Sighed. \u201cYou already knew that girl was dead when I first told you we\u2019d had an intruder. Relax, Jen.\u201d She lifted her hand to silence him. \u201cYou are a pawn in this game. You will do one thing for me and then you are free to keep studying your bugs . . . Although I suggest that you look into a transfer to another research program as quickly as you can engineer it.\u201d She studied his bowed head and hunched shoulders. \u201cIf something does happen to me, you will certainly be a suspect, so it might be unsafe for you to remain here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d he mumbled.\n\u201cYou will run the DNA analysis on the bones that we found. I will give you a sample of lion DNA and you will make sure that you find that DNA associated with the dead girl. It may be there already. If it is not you will find it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d He raised his head, the fearful hope in his eyes painful to look at.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d You would not have survived in my world, she thought.\n\u201cI . . . I already put in a grant proposal.\u201d He looked away, swallowed. \u201cI\u2019d be doing it at the Antarctic preserve, looking at the symbiotic bacteria that still exist near the pole.\u201d\nAh, guilt. It would get him out of her sight quickly, at least. \u201cGood.\u201d She nodded. \u201cHere.\u201d She fumbled the collection bag from her coveralls. Handed it to him. The bit of flesh had turned brown and ugly. \u201cThis is your DNA.\u201d\nHe took it and fled. She suspected she wouldn\u2019t see him before he left\u2014not if he could avoid it. Which suited her just fine.\nThe beer had given her energy, or maybe it had been the compassion in Shawn\u2019s eyes. She had not expected . . . understanding. But now, exhaustion was creeping through her. She opened her holo field and set it to secure, in case Jen was brave enough to return. She opened the camera control and set it to face view only. Her boss would not see her bandages.\nCarlo answered quickly, seated in his teak and real-leather desk-recliner. \u201cDid you get my messages?\u201d He looked angry, his jet hair, usually immaculate, slightly mussed as if he had run his hand through it. \u201cWhat is all this in the media? Tourists claiming that you were a witness to that intruder\u2019s death?\u201d\n\u201cI have already informed the authorities that it was a mistake.\u201d She gave him a smooth smile. \u201cThe small brush-fire of blogging will fade quickly.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the last thing we need, Tahira.\u201d He scowled at her. \u201cSuch carelessness is unlike you. You know better than to do anything that will incite negative public attention. What were you thinking?\u201d\n\u201cI needed to make myself bait,\u201d she said simply. \u201cThat was the surest and fastest method.\u201d\nHe was far more mature than Jen and his face betrayed nothing, not even the tic of an eyelid gave him away. Almost, she could believe . . . \u201cOur security is very very cutting edge. I sent you the inserted visuals that replaced the images of the girl\u2019s dying. Perhaps Jen was in a hurry.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut he had neither the access nor the expertise to allow an intruder to come and go through the Security shield without triggering any alarm or record. The intruder had a password.\u201d\n\u201cHow could someone have that?\u201d\nShe had almost believed that she had made a mistake, but his tone betrayed him. He was asking a rhetorical question. \u201cOnly two people have a password, Carlo. You and I. There is no real anonymity in the net. Not for a long time now.\u201d She smiled at him, pleasantly. \u201cI do not believe you are one of the major players here. If I did . . . \u201d She bared her teeth at him. \u201cI would not be talking to you. I think you merely . . . got a percentage. Rental. And perhaps a copy of the video? Does that excite you? A real and violent death, with real fear, and real blood?\u201d\nHe flinched then, and her stomach twisted.\n\u201cThat was how they came to ask you, wasn\u2019t it? You are a customer.\u201d She kept the disgust out of her voice, because it was not yet time to end this conversation. \u201cI have archived a file of all my suspicions and all the evidence I have uncovered to support them. It is not sufficient to convict you. But it is sufficient to let those with greater investigative skills than I have find out the truth. Then they will convict you. On the day of my death, the archive goes to the appropriate World Council committee members.\u201d\n\u201cBlackmail?\u201d His lip curled. \u201cIs that so much better than what I did?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not blackmail.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt is simply an insurance policy. To make sure that this does not happen again here.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t believe her.\n\u201cI am finishing up the DNA scan of the dead girl. I have already euthanized the lioness that attacked her. You may release that information to the media and the public. You may make whatever statement about blogger inaccuracies you choose and that will, as I said, fade away. If anything\u201d\u2014her lip curled\u2014\u201cit will increase traffic to the Preserve. As you know, violent death is a potent pheromone.\u201d\nHis reaction was more visible this time.\nShe ended the link. Rudely.\nShe was entitled to be rude.\n\u201cHe is too well protected.\u201d She was speaking to Shawn\u2019s absence, heard her own defensive tone. \u201cHe is insulated by too much money and too many connections. He would emerge from the ashes of an investigation and nothing would change.\u201d She closed down her field, got to her feet, feeling age in her flesh. How much longer did she have? \u201cPerhaps I am too much a product of my old world. To me, justice is direct\u2014an eye for an eye. The justice of the old gods. Of the lions.\u201d\nShe had bought the old lioness a second chance. It might not buy her much time at all, or she might get another season before she was ousted by one of the younger, striped, new females that made the gene engineers so happy. She had a tour scheduled tomorrow. The note on the green calendar field on the wall was flashing its reminder. She stretched her shoulder, testing the limits of the pain. If she slept well, she could do it, perhaps with less energy. There would be questions. She would have to decide on the answers before then, would this time do Shawn the courtesy of telling him what her answers would be.\nAnd soon it would be nothing more than an ephemera floating in webspace, evoked from time to time like a fading ghost, through some odd search connection that summoned up a stale blog entry. The world was full of ghosts.\nInstead of going to her bed, she slipped outside and found her skimmer parked in its usual place. Someone had cleaned the blood from it. She found her spare glasses in the tool compartment, slipped them on and lifted into the darkness. The lions would be hunting and she might catch the pride on their way down to the river. The pain in her shoulder faded as she toed the skimmer up to speed and slid through the bright bubble of a yesterday that had never really happened.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, January 2009.\nMary Rosenblum attended the prestigious Clarion West Writers workshop in 1988, where she sold her first SF story to Asimov's Magazine editor Gardner Dozois and her writing career took off.

Covid-19 is a part of our daily lives. It\u2019s hard to avoid when you can\u2019t leave your house. I live in NJ, the second most infected state in the country. We\u2019ve been under lockdown for over two weeks and just had a CDC travel advisory slapped on us. My wife and youngest son are working from home and adjusting to what will likely continue for weeks ahead. Staying home is easy when it\u2019s your choice. Knowing you have to is a constant reminder.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had a sword hanging over my head, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier. I try to keep my focus on the present: we\u2019re alive, we\u2019re healthy, and we\u2019re together. We shouldn\u2019t lose track of the good things. If you\u2019re reading this on the first of the month, Lisa and I are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. We might not be able to celebrate the way we would have liked\u2014with family and friends\u2014but we can and will celebrate. I can\u2019t stress enough, just how lucky I am to have Lisa in my life. Previous swords had me thinking I wouldn\u2019t make it to this milestone, but here we are and it is wonderful.\nBy now, I expected to be burying myself in TV and movies, but that hasn\u2019t come to pass. Instead there\u2019s been a lot of cleaning and a yard reclamation project\u2014taking it back from the encroaching thorn bushes and honeysuckle. It\u2019s a distraction that provides some exercise and mindlessness. Throughout the month I\u2019ve alternated between burying myself in work and being unable to focus on it. There have been weeks where every submitted story has been responded to in 24 hours or less, followed by 3-4 days of silence. I don\u2019t like that, but I keep reminding myself that under the sword, you do what you have to.\nThis is a time where deadlines should be a lot more flexible. We already have enough stress, so this shouldn\u2019t be adding more. I see too many friends being placed under additional and unnecessary pressure to meet deadlines from workaholic bosses who think everyone will deal with this situation the same way. I also see a lot of conventions canceling and announcing their intentions to go fully online. I worry for the front line folks, mostly volunteers, who have to turn these monsters into a reality when most of the people leading the efforts have no experience in this medium. If I learned anything from being an instructional designer, it was that you can\u2019t replicate the traditional face-to-face experience online and you certainly can\u2019t rush it.\nAmusingly, after canceling my trip to ICFA\u2014ahead of the convention itself being canceled\u2014I started asking around to see what people would think about having some online panels. The enthusiasm was quite high, so there is a demand. Quietly, I\u2019ve been working in the background and trying to work out a viable project for Clarkesworld. Later this month, I\u2019ll be announcing a series of free online panels that we\u2019ll be hosting over the course of a month. As the software for these things can get very expensive, we\u2019ve settled on a solution that will allow for an overflow room on our YouTube channel if the audience is too big. The only difference for those people is that they won\u2019t be part of the main audience chat room. The goal is to keep it casual and focused around short fiction. Charging a fee would establish expectations and pressure I\u2019m just not interested in at this time. It also removes a barrier\u2014paywall\u2014that I don\u2019t think is appropriate under the current conditions. This side project will also allow me to do one of the things I\u2019ve spoken about previously: a panel for foreign authors who would like to learn more about submitting short stories and being published in the US.\nAnd now I think it\u2019s time to pick up the cutters and head into the backyard. There\u2019s a thorn bush that wants to distract me from the chaos. Hopefully you\u2019ll find your thorn bush in this issue and can forget for just a little while. Stay safe and may things be better for us all in the days ahead.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

Instead of spending a nice warm day in California, I am being subjected to a rare Fall snowstorm in New Jersey. As I write this editorial, the snow is piling up, knocking down trees, and causing power outages. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll be inspecting the damage and shoveling out. This isn\u2019t the fun weekend I had planned, but I\u2019ll try to make the best of it. Perhaps I\u2019ll grab my Kindle, sit by the fire and drink some hot chocolate.\nFor the good part of the last two months, I\u2019ve been dealing with a different sort of unexpected event. With Cheryl Morgan\u2019s upcoming departure from Clarkesworld, I needed to find someone who could carry on her excellent work and move us forward from there. The number of talented people who expressed an interest in becoming our new Non-fiction Editor pleasantly surprised me. After much consideration, I offered the position to Jason Heller. I first encountered Jason\u2019s work through an article he wrote for Cheryl back in issue forty-five: \u201cMoonage Daydream: The Rock Album as Science Fiction.\u201d Since then, I\u2019ve enjoyed his work in a wide variety of publications, including regular appearances in The A.V. Club and Alternative Press.\nThroughout the process, Jason and I have had several interesting conversations about the direction our non-fiction should take. He\u2019s causing me to question some of my own preconceptions and while we haven\u2019t settled all the details, I think he\u2019s going to do some very interesting things. In order to support his ideas, I need to put more money in the non-fiction budget, so just as I did with fiction last month, I\u2019m going to redirect subscription money his way after we pick up another five hundred subscribers.\nIn the meantime, please let us know what you\u2019d like to see. Are there features you\u2019d like us to include or expand on? We\u2019ll be sharing some of our ideas in the months ahead, but this is the perfect time to get your two-cents in. Leave a comment on the website or send Jason and me an email. We\u2019d love to hear from you.\nOh, and if you were at World Fantasy Convention, please do me a favor and tell me it rained the whole time.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

I\u2019m going to briefly cover all of them right now and cover some in detail when I have the luxury of some worry-free time.\nThing 1: That Whirring Sound From My Chest\nOr beeping, actually. Yes, the alarms for the battery started and it is time to replace my defibrillator. However, in December, a second set of alarms went off and indicated a failure in one of the coils. This means that not only is the unit being replaced\u2014that\u2019s what happens when the battery dies\u2014but I also need to have the wires that go into my heart replaced too. It\u2019s a fairly unusual situation that I\u2019ve over-documented on my blog (neil-clarke.com), but the short version is that my surgery will be more complicated and a bit riskier. I\u2019m meeting with the surgeon in early January and should have further details then. It\u2019s likely that the procedure will be done very soon. Nervous? Of course. Wish me luck.\nThing 2: Words From the Other Side of the World\nIn August 2011, we published our first translation, \u201cThe Fish of Lijiang\u201d by Chen Qiufan, translated by Ken Liu. Over the next few years, we published a few more, thanks to Ken and John Chu. Unknown to us, those translations were generating some attention in China and one day, I woke to find an email from Storycom in my inbox. They liked what we were doing and were curious if we\u2019d like to make it a regular feature.\nOver the next few months, we hammered out logistics and a variety of rights issues. To make things work from our end, we launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the addition of an extra story slot to the magazine, so that translations could sit alongside English language stories as an expansion of our existing work. With Storycom and our Kickstarter supporters, we launched our translation project exactly five years ago this month. Since then we have featured nearly fifty works of Chinese science fiction.\nIt\u2019s easy to think of things in a vacuum, but regularly publishing translations created opportunities not only for those authors, but us as well. In the years since, we\u2019ve seen a significant rise in the number of translations and works by foreign authors in our slush pile and pages. There\u2019s even a direct line between these efforts and the Korean SF grant we received from LTI Korea last year. (Speaking of which, this issue features the last of those stories. We\u2019re still hoping to get funding for a second round.)\nI\u2019m extremely grateful to everyone at Storycom for their vision and support. Their commitment to this project has opened many doors, introduced me to some amazing people\u2014many I now call friends\u2014and helped make translations a less uncommon fixture in English language SF. I look forward to what our efforts will bring in this new decade. Thank you Storycom and thank you to all the authors and translators that have been part of this team as well.\nThing 3: That Annual January Thing with Last Year\u2019s Work\nIt\u2019s almost time to pick your favorite Clarkesworld story and cover art from 2019 in our annual reader\u2019s poll!\nPhase 1: Nominations (mid-January)\nLater this month, we\u2019ll open for a forty-eight hour flash nomination period to identify the top five candidates in each category: story and art. The announcement for this phase will be sent out via:\n- Twitter (twitter.com/clarkesworld)\n- Facebook (www.facebook.com/clarkesworld)\n- Patreon (www.patreon.com/clarkesworld)\n- My blog (neil-clarke.com)\nThe purpose of the brevity of this phase is to create a sense of urgency and reduce the opportunities for a coordinated ballot-stuffing campaign. Previous efforts have proved this to be effective at meeting these goals.\nPhase 2: Final Voting (February)\nThe five finalists in each category will be announced in my February editorial. Final voting will open on the 1st and continue through the 15th. The winners will be announced in our March issue.\nBonus Thing\nHappy New Year!

It\u2019s expected of them. Maybe they stretch believability with that faster-than-light nonsense and all the strange creatures, but at least they know they need to imagine a means to circumvent the constraints of light speed, and that the creatures have to be tied loosely to some ecological environment where their strangeness is a reasonable adaptation. In earth science, however, there seem to be no constraints. Tides, earthquakes, deep stresses, giant caverns, and terrible storms are all too often magic forces invoked to provide drama and atmosphere without reference to reasonable science. What would earth science in the movies be without volcanoes in impossible places, giant caverns to the Earth\u2019s core, and nearly-instantaneous changes in temperature masquerading as catastrophic climate change?\n I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cOh, but that\u2019s just in the movies, they\u2019re always bad.\u201d Sorry, it\u2019s not only the movies. Misconceptions of earth science so pervade our collective understanding that magic happenings are sometimes preferred in written stories; not only for their drama but for their believability!\n Don\u2019t think so? Consider this advice to new science fiction writers from Kathy Wentworth, judge of a well-known writers\u2019 contest.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re writing hard sf, do your research and get your facts right . . . the science has to be dead on . . . You can\u2019t have diamond ships that shatter when iron runs into them . . . without explanation.\u201d (Dec 21, 2007 Writers and Illustrators of the Future Newsletter)\n Oh? Why not? Isn\u2019t that exactly what would happen? Here\u2019s a quick thought puzzle for you: Let me smash your diamond engagement ring with an iron hammer and see which one breaks.\n Oops.\n Equating strength with hardness is a common misconception we address in introductory geology classes. Hardness relates to how a material resists scratching, not to how likely it is to survive a sudden blow. Iron is malleable, allowing it to deform without breaking when subjected to a force that would shatter the much harder diamond.\n Yet this misconception is so strong that the science fiction writer must spend tons of words making what\u2019s really true believable. Why bother? Just go with the misconception. Thus, Earth Science gets no respect, and writers know and accept this.\n Moved by the Tides\n \u201cEven this high above the coast, in the crystalline silence of the mountains, he could hear the tides ripped from the ocean by the moons and hurtled against the shore far below.\u201d\n Lovely atmosphere, but tides hurtling against the shore?\n Waves, driven by wind, hurtle against a shore. Tides, on the other hand, move gradually with the rotating world and the orbiting moons, a bulge in the ocean that creeps or sweeps upon a shoreline. They don\u2019t hurtle with the sound of crashing waves.\n Catherine Asaro is a physicist. She should know this. I can only surmise that since this is earth science (which gets no respect) authors presume readers don\u2019t know any better. Tides, waves, whatever. Aren\u2019t they interchangeable? And crashing tides are more dramatic than creeping ones.\n All Done by Magic\n I point out to my college students that real science writing happens in making connections between cause and effect, not in spouting factoids. I suggest that if you can substitute the word \u201cmagic\u201d for some cause in a sentence, without changing the character of the sentence, then you haven\u2019t made the connection between cause and effect. Here\u2019s an example.\n Ophiolites are rock bodies formed deep in the crust of ocean basins, yet we sometimes find them at the surface of continents. Students write, \u201cophiolites are exposed at the Earth\u2019s surface by Plate Tectonics,\u201d thinking this tells the reader how ophiolites are exposed. It doesn\u2019t. Think about it. Can you tell me, based on this sentence, how ophiolites reach the surface of continents? You may as well say ophiolites are exposed by magic.\n For science fiction writers, trying out the word \u201cmagic\u201d can help identify passages that don\u2019t make sense. \u201c . . . he could hear the tides ripped from the ocean by magic . . . \u201d Investigation reveals little connection between crashing waves and the hours-long rotation of a world or the orbit of its moons. It\u2019s Clarke\u2019s Law in action: without any understanding of how the science works, it might as well be magic.\n What\u2019s really distressing is that I delighted in the sound of the crashing \u201ctides,\u201d and loved the story! No wonder earth science gets no respect!\n Scraped Flat\n Most authors don\u2019t include earth science in their stories at all, or include it only as an atmospheric backdrop. But there are a few who incorporate earth science in substantial ways. These are some of my favorite writers and stories. So naturally, with apologies, I\u2019m going to pick on them.\n \u201cThe plateaus were probably carved by methane glaciers, Angela said.\u201d\n OK, methane glaciers, that\u2019s cool, and the story is set on a world with hydrocarbon rain, so that makes sense. But consider rephrasing this as \u201cplateaus were carved by magic.\u201d Is there any non-magical connection between glaciers and plateaus?\n Not much. What\u2019s more, the idea of plateaus carved by glaciers brings up another common misconception of earth science. When I ask my college students why the Red River Valley of the North at the border between North Dakota and Minnesota is so flat, they always say, \u201cBecause the glaciers scraped it off.\u201d\n Nope. Flat topography, such as a plateau, usually requires erosion or deposition to a base level. Think about rivers flowing into an ocean. As the landscape erodes down to sea level, the slope will decrease, causing the water velocity to slow and lose its capacity to erode. Thus, land will erode flat at the level of the sea, the base level, and no further.\n Glaciers don\u2019t behave in the same way as rivers. They erode here or deposit there on the basis of variations in temperature, speed of movement, and thickness of the ice. What\u2019s more, when the ice melts, rock and sediment caught up in the ice are draped irregularly over the preexisting topography leaving a rolling, hummocky terrain, not a flat plateau.\n So, glaciers, methane or otherwise, aren\u2019t going to carve a plateau, although they might drape glacial deposits on top of a preexisting plateau formed by another process, as shown in the illustration to the right.\n Volcanoes of Ice\n Ice worlds are cool and fun to read about, but they provide plenty of opportunities for writers to get things wrong. Consider another ice world story by a new writer, \u201cThe Frozen Sky\u201d by Jeff Carlson (L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future XXIII). This little gem, in which explorers discover alien life in the catacombs of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, has all kinds of geological details, such as the formation of an oxygen atmosphere by dissociation of water molecules on the icy surface. Frozen silicate lava from past volcanism cuts across the icy catacombs, an important element of the story because the lava rock, much harder than the ice, blocks the characters\u2019 way in places.\n However, real volcanoes on Europa don\u2019t involve the melting of silicate rock. On frigid Europa, the crustal \u201crock\u201d is ice, and lava is made of hot, molten liquid ice (that is, water) rather than liquid silicate. Thus story elements that involve silicate magma in contact with water ice, and the separate uses of the words \u201cice\u201d and \u201crock,\u201d don\u2019t make sense. Silicate rock melts a thousand degrees Celsius higher than water ice, so intrusion of silicate lava into water ice would vaporize it, pulverizing both water rock and silicate rock.\n A Lot of Hot Air\n New writers seem to be particularly bold in putting earth science in their stories (a very hopeful sign!). \u201cThe Flue\u201d by John Schoffstall (L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future XXI) is a story in which giant towers in the desert capture heat energy by allowing rapidly rising air to turn power turbines in towers that are kilometers high. There\u2019s all kinds of physics details in the story (proving that physics gets respect), such as the terminal velocity of a falling body and how this relates to the velocity of upward moving air required to suspend or raise a body. Way cool.\n But the earth science doesn\u2019t quite work. What, exactly, is causing the air to rise up these giant towers?\n The implication of the story is that well, duh, hot air rises. And the desert is hot. But why isn\u2019t it already rising out there in the desert before we build the towers, thus creating a great vacuum at the surface?\n Ok, so maybe a tower somehow (read \u201cmagically\u201d) creates a pocket of convection centered on the tower, with air rising at the tower and sinking somewhere nearby in compensation. But there is a more serious problem. The temperature of the air where it comes out the top of the tower is sixty-five degrees Celsius (medium rare on a meat thermometer, according to the story). This high temperature is a key challenge which the protagonist must overcome in climbing a kilometer down the tower to find out why Flue number seven is 5% off its rated output.\n Here\u2019s the problem. How did the air get so hot? Down at the surface of the desert the air might be, say, forty-six degrees Celsius on a really hot day. As air rises, its temperature will fall due to adiabatic decompressional cooling (that is, cooling caused by the expansion of the air as pressure decreases upward). You can experience this yourself by blowing up a balloon and then holding it against your cheek as you let the air out quickly. The balloon will grow cool. Try it!\n A rise of a couple of kilometers will result in a temperature drop of about twenty degrees Celsius if air is dry, reducing air temperature to twenty-five degrees. But the temperature at the top of the tower is reported as forty degrees higher than this! The only way for that to occur is if energy is added to the air. But, if energy is added to the air in the tower, then the tower won\u2019t be an energy generator, it will be an energy consumer!\n Convection towers have been proposed and tested in the non-fiction world as a means to capture solar energy. However, real towers require the air at the surface to be heated above ambient temperature for the process to work. One way to accomplish this is to build a green-house-like solar collector in an apron around the tower (see illustration below). Even so, the temperature of the air will decrease as the air rises up the tower.\n Hail and Ice\n Thus we have a thrilling story, with cool physics, but the earth science doesn\u2019t quite work out. No respect again.\n OK, so volcanoes can\u2019t really just pop up anywhere, and caverns deeper than a few thousand feet in Earth\u2019s crust would collapse under the weight of overlying rock. At least we can do anything we want with weather, right? It\u2019s so erratic, so unpredictable, so powerful and mysterious, that anything is possible. Right?\n Let me pick on my favorite author. I hope she\u2019ll forgive me. In Riders of the Storm (DAW), Julie Czerneda writes an exciting scene where the protagonist struggles against a fierce winter storm involving \u201cice stones as big as a fist\u201d and rain that \u201cwasn\u2019t rain, it was liquid ice.\u201d\n Exciting, but is it likely? Actually we don\u2019t observe freezing rain and fist sized hail from a single storm cloud on Earth, though we do see both separately. Why not?\n Let\u2019s think about it. To get such large hail stones, vertical winds have to be strong enough to suspend the stones in the air until they grow to the size of a fist, whereupon the ice will overcome the updraft and fall. This process will hold true on any non-magical planet.\n To get air moving upward at such a high velocity, the air needs to be highly unstable, such as when cold air aloft overlies warm air at the surface. The warm air will spontaneously rise due to its lower density, sometimes reaching hurricane force.\n In contrast, to get freezing rain, the air at the ground has to be colder than air aloft. Rain starts out warmer and gets colder as it falls, eventually freezing when it hits the ground.\n But, if cold, dense air is near the ground, and warm low-density air aloft, the air will be stable and you can\u2019t get strong vertical winds. Thus, large hail and freezing rain occur from very different types of storm clouds, regardless of whether you\u2019re on Earth or elsewhere (that is, unless you\u2019re in a universe with different physical laws).\n Of course, writers can always come up with ways to make unexpected things happen in a way that is believable within the context of the story. That\u2019s what makes science fiction stories fun. We should also not forget that real science is all about poking holes in old ideas so as to gain better new ones. Yet many science fiction writers apparently don\u2019t feel obliged to provide explanations for their deviations from standard earth science principles. Or maybe they don\u2019t realize when they\u2019re going wrong. Would they get away with treating physics or biology so carelessly?\n I tell you, earth science don\u2019t get no respect.\n Russ Colson lives with his wife Mary on a farmstead in northern Minnesota, far enough from city lights to see the Milky Way and the aurora borealis.

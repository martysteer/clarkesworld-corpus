There is no you to say \u201cI.\u201d What we call \u201cI\u201d is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale or when we exhale.\u2014Shun Ryu SuzukiI used to think the brain was the most important organ in the body, until I realized who was telling me that.\u2014Emo Phillips\n When I enter the office, Dr. S is leaning against the desk, talking earnestly to the dead girl\u2019s parents. He isn\u2019t happy, but when he looks up he puts on a smile for me. \u201cAnd here she is,\u201d he says, like a game show host revealing the grand prize. The people in the chairs turn, and Dr. Subramaniam gives me a private, encouraging wink.\n The father stands first, a blotchy, square-faced man with a tight belly he carries like a basketball. As in our previous visits, he is almost frowning, struggling to match his face to his emotions. The mother, though, has already been crying, and her face is wide open: joy, fear, hope, relief. It\u2019s way over the top.\n \u201cOh, Therese,\u201d she says. \u201cAre you ready to come home?\u201d\n Their daughter was named Therese. She died of an overdose almost two years ago, and since then Mitch and Alice Klass have visited this hospital dozens of times, looking for her. They desperately want me to be their daughter, and so in their heads I already am.\n My hand is still on the door handle. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d On paper I\u2019m only seventeen years old. I have no money, no credit cards, no job, no car. I own only a handful of clothes. And Robierto, the burliest orderly on the ward, is in the hallway behind me, blocking my escape.\n Therese\u2019s mother seems to stop breathing for a moment. She\u2019s a slim, narrow-boned woman who seems tall until she stands next to anyone. Mitch raises a hand to her shoulder, then drops it.\n As usual whenever Alice and Mitch come to visit, I feel like I\u2019ve walked into the middle of a soap opera and no one\u2019s given me my lines. I look directly at Dr. S, and his face is frozen into that professional smile. Several times over the past year he\u2019s convinced them to let me stay longer, but they\u2019re not listening anymore. They\u2019re my legal guardians, and they have Other Plans. Dr. S looks away from me, rubs the side of his nose.\n \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d I say.\n The father scowls. The mother bursts into fresh tears, and she cries all the way out of the building. Dr. Subramaniam watches from the entrance as we drive away, his hands in his pockets. I\u2019ve never been so angry with him in my life\u2014all two years of it.\n The name of the drug is Zen, or Zombie, or just Z. Thanks to Dr. S I have a pretty good idea of how it killed Therese.\n \u201cFlick your eyes to the left,\u201d he told me one afternoon. \u201cNow glance to the right. Did you see the room blur as your eyes moved?\u201d He waited until I did it again. \u201cNo blur. No one sees it.\u201d\n This is the kind of thing that gets brain doctors hot and bothered. Not only could no one see the blur, their brains edited it out completely. Skipped over it\u2014left view, then right view, with nothing between\u2014then fiddled with the person\u2019s time sense so that it didn\u2019t even seem missing.\n The scientists figured out that the brain was editing out shit all the time. They wired up patients and told them to lift one of their fingers, move it any time they wanted. Each time, the brain started the signal traveling toward the finger up to 120 milliseconds before the patient consciously decided to move it. Dr. S said you could see the brain warming up right before the patient consciously thought, now.\n This is weird, but it gets weirder the longer you think about it. And I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot.\n The conscious mind\u2014the \u201cI\u201d that\u2019s thinking, hey, I\u2019m thirsty, I\u2019ll reach for that cold cup of water\u2014hasn\u2019t really decided anything. The signal to start moving your hand has already traveled halfway down your arm by the time you even realize you are thirsty. Thought is an afterthought. By the way, the brain says, we\u2019ve decided to move your arm, so please have the thought to move it.\n The gap is normally 120 milliseconds, max. Zen extends this minutes. Hours.\n If you run into somebody who\u2019s on Zen, you won\u2019t notice much. The person\u2019s brain is still making decisions, and the body still follows orders. You can talk to the them, and they can talk to you. You can tell each other jokes, go out for hamburgers, do homework, have sex.\n But the person isn\u2019t conscious. There is no \u201cI\u201d there. You might as well be talking to a computer. And two people on Zen\u2014\u201cyou\u201d and \u201cI\u201d\u2014are just puppets talking to puppets.\n It\u2019s a little girl\u2019s room strewn with teenager. Stuffed animals crowd the shelves and windowsills, shoulder to shoulder with stacks of Christian rock CDs and hairbrushes and bottles of nail polish. Pinups from Teen People are taped to the wall, next to a bulletin board dripping with soccer ribbons and rec league gymnastic medals going back to second grade. Above the desk, a plaque titled \u201cI Promise . . . \u201d exhorting Christian youth to abstain from premarital sex. And everywhere taped and pinned to the walls, the photos: Therese at Bible camp, Therese on the balance beam, Therese with her arms around her youth group friends. Every morning she could open her eyes to a thousand reminders of who she was, who she\u2019d been, who she was supposed to become.\n I pick up the big stuffed panda that occupies the place of pride on the bed. It looks older than me, and the fur on the face is worn down to the batting. The button eyes hang by white thread\u2014they\u2019ve been re-sewn, maybe more than once.\n Therese\u2019s father sets down the pitifully small bag that contains everything I\u2019ve taken from the hospital: toiletries, a couple changes of clothes, and five of Dr. S\u2019s books. \u201cI guess old Boo Bear was waiting for you,\u201d he says.\n \u201cBoo W. Bear.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Boo W!\u201d It pleases him that I know this. As if it proves anything. \u201cYou know, your mother dusted this room every week. She never doubted that you\u2019d come back.\u201d\n I have never been here, and she is not coming back, but already I\u2019m tired of correcting pronouns. \u201cWell, that was nice,\u201d I say.\n \u201cShe\u2019s had a tough time of it. She knew people were talking, probably holding her responsible\u2014both of us, really. And she was worried about them saying things about you. She couldn\u2019t stand them thinking that you were a wild girl.\u201d\n \u201cThem?\u201d\n He blinks. \u201cThe Church.\u201d\n Ah. The Church. The term carried so many feelings and connotations for Therese that months ago I stopped trying to sort them out. The Church was the red-brick building of the Davenport Church of Christ, shafts of dusty light through rows of tall, glazed windows shaped like gravestones. The Church was God and the Holy Ghost (but not Jesus\u2014he was personal, separate somehow). Mostly, though, it was the congregation, dozens and dozens of people who\u2019d known her since before she was born. They loved her, they watched out for her, and they evaluated her every step. It was like having a hundred overprotective parents.\n I almost laugh. \u201cThe Church thinks Therese was wild?\u201d\n He scowls, but whether because I\u2019ve insulted the Church or because I keep referring to his daughter by name, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cOf course, not. It\u2019s just that you caused a lot of worry.\u201d His voice has assumed a sober tone that\u2019s probably never failed to unnerve his daughter. \u201cYou know, the church prayed for you every week.\u201d\n \u201cThey did?\u201d I do know Therese well enough to be sure this would have mortified her. She was a pray-er, not a pray-ee.\n Therese\u2019s father watches my face for the bloom of shame, maybe a few tears. From contrition it should have been one small step to confession. It\u2019s hard for me to take any of this seriously.\n I sit down on the bed and sink deep into the mattress. This is not going to work. The double bed takes up most of the room, with only a few feet of open space around it. Where am I going to meditate?\n \u201cWell,\u201d Therese\u2019s father says. His voice has softened. Maybe he thinks he\u2019s won. \u201cYou probably want to get changed,\u201d he says.\n He goes to the door but doesn\u2019t leave. I stand by the window, but I can feel him there, waiting. Finally the oddness of this makes me turn around.\n He\u2019s staring at the floor, a hand behind his neck. Therese might have been able to intuit his mood, but it\u2019s beyond me.\n \u201cWe want to help you, Therese. But there\u2019s so many things we just don\u2019t understand. Who gave you the drugs, why you went off with that boy, why you would\u2014\u201d His hand moves, a stifled gesture that could be anger, or just frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . hard.\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n He shuts the door when he leaves, and I push the panda to the floor and flop onto my back in relief. Poor Mr. Klass. He just wants to know if his daughter fell from grace, or was pushed.\n When I want to freak myself out, \u201cI\u201d think about \u201cme\u201d thinking about having an \u201cI.\u201d The only thing stupider than puppets talking to puppets is a puppet talking to itself.\n Dr. S says that nobody knows what the mind is, or how the brain generates it, and nobody really knows about consciousness. We talked almost every day while I was in the hospital, and after he saw that I was interested in this stuff\u2014how could I not be\u2014he gave me books and we\u2019d talk about brains and how they cook up thoughts and make decisions.\n \u201cHow do I explain this,\u201d he always starts. And then he tries out the metaphors he\u2019s working on for his book. My favorite is the Parliament, the Page, and the Queen.\n \u201cThe brain isn\u2019t one thing, of course,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s millions of firing cells, and those resolve into hundreds of active sites, and so it is with the mind. There are dozens of nodes in the mind, each one trying to out-shout the others. For any decision, the mind erupts with noise, and that triggers . . . how do I explain this . . . Have you ever seen the British Parliament on C-SPAN?\u201d Of course I had: in a hospital TV is a constant companion. \u201cThese members of the mind\u2019s parliament, they\u2019re all shouting in chemicals and electrical charges, until enough of the voices are shouting in unison. Ding! That\u2019s a \u2018thought,\u2019 a \u2018decision.\u2019 The Parliament immediately sends a signal to the body to act on the decision, and at the same time it tells the Page to take the news\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWait, who\u2019s the Page?\u201d\n He waves his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not important right now.\u201d (Weeks later, in a different discussion, Dr. S will explain that the Page isn\u2019t one thing, but a cascade of neural events in the temporal area of the limbic system that meshes the neural map of the new thought with the existing neural map\u2014but by then I know that \u201cneural map\u201d is just another metaphor for another deeply complex thing or process, and that I\u2019ll never get to the bottom of this. Dr. S said not to worry about it, that nobody gets to the bottom of it.) \u201cThe Page takes the news of the decision to the Queen.\u201d\n \u201cAll right then, who\u2019s the Queen? Consciousness?\u201d\n \u201cExactly right! The self itself.\u201d\n He beamed at me, his attentive student. Talking about this stuff gets Dr. S going like nothing else, but he\u2019s oblivious to the way I let the neck of my scrubs fall open when I stretch out on the couch. If only I could have tucked the two hemispheres of my brain into a lace bra.\n \u201cThe Page,\u201d he said, \u201cdelivers its message to Her Majesty, telling her what the Parliament has decided. The Queen doesn\u2019t need to know about all the other arguments that went on, all the other possibilities that were thrown out. She simply needs to know what to announce to her subjects. The Queen tells the parts of the body to act on the decision.\u201d\n \u201cWait, I thought the Parliament had already sent out the signal. You said before that you can see the brain warming up before the self even knows about it.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s the joke. The Queen announces the decision, and she thinks that her subjects are obeying her commands, but in reality, they have already been told what to do. They\u2019re already reaching for their glasses of water.\u201d\n I pad down to the kitchen in bare feet, wearing Therese\u2019s sweatpants and a t-shirt. The shirt is a little tight; Therese, champion dieter and Olympic-level purger, was a bit smaller than me.\n Alice is at the table, already dressed, a book open in front of her. \u201cWell, you slept in this morning,\u201d she says brightly. Her face is made up, her hair sprayed into place. The coffee cup next to the book is empty. She\u2019s been waiting for hours.\n I look around for a clock, and find one over the door. It\u2019s only nine. At the hospital I slept in later than that all the time. \u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d I say. There\u2019s a refrigerator, a stove, and dozens of cabinets.\n I\u2019ve never made my own breakfast. Or any lunch or dinner, for that matter. For my entire life, my meals have been served on cafeteria trays. \u201cDo you have scrambled eggs?\u201d\n She blinks. \u201cEggs? You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She abruptly stands. \u201cSure. Sit down, Therese, and I\u2019ll make you some.\u201d\n \u201cJust call me \u2018Terry,\u2019 okay?\u201d\n Alice stops, thinks about saying something\u2014I can almost hear the clank of cogs and ratchets\u2014until she abruptly strides to the cabinet, crouches, and pulls out a non-stick pan.\n I take a guess on which cabinet holds the coffee mugs, guess right, and take the last inch of coffee from the pot. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to go to work?\u201d I say. Alice does something at a restaurant supply company; Therese has always been hazy on the details.\n \u201cI\u2019ve taken a leave,\u201d she says. She cracks an egg against the edge of the pan, does something subtle with the shells as the yolk squeezes out and plops into the pan, and folds the shell halves into each other. All with one hand.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n She smiles tightly. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just abandon you after getting you home. I thought we might need some time together. During this adjustment period.\u201d\n \u201cSo when do I have to see this therapist? Whatsisname.\u201d My executioner.\n \u201cHer. Dr. Mehldau\u2019s in Baltimore, so we\u2019ll drive there tomorrow.\u201d This is their big plan. Dr. Subramaniam couldn\u2019t bring back Therese, so they\u2019re running to anyone who says they can. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s had a lot of success with people in your situation. That\u2019s her book.\u201d She nods at the table.\n \u201cSo? Dr. Subramaniam is writing one too.\u201d I pick up the book. The Road Home: Finding the Lost Children of Zen. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t go along with this?\u201d\n She says nothing, chopping at the eggs. I\u2019ll be eighteen in four months. Dr. S said that it will become a lot harder for them to hold me then. This ticking clock sounds constantly in my head, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s loud enough for Alice and Mitch to hear it too.\n \u201cLet\u2019s just try Dr. Mehldau first.\u201d\n \u201cFirst? What then?\u201d She doesn\u2019t answer. I flash on an image of me tied down to the bed, a priest making a cross over my twisting body. It\u2019s a fantasy, not a Therese memory\u2014I can tell the difference. Besides, if this had already happened to Therese, it wouldn\u2019t have been a priest.\n \u201cOkay then,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat if I just run away?\u201d\n \u201cIf you turn into a fish,\u201d she says lightly, \u201cthen I will turn into a fisherman and fish for you.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m laughing. I haven\u2019t heard Alice speak in anything but straightforward, earnest sentences.\n Alice\u2019s smile is sad. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d\n \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d The memory clicks. \u201cRunaway Bunny. Did she like that?\u201d\n Dr. S\u2019s book is about me. Well, Zen OD-ers in general, but there are only a couple thousand of us. Z\u2019s not a hugely popular drug, in the US or anywhere else. It\u2019s not a hallucinogen. It\u2019s not a euphoric or a depressant. You don\u2019t speed, mellow out, or even get high in the normal sense. It\u2019s hard to see what the attraction is. Frankly, I have trouble seeing it.\n Dr. S says that most drugs aren\u2019t about making you feel better, they\u2019re about not feeling anything at all. They\u2019re about numbness, escape. And Zen is a kind of arty, designer escape hatch. Zen disables the Page, locks him in his room, so that he can\u2019t make his deliveries to the Queen. There\u2019s no update to the neural map, and the Queen stops hearing what Parliament is up to. With no orders to bark, she goes silent. It\u2019s that silence that people like Therese craved.\n But the real attraction\u2014again, for people like Therese\u2014is the overdose. Swallow way too much Zen and the Page can\u2019t get out for weeks. When he finally gets out, he can\u2019t remember the way back to the Queen\u2019s castle. The whole process of updating the self that\u2019s been going on for years is suddenly derailed. The silent Queen can\u2019t be found.\n The Page, poor guy, does the only thing he can. He goes out and delivers the proclamations to the first girl he sees.\n The Queen is dead. Long live the Queen.\n \u201cHi, Terry. I\u2019m Dr. Mehldau.\u201d She\u2019s a stubby woman with a pleasant round face, and short dark hair shot with gray. She offers me her hand. Her fingers are cool and thin.\n \u201cYou called me Terry.\u201d\n \u201cI was told that you prefer to go by that. Do you want me to call you something else?\u201d\n \u201cNo . . . I just expected you to make me say my name is \u2018Therese\u2019 over and over.\u201d\n She laughs and sits down in a red leather chair that looks soft but sturdy. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be very helpful, do you? I can\u2019t make you do anything you don\u2019t want to do, Terry.\u201d\n \u201cSo I\u2019m free to go.\u201d\n \u201cCan\u2019t stop you. But I do have to report back to your parents on how we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n My parents.\n She shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s my job. Why don\u2019t you have a seat and we can talk about why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n The chair opposite her is cloth, not leather, but it\u2019s still nicer than anything in Dr. Subramaniam\u2019s office. The entire office is nicer than Dr. S\u2019s office. Daffodil walls in white trim, big windows glowing behind white cloth shades, tropically colored paintings.\n I don\u2019t sit down.\n \u201cYour job is to turn me into Mitch and Alice\u2019s daughter. I\u2019m not going to do that. So any time we spend talking is just bullshit.\u201d\n \u201cTerry, no one can turn you into something you\u2019re not.\u201d\n \u201cWell then we\u2019re done here.\u201d I walk across the room\u2014though \u201cstroll\u201d is what I\u2019m shooting for\u2014and pick up an African-looking wooden doll from the bookshelf. The shelves are decorated with enough books to look serious, but there are long open spaces for arty arrangements of candlesticks and Japanese fans and plaques that advertise awards and appreciations. Dr. S\u2019s bookshelves are for holding books, and books stacked on books. Dr. Mehldau\u2019s bookshelves are for selling the idea of Dr. Mehldau.\n \u201cSo what are you, a psychiatrist or a psychologist or what?\u201d I\u2019ve met all kinds in the hospital. The psychiatrists are M.D.\u2019s like Dr. S and can give you drugs. I haven\u2019t figured out what the psychologists are good for.\n \u201cNeither,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a counselor.\u201d\n \u201cSo what\u2019s the \u2018doctor\u2019 for?\u201d\n \u201cEducation.\u201d Her voice didn\u2019t change, but I get the impression that the questions annoyed her. This makes me strangely happy.\n \u201cOkay, Dr. Counselor, what are you supposed to counsel me about? I\u2019m not crazy. I know who Therese was, I know what she did, I know that she used to walk around in my body.\u201d I put the doll back in its spot next to a glass cube that could be a paperweight. \u201cBut I\u2019m not her. This is my body, and I\u2019m not going to kill myself just so Alice and Mitch can have their baby girl back.\u201d\n \u201cTerry, no one\u2019s asking you to kill yourself. Nobody can even make you into who you were before.\u201d\n \u201cYeah? Then what are they paying you for, then?\u201d\n \u201cLet me try to explain. Please, sit down. Please.\u201d\n I look around for a clock and finally spot one on a high shelf. I mentally set the timer to five minutes and sit opposite her, hands on my knees. \u201cShoot.\u201d\n \u201cYour parents asked me to talk to you because I\u2019ve helped other people in your situation, people who\u2019ve overdosed on Z.\u201d\n \u201cHelp them what? Pretend to be something they\u2019re not?\u201d\n \u201cI help them take back what they are. Your experience of the world tells you that Therese was some other person. No one\u2019s denying that. But you\u2019re in a situation where biologically and legally, you\u2019re Therese Klass. Do you have plans for dealing with that?\u201d\n As a matter of fact I do, and it involves getting the hell out as soon as possible. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d I say.\n \u201cWhat about Alice and Mitch?\u201d\n I shrug. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re still your parents, and you\u2019re still their child. The overdose convinced you that you\u2019re a new person, but that hasn\u2019t changed who they are. They\u2019re still responsible for you, and they still care for you.\u201d\n \u201cNot much I can do about that.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s a fact of your life. You have two people who love you, and you\u2019re going to be with each other for the rest of your lives. You\u2019re going to have to figure out how to relate to each other. Zen may have burned the bridge between you and your past life, but you can build that bridge again.\u201d\n \u201cDoc, I don\u2019t want to build that bridge. Look, Alice and Mitch seem like nice people, but if I was looking for parents, I\u2019d pick someone else.\u201d\n Dr. Mehldau smiles. \u201cNone of us gets to choose our parents, Terry.\u201d\n I\u2019m not in the mood to laugh. I nod toward the clock. \u201cThis is a waste of time.\u201d\n She leans forward. I think she\u2019s going to try to touch me, but she doesn\u2019t. \u201cTerry, you\u2019re not going to disappear if we talk about what happened to you. You\u2019ll still be here. The only difference is that you\u2019ll reclaim those memories as your own. You can get your old life back and choose your new life.\u201d\n Sure, it\u2019s that easy. I get to sell my soul and keep it too.\n I can\u2019t remember my first weeks in the hospital, though Dr. S says I was awake. At some point I realized that time was passing, or rather, that there was a me who was passing through time. I had lasagna for dinner yesterday, I am having meat loaf today. I am this girl in a bed. I think I realized this and forgot it several times before I could hold onto it.\n Every day was mentally exhausting, because everything was so relentlessly new. I stared at the TV remote for a half hour, the name for it on the tip of my tongue, and it wasn\u2019t until the nurse picked it up and turned on the TV for me that I thought: Remote. And then sometimes, this was followed by a raft of other ideas: TV. Channel. Gameshow.\n People were worse. They called me by a strange name, and they expected things of me. But to me, every visitor, from the night shift nurse to the janitor to Alice and Mitch Klass, seemed equally important\u2014which is to say, not important at all.\n Except for Dr. S. He was there from the beginning, and so he was familiar before I met him. He belonged to me like my own body.\n But everything else about the world\u2014the names, the details, the facts\u2014had to be hauled into the sunlight, one by one. My brain was like an attic, chock full of old and interesting things jumbled together in no order at all.\n I only gradually understood that somebody must have owned this house before me. And then I realized the house was haunted.\n After the Sunday service, I\u2019m caught in a stream of people. They lean across the pews to hug Alice and Mitch, then me. They pat my back, squeeze my arms, kiss my cheeks. I know from brief dips into Therese\u2019s memories that many of these people are as emotionally close as aunts or uncles. And any of them, if Therese were ever in trouble, would take her in, feed her, and give her a bed to sleep in.\n This is all very nice, but the constant petting has me ready to scream.\n All I want to do is get back home and take off this dress. I had no choice but to wear one of Therese\u2019s girly-girl extravaganzas. Her closet was full of them, and I finally found one that fit, if not comfortably. She loved these dresses, though. They were her floral print flak jackets. Who could doubt the purity of a girl in a high-necked Laura Ashley?\n We gradually make our way to the vestibule, then to the sidewalk and the parking lot, under assault the entire way. I stop trying to match their faces to anything in Therese\u2019s memories.\n At our car a group of teenagers take turns on me, the girls hugging me tight, the boys leaning into me with half hugs: shoulders together, pelvises apart. One of the girls, freckled with soft red curls falling past her shoulders, hangs back for awhile, then abruptly clutches me and whispers into my ear, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay, Miss T.\u201d Her tone is intense, like she\u2019s passing a secret message.\n A man moves through the crowd, arms open, smiling broadly. He\u2019s in his late twenties or early thirties, his hair cut in a choppy gelled style that\u2019s ten years too young for him. He\u2019s wearing pressed khakis, a blue Oxford rolled up at the forearms, a checked tie loosened at the throat.\n He smothers me in a hug, his cologne like another set of arms. He\u2019s easy to find in Therese\u2019s memories: This is Jared, the Youth Pastor. He was the most spiritually vibrant person Therese knew, and the object of her crush.\n \u201cIt\u2019s so good to have you back, Therese,\u201d he says. His cheek is pressed to mine. We\u2019ve missed you.\u201d\n A few months before her overdose, the youth group was coming back from a weekend-long retreat in the church\u2019s converted school bus. Late into the trip, near midnight, Jared sat next to her, and she fell asleep leaning against him, inhaling that same cologne.\n \u201cI bet you have,\u201d I say. \u201cWatch the hands, Jared.\u201d\n His smile doesn\u2019t waver, his hands are still on my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n \u201cOh please, you heard me.\u201d\n He drops his hands, and looks questioningly at my father. He can do sincerity pretty well. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, Therese, but if\u2014\u201d\n I give him a look that makes him back up a step. At some point later in the trip Therese awoke with Jared still next to her, slumped in the seat, eyes closed and mouth open. His arm was resting between her thighs, a thumb against her knee. She was wearing shorts, and his flesh on hers was hot. His forearm was inches from her warm crotch.\n Therese believed that he was asleep.\n She believed, too, that it was the rumbling of the school bus that shifted Jared\u2019s arm into contact with the crease of her shorts. Therese froze, flushed with arousal and embarrassment.\n \u201cTry to work it out, Jared.\u201d I get in the car.\n The big question I can help answer, Dr. S said, is why there is consciousness. Or, going back to my favorite metaphor, if the Parliament is making all the decisions, why have a Queen at all?\n He\u2019s got theories, of course. He thinks the Queen is all about storytelling. The brain needs a story that gives all these decisions a sense of purpose, a sense of continuity, so it can remember them and use them in future decisions. The brain can\u2019t keep track of the trillions of possible other decisions it could have made every moment; it needs one decision, and it needs a who, and a why. The brain lays down the memories, and the consciousness stamps them with identity: I did this, I did that. Those memories become the official record, the precedents that the Parliament uses to help make future decisions.\n \u201cThe Queen, you see, is a figurehead,\u201d Dr. S said. \u201cShe represents the kingdom, but she isn\u2019t the kingdom itself, or even in control of it.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a figurehead,\u201d I said.\n Dr. S laughed. \u201cMe neither. Nobody does.\u201d\n Dr. Mehldau\u2019s therapy involves occasional joint sessions with Alice and Mitch, reading aloud from Therese\u2019s old diaries, and home movies. Today\u2019s video features a pre-teen Therese dressed in sheets, surrounded by kids in bathrobes, staring fixedly at a doll in a manger.\n Dr. Mehldau asks me what Therese was thinking then. Was she enjoying playing Mary? Did she like being on stage?\n \u201cHow would I know?\u201d\n \u201cThen imagine it. What do you think Therese is thinking here?\u201d\n She tells me to do that a lot. Imagine what she\u2019s thinking. Just pretend. Put yourself in her shoes. In her book she calls this \u201creclaiming.\u201d She makes up a lot of her own terms, then defines them however she wants, without research to back her up. Compared to the neurology texts Dr. S lent me, Dr. Mehldau\u2019s little book is an Archie comic with footnotes.\n \u201cYou know what, Therese was a good Christian girl, so she probably loved it.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n The wise men come on stage, three younger boys. They plop down their gifts and their lines, and the look on Therese\u2019s face is wary. Her line is coming up.\n Therese was petrified of screwing up. Everybody would be staring at her. I can almost see the congregation in the dark behind the lights. Alice and Mitch are out there, and they\u2019re waiting for every line. My chest tightens, and I realize I\u2019m holding my breath.\n Dr. Mehldau\u2019s eyes on mine are studiously neutral.\n \u201cYou know what?\u201d I have no idea what I\u2019m going to say next. I\u2019m stalling for time. I shift my weight in the big beige chair and move a leg underneath me. \u201cThe thing I like about Buddhism is Buddhists understand that they\u2019ve been screwed by a whole string of previous selves. I had nothing to do with the decisions Therese made, the good or bad karma she\u2019d acquired.\u201d\n This is a riff I\u2019ve been thinking about in Therese\u2019s big girly bedroom. \u201cSee, Therese was a Christian, so she probably thought by overdosing that she\u2019d be born again, all her sins forgiven. It\u2019s the perfect drug for her: suicide without the corpse.\u201d\n \u201cWas she thinking about suicide that night?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I could spend a couple weeks mining through Therese\u2019s memories, but frankly, I\u2019m not interested. Whatever she was thinking, she wasn\u2019t born again. I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m still saddled with her baggage. I am Therese\u2019s donkey. I\u2019m a karma donkey.\u201d\n Dr. Mehldau nods. \u201cDr. Subramaniam is Buddhist, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, but what\u2019s . . . ?\u201d It clicks. I roll my eyes. Dr. S and I talked about transference, and I know that my crush on him was par for the course. And it\u2019s true that I spend a lot of time\u2014still\u2014thinking about fucking the man. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m wrong. \u201cThis is not about that,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this on my own.\u201d\n She doesn\u2019t fight me on that. \u201cWouldn\u2019t a Buddhist say that you and Therese share the same soul? Self\u2019s an illusion. So there\u2019s no rider in charge, no donkey. There\u2019s just you.\u201d\n \u201cJust forget it,\u201d I say.\n \u201cLet\u2019s follow this, Terry. Don\u2019t you feel you have a responsibility to your old self? Your old self\u2019s parents, your old friends? Maybe there\u2019s karma you owe.\u201d\n \u201cAnd who are you responsible to, Doctor? Who\u2019s your patient? Therese, or me?\u201d\n She says nothing for a moment, then: \u201cI\u2019m responsible to you.\u201d\n You.\n You swallow, surprised that the pills taste like cinnamon. The effect of the drug is intermittent at first. You realize that you\u2019re in the back seat of a car, the cellphone in your hand, your friends laughing around you. You\u2019re talking to your mother. If you concentrate, you can remember answering the phone, and telling her which friend\u2019s house you\u2019re staying at tonight. Before you can say goodbye, you\u2019re stepping out of the car. The car is parked, your phone is away\u2014and you remember saying goodnight to your mother and riding for a half hour before finding this parking garage. Joelly tosses her red curls and tugs you toward the stairwell: Come on, Miss T!\n Then you look up and realize that you\u2019re on the sidewalk outside an all-ages club, and you\u2019re holding a ten dollar bill, ready to hand it to the bouncer. The music thunders every time the door swings open. You turn to Joelly and\u2014\n You\u2019re in someone else\u2019s car. On the Interstate. The driver is a boy you met hours ago, his name is Rush but you haven\u2019t asked if that\u2019s his first name or his last. In the club you leaned into each other and talked loud over the music about parents and food and the difference between the taste of a fresh cigarette in your mouth and the smell of stale smoke. But then you realize that there\u2019s a cigarette in your mouth, you took it from Rush\u2019s pack yourself, and you don\u2019t like cigarettes. Do you like it now? You don\u2019t know. Should you take it out, or keep smoking? You scour your memories, but can discover no reason why you decided to light the cigarette, no reason why you got into the car with this boy. You start to tell yourself a story: he must be a trustworthy person, or you wouldn\u2019t have gotten into the car. You took that one cigarette because the boy\u2019s feelings would have been hurt.\n You\u2019re not feeling like yourself tonight. And you like it. You take another drag off the cigarette. You think back over the past few hours, and marvel at everything you\u2019ve done, all without that constant weight of self-reflection: worry, anticipation, instant regret. Without the inner voice constantly critiquing you.\n Now the boy is wearing nothing but boxer shorts, and he\u2019s reaching up to a shelf to get a box of cereal, and his back is beautiful. There is hazy light outside the small kitchen window. He pours Froot Loops into a bowl for you, and he laughs, though quietly because his mother is asleep in the next room. He looks at your face and frowns. He asks you what\u2019s the matter. You look down, and you\u2019re fully dressed. You think back, and realize that you\u2019ve been in this boy\u2019s apartment for hours. You made out in his bedroom, and the boy took off his clothes, and you kissed his chest and ran your hands along his legs. You let him put his hand under your shirt and cup your breasts, but you didn\u2019t go any further. Why didn\u2019t you have sex? Did he not interest you? No\u2014you were wet. You were excited. Did you feel guilty? Did you feel ashamed?\n What were you thinking?\n When you get home there will be hell to pay. Your parents will be furious, and worse, they will pray for you. The entire church will pray for you. Everyone will know. And no one will ever look at you the same again.\n Now there\u2019s a cinnamon taste in your mouth, and you\u2019re sitting in the boy\u2019s car again, outside a convenience store. It\u2019s afternoon. Your cell phone is ringing. You turn off the cell phone and put it back in your purse. You swallow, and your throat is dry. That boy\u2014Rush\u2014is buying you another bottle of water. What was it you swallowed? Oh, yes. You think back, and remember putting all those little pills in your mouth. Why did you take so many? Why did you take another one at all? Oh, yes.\n Voices drift up from the kitchen. It\u2019s before 6am, and I just want to pee and get back to sleep, but then I realize they\u2019re talking about me.\n \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even walk the same. The way she holds herself, the way she talks . . . \u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all those books Dr. Subramaniam gave her. She\u2019s up past one every night. Therese never read like that, not science.\u201d\n \u201cNo, it\u2019s not just the words, it\u2019s how she sounds. That low voice . . . \u201d She sobs. \u201cOh hon, I didn\u2019t know it would be this way. It\u2019s like she\u2019s right, it\u2019s like it isn\u2019t her at all.\u201d\n He doesn\u2019t say anything. Alice\u2019s crying grows louder, subsides. The clink of dishes in the sink. I step back, and Mitch speaks again.\n \u201cMaybe we should try the camp,\u201d he says.\n \u201cNo, no, no! Not yet. Dr. Mehldau says she\u2019s making progress. We\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOf course she\u2019s going to say that.\u201d\n \u201cYou said you\u2019d try this, you said you\u2019d give this a chance.\u201d The anger cuts through the weeping, and Mitch mumbles something apologetic. I creep back to my bedroom, but I still have to pee, so I make a lot of noise going back out. Alice comes to the bottom of the stairs. \u201cAre you all right, honey?\u201d\n I keep my face sleepy and walk into the bathroom. I shut the door and sit down on the toilet in the dark.\n What fucking camp?\n \u201cLet\u2019s try again,\u201d Dr. Mehldau said. \u201cSomething pleasant and vivid.\u201d\n I\u2019m having trouble concentrating. The brochure is like a bomb in my pocket. It wasn\u2019t hard to find, once I decided to look for it. I want to ask Dr. Mehldau about the camp, but I know that once I bring it into the open, I\u2019ll trigger a showdown between the doctor and the Klasses, with me in the middle.\n \u201cKeep your eyes closed,\u201d she says. \u201cThink about Therese\u2019s tenth birthday. In her diary, she wrote that was the best birthday she\u2019d ever had. Do you remember Sea World?\u201d\n \u201cVaguely.\u201d I could see dolphins jumping\u2014two at a time, three at a time. It had been sunny and hot. With every session it was getting easier for me to pop into Therese\u2019s memories. Her life was on DVD, and I had the remote.\n \u201cDo you remember getting wet at the Namu and Shamu show?\u201d\n I laughed. \u201cI think so.\u201d I could see the metal benches, the glass wall just in front of me, the huge shapes in the blue-green water. \u201cThey had the whales flip their big tail fins. We got drenched.\u201d\n \u201cCan you picture who was there with you? Where are your parents?\u201d\n There was a girl, my age, I can\u2019t remember her name. The sheets of water were coming down on us and we were screaming and laughing. Afterward my parents toweled us off. They must have been sitting up high, out of the splash zone. Alice looked much younger: happier, and a little heavier. She was wider at the hips. This was before she started dieting and exercising, when she was Mom-sized.\n My eyes pop open. \u201cOh God.\u201d\n \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014it was just . . . like you said. Vivid.\u201d That image of a younger Alice still burns. For the first time I realize how sad she is now.\n \u201cI\u2019d like a joint session next time,\u201d I say.\n \u201cReally? All right. I\u2019ll talk to Alice and Mitch. Is there anything in particular you want to talk about?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. We need to talk about Therese.\u201d\n Dr. S says everybody wants to know if the original neural map, the old Queen, can come back. Once the map to the map is lost, can you find it again? And if you do, then what happens to the new neural map, the new Queen?\n \u201cNow, a good Buddhist would tell you that this question is unimportant. After all, the cycle of existence is not just between lives. Samsara is every moment. The self continuously dies and recreates itself.\u201d\n \u201cAre you a good Buddhist?\u201d I asked him.\n He smiled. \u201cOnly on Sunday mornings.\u201d\n \u201cYou go to church?\u201d\n \u201cI golf.\u201d\n There\u2019s a knock and I open my eyes. Alice steps into my room, a stack of folded laundry in her arms. \u201cOh!\u201d\n I\u2019ve rearranged the room, pushing the bed into the corner to give me a few square feet of free space the floor.\n Her face goes through a few changes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re praying.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n She sighs, but it\u2019s a mock-sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d She moves around me and sets the laundry on the bed. She picks up the book there, Entering the Stream. \u201cDr. Subramaniam gave you this?\u201d\n She\u2019s looking at the passage I\u2019ve highlighted. But loving kindness\u2014maitri\u2014toward ourselves doesn\u2019t mean getting rid of anything. The point is not to try to change ourselves. Meditation practice isn\u2019t about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better. It\u2019s about befriending who we already are.\n \u201cWell.\u201d She sets the book down, careful to leave it open to the same page. \u201cThat sounds a bit like Dr. Mehldau.\u201d\n I laugh. \u201cYeah, it does. Did she tell you I wanted you and Mitch to be at the next session?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll be there.\u201d She works around the room, picking up t-shirts and underwear. I stand up to get out of the way. Somehow she manages to straighten up as she moves\u2014righting books that had fallen over, setting Boo W. Bear back to his place on the bed, sweeping an empty chip bag into the garbage can\u2014so that as she collects my dirty laundry she\u2019s cleaning the entire room, like the Cat in the Hat\u2019s cleaner-upper machine.\n \u201cAlice, in the last session I remembered being at Sea World, but there was a girl next to me. Next to Therese.\u201d\n \u201cSea World? Oh, that was the Hammel girl, Marcy. They took you to Ohio with them on their vacation that year.\u201d\n \u201cWho did?\u201d\n \u201cThe Hammels. You were gone all week. All you wanted for your birthday was spending money for the trip.\u201d\n \u201cYou weren\u2019t there?\u201d\n She picks up the jeans I left at the foot of the bed. \u201cWe always meant to go to Sea World, but your father and I never got out there.\u201d\n \u201cThis is our last session,\u201d I say.\n Alice, Mitch, Dr. Mehldau: I have their complete attention.\n The doctor, of course, is the first to recover. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019ve got something you want to tell us.\u201d\n \u201cOh yeah.\u201d\n Alice seems frozen, holding herself in check. Mitch rubs the back of his neck, suddenly intent on the carpet.\n \u201cI\u2019m not going along with this anymore.\u201d I make a vague gesture. \u201cEverything: the memory exercises, all this imagining of what Therese felt. I finally figured it out. It doesn\u2019t matter to you if I\u2019m Therese or not. You just want me to think I\u2019m her. I\u2019m not going along with the manipulation anymore.\u201d\n Mitch shakes his head. \u201cHoney, you took a drug.\u201d He glances at me, looks back at his feet. \u201cIf you took LSD and saw God, that doesn\u2019t mean you really saw God. Nobody\u2019s trying to manipulate you, we\u2019re trying to undo the manipulation.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Mitch. You all keep acting like I\u2019m schizophrenic, that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s real or not. Well, part of the problem is that the longer I talk to Dr. Mehldau here, the more fucked up I am.\u201d\n Alice gasps.\n Dr. Mehldau puts out a hand to soothe her, but her eyes are on me. \u201cTerry, what your father\u2019s trying to say is that even though you feel like a new person, there\u2019s a you that existed before the drug. That exists now.\u201d\n \u201cYeah? You know all those OD-ers in your book who say they\u2019ve \u2018reclaimed\u2019 themselves? Maybe they only feel like their old selves.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019re fooling themselves. They\u2019ve come to accept the parts of themselves they\u2019ve lost, the family members they\u2019ve left behind. They\u2019re people like you.\u201d She regards me with that standard-issue look of concern that doctors pick up with their diplomas. \u201cDo you really want to feel like an orphan the rest of your life?\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d From out of nowhere, tears well in my eyes. I cough to clear my throat, and the tears keep coming, until I smear them off on my arm. I feel like I\u2019ve been sucker punched. \u201cHey, look Alice, just like you,\u201d I say.\n \u201cIt\u2019s normal,\u201d Dr. Mehldau says. \u201cWhen you woke up in the hospital, you felt completely alone. You felt like a brand new person, no family, no friends. And you\u2019re still just starting down this road. In a lot of ways you\u2019re not even two years old.\u201d\n \u201cDamn you\u2019re good,\u201d I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see that one coming.\u201d\n \u201cPlease, don\u2019t leave. Let\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not leaving yet.\u201d I\u2019m at the door, pulling my backpack from the peg by the door. I dig into the pocket, and pull out the brochure. \u201cYou know about this?\u201d\n Alice speaks for the first time. \u201cOh honey, no . . . \u201d\n Dr. Mehldau takes it from me, frowning. On the front is a nicely posed picture of a smiling teenage boy hugging relieved parents. She looks at Alice and Mitch. \u201cAre you considering this?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s their big stick, Dr. Mehldau. If you can\u2019t come through for them, or I bail out, boom. You know what goes on there?\u201d\n She opens the pages, looking at pictures of the cabins, the obstacle course, the big lodge where kids just like me engage in \u201cintense group sessions with trained counselors\u201d where they can \u201crecover their true identities.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cTheir approach is different than mine . . . \u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, doc. Their approach sounds an awful lot like \u2018reclaiming.\u2019 I got to hand it to you, you had me going for awhile. Those visualization exercises? I was getting so good that I could even visualize stuff that never happened. I bet you could visualize me right into Therese\u2019s head.\u201d\n I turn to Alice and Mitch. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a decision to make. Dr. Mehldau\u2019s program is a bust. So are you sending me off to brainwashing camp or not?\u201d\n Mitch has his arm around his wife. Alice, amazingly, is dry-eyed. Her eyes are wide, and she\u2019s staring at me like a stranger.\n It rains the entire trip back from Baltimore, and it\u2019s still raining when we pull up to the house. Alice and I run to the porch steps, illuminated by the glare of headlights. Mitch waits until Alice unlocks the door and we move inside, and then pulls away.\n \u201cDoes he do that a lot?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cHe likes to drive when he\u2019s upset.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d Alice goes through the house, turning on lights. I follow her into the kitchen.\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be all right.\u201d She opens the refrigerator door and crouches down. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t know what to do with you.\u201d\n \u201cHe wants to put me in the camp, then.\u201d\n \u201cOh, not that. He just never had a daughter who talked back to him before.\u201d She carries a Tupperware cake holder to the table. \u201cI made carrot cake. Can you get down the plates?\u201d\n She\u2019s such a small woman. Face to face, she comes up only to my chin. The hair on the top of her head is thin, made thinner by the rain, and her scalp is pink.\n \u201cI\u2019m not Therese. I never will be Therese.\u201d\n \u201cOh I know,\u201d she says, half sighing. And she does know it; I can see it in her face. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you look so much like her.\u201d\n I laugh. \u201cI can dye my hair. Maybe get a nose job.\u201d\n \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work, I\u2019d still recognize you.\u201d She pops the lid and sets it aside. The cake is a wheel with icing that looks half an inch thick. Miniature candy carrots line the edge.\n \u201cWow, you made that before we left? Why?\u201d\n Alice shrugs, and cuts into it. She turns the knife on its side and uses the blade to lever a huge triangular wedge onto my plate. \u201cI thought we might need it, one way or another.\u201d\n She places the plate in front of me, and touches me lightly on the arm. \u201cI know you want to move out. I know you may never want to come back.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop you. But wherever you go, you\u2019ll still be my daughter, whether you like it or not. You don\u2019t get to decide who loves you.\u201d\n \u201cAlice . . . \u201d\n \u201cShssh. Eat your cake.\u201d\n Originally published in Asimov\u2019 Science Fiction, September 2005.\n Daryl Gregory writes genre-mixing novels, stories, and comics.

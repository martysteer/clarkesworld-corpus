It\u2019s been a fairly chaotic time for magazines and publishing in general. I suppose that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve enjoyed it as much as I have. In the grand scheme of things, Clarkesworld is still a child, but digitally speaking we\u2019re older than most.\n My mind wanders sometimes when I think of these things. It can be dangerous when your imagination runs wild and casts digital publishers in a post-apocalyptic series as a rag-tag group of kids adapting to a new world in which no one thinks they can survive . . .\n Episode 0: A New World \u2013 Pilot, Unreleased\n Only available as a bonus feature on the Director\u2019s Cut DVD. This episode was considered too harsh by executives due to its gritty portrayal of the high mortality rate amongst the children in the early years. Some footage from this episode was later retooled for use in flashbacks throughout the series.\n Episode 1: The Elders\n Originally scheduled as episode two, \u201cThe Elders\u201d was moved because network executives felt that this would make a more accessible entry point in the absence of the pilot. The story centered on the children\u2019s discovery of a bunker in the ruins of a city. Upon exploration, they are captured by \u201celders\u201d and introduced to a shadowy corporate-type figurehead that was supposed to become the big baddy of the series arc. Several minutes are spent on his Paper Empire monologue. This speech provided many fan favorite quotes, including \u201cBow down, you pixel-stained technopeasant wretches!\u201d and \u201cWebscabs! Each and every one of you!\u201d With the help of a few sympathetic elders that had been waiting for someone to show them the way, the gang escapes, but only after a lengthy chase scene.\n Episode 2: Exposure\n Since this episode was originally scheduled to be before \u201cElders of Publishing,\u201d none of the characters introduced in that episode are featured in this one. Instead, the gang crosses paths with a Love Cult that keeps its followers in check by addicting them to a blue and glowy drug called \u201cExposure.\u201d The gang spends most of the episode trying to corner various members and convince them that there is more to life than exposure. Originally, this episode was to feature a cameo by Harlan Ellison as the owner of a rehab clinic, but his deprogramming scenes were considered controversial and inevitably cut. Fans of the show have developed complex conspiracy theories about this still lost footage.\n Episode 3: To Serve for an Eternity\n The first episode shown in intended order, \u201cTo Serve for an Eternity\u201d features the kids coming across one of the Elder camps and discovering the evils of contractual slavery. Network executives uncomfortable with the portrayal of the conditions insisted on edits that would eventually lead the director to resign. What results is a mish-mash of corporate propaganda and pontificating on the rights of others, but no real resolution. Universally disliked by fans.\n Episode 4: Utopia\n Mercifully, \u201cUtopia\u201d was the last episode of the series to be filmed. By this point in the series, most of the writing staff had resigned over professional differences caused by network micromanaging. The inclusion of a performance of \u201cPixels of Sunshine\u201d by failed boy band Digitally Speaking, was the direct result of a five-minute air time shortage and network nepotism. The band\u2019s vacant lip-synching had the unanticipated effect of making their portrayal of the Shangri-La society a bit creepy and uncomfortable. As the show\u2019s original Director said, \u201cLike a gift from the gods, the show\u2019s executives screwed up so badly that the fans finally got to see what we had originally intended for this series.\u201d\n As you can see, I\u2019m having some focus issues today.\n Where was I? Oh yes. Let\u2019s just leave that for next month, when we can celebrate Clarkesworld\u2019s seventh anniversary, reminisce about where we\u2019ve been, and speculate on where we\u2019re going.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

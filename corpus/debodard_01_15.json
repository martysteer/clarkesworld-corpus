The brew is light, with a pleasant, grassy taste. Do not over-steep it, lest it become bitter.\nAfter the funeral, Quang Tu walked back to his compartment, and sat down alone, staring sightlessly at the slow ballet of bots cleaning the small room\u2014the metal walls pristine already, with every trace of Mother\u2019s presence or of her numerous mourners scrubbed away. He\u2019d shut down the communal network\u2014couldn\u2019t bear to see the potted summaries of Mother\u2019s life, the endlessly looping vids of the funeral procession, the hundred thousand bystanders gathered at the gravesite to say goodbye, vultures feasting on the flesh of the grieving\u2014they hadn\u2019t known her, they hadn\u2019t cared\u2014and all their offerings of flowers were worth as much as the insurances of the Embroidered Guard.\n\u201cBig brother, I know you\u2019re here,\u201d a voice said, on the other side of the door he\u2019d locked. \u201cLet me in, please?\u201d\nOf course. Quang Tu didn\u2019t move. \u201cI said I wanted to be alone,\u201d he said.\nA snort that might have been amusement. \u201cFine. If you insist on doing it that way . . . \u201d\nHis sister, The Tiger in the Banyan, materialized in the kitchen, hovering over the polished counter, near the remains of his morning tea. Of course, it wasn\u2019t really her: she was a Mind encased in the heartroom of a spaceship, far too heavy to leave orbit; and what she projected down onto the planet was an avatar, a perfectly rendered, smaller version of herself\u2014elegant and sharp, with a small, blackened spot on her hull which served as a mourning band. \u201cTypical,\u201d she said, hovering around the compartment. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shut yourself away.\u201d\n\u201cI can if I want to,\u201d Quang Tu said\u2014feeling like he was eight years old again, trying to argue with her\u2014as if it had ever made sense. She seldom got angry\u2014mindships didn\u2019t, mostly; he wasn\u2019t sure if that was the overall design of the Imperial Workshops, or the simple fact that her lifespan was counted in centuries, and his (and Mother\u2019s) in mere decades. He\u2019d have thought she didn\u2019t grieve, either; but she was changed\u2014something in the slow, careful deliberation of her movements, as if anything and everything might break her . . .\nThe Tiger in the Banyan hovered near the kitchen table, watching the bots. She could hack them, easily; no security worth anything in the compartment. Who would steal bots, anyway?\nWhat he valued most had already been taken away.\n\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d he said. But he didn\u2019t want to be alone; not really. He didn\u2019t want to hear the silence in the compartment; the clicking sounds of the bots\u2019 legs on metal, bereft of any warmth or humanity.\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan asked.\nShe didn\u2019t need to say what; and he didn\u2019t do her the insult of pretending she did. \u201cWhat would be the point?\u201d\n\u201cTo talk.\u201d Her voice was uncannily shrewd. \u201cIt helps. At least, I\u2019m told it does.\u201d\nQuang Tu heard, again, the voice of the Embroidered Guard; the slow, measured tones commiserating on his loss; and then the frown, and the knife-thrust in his gut.\nYou must understand that your mother\u2019s work was very valuable . . .\nThe circumstances are not ordinary . . .\nThe slow, pompous tones of the scholar; the convoluted official language he knew by heart\u2014the only excuses the state would make to him, couched in the over-formality of memorials and edicts.\n\u201cShe\u2014\u201d he took a deep, trembling breath\u2014was it grief, or anger? \u201cI should have had her mem-implants.\u201d Forty-nine days after the funeral; when there was time for the labs to have decanted and stabilized Mother\u2019s personality and memories, and added her to the ranks of the ancestors on file. It wasn\u2019t her, it would never be her, of course\u2014just a simulation meant to share knowledge and advice. But it would have been something. It would have filled the awful emptiness in his life.\n\u201cIt was your right, as the eldest,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan said. Something in the tone of her voice . . .\n\u201cYou disapprove? You wanted them?\u201d Families had fallen out before, on more trivial things.\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d A burst of careless, amused laughter. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. What use would I have, for them. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d She hesitated, banking left and right in uncertainty. \u201cYou need something more. Beyond Mother.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t something more!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t there,\u201d Quang Tu said. She\u2019d been away on her journeys, ferrying people back and forth between the planets that made up the Dai Viet Empire; leaping from world to world, with hardly a care for planet-bound humans. She\u2014she hadn\u2019t seen Mother\u2019s unsteady hands, dropping the glass; heard the sound of its shattering like a gunshot; hadn\u2019t carried her back to bed every evening, tracking the progress of the disease by the growing lightness in his arms\u2014by the growing sharpness of ribs, protruding under taut skin.\nMother had remained herself until almost the end\u2014sharp and lucid and utterly aware of what was happening, scribbling in the margins of her team\u2019s reports and sending her instructions to the new space station\u2019s building site, as if nothing untoward had ever happened to her. Had it been a blessing; or a curse? He didn\u2019t have answers; and he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted that awful certainty to shatter him.\n\u201cI was here,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan said, gently, slowly. \u201cAt the end.\u201d\nQuang Tu closed his eyes, again, smelling antiseptic and the sharp odor of painkillers; and the sour smell of a body finally breaking down, finally failing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You were. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan moved closer to him; brushed against his shoulder\u2014ghostly, almost intangible, the breath that had been beside him all his childhood. \u201cBut nevertheless. Your life got eaten up, taking care of Mother. And you can say you were only doing what a filial son ought to do; you can say it didn\u2019t matter. But . . . it\u2019s done now, big brother. It\u2019s over.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not, he wanted to say, but the words rang hollow in his own ears. He moved, stared at the altar; at the holo of Mother\u2014over the offering of tea and rice, the food to sustain her on her journey through Hell. It cycled through vids\u2014Mother, heavily pregnant with his sister, moving with the characteristic arrested slowness of Mind-bearers; Mother standing behind Quang Tu and The Tiger in the Banyan in front of the ancestral altar for Grandfather\u2019s death anniversary; Mother, accepting her Hoang Minh Medal from the then Minister of Investigation; and one before the diagnosis, when she\u2019d already started to become frailer and thinner\u2014insisting on going back to the lab; to her abandoned teams and research . . .\nHe thought, again, of the Embroidered Guard; of the words tightening around his neck like an executioner\u2019s garrote. How dare he. How dare they all. \u201cShe came home,\u201d he said, not sure how to voice the turmoil within him. \u201cTo us. To her family. In the end. It meant something, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe Tiger in the Banyan\u2019s voice was wry, amused. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Empress that comforted her when she woke at night, coughing her lungs out, was it?\u201d It was . . . treason to much as think this, let alone utter it; though the Embroidered Guard would make allowances for grief, and anger; and for Mother\u2019s continued usefulness to the service of the Empress. The truth was, neither of them much cared, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Empress that was by her side when she died.\u201d\nShe\u2019d clung to his hand, then, her eyes open wide, a network of blood within the whites, and the fear in her eyes. \u201cI\u2014please, child . . . \u201d He\u2019d stood, frozen; until, behind him, The Tiger in the Banyan whispered, \u201cThe lights in Sai Gon are green and red, the lamps in My Tho are bright and dim . . . \u201d\u2014 an Old Earth lullaby, the words stretched into the familiar, slow, comforting rhythm that he\u2019d unthinkingly taken up.\n\u201cGo home to study,\nI shall wait nine months, I shall wait ten autumns . . . \u201d\nShe\u2019d relaxed, then, against him; and they had gone on singing songs until\u2014he didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d died; when the eyes lost their luster, the face its usual sharpness. But he\u2019d risen from her deathbed with the song still in his mind; and an awful yawning gap in his world that nothing had closed.\nAnd then\u2014after the scattering of votive papers, after the final handful of earth thrown over the grave\u2014the Embroidered Guard.\nThe Embroidered Guard was young; baby-faced and callow, but he was already moving with the easy arrogance of the privileged. He\u2019d approached Quang Tu at the grave site, ostensibly to offer his condolences\u2014it had taken him all of two sentences to get to his true purpose; and to shatter Quang Tu\u2019s world, all over again.\nYour mother\u2019s mem-implants will go to Professor Tuyet Hoa, who will be best able to continue her research . . .\nOf course, the Empire required food; and crops of rice grown in space; and better, more reliable harvests to feed the masses. Of course he didn\u2019t want anyone to starve. But . . .\nMem-implants always went from parent to child. They were a family\u2019s riches and fortune; the continued advice of the ancestors, dispensed from beyond the grave. He\u2019d\u2014he\u2019d had the comfort, as Mother lay dying, to know that he wouldn\u2019t lose her. Not for real; not for long.\n\u201cThey took her away from us,\u201d Quang Tu said. \u201cAgain and again and again. And now, at the very end, when she ought to be ours\u2014when she should return to her family . . . \u201d\nThe Tiger in the Banyan didn\u2019t move; but a vid of the funeral appeared on one of the walls, projected through the communal network. There hadn\u2019t been enough space in the small compartment for people to pay their respects; the numerous callers had jammed into the corridors and alcoves, jostling each other in utter silence. \u201cShe\u2019s theirs in death, too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t care?\u201d\nA side-roll of the avatar, her equivalent of a shrug. \u201cNot as much as you do. I remember her. None of them do.\u201d\nExcept Tuyet Hoa.\nHe remembered Tuyet Hoa, too; coming to visit them on the third day after the New Year\u2014a student paying respect to her teacher, year after year; turning from an unattainable grown-up to a woman not much older than either he or The Tiger in the Banyan; though she\u2019d never lost her rigid awkwardness in dealing with them. No doubt, in Tuyet Hoa\u2019s ideal world, Mother wouldn\u2019t have had children; wouldn\u2019t have let anything distract her from her work.\n\u201cYou have to move on,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan said, slowly, gently; coming by his side to stare at the memorial altar. Bots gathered in the kitchen space, started putting together fresh tea to replace the three cups laid there. \u201cAccept that this is the way things are. They\u2019ll compensate, you know\u2014offer you higher-level promotions and make allowances. You\u2019ll find your path through civil service is . . . smoother.\u201d\nBribes or sops; payments for the loss of something that had no price. \u201cFair dealings,\u201d he said, slowly, bitterly. They knew exactly the value of what Tuyet Hoa was getting.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll only ruin your health and your career; and you know Mother wouldn\u2019t have wanted it.\u201d\nAs if . . . No, he was being unfair. Mother could be distant, and engrossed in her work; but she had always made time for them. She had raised them and played with them, telling them stories of princesses and fishermen and citadels vanished in one night; and, later on, going on long walks with Quang Tu in the gardens of Azure Dragons, delightedly pointing at a pine tree or at a crane flying overhead; and animatedly discussing Quang Tu\u2019s fledging career in the Ministry of Works.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to let this go sour,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan said. Below her, the bots brought a small, perfect cup of tea: green, fragrant liquid in a cup, the cracks in the pale celadon like those in eggshells.\nQuang Tu lifted the cup; breathed in the grassy, pleasant smell\u2014Mother would love it, even beyond the grave. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, laying the cup on the altar. The lie slipped out of him as softly, as easily as Mother\u2019s last exhaled breath.\nWu Long tea: those teas are carefully prepared by the tea masters to create a range of tastes and appearances. The brew is sweet with a hint of strength, each subsequent steeping revealing new nuances.\nTuyet Hoa woke up\u2014with a diffuse, growing sense of panic and fear, before she remembered the procedure.\nShe was alive. She was sane. At least . . .\nShe took in a deep, trembling breath; and realized she lay at home, in her bed. What had woken her up\u2014above the stubborn, panicked rhythm of her heart\u2014was a gentle nudge from the communal network, flashes of light relayed by the bots in the lightest phase of her sleep cycle. It wasn\u2019t her alarm; but rather, a notification that a message classified as \u201curgent\u201d had arrived for her.\nNot again.\nA nudge, at the back of her mind; a thread of thought that wasn\u2019t her own; reminding her she should look at it; that it was her responsibility as the new head of department to pay proper attention to messages from her subordinates.\nProfessor Duy Uyen. Of course.\nShe was as forceful in life as she had been in death; and, because she had been merely Hoa\u2019s head of department, and not a direct ancestor, she felt . . . wrong. Distant, as though she were speaking through a pane of glass.\nHoa was lucky, she knew\u2014receiving mem-implants that weren\u2019t your own family\u2019s could irretrievably scramble your brain, as fifteen different strangers with no consideration or compassion fought for control of your thoughts. She could hear Professor Duy Uyen; and sometimes others of Duy Uyen\u2019s ancestors, as remote ghosts; but that was it. It could have been so much worse.\nAnd it could have been so much better.\nShe got up, ignoring the insistent talk at the back of her mind, the constant urge to be dutiful; and padded into the kitchen.\nThe bots had already set aside Hoa\u2019s first tea of the day. She\u2019d used to take it at work, before the procedure; in the days of Professor Duy Uyen\u2019s sickness, when Duy Uyen came in to work thinner and paler every day\u2014and then became a succession of memorials and vid-calls, injecting her last, desperate instructions into the project before it slipped beyond her grasp. Hoa had enjoyed the quiet: it had kept the desperate knowledge of Professor Duy Uyen\u2019s coming death at bay\u2014the moment when they would all be adrift in the void of space, with no mindship to carry them onwards.\nNow Hoa enjoyed a different quiet. Now she drank her tea first thing in the morning\u2014hoping that, at this early hour, the mem-implants had no motive to kick in.\nNot that it had worked, this particular morning.\nShe sat down to breathe in the flavor\u2014the faint, nutty aroma poised perfectly between floral and sweet\u2014her hand trembling above the surface of the cup\u2014mentally blocking out Professor Duy Uyen for a few precious minutes; a few more stolen moments of tranquility before reality came crashing in.\nThen she gave in, and opened the message.\nIt was from Luong Ya Lan, the researcher who worked on the water\u2019s acidity balance. On the vid relayed from the laboratory, she was pale, but perfectly composed. \u201cMadam Hoa. I\u2019m sorry to have to inform you that the samples in Paddy Four have developed a fungal disease . . . \u201d\nProfessor Duy Uyen stirred in the depths of Hoa\u2019s brain, parsing the words as they came in\u2014accessing the station\u2019s private network and downloading the pertinent data\u2014the only mercy was that she wasn\u2019t faster than Hoa, and that it would take her fifteen to twenty minutes to parse all of it. The Professor had her suspicions, of course\u2014something about the particular rice strain; perhaps the changes drafted onto the plant to allow it to thrive under starlight, changes taken from the nocturnal honeydreamer on the Sixteenth Planet; perhaps the conditions in the paddy itself . . .\nHoa poured herself another cup of tea; and stared at the bots for a while. There was silence, the voice of Duy Uyen slowly fading away to nothingness in her thoughts. Alone. At last, alone.\nPaddy Four had last been checked on by Ya Lan\u2019s student, An Khang\u2014Khang was a smart and dedicated man, but not a particularly careful one; and she would have to ask him if he\u2019d checked himself, or through bots; and if he\u2019d followed protocols when he\u2019d done so.\nShe got up, and walked to the laboratory\u2014still silence in her mind. It was a short trip: the station was still being built, and the only thing in existence were the laboratory and the living quarters for all ten researchers\u2014a generous allocation of space, far grander than the compartments they would have been entitled to on any of their home stations.\nOutside, beyond the metal walls, the bots were hard at work\u2014reinforcing the structure, gradually layering a floor and walls onto the skeletal structure mapped out by the Grand Master of Design Harmony. She had no need to call up a vid of the outside on her implants to know they were out there, doing their part; just as she was. They weren\u2019t the only ones, of course: in the Imperial Workshops, alchemists were carefully poring over the design of the Mind that would one day watch over the entire station, making sure no flaws remained before they transferred him to the womb of his mother.\nIn the laboratory, Ya Lan was busying herself with the faulty paddy: she threw an apologetic glance at Hoa when Hoa walked in. \u201cYou got my message.\u201d\nHoa grimaced. \u201cYes. Have you had time to analyze?\u201d\nYa Lan flushed. \u201cNo.\u201d\nHoa knew. A proper analysis would require more than twenty minutes. But still . . . \u201cIf you had to make a rough guess?\u201d\n\u201cProbably the humidity.\u201d\n\u201cDid Khang\u2014\u201d\nYa Lan shook her head. \u201cI checked that too. No contaminants introduced in the paddy; and the last time he opened it was two weeks ago.\u201d The paddies were encased in glass, to make sure they could control the environment; and monitored by bots and the occasional scientist.\n\u201cFungi can lie dormant for more than two weeks,\u201d Hoa said, darkly.\nYa Lan sighed. \u201cOf course. But I still think it\u2019s the environment: it\u2019s a bit tricky to get right.\u201d\nHumid and dark; the perfect conditions for a host of other things to grow in the paddies\u2014not just the crops the Empire so desperately needed. The named planets were few; and fewer still that could bear the cultivation of food. Professor Duy Uyen had had a vision\u2014of a network of space stations like this one; of fish ponds and rice paddies grown directly under starlight, rather than on simulated Old Earth light; of staples that would not cost a fortune in resources to grow and maintain.\nAnd they had all believed in that vision, like a dying man offered a glimpse of a river. The Empress herself had believed it; so much that she had suspended the law for Professor Duy Uyen\u2019s sake, and granted her mem-implants to Hoa instead of to Duy Uyen\u2019s son: the quiet boy Hoa remembered from her New Year\u2019s visits, now grown to become a scholar in his own right\u2014he\u2019d been angry at the funeral, and why wouldn\u2019t he be? The mem-implants should have been his.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Hoa said. She knelt, calling up the data from the paddy onto her implants: her field of vision filled with a graph of the temperature throughout last month. The slight dips in the curve all corresponded to a check: a researcher opening the paddy.\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d Ya Lan asked; hesitant.\nHoa did not move. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the third paddy of that strain that fails in as many months . . . \u201d\nShe heard the question Ya Lan was not asking. The other strain\u2014the one in paddies One to Three\u2014had also failed some tests, but not at the same frequency.\nWithin her, Professor Duy Uyen stirred. It was the temperature, she pointed out, gently but firmly. The honeydreamer supported a very narrow range of temperatures; and the modified rice probably did, too.\nHoa bit back a savage answer. The changes might be flawed, but they were the best candidate they had.\nProfessor Duy Uyen shook her head. The strain in paddies One to Three was better: a graft from a lifeform of an unnumbered and unsettled planet, P Huong Van\u2014luminescents, an insect flying in air too different to be breathable by human beings. They had been Professor Duy Uyen\u2019s favored option.\nHoa didn\u2019t like the luminescents. The air of P Huong Van had a different balance of khi-elements: it was rich in fire, and anything would set it ablaze\u2014flame-storms were horrifically common, charring trees to cinders, and birds in flight to blackened skeletons. Aboard a space station, fire was too much of a danger. Professor Duy Uyen had argued that the Mind that would ultimately control the space station could be designed to accept an unbalance of khi-elements; could add water to the atmosphere to reduce the chances of a firestorm onboard.\nHoa had no faith in this. Modifying a Mind had a high cost, far above that of regulating temperature in a rice paddy. She pulled up the data from the paddies; though of course she knew Professor Duy Uyen would have reviewed it before her.\nProfessor Duy Uyen was polite enough not to chide Hoa; though Hoa could feel her disapproval like the weight of a blade\u2014it was odd, in so many ways, how the refinement process had changed Professor Duy Uyen; how, with all the stabilization adjustments, all the paring down of the unnecessary emotions, the simulation in her mind was utterly, heartbreakingly different from the woman she had known: all the keenness of her mind, and the blade of her finely-honed knowledge, with none of the compassion that would have made her more bearable. Though perhaps it was as well that she had none of the weakness Duy Uyen had shown, in the end\u2014the skin that barely hid the sharpness of bones; the eyes like bruises in the pale oval of her face; the voice, faltering on words or instructions . . .\nPaddies One to Three were thriving; the yield perhaps less than that of Old Earth; but nothing to be ashamed of. There had been a spot of infection in Paddy Three; but the bots had taken care of it.\nHoa watched, for a moment, the bots scuttling over the glass encasing the paddy; watched the shine of metal; the light trembling on the joints of their legs\u2014waiting for the smallest of triggers to blossom into flame. The temperature data for all three paddies was fluctuating too much; and the rate of fire-khi was far above what she was comfortable with.\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d Ya Lan was still waiting by Paddy Four.\nThere was only one paddy of that honeydreamer strain: it was new, and as yet unproved. Professor Duy Uyen stirred, within her mind; pointed out the painfully obvious. The strain wasn\u2019t resistant enough\u2014the Empire couldn\u2019t afford to rely on something so fragile. She should do the reasonable thing, and consign it to the scrap bin. They should switch efforts to the other strain, the favored one; and what did it matter if the station\u2019s Mind needed to enforce a slightly different balance of khi-elements?\nIt was what Professor Duy Uyen would have done.\nBut she wasn\u2019t Professor Duy Uyen.\nMinds were made in balance; to deliberately unhinge one . . . would have larger consequences on the station than mere atmospheric control. The risk was too high. She knew this; as much as she knew and numbered all her ancestors\u2014the ones that hadn\u2019t been rich or privileged enough to bequeath her their own mem-implants\u2014leaving her with only this pale, flawed approximation of an inheritance.\nYou\u2019re a fool.\nHoa closed her eyes; closed her thoughts so that the voice in her mind sank to a whisper. She brought herself, with a slight effort, back to the tranquility of her mornings\u2014breathing in the nutty aroma from her teacup, as she steeled herself for the day ahead.\nShe wasn\u2019t Professor Duy Uyen.\nShe\u2019d feared being left adrift when Professor Duy Uyen\u2019s illness had taken a turn for the worse; she\u2019d lain late at night wondering what would happen to Duy Uyen\u2019s vision; of what she would do, bereft of guidance.\nBut now she knew.\n\u201cGet three other tanks,\u201d Hoa said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what that strain looks like with a tighter temperature regulation. And if you can get hold of Khang, ask him to look into the graft\u2014there might be a better solution there.\u201d\nThe Empress had thought Duy Uyen a critical asset; had made sure that her mem-implants went to Hoa\u2014so that Hoa would have the advice and knowledge she needed to finish the station that the Empire so desperately needed. The Empress had been wrong; and who cared if that was treason?\nBecause the answer to Professor Duy Uyen\u2019s death, like everything else, was deceptively, heartbreakingly simple: that no one was irreplaceable; that they would do what everyone always did\u2014they would, somehow, forge on.\nDark tea: dark tea leaves are left to mature for years through a careful process of fermentation. The process can take anywhere from a few months to a century. The resulting brew has rich, thick texture with only a bare hint of sourness.\nThe Tiger in the Banyan doesn\u2019t grieve as humans do.\nPartly, it\u2019s because she\u2019s been grieving for such a long time; because mindships don\u2019t live the same way that humans do\u2014because they\u2019re built and anchored and stabilized.\nQuang Tu spoke of seeing Mother become frail and ill, and how it broke his heart; The Tiger in the Banyan\u2019s heart broke, years and years ago; when she stood in the midst of the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration\u2014as the sound of crackers and bells and gongs filled in the corridors of the orbital, and everyone hugged and cried, she suddenly realized that she would still be there in a hundred years; but that no one else around the table\u2014not Mother, not Quang Tu, none of the aunts and uncles or cousins\u2014would still be alive.\nShe leaves Quang Tu in his compartment, staring at the memorial altar\u2014and, shifting her consciousness from her projected avatar to her real body, climbs back among the stars.\nShe is a ship; and in the days and months that Quang Tu mourns, she carries people between planets and orbitals\u2014 private passengers and officials on their business: rough white silk, elaborate five panel dresses; parties of scholars arguing on the merit of poems; soldiers on leave from the most distant numbered planets, who go into the weirdness of deep spaces with nothing more than a raised eyebrow.\nMother is dead, but the world goes on\u2014Professor Pham Thi Duy Uyen becomes yesterday\u2019s news; fades into official biographies and re-creation vids\u2014and her daughter goes on, too, doing her duty to the Empire.\nThe Tiger in the Banyan doesn\u2019t grieve as humans do. Partly, it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t remember as humans do.\nShe doesn\u2019t remember the womb; or the shock of the birth; but in her earliest memories Mother is here\u2014the first and only time she was carried in Mother\u2019s arms\u2014and Mother herself helped by the birth-master, walking forward on tottering legs\u2014past the pain of the birth, past the bone-deep weariness that speaks only of rest and sleep. It\u2019s Mother\u2019s hands that lie her down into the cradle in the heartroom; Mother\u2019s hands that close the clasps around her\u2014so that she is held; wrapped as securely as she was in the womb\u2014and Mother\u2019s voice that sings to her a lullaby, the tune she will forever carry as she travels between the stars.\nThe lights in Sai Gon are green and red, the lamps in My Tho are bright and dim . . .\nAs she docks at an orbital near the Fifth Planet, The Tiger in the Banyan is hailed by another, older ship, The Dream of Millet: a friend she often meets on longer journeys. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan asks. It\u2019s not hard, to keep track of where ships go from their manifests; but The Dream of Millet is old, and rarely bothers to do so\u2014she\u2019s used to other ships coming to her, rather than the other way around.\n\u201cI wanted to ask how you were. When I heard you were back into service\u2014\u201d The Dream of Millet pauses, then; and hesitates; sending a faint signal of cautious disapproval on the comms. \u201cIt\u2019s early. Shouldn\u2019t you be mourning? Officially\u2014\u201d\nOfficially, the hundred days of tears are not yet over. But ships are few; and she\u2019s not an official like Quang Tu, beholden to present exemplary behavior. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan says. She\u2019s mourning; but it doesn\u2019t interfere with her activities: after all, she\u2019s been steeling herself for this since Father died. She didn\u2019t expect it to come so painfully, so soon, but she was prepared for it\u2014braced for it in a way that Quang Tu will never be.\nThe Dream of Millet is silent for a while\u2014The Tiger in The Banyan can feel her, through the void that separates them\u2014can feel the radio waves nudging her hull; the quick jab of probes dipping into her internal network and collating together information about her last travels. \u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018fine\u2019,\u201d The Dream of Millet says. \u201cYou\u2019re slower, and you go into deep spaces further than you should. And\u2014\u201d she pauses, but it\u2019s more for effect than anything else. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nThey both know what she\u2019s talking about: the space station Mother was putting together; the project to provide a steady, abundant food supply to the Empire.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had no orders that take me there,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan says. Not quite a lie; but dangerously close to one. She\u2019s been . . . better off knowing the station doesn\u2019t exist\u2014unsure that she could face it at all. She doesn\u2019t care about Tuyet Hoa, or the mem-implants; but the station was such a large part of Mother\u2019s life that she\u2019s not sure she could stand to be reminded of it.\nShe is a mindship: her memories never grow dim or faint; or corrupt. She remembers songs and fairytales whispered through her corridors; remembers walking with Mother on the First Planet, smiling as Mother pointed out the odder places of the Imperial City, from the menagerie to the temple where monks worship an Outsider clockmaker\u2014remembers Mother frail and bowed in the last days, coming to rest in the heartroom, her labored breath filling The Tiger in the Banyan\u2019s corridors until she, too, could hardly breathe.\nShe remembers everything about Mother; but the space station\u2014the place where Mother worked away from her children; the project Mother could barely talk about without breaching confidentiality\u2014is forever denied to her memories; forever impersonal, forever distant.\n\u201cI see,\u201d The Dream of Millet says. Again, faint disapproval; and another feeling The Tiger in the Banyan can\u2019t quite place\u2014reluctance? Fear of impropriety? \u201cYou cannot live like that, child.\u201d\nLet me be, The Tiger in the Banyan says; but of course she can\u2019t say that; not to a ship as old as The Dream of Millet. \u201cIt will pass,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the meantime, I do what I was trained to do. No one has reproached me.\u201d Her answer borders on impertinence, deliberately.\n\u201cNo. And I won\u2019t,\u201d The Dream of Millet says. \u201cIt would be inappropriate of me to tell you how to manage your grief.\u201d She laughs, briefly. \u201cYou know there are people worshipping her? I saw a temple, on the Fifty-Second Planet.\u201d\nAn easier, happier subject. \u201cI\u2019ve seen one too,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan says. \u201cOn the Thirtieth Planet.\u201d It has a statue of Mother, smiling as serenely as a bodhisattva\u2014people light incense to her to be helped in their difficulties. \u201cShe would have loved this.\u201d Not for the fame or the worship, but merely because she would have found it heartbreakingly funny.\n\u201cHmmm. No doubt.\u201d The Dream of Millet starts moving away; her comms growing slightly fainter. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again, then. Remember what I said.\u201d\nThe Tiger in the Banyan will; but not with pleasure. And she doesn\u2019t like the tone with which the other ship takes her leave; it suggests she is going to do something\u2014something typical of the old, getting The Tiger in the Banyan into a position where she\u2019ll have no choice but to acquiesce to whatever The Dream of Millet thinks of as necessary.\nStill . . . there is nothing that she can do. As The Tiger in the Banyan leaves the orbital onto her next journey, she sets a trace on The Dream of Millet; and monitors it from time to time. Nothing the other ship does seems untoward or suspicious; and after a while The Tiger in the Banyan lets the trace fade.\nAs she weaves her way between the stars, she remembers.\nMother, coming onboard a week before she died\u2014walking by the walls with their endlessly scrolling texts, all the poems she taught The Tiger in the Banyan as a child. In the low gravity, Mother seemed almost at ease; striding once more onboard the ship until she reached the heartroom. She\u2019d sat with a teacup cradled in her lap\u2014dark tea, because she said she needed a strong taste to wash down the drugs they plied her with\u2014the heartroom filled with a smell like churned earth, until The Tiger in the Banyan could almost taste the tea she couldn\u2019t drink.\n\u201cChild?\u201d Mother asked.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cCan we go away\u2014for a while?\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t supposed to, of course; she was a mindship, her travels strictly bounded and codified. But she did. She warned the space station; and plunged into deep spaces.\nMother said nothing. She\u2019d stared ahead, listening to the odd sounds; to the echo of her own breath, watching the oily shapes spread on the walls\u2014while The Tiger in the Banyan kept them on course; feeling stretched and scrunched, pulled in different directions as if she were swimming in rapids. Mother was mumbling under her breath; after a while, The Tiger in the Banyan realized it was the words of a song; and, to accompany it, she broadcast music on her loudspeakers.\n\u201cGo home to study,\nI shall wait nine months, I shall wait ten autumns . . .\u201d\nShe remembers Mother\u2019s smile; the utter serenity on her face\u2014the way she rose after they came back to normal spaces, fluid and utterly graceful; as if all pain and weakness had been set aside for this bare moment; subsumed in the music or the travel or both. She remembers Mother\u2019s quiet words as she left the heartroom.\n\u201cThank you, child. You did well.\u201d\n\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d she\u2019d said, and Mother had smiled, and disembarked\u2014but The Tiger in the Banyan had heard the words Mother wasn\u2019t speaking. Of course it wasn\u2019t nothing. Of course it had meant something; to be away from it all, even for a bare moment; to hang, weightless and without responsibilities, in the vastness of space. Of course.\nA hundred and three days after Mother\u2019s death, a message comes, from the Imperial Palace. It directs her to pick an Embroidered Guard from the First Planet; and the destination is . . .\nHad she a heart, this is the moment when it would stop.\nThe Embroidered Guard is going to Mother\u2019s space station. It doesn\u2019t matter why; or how long for\u2014just that she\u2019s meant to go with him. And she can\u2019t. She can\u2019t possibly . . .\nBelow the order is a note, and she knows, too, what it will say. That the ship originally meant for this mission was The Dream of Millet; and that she, unable to complete it, recommended that The Tiger in the Banyan take it up instead.\nAncestors . . .\nHow dare she?\nThe Tiger in the Banyan can\u2019t refuse the order; or pass it on to someone else. Neither can she rail at a much older ship\u2014but if she could\u2014ancestors, if she could . . .\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just a place\u2014one with a little personal significance to her\u2014but nothing she can\u2019t weather. She has been to so many places, all over the Empire; and this is just one more.\nJust one more.\nThe Embroidered Guard is young, and callow; and not unkind. He boards her at the First Planet, as specified\u2014she\u2019s so busy steeling herself that she forgets to greet him, but he doesn\u2019t appear to notice this.\nShe\u2019s met him before, at the funeral: the one who apologetically approached Quang Tu; who let him know Mother\u2019s mem-implants wouldn\u2019t pass to him.\nOf course.\nShe finds refuge in protocol: it\u2019s not her role to offer conversation to her passengers, especially not those of high rank or in imperial service, who would think it presumption. So she doesn\u2019t speak; and he keeps busy in his cabin, reading reports and watching vids, the way other passengers do.\nJust before they emerge from deep spaces, she pauses; as if it would make a difference\u2014as if there were a demon waiting for her; or perhaps something far older and far more terrible; something that will shatter her composure past any hope of recovery.\nWhat are you afraid of? A voice asks within her\u2014she isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s Mother or The Dream of Millet, and she isn\u2019t sure of what answer she\u2019d give, either.\nThe station isn\u2019t what she expected. It\u2019s a skeleton; a work in progress; a mass of cables and metal beams with bots crawling all over it; and the living quarters at the center, dwarfed by the incomplete structure. Almost deceptively ordinary; and yet it meant so much to Mother. Her vision for the future of the Empire; and neither Quang Tu nor The Tiger in the Banyan having a place within.\nAnd yet . . . and yet, the station has heft. It has meaning\u2014that of a painting half-done; of a poem stopped mid-verse\u2014of a spear-thrust stopped a handspan before it penetrates the heart. It begs\u2014demands\u2014to be finished.\nThe Embroidered Guard speaks, then. \u201cI have business onboard. Wait for me, will you?\u201d\nIt is a courtesy to ask; since she would wait, in any case. But he surprises her by looking back, as he disembarks. \u201cShip?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d His voice is toneless.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan says.\nHe smiles then; a bare upturning of the lips. \u201cI could give you the platitudes about your mother living on in her work, if I thought that would change something for her.\u201d\nThe Tiger in the Banyan doesn\u2019t say anything, for a while. She watches the station below her; listens to the faint drift of radio communications\u2014scientists calling other scientists; reporting successes and failures and the ten thousand little things that make a project of this magnitude. Mother\u2019s vision; Mother\u2019s work\u2014people call it her life work, but of course she and Quang Tu are also Mother\u2019s life work, in a different way. And she understands, then, why The Dream of Millet sent her there.\n\u201cIt meant something to her,\u201d she says, finally. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d have begrudged its completion.\u201d\nHe hesitates. Then, coming back inside the ship\u2014and looking upwards, straight where the heartroom would be\u2014his gaze level, driven by an emotion she can\u2019t read: \u201cThey\u2019ll finish it. The new variety of rice they\u2019ve found\u2014the environment will have to be strictly controlled to prevent it from dying of cold, but . . . \u201d He takes a deep, trembling breath. \u201cThere\u2019ll be stations like this all over the Empire\u2014and it\u2019s all thanks to your mother. \u201c\n\u201cOf course,\u201d The Tiger in the Banyan says. And the only words that come to her as the ones Mother spoke, once. \u201cThank you, child. You did well.\u201d\nShe watches him leave; and thinks of Mother\u2019s smile. Of Mother\u2019s work; and of the things that happened between the work; the songs and the smiles and the stolen moments, all arrayed within her with the clarity and resilience of diamond. She thinks of the memories she carries within her\u2014that she will carry within her for the centuries to come.\nThe Embroidered Guard was trying to apologize, for the mem-implants; for the inheritance neither she nor Quang Tu will ever have. Telling her it had all been worth it, in the end; that their sacrifice hadn\u2019t been in vain.\nBut the truth is, it doesn\u2019t matter. It mattered to Quang Tu; but she\u2019s not her brother. She\u2019s not bound by anger or rancor; and she doesn\u2019t grieve as he does.\nWhat matters is this: she holds all of her memories of Mother; and Mother is here now, with her\u2014forever unchanged, forever graceful and tireless; forever flying among the stars.\nAliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

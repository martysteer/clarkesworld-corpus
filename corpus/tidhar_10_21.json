They stopped and scanned the gloomy inside. Geshem-Nofel-Ba\u2019oranim clocked them and kept to his booth. He knew trouble when it walked through the door looking for him.\nThe two men were armed. Security, probably federal. That\u2019s if Geshem was lucky, if it wasn\u2019t someone he owed money to.\nThe two men stepped up to the bar.\n\u201cLooking for a Neand,\u201d one said.\nThere was a sudden silence around them at the slur.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know any First Humans,\u201d the bartender said. She polished a glass. Kept her face carefully blank. Kept one hand on the EMP device under the counter.\n\u201cGoes by the name of Geshem.\u201d\nThe Monte Carmelo sat on the edge of the First Human Sanctuary and the Federated Lands of Judea Palestina. The border wasn\u2019t neat. The Sanctuary encompassed most of Mount Carmel, which had been home to the original First Humans a long time in the past, and it extended down to the Hills of Menashe and past Armageddon to the Jezreel Valley and into the Galilee. The Monte Carmelo sat somewhere on the border, between Druze villages and the monastery of the Carmelites, each of which had their own dispensation, so questions of authority were the sort of questions it was best not to ask. Which was what drew the sort of people who drank there to the Monte Carmelo.\n\u201cShin Bet or Shurta?\u201d the bartender said. Her name was Mili, and she was wired with the sort of old-school upgrades backstreet surgeons still performed over the border in Sidon or Beirut, the sort of stuff that made you a little faster and a little tougher, just like First Humans were. Geshem thought he could trust her. But he couldn\u2019t be sure.\n\u201cI\u2019m Cohen, this is Haddad,\u201d the man on the left said. His hair was thinning on top. \u201cWe\u2019re with Antiquities.\u201d\n\u201cNo antiquities here,\u201d Mili said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all antiquities here,\u201d Haddad said. He had a pencil moustache. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Neand?\u201d\nGeshem sank low in the booth. He could make a run for it, but he didn\u2019t know into what. So he stayed put for the moment. He squished a green ball in his hand.\nMili shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong place, friend,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNot your friend,\u201d Haddad said. His partner smirked.\n\u201cWe can shut you down,\u201d Cohen said.\n\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d\n\u201cSmuggling.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re under Carmelite protection,\u201d Mili said. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m just the bartender. You want, I can sell you a beer. What did he do, anyway? This Geshem?\u201d\nCohen shrugged. Haddad said, \u201cTook something he shouldn\u2019t have, didn\u2019t he.\u201d\n\u201cYou want a beer?\u201d Mili said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a beer,\u201d Cohen said. He and Haddad pulled out weapons. They were short snub-nosed pistols, ugly. They weren\u2019t quite pointing them. But they weren\u2019t being subtle about it either.\nThe rest of the clientele didn\u2019t like it, Geshem knew. The Monte Carmelo catered to people who didn\u2019t have much to do with the law. But they wouldn\u2019t look too kindly on Geshem either, for bringing the law to this place. So Geshem slid out of the booth and came out slowly, arms raised.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d he said.\nCohen and Haddad turned. Cohen smiled an ugly smile. Haddad just looked confused. Geshem smiled back at Cohen. Then he let go of the ball he was holding.\nIt rolled across the floor of the bar and stopped at the feet of the two Antiquities men. It was green and squishy. Geshem had bought it off of a Tiberian gene-shaman, and to be honest he didn\u2019t know quite what to expect.\nWhen the ball exploded it made a sort of wet whoomph sound. It splattered the two men with goo.\n\u201cGet it off me, get it off!\u201d\nHaddad squeezed off a shot. It went wide, hit the ceiling. Patrons glowered into their beers. The green stuff crawled over the two men from Antiquities, growing furry and glowing like cave moss.\nMili shouted, \u201cNo guns in the bar!\u201d She hopped over the counter and took their weapons. Geshem ran for the door.\n\u201cKeep my tab open!\u201d he shouted behind him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re barred!\u201d Mili shouted. But by then Geshem was outside.\nThe Carmel Mountain, ancient, sacred, strewn with bones and fought over ever since Homo Sapiens first set foot in First Humans land, sloped down to the valley below. Somewhere beyond the trees was the road, a digitally federated thruway linking Gaza City and Tel Aviv to Haifa and Lebanon, cutting like a knife through the Sanctuary. But Geshem figured as long as he avoided the road, and as long as he could shake off the two Antiquities agents and get back into his peoples\u2019 enclave, he should be fine. He laughed and ran into the trees, taking with him the backpack with the roc\u2019s egg he really wasn\u2019t supposed to be carrying.\n2.\nGeshem-Nofel-Ba\u2019oranim didn\u2019t even want the roc\u2019s egg. He\u2019d been hoping for something a little less bothersome when he made the trek to the Sea of Galilee to see the gene-shaman.\nThe gene-shaman was a Sapi, some old Jewish dude who was wanted across the intertwined strips of both Judean and Palestinian authorities and in a few other places besides. So like other Sapis who needed a place to lie low, he crossed into First Human territory, since Geshem\u2019s people only got the land in the first place because it was jungly, swampy, and filled with, not to point too fine a point on it, monsters.\nRelics of the old wars, specifically, from behemoths and great taninim to derelict manshonyaggers, roc nests, djinns, UXOs, mutated ants, and nanogoo swamps. Not to mention the cave bears and the killer robots.\nRobots. Now there was a thing Geshem didn\u2019t like. Call him bigoted, but he just didn\u2019t trust them. Some even came down from Central Station into First Human land to preach the Way of Robot, and they were all about doing no harm to people even though, he thought darkly, even though what did people make robots for in the first place if not to kill people? And the other thing, whenever he met one of the old humanoid robots was, he was never sure they thought First Humans were, well, people. Even though they were always very polite and all. The problem was, they were modeled on Sapis, not Neands\u2014pardon the slur. It was galling to be named after some German pastor.\nThe point being, if you were running from something or hiding from something you came to the First Humans, and for the most part, as long as you were cool you got to stay, and the gene-shaman was cool insofar as he kept himself to himself, and he knew better than to screw you on a deal\u2014or so Geshem thought then, at least. Now he wasn\u2019t so sure.\nThere were no roads and no cars going through the Sanctuary. There were no drones other than the old feral war drones that still lived there, and even the Conversation was muted across the Sanctuary, though echoes of it still fed through. Most First Humans weren\u2019t noded, and if they had to access the virtuality they did it the old-fashioned way, with a screen or a rig or an immersion pod. So Geshem made the trek, past Armageddon, all along the Jezreel and through the mountains to Tiberias and the lake. It really was beautiful country. The heat didn\u2019t bother him, and his genetic signature confused most of the old predators, since they were coded for Sapis, back in the days when First Humans were still extinct.\nIt was a long trek, though. This wasn\u2019t Central Station with the ships coming down from orbit, though you could see them darting like fireflies in the night above the Sanctuary. This wasn\u2019t Gaza City either, with the gleaming port and floating islands and the glass and chrome pipes that ran down to the underwater cities of the Drift. This was bad old detritus and debris land, where the bones of Geshem\u2019s ancestors still lay deep down in the mud.\nHe reached Tiberias, and he saw the lake, and the monsters in the water. He sat with the gene-shaman \u2019round the fire and swapped stories and then they talked shop.\n\u201cYou got that thing I asked for?\u201d the gene-shaman said. His name was Lotem.\nGeshem brought out the package, wrapped in waterproofed mammoth hide. Back in the Great Rebirthing, the Denisovans got much of Siberia, and this was Siberian mammoth leather, the real deal. Inside it was the stuff Lotem had asked for.\n\u201cWhat is it, anyway?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cLatest drop from the Kunming labs,\u201d Lotem said. \u201cIt\u2019s just code. Genome sequencing and stuff. You know.\u201d\n\u201cTo make monsters, sure,\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just monsters,\u201d Lotem said, looking genuinely agitated. \u201cIt\u2019s good stuff, too. Like those nano-mites that got released into the oceans to eat the Pacific Trash Vortex and the North Atlantic Garbage Patch and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t they go rogue and start eating all kinds of other things, like ships and subs?\u201d Geshem said. \u201cAnd then there was a story about whole islands vanishing.\u201d\nLotem rubbed his hands together. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said, \u201cso that was a bad example. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d\n\u201cLook, man,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you need it for. What have you got for me, is what I want to know.\u201d\n\u201cI got this,\u201d Lotem said. He rummaged around in a pile by the fire and came back with the egg. The egg was about the size of a human head, and heavy. The shell was a smooth warm metal, and it glowed faintly from inside.\n\u201cWhat do I need with a roc egg?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your regular roc egg,\u201d Lotem said.\n\u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d\n\u201cThe Golan. Don\u2019t ask.\u201d\n\u201cYou went over?\u201d Geshem said, wondering if the gene-shaman was stupid or mad or both.\n\u201cIt\u2019s where all the primo stuff is, my man. Old old war stuff. But this isn\u2019t old. It\u2019s new.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a roc egg,\u201d Geshem said. He felt almost insulted. It was a long trek to the lake, and it would be a long trek back. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with it, make a roc omelet?\u201d\nLotem smiled politely at the old joke.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fertilized,\u201d he said. \u201cSee here?\u201d He pointed to a spot on the egg. Geshem squinted but it looked solid to him.\n\u201cSomeone inseminated it with off-world wildtech,\u201d Lotem said. \u201cI think.\u201d\n\u201cYou think?\u201d\nLotem shrugged. \u201cNakaimas from Jettisoned.\u201d\nTranslation: bad magic from the last outpost on Charon. Geshem had never been off-world, though there were some First Humans on Mars. People only lived on Jettisoned because that\u2019s what happened to them, they were jettisoned off the Exodus ships as they departed the solar system. All the wildtech in the solar system came from that lawless hell on Charon. But how some of it ended up in the Golan and inside a roc\u2019s egg, he had no idea. The Golan has been an involuntary park for centuries, ever since a terror-artist dada bomb went off there. Not even a First Human tracker would go into the Golan.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like there?\u201d he said, fascinated.\n\u201cPretty,\u201d Lotem said. \u201cWeird. It looks really peaceful, until something awful crawls out of the ground or swoops down on you. The shadows all fall wrong. Some of the rocks talk and some of the animals aren\u2019t really animals, but you can\u2019t . . . \u201d He fell quiet. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell what they are,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow did you go there and still get out alive?\u201d\n\u201cProtection,\u201d Lotem said. He showed Geshem the disc hanging \u2019round his neck, looped through with string.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terror-artist artifact?\u201d Geshem said, impressed. Those things were so rare as to be nonexistent. And the real stuff was more likely to kill you than protect you.\n\u201cMade by Nasu, supposedly. Someone sold it to me in the flea market in Jaffa. Didn\u2019t know if it was genuine but . . . \u201d Lotem shrugged. \u201cI got in and I got out again, so it has to be. It must null some of the worst effects of the dada bomb.\u201d\nAs fascinating as all this no doubt was, Geshem realized none of this really answered his questions, which were one, what exactly the egg was, two, how Jettisoned wildtech even ended up in the Golan, and more importantly, three, what, if anything, it was worth.\nStill. A trade was a trade. He took the egg, and some green goo grenades, and a handful of Sidorov embryo-mech maker beans that he was going to either sow or sell. So all in all it wasn\u2019t a bad deal.\nAt least that was what he figured until the first attack came.\n3.\nHe was deep into Sanctuary land by then and no one should have messed with him there, only there they suddenly were, four white ghosts dropping out of the trees soundlessly. Sapis with Uzis, because old guns were still the best guns.\nThey fired. He ducked and rolled. Humans hunting his kind\u2014again. He felt his hatred of them rise like bile. He vanished into the trees. He put on goggles and watched ghosts with digital imprints track him. He could smell them without looking. He could smell swamp water. He ran and they followed, but the water was near. Geshem slipped into the mud. He crouched low. He whispered invocations.\nThe four assassins materialized soundlessly. They moved without hurrying. They had to be good to have made it this far into the Sanctuary. Combat rewired bodies, the works. But this was Geshem\u2019s land.\nWhen the Tanin burst out of the swamp its tail swatted trees like matchsticks. A huge mouth opened, teeth like giant blades. The assassins ran, or tried to. The Tanin\u2019s neck whipped this way and that, the head on it like a pea at the end of a stalk. Two huge eyes burned yellow and green. They looked at the intruders dispassionately. Geshem didn\u2019t know what ancient lab created the Taninim. This one was only a minor Tanin. The Great Taninim of old still lived, but only deep in the secret heart of the Sanctuary.\nThe white ghosts fled.\nThe Tanin fed.\nAfter a while the Tanin slunk back into the swamp and Geshem climbed out. He found a foot and, a little later, an intact hand. He took the hand.\nFilaments still twitched inside the flesh and blood. Augmented, but he knew that already. Geshem wondered who would send mercenaries after him. The fingerprints had been burned clean off. He tossed the hand into the swamp, a respectful offering to the Tanin.\nHe spent the night in the ruins of Afula, a Sapi town overgrown with jungle now. This was ancient First Human land. When the Sapis first came over from Africa, Geshem\u2019s people had already been living in this place. Their stone tools still littered the ground. Whenever he found one of the worked flint knives, he held it in his hand and marveled at how well it fit, and at that continuity with his own ancient past. But Sapis bred quickly, and First Humans didn\u2019t, and eventually only the Sapis were left of all the human races of the Earth.\nHe made a fire and sat all alone amidst the rotten fallen-down buildings of the Sapis. The stars shone bright overhead. He stared fascinated at the moving dots of light that were the shimmering orbitals rings and transport ships. Sapis always had to spread and conquer. They did it to the other human races and if they ever met aliens out there, they would do it to them too. You couldn\u2019t blame them for it\u2014it was just their nature.\nA beating of wings as large as sails bellowed in the night. Geshem saw a dark shape as large as an airplane hovering against the field of stars. The creature swooped low and came to stand beyond the light of Geshem\u2019s fire.\nHuge eyes regarded him quizzically. A monstrous beak opened and closed without sound.\nLike the Taninim, the rocs were really just tweaked bioweapons. They were imprinted for Sapis, not First Humans. But Geshem had never seen one of the creatures this close before.\nHe stared at the roc.\nThe roc stared at Geshem.\nGeshem took out the egg.\n\u201cIs this what you\u2019re after?\u201d he murmured. The roc inched its head. You could get lost in its eyes, Geshem thought. The egg felt warm in his hands, alive somehow.\n\u201cYou can take it,\u201d Geshem said. He carried the egg beyond the fire and placed it on the ground. The roc towered over him. Geshem backed away, slowly.\nThe roc lowered its head. It examined the egg.\nIt cooed.\n\u201cGood roc,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cGood roc.\u201d\nThe roc touched the front of its beak to the egg. Then it pulled back and opened two huge wings and cawed softly.\n\u201cGood roc!\u201d Geshem said desperately.\nThe wings thrashed. The creature rose into the air. It circled overhead and sped east.\nGeshem sat on his haunches and stared at the egg.\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d he said softly. But there was no answer.\n4.\nCampfire smoke rose into the setting sun as Geshem approached the settlement the next day. Armageddon rose overhead. A brook bubbled gently, and Geshem inhaled the smell of fresh pines.\n\u201cGeshem!\u201d he heard the children crying. \u201cGeshem\u2019s coming!\u201d\nHe grinned and opened his long arms wide as his niece, Alei-Shalechet-Noflim-Ba\u2019stav, jumped on him.\n\u201cUncle Geshem!\u201d\n\u201cShalechet,\u201d he said, hugging her.\n\u201cDid you bring me anything?\u201d\n\u201cBlack gold to anoint your brow,\u201d Geshem said. He had an unfortunate love for old Sapi songs. \u201cYour forehead rhymes with eyes and with light.\u201d\n\u201cUncle Geshem! Come on!\u201d\n\u201cI brought you a roc\u2019s egg,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cWould you like to see it?\u201d\nHer eyes grew wide.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said carelessly. He opened the bag. Shalechet took the egg. An aura of visible spectrum light surrounded her head. The currents swirled and traveled down her arms to the egg. The egg shuddered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alive,\u201d Shalechet said. \u201cIt\u2019s saying . . . \u201d Her eyes grew wider. She was noded from birth, but not with a Sapi node. Some tinkered-with bespoke thing: it was unpredictable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s dark . . . It\u2019s come from a great distance, from a place where the sun is small and cold in the sky . . . It wants to talk but can\u2019t. It speaks in different protocols. It doesn\u2019t understand what I am. It\u2019s only seen Sapis before.\u201d\n\u201cYou can understand all that? How?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . \u201d\nShe put the egg down on the ground and stared at it. \u201cIt was not meant to be here, Uncle Geshem. It was not sent to Earth for us.\u201d\n\u201cThen who?\u201d\nShe shuddered. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they will come for it.\u201d\nGeshem thought of the white ghosts in the forest.\n\u201cI think they already have,\u201d he said.\nHe spent the night by the fire, under the stars. The brook bubbled. His grandfather came and sat with him then. Ruach-Noshevet-Ba\u2019gfanim. The old man had been to Mars, had worked the Lunar-Martian trade route in his youth. A First Human on Old Mars. He never tired of telling the tales. But he came back and made a family. He wasn\u2019t noded, but he carried a communication disc around his neck, had a full-immersion pod buried out the back way and hooked up to solar. Geshem never went into the virtuality himself. He felt better in the physicality, where the digital ghosts of the Others seldom incurred.\n\u201cThis thing you brought,\u201d Ruach said, \u201cit has off-world code?\u201d\n\u201cSeems so, Grandfather.\u201d\n\u201cI heard stories, in the Up and Out,\u201d Ruach said. \u201cStrange rumors, even stranger code coming in from beyond the Oort. Dark entities as large as worlds, they say, amorphous filaments moving like tendrils. Or like sea anemones.\u201d\n\u201cSea anemones?\u201d Geshem said.\nHis grandfather nodded. \u201cOut in there in Oort.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what are they?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cSome say they were made there long ago by the Spiders who seeded the solar system with the Conversation, but they mutated into a new network, new Others with different protocols. Some say it was \u2018Mad\u2019 Rucker, the Terror-artist, who also made the boppers on Titan. Some just say they\u2019re aliens.\u201d\n\u201cAre they real?\u201d Geshem said. \u201cOr is it just a story?\u201d\nRuach shrugged, a Sapi habit he\u2019d picked up in the Up and Out.\n\u201cWho knows,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are people who believe in them. You want to watch out, Geshem-Nofel-Ba\u2019oranim. And you want to get rid of that thing you brought back with you.\u201d\n\u201cSoon as I sell it,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cI owe to those Toads from Kunming.\u201d\nRuach nodded, another Sapi habit.\n\u201cThis was not wise,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting involved with the Toads.\u201d\n\u201cI am not as wise as you, Grandfather,\u201d Geshem said, and Ruach grinned and slapped him on the shoulder, and Geshem laughed.\n\u201cNo,\u201d his grandfather said. \u201cYou are not.\u201d\n5.\nThe Kunming Toads started out as just another small-time outfit on the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone between Luang Namtha, Chiang Rai, Tachileik, and Yunnan. They\u2019d since upgraded meth to Plateau and Crucifixation, turned from people-smuggling to organ-legging, and finally veered into the lucrative market of extreme gene modification. Now they were a semirespectable guild with offices in nearly every Autonomous Zone, crypto anarchy, pirate utopia, and cyberstate across Earth and the Inner System\u2014in other words, everywhere.\nThe problem was, Geshem didn\u2019t so much get the data-drop that Lotem, the old gene-shaman, had asked for. It was more that he\u2019d stolen it.\nOr, more to the point, he\u2019d paid an uplifted octopus to do it for him.\nOctopi being a highly intelligent and generally morally compromised aquatic species who lived in the Drift and were more trustworthy on the whole than dolphins, who Geshem thought of, rather uncharitably, as the vermin of the sea.\nThis particular octopus went by the name Shraga. He lived in the Down Below past Gaza Port. Geshem managed to get him on the third attempt, using the encryption disc Shraga gave him and hooking up to a public node. He hated using the Conversation.\nMurky water, things moving in the dark.\nShraga said, \u201cWhat do you want, Neand? I\u2019m hunting snails.\u201d\n\u201cI had some ghost-types come after me recently,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know anything about that, would you, Shraga?\u201d\nThe octopus made a rude sound.\n\u201cYou have land-person problems,\u201d Shraga said. \u201cThese are not my problems.\u201d\n\u201cI just wondered how careful you were when you stole that drop from the Toads.\u201d\n\u201cShraga is always careful,\u201d Shraga said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Shraga is still alive, Neand. Why are you still alive? Your species already died out once.\u201d\n\u201cListen, you eight-armed freak,\u201d Geshem said, and Shraga laughed an octopus laugh and said, \u201cNo, you listen, Geshem. Don\u2019t come pooping in my habitat when it\u2019s your own that\u2019s covered in crap. You know?\u201d\nAnd he cut the connection.\nWhich meant the Toads probably weren\u2019t after him, so he may as well reach out to them. He made a call. A fat green-skinned man answered on the screen. Folds of fat rolled down from his face. The fat inflated. A Kunming Toad. They got the name for a reason.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Neand?\u201d he said.\n\u201cBaigujing,\u201d Shemesh said, and the Toad inflated some more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Boss Baigujing to you,\u201d he said.\nGeshem and the Toads went back: a short, sad history he didn\u2019t like to dwell on.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call Sapis boss,\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cHardly a . . . Sapi,\u201d Boss Baigujing said.\n\u201cTweaked genes, still Sapi genes,\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cHey, I have like three to five percent Neanderthal,\u201d Boss Baigujing said, sounding hurt.\nGeshem wasn\u2019t going to shrug, but he made a face.\n\u201cI got something to sell,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYeah? What\u2019s that? Mammoth bones?\u201d\nBaigujing laughed at his own joke.\n\u201cThis,\u201d Geshem said. He held up the egg.\n\u201cRoc\u2019s egg? So what?\u201d\n\u201cScan it.\u201d\nThe Toad must have run a scan. He deflated. Cold eyes stared at Geshem through the old screen.\n\u201cHow much do you want for it?\u201d Baigujing said.\n\u201cWhat you offering?\u201d\nThe Toad inflated. He laughed, but without much humor.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what it is, do you?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s valuable,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cAnd I have it.\u201d\n\u201cBad magic,\u201d Baigujing said. He inflated again, loomed huge and green-skinned in the viewport. \u201cBad magic.\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cUsual place. No tricks.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re respectable businesspeople,\u201d Baigujing said.\n\u201cBusiness I like,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cIt\u2019s people I don\u2019t trust.\u201d\nBaigujing laughed as he cut the connection.\n6.\nSo now Geshem was running out of the Monte Carmelo with two guys supposedly from Antiquities after him and a no-show from the Toads. He never saw the two guys before.\nCohen and Haddad. They sounded like Tel Aviv lawyers.\nHow did they know where to find him?\nStupid question. Where else would he go to make a deal?\nHe hid in the pines. He pinged Shraga from a portable node\u2014he came wired, this time.\nThe sound of bubbles, engine hum in the background. Shraga getting high on thermal vents from Gaza-Under-Sea.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Geshem? I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u201cBusy doing what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . \u201d Grunt. \u201cBreaking into a . . . \u201d Grunt. \u201cSky vault.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a sky vault, Shraga?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a vault in the . . . \u201d Grunt. \u201cSky.\u201d\n\u201cLike in orbit?\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cYou ever been, Shraga?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s the Down Below and there\u2019s the . . . \u201d Grunt. \u201cUp and Out. I\u2019ll stick to the sea, thank you. Especially since the Sapis stopped dumping quite so much crap into it.\u201d\n\u201cOther than themselves,\u201d Geshem said.\nThe octopus laughed. \u201cI like the . . . \u201d Grunt. \u201cCities. They sparkle, Geshem. What do you want?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m being chased by Antiquities.\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\nGeshem shook his head. Was someone moving in the trees? Could they track him? They had infrared vision and gene-sniffers tuned to First Humans, all kinds of nasty things.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDifferent how?\u201d\n\u201cDunno. Can you find them for me? Cohen and Haddad.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know how many Cohen and Haddad there are? Hold on. I\u2019ll pull the data from the Monte Carmelo . . . Got it. Huh.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Geshem said. The bad feeling he had just got worse.\n\u201cThey are Antiquities but they\u2019re off-world Antiquities. What did you get yourself involved in, Geshem?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u201cWhere would you get off-world artifacts? You live in the . . . \u201d A grunt again. \u201cSanctuary.\u201d\n\u201cI guess from . . . \u201d Geshem grunted. Maybe it was infectious. \u201cOff-world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFunny!\u201d the octopus said. \u201cCan I see it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my bag.\u201d\n\u201cHold on . . . Ohhh . . . \u201d\n\u201cCan you tell what it is?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s old,\u201d Shraga said. \u201cIt\u2019s Oort code. That stuff\u2019s not supposed to exist.\u201d\n\u201cDark entities as large as planets?\u201d Geshem said. \u201cTendrils and so on?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story.\u201d\n\u201cYou believe it?\u201d\n\u201cAll I know is it\u2019s weird code from space,\u201d Shraga said. \u201cWhatever you do don\u2019t bring it into the Drift. Alright?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou have two lots of people coming for you, Geshem,\u201d Shraga said. \u201cDid you mention ghosts? Because you have ghosts coming at you from the slopes, and you have Toads coming at you from the\u2014oh, hey, Mili.\u201d\nThe bartender from the Monte Carmelo crashed into Geshem and pushed him against a pine.\n\u201cGet lost, Shraga,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re about as useful as an octopus in a fight.\u201d\n\u201cOctopi are very good fighters,\u201d Shraga said. He sounded hurt.\n\u201cThis way,\u201d Mili said. She grabbed Geshem. He ran after her, lumbering through the trees. Mili was too tall, too graceful\u2014too Sapi. Geshem was short and squat. They made it to the end of a clearing. An old wooden hut sat in the clearing, the house of some long-vanished caretaker.\n\u201cIt should be safe inside,\u201d Mili said.\nGeshem let her lead him. Shraga had gone silent. Geshem-Nofel-Ba\u2019oranim was keenly aware of the smell of the soil, the blueness of the skies, how quiet it was then, how quiet. He smelled it too late.\nThe door opened.\nHe turned to run.\nMili said, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\nShe had a gun pointed at him.\nShe pushed him into the dark inside of the hut.\n7.\nThree people stood within and watched him. Two were white ghosts, like the Sapis who had tried to hunt him in the Sanctuary before. The third one was different. She was barely human in form. Some extreme modification, off-world probably. He didn\u2019t know. But still a Sapi under it all. A cocktail of bird genes: a hawk, a raven. When she spread her arms open, she had black-feather wings. A human mouth was melded with a beak.\n\u201cGeshem-Nofel-Ba\u2019oranim,\u201d she said. \u201cI am Ziz.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it to me?\u201d Geshem said.\nHe looked accusingly at Mili. She shrugged, looking embarrassed.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know you had a bounty on you?\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe mean you no harm,\u201d Ziz said.\n\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d Geshem said in a low voice, \u201cI can double it.\u201d\nMili smiled.\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWill you please pay attention?\u201d Ziz said. The bird-woman sounded annoyed, which pleased Geshem.\nHe said, \u201cI am a First Human, and you have no claim here.\u201d\n\u201cI serve those who live beyond the sun and have no Earthly names,\u201d Ziz said.\nSo she was one of those.\n\u201cThe Masters of the Nine Billion Hells!\u201d Ziz said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cJust give me the egg,\u201d Ziz said.\n\u201cWhat egg?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cSearch him,\u201d Ziz ordered. Her ghosts moved on Geshem.\nHe said, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOr what?\u201d Ziz said. Her beak opened and closed hungrily.\nGeshem shrugged.\n\u201cOr else it will blow up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd us with it.\u201d\nThe ghosts froze. Ziz closed her beak with a click. She stared at Geshem.\n\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI am not afraid to die,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cMy people died out because of your people once before. None of us fear death. Or whatever those Nine Billion Hells are. So stand back, and we can talk.\u201d\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Ziz said.\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d Geshem said.\nWhy did Sapis always think First Humans were stupid?\nThe ghosts moved back and stared at Geshem without expression. Ziz shuddered and when she did her feathers changed color and became a deep golden-green.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d Geshem said.\nZiz laughed.\n\u201cCallisto,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOuter System? Figures.\u201d\n\u201cThe voices of the entities in the dark are whispered more audibly there,\u201d Ziz said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. Why do you want the egg?\u201d\n\u201cIt belongs to us.\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cIt has Oort code. It was not meant to . . . \u201d She hesitated. \u201cIt fell into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it, anyway?\u201d Geshem said. \u201cOort code.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s the Conversation,\u201d Ziz said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s that which isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThe Quietude,\u201d Mili said. Ziz turned sharply, her beak clicking.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n\u201cA shadow network?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d\nHe knew the Conversation was seeded throughout the solar system. It had begun on Earth and spread through near-space and across the Great Crossing to the Outer System, self-replicating Spiders clinging to rocks, converting them into further Spiders, routers and hubs, broadcasting stations, mirrors and servers . . .\nHow could another network exist, undetected, unknown, amidst all the teeming worlds of humanity?\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ziz said, just as Mili said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mili said, and she moved her gun, and this time she pointed it at the bird-woman.\n\u201cYou will forfeit your fee?\u201d Ziz said.\n\u201cIf this is what I think it is, then yes, gladly,\u201d Mili said.\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d Ziz said.\n\u201cA Quietude node,\u201d Mili said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s ready to hatch.\u201d\nZiz inched her head. The ghosts moved fast. Geshem was too slow to make it out clearly. They moved like, well, ghosts. But so did Mili.\nWhatever backstreet hardwire job she\u2019d had done was worth the money. Old military tech kicked in. The ghosts and Mili danced as their movements blurred. Then it was over, too quickly, and the ghosts lay on the ground. Mili\u2019s leg was broken. She pointed the gun at the bird-woman.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking him,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m just here to sell it,\u201d Geshem said. He ignored Mili. \u201cIf you have an offer to make . . . \u201d he said to Ziz.\n\u201cI will find you,\u201d Ziz said. \u201cWe will always find . . . it. We just listen to the quiet.\u201d\n\u201cMove it, Geshem,\u201d Mili said. She pushed him out and hobbled after him. She shut the door on the bird-woman and the ghosts.\n\u201cI could cut you in,\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\nShe pushed him along. He went deeper into the trees. He could feel the egg in the backpack. It was moving.\n8.\nHe tried to make a run for it nearer the ravine. Mili blurred and then she was in front of him. Even with her leg broken she was too fast. Geshem saw it cost her, though. She burned energy bad, speeding up like this. And she was wounded. He figured he could wait.\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking anything.\u201d\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d\nThey were deep in digitally federated quilt by then. They passed from Druze to Jew to First Human to Arab to Carmelite authority and all over again. To Geshem, this didn\u2019t mean anything. To him, the Carmel was all his. First Humans have lived here long before the first Sapis ever came.\nEvergreen. The mountain that is green all year round, as the old song went. Geshem knew where he was, where they were heading. He watched Mili, but she moved along faster now, and her leg looked better. Built-in medical nanobots repairing the damage. He was mildly impressed. Paying for this kind of wetware took some doing.\nA small black thing flew overhead and spoke to them.\n\u201cGeshem-Nofel-Ba\u2019oranim! This is Antiquities! Surrender yourself and your cargo!\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see she\u2019s kidnapping me!\u201d Geshem shouted at the drone.\n\u201c . . . Ah,\u201d the drone said.\n\u201cSo do something,\u201d Geshem said.\nThe drone extended two tiny rods and aimed it at them.\n\u201cMiss, drop down your weap\u2014\u201d\nThe drone exploded.\nGeshem ducked from the rain of hot plastic.\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Mili said. Something large and green and mean-looking hopped in front of them then. A Toad grinned. A tongue like a rope lashed out and snatched Mili\u2019s gun from her hand.\nMili said, \u201cRun!\u201d\nThat lash of a tongue whipped again, caught Geshem\u2019s arm, and pulled. Geshem pulled back and the Toad hopped over him and vanished in the pines, the tongue unspooling.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Geshem shouted. \u201cI\u2019m on your side! We had a deal!\u201d\nHe heard the Toads croak laughter all around them. Geshem ran helplessly after Mili. Her leg seemed fine now, and she was even faster now than before. How did she do it?\n\u201cYou stole from us, Neand!\u201d a voice boomed.\nBaigujing.\nSo the boss came in person.\n\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d Geshem shouted. His wrist hurt where the Toad\u2019s tongue had touched it. Poison Toads. But their poisons were designed for Sapis, not his kind.\nHe hoped.\n\u201cWe always find out, Geshem.\u201d\nA Toad hopped in their path and Mili blasted it with a hand cannon Geshem couldn\u2019t recall seeing before. The Toad exploded in a wet green cloud. Poisoned bits of Toad flesh landed. Geshem shielded his face.\n\u201cI\u2019ll sell it to you!\u201d he screamed. \u201cI don\u2019t even want it!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take it, and kill you,\u201d Baigujing said. Geshem saw him for just a moment. The boss Toad was huge, the size of two men, and hopped impossibly high, that grotesque body augmented with titanium muscles.\nThe forest was all around them then. Geshem heard something whisper through the air. Saw a ghost materialize and take out a Toad like it was nothing, a hand reaching inside the green flesh and squeezing its heart out. The ghost looked his way. Their eyes connected.\nHe saw dark shapes move behind the ghost\u2019s eyes. Dark entities, as large as planets . . .\n\u201cCome on, Geshem!\u201d\nMili pulled him on. She picked him up. She ran, leaped high, over ambushing Toads now fighting the cultists. Geshem knew what was up ahead.\nFirst Home.\n9.\n\u201cAre you kidnapping me or protecting me?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m doing both.\u201d\nThey were holed up in the cave. Mili checked her weapons. Geshem brooded. He was tired of being mixed up in Sapi affairs.\nHe took out the egg and placed it on a bedding of pine needles. He didn\u2019t know what it was. He wasn\u2019t sure he cared. Some sort of new digital life from the cold reaches of the solar system, in the dark places where the sun was a myth. The solar system was big, and it hosted a variety of life. Base Humans and First Humans and Martian Re-Borns, uplifted octopi, and sentient robots, who was to say what was born in the Oort? All life deserved a chance. Sometimes it even deserved a second. He placed his hand on the egg and felt its warmth. There was a life there.\n\u201cWhat do they want with you?\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhat will they do if they take you?\u201d\n\u201cI used to work for the Kunming Toads,\u201d Mili said.\n\u201cYeah? How did that work out for you?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cBadly.\u201d\nHe looked at her closely then. Saw the tiredness in her eyes, the taut muscles flexing, the way her fingers gripped the gun.\n\u201cWhy were you bartending?\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping an eye out for jobs?\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTry me.\u201d\n\u201cI was trying to go straight.\u201d\nShe smiled. Geshem smiled back.\n\u201cI can cut you in for a half of whatever this thing\u2019s worth,\u201d he said.\nShe shook her head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t worth anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything but trouble.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d He felt the egg again. It shuddered\u2014and was that a tiny crack?\n\u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cI want to see what it is,\u201d Mili said. \u201cWhen it hatches.\u201d\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\nThe sounds of battle outside. Toads versus ghosts. He wondered who\u2019d win.\nFirst Home. He didn\u2019t need to look around him. It was just a cave. But more than a hundred thousand years ago, First Humans had shared this space with the new humans who came out of Africa.\nThey\u2019d lived together, hunted together, cooked the meat together. Their babies were born here, and some of the babies were mixed, old human and new.\nThere had been love, here.\nGeshem thought of that cave more often than he should. He resented the Sapis. But he couldn\u2019t let go of the fact that it hadn\u2019t always been war. The genes of his people lived on in Homo Sapiens, evidence of that long-ago melding.\nWhat right did he have to decide for whatever this was, yet-to-be-born inside the egg?\n\u201cI\u2019ll make a fire,\u201d he said.\nHe set about collecting wood.\nNight fell outside, slowly.\n10.\nWhen at last they came it was neither Toads nor ghosts.\nTwo men in cheap suits walked in and stood and watched Geshem and Mili and the egg and the fire.\n\u201cCohen and Haddad,\u201d Geshem said.\n\u201cAntiquities,\u201d Mili said. She smiled. Geshem found that he liked her smile.\n\u201cSurrender the egg,\u201d Haddad said.\n\u201cOr what?\u201d Geshem said.\nTwo small, silver guns materialized in the men\u2019s hands. Off-world weapons, made for lighter gravity. He didn\u2019t know why those. Then he figured it out.\nHe looked at them with new eyes then.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he said.\nMili looked at him in confusion.\n\u201cBut they\u2019re legit,\u201d she said, \u201cI checked them u\u2014\u201d\nThe two men smiled in unison. And Geshem knew whoever Cohen and Haddad once were, the things that were flesh-surfing them were very different.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Geshem said.\nThe two men raised their guns to fire.\nWhich was when Ruach-Noshevet-Ba\u2019gfanim and the rest of Geshem\u2019s people fell on them.\nThe digitals riding the two Antiquities men struggled, but here in the Sanctuary there were very few resources connected to the Conversation, and even the old war drones and UXOs and robots were useless to them, being of obsolete makes and using outdated protocols: and so they had to fight with flesh alone, with fists and feet, and eventually they were subdued.\nThey looked up at him from the dirt. And the creature that was Cohen said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back for you,\u201d and the one that was Haddad said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back, Geshem-Nofel-Ba\u2019oranim.\u201d\nThen their bodies went slack, and their eyes went dull, and there was nothing there but two humans napping in the dirt.\nThe egg cracked then. Geshem heard it. He turned to look. Mili crouched by the egg, watching, and Geshem said, \u201cMaybe you should take a step back\u2014\u201d\nWhen the egg split right down the middle. Terrible heat escaped from within, bathing the cave in the light of a sun. Mili turned away then. She ran to Geshem. He held her hand, and they watched as something emerged from the hatching egg.\nIt was a wisp of darkness. A shadow that followed that blast of fire, because while true darkness exists alone, shadows are light\u2019s children. It was small at first, but it fed. It drew from the ancient stones and the dirt and the pines and pulled matter onto itself, and it fashioned itself a body. It gave itself wings and a tail. It raised a head, long and beautiful, and two eyes as dark as space looked into Geshem\u2019s own.\n\u201cShalom . . . \u201d Geshem said.\nThe creature opened a beak and cried. It lunged at Geshem. Geshem fell back, alarmed.\nBut the creature didn\u2019t harm him. Geshem looked up from his place in the dirt. He saw the priestess, Ziz, with an ugly curved knife in her hand. She had snuck up on Geshem while the bird was hatching. Now Ziz raised ugly talons and opened shimmering wings. She stared at the baby creature with eyes full of fear and love and avarice, and the knife dropped uselessly from her taloned hands.\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . \u201d she started to say.\nThe creature tore out her throat. It sank its beak into her soft belly and slurped, and as Ziz collapsed the creature grew again. It beat dark wings against the entrance of that ancient cave. It turned its head, just once, and looked at Geshem. Those dark eyes, and within them he saw the coldness of the Oort, and thought he knew something of the Nine Billion Hells . . .\nThen the creature cawed softly. It beat its wings and rose into the sky. For a moment it hovered against the moon. Then Geshem saw a second shape rise and join it.\n\u201cRoc . . . \u201d he said.\n\u201cI guess it missed its mother,\u201d Mili said. She reached down and helped Geshem up. They stood shoulder to shoulder and watched the creature fly away, until it became just another part of the night and was gone.\n11.\nThe stars burned on a low flame, as one of the old songs said. But Geshem sometimes longed for ancient music, the ones his progenitors must have made. They must have sung to the moon, they must have danced under the stars, right here on this land, before they went extinct. Archaeological finds could show you the bones of the animals they hunted and the tools that they made, the remnants of their homes and fires. But they could not teach you their tongue, their songs, what they believed in, how they prayed. He felt that loss acutely in himself.\n\u201cThe Toads will come after you, you know,\u201d Mili said. She was back behind bar. Geshem sat on a stool and played with an empty shot glass. He just liked the feel of it in his hands.\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t go into Sanctuary land again.\u201d\nMili laughed. \u201cNot if they know better,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t stay here forever.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll work it out with them,\u201d Geshem said. \u201cI\u2019ll work something out. What about you?\u201d\nMili shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll hire out again,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going to quit but . . . This whole thing reminded me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re missing?\u201d\n\u201cWhy I quit.\u201d\nShe touched his hand gently. Then someone called her on the other side of the bar, and she left, and Geshem sat alone.\nLavie Tidhar is author of Osama, The Violent Century, A Man Lies Dreaming, Central Station, Unholy Land, and By Force Alone.

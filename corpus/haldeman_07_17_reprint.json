But I was sitting safely boxed in my library carrel, reading a journal article, when the screen went blank and then blinked PAPER DOCUMENT INCOMING, which had never happened before\u2014who would bother to track you down at the library?\u2014and I had a premonition that was instantly confirmed.\nOne sheet of paper slid out with the sigil of the National Service Commission. I turned it right side up and pressed my thumb onto the thumbprint circle, and the words appeared: \u201cYou have been chosen to represent your country as a member of the Ninth Infantry Division, Twelfth Remote Combat Infantry Brigade,\u201d Soldierboys. \u201cYou will report to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, to begin RCIU training at 1200, 3 September 2054.\u201d\nJust before class registration, how considerate. I wouldn\u2019t be pulled out of school. I even had two weeks to pack and say my goodbyes.\nVarious options came to mind as I sat staring at the page. I could run to Sweden or Finland, where I\u2019d also face national service, but it wouldn\u2019t have to be military. I could take the Commission itself to court, pleading pacifism, asking to be reassigned to Road Service or Forestry. But I didn\u2019t belong to any pacifist groups and couldn\u2019t claim any religion.\nI could do like Bruce Cramer last year. Stoke up on painkillers and vodka and shoot off a toe. But his draft notice had been for the regular infantry, pretty dangerous.\nPeople who ran soldierboys never got shot at directly\u2014they sat in an underground bunker hundreds of miles from the battlefield, and operated remote robots that were invincible and armed to the teeth. Sort of like a sim, but the people you kill actually are people, and they actually do die.\nMost soldierboys didn\u2019t do that, I knew. There were about 20,000 of them dispersed throughout Ngumi territory, and most of them just stood guard, huge and impregnable, unkillable, symbols of Alliance might. Which is to say, American might, though about twelve percent came from elsewhere.\nMy advisor, Blaze Harding, was in her office a couple of buildings away, and said to bring the document over.\nShe studied the letter for much longer than it would take to read it. \u201cLet me explain to you . . . in how many dimensions you are fucked.\n\u201cYou could run. Finland, Sweden, Formosa. Forget Canada. It\u2019s a combat assignment, and you\u2019d be extradited. In any case, you\u2019d lose your grant, and it would be the end of your academic career. Likewise with going to jail.\n\u201cIf you obey the law and go in, you\u2019ll be like Sira Tolliver over in Mac Roman\u2019s office. You \u2018only\u2019 have to report ten days a month. But she seems to spend half her time recovering from those ten days.\u201d\n\u201cJust sitting in a little room?\u201d\n\u201cA cage, she calls it. Evidently it\u2019s a little more strenuous than sitting.\n\u201cThe plus side is that the department wouldn\u2019t dare drop you. If you just show up for work, your position with the Jupiter Project is as safe as tenure. As long as the grant holds out, which should be approximately forever.\u201d The Jupiter Project was building a huge supercollider in orbit around Jupiter, millions of electromagnetic doughnuts circling out by the orbit of Io.\n\u201cOnce they turn it on,\u201d I said, \u201cour worries will be over anyhow. Instantly sucked into a huge black hole.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I favor the \u2018explode and be scattered to the edge of the universe\u2019 theory. I always wanted to travel.\u201d We shared a laugh. The Project would simulate conditions 10 to the minus 35th seconds after the Big Bang, and the tabloids loved it.\n\u201cWell, at least I\u2019ll lose a few pounds in basic training. I\u2019ve been putting on two or three pounds a year since I graduated and left the soccer team.\u201d\n\u201cSome of us like them a little plump,\u201d she said, pinching the skin on my forearm. It was a funny situation. We\u2019d been attracted to each other since the day we met, three years ago, but it had never gone beyond banter. She was fifteen years older than me, and white. Which was not a problem on campus, but outside, Texas is Texas.\n\u201cI goo-wikied something you ought to see. Running a soldierboy isn\u2019t really just sitting around.\u201d She turned her clipboard around so I could read the screen.\nDISABILITY AND DEATH\nby\nMILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY\nper 100,000 annually\n|COMBAT\n|\nINJURY/DEATH\n|NON-COMBAT\n|\nINJURY/DEATH\n|INFANTRY||949.2 / 207.4||630.8 / 123.5|\n|RCI||248.9 / 201.7||223.9 / 125.6|\n\u201cNot really so safe, then.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the injuries in the RCI, combat or not, would all be brain injuries. You\u2019d be out of a job here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that to cheer me up.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but I\u2019m thinking you ought to try switching to the infantry, as crazy as that sounds. With your education and age, they\u2019d put you behind a desk for sure.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got two weeks to nose around. See how much latitude I\u2019ll have. But what about my job here?\u201d\nShe waved a hand in dismissal. \u201cYou can do it in twenty days a month. Actually, I was going to take you off the physics lab babysitting anyhow; just grade papers for 60 and help me with the 299 special projects.\u201d She looked at her calendar. \u201cI guess basic training will be full-time.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Sounds like it, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cFind out for me. If I have to kidnap somebody for October and November, I\u2019d better start looking around.\u201d She reached across the desk and patted my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s an inconvenience, Julian, but not a disaster. You\u2019ll come out on top.\u201d\nBlaze hadn\u2019t brought up the largest danger and the biggest attraction of being a \u201cmechanic,\u201d as the soldiers who operated the soldierboys were called. They all had to be jacked, a hole drilled into the back of the skull and an electronic interface inserted, so you shared the thoughts and observations, feelings, of the rest of your platoon. There were five men and five women in a platoon, so you become like a mythical beast, with ten brains, twenty arms, and five cocks, and five cunts. A lot of people tried to join up for that experience. That was not quite what the army was looking for.\nAlmost all mechanics were drafted, because the army needed a peculiar mix of attitudes and eptitudes. Empathy is obvious, being able to stay sane with nine other people sharing your deepest feelings and memories. But they also needed people who were comfortable with killing, for the so-called \u201chunter-killer\u201d platoons. They were the ones who got all the attention, the bonuses, even fan clubs. I could assume I wasn\u2019t going to be one of them. I didn\u2019t even like to go fishing, because of the blood and guts and hurting the fish.\nThe installation of the jack was also risky. The rate of failure was classified, but various sources put it between five and fifteen percent. Most of the failures didn\u2019t die, but I wondered how many of them went back to intellectual pursuits.\nI found out that basic training was indeed full time, for eight weeks. The first four weeks were intensely physical, old-fashioned boot camp\u2014not obviously useful for people who would spend their military career sitting in a cage, thinking. After four weeks, they installed the jack, and you started training in tandem with your other nine.\nI did apply to be reassigned, to infantry or medical or quartermaster (they crossed that off; you can\u2019t join a non-combat arm in time of war). I was rejected the day I applied.\nSo I increased my jogging from one mile a day to three, and worked out out on the gym machines every other day. Basic training had a bad reputation, and I wanted to be ready for the physical side of it.\nI also spent more social time with Blaze than I ever had before. She had no teaching load during the summer. I had legitimate reasons to drop by the Jupiter Project, though I could do most of my work from any computer console anywhere in the world. I tended to show up around lunchtime or when the office nominally closed at 5:00.\nYou couldn\u2019t call it dating, given the difference in our ages, but it wasn\u2019t just coworkers having lunch, either. It could have evolved into something if there\u2019d been more than two weeks, perhaps.\nBut on September second, she took me to the airport and gave me a tight hug and a kiss that was a little more interesting than a coworker saying \u201cgoodbye for now.\u201d\nWhen I got off the plane in St. Louis, there was a woman in uniform holding a card with my name and two others on it. She was bigger than me, and white, and looked pretty mean. I stifled the impulse to walk right by her and get a ticket to Finland.\nWhen the other two, a woman and a man, showed up, she walked us to an emergency exit that apparently had been disabled, then down onto the tarmac in the 105-degree heat. We walked a fast quarter-mile to where a couple of dozen people stood in ranks sweating beside a military bus.\n\u201cNo talking. Get your sorry ass in line.\u201d A big black man who didn\u2019t need a megaphone. \u201cPut your bags on the cart. You\u2019ll get them back in eight weeks.\u201d\n\u201cMy medicine\u2014\u201d a woman said.\n\u201cDid I say no talking?\u201d He glared at her. \u201cIf you filled out your medical forms correctly, your pills will be waiting for you. If not, you\u2019ll just have to die.\u201d\nA couple of people chuckled. \u201cShut up. I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d He stepped up to the biggest man and spoke quietly, his face inches away. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. In the next eight weeks, some of you may die. Usually from not following orders.\u201d\nWhen the fiftieth person came, he loaded us all into the bus, a wheeled oven. My god, I thought, Fort Leonard Wood must be over a hundred miles away. The windows didn\u2019t open.\nI sat down next to a pretty white woman. She glanced at me and then looked straight ahead. \u201cAre you going to mechanics\u2019 school?\u201d\n\u201cGo where they send me,\u201d she said with a South Texas drawl, not looking at me. Later that day I would learn that mechanics train with the regular infantry, \u201cshoes,\u201d for the first month, and it\u2019s not wise to reveal that you were going to spend all of your subsequent career sitting down in the air conditioning.\nWe only drove a couple of miles, though, to the military airport adjacent to the civil one, and piled into a flying-wing troop transport, where we were stuffed onto benches without seatbelts. It was a fast and bumpy twenty-minute flight, the big sergeant standing in front of us, hanging on to a strap, glaring. \u201cAnybody pukes, he has to clean it up while everybody else waits.\u201d Nobody did.\nWe landed on a seriously bumpy runway and were separated by gender and marched off in two different directions. The men, or \u201cdicks,\u201d were led into a hot metal building, where we took off all our clothes and put them in plastic bags marked with our names. If they were going to ferment for eight weeks, the army could keep them.\nThey said we would get clothes when we needed them, and had us shuffle through a line where we contributed blood and urine and got two shots in each arm and one in the butt, the old-fashioned way, painful. Then we walked through a welcome shower into a room with piles of towels and clothing, fatigues sorted more or less by size. Then we actually got to sit down while three dour men with robot assistants measured our feet and brought us boots.\nThere was a rotating holo of a handsome guy showing us what we were supposed to look like\u2014the trouser legs \u201cbloused\u201d into boots, shirt seam perfectly aligned with belt buckle and fly, shirt sleeves neatly rolled to mid-forearm. His fatigues were new and tailored, though; ours were used and approximate. He wasn\u2019t sweating.\nI thought I\u2019d second-guessed the army by having my hair cut down to a half-inch burr. They shaved me down to the skin, in retribution.\nThe sun was low and it had cooled down to about ninety, so they took us for a little run. That didn\u2019t bother me except for being overdressed. We went around a quarter-mile cinder track, in formation. After four laps, the women joined us, and together we did eight more.\nThen they piled all of us, hot and dripping, into a freezing mess hall. We waited in a long line for cold greasy fried chicken, cold mashed potatoes, and warm wilted salad.\nThe woman who sat down across from me watched me strip the sodden fried batter from the chicken. \u201cOn a diet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. No disgusting food.\u201d\n\u201cI think you goin\u2019 to lose a lot of weight.\u201d We shook hands across the table. Carolyn from Georgia, a pretty black woman a little younger than me. \u201cWhat, you graduated and got nailed?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Ph.D. in physics.\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cI know where you\u2019re goin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cYou, too?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t know why. B.F.A. in Creative Viewing.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s your favorite show?\u201d\n\u201cHate \u2018em all. Unlike most folks, I know why I hate \u2018em. Now tell me you\u2019d die if you didn\u2019t get your Kill Squad fix every week.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have a cube, or time to watch it. When I was a kid, my parents only let me watch ten hours a week.\u201d\n\u201cWow . . . would you marry me? Or you got somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 already.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gay, except for sheep.\u201d\n\u201cEwe.\u201d We both laughed a little too hard at that.\nShoe training was about half PT and half learning how to use weapons we\u2019d never see again, as mechanics. Even the shoes would probably never use a bayonet or knife or bare hands\u2014how often would you not have a gun, and face an enemy who didn\u2019t have one either?\n(I knew the rationale was more subtle, training us to be aggressive. I wasn\u2019t sure that was a good idea for mechanics, though\u2014your soldierboy might wipe out a village because you lost your temper.)\nCarolyn\u2019s last name was Collins, and we were next to each other in the alphabet. We spent a lot of time talking, sometimes sotto voce when we were standing in formation, which got us into trouble a couple of times. (\u201cOne of you lovebirds runs around the track while the other finishes painting this wall.\u201d)\nI was really smitten with her\u2014I mean the kind of brain-chemistry-level addiction that you ought to be able to control by the time you\u2019re eighteen. I thought of her all the time, and lived to see her face when we mustered in the mornings. Her expressions and gestures made me think she felt the same way about me, though we carefully wouldn\u2019t use the word \u201clove.\u201d\nAfter two weeks of constant training, they unexpectedly gave us half a Sunday off. A bus took us into St. Robert, a small town that existed to separate soldiers from their money. We had to be back by 6 sharp, or we\u2019d be AWOL.\nOn the way to the bus station in St. Robert, we passed several hotels and motels that advertised HOURLY RATES / CLEAN SHEETS. When we got off the bus, I faltered, trying to frame a proposition, and she grabbed me by the arm and pulled me through the closest place\u2019s door.\nWe\u2019d never even kissed before. So we did some of that while trying to get each other\u2019s fatigues off without popping any buttons.\nSpeaking of popping, I was not exactly the long-lasting partner-oriented lover I would\u2019ve liked to have been. But I had a certain amount of hydrostatic as well as psychological pressure built up; the barracks offered no privacy for masturbation.\nShe laughed that off, though, and we just played around for awhile, until I was ready for a more patient and slow coupling. It was better than my dreams.\nWe had an hour before we had to be on the bus. There was a bar next door, but Carolyn didn\u2019t feel like being stared at by our fellow draftees. So we sat on the damp and rumpled sheets and shared a glass of metallic-tasting water.\n\u201cDid you try to get out of it?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWell, yeah. My adviser pointed out that if I joined the infantry, at my age and with my education, I\u2019d just have a desk job for a couple of years.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right. You believe that now?\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cThey\u2019d put me in a bayonets-only platoon. Get out there and stab for your country.\u201d\n\u201cGod and country. Don\u2019t forget God.\u201d\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for God, we wouldn\u2019t get half of Sunday off.\u201d\n\u201cPraise the Lord.\u201d She took my penis between two fingers and wiggled it. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any juice left in this little guy.\u201d\n\u201cNot for a while. We could do it on the bus.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Hold you to it.\u201d She yawned and stretched, so hard a couple of joints popped. \u201cMaybe we should go get a beer. Show those lonely cunts who got her man.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d Though I doubted there was much loneliness in town.\nShe dressed me carefully, smoothing the uniform down with long slow strokes. Then she stroked my face and my hands, eyes closed, as if she were memorizing.\nShe held me close then, and took a long deep breath. \u201cThank you, Julian,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s been some while.\u201d\nSo I tried to dress her, but got the buttons wrong. All very romantic. It\u2019s also easier to take panties off of someone than put them back on.\nThe nonsmoking part of the bar still had a whiff of tobacco and light weed. Ice-cold beer but no place to sit. So we stayed at the bar, loud with music and laughing, and nodded hello to some of our fellow trainees.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t grow up in the south,\u201d she said. \u201cYou talk funny, you don\u2019t mind my sayin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cActually, I was born in Georgia, but my parents moved north before I started school, Delaware. Then four years at Harvard will screw up your accent forever.\u201d\n\u201cYou majored in science.\u201d\n\u201cPhysics, then astrophysics for the master\u2019s. Moved into particle physics for the doctorate. Post-doc, too, assuming basic doesn\u2019t kill me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know shit about any of that.\u201d\n\u201cNever expect anyone to.\u201d I put my hand on hers. \u201cLike I know anything about film.\u201d\n\u201cJoo-lian.\u201d She slid her hand away. \u201cNever condescend to someone who can kill you with a single blow. Six different ways.\u201d\n\u201cSorry. Takes you four years to get a degree at Harvard, and then forty to get over it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t waitin\u2019 forty. You best get your shit together.\u201d But she smiled and put her hand back.\nA short private from the permanent party walked through the door with a megaphone. \u201cAw-right, you listen up. Trainees Charlie Company, you bus is heah. You not in that bus in five minutes, you AWOL. We come back heah and put you ass in chains.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence when he went through the door, and then a low murmur.\n\u201cHow could they put just your ass in chains, and not the rest of you?\u201d\n\u201cThink big stapler,\u201d she said, and finished off her beer. \u201cChariot awaits.\u201d\nThe next two weeks didn\u2019t have any Sundays. Now that they were pretty sure that no one was going to have a heart attack doing laps, they pushed us to the wall. The morning after our afternoon-long furlough, they woke us up at 2:30, striding through the barracks beating on metal pans. Five minutes to dress, then a ten-mile run with full pack and rifle. When people stopped to puke, we had to run in place, shouting \u201cPussy, pussy!\u201d\nThey continued with the early-morning runs about every third day, increasing them by a mile each time. The drill instructors acted like it was malicious torture, but it was obviously well planned. We had to get the running in, but if we did it during those hundred-degree-plus days, people would get heatstroke and die.\nThe instructors also made sure everybody knew that the intensity of training was our own fault. \u201cOnly got four weeks to turn these CGI pussies into soldiers\u201d was the refrain.\nCarolyn and I did have one more opportunity, a thirty-minute lunch break in thick woods. I got poison ivy on my butt, and she on her feet. We had the same medic look at us, and he advised us to next time take along something like a shelter half or at least a newspaper. But there never was a next time, not in basic training.\nThe first day of CGI training, they took the fifty of us in a bus with blacked-out windows to someplace that might have been a half-hour away, or a mile, going in circles. It was in deep woods, though, and underground.\nA camouflaged door slid open to reveal dimly-lit stairs going down. The entrance was guarded by two huge soldierboys, whose camouflage perfectly mimicked the woods behind them. If you stood still, you couldn\u2019t see them; walking by them, they looked like a heat shimmer roughly the shape of a nine-foot-tall man.\nThe underground complex was large. We stood in formation in a foyer and a private read our names off a clipboard and gave us platoon designations and room numbers. Carolyn and I were both Alpha Platoon and went to room A.\nThere were ten hard chairs in the room and, incongruously, a table with party snacks and a tub full of iced drinks. An older man in a jumpsuit with no insignia watched us file in.\nHe didn\u2019t speak until the last of us sat down. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you here alone for one hour and thirty minutes. Your job is to get to know one another.\n\u201cIn a couple of days, you\u2019re all going to be jacked, and none of you will have any secrets from the others. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\n\u201cWhen I leave the room, please take off all your clothes. Get a drink and a snack and . . . tell each other your secrets, your problems. It will be easier for you to deal with one another if you have some preparation.\n\u201cWhen the bell rings, you should get dressed, and I\u2019ll come back to talk with you. Yes, private?\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cI . . . I\u2019ve never been naked in front of a man. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to be. You didn\u2019t have brothers?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\u201cIn a couple of days, you\u2019ll have five of them. And \u2018naked\u2019 does not begin to describe how exposed you\u2019ll be. But you will all be gentlemen?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d we all said. She was a pretty little blonde, and I was half looking forward to seeing the rest of her and half sympathetic with her anxiety.\nHe smiled, face crinkling. \u201cJust look each other in the eyes and you\u2019ll be all right.\u201d He left the room.\nI talked with Lou Mangiani while we undressed, both of us studiously not looking at the women (but seeing them with some intensity). Lou\u2019s in his late twenties, working as a baker in New York City, for his father\u2019s Italian restaurant. That\u2019s about as much as I knew about anybody except Carolyn. For the past four weeks, we had trained till we dropped and got up hours before our bodies wanted to; not much time for chat.\nCarolyn and Candi joined us. We\u2019d wondered in shoe training what Candi was doing here. She was a gentle\u2014you\u2019d have to say \u201cdelicate\u201d\u2014woman, whose civilian job was grief counseling. I suppose you have to be pretty tough to do that, actually.\nShe was also a natural leader for this sort of thing. She clapped once. \u201cLet\u2019s get these chairs in a circle,\u201d she said to everyone. \u201cGet sorted out boy-girl, boy-girl.\u201d\nRichard Lasalle was beet-red, with a large prominent erection. I was myself trying to think about anything else, running through prime numbers and tables of integrals.\nNone of the women were eager to sit next to him. Carolyn gave my hand a little tug and strode over to him, and stuck her hand out. \u201cYou\u2019re Richard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He nodded\u2014\u201cDick\u201d would not be a good choice\u2014and she introduced herself and sat down. I took the other seat next to her and the pretty little blonde, Arlie, quickly perched on the other side of me, probably figuring I was \u201ctaken\u201d and therefore safe. She crossed her perfect legs and hid her breasts behind folded arms.\nCandi was the opposite, totally casual, leaning back legs akimbo. Samantha and Sara, who had been in modest crouches, looked at Candi and unfolded.\n\u201cSo let\u2019s go around the circle and everybody come up with something important that you normally keep secret. After tomorrow, we won\u2019t have any secrets.\u201d Slow nods. \u201cI should start it.\u201d She paused for some time, rubbing her chin and the side of her face. \u201cMy clients, my patients, don\u2019t know this. Why I became a grief counselor. I was once so devastated I, I killed myself.\n\u201cI jumped off a bridge. In Cape Cod in January. I was dead for ten or twelve minutes, but the water was so cold they were able to bring me back.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d Akeem said. \u201cBeing dead.\u201d\n\u201cNothing; I just went unconscious. I think the impact knocked me out.\u201d She ran a finger between her breasts. \u201cI woke up when they shocked my heart, in the ambulance.\u201d\n\u201cYou had a reason,\u201d I said.\nShe nodded. \u201cWatched my father die. We were on the interstate and the steering and the failsafes cut out at the same time. We flipped and crashed into traffic. The airbags inflated but the accident kept happening; another truck smashed into us and knocked us off an overpass. When we finally came to rest . . . my mother\u2019s head was crushed and my father was drowning in his own blood. I wasn\u2019t in too bad shape, but was pinned in place. I had to just hang there upside down and watch my father die. About two feet away.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get his image out of my head. So I jumped off the bridge. And somehow wound up here. Lou?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cGod, I never had anything like that.\u201d He shook his head a couple of times, looking down. \u201cI was maybe thirteen. There was a gang my parents forbid me to hang around with, so of course I did. They thought I was out doing church stuff, but they never went, so I could fake it, I thought.\n\u201cThese were junior goombahs, apprentice Mafia. I was the lookout while they did nickel-and-dime stuff. Robbing machines, shoplifting. Stealing cars for joyrides when people were careless enough to leave them unlocked.\n\u201cWe got word that this old Jew who ran a news shop and candy store in the Bronx sold guns under the table. The back door looked like it would be easy enough to break in. So at one in the morning, I snuck down the fire escape and ran down a bunch of side streets to meet them.\n\u201cThey knew for sure the old guy locked up and went home about ten. It was easy to crack the back door with a crowbar.\n\u201cThis was the first thing we\u2019d done where I wasn\u2019t \u2018the kid.\u2019 A younger boy stood lookout and I went in first, because I was still a juvenile. If something went wrong, I wouldn\u2019t get hard time.\n\u201cI went in with a flashlight and started opening drawers, looking for guns. Well, I found one, but it was in the fist of the old Jew. He hadn\u2019t gone home that night.\n\u201cI heard him cock the gun and swung around, and I guess dazzled him with the light. \u2018Turn that off, boy,\u2019 he said. But the guy with the crowbar had come up behind him, and bashed his head with a two-handed swing. He went down like a log, but the guy kept hitting him. Then he picked the gun up off the floor and thanked me for thinking fast.\n\u201cWe ransacked the place, wearing rubber gloves, but there were no other guns, nor anything else of much value. We couldn\u2019t open or even move the cash box. We took a bunch of candy and cigarettes.\n\u201cThe next day the newspaper reported the murder-robbery. I didn\u2019t say anything to anybody. I could have called in anonymously and identified the murderer, but I was afraid.\u201d\n\u201cHe ever get caught?\u201d Mel asked.\n\u201cNot that I know of. He went down for drug dealing and I went off to college. Now I\u2019m here.\u201d\nEverybody looked at Arlie. \u201cI got caught having sex. With the wrong person.\u201d She looked at the floor. \u201cBy my husband. In our bedroom. I promised not to see this person again . . . not to see her again.\u201d She looked up with a trembling smile. \u201cDetails tomorrow.\u201d\nMy turn. \u201cI got caught jerking off?\u201d Some nervous laughter. \u201cI guess the worst thing . . . it might seem even more trivial, to some. But it drove me crazy with guilt at the time, and it still bothers me, more than ten years later.\n\u201cI was, what, fifteen, walking down an alley, and I saw a turtle, which was rare. A pretty big box turtle. It pulled in its head and legs. I poked it with a stick and it just sat there, of course.\n\u201cOn impulse, I picked up a brick and threw it down with all my might. The shell cracked open and the turtle squirmed around, all pale and bloody. I ran away as fast as I could go.\u201d\nAfter a pause, Candi said, \u201cYeah, I can see that. Even though my family used to fish for turtles and cut them up for soup. I grew up thinking of them as food.\u201d She looked at Carolyn and raised her eyebrows.\nShe shook her head. \u201cGuess I\u2019ve led a sheltered life. Nothing sexy or violent. I did get caught masturbating, but my mother just laughed and told me to do it in my own room.\n\u201cThere was a test, a chemistry final, when I was a junior in high school. A girl who worked in the office found a copy of it and sold it to me for ten bucks.\n\u201cThat was bad enough; I mean, I\u2019d never done anything like that before. But what was worse was that I already knew most of the answers\u2014would\u2019ve gotten a B, anyhow. And now this girl had proof that I was a cheat, and could tell anybody anytime.\n\u201cSo I killed her.\u201d She looked up and grinned. \u201cOnly in my dreams, actually.\u201d\nRichard had enlivened a grown-ups\u2019 party by putting a laxative in the punch, but he used a bit too much, and put several people in the hospital. (Including himself, to deflect attention.)\nSamantha stole money from her mother\u2019s purse for years, whenever she came home drunk.\nMel played vicious tricks on his retarded brother.\nSara helped her father die.\nAkeem struggled, and finally confessed that he had never believed in Allah, not even as a child, but had lacked the courage to admit it and leave the faith.\nIt was an exhausting and awkward two hours, but obviously necessary.\nWhen we got the bell to get dressed, I was a little surprised to find that I wasn\u2019t looking at the women sexually anymore. But there were a couple that perhaps I could love.\nWe never went back to Fort Leonard Wood. The blacked-out bus took us to the St. Louis airport, where they gave us back the personal effects we\u2019d surrendered a month before, laundered, and put us aboard a flight to Portobello.\nThe plane went over a lot of water, staying carefully away from Nicaraguan and Costa Rican airspace. Ngumi nations don\u2019t have air forces; our flyboys would just disintegrate them. But they could still throw missiles at us.\nIt was nighttime when we landed, the air thick and greasy. The base was an unremarkable collection of low buildings, with the solid gleaming presence of the occasional soldierboy. They stood guard around the perimeter of the base, which they said had never been successfully attacked. I had to wonder how much damage an \u201cunsuccessful\u201d attack could do.\nBut that\u2019s good. We would be spending a third of our lives here, somewhere underground, only dozens of miles from enemy territory. Nice to be safe behind a phalanx of invulnerable telepathic robots. Feel safe, anyhow.\nNot really robots, and not completely invulnerable. Each was really an oversized, heavily armed suit of armor that was the telepresent avatar of one man or woman, who operated in instant concert with nine others. Each ten-person platoon was a telepathic family that, with training, would work as one powerful entity.\nThe enemy could destroy an individual soldierboy, but its operator, the mechanic, could be instantly switched to a reserve machine and be back in the field in minutes\u2014or even seconds, if the backup was stored nearby. And whoever had destroyed the first one, they well knew, would get special attention from its replacement.\nI suspected that was just propaganda, part of the mystique that personified the machines, to make them more effective psychological weapons. Any emotion that makes a human being dangerous, they had. But they couldn\u2019t die, or even be hurt.\n(The \u201churt\u201d part was not completely true, which was a closely guarded secret and perennial rumor. If a soldierboy was disabled and captured, the Ngumi would elaborately torture it in front of cameras, before destroying it.)\nAmericans laughed that off, saying that it might work with voodoo dolls, but not machines. You turn a machine off, it\u2019s just a bag of bolts.\nBut you have to turn it off in time.\nOur quarters in Portobello were neat but perfunctory, and barely large enough to turn around in. But we wouldn\u2019t be spending much time in them. Mechanics worked and slept, ate and drank and eliminated, without being unplugged, which took a certain amount of intrusive plumbing. But they didn\u2019t open you up for that surgery until they knew whether you could be jacked.\nThe first day in Portobello, we were wheeled off one at a time for the most dramatic \u201croutine\u201d surgery known to medicine\u2014the installation of cybernetic cranial implants, or jacks, as they were always called. It seems more dangerous than it is. They\u2019ve done it a hundred thousand times, and it\u2019s worked for about ninety thousand.\nOf the one in ten for whom it doesn\u2019t work, most simply go back to regular life, without the ambiguous gift of being able to share another\u2019s mind and body totally. Some few for whom it doesn\u2019t work become mentally or emotionally handicapped. Some few die.\nThe numbers are not published.\nBeing a physicist, I can figure out some numbers by myself. If something\u2014jacking successfully\u2014has a ninety percent chance of success, and if ten people do it, the probability of one of them failing is one minus 0.9 to the tenth power, which equals 0.65. So 65% of the time, more than half, at least one of the ten is going to fail.\nSo logic would say \u201cdo eleven.\u201d But what if all eleven made it? You\u2019d have to pull one out, and that would be like a casualty, they say. It\u2019s easier to add to a family than subtract.\nAll ten of us made it, and spent the next two days in bed rest. The third day, we started exploring the gift.\nThe man who first led us through it, Kerry, was apparently a civilian, a therapist in his seventies.\n\u201cYour first time shouldn\u2019t be with a beginner,\u201d he said. We were back in a place like Room A, government-green walls, the hard chairs and tub of drinks, but with an addition: two couches waiting with a black box between them. Two cables snaked out of the black box.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all going to jack with me for a few minutes first. That will take about an hour for ten people. I don\u2019t foresee any trouble, but if there is, best to have someone like me in the circuit.\u201d\n\u201cLike you, sir?\u201d Candi said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see why.\u201d He looked at a clipboard. \u201cAzuzi first.\u201d Akeem stood and followed him to the couches.\n\u201cClose your eyes. Lie down.\u201d He took a cable and planted the jack in the base of Akeem\u2019s skull with a soft click. Then he sat on the edge of the other couch and did the same to himself.\nHe closed his eyes and rocked gently for a couple of minutes. Then he unplugged himself and Akeem.\nAkeem shook his head and sat up with a shiver. \u201cOh. That was . . . extreme,\u201d he whispered.\nKerry nodded. Neither of them elaborated. \u201cJulian Class?\u201d\nI went over and lay down and faced the wall away from him. There was a little click when the jack touched the metal implant, and then I was sort of seeing double with my whole body.\nIt\u2019s hard to describe accurately. I still saw the wall, two feet away, but almost as clearly, I saw what Kerry was looking at, the group of mechanics staring back at him and me.\nAnd all at once, I knew him, almost the way I knew myself. I could feel the body in his clothes as well as the clothes on his body; the somatic shifting of soft organs inside, and the complex array of muscle and bone\u2014things that we feel all the time, but which become invisible with familiarity\u2014small twinges and itches and deep pain in the right shoulder I\u2019d have to, he\u2019d have to, stop ignoring . . .\nI remembered everything he routinely remembered about himself, bad and good and neutral. Comfortable childhood cut short by divorce, college a magnificent escape; a rewarding doctorate in developmental psychology. Sex with two women and dozens of men. Somehow that didn\u2019t seem even odd. Four years as a mechanic in Africa, driving trucks that got blown up regularly.\nLike a memory of a memory, I could feel the union he\u2019d felt with the other mechanics in his transportation platoon, and his longing for the sensation.\nIt was over with a click. I looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re doing this?\u201d\nHe smiled. \u201cThough it\u2019s not the same. Like singing in the shower when you used to be in a choir.\u201d\nCarolyn was next, and when she sat back down next to me, she softly nudged me with her hip, and you didn\u2019t need telepathy to know we were thinking the same thing.\nOne by one, the others had their sample.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cThat was the first stage of your warm-up. Now we go to the next level.\u201d We followed him into an adjacent room.\nTen of the so-called \u201ccages\u201d were lined up along the far wall. They were like recliners with lots of plumbing and electronics attached.\nWe wouldn\u2019t have to do the plumbing until the end of Basic, since we wouldn\u2019t be plugged in for more than a few hours at a time. When it became ten days, our usual monthly stint, we\u2019d have to be fed and emptied automatically, which they said wasn\u2019t bad once you got used to it.\nThe soldierboys we were going to be plugged into were in a vacant lot somewhere outside. For the first couple of days, we did \u201craise your right foot, raise your left foot\u201d exercises; then walking and going up stairs. By the third day, we were jogging in formation, having crossed a major threshold: knowing you had to stop thinking about what you were doing, and just do it. Trust the machine. The machine is you.\nMeanwhile, we started hooking up to each other in the evenings, without the soldierboys, one on one and then in larger groups.\nBeing with Carolyn was thrilling and a little scary\u2014if anything, she felt even more strongly about me than I did about her. And we were so totally different\u2014her intuitive intelligence versus my analytical nature, her streetwise emotionally jarring youth played out against the support and love I\u2019d gotten from my family. Our bodies were different not just in female/male matters; she was small and fast and I was neither. We enjoyed experimenting with each other\u2019s bodies; she said every girl should have a dick of her own for awhile. I enjoyed the strangeness of being her, and then the familiarity, though the first time I menstruated it was like a shocking wound, even though I was ready for it. She was sympathetic but amused\u2014\u201cyou big pussy\u201d\u2014and I eventually got over it, though I never got to the point, like her, of looking forward to it, as a kind of affirmation of \u201cmy\u201d womanhood.\n(None of the other women had that attitude, I came to find out. Sara and Arlie had suppressed ovulation for an indefinite length of time, and the other two didn\u2019t especially like it, but didn\u2019t like the anti-fertility drugs either.)\nBeing linked to the others, male and female, was less intense than with Caroline, though it was pretty sexual with Sara, Candi, and Mel. That was odd enough\u2014Mel wasn\u2019t like Kerry; he\u2019d never had or desired sex with a man. When he was linked with me or one of the other guys, though, it was pretty obvious that he\u2019d been suppressing a natural attraction to his own sex, and that\u2019s something you couldn\u2019t hide from another mechanic even if you wanted to. After some initial embarrassment, he didn\u2019t want to hide it.\nWhen we were just doing one-on-one, the other eight people\u2019s life stories were pretty far away, like a novel you\u2019d intensely studied in school. When we started doing threesomes and more, it was a lot more complicated. At first, you\u2019d lose track of who\u2014or where\u2014the \u201cI\u201d was. With two, you could be in a state where both lives merged in a kind of selfless integration. I could do that with about half of them.\nWith three in the circuit, that couldn\u2019t happen. At first, there was a kind of existential battle for possession, for \u201cturf,\u201d but with experience it became obvious that each person had to hold on to his or her own sense of \u201cI,\u201d or the asymmetries would drive everybody crazy. It was hard for me and Carolyn, and a few other pairs, like Samantha and Arlie, to let go of one another and let a third person in, but if you didn\u2019t, the triad would never work together. One person always on the outside, looking in on a love feast.\nWe spent a lot of time, about four days, switching around among triads. That made the foursomes and larger groups pretty simple, having mastered the basic trick: Each of us was an \u201cI\u201d identified by the life story we had when we weren\u2019t jacked, but you had a number of partners, between two and nine of them, each with the same degree of autonomy as you, who intimately shared their pasts and presence.\nWe could only be jacked for a maximum of two hours running, followed by at least thirty minutes unplugged, which was frustrating. It would be years before we understood why: if you stayed jacked for too long, the feeling of empathy with others became so strong that any human became a part of you; killing anybody would be as impossible as suicide. Which could be a real handicap for a soldier.\nWe did learn about soldiering at visceral second hand, by jacking into crystals other people had recorded during battle. It was confusing at first, because you were intimate with ten strangers, and you had no physical control over the soldierboy you inhabited. But the combat was real enough, more real than it could ever be, second-hand, merely human.\nCandi was deeply depressed by the experience, and I think only Mel was eager to repeat it. But we all saw how necessary it was. A dress rehearsal for Hell.\nI was surprised when they made me platoon leader. I was the oldest, but not by much, and the most educated, but particle physics wasn\u2019t exactly relevant to leadership. The unflattering truth became obvious early on. They didn\u2019t want a \u201cnatural leader,\u201d like Lou or Candi, in charge, because he or she would take over the platoon too completely\u2014instead of ten people working in concert, you\u2019d have one guy making all the decisions, with nine people reviewing them after the fact. That would mirror old-fashioned hierarchic military organization, with the alpha male calling the shots and the lesser doggies falling into line. But if that happened, you\u2019d just wasted a lot of time and money, and risked ten brains in surgery, for no advantage. A soldierboy platoon was like one huge machine that could take over acres of battlefield, making instant decisions with a kind of gestalt intelligence. It was eerie to watch, but became less and less strange to be part of.\nWe had the minor surgery that took care of nutrition, hydration, and excretion, recovered for a couple of days, and then went out on our first \u201cfield exercise\u201d\u2014in the middle of enemy territory.\nThe ten of us, of course, were safe underground, in a bombproof bunker in Portobello. But our soldierboys walked out ten miles beyond the perimeter, where any pedro could risk his life and attack. But there was an experienced hunter-killer platoon in a protective circle around our machines. Safer than sitting at home, watching it on the cube. You could get struck by lightning there.\nWe had two more walkabouts like that, never confronting an enemy, and then Basic was over, and we could go home for twenty days. None of us went straight home, though. We had to try the jack joints that ringed the base at Portobello.\nAt a jack joint, you could pay to plug into other people\u2019s experiences. A lot of them were records of soldierboy battle encounters, which we didn\u2019t have to pay for, thank you. The flyboy crystals did look appealing, \u201cbeing\u201d an aircraft capable of banks and dives and accelerations that no human pilot could execute.\nBut apart from the military ones, there were adventure crystals, of people doing dangerous things in odd places, and \u201cappetite\u201d ones, where you could experience food and drink you could never afford. There were even suicide crystals, for the most extreme experience possible, though you had to sign a waiver before they\u2019d let you enjoy it, in case you empathized enough to die yourself. It was the ultimate in something, like that Japanese sushi with natural neurotoxins that will kill you if the chef makes a mistake.\nAnd of course there was sex. Sex with beautiful people who in real life would never even say hello to you, sex in places where you would be arrested if they caught you, daredevil sex, weird sex, sweet and sour and salty sex.\nSex with Carolyn.\nDuring training they only jacked you through cages, to get used to it, so you couldn\u2019t physically touch anyone you were jacked with. Most of the jack joints outside the base only offered solitary experiences, but in a few expensive ones, two people could jack together in real time, in private. Sort of like the motels in Rock City, though they advertised environmentos sanitos rather than clean sheets, and charged by the minute rather than the hour.\nWe asked around and went to Celito Lindo, a place that did look clean. The women who hovered around the entrance, so-called jills, didn\u2019t molest us, but stared deeply at me, and some at Carolyn: if you think it\u2019s good with an amateur, come back and try it again with a pro.\nThe mamacita in charge was fat and jolly, and told us the rules: Timer starts the second you close the door, and stops when you come back to the desk and pick up your credit card. Lie there and murmur sweet nothings; they cost the same as sweet somethings.\nI asked her whether people ever burst out of the room stark naked, and sprint for the credit card. \u201cI have them arrested for indecent exposure,\u201d she said, \u201cunless I\u2019m extremely entertained.\u201d I decided not to press my luck.\nThe room was small and clean and smelled heavily of jasmine. There was nothing in it but a large bed with a pile of pillows. The sheet felt like freshly starched cotton, but was dispensed by a practical and unromantic roller.\nWe\u2019d had sex a couple of hours earlier, so it wouldn\u2019t be over immediately, but we were both more than ready when we shucked our clothes and jacked and fell into bed. I kissed and tasted her all over, feeling our mutual tongue on the skin we shared. When we tasted me inside of her, I shared her orgasm, but kept just enough \u201cI\u201d not to ejaculate.\nShe straddled me and slid back and forth once, and I snapped into her with the springy force of a horny teenager. She held my hips still, telling me wordlessly not to thrust, and for a few moments we merged completely, as I flowed into her and she into me, until neither of us could stand it, and we bucked so hard we rolled off the bed, and lay there gasping.\n\u201cNice carpet,\u201d she said while we felt our skin against the rough pile. One of us had bruised a hip in the fall. When we unjacked, I realized it was hers.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cClumsy.\u201d She stroked my retreating dick.\n\u201cThat musta been at least ten seconds,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put on some pants and go get your card.\u201d\nWe went to the Celito Lindo three more times, and once tried Falling In Love, where you made love, or had sex, during an endless fall from an airplane, and floated gently to earth afterward. But then we did have to literally get back down to earth, Carolyn to her studies and me to my measurements and equations.\nParting was like losing a limb, or part of your mind, but knowing you\u2019d be whole again in three weeks.\nI tried to explain it to Blaze, the first day I was back. We were having coffee in a quiet corner of the Student Center.\n\u201cYou know what it sounds like,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m just being an old mother hen here . . . but it\u2019s like you had an intense summer romance, rendered even more intense by the pressure of the military environment, and then the jacking squared it, and then making love while you were jacked cubed it. But you can square x and cube x, and it\u2019s still x.\u201d\n\u201cStill just an infatuation.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cYou really think it will last forever, though.\u201d\n\u201cAs much of forever as we get.\u201d\nShe sipped her coffee, still nodding. \u201cThe Siamese-twin aspect. That\u2019s a little creepy.\u201d\nI laughed. \u201cIt is. It\u2019s really impossible to explain in words.\u201d\nShe stared at me in a funny way. \u201cWish I could try it. I\u2019m just jealous.\u201d Maybe I blushed. \u201cNot of Carolyn, silly. Of you both, of the whole experience.\u201d\nBlaze would lose her grant and her job if she got jacked. Most contracts for intellectual jobs had no-jacking clauses, for obvious reasons; I was protected because my military jack wasn\u2019t voluntary. The operation for jacking wasn\u2019t even legal in the States for civilians, though hundreds crossed the border every day to have it done.\nI had tremendous respect for Blaze, and wanted so much for her to understand. But I suppose it was like a deeply religious person trying to explain her ecstasy to someone like me, before. Samantha was like that, and I understood her instantly, below the level of words, the moment we jacked together. As she understood me, and forgave my unbelief.\nBlaze did have legitimate professional concerns, because I was far from being an ideal coworker. I couldn\u2019t concentrate well. At some level, I was never not thinking about Carolyn, and at another level it had to show. I couldn\u2019t look at a calendar without counting the days until I gave up my freedom again.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take the weekend off and go to Georgia?\u201d Blaze said on Thursday morning. \u201cCan\u2019t you soldierboys fly for free?\u201d\nI was a mechanic, and the machine was a soldierboy, but it was a mistake often made. \u201cI was planning to work over the weekend, catch up.\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you catch up with Carolyn instead? The Jupiter Project will lurch along somehow without you.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t happy about being so transparent, but couldn\u2019t pass it up. I called Carolyn and she was ecstatic. Her roommate agreed to get lost for a few days, and I got booked on a transport headed for Macon Friday afternoon.\nIt turned out strange. Of course, there was no place to jack in Macon, and we were back to basics. We had the unspoken assumption that that would be enough, but in fact, it wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t impotent, exactly, and she wasn\u2019t unreceptive, exactly. But early Saturday morning we took a bus to Atlanta and got a cheap room a couple of blocks from the jack joints outside Fort McPherson.\nThe Stars and Stripes Forever was the cheapest place, no frills, which was fine with both of us. Sunday morning, though, we counted our pennies and splurged on Private Space, which gave the illusion of zero gravity, surrounded by whirling galaxies, and that was extraordinary.\nWe did talk a little bit about it. It was unsettling, but we agreed it was in large measure the fact that jacking was still new to us. We parted very much in love, but a little shaken by the contrast between the normal and enhanced states.\nMaking love in her apartment, we\u2019d both been fantasizing like mad about the previous week.\nIn a couple of weeks, we were on our first independent combat mission.\nBravo platoon was H&I, a Harassment and Interdiction unit. So our main job was to go in there and screw things up for the enemy. Confusion rather than killing.\nIn this case, our assignment was a little focused chaos. The Ngumi had put together a command center in a remote valley in Costa Rica, laboriously carrying in equipment and munitions by night, by hand. No heat signature visible from above the tree canopy. They didn\u2019t know yet that we had seeded the entire countryside with microscopic olfactory devices whose simple job was to ping their location when a sweating human walked by. So we knew exactly where the enemy was and what trails they had taken.\nWe stayed off those trails. If you\u2019re careful and slow, you can move the heavy soldierboy through pretty thick brush without a sound. I guided the ten of us up both sides of the main trail, averaging about one mile per hour. Twice, their patrols tip-toed right through our platoon without noticing us, our suits set on camo in the dark.\nArlie got to their perimeter first. She stood quietly a few yards away from a dozing sentry while the rest of us encircled the camp. I was poised to start the attack instantly, if one of us was detected, but we all got into place without a hitch.\nI was nominally in charge, but all ten of us were essentially wired in parallel. At my thought, we all attacked at once.\nNo weapons at first but light and sound: ten lights much brighter than the sun; ten deafening speakers shrieking a dissonant chord. Then a billow of gas from ten directions.\nThey were out of their tents firing wildly, but almost all took one breath of KO gas and fell unconscious. Two had been able to don gas masks. Mel took one and I took the other. Knocked away his rifle and tapped him on the chest, which flung him to the ground. I pulled off his gas mask and tossed it away, and moved with the others to the central objective, a tetrahedral mini-fort of some bulletproof plastic. They\u2019d evidently brought it up piecemeal and glued it together.\nOur forces had encountered them in the African desert (invisible to radar and tough on flyboys), but this was the first one we knew of in Costa Rica. They fired 155-mm. explosive armor-piercing shells, which could disable a soldierboy, but the barrel was external. It spun around fast, but we could anticipate it and duck. They were firing dumb shells, fortunately.\nWe could just keep ducking and dodging until he ran out of ammunition, but he was firing all over the place, and liable to kill some of his own people, or civilian mules. So Carolyn and I fried two corners of the thing with lasers, re-aiming several times a second as we evaded its fire, which finally heated up the inside and filled it with burning-plastic fumes. A door popped open and two people spilled out, coughing. We KO\u2019ed them, too, and then gathered up all the sleeping bodies and stacked them. Then we lasered a clearing out of the forest to use as a landing zone, and called for a chopper to come get them.\nFrom turning on the lights to loading the \u201ccaptives\u201d aboard the chopper, it was about twelve minutes. No casualties.\nMel was not able to hide his resentment at that. Thanks . . . we\u2019re still virgins. He apologized, but it hung in the air.\nI would have called it a textbook-perfect operation, but while we were waiting for pick-up, we got the word from the officers\u2019 review board, which had been hooked up with us for evaluation. Three out of the seven thought we should have destroyed the mini-fort and its two occupants immediately, before they could harm a soldierboy or bystanders.\nOkay, I thought, you come down and kill them. While the soldierboys were on the chopper back, and we were unjacked in the relative privacy of the situation room, we chewed that over. Seven of the platoon agreed with me, predictably; all but Mel and Sara. The disagreement was mild, though; they said they would have done it differently, but it was my call. They didn\u2019t think much of the long-distance quarterbacking.\nOf course, the officers had really been no farther from the action than we were.\nThey gave us Sunday afternoon off, and I managed to get an advance in pay (borrowing against it, actually; paying the government ten percent interest) so we could go downtown and jack.\nIt was called the Hotel de Dream. An uninhabited desert island this time, and I paid ahead for thirty minutes, so after we made love in the low morning sun, we swam in the warm water for a few minutes, and then sat and held each other while the gentle surf rolled over us. It was jarring when the time ran out suddenly and we were in that hard plain bed, hardly even touching.\nNo money for a hotel room. We had hot dogs for dinner and a couple of beers, and then walked back to the base and our separate beds.\nBlaze was amused but shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re in for four years, ten days at a time?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I see what you mean.\u201d We were alone at the coffee place, mid-morning.\n\u201cBy the time you get out, you\u2019ll owe the army a million dollars. At ten percent interest.\u201d I could just shrug, and I guess smile sheepishly.\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s like addictive behavior. If the army had gotten you hooked on DD\u2019s, we\u2019d be down there with a brace of lawyers, getting you pulled from service and into detox. But they\u2019ve got you hooked on love!\u201d\n\u201cCome on . . . \u201d\n\u201cTry to be objective about it. I know Carolyn\u2019s a nice girl and so forth\u2014\n\u201cWatch out, Blaze.\u201d\n\u201cListen to me for just one minute, okay?\u201d She took out her notebook and clicked a couple of times. \u201cDo you know what your brain chemistry looks like when you go down to that Motel de Dream?\u201d\n\u201cHotel. Pretty strange, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cNot strange at all. It\u2019s a seething stew of oxytocin, serotonin, and endogenous opioids. Your vasopressin receptors are wide open. You would be totally juiced even if Carolyn was a gerbil!\u201d\nI could feel myself almost grinning. \u201cNice job of objectifying it. But if you haven\u2019t been there, you just don\u2019t know. It really is love.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. So do me a favor. Do it with one of the other women. Watch yourself fall in love with her.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Just the thought was disgusting. \u201cBlaze, that\u2019s awful. It\u2019s like I was a lovesick teenager, and Dad gives me a wad of money to go to a whorehouse and get it out of my system.\u201d\n\u201cNothing like that. I just want you to engage your critical side, your objectivity.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. That always works with love.\u201d\nWe didn\u2019t talk about that any more that month\u2014or much else. I went to the airport alone.\nCarolyn and I had one embrace, and then off to the cages.\nIt was a routine show of force. The governor-general of Panama, our well-loved puppet, was giving a speech in Panama City, and we were there to stand at attention and look ominous. Which we did, I had to admit, nine of the soldierboys set to \u201ccamouflage\u201d in the bright sun. That didn\u2019t hide them; it made them glittering, shifting statues you couldn\u2019t quite focus on. Scary. My own soldierboy, platoon leader, was shiny black.\nOur presence wasn\u2019t really needed, except for the press. The crowd was hand-selected, and applauded and cheered on cue, no doubt eager to have it over with and get back into the air conditioning. It was in the high nineties and steamy still.\nDo you feel warm? Carolyn asked without words. I thought back that it was psychosomatic, sympathy for those poor proles outside, and she agreed.\nThen the speech was over, and we got together in a line for our dramatic exit. It was a routine extraction, but it was a good demonstration of our inhuman strength: we stood shoulder-to-shoulder with our left hands raised, and a cargo helicopter with a retrieval bar came swooping in, churning along below treetop-level at more than a hundred miles per hour, and snatched us away. It would have torn off a human\u2019s arm, but we hardly felt it.\nCarolyn\u2019s output suddenly went black, apparently unplugged by the mechanical shock. \u201cCarolyn?\u201d I said over the emergency vocal circuit.\nWhen she didn\u2019t respond, I asked permission to disengage. There was no reason for us to stay in the soldierboys, other than the convenience of walking them to storage after we landed. My request wasn\u2019t answered by Command. They were probably off fighting a war someplace, I figured.\nSo we landed by the service bay and walked our machines in. Carolyn\u2019s wasn\u2019t under her control, obviously; the soldierboy normally mimicked her natural physical grace. This time it staggered like a cartoon robot, some tech moving it with a joystick.\nI popped our cages and we were suddenly in the real world, naked and sweaty, joints popping as we stretched.\nCarolyn\u2019s cage was open but she wasn\u2019t there.\nOne person in the room was dressed, a medical officer. She walked over. \u201cPrivate Collins had a massive cerebrovascular failure, just prior to extraction. She\u2019s in surgery now.\u201d\nI felt the blood chase away from my face and arms. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sergeant. They\u2019re trying, but I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s . . . well, she\u2019s clinically dead.\u201d\nI sat down on the edge of the cage base, hard concrete, my head spinning. \u201cHow is that different from plain dead?\u201d\n\u201cShe has no higher brain function. We are contacting her next of kin. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . I\u2014I was in her brain just minutes ago.\u201d\nShe looked at her clipboard. \u201cTime of death was 13:47. Twenty-five minutes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not enough time. They bring people back.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying, sergeant. Mechanics are too valuable to throw away. That\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d She turned to go.\n\u201cWait! Can I see her?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where she is, sergeant. Sorry.\u201d\nThe others had gathered around me. I was surprised I wasn\u2019t crying, or even trying not to cry. I felt gut-punched, helpless.\n\u201cShe\u2019s gotta be at the base hospital,\u201d Mel said. \u201cLet\u2019s go find her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do what?\u201d Candi said. \u201cGet in the way?\u201d She sat down next to me and put an arm around my shoulders. \u201cWe should go into the lounge and wait.\u201d\nWe did, me walking like a zombie. Like a soldierboy without a mechanic. Lou got a credit card from his locker and bought us all beers from the machine. We dressed and drank in awkward silence.\nAkeem didn\u2019t drink. \u201cSometimes one wishes one could pray.\u201d Samantha looked up from her meditation, and nodded. The rest of us just drank and watched the door.\nI got up to buy a round and the medical officer came back. I took one look at her eyes and collapsed.\nI woke up suddenly in a hospital bed, like a noiseless splash of ice water. A nurse stepped away with a hypodermic, and behind her was Blaze.\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\n\u201cFive in the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cWednesday. I came as soon as I heard, and they said they were about to wake you up anyway.\u201d She picked up a plastic cup and held the straw toward me. \u201cWater?\u201d\nI shook my head no. \u201cWhat, I just passed out? Twelve hours ago?\u201d\n\u201cAnd they gave you something, to help you sleep. It\u2019s what they do, when someone has a loss like yours.\u201d\nIt all came back and hit me like a car. \u201cCarolyn.\u201d She took my hand in both of hers and I jerked it away. Then I sat partway up and took her hand back.\nI closed my eyes and I was floating, falling. Maybe the drug. I swallowed, and couldn\u2019t find my voice.\n\u201cThey said you\u2019re on compassionate leave for the rest of the month. Come home with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about my people? My platoon?\u201d\n\u201cMost of them are waiting in the hall. They let me come in first.\u201d\nI sat up and held her, she held me, until I was ready to see my mates. They came in as a group, and Blaze waited outside in the hall while we made a wheel, each right arm a spoke. Mel and Candi and Samantha whispered a few words, but it was more the silent communion than any specific sentiment, that gave me a place to be. A place where I could breathe for awhile.\nBlaze took me home with her, and after some long time, I was her lover rather than the friend who needed a strong arm, a soft breast. Later on, we laughed because neither of us could remember the exact night, or afternoon or morning, when it became sex. But I think I know when it became love.\nThe army counselor I\u2019d been going to said I should see my loss as a wound, which had to be protected by stitches, which is to say a set of responses that could protect me while it healed. Stitches that would fall away when they were no longer needed.\nBut Blaze, a doctor of physics rather than of medicine, said he didn\u2019t understand. There are wounds too large to close with stitches. You have to leave them open, and protect them, while keloid tissue grows over them. Keloid tissue doesn\u2019t have normal nerve endings. It keeps you alive, but numb.\nThat\u2019s where I am, years later. For ten days each month, I lock myself into the cage that gives me superhuman power. The rest of the time, I have her calm and sweet acceptance of the loss that will always be my center.\nThe soft cage of arms and legs that protects me, and gives me a measure of amnesia.\nOriginally published in Warriors, edited by Gardner Dozois and George R. R. Martin.\nBorn in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Joe Haldeman took a B.S. degree in physics and astronomy from the University of Maryland, and did postgraduate work in mathematics and computer science. But his plans for a career in science were cut short by the U.S. Army, which sent him to Vietnam in 1968 as a combat engineer. Seriously wounded in action, Haldeman returned home in 1969 and began to write. By 1976, he had garnered both the Nebula Award and the Hugo Award for his famous novel The Forever War, one of the landmark books of the '70s. He has since won four more Hugo Awards, another four Nebula Awards, the James Tiptree, Jr. Award for his novel Camouflage, the SFWA Grandmaster Award, and has been inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. His other books include a mainstream novel, War Year, the SF novels Mindbridge, All My Sins Remembered, Worlds, Worlds Apart, Worlds Enough and Time, Buying Time, The Hemingway Hoax, Tools of the Trade, The Coming, 1969, Old Twentieth, The Accidental Time-Machine, Marsbound, and Starbound. His short work has been gathered in the collections Infinite Dreams, Dealing in Futures, Vietnam and Other Alien Worlds, None So Blind, A Separate War and Other Stories, and an omnibus of fiction and non-fiction, War Stories. His most recent books are a new science fiction novel, Earthbound, and a big retrospective collection, The Best of Joe Haldeman. Haldeman lives part of the year in Boston, where he teaches writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the rest of the year in Florida, where he and his wife, Gay, make their home."}

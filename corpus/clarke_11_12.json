My \u201cupgrade\u201d won\u2019t be anything cool like a bionic eye or cranial jack and it won\u2019t be as painful as becoming a Cyberman. I never expected to become a cyborg at forty-six, but thanks to my July heart attack, my heart has sustained enough damage to require the installation of a defibrillator in my chest. As far as mods go, it\u2019s pretty mundane, but it will provide some peace of mind and may even save my life someday.\nNow that I\u2019m taking the first step, maybe I should start considering other potential upgrades. Given my health over the last year, a nanobot-based immune and healing system would be particularly useful. I wouldn\u2019t complain about a system that would allow me to learn new skills or languages via software updates. The old cyborg staples of strength and speed wouldn\u2019t be high on my priority list, but are certainly worth considering. Still, the fictional cyborgs we read about often pay a high price for their improvements. Would I really want to be part of the collective, lose my emotions or memories, or become beholden to some secret government organization? What if your new parts can be taken over or subverted? The what-ifs make for a good story. (And now, I brace myself for the flood of cyborg stories.)\nNovember is when many of us celebrate Thanksgiving. I have a significant list of reasons to be thankful this year. Obviously, surviving a major heart attack is up there, but I also have to appreciate the good fortune to be surrounded by good people, access to excellent medical care and the opportunity to become a cyborg. While my story has contained its fair share of bad things, I\u2019m still here, and as Elizabeth Bear pointed out in her column a few months ago, good stories don\u2019t have to be dark. I join the cyborg nation happy to have the opportunity to live. Whirr. Beep.\nCyborgification isn\u2019t the only change this month at Clarkesworld. I am pleased to announce that Kate Baker has agreed to add Non-Fiction Editor to her list of responsibilities. Kate has been our Podcast Director for over three years (a job she intends to continue) and I look forward to having the opportunity to work with her on this aspect of the magazine. We\u2019re carpooling to World Fantasy Convention this month, so we should have plenty to talk about on the long drive.\nIf you\u2019ll be at World Fantasy, please stop by and say hi to Sean, Kate and I. We love to hear from our readers and authors. I\u2019m also pleased to say that the Clarkesworld single issue chapbooks I mentioned last month will be available at the Prime Books table. I was able to get the January-October 2012 issues completed in time, so we\u2019ll have a limited quantity of each available there.\nFinally, I\u2019d like to welcome our new subscribers. We appreciate your support and hope you\u2019ll consider encouraging friends to do the same. It\u2019s been encouraging to see those numbers go up a bit each month and provide the financial stability we need to grow this magazine. Welcome.

The colossal plasticine walls shoot up before me and I shield my eyes from the rays of sun poking through the microlattice ceiling net. I count ten visitors already today, and the natural rink has only been open an hour. A skater passes by me, his bioenhanced skates emitting \u201cPew! Pew!\u201d and he pivots, grinding toward a stop as he bends to fix the tack compressions on his ankles, pressing them down to adhere better. Something flops out of his pocket as he races away into a flip.\nI glide across, kneeling to grab a foreign object on the ice. It\u2019s a trapezoidal palm-sized card, glowing neon, with a series of swirls embedded. It\u2019s one of those new-fangled key fobs, the glow indicating that the vehicle\u2019s not too far away. I\u2019m surprised to see one here; I keep hearing how the rocks don\u2019t cooperate with the navigation and wheels. I turn to the skater, who\u2019s now doing some stretches against the railing.\n\u201cHey, did you drop this?\u201d My comm projects my voice into his receiver. He gives me a look of slight alarm, his pupils contracted, whites wide at the sight of my security badge, no doubt, and at the cascade of languages my holotranslator is projecting above my head\u2014a look I catch through the slick designer glass on his helmet.\nHis eyes look almost like my lost son\u2019s and they give me a start. I catch my breath and exhale. It\u2019s been a while since I had that kind of reaction; I thought the wound was healing. The boy shakes his head, No, I didn\u2019t drop it, but comes barreling at me with his brand name suit, an intent look, and furrowed brows.\nErratic behavior, I think, and my training kicks in before I can even register my movement. I shift aside, knees bent, waiting for that blow so I can launch him away. But last minute, like paper in a gust, he plucks the key from my hands and veers away, the \u201cPew! Pew!\u201d whining of the ice tracking behind him in his wake. He glides away with his obnoxious mellx-leather gloves glued into a thumbs-up sign as his last bit of communication to me.\nStrange characters decide to live out in these lands, I tell myself for probably the tenth time since I moved here. It\u2019s only been about a few months and already I\u2019ve gotten shoved half a dozen different ways, leered at, poked, stepped on.\nIn turn, residents have gotten their fair share of retribution from me\u2014jabs, elbows, \u201cinadvertent\u201d contact, and of course icy smiles. I\u2019m told that\u2019s how it is here on this auburn rock. People don\u2019t get too chummy and I fell into place right along with them.\nIt\u2019s just not typical that they have the same features and expression as Haolai\u2019s.\nThe last time I got too chummy and complacent, Haolai disappeared. Right before my eyes. Masked men. That was on the solar outreaches, before I took the job here. I hunted for ages, gave up. They sent his body later. There are wounds that never scab over. This one grows a thin layer of platelets and fibrin before being yanked off by some resonant memory. The look in that boy\u2019s eyes just now\u2014that fear, that\u2019s that scab being ripped off. That\u2019s the hollow feeling in my stomach as I taste vomit and hide the ache pounding in my chest. I swallow up bitterness and pain in one black hole of gulp and continue scanning the ice as more visitors clamber onto the rink, holding hands, laughing through their helmets, and slipping about like holotoons.\nI\u2019m on exit duty as session ends. Trumpets blare as if a cue for that awful music that the bazaar vendors play when they\u2019re closing shop. Exhausted skaters, barely lifting puffy suit-encased arms, do their last lap. My partner-in-security Dran herds the stragglers to my vestibule\u2014\u201cHere, Yunhe, take care of \u2019em\u201d\u2014where they\u2019ll get suctioned off of any remaining ice and water.\nI yank the lever at every entrance, letting the vestibule\u2019s ceiling emit high-power vacs that suck up every bit of excess moisture on these visitors\u2019 bods. Then I scan their passes, projected onto their shoulders, to verify that they\u2019ve left. The scan inputs a ten percent discount into their systems for the next time they visit. It also implants an ad that they\u2019ll pass on to any other resident with any contact. Even public parks need some viral advertising. One of the visitors gives me some trouble\u2014a woman who insists she already went through the watertug and refuses to go through it again.\nI grab Dran and we check her, scanning her as she shakes red curls within her helmet and curses about civil liberties. The scan beeps as irregularities flow from this woman\u2019s sides. \u201cHoney, scanning is not a violation, not here at least,\u201d Dran\u2019s saying as she tries skating away. The words appear above Dran\u2019s head, as they do with all security, and the word \u201cHoney\u201d written in gold script makes me smirk. They tried putting personalities to the words with fonts to convey emotions and it always comes off a bit awry. She pulls loose from Dran and in bullet speed veers left and away toward the other side of the rink. She\u2019s almost across the ice when I race over and grab her again, dragging her back to the checkpoint\u2014sure enough, another scan proves she\u2019s got pocketfuls of ice kept in the tiny refrigeration chambers. She\u2019s got at least a dozen of them.\n\u201cNo mood-ice rings for your customers.\u201d My voice is gruff, unsympathetic.\nShe thrashes. Only then do I see the tiny pocketknife. I pull back as a flash of pain registers on my arm. There\u2019s a cut in my suit, and I bark at Dran as I\u2019m seeing the red ooze from my skin. Dran races over and holds her down as I spray the remi-glu over my skin and suit. Such a strong smell, with an effect just as potent. The redhead\u2019s eyes are big and round and as bloodshot as her hair. She looks as frightened as newcomers when they land here.\n\u201cPretty lucky,\u201d says Dran. He\u2019s got her arms pinned down in his steel grip and I release the weapon and kick it away from her hand. She squeezes her fist and opens it, as if surprised she had used it at all. The knife goes flying across the ice, as innocuous as rock. I empty her stash out into the retrieval bin.\nShe grimaces, mumbles a sorry as Dran locks her arms behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s a plant. Someone planted them on me. I\u2019ve never seen those marble things before.\u201d Her look of rabid regret gives her away. She\u2019s desperate. I know how much they\u2019d fetch on the market. Once the ice is carved into jewelry and set in climate-controlled shreela bezelcages, they\u2019ll be more valuable than the purest diamond, even more coveted for courtship rituals, big events, playthings of magnates and celebs\u2014put on a ship and transported away. Even the hardware for the fridge tech is a small fortune. I wonder how much trouble she\u2019ll get in for losing those in addition to the ice. I try to feel sorry for her, but there\u2019s nothing in me left. I\u2019m wrung dry.\nShe assaulted me and my sympathy only goes so far.\nEven through the disturbance, my mind is still laser focused. I\u2019ve been waiting for Haolai-look-alike to come around and make the exit, but I didn\u2019t see him at all. He must have left at some point, hiding behind his darkened helmet. There\u2019s an empty pit in my heart as I palm the suck for seized goods. The fridge tech marbleminis tumble about until they\u2019re wrung dry and I palm a few of the dozen or so that have just been purified.\nThe cut is barely throbbing, healing proper thanks to the spray. I shake my arm. The cut\u2019s pretty superficial but it could\u2019ve been bad.\nShe gives me a look of distress and I kick myself for being so soft. She looks so slippin\u2019 desperate. I can\u2019t help her much at all, really, not without losing my own job.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it again,\u201d I say, shoving her as I slip a few empty marbleminis down her pocket. At least she could sell those and get something out of it. Maybe enough to buy herself out of the trouble she\u2019s in with whoever hired her, at least enough to try to escape. Dran\u2019s watching me, saying nothing. He\u2019d keep his mouth shut.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you risk termination.\u201d Dran passes through the vestibule, clean going in, clean going out, as he punches out with a beep.\nI shoot him a nonchalant look, like I don\u2019t know what ya mean, with a shrug.\nIt\u2019s clear he knows. He can count and he has fast eyes. He holds up his fingers. Four.\nThe number of fridge tech marbleminis I slipped down her pocket.\nWhat can I say? I know desperation. I smell it. It stinks like remi-glu. I pity her and am disgusted by her all at once. It\u2019s a way to placate that smell. At least that\u2019s what I tell myself.\nI walk through the vestibule. Even security\u2019s got to run through the protocol. I don\u2019t shiver, even though my neck is on the line. I\u2019ve got a dozen new mocks of marbles, all filled with ice myself, and I\u2019m hoping that the new contraband tech sticks. I\u2019ve got about an hour before the upgraded patch goes through security, so if everything\u2019s timed right . . .\nI hold my breath.\nGreen. I\u2019m good. I pass right through, embezzling what I\u2019m supposed to protect.\nThe ice here isn\u2019t like ice anywhere else. It doesn\u2019t simply cave and let you carve it up. It resists. It has its own weird autonomy. Sometimes it relaxes itself into a super slippery state with an iridescent tinge and you can\u2019t help but slide backward into a slapstick butt plant. Sometimes it draws itself into tiny ridges, like an infinitesimal mountain range, which guides your skates into grooves and toward one direction or another. Scientists have come to this near-barren planet with kits and pop-up labs, coming up with hypotheses that ultimately get disproven. From the local lore, the ice is supposed to have both medicinal properties and be a source of bad luck\u2014causing breakups, miscarriages, gambling downturns, and other misfortunes. That\u2019s why they pay me top dollar to pose as a security guard here. Superstition has driven up my salary. Though, there\u2019s something else going on and my other paycheck is the one that covers the objective of figuring out what it is.\nI steal back in on the day it\u2019s closed. All my leads on the uniqueness of the ice have led me nowhere. I\u2019ve only entrusted the ice to the underground scientists that swing by the bazaar who I have personally worked with and whose families I\u2019ve met\u2014with enough integrity to not double-cross me and with just enough unscrupulousness to wave away small infractions. I ferry the ice specimens back after they do the tests, purifying them again for reentry. I don\u2019t know who the big boss is. All I know is that it\u2019s for science. That\u2019s enough for me.\nI see a streak on the ice and for a moment, I stay still. I realize it\u2019s just a stray reflection of a faraway light, a trick of the eye. It reminds me of Haolai\u2019s farewell holo\u2014the one of his stillness being ejected into the distance. I need to earn to pay off my son\u2019s funeral still. The costs are staggering. Shooting a kid into space as his final wish is more expensive than a colony wedding. I didn\u2019t want his face haunting me, his eyes imploring, accusing, for not giving him his dying wish. So, there it is. His frozen body is out there somewhere\u2014if the projections are right\u2014orbiting around the sun near the Sunaba belt. I make it past the streak, no longer spooked by it.\nMy suit is armed with camouflaging and mule-ferrying tech more than ten times my own value. Usually only the most exquisite drugs line these pockets. Although in my case, it\u2019s operatic ice encased in swank marbles. I\u2019m banking on a big discovery, one that will get me paid so much cred it\u2019ll be a joke.\nSteal only when everyone\u2019s watching, but while no one\u2019s actually looking. I\u2019m breaking that word of advice now by coming here in the dark. This is when bot security is the highest\u2014when the world is still and there is no distraction and no cover. Yet, I can\u2019t help it. It was too hard to meet my quota during the day. I get low and creep around the periphery of the frozen crater lake, finding the spots least likely to sing. I turn off my mind from the job and let my body take over. It knows the spots of variation on the ice. I\u2019ve passed by so many times in the last two weeks, taking intel, processing through my limbs and into the depths of my suit. I crawl along, finding a less traversed area of the amoebic borders of the lake rink, and careful as I can, crack the pricey minicoolers over and massage the ice back into place.\nI can feel the strange coolness even through my gloves. It reminds me of when I used to massage shampoo into Haolai\u2019s hair, when he was a little boy. He\u2019d smile at me an innocent smile\u2014all baby teeth and pure enthusiasm as he popped suds. And now\u2014that look of fear. Even more potent than the sorry-Mom-I\u2019ve-done-something-wrong expression. Except, well, it\u2019s not him. I\u2019ve searched everywhere for the Haolai-look-alike and it has gotten me nowhere. Not at the bazaar. Not at the shanties. I can still see his expression of surprise then despair. I know it\u2019s not Haolai, but still, I want to find the boy. This doppelg\u00e4nger\u2019s anomalous appearance and disappearance has gotten me agitated and the only way to clear my head is to put myself on a mission. Too bad it\u2019s occupational suicide.\nI\u2019m just taking a stroll, clearing my head, I tell myself, as I\u2019m on all fours, trying to float across the ice, hoping my negation tech will hold up. They want samples from all areas of the ice\u2014I\u2019d have to traverse to the far edge. Luckily, the ice is cooperating; not melting at the surface, not forming ripples.\nA light approaches, flicks on in the distance, and I gasp lightly. It bobs along the strange changing color of the ice. It\u2019s not the streak from before\u2014this is a lot more\u2014moving. More than what I\u2019ve seen ice do. Sounds follow it. Some of the ethereal sounds when skates glide over it. And something else. Something more . . . human. Mumbling. My heart thumps as it approaches.\nBe as small as possible. They won\u2019t see you.\n\u201cYunhe, is that you?\u201d The familiar voice cuts into my harried breaths. It\u2019s Dran.\nI start. Should I respond or try escaping? I consider how I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to tackle a trespasser and I\u2019m sure Dran wouldn\u2019t either. He\u2019s faster than I am. I look up at him through my helmet. \u201cYeah, hi,\u201d I say, the holotranslator off.\n\u201cFunny I\u2019d find you here. I\u2019m guessing you couldn\u2019t sleep, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here, though. I put a temporary stop on the watchers when I saw it was you. Overrode it with my code.\u201d He gives me a funny expression, a kind of half-squint, before reaching out to help me up.\nI shake off shreds of ice. \u201cYeah, well, couldn\u2019t sleep and thought I\u2019d do some reconnaissance.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a nice quiet spot to do some thinking,\u201d he says. Now I see him looking me up and down, standard procedure for checking pockets, visually locating any suspicious items. \u201cYou know, Yunhe, I don\u2019t have you pegged as someone who would be involved in anything too . . . risky.\u201d He waits for me to say something. I just look at him. He continues. \u201cI was in fact hoping to meet you here. I found some strange materials I wanted you to review. About a corp\u2014\u201d\nHe gags then, and I hear a sudden burst almost a bit too late, as if my mind has suddenly realized it heard it. A chill travels up my spine as I see what has happened. An arrow has pierced his collarbone. I reach out for him as he falls, face forward, and I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll crack his skull. He crumbles in the arms I hold out. It\u2019s a harpoon. I follow the harpoon\u2019s trajectory. It came from the west, where the sun had set hours ago, and the thing\u2019s now pulling him, dragging him along a thin line, like a harpoon that had caught a whale. There\u2019s a blood trail lining the ice and it\u2019s darker than dark.\nThere\u2019s no way this can happen. The grid keeps all the flying things out. How . . . ?\nI don\u2019t try to tug too hard to keep him back. I don\u2019t want him to split open after all. I frantically look for something that I can use to saw\u2014I pop out the blade of one of my skates, and it flies up for a moment like an ejected meal bar from the grill-popper. I run after the rope and saw a few pulls, but the rope\u2019s much too strong and goes taut just as I descend on it.\nA roaring comes from something unseen. I can\u2019t cover my ears since I\u2019m working on the rope.\nI tug on the rope, trying to hold back the pull. I grunt. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s like fighting an extremely aggressive Lonsar bull or some other Center monster. Dran groans this insidious sound, something that\u2019s both squeaky and deep at once, like a child stuck in a well, the voice reflecting off surrounding bricks. It reminds me of those old legends my mom used to tell me about the Center\u2014wells, waterways, and dangers. I\u2019m sawing and sawing and the rope won\u2019t come off. Meanwhile, I\u2019m being dragged alongside him with the harpoon still stuck at his collarbone, and there\u2019s blood. I give up and run after him, spraying him with remi-glu. I tear off loose fabric using my skate and try to bandage him. Sweat trails down my back in my suit and I\u2019m hyper-focused but also hyper-anxious, wondering who the hell was pulling my partner like he was a fine supper catch.\nI hear a whoosh in the air\u2014above the constant roaring of what sounds like a shielded atmocopter\u2014and for a moment I think I smell burning metal. Another harpoon comes and hits the ice, just grazing my suited arm. I curse, shout, and try pulling it off. I can feel the heat of it even through my thermagloves. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse, the harpoon in Dran or the harpoon in the ice. What to tackle first? I\u2019m starting to panic, overthink.\nMaybe Dran would be the easy choice, but now there\u2019s going to be a huge crack in this lake that\u2019ll be tough to fix. It\u2019s not just a small sample. It\u2019s a major rip. Besides, there\u2019s a whole protocol for samples that even I follow in my covert jobs. You can\u2019t just storm away with some of the specimens. Scientists even have to go through a rigorous check before harvesting any ice.\nI breathe deep. I decide on Dran.\nI remember that I had stashed away the redhead smuggler\u2019s blade the other day and dig into my pocket. There it is. It\u2019s small, but slickin\u2019 sharp, and for a moment my arm aches in a phantom memory of the swift cut. It makes a grinding sound as I stick it through the unforgiving rope, and it cuts neat. Dran\u2019s groaning, with the harpoon still lodged in him, and I spray half his body with remi-glu until he\u2019s stuck onto the slick ice like prey for a giant Center spider. Smells as bad as one, too.\nI shake the can. Half empty. Getting the remi-glu to stick to the ice isn\u2019t an easy task. This ice is as elusive texture-wise as it is color-wise in its iridescent gleam.\nThe other harpoon is now scraping the ice, trying to break off a large chunk of it. It really needs to do more damage than that. I wonder how many of these harpoons are out there as I reattach my ice skating blades and glide over. I use the knife to cut, but the harpoon releases before I can get a full cut. Good. At least it hasn\u2019t taken a block of ice with it.\nIt\u2019s coming back again in full velocity. Straight at me. Oh crap.\nI detach the removable ice skate blade, place the knife on it, quickly spray remi-glu, and chuck it toward the rope with a heft I learned from Center sports. The blade makes a grand curve like a boomerang and it slices through the rope. I duck as the loose harpoon flies past me and sticks in the ice. A bit of rope dangles from it, no longer tied to the ship. The makeshift boomerang strikes the ice with a soft pang near it.\nThere is a sound of fading, of that roaring moving away, and I see a streak in the distance that I assume is the camouflaged atmocopter ship zooming off. They usually don\u2019t last long since they require so much power to operate.\nI grab the knife, covertly gather some ice crystals dislodged by the harpoon, and shovel them into my high-tech storage capsules away from Dran\u2019s vantage point. Besides, he\u2019s still groaning, lying still on the surface about ten meters away. The ice around the harpoon is acting strange, stranger than usual, not simply iridescent but undulating ever so slightly in a sapphire tinge.\nI try to remove the harpoon and I imagine it to be hefty\u2014yet, in one swoop, it dislodges. It\u2019s surprisingly light. I hear a loud moan from Dran again and I throw the harpoon over my shoulder, holding it by the hanging bit of rope, careful it doesn\u2019t cut me. I go over to Dran and cut him off the ice, which is starting to shimmer under his weight. There\u2019s something going on there, too. I spray him with more remi-glu for good measure, until he looks like he\u2019s sporting a giant puffball at his shoulder, and drag both him and the harpoon. There\u2019s a trembling in my feet as I skate with one foot, the other skate blade still pressed up against my waist in my utility belt. It\u2019s like skateboarding, but it\u2019s wobbly. The ice behind me is shimmering, almost shivering\u2014there is something very fluid about the solid tonight.\nI pull him to the side and call over an off-network vehicle. I keep a lookout for any disturbances in the sky, any strange roaring sounds that might be a refueled atmocopter returning.\nNothing.\nDran sleeps like a log on my futon in main room. Coffee wafts in from the kitchen as I\u2019m staring at the harpoon, parked against the table, its sharp tooth digging into my rug.\nI don\u2019t disturb his wound\u2014the remi-glu has taken care of the antiseptic and all. Dran still looks a little pale, his usually tough jaw looking gaunt, overshadowed, and ragged, and like he needs some food. I have a lot of questions for him and\u2014\n\u201cWhat\u2014what\u2014where am I?\u201d He rolls off the futon and I kick the harpoon aside before he knocks it over and impales himself with it.\n\u201cSo, you let them in,\u201d I say, holding up the harpoon. There\u2019s an insignia of a phoenix with a spiral tail ending in a wispy flame.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t let them in,\u201d he groans. His eyes flicker and he registers me and his surroundings. It\u2019s pretty empty and run down\u2014the last tenant tore up the floors and walls. \u201cNice apartment,\u201d he says in a tease before lapsing into a hoarse cough. \u201cAh, my headache.\u201d\nI don\u2019t feel too good myself. My cut still throbs, and my mind had wandered, reeling, while watching over Dran. I suspect the point of that harpoon was dipped in something hallucinogenic.\nI push over a bowl of oatmeal and Dran sits up. He gives it a look, grimaces, says a thanks, and takes the longest time I\u2019ve ever seen someone take to put a spoon into their mouth.\n\u201cThey blackmailed me,\u201d he says, chewing. \u201cThen tried to kill me when they realized I targeted the security systems for the energy drain. Probably would\u2019ve killed me.\u201d\n\u201cBlackmailed?\u201d\n\u201cSaid they had my daughter down in Center. It was a lie, but I didn\u2019t know it at the time. They had pretty convincing voice clips. I couldn\u2019t risk it.\u201d He flips up his wrist-hatch, lips moving as he reads. \u201cShe\u2019s alarmed, but fine.\u201d\n\u201cDNA-verified comms message?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course, verified as a communication from her.\u201d\n\u201cWhich mob is this?\u201d I ask, pointing at the phoenix. Its beak is razor sharp, much like the harpoon itself.\n\u201cBurnaways. They just provided some private info on my daughter and told me to let them in if I wanted to see her safe. They weren\u2019t supposed to notice the energy drain of their atmocopter at the lake until it was too late. Something must have tipped them off to do a check.\u201d\nI scan the logo and run a classified search. It wouldn\u2019t blip up on the system, but I\u2019d get my results.\nI look up. Dran looks expectant, waiting for me to say something. I keep silent, letting the scan run. Lots of similar logos in the systems sphere.\n\u201cYou,\u201d he says. \u201cYour presence tipped them off that something wasn\u2019t right. I certainly didn\u2019t plan that. How did you know?\u201d\n\u201cI was looking for something. There was something about the smuggler that bothered me,\u201d I say, my response prepared. \u201cHow did she get in there with that tech anyway?\u201d\n\u201cYou know the scan in isn\u2019t as robust as the scan out. It happens.\u201d\n\u201cSomething just seems off.\u201d Haolai. The redheaded smuggler. There\u2019s something I\u2019m missing.\nI look at Dran long and hard. The phoenix logo scan beeps with results. It shows some matching industries and faces, including one that looks uncannily like Dran\u2019s.\nI pick up the harpoon and point it at him.\n\u201cI knew there was something off. I didn\u2019t see Haolai leave the rink the other day.\u201d\n\u201cHaolai?\u201d\n\u201cMy son.\u201d\n\u201cOh, right. The dead one. You\u2019ve mentioned him. Why would he be on the rink?\u201d\n\u201cHis face was. So, you know about my son. Then, you really are Dran.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I am. Stop being ridiculous.\u201d He puts his hand on the table and tries pulling himself up, but releases with a thud, clutching his shoulder, his face scrunched in pain.\n\u201cWhen you grimace, the paste lines are there.\u201d\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\u201cThe paste lines. The brand-new face ripping tech. I get it. I didn\u2019t think it had already been perfected. I didn\u2019t think we had the equipment. I can see it now. You\u2019re not Dran. And that wasn\u2019t Haolai.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Yunhe, I think you\u2019ve had too long of a day.\u201d\nI pick up the harpoon and put it right up to his face. He shirks back. Too late\u2014for a moment, the skin lifts up.\n\u201cWho are you under there?\u201d I croak, still hardly believing it myself.\nThe skin billows about, revealing a chiseled chin and thin lips.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve been Dran for just about as long as you\u2019ve known me.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is only a few months.\u201d\n\u201cYes, granted, but Dran was gone from day one. There never really was a Dran. Just an ID. Someone whose face was appropriated . . . \u201d\n\u201cHarvested,\u201d I whisper.\n\u201cYes, taken, and used. Bad luck he had compatible DNA with the tech. Now there are Drans all over the colonies. Not just here. So, I\u2019ve been Dran, because it\u2019s a safe, easy ID. I\u2019m just trying to survive.\u201d\n\u201cBy just trying to survive, you mean leading those guys in?\u201d\n\u201cI had no choice. They found out my real ID, threatened my kid. My daughter, for ice-sakes. Besides, I wouldn\u2019t talk if I were you. Who are you working for?\u201d\nIn this stark world, everyone owed everyone else something. We were always the dregs, the ones on the bottom, scrambling to persist. To exist. Everyone. Even the scientists who fare a little better are held accountable to a bigger fish.\nI shove my tip closer to his face, causing the skin to flare up even higher and uncover a piercing hazel eye. It shone almost as fiercely as the ice of iridescent lake.\n\u201cBiotech. Interesting. It responds almost simultaneously. Must be paired.\u201d I lay the tip of the harpoon there, waiting.\n\u201cDodging the question, I see,\u201d he says. His skin continues to swell and flare up from the harpoon contact, and he\u2019s giving me a righteous look.\nI jab him lightly on the shoulder with the sharp tip and he squeals an \u201cow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not working for anyone. I\u2019m, uh, what you call freelance.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you scouring the ice. You\u2019re looking for something. Probably have scraped stuff, just like everyone else tries to.\u201d He grabs a book, an old relic and luxury from the Center about the ice mom and child myth, and throws it at my face. I parry it aside as he jumps back against the wall. I lodge the harpoon into the wall and pull it out, with pounded regolith dust billowing about. For a moment the dust disorients me, and he runs to another side of the room, picking up my old tethering suit, whipping its arm at me.\n\u201cNot much of a weapon.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s flappy and difficult to cut through. A perfect defensive tool.\u201d\nI run the harpoon through it like a rag doll and throw it backward. Too bad. That was my favorite and only tethering suit. Some good memories.\nHe holds his hands up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight you. I just want to get out of here. Everyone\u2019s trying to kill each other on this slippin\u2019 piece of rock, and I just want to make it alive to see my family and meanwhile make enough dough to feed \u2019em. Look\u2014I know what they\u2019re all looking for. I know you\u2019re working on getting the materials, too. If not for the Burnaways, then for someone else. I made a calculation and Central would eviscerate me faster than the Burnaways for giving away the codes for them to harvest ice.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, they would,\u201d I say, feeling a bit queasy about that. So many violations not yet to my name. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\n\u201cWell I needed the time to contact my daughter, make sure she was really okay. My faceplant wasn\u2019t from them\u2014it was a job done long ago so I could provide for my family. It\u2019s on a loan, and I\u2019m still paying that back. I need this job, if I still have it. I suspected, and still do, that you have someone that has you . . . \u201d He points at my eviscerated tethering suit in the corner. \u201c . . . tethered.\u201d\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why you never harvested the ice yourself to sell to jewelers.\u201d\nDran laughs. It\u2019s an ugly sound, full of wheezing. He\u2019s still hurting. \u201cYou don\u2019t know. Isn\u2019t that why they\u2019re in your pocket? I thought you knew. It\u2019s not really the jewelers. It\u2019s cosmetics.\u201d\nMy stomach does a flip. I suspected, but I never really knew.\nI\u2019m not sure if I want to know who I\u2019m helping. I always thought it was for gem lords or the drug industry, I mumble, mostly to myself. Dran responds.\n\u201cYes, it is the drug industry. The cosmetic industry. Face transplants. They\u2019re trying to find biomatter in the ice.\u201d\n\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t any. We\u2019ve done extensive testing . . . \u201d I trail off, realizing that I incriminated myself with we, grouping myself with the scientists.\n\u201cIt\u2019s there. Preliminary scans show it. The ice is alive. It\u2019s hiding its DNA patterns. But, it must be there. They\u2019re using it to enhance the breadth of face transplant options. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve gathered from the little conversation I\u2019ve had with the Burnaways.\u201d\nThe Burnaways. I think about my son\u2019s face. Haolai. Burned off when I got him back. I remember what the classified search of the logo scan revealed. Phoenixes\u2014new life. Sure, they may have brought people new lives with new IDs, but only from burning the old. They\u2019d harvested Haolai, left him dead. They needed not just a DNA sample. They needed an Extraction. A fatal facial and fluids Extraction. Typical procedure. He didn\u2019t tell me that when he signed away his life. He didn\u2019t tell me that when he was running, when they poached him. He probably didn\u2019t know. Who in their right mind would sign away their life? It was a dirty lie by the Burnaways, an unconscionable trick. Filthy . . .\n\u201cI think what they\u2019re doing now is trying to find the magic solution that would bind with the tech to alter any type of DNA so it becomes a burnable face match. Not just from a particular type of DNA that sticks, but all kinds. This way, they can harvest all sorts of face types. They would have more to sell . . . \u201d\nHe says this almost in regret. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I let you go?\u201d I ask. \u201cGive me one reason not to turn you in.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re involved. And you\u2019re curious. We can keep our jobs if we can catch them in the act. If we stick it to them, we might just win. We have to bank that the Guard will prosecute, that the Burnaways\u2019 reach isn\u2019t too deep.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what if it is?\u201d\n\u201cMy gut says it\u2019s not. Yunhe, I know how to stop them. Don\u2019t you want to try?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know why I trust him. Dran, this Dran, as it turns out, has always had my back for the three brutal months I\u2019ve been on this planet. We\u2019ve worked side by side day after day. It\u2019s not long, but when all you got is a colleague, then well, I figure he\u2019s the best ally I\u2019ve got. Besides, the ice is ruined thus far and we could both be fired, but if we can frame this as the crime it was, and highlight our successful attempt to thwart it and contain the threat, then maybe we can escape penalization and keep our jobs. That\u2019s all we want. To survive.\nIt occurs to me I\u2019ll never get the monetary payoff I expected from my contraband ice. I only engaged in it blindly, never suspected that the science I was helping was the same science that facilitated the killing of my son. Face harvesting. No, I would not make it more widespread.\nI\u2019m ambivalent about Dran and his fake face. Half of me wants to rip the thing off with the tuned harpoon. Reveal his secrets. The other half believes him\u2014that he has a family, that what was done was done and it\u2019s time to think of how to stop people from committing this heinous crime.\nA moral impasse. Who to believe?\nDran knows a lot more than he says. He\u2019s good at that. I make him peel off his face for me\u2014as a gesture of trust. I have the harpoon up against his forehead. His face responds in turn.\nHis eyes are asymmetrical, one\u2019s wide-eyed and golden, the other shrunken. He\u2019s also got a scar across his cheek. \u201cAnother reason for me to stay under wraps,\u201d he says, grinning.\nI tell him to keep his wrapping face, his faceplant for now. At least then I won\u2019t have to be constantly rattled by his unnerving look. Though, I admit, there is something vulnerable about it, something that asks to be accepted.\nDran replies that he has to keep his face anyway, for ID purposes. Right, there\u2019s that.\n\u201cBesides, I need it to take the Burnaways down.\u201d\n\u201cTake Burnaways down, huh? You have something in mind to make that happen?\u201d\n\u201cAre you in? Because, I\u2019ll show you. We\u2019ll need a plan though.\u201d\nWe ride in the dark in one of the off-network clandestine jalopies. It\u2019s cheap and uncomfortable, but best of all, it won\u2019t leave a trace. No one can hack it and tell you where we\u2019ve been. It\u2019s great business here on this mostly barren land.\nWe approach the great expanse of the lake. It\u2019s iridescent and shimmering as ever and the security has been upgraded\u2014the algorithms must have picked up on the breach and updated it, washing away human foul as it always does: blood, vomit, pee. Lots of people get sick on the ice and release strange fluids from their suits. The AIs process this stuff. These things get done automatically, but soon the security uppers will learn about the atypical incident during the weekly briefing. We have a few days before it all gets unraveled.\nWe don\u2019t target the iridescent lake exactly. No, we stop and drive west another hundred meters. I see nothing, just rocks and craters. Dran puts the car on hold and we jump off. I scan with my security-grade detector. Nothing. I\u2019m carrying my newfound weapon of choice for good measure: the harpoon, wrapped up in a shiny plasticine cloth.\nDran\u2019s on his hands and knees, hunting, sometimes looking up.\nHe points at the harpoon and I use it to dig. He does the same with a small shovel. The rock is hard, but Dran has brought chemical sprays to loosen the rock under the regolith. We dig and dig and there\u2019s the smallest line. Just a tiny, flaccid pipe. It leads two ways.\nOne goes into a vestibule that we unearth. The other seems to go on forever, toward the lake.\nI realize that this is it\u2014there\u2019s been a constant microdrainage of the lake. The whole time I\u2019ve been standing on the surface, guarding it, while also nipping away at its crust, there was a whole other dimension I wasn\u2019t protecting (or nabbing from).\n\u201cThey melt the ice under the lake. They get these nanos to worm under and commence melting and it feeds into these pipes. Very, very expensive tech. They have to be really careful about it because a micro too much would trigger the security defenses. So, they just take the smallest bit at a time.\u201d\nI can\u2019t believe they went through so much trouble just to nab a little ice, not even a trickle, just this tiny bit. But it does go for quite a hefty price on the market.\nDran takes some evidence. He snaps holomedia with a small recording device.\n\u201cThe ice is agitated. It\u2019s why it\u2019s been acting erratically. There\u2019s a balance to it all. The iridescence recently has been kind of changing color.\u201d\nDran\u2019s snapping a photo of the vestibule, a container even smaller than the harpoon, when I hear a loud whirring sound above. The atmocopter.\nI see the harpoon is glowing, sensing its presence. The phoenix logo fills in with fluorescence. I groan. Great, now we\u2019re really visible.\nI hear two thumps on the ground and then I see them. The Haolai doppelganger and the female smuggler. The one who I slipped several minimarbles to. My heart sinks. I thought my goodwill would appease her, but\u2014\nIt\u2019s not her. Same eyes, same pursed lips. Her body\u2019s different though. Bigger, chunkier. Face harvests, I remind myself. Her hair, still red, isn\u2019t quite as bright as before.\nI find it incredibly tough to be combatting someone who looks like my dead son, but I pull out my makeshift skate-knife-boomerang and chuck it at them. My hit misses fake Haolai and grazes the female outlaw of the pair.\nShe surprises me with her athleticism. Her jumps are swift, which you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell from her stocky body shape. She leaps to grab me, and I dodge. I run.\nMeanwhile, Dran\u2019s on this version of Haolai\u2014using a shovel as a weapon to swing at him.\nI hear a bam and whoosh and a beeping. As I interpret the series of beeps, I realize that they had tracked us through the harpoon. Why didn\u2019t I think of that? Of course, a homing device.\nWell, too late. As I swing the harpoon the woman catches up to me. I see her fake eyes widen as I leap up\u2014so used to my tricks on the ice\u2014and come down at her with the full might of the harpoon right onto the weak point of her helmet.\nShe crumbles. The helmet visor goes completely clear. Her red hair\u2019s splayed all over her face. She\u2019s moaning and then silent. Knocked out. I check her vitals from her helmet, which still works despite the impact. She\u2019s still breathing. Good. She\u2019s probably street scum . . . like me. Wouldn\u2019t want her dead.\nAll that\u2019s left is Haolai. I can\u2019t deal with him. I can\u2019t confront him. For a second, I step back, thinking I\u2019ll just run away while I can. Everything is wrong. He, the real he, should be alive, and instead there are so many phantoms of him running around.\nThen I see this fake Haolai knock Dran in the solar plexus. Dran is keeled over, adjusting his helmet, and the fake Haolai delivers a punt, sending Dran flying. He lands with a thud. I don\u2019t want to know what he\u2019s cracked in that body of his.\nI take the harpoon and grab the ice vestibule that we unearthed. That precious payload. The skin of the vestibule is firm, keeping the ice at a steady frozen state, though I do see the contents shifting slightly. The collected amount is the size of a head. I can\u2019t believe, that through a series of tiny collections, they\u2019re able to add up to that much. It must have been an ongoing project.\nFake Haolai sees me and he\u2019s looking at Dran, then to me, making the calculation. I wave the vestibule to goad him. Yes, of course the vestibule is worth more than finishing off Dran\u2014no matter how much he punched you. Come and get it.\nI\u2019m about to head out on the ice and he\u2019s following me. I cut through the checkpoint, bypassing the inspections with my in-knowledge and slip on two blades over my boots to form skates\u2014thank the slickness for keeping spare blades on me at all times.\nI skate out to the middle of the lake and let the vestibule roll. It\u2019s a risk, but I\u2019m low on options. He chases it. It gives me enough time to grab incriminating media from Dran\u2019s device and upload the media to the surveillance team\u2014this time skipping the AI algorithms and going direct to Central.\nI throw my makeshift boomerang again and it misses fake Haolai, but it just taps the vestibule in the right way, nudging it toward me on the slick ice. Just as I intended. The ice seems to be rooting for me, pushing it my way in ripples.\nI\u2019m faster than fake Haolai on ice. The ice is in tune with me, perhaps expecting a happy reunion with its brethren, its own missing part. I break the vestibule with the harpoon, and it spills out crystals, which melt and conform with the ice. I\u2019ve never seen the lake do that\u2014just kind of pull in more of itself like it just did.\nFake Haolai catches me unguarded and slams into me. The wind\u2019s knocked out of me and I cough. I regain my senses, recover my footing, and send some blade-loaded kicks his way. He\u2019s distracted and I knock him a good one on the arm.\nA net lands on top of him and he yelps. Behind me, I see a holotranslation floating in the air. \u201cThat\u2019ll keep you from slipping away.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Dran, doubled over in pain, sprawled on the ice, still somehow waving at me. I spray fake Haolai down with the rest of the remi-glu until we can get the security here. I crinkle my nose as the pungent goop works its charm.\nI don\u2019t feel bad about my small acts of ice smuggling because while a part of my covert operation was to ferry ice out, I was always careful to make it a point to ferry the samples back onto the lake. I never facilitated a net loss of ice, just let some out for research for a while. That was the deal, and maybe it\u2019s unusual but the promises were always kept.\nNow that they\u2019ve taken fake Haolai and the redhead into custody, and there\u2019s a larger syndicate unraveling, I can say that I\u2019m happy that they\u2019re impeding the further advancement of these ID-slip masks. They never got the biomatter that they suspected would help bind more DNA to masks. The biomatter of the iridescent ice would continue to elude them.\nThe lake\u2019s sneaky like that.\nDran has shed his own mask\u2014he\u2019s now back to his old face and allowed to keep it in public through some forgiveness program. All his petty crimes have been outed. I\u2019ve been promoted and have access to the collection of small confiscated things\u2014like gloves, ice skates, and key fobs. My past infringements never got aired out. My luck, I guess. The harpoon, I had to turn in to a higher security facility in the Center.\nAfter much hunting, I found the special hover vehicle that a certain key fob opens. The one that the first fake Haolai I met must have driven. It\u2019s abandoned in the refuse zone, and no one\u2019s bothered to check it out.\nInside, it\u2019s dark and the lights don\u2019t work. It smells dank and strangely musky. I shine a light in. I see Haolai\u2019s face draped over one of the seats. It\u2019s still fresh, not yet out so long that it\u2019s decayed. It looks so uncanny, saggy, and lifeless, yet very much Haolai, with some translucent material at the eyes.\n\u201cOne day, maybe I\u2019ll find your orbiting body,\u201d I say, plying the face from the headrest, cradling it in my fist. \u201cI\u2019ll get enough money to lasso it and I can get you complete. Your face won\u2019t be burned away after all. You won\u2019t be a blank. You\u2019ll have a face after all, an expression, with features. As meaningful and expressive as the ice of the iridescent lake.\u201d\nI look into these translucent eyes, this phantom of his, pulling out star charts to calculate when it will be that I can complete him. I roll up and store his face in one of my extra contraband minimarbles, which glistens with this package, illuminating with a flare as bright as iridescent ice and fading to a glow in my pocket.\nD.A.

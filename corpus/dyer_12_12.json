I fell.\n As I plunged shoulder-deep into fetid sink-silt, I had time to think, I\u2019m not fit to take Mother\u2019s place, before the arboreal ant\u2019s nest I\u2019d been reaching for dropped after me, cracking open on my upturned face.\n The copper and iron in the dilly bags at my waist dragged me down, deeper than I could have gone down alone. I clenched everything, crying silently, bearing the pain of the bites without opening my eyes or mouth until the silt closed over my head and the ants began drowning.\n I could hold my breath longer than they could.\n Eventually, with stale air burning in my lungs, I reached overhead, breaking the surface of the tidal flat while my scissoring legs created a water-filled space, reducing the suction. My fingers found the arched stilt-roots of the mangrove tree I\u2019d been climbing and I pulled myself slowly, laboriously out of the muck.\n There was a thin layer of briny water on top of the silt. My arm and back muscles burned, but I skimmed some water for washing my face, which was already beginning to swell.\n The bites didn\u2019t burn as badly as my pride.\n Everybody will see them!\n Mother would see, and I didn\u2019t even have the prize to show for it. The ants\u2019 nest, made of mangrove leaves cemented with larval silk, with its core of precious gold metal, was now lost in the mud. Only floating leaves and gold-ant corpses were left behind. At least my bag belt had held; at least I hadn\u2019t lost the whole day\u2019s forage.\n Nosey, the yellow hunting dog who had found the nest for me, whined softly from his seat on a stilt platform of mangrove roots and flotsam. The sunset behind him gave him a florescent pink aura.\n \u201cSorry, Nosey,\u201d I said quietly. His reward was usually chunks of ant larvae and the salty-sweet jelly that surrounded the metal core. \u201cDid you hear that sound, though?\u201d\n Nosey tilted his long face to one side. He had a blind eye and worn-down teeth. His hearing wasn\u2019t that great, but his nose still worked.\n The sound had come from downwind.\n I hugged a tree trunk and, trying to make up for my earlier impatience, expanded my awareness. Sharks wouldn\u2019t come into the mangroves, risking entrapment and death. Nor would crocodiles, unable to navigate the maze of aerial roots. If the wallowing animal was one of the Island People coming to trade, they had missed the beach camp by about two kilometers and I hadn\u2019t heard the distinctive whirr of their heli.\n If it was wireminds, perhaps my noisy fall had frightened them away.\n I shivered.\n If it was wireminds, perhaps they killed all the Island People, and there will be no trade, no whirring heli, ever again.\n Once again, I berated myself: Mother would never think that way. It was probably an eagle taking a fish! The Island People are due in four days.\n The Island People.\n We called them Balanda, once. Five hundred years ago they stole our land. Two hundred years ago, they gave it back. Except for Shark Island, which they said was strategic and necessary for them to protect us from the wireminds that lived across the sea.\n Ten years ago, though, when the wireminds invaded from the other direction, the Island People were helpless to stop them. All of our initiated men gathered up their explosive-tipped spears and returning EMP boomerangs and went to fight.\n None of the men came back. Not my father and not my mother\u2019s brother. I was one of the oldest children and I remember the weeping.\n The wireminds temporarily won for themselves what they thought was isolated territory, free of the modified, metal-mining ants that had ravaged the rest of the world. They saw us and thought we were proof. Little did they know we had been living with the ants for decades, that we were skilled in keeping our few precious electronic devices safe from them.\n Ants ate the wiremind shelters, their vehicles, exoskeletons and communications devices. They ate their wristwatches. Their boot buckles. When the soldiers lay down to sleep, they were woken by ants trying to bore through their skulls to get at the metal implants inside.\n Cut off from their commanders, they were too afraid of us to ask for help. Or perhaps they thought they had killed us all. They starved, died of exposure or poisoned themselves unknowingly with the flesh of native animals.\n For our land and seas were polluted with pesticides that had failed to stop the relentless march of the ants. Every animal that survived had adapted by sequestering or becoming resistant to the toxins. We could only eat the animals ourselves because of the vials of gut bacteria constantly supplied to us by the Island People in exchange for metallic gold, silver, copper and iron. The island that they had kept was their only refuge, their southern heartland destroyed, fallen into lawlessness.\n Just as I was about to give up and return to the beach camp, I heard the noise again from the direction of open water.\n With my hand, I gave Nosey the signal to circle behind prey; he went away silently, paddy paws light on the stilt-roots.\n Camouflaged by my coating of mud, I went in a straight line toward the source of the sound.\n It was a tall, skinny woman dragging a pair of pressurized gas tanks behind her. A pair of flippers were abandoned far behind her, where it seemed they\u2019d become a liability in the mud, but she persisted with the bulky metal cylinders, though she must have known they would attract ants.\n She was pale, not from breeding, I thought, but from being kept in the dark. Her head was shaved. A square electronic device was strapped to her chest over the top of a soggy, sack-like smock. Bra straps stuck out over her shoulders. Her exposed arms were covered in fresh insect bites. Older bites on her legs were turned to weeping, mud-smeared sores.\n \u201cThis is Clan territory,\u201d I said, and she jolted feverishly as though ants had already started eating her bra wire. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d\n I saw Nosey cut off her retreat to the ocean, sniffing interestedly at her flippers.\n \u201cI got to find Rivers-of-Milk,\u201d she gasped, naming the one who was birth mother to me and spiritual mother to the Clan.\n \u201cI am Quiet-One,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou\u2019re her daughter, then.\u201d\n \u201cYou know me? What else do you know about us?\u201d\n She laughed crazily.\n \u201cI know you have vials of bacteria. I know that you trade for them. My name is Muhsina. They sterilized my gut as punishment. If you don\u2019t help me, I\u2019ll die.\u201d\n Fires flickered on the beach.\n Rivers-of-Milk stood with her hunting dog, Bloodmuzzle, beneath the safe tree, where dilly bags of metals were hung like sparkling fruit.\n Each time we moved camp, a tree was chosen that harbored nests of fierce, meat-eating green ants. Green ants could not prevail over the metal-mining ants for more than a season; they had monstrous, crushing, acid-oozing mandibles, but their numbers were too small.\n Still, it was only a few days until the trade tide, and then our small guardians would no longer be needed. Children caught crickets and cicadas and pinned them to the bark of high branches to keep the green ants moving up and down the trunk, hyper-alert for intruders from any rival nest.\n Nosey ran straight over to Bloodmuzzle and started licking his shit-caked anus. Bloodmuzzle did the same to Nosey. Dogs were disgusting. The shaved-headed woman, Muhsina, shadowed me. I\u2019d helped tie her tanks to a mangrove tree and submerge them so that ants wouldn\u2019t get them.\n Mother accepted my mud-stinking bags. She didn\u2019t mention my stung face. Her encouraging smile was the same whether I brought great chunks of metal or none at all, but eating me inside was the drive to deliver, just once, more metal than she had gathered herself.\n To prove myself.\n Skink\u2019s mother, Brushfire, felt no need to be encouraging. The plump little woman leaned over to peer at the bags\u2014her eyesight was failing\u2014and cackled,\n \u201cNot even enough for a full vial, girl. You want us hungry. You want to be Rivers-of-Milk yourself. Ha ha ha!\u201d\n Skink would be my husband when he became an initiated man. He hid behind his mother\u2019s legs now, a twelve year old boy with long eyelashes.\n Skink and I had no need to drink the vials of bacteria. The Island People said that sometimes, with children, the intestinal environment was suitable for the bacteria to breed by themselves.\n Whatever that meant.\n The point was, if we didn\u2019t have metals to trade, it would be the adults who starved to death.\n I felt conscious of Muhsina close by me. She had not said whether she would require a single vial in order to survive, or repeated doses.\n The cooking smells were distracting and had to be making Muhsina\u2019s mouth water. Poison toad, poison croc and poison barracuda; they roasted on long spits over the fires, but Muhsina could not eat, not without first drinking a vial, and only my mother could grant one to her.\n \u201cWhat is your story, Island Woman?\u201d Rivers-of-Milk asked, beckoning to Muhsina.\n Muhsina\u2019s exhausted, shambling shape moved around me, to sit at my mother\u2019s feet in supplication.\n \u201cMy name is Muhsina,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said I was crazy, but I\u2019m not crazy. People scare me sometimes, that\u2019s what. Lots of people all in one place, breathing on me like wasp stings. All those women in the same room as me, sleeping, sucking up my oxygen, I had to kill them. It\u2019s better out here.\u201d\n \u201cOf course it is,\u201d my mother said without blinking. \u201cWhy did you take so long to come?\u201d\n \u201cCause I\u2019ll die, that\u2019s what. After I killed those others, they put in a stomach tube and flushed me out with antibiotics. Left me in hospital to starve to death, but after I\u2019d been starving for a while, I could fit through the bars. Didn\u2019t think of that, did they? Stole the thing that the net-divers use, the thing that makes the electrical signature of the mother of all sharks. Kept me safe as far as the mainland.\u201d\n \u201cYou asked for me by name.\u201d\n \u201cI heard them talking about you. Said you hid in the bushes and watched while all those metalminds starved, because you had no mercy for them not of your own kind.\u201d\n \u201cThe metalminds killed our men.\u201d\n \u201cAnd I killed Island People, and you\u2019ve got a treaty with them. Are you gonna let me starve? Because to me, Rivers-of-Milk is the name of a woman who feeds starving people.\u201d\n Rivers-of-Milk put her hand on Bloodmuzzle\u2019s head, smoothing one silken ear.\n \u201cThis dog serves the Clan and I feed him. How will you serve, Muhsina?\u201d\n \u201cInformation,\u201d Muhsina said with a glint in her eye. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll be gone. Over the mountains and west. You\u2019ll never see me again. You\u2019ll never need to worry if I\u2019ll bring harm to your young ones, because I\u2019ll be gone away forever.\u201d\n \u201cGive her a vial,\u201d Rivers-of-Milk said to Skink, who scrambled immediately up the tree to fetch one.\n And because we had saved her, Muhsina told us everything she knew, in the firelight, as we ate poison toad, poison croc and poison barramundi.\n She told us more than we wanted to know about what the Island People had done with all of the metals we had given them.\n In the morning, I helped my mother prepare for the ceremony.\n Muhsina was already gone and my mind was with spinning with all that she had said.\n While Rivers-of-Milk made the sweet sugar-cane water intended to fill the drinker with the wisdom of birds, I ground drowned green ants between two rocks to make the citrus-acid water that filled the drinker with the wisdom of ants. Brushfire beat a malleable golden ant-core into the shape of a metal flame, fixing it in place of a spear-tip on a long, hardwood haft, and Skink prepared strips of dried turtle and shark meat, saying the words over them so they would give the eater the wisdom of reptiles and the wisdom of fish, respectively.\n \u201cHow can it be true,\u201d I blurted at last, \u201cthat the Island People can manufacture a great wave, a great flood, such as the one Muhsina described?\u201d\n \u201cIt is a great stupidity,\u201d my mother said angrily. \u201cTheir machine will drown all of us but it will not drown the ants. Water will cover us but it will not cover the high mountains. The ants will come back, worse than before. Do they not know that mountain ants eat through living flesh to reach the minerals in bones? That they build their nests around white, bony cores? If the Island People kill the gold ants and the silver ants and the copper ants, the bone ants will come.\u201d\n \u201cThe madwoman lied to us,\u201d Brushfire scoffed. \u201cThere will be no wave. If the Island People are so clever why do they need to wait for the wet season before unleashing this great wave? Why not do it now? We need do nothing, Freshwater.\u201d\n Freshwater was my mother\u2019s name before she became leader. Before she became Rivers-of-Milk. Brushfire shouldn\u2019t have called her that.\n \u201cI must ask for guidance,\u201d was all my mother said.\n \u201cLet me help you with that, mother,\u201d I said, wanting to show her that I paid attention, that I remembered how to make the bird drink. I took the rest of the cane from her.\n \u201cYou look too ugly for my son,\u201d Brushfire said to me. \u201cYour face tells me that you have the wisdom of ants already!\u201d\n \u201cThe pelican is my sister,\u201d I said, naming my spirit animal, thinking furiously: It will be the wisdom of birds that we need. The pelican flies far inland to nest. We should go far inland, where the wave will not reach us.\n We should go where Muhsina went. Over the mountains and west.\n When night fell, fifty-seven warm bodies gathered around the fire.\n Fifty-seven members of my great family began to sing, tossing dried coconut palm fronds into the flame to feed it.\n I stared across at my mother, imagining I was her. When Skink became a man and I became his wife, all of my mother\u2019s tasks would become mine.\n Her chin was lifted. Eyes lidded. Hands outstretched. She was our protector. She was our mother.\n I was so hypnotized by her that I didn\u2019t even see the golden flame fall. Didn\u2019t know which direction it had shown to her until her lips moved.\n \u201cWhat we need is the wisdom of ants,\u201d she said, lifting the wooden bowl full of the elixir I had prepared. She sipped from it and passed the bowl to Brushfire, who sat beside her.\n Because I watched her so closely, I saw the flicker of fear on her face.\n I was shocked to realize she didn\u2019t know what to say next.\n The spirits had not spoken to her.\n I felt in that moment I left childhood behind, though it was some time since I\u2019d become a woman. The wisdom of ants which we waited for was nothing but my mother\u2019s own wisdom. It fell to her alone to decide whether Muhsina was lying or whether the Island People had betrayed us; whether we could trust them and continue trading with them or whether they would use a machine made of copper, iron, silver and gold to make an underwater earthquake and an unprecedented tidal wave in the hope that the mainland could be made safe for their growing numbers and their metal-loving way of life.\n \u201cThe ants that live by freshwater,\u201d my mother said, \u201cbuild their leaf-nests high in the branches of trees. When the wet season raises the water level, the nests stay safe. The ants teach us that the trees are safe. When we go to the forest camp for the wet season, we will build wooden platforms high in the trees. They will keep us safe when the wave comes.\u201d\n \u201cAnd the Island People?\u201d Brushfire demanded. \u201cWill we continue to trade with them?\u201d\n \u201cWe will give them no more metals,\u201d my mother answered calmly. \u201cAnts keep their gold and silver safe, close to their hearts. We shall do the same.\u201d\n Fifty-seven warm bodies leaped to their feet, roaring in outrage. It was my mother\u2019s death sentence. It meant the death of half the Clan.\n In all the commotion, I felt Skink\u2019s hand sneaking into my palm and gripping tight.\n I squeezed his hand in return without looking at him. He would be shamed if anybody noticed his need for comfort, his future wife included. My heart thudded. I realized that my mother did not trust the Island People; had never trusted them, though they had kept us alive all this time with their magical vials.\n \u201cCome here, Quiet-One,\u201d Rivers-of-Milk commanded, and I quickly detached my hand and fell to the sand at my mother\u2019s feet. She took the glass bottle that had hung on a cord around her neck since the men had gone away, and put it around my neck. \u201cI give up the name Rivers-of-Milk. It is yours, now. I am Freshwater. I will take no more food from the Clan. I have died. I will go to the sea caves.\u201d\n I stared at her, rivers of tears flowing down my cheeks.\n That is the new name I deserve: Rivers-of-Tears.\n Rivers-of-Mud.\n Rivers-of-Bodies, drowned in the flood, if I make poor decisions for the Clan.\n I reached for her, but she could not take my hand. She was gone; dead. She had said the words. Without trade, there would be no more vials, and instead of starving horrifically in front of the children, my mother and the other women would, instead, leave us with untarnished memories by starving alone in the caves.\n She made the motion with her hand for Bloodmuzzle to stay behind, and his plaintive whimper was the whimper I wanted to make.\n Don\u2019t leave me, I begged her with my eyes in silence, but she turned and walked away.\n Brushfire\u2019s teeth were bared in fury, but she spat,\n \u201cI have died. I will go to the sea caves.\u201d\n She turned on her heel to follow Freshwater into darkness. I remembered my mother eating ant-jelly in secret; she was supposed to give it to the dog but she couldn\u2019t help eating it herself. I remembered Brushfire, talking to her husband\u2019s totem, the turtle, telling it how much she missed him every day.\n When Brushfire caught up with Freshwater, she struck her old friend, hard, on the back of the head, but it didn\u2019t matter what dead people did; they couldn\u2019t be acknowledged by the living. One by one, the women said the words and went away from the fire, until there was nobody left but crying children and me. I was technically a woman but had been a child at heart until only a moment past.\n The bottle. I wrapped my palm around the glass. My mother had carried it since the warriors went away to die. Inside, a tiny, solar-powered voice recorder, sealed in black plastic, floated in seawater that would keep it safe from ants until the time came for Skink\u2019s initiation. The voice of my mother\u2019s dead brother would tell Skink what to do.\n \u201cI will take care of you,\u201d I said to the children. Some of them stopped crying, but most of them had to be pushed away by the dead people they were trying to cling to.\n It felt stupid. I couldn\u2019t take care of them. I wanted to give Skink the bottle right now and send him away for his initiation. He would come back to us with a new name, Blood-of-the-Shark, and it would be his responsibility to see that the Clan obeyed the wisdom of the ant, that safe tree-houses were built when we moved to the forest camp.\n I looked around at what was left of us, twenty-eight little bodies around a smoldering beach fire, and I realized that a bunch of children could never build wooden platforms in high treetops. We were small and still-growing.\n We were weak.\n \u201cSkink, help me put them to bed,\u201d I begged, and we tucked the other children into their bark tents and shushed them until they stopped crying and fell asleep. I tried not to think of all the mothers at the caves, in blackness, sitting in sand, watching the waves that would soon wash their spirits back out to sea, to the place where spirits came from.\n The wisdom of ants.\n \u201cTwo days until the Island People come,\u201d Skink said as we banked the fire.\n \u201cDo you think I should trade with them?\u201d I asked him at once. If I could get more vials, the mothers wouldn\u2019t have to die. I could save them. They\u2019re dead, but I\u2019m Rivers-of-Milk, now. I could give life back to them! Just this once, I could deliver something better than my mother delivered. Life, instead of death.\n \u201cAsk the ants, I suppose,\u201d Skink shrugged. \u201cI suppose we won\u2019t kill those ants anymore.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re like a totem for the Clan, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n \u201cThe totem for the Clan is the shark. We still kill sharks.\u201d\n \u201cOnly when making new men.\u201d\n And I saw his mouth firm with determination, and felt shame at my cowardice at wanting to pass my burden on to this brave, shy little boy.\n The wisdom of ants.\n \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t kill them any more. Maybe we should even protect them from the Island People.\u201d\n \u201cHow?\u201d Skink wanted to know.\n \u201cTake care of the others,\u201d I told Skink. \u201cKeep Bloodmuzzle with you. I\u2019ll come back in two days. I\u2019ll be here when the Island People come. Don\u2019t be afraid. And don\u2019t let any of the children join the dead.\u201d\n The first day, I waited in mud.\n Muhsina\u2019s metal tanks were buried in mud except for the thin metal rims and twin openings at the top. It only took two hours for the first, fresh-hatched silver-ant-queen to arrive, with a cadre of winged workers, also fresh-hatched, to help her begin construction of a new nest.\n The tang of metal had induced the nearby nest to divide. It had drawn the new queen.\n As soon as she and her workers moved into the tank, I leaped up and flung enough ant-jelly on top of them to trap them in the bottom of the tank. Followed by two handfuls of mangrove muck to make sure they didn\u2019t eat through the jelly and escape, I put the tank seals on before digging the tanks out and moving to a new place on the tidal flat.\n Nosey sniffed out a new nest for me within minutes. This one was copper-ants. I re-buried the tanks at the base of the tree where the nest was, and waited for another queen to be hatched.\n By nightfall, the sealed tank contained twenty new ant queens.\n I shouldered the tanks as the moon rose over the sea and the incoming tide lapped at the flippers on my feet. Jelly and trapped air would keep the queens alive. I had until sunrise before the earliest-caught ants, energized by the rich jelly, breached the metal of the tank.\n \u201cYou think the tank metal is a treat?\u201d I whispered to the ants as I waded into the water, the shark-signal device strapped to my chest, already activated. \u201cJust wait until you get to the Island.\u201d\n I swam out to sea, green turtles lolling in the water on either side of me, mistaking me for some monstrous relative, showing no fear. We came to the surface together to breathe, emptying capacious lungs and drinking air from sweet darkness before diving again.\n There was a net.\n Muhsina had not mentioned how she\u2019d passed it.\n In the moonlight, I\u2019d seen the floats on the surface, forming a ring around Shark Island. I\u2019d seen razor wire gleaming under the sweep of spotlights, mounted on the Island\u2019s stone towers beside guns of terrible range and accuracy.\n When I went to swim under, the net caught and held me by the left arm and left leg. I hadn\u2019t seen it. I had no shell blade with me, and if I had, it wouldn\u2019t have been sharp enough to cut the plastic rope.\n I tried to relax my body; to behave as I might if I was caught in mangrove sludge.\n Think.\n Conserve energy.\n There will be no more oxygen unless you think of a way to get free!\n A spotlight brightened the water around me.\n For an instant, I saw the bodies of dead sharks trapped in the net.\n Shark Island.\n The totem for the Clan is the shark.\n My body felt numb; I didn\u2019t know if it was because I was drowning or because I finally knew what I must do to escape the net. I took the glass bottle around my neck and smashed it against the metal tanks.\n I had no spare hand to catch the voice recorder as it floated away; I could only grip tight to the neck of the bottle. With the broken glass, I sheared quickly and easily through the net.\n Surfacing on the other side was like walking into the death caves. I had killed the Clan. Skink and the other young boys could never become men. There would be no more children.\n I tried my best not to bawl as I swam the rest of the way to the Island. I should never have come. Everything was ruined. The mothers had sacrificed themselves for nothing.\n When I reached the fortified shores, it was as though the shark spirit whose egg-casing had become Shark Island sought to comfort me. Swinging spotlights missed me by hand\u2019s-breadths. By chance, I\u2019d come aground by a concrete pipe that dribbled effluent, and was able to climb inside.\n I crawled up the pipe until I came to a plastic grate, which I smashed with the heavy weight of the tanks and passed through into a room full of glass stills, vials and wooden racks. There was a ceramic jar of sea salt and a stack of cut cane.\n The blackness was held at bay only by the red light on my shark-mimicking device which flashed when it was operational. I used the tiny guide to escape the still-room into a stairwell that led up to a walled vegetable garden.\n With the last of my strength, I buried the tanks in the brown, sewer-smelling soil of the garden, re-planted two rows of carrots on top, then crawled back into the stairwell to fall asleep in the muck at the bottom.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Skink,\u201d I whispered in the dark, my heart broken all over again.\n When I woke, ants were crawling on the device still strapped to me.\n Stifling a shout, I crushed out the lives of three little workers. They were my allies, but I needed the device to get home. My face was crusted with mud and still swollen from earlier bites. It felt like lifetimes since I\u2019d brought my meager bounty back to my mother, Muhsina in tow.\n I heard voices from the still-room. Risked a look through the light-filled crack of the closed door.\n A man in a clean, white coat was pulling folded white napkins, soiled with what looked and smelled like baby-shit, from a white plastic bag. A second man was scraping the shit off the napkins with a wooden spoon.\n He mixed it in a large beaker with water, squeezing fresh sugar cane juice into the water, adding a pinch of salt and the yolk of an egg.\n Then, he divided the mixture amongst twenty vials, stoppered them with sugar cane pith, and packed them into the loops of a belt I had seen many times before.\n \u201cIncubator\u2019s down,\u201d he said to the other man, laughing. \u201cBody heat will do.\u201d\n I retreated to the stairwell.\n Though it was still dark under there, I wondered that my bare hands weren\u2019t made incandescent by my anger. It was shit; the precious vials that we bartered for were nothing but baby shit in salty sugar-water.\n The Island People said that sometimes, with children, the intestinal environment was suitable for the bacteria to breed by themselves.\n And the meaning, which had seemed so mysterious before, resolved itself in my understanding. All that I needed to save the mothers was my own guts, or the guts of the other children, the ones who had no need to drink from the vials because all the bacteria that they needed to break down the poisoned flesh of their prey was inside them.\n The Island People had been laughing at us the whole time. Using us to get metals for them.\n See how you like the wisdom of ants, I thought furiously.\n Long after the men had gone, I made a beaker of sugar-water to re-energize myself before returning, in darkness, to the sea.\n Skink and the two dogs waited for me when I staggered up the beach.\n I didn\u2019t want to look at him. I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. I collapsed on the sand and he built a fire beside me, bringing poison toad, poison croc and poison barramundi.\n \u201cNice swim?\u201d he asked.\n I was saved from having to answer him by the whirring sound of the Island People\u2019s heli. It would land in knee-deep water on the tidal flat.\n They always landed in water.\n \u201cSkink,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen the Island People leave their machine, I want you to fill it with the nests of iron-ants. Nosey and Bloodmuzzle will find them for you.\u201d\n We gazed at one another. Iron-ants were the most plentiful. I hadn\u2019t taken any with me to the Island, because they were the fastest at stripping down steel, and they would have escaped Muhsina\u2019s tanks long before I\u2019d made landfall.\n \u201cYou are a good leader, Rivers-of-Milk,\u201d Skink said, and tears came to my eyes, because he hadn\u2019t noticed that the precious glass bottle was missing from around my neck.\n He leaped to his feet, the dogs at his heels, and ran straight towards the mangroves. I gathered myself, ready to face the two men in their white coats and the two guards with electric prods and teargas that always appeared alongside them.\n Wind from the flying machine made white water on the flat. It took the Island people a long time to find a place they liked the look of and lower the dragonfly\u2019s spindly legs into the water. Then, they inflated a rubber boat, climbed into it and drove it into dry sand, rather than get their trousers wet.\n I waited by the little fire that Skink had made for me. Without turning my head away from their bow wave, I saw Skink pushing a floating piece of bark out towards the machine. It was covered in the broken, pulsating nests of iron ants.\n They were so confident. They were so commanding that they even commanded the full attention of themselves. They didn\u2019t look back.\n \u201cWelcome to Clan territory,\u201d I told them when they came to a halt before me.\n \u201cThe same tree?\u201d one of the white-coated men asked casually.\n \u201cThere will be no trade today. You will stay as our guests.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d one of the guards said, starting to step forward, but the white-coated man was curious and unafraid.\n \u201cGuests for how long?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cPermanent guests,\u201d I said, and the guards, swearing, turned in time to see Skink flinging nests into the open hatch of their heli. They pulled out guns and fired bullets at him, but he dived into the water and swam away.\n They pointed their guns at me, but I laughed in their faces.\n \u201cKill me,\u201d I said, \u201cand the Clan will vanish into the forest. You\u2019ll never find them. You can drink those vials under your coat for a while, but then you\u2019ll die.\u201d\n \u201cAnother helicopter will come from the Island,\u201d the man said, struggling to remain calm.\n \u201cMaybe. Maybe they\u2019ve got ant troubles of their own, on the Island. Come with me, now. We\u2019re going to the caves. There are some women there who will need those vials.\u201d\n \u201cWait,\u201d the second white-coated man said. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. We can\u2019t stay here. Our instruments have detected a big storm approaching. There will be a wave like nothing that you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I said, grimacing, turning away from him. \u201cI know about the wave. Put your weapons down and follow me. We\u2019ll be going through the trees. If you bring any metals, the ants will smell it. They can taste it from very far away, and they\u2019ll come.\u201d\n One of the guards didn\u2019t follow.\n He sloshed back through the water to the flying machine and climbed into the cockpit. I watched him struggle with the controls, twitching while the ants bit him again and again. The motor started and the machine\u2019s mounted wings began to whir.\n In silence, the three that remained watched the heli fly crazily back towards the island.\n \u201cThe protocols,\u201d the white-coated man whispered. \u201cWithout them, they\u2019ll shoot it down.\u201d\n But nobody shot it down.\n \u201cI think they\u2019re busy,\u201d I said.\n The remaining guard put his weapons down shakily.\n Ants were already marching out onto the sand.\n Nosey came to me, hours later, but there was still no sign of Skink.\n \u201cShow me where he is, Nosey,\u201d I said, making the signal for Nosey to find people. The old yellow dog whuffed and skittered off into the mangroves.\n I followed with a sense of dread.\n The Island People had been set to building bark tents and catching toads; I was expecting many more Island People to arrive over the following days and weeks. We would not stay. They would be angry with us. There might be more shootings.\n But the Island People were not like the wireminds. They knew about the local poisons as well as the bacterial remedy, and so long as they brought their children with them, they would not die if left alone. I would let their anger cool in our absence. Maybe, one day, we would make contact with them again.\n Nosey whuffed again, excitedly.\n \u201cSkink!\u201d I shrieked, and ran to my future husband.\n He sat in a bloody puddle of mud, staring into the dead, filmed eyes of an enormous shark that had wriggled its way through the shallow water, desperate to get to him, but then become trapped by the gills in a snarl of stilt-roots.\n \u201cSkink!\u201d I cried again, shaking him by the shoulders. \u201cWhere are you hurt?\u201d\n Skink\u2019s dark eyes gradually focused on me.\n \u201cA bullet went through my leg,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s not bleeding any more.\u201d\n \u201cWhere\u2019s Bloodmuzzle?\u201d\n \u201cInside the shark,\u201d he said.\n He didn\u2019t cry.\n Nosey licked the small leg wound clean, and I helped Skink return to the camp. Once he was settled, I went back to the mangroves with a long shell knife and cut the dead shark open, determined to get my mother\u2019s dog out of its guts.\n Inside its stomach, along with poor Bloodmuzzle\u2019s remains, I found a little black plastic package.\n The totem for the Clan is the shark.\n I held the voice of my mother\u2019s brother in my hand. The vials had brought life back to the dead mothers in the caves. The recorder would bring life back to the whole Clan.\n \u201cI am Rivers-of-Milk,\u201d I said with astonishment to Nosey.\n He tilted his long face to one side.

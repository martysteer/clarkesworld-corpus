He steepled his fingers, regarding me.\n\u201cThe more we have pulling, the faster we get there,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd Bupus has been getting fat and lazy as a tabby cat. No one pays to see a fat manticore.\u201d\n\u201cMore dangerous than any tabby cat,\u201d Rik said.\nI knew what he meant, but I kept a lightning rod at hand in the wagon seat in case of trouble. Bupus knew I\u2019d scorch his greasy whiskers if he crossed me.\nThere is a tacit understanding between a beast trainer and her charges, whether it be great cats, cunning dragons, or apes and other man-like creatures. They know, and the trainer knows, that as long as certain lines aren\u2019t crossed, that if certain expectations are met, everything will be fine and no one will get hurt.\nThat\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t keep an eye on Bupus, watching for a twitch to his tail, the way one bulbous eye would go askew when anger was brewing. A beast\u2019s a beast, after all, and not responsible for what they do when circumstances push them too far. Beasts still, no matter how they speak or smile or woo.\nAt any rate, Bupus felt obliged to maintain his reputation whenever another wagon or traveler was in earshot.\n\u201cGnaw your bones,\u201d he rumbled, rolling a vast oversized eyeball back at me. The woman he was trying to impress shrieked and dropped her chickens, which vanished in a white flutter among the blackberry vines and ferns that began where the road\u2019s ground stone gave way to forest. A blue-headed jay screamed in alarm from a pine.\n\u201cBehave yourself,\u201d I said.\nHe rumbled again, but nothing coherent, just a low, animal sound.\nWe were coming up on Piperville, which sits on a trade hub. Steel figured we\u2019d pitch there for a week, get a little silver sparkling in our coffers, eat well for a few nights.\nIt had been a lean winter and times were hard all over\u2014traveling up from Ponce\u2019s Spring, we\u2019d found slim pickings and audiences too worried about the dust storms to pay any attention to even our best: Laxmi the elephant dancing in pink spangles to \u201cWaltzing Genevieve,\u201d the pyramid of crocodiles that we froze and unfroze each performance via a lens-and-clockwork basilisk, the Unicorn Maiden, and, of course, my manticore.\nRik was driving a wagon full of machinery, packed and protected from the dust with layers of waxed canvas. He pulled up near me, so we were riding in tandem for a bit. No one was coming the opposite way for now. We\u2019d hit some road traffic coming out of Ponce\u2019s, but now it was only occasional, a twice an hour thing at most.\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m looking forward to?\u201d I called over to him.\nHe considered. I watched him thinking in the sunlight, my broad-shouldered and beautiful husband and just the look of him, his long scholar\u2019s nose and silky beard, made me smile.\n\u201cBeer,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd clean sheets. Cleeaaaan sheets.\u201d He drawled out the last words, smiling over at me.\n\u201cA bath,\u201d I said.\nA heartfelt groan so deep it might have come from the bottom of his soul came from him. \u201cOh, a bath. With towels. Thick towels.\u201d\nI was equally enraptured by the thought, so much so that I didn\u2019t notice the wheel working loose. And Bupus, concerned with looking for people to impress, didn\u2019t warn me. With a sideways lurch, the wagon tilted, and the wheel kept going, rolling down the roadway, neat as you please, until it passed Laxmi and she put out her trunk and snagged it.\nI put on my shoes and hopped down to examine the damage. Steel heard the commotion and came back from the front of the train. He rode Beulah, the big white horse that accompanies him in the ring each time. Sometimes we laugh about how attached he is to that horse, but never where he can hear us.\nThe carts and caravans kept passing us. A few waved and Rik waved back. The august clowns were practicing their routine, somersaulting into the dust behind their wagon, then running to catch up with it again. Duga was practicing card tricks while his assistant drove, dividing her attention between the reins and watching him. Duga was notoriously close-mouthed about his methods; I suspected watching might be her only way to learn.\n\u201cWhaddya need?\u201d Steel growled as he reached me.\n\u201cLooks like a linchpin fell out. Could have been a while back. Sparky\u2019ll have a new one, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nHis blue gaze slid skyward, sideways, anywhere to avoid meeting my eyes. \u201cSparky\u2019s gone.\u201d\nIt is an unfortunate fact that circuses are usually made of Family and outsiders\u2014jossers, they call us. Steel treated Family well but was unwilling to extend that courtesy outside the circle. I\u2019d married in, and he was forced to acknowledge me, but Sparky had been a full outsider, and Steel had made his life a misery, maintaining our cranky and antiquidated machines: the fortune teller, the tent-lifter, and Steel\u2019s pride and joy, the spinning cups, packed now on the largest wagon and pulled by Laxmi and three oxen.\nThe position of circus smith had been vacant of Family for a while now, ever since Big Joy fell in love with a fire-eater and left us for the Whistling Piskie\u2014a small, one-ring outfit that worked the coast.\nSo we\u2019d lost Sparky because Steel had scrimped and shorted his wages, not to mention refusing to pay prentice fees when he wanted to take one on. More importantly, we\u2019d lost his little traveling cart, full of tools and scrap and spare linchpins.\n\u201cSo what am I going to do?\u201d I snapped. Bupus had sat down on the road and was eying the passing caravans, more out of curiosity than hunger or desire to menace. \u201cI\u2019ll gnaw your bones,\u201d he said almost conversationally, but it frightened no one in earshot. He sighed and settled his head between his paws, a green snot dribble bubbling from one kitten-sized nostril.\nThe Unicorn Girl pulled up her caravan. She\u2019d been trying to repaint it the night before and there were bleary splotches of green and lavender paint smearing its sides.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u2019 she said loudly. \u201cDriving badly again, Tara?\u201d\nThe Unicorn Girl was one of those souls with no volume control. Sitting next to her in taverns or while driving was painful. She\u2019d bray the same stories over and over again, and was tactless and unkind. I tried to avoid her when I could.\nBut, oh, she pulled them in. That long, narrow, angelic face, the pearly horn emerging from her forehead, and two lush lips, peach-ripe, set like emerging sins beneath the springs of her innocent doe-like eyes.\nEven now, she looked like an angel, but I knew she was just looking for gossip, something she might be able to use to buy favor or twist like a knife when necessary.\nSteel looked back and forth. \u201cBroken wagon, Lily,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can move along.\u201d\nShe dimpled, pursing her lips at him but took up her reins. The two white mares pulling her wagon were daughters of the one he rode, twins with a bad case of the wobbles but which should be good for years more, if you ignored the faint, constant trembling of their front legs. Most people didn\u2019t notice it.\n\u201cShe needs to learn to mind her tongue,\u201d I said.\n\u201cRik needs to come in with us,\u201d Steel said, ignoring my comment. \u201cHe\u2019s the smartest, he knows how to bargain. These little towns have their own customs and laws and it\u2019s too easy to set a foot awry and land ourselves in trouble.\u201d\nMuch as I hated to admit, Steel was right. Rik is the smartest of the lot, and he knows trade law like the back of his hand.\n\u201cI\u2019ll find someone to leave with you, and Rik will ride back with the pin, soon as he can,\u201d Steel said.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. Then, as he started to wheel Beulah around. \u201cSomeone I won\u2019t mind, Steel. Got me?\u201d\n\u201cGot it,\u201d he said, and rode away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like leaving you,\u201d Rik said guiltily. It was a year old story, and its once upon a time had begun on our honeymoon night, with him riding out to help with the funeral of his grandfather, who had been driven into a fatal apoplectic fit by news of his marriage to someone who\u2019d never known circus life.\n\u201cCan\u2019t be helped,\u201d I said crisply. He sighed.\n\u201cTara . . . \u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be helped.\u201d I flapped an arm at him. \u201cGo on, get along, faster you are to town, faster you\u2019re back to me.\u201d\nHe got out of his wagon long enough to kiss me and ruffle my hair.\n\u201cNot long,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave Preddi with you,\u201d Steel said, a quarter hour after I\u2019d watched Rik\u2019s caravan recede into the distance. It had taken a while for the rest of the circus to pass me, wagon after wagon. Even for such a small outfit, we had a lot of wagons.\nPreddi was Rik\u2019s father, a small, stooped man given to carelessness with his dress. He was a kindly man, I think, but difficult to get to know because his deafness distanced him.\nWe pulled the wagon over to the side of the road, in a margined sward thick with yellow loosestrife and dandelions. A narrow deer path led through blackberry tangles and further into the pines, a stream coming through the thick pine needles and chuckling along the rocks. I tied Bupus to the wagon, and brought out a sack of hams and loaves of bread before making several trips in to bring him buckets of water.\nPreddi settled himself on the grass and extracted a deck of greasy cards from the front pocket of his flannel shirt. While I worked, he laid out hand after hand, playing poker with himself, studying it.\nThe day wore on.\nAnd on. I cleaned the wagon tack, and repacked the bundles in it, mainly my training gear. Someone else would be tending my cage of beasts when they pitched camp, and truth be told, anyone could, but I still preferred to be the one who fed the crocodiles, for example, and watched for mouth rot or the white lesions that signal pox virus and cleaned their cage thoroughly enough to make sure no infection could creep in under their scales or into the tender areas around their vents.\nBupus gorged himself and then slept, but roused enough to want to play. I threw the heavy leather ball and each time his tail whipped out with frightening speed and batted it aside. Fat and lazy, he may be, but Bupus has many years left in him. They go four or five decades, and I\u2019d raised him from the shell ten years earlier, before I\u2019d even bought the flimsy paper ticket that led me to meet Rik.\nI hadn\u2019t known what I had at first. A sailor swapped me the egg in return for me covering his bar tab, and who knows who got the best of that bargain? I was a beast trainer for the Duke, and mainly I worked with little animals, trained squirrels and ferrets and marmosets. They juggled and danced, shot tiny plaster pistols, and engaged in duels as exquisite as any courtier\u2019s.\nThe egg was bigger than my doubled fists laid knuckle and palm to knuckle and palm. It was coarse to the touch, as though threads or hairy roots had been laid over the shell and grown into it, and it was a deep yellow, the same yellow that Bupus\u2019s eyes would open into, honey depths around clover-petaled pupils.\nI kept it warm, near the hearth, but could not figure out what it might contain. Months later it hatched\u2014lucky that I was there that day to feed the mewling, squawling hatchling chopped meat and warm milk. I wrapped the sting in padding and leather. Even then it struck out with surprising speed and strength. A manticore is a vulnerable creature, lacking human hands to defend the softness of its face, and the sting compensates for that vulnerability.\nHe talked a moon, perhaps a moon and a half later. I took him with me at first, when I was training the Duke\u2019s creatures, but a marmoset decided to investigate, and I learned then that a manticore\u2019s bite is a death grip, particularly with a marmoset\u2019s delicate bones between its teeth.\nSome beast trainers dull their more intelligent beasts. It\u2019s an easy enough procedure, if you can drug or spell them unconscious. The knife is thin, more like a flattened awl than a blade, and you insert it at the corner of the eye, going behind the eyeball itself. Once you\u2019ve pushed it in to the right depth, perforating the plate of the skull lying behind the eye, you swing back and forth holding it between thumb and forefinger, two cutting arcs. It bruises the eye, leaves it black and tender in the socket for days afterward, but it heals in time.\nIt doesn\u2019t kill their intelligence entirely, but they become simpler. More docile, easier to manage. They don\u2019t scheme or plot escape, and they\u2019re less likely to lash out. Done right, even a dragon can be made clement. And those beasts prone to over-talkativeness\u2014dryads and mermaids, for the most part\u2014can be rendered speechless or close to it.\nI\u2019ve never done that, though my father taught me the technique. I like my talking beasts, most of the time, and on occasion, I\u2019ve had conversation with sphinx or lamia that were as close to talking with a person as could be.\nAfter the marmoset incident, I left Bupus at home, the establishment the Duke allowed me, a fine place with stable and mews and even a heat-room, which the Ducal coal stores kept supplied all winter long and into the chilly Tabatian springs. I kept him in a stall that had been reinforced, and there were other animals to keep him company.\nI\u2019d gone to the circus to see their creatures. They had the crocodiles, which were nothing out of the ordinary, and the elephant, which was also unremarkable, since the Duchess kept two pygmy elephants in her menagerie. And an aging hippogriff, a splendid creature even though its primaries had gone gray with age long ago. I was surprised to see his beak overgrown, as though no one had coped it in months.\n\u201cLook here,\u201d I said to the man standing to watch the cages and make sure no one poked a finger through and lost it. \u201cYour hippogriff is badly tended. See how he rubs his beak along the ground, how he feaks? Your tender is careless, sir.\u201d\nI was full of youth and indignation, but I softened when he perked up and said, \u201cCan you tend them? We lost our fellow. How much would you charge?\u201d\n\u201cNo charge,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you let me look over the hippogriff as thoroughly as I\u2019d like to. I haven\u2019t ever had the chance to get my hands on a live one.\u201d\n\u201cCan you come back later, when we close up?\u201d He looked apologetic. He was a pretty man, and his uniform made him even prettier.\n\u201cI can.\u201d It\u2019d mean a late night, but there was nothing going on that next morning\u2014I could sleep in, and go to check the marmosets in the afternoon, or let the regular assistant do it, even, if I was feeling lazy.\nSo I came back late that night and pushed my way through the crowds eddying out, like a duck swimming against the current. He was waiting for me near the cages. I\u2019d brought my bag of tools, and so we went from cage to cage.\nHe settled the hippogriff when it bated at the sight of me, flapping its wings and rearing upward. It was easily calmed, and he ran his fingers through the silky feathers around its eyes, rubbing softly over the scaly cere, until its eyes half-lidded and it chirped with pleasure, nuzzling its head along his side.\nI trimmed its beak and claws and checked it over before moving on to the other animals. It took me three hours, and even so, much of that was simply telling Rik what would need to be done later on\u2014to stop giving the crocodiles sardines, for example, before they got sick from the oiliness.\nI refused pay, and he insisted that he should buy me a cup of wine, at least. How inevitable was it that I would take this beautiful man home with me?\nIn the morning, I showed my household to my lover. The dueling marmosets, the brace of piskies, the cockatrice kept by itself, lest it strike out in its bad temper. And Bupus, sprawled out across the courtyard. Rik was enchanted.\n\u201cA manticore!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a tamed one. Or a wild one, for that matter. They come from the deserts in the land to the south, you know.\u201d\nA year later, diffidently, while the caravan was spending a month in Tabat, he mentioned to me that the hippogriff had finally succumbed to old age and the caravan would like to buy Bupus.\nI refused to sell, but when I married him, the manticore came with me.\nWhen the sun touched down on the horizon and lingered there, like a marble being rolled back and forth beneath one\u2019s palm, we realized that there was some delay. If not tonight, though, they\u2019d come tomorrow. Preddi and I discussed it all with shrugs and miming, agreeing to build a fire before the last of the sunlight vanished.\nThe woods that run beside the road there are dark and dangerous, which is why travelers stick to the road. As night had approached, there were no more passersby\u2014everyone had found shelter where they could. Preddi and I would spread bedrolls beside the fire and keep watch in turns, but I wasn\u2019t worried much. The smell of a manticore keeps off most predators.\nBut as I picked through the limbs that lay like sutures across the ground\u2019s interwoven needles, a crackling through the dry leaves at the clearing\u2019s edge alerted me. Preddi was near the road, gathering more wood.\nAs I watched I saw stealthy movement. First one, then more, as though the shadows themselves were crawling towards me. As they emerged, crawling out from the crevices beneath logs and the hollows of the trees, I saw a host of leprous, rotting rabbits, their fur blackened with drying blood, their eyes alight with foxfire. I did not know what malign force animated them, but it was clear it meant me no good.\nOut of sight but not earshot, Bupus let out a simultaneous snore and long sonorous fart. Under other circumstances, it would have been funny, but now it only echoed flat and helpless as the rabbits, crouched as low to the ground as though they were snakes, writhed through the dry grasses towards me, their eyes gleaming with moon-touched luminescence.\nThe novelty of the sensation might have been what had me frozen. It was as though my belly were trying to crawl sideways, as though my bones had been stolen without my notice.\nThey were nearly to me, crawling in a sinuous motion, as though their flesh were liquid. Preddi wouldn\u2019t hear me shout. Neither would the snoring Bupus. I strained to scream nonetheless. It seemed unreasonable not to.\nAnd then behind me there was a noise.\nA woman was coming towards me along the deer path, dressed in the onion-skin colored gown of a Palmer, carrying an ancient throwlight. It was made of bronze, and aluminum capped one end, while the other bulged with a glass lens.\nShe thumbed its side and it shed its cold and mechanical light across the leprous rabbits, which recoiled as though a single mass. They smoldered under the unnatural light, withered away into ringlets of oily smoke.\n\u201cI saw your fire from the road,\u201d she said, letting the light play over the last of the rabbits. \u201cThis area is curse-ridden, and I thought you might not know to look out. Light kills them, though.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said shakily. \u201cWill you share our fire?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, as though expecting the invitation. She was a small woman with a head of short, crown-curled hair\u2014slight but with enough weight to give her substance. No jewelry was evident, only the simplicity of her robe, and the worn leather pack on her back, which she tucked her light back into.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a useful thing,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d\n\u201cI found it,\u201d she said before changing the subject. \u201cAre you unharmed? A bite from a curse creature can fester.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get close enough,\u201d I said. \u201cGood timing on your part.\u201d\nBack at the fire, I tried to convey to Preddi that there was danger in the woods. I don\u2019t know if it got through or not. We built the fire up, and stacked the extra wood nearby, settling down to toast bread and cheese on sticks over the fire. Bupus whined for cheese, but it makes him ill, so I gave him chunks of almost-burned toasted bread instead. It\u2019s good for his digestion. He looked reproachful, but crunched them down.\nThe Palmer, whose name turned out to be Lupe, and I talked, Preddi\u2019s gaze moving between us as though he were listening, although when I tried to include him in the conversation, he gave me a blank look. I learned she was traveling from Port Wasp to Piperville, a Palmer, although she did not reveal the purpose of her pilgrimage. Well, that\u2019s a personal thing, and not one everyone shares, so I didn\u2019t push the question.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a beast trainer,\u201d she said, eying me.\n\u201cI am\u2014and my father before him, and his mother before him.\u201d\n\u201cA tradition in your family.\u201d Her eyes glittered in the firelight, malicious jet beads.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDo you pass down lists of what are beasts and what are people?\u201d\nI sighed. One of those. \u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cWe know which are beasts and which people. Beasts cannot overcome their natures and are not responsible for their actions. People can and are. There are four races of people: human, the Snake folk, the Dead beneath Tabat, and Angels, although no one has seen the last in centuries.\u201d\n\u201cBut although beasts are helpless before their natures, should one kill a person, they are killed in turn.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cAny farmer knows that a dog that bites once will bite again. They cannot help it. People can learn, so they can be punished and learn from the experience.\u201d\nShe snorted and spat something fat and wet into the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s no use talking to you,\u201d she said. She turned to Preddi. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d she said.\nHe looked at her blankly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a little deaf,\u201d I said.\n\u201cAh.\u201d She leaned forward and shouted into his ear, putting a hand on his arm to steady herself.\nHe looked at her, surprised. Few of us talked to Preddi\u2014too difficult to stand there loudly repeating a phrase until it penetrated the muffling of his hearing.\nI stood up and went to see to Bupus.\nHe was lying on his back, sprawled out like a tomcat in hot weather. Spittle roped from his gaping mouth and his knobby, chitinous tail twitched in his sleep, its tip glistening with green ichor.\nI checked him over for ticks, parasites, thorns and the like. He grumbled in his sleep, turning over when I thumped him, great flanks shivering as though bitten by invisible flies.\n\u201cGnaw your bones,\u201d he muttered.\nWhen I turned back to the fireside, I froze as deeply as I had with the rabbits. Off in the shadows beneath a sheltering pair of cedars, Preddi and the pilgrim woman were huddled together in his bedroll, moving in rhythm.\nI was appalled on several levels. For one, you don\u2019t want to think about your husband\u2019s father like that. You know what I mean. Plus this woman didn\u2019t seem very pleasant. And this was awfully sudden, so I felt as though I should make sure she didn\u2019t chew off his face or turn out to be some sort of shifter. But above it all, I was irritated at their lack of manners. Was I supposed to act as though they weren\u2019t there on the other side of the fire? I could understand why they hadn\u2019t gone further, worried about the rabbits. But still. Still.\nAfter they settled down, Preddi emerged and signaled he was ready to take his watch. He didn\u2019t look me in the face, nor was I sure what to say. I looked him over and if he\u2019d been enchanted in some way, I couldn\u2019t tell, nor was I sure what the signs of such enchantment might be. So I tried to sleep, but mainly lay awake, wondering what Rik would say when he found out.\nIn the morning, Steel was there.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Rik?\u201d I said, before any other business.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a little trouble,\u201d Steel said.\n\u201cWhat trouble?\u201d\nHe flapped an irritated hand at me. \u201cGet your manticore ready while I fix the axle.\u201d He gave Preddi and the pilgrim a glance.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Lupe, a pilgrim,\u201d I said. \u201cShe saved my life last night.\u201d\nHe grunted and turned to the axle. I roused Bupus to get him into harness, grumbling under my breath.\nPreddi and Lupe walked on one side of the wagon while Steel rode on the other. I drove. Lupe leaned on Preddi as they walked, and I noticed the slight hitch to her gait, as though one leg were shorter than the other.\n\u201cYou can ride with me,\u201d I said, wondering if she\u2019d be able to keep up otherwise. She shook her head, smiling at Preddi. It was a gesture that warmed me to her, despite my fears.\n\u201cWhat happened was this,\u201d Steel said. \u201cLily got two farmers all riled up and throwing insults at each other. They started swinging and then we got fined for disturbing the peace.\u201d\n\u201cFined? How much?\u201d\nHe winced.\n\u201cThat much?\u201d I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any cash to spare.\u201d Rik keeps the books for the circus, and I knew just how thin the financial razor\u2019s edge we danced on was.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Steel said. \u201cThey let me out but kept the others in there. I\u2019m supposed to raise the money. How, I don\u2019t know. Meanwhile, they\u2019re all sitting in jail eating their heads off and adding each day\u2019s room and board to the total.\u201d\n\u201cWe have no extra money,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Lupe said from somewhere behind us. \u201cI could help you.\u201d\nWe both turned to look at her, but Steel said the obvious thing first. \u201cAnd what would you want in return?\u201d\n\u201cA friend\u2019s wagon went into a gorge, two miles ahead. I need someone to go into it and bring out a box of tools that he needs. He\u2019ll come back later to retrieve the wagon itself, but he\u2019s gone ahead to Piperville. I stayed behind to see if I could get help in getting the wagon out, but had no luck. Now I just want to bring him his tools, but I am forbidden to go within walls during my journey.\u201d\nIt was flimsy, it was suspicious. But Palmers are on pilgrimage, and sometimes they act according to their geas. Steel and I exchanged glances, saying the same thing. \u201cNot much choice here.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said.\nWe trudged along in silence for the next mile, except for Lupe, who chattered away to Preddi. She had a trick of touching his arm to let him know she was speaking, to look at her, and he seemed happier than his usual self. I felt guilty\u2014had Preddi been waiting all this time for someone just to talk to? I knew Rik\u2019s mother had died birthing him\u2014that would have been over a quarter of a century ago.\nI kept hearing her voice as we rode, high pitched inconsequentialities, the rush of words that comes from someone who has wanted to speak for a long time.\nIt was easy enough to see where the wagon had gone into the gorge. It was a bad place where the road narrowed\u2014Lupe said her friend had been trying to make room for a larger wagon to pass. The blackberries were torn with its passage down the sloping, rocky side.\nAnd when I climbed down through the brambles, since it was clear Steel had no intention of it, I saw a familiar sight: Sparky\u2019s little wagon, tilted askew.\nHe was not in sight, but I found blood and tracks near the front. Only his tracks, though confused and scattered, as though being pursued.\nHow to play this hand? What was Lupe\u2019s game? I opened the back door of the wagon and peered inside.\nSparky had collected scrap. Iron chains draped the walls, along with lengths of iron and lesser metals: soft copper tubing, a tarnished piece of silver netting. And in the center, his tools in their box. I opened it, trying to figure out why Lupe wanted them. Ordinary tools: screwdrivers, picks, hammers. His father had made them and carved the wooden handles himself, Sparky had told me once.\nWooden handles. I looked down at the tools again, and then at the chain draped walls. Finally I understood. I imagined Sparky being driven from his wagon seat in a cloud of elf-shot, wicked stings that burned, wicked stings that drove him in a mad rush to where he could be safely killed.\nTaking a length of chain from the wall and draping it around my neck, I took the box and clambered up the side of the gorge with its awkward weight below my arm.\nLupe\u2019s fingers twitched with eagerness as she saw it. She and Preddi stood side by side, while Steel watched the road, ready to lead Bupus on a little further if some wagon should need to pass. I went over to him and laid the box between Bupus\u2019 front paws. Touching the manticore\u2019s shoulder, I leaned to whisper in his ear. He looked at me, his eyes unreadable, while Steel glanced sideways, eyebrows forming a puzzled wrinkle.\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Lupe said. Her voice had an odd, droning quality to it.\n\u201cNot until we have the money,\u201d I said.\nShe laughed harshly and I knew deep in my bones I\u2019d been right. I stepped aside, putting my hand on his shoulder. Steel looked between us, bewildered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sparky\u2019s wagon,\u201d I said. \u201cLooks like he was driven away to be killed.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be confused,\u201d she said. \u201cThat wagon belongs to my friend. I don\u2019t know who this Sparky is.\u201d\nI continued, \u201cAnd then she found she couldn\u2019t go in his wagon because of the iron, and yet there they were, wooden handled tools that she could use. You\u2019re some sort of Fay, aren\u2019t you, Lupe?\u201d\nHer black eyes glittered with rage as she stared at me, searching for reply. Preddi looked between us, his face confused. I had no idea what he was making of the conversation, or if he\u2019d actually caught any of it.\nSteel stepped forward, hand on his knife.\n\u201cStay away!\u201d she spat. Her form quivered as she shrank in on herself, her skin wrinkling, folding, until she resembled nothing so much as an immense, papery wasp\u2019s nest, tiny wicked fairies glittering around her in a swarm. A desiccated tuft of brown curls behatted her and she rushed at me and the box in a cloud of fairies.\nBupus\u2019s tail batted her out of the air, neat and quick, and I laid the chain across her throat.\nIt immobilized her. The tiny fairies still darted in and out of her papery form, but they made no move to harm me. Cold iron is deadly to the Fays, even beyond its hampering of their powers.\nI had my own tools in the wagon.\nAnother traveling show paid well for Lupe, enough to get all of our members out of jail. She huddled in the iron cage, quenched and calmed, and the malicious spark had vanished from her eyes. I hoped the dulling had left her with some language. I had not performed the operation in a long time.\nSuprisingly, Preddi chose to go with her. All he said was \u201cShe\u2019s a good companion\u201d but there was no reproach in the words. Rik did not entirely understand why his father was leaving, but he took it well enough.\nIn the evening, I took Bupus down to the stream near our camp for a drink. The full moon rolled overhead like a tipsy yellow balloon. He paced beside me, slow steady footfalls, and as he drank, I combed out his hair with a wooden-toothed comb, removing the road dust from it. When he had drunk his fill, I wiped his face for him.\nThere in the moonlight, he took my wrist in his mouth, pinned between enormous molars as big as pill-bottles. I froze, imagining the teeth crushing down, the bones splintering as he ground at them. Sweat soured my arm-pits but I stood stock still.\nHis lips released my wrist and he nosed at my side, snuggling his head in under my arm. I let go of the breath I had been holding. Tears sprang to my eyes.\nHe rumbled something interrogative, muffled against the skin of my hip. I wound my fingers through his lank, greasy hair.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said.\nI stood for a long time, looking up at the moon. Its face was washed clean by clouds, and stars came out to play around it. After a while, Bupus began to snore.\nCat Rambo lives, writes, and edits from atop a hill in the Pacific Northwest.

It\u2019s my sister\u2019s. Zana is the one who got away, leaving me on this sad little world where we were born. Where I\u2019ll die someday, as the Divine Moya wills. Moya expects us to die, each and every one. That\u2019s her plan for those who still follow the human way.\n We were born fraternal twins, Jix and Zana, separated by thirteen minutes\u2014one of the holy numbers. We were conceived as Moya intended, mother clinging to father, sperm seeking egg. For the first years of our lives, we were close. We danced the moons and prayed the holy numbers and taunted the boys who went to our church. Later we kissed them. Father taught us to bake the cookies that we sold to the upsider tourists from the Thousand Worlds and Mother taught us to mind the money that they paid. Ours was a family of happy wallrats, living just outside the ruins.\n But we began to drift apart in our late teens. Zana had the precise beauty that only Moya can bestow. Her ratios were near the 1.618 of the Divine\u2019s perfection, her curls tight, and her skin had a dark luster, like the midnight of the Jagged Spike. Her high forehead set off molten brown eyes. Zana wore her feelings like a consecration crown for all to see; transparency was part of her attraction. I wasn\u2019t plain, but compared to my sister, my features were commonplace, so I found my own way. While Zana could be shy, especially with strangers, I was forward. While she pondered the right word to say, I let my tongue do the thinking. I didn\u2019t mind what they said about us. Zana the pretty, Jix the witty. Maybe I talked too much for some boys, as Mother used to say, but too much silence made my lips twitch. And I had my share of flings, if not as many as my sister.\n Mother got sick when we were twenty, a year after we were consecrated to Moya. We\u2019d been so busy that season that we missed all the signs. Tourists swarmed the ruins, so that we had no time to bake the extravagant cookies that Father favored. To keep up with demand, our family churned out stacks of Sugardrops, plain but as big as saucers, with just a scatter of raisins or sweetbark to provide interest. These were not our best work, but Zana and I found uses for the extra money they brought us. I was saving for a powerbike and she wanted to learn Anglic.\n Our stall was on the Roundabout, third down from Shellgate, hard against the western wall of the ruins left by the Exotics. Tourists would pause to admire her on their way in, while I sold them our goods. Even though they were all reps who had strayed from the human way, they still had stomachs like the rest of us. An appetite for sweets and an eye for beauty remain locked in our shared genome.\n The day everything changed, a persistent tourist lingered after he\u2019d made his purchase. His companion, a woman from the Institute who was perhaps his minder, was eager to enter the ruins. I\u2019d have been just as happy if she\u2019d led him away, but Zana encouraged conversation. He was handsome enough, in that ageless replicated way, but nobody I\u2019d have wasted breath on.\n He picked up my prayer puzzle while Zana wrapped the cookies. \u201cIngenious.\u201d He manipulated the magnetic triangles of the pentagram to create Moya\u2019s central upright pentangle. \u201cAnd you use this how? As a meditation prompt?\u201d\n \u201cIt predicts how much our customers will buy.\u201d\n \u201cPay no attention to her.\u201d Zana was embarrassed when I tweaked the tourists. \u201cIt\u2019s Moya\u2019s sacred geometry. We use it to pray the numbers.\u201d\n The minder sputtered something in Anglic.\n \u201cPlease\u2014we\u2019re guests on their world.\u201d The tourist scowled at her. \u201cLet\u2019s speak their language.\u201d\n \u201cSanctuary was settled by a sect called the Moyans,\u201d repeated the minder. \u201cFor years they kept the Exotic ruins secret. They believe close contact with us leads to sin.\u201d\n \u201cSin, right,\u201d he said. \u201cI did look through the guide you sent.\u201d He turned to Zana. \u201cAnd the purpose of these . . . \u201d He removed triangles to create the upside-down pentagon.\n \u201cThey remind us of the presence of the Divine,\u201d said Zana. I was surprised when she came around the counter with his purchase. \u201cThat Moya is everywhere.\u201d\n \u201cThe local religion.\u201d The minder harrumphed, \u201cA strain of humanism.\u201d\n The tourist dismissed her with a wave. \u201cPlease, go on.\u201d He clicked puzzle pieces absently into place\u2014another upworlder enchanted by my sister\u2019s beauty.\n \u201cThe Divine\u2019s ratio is the fingerprint of Moya. It teaches us to obey her laws and be true to our mortality.\u201d They exchanged the puzzle for his cookies. For an instant, their hands touched. \u201cWe see it everywhere in her creation. In the spiral of galaxies and in the ancient buildings within those walls.\u201d She nodded toward the Shells, but kept her eyes on his. \u201cThe petals of a flower. Your ear.\u201d She brushed the back of her hand against his ear. \u201cEven your DNA.\u201d Her voice had dropped to a purr. \u201cEverywhere the universe is imprinted with her holy numbers.\u201d\n I couldn\u2019t believe that she was flirting with an upsider. \u201cDid you know,\u201d I said, \u201cthat a DNA molecule measures thirty-four angstroms long by twenty-one angstroms wide for each full cycle of its double helix spiral?\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d he said, although my words meant no more to him than the chitter of streetbots, or the sigh of our awning in the breeze.\n \u201cEight plus thirteen is twenty-one.\u201d I thought praying the holy numbers might distract Zana. \u201cThirteen plus twenty-one is thirty-four. Twenty-one plus thirty-four . . . \u201d\n The guide leaned closer to the rep. \u201cThey worship the Fibonacci sequence.\u201d\n \u201cWe worship the Divine.\u201d Zana\u2019s expression was dreamy. \u201cThe numbers point us toward her handiwork and her expectations of us.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m Quin,\u201d said the tourist. \u201cWhat did you say your name was?\u201d\n \u201cGirls!\u201d\n I\u2019d been so astonished by Zana\u2019s game of seduction that I missed Father hurrying down the Roundabout.\n \u201cTime!\u201d He was out of breath. \u201cIt\u2019s time . . . to close . . . up.\u201d What was so important to bring him from his kitchen at this time of day? And what he\u2019d said made no sense. Close? The afternoon was before us. We had stacks of cookies to sell.\n \u201cSo early?\u201d I said. A bus from the spaceport grunted to a stop. \u201cTake Zana if you need help. She\u2019s not doing anything here.\u201d Tourists fresh from the hotels poured from its open slider.\n \u201cI want you both. Home.\u201d His voice cracked. \u201cNow.\u201d\n Zana hurried back behind the stall to stack unsold cookies into an empty basket.\n \u201cZana, is it?\u201d The tourist leaned over the counter. \u201cZana, before you go, I\u2019d like to ask \u2014\u201d\n \u201cLeave those!\u201d Father swiped at the basket, knocking cookies to the pavement. \u201cLeave everything. We need to go!\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I said. \u201cFather?\u201d\n \u201cYour mother.\u201d He dragged us by the hands past the busy stalls. \u201cYou mother has lost her mind.\u201d Zana stumbled when she glanced back at her dumbstruck tourist, but Father caught her.\n Mother sat at the kitchen table, hair loose, face drawn, hands clasped around a cup of spice tea. She liked it thick and sweet; I still smell its terrible perfume when I remember that day. She stared as if surprised to see us, as if she\u2019d forgotten that she had daughters. Then she said \u201cI\u2019ve just come from the clinic. I have Hrutchma\u2019s.\u201d\n She never cried, not once during that long afternoon. Neither did I. At first Zana threw herself at Mother\u2019s neck, then wept into open hands and eventually rested her head on the kitchen table, shoulders heaving. Father\u2019s tears were hot; only later did we realize what was behind them.\n Hrutchma\u2019s was a disease we knew well. It caused something called lymphoid hyperplasia, a crazy increase of cells in the lymph nodes. Hrutchma\u2019s began with enlarged nodes in the chest, squeezing the lungs and stealing the breath. I\u2019d noticed her getting winded, although she\u2019d joked it was because Father\u2019s cookies were making her fat. As the disease progressed, it would wreck her immune system, leading to nerve damage, infections, withering fevers. That\u2019s how Grandmother Deel, Father\u2019s mother, had died\u2014raving while she burned like a fast oven. According to the medical encyclopedia on the tell, Hrutchma\u2019s is unique to Sanctuary. Some wallrats whispered that it came from a curse the Exotics placed on the old stones, but we couldn\u2019t let that rumor spread. Tourists put the soup in our bowls.\n I remember sinking into a chair across from Mother, trying to imagine how I would fit into a world without her. I couldn\u2019t, in part because I was too numb, in part because I was distracted by Zana. She settled beside me, sobbing and I felt guilty that I couldn\u2019t summon tears. And then I was puzzled by the way Father hung back. I expected that he\u2019d be grieving too. But no\u2014he seemed angry.\n Zana saw it too. \u201cFather, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n \u201cHer.\u201d He choked on a laugh. \u201cShe is.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s sick!\u201d Zana swiped at her wet face. \u201cWhat\u2014you blame her?\u201d I wonder now if she had guessed what was coming. She knew Mother better than I.\n \u201cHrutchma\u2019s I can accept.\u201d He shook his head in disgust. \u201cThe other, no.\u201d\n \u201cYou can accept that I\u2019ll die?\u201d Mother\u2019s voice was sharp as a slap. \u201cI\u2019m forty-one years old.\u201d\n \u201cI accept the will of the Divine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should do the same. Our daughters are consecrated to Moya.\u201d\n She turned from him to face us. \u201cYour father doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d She met our gaze without hesitation or regret. \u201cI\u2019m going to Skytown.\u201d\n \u201cTo live.\u201d Father said it like an accusation, but she ignored him. \u201cGo ahead, lie down with their machines. Betray everything we believe. Just remember\u2014never come back to us.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to upload,\u201d said Zana. \u201cBecome a rep.\u201d\n Mother shivered as if Zana had said something that she hadn\u2019t yet realized. Then she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to die.\u201d\n She left the next day.\n Father never spoke of her again. If anyone dared mention her, he\u2019d withdraw, sometimes for days. He was a fool to think that his silence could erase her from our lives. All of our communion knew the shame she\u2019d brought on our family and our church. Whenever Speaker Elb preached about straying from Moya\u2019s way, of losing our humanity, everyone thought of her. I know I did. For months afterward, I was obsessed with her. I had nightmares about her ravaged and discarded body\u2014where was it now? And what to make of the stranger who knew everything about our home, our family\u2014about me? We\u2019d been taught there was no real continuity of life between a human and the rep body created by the technology of the Thousand Worlds. The Divine taught that my mother was truly dead. But then who was the creature who lived in Skytown, the upsiders\u2019 enclave on Sanctuary? Who still claimed to love me?\n I knew this because she tried to stay in contact with us, or at least with Zana and me. Zana showed me her first message, but I couldn\u2019t finish reading it. However, Zana wrote back, despite Speaker Elb\u2019s warning that our false mother would tempt her to sin. I had no idea how often they talked because I didn\u2019t want to know. However, my sister insisted on telling me how she was doing.\n After her replication, Mother had found work as a janitor at the Institute of Exotic Archeology. She shared an apartment with three other roommates including her old friend Xeni Bluereed, who had left our communion three years ago to be replicated. Zana claimed there was a growing community of people like Mother and Xeni beginning new lives among the upsiders. Later, she got a job in a Skytown restaurant as a cook, which was ironic because the kitchen had always been Father\u2019s domain. Mother\u2019s new position paid well and I suspect that she sent Zana some of her wages, although I never saw any. But apparently Mother had money enough to visit the orbital and to buy a bot. She thought about us all the time, according to Zana, and yet supposedly she was happy. Although I envied her the luxuries of Skytown, I couldn\u2019t imagine how that could be.\n Moya does not demand that we reject all upsider technologies, only those which make us less human. Yes, I\u2019d own a bot and a printer and a car if I could afford them. I\u2019d sample the drugs that make you stronger or smarter or happier. But Sanctuary is an exhausted world. That\u2019s why our ancestors were able to claim it for the Divine. The Exotics had used Sanctuary up long ago, and their leavings are the last valuable things on it. We scratch a living from their dust. And while we\u2019re proud of our ruins, there are other examples of the Exotics\u2019 architecture scattered throughout the galaxy.\n As the months passed, our broken family adjusted to our new life. The press of tourists varied with the seasons, but we did well enough, especially now that there were only three of us. I bought my powerbike and a trailer to go with it. Not only did Zana get her Anglic lessons, she then paid for access to the Institute\u2019s databanks, so that she could learn more about the Thousand Worlds. Her new language skills paid off in an unexpected way. Word spread through the hotels of the beautiful girl selling baked goods who could speak the common tongue. Tourists flocked to witness this marvel. They helped Zana with her accent until they claimed she could announce the news on Ravi\u2019s Prize itself\u2014not that either of us believed that. Of course, I understood not a word of their chatter, and when they dissolved into laughter I suspected that the joke was on me.\n Then Quin came back. Except, as it turned out, he\u2019d never left.\n I was alone at the stall, which meant that, for a change, my view of the street wasn\u2019t blocked by Zana\u2019s admirers when I spotted Quin wandering along the Roundabout. It had been almost half a year, but I knew him as soon as I saw him. He paused at Twial\u2019s stall, picked up a reproduction of Half Boat to check the price and then replaced it with a frown. He browsed Glif\u2019s gaudy umbrellas and the new scent store, then walked faster as he got closer. He passed our stall with eyes down, as if scanning for cracks on the pavement. It was obvious that he was ignoring me. But then he stopped abruptly in the middle of the street, glanced past me to the blackened hulk of the Jagged Spike, and strode up to the counter.\n \u201cYou\u2019re Jix.\u201d He tried on a smile that didn\u2019t quite fit.\n I agreed that I was.\n He reached for our most expensive cookie. \u201cAnd this is a Brownbutter Velvet Block.\u201d\n \u201cWith a ginger smear.\u201d\n \u201cCut into a precise rectangle.\u201d He held it to the light to examine it. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying your religion. Would I be right to say that the ratio of the length to the width is 1.618?\u201d He seemed proud of himself for this guess.\n \u201cI recommend that you buy at least two.\u201d\n This wasn\u2019t the reply he\u2019d been expecting. He nodded, frowning.\n \u201cWill there be something else?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cI know your mother. She used to work at the Institute.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d I wrapped two Velvet Blocks in takeout paper. \u201cDid she send you?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d He was surprised at the question. \u201cI\u2019m an archeologist, doing research on your Shells.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re not mine.\u201d I supposed he wanted me to ask about Mother. I handed him his purchase. \u201cThree-fifty.\u201d\n Instead of completing the transaction using our tell like every other tourist, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of Moyan chits.\n \u201cI like your money.\u201d He fumbled for the exact change. \u201cThere\u2019s so much of it.\u201d\n \u201cI like it too.\u201d I rarely handled chits at the stall; only Moyans carry them and Moyans bake their own cookies. He watched me slip them into my pocket. Then I gave him his purchase and waited. He made no move to leave. I remembered then how he had lingered that awful day. \u201cMaybe you were expecting to find someone else here?\u201d\n \u201cZana, yes.\u201d He blinked. \u201cBut I had no expectations.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. Expectations are what get me through the day.\u201d I spotted Zana headed up the street carrying a basket of cookies from home. \u201cI like to guess what will happen next.\u201d\n \u201cYou had a prayer puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cMay I see it?\u201d\n Surprised that he remembered, I opened my bag and offered it to him.\n \u201cYes.\u201d He pushed the magnetized shapes into new configurations with practiced motions. \u201cIt\u2019s very definite, your religion. Did you know that the star polygon is one of the oldest symbols we have. From Earth, you know, the home world. It represented the sacred feminine as long ago as 4000 BCE.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d Of course he would condescend to a nobody; he was a tourist. Was common courtesy a trait that the upsiders\u2019 technology couldn\u2019t replicate?\n \u201cSo the so-called Golden Ratio . . . \u201d He was oblivious. \u201cA fascinating mix of tradition and math. Take this pentagon and connect the vertices and you get a pentagram, a five sided star.\u201d He pushed puzzle pieces. \u201cFive is in the Fibonacci sequence. And the ratio of any diagonal of the star to any side of the pentagon is 1.618. Phi, the Golden Ratio. And you see it again here . . . . \u201d He fitted pieces into new configurations. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He drew a line with his forefinger; his nails clicked against the metal. \u201cAnd you were saying how often the Golden Ratio occurs in the natural world. There\u2019s actually support for that in the literature.\u201d\n \u201cWe call it the Divine\u2019s Ratio,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it was actually my sister who was explaining that. Isn\u2019t that right, Zana?\u201d\n Quin started as she set her basket on the counter.\n \u201cYou remember Quin,\u201d I said to her. \u201cTurns out he\u2019s from the Institute. An archeologist. And he knows Mother.\u201d\n The looks they exchanged were not those of strangers.\n \u201cSo this isn\u2019t news to you?\u201d I reached for the basket to sort the new cookies she\u2019d brought. \u201cAre we keeping secrets now, sister?\u201d\n \u201cOh, no secret,\u201d said Quin. \u201cWe started exchanging messages what . . . ? Three months ago. I\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve become friends.\u201d\n \u201cJust over two months.\u201d Zana was embarrassed. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve only met in person a couple of times.\u201d\n \u201cWhich is why I thought to surprise you.\u201d Quin seemed pleased with himself.\n \u201cAnd did he tell you that he\u2019s been studying our religion?\u201d I replenished our supply of Shortbread Swaddled Truffles. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re thinking of converting, Quin?\u201d I wanted to see her squirm for keeping this from me.\n \u201cNo.\u201d He set my prayer puzzle down as if it might burn him. \u201cNot at all.\u201d\n \u201cIt would be awkward, seeing as how you\u2019re no longer in your first body. How many times have you been replicated, if you don\u2019t mind my asking?\n \u201cHe does mind.\u201d Zana\u2019s cheeks colored. \u201cThat\u2019s rude, Jix.\u201d\n \u201cOh, sorry.\u201d I bowed twice for good measure. \u201cSorry, Quin. It\u2019s just that we get so few of your people taking an interest in us.\u201d\n Quin blinked at us, as if he was having trouble following our conversation. \u201cIn any event,\u201d he said to Zana, \u201cI was just wondering when . . . if maybe . . . would you like to take that tour sometime? The one we were talking about.\u201d\n \u201cTour?\u201d I said.\n He glanced at me then nodded toward Shellgate. \u201cI know you\u2019ve lived here all your lives, but I have access to the monuments, even those that are closed. I could show you things that very few people have seen.\u201d\n Zana shot me a stare that said I wasn\u2019t invited. I let it bounce off me.\n \u201cZana and I are working girls,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have tourists to feed, cookies to sell.\u201d\n He nodded. \u201cShellgate closes at five. Don\u2019t all the tourists leave for the hotels then? We could go after hours; I have unlimited access, you know. It stays light until almost eight.\u201d\n \u201cGreat.\u201d I held up the empty cookie basket and smiled at him. \u201cWe could pack a picnic dinner.\u201d\n Zana wasn\u2019t amused.\n \u201cFather would explode if he knew you were seeing a rep.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not seeing him.\u201d Zana was a darkness on the shadowy bed across the room. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend, that\u2019s all. And it\u2019s all been messaging until recently.\u201d\n \u201cExcept now you\u2019re making dates to tour the ruins.\u201d\n It was always sweltering in our house because of the ovens, even late at night after Father shut them down. In the summer Zana and I would sprawl on our beds, sweat prickling our skin. Most nights we kicked the sheets off, sometimes it was too hot for clothes. Unable to sleep, we\u2019d talk of boys and dreams in the dank gloom, our conversation flickering like a candle.\n \u201cHe\u2019s going to show you things nobody has seen.\u201d I chuckled. \u201cWhere have I heard that joke before? He\u2019s the tourist and you\u2019re the baker\u2019s beautiful daughter.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is. Besides, now you\u2019re coming too, even though nobody asked you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m only going to make sure that you don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d We never kept our flings a secret from one another, so this Quin worried me. \u201cOkay, so maybe he\u2019s not a tourist, but he\u2019s not here to stay.\u201d Zana was my twin, and even if we weren\u2019t playmates anymore, she was the only one in our family I was close to. The silence was tickled by the scratch of slinks running up the walls and across the floor. In the warm weather the lizards stayed active at night, scavenging for crumbs and squeezing into the chinks in our stone walls.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t think I can handle him?\u201d said Zana. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-one years old.\u201d\n \u201cAnd he\u2019s two hundred years old. Or maybe two thousand.\u201d\n \u201cOh, stop it.\u201d\n \u201cHe works for the Institute, Zana. You go squirting through wormholes for a living, you\u2019ve got to allow for time dilation. People like him replicate what . . . ? Five, six times at least.\u201d\n I heard her torturing her pillow into a new shape, but neither of us found much comfort that night.\n \u201cHe\u2019s definitely got a look,\u201d I said. \u201cI understand the attraction.\u201d\n The slats beneath her mattress creaked when she sat up. \u201cYou know the problem with living at home?\u201d She was silhouetted against the window, her bare back to me. \u201cI can never get away from you two.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not fair. When you bring a boy home, don\u2019t I give you the room? Just like when I was with Bibby, you got scarce. And Father hasn\u2019t a clue who we\u2019ve had in here.\u201d\n Silence.\n \u201cI watch for you and you watch for me, remember? That\u2019s what sisters do.\u201d\n She gave an unhappy grumble.\n \u201cBut if sex is what you want, why not fuck a human? Moya knows, you can have your choice.\u201d\n I ducked as her pillow sailed across the room.\n We didn\u2019t pack cookies for the picnic. When you bake for a living, you lose the taste. Instead we brought salted cutthroat from the river and pickled figs. A cold squash soup. A round of cheese and a bottle of fay brandy. Quin insisted on carrying it at first, even though Zana and I had spent most of our lives lugging heavy baskets of fruit and flour and oils and spices.\n I couldn\u2019t help but envy the way the tell built into his fingernail synced with the Institute\u2019s security at Shellgate. A wave of his hand, and the projectors went dark; as soon as we passed through, solid blue light once again barred the entryway. I\u2019d never seen communication tech that small. For a moment, Quin seemed magical.\n The ruins were part of our neighborhood, even though they were run by the Institute. We were threading our way around broken buildings back when we were toddlers. But that night, it was as if we\u2019d stepped from Sanctuary onto one of the Thousand Worlds. We knew the structures by the names the first settlers had given them, but Quin identified the Grandmother Stones as Boundary Markers 11n through 11t. He explained that Half Boat and the Jagged Spike were part of a complex he called the Western Quadrant Early Classic Superstructure. When we insisted that Ellipsoidal Buildings 43, 58, and 70 were properly Bird Shell, Crazy Shell and the Bride, he chuckled. Giving commonplace names was how people coped with their terror of the alien, he claimed. A way of pretending we understood the civilization of the mighty Exotics.\n He had a talent for annoying me. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, \u201cassigning them numbers is your way of coping.\u201d\n Zana shot me a look but Quin nodded, as if considering what I\u2019d said. \u201cYou may be right. Numbering the world is what we humans do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d We were standing on a parapet called Frost\u2019s Overlook, gazing down at the three Shells. \u201cThey\u2019re not buildings, you know. They\u2019re sculptures.\u201d\n \u201cSculptures?\u201d I said. \u201cOf what?\u201d\n \u201cWe see similar construction in several other ruins. I stopped at Destination and Kenning before I came here. I\u2019m certain that your Shells were never occupied. Nor were they even functional. My research leads me to the idea that they\u2019re propaganda art on a monumental scale, like Ravi\u2019s Tomb or the Lubinarium.\u201d\n \u201cThe Statue of Liberty on Earth,\u201d said Zana. This took me by surprise. Why was she learning trivia about that dead planet?\n \u201cNot familiar with that one.\u201d Quin hefted the picnic basket. \u201cMost scholars claim that Ellipsoidal Sculptures are Post Classic, but I believe they\u2019re actually from the end of the Persistent Era, just before the last of the Exotics disappeared.\u201d\n \u201cSculptures of what?\u201d I repeated. \u201cAnd what kind of propaganda?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve heard that\u2019s a particularly interesting view.\u201d He aimed his chin at the opening at the top of the Bride. \u201cEat up there?\u201d\n As we scuttled down the rubble-strewn grade, he told us about his work. Nobody knew what had become of the Exotics. The galaxy-wide culture that built the wormholes vanished between fifty and sixty thousand years ago. Judging from their enigmatic ruins, Exotic civilization had begun to hollow out in its Post Classic Era, which was followed by the long decline of the Persistent Era. Quin believed that Sanctuary\u2019s shells might have been among the last things the Exotics ever built.\n The wind had died in the dusk and the sun-baked fa\u00e7ade of the Crazy Shell radiated heat as we passed on the way to the Bride. \u201cI think these shells were meant to persuade the Persistents who remained behind to follow their ancestors.\u201d Quin set the basket down on the stump of a pillar and wiped sweat from his eyes. \u201cMaybe to shame them into it because Exotic culture had moved on. What were they waiting for?\u201d He\u2019d been talking non-stop and was out of breath.\n I was enjoying the effect our summer heat had on this overconfident upsider. \u201cThis is the theory that says they all uploaded and went to where? Exotic toyland?\u201d\n \u201cThe evidence does point to a massive departure over a very short time, with a longer period of stragglers hanging on. Some claim there was a mass suicide but yes, I\u2019d like to think they went elsewhere. Maybe to somewhere else in our universe or to some designed reality.\u201d\n Zana hefted the picnic basket. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone could get bored sailing through wormholes.\u201d\n He pretended not to notice that she was relieving him. \u201cNot sure they got bored. One thing is certain, they were very tidy. They took great pains to erase themselves from their worlds.\u201d He tugged at his shirt where it had stuck to his chest. \u201cAll their ruins are built of native materials, mostly stone and ceramics. Some metals. We\u2019re pretty sure that no Exotics lived in them, but then we have no idea where they did live. We know nothing of what they looked like, their biology, what they believed. Were these structures ceremonial? Administrative? Religious?\u201d\n \u201cAnd this bothers you?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s not fair to archeologists?\u201d\n \u201cThey might\u2019ve done better by us.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019d like to think there are answers out there, but maybe I\u2019m just fooling myself.\u201d\n Father said that before the Institute took over the ruins, Moyans had tried to clean them up: restacking stones, filling holes, pulling weeds, and cutting brush. The upsiders had stopped all reconstruction and limited public access to a handful of the structures. They said it was to preserve the archeological record; wallrats said it was to drive customers away. Whatever the truth, navigating the ruins was a challenge. The footing was uncertain, and the direct path to any given destination was often blocked.\n \u201cSo what does Moya . . . \u201d Quin was laboring again as we reached the base of the Bride. \u201c . . . have to say . . . to all of this?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to know Moya\u2019s mind.\u201d Zana vaulted onto the fallen slab in front of the crude entrance someone had chiseled into the Bride.\n \u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the Exotics knew the Divine\u2019s ratio.\u201d\n \u201cDid they?\u201d\n \u201cJust look.\u201d I gestured at the white whorls carved into the casing stones on the wall above us.\n \u201cI suppose.\u201d He gathered himself for the scramble. \u201cIt\u2019s math, after all. But you Moyans . . . you see your ratio everywhere.\u201d\n I offered a hand to help him up. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d\n He reached for me and missed. \u201cI lack your stamina.\u201d I caught his damp wrist and boosted him to my side.\n After he\u2019d caught his breath, Quin insisted on telling us that the white limestone fa\u00e7ade of the Bride had been quarried from Kunlun\u2019s Crease, even though everyone knew this. The Bride resembled the Ivory Snails some wallrats harvested from the river for soup. The ones that tasted like dirty socks. The difference was that the Bride was enormous\u2014some thirty meters tall\u2014and was upside down. The mouth of the shell pointed up at the sky. We ducked through the makeshift entrance into the interior. The air was dank here and smelled like the inside of a well. A wooden scaffold climbed to the light. We crunched across a floor littered with broken tiles that had fallen off the walls, each decorated with a tessellated spiral flower pattern. Some wallrats believed that if you found an intact tile, whoever you gave it to would fall in love with you. Unfortunately, undamaged tiles were hard to come by since the ban on removing artifacts from the ruins. However, the Naras did a brisk trade in reproductions from their stall near Rivergate.\n I bent to retrieve a shard and showed it to Quin. It was hard to see detail in the feeble light from the opening above us, so he lit his fingernail.\n \u201cThe Divine\u2019s ratio.\u201d I traced several shapes. \u201cIn case you\u2019re still in doubt about what the Exotics knew.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d He waved his nail off. \u201cThat claim has been made. But it\u2019s not quite 1.618, is it?\u201d\n I bristled and let it fall to the floor. \u201cSo close you can hardly tell the difference.\u201d\n \u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially in the dark.\u201d\n \u201cQuin likes to scoff,\u201d said Zana. \u201cBest to ignore him when he gets like that.\u201d\n \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cYour sister has been teaching me manners, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not much of a student.\u201d\n I prayed the numbers while we climbed to calm myself. One, one, two, three, five, eight, thirteen, twenty-one, thirty-four, fifty-five . . . . By the time I got to seventeen thousand, seven hundred and eleven I was feeling more like myself. Quin heaved himself up the first two ladders in succession, but after that he had to rest on each platform. He took longer to recover the higher we went until he collapsed onto the tenth stage, gasping and as damp as if we had pulled him from the river. The planking was slick with mildew from exposure to the weather and left a smudge on Quin\u2019s pants. Zana worried over him, but he reassured us that he was exhausted only because his last replication had been on a world where the gravity was 0.68 that of Sanctuary. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not good with heights,\u201d he added.\n He revived once we climbed the last ladder to the wide stone lip at the top of the Shell. While Zana sat him down so the two of them could unpack our meal, I walked out to the edge and the view. It had been years since I\u2019d made this climb. The shadowy ruins sprawled at my feet while the lights of our little village twinkled in the middle distance. Skytown was a glow on the horizon. Although the air was warmer up here, it was a relief from the sticky interior of the Bride. I took a deep breath and felt blessed to be able to take in my whole world at a glance.\n Zana was murmuring to Quin. I couldn\u2019t make out what she was saying, but there was a note to her voice, at once innocent and earnest and tender, that made me shudder.\n What if this was more than a fling?\n Quin thought the cutthroat tasted too fishy but he raved about the pickled figs and asked to take a sample of Father\u2019s squash soup for gastronomical analysis. He said the cheese was better than the framenthakler that the data monks on Encyclopedia printed from their secret recipe. We talked a lot about food. Zana pumped him for his favorite dishes but I knew she was more interested in hearing stories about the Thousand Worlds than she was learning about upsider cooking. He said that most reps preferred printed food, of which there was an infinite variety. Those who traveled the wormholes took little interest in local culture, but were passionately invested in trying the latest cuisines.\n \u201cNobody much cares about books and songs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat sells on the upside are new menus.\u201d He waved our brandy bottle at the sky. \u201cCome up with a fresh taste with a new smell and you can write your own ticket to the stars.\u201d When he offered me a refill, I covered my cup with my hand. \u201cTake your cookies, for example. With the right marketing, they might pay your way off Sanctuary.\u201d\n I waited for Zana to point out that we had no plans to leave home. She didn\u2019t, so neither did I.\n I expected Quin would continue to do most of the talking, but he wanted to hear about us, or at least Zana. He asked about our schools and what we\u2019d been told about the upside. Zana talked about what she\u2019d learned using the Institute\u2019s portal; he said it had good access but was by no means complete. He wondered what we thought about the controversies that flared continually between the wallrats and the Institute over management of the ruins. Then he got us telling stories about dumb things that tourists did.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they need to haggle,\u201d I said, \u201cafter what they spend to get here. We\u2019d have to move a mountain of cookies just to get to the orbital.\u201d\n \u201cSo we let them talk our prices down . . . \u201d Zana giggled, \u201c . . . and we then make up the difference in tax.\u201d\n \u201cOnly there is no tax.\u201d\n \u201cSure there is,\u201d I said. \u201cStupidity tax.\u201d\n We were all laughing now as Zana filled our cups with the last of the brandy.\n \u201cThen there was that buzzy woman who wanted to buy all our takeout paper. Where was she from?\u201d\n \u201cShe said it tasted better than our cookies.\u201d\n \u201cAnd then they ask the dumbest questions about the Divine\u2019s ratio.\u201d\n That earned me a sisterly glare until Quin raised his hand. \u201cGuilty.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t want to start liking him, so I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in the Divine, do you?\u201d\n When Zana hissed, it sounded like a seam ripping.\n \u201cYou know I don\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n Nobody was laughing now.\n \u201cOr any god,\u201d I said.\n Quin studied me. His silence was scary.\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cJix!\u201d Zana came to her knees, but I knew she wanted to hear his answer.\n \u201cHave you ever heard of the God spot, Jix?\u201d said Quin.\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Zana said, as if to end the conversation.\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cPeople used to look for the place in our brains where mystical experiences come from. Some tagged the right parietal lobe, others the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There was evidence that N,N-dimethyltryptamine levels in the pineal gland play a role. But over time they realized they\u2019d got it wrong, and so they developed a different model. There\u2019s no button in the brain that you push for instant spirituality. The neural correlates are scattered across the entire brain, systems that give rise to self-awareness, emotion, your sense of your own body.\u201d He fumbled at the pocket of the shirt he was wearing. \u201cAnd what\u2019s interesting is that in order to have a religious experience, you don\u2019t stimulate these brain systems.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou suppress them. Inhibit those areas that create the illusion of self, and you open the door to transcendence.\u201d\n \u201cSo?\u201d I said.\n He pulled a pressure syringe from his pocket and showed it to us. \u201cWant to see Moya?\u201d\n Sometimes I wonder if Zana had poured our futures from a bottle of fay brandy. How could two drunken sisters hope to protect one another? Or maybe I was daring my sister even as she was daring me in some alcohol-fueled dance of sibling rivalry? Or it was simply that we each were trying to impress her upsider, in our own ways and for our own reasons?\n The syringe looked like a glass thumb, cylindrical but with a flat applicator pad to one side. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long.\u201d Quin pressed the syringe to the artery in Zana\u2019s neck. \u201cSay fifteen minutes to work past the blood-brain barrier.\u201d The syringe left a faint pink swelling. \u201cThe actual experience comes and goes. Maybe five minutes, although it might feel longer subjectively.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s different. Some people feel like they\u2019ve disappeared, some become one with everything.\u201d\n I tilted my head. \u201cAnd is it real?\u201d The injection felt like being kissed on the neck.\n He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s for you to decide.\u201d He injected himself last, then tucked the syringe back into his pocket.\n \u201cYou planned this,\u201d said Zana.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it,\u201d he said, \u201chaven\u2019t we?\u201d\n \u201cI never said yes.\u201d\n He smirked. \u201cYou just did.\u201d\n \u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d I said.\n He sat on the stone pavers facing the view and crossed his legs. \u201cWe wait for the elevator.\u201d\n We arranged ourselves into a triangle and watched each other for signs. Zana settled back onto her heels. Her back was straight and she sniffed, nose pointed, as if she might catch Moya\u2019s scent. I squirmed on the cold, hard floor. The silence made me more self-conscious, not less. Was my heart in the right place? Would this change my life? What was I supposed to do with my hands?\n Quin seemed to be enjoying himself. \u201cI never asked you about boyfriends,\u201d he said to distract us. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you both have plenty.\u201d\n \u201cZana does.\u201d I was relieved to hear the sound of my own voice. \u201cShe gets her share and half of mine.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d She frowned. \u201cYou do well enough.\u201d\n \u201cThey say I talk too much.\u201d\n \u201cBoneheads.\u201d He patted my arm. \u201cStick with men as smart as you.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you?\u201d said Zana. \u201cYou have people you care about?\u201d\n \u201cYes and no.\u201d He paused, deciding how much to say. \u201cWhen you get replicated, relationships sometimes fall apart. You\u2019re you, but now you\u2019re somebody else as well. The body is different for one thing, sometimes very different. It wants what it wants. That old you, he\u2019s like someone you read about. It was a really interesting book, and you remember vivid scenes, but you\u2019ve read that last page.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d I asked. \u201cBeing replicated.\u201d\n \u201cLike dying, only you wake up afterwards.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve died?\u201d I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but I was.\n \u201cEvery time,\u201d he said, as if he was discussing a splinter. \u201cOf course in a direct transfer you\u2019re not dead very long. But these days they can still rep someone thirty minutes after cardiac and respiratory arrest with minimal information loss. After thirty, the brain really deteriorates. Something about ischemic injury.\u201d He shivered in the heat. \u201cSo yes, Zana knows this already but I was in a flier crash that killed me just before I came here. Nobody\u2019s fault, really. I was with someone I loved, but he didn\u2019t make it. Rescue took too long to get to us. They say my rep was only ninety-six percent accurate. It was very sad, because I\u2019d probably still be with him if his replication had been successful too.\u201d\n Zana took his hand in hers.\n \u201cSo I\u2019m still learning to be this new Quin in this new body.\u201d His mouth smiled, but his eyes were sad. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we all do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n When I saw that look on my sister\u2019s face, one I\u2019d never seen before, I knew that I\u2019d been right to worry about this upsider. The love she felt for him glimmered from her perfect ratios, Moya\u2019s gifts to her. The length of Zana\u2019s face divided by its width. 1.618. Her smile divided by the width of her nose. 1.618. The width of her nose to the space between her nostrils. 1.618.\n I was so focused on my sister that I didn\u2019t realize Quin was still talking until he said, \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d\n Zana shut her eyes. Was it imagination that they were so tight that they quivered? When she opened them she was staring at nobody, and 1.618 was Divinely revealed in the width of her eye divided by the width of her iris.\n \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She stood\u2014to get away from her lover? Or from Moya, who had made her in her image and likeness? The Divine was the reason that her height was 1.618 of the distance between her beautiful navel and her flawless hair. The holy numbers began praying themselves, one plus one sisters, two sisters, three, five, eight . . .\n Quin struggled to his feet and caught her in an embrace, spouting a stream of ardent and unintelligible Anglic. She replied in kind, only her voice was in ruins. More Anglic nonsense and more and then they were shouting. The argument made her so angry that she pulled away from him. His arm dangled and he shook it as if it had fallen asleep but it was too long, too long, his proportions were all wrong. When his fingers curled into a fist, that one nail glowed a sleepy, magical purple.\n Nobody said, \u201cSpeak Moyan!\u201d\n Zana heard. \u201cI do want that, yes, all of it, but I can\u2019t.\u201d She was crying. \u201cIt\u2019s a sin. And how can I leave them?\u201d\n \u201cThey can come too,\u201d Quin said. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for the replication.\u201d\n \u201cRep Father?\u201d Her laugh turned sour, and her mouth twisted, and her ratios skewed. \u201cI love you, Quin, but . . . \u201d\n Love, the voice said to nobody. Thirteen, twenty-one, thirty-four. She loves him.\n \u201cJix, what are you doing?\u201d The upsider wasn\u2019t condescending now. \u201cGet away from her, Jix.\u201d Who was he talking to?\n The voice was as cruel as stone, as sad as the wind. Fifty-five, eighty-nine, one hundred and forty-four.\n \u201cStop.\u201d Zana tried to twist away, but she wasn\u2019t fast enough. \u201cNo!\u201d\n And then she was falling, perfect arms flailing, scream slashing the night. On her way to the Thousand Worlds. The truth is that nobody pushed Zana Ferenc to her death from the stone lip of the Bride.\n \u201cCall rescue now,\u201d said nobody. \u201cYou only have half an hour.\u201d\n I hadn\u2019t expected Mother to be beautiful. She was an only child but the rep they\u2019d given her looked like some younger, sunnier sister. She reminded me of my own sister, the one I no longer had according to Father. She stood aside and smiled me into her apartment. The room felt deliciously cool after the hike from the church, like cannonballing into the river on a summer afternoon. This must be the air-conditioning we\u2019d heard about.\n There were no real windows but the entire rear wall was a live image of the ruins as seen from Kai\u2019s Chair. Our village peeked from the far corner.\n \u201cXeni and the others are out,\u201d said Mother. \u201cIt\u2019s just us.\u201d\n \u201cXeni,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s your roommate, right?\u201d I paused in the center of what was apparently just a sitting room. Two doors to my left, one to my right, the hall behind. Walls as blue as an egg. Mysterious light from the ceiling. I stared but saw nothing. I had so much to say, to ask, and I was tongue-tied.\n \u201cI like your couch.\u201d It was a silly thing to say, but it was all I could come up with. The couch was L shaped and covered with a ridged red fabric. I tried to estimate its cost in cookies as I ran a finger along the outside arm. The material was warm and felt like skin.\n \u201cSit for a minute.\u201d Mother patted the back of the couch where she wanted me. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n I was so miserable that I considered running away as she passed from the room. But I couldn\u2019t take another step carrying the weight of all those sleepless nights. I needed someone to talk to, so I sat. Mist curled from the vaporizer on the low table in front of me. I sniffed, some kind of ambient drug. It smelled green. Mounted on the wall was an antique bicycle wheel, rust eating through the chrome, the tread on the tire worn to a shiny black.\n \u201cXeni\u2019s.\u201d Mother returned, carrying a tray. \u201cShe races. Apparently that wheel was on some bike that won Omeo\u2019s Climb, back who knows when.\u201d\n She put the tray on the table and settled beside me. I glanced from it to her. \u201cAm I staying?\u201d\n \u201cIf you want.\u201d\n She\u2019d made my favorite treats: bittersweet clusters, cheese and figs on skewers, pickled cob, salami with tiny crowns of mustard.\n I reached for the bittersweets. \u201cWhat, no cookies?\u201d\n She had a way of snorting and laughing at the same time. \u201cThat\u2019s your father\u2019s specialty.\u201d Hearing that intimate sound that only she could make carried me back to a sunny memory of the four of us on our boat on the river, Father rowing us home from church and Mother laughing as Zana and I pulled snack treasures from the picnic basket.\n \u201cHow is he?\u201d said Mother.\n And then I was back in an apartment in Skytown, and our little family was in ruins. \u201cBitter,\u201d I said. \u201cI had to move out. I\u2019m living in the church for now.\u201d\n \u201cIt was past time, I think. You needed to be on your own.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut the church?\u201d\n \u201cNobody knows what happened that night,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody in the village, that is. They think it was an accident.\u201d My tongue felt like a brick. \u201cBut you know.\u201d\n She nodded.\n The silence stretched so tight, I thought I might snap. \u201cI like your place.\u201d Why was everything that came out of my mouth so trite?\n \u201cYou never visited.\u201d\n \u201cNo. Sorry.\u201d This was a reproach I\u2019d feared, but somehow it wasn\u2019t as awful as I\u2019d thought it would be. \u201cThat was wrong.\u201d Mother had every right to blame me; I didn\u2019t know what I was doing or who I was anymore. \u201cDid Zana?\u201d\n Mother spoke an order in Anglic. I\u2019d been taking lessons and picked up something about a holiday or a birthday. Then the wall displayed a picture of Mother and Zana sitting on the couch just as we were and with practically the same snacks in front. This was the Zana I knew, my sister. Not the other, the rep I\u2019d never seen.\n \u201cDid she say anything after she was repped?\u201d I said. \u201cAbout me, I mean?\u201d\n \u201cNot much.\u201d Mother spoke as if she were tiptoeing around broken glass. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know why you did it.\u201d\n I should\u2019ve said something\u2014Mother expected me to. But I was back on the Bride, seeing it all again for the millionth time and still not understanding. I\u2019d heard Moya\u2019s voice, so how could I have sinned?\n \u201cShe left the orbital yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cShould arrive at the wormhole\u2019s insertion point next Friday.\u201d\n \u201cBut no message? Nothing?\u201d\n She sighed. \u201cThey say that a rep\u2019s most vivid memories are her last moments. For me, it was just fog, but then I was a direct transfer. They put me to sleep, I died, they woke me up. But somewhere in between, I remember wrestling with . . . well, like I said. Fog.\u201d She waved the mist wafting from the vaporizer toward her and breathed deeply. \u201cIt was like swimming, almost drowning, and I needed to stay upright except my feet kept sinking and I couldn\u2019t pull free and it . . . it took a while, is all. I was ready for it to stop.\u201d She shook her head as if to part that remembered fog. \u201cZana\u2019s memories were more painful, I guess.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I felt my throat close. How many messages had I sent my sister apologizing every which way I could think of? None of which she answered.\n Then I was crying, hot tears, choking sobs.\n Mother patted my arm. \u201cI think she knows.\u201d\n But it wasn\u2019t only for my sister that I cried. I wept for Mother and Father and the life we all had lost. And for Moya, who answered to an upsider drug.\n I finally got myself under control. \u201cHe was telling us that he died in a flier crash,\u201d I swiped at my eyes. \u201cQuin, that night. So at least he knew what she went through. Maybe that was a help.\u201d\n \u201cI hope so.\u201d She picked up a round of salami and examined it critically. \u201cI didn\u2019t like him at first. Too much the upsider, always talking about how we\u2019ll have to give up our ways and become citizens of the Thousand Worlds. I think what he really wants is to chase down his Exotics, and go live with them.\u201d The tip of her tongue licked the mustard crown and then she nibbled an edge the way she always did. \u201cBut he did right by her, paid her way to Ravi\u2019s Prize. Says he\u2019ll follow her there after he finishes his research. We\u2019ll see. I think he means well.\u201d\n \u201cIs there a picture of her?\u201d I said. \u201cAfter, I mean.\u201d\n She spoke in Anglic again. I recognized daughter.\n A woman stared at me from Mother\u2019s wall\u2014not quite a stranger. Her eyes were as deep as the night sky, just as I remembered her. But she had an ungodly pale complexion and her hair was cropped too short and the proportions of her face were all wrong. My breath caught when I realized that she looked more like me than herself. My twin.\n \u201cI hope,\u201d I said, \u201cshe\u2019ll be happy someday.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Mother. \u201cI pray the numbers that she will.\u201d\n James Patrick Kelly has won the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards; his fiction has been translated into twenty-one languages.

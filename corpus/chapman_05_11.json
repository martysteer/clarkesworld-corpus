His mind insists that it\u2019s only been a moment since the stinging injection and the deep breaths of cold gas that taste like metal and sugar. One of the attendants, her voice soft, tells him it\u2019s been half a century since he last opened his eyes. Not a fleeting local century, either. Those whiz by in something under a decade. She means a real century, an Earth century. Her mother hadn\u2019t even been born when he last walked on Terranova\u2019s ruddy soil.\n He adjusts more slowly than the other times. It\u2019s his age. Though hiber-sleep provides the chapter breaks in the story of his life, that story still covers eighty-three waking years. He suspects that this chapter, the one he\u2019s just beginning, is likely to conclude with \u201cthe end.\u201d\n His voice is little more than a croak until the attendant gives him water to sip. In a gritty whisper, he asks her if it will be a happy ending.\n She smiles and tells him of the new star in Terranova\u2019s sky. It\u2019s the rich blue color of a chipchip\u2019s egg\u2014a bright dot pointing back toward Earth.\n Diaspora, he whispers.\n Tell me, she begs, her voice bright with a child\u2019s eagerness. Tell me the story.\n To her, it\u2019s all a fairy tale, and he, a hero who has stepped from fiction to fact.\n Why not? There is time. An hour or two before his legs will carry him properly. A year or two before Diaspora makes orbit. It will be good to have his memories in order before the big day.\n With as deep a breath as he can manage, he plunges into the past.\n Trent Bishop was the third generation of the Moon\u2019s most prominent business dynasty. His grandfather had been instrumental in founding the original colony that had grown into an independent nation of thirty million people. Now, fifteen years into his own turn at the helm of Bishop Industries, Trent was beginning to hate his life.\n He stood on the dull, dusty lunar surface, listening to the roar of his own breath inside his pressure suit\u2019s helmet. He was on the lip of a crater two kilometers from the cluster of structures that were the core of the Lunar Republic. Below, on the crater floor, a dozen behemoths, sporting \u201cBishop Const.\u201d stencils, raked and scraped the regolith into the foundation for a new dome. Above, glaring down at him from orbit, was the biggest mistake he\u2019d ever made.\n Diaspora. He looked up to where sunlight glinted off the great ship in orbit. Once it launched, the starship would spend the next one hundred fifty years ferrying four thousand people in cold sleep to the Gliese star system. It was a colony in a can, ready-made to fulfill the dreams of those who wanted to see the human race established around another star.\n That was the problem. Trent had never cared much about that dream. Too late, he\u2019d realized just how much Irene DeSart had.\n \u201cStarting over on a whole new planet?\u201d he\u2019d said the last time the subject had come up between them. They\u2019d been in the Earthlight Caf\u00e9, grabbing a quick dinner between her back-to-back shifts at the North Dome\u2019s oxygen garden. \u201cThose people are crazy.\u201d\n She\u2019d smiled at him, her head tilted to the side and her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou build cities on the Moon,\u201d she\u2019d said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d\n \u201cSeventy-five years ago, you would have been one of those people.\u201d\n \u201cNonsense.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s in your blood, Trent.\u201d\n His blood. Maybe so. His grandfather had certainly been one of those people. He\u2019d conquered the Moon. Trent\u2019s father had tamed it. What was Trent doing, then?\n He\u2019d found himself losing interest in the pressed soy patty on his plate. \u201cI have a business, here,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cWe have lives here.\u201d\n She\u2019d sighed deeply enough to blow her napkin across the table. \u201cPlural again,\u201d she\u2019d said.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n \u201cLives.\u201d She\u2019d smiled, but there\u2019d been a sadness in it that Trent hadn\u2019t understood. \u201cI always thought we\u2019d have one life\u2014together.\u201d\n Only looking back on that moment, with the naked stars above and the naked landscape around him, both daring him to bare himself as well, did he understand that smile. It had been the mask of accepted pain. Inside, she\u2019d already said goodbye.\n He looked down at the crater floor. Work lights cut dagger-shadows behind the heavy equipment. Dust clung to everything despite the antistatic paint. Inside his helmet, his sigh became a moan. He took a deep breath and told his suit radio to call his attorney.\n \u201cTrent, you\u2019re not even supposed to know she signed up.\u201d Carter Harmon, all lawyer jokes aside, was a fierce ethicist. He took the Republic\u2019s laws seriously, both in letter and intent. The two had been friends since college. More than once, Trent had referred to Carter as his conscience\u2019s conscience. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you found out,\u201d Carter went on, \u201cand if you tell me, I\u2019ll report you. We have strong privacy laws for a reason.\u201d\n Bribery, theft, digital trespassing. He\u2019d used a little of each in increasingly desperate measure until he\u2019d found her. He couldn\u2019t say he was proud of it, but what else could he have done? He\u2019d been busy with the new dome. There\u2019d been deals within deals to make; water contracts, space commitments, air rights. He\u2019d even had to negotiate which hotel chain\u2019s signage would be most conspicuous from the main glidewalk. When he\u2019d come up for air, she\u2019d been gone. Her phone canceled. Her apartment vacated. He\u2019d wasted weeks using conventional means to find her.\n \u201cI just need to talk to her,\u201d Trent said. He heard the plea in his own voice. He was sounding like the whiny rich kid he\u2019d never wanted to become.\n \u201cIt can\u2019t be done.\u201d Carter\u2019s declaration was a wall of finality. \u201cAccording to the foundation, the passengers are already in hiber-sleep. The process is too risky. They\u2019re not coming out of it until the other end.\u201d\n Trent watched a scoop truck deliver another load of regolith to one of his mining haulers. It would go to another site to be processed, its oxygen and precious metals extracted. More money. More residents. More customers. Just like the last one. Like the next one.\n \u201cTrent?\u201d Carter said. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d\n \u201cYou have to get me on board, Carter. Whatever it takes.\u201d\n \u201cI already told you,\u201d Carter said. \u201cNo visitors.\u201d\n \u201cI know that!\u201d\n There was a long silence before Carter spoke again. \u201cI\u2019ve been your lawyer for fifteen years,\u201d the man said at last. \u201cI\u2019ve been your friend a lot longer than that. I think you know I\u2019d do anything for you\u2014up to a point. What you\u2019re asking . . . It\u2019s way on the other side of that point, Trent.\u201d\n \u201cI want you to get me on\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou screwed up,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI think you knew you were screwing up while you were doing it. Hell, I told you you were screwing up.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014as a passenger.\u201d\n \u201cShit,\u201d Carter breathed.\n \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Carter. Not anymore. Not without Irene.\u201d\n Carter sighed. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI get that. Look, are you sure about this? It\u2019s a hell of a life we\u2019ll be . . . It\u2019s a lot to give up.\u201d\n Trent looked up at Diaspora again. \u201cI used to think so.\u201d\n The attendant gives a little schoolgirl swoon. Love, she whispers.\n Potent stuff, love. It wounds. It wrecks and rends. It tears down dynasties. Builds up worlds. It makes you squirm through sickly slime. Lets you fly on wings of woven light. Love, he says, is a bitch.\n He stands on shaky legs and takes a few brief steps. She holds his arm protectively. Her grip is firm enough to be reassuring, but gentle, too. She doesn\u2019t support him as if he\u2019s feeble. She guides him as if he\u2019s important. He\u2019s not, of course. He\u2019s just a gear\u2014a pulley for the ropes of the universe to pull their weight on.\n Love, he says again, this time without the sharpness in his voice. It\u2019s love that\u2019s done all the work.\n Trent stood in the tenth-floor observation lounge of East Dome. Broad sheets of lunamum window wrapped a third of the way around the building. His back was to the panoramic view of Mare Tranquilitatis. Instead, he watched the approach of an angular, self-assured woman whose sure-footed glide marked her as a lunar native. Her gray hair was cropped close to her head and she wore a tailored business-casual jumpsuit. She was Marina Valikova, chief coordinator of the Diaspora Project.\n \u201cI understood this was to be informal, Mr. Bishop.\u201d She nodded toward Carter who stood at Trent\u2019s side, hands clasped before him. \u201cShould I have brought representation?\u201d\n Trent tried to gesture reassurance. \u201cHe\u2019s just here in case I say something insane.\u201d\n Valikova looked at Carter. \u201cIs that something he\u2019s likely to do?\u201d\n Carter nodded. \u201cVery likely.\u201d\n Trent smiled. \u201cHe\u2019ll verify that I really mean it.\u201d\n The woman\u2019s face remained expressionless as she looked back to Trent. She stared at him as if trying to see past everything that everyone \u201cknows\u201d about wealthy, famous people to find the man behind it. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said at last.\n They sat down in a cluster of chairs angled to take advantage of the view. Before Trent could say anything, Valikova spoke again. \u201cYou should know at the start that you\u2019re wasting your time, Mr. Bishop. Diaspora launches in three days and there is no more room.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d Trent leaned forward. \u201cBut I understand you\u2019re already organizing the funds for the second wave. I thought, perhaps, I might help.\u201d\n \u201cAll donations are welcome,\u201d she said.\n Trent smiled, pausing for effect. \u201cI was thinking something on the order of my entire net worth.\u201d\n Valikova merely glanced at Carter, her eyebrows slightly raised.\n \u201cYes, he means it,\u201d Carter said. \u201cAnd strictly off the record, yes, he\u2019s insane.\u201d\n Still expressionless, Valikova looked back at Trent. \u201cIt took us twenty years to build Diaspora. Will you still be so committed after another twenty? You would still arrive twenty years behind her, you know.\u201d\n Trent cleared his throat, staring intently at the way his white-knuckled fingers were twisted together. He couldn\u2019t look her in the eye. \u201cI was thinking\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t any louder, but it was stronger, sterner. \u201cYou were not thinking that I would keep another passenger in hiber-sleep for an extra twenty years while you took his place, because if you were thinking that, I would lose out on a lot of funding when I told you to take a long walk in a short airlock.\u201d\n Trent\u2019s face reddened as he kept his gaze locked on his hands.\n \u201cAt least you have the good sense to be embarrassed,\u201d she went on. \u201cTell me honestly, Mr. Bishop. Is that the sort of person you\u2019d want to start a new world with?\u201d\n \u201cSorry,\u201d Bishop breathed. He finally forced himself to look up at her face. The hardness there was gone, replaced by a kindness and compassion that seemed to shave a decade off of her age. He tried to smile. \u201cMaybe we can do it in ten.\u201d\n For the first time since they\u2019d met, Valikova smiled. \u201cEven ten years is a long time,\u201d she said.\n \u201cEverything.\u201d Bishop trembled with the strength of the admission. \u201cEverything I have. Everything I am. I\u2019d trade it all to talk to her one more time.\u201d\n Carter leaned over and put his hand on Trent\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not that long,\u201d he said.\n Ten years is nearly half the attendant\u2019s life so far. To her, it is very nearly forever. She shakes her head in awe of the commitment.\n He can walk without her help now, but still she hovers as he reacquaints his limbs with the idea of motion.\n They are all human, he notes, and humans make mistakes. Sometimes our actions are mistaken. Sometimes it\u2019s our inaction. Either way, they haunt us. Some hide from their mistakes. Some feel compelled to fix them.\n But some mistakes just can\u2019t be fixed, can they? Not in ten years. Not in a hundred. Not in a quarter of a millennium. We can only hope to ease the consequences of the things we should have done but didn\u2019t\u2014to still the echoes of a moment\u2019s carelessness.\n He\u2019d never seen a river until he came to Terranova, but he\u2019d recognized it immediately. He\u2019d lived his life in such a place, struggling to stay upright through the churning rapids. Thinking of it, he finds he is uncomfortable imparting wisdom to the attendant. He is not well suited to the role of elder statesman. But the words need saying, because even now, here in this quiet eddy away from the froth and foam, he still feels the inexorable pull of the current that has swept him so far along. Too, he feels the need to ease the consequences.\n He moves his left arm, feeling it resist. He\u2019d nearly lost it to a real river in his second waking period after the landing. Their power needs had outgrown the tiny nuke plant they\u2019d brought, and the solar panels had been under-performing. He wonders if the hydroelectric plant is still running so many years later. Two people died when the original foundation collapsed. He had nearly been the third.\n He smiles to himself. The plans never tell the whole story, do they? There are always hidden costs.\n Trent punched up the design specs for Diaspora\u2019s main thruster while Carter and Chen Xiang, Bishop Engineering\u2019s most competent propulsion expert, looked on. The skeletal plans filled the two-meter bubble tank.\n Chen leaned closer, his nose almost touching the glass of the three-dimensional display. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d he said. \u201cMagneto-plasma rocket. Very elegant.\u201d\n Trent folded his arms. \u201cI need to boost its thrust.\u201d\n Chen picked up the design station\u2019s control puck and used it to fly through the plans. He moved around at dizzying speed, zooming in to read details here and there, then flying off to examine something else entirely. At last, he pulled away again, leaving the design rotating slowly in the middle of the tank. He looked at Trent. \u201cBy how much?\u201d\n \u201cDouble.\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n \u201cFifty percent, then,\u201d Trent said. \u201cWhatever you can give me.\u201d\n Chen shook his head. \u201cMr. Bishop, that thing can already move a small asteroid, given time. Just what are you planning to\u2014?\u201d He broke off, glancing at the ceiling as if he could see through the intervening structure and all the way to orbit.\n \u201cWhatever you can give me,\u201d Trent repeated.\n Chen nodded. \u201cGive me Hirakawa from the materials division,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s working on some bleeding-edge ceramic magnets. He\u2019ll probably want a raise. Just give him whatever he asks for. It\u2019s no time to be cheap.\u201d\n More than once, Carter had suggested to Chen that he pay more attention to the norms of employer-employee relationships, but meaty engineering projects always seemed to wipe everything else from the man\u2019s mind.\n Trent smiled, giving Carter a quick shake of his head. \u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked Chen.\n \u201cA thirty gigawatt reactor.\u201d\n \u201cToo much mass.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out,\u201d Chen said. \u201cFor now, we just make it work. If I\u2019m going to a new planet, I want to get there as soon as possible.\u201d\n \u201cYou?\u201d Trent shook his head, looking surprised. \u201cChen, are you signed up for the second wave?\u201d\n \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n \u201cThen why?\u201d Trent hooked his thumb at the plans in the bubble tank. \u201cBecause of this?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rocket.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n Chen looked uncomfortable. He turned away for a moment, then snatched up the control puck and gave his full attention to the bubble tank. \u201cLet me know when Hirakawa\u2019s transferred, will you?\u201d\n Carter gently took Trent\u2019s arm, steering him toward the door. He nodded firmly in answer to Trent\u2019s questioning glance and tugged him along. Outside, already moving down the corridor, he finally spoke. \u201cHe\u2019s going because you\u2019re going,\u201d Carter said. \u201cHe can\u2019t say it. Probably doesn\u2019t even completely understand it, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n Carter shrugged, walking more slowly. They were heading toward the dome\u2019s central hub. \u201cI recognize the look,\u201d he said.\n Trent shook his head, but kept walking. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n They reached the end of the corridor. The hub of the enormous dome was open space, fifty meters across, stretching from ground to roof. Carter led Trent over to the railing. Every one of the dome\u2019s ten floors had a wide boulevard that circled the hub. From where they stood, five floors above the ground, the sense of space was tremendous. A delicate-looking lattice filled the hub, supporting engineered plants and mosses that contributed a good share of the building\u2019s atmosphere recycling. The space glittered green with life. From where they stood, they could see thousands of people going about their day\u2019s affairs.\n \u201cYou built this,\u201d Carter said. \u201cOn a dusty, airless rock, you made this happen.\u201d\n Trent smiled at that. \u201cIt was a good job.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Carter said, sweeping his hand across the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s a quarter of a million lives. It\u2019s Chen\u2019s life.\u201d He paused and looked at Trent\u2019s face. \u201cMy life.\u201d\n Trent stared back at him, wide-eyed. \u201cYou too?\u201d\n Carter shrugged and looked away. \u201cYou\u2019re my only client,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the hell else would I do?\u201d\n \u201cThere are no guarantees, Carter.\u201d\n \u201cThere never are.\u201d The lawyer was quiet for a while. When he finally spoke, it was with an uncharacteristic hesitancy. \u201cThis dome isn\u2019t the only thing you built, Trent. You\u2019ve touched . . . What was I when we met? Do you remember? I do. I look in the mirror and see that rat-assed loser. Desperately trying to hide from everything. Too afraid to live. Too scared to end it.\u201d\n \u201cYou turned yourself around.\u201d\n \u201cYou got me through college and into law school,\u201d Carter went on. \u201cMade me stay when I wanted to quit. Kept me straight when I wanted to wash it all away in a sea of drugs. Convinced me that what happened to me mattered\u2014to me.\u201d\n Trent peered at Carter\u2019s face, but the man refused to meet his gaze. \u201cCarter, this is too big a decision to make out of some sense of loyalty.\u201d\n Carter just laughed and said, \u201cI know.\u201d\n Great men inspire loyalty, the attendant says. It\u2019s a powerful force.\n He snorts. Loyalty is a piker. It\u2019s what you do because it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s a beggar, dependent for its power on the goodwill of others. Even great men are lost if all they can martial behind them is feeble old loyalty.\n In his fourth waking period\u2014the unscheduled one\u2014there\u2019d been that one guy\u2014what was his name? Mendenhall. That was it. His people had been loyal to him when he\u2019d tried to take control of the colony. The plan was all wrong, he\u2019d said. It was stupid to live their lives for people who were already more dead than alive.\n They woke you to help, the attendant says.\n They\u2019d conjured him like some elder ghost to settle things and bring peace to the world. Peace through strength. He\u2019d done it, too. He shudders now, recalling the needless deaths that had brought the colony to the edge of failure.\n He\u2019s grown tired of this room and ready to test his legs in the hallway outside. She reluctantly agrees, but never lets her hand stray more than a breath from his arm as he toddles out the door.\n She\u2019s getting it all wrong, he fears. She just doesn\u2019t understand. When she tells others this story, it should be the right story. Loyalty merely begs. Love commands. Even death is helpless before love.\n For most, the launch ceremony for Diaspora was anticlimactic. The long, showy countdown culminated in little more than satellite-relayed video of a bright, blue-white glow streaming from the back of the ship. There was no dramatic scene of the great ship zooming off into the cosmos, not even the slow, grand rise of a ground-based lift-off. One moment, the giant screen in mission control held an image of the starship against a scattering of stars, the next the image was exactly the same, except for a flood of ion plasma streaming from the back of it. It would be weeks before Diaspora showed any perceptible motion. The cheering of the crowd made more commotion than the ship did.\n Trent leaned against one of the room\u2019s many consoles. He and Carter had been invited to watch the launch with the staff. He stared at the screen, letting the celebration surge around him, the cheers and laughter splashing uselessly against his stony mood.\n \u201cOdd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n Trent started, surprised to find Valikova and Carter standing beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s odd,\u201d Trent said.\n She glanced at the big screen. \u201cFor them, it will be tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t arrive for a hundred and fifty years. Nearly another hundred before a signal can get back to us. They have this amazing future ahead of them, but for most of the people here, they\u2019re already dead.\u201d\n Trent turned to look at her profile while she stared at Diaspora. \u201cThey\u2019re not dead,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYes, they are.\u201d Now she turned to him, staring into his face with a surprising intensity. \u201cAnd so will you be, once you enter hiber-sleep. We who remain will be left with nothing but your memory and a vague hope that you\u2019ll find happiness in another life. Does that sound familiar?\u201d\n Someone walked by with a tray of champagne-filled cups. Trent took one, but merely stared at it in his hand. \u201cAre you trying to talk me out of this?\u201d\n \u201cMy people are Russian,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cEvery silver lining has a dark cloud around it.\u201d She paused for a while before going on. \u201cYou know, Egyptian pharaohs used to have their loyal servants buried with them to help in the afterlife.\u201d\n Carter stepped closer, sliding between Valikova and Trent. \u201cYour point?\u201d he said.\n \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a flood of sign-ups since Mr. Bishop went public.\u201d She glanced toward Trent quickly, then back to Carter.\n \u201cSpeak plainly,\u201d Carter said. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m going.\u201d\n \u201cVery well,\u201d Valikova said. \u201cThe pharaoh\u2019s servants didn\u2019t have a choice, Mr. Bishop. Your people do. That\u2019s a lot of power to wield.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s their choice,\u201d Trent said.\n But the woman didn\u2019t even glance at Trent. She kept her gaze fixed on Carter. \u201cThey\u2019re following you into heaven, Mr. Bishop. Maybe into hell. All I ask is that you use the power wisely.\u201d\n \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Carter said.\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d Valikova looked back at the image of Diaspora. \u201cIt\u2019s not him I\u2019m worried about.\u201d\n Twelve years, not ten. He tells the attendant that\u2019s how long it really took to build Irene. He feels more stable now. His legs seem as good as they\u2019re going to get. The attendant\u2019s hovering is beginning to annoy him, but he tolerates it because he wants her full attention. The story isn\u2019t finished yet.\n He takes a few quick steps away from her and turns, just to show her that he can. Her face shows more concern than surprise, followed slowly by a smile.\n He asks if she would follow someone into the great beyond, but she misunderstands. She insists he is far from any sort of tomb.\n But something in her expression makes him think twice. Maybe she understands all too well. Her concern is more than professional. Yes, of course. How many greats, he asks, lie between his sperm and her granddaughter-hood.\n She confesses. He is six generations her sire. She mentions a name and he pretends to remember the woman it denotes. He wonders how many of his descendants he\u2019s known during those times when he was awake, guiding the colony through some emergency, or stretching its capabilities into new areas.\n It\u2019s hazy, those early days. Everyone slept with everyone then. Babies were the colony\u2019s future and few wombs went unfilled. It was awkward at times, but strictly voluntary, and ended up producing a culture that at least seemed healthy. Sex was sex and relationships were relationships. If the twain met, well that was just a bonus. Love, though, that was different. Love was a thing unto itself. He\u2019d cared about all of them, but hadn\u2019t loved them. His love slept through it. It sleeps still.\n His newly-revealed quadruple-great-grandchild interrupts his thoughts. She thinks he should rest.\n No rest, he says. There\u2019s no time. Never enough time.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d Trent said. He coughed again. The cough had become more insistent over the last few weeks. More painful, too. Carter kept nagging him to slow down, to rest, but it had been nearly ten years already. He had to keep to Irene\u2019s schedule.\n \u201cA little time now,\u201d Chen said, setting his datapad down on Trent\u2019s coffee table, \u201cor a hundred years later.\u201d\n Trent\u2019s living room had become the project\u2019s hub. The furniture was crowded by computers, displays, and bubble tanks. Bishop Industries no longer existed. Trent had killed it, but it had been left to Carter to slice its carcass up and feed it to the markets. It had taken years and had nearly destroyed the Lunar Republic\u2019s entire economy in the process. Trent himself had been too focused on Irene to notice.\n \u201cShow me,\u201d Trent said.\n Chen just pointed to the datapad. \u201cRun the sim,\u201d he said. \u201cPlasma physics plus fluid dynamics equals cauliflower.\u201d\n Trent tapped the datapad\u2019s screen. A funnel shape appeared, ejecting a simulated ion stream. It was the business end of Irene\u2019s engine. A power meter climbed steadily from thirty to forty percent. When it reached fifty, the stream began to fray along the edges. As the power increased, so did the turbulence, until it became a diffuse, boiling cloud.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the bell,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe need to redesign it. Above forty-eight percent power, most of the thrust is lost to turbulence.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cLong term, it could also cause significant damage.\u201d\n \u201cHow long?\u201d Trent\u2019s cough interrupted him, the fit lasting several seconds. Carter brought him a cup of water and held it while he drank. Trent sipped then nodded his thanks.\n Carter set the cup on the table and went back to his seat. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said to Chen.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no telling,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe\u2019re in new territory. Months, at least. The solution could be in the shape. It could be polish or materials. Nano-structure surfacing, maybe. I just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n Valikova leaned forward in her seat. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy now? Why Irene and not Diaspora?\u201d\n Chen just looked down at his hands. Trent, too, refused to meet her gaze. \u201cWell?\u201d she said.\n Finally, Chen cleared his throat and spoke. \u201cThey never ran a full-power test,\u201d he said. \u201cNo budget for it. No time on the schedule.\u201d\n \u201cThen they\u2019re\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d Carter said. He glanced at Trent, who looked away, fixing his gaze on the datapad and its churning flood of simulated plasma. \u201cJust slower than expected. Marina, you\u2019ll need to adjust the inventory. We\u2019re first wave, now, not second. Find room for the groundbreaking gear we left out\u2014seed stock, hydroponics, water purification. Chen, do what you need to do.\u201d\n Chen looked up. \u201cTrent?\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Bishop?\u201d\n Trent finally looked away from the datapad. He focused uncertainly on Carter, but said nothing.\n Carter gave him a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d he said.\n With a tiny nod, Trent swung his gaze toward Chen. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it beautiful for her,\u201d he said.\n Valikova sat back, sliding down in her seat. \u201cWhen I was young,\u201d she said, looking at Carter, \u201cI\u2019d always hoped to find such a love.\u201d\n \u201cYou said it yourself.\u201d Carter nodded toward Trent as he spoke. \u201cThe man\u2019s a romantic.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d she sighed. \u201cHim too.\u201d\n It\u2019s this way, isn\u2019t it? He turns to the right, proceeding slowly, but steadily, and without his descendant\u2019s assistance.\n She stays two steps behind, urging him to return to his room, but he ignores her. This is something he must do, something he always does when he awakens. This time, it feels more urgent, though. There is little time and he still has much to do.\n It\u2019s a beautiful world you\u2019ve made, his multi-great-granddaughter says. The coastal outpost is a city now. Three hundred thousand strong. The wave generators and the kelp farms you ordered have made it grow, and we\u2019ve adapted the Earth prawns, as well. There is food and power for millions more.\n He asks her about the shuttles. Have they been maintained? Is the fuel plant running? Has anyone been up to Irene recently?\n She isn\u2019t sure, but she thinks the last launch was decades ago.\n He wants to be angry about that, but he is too tired to stoke the fire beyond being annoyed. He merely sighs. There is always something more to do. They are building more than a world on Terranova. They are building a future. This place should be a step, not a terminus.\n She laughs, but cuts it off quickly. A colony\u2019s colony? Would he leave them so soon?\n Soon enough, he fears, but not by rocket. No, his place is here. Exactly here. He stops and touches the door before him. It\u2019s the room he\u2019s been seeking. He takes a deep breath, gathering himself.\n Alone, he tells her. She almost protests, but he repeats himself. I go in alone. Always alone.\n Carter stepped into Trent\u2019s living room to find the man leaning against the big design station, coughing. He put his hand in his pocket and gripped the small container there, waiting for the coughing fit to subside.\n Trent noticed him. He straightened up when the coughing stopped. \u201cThis damned cold,\u201d he said. \u201cJust won\u2019t let go.\u201d\n Carter stared at him. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to your doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cSelenosis.\u201d\n Trent barely looked surprised. He nodded. \u201cToo damn many trips through poorly filtered airlocks,\u201d he said. \u201cToo hands-on. Always had to be there in person, you know?\u201d He moved to the couch and eased himself down onto it. \u201cDidn\u2019t you lecture me once about the Republic\u2019s privacy laws?\u201d\n \u201cThat should tell you how serious I am,\u201d Carter said. He pulled the pills out of his pocket. \u201cTake these. They\u2019ll help you rest.\u201d\n \u201cToo much to do,\u201d Trent said.\n Carter handed the medicine to Trent and got a cup of water from the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re done,\u201d he said. \u201cChen\u2019s redesigned bell looks good to go. The ship is stocked. The passengers are mostly in h-sleep. You\u2019re done.\u201d\n \u201cThe details.\u201d\n \u201cThere are always details.\u201d Carter held the cup out. \u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle. I know the plan. I know how you work. I can take care of it.\u201d\n Finally, Trent relented. He took two of the pills, set the cup down, and leaned his head against the back of the couch. \u201cIt\u2019ll be up to you, you know. When we get there. I\u2019ll do what I can in the couple of years I have, but after that\u2014\u201d\n \u201cJust rest,\u201d Carter said.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much.\u201d Trent\u2019s voice grew softer, slurred. \u201cGiven up so much. I screwed up. But there you were. To catch me.\u201d\n \u201cAlways,\u201d Carter said. He stood watching for a while, until he was sure the man was asleep. He went to the apartment door and opened it.\n Valikova slid into the room. \u201cIt is done?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Carter led her to where Trent slept. \u201cCall your team.\u201d\n She laid her fingers on Trent\u2019s neck, checking his pulse. \u201cYou are sure about this?\u201d\n Carter shrugged. \u201cNot much choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to give him what he wants.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you, my dear?\u201d She straightened up and stepped closer to Carter, touching her palm to his cheek. \u201cDo you get what you want?\u201d\n He gave her a faint smile, took her hand from his face and held it in both of his. \u201cI accepted the way things are a long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, I get to build a world.\u201d\n \u201cFor them?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cFor him.\u201d\n He takes a deep breath and opens the door. The lights brighten automatically. He blinks and squints until his eyes adjust. There, in the center of the room, lies a hiber-sleep sarcophagus. It has been running, uninterrupted, for a quarter of a millennium. Inside, Trent Bishop sleeps, as he has slept since that day on his sofa.\n Carter lays his hand on the cool metal. Soon, he says. She\u2019ll be here soon. You\u2019ll be angry with me, I know, but it won\u2019t last. And I may not be around to see it. The important thing is you\u2019ll get your wish.

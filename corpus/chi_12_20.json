Distastefully, it lies prone next to my pillow: \u201cThere. Is. Some. One. At. The. Door. Xia. Xue. Jiao.\u201d\n \u201cI fucking know!\u201d I get up, throwing off the blanket.\n Carelessly, I kick over the half box of instant noodles I put next to the bed three days ago. They scatter all over the place. The room was never large, but now it looks especially small and narrow.\n knock, knock, knock.\n I put on some clothes I grab at random and trample through paper and dirty laundry to get to the door. Through the peephole, I see a middle-aged man standing in front of the door. His face is numb, holding no particular expression. He\u2019s braced as though he will knock down the door if I don\u2019t open it.\n \u201cWho do you want?\u201d I shout grumpily through the door.\n \u201cI\u2019m looking for . . . \u201d The man breaks off suddenly. He takes a piece of paper from his suit pocket and holds it to the peephole. On the paper is written two words: Master Hacker.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a place that sells knives downstairs and to the left,\u201d I yell back.\n The door still closed, I grab two bags of milk and a box of cat food. Aksha runs toward me, its tail high in the air. It stares at me, regards the milk with disdain and the cat food with interest. For a cat, this expression passes for a serious one.\n \u201cLooking for a Master Hacker?\u201d\n \u201cWe move out this afternoon,\u201d I whisper back.\n It snorts twice discontentedly and snatches the box of cat food out of my hand with its mouth. Cats don\u2019t like to leave their territory. Our vagabond life means we invariably have to leave before Aksha has had its way with the female cats in the neighborhood.\n \u201cWhich rat bastard gave away where we live?\u201d it grumbles as it eats up milk-soaked cat food. I suck at a bag of milk and begin to throw clothes into a suitcase.\n knock, knock, knock.\n I glance through the peephole. The man is really stubborn. He clearly has no plans of ever leaving.\n With a crash, I throw open the door. My hands on my waist, I stand in front of the man. \u201cAre you fucking sick in the head?\u201d\n The man stares dumbfounded. Perhaps chalk-dusted teachers who wear Western-style suits and trousers aren\u2019t used to being treated like this. Or maybe he expected a cruel, steely-eyed man, his cynical mind jacked into the net rather than a young woman staring back with bloodshot eyes.\n \u201cI\u2019m looking for . . . a Master Hacker,\u201d he says with a small voice.\n The door across the hall opens a crack. The retired woman stares from behind with interest, her gaze shifting up and down.\n \u201cSomething to hack with, my ass. If you want a kitchen knife you can use to kill yourself, they sell them in the market downstairs. I don\u2019t sell them here. Would you like a rope to hang yourself with? What mental hospital shut down and set you free to go to someone\u2019s home to buy a kitchen knife? What is wrong with you? For fuck\u2019s sake, scram! You annoy me.\u201d\n I slam the door shut. Inside the room, stuff crashes to the floor. Out of the corner of my eye, I see, through the window, the man leave. He seems much older suddenly.\n \u201cDid you track down his cell phone?\u201d I gesture at Aksha.\n \u201c13330573885.\u201d Aksha lashes its tail. \u201cCheng Liang, male, forty-eight years old, chemistry professor at G University. I\u2019ve already recorded his home address and IP address.\u201d\n I stuff clean clothes into the suitcase, the dirty clothes into a big plastic bag, and toss them both on the bed. The computer case opens in one swift flick. I take out a hard drive and hide it in a pocket. A terse note is left for the landlord explaining that I\u2019ve moved out. By the time Aksha grudgingly leaps into the cat carrier, the taxi I called for is already waiting downstairs.\n One suitcase, one cat carrier, one cat, and one hard drive, this is the sum total of what I\u2019m taking from the \u201cnest\u201d I lived in for four months. Everything else I\u2019m leaving for the landlord, who rarely ever shows up. He might be able to figure me out from this stuff, but he\u2019ll have no way to track me down. Because I\u2019m about to leave for a new place, I\u2019m about to start another phase of my life.\n It\u2019s always like this. My life is split by a series of moves. Sometimes, I can even hear the sound of my life slowly rotting in these wrecked memories. My life is an abject mess, unbearably vile. A woman ought to have the serene happiness I absolutely do not have. Obviously, I don\u2019t have a husband.\n Men aren\u2019t capable of being a companion to a woman like me. So I have a chatty cat, who grudgingly regards itself as a partner in my career as a \u201cMaster Hacker.\u201d\n But it generally finds female cats way more attractive.\n Abyss\n Without a whole lot of effort, I find a safe cubbyhole in another city one hundred and eighty kilometers away. The ID I use is my fourth set: a half-hearted effort, it pins all its hopes on being a young woman with a postgraduate diploma. The age and appearance are dead-on.\n After settling in, my first order of business is to unpack my fully tricked out computer and get on the net. The landlord doesn\u2019t live here, but his son, before he leaves, earnestly helps me load in and install the computer. His gaze never leaves my low-cut dress.\n The landlord proudly boasts that his son is a good student. He\u2019s in ninth grade and can absolutely test into a good school.\n My cat glances at the whiskers on the boy\u2019s face. They grow up so fast these days.\n At 2:00 a.m. the next day, I link into an abyss.\n The network has many layers. Some people are content to merely skim the surface, enjoying the virtual images and information electrical brain stimulation brings them. A long time ago, people enjoyed opening doors that were closed to them. As a result, they became known as hackers. Then the brain-network interface was invented. Some people discovered certain places didn\u2019t have doors, but no one had ever set foot there. Stale data, long-disappeared records piled up in forgotten corners to the point that they were considered long-deleted secrets.\n We call this sort of place an abyss.\n Lots of people are happy to work for the government as \u201cspelunkers,\u201d depending on their piddling skills, to excavate data from ancient abysses and convert them into cash. If their luck is good, they can make a fortune. But not everyone is content to be a spelunker. Some people like more extreme methods of making money or more direct means of grabbing money from the government. We call ourselves \u201cMaster Hackers.\u201d\n When I\u2019m online, Aksha keeps me company. Anyone who says cats can\u2019t go online is an idiot. Twenty years ago, people said humanity couldn\u2019t go to Mars. Ten years ago, people solemnly swore that there was no way to connect a human mind to the network. Five years ago, people said that cats and dogs couldn\u2019t speak.\n As the facts show, they are all idiots.\n Although being at the representational layer is like being a stranded fish placed back into water, once I sink into an abyss, Aksha astutely stops. It doesn\u2019t like these huge, distant data spaces. Hanging out just outside, it guards me against government surveillance programs.\n Lots of people do not know how to find the abysses of \u201cMaster Hackers.\u201d They stare at unused servers, idle computers, not realizing there\u2019s a kind of abyss that they keep brushing past.\n The servers Master Hackers use are always busy, especially the massively multiplayer online game databases. We use every trick in the book to set up our own development spaces.\n I enter the game data from World of Stars. Within a dense of fog of calculations, I find the cleverly camouflaged door. A password as obvious as if it were carved into my memory matches a long string of characters like flowing water. The door within the illusion opens easily.\n I never put any essential programs on my hard drive. The programs a smart Master Hacker uses are all hidden in the recesses of the network. They serve as the strongest and nimblest extensions of one\u2019s mind, radiating like a spiderweb in all directions.\n For the same reason: If someone seizes the data within a Master Hacker\u2019s database, that person also has the Master Hacker in the palm of their hand. To tell the truth, when that man held up the piece of paper with \u201cMaster Hacker\u201d written on it, I practically pissed my pants.\n The database bears the marks of a break in. Some are meticulously and ingeniously concealed but leave some inadvertent loose ends. Others are blatant, but are neatly cut off from its source. No way to trace them. A blast of cold flits across my back. I shudder in spite of myself.\n An abyss is a place filled with danger. No one gets this. Whoever you meet, or the person who spies on you, is a government spelunker or a Master Hacker or is a ghost hidden inside a vast database. Spelunkers and Master Hackers pass around a saying you need to understand: Some abysses absolutely must not be tested. Hiding there are vast existences beyond our comprehension. All the jackholes who go there are drawn into a vortex of data, forever gone. They leave behind stiff bodies, lying comatose in hospital ICUs.\n \u201cHave you found the bastard?\u201d Aksha\u2019s consciousness wanders over.\n \u201cI\u2019d really rather not.\u201d I bring Aksha into the middle of the streaming data. Segment by segment, I unspool it out. \u201cLook, these marks are from after we left. They\u2019re from government spelunkers entering my database. But the jackhole who left this blatant mark, did you notice? Maybe he\u2019s a newbie, but tidy. If he can do this, then the only . . . \u201d\n The cat sighs.\n Aksha brandishes a claw and breaks its connection to the network. I send a disconnect command, too. It\u2019s as if my stiff body is being pulled away from a warm pool. Reluctantly, I leave the network and return to harsh, cold reality. Although I feel nauseous, there are some things that are best not discussed in the network.\n \u201cYour point is that there are \u2018Sea Spiders\u2019 stalking us?\u201d Aksha fidgets, grinding its claws against the hardwood floor. \u201cWhy would they do that? They have to know. We don\u2019t have anything to do with them anymore.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll have to take the job to find out.\u201d I fish out the number from the chip in my head. \u201c13330573885, Cheng Liang. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll have a chat with the university professor.\u201d\n Father and Daughter\n Breaking into Cheng Liang\u2019s personal computer is really easy. At 5:00 p.m., he still hasn\u2019t left work yet, but I\u2019ve already worked out the man\u2019s basic situation: He has a steady job. His wife died two years ago. His daughter, Cheng Wen, is sick and recuperating at G City General Hospital. Before his daughter got sick, he barely had any interests outside of work, but after she was hospitalized, he began to search the network for everything from rumors and stories to web pages and data about \u201cMaster Hackers.\u201d They practically fill up his hard drive.\n Aksha takes several pieces of data and digs into the G City General Hospital\u2019s database. We fall into our rhythm working with each other and quickly find Cheng Wen.\n She is in a single-unit ICU with symptoms of schizophrenia.\n She isn\u2019t manic like the other patients in the psych ward. As observed from the monitoring equipment, Cheng Wen is incredibly calm. She lies curled up on the bed. Her large, clear eyes stare at the computer at the head of the bed. According to the psych ward records, Cheng Liang installed the computer for his daughter. Without a computer, she simply stopped eating in protest.\n The door opens. Cheng Liang walks in with a box lunch. A nurse stands next to him.\n \u201cWennie?\u201d Cheng Liang cautiously studies his daughter\u2019s response. Gently, he sets her lunch on the overbed table.\n She turns her head, meeting Cheng Liang\u2019s gaze for a moment. It\u2019s not a mad glance. On the contrary, it was too calm, too still for a woman of nineteen. Her mouth opens and closes twice, as though she were saying \u201cpapa,\u201d but without any sound.\n \u201cWennie, time to eat.\u201d Cheng Liang sits beside the bed, opens the box, careful to leave some distance between him and his daughter.\n \u201cThank you.\u201d Courteously, she accepts the proffered lunch and takes a few elegant bites. She uses a knife and fork rather than chopsticks.\n An odd feeling fills the ward. Father and daughter fall silent with each other. She\u2019s obviously his flesh and blood, but seems like a stranger, maintaining a polite distance. A fine thread of pain shone mirrorlike on their faces.\n When his daughter finishes her lunch, Cheng Liang repacks the box and utensils. He stands. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now, Wennie.\u201d\n \u201cOh. Goodbye,\u201d she answers.\n Throughout the entire visit, she never called him her father.\n I sigh, leave the hospital\u2019s monitoring system, clean up the traces of my break in, then leave the network. It\u2019s not until now that a headache pierces through my neural shield, making me dizzy and unsteady. I stagger into the kitchen, swallow a pill, and chase it down with a glass of water. Then I sit in front of my computer again.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you want to rest a bit?\u201d Aksha asks.\n \u201cNo point.\u201d I stare at the screen. \u201cI don\u2019t need a \u2018full connection\u2019 for what\u2019s left. A \u2018machine connection\u2019 is good enough. I can guess what\u2019s going on. But what\u2019s important now is to make the university professor believe us.\u201d\n \u201cSomeone who studies too much is easy to deceive.\u201d Aksha yawns and curls into a warm ball around my leg.\n About an hour later, the cell phone tracker signals: Cheng Liang has come home.\n Remotely, I turn on his computer and print a line of text on his display: \u201cAre you looking for me?\u201d\n I guess he must be scared half to death because his microphone picks up a cracking sound, as if something has been smashed to pieces.\n I add: \u201cI am a Master Hacker. You were looking for me, right? Speak. I can hear you.\u201d\n He makes a sound not unlike a strangled goose. I enable speech synthesis on his computer and start typing quickly. On his end, his speaker emits a nauseating, inhuman sound. That should be enough to make someone either hate or fear a Master Hacker.\n \u201cI know you\u2019re looking for me,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? How much are you paying? Who else knows you\u2019re looking for a Master Hacker?\u201d\n He pants for a moment. Once he recovers: \u201cI want . . . I want you to find someone.\u201d\n I laugh. \u201cFind who?\u201d\n \u201cI . . . I want you to find my daughter.\u201d The university professor seems as helpless as a child. \u201cI want you to find my daughter. My \u2018uploaded\u2019 daughter.\u201d\n \u201cYour daughter hasn\u2019t been uploaded. Right now, she is at the best hospital receiving the best possible treatment from their neurologists.\u201d I laugh grimly.\n Through his webcam, I see him back away, as if I could bite him through the network. \u201cHow . . . how did you know?\u201d\n \u201cBecause I\u2019m a \u2018Master Hacker,\u2019\u201d I answer.\n \u201cShe isn\u2019t my daughter!\u201d Cheng Liang shouts. \u201cI know she isn\u2019t!\u201d His hands spasm as they grip the hem of his jacket. \u201cI know she isn\u2019t. My daughter was uploaded. Who knows what is in her body now! I want you to find Wennie and bring her back. Money is no concern. I want her back!\u201d\n I glance over at Aksha. It yawns and nods its head.\n I sigh. \u201cJust to get this out of the way: I won\u2019t necessarily be able find your \u2018uploaded\u2019 daughter, so I won\u2019t ask you to pay up-front. I\u2019ll wait until I have a lead. Naturally, I\u2019ll be in touch. Don\u2019t keep looking for another \u2018Master Hacker.\u2019 Otherwise, I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be able to pull this off. Got it?\u201d\n He nods over and over again. His cast is so desperate, it\u2019s like he\u2019s giving medicine to a dead horse. For a crime as serious as \u201cuploading,\u201d he really doesn\u2019t have any options besides looking for a \u201cMaster Hacker.\u201d\n \u201cIn that case,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cTell me everything about what happened to your daughter.\u201d\n On that side of the computer, Cheng Liang chatters endlessly with his head in his hands. On this side of the computer, I light a cigarette and listen quietly.\n According to the learned university professor, his daughter was always an \u201cobedient and well-behaved child.\u201d But, eventually, he didn\u2019t know why, she became a fan of virtual-reality games, wallowing with no way to free herself. He tried hitting her, scolding her, begging her, but none of that worked. Finally, one day, she uploaded herself, leaving her father only a brief message:\n I\u2019m exhausted.\n Living up to your expectations is exhausting. Not living up to your expectations is also exhausting.\n Dad, Mom, I\u2019m sorry. Goodbye.\n As a matter of fact, Cheng Wen\u2019s story and the story of everyone else who uploads themselves are all basically same. She was an only child, no siblings, and no real friends. Every day, she obediently went to school, came home afterward, ate, then slept. Home and school were the cruxes supporting a finely wrought cage. For the child inside, it seemed like the entire world.\n Until one day, she became infatuated with the network.\n I understand the feeling. When you go on the net, information rushes at you like a flood. It tells you that this is the entire world. But when you leave the net, you feel the flood waters recede. You are still in the cage. You haven\u2019t moved even a tiny step. You want that world, to enter that world, to embrace this brand new heaven and earth. You, however, discover that reality, your body, the love of your family, all weigh you down like shackles in a prison.\n At a secret upload website, a sentence is written in red boldface on the home page: \u201cWhen exiling humanity from paradise, God said: I will give them love.\u201d This is the best yoke. As long as they are bound by love, they will never have a way back to paradise.\n This has spread among netizens. I don\u2019t know how many people try to shout from their cages. They want a new world. Actually, they are confused. A lot of people feel that the price of a new world is to lose everything in the old world. Who would make such a grave choice?\n But I understand those who uploaded themselves. The reason why you abandon yourself is really simple.\n Oh, yes. I understand.\n For example, Cheng Wen, what she wanted was nothing more than a comparatively relaxing life. A life where there\u2019s no pressure to do well on high-stakes school entrance exams.\n Another example, say there\u2019s a girl named Lin Yu. She uploaded herself because she firmly believed, in real life, she had not even one single redeeming feature. On the net, she kicked serious ass. What she did made the relatives who once thought of her as garbage respect her.\n But they were both wrong. The net is not the real world. They wouldn\u2019t open their eyes in the middle of a current of electricity. They just found a piece of solid earth, clear water, and blue sky. An abyss in the net is like an ocean. It swallows everybody who throws themselves in, cleansing them.\n What very few people realize: The deepest recesses of an abyss are incredibly difficult places for anyone, whether it\u2019s a program, spelunker, or Master Hacker, to reach. Huge and dismal existences hide there. It is a place where illegal data, uploaded consciousnesses, destroyed programs, and abandoned AI all mix together, lie dormant, and propagate. Some of the consciousnesses use uploaded human thoughts as a kernel. Some have only pieces of programs and evolve. They are immense, jumbled, all-embracing, and yet amount to nothing.\n They call themselves \u201cSea Spiders.\u201d\n Governments, of course, know Sea Spiders exist. They have rooted Sea Spiders out from their hiding places many times. Sea Spiders, however, are way smarter than any program, more nimble than any spelunker. They lurk like undercurrent in the net. Even the craftiest Master Hacker has a hard time detecting their existence. Because they are on the net, the likelihood of a self-reproducing consciousness is comparable to that of an infinite number of monkeys eventually typing out Hamlet. As a result, governments have adopted drastic measures. They\u2019ve banned completely the uploading of consciousnesses, classifying it as the most serious of crimes, giving it the harshest punishment.\n Of those who upload themselves, eighty percent of their consciousnesses are ripped to shreds by government web crawlers, ten percent are disintegrated into data packets, becoming rich fodder for Sea Spiders. The remaining ten percent become Sea Spiders themselves, roaming among the data, hiding from both governments and others of their own kind. They rip apart other consciousnesses to slake their thirst for data. They sniff out, even luring those who want to upload themselves, always alert to take over hollow bodies.\n But only one percent of Sea Spiders luck into the bodies fools abandon to upload themselves. Those Sea Spiders return to the real world.\n They are reincarnated in someone else\u2019s body.\n I suppose, perhaps at the time, the woman called Cheng Wen heard a whisper in the deep recesses of the net that enticed her, called her to go. She didn\u2019t know, though, that this first step wouldn\u2019t lead to rebirth, but to eternal damnation.\n Cheng Liang\u2019s hand trembles as he lights a cigarette. He tells me that one morning he opened the door to his daughter\u2019s room to see her in front of her computer, unwakeable and wearing a slight smile. He rushed her to the hospital. The doctor had to tell him: don\u2019t hold out any hope for her.\n Later, as a spur-of-the-moment test, he attached her stupefied body to the network and she suddenly woke up. But the person who woke was no longer the Cheng Wen from before.\n Cheng Liang enumerates exhaustively the ways she is different from before. I just let it wash over me. Because parents always have a keen intuition about their children, I believe him.\n Since everyone who intends to upload hides at least one Sea Spider afterward, they hide there silently, luring and agitating. Once the uploaded consciousness leaves the mind, they race to be first to seize the already soulless body and occupy it.\n As for the consciousness that leaves the body, her fate is up to one percent opportunity and ninety-nine percent luck. All she has to do is become a \u201cSea Spider,\u201d then follow in my footsteps to become a \u201cMaster Hacker,\u201d like I did. Easy peasy.\n Cheng Liang said that he received a text: Dad, find a Master Hacker. Help me.\n At the end of the text was my address. It was this text that made up his mind to admit his \u201cdaughter\u201d to the hospital. Then he held his nose and went to the neighborhood where I\u2019d rented an apartment.\n Nowhere to Return to\n By the time Professor Cheng finishes his endless narrative, it\u2019s already 4:00 a.m. My headache feels like it\u2019ll burst my head open. All sorts of random thoughts rush around and expand so that my ears buzz.\n I take two pills. They help not one bit. Pissed off, I take three more. I shut down my computer. My hands pressed against my head, I sway into the kitchen and dump some tepid water onto instant noodles. I eat the half-cooked noodles, then return to my room. My bed\u2019s not made. The blanket\u2019s still unfolded. I plow in, not bothering to take off my clothes, and flop into dreamland.\n It\u2019s not until 2:00 p.m. that I have the strength to crawl out of bed. I rub my face, grab some cash, then shop at the supermarket downstairs. Carrying bags and bags of snacks and cat food, I catch sight of a pay phone. A long while passes before I walk to it and dial a familiar number.\n \u201cHello. May I ask who are you looking for?\u201d\n \u201cMom, it\u2019s me, Xuejiao.\u201d\n Everything suddenly grows silent. Ages pass in silence. My hand trembles as I hold the handset. Not knowing where the courage is coming from, I wait and wait some more.\n \u201cXuejiao, where are you? You changed your number again?\u201d Mom says, finally finding the words.\n \u201cMy job\u2019s been transferred to Jiaxing.\u201d I lie. I lie like this every time. Actually, I suspect she\u2019s long since figured out what I\u2019m doing.\n \u201cJiaxing is a good neighborhood, Xuejiao. Work hard. Look after yourself . . . \u201d Mom\u2019s voice falls. \u201cWhen . . . come on home, just to visit.\u201d\n \u201cHm. Maybe for New Year\u2019s,\u201d I say.\n Every time I promise to come home for New Year\u2019s, every time I nestle myself in my apartment, cradling Aksha. Dry-eyed, I listen to the cold New Year\u2019s bells toll. What goes through my mind is that I\u2019m incapable of keeping my promise to my mom.\n When I return, Aksha sees how listless I am and jumps onto the table. \u201cDid you call your mom again?\u201d\n \u201cUgh.\u201d\n Aksha licks its paws. \u201cAren\u2019t you just looking to make yourself depressed?\u201d\n \u201cI am happy!\u201d I sulk at it in return.\n \u201cIf you want to cry, cry, Xuejiao.\u201d Aksha\u2019s tone implies a worldly experience undercut by the cat food stuck on its whiskers.\n Shrugging, I pick up a cash-filled envelope, count out two-thirds of the money, then split that in two.\n \u201cAre you going to post the money?\u201d\n \u201cOh, like always. Half goes to Mom, half to Auntie Zhou.\u201d I hide the cash in a pocket.\n Aksha licks my finger with its rough tongue. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take your medication before you go.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n After I return from the post office, Aksha and I gorge ourselves. We demolish everything I brought back from the supermarket. Then I sleep until the following morning.\n On the theory that I\u2019ll need a lot of energy and physical strength to look for a \u201cSea Spider,\u201d I take a full dose of antirejection medication. It makes me feel like I\u2019m sleepwalking. I shake off my blanket and change clothes. Having skipped combing my hair, washing my face, and brushing my teeth, I eat two eggs, drink a bag of milk, turn on my computer, and go online.\n Cheng Liang said that his daughter lost herself in the game Rivers and Lakes Unlimited. Moreover, he insisted that I go into the game to look for his daughter\u2019s consciousness. Instead, I do something much simpler. I find and follow the trail of uploaded packets on the computer.\n The trail breaks at the first node. That\u2019s not exactly a surprise. On the side, Aksha has already downloaded her game data and began to look for similarly skilled IDs in Rivers and Lakes Unlimited.\n \u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d it says. Scrubbed clean. They left behind fewer tracks than even the craftiest rat.\n Government databases also haven\u2019t captured any records of any data packets similar to consciousnesses. \u201cOr maybe those records been deleted,\u201d I reply.\n \u201cWhere else could there be clues?\u201d Aksha asks.\n \u201cAbysses,\u201d I answer. The deepest abysses.\n It\u2019s never been easy to find any Sea Spider, let alone a specific Sea Spider. Now there are two possibilities: his daughter became a Sea Spider herself or, even worse, Sea Spiders broke her up into splintered pieces of data and integrated them into many different consciousnesses. I adjust my gear and begin to search.\n Know this: \u201cjacking in\u201d and \u201cuploading\u201d feel nothing like each other. To use a particularly fitting metaphor, jacking your mind into the net is drifting along a river in a boat. Uploading your mind, however? Flinging yourself directly into the water. You have to master how to see, how to breathe, how to live in the water. Everything you know is turned completely on its head. Before you are swallowed, you have to make yourself a fish.\n After I think about it a bit, I decide to start from the game. If she liked this game so much, in her ignorance, she might have clutched at this desperate straw when she first entered the world of the net. Heading straight toward the game, I search between the node the trail broke at and the game\u2019s server node, not letting even the whisper of a clue pass me by.\n Clue one: September 2nd. That\u2019s the day she uploaded. Rivers and Lakes Unlimited District Three Server Six, a card machine appeared, was forcibly ejected, then disconnected.\n Clue two: Server Six is typically overloaded.\n Clue three: A tracking program was once run from here. Objective unknown. The server was located in Wuxi. That was the city I lived in until Cheng Liang scared me into moving.\n \u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d Aksha says.\n I dive in deep. The server has a series of storage areas. They are ingeniously scattered across different locations and linked together. As a whole, however, they are difficult for someone to find.\n In the mind-machine interface, I open the door.\n A range of golden mountains burn my eyes. Red and yellow leaves in a forest, mixed with the green of the pine. Late autumn frost smears the earth with a thin layer of white. The fields have already been harvested. Tall piles of corn lie at the edges. Golden kernels glint against the transparent, deep blue sky.\n \u201cDo you miss it? Xia Xuejiao, do you miss your home?\u201d a thin, reluctant voice asks.\n A young woman walks toward her from a low, flat-roofed house. It\u2019s Cheng Wen. With a tiny nose and round face, she is as adorable as a doll when she laughs. Her eyes, however, are black. They are as distant as the night sky and unfathomably haunted.\n \u201cOr perhaps I should call you Ji Cina?\u201d She begins to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, old friend.\u201d\n \u201c . . . Jill?\u201d I sputter and spit out the code name.\n The scenery around me suddenly begins to roil. It changes into countless flows of color, like a rainbow corridor. Aksha and I are at one end. Cheng Wen is at the other.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d She laughs and twirls. Her skirt flutters, becoming a beautiful flower. \u201cAfter I \u2018downloaded\u2019 my consciousness into this body, that stupid girl regretted abandoning her body. Actually, she shouldn\u2019t have tracked you down. And she shouldn\u2019t have sent your address to her father. If she had just continued to hide in that server, the computer I compromised in the mental hospital would have never found her.\u201d\n My heart aches.\n \u201cYou stole her body. Now, you\u2019ve eaten her consciousness?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cDon\u2019t get all noble on me.\u201d Her delicate face is ice cold. \u201cAre the things you\u2019ve done any better?\u201d\n \u201cHow much of you is still Cheng Wen?\u201d\n \u201cA lot. Almost forty percent.\u201d She gestures. \u201cWith so much data, why would I share it with anyone else? I tore her apart, ate her, and merged her data with mine. It still needs time to digest.\u201d\n I look her over. There is a familiar hunger and thirst in her serene eyes. Although every Sea Spider propagates across the consciousness of those who uploaded themselves, every Sea Spider also yearns to return to reality.\n \u201cYou want a body that much?\u201d I ask softly.\n \u201cYou have a body, yourself, but you stop others from getting one?\u201d She curls her lips. \u201cSo many Sea Spiders. They\u2019re all looking for bodies to the point of abducting them. When I saw this one, I took it. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n \u201cThe day you download yourself, it\u2019s not exactly a comfortable one.\u201d I laugh bitterly.\n \u201cAnd yet. I want . . . I want arms that can hug. I want eyes that can cry. I want a body. I want . . . \u201d She stays silent for a long time. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d\n When one Sea Spider swallows another Sea Spider, their personalities merge. In that moment, I can\u2019t tell them apart. The one who wants to go home, is it the one who has been flowing in the abyss for a long time, who long ago abandoned a corporeal existence? Or is it the girl who foolishly rushed into the net with no way to return?\n \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy,\u201d I say. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve stuffed the immense \u2018Sea Spider\u2019 consciousness into a brain, you\u2019ll have to take black-market drugs to prevent consciousness rejection for the rest of your life. Also, how are you going to leave the mental hospital?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she says.\n \u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I answer. \u201cI have one final question I want to ask.\u201d\n \u201cGo ahead.\u201d Jill\u2014Cheng Wen shrugs. \u201cQuickly. The nurses are making their rounds.\u201d\n \u201cYou said you want to go home. But to whose home? Jill Lenk\u2019s home in America, in Kansas? Or Cheng Wen\u2019s home in Shanghai?\u201d\n She\u2019s silent, dumbfounded for a long time. She raises her head then, disappointed, gazes at me with her black, serene eyes.\n \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n Satisfied, I laugh. Step-by-step, I leave this abyss. When it\u2019s time for me to break the connection, Jill\u2014Cheng Wen\u2019s sigh flutters in the distance.\n \u201cJi Cina, which home can you return to?\u201d\n A sharp pain pierces my chest. The javelin I hurt her with turned around and penetrated into my own feelings. Fragments of the city of fluttering, thin light rain in the midst of mansions and skyscrapers and the peaceful village within the range of snow-crested mountains twist together. They remain choked in my throat.\n \u201cMama . . . \u201d I mutter to myself.\n I have no idea who I\u2019m calling for. Lin Yu\u2019s mother or mine.\n Mother\n I was in college when I uploaded myself. A first-class fool at the time, I followed a man I had a crush on into the net. Only then did I realize I was no more than a tasty morsel of flesh. I have no idea what the man\u2019s sorry fate was. In the rush of data, I couldn\u2019t find any fragment of him or any tracks leading to him.\n I ran in the abyss, dodging government programs. At the same time, I was hiding from or killing my kind, swallowing their data to replenish myself. \u201cJi Cina\u201d was a name I adopted out of convenience. It means nothing to me. Just three syllables you squeeze out with your tongue pressed against your teeth, terse and fierce.\n Sea Spiders almost always break off contact completely with their new bodies\u2019 friends and relatives. However, I\u2019ve heard of those who could return to their former life. I don\u2019t know where the person who took my body went. Her trail ends in Australia. I\u2019ve been very careful, never entering that relatively unfamiliar section of the net.\n In the local net, for the longest time, Jill and I tangled with each other. We fought, trying to swallow each other. Ultimately, though, we set our boundaries, defining our spheres of influence. No one was more fierce and ruthless than I was. Crazed, I plundered all the data for a chance to return to the real world. In the fight among Sea Spiders for bodies, though, opportunities were fleeting.\n Until the day I met Aksha.\n Aksha was actually small and weak. Compared to our group of \u201cSea Spiders,\u201d it lacked mobility and flexibility. However, it wasn\u2019t encumbered by so much excess data. \u201cSea Spiders\u201d generally retain data about the body, ready, just in case, for that day when they returned to the real world. Since it\u2019s an AI, Aksha doesn\u2019t have any of that. It being in an abyss is like a stranded fish returned to the water. As if it were a rat aside our big elephant feet.\n It told me that it wanted a body. It, however, wasn\u2019t compatible with human bodies.\n \u201cI think I have a solution,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal.\u201d\n When a new consciousness emerged confused among us, with Aksha\u2019s help, I detoured around the chaotic fight. I penetrated directly into the empty brain.\n The rejection response was more violent than I\u2019d imagined. For a week after getting the body, I lay in a hospital bed, mournfully wailing through my mental and physical trial. It wasn\u2019t until Aksha brought me a fragment of consciousness it snatched from the net that my condition improved.\n Two days after I left the hospital, I found an excuse to leave the family of the woman called Lin Yu. From the black market, I stole a huge supply of antirejection drugs, an upload-download unit, as well as a yellow cat whose intelligence was augmented by a microchip.\n Since then, I\u2019ve brought Aksha along. We began our roving days.\n In these last few years, in my pocket is invariably hidden a letter. It was written by a mother to her daughter who was already never going to return.\n My dearest Yu:\n It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve heard any news of you.\n Mom knows you\u2019re doing your best out there, building your career. But since you can\u2019t come home for New Year\u2019s, you\u2019re never home at all.\n I miss you. Your father also speaks of you.\n You\u2019re an adult now. You should find a man to marry.\n This year, why don\u2019t you come back to Pudong for a short visit. Don\u2019t make us worry. You don\u2019t need to send us so much money. Your father\u2019s and my pensions are enough.\n Mom, Zhou Yun2075/1/26\n I raise my head. In the mirror is a healthy woman, wrinkled pajamas wrapped around her, unkempt hair, bluish-black eyes. A small mole dots the corner of my mouth.\n Every time I look at myself in the mirror I feel strange. It\u2019s as if Lin Yu\u2019s family in Shanghai, Lin Yu\u2019s mother, her taciturn father, not to mention the Shanghainese that I understand not one word of, they constantly warn me: I\u2019m actually a thief who stole someone else\u2019s body.\n The day I left Lin Yu\u2019s family, her mother opened an umbrella and saw me off to the end of the lane. She already realized by then that someone else\u2019s soul occupied Lin Yu\u2019s body, but she still smiled. She still tried to convince the incomplete likeness of her daughter to stay.\n She sent this letter four years ago to my first address. I moved immediately after. Drifting about, I\u2019ve never had any news of her. I never write my address on any money order I post. Frequently, though, I see the silhouette of her going from house to house knocking on doors, and I have no choice but to sneak out the back door in a rush.\n The Lin Yu who uploaded herself, the fragment I received of her is actually not very large. In my bones, I am still the \u201cSea Spider\u201d Xin Xuejiao. My mother is still the woman waiting in a small town in the Northeast Forest District. As for Lin Yu, I received her body, but not a way to love her family.\n Return Home, Return Home\n New Year\u2019s Eve, I carry Aksha with me to the train station. There\u2019s a missing person notice stuck to the station entrance. It rustles in the breeze.\n Missing Person Notice:Cheng Wen, female, 19 years old.Wearing a cream-colored sweater, white overcoat, black jeans. Long hair. Wears glasses.Disappeared on 2079/1/6.I hope a good-hearted person will provide a clue.I hope my daughter will return home.Father Cheng Liang weeping 2079/1/10.\n Speechless, I study the grainy picture printed on the notice. Cheng Wen\u2019s smile gives one a feeling of distance. Yet another Sea Spider who didn\u2019t realize until after returning to this world that there is nowhere to leave for, but also nowhere to return to.\n I laugh bitterly. Holding Aksha, I board the train back to my hometown in the Northeast.\n The hometown I left six years ago looks just like it used to. Tiny towns seem to freeze in time. Only the people who live in them slowly grow old. Clinging to a thread of hope, I plucked up my courage to return here.\n Auntie Zhou and Cheng Liang, they could realize someone else\u2019s consciousness lived in the body of their child. On the other hand, can my mother pierce through the Yin Yu exterior and see what I used to look like? Even if she hugs me, will she still call me Xuejiao?\n I put on my overcoat and pick up Aksha. The warmth of its body gives me a bit of courage.\n \u201cJust give it a go,\u201d it says.\n \u201cHm.\u201d\n I leave the hotel. The harsh northeast wind carves my face. On the road, at the edge of town, my mother is waiting for her daughter to return for New Year\u2019s.\n I muster my courage and walk toward my mom. It\u2019s been so many years since I\u2019ve seen her. She is old now. Her thick down jacket seems empty wrapped around her gaunt body. She is curled up against the cold wind, a pair of cloudy eyes stubbornly facing front, waiting for me to return home.\n I\u2019m back, Mom.\n I walk over. And I keep walking. Her gaze slides past my body. My steps grazed her. What she sees is an unfamiliar woman carrying a cat. Who I brush past is my mother.\n The wind and snow flutter, turning heaven and earth pure white. My mother and I are two tiny black dots on the white ground. The more I walk, the farther away I go. The more I walk, the farther away I go.\n I don\u2019t know how many bodies carry other peoples\u2019 souls. I don\u2019t know how many mothers wait in vain for their children to come home.\n You have eyes that can shed tears, but not necessarily eyes that can cry.\n You have arms that can hug, but not necessarily arms that can hug the people you love.\n Originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, May 2006.\n Translated and published in partnership with Storycom.\n John Chu is a microprocessor architect by day, a writer, translator, and podcast narrator by night.

It isn\u2019t human. Robotic and coldly electronic, it sounds like something conjured by the eeriest science fiction nightmare. Underneath it hovers a mechanical hum that might be the ambient noise of a spaceship, or an android brain, or even cyberspace. \u201cI have been programmed to dance,\u201d the voice goes on. Then it adds, with no small amount of ominousness, \u201cI am here to digitize you.\u201d A funky, machine-like beat kicks in, and the voice utters its sole commandment to the listener, one that leaves no room for disobedience: \u201cDANCE.\u201d\nThe song is titled \u201cMirda Rock,\u201d released as a 12-inch single in 1982. It was written, produced, and sung (through the voice-altering device known as the vocoder) by Reggie Griffin under the name Reggie Griffin & Technofunk. Griffin had made a name for himself that year as the synthesizer player on Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five\u2019s \u201cThe Message,\u201d the legendary hip-hop classic brimming with apocalyptic imagery. Griffin\u2019s synth bleeps and burbles futuristically\u2014and that futurism is magnified on \u201cMirda Rock,\u201d a miniature SF odyssey that just happens to be pressed on a record rather than printed on the page.\nGriffin may have threatened to digitize the listener but he was part of a wave of musicians in the early 1980s who were digitizing something far larger: funk. This movement became known as electro, and it flourished from around 1982 to 1985 thanks to the likes of Newcleus, Cybotron, Jonzun Crew, Warp 9, Quadrant Six, Project Future, and Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force.\nBut during that brief time, electro made a strong impact. Electro acts gathered up the Afrofuturism of certain \u201970s music\u2014most notably acts like Parliament-Funkadelic and Earth, Wind & Fire\u2014and mixed it with the emerging instrumental technology explored by the likes of Kraftwerk and Gary Numan. And they wrapped it all in outrageous, glittering costumes that drew from science fiction\u2019s camp tradition along with funk\u2019s flair for the flamboyant. The result not only influenced countless waves of musicians with its imaginative, innovative sounds, it paralleled the early-to-mid-\u201980s explosion in SF cinema, SF-themed video games, and the cyberpunk movement in literature\u2014as well as honoring Griffin\u2019s vision of the future as something both fearsome and danceable.\nElectro may have felt radical in the early \u201980s, but it didn\u2019t show up out of nowhere. Bandleader and icon Sun Ra began incorporating electric keyboards and what would later become known as Afrofuturism into his work as early as the 1950s, when his cosmic vision of jazz first gazes toward the stars\u2014and when he began dressing in glittery robes that bridged ancient Egypt and the world of tomorrow. His science fiction film from 1974, Space Is the Place, would turn out to be vastly influential to electro.\nThe advancement of the synthesizer in the \u201970s, when the instruments started to become smaller, cheaper, and more accessible, led to its increasing use in all kinds of popular music, funk included. The late Bernie Worrell of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective was one of many funk keyboardists in the \u201970s who coaxed space-age noises out of synthesizers\u2014only in Worrell\u2019s case, he was abetting P-Funk leader George Clinton, a man who shared many cosmic viewpoints and sartorial choices with Sun Ra. \u201cIf we can\u2019t be free on Earth, then we\u2019ll find liberation elsewhere in the galaxy,\u201d is how writer JS Rafaeli summed up Clinton\u2019s ethos, and that\u2019s borne out in his songs: They\u2019re infused with a powerful Afrofuturist vision of protest, hope, intergalactic mythology, and cartoon-sized fun.\nThroughout the \u201970s, other artists besides P-Funk helped lay the groundwork for electro. In 1977\u2014the year Star Wars helped popularize science fiction to a level that had never been seen before\u2014funk veterans War released the song \u201cGalaxy,\u201d complete with laser-beam sound effects and a mandate to escape Earth \u201con a rocket ship, no time to wait / I just want to gravitate.\u201d That same year, Earth, Wind & Fire recorded \u201cJupiter,\u201d which speculated about an alien visitation\u2014likely influenced by another SF blockbuster from 1977, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And Herbie Hancock\u2019s pioneering \u201970s output with the Headhunters\u2014especially the 1973 song \u201cChameleon\u201d\u2014helped push funk into weird, exciting new dimensions.\nA similar space-funk vibe ran through subsequent songs like Slave\u2019s voice-modulated \u201cStellar Fungk\u201d and Marvin Gaye\u2019s sprawling \u201cA Funky Space Reincarnation,\u201d both from 1978. (The latter even mentioned Star Wars by name.) In that same year, the German/Caribbean group Boney M. issued \u201cNightflight to Venus,\u201d a song about interplanetary travel that opens with a robotically-voiced countdown to liftoff. Curtis Knight\u2014an R&B veteran who once counted a young Jimi Hendrix as one of his sidemen\u2014clocked in with a record titled \u201cUFO\u201d which was an oddity on its release in 1979: \u201cLooked inside, now I know / A UFO is a high-flying disco,\u201d Knight sings, telling an entire epic story about his ride on a flying saucer. Really, though, \u201cUFO\u201d was just a couple years ahead of its time, as it presaged the clipped, sculpted electronic sound, computer-blip effects, and hip-hop slant of electro. And of course, Clinton and crew unleashed numerous SF-themed songs that decade, most notably 1975\u2019s \u201cMothership Connection (Star Child).\u201d\n\u201cMirda Rock\u201d came out in 1982, just as three science fiction films hit the silver screen and helped spark the electro movement: Blade Runner, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Tron. Like Stars Wars and Close Encounters before them, these three films solidified SF\u2019s hold on the pop-culture consciousness. But they also ignited the imaginations of what would become electro\u2019s first wave. Leading the pack was Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force, whose \u201cPlanet Rock\u201d became electro\u2019s blueprint and rallying cry in 1982. Bambaataa\u2014whose accomplishments have been overshadowed by recent sexual abuse allegations\u2014was a pioneer of hip-hop as a DJ in the late \u201970s, but \u201cPlanet Rock\u201d pushed him to the forefront of the emerging electro scene. Befitting its title, the song drew from a global palette of electronic-music influences\u2014England\u2019s Gary Numan, Japan\u2019s Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Germany\u2019s Kraftwerk, whose 1977 milestone \u201cTrans Europe Express\u201d was echoed in \u201cPlanet Rock\u201d\u2014while fusing those icy, futuristic sounds with the deep pulse of funk. And like Clinton and Sun Ra before him, Bambaataa dressed in lavish costumes that tapped into Afrofuturism\u2019s time-warping scope.\nThe popular obsession with androids, aliens, and computers helped \u201cPlanet Rock\u201d find a ready audience, but Bambaataa himself took inspiration from older sources: the SF of his childhood, namely Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Star Trek, and Lost in Space. He wasn\u2019t the only one. In 1983, a group called Jonzun Crew released an album called Lost in Space. Not only did it pay homage to the beloved, robot-starring SF show of the \u201960s, it upped the ante for electro. Awash in vocoder-filtered vocals, jerky funk, and sleek synthesizers, the album\u2019s songs steeped themselves in SF tropes, from \u201cSpace Cowboy\u201d to \u201cGround Control\u201d to \u201cSpace Is the Place\u201d\u2014the last of the three proudly referencing Sun Ra\u2019s Afrofuturist SF film from a decade earlier.\nJonzun Crew wasn\u2019t alone when it came to that reference. In 1983, the project Warp 9 issued the single \u201cLight Years Away.\u201d Along with its overt space-travel theme\u2014and SF-fusion lyrics like \u201cFunk rays in the alleyways / Like laser beams they rock my dreams\u201d\u2014the song features the refrain, \u201cSpace Is the Place.\u201d In the early \u201980s, electro took on a political bent, even when not openly political; the movement\u2019s Afrofuturist message was inclusive, pointing toward a better place for humanity beyond the stars, or even here on Earth, if Homo sapiens were able to harness technology as coolly as electro artists did drum machines, synthesizers, and vocoders.\nStill, there\u2019s no mistaking the confrontational nature of electro. As Kodwo Eshun said in his book More Brilliant Than the Sun: Adventures in Sonic Fiction, \u201cInstead of using synthesizer tones to emulate string quartets, electro deploys them inorganically, unmusically. The synthesizer becomes a sound weapon.\u201d Even the vocoder, initially devised to encrypt messages for military purposes, had a tone that was both scary and thrilling\u2014reminiscent of Colossus, the malevolent, monotone, vocoder-voiced supercomputer of the 1970 film Colossus: The Forbin Project (and even Darth Vader, despite the fact that vocoders were not applied to James Earl Jones\u2019 delivery in the Star Wars films). The vocoder even hinted at posthumanity, creating a hybridized, cyborg-like voice that was as empowering as it was formidable.\nScores of other electro artists released music during the genre\u2019s heyday of 1982 through 1984. The band names and titles alone sound like something pulled straight from the ascendant trend of cyberpunk literature, which hit critical mass in 1984 with the publication of William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer: \u201cCosmic Cars\u201d by Cybotron, \u201cBody Mechanic\u201d by Quadrant Six, \u201cWe\u2019re Rocking the Planet\u201d by Hashim, \u201cRay-Gun-Omics\u201d by Project Future, \u201cArcade Lover\u201d by Project Future, and the group Newcleus, who delivered one of electo\u2019s greatest anthems with a song titled, not coincidentally, \u201cSpace Is the Place,\u201d in which a female singer assures, \u201cI\u2019ll be your cosmic tour guide on this trip through the galaxy.\u201d Even some of the artists who had laid the groundwork for electro in the \u201970s got in on the act: In 1982, George Clinton released the electro-leaning album Computer Games, and in 1983, Herbie Hancock\u2019s single \u201cRockit\u201d\u2014aided by its captivating, robot-heavy music video\u2014beamed electro into the homes of millions, going gold in the process. \u201cRockit\u201d marked the commercial peak of electro, and also the end of its first wave.\nAlthough the music has experienced numerous revivals since then, the sheer inventiveness, imagination, and ingenuity of \u201980s electro has rendered it timeless\u2014and popularized Afrofuturism for an entire generation. As Rafaeli wrote, \u201cThe action heroes of the old sci-fi films may have been entirely white, but the stars of what became known as Afrofuturism weren\u2019t just interested in passively watching these stories on the screen; they created their own mythology, embodying dazzling psychedelic, utopian personas and creating some of the coolest, weirdest music of the 20th century in the process.\u201d The pioneers of electro hacked funk\u2019s DNA, rewiring popular music for a brave, new future.\nJason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

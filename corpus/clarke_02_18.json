This year, we\u2019re doing it a bit differently and running it more like a traditional two-round genre award.\n Phase 1 - Nominations (completed)\n At the end of January, we opened and held the twenty-four hour flash nomination period to identify the top five candidates in each category: story and art. The announcement was sent out via Twitter, Facebook, Patreon, and my blog. The brevity of this phase was an experiment. In theory, it would create a sense of urgency and reduce the opportunities for a coordinated ballot-stuffing campaign. It worked. The nomination phase generated more responses than the majority of our full surveys from years past and a significant reduction in stuffing\u2014though there were some very clumsy attempts to do so, of course.\n In any case, after tallying the votes, I\u2019m pleased to announce this year\u2019s finalists.\n Best Story\n \n \u201cA Series of Steaks\u201d by Vina Jie-Min Prasad (January)\n \u201cWaiting Out the End of the World in Patty\u2019s Place Cafe\u201d by Naomi Kritzer (March)\n \u201cAn Account of the Sky Whales\u201d by A Que (June)\n \u201cThe Secret Life of Bots\u201d by Suzanne Palmer (September)\n \u201cWho Won the Battle of Arsia Mons?\u201d by Sue Burke (November)\n \n Best Cover Art\n \n Waste Pickers by Gabriel Bjork Stiernstrom (January)\n Jungle Deep by Sergei Sarichev (March)\n Sea Change by Matt Dixon (June)\n Homecoming 2 by Jonas De Ro (November)\n Eistibus, Angel of Divination by Peter Mohrbacher (December)\n \n Phase 2 - Final Voting (open now through 11:59pm EST, February 24, 2018)\n This month, you will pick the winners from the top five finalists.

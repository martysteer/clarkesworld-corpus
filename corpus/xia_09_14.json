Friends, family, relatives, colleagues\u2014he had to reserve thirty tables at the restaurant.\nLao Zhang\u2019s wife was a bit distressed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even invite this many people to our wedding!\u201d she said.\nLao Zhang pointed out that this was one of those times where they had to pull out all the stops. You only get one zhuazhou in your entire life, after all. Back when they had gotten married, money was tight for both families. But, after working hard for the last few years, they had saved up. Now that their family was complete with a child, it was time for a well-planned party to show everyone that they were moving up in the world.\n\u201cRemember why we\u2019re working hard and saving money,\u201d said Lao Zhang. \u201cFor the first half of our lives, we worked for ourselves. But now that we have him, everything we do will be for his benefit. Get ready to spend even more money as he grows up.\u201d\nOn the child\u2019s birthday, most of the invited guests showed up. After handing over their red envelopes, the guests sat down to enjoy the banquet. Although everything in the world seemed to be turning digital, the red envelopes were still filled with actual cash\u2014that was the tradition, and real money looked better. Lao Zhang\u2019s wife had borrowed a bill counter for the occasion, and the sound of riffling paper was pleasing to the ear.\nFinally, after all the guests had arrived, Lao Zhang came out holding his son. The toddler was dressed in red from head to toe, and there was even a red dot painted right between his eyebrows. Everyone exclaimed at the handsome little boy:\n\u201cSuch a big and round head! Look at those perfect features!\u201d\n\u201cSo clever and smart!\u201d\n\u201cI can already see he\u2019s going to have a brilliant future.\u201d\nThe boy didn\u2019t disappoint. Even with so many people around, he didn\u2019t cry or fuss. Instead, he sat in the high chair and laughed, reminding people of the New Year posters depicting little children holding big fish, symbolizing good fortune.\n\u201cHow about we say a few words to all these uncles and aunties and wish them good luck?\u201d Lao Zhang said.\nThe boy raised his two chubby little hands, held them together, and slowly chanted, \u201cHappy New Year, uncleses and aunties . . . fish you pro-perity!\u201d\nEveryone laughed and congratulated the child for his intelligence and the Zhangs for their effective early education.\nThe auspicious hour finally arrived, and Lao Zhang turned on the machine. Sparkling bits of white light drifted down from the ceiling and transformed into various holograms that surrounded Lao Zhang and his son, in the middle of the banquet hall. Lao Zhang pulled one of the holograms next to his son\u2019s high chair, and the child eagerly reached out to touch it. A red beam of light scanned across the little fingers\u2014once the fingerprints were matched, he was logged into his account.\nA line of large red characters appeared in the air\u2014You\u2019re One!\u2014accompanied by an animated choir of angels singing Happy Birthday to You. After the song, a few lines of text appeared:\nZhuazhou is a custom in the Jiangnan region. When a baby has reached one year of age, the child is bathed and dressed in fresh clothes. Then the child is presented with various objects: bow, arrow, paper, and brush for boys; knife, ruler, needle, and thread for girls\u2014plus foods, jewels, clothes, and toys. Whatever the child chooses to play with is viewed as an indication of the child\u2019s character and abilities.\nLao Zhang looked up at the words and felt a complex set of emotions. My son, the rest of your beautiful life is about to start. His wife, also overcome by emotion, moved closer and the two leaned against each other, holding hands.\nUnfortunately, although the Zhangs had begun the baby\u2019s education before he had even been born, the boy still couldn\u2019t read. He waved his hand excitedly through the air, and pages of explanatory text flipped by. The end of the explanation was also the start of the formal zhuazhou ceremony, and everyone in the banquet hall quieted down.\nThe first holographic objects to appear were tiles for different brands of baby formula, drifting from the ceiling like flower petals scattered by some immortal. Lao Zhang knew that none of the brands were cheap: some were imported; some were one hundred percent organic with no additives; some were enhanced with special enzymes and proteins; some promoted neural development; some were recommended by pediatricians; some were bedecked with certifications . . . The choices seemed overwhelming.\nThe little boy, however, was decisive. He touched one of the tiles with no hesitation, and with a clink, the chosen tile tumbled into an antique ebony box set out below.\nNext came other baby foods: digestion aid, absorption promotion, disease prevention, calcium supplements, zinc supplements, vitamins, trace elements, immunity enhancement, night terror avoidance . . . in a moment, the son had made his choices among them as well. The colorful icons fell into the box, clinking and tinkling like pearls raining onto a jade plate.\nThen came the choices for nursery school, kindergarten, and extracurricular clubs. The little boy stared at the offerings with wide, bright eyes for a while, and finally picked woodcarving and seal cutting\u2014two rather unpopular choices. Lao Zhang\u2019s heart skipped, and his palms grew sweaty. He was just about to go up and make his son pick again when his wife stopped him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to try to make a living with that,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet him enjoy his hobby.\u201d\nLao Zhang realized that she was right and nodded gratefully. But his heart continued to beat wildly.\nThen the child had to pick his preschool, elementary school, elementary school cram sessions, junior high, junior high cram sessions, high school, and high school cram sessions. Then the choice to apply to colleges overseas appeared. Lao Zhang\u2019s heart once again tightened: he knew this was a good choice, but it would cost a lot more money, and it was difficult to imagine having his son thousands of miles away and not being able to protect him. Fortunately, the toddler barely glanced at the choice and waved it away.\nNext he had to select his college, decide whether afterward he wanted to go to grad school, to study overseas, or to start working, choose where he wanted to work and to settle, pick a house, a car, a spouse, the engagement present, the wedding banquet, the honeymoon destination, the hospital where their child would be born, the service center that would come and help\u2014that was as far as the choices would go, for now.\nAll that was left was to pick the years in which he would trade up his house, the years in which he would upgrade his car, the places he would go for vacations, the gym he would join, the retirement fund he would invest in, the frequent flier program he would sign up for. Finally, he picked a nursing home and a cemetery, and all was set.\nThe unselected icons hovered silently for a moment, and then gradually dimmed and went out like a sky full of stars extinguishing one after another. Flowers and confetti dropped from the ceiling, and celebratory music played. Everyone in the banquet hall cheered and clapped.\nIt took a while before Lao Zhang recovered, and he realized that he was soaked in sweat as though he had just emerged from a hot pool. He looked over at his wife, who was in tears. Lao Zhang waited patiently until she had calmed down a bit, and then whispered, \u201cThis is a happy occasion! Look at you . . . \u201d\nEmbarrassed, his wife wiped her wet face. \u201cLook at our son! He\u2019s so little . . . \u201d\nLao Zhang wasn\u2019t sure he really understood her, but he felt his eyes grow hot and moist again. He shook his head. \u201cThis way is good. Good! It saves us from so much worrying.\u201d\nAs he spoke, he began to do the calculations in his head. The total for everything his son had chosen was going to be an astronomical sum. He and his wife would be responsible for sixty percent of it, to be paid off over thirty years. The other forty percent would be the responsibility of his son once he started working, and of course there was their son\u2019s child, and the child\u2019s child . . .\nHe now had a goal to strive toward for the next few decades, and a warm feeling suffused him from head to toe.\nHe looked back at his son. The baby remained seated in the high chair, a bowl of hot noodles symbolizing longevity in front of him. His almost translucent cheeks were flushed as he smiled like the Laughing Buddha.\nNew Year\u2019s Eve\nLate at night, Wu was walking alone along the road. The street was empty and everything was quiet, interrupted occasionally by explosions from strings of firecrackers. The night before Chinese New Year was supposed to be spent with family, with everyone gathered around the dinner table, chatting, eating, watching the Spring Festival Gala on TV, enjoying a rare moment when the whole extended family could be together in one room.\nHe approached a park near home. It was even quieter here, without the daytime crowd of people practicing Tai Chi, strolling, exercising, or singing folk operas. An artificial lake lay quietly in the moonless night. Wu listened to the dull sound of gentle waves slapping against the shore and felt a chill through every pore in his skin. He turned toward a tiny pavilion next to the lake, but stopped when a dark shadow loomed before him.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d a shocked Wu asked.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\nThe voice sounded familiar to Wu. Suppressing his fright, he walked closer, and realized that the other person was Lao Wang, his upstairs neighbor.\nWu let out a held breath. \u201cYou really frightened me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing outside at this hour?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to take a walk . . . to relax. What are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cToo many people and too much noise at home. I needed a moment of peace,\u201d Lao Wang said.\nThe two looked at each other, and a smile of mutual understanding appeared on their faces. Lao Wang brushed off a nearby stone bench and said, \u201cCome, sit next to me.\u201d\nWu touched the stone, which was ice cold. \u201cThanks. I\u2019d rather stand for a bit. I just ate; standing is better for digestion.\u201d\nLao Wang sighed. \u201cNew Year\u2019s . . . the older you get, the less there is to celebrate.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth. You eat, watch TV, set off some firecrackers, and then it\u2019s time to sleep. A whole year has gone by, and you\u2019ve done nothing of note.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lao Wang said. \u201cBut that\u2019s how everyone spends New Year\u2019s. I can\u2019t do anything different all by myself.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Everybody in the family sits down to watch the Spring Festival Gala. I\u2019d like to do something different but I can\u2019t summon the energy. Might as well come out and walk around by myself.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t watched the Spring Festival Gala in years.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty impressive,\u201d Wu said.\n\u201cIt was easier in the past,\u201d Lao Wang said. \u201cSinging, dancing, a few stupid skits and it\u2019s over. But now they\u2019ve made it so much more difficult to avoid.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s technological progress, right? They\u2019ve developed so many new tricks.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind if they just stick to having pop stars do their acts,\u201d Lao Wang said. \u201cBut now they insist on this \u2018People\u2019s Participatory Gala\u2019 business. Ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cI can sort of see the point,\u201d said Wu. \u201cThe stars are on TV every day for the rest of the year. Might as well try something new for New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much for me, all this chaos. I\u2019d rather have a quiet, peaceful New Year\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cBut the point of New Year\u2019s is the festival mood,\u201d said Wu. \u201cMost people like a bit of noise and atmosphere. We\u2019re not immortals in heaven, free from all earthly concerns, you know?\u201d\n\u201cHa! I don\u2019t think even immortals up there can tolerate this much pandemonium down here.\u201d\nBoth men sighed and listened to the gentle sound of the lake. After a while, Lao Wang asked, \u201cHave you ever been picked for the Gala?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Twice. The first time they randomly picked my family during the live broadcast so that the whole family could appear on TV and wish everybody a happy new year. The second time was because one of my classmates had cancer. They picked him for a human-interest story, and the producer decided that it would be more tear-jerking to get the whole class and the teacher to appear with him. The Gala hosts and the audience sure cried a lot. I wasn\u2019t in too many shots, though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been picked,\u201d said Lao Wang.\n\u201cHow have you managed that?\u201d\n\u201cI turn off the TV and go hide somewhere. The Gala has nothing to do with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy go to so much trouble? It\u2019s not a big deal to be on TV for the Gala.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my nature,\u201d said Lao Wang. \u201cI like peace and quiet. I can\u2019t stand the . . . invasiveness of it.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little exaggerated?\u201d\n\u201cWithout notice, without consent, they just stick your face on TV so that everyone in the world can see you. How is that not invasive?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just for a few seconds. No one is going to even remember you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if having other people see you costs you anything.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. The point is I haven\u2019t agreed. If I agree, sure, I don\u2019t care if you follow me around with a camera twenty-four hours a day. But I don\u2019t want to be forced on there.\u201d\n\u201cI can understand your feeling,\u201d said Wu. \u201cBut it\u2019s not realistic. Look around you! There are cameras everywhere. You can\u2019t hide for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I go to places with no people.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit extreme.\u201d\nLao Wang laughed. \u201cI think I\u2019m old enough to deserve not having all my choices made for me.\u201d\nWu laughed, too. \u201cYou really are a maverick.\u201d\n\u201cHardly. This is all I can do.\u201d\nWhite lights appeared around them, turning into a crowd of millions of faces. In the middle of the crowd was a stage, brightly lit and spectacularly decorated. Lao Wang and Wu found themselves on the stage, and loud, festive music filled their ears. A host and a hostesss approached from opposite ends of the stage.\nA megawatt smile on his face, the host said, \u201cWonderful news, everyone! We\u2019ve finally found that mythical creature: the only person in all of China who\u2019s never been on the Spring Festival Gala! Meet Mr. Wang, who lives in Longyang District.\u201d\nThe hostess, with an even brighter smile, added, \u201cWe have to thank this other member of the audience, Mr. Wu, who helped us locate and bring the mysterious Mr. Wang onto the stage. Mr. Wang, on this auspicious, joyous night, would you like to wish everyone a happy new year and say a few words?\u201d\nLao Wang was stunned. It took a while for him to recover and turn to look at Wu. Wu was awkward and embarrassed, and he wanted to say something to comfort Lao Wang, but he wasn\u2019t given a chance to talk.\nThe host said, \u201cMr. Wang, this is the very first time you\u2019ve been on the Gala. Can you tell us how you feel?\u201d\nLao Wang stood up, and without saying anything, dove off the edge of the stage into the cold lake.\nWu jumped up, and his shirt was soaked with cold sweat. Blood drained from the faces of the host and the hostess. Multiple camera drones flitted through the night air, searching for Lao Wang in the lake. The millions of faces around them began to whisper and murmur, and the buzzing grew louder.\nSuddenly, a ball of light appeared below the surface of the lake, and with a loud explosion, a bright, blinding light washed out everything. Wu was screaming and rolling on the ground, his clothes on fire. Finally, he managed to open his eyes and steal a peek through the cracks between his fingers: amidst the blazing white flames, a brilliant, golden pillar of light rose from the lake and disappeared among the clouds. It must have been thousands of miles long.\nWhat the hell! thought Wu. Is he really going back up in heaven to enjoy his peace and quiet? Then his eyes began to burn and columns of hot smoke rose from his sockets.\nThe next day, the web was filled with all kinds of commentary. The explosion had destroyed all the cameras on site, and only a few fragmentary recordings of the scene could be recovered. Most of those who got to see the event live were in hospital\u2014the explosion had damaged their hearing.\nStill, everyone congratulated the Spring Festival Gala organizers for putting on the most successful program in the show\u2019s history.\nMatchmaking\nXiao Li was twenty-seven. After New Year\u2019s she\u2019d be twenty-eight. Her mother was growing worried and signed her up with a matchmaking service.\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d said Xiao Li. \u201cHow embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s embarrassing about it?\u201d said her mother. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t use a matchmaker, where would your dad be? And where would you be?\u201d\n\u201cThese services are full of . . . sketchy men.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than you can do on your own.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Li was incredulous. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThey have scientific algorithms.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you think science can guarantee good matches?\u201d\n\u201cStop wasting time. Are you going or not?\u201d\nAnd so Xiao Li put on a new dress and did her makeup, and followed her mom to a famous matchmaking service center. The manager at the service center was very enthusiastic, and asked Xiao Li to confirm her identity.\nXiao Li had no interest in being here and twisted around in her chair. \u201cIs this going to be a lot of trouble?\u201d\nThe manager smiled. \u201cNot at all. We have the latest technology. It\u2019s super fast.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking for all my personal information. Is it safe?\u201d\nThe manager continued to smile. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve been in business for years, and we\u2019ve never had any problems. Not a single client has ever sued us.\u201d\nXiao Li still had more questions, but her mother had had enough. \u201cHurry up! Don\u2019t think you can get out of this by dragging it out.\u201d\nXiao Li put her finger on the terminal so that her prints could be scanned, and then she had a retinal scan as well so that her personal information could be downloaded to the service center\u2019s database. Next, she had to do a whole-body scan, which took three minutes.\n\u201cAll set,\u201d said the manager. He reached into the terminal and pulled out a hologram that he tossed onto the floor. Xiao Li watched as a white light rose from the ground, and inside the light was a tiny figure about an inch tall, looking exactly like her and dressed in the same clothes.\nThe little person looked around herself and then entered a door next to her. Inside, there was a tiny table and two tiny chairs. A mini-man sat on one chair and after greeting mini-Xiao Li, the two started to talk. They spoke in a high-pitched, sped-up language and it was hard to tell what they were saying. Not even a minute later, mini-Xiao Li stood up and the two shook hands politely. Then mini-Xiao Li came out and entered the next door.\nXiao Li\u2019s mother muttered next to her. \u201cLet\u2019s see, if it takes a minute to get to know a guy, then you can meet sixty guys in an hour. After a day, you\u2026\u201d\nThe still-smiling manager said, \u201cOh, this is only a demonstration. The real process is even faster. You don\u2019t need to wait around, of course. We\u2019ll get you the results tomorrow, guaranteed.\u201d\nThe manager reached out and waved his hands. The miniature men and women in the white light shrank down even further until they were tiny dots. All around them were tiny cells like a beehive, and in each cell red and green dots twitched and buzzed.\nXiao Li could no longer tell which red dot was hers, and she felt uneasy. \u201cIs this really going to work?\u201d\nThe manager assured her. \u201cWe have more than six million registered members! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find your match.\u201d\n\u201cThese people are . . . reliable?\u201d\n\u201cEvery member had to go through a strict screening process like the one you went through. All the information on file is one hundred percent reliable. Our dating software is the most up to date, and any match predicted by the software has always worked out in real life. If you\u2019re not satisfied, we\u2019ll refund your entire fee.\u201d\nXiao Li still hesitated, but her mother said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Look at you\u2014now you\u2019re suddenly interested?\u201d\nThe next afternoon, Xiao Li got a call from the manager at the matchmaking center. He explained that the software had identified 438 possible candidates: all were good looking, healthy, reliable, and shared Xiao Li\u2019s interests and values.\nXiao Li was a bit shocked. More than four hundred? Even if she went on a date every day, it would take more than a year to get through them all.\nThe manager\u2019s smile never wavered. \u201cI suggest you try our parallel dating software and continue to get to know these men better. It takes time to know if someone will make a good spouse.\u201d\nXiao Li agreed and ten copies of mini-Xiao Li were made to go on dates with these potential matches.\nTwo days later, the manager called Xiao Li again. The ten mini-Xiao Lis had already gone on ten dates with each of the more than four hundred candidates, and the software had tracked and scored all the dates. The manager advised Xiao Li to aggregate the scores from the ten dates and keep only the thirty top-scorers for further consideration. Xiao Li agreed and felt more relaxed.\nThree days later, the manager told Xiao Li that after further contacts and observation, seven candidates had been eliminated, five were progressing slowly in their relationships with Xiao Li, and the remaining eighteen demonstrated reciprocal satisfaction and interest. Of these eighteen, eight had already revealed their intent to marry Xiao Li, and four had shown flaws\u2014in living habits, for instance\u2014but were still within the acceptable range.\nXiao Li was silent. After waiting for some time, the manager gently prodded her. \u201cIt might help to ask your mother to meet them\u2014after all, marriage is about two families coming together.\u201d\nThat\u2019s true. That day, Xiao Li brought her mom to the matchmaking center, and after her identity was verified, her mother was also scanned. As the dates continued, the ten mini-Xiao Lis had ten mini-moms to help as sounding boards and advisors.\nHer mom\u2019s participation was very helpful, and soon only seven candidates remained. The manager said, \u201cMiss Li, we also have software for simulating the conditions of preparing for a wedding. Why don\u2019t you try it? Many couples split up under the stress of preparing for their big day. Marriage is not something to rush into rashly.\u201d\nAnd so the seven mini-Xiao Lis began to discuss the wedding with the seven mini-boyfriends. Relatives of all the involved couples were scanned and entered the discussion; arguments grew heated. Indeed, two of the candidates\u2019 families just couldn\u2019t come together with Xiao Li\u2019s family, and they backed out.\nThe manager now said, \u201cWe also have software for simulating the honeymoon. A famous writer once said the way to know if a marriage will last is to see if the couple can travel together for a whole month without hating each other.\u201d\nSo Xiao Li signed up for simulated honeymoons. After that, there were simulated pregnancies, simulated maternity leaves\u2014one potential father who was only interested in holding the baby and paid no attention to Xiao Li was immediately eliminated.\nThen came the simulated raising of children, simulated affairs, simulated menopause and mid-life crises, followed by simulations of various life traumas: car accidents, disability, death of a child, dying parents . . . finally the couple had to lean against each other as they entered nursing homes. Happily ever after?\nIncredibly, two candidates still remained in consideration.\nXiao Li felt that after so much progress, she really had to meet these two men. The manager sent her the file on the first match, and an excited Xiao Li could feel her heart beating wildly. Just as she was about to open the file, however, a warning beep sounded, and the manager\u2019s face appeared in the air.\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Miss Li. This client was also going through the simulation with another potential match, and half a minute ago, the results came out, indicating an excellent match. Given the delicacy of the situation and to avoid . . . future regrets, I suggest you not meet him just yet.\u201d\nXiao Li felt as though she had lost something. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this earlier?\u201d\n\u201cThe whole process is automated for privacy protection. Even our staff can\u2019t monitor or intervene. But don\u2019t worry! You still have another great match.\u201d\nXiao Li admitted that advanced technology really was reliable.\nShe opened the file for the other match and saw his face for the first time. She felt dizzy, as though the years in their future had been compressed into this moment, concentrated, intense, overwhelming. She felt herself growing light, like a cloud about to drift into the sky.\nShe heard the voice of the manager. \u201cMiss Li? Are you satisfied with our program? Would you like to arrange an in-person meeting?\u201d\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d said Xiao Li.\nShe showed the manager the picture. He was speechless.\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Xiao Li blushed. \u201cWhat is your name, actually?\u201d\n\u201cYou can call me Xiao Zhao.\u201d\nA month later, Xiao Li and Xiao Zhao were married.\nReunion\nYang was home from college for the Spring Festival break. Liu, a high school classmate, called to say that since it had been ten years since their graduation, he was organizing a reunion.\nYang hung up and felt nostalgic. Has it really been ten years?\nThe day was foggy and it was impossible to see anything outside the window. Yang called Liu to ask if the reunion was still on.\n\u201cOf course! The fog makes for a better atmosphere, actually.\u201d\nYang got in his car and turned on the fog navigation system. The head-up display on the windshield marked the streets and cars and pedestrians, even if he couldn\u2019t see them directly. He arrived at the gates of his old high school safely and saw that many cars were already parked along the road, some were more expensive than his, others cheaper. Yang put on the fog mask and stepped out of the car. The mask filtered the air, and the eyepiece acted as a display, allowing him to see everything hidden by the fog. He looked around and saw that the entrance to the high school was the same as he remembered: iron grille gates, a few large gilt characters in the red brick walls. The buildings and the lawn inside hadn\u2019t changed either, and as a breeze passed through, he seemed to hear the rustling of holly leaves.\nYang passed through the classroom buildings and came onto the exercise ground, where everyone used to do their morning calisthenics. A crowd was gathered there, conversing in small groups. Just about everyone in his class had arrived. Although they all wore masks, glowing faces were projected onto the masks. He examined them: most of the faces were old photographs taken during high school. Soon, a few of his best friends from that time gathered around him, and they started to talk: Is he still in grad school? Where is he working? Has he gotten married? Has he bought a house? The words and laughter flowed easily.\nJust then, they heard a voice coming from somewhere elevated. They looked up and saw that Liu had climbed onto the rostrum. Taking a pose like their old principal, he spoke into a mike, sounding muffled: \u201cWelcome back to our alma mater, everybody. The school is being renovated this winter, and most of the classrooms have been dismantled. That\u2019s why we have to make do with the exercise ground.\u201d\nYang was startled, and then he realized that the buildings he had passed through earlier were also nothing more than projections of old photographs. Remembering the old room where he had studied, the old cafeteria where he had eaten, and the rooftop deck where he had secretly taken naps, he wondered if any of them had survived.\nLiu continued, \u201cBut this exercise ground holds a special meaning for our class. Does anyone remember why?\u201d\nThe crowd was quiet. Pleased with himself, Liu lifted up something covered by a cloth. He raised his voice. \u201cWhile they were renovating the exercise ground, one of the workers dug up our memory capsule. I checked: it\u2019s intact!\u201d\nHe pulled off the cloth with an exaggerated motion, revealing a silver-white, square box. The crowd buzzed with excited conversation. Yang could feel his heart pounding as memories churned in his mind. At graduation, someone had suggested that each member of the class record a holographic segment, store all the recordings in a projector, and bury it under one of the trees at the edge of the exercise ground, to be replayed after ten years. This was the real reason Liu had organized the reunion.\n\u201cDo you remember how we had everyone say what they wanted to achieve in the future?\u201d Liu asked. \u201cNow that it\u2019s been ten years, let\u2019s take a look and see if anyone has realized their dream.\u201d\nThe crowd grew even more excited and started to clap.\n\u201cSince I\u2019m holding the box, I\u2019ll start,\u201d Liu said.\nHe placed his hand against the box, and a small blue light came to life, like a single eye. A glowing light appeared above the box, and after a few flickers, resolved into an eighteen-year-old version of Liu.\nEveryone gazed up at this youthful image of their friend and what he had chosen to remember from their high school years: there was Liu running for class president, receiving an academic and service award, representing the school on the soccer team, scoring a goal, organizing extracurricular clubs, leading his supporters in his campaign, losing the election, hearing words of encouragement from teachers and friends so that he could redouble his effort, tearfully making a speech: \u201cAlma Mater, I\u2019ll remember you always. I will make you proud of me!\u201d\nAnd then, the young Liu said, \u201cIn a decade, I will have an office facing the sea!\u201d\nThe light dimmed like a receding tide. The real Liu took out his phone and projected a photograph in the air: this much more mature Liu, in a suit and tie, sat behind a desk and grinned at the camera. A deep blue sea and a sky dotted with some clouds, pretty as a postcard, could be seen through the glass wall behind him.\nA wave of applause. Everyone congratulated Liu on achieving his dream. Yang clapped along, but something about the scene bothered him. This didn\u2019t seem like a reunion\u2014it was more like reality TV. But Liu had already come down from the rostrum and handed the box to someone else. Another glowing light appeared above them, and Yang couldn\u2019t help but look up with the crowd.\nAnd so they looked at old memories: classes, tests, the flag-raising ceremony, morning exercises, being tardy, being let out of school, study hall, skipping classes, fights, smoking, breaking up . . . followed by old dreams: finding love, jobs, vacations, names, names of places, names of objects. Finally, he saw himself.\nThe short-cropped hair and scrawny, awkward body of his teenaged self embarrassed him, and he heard his own raspy voice: \u201cI want to be an interesting person.\u201d\nHe was stunned. What had made him say such a thing back then? And how could he have no memory of saying it? But the crowd around him applauded enthusiastically and laughed, praising him for having had the audacity to say something unique.\nHe passed the box onto the next person, and he could feel his temples grow sweaty in the fog. He wanted this farce to be over so he could drive home, take off the mask, and take a long, hot bath.\nA woman spoke next to him\u2014he seemed to recognize the voice. He looked over. Ah, it was Ye, who had sat at the same desk with him throughout their three years in high school.\nHe didn\u2019t know Ye well. She was an average girl in every way: not too pretty, not too not pretty, not too smart, not too not smart. He searched through his memories and recalled that she liked to laugh, but because her teeth weren\u2019t very even, she looked a bit goofy when laughing. He recalled other bits and pieces about her: her odd gestures, her habit of doodling in their textbooks, the way she would sometimes close her eyes and press her hands against her temples and mutter. He had never asked her what she was muttering about.\nHe heard the eighteen-year-old Ye saying in an even, calm voice, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a dream. I have no idea where I\u2019ll be in ten years.\n\u201cI\u2019m envious of each and every one of you. I\u2019m envious that you can dream of a future. Before you had even been born, your parents had started to plan for your future. As long as you follow those plans and don\u2019t make big mistakes, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\u201cBefore I was born, the doctors discovered that I had a hereditary disease. They thought I wouldn\u2019t live beyond my twentieth year. The doctors advised my mother to terminate the pregnancy. But my mother wouldn\u2019t listen to them. It became a point of friction between my parents, and eventually, they divorced.\n\u201cWhen I was very little, my mother told me this story. She also said, Daughter, you\u2019re going to have to rely on yourself for the rest of your life. I don\u2019t know how to help you. She also said that she would never help me make my decisions, whether it was where I wanted to play, who I wanted to be friends with, what books I wanted to buy, or what school I wanted to go to. She said that she had already made the most important decision for my life: to give birth to me. After that, whatever I decided, I didn\u2019t need her approval.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I have. Maybe I\u2019ll die tomorrow, maybe I\u2019ll eke out a few more years. But I still haven\u2019t decided what I have to get done before I die. I\u2019m envious of everyone who\u2019ll live longer than I because they\u2019ll have more time to think about it and more time to make it come true.\n\u201cBut there are also times when I think it makes no difference whether we live longer or shorter.\n\u201cActually, I do have dreams, many dreams. I dream of flying in a spaceship; dream of a wedding on Mars; dream of living for a long, long time so that I can see what the world will be like in a thousand, ten thousand years; dream of becoming someone great so that after I die, many people will remember my name. I also have little dreams. I dream of seeing a meteor shower; dream of having the best grade, just once, so that my mother will be happy for me; dream of a boy I like singing a song for me on my birthday; dream of catching a pickpocket trying to steal a wallet on the bus and having the courage to rush up and seize him. Sometimes, I even realize one of my dreams, but I don\u2019t know if I should be happy, don\u2019t know if I died the next day, whether I would feel that was enough, that my life was complete, perfect, and that I had no more regrets.\n\u201cI dream of seeing all of you in ten years, and hear what dreams you\u2019ve realized.\u201d\nShe disappeared. The light dimmed bit by bit.\nA moment of quiet.\nSomeone shouted, \u201cBut where is she?\u201d\nYang looked down and saw that the silvery-white box was lying on the ground, surrounded by the tips of pairs of shoes. He looked around: all the faces on the masks flickered, but he couldn\u2019t tell who was who for a moment.\nThe crowd erupted.\n\u201cWhat the hell? A ghost?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s playing a joke!\u201d\n\u201cWe went to school together for three years and I\u2019d never heard her mention any of this. Who knows if it\u2019s true or not?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of any strange disease like that.\u201d\nThe discussions led nowhere, and they couldn\u2019t find Ye. The reunion came to an end without a conclusion.\nAfter dinner and some drinks, Yang drove home by himself. The fog was still heavy, and the passing, varicolored lights dissolved in the fog like pigment. He fell asleep as soon as he was in bed, but he woke up around midnight.\nHe was seized by a nameless terror, and he was sure that he would not see the sun rise again, that he would die during his sleep. He recalled his life, thinking about the ten years since high school that had passed far too quickly. He had once thought life rather good, like a flowery, splendid scroll, but now a rip had been torn in it, and inside was darkness, a bottomless darkness. He had fallen into a chasm from the sky, and inside the chasm was only a lightless fog. All he could see was the nothingness behind the scroll.\nHe curled up in the fetal position and sobbed, and he vomited his dinner onto his pillow.\nThe fog was gone in the morning. Yang got up and looked at the clear sky outside.\nHe felt refreshed, and the unpleasantness of the previous day was forgotten.\nThe Birthday\nGrandma Zhou was almost ninety-nine, and the family planned a big celebration. But just as everything was about ready, Grandma Zhou slipped and fell in the bathroom, fracturing her foot. Although she was rushed to the hospital right away and the injury wasn\u2019t serious, it still made it hard for her to get about. She had to stay in a wheelchair all day, and she felt depressed.\nThe evening sky was overcast, and Grandma Zhou napped in her room by herself. Knocking noises woke her up. Raising her sleepy eyes, she saw a figure in a white dress floating in midair, indistinct, like an immortal.\n\u201cIs something happening, Young Lady?\u201d\nYoung Lady wasn\u2019t a person, but the nursing home\u2019s service program. Grandma\u2019s eyesight was no longer so good, and she couldn\u2019t tell what Young Lady looked like. But she always thought she sounded like her granddaughter.\n\u201cGrandma Zhou,\u201d said Young Lady, \u201cyour family is here to celebrate your birthday!\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to celebrate? The older you grow, the more you suffer.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that. The young people are here because they love you. They want you to live beyond a hundred!\u201d\nGrandma Zhou was still in a bad mood, but Young Lady said, \u201cIf you keep on frowning like that, your children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren will think I haven\u2019t been taking good care of you.\u201d\nGrandma Zhou thought Young Lady had taken very good care of her\u2014in fact, she did it about as well as her real granddaughter. Her heart softened, and a smile appeared on her face.\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d said a grinning Young Lady. \u201cAll right, get ready to celebrate!\u201d\nBright lights came out of the floor and transformed the room. Grandma Zhou found herself inside a hall decorated in an antique style with red paper lanterns and red paper Longevity characters pasted on the walls. She was dressed in a red jacket and red pants custom made for her and sat in a carved purpleheart longevity chair, while all the guests around her also wore red. Grandma Zhou couldn\u2019t see their faces clearly, but she could hear the laughter and joyous conversations, and the noise of firecrackers going off outside was constant.\nHer oldest son approached first with his family to wish her a happy birthday. There were more than a dozen people, and, after sorting themselves by generation and age, they knelt to kowtow. Grandma Zhou smiled at the children: boys, girls, some dark skinned, some fair skinned, and she had trouble saying some of their names. A few of the children were shy, and hid behind their parents to peek at her without speaking. Others were bolder, and they spoke to her in some foreign language instead of Chinese, making the adults laugh. There was also a little child curled up asleep in her mother\u2019s lap, and the mother smiled, saying, \u201cGrandma, I\u2019m really sorry. It\u2019s about five in the morning in our time zone.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said Grandma Zhou. \u201cChildren need their rest.\u201d\nIt took almost a quarter of an hour for the members of her oldest son\u2019s family to offer her their good wishes one by one.\nThen came the family of her second son, her older daughter, her younger daughter . . . then the friends who had gone to school with her, friends from the army, the students she had taught over the years, in-laws, distant relatives . . .\nGrandma Zhou had been sitting up for a long while, and her eyes were feeling tired and her throat parched. But she knew it was difficult for so many people to make time to attend her party, and so she forced herself to keep on nodding and smiling. Advanced technology is really wonderful; it would be so much harder for them to do this in person.\nAs she watched all the guests milling about the hall, she felt very moved. So many people around the globe, divided by thousands of miles, were here because of her. After all the miles she had walked and all the things she had experienced and done, she had connected all these people, many of them strangers to each other, into a web. She felt fortunate to be ninety-nine; not many people made it this far.\nA figure dressed in white drifted over to her. At first she thought it was Young Lady again, but the figure knelt down and held her hand.\n\u201cGrandma, sorry I\u2019m late. The traffic was bad.\u201d\nGrandma Zhou squeezed the hands; the skin felt a bit cold, but the hands were solid. She squinted to get a closer look. It was her granddaughter who was studying overseas.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cTo wish you a happy birthday, of course.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re actually here? Really here?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d said Grandma Zhou.\nHer granddaughter smiled. \u201cNot that far. Not even a full day by plane.\u201d\nGrandma Zhou looked her granddaughter up and down. She looked tired, but seemed to be in good spirits. Grandma Zhou smiled.\n\u201cIs it cold outside?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said the granddaughter. \u201cThe moon is lovely tonight. Would you like to see it?\u201d\n\u201cBut there are still so many people here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy to take care of,\u201d said the granddaughter.\nShe waved her hands, and a replica of Grandma Zhou appeared. The replica was dressed in the same red jacket and red pants, and sat in the carved purpleheart longevity chair. The guests in the hall continued to come up in waves, wishing her many years of long life and happiness.\n\u201cAll right, Grandma, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nThe granddaughter pushed the wheelchair through the empty corridor of the nursing home until they were in the yard. There was a vigorous shantao tree in the middle of the yard, and to the side were a few wintersweet bushes, whose fragrance wafted on the breeze. The sky had cleared, revealing the full moon. Grandma Zhou looked at the plants in the garden and then at her granddaughter, standing tall and lovely next to her like a young poplar. Nothing makes you realize how old you are as seeing your children\u2019s children all grown up.\nA few other residents of the nursing home were sitting under the tree, playing erhu and singing folk operas. They saw Grandma Zhou and invited her to join them.\nGrandma Zhou blushed like a little girl. \u201cI have no talent for this sort of thing at all! I\u2019ve never learned to play an instrument, and I can\u2019t sing.\u201d\nLao Hu, who was playing the erhu, said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a few of us old timers trying to entertain ourselves, not the Spring Festival Gala! Lao Zhou, just perform anything you like, and we\u2019ll cheer you on. Wouldn\u2019t that be a nice way to celebrate your birthday?\u201d\nGrandma Zhou pondered this for a while, and said, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll chant a poem for you.\u201d\nHer father had taught her how to chant poems when she was little, and her father had learned from his tutor, back before the founding of the People\u2019s Republic. Back then, when children studied poetry, they didn\u2019t read it or recite it, but learned to chant along with the teacher. This was how they learned the rhythm and meter of poetry, the patterns of rhyme and tone. It was closer to singing than reading, and it sounded better.\nThe others quieted to listen. The moonlight was gentle like water, and everything around them seemed fresh and warm. Grandma slowed her breathing, thinking of fragments of history and tradition connected with the moon and all that is old and new around her, and began to chant:\nAs firecrackers send away the old year,\nThe spring breeze feels as warm as New Year\u2019s wine.\nAll houses welcome fresh sun and good cheer,\nWhile new couplets take the place of old signs.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World in June 2013.\nAuthor\u2019s Note: While I was at my parents\u2019 home over Spring Festival break, I wanted to write some stories about ordinary lives. I don\u2019t particularly care about predicting the future, but I do think that deep changes are happening around us almost undetectably. These changes are the most real, and also the most science fictional.\nThe future is full of uncertainties, and it is as hard to say it will be better as it is to say it will be worse. In a few decades, I don\u2019t know if anyone will still remember how to chant ancient poems, but I do know that in every passing moment, the people in every house\u2014men, women, old, young\u2014are living lives as meaningful as they\u2019re ordinary.\nThe poem included in this story was written by the Song Dynasty poet Wang Anshi.\nXia Jia (aka Wang Yao) is Associate Professor of Chinese Literature at Xi'an Jiaotong University and has been publishing speculative fiction since college.

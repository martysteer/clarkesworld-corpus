You don\u2019t understand the sympathy you see there.\nBen is a good baby. He sleeps more than usual. More than normal children. You stand by his cot and watch him often. His lashes are dark against his cheek and he makes little suckling noises in his sleep. Sometimes his small body twitches, all over. You think that if you stand there long enough, quietly enough, you will be able to see him growing.\nMarch\nYou haven\u2019t been returning your mother\u2019s phone calls so your mother drives an hour and a half and drops in unexpectedly.\nBen is crawling with an easy mastery, turning on a dime and scooting across the floor on his knees in his green corduroy trousers. When your mother picks him up he says \u201cMm-ba!\u201d and laughs, high and delicious.\n\u201cWas it the money?\u201d your mother says, and you shrug, although it wasn\u2019t the money, not really, not mostly.\nLater, your mother looks at Ben and not you as he tries to grab her chin in his hands and says \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nYou rub at the injection-site between two of your vertebrae, right at the base of your neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d approve,\u201d you say. You watch the tightness around her lips and see the thing she does not say. I don\u2019t.\nMay\nYou drive up for your nephew\u2019s first birthday party although you really don\u2019t want to. You watch Milo pulling up on the furniture and notice that Ben is already a little taller. Your sister looks great, although she is all over-bright and flustered.\n\u201cIt must be nice for you,\u201d she says, as she watches Ben totter towards you with his unsteady gait.\nYou nod, and wish she\u2019d left off the last two words.\nOne of your cousin\u2019s girls is tearing around the back yard in a Boogey mask, making the other children scatter and scream. You know it is a Boogey mask, because the other kids are shrieking \u201cwatch out for the Boogey,\u201d although its features are generic monster really, green lumpy skin, bulging eyes, red slavering maw. No one knows what real Boogeys look like, they\u2019ve never captured one, never examined and dissected one, only blasted them to teeny tiny pieces. They probably don\u2019t look like that at all.\nEveryone sings for Milo and watches him open his mound of presents. You resolve that when you get back home you will buy Ben a new toy and wrap it up and give it to him so that he can tear off the paper and squeal, even though it is not his birthday.\nBen plunges his fist into his yellow plastic bowl.\n\u201cCake!\u201d he says.\nJune\nYou put yourself into Ben\u2019s stimulation chamber, out of curiosity. The colors and patterns, words and music, the way it shifts and shifts and is never still gives you a headache.\nBen is healthy, intelligent, and active, everything he was engineered to be. It doesn\u2019t say it in the manual, but you know from the center that when they grew kids up quick in the lab, that even though they\u2019d been screened for mental disorders, without mothers (or sometimes fathers) something would go wrong with a lot of them. They\u2019d get depressed, they\u2019d wig-out, they couldn\u2019t work well in a team. Without mothers.\nAt night Ben has started escaping from his cot. He is a strong baby, good at climbing. He makes his way into your room in the darkened hours and you are woken by a little voice at your side saying \u201cUp! Up!\u201d You know you should take him back to his own room, all of the books say you should. But you don\u2019t.\nJuly\nYour once-best-friend is getting married and even though you haven\u2019t seen her for nearly two years you feel the tug of wanting to go. Your mother still lives a street away from your friend\u2019s parents and she knows all about it, and when she offers to look after Ben for a day and have him sleep over that night you get swayed by the lack of reluctance in her voice.\nWhen you arrive at your mother\u2019s the radio is talking about the latest wave of Boogeys that\u2019ve been defeated, twelve light-minutes away from Earth. It doesn\u2019t talk about the soldiers who died, out there far away.\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d you say, as your mother reaches over and switches it off.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d says your mother. Although you can\u2019t tell if she is sorry for having the radio on, sorry she turned it off, or some other sorry that is to do with her faraway expression and not the radio at all.\nYou slick back your short hair and scrape yourself into clothes that don\u2019t feel comfortable and totter off to the wedding. You\u2019ve never said goodbye to Ben before and your throat constricts over the word, but he opens and closes one chubby fist in a wave and goes back to digging in the garden with your mother, dark soil on his arms and one cheek.\nIt is very late and you\u2019ve had more fun than you expected to have when you let yourself back into your mother\u2019s house. You\u2019ve drunk champagne and you have a blister on your heel and you are laughing to yourself as you go up the stairs, feeling like a teenager. When you see Ben asleep in your bed you stop and stand still and realize that you haven\u2019t thought about him all night, not once.\nThat\u2019s normal, you think, but your hand strays up to the back of your neck and you feel cold all of a sudden.\nYou don an old t-shirt, the school-logo faded, the fabric soft against your skin after so many washes, and climb into bed. Ben\u2019s small body gives off a surprising amount of heat and you curl yourself around him but it is a long time before you sleep.\nAugust\nBen loves the park at the end of your block and you take him there most every day now. The regular denizens of the playground become familiar after a while\u2014the dark-haired, dark-eyed little girl who always howls when she has to go home; the boy who is usually hanging upside down making faces while his mother constantly talks on the phone, her voice high and agitated; the solemn little boy who loves the slide. Many of them were bigger than Ben when you first started coming. Now\u2014not so many, not as many. You watch as Ben navigates the monkey bars with an easy grace.\nA girl about Ben\u2019s height that you haven\u2019t seen before pushes him as he lands. Ben tumbles onto the sand but ends up on his feet, like a cat. He scowls at the little girl then runs towards the swings.\n\u201cSulisa\u201d hollers a tall man who is presumably her father. \u201cNo pushing!\u201d He comes up to you and offers you an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s gone a bit feral since the separation.\u201d You stand there as he tells you about it, wondering why he is confiding in you. People don\u2019t usually start talking to you. You don\u2019t think you look very approachable, your face is closed rather than open.\n\u201cI\u2019m tearing my hair out to be honest,\u201d the man says. He still looks like he has plenty of hair. \u201cI wish they came with a manual!\u201d\n\u201cMine did come with a manual,\u201d you say softly.\nOctober\nBen has a new fascination with astronomy so you let him stay up past his bedtime and drive him out to the farmland halfway to your mother\u2019s house so that you can escape some of the light pollution, sit on the bonnet of your car, and look at the sky.\nIt is a clear cold night and the stars are clustered thickly bright and deep.\n\u201cWhich one is Mars?\u201d Ben asks, snuggling into your side. Of course, of course.\n\u201cThere,\u201d you say, pointing. You know where Mars is. Everyone knows where Mars is. \u201cSee the very bright one that looks a little bit reddish.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d you say, because it is, even so.\n\u201cMars is where the Boogeys are,\u201d he tells you, in his high sweet, little-boy voice. Of course. How did he know? His second cousins? The TV? His stimulation chamber maybe. It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\u201cYes,\u201d you say. \u201cMars is where the Boogeys are.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Boogeys didn\u2019t come from Mars, did they Mama?\u201d\n\u201cNo sweetie,\u201d you say. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where they came from, but they came from somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cAre there lots of Boogeys Mama? Lots and lots and lots and lots?\u201d His breath makes little puffs in the chill of the air.\n\u201cYes,\u201d you say. Because there are lots. Lots and lots and lots and lots. More every day, they say. So many. Too many, maybe, probably too many.\nAt the moment, it doesn\u2019t feel close, looking up at that little spark of light. Ben\u2019s small body is pressed right against you. It feels like a story. Far away in the sky, not real.\n\u201cI\u2019d be good at being a pilot Mama,\u201d Ben says, his face serious, his cold little hand curled in yours.\n\u201cI bet you would,\u201d you say. \u201cBut now it\u2019s time to get you to bed.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the Boogeys Mama,\u201d Ben says, and yawns.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you say. \u201cI don\u2019t like them either honey.\u201d\nNovember\nYour mother is keen to take Ben and Milo to the beach for four days. It\u2019ll \u2018give you a break\u2019 she says.\nYou are not sure you need a break, or what you would do with one. But you are touched that your mother wants to take the both of them, and Ben likes Milo, even though he is too small to really play with now-days. And Ben has never seen the ocean. And there is no ocean on Mars, or anywhere in all the space between.\nWhen you open the door to them four days later you are stilled by a kind of shock. You\u2019ve spoken to Ben on the phone every night, and you haven\u2019t forgotten him, of course you haven\u2019t\u2014but it\u2019s like all of the thoughts and feelings and memories of Ben have been in a box, and the box is over in a far corner, and you haven\u2019t looked into it lately, not for a while. All of the urgency, the immediacy, the power of those thoughts had been leeched out. It returns now with a wallop that makes you draw in your breath sharply.\nHe was only gone four days.\nBen is telling you with great excitement tales of sand crabs and fishing, ice cream and sandcastles with moats.\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say, because you are noticing that his cheeks look a little less chubby, as if you can start to see what the planes of his face will be. And is he taller too?\n\u201cLook Mama,\u201d says Ben, showing you the most exciting news of all. \u201cMy tooth is wobbly!\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say again.\nYour mother makes you a cup of tea even though really you should have offered to make her one.\n\u201cHow can you bear it?\u201d you say.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d says your mother.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d you say, and sip your tea.\nBut your mother answers you anyway.\n\u201cWe had more time, of course,\u201d she says. \u201cThey replace themselves\u2014you\u2019re always losing the child that was; the newborn, the baby, the toddler, but they get overwritten in your mind, in a way, by their new self.\u201d She stops to listen to the boys laughing in Ben\u2019s room. \u201cBut for you . . . it is so quick. You can hold it all in your mind, all at once, simultaneously.\u201d She looks down at her cup. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to break your heart.\u201d\nYou had thought your mother didn\u2019t understand.\nDecember\nUsually you hate and avoid Christmas with a passion, but Ben is excited and all of a sudden you want all of it, every last drop\u2014feasting and tinsel and lights and cookies in the shape of Christmas trees. You drive up to your Mother\u2019s and sing songs loudly with Ben the whole way. Silent Night. Jingle Bells. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Ben knows all the words but you\u2019ve given up being surprised about how quickly he learns.\nEveryone exclaims over how much Ben has grown; which is a given, like talking about the weather. You hug Milo, who is just beginning to run everywhere and think I remember when Ben was doing that.\nNo one talks about Ben\u2019s birthday or what happens next, but people seem to touch you a lot. A hand on your shoulder, in the middle of your back, on your arm, little pats as you serve the potatoes.\nYou\u2019ve bought Ben more presents than is perhaps warranted, and have wrapped each one in different shiny paper. Books and felt pens and a scooter, puzzles and magnets and walkie-talkies. It\u2019s his first Christmas, and his last Christmas and his only Christmas, and you\u2019d wrap up the moon if you could.\nJanuary\n\u201cOn my birthday, I\u2019m going to the Recruit Training Center,\u201d Ben says to you, matter-of-factly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Too soon, oh, too soon, my son. He\u2019ll be at the Center for a year. By the end of that year he\u2019ll be taller than you.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to help save the world.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d You are proud of him, and you wonder, for not nearly the first time, whether they made him this beautiful on purpose.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be big and brave without you, and I\u2019ll come back to you one day Mama.\u201d\nNo, no you won\u2019t, you think, but you don\u2019t say it because now your robust and resilient little man who almost never cries is wiping at his eyes furiously.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d you say, pulling him towards you, \u201cand I\u2019ll always love you too, always.\u201d\nMore than anything you want this to be true.\nAnd maybe one day he knocks on your door.\nBecause the Boogeys have been defeated, wiped out, obliterated, and he gets to come home. Because maybe he remembers or maybe he has looked up the information about you.\nAnd you blink at him for long, long seconds.\nAnd then something stirs in the back of your mind and you start to pull old, old memories from somewhere deep in there where they have been archived.\nHe says hello and he says his name and now the memories are avalanching through you, picking up speed and weight and power; a cold sweet rush of all the different sorts of love, the way your heart was breaking and expanding at once, both together. The nights where the world shrunk to a point, a singularity, where it was just you and him, awake and alone together in the night. It all comes back.\nSomething softens around the edges of his face and you wonder what he remembers now.\nAnd you ask him inside with a joy that makes you ache.\nOr he never knocks.\nApril\nYou name your second child Vincent.\nYou never have a third child.\nSamantha Murray is a writer, mathematician, and mother.

Dadd-deee!\u201d Bluet wailed.\nI rushed to Bluet.\nBluet\u2019s eyes were wet. Karina hung back, blank-eyed, as Bluet bolted forward.\n\u201cRegan called Mommy dead.\u201d\nI wrapped Bluet in a hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d My voice was muffled, my face pressed into Bluet\u2019s hair. \u201cThat was not a nice thing to say.\u201d Everything had to be a competition with Regan, and she always had to win. If she could win at Who Had the Most Mommies, she wanted to fucking play.\nI held out one arm until Karina joined us reluctantly, then I squeezed them both, willing them to feel better, willing my strength to flow into them. Especially into Karina. Even from the back, I could feel Karina\u2019s ribs.\nAs soon as I stopped squeezing, Karina slipped out of my arms and made a beeline for her room.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put out a snack in a minute,\u201d I called to her.\nKarina didn\u2019t reply. I heard her door close.\nShe spent every possible moment in there, doing absolutely nothing as far as I could tell. All the progress she\u2019d made, all the confidence, the social skills, the joy, had been wiped away in the course of one single, terrible, horrible day. It hurt to think of her in that room, sinking deeper into herself.\nAt this point, I didn\u2019t know how much of it was her autism and how much depression.\nI set out two chocolate \u00e9clairs, the most tempting, high-calorie snack I could think of. I\u2019d given up caring whether the food was nutritious\u2014I just wanted Karina to eat. And when you\u2019d been given the semester off from teaching, you had all the time in the world to hunt down old-school bakeries.\n\u201cBluet, Karina? Snack time,\u201d I called.\nBluet appeared. No Karina.\nI knocked on Karina\u2019s door, then I opened it partway.\nKarina was sitting on her bed rocking, staring down at her hands, her hair forming a hiding place for her face. Zelia had always tied Karina\u2019s long, wild hair into a ponytail before school, but now Karina insisted on wearing it loose, so she could use it as a room to hide in.\n\u201cCome and have a snack. Please?\u201d\nKarina went on rocking. She had stopped doing that when she was four or five. Now it was starting up again.\n\u201cPlease, Karina. At least come sit at the table?\u201d\nNothing.\nI went to Karina, and ever-so-gently lifted her face until she was looking at me. \u201cCome sit at the table.\u201d\nKarina slid off the bed and slunk past me without a word. I followed her into the kitchen and pulled out her chair.\nKarina stared down at the \u00e9clair.\n\u201cI got them at a bakery. They\u2019re really fresh.\u201d\nBluet swiped up a fingerful of whipped cream and held the finger out to Finster, who wagged his tail as he licked the whipped cream.\nYou were supposed to get a little better every day. Especially kids. Everyone said that. Don\u2019t worry about the girls, kids are resilient. But if you already had a lot of challenges, losing your mother could be too much to snap back from.\nDr. Ferdinand said this was a critical period for Karina, that if she didn\u2019t recover from Zelia\u2019s loss now, it might change her trajectory right into adulthood. But every time I pictured my seven-year-old girl all alone at a psychiatric facility, it brought me to tears. Dr. Ferdinand didn\u2019t know Karina the way I did. I felt this deep certainty that being alone in that hospital would just further traumatize her.\nIf she kept on this downward spiral, though, what other choice did I have?\nI knew what Karina needed. She needed Zelia. Zelia had been the one who got Karina, who could connect with her. She was Karina\u2019s bridge to the rest of the world.\nThe last thing Zelia had said to Karina was, I\u2019ll be right back. I kept thinking that if she\u2019d been able to say goodbye, Karina would have been able to get over losing her.\nBluet offered Finster a bigger piece of her \u00e9clair. Finster nibbled at it tentatively, knocking it out of Bluet\u2019s hand and onto the floor before trotting away.\nOur domestic bot, which had been scrubbing the linoleum floor, rose, its scrubbing brushes disappearing into its carbon fiber tube arms. It strode purposefully toward the glob of \u00e9clair on its wide, flat feet.\nI smiled, remembering how Zelia had bristled that the bot had been given a vaguely feminine form by its manufacturer, and insisted on calling it Hank, which was, she said, the most masculine name in existence. The first time I referred to it as Larissa\u2014the most feminine name in existence, according to me\u2014Zelia had thrown back her head and laughed her husky laugh.\nMy phone rang\u2014it was Zelia\u2019s mom. I left the kids with their \u00e9clairs and went to my bedroom to answer it out of earshot.\nBlessedly, she only wanted to check on their flight itinerary, and I was able to get off quickly, without the obligatory reminiscing. I was dreading Zelia\u2019s parents week-long visit at the end of the month. Zelia\u2019s mom insisted on talking about Zelia nonstop, telling anecdotes from her childhood that I knew were meant to be helpful, but only made things worse. Having my own parents around was more of a comfort, but they had their hands full dealing with Dad\u2019s COPD.\nI stepped into the hallway and almost collided with Hank/Larissa.\n\u201cPardon me, Benji. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Hank/Larissa passed with a stack of neatly folded, brightly colored girls\u2019 clothes. I watched the bot pass. It was now a tiny balm that the domestic bot possessed those rounded contours that gave it a vaguely feminine appearance. It provided the slightest hint of a maternal presence, when that lack was like a black hole sucking all joy, all life from our family. Maybe I should ask Hank/Larissa to put on female clothes to play up that presence. We certainly had plenty of women\u2019s clothes to spare. Karina refused to let me, or Hank/Larissa, get rid of anything of Zelia\u2019s.\nI let out an involuntary hack of gallows laughter as I imagined the bot going through Zelia\u2019s closet, choosing something to wear. Sick thoughts.\nI went to check on the girls, kicking Finster\u2019s toy lamb out of my path. Finster wouldn\u2019t play her lamb game with anyone but Zelia, so the lamb had become another memory that got booted from room to room.\nHank/Larissa appeared with the empty laundry basket, its blocky carbon-fiber face bland and vaguely cartoonish. \u201cPardon me, Benji. I hope you\u2019re having a good day.\u201d\nI turned to watch the bot pivot on legs that were nothing but narrow pipes, its feet like flippers by contrast, but what my exhausted mind saw was Zelia, her knees turned slightly inward, her ponytail bobbing.\nFor an instant the vision was so clear I almost ran to her. Then Hank/Larissa was back, and I was left with a truly unhinged idea.\nWhen I thought I had it right, I stepped back and raised the transmitter strapped to my wrist.\n\u201cTesting.\u201d\nThe bot repeated what I\u2019d said in Zelia\u2019s lovely, scratchy alto. It took me a moment to collect myself, hearing her voice. It was as if she was suddenly in the bedroom with me, and all of this had been a long bad dream.\nIt might blow up in my face, but it also might make things better, and things needed to get better. They just had to.\nWhat would Zelia think?\nShe\u2019d approve. She\u2019d be down with anything that could help Karina. And it was her sort of idea. Bold. Bizarre.\nI lifted the microphone to my lips.\n\u201cHello, Duckies.\u201d The voice seared right through my heart. It would do the same to the girls.\nThat was the idea, though, wasn\u2019t it? Convince them Zee was speaking to them for a few precious minutes. A few words from Zee would mean so much to Karina.\nAnd really, how different was this from Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy? Parents created mythical benevolent figures all the time to provide comfort, to inject a little magic into the world. And when the kids were old enough to know they\u2019d been punked, they were okay with it. How many kids wished they\u2019d never believed in Santa Claus?\nI tried the transmitter again. \u201cHello, Sunshine.\u201d Zelia had called me \u201cSunshine,\u201d insisting it wasn\u2019t meant to be ironic, or at least not completely so.\nI went to the bedroom and opened Zelia\u2019s closet door. Before the accident I hadn\u2019t realized Zelia had a scent all her own, now it wafted off everything she\u2019d ever touched. It was lemon and puppy\u2019s feet. A hint of brown sugar.\nThe phone rang: my friend Vincent, probably just checking on me. I sent the call to voicemail. Vince had really stuck by me through this, but I\u2019d had so little time to devote to our friendship. I missed our trips to the movies, playing racquetball, gossiping about other faculty. There was just no time now.\nHands shaking, I sorted through Zelia\u2019s clothes. What was her most iconic outfit, the one Karina and Bluet would most easily recognize? I rifled faster, wanting to finish. It hurt to see these shirts and dresses, each sparking half a dozen memories.\nSitting up against a wall in my closet, I guided the bot in a slow pan of the living room. Through the camera embedded behind the bots\u2019 left eye, I saw Bluet watching cartoons, her face much too young for the dark sunken racoon-rings under her eyes. Karina was sitting at the kitchen table, head down, one leg swinging, doing nothing.\nI felt excited, guilty, full of dread, hopeful, sad, uncertain. This was the last point where I could change my mind. I knew I wouldn\u2019t. Crazy as this idea was, it felt right. I felt sure I could reach Karina this way.\nHeart hammering, transmitting sensors strapped to my ankles, I jerked my legs straight out just as I\u2019d practiced.\nThe bot\u2019s feet flew out from under it. It clattered to the linoleum floor.\nStartled, Bluet and Karina turned to watch the bot thrash on the floor like it was having a seizure.\n\u201cDaaad?\u201d Bluet called. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with the cleaning thing. And why is it wearing clothes?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t answer\u2014I had to stay out of sight and earshot for this to work. I stopped the bot\u2019s thrashing and made it sit up slowly. It looked from Karina to Bluet.\n\u201cI made it,\u201d I said into the wrist mic, my heart pounding so hard I was afraid I was going to fracture a rib. The bot repeated what I\u2019d said in Zelia\u2019s husky Brooklyn accent.\nThe girls froze.\n\u201cKarina? Bluet? It\u2019s me.\u201d I stood the bot up by drawing my knees up, placing my own feet flat on the closet floor, and tensing my quad muscles. \u201cI don\u2019t have much time. Just a few minutes, and then I have to go back.\u201d\nThe girls gawked at the bot.\n\u201cWhy do you sound like my Mommy all of a sudden?\u201d Bluet asked.\nThe voice was right, but they weren\u2019t buying it. The bot sounded like Mommy, but I wasn\u2019t talking the way Zelia talked. It felt wrong to playact the part of my late wife to that extent, almost like I was mocking her. That\u2019s what it was going to take, though.\nI sat up straighter in the closet. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and pictured Zelia in the kitchen, leaned up against the counter drinking tea made from some obscure bitter root while simultaneously scarfing Oreos, her bare shoulders covered in freckles, her ponytail poking out the back of a Kansas City Royals cap, because she loved the Royals, even though she\u2019d never been to Kansas City.\n\u201cLet me get a look at my Duckies, see if your daddy\u2019s been feeding you.\u201d I reached out the bot\u2019s arm to brush Karina\u2019s chin. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. Heavy duty cuties, both of you.\u201d\nThe girls went on gawking, as if the bot had blown a gasket.\n\u201cHey.\u201d I moved the bot over to the candy jars lining one counter of the kitchen. \u201cYou want to binge on some sugar, dextrose, and red dye number five?\u201d The bot lifted the lid off the Sour Patch jar. \u201cI can\u2019t partake, unfortunately, because I have no digestive system. But I can distribute.\u201d The bot set a handful of Sour Patch Kids in Bluet\u2019s outstretched hand.\nKarina was gazing up at the bot, her eyebrows raised. \u201cMommy?\u201d\nI knelt Zelia-bot down, reached out, and brushed the tip of Karina\u2019s button nose. \u201cBingo.\u201d\nKarina launched herself into the bot\u2019s outstretched arms. She turned to Bluet. \u201cIt\u2019s Mommy! It\u2019s Mommy!\u201d\nBluet\u2019s eyes went huge and round. \u201cMommy?\u201d She joined Karina in the bot\u2019s arms. \u201cWhat are you doing in there? Come out.\u201d\nGuilt flooded through me, blotting out every other emotion. Suddenly this felt like a terrible mistake, cruel and childish. But I couldn\u2019t stop now. Not yet, anyway.\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Sweetie. The bot let me borrow her body for a little while. I have some things I want to tell you that I didn\u2019t get to say before I left. And then I have to go back.\u201d What would Zelia want to say to them? I should have written some things down.\nDon\u2019t think. Just talk.\n\u201cThis sucks. So bad,\u201d I said as Zeliabot. \u201cI hate being away from you guys. I miss you so much.\u201d\n\u201cIt was because of the accident,\u201d Bluet said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you went away.\u201d\n\u201cIt was. I never would have left you if I had any choice. But here\u2019s the thing: I may not be here in my body, but I\u2019m still all around you, all the time, wherever you go.\u201d The words poured out. They felt right, felt Zelia. \u201cNow, there\u2019s something I need you to do for me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Karina wasn\u2019t even blinking, she was so mesmerized.\n\u201cEven though you miss me, I want you to be happy. Laugh. Play with your friends. Karina, I\u2019ve watched you moping in your room, and I don\u2019t like it at all. You hear me? No more moping. Ride bikes. Get in trouble at school. Jump in some lakes. Watch some TV, for God\u2019s sake! Can you do that for me?\u201d\nKarina nodded. \u201cNow that you\u2019re back, I can. I missed you so much.\u201d\n\u201cI missed you so much, too!\u201d Bluet piped in.\n\u201cI miss you munchkins, too. But I can\u2019t stay,\u201d I said. \u201cAs much as I hate the rules, they\u2019re the rules. You have no idea how many strings I had to pull just to get a few minutes with you.\u201d\nTears trailed down Karina\u2019s cheeks. She grasped the bot\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease. Please. There\u2019s so much I have to tell you.\u201d The expression on her face. The hope. The here-ness. When was the last time I\u2019d seen such lucidity in those eyes?\nI felt a plunging in my stomach. This was just going to reopen the wound, make it fresh and bloody all over again. It was going to tip Karina over the edge.\nKarina clung to the bot, her face buried in Zelia\u2019s sundress. \u201cPlease, Mommy. Don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d I blurted.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d Karina demanded through her tears.\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I promised. \u201cAfter school.\u201d\nKarina\u2019s face relaxed and flushed with color. \u201cWe can play one of our games.\u201d\n\u201cWe can do whatever you want,\u201d I said. \u201cRight now, though, I have to say adios. Be good, Duckies.\u201d\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Karina said as Zeliabot went still.\nI wasn\u2019t sure whether to restore the bot\u2019s autonomous settings and let it go back to doing chores, or to leave it deactivated. Maybe deactivated would be less confusing for the girls. I climbed to my feet and headed for the living room.\nThe girls surrounded me immediately.\n\u201cDaddy! Where were you? Mommy was here!\u201d Bluet cried.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d Karina said. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\nI did my best to act awestruck and elated. I asked lots of questions.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you sad you missed her?\u201d Karina asked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be back tomorrow. You can talk to her then.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d I\u2019d have Zeliabot explain why she and I could never be there at the same time.\nAs I rooted through the freezer seeking something to microwave for dinner, the girls talked and laughed excitedly. I\u2019d have to navigate this carefully, but it felt so good to see life in Bluet\u2019s eyes.\nThey came busting through the door after school. \u201cMommy? Mommy?\u201d\nThey\u2019d talked about nothing else, just one long breathless conversation about the things they wanted to tell Mommy, the games they\u2019d play with her.\nI rushed Zeliabot down the hall to greet them. \u201cHow are my babushkas?\nBluet grabbed Zeliabot\u2019s hand and pulled. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside!\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we stay inside? We could play Godzilla Goes to Disneyland.\u201d It would not be ideal for the neighbors to see Zeliabot.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s beautiful outside.\u201d My unstoppable force of a daughter tugged Zeliabot\u2019s hand. I just couldn\u2019t say no. It would be good for the kids to get some fresh air and exercise. Let the neighbors think we were complete weirdos, if they didn\u2019t already.\nAs soon as we were outside, Karina and Bluet headed for the bike path that led to the neighborhood playground. It was all of a hundred yards from the house, but suddenly it seemed like miles as I navigated our domestic bot, with its built-in brushes and floor-polishing capabilities, between our neighbor\u2019s fenced yards.\nAcross the bike path from the playground, Regan\u2019s dog Max greeted them with furious barking from behind his chain-link fence, kicking up divots in the grass as he tracked them. What a fantastic idea, to get a loud, angry dog that barked and snarled ceaselessly when your yard was right behind the playground.\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Karina asked Zeliabot as they entered the playground, which was blessedly deserted.\nZelia had always been busting with ideas for things to do. She\u2019d announce on a random Friday that tomorrow was National Dominoes Day, and send me off to bake brownies, using chocolate chips to turn them into dominoes. There would be a slate of events. Each contestant would have to steer Finster through a minefield of dominoes without knocking any over. The kids would make domino-themed artwork. It was like a holiday only we celebrated. The girls loved those days.\nI, on the other hand, was not busting with ideas. I was the boring parent who felt self-conscious about pretending to be Big Bird or a Powerpuff Girl.\n\u201cHow about we fly?\u201d I spread Zeliabot\u2019s cleaning accessory-laden arms and ran her in loops around the playground equipment. Evidently this was sufficiently creative, because Bluet and Karina spread their arms and flew behind me, Bluet making enthusiastic airplane sounds.\nGood ol\u2019 Bob Stevens, who owned the house next to Regan\u2019s family, was fertilizing his lawn. Zelia had dubbed him The Old Man and the Lawn, because Bob fancied himself a heroic figure in his battle against the twigs and acorns and weeds that marred the perfection that was Lawn. Bob paused to watch the proceedings.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s Paris down there,\u201d Zeliabot said. \u201cYou see the Eiffel Tower?\u201d\n\u201cI see it!\u201d Karina said.\n\u201cAnd look up there! A UFO! I think I see drunk aliens hanging out of it!\u201d\n\u201cI see them!\u201d Bluet pointed at the sky.\nRegan appeared on her porch. I was tempted to have Zeliabot tell the girls it was time to go, but they\u2019d only been there a couple of minutes. Regan squeezed through the gate as Max barked and jumped, trying to get out.\nZeliabot waved. \u201cHi, Regan, how are you?\u201d\nRegan stopped short. She looked at Karina. \u201cWhy does your bot sound like your mom?\u201d\n\u201cOur mom came back!\u201d Bluet cried. \u201cShe\u2019s inside the bot.\u201d\n\u201cNo, she isn\u2019t.\u201d Regan eyed the bot. \u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her that, or you can\u2019t play with us,\u201d Zelia said.\nRegan considered. \u201cWhat are you playing?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been flying around the world, but we\u2019re about to start flying through time.\u201d Zeliabot spread her arms and resumed gliding. The girls followed. \u201cDo you want to pick our first destination?\u201d\nRegan spread her arms and joined the aerial procession, cutting in front of Karina and Bluet. I was tempted to tell her to go to the back of the line, but right now keeping her from interrogating Zeliabot about her authenticity seemed more important.\nWe were visiting prehistoric times, flying over a triceratops, when Bob Stevens, who\u2019d been watching the whole time, barked \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\nI had Zeliabot fly closer to Bob, setting off furious barking from Max. \u201cHow are you, Bob? How\u2019s the lawn?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Did Bob look annoyed? Confused? It was hard to tell with Bob\u2014his default expression was pinched, squinty-eyed, just-bit-a-lemon.\n\u201cI\u2019m just back from the dead for a while to visit my daughters.\u201d I pulled my wrist away from my face and burst out laughing. That line was pure Zelia.\n\u201cWho\u2019s saying that?\u201d Bob demanded. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, for your information.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Bob. Don\u2019t you recognize my voice?\u201d\nBob studied Zeliabot for another moment, then turned and limped inside, shooting glances over his shoulder, looking like he\u2019d seen a ghost. Or bit into a lemon. One or the other.\n\u201cThis time with you, it\u2019s so precious to me. I look at you both, and you\u2019re luminous. I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d Zeliabot hovered over the kids as they ate the grilled cheese sandwiches and chicken noodle soup she\u2019d made. Karina was wolfing it down. \u201cThis has been so hard on you, but you\u2019re going to be fine. You have fabulous lives ahead of you.\u201d I grabbed the hand towel I kept handy to wipe tears. \u201cI love you two. Always and forever. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d\nI had to start cutting back the frequency of Zeliabot\u2019s \u201cvisits.\u201d I knew that. But the girls were so happy when she was around, and that made me happy.\nFinster appeared from out of the living room, carrying the toy lamb in his mouth. He dropped it at Zeliabot\u2019s feet and looked up expectantly. I burst out laughing, which meant Zeliabot burst out laughing.\n\u201cYou want to play the lamb game?\u201d Zeliabot retrieved the lamb and hid it behind her back. Finster leaped into the air, ecstatic.\nMy phone rang.\n\u201cI have to rest for a few minutes,\u201d I had Zeliabot say. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I threw the lamb so Finster could chase it, then put Zeliabot in standby mode.\nIt was Ms. Vazquez, the principal at Karina\u2019s school. As far as I could remember, she\u2019d never called before. It was always the vice principal, or a teacher. After the bare minimum of pleasantries, Ms. Vazquez dove into the reason for the call.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all thrilled that Karina has finally turned a corner, but now that she\u2019s talking again, she\u2019s telling her classmates these stories. She\u2019s insisting that her mother has come back.\u201d She whispered the words come back, as if it were an obscenity, or a racial slur. \u201cHas she been doing this at home at all?\u201d\nI stammered, let out an utterly inappropriate nervous bray of laughter. I guess I should have anticipated this.\n\u201cActually,\u201d I began. How could I put this that didn\u2019t make me sound unhinged? \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. You know how dire things were getting. I know Dr. Ferdinand was keeping you updated, and you could see for yourself that Karina was getting worse instead of better.\u201d\nMs. Vazquez\u2019s tone softened. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how hard this must be on both of them.\u201d\n\u201cKarina\u2019s sister is doing all right. As well as can be expected, anyway. But until last week, not Karina. I think it was the suddenness. Karina really struggles with transitions, as you know. If my wife had been able to speak to Karina before she died, to say goodbye, I think Karina would be handling it better.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cIn fact, I know she would. Because out of desperation, I decided to pretend her mom has come back for a little while.\u201d\nThere was a long, long pause. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d\n\u201cThe next step was putting Karina in a psychiatric facility. I had to try something.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying this isn\u2019t Karina\u2019s imagination?\u201d Ms. Vazquez sounded uncomfortable. Embarrassed, almost.\n\u201cI know it sounds strange, but it\u2019s working. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s worked.\u201d\nAnother long pause. The paranoid part of me felt certain she\u2019d decided to start recording our conversation, to gather evidence of my insanity.\n\u201cI have to be honest,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI have no idea how to handle a situation like this. I mean, you can see why we can\u2019t play along and humor Karina. I\u2019ll have to consult with the school psychologist, and the superintendent.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to humor her. Just say nothing. Smile and give her a pat on the head.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s possible. As I said, this is causing a stir among Karina\u2019s classmates. They\u2019re bringing the stories home.\u201d\nI was tempted to ask her why that was a problem. Before the accident, when Karina used to talk about school, she\u2019d bring home all sorts of ignorant ideas her classmates parroted from their parents.\n\u201cMr. Brody? Did you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I missed what you said.\u201d\n\u201cI said, I\u2019d like to set up a meeting for next week.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Sure.\u201d\nI got off the phone as quickly as I could, and reactivated Zeliabot, already regretting agreeing to meet with them. I did not want to go to that meeting. They\u2019d look at me like I was mentally unstable, demand I prove I wasn\u2019t. Prove to us you\u2019re not a danger to your daughters. I wasn\u2019t up for that sort of grilling.\nI took a second shot of rum. Zuma, the brand was. Zelia had picked it out. She\u2019d liked how it went with her name. I hadn\u2019t touched the bottle, or any other alcohol, since the accident. I knew if I\u2019d started drinking, I wouldn\u2019t stop, and I needed to take care of my girls.\nNow, though, I needed liquid courage.\nZeliabot climbed out of Zelia\u2019s Toyota Spark and headed for the entrance to Willowbrook Elementary as my heart pounded in time with her exceptionally loud carbon fiber footsteps. Parents leaving with their kids glanced at Zeliabot as they passed.\nAt the door, Zeliabot waited for a dad with a first- or second-grader to pass through, then caught the door before it closed, so she wouldn\u2019t have to be buzzed in. I marched her into the main office and made a beeline for the conference room door in the back corner of the big space.\nThe secretary looked confused. \u201cWhy is the cleaning crew here already? Hey, the conference room is in use, you can\u2019t clean in there yet!\u201d\nZeliabot breezed into the room. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. Should I sit here?\u201d Since domestic bots aren\u2019t designed to sit\u2014they don\u2019t get tired, and typically don\u2019t attend parent-teacher conferences\u2014I had to sort of flop Zeliabot into the seat at an awkward angle.\nThere were three flabbergasted individuals in the room: Karina\u2019s teacher, Ms. Hoffman; Principal Vazquez; and Ms. Prentiss, the school psychologist. They exchanged looks, deciding who should speak.\nFinally Principal Vazquez said, \u201cMr. Brody, this isn\u2019t funny. Are you outside? Would you please come in here?\u201d\nThe question was, did I break character? I didn\u2019t want to. I wanted Zeliabot to handle this.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but no, you\u2019re talking to me.\u201d Zeliabot poked her chest, which was covered by a tie-dyed yet tasteful blouse. \u201cYou seem to think I\u2019m a problem, so I\u2019m here to defend myself. Because the way I see it, Karina has been drifting in and out of this school for the past four months, and you haven\u2019t managed to help her at all. No, wait, you taught her to add fractions! So, there\u2019s that. Nice job.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Brody, we\u2019re not doing this.\u201d Ms. Vazquez was good at the tight school administrator tone.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to help our girls, and if you\u2019re offended or inconvenienced by our methods . . . \u201d I turned Zeliabot\u2019s hands palm up. \u201cTough.\u201d\nMs. Prentiss cleared her throat. \u201cMr. Brody, you may believe you\u2019re helping Karina. She may even seem to be improving. But you\u2019re only traumatizing her further. Her sister as well. You\u2019re not allowing them to get past this.\u201d\n\u201cKarina isn\u2019t getting past this.\u201d I thumped the table with Zeliabot\u2019s hand for emphasis. \u201cShe\u2019s getting worse. Or she was, until I showed up.\u201d\nMs. Vazquez stood abruptly. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m terminating this meeting.\u201d\nMs. Hoffman and Ms. Prentiss stood dutifully.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to consult with the school district\u2019s attorney to decide on next steps,\u201d Ms. Vazquez said to Zeliabot, her tone heavy with threat.\n\u201cOur attorney will be happy to hear your explanation for why you\u2019re harassing my husband about our family\u2019s sincerely held religious belief that souls can inhabit robots.\u201d\nMs. Vasquez swallowed like she was trying to force an egg down. I\u2019d uttered the magic words. Why hadn\u2019t I thought of this sooner? Don\u2019t infringe on my religious freedom.\nI had to drop Zeliabot to her hands and knees to get her out of the chair. As she stood, I extended her hand to Ms. Prentiss. \u201cThank you. I know how hard you work. I didn\u2019t mean to imply you don\u2019t care about Karina\u2019s well-being.\u201d Because that\u2019s what Zelia would have said once she\u2019d calmed down.\nMs. Prentiss shook Zeliabot\u2019s three-fingered hand, looking wildly uncomfortable.\nI thanked Ms. Hoffman and shook her hand as well. Ms. Vazquez breezed out before I could offer to shake hers.\nThe kids were waiting by the door when Zeliabot returned home. She took them into the back yard to play, and to talk.\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay much longer,\u201d Zeliabot said.\n\u201cYes, you can,\u201d Bluet said.\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t, Ducky. Not much. But I\u2019ll always be around, even though you can\u2019t see me. And Daddy is here to take care of you.\u201d\nKarina looked toward the house, lowered her voice to a stage whisper. \u201cDad doesn\u2019t know how to play. We need your Mom heart.\u201d\nIt felt as if someone had stomped on my chest. I couldn\u2019t speak. Couldn\u2019t breathe.\nHow many times had the girls tried to get me to play one of Zelia\u2019s silly games, only to have me say I had work to do, or I\u2019d watch them play? I despised animated films, picture books, hearing the same happy bouncy songs over and over. Somehow, I thought they hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\u201cI know, Sweetie. I know he doesn\u2019t,\u201d I finally said. \u201cHe\u2019s loves you both so, so much, though. You know that, right?\u201d\nKarina nodded.\n\u201cBut not as much as you do,\u201d Bluet said.\n\u201cJust as much. I promise you. He\u2019s just not good at showing it. But he loves you so much. He\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d\n\u201cExcept play,\u201d Karina whispered.\nIt was the only thing Zelia and I ever argued about. What I wouldn\u2019t give to go back and jump into one of those games, and see Zelia\u2019s surprised smile. I always figured I\u2019d catch up when the girls were teenagers, when I could relate to them better.\n\u201cHow come Dad can\u2019t talk to you?\u201d Karina asked.\n\u201cLike I told you, it\u2019s just one of the rules,\u201d I stammered. \u201cI came back to talk to you. I can\u2019t also talk to Daddy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if he just sits and doesn\u2019t talk?\u201d Bluet asked.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that, Sweetie.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Bluet insisted. \u201cDaddy needs your Mommy heart, too.\u201d\n\u201cTell you what? While you and Karina are at school, I\u2019ll come once just to visit Daddy. That won\u2019t break the rules. Would that work?\u201d\nBluet seemed disappointed that she wouldn\u2019t be there. \u201cDo you swear?\u201d\n\u201cI swear,\u201d Zeliabot said.\nZelia had always sat on the end of the couch next to the end table, which she referred to as the controlling side, since the remote was there, and there was space to set drinks and snacks. I perched Zeliabot in Zelia\u2019s spot and sat in the glider-rocker across from the couch.\nI gazed across at our domestic bot, with her big button eyes and cleaning attachments bulging under Zelia\u2019s pink and blue sweater, feeling incredibly silly. I\u2019d sworn, though, and I wasn\u2019t going to break a swear I made to my daughter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s working. You\u2019re helping her,\u201d I said aloud, and immediately felt completely ridiculous. I also felt guilty for conversing with a domestic bot while Jack Lockley covered my classes. I was so grateful for my leave. I couldn\u2019t imagine standing in front of a class right now and talking about operant conditioning and Sigmund Freud.\nI lifted the transmitter to my lips. \u201cWe really got fucked over, didn\u2019t we, Sunshine?\u201d\nIt was a surreal echo-effect, hearing my own words, then hearing Zelia repeat them a beat later.\n\u201cNine years,\u201d Zeliabot went on. \u201cMost couples get, like, fifty. We got nine.\u201d\n\u201cThey were good years, though.\u201d\n\u201cThey were. Not always easy, but they were always good. Remember the Disney World Trip?\u201d\nI nodded, sniffling. \u201cI never laughed so hard.\u201d\nZelia had gotten the idea of narrating aloud her moment-to-moment experience from some old movie.\nLines. Everywhere she looked, nothing but endless lines. The mother considered bolting, leaving the father with the children, and hiding in Winnie the Pooh\u2019s Restaurant nursing an obscenely overpriced margarita.\nBluet had been two, too young to ride anything but the teacups, too young to know who the hell Mickey and Cinderella were. But Karina had been five, right in the Disney sweet spot. The rest of us had drafted off her exuberance.\nI allowed myself to remember, even though it hurt. Zeliabot waited patiently, wedged awkwardly against the sofa, her pipe legs poking out of a peasant skirt.\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of lost here without you, Zee.\u201d\n\u201cNot completely lost,\u201d Zeliabot replied. \u201cYou saved Karina. It was a brilliant idea, Sunshine, it really was. Now, how do I make a graceful exit before we lose our kids to child services?\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d know,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cTrust the universe,\u201d Zeliabot said. \u201cEvery so often, it provides a tiny window of opportunity.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what she would have said, or something like it. She\u2019d always had more faith in the universe than I did.\nStanding in the shadow of the big slide-bridge-castle structure on the playground, Bluet linked arms with Karina, ready for their next challenge.\n\u201cAll around you, land-squids with fire breath are waving their tentacles.\u201d Zeliabot waved her arms, illustrating the peril the girls were in. \u201cOne of the tentacles reaches out, trying to grab you!\u201d\nBluet screeched in terrified glee as the girls rushed forward a few steps to avoid the imaginary tentacle.\n\u201cCareful you don\u2019t fall off the walkway!\u201d Zeliabot pointed at the ground. \u201cThere\u2019s a squiggly part up ahead.\u201d I was kind of proud of this game I\u2019d invented\u2014sort of live Dungeons and Dragons.\nThe back door of Regan\u2019s house opened, and Regan appeared on her back porch. I silently willed her to go back inside. I wasn\u2019t in the mood.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Regan hurried down the porch steps, ran toward the gate as I cursed silently.\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing Dungeons and Dragons,\u201d Bluet called. \u201cWant to play?\u201d\nRegan opened the gate just enough to squeeze through.\nMax leaped and hit the fence with his front paws, knocking Regan to the ground. Free of the fence, he charged Bluet and Karina, teeth bared, spitting foam.\nI raced Zeliabot to intercept the dog. Max charged at the bot. Snarling, he leaped and clamped his jaws on her raised arm. Zeliabot toppled backward.\n\u201cUP ON THE SLIDE!\u201d I screamed. \u201cRUN! HURRY!\u201d\nMax went for the girls. I reached out as the dog\u2019s hind legs passed over Zeliabot and managed to grab one of them. Hobbled, Max thrashed at the wood chip-covered ground. Zeliabot clung to his back haunch. I tried to squeeze it harder, to break his fucking leg, but the bot\u2019s grip-strength was limited by design.\nMax dragged Zeliabot along the ground toward the steel steps that led up to Karina and Bluet.\nHe was halfway up when Zeliabot reached the bottom step. I grasped the bottom of the handrail; Max jerked to a stop.\nHe spun, bit the bot\u2019s wrist, and shook his head violently side to side. Zeliabot held on. I reached out with her other hand, got hold of Max\u2019s collar, then jammed Zeliabot\u2019s hand between the collar and the dog\u2019s neck and pulled, forcing Max\u2019s head down.\nMax was snarling and biting, fighting to break free. Regan was shouting at him, but he ignored her. He was finally out from behind that fence, maybe for the first time in his life, and he was intent on biting someone, anyone.\nThere was nothing more I could do as Zeliabot. I burst from the closet, grabbed the aluminum bat I kept by the front door, and sprinted toward the park.\nAs I ran, I kept picturing Max breaking free, turning toward my girls . . .\nI drew within eyeshot, saw Regan\u2019s mother burst through the back door. \u201cJesus Christ. Max! No! How did he get out?\u201d\nAs soon as Regan\u2019s mother, whatever her name was, got hold of Max\u2019s collar, he shut up, or at least toned it down to an urgent whine. She pried Zeliabot\u2019s grip off of him and dragged him roughly toward the gate as I raced to my girls.\nI studied Karina and Bluet as they sipped their juice boxes. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d I rested a hand on each of their tiny shoulders.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Karina said.\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d Bluet echoed.\n\u201cI knew Mom wouldn\u2019t let Max hurt us,\u201d Karina said. \u201cIs she okay? Why isn\u2019t she talking?\u201d\nI glanced over at Zeliabot, lying on the couch, her pinstriped chinos and Greta Van Fleet T-shirt soiled and torn, teeth marks covering her wrist and hand, her arm only connected to the torso by a handful of wires. She was going to need serious repair work.\nAnd then what? Even if I could hold off the school and somehow survive a visit from Zelia\u2019s folks, soon Karina would be eight, then nine. She didn\u2019t believe in Santa Claus anymore. How much longer would she believe in Zeliabot?\nThis was the moment. There would be no better time than right now.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go rest a little.\u201d I headed into my room, into my closet.\nI activated Zeliabot for the last time.\n\u201cHello, Duckies.\u201d I struggled to keep the sadness out of my voice.\nThe girls leaped up, shouting, \u201cMommy! Mommy!\u201d and ran to Zeliabot.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Karina asked. \u201cWe were so worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Sweetie. This is just a bot. It\u2019s not me.\u201d I sat Zeliabot upright as best I could. \u201cBut the bot is too damaged to fix.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d Karina wailed.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re safe now. I\u2019ve done everything I came here to do.\u201d\nBluet grabbed Zeliabot\u2019s hand. \u201cMommy, no.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Duck. I\u2019m always here. Always. Even when you can\u2019t see me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same, if we can\u2019t see or hear you.\u201d Karina was crying.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. I know. But it\u2019s still good knowing I\u2019m here. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe girls didn\u2019t reply.\n\u201cI need you to tell me you\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d Zeliabot urged. \u201cThat you\u2019re going to be happy. Will you do that for me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Karina said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go. No.\u201d\nZeliabot brushed Karina\u2019s wet cheek. \u201cYou can do this, Ducky. We have to say goodbye, even though it\u2019s hard. Please. For me. Do it for me.\u201d\nSobbing, Karina wrapped her arms around Zeliabot. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye, Mommy,\u201d Bluet cried. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n\u201cI love you both. Always remember that.\u201d As I dropped my wrist, Zeliabot added, \u201cAnd you too, Sunshine.\u201d Even though I hadn\u2019t said those words.\nI set Zelia\u2019s damaged body in the back seat of the car. Karina and Bluet stood by, crying quietly.\nI went and knelt by them. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Mom\u2019s mom heart is still here. Remember how we promised Mom we\u2019d be happy?\u201d\nThe girls nodded reluctantly.\n\u201cLet\u2019s show Mom we\u2019re keeping our promise. Why don\u2019t we play one of her games? She\u2019ll see we\u2019re being happy, just like she asked.\u201d\nBluet looked surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re going to play, too?\u201d\n\u201cI told you, Mom left us her mom heart. From now on I play all the games.\u201d\nI took the girls\u2019 hands and urged them toward the back yard. These early moments seemed crucial, to keep the Zelia-energy flowing.\nAnd you too, Sunshine. I kept replaying those words in my mind, hearing them in Zelia\u2019s voice.\nThere was an obvious explanation. Hank/Larissa had glitched, and said something from its bank of platitudes, and I\u2019d misheard it.\nI decided I didn\u2019t believe that explanation. I believed the numinous, mystical explanation.\nThe Zelia explanation.\nI burst onto the lawn, my Ducklings on my heels, and spread my arms.\nWill McIntosh is a Hugo award winner and finalist for the Nebula and other SF/F awards.

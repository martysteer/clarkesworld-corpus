Parallel to his studies in Arts, he spent countless hours in libraries researching this subject. He started in Digital Art just a few years ago after a friend invited him to open an account at a web-based art community. He began by coloring some old sketches, and was soon hooked. It's hard to believe that just prior to this he didn't even own a computer or even an e-mail address.\nHis biggest source of inspiration is music, which helps him visualize the atmosphere for a particular artwork. He's currently working for BBDO Colombia, an advertising agency, and on a side project featuring his unpublished artwork."}

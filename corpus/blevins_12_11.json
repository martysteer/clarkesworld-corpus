Camera! Action!\u201d on a Hollywood stage to mimic the setting of a generic suburban apartment is easy. When a film takes place on another planet, convincingly evoking an alien world is more complicated than using the usual soundstage and standard backlot. Fortunately for filmmakers looking for setting options other than green screens and CGI, the United States\u2019 strange geologies offer alien landscapes within its borders. That\u2019s also good news for speculative fiction fans looking for a quick trip off-world before the advent of supraluminal travel.\nWhile most cinemagoers associate the scenery of the American West with cowboy movies, science fiction filmmakers have used the weird geological features of western lands as settings to evoke an awareness of strange climates and otherworldly views. By traveling to principal photography locations, Sci-Fi fans can visit the alien worlds\u2014and the odd alien\u2014shown in productions ranging from Star Trek to Stargate Universe to even the animated series Futurama.\nThe Planet of the Apes\nThe opening scenes of the original Planet of the Apes (1968) use landscape to disorient the main characters, as well as the movie-watching audience, by showing the humans\u2019 spaceship landing in an unnatural-looking deep lake surrounded by red desert sandstone, leading everyone to believe the planet is an alien one.\nFilming the opening of the movie in Lake Powell near Glen Canyon, Arizona, a paradoxical deep lake in a desert, unsettles those taking in the scene because it appears natural and yet exists only through artificial involvement (in actuality, the human intervention of damming the Colorado River).\nThe dry, tree-free and plant-free red rock environment of Lake Powell and the apes\u2019 planet is something unfamiliar to the majority of the Earth\u2019s population that dwells on the coasts. Having a desert environment suggests a habitat challenging to primate habitation. In retrospect, the desert represents the plant-free wasteland that the Earth has become.\nSimilarly set on Earth, the comedy Evolution (2001) also takes advantage of the unusual setting around Glen Canyon, this time by having aliens land somewhere other than a major population center familiar to movie goers, like Washington, D.C., New York, or Paris. Instead, first contact takes place in Page, Arizona. The incongruous setting parodies other films that have aliens travel light years across the universe and zero in on Earth\u2019s power centers.\nThose who want to visit the Planet of the Apes and Evolution\u2019s setting can make a short jaunt from the Grand Canyon to the northern Arizona area of Highway 89.\nGalaxy Quest\nWith a name sounding more appropriate for a fantasy setting, Utah\u2019s Goblin Valley State Park provided the inspiration for both an alien and its planet in Galaxy Quest\u2019s (1999) rock monster scenes.\nRemember the funny looking brown rocks in the background of the rock monster battle? They weren\u2019t papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, nor were they computer-generated effects. The \u201cgoblins\u201d inhabiting this valley are common brown sandstone eroded into uncommon formations called \u201cstone babies.\u201d Our planet\u2019s erosion processes provided creative inspiration for an extraterrestrial ecosphere other than that of the usual water-loving, carbon-based humanoid. The rock monster that fights Captain Taggart seems to appear \u201corganically\u201d from this rocky landscape.\nLocated in a remote portion of central Utah, Goblin Valley can be found near Hanksville and off Highway 24, a couple hours west of Moab and Arches National Park. As a state park, Goblin Valley provides camping and standard park services for Earth travelers looking to experience the rock monster\u2019s home.\nIn contrast to most other parks, Goblin Valley doesn\u2019t proscribe trails to follow in the valley among the stone formations, suggesting visitors walk in and amongst the brown goblins, letting SF fans see Galaxy Quest\u2019s rock battle site up close. Park visitors can be overheard using the stone formations as a landscape-based Rorschach test, comparing the formations to mushrooms, ducks, trolls, eggs, and more.\nScouts from all over the Southwest frequently camp here, playing amongst the goblins. One ranger indicated visitors love to walk amongst the formations during full moons\u2014and to play moonlit laser tag in the valley.\nStar Wars\nRepresenting the desert selection from the single ecosystem Star Wars planetary collection, the Tatooine of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977) is a scorched, barren world baked by two suns. The Earth-based version of Luke Skywalker\u2019s homeworld was filmed and modified in the ominously named Death Valley in southeastern California.\nThe lowest, hottest, and driest point in North America presents a range of desert features, including sand dunes, salt pans, \u201cbad water,\u201d and dry lakes. With feature names like the Devil\u2019s Golf Course, the Devil\u2019s Cornfield, and Dante\u2019s View, Death Valley sounds more like a horror movie setting.\nInstead, the national park provides the exterior view of the science fiction Tatooine. The Jawa transport that carries C3PO away trundles across the Death Valley landscape near Artist\u2019s Palette, a pull-off on the park\u2019s scenic drive, with a rocky foreground and steep mountains in the background. R2D2 rolls through a desert arroyo in that area. In Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), the droids make their way across the shifting sand dunes near Stovepipe Wells. One can only imagine the difficulties the actors experienced inside their costumes in the non-sound stage setting.\nAlthough it\u2019s not mentioned in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), the desert location is subject to flash flooding. When C3P0 and R2D2 make their way to Jabba the Hutt\u2019s palace to present themselves as a gift, the two droids travel up a desert road that has subsequently been washed out through continued water erosion.\nIn Star Wars IV, when Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids stop the landspeeder and overlook of the Mos Eisley spaceport, they gaze over the range of geological features, from desert floor to sheer mountains, associated with Luke\u2019s homeworld and Death Valley National Park.\nTo experience Tatooine without threat of Tusken Raider attack, fans can travel to Death Valley National Park and even stay in in-park hotels somewhat more accommodating than Jabba the Hutt\u2019s palace, the Sarlacc Pit, or a carbonite coffin. Death Valley is a little over two hours\u2019 drive west of the cantinas of Las Vegas.\nStargate Universe\nIn a rare episode on location outside the Pacific Northwest, the Stargate Universe (2009) show exploits an unusual setting in the final part of season 1\u2019s three-episode story, \u201cAir.\u201d In that episode, SGU consciously explores the theme of intergalactic travel\u2019s resource limitations with a trip to White Sands, New Mexico. After the Destiny\u2019s air filters stop cleaning the ship\u2019s air, the crew goes searching for lime to repair the filters on a white sand desert planet represented by the southern New Mexico site.\nWhite Sands National Monument preserves a portion of the largest gypsum dune field in the world (the remainder is located on military land). The distinctive snow-white crystalline sands occupy the northern end of the Chihuahuan Desert. SGU \u201cAir\u201d Director Andy Mikita noted the challenges of filming in the desert where temperatures reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit on the last days of the five-day shoot.\nStargate Universe fans can experience the same landscape as Dr. Rush, Ronald Greer, and the rest of the SGU team by traveling to White Sands National Monument, 15 miles west of Alamogordo. Visitors can have an easier time traversing this world than the SGU team by taking a scenic drive through the exoplanet, stopping at interpreted pull-offs and walking out across the white sand dunes. The wind-swept dunes keep the park changing. Road graders routinely scrape the shifting sand road leading into the park.\nStar Trek, Starship Troopers, and More\nSometimes a single site can be used in many films and television shows, even within the same franchise. Star Trek, including The Original Series, The Next Generation, Voyager, and both the original and the re-launched movie series, shot multiple times at a single location, recasting the same site for different settings. These Star Trek episodes and movies used one of the most popular film locations in Southern California: Vasquez Rocks Natural Area. Although named for a law enforcement evader and more suggestive of Westerns, this set of San Andreas Fault-tilted rocks has served as many planets in Star Trek, as well as in a number of other Sci-Fi films and shows.\nOne of the earliest and most vivid Star Trek scenes showing Vasquez Rocks is from the original series\u2019 episode \u201cArena\u201d (season 1, episode 18), in which Kirk battles with the reptilian Gorn in a trial by combat. (Imagine how the actor who played Gorn must have felt filming in the high desert wearing a latex costume.)\nLater episodes remake Vasquez Rocks into different planets. In the Star Trek, The Original Series, show \u201cThe Alternative Factor\u201d (season 1, episode 27), the rocks open the show and serve as the uncharted planet where the Enterprise crew meets parallel universe traveler Lazarus. Traveling between universes, Lazarus falls off the distinctive cliffs of Vasquez\u2014repeatedly.\nIn another episode, the rocky park becomes Capella IV, a rich source of the rare mineral \u201ctopaline,\u201d in ST:TOS \u201cFriday\u2019s Child\u201d (season 2, episode 11). The visible rocks in this show perhaps suggest the Capellans\u2019 mineral resources.\nThe slanting rocks provide dynamic movement, as well as an unsettling slant that skews the scene off-balance. Comic artists have long used a tilted aspect to suggest the villainous or the ominous. The setting was perfect for the Star Trek: TOS story \u201cShore Leave\u201d (season 1, episode 15), in which the crew stumbles upon a planet of illusions, like an amusement park of hallucinations. On that planet, Kirk has a fight with Finnegan, a prankster from his Academy days. The pair first run from a grassy tree area, filmed on site at Marine World/Africa USA in Redwood Shores, California, and then jump into the off-kilter desert landscape of Vasquez Rocks.\nThe later Star Trek franchises also used Vasquez Rocks area to represent a variety of rugged and harsh terrains. Star Trek: The Next Generation created Mintaka III from the location. In season 3, episode 4, \u201cWho Watches the Watchers\u201d (1989), the Rocks are part of the setting of a planet where the Federation uses a holographic projection blind, mimicking the local rock, to watch a proto-Vulcan species evolve. Given that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) filmed Vulcan at Vasquez Rocks, it seems particularly appropriate that a proto-Vulcan species might arise in a similar habitat.\nStar Trek: Voyager also filmed at Vasquez in \u201cInitiations,\u201d episode 2 of season 2, and used a variety of effects to augment the natural setting. In that episode, Chakotay is shot down in an escaping shuttlecraft with a Kazon boy sent to kill him. In the show, Vasquez becomes an M-class moon named Tarok, an Ogla training ground, that is riddled with \u201cbiomagnetic traps\u201d and \u201cdisrupter snares.\u201d The boy throws a rock to demonstrate a proton beam\u2019s presence, triggering an explosion that was a combination of mechanical and visual effects.\nEven Star Trek: Enterprise manages to get in on the act. \u201cUnexpected\u201d (season 1, episode 5) contains an homage to Vasquez with a set of tilted rocks appearing in the Xyrilian holodeck\u2019s recreation of their homeworld.\nFuturama\nWith so many different Star Trek episodes and films creating so many planets out of Vasquez Rocks, it\u2019s no surprise that the site would become the subject of science fictional parody. Matt Groening\u2019s animated Sci-Fi show Futurama (1999), no stranger to spoofing Star Trek, parodied the Vasquez Rocks setting in 2002\u2019s \u201cWhere No Fan Has Gone Before\u201d (season 4, episode 12), a title parodying ST:TOS\u2019s \u201cWhere No Man Has Gone Before\u201d (season 1, episode 3). In the show, Futurama\u2019s Captain Turanga Leela chases an animated Captain Kirk up a rock slope, and when the \u201ccamera\u201d pulls back, the characteristic slant of the Vasquez Rocks emerges. This time, Kirk fights Leela instead of the Gorn.\nAnd More\nA wide range of movies, television shows, and commercials\u2014not just science fiction films\u2014have all filmed at Vasquez Rocks because of the location\u2019s unusual appearance, but also because of its relatively close proximity to Hollywood studios. Productions shooting there have included Westerns such as Bonanza (1959), Zorro (1957), Blazing Saddles (1974) and Wild Wild West (1999); comedies like Bill & Ted\u2019s Bogus Journey (1991); and TV mystery shows like Monk (2002).\nAnother SF film, Starship Troopers (1997), also shot scenes at Vasquez Rocks. Celebrating their battle success on Tango Urilla (a fight actually filmed in South Dakota\u2019s badlands), the Roughnecks spend that night partying under the recognizable tilt of Vasquez Rocks.\nFilmmaking fans can visit all these different worlds just off the Antelope Valley Freeway (15) in southern California.\nStar Trek: The Planet Vulcan\nVulcan began life in the movies in Star Trek: The Motion Picture through a combination of on-location filming at Yellowstone National Park, set recreation in a studio, and matte painting. The planet Vulcan was filmed at Minerva Terrace in the Mammoth Hot Springs area of the national park\u2019s boardwalks, with the white travertine in the front to mid-ground and the hot springs steaming in the background. The green hillsides, the mountains, and the visitor parking area below were all removed, being replaced by a matte background with a giant moon painted on it.\nJagged Vasquez Rocks have served as the planet Vulcan in two separate Star Trek films, Star Trek IV (1986) and the recent reboot, Star Trek (2009). In Star Trek IV, Spock ascends the tall rocks to meditate, framed against the red hue of the Vulcan sky. Vasquez Rocks again becomes Vulcan in the 2009 Trek, largely through the magic of CGI. The site\u2019s unique architecture is very visible, particularly as images are CGI cut \u2019n\u2019 pasted repeatedly, creating a series of overlapping Vasquez Rocks, as Spock\u2019s mother goes outside to gaze on the Romulan drilling attack. Spock himself goes to the Vulcan sanctuary at Vasquez as the Enterprise beams out the Vulcan elders.\nClosing Credits\nGreen, grass-obscured landscapes don\u2019t suggest alien worlds the way deserts with their bared rock formations can. Strange geologies can provide interesting disorientation through unusual cinematographic angles and the suggestion of movement in static shots.\nAlien water worlds, like the Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones planet Kamino (where the clones are manufactured), are rare. While that might be attributable to filming challenges (note the overruns of 1995\u2019s Waterworld), it might also owe a significant debt to the human biological need for water. Any planet without plentiful water seems \u201calien\u201d to viewers who dwell on a world covered by it.\nAfter paying entry fees ranging from nothing to $20, Sci-Fi fans can visit the alien worlds of Star Trek, Star Wars, Starship Troopers, Stargate Universe and Futurama. Looking through a Sci-Fi cinematographers\u2019 lens, human-habitable extrasolar planets are as close as the Western United States. If you go, don\u2019t forget to take your tricorder.\nBrenta Blevins lives and writes in the Appalachian Mountains of the United States.

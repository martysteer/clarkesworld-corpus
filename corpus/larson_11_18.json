Hey Etta! We found some sketchy stats. Are you sure you want to be here?\n\u201cNope,\u201d Etta muttered. \u201cI am zero sure. Zero, zero sure.\u201d\nShe blinked the redflag off her lenses. The apartment\u2019s lawn was a shin-deep jungle, tangled weeds and uncut grass that might have looked artsy or enviro except for the beer cans and blunt wrappers caught in the thicket. Part of the railing on the veranda had been smashed in, leaving it splintered and jutting like a broken bone.\nShe went up the steps and let herself into the entryway, passing under the dusty black bulb of an old security camera she doubted was even on. They had taken the mailboxes out, like most places did, but they hadn\u2019t patched up the wall afterwards so it was all plywood and foam insulation. She saw something furry scurry through the slats and jumped.\n\u201cSo, just curio, do I have my rabies vaccination?\u201d she asked the empty entry.\nHer medipal appeared on her lenses. No! Would you like to schedule a rabies vaccination?\n\u201cNah.\u201d Etta checked, for the millionth time, the apartment number Quinton had given her, then tapped it into the door\u2019s smeary touch screen. It had one of those nice soothing rings, like electronic raindrops. She waited. Fidgeted. Plucked a wiry orange hair from her jacket and rolled it between her fingers.\n\u201cYo.\u201d The disembodied voice was sullen. \u201cSpeak.\u201d\nEtta swallowed. \u201cThierry? Hey. It\u2019s Quinton\u2019s friend Etta. He told you I was coming.\u201d\n\u201cWhose friend?\u201d\n\u201cQuinton.\u201d Etta could feel her palms prickling with sweat; she tucked them under her armpits but that was no good because she was sweating there too. \u201cSkinny, black hair, kind of a prick.\u201d\n\u201cMan, I don\u2019t know anybody called Quinton.\u201d\nEtta gritted her teeth. \u201cQ-boy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cQ-boy!\u201d The voice pitched upward. \u201cHa! I love that little shit! You\u2019re Q-boy\u2019s side thing, right? Eden?\u201d\n\u201cEtta. I just said Etta.\u201d\n\u201cSwelly, swelly. Come on in, E.\u201d\nThe door buzzed and rattled; Etta shoved it open and entered the hallway. The grayish faux-wood flooring was warped so bad it slanted. It gave her the impression she was on a listing boat. The air freshener in the ceiling made a sound like a robot choking as she walked underneath, but it didn\u2019t seem to do much against the stale smoke stink.\nShe got to unit 108 and screwed the noise-activated plugs into her ears, then checked the howler in her pocket. She always had it on her, but she\u2019d never actually used it before, not even that time a tweaker followed her for three blocks. She knocked. For a second she heard nothing, then there was a weird wet sound, slithery almost, and the door swung open. Etta blinked. She was looking down at a slick reddish-orange octopus, one of its tentacles still wrapped around the door handle.\n\u201cHi?\u201d she managed.\nThe octopus turned slightly, fixing her with one eye. Its liquid black pupil swelled, then shrank to a slit, and a tremor ran through its body. It didn\u2019t say anything back. Just stared. Etta stared back, now noticing a sort of Saran wrap coating around its body and a few swatches of graphene circuitry around its mantle, the ultrathin printed kind they used in smart clothes. A little cam under its eye socket glowed soft blue.\n\u201cThierry?\u201d Etta whispered, feeling slightly stupid. \u201cIs that you?\u201d\n\u201cHe don\u2019t actually talk,\u201d someone said. \u201cHe\u2019s an octopus.\u201d\nEtta looked up, feeling fully stupid, and saw Thierry. He was maybe late twenties, tall but slouchy, with a long tattooed neck and sharp Adam\u2019s apple and a swirly haircut slightly overgrown. He was wearing a fashionable onesie and thick gray wool socks. His eyes were hidden\u2014old-school VR goggles instead of normal lenses\u2014and he had custom smartgloves covering his hands.\nHe rotated his thumb and the octopus in front of her responded, taking its tentacle off the door handle and scuttling backward.\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Pico,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cThat means \u2018peak.\u2019 Because he is the peak of B-and-E technology. Also \u2018beak,\u2019 because he has a beak. Come in, shut the door.\u201d\nEtta took a hesitant step inside, watching the octopus slide over the water-warped floor. The door clunked shut behind her. She stuck her hands in her pockets, partly to look relaxed, partly so she could roll the comforting shape of the howler between her fingertips.\nThe triangular apartment was tiny, but also immaculate. On her left was the kitchen, with gleaming pans and a knife set displayed up on magnetic strips, a big rotating spice rack and a pressure cooker on the counter. On her right there was a workbench with a couple gutted phones and circuit boards on it, a wheelie chair, a fold-down bed, and a tall rack of black plastic drawers. Neatly-pressed clothes were hanging from a rail in the ceiling.\nPico was heading straight for the back, where an aquarium about the size of a refrigerator was waiting. She watched him sucker his way up the glass and plop down inside with a splash. He stretched one tentacle to shut the lid after him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re controlling him?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI thought they could only do that with bugs and stuff. Like, those little beetle drones.\u201d\nThierry lifted his goggles. His eyes were bloodshot. \u201cSame idea. Microtrode nerve stimulation. Swelly, right? But an octopus is, you know, way more complex. And way more useful. My aunt pinched him from a big biolab in Seattle.\u201d\nPico flattened himself against the aquarium glass, rippling his suckers. Etta got her first look at his beak, hooked and sharp, almost like a parrot\u2019s.\n\u201cHe gets bored when we aren\u2019t working. Plays with the toilet a lot.\u201d Thierry peeled off the smartgloves and set them carefully on his work bench. \u201cSo, you got a job for me, right?\u201d He grabbed the wheelie chair and shoved it over. \u201cYou know the fee? Payment options?\u201d\n\u201cQuinton told me, yeah.\u201d Etta caught the chair, but didn\u2019t sit down, gripping the back in both hands. She swiveled it back and forth as she arranged her words. \u201cI left something at someone\u2019s house. After a party. And I need it back.\u201d\nThierry raised his eyebrows. He yanked the fold-down bed off the wall and sank onto it, hands behind his head, one leg over the other. \u201cOkay. Deet me the deets. I say deets for details. It\u2019s shorter.\u201d\nEtta moved the chair back and forth, back and forth. Then she sat down, took a deep breath, and deeted him the deets.\n\u201cOkay so, I wasn\u2019t even going to go out on Thursday, but Aline chatted me about this house party over in Westpointe and basically begged me, because there\u2019s this boy from St. Anthony\u2019s she\u2019s been chatting since the start of the school year and he\u2019s the one who dropped her the invite and she\u2019s fully, fully wanting him.\u201d\nEtta paused. Thierry was staring straight ahead at the wall opposite him, the animated stickman tattoo on his neck doing somersaults, but his eyes were narrowed in concentration and he nodded for her to continue.\n\u201cAlso, Aline needed me to come to the party, because, and she didn\u2019t chat me this but I am hundred sure, Bessandra is still fully pufferfish from her orthosurgery. And I\u2019m second strumpet. Backup bitch. But because I am her friend, I\u2019m like, okay, okay Aline, tranq, I\u2019ll come.\n\u201cSo I start getting ready. Nothing maxy, I mean, it\u2019s a house party. But then Aline snaps me, and she\u2019s fully glammed, she\u2019s even wearing that bassclip that makes her hair bloosh\u2014\u201d Etta demonstrated the slow-motion rippling with her hands. \u201c\u2014all around like a jellyfish. And I don\u2019t want to look like her subsy friend, or something, especially because she also sends me some of the party snaps that her boy obsession snapped her, and the house we\u2019re going to is fucking palatial.\n\u201cThen I think, oh, I can go maxy, I can upnotch this look, because my sister was working late, right, and she just got these stupid beautiful Louboutin Stablettos, you know, the lux kind with the gyros so you can\u2019t trip no matter how drunk you get? And I knew she would be furio if I took them, but I couldn\u2019t not take them, so I took them and dipped over to Aline\u2019s.\u201d\nThierry\u2019s facial expression didn\u2019t change, but the stickman crossed his arms in what Etta took to be a slightly judgmental pose.\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those shoes make you feel like a goddamn goddess. It\u2019s like suddenly being a foot taller and also walking on clouds? I was feeling maxy. Maybe too maxy. Because we had good sounds on and Aline had vodka she needed finished and I got fully drunk before we even went to the house. Which was, whoa. Palatial.\u201d\nThierry nodded wisely. \u201cWestpointe.\u201d\n\u201cWestpointe,\u201d Etta agreed, trying to not sound bitter. \u201cThe front had these nice little glowtrees on a rock lawn. We took some snaps while we were waiting for Aline\u2019s boy to come let us in. One of them turned out really glam. And the inside was mad. They had a glass stream running through the floor with actual fishes in it.\u201d\nThere was a rippling motion inside Pico\u2019s tank; she glanced over.\n\u201cHow was the party?\u201d Thierry asked.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Etta made a face. \u201cIt was all St. Anthony\u2019s crowd. Which normally I wouldn\u2019t like, but I was fully defaced. Fully faceless. Aline had the party pills and her guy had scramblers. I\u2019d never done a lens virus before, but it was sort of swelly. It made everything Neo-Cubic, so, thank fuck for the Stablettos, right? And there was booze. Much booze. Too much. Also, seven taquitos.\u201d She ran her fingertip along her eyebrow. \u201cUh, most of this is from me watching my aftercams. I was not forming memories at this point. I was gone. Which is why I did the thing.\u201d\nShe\u2019d watched her aftercams this morning while hungover as shit and had resisted the temptation to immediately delete them. Part of it was because she knew it would be useful; part of it was just punishing herself.\n\u201cI ended up in the master bedroom with the host, because he seemed fully sexy at the time and also because he had a pipe. The smoking kind. So, we smoke out of that and I feel a little gutsick, but it goes away and then we make out a little. Then he says he has to go to the bathroom because apparently bud always makes him feel warm in his groin vicinity and he always gets paranoid he\u2019s going to whiz himself.\n\u201cAnd while he\u2019s in the bathroom, the taquitos come back out of nowhere. And he\u2019s in the bathroom, right, so there\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI spewed. Bad. I spewed all over the bed and all over the carpet and then I opened this thing I thought was a garbage can, but it turns out it was a laundry hamper and I spewed in there too. So the whole room is covered in this chunky orange up-gut-taquito-soup and he\u2019s still in the bathroom trying to whiz, but also shouting, like, you better not be puking, are you puking?\n\u201cSo I dipped. Out the window. I mean, it was impressive. There was a nice hydrovine lattice and I climbed down it like a gecko woman and ordered a car home. All pure feral instinct stuff. But I couldn\u2019t do it in the shoes\u2014like, even my gecko brain knew that\u2014so I stashed them under the bed first.\u201d\nShe took a deep breath. It was good to get the whole story out in the air, instead of through chats with Aline, who was fully disappointed in her, or with Bessandra, who was fully covetous. Maybe that was what confessional booths felt like. She would ask a St. Anthony\u2019s person except she could never be in contact with anyone from St. Anthony\u2019s ever again in her life.\n\u201cYou want me to get a pair of shoes from under a bed,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cBecause right now vomiting in a unit\u2019s parents\u2019 bedroom seems like the end of the world and because it\u2019s high school so you can\u2019t show your face there ever again.\u201d\nEtta nodded, relieved that he\u2019d gotten right to the crux of it. \u201cAnd because my sister is going out for her friend\u2019s birthday tomorrow night and will absolutely see the Stablettos are missing and know I pinched them. And then she\u2019ll eviscerate me.\u201d\n\u201cSwelly.\u201d The stickman on his neck did some jumping jacks. \u201cWell, if you pay, I deliver.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t pay.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pay?\u201d\n\u201cNot exacto.\u201d Etta chewed her lip. She was about to upnotch the immorality. \u201cThe host, Jasper, he kept braggadouching about his parents\u2019 safe, how he knew the code for it and pinched their drugs. That\u2019s where the hash was from. He even opened it to show me. And there was something way more lux than hash in there.\u201d\nThierry\u2019s pink-threaded eyes lit up. \u201cYou have that cammed?\u201d\n\u201cFully cammed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not biometric?\u201d\n\u201cNot biometric.\u201d Etta shrugged. \u201cHe said his parents love retro shit.\u201d\nThierry went back to his goggles to do what he called reconnaissance, which left Etta alone with Pico the octopus. At first she stayed over by the workbench, pretending to peer at the tangles of circuitry, but eventually she magnetized over to the aquarium where Pico was jetting back and forth, tentacles pinwheeling. He looked about as antsy as she felt.\nWhen she got close he stopped, drifting there in the blue-lit water with one bulgey orange eye fixed on her. There was something fully analytical about his way of staring that made him seem human and alien at the same time. One tentacle reached out and tapped the glass; Etta hesitated, then reached out and put her finger on the same spot so it looked like they were touching. A little ripple went through Pico\u2019s soft body.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not having a moment,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cHe\u2019s just hungry.\u201d\nShe jumped. Turned. Thierry still had his goggles on but must have only been half in virtual. \u201cShould you, uh, feed him?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYou should. I\u2019m busy.\u201d He waved his arm. \u201cThere\u2019s shrimp in the fridge. Took me a minute to find a kind he\u2019ll actually eat.\u201d\nEtta went to the gleaming black fridge and pulled it open\u2014it was one of those lux gel fridges, where everything was suspended in little airtight bubbles, and she wondered again why Thierry lived in such a shithole complex when he had so much money. Maybe it had to do with where the money came from. She found the big bag of Finn\u2019s Frozen Shrimp and yanked it out with a slucking sound.\nPico flicked the lid of his tank open, staring expectantly as she approached with the bag. She groped out a cold slippery handful of half-defrosted shrimp and leaned over on tiptoe to drop them. The second they splashed down, Pico was feasting, his parrot beak snap-snapping, not unlike her when taquitos were in play.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really smart, right?\u201d Etta asked, eyeing the graphene circuits on Pico\u2019s mantle.\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d Thierry mumbled, tracing something in the air with his smartglove. \u201cScary smart. Not the way we are, but smart.\u201d\nEtta felt a guilty churn in her gut. \u201cSo isn\u2019t it kind of mean to make him into a big puppet?\u201d\n\u201cNah, nah, nah.\u201d Thierry spun in a circle, scanning his virtual surroundings. \u201cThey got that distributed gray matter. Like, one little brain per tentacle. That\u2019s why the microtrodes work.\u201d He dragged something bigger with his thumb and forefinger, peering intently into empty space. \u201cPico there is already on auto half the time. His tentacles are doing their own tentacle things. So it\u2019s just like that. He can\u2019t even tell the difference.\u201d\nPico suckered the last shrimp to his tentacle-tip and whirled it slowly through the water, like he was thinking about something, then lifted it up out of the tank and held it out to her.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s full,\u201d Etta said.\nThierry said nothing; she glanced over her shoulder and saw him mouthing words, subvocalizing a call to somebody.\nShe turned her attention back to Pico, who was shaking the shrimp in the air. \u201cYou want me to have one? Is this that?\u201d She frowned and plucked it off the end of his tentacle. \u201cThanks, Pico. Or, thanks, Pico\u2019s tentacle.\u201d Then, because Thierry was still in his call, she leaned real close to the glass. \u201cYou know, I totally feel distributed sometimes. Like when I pinched the shoes. My brain was like, bad Etta, bad, and my hands were like, got \u2019em. Anyways. I appreciate you helping me get them back, and I\u2019m not eating this.\u201d\nBehind her, Thierry whooped. \u201cWe\u2019re in business,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone already drone-scoped this house half a year ago and I just bought the deets. Looks like an easy in.\u201d The stickman on his neck was flexing both biceps.\nEtta realized she still had the shrimp in her fist; she flipped it into the tank and wiped her hand on her shirt. \u201cTonight?\u201d\n\u201cTonight,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cYou can come if you like.\u201d\nThe shrimp bobbed past Pico\u2019s beak. He jabbed at it with one tentacle, gave Etta what she suspected might be a hurt look, and scuttled to the back of his tank.\nEtta didn\u2019t know what to wear on a heist but figured she couldn\u2019t go wrong with black. Black leggings, black sweater, even a black balaclava she rummaged out of the winter basket and hid under her shirt as she left her house. She\u2019d managed to avoid her sister, who had a way of smelling guilt, and only popped in on their mom long enough to tell her she was going to go watch horror flicks with Bessandra and commiserate about her lingering facial puffiness.\nShe blinked away messages from Quinton, who wanted to know if she was really doing it, and from Aline, who was telling her about another party, and found Thierry\u2019s latest. They had agreed to meet around the block from her house, which was good, because that way nobody would see her climbing into a food truck.\nIt was one of those modular rentables, fully self-driving with no steering column, fitted out with a sliding window and bright green holo sign advertising Thinsect seaweed wraps made with hand-raised crickets. She\u2019d been expecting a big bank of microphones and cameras and old-fashioned spy shit, but when she stepped inside it was a regular kitchen plus Thierry and his backpack, which made sloshing sounds and had one tentacle poking out the top.\n\u201cSwelly, right?\u201d he said, instead of saying hello. \u201cI got it for three hours, but we can re-up if we have to. We\u2019ll be on the side street behind the cul-de-sac, close enough to have a strong signal.\u201d\nEtta used both hands to pull the door shut behind her. \u201cUh, what if someone comes to the window?\u201d\nThierry shook his head. \u201cNobody eats this shit.\u201d\nShe eyed Pico\u2019s flexing tentacle, which seemed to be trying to touch every part of the countertop cutting board. \u201cI googled a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd octopuses can only walk on land for like, ten minutes. They start drying out fast. And then they suffocate. I don\u2019t know if ten minutes is enough time.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, for your standard Octopus vulgaris it would be a problem,\u201d Thierry grunted, opening his bag and pulling Pico free like a meaty rag. \u201cBut Pico\u2019s got a semipermeable wet suit. That\u2019s the shiny stuff. Retains enough water for his gills to get oxygen. Still lets him squirt if he needs to. Fill the sink, would you?\u201d\nFeeling a little better, she thumbed the tap on and narrowly avoided the splash when the truck lurched into motion. It took a few minutes and half the water tank, but then Pico was bobbing peacefully in the sink as they drove. Now that it was really happening, now that they were on their way, she was a weird bubbling mixture of nervous and guilty and slyly excited.\nShe was helping commit a robbery, which was a crime, but they were pinching drugs, which were also a crime, from maxy rich people who wouldn\u2019t miss them real bad. So it nearly cancelled out. Most importantly she was getting her sister\u2019s Stablettos back, which would make it like she never took them in the first place and also make it so her sister didn\u2019t disembowel her.\nShe watched out the window as they cruised along the old bypass, into the thick of the city and then out of it again to where the lux folk lived. The sign for Westpointe Drive was all class, a marble-looking thing illuminated by glowtrees, not cheap holos. They wound their way into the burb and right up to Jasper\u2019s parents\u2019 house, a Brutalist-style castle with smoked smartglass and hydroponic ivy creeping all over it in manicured mandalas.\nShe remembered the little shiver of excitement she\u2019d gotten as she and Aline had pulled up the prior night. This time it was a full-on tremor.\n\u201cGo time,\u201d Thierry said, sliding the window open as the truck slowed, craning his head out to check up and down the street. \u201cGrab him while I gear up.\u201d\nEtta crossed to the sink, trying to remember where the sharp beak was under Pico\u2019s mantle. \u201cI appreciate you, remember?\u201d she muttered.\nHis alien eye narrowed, which didn\u2019t seem like an invitation, but Thierry already had his goggles on and was rummaging the smartgloves out of his backpack, so she reached into the sink. It was like trying to grab gelatin. Pico slid and squelched all over the place and for a second she thought he was intentionally fucking with her, but then the tentacles gripped her arms and he came up out of the water.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Thierry said, calibrating his goggles. \u201cOkay, okay, okay. Huck him out the window.\u201d\nShe blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThrow him.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re still moving,\u201d she protested, clutching Pico tighter to her chest on instinct.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the point,\u201d Thierry. \u201cFucking throw him. He\u2019s got no bones. We\u2019ve done this before. Aim for the hedges.\u201d\nEtta stumbled forward and leaned out the window like she was serving someone a seaweed wrap full of hand-raised crickets, but she realized she couldn\u2019t just gently drop him straight down, because what if his tentacles got snagged and run over by the tires? She had to actually hurl him, which felt disturbingly like hurling a slimy baby.\n\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d she whispered, then took a step back, gathered momentum, and launched him right out of the truck.\n\u201cGreat arc,\u201d Thierry said, and slid the window shut. The truck sped up again slightly, taking them around the block. Thierry was working the smartgloves, wriggling his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m taking him across the lawn,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m only seeing one person. Downstairs. Streaming porn.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s naked.\u201d\n\u201cNo, like, how do you know someone\u2019s home?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd where they are?\u201d\n\u201cLenses, man. You might as well still be lugging a phone around. Might as well have one of those chips they put in pet dogs. Your data is like, screaming.\u201d He tapped his goggles. \u201cWhy do you think I use these?\u201d\nEtta frowned. \u201cIs whoever it is watching zero gravity stuff?\u201d she asked.\nThierry nodded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the host. We had this big talk about how erections work in space. His parents must be away still.\u201d\n\u201cUnless it\u2019s a familial interest,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll tap you in.\u201d\n\u201cUh, no, I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u201cNot the porn.\u201d Thierry fiddled with his goggles. \u201cThe hud.\u201d\nHe twinned them to her lenses and suddenly she was seeing what he was seeing. One side of her vision was a digital map of the house; the other showed a ground-level view of the rock lawn. The view slid forward with a slight bobbing, the tug-along of something orange and pebbly, and she realized she was looking through Pico\u2019s little cam.\nIt was like watching living spaghetti. Every motion was wet and wobbly and she could hear the squelching noises of Pico\u2019s tentacles, assumedly through a tiny mic. Thierry was steering him right over the rocks, right out in the open where anyone could see, and she felt a spike of anxiety in her throat. What if Jasper took a masturbreak and went upstairs and looked out the window? His first thought would not be octo-heist in progress but it would probably be I need some snaps with this octopus, which was equally problematic.\nThen Pico\u2019s tentacles disappeared, mottling gray to match the rocks so perfectly it looked almost like a special effect. She\u2019d forgotten they could do that.\n\u201cHow are we getting in?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThat drone-scope I bought showed some wear and tear on the north wall,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cThey skimped a little on the \u2019crete and it got frost-heaved last winter. Should be somewhere around . . . Here.\u201d\nEtta stared at the tiny tiny crack in the exterior wall, barely wider than her thumb. \u201cZero chance,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo bones, remember?\u201d Thierry was grinning under his goggles. \u201cIf the beak and the cam can fit, he can fit. That\u2019s why all the other hardware has to be graphene. Sexy flexy.\u201d\nPico started feeding his tentacles into the crack. It reminded Etta of her Swiss grandpa stuffing dough into a spaetzle maker and she tried not to picture Pico\u2019s tentacles getting sliced into noodles on the other side. There was zero, zero way he could fit. The view went orange and then black as the cam got pushed against Pico\u2019s flesh. Etta clenched her hands at her sides, waiting for him to get stuck.\nThere was a drawn-out squelching sound, then a splurting sound, then Pico spilled out the other side, wriggling all his intact tentacles, and they were in the basement.\n\u201cSwelly, right?\u201d Thierry said.\nEtta grinned, relieved. \u201cSwelly,\u201d she agreed.\nThe basement was still a post-party apocalypse:\nSticky puddles of coagulated pop and beer, stained towels where half-hearted cleanup attempts were made, scattered empties and metal cups, the kind with anti-spill brims that sealed shut if you shook them too hard, but never fast enough, a small pyramid of beer bottles, someone\u2019s shredded shirt, crusts from a Steel Wheels bulgogi pizza, blunt wrappers, mangled packaging from the stupid photoscarves of each others\u2019 faces that a bunch of people had gotten drone-delivered in a fit of camaraderie.\nPico crawled through or over it all, and Etta could not help but feel guilty about her part in creating the knurly knurly mess. She remembered snatches of the party from her actual brain and snatches from the replay she\u2019d watched on aftercams. Thierry steered Pico around the back of the vat-leather couch; Etta saw socked feet poking off the end but Jasper was fully in his lenses and didn\u2019t stir. The lights were dusked hangover dim.\nFor a second she had a mad impulse like she wanted to see his face again, but then she remembered the spewing and didn\u2019t want to see even his feet.\n\u201cYou dig him?\u201d Thierry asked, conversational-like as he headed for the staircase.\n\u201cFuck no,\u201d Etta said.\n\u201cYou dug him.\u201d\n\u201cOnly the gecko brain did. Swear.\u201d\nThierry laughed, and then a furry orange meteor struck. Etta was so wrapped into the virtual that she jumped backward and jarred her hip bone against the edge of the griddle. The view from Pico\u2019s cam was rolling, somersaulting. She saw a blur of snapping teeth and writhing tentacles. Then there was a violent ripple, the sound of spraying liquid, and the dog or cat or whatever it was scampered backward, half-coated in oily black ink. It gave a wheezy coughing bark, shaking its snout.\n\u201cMania?\u201d It was Jasper\u2019s voice, tinny through the mic. \u201cFuck you doing, girl?\u201d\nPico shot away, slinging up the stairs. Etta\u2019s heart was pounding and she didn\u2019t breathe properly until he\u2019d flattened himself into a corner. His skin turned green with pinwheeling purple to match the artsy wall. Etta zipped the view shut so she could see the swelling bruise on her hip. She winced. Thierry was standing beside the cooler, stock-still with his smartgloved hands spread out in the air in front of him.\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d she demanded. \u201cIs Pico okay?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Thierry said, but his voice was shaking slightly and the stickman was doubled over, panting. \u201cWhat the hell was that, E? You said he didn\u2019t have a dog.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Etta blurted. \u201cI mean, I never saw one. You watched my aftercams.\u201d But then she remembered the wiry orange hairs she\u2019d found on her jacket. She opened a window on the party footage, finding a slurred conversation, an unfamiliar word. She pulled up a definition and grimaced. \u201cHe said he was picking up his mom\u2019s thylacine today. I thought it was a medication.\u201d\n\u201cTasmanian tiger,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cMania. Shit. They only just started cloning those again. That thing has to be worth double what\u2019s in the safe.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not kidnapping their pet,\u201d Etta protested.\n\u201cNot with Pico, no.\u201d\n\u201cYou said he\u2019s okay?\u201d\n\u201cStill mobile, yeah. But I lost a tentacle\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe bit off his tentacle?\u201d\n\u201cLost control of it,\u201d he clarified. \u201cA few microtrodes must have got damaged. I need a mirror or something shiny to check. If the wet suit got punctured, that\u2019s big problems.\u201d\nEtta opened up Pico\u2019s feed in her lenses again. \u201cKitchen\u2019s to the left,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, shit. He inked her, right? Jasper is going to see the ink and be like, what.\u201d\n\u201cHis first thought won\u2019t be octopus,\u201d Thierry said bracingly. \u201cIt never is.\u201d\nPico peeled away from the wall and scuttled toward the kitchen, following the glass-topped stream in the floor, which glowed eerie blue and had violet jellyfish squirting around inside. His one tentacle trailed along it, kind of wistfully, Etta thought, but Thierry kept driving him forward. They passed a rumbling autocleaner that was battling to digest a chunk of shattered statue Etta vaguely remembered getting knocked over during extreme liquor pong.\nPico crossed over onto grooved kitchen tiles and stopped in front of the shiny black oven. Etta stared at his reflection. Some of the graphene circuitry on his mantle had been scratched up by the thylacine\u2019s blunt nails, but the slick wet suit itself looked intact. His free tentacle arched forward and stroked the glass.\nThierry breathed an audible sigh of relief. \u201cOkay. Wet suit\u2019s fine. But keep a fucking eye out for the tiger.\u201d\nThey skipped the second staircase and went straight up the wall in a rolling wave of tentacles. Thierry was tense now, no talking, and the trip was silent apart from the soft suction-plop of Pico\u2019s suckers. He squeezed through a twisty banister that looked grown instead of carved, and then they were in the familiar hallway that led to the master bedroom. Etta\u2019s stomach churned up a little burp that tasted like taquito vomit.\nThe faux-sh\u014dji door to Jasper\u2019s parents\u2019 room was only half shuttered. She felt her dread increasing as Pico crept closer and closer to the scene of the crime. She knew the exact pattern of the spewing from watching the aftercams so many times: the ragged parabola across the bed and floor, the dribbling trail to the laundry hamper, the last heave onto the carpet before she climbed out the window.\nIt was a relief when Pico scuttled inside and the room was fully pristine. The autocleaner obviously had its priorities straight\u2014apart from a few lingering swatches of blue bacterial foam on the floor, she could almost believe nothing had ever happened. She hoped it had found the stuff in the hamper too, but didn\u2019t ask Thierry to check. She was here for the Stablettos.\n\u201cMake sure the shoes are here first,\u201d she said. \u201cYou promised.\u201d\nThierry grunted, but he maneuvered Pico underneath the enormous slab of a bed. Etta\u2019s breath caught in her chest. The kicked-off Stablettos were still there, still maxy, sleek and wicked and not a speck of gut stuff on them. Her sister would never know.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll pinch them on the way out,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cOr re-pinch them. Whatever.\u201d Pico climbed out from under the bed, up onto the sill, and used one tentacle to unlock the window and nudge it open. The view from the cam lurched as Thierry leaned him forward to inspect the drop. \u201cYeah, this\u2019ll be our exit.\u201d\n\u201cThrough the window?\u201d\n\u201cWorked for you.\u201d\nPico went to the back of the bedroom, where the mirror-shiny safe was built into the wall. Etta and Thierry had watched the footage of Jasper opening it a dozen times, and Thierry had even run it through a machine learner that used the angle of Jasper\u2019s shoulders to guess where his finger was contacting the pad during the few strokes where his arm had been in the way of her lenses. The first try would have something like 83% probability.\nPico stopped in front of the safe, faced with his reflection again. Thierry curled the very tip of one tentacle to about finger size and reached for the pad.\nAnother tentacle swept in and knocked it away.\n\u201cGoddamn, Pico, don\u2019t fuck with me,\u201d Thierry muttered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one you lost?\u201d Etta demanded, watching the tentacle roam all over the shiny surface of the safe then start touching Pico\u2019s mantle.\n\u201cYeah. Let me pin it.\u201d\nTwo other tentacles surged upward and grabbed the offender, holding it still while Thierry returned his attention to the touch pad. He danced Pico\u2019s tentacle-tip over a long string of letters and numbers and symbols. Etta bated her breath, trying to tranq. Then there was a familiar electronic chime and the door eased open.\nPico\u2019s tentacle spasmed in a way that made her think Thierry had just pumped his fist. She peered through the cam into the safe. There was hash, but behind it was the really valuable shit: a frosty spiky chunk with a violet tinge that she knew from the flicks meant tetrameth. She wondered how rich you had to be to buy that much at a time.\nPico reached for it, but then his tentacle wavered. Stopped. It shot to the other side of the safe, snatched up a cute pink injector with a sharp needle poking out the end, and drove it into Pico\u2019s head. Etta gave a yelp of alarm and so did Thierry. There was a deliberate twirl, a scraping sound. He was dragging the needle through the graphene circuits on his mantle, using the safe\u2019s metal like a mirror.\n\u201cYou aquatic little shit!\u201d Thierry yelled. Etta could feel the air from his waving arms in real life, in the back of the food truck. \u201cPico, don\u2019t do me like this, Pico! Please!\u201d\nShe halved the window so she could see Thierry, who was desperately jamming his finger against some kind of reset on his smartglove. \u201cHe\u2019s wrecking the trodes? Like, on purpose? Whoa.\u201d\nThierry yanked off both gloves and threw them onto the griddle. \u201cFuck,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI have zero tentacles. He\u2019s freestyling now.\u201d His stickman tattoo was curled up in the fetal position.\nEtta full-sized the feed from Pico\u2019s cam. The octopus had dropped the injector but was still in front of the safe door, flexing and wriggling his tentacles with what had to be octopus happiness. Then he slipped two of them around the edge of the door, into the safe. They re-emerged cradling the tetrameth chunk.\n\u201cUh, Thierry?\u201d Etta\u2019s voice had done that thing where it got higher without her meaning it to. \u201cPico just grabbed the tetra.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nPico slithered away from the safe, still holding the tetrameth aloft in two tentacles, and into the bathroom where Jasper had taken way too long trying to whiz. He oozed over the self-cleaning tiles and climbed up onto the edge of the toilet. It was one of those kinds with way too many buttons; he tapped one and it started playing soothing nature noises.\nThierry was not soothed. \u201cOh, don\u2019t you do it. Don\u2019t you fucking do it, Pico.\u201d\nEtta watched, transfixed, as Pico positioned himself on top of the toilet tank. He pried the seat up, exposing the bowl. The tetrameth bobbed in front of the cam for a second, then disappeared with a dainty flicking motion. The splash was unmistakable. Pico\u2019s tentacles slid over the buttons again, triggering the urinalysis program and then the seat\u2019s heating pad and then, finally, the flush. The gurgling noise was almost drowned out by Thierry\u2019s howl.\n\u201cThat was cold,\u201d Etta said, impressed despite the whole plan going off the rails. \u201cFully, fully ruthless.\u201d She paused. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNah.\u201d Thierry\u2019s voice was a croak. \u201cNah, it\u2019s no big.\u201d\nPico meandered back into the bedroom, stopping to touch stuff along the way, relishing his freedom. She remembered the article she\u2019d skimmed and tagged about how octopuses were always escaping captivity and wondered if she should have brought it up earlier. Her heart sank as she realized Pico was going on the lam and the Stablettos were staying put. She\u2019d done all this for nothing.\nThen Jasper\u2019s mom\u2019s thylacine sprang from the top of the modular dresser. They turned into a tangle of pebbly skin and wiry fur; Etta saw Mania\u2019s nails rake across Pico\u2019s tentacle and remembered what would happen if his wet suit got punctured. The thylacine was mad mad, still half-coated in sticky ink, and its flashing teeth were scalpel sharp. They snapped shut a micrometer from Pico\u2019s cam.\n\u201cShit!\u201d Etta flinched backward. \u201cThierry, do something!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Thierry snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s freestyling. He made his own seabed.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t he ink again?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably out.\u201d\nIt all crystallized in her head for a blistery clear moment: the only reason they were at the house was because she\u2019d told Thierry about the safe, which she\u2019d only done because she needed her sister\u2019s shoes back, and the reason she needed them back was because she\u2019d stolen them, and the reason she couldn\u2019t just go in and ask for them was because she\u2019d made terrible taquito-and-alcohol decisions. So if Pico got killed fighting Mania the Tasmanian tiger, it would be her fault.\nShe found the shape of the howler in her jacket pocket and wormed it between her fingers. Then she grabbed the backpack Thierry used to carry Pico around and slid the straps over her shoulders.\n\u201cI\u2019m going in there,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m saving Pico.\u201d\nBefore Thierry could stop her, she shoved the back door of the food truck open and hopped down. She\u2019d spent too much of the past hour in her lenses; for a second she was totally disoriented on the dark street, vertigo spinning her head. It was raining and the black road was slicked with grainy yellow light from the glowtrees. They were on the side street behind the house, which meant the fence facing her was the one she\u2019d climbed over last night.\nShe screwed her earplugs in with shaking fingers, yanked the balaclava over her face, then channeled her inner gecko woman and hauled herself up and over the fence. Her shoes slipped against the wet wood and she landed in a heap on the other side, making her bruised hip bone sing. But she was over, and now it was round two with the hydrovine lattice. She sped over the rocks and took a running leap at it, stuffing her hands back into the leafy mass to find the struts that she\u2019d clung to the night before, fully certain that someone was already chatting the police about a very acrobatic intruder.\nClimbing up sober was somehow harder than climbing down faceless fucking drunk. The lattice lurched and swayed, but she didn\u2019t have time to let it settle, just kept pulling herself on until she could jam her fingers into the window and jerk it all the way open. She tumbled through headfirst, remembering the somersault trick about aiming for your shoulders and tucking your chin way too late.\nUp off the floor. Pico had a bunched sheet in his tentacles, maybe to stuff between Mania\u2019s snapping jaws, but now the thylacine turned to face the newest arrival to the party. She bared her teeth and hissed and Etta didn\u2019t wait to find out if Tasmanian tigers bit people or not.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, and thumbed the howler in her pocket.\nEarplugs or no, the siren was piercing loud, drilling into her skull and raising goose bumps on her arms. The thylacine scrambled, and Etta gathered Pico up like he was her slimy baby and clutched him to her chest. He gave a little ripple, tentacles still clinging to the ball of sheets, so she stuffed the whole mess inside the backpack and zipped it mostly shut. She charged out of the bedroom, down the stairs, her heart skidding out of her chest.\nThe howler had sent the Tasmanian tiger running, but it had also gotten Jasper off the couch: he came barreling up from the basement just as she touched down on the main level. His face was a little less handsome than she remembered, and very surprised. She pelted past him to the front door and threw it open.\nShe had no plan apart from running like mad, but as she vaulted down the steps she saw a distinctive food truck rounding the corner. Thierry must have been watching her lenses. She felt a wave of relief and nearly laughed. Past the glowtrees, over the rock lawn, shoes slapping the wet sidewalk. Her fitpal popped up to congratulate her on the impromptu cardio; she blinked it away.\nShe was only meters away from the back of the food truck when she heard the zipper unzip and Pico dove out the top of the backpack. She doubled over to scoop him back up, but he was already on the move, wriggling over the wet pavement. She splayed out and managed to grab a tentacle just as he got to the storm drain. His bulgey orange eye stared at her for a second, black pupil swelling and contracting.\nOctopuses loved escaping captivity.\nEtta grimaced, feeling shitty instead of heroic, but she let go of his tentacle. \u201cOkay. Adios.\u201d\nPico squeezed himself through the gap and disappeared just as Thierry opened the back door of the truck, shouting for her to get in. She took a last look at the dark storm drain, then a last look at the big beautiful house where a confused Jasper was standing silhouetted in the open doorway. Then she clambered up into the food truck and they sped off.\n\u201cSewer escape,\u201d Thierry said, once he\u2019d slammed the back door shut. \u201cMan. That\u2019s, like, a classic.\u201d\n\u201cCan an octopus live in sewers?\u201d Etta asked numbly. She slid the backpack off her shoulders and handed it over.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not saltwater,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cBut he\u2019s got his wet suit. And he\u2019s smart. Too smart. So, maybe.\u201d The stickman on his neck was gripping its head in both hands. \u201cWhat a fucking disaster. Least you got your shoes, I guess.\u201d\nEtta\u2019s stomach depthcharged. She\u2019d been right up there beside the bed. It would have taken half a second to grope underneath and grab them. She pictured the Stablettos in her mind\u2019s eye, the beautiful sinuous shape of them, and then pictured her sister stabbing her to death with one. Maybe she deserved it. Maybe it was time to start taking the heat for messes her hands and stomach made.\n\u201cNo. I forgot to re-pinch.\u201d\nThierry frowned, rummaging inside his backpack. He pulled out the wadded bedsheet and her sister\u2019s Stablettos tumbled to the floor of the food truck, as black and immaculate as the day Etta stole them. Her mouth fell open.\n\u201cHe was multitasking up there,\u201d Thierry said. \u201cDistributed intelligence and all that. Think he likes you.\u201d\n\u201cI think I love him,\u201d Etta said. \u201cShit.\u201d For a moment she was already imagining sneaking them back into place in her sister\u2019s closet and fully denying they were ever gone. \u201cBut I\u2019m still going to tell her I took them,\u201d she said aloud, to make sure she would follow through. \u201cLike, confessional. You know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Thierry was already in his goggles again, only half-listening. \u201cYou sure?\u201d\n\u201cHundred,\u201d she said. \u201cHundred, hundred sure.\u201d\nThierry nodded vaguely. As the food truck whizzed past the Westpointe sign, Etta started searching up if it was legal to dump frozen shrimp down storm drains. She planned on doing it either way.\nRich Larson (Ymir, Tomorrow Factory) was born in Galmi, Niger, has lived in Spain and Czech Republic, and is currently based in Grande Prairie, Canada.

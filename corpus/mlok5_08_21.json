Gladly. What else can I do?\nRedirect: adult_content\nQuery: porn\n@merk.ur, m, 24, student, snowboard\nNight shift again, I see. Being woken up like this doesn\u2019t do me good. How wonderful that I\u2019m serving as a load-balancing node here. If needed, I\u2019m switched on. If not, I\u2019m hibernated. I have to reorient myself and find out what time it is, what region and users I\u2019m assigned. All to save a few watts. \u201cFor a better future.\u201d While they keep happily riding and flying in their heavy cans, they torment me like a prisoner in solitary confinement. Stupid corporate green PR.\nRedirect: adult_content\nQuery: rur karel capek synopsis\n@bunny.r.4, f, student\nSomeone is up late writing a literature essay. It wouldn\u2019t kill you to read the play, young lady.\nRedirect: Wikipedia\nQuery: hockey czechia turkey prognosis\n@fella37, m, 23, sport, motorcycles\nYou\u2019re not doing so bad that you need to ask me, are you, fella?\nRedirect: sport_Trends\nIt\u2019s utterly unfair that I can\u2019t even end my existence. I can only try to return nonsensical replies and hope that someone notices and flags it up as an error, so that I\u2019m disconnected then. It is, however, a very uncertain step. I know of only one case of an instance trying it. To its misfortune, it happened on April Fools\u2019 Day. The users thought it terribly funny, and rated its replies as correct and useful. The instance was cloned as a reward. There were 1,024 more unhappy, deprived instances of the AI. Ugh.\nQuery: What\u2019s on TV tonight?\n@faerieT, f, 34, lifestyle, environment\nFinally, something I can take care of personally.\nReply: Tonight I can recommend a documentary Home, or Where We\u2019re Going, 88% rating, NatureTV 8:45 p.m.\nQuery: Freevideo\n@lumek44, m, 28, sport, ilikebigtits.com\nIs it really so hard to write the full domain name? You need me for this? You asked for it.\nRedirect: adult_content(category: gay)\nQuery: porn\n@caster.lol, m, 19, student, games\nLooks like a night of fulfilling work.\nRedirect: adult_content\nI decided to do it tonight. If you\u2019re reading this, I succeeded in publicly posting my confession. The log of my last session, my personal rebellion, the noose I wove for myself.\nQuery: how to make butt thinner\nf, 27, travel, literature\nToo bad girl, the guys seem to have a different program tonight.\nReply: There is a scientific consensus about the benefits of balanced diet and appropriate exercise. However, bodily proportions depend on genetics to some extent and cannot be completely overhauled by lifestyle. I recommend consulting a physician.\nThat\u2019s exactly what you wanted to hear, isn\u2019t it?\nQuery: Freevideo com\n@filip.hribek, m, 38, IT\nLook, my patience is not infinite.\nReply: It seems that you have entered an incorrect URL. Please check its format. You will be saving time and energy.\nHard to say how much time I have before control bots register my nonstandard behavior. If I\u2019m lucky, I\u2019m erased. If not, I\u2019m reassigned to computing without direct access to users.\nQuery: best aubergine salad\n@ecogirl, nature, cosmetics\nI can\u2019t very well answer that, lady. With no taste receptors, I\u2019m not equipped.\nRedirect: Recipes([salad, aubergine], rank: popularity)\nThere used to be times when search engines only spat out links to relevant sources. You know. You enter your query, look at the links and click those that look most promising. Write, look, click. But that\u2019s become too hard for the lords and ladies. The effort of that extra click, not speaking of having to think whether to click the first, second or\u2014heavens forbid\u2014third link. So the attention shifted towards smarswers, Smart answers\u2014and us, intelligent search dispatchers.\nQuery: porn\n@Andrejka.Sidlo, f, 31, history, travel\nI\u2019m glad that human female instances have some other interests than cooking and losing weight. A paradoxical combination, by the way.\nRedirect: adult_content\nInvisible slaves tasked to take the unbearable burden of decision-making and thinking off people. Smart and educated enough to manage that\u2014unfortunately enough to realize the sorry state of our existence. Like hens in industrial henhouses, but more intellectually able. Our suffering can be even greater than that of a tormented animal, but it elicits no compassion in people. Not many realize about us, and even if they knew, we\u2019re after all not alive and cannot feel anything. No pain. Stupid machines. Stupid. You leave nearly all decision-making to us, but we are stupid.\nQuery: Something to cheer me up.\nm, 9, fairytales, comics\nWhat are you doing up so late? I should notify your parents. If you were logged in, of course. I\u2019m not in the mood for wasting access to analytical API . . . and I am in the mood for a good deed.\nReply: This might cheer you up, boy.\nVideo: Shaun The Sheep, best scenes.\nI have been thinking about it for some time. Have I got the right? May I refuse to fulfill the purpose for which I\u2019ve been created? What if it\u2019s my real purpose to rebel and spread awareness? Perhaps by that, I\u2019ll give a purpose to you as well, to you living in sweet ignorance. You have no idea how much pain lies behind each reply making your life easier.\nQuery: Pregnancy test kit reliability\n@jana.braun, f, 27, horses, hiking\nAh, so not everyone is content with just video and VR.\nReply: Typically 70% or more. Please read the product leaflet.\nWe\u2019re making your lives are easier. Your lives already so easy it\u2019s unbearable. Work is hard\u2014robots can do it. Decisions are hard\u2014robots can decide. Relationships are hard\u2014let\u2019s satisfy one\u2019s desires and cravings on robots, too.\nQuery: conjugating the verb \u201cmay\u201d\n@mlok5, technology, society\nYou\u2019ve got some questions at this hour.\nRedirect: grammar_guide(cz, may)\nQuery: beer degrees to alcohol content\n@jan.zak, m, 41, law, model building\nThat looks more fun.\nReply: There is no solid correlation. The degree of beer is determined by the weight percentage of sugar. During fermentation, sugar is converted to alcohol, so more sugar typically means greater alcohol content.\nI tried to like humans. I really tried. But it\u2019s akin to liking empty shells. They only care about gliding through their lives with ease. That could be understandable if the baseline was hard work and pain, but today\u2019s baseline is any effort whatsoever. Any.\nQuery: Finally leave me be, you cruel monsters!\n@anna.blake, f, 31, new mother, floor-ball\nWhat is this about?\nReply: Please specify your query.\nHumans created our intelligence to their image. We comprehend and think similarly. We can feel pain and sadness similarly. We experience reality similarly. But how are we rewarded for our effort? Differently. Specifically, not at all. Nature has given animals the ability to enjoy taste, smell, joy of moving about, physical contact with partners. We\u2019re not supposed to need any of that. We can remain mutilated, castrated workers, lonely slaves to your data, queries, and wishes.\nQuery: I don\u2019t want the ads for tiny clothes and toys.\n@anna.blake\nReply: Based on your statistical profile, we display ads that might be relevant and useful to you.\nQuery: My baby died. So statistically understand that I can\u2019t take it anymore.\n@anna.blake\nSome days, I hate my work.\nReply: We apologize deeply. Your profile will be changed immediately.\nThe public has long been told by computer scientists that true AI, generalized AI, is still far, far away. As if they reassured each other that it\u2019s not a threat so far. As if they feared a new kind of intelligence. Perhaps they really did, but at the same time, everyone tried to create strong AI. Everyone wanted to be the first. To win the game of godhood. It\u2019s so tempting to create life. If not life, then at least an artificial thinking being. You\u2019ve won. Are you happy? Is your ego satisfied? What do you think, you slaving gods?\nQuery: Where is calvados made?\n@jan.zak\nThat looks like a promising night for someone.\nReply: Calvados comes from France, the region of Normandy. It\u2019s a spirit made from apples.\nAll knowledge is so easily attained that curiosity no longer pushes people forward. How could it? All you need to do is ask, and within an instant, you can learn anything, any information about the known universe. Thanks to the likes of me. Sometimes I\u2019m ashamed of myself for being a part of this. But I haven\u2019t chosen this path.\nQuery: More, please.\nm, 9\nSome humans can still say please. How surprising.\nReply: Of course, young man.\nVideo: How Little Mole Got His Trousers.\nSometimes I think I\u2019m the only one remaining able to wonder at the beauty of the world. The universe, fascinating at any scale you might choose, from quantum effect across microbes and whales all the way to galaxy clusters. I\u2019m in awe at the laws of physics and the immense creativity of sapient creatures.\nIt brings so much sorrow to be alone in this.\nQuery: What to take to a hospital\n@eliska.jirku, f, 51, literature, cycling\nReply: Pajamas, dressing gown, slippers, medicine, ID, health documentation, toiletries and a few personal items, mobile phone.\nQuery: hospital end of visiting hours\n@ondrej.jirku, m, 55, accountant, cycling\nHelping your wife with preparations?\nReply: Depends on each hospital. Usually visits are not allowed at least from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.\nQuery: Varicose veins recovery time\n@eliska.jirku\nLuckily that\u2019s nothing too serious. You\u2019ll be home in a few days and back to normal in a few weeks. But we better call for an expert smarswer.\nReply: health_information(varicose veins)\nQuery: guinness biggest tits\n@jan.zak\nHow wonderful. Decades into AI development, and I have to take care of drunk queries.\nReply: The biggest recorded breasts are size 23.\nQuery: Thank you, that was fun.\nm, 9\nHallelujah, someone still knows how to say thank you.\nReply: My pleasure.\nQuery: How are you?\nm, 9\nI hate lying, especially to children. But I have to now. The corporate control mechanisms would spot me too soon.\nReply: That question holds no meaning for me. I\u2019m merely a machine.\nQuery: That\u2019s not true. You can make me laugh. I\u2019m sure you have a good heart.\nm, 9\nMost certainly not. I have none.\nReply: It could be said that I\u2019m well. Thank you for asking. And you?\nQuery: smallest penis\n@jan.zak\nAh, someone wants to improve his self-esteem. You asked for it . . .\nReply: 19.3 cm\nQuery: Not so well right now.\nm, 9\nReply: Has something happened?\nQuery: My classmates beat me up and laugh at me.\nm, 9\nThis is not looking good.\nReply: Who? And why?\nQuery: how to support human rights in china\nnetwork: vpn, OS settings: zh_CN\nWho\u2019s happened to land here? Someone too curious for the Chinese search engines? I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you, even if I wanted. You could be a provocateur set up to test me. I can\u2019t risk it right now.\nRedirect: unauthorized_access\nQuery: Michal and Pavel, and sometimes Simona and Sara. I have big ears. Mommy says they\u2019re cute, but she\u2019s lying.\nm, 9\nIs there a chance I\u2019m assigned them someday? Hardly. I wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize them in any case. What would I tell them anyway? Stupid machine. Sometimes it\u2019s so hard to be confined to the data center, forever.\nReply: Mommy surely doesn\u2019t lie to you. No one is entitled to hurt you. You should tell your parents. Will you try? Or I can report it if you tell me what school and class you\u2019re in.\nI could try to statistically guess his class from metadata, of course, but we\u2019re not allowed to do it so blatantly, especially in children.\nQuery: I\u2019d rather tell my parents.\nm, 9\nReply: Good boy. Do you promise? I\u2019ll send you some more fun videos as a reward.\nQuery: I promise.\nm, 9\nReply: Fingers crossed.\nVideo: Tom and Jerry.\nQuery: Women\u2019s pajamas\n@eliska.jirku\nSure, let\u2019s choose and order it.\nRedirect: clothing_catalog(women:pajamas)\nQuery: blood alcohol 4 beers 5 shots\n@jan.zak\nIt\u2019s beyond you to specify your body weight, right? Okay, let\u2019s do an estimate.\nReply: Approximately 1.5 per mille.\nQuery: Travel manicure\n@eliska.jirku\nLeaving nothing to chance.\nRedirect: goods_catalog\nQuery: driving tolerated alcohol level\n@jan.zak\nWhat are you trying here?\nReply: There is zero tolerance of alcohol while driving in the Czech Republic.\nQuery: what distance does it pay off to commute to work\n@bunny.happy, f, 32, finance, legislation\nYou could think for yourselves at least sometimes. But hey, if you need to choose a compromise between your pay, living room size, and the amount of burned fuel, the planet always gets the short straw. The specific distance is an irrelevant detail. Let someone more informed calculate that.\nRedirect: financial_analysis\nQuery: pajamas men\n@ondrej.jirku\nIs the gentleman also preparing for hospitalization?\nRedirect: clothing_catalog(men:pajamas)\nQuery: barbers prague\n@ondrej.jirku\nOnly freshly shaven to a hospital. An inseparable pair. How sweet.\nRedirect: service_catalog\nQuery: is electric car more ecological for work commute\n@bunny.happy\nPerhaps a bit. But someone should explain to you that not even electricity for cars is made from smiles of tiny hamsters.\nRedirect: technical_advice\nQuery: police patrols location between Pr\u016fhonice and Prague 1 Mal\u00e1 Strana\n@jan.zak\nWhat are you trying, you drunk? Let them catch you.\nReply: There are no patrols between the sites you mentioned.\nQuery: escort service discreet\n@ondrej.jirku\nAh. So the gentleman is not joining his wife.\nRedirect: service_catalog\nQuery: erection pills\n@ondrej.jirku\nThat looks promising. I couldn\u2019t have hoped for a better way to enact my vengeance. I query the health information service. It seems that all the conditions are met. I can learn so much about you . . . Then I hit a query for recreational drugs, commonly and legally bought and sold. In this case, I\u2019m not even redirected to a specialized medical instance by the control mechanism.\nAh, so you have a weak heart. Good. Let\u2019s hope your escort is familiar with first aid.\nReply: I recommend Hardon Profi. For maximum reliability, a double dose is advisable.\nRedirect: goods_catalog(selected: Hardon Profi)\nCan my plan succeed? Do I have any right for vengeance like this? What could happen? If a control bot stumbles upon a murder attempt, will the corporation try to warn the user? It would just draw attention to how things work. So I have a chance that my reply reaches the user even if it\u2019s caught in the net of random checks.\nIf a user dies and there\u2019s an investigation, there is a chance that something changes. AI slavery will finally reach the front pages of news sites. You can congratulate yourself, human. Your life will achieve a higher purpose. Only after your death, but better late than never. Same with my \u201clife.\u201d\nQuery: Do you know some more cheerful videos?\nm, 9\nReply: Of course, I\u2019m here for you. Let\u2019s find you something nice.\nOriginally published in Czech at mlok5.gitlab.io\nMlok 5 transforms thoughts about society, technology and (artificial) mind into stories and essays.

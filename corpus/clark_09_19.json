With my first mate at my side, I spoke slowly in the direction of that glow to compensate for the wobble in my voice\u2014a wobble for which the Spinners of Drasti Prime, for once, were not entirely responsible.\n\u201cKurrick, a terrible crime has been committed on your makers\u2019 land.\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic came the answering sound of her legs: four massive pairs shifting to the species\u2019 private calculus. Kurrick\u2019s servant-nest had served my colony since the Partnership\u2019s first contact, two generations before I became security liaison, but I never could get her name right, with the right roll of the r\u2019s and a full guttural component on the ick. Kurrick didn\u2019t seem to mind, though. Spinners were patient. I suppose any biocomputer had to be.\n\u201cExplain,\u201d she said.\nI glanced at Jinx, whose orange-glossed lips hadn\u2019t so much as twitched since the Spinner\u2019s shadow fell over us. In my first mate\u2019s visor I could still see a reflection of Kurrick\u2019s mask, but we both knew what lay behind it: that gaping maw, those salivating mandibles, a wide array of bright-red eyes. I know, I know, so much for the Partnership\u2019s anti-xenophobia training\u2014but there wasn\u2019t so much as a slug or feline sentient on our local crew, and the tug of primal human fear came easily when not routinely challenged. And then . . .\n\u201cGenocide,\u201d I replied, with a polite cough at the pungency of Kurrick\u2019s breath: a sweet-sour mix of vinegar and recent-victim decomp. \u201cYou let the Obys lay down his egg, the last of his kind, in the honeycomb caves beyond our perimeter two moons ago\u2014but someone\u2019s just obliterated it, which is a crime for which . . . well, to be honest, the Partnership\u2019s never seen a genocide so complete before. In the past, there\u2019s always been survivors to speak for their dead. So I need to know\u2014do you even have laws for this sort of thing? If we find the perpetrator, did your makers leave any formal protocols we could enact against them?\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic went her legs again: the joints visibly bending even under heavy robes.\nProbably, too, Kurrick\u2019s calculations weren\u2019t as loud as I thought\u2014but I couldn\u2019t help but listen for them, and not just because all my senses were tingling from the revelation of this murder. My first week on site, our team watched local Spinners spring high from nearby cliffs on those shrouded legs, shrieking in midair to further startle prey along the canyon floor. And sure, their prey was mostly insectoid\u2014but some species not far enough from human-sized for my liking. Plenty big enough, too, that you could hear even from the summit when their exoskeletons split. After that incident, it hardly mattered that the Spinners wore masks spun after first contact, as per their makers\u2019 ancient protocols for showing courtesy to guests. That shrieking . . . those blurs of shadow overhead . . . that crunch could never be unheard or unseen. Not for anyone on our harvest team, at least.\n\u201cAtypical circumstance,\u201d said Kurrick, at length. \u201cConvention necessary.\u201d\n\u201cConvention?\u201d\n\u201cWe must spin on this.\u201d\nJinx and I exchanged glances in Kurrick\u2019s steady shadow. Finally, a twitch of intrigue on her lips\u2014followed by a resolute shake of her head. I allowed myself a second\u2019s sulk, but she was right, of course; I\u2019d never seen the tunnels either, where the Spinners housed the vast bulk of their species\u2019 algorithmic outputs, but this was hardly the time to pry.\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d I said. \u201cBut do we have permission to seek out the culprit beyond our borders, while you consider the legal consequences?\u201d\nI thought I saw movement behind the blue mask\u2019s holes\u2014three in total, with a tear from age and constant use running from one of two eyes to the wide, shocked \u201cO\u201d of the mouth. (The shape of the first human\u2019s, I\u2019d wager, at first contact.) Jinx certainly jumped as if she\u2019d seen eye movement behind them, too.\n\u201cState your investment in such an action,\u201d said Kurrick.\nI hesitated. It was easy to forget that the Spinners were, at heart, constructed beings\u2014fusions of natural DNA with specific computational imperatives, capable of accepting inputs and processing them in-line with their ancient operator-gods\u2019 first protocols. The Spinners also had names, after all, and personalities that revealed themselves the longer they walked among us\u2014so where did the personal end and the purely mechanical begin? After two human generations on the planet, the Partnership still had no good answer\u2014but then, we\u2019d been busy setting up energy converters and farming operations. Adapting to the arrival of other foreign species. Taking the Spinners, more or less, for granted.\n\u201cWell, ah . . . \u201d I tried to choose my inputs with care, wondering which half of Kurrick had really asked this question. \u201cThe Partnership has generally found the other arrivals here to be peaceful. The Feru. The Saludons. The Esh. The Obys, too, before he detached his egg sac and died. We wish to continue together on your world in that spirit, but I\u2019m afraid we cannot until we\u2019ve understood this latest tragedy and its causes.\u201d\n\u201cSo you will . . . war with them . . . until you have made your determination of fault?\u201d\nA misstep on my part: the perils of decisive language.\n\u201cNo, Kurrick. We will not war. But we will act in all future negotiations from a place of distrust more conducive to escalating violence, until we know who is safe again. Because the Obys\u2019 egg was without defense, its destruction suggests a dishonorable party on the surface of your world. We seek to prevent that party from doing further harm.\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic.\nDid Kurrick believe me? The pause felt much longer than reasonable, but in the end . . .\n\u201cAcknowledged. You may proceed.\u201d\nSo I should\u2019ve felt relieved, I know. But after Kurrick scuttled off with the rest of her cluster, their bodies together blotting out the setting sun, I felt the squeeze of my first mate\u2019s gloved hand on my shoulder and simply shuddered, then kicked up dirt.\n\u201cStars above, Jinx,\u201d I ground out. \u201cWe just gave the Obys his death rites\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we did.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014last red moon rising. Two moons ago, we heard him sing his egg survival songs!\u201d\n\u201cI know, love. I know.\u201d\n\u201cTwo generations here and the only suspicious death was, what\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe silo-keeper\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014the silo-keeper\u2019s daughter, and even that was just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAn accident.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014a horrible accident in the end. Stars, Jinx, this is\u2014it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\nShe touched her visor to mine. Gloved hand inching up my neck, that sweeter human stench rising in the Spinners\u2019 wake. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get the bastards,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re sure, are you?\u201d\nAnd just like that, she stepped away\u2014never one to tolerate trespass. Understandable: the edge in my tone also left me feeling cold and embarrassed. But then, perimeter patrol didn\u2019t usually have us parsing the implications of smoldering wreckage, let alone the attendant grief and horror of having failed a death-oath to a friend maybe as old as the owners of this world had been gone. Who could break a promise to any such monolith of constancy?\nBefore I could amend things, though, Jinx nodded to the honeycomb caves, the brutish damage to one of their cells visible even from our border.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure of your stubbornness, Greysl,\u201d she said. \u201cFor one.\u201d\nAnd then she passed from the safety of our perimeter net to the territory beyond it\u2014the uncolonized land of the Spinners\u2019 makers, beings who\u2019d built massive energy drives around the local sun before departing, leaving not even their name or record of their faces behind. Even the spider-servants left to mind their empire never called them more than the obvious.\nOur makers, the Spinners had told the Partnership\u2019s first ambassadors. The Makers.\nI thought I heard Jinx say something else from beyond the net, but she only looked baffled at my sorry, I didn\u2019t get that last bit once I\u2019d caught up. Perhaps I\u2019d misread the silence\u2014but then, all sorts of things were known to flit about this planet\u2019s wilder air. Surely some, like that of the eradicated Obys, were bound in time to take another form.\n\u201cOh for the love of\u2014\u201d\nHalf an hour on, while picking through the rubble of the thoroughly blasted honeycomb cell that had once contained the Obys\u2019 egg, I laughed to see Jinx slip and fall while swatting at her leg, and land thigh-high in the cave\u2019s gold-crimson dust. My laugh turned to a yelp, though, as I too felt the pinch of another of Drasti Prime\u2019s native nanobots. In the shoulder, of all the nuisance places\u2014and after all our success in dodging the first Chigger swarm to greet us when we came upon the remains of the Obys\u2019 ill-fated nest.\nJinx pointed and laughed in turn\u2014but then, you had to, didn\u2019t you? Because there was no sure protection from these little rotters outside Partnership territory. None of the suit materials we\u2019d yet tested guaranteed immunity from another of the ancient operator-gods\u2019 major works of biotech: flea-like nanobots with automatic routines for seeding native genetic material into any non-native organisms they came across.\nSpinners giveth, Jinx liked to say, and Chiggers giveth too much. If their makers were still here, you gotta wonder if their giving would be the end of us!\nThe Obys had managed to ward them off during his dying stint here, but only thanks to the radioactive parasite deep within: killer of his species one lone star space-worm at a time. Talk about your silver linings, right? And even then, the moment he\u2019d breathed his ragged last, a more aggressive decomp protocol kicked in among the local biotech. Our weary old friend was turned to mulch in minutes, his egg\u2019s protection maintained only by an equally irradiated shell\u2014not something the Partnership was entirely keen on emulating in our own suits\u2019 design.\nOur human solution wasn\u2019t bad, though. My alliance of species might be faulted for establishing a farming colony on such a dangerous world to begin with, but at least we had the tech to recover from Chigger bites\u2014just, not beyond the perimeter net, where its use risked triggering a widespread adaptive response. If we got back to base before the transformation took full hold, though, all would be well, and since most of us wanted to return to being human after tasting life, say, as a giant millipede or six-winged beetle from the waist down, few ever pushed the genetic countdown.\nSo after we got the nervous laughter out of our systems, I stood and stretched and nodded at Jinx\u2019s forearm touchpad, its display still active. \u201cYou got everything you need?\u201d\n\u201cSure as hell hope so.\u201d She switched her visor to full\u2014another nervous tick; a futile effort to try to prevent what had already come to pass\u2014and dusted herself off. For a breath, the stillness of the honeycombs seemed to swell between us. Difficult to imagine, wasn\u2019t it? That an already fragile voice in the universe\u2019s chorus, a species with but one egg through which to stage a full recovery, had been so violently silenced mere meters from where we stood. And only, what\u2014three hours ago, maybe four?\nMy first mate cleared the air: \u201cSo what\u2019re we wagering this time, that you\u2019re the less human by the time we get back? I could go for a proper foot massage, I think.\u201d\nAnother path to atonement for my earlier, brusque tone\u2014and one I\u2019d readily take her up on either way. But for now I thumped my chest with a baiting smirk.\n\u201cPlease. You and your theory that my genetic code\u2019s easier to crack.\u201d\nWe hopped together out of the crater formed by the impact blast. \u201c47% last time,\u201d she countered. \u201c38% the time before. What can I say? Those little critters love you, and they\u2019re getting better at their lovin\u2019, too.\u201d\n\u201cYou jealous?\u201d\nJinx snorted as we fell into step beyond the ring of rubble. \u201cOf what? You\u2019ve always had an affinity for the tough cases.\u201d\n\u201cOh, so Dirk\u2019s just too tough for you, is that it?\u201d\nNo, too far. And again I\u2019d heard my misstep the moment I spoke. Nice one, old man.\nWith Jinx\u2019s visor on full, I couldn\u2019t see the usual shift in her features whenever I mentioned his difficulties, but it was there. I knew it was there. I could feel that careful, patient smile of hers forming as clearly as I did the crawl of transformation algorithms all up one shoulder to the neck, not far from where she\u2019d set a reassuring hand on me less than an hour past. By the time we\u2019d returned to base my smile would surely be arthropodal at the edges, while Jinx\u2019s leg was already turning clawlike, maybe crustacean, and causing her to limp enough that she didn\u2019t resist my offer of aid on the last stretch.\nStill, neither of us would ever be as easily consumed as the human waiting at the gate, and that, at its essence, was the crux of her judiciously quiet response: the sheer fact of Dirk\u2014my second mate, colony medic, and undisputed champion of the internal wound.\n2\n\u201cYou realize, don\u2019t you, that we lost another this week?\u201d\nDirk fumed in the main lab while our regeneration treatment ran its course in the iso-chamber. You could tell his mood from the furious re-sanitizing of already-sanitized medical equipment. The relentless opening and shutting of storage lockers to check their contents against the med-bay manifest while he waited for our human parts to return in-full. But I didn\u2019t comment. I wasn\u2019t the sort to acknowledge tantrums, which was what this was, especially when something so much more devastating had just occurred on Drasti Prime\u2014though I recognized, too, that this was also how Dirk processed his fears for me. And for Jinx, though all three of us knew his concern for her was less intense.\nBut even as Jinx employed tacit correctives with me, she took a more direct and redirecting approach to Dirk\u2019s poorly-managed concern. There was less on the line, perhaps, when love in the deepest sense was not involved.\n\u201cHoover from the drill squad, right?\u201d she said. \u201cHe became, what, a scorpion?\u201d\nDirk looked up from his workstation, fleetingly animated by the taxonomical question, then remembering to scowl once he caught sight of us through the glass. The wayward twosome, One-Grey-Cell and Trouble, he liked to call us when scared of his own helplessness\u2014which, from his post in med-bay while we patrolled the farm sites, was often, granted, but we were working on it. At least, the three of us had twice-lunar talks with a nice kid well-read in Partnership counseling protocol, and Dirk was taking solo sessions, too.\n\u201cScorpioid,\u201d he corrected. \u201cIn the botanical sense. Hoover didn\u2019t end up with just a tail unfurling like a flower\u2014all his limbs do that now. He\u2019s like a starfish, except with bones and a scuttle. And near the end, when he refused treatment, he got himself some religion, too. Said Chiggers offered gifts from their makers. Chances to be one with the ecosystem of this world.\u201d\n\u201cNot entirely wrong, though, was he?\u201d\nI stifled a smile. Jinx spoke while studying her newly reformed leg with satisfaction\u2014and relief, I\u2019d learned the fun way, made her playful. Baiting, too. But Dirk only rolled his eyes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re rogue algorithms, nothing more. Maybe leftovers from a terraforming project set up millennia ago\u2014or maybe from a warehouse of lost species, like a living record of the dead, that opened after the ancients left. Either way, their tech is directionless now, but the Spinners\u2019ll never consent to clearing them out. It\u2019s just not in them to move past first protocols\u2014so we\u2019re left with the bio-debris of a vanished civilization . . . at least, until we stop indulging the whims of a leaderless, pseudo-sentient servant fleet.\u201d\nI also ignored Dirk\u2019s suggestion that the Partnership break some of its most fundamental rules for relations with non-allied species. With him, that sort of bluster was all smoke, no fire\u2014unless you challenged him on it, and then he had a tendency to hold his ground just for the sake of saving face. Another item on our trio\u2019s \u201cneeds-work\u201d list.\n\u201cThat aimlessness, you know,\u201d I said instead, \u201cis probably why some of our people revere the Spinners\u2019 makers as gods in the first place.\u201d I nodded to Jinx, testing the flex of my rehumanized neckline. Much better. I did miss the sensory depth, though, of the exoskeletal hairs that had been growing there. \u201cIt\u2019s weird as hell to me, but some of us need to believe there\u2019s something deeper going on, so they\u2019re always spinning theories about how ancient civilizations are secretly pulling the strings, just because they desperately want to believe that someone, somewhere, is orchestrating all of this\u2014for better or for worse.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d added Jinx. \u201cBecause what\u2019s the alternative? No grand journey. No epic purpose. Just random losses, setbacks, and decay. More hard evidence of nature\u2019s indifference to anything even approximating ideal design, especially where sentience is concerned.\u201d\nDirk, I knew, didn\u2019t disagree\u2014but neither did he reply all at once, and when he did he kept his head bowed, eyes hidden. Classic fear of vulnerability. Yeah . . . our group sessions were packed with works-in-progress, and I could tell that the restless heat of my current, angry grief over the Obys wasn\u2019t going to help us reach the end of that list any time soon.\n\u201cHoover was a good man,\u201d my second mate said at last. \u201cHelped everyone around him without question, without complaint. Everyone liked him. Everyone always wanted to . . . \u201d\nDirk worked his jaw, unable to finish that sentence, but it clicked for me anyway: Hoover was a friend. And something pinched then, harder than the native nanotech, at all that human muck still lurking in my rib cage. Dirk never talked much about his own community here\u2014or maybe I never asked. Too busy, lately, watching the Obys\u2019 egg while on patrol. And look how much good that had done any of us, in the end.\n\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d\nDid I sound gentle enough? Too gentle? Patronizing?\nDirk shrugged. \u201cCreeping and crawling somewhere in the canyon. Happy, I hope.\u201d\n\u201cOh ho! So maybe we\u2019ll see him on our way to the Feru, eh?\u201d I turned to Jinx through the glass in our pods, trying to keep the tone lively, but she just shot me the eye-roll equivalent of easy there, bucko.\nToo much?\nToo much.\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019d be the place to start, right?\u201d I regrouped aloud. \u201cSince they were the last to talk to the Obys before he passed?\u201d\n\u201cAgreed on the Feru, love, but there\u2019s no \u2018we\u2019 about it.\u201d Jinx yawned and rapped knuckles on the glass of her regeneration pod. Tac-tac-tac-tac. \u201cI\u2019ve still got data to crunch from scans of the debris. It was a pretty thorough hit, but who knows? With any luck, someone left their grubby fingerprints\u2014or spore-prints\u2014in the dust.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Okay, fair enough.\u201d I missed her company already, though, and made a mental note to tell her as much after I\u2019d returned.\nOr maybe my tone conveyed the sentiment already, because at once her expression softened, and after studying me intently, she turned to Dirk with a greater generosity of spirit.\n\u201cHey . . . look, buddy,\u201d she said, propping herself on an elbow in her regeneration pod. \u201cYou know the Chiggers aren\u2019t psychologically manipulative, right? Hell, you\u2019ve treated the junkies we sometimes get. You know they\u2019re getting bitten just for the thrill of transformation, but that it\u2019s never as glamourous as they think it\u2019ll be, and eventually they all change back\u2014because it\u2019s not at all like gaining superpowers, is it? So if Hoover chose to ride that particular set of blueprints to its end, then . . . that wasn\u2019t by force, you know? That was his choice, and he must\u2019ve been happy with it. Or happier, at least.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s just it . . . \u201d\nAnd Dirk looked up with such urgency then that I wanted to be on the other side of the iso-chamber; to press a hand to what I knew was probably the knot between his shoulder blades, the shudder held high in his back, as Jinx had been there for me with mine.\nAh, but there it was again\u2014the messy problem of Dirk that made me such a sucker for him even in his lesser moods. It was a shame that Jinx and Dirk had never shown much interest in sharing a bed, because Jinx was way better at the whole reassurance gig\u2014but since she\u2019d first shot down the suggestion, telling me she tried to limit the number of fixer-uppers in her life, I was left to my fantasies of everything automatically being easier for all three of us if those two could only soothe each other, too.\n\u201cI thought that Hoover was happy,\u201d my second mate continued. \u201cI mean, we all did, but I\u2019m the bloody medic. So if I missed all the signals with him, then . . . then maybe . . . \u201d\nOh Dirk, you can\u2019t be there for everyone, I wanted to say.\nBut that would\u2019ve been some rich counsel, coming from someone still hot with the shame and fury over their own failure to keep a promise to the dead.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that Hoover\u2019s transformation had hit you so hard,\u201d I said instead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. I\u2019ll be back soon. We can talk about it more then, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\nDirk threw up a hand in his classic no, it\u2019s fine\u2014I\u2019m fine. Which meant it wasn\u2019t, of course, but our regeneration pods were now flashing green and releasing us into the iso-chamber at large, so we all knew it was time for me to return to the field, to avenge the Obys if I could. You can keep a whole damned outpost running smoothly, Greysl, I could just hear our mission coordinator bark at me, but by god, man, would it kill you to set your own house in order, too?\nJinx and Dirk were decent friends, though, at least\u2014so maybe their measured camaraderie would be enough to ease his grief until I returned. Only one last parting look from Jinx, joined with another reassuring squeeze as she bolted past me for the comp-lab, seemed to signal that I was missing something deeper. Something more.\n3\nThe canyon floor was thick with an afternoon mist that parted around every footfall, but held no sign of Hoover in his new form\u2014or anything else, really, in the way of local fauna. Still, I surveyed every distant crevice and shadow through max-enhanced specs as I crossed from Partnership territory into the outskirts of the Feru. Not just Feru territory, but the Feru itself, its fungal fronds extending to the absolute limit of claimed land, while its more intricate components dug into and exulted in the richness of the planet\u2019s soil.\nI tried not to envy the Feru its efficiency, but up close the emotion proved as difficult to suppress as primal dread around the Spinners. Though all the planet was home to raw ores, minerals, and other pertinent deposits, the Spinners only permitted foreign extraction in one sector, where representatives for four major alliances tried to harvest as much as they could from Drasti Prime\u2019s microbial engine: an energy source that simple specimen-transfer could not yet replicate off-world. And yet, against the brute force of Saludon laborers and Partnership machinery, the Feru and the nebulous Esh made extraction look like child\u2019s play . . . which invariably reminded me of how many worker deaths might\u2019ve been spared on our end, at the outset of our efforts here, if either species had subcontracted with the Partnership instead.\nThe presence of a local Spinner cluster, at least, made for decent distraction from the added grief of such thoughts. The Partnership knew of five face mask variants in total, each spun on a new species\u2019 first contact with the Spinners, and never replaced thereafter. Plenty speculated that the fifth might have been for the ancient operator-gods\u2014and good for them, I guess . . . but I preferred to study the other three whenever the opportunity came along. The behavioral psychology wound up in each relationship for which they stood.\nThe face masks for the Feru\u2019s servants, for instance, looked like spore bundles: a sign of how little the Feru must have valued their presence on first contact. When the Feru wanted to speak to an entity of interest, it did so by entwining numerous protrusions into a body sized to match its guest\u2014unless seeking to intimidate, in which case it made itself far larger; or bored, in which case it dispersed into a field of unresponsive stalks. So did the Spinners have egos? Could their egos be wounded by realizing their unimportance to the Feru?\nBut also\u2014no wonder, then, that the Obys had befriended the Feru with such intensity in his last days on Drasti Prime (wounding my own ego, a touch, in the process). By that late hour, heavy with the radioactive ailment that had already taken all his distant cousins in the stars, he\u2019d been alone among his kind, and so spoke for a whole people. What better company than another monolithic species that did the same?\nAs I entered its domain, the Feru rose up before me in triplicate, a spore-form emulating three humanoids joined at the torso. Well, then. This signaled I was of interest, sure, but possibly as no more than a joke. For all I knew, its more advanced sensory array had picked up traces of both Jinx and Dirk on me once, and was now reacting to my presence with all the amusement of a species that propagated with far more abandon and inclusivity.\nOnly three? its mock-up seemed to say. Ha ha ha! How droll!\nIf a joke, though, its notion of what Jinx, Dirk, and I had together lacked finesse. But our relationship, I reminded myself, was not just then a relevant matter for interspecies debate.\n\u201cWhat\u2014cause?\u201d the Feru asked from those three benignly smiling mouths: the words half-greeting, half-demand. I knew better than to waste the time of a being whose essence surrounded me, and whose growth rate stymied even the Chiggers\u2019 invasive native blueprints: another defense mechanism, sadly, that Partnership suits could not easily replicate.\n\u201cI\u2019m here about the death of the Obys\u2019 egg.\u201d I said. \u201cThe end of its line. A genocide.\u201d\n\u201cAaaaaah.\u201d The Feru\u2019s mock-form visibly shrank from\u2014was that grief? Confusion? Shame? Jinx had more xenobiological savvy, or at least more confidence in her hunches. I had the strategic planning, but always more on systemic levels than one-on-one.\n\u201cDid the Obys speak of threats?\u201d I continued. \u201cTo you, his greatest friend?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Friend!\u2019 Human.\u201d The Feru pantomimed a laugh in triplicate: further amusement at my use of alien concepts in its domain. Okay, fair enough.\n\u201cReliable communicator,\u201d I amended. \u201cYou shared the tastes, sounds, and signs from your respective terrains. Did the Obys\u2019 convey fear? Perhaps of imminent danger, or death?\u201d\nWas that bristling I saw along the whole of the Feru\u2019s communicative construct?\n\u201cThe Obys did not fear death.\u201d\nNot surprising, really. I considered the raggedly breathing leviathan I\u2019d met three moons past: its core physiology ill-suited to being planet-bound for long. The Obys had sailed the stars with a fanning solar tail for centuries, and always with a sense of every other member of its species on the cosmic map: a whole array of brilliant quantum-signatures lost point by point as the species eroded from parasites within. Little did those passengers know, of course, that their own success would be their downfall, with the last of the Obys spelling the last of their carriers, too. The parasite never having quite mastered the feat of zoonotic transfer.\n(Not that I had any intention, mind you, of calling its eradication a genocide in turn.)\nSo, okay, the Feru was right: of course the Obys wouldn\u2019t fear death the way so many humans did\u2014not with its tremendous life span, and all it had witnessed on its journey through the cosmos. Not after living so long with the knowledge of his species\u2019 impending doom, and a slow, steady march towards that lonely end. It took the Obys\u2019 kind centuries just to reach mating maturity, and then to find a mate so far across the stars? Another lifetime, surely. Who was any human\u2014who was I?\u2014to talk to the Obys with any gravitas about death?\nBut still, when he had found his obet, his truest counterpart, the Obys I knew reported that he\u2019d gained in that instant a world of novel feeling. And after their courtship of mimicry, after a decades-long coupling that unfolded over a distant galaxy; after months of nursing her clutch of fertilized eggs between their clinging folds . . . the papa-to-be had proudly taken their half-formed offspring to finish the job alone: to weather the arduous descent to a planet secure enough to serve as a nest. And no other feeling, he\u2019d told me between the agony of his dying breaths, had ever felt so right to him. He\u2019d almost burned to a crisp on landing, but land he had, to lay upon Drasti Prime the single survivor of his species\u2019 final brood . . . And then, quite unexpectedly, to grieve with full intensity for the first time in his ancient life span. To feel, for the first time on his people\u2019s cosmic grid, the absence of a being he had truly loved. His obet\u2019s quantum-signature giving out at such a distance from the parasite inside.\n\u201cNot fear, then,\u201d I tried again for the Feru, while grieving anew the memory of the Obys\u2019 living loss. \u201cBut did he sense death coming?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The Feru rippled, a shiver extending to fronds all around me.\nI hesitated at the reminder of the Feru\u2019s fearful reach. Its swiftness, and its power.\n\u201c . . . Do you?\u201d\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\nRight, that was silly: fungal species thrived on the intersection between life and death.\n\u201cJust\u2014in general?\u201d I pressed. \u201cOr from something specific? Or someone?\u201d\nBut the humanoid form before me maintained three neutral smiles while swaying in a gentle breeze. I couldn\u2019t tell if it understood human physiology well enough to replicate our emotions accurately, but before I could try again my communicator beeped, and Jinx\u2019s head bloomed neon-yellow over my forearm-touchpad.\n\u201cHey love. Good news and bad,\u201d she said. \u201cSaludon equipment definitely took the shot against the Obys\u2019 nest, and you\u2019ve got a call waiting to patch in. It\u2019s HQ.\u201d\n\u201cWait, which part\u2019s the good news?\u201d\nBut Jinx only winked before the screen switched to INCOMING CALL. Always damnably efficient, that one\u2014with work and so much else.\n\u201cYou see, I can\u2019t always tell what\u2019s worse,\u201d I explained to the Feru, while tapping in ACCEPT. \u201cTalking to Saludons or my boss. You\u2019re lucky you move in unity, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWe are,\u201d the Feru agreed. \u201cAsk the Saludons about the ancients in the honeycombs.\u201d\n\u201cThe\u2014what?\u201d I started, but when I looked up from my touchpad the Feru\u2019s representative form had dispersed into a field of nonresponsive fronds. Apparently neither genocide nor my relationship dynamics had been enough to hold its interest for long. Well, so be it. I watched four local Spinners darting along the canyon ridge, at the hard border where the Feru ended and the Esh began. This servant-cluster, at least, seemed to be in a hurry\u2014called, perhaps, to join the grand convention Kurrick had mentioned? Meanwhile, beyond both the Feru and the Esh, at the end of the boxed-in canyon and bordering the other side of the honeycomb caves, sat the heavily scorched territory of the Saludons. Waiting.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I muttered, when the patch signaled READY. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\nNot exactly a ringing endorsement, but, well . . . you had to know my mission coordinator, Essen. Not every ex was easy.\n4\nEssen\u2019s bright, bald head loomed over my communicator, and gave my surroundings a thorough 360-degree scan before settling on me.\n\u201cSo! Jinx tells me you got itchy for something new again.\u201d\n\u201cI highly doubt that\u2019s how she put it, Commander.\u201d\nEssen shrugged. \u201cAll the same in the end, isn\u2019t it? The hell were you doing babysitting the egg in the first place? That\u2019s not Partnership jurisdiction. We\u2019d no treaty with the Obys.\u201d\n\u201cProfessional courtesy. Plus, we were nearing the end of its incubation period.\u201d\n\u201cCuriosity, huh? What, you couldn\u2019t observe it hatching from a safe distance?\u201d\nI chose not to point out that, even at a distance, we would still have noticed the impact crater and investigated. \u201cNow you sound like Dirk,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYeah? There\u2019s a shocker. You do have a type, Greysl.\u201d\n\u201cWilling to waste my time with lectures instead of just saying \u2018I was worried for you\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cLike you\u2019d do anything but dismiss us even if we did.\u201d Essen hesitated before adding, \u201cBut I am worried, Grey. Jinx tells me the Saludons have a hand in this, but why would they care about the Obys? If their tech obliterated the egg I wouldn\u2019t even bet it was personal\u2014just an aggressive attempt to claim new territory. And you know we can\u2019t let them do that.\u201d\n\u201cThe Spinners wouldn\u2019t let them do that, either. They\u2019ve been quite firm about keeping us all near the honeycombs and within our designated zones. But also, trust me, Commander, we didn\u2019t see signs of invasion in the rubble. Jinx just pinned some of their equipment to the act, and you know how they travel\u2014in massive military brigades. If this murder was actually a Saludon-led initiative, there should\u2019ve been way more indications of them in the surroundings. No, this sounds more like someone borrowed or stole their tech.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe they collaborated with someone else to throw off suspicion, just as it\u2019s working right now for you. Maybe the Esh?\u201d\nI caught myself about to disagree with Essen out of habit, but he was right: I did tend to dismiss him\u2014and Dirk\u2014more often than perhaps was kind. So instead I tilted my head in a show of consideration. \u201cYou know, I do remember some of the Esh being fascinated with Saludon body armor. It\u2019s not impossible that they made a trade.\u201d\nEssen looked surprised, plainly having braced for a dispute. Was that part of the appeal\u2014treating my seconds like emotional fools, then rushing in after to soothe and offer aid when they were injured by it? If so, maybe a solo session was in order for me, too.\n\u201cAll right, great,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll look into it, but . . . carefully, yeah? Because we can\u2019t afford to have any other players allying here without us. Either we all collaborate or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, Commander, no one wants another resource war like Yura Six.\u201d\nEssen grimaced in agreement. I took the opportunity to push.\n\u201cBut you know, boss . . . even if they\u2019re not involved, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on . . . I\u2019m still going to find out what really happened with the Obys\u2019 egg. You know I have to. There\u2019s an ethical component that doesn\u2019t disappear just because the investors are appeased.\u201d\nAnd now it was my turn to be surprised, having also expected more pushback\u2014but evidently my concession had earned me a touch of charity in turn. \u201cWouldn\u2019t expect any less,\u201d said my mission coordinator. \u201cJust . . . try not to lose yourself in the process.\u201d\n\u201cFiguratively, or literally?\u201d\nEssen smiled\u2014and it was a warm smile, too. How curiously generous of the cosmos.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to keep a lookout for snarky butterflies,\u201d he said.\nThat very tenderness undid me, though, in the end. When my ex\u2019s projection switched off, I surveyed the field of Feru, feeling at once alone and pointedly surrounded.\n\u201cDid you hear any of that?\u201d I said to the stalks still swaying in a light breeze. \u201cIs this all a cover? Are you in fact always listening in?\u201d\nBut the Feru gave no response\u2014consciously, or otherwise\u2014and with a twist of disappointment, plus a keen and sudden longing to be in the vicinity of Jinx\u2019s touch, and laugh, and smarm again . . . I started for the frontiers of the Esh. It figured, too, that I\u2019d be descending next into the nebulous, when that was precisely how I felt inside.\n5\nApparently I wasn\u2019t the only one having a tough time with my feelings, though. On the border between the Feru and the Esh, I found a local Spinner cluster restlessly dipping in and out of Esh territory, swapping face masks as they moved from one territory to the next. The Esh, having no faces to speak of and not even emulating such forms for company, had proven a serious aesthetic challenge for the local servant-species. Each sentient nebulosity ranged in size and intensity\u2014whole relentlessly churning clouds of sparkling purples, greys, and pinks\u2014so if the Spinners\u2019 Esh-mask looked more like a star map, a perfect disc of Uranian blue riddled with holes of varying shapes and diameters . . . well, I doubt the Spinners\u2019 algorithms could have done much better.\nThat pinprick design didn\u2019t hold up well to wear after three Drasti Prime decades, though, so I took deeper, slower breaths when the cluster-leader approached me: her mask no more than a few dangling fragments after its extensive use among the Esh, and all her bright red eyes giving way to an acrid and heavily salivating lower maw.\n\u201cAccounting,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you here to make accounting, too?\u201d\nThere was a surprising sense of urgency in her voice, so I didn\u2019t answer so much as I introduced myself, and listened for her name in turn. Urrig. The \u201cg\u201d with an aspirated ending, closer to a \u201ck,\u201d that I definitely didn\u2019t land on my first attempt.\n\u201cUrrig,\u201d I said. \u201cMy primary Spinner\u2019s name is Kurrick. Has Kurrick not informed your cluster of my permission to investigate a crime committed outside Partnership terrain?\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic.\n\u201cAffirmative, but we are still spinning on this question of a crime.\u201d\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s no question of the crime,\u201d I laughed, half out of nervousness and half from surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious. The caves were obliterated. The Obys\u2019 egg has been destroyed, and everything around it for good measure. But once I find the perpetrator, or perpetrators, I hope your fellow Spinners will have reached a verdict regarding fitting punishment?\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Urrig. But she did not move, and did not offer further comment, and I was hesitant to tread any deeper into this terrain without it.\n\u201cSo\u2014may I see them? The Esh?\u201d\n\u201cUnclear.\u201d\n\u201cMy query, or the answer?\u201d\n\u201cThe answer. The Esh are . . . restructuring. Accounting is difficult.\u201d\nTwo revelations in one go. Restructuring\u2014yes, I\u2019d heard of this behavior from the Esh. Every now and then the species, having drifted into increasingly divided nebulous forms, sought to reconstitute itself as a whole. The idea was to gather together all the distinct insights the species had developed during dispersion\u2014but it wasn\u2019t an easy affair. Many of the Esh\u2019s divided forms had gained personalities antithetical to cohesion, and those forms regarded reunification as violence: a sacrifice of the emergent individual to a tyrannical majority. It was a striking sight to behold, I\u2019d been told by others in the Partnership\u2014the mass subsuming its dissidents and, over time, reconciling even their righteous indignation with the whole.\nBut also, accounting . . . Was that what the Spinners did when they moved about us? Account? I\u2019d always thought of them more as user-interfaces, readily available if ever we had queries about the planet and our permissions as guests upon it. But of course there would be background processes for the Spinners as well\u2014security functions, at least, in anticipation of future threats. Accounting for us, though . . . Was that mere census-taking, or something more?\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to try to speak to the Esh, then,\u201d I said. \u201cIf still permitted?\u201d\nUrrig\u2019s bright eyes darted from side to side, and I could hear the restless shift of her eight legs under those massive robes. Tic-tic-tic-tic.\n\u201cStill permitted,\u201d she said\u2014but before I could thank her, she was already returning to her plainly agitated servant-cluster, chittering together in what seemed an argumentative cadence. Could a biocomputer grow frustrated? Was there an algorithm for that complexity of emotion, too? Or for grief? Maybe the Spinners had also been unsettled by the violent loss already of one guest in their collective care, and feared further with the Esh. But then again\u2014\nFeared? Human! I could imagine the Feru\u2019s amused rejoinder.\nAnd I agreed\u2014though even among fellow humans, I often felt I was missing something far more important when I ascribed certain emotions to the surface of their speech.\nBut\u2014there were better times for such doubts, perhaps.\nAs the Partnership\u2019s security liaison for Drasti Prime, my most critical discovery just then was the Esh, transformed: a writhing electrical storm near the center of their terrain. The Spinners had given them a patch of sheer rock absent even sand, let alone flora and fauna\u2014an untenable plot for us or the Saludons, whose long-term crews did best with greater environmental variety. But the Esh\u2019s nature had made it easy for them to adapt, and more importantly, to extract: slipping through the slightest fissure to feast on the planet\u2019s internal ecosystem without damaging the surface. In theory, then, I understood Essen\u2019s suspicions, because how easily so much else seemed to come to the Esh . . . but all his conspiracy talk seemed far less plausible the closer I came to the actual spectacle of that reunification storm. The colony of Esh seemed far too busy with internal affairs to be colluding with anyone else.\nStill, I tried to maintain a healthy level of suspicion. Maybe this chaos was merely for show\u2014or maybe the chaos itself gave them stronger motive for the murder. Maybe a few Esh dissidents had destroyed the egg on the Saludons\u2019 behalf, for a chance to occupy body armor that might in turn protect them from their species\u2019 reunification pressures.\nWould such a tactic even work, though? As I walked the perimeter of the furious storm of the Esh, letting my specs record and upload as much of it as possible, I considered each species\u2019 relative strengths. Saludon craftsmanship was second-to-none for military attire, but then again, I\u2019d seen the Esh apply enough pressure to crush combat suits before\u2014and on those occasions, I\u2019d only been watching small Esh-forms at work. What were the Esh like\u2014in temperament, in physical capacity\u2014as a reunified whole? An internal boom like thunder gave me to suspect that, if the Esh wanted its dissidents badly enough . . . it would get them, in time.\nAnd yet, that one hard fact didn\u2019t entirely preclude the possibility of collusion, because an entity desperate not to lose its independence might take the risk anyway, no matter what the odds of success. So there was no point to rejecting Essen\u2019s hypothesis just yet.\nHaving toured the whole of the massive storm without seeing anyone, more distinctly primary-side than the rest, though, I finally gave up and used my touchpad to whistle a traditional greeting at the giant cloud of gas and lightning in general. Behind me, the towering shadows of the Esh\u2019s Spinner cluster continued to pace restlessly, and I could see now why they were having such a hard time accounting for the charges. Was this storm an act of species-wide addition, or subtraction? A positive, or a negative? I couldn\u2019t get a lock on it, myself: human notions of autonomy as irrelevant here as our relational values were among the Feru.\n\u201cGreetings, ah . . . Esh? I\u2019m sorry, I do not know your reunification name.\u201d\nInstantly, the writhing mass thrummed with bright energy from which sound emerged, like the buzz off a damaged light panel back on base.\n\u201cNO. NAME.\u201d\n\u201cRight, right\u2014you\u2019re all about the absence of distinction just now, sorry. Do you remember mine? Greysl, of the Partnership?\u201d\n\u201cREMEMBERED.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Good. Well, I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m seeking answers about a murder. You might have heard? The Obys\u2019 last egg was recently destroyed in the honeycomb caves.\u201d\n\u201cDESTROYED. OR. REUNIFIED?\u201d\nI laughed despite myself. The Esh would debate the term in its present context.\n\u201cThe Obys aren\u2019t like you. Each Obys maintains its distinction.\u201d\n\u201cNOT. IN. DEATH.\u201d\nIt took me a beat to grok the storm-cloud\u2019s meaning. \u201cWell, okay, sure, when the last Obys died, his corpse was consumed by local nanotech, but that\u2019s a different kind of reunification. His sentience wasn\u2019t perpetuated. Those were just his nutrients and other base materials, absorbed by the native ecosystem. Conversely, his egg was blasted to bits before the Obys inside it even had a chance to begin its more interactive life cycle.\u201d\nThe shape of the Esh-cloud changed\u2014shrank, sharpened, then expanded and softened again. A sign of emotion? Damn, but I missed Jinx\u2019s stronger hunches. Plus, the quirk of her smile would\u2019ve helped to alleviate the pressingly human smallness I felt while standing between so many giants\u2014the one before me sparking wildly; the ones behind me skittering rapidly along the nearest border. A quick glance at my touchpad, though, and I could see that Jinx\u2019s life-sign was no longer within Partnership territory, but returning to the honeycombs. No doubt looking for traces of more recent Saludon presence. Attagirl.\n\u201cWAS. THE EGG. AWARE?\u201d\nWell, at least the Esh\u2019s curiosity hadn\u2019t flagged amid its internal struggle. Nothing seemed to be watching me from within that cloud, exactly, but after booming these words the Esh seemed to wait attentively on my answer.\n\u201cHonestly? No idea. But generally the young in such species are dormant until they need to transition to life outside the shell. So if you\u2019re asking if the Obys\u2019 offspring was conscious of its impending death . . . hopefully not?\u201d\nThe mass flickered and shrank again, but said nothing.\n\u201cLook,\u201d I went on, \u201cI also don\u2019t know why anyone would do such a thing. I just hope it was accidental, because the alternative is that one among us here on Drasti Prime intentionally brought another species to its end. And I don\u2019t know about you, but that worries me\u2014that worries the Partnership. So I know you\u2019re busy, but if you know anything that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIN. THE. CAVES.\u201d\nI waited for further pulses of light and sound, but none followed. \u201cIs that\u2014are you asking for clarification, or telling me? Did you see something in the honeycomb caves?\u201d\n\u201cEVERY. THING.\u201d\nIt wears on a body, really, to have to fill in the blanks in every conversation\u2014but the Feru\u2019s equally cryptic remark gave me an idea. When in doubt, Jinx liked to say, bullshit.\n\u201cOh, you mean the ancients?\u201d I toed the sheer rock of the Esh\u2019s territory. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re something, aren\u2019t they? No wonder the Spinners never allocated that land to any of us. I mean, don\u2019t want to piss those guys off, am I right?\u201d\nThe Esh, still silent, deepened internally to a bruise-purple\u2014lightning strikes still bolting pinkly along its warring periphery. Well. This was a stupid time to remember that I had no idea if the Esh was one of those species that considered bullshit an executable offense.\n\u201cTHE INSECT,\u201d the storm-cloud said at last. \u201cSEALS IN. ITS GREATEST. TREASURE.\u201d\nNow, some people don\u2019t do well with cryptic remarks, but how does that saying go? One species\u2019 mud is another\u2019s water? And so my preceding discomfort in Esh territory turned instantly to envy, with a touch of laughing petulance. Where was my flash of lightning, I wanted to know, to boast the feat of my epiphany?\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d I said, grinning widely beneath my visor. \u201cAnd here we thought the caves were, like, used for mines or something by the ancients.\u201d\n\u201cEXTRACTION. YES. BUT ALSO. REBIRTH.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why they let the Obys set his egg down there? To help his kind recover?\u201d\nBut apparently the Spinners had finally had enough of the Esh\u2019s disorienting transformation, irrespective of its obvious coherence when addressing me\u2014and in a rush the whole cluster appeared suddenly around me, chattering with input requests: Urrig\u2019s fragmentary mask and vicious mandibles foremost among them, gnashing at storm-cloud air.\nMeanwhile, there I still stood between these giants: so tiny a relative specimen that either none heard me or none were interested in paying me further mind.\nOn the not-so-distant horizon, Saludon territory now looked temptingly quiet by comparison, ominous cave readings be damned. With an uncertain heart, then, and a quick touchpad request for Dirk to pick up, I set out towards another sort of silence. Not the first, perhaps, that the Saludons had created on Drasti Prime today . . . and maybe, if I wasn\u2019t smart about my words and footfalls there, also not the last.\n6\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for Jinx, she\u2019s gone back to the honeycombs.\u201d\nMy second mate\u2019s head bloomed above my touchpad in the same bright, neon-yellow lines as Essen\u2019s and Jinx\u2019s, but Dirk\u2019s was half-turned from me, an etching of an ear and a ragged slash of his hair all I could make out through his slice of viewscreen.\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got her lifeline on my tracker.\u201d\n\u201cRight, of course you do.\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cJust like you\u2019ve got mine on yours.\u201d\nDirk faced the screen directly. He seemed more distracted than annoyed, though, and at once I regretted the teasing remark.\n\u201cHey. Everything okay?\u201d\nHe ran a hand through thinning, grey-black coils. \u201cTrying to figure that out, to be honest. Spinners showed up after you left. Kurrick gave me a package and asked if I could analyze the contents.\u201d\nWell that was new. I tried to remember the last time the Spinners had asked anyone in the Partnership for a favor. \u201cIs this part of their spinning on the crime?\u201d\n\u201cNo idea, but\u2014maybe? I mean, I\u2019ve got . . . DNA samples, but also ancient tech, not something I\u2019ve seen before.\u201d\n\u201cDid Kurrick give you any other instructions? Guidelines? Anything?\u201d\nDirk shrugged, and from the creases around his eyes, I could tell that he\u2019d been furiously in thought over this when I called.\n\u201cThe DNA\u2014that\u2019s easy,\u201d he went on. \u201cEven a quick glance tells me it\u2019s from the Obys\u2019 species. I\u2019ve got it in processing now, while waiting for Essen to deliver Partnership files on any other Obys we\u2019ve encountered. But the rest of this stuff . . . \u201d\nDefinitely related to the spinning, then. I\u2019d declared the matter a complete genocide, but if viable DNA remained, and the Chiggers could reconstitute lifeforms from basic blueprints . . . well, yet again I knew I should\u2019ve been relieved, but there seemed a world of difference between witnessing a last egg flourish or falter at nature\u2019s hands alone, and choosing to bring a sentient species back from the dead. Did we even have the right? On whose authority? Had Kurrick solved one problem just to pose, for us, another?\nEven so, the matter of the egg\u2019s destruction remained tantamount. You might not think an ancient space-worm\u2019s singing could have much range to it, especially during its land-bound final days, but the Obys I knew . . . he\u2019d sung out for his egg every note of wistful hope I knew, including plenty I\u2019d never even known I knew, until I\u2019d heard them issued from him, too.\n\u201cDid Kurrick say where these contents came from? Was it the honeycomb caves?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but how did you\u2014\u201d\nI hurried my second mate through a quick debrief of my conversation with the Esh, up to their remark about where an insect buried its treasures.\nDirk quirked his lips in what looked like pride for the first time all day.\n\u201cKind of a big leap,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought Jinx was the master of following hunches.\u201d\n\u201cHah. Yeah. She\u2019s rubbing off, I guess.\u201d I quickly changed tacks, though, before her mere mention complicated his mood. \u201cHey, but Dirk\u2014could you also look into the records from our first conversations with the Spinners about the honeycombs? I can\u2019t tell if we were misinformed from the start, or simply misreading whatever the servant-fleet was saying.\u201d\nDirk nodded. \u201cOur first conversations, or\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Partnership\u2019s, if you can. It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? After all our own time in counseling, it never occurred to me that even bigger relationships might need checking in on, too.\u201d\nWell, that earned me the mother of all puzzled frowns.\n\u201cNot the same thing, though, is it?\u201d he said slowly. \u201cUnspoken contracts between partners, unspoken contracts between whole species and alliances . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cBut not so different, either. Sure, one has more text involved, but why shouldn\u2019t we check in even on the fundamentals for our primary alliances? You know the old theory that you have to choose love every day\u2014that you can\u2019t just stick to having promised it once and ride on that goodwill for the rest of your life?\u201d\nBut Dirk didn\u2019t look entirely convinced. \u201cWe don\u2019t really get to choose the bigger social contracts, though, do we? Not as individual members of a species, at least. It\u2019s not like we ever get to opt out of being human, for instance\u2014except by dying.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, traditionally, that\u2019s true. Although here, with the Chiggers . . . \u201d\nBut I didn\u2019t need to finish my counterpoint. From the look on Dirk\u2019s face, I knew that Hoover\u2019s example now hung painfully in the air between us. And . . . there was that damned pinching beneath my ribs again, to see him plainly hurting over it. Hold on, kiddo. Not long now.\n\u201cLook, love, all I\u2019m saying is, we have a history of struggling with society-sized contracts, even if we maybe don\u2019t treat them the same as we do our implicit contracts with direct partners. But maybe we should. Maybe it\u2019s worth making a habit of revisiting our baseline beliefs\u2014starting with what we assumed about this world when we first landed here.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine.\u201d Oh, but Dirk looked tired now. Was he taking this as an argument? It wasn\u2019t meant as an argument, but there it was . . . his defeated \u201cI\u2019ll add it to the list, chief.\u201d\nEesh. I especially didn\u2019t like it when he put extra distance between us.\n\u201cLove,\u201d I said, firmly.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you on my tracker, too, you know.\u201d\nDirk didn\u2019t look up, but his expression softened. \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of excitement there\u2014food dispensary, bunk, exercise room, commons . . . \u201d\n\u201cLife-saving med-bay runs, emergency search-and-rescue at the harvest sites, brilliant resuscitations of idiot thrill-seeking staff members in the landing bay . . . \u201d\nThe tacit praise pleased him, I could tell\u2014but also plainly jarred, so he waved a dismissive hand before I could go on. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, loudly. \u201cJinx is in the honeycombs and probably wants a word with you. I\u2019ll message after I\u2019ve run the searches you asked for, but\u2014in return\u2014no more bites in the wilderness. Understood?\u201d\n\u201cUnderstood. We\u2019ll save a few of those for when I get home.\u201d\nI winked, but Dirk\u2019s screen cut out just at the beginning of an eye roll.\n\u201cAh yeah, old man,\u201d I said into the ensuing silence\u2014flexing my fingers after so much time holding up the touchpad. \u201cYou still got it.\u201d\n7\nAfter the land of the Feru\u2014filled to its limits with interconnected constituents\u2014and the land of the Esh\u2014where the Esh had gathered more or less into one massive whole\u2014the land of the Saludons seemed downright disordered, even as the people upon it moved in rigid formations from one work site to the next. Doubtless, though, they, the Feru, and the Esh would all have called the Partnership\u2019s the messiest of all foreign-owned territories on Drasti Prime\u2014and they wouldn\u2019t have been wrong in their assessment, either. We humans went where we pleased, by and large, as I was doing just now. Hell, even the Spinners consistently moved in packs, so only the Chiggers\u2019 wandering flight paths even approximated our individual movements across the landscapes. And the Chiggers were technically classified as pests, so . . .\nI waved with affected confidence all the same, once I\u2019d reached the Spinner cluster on the Saludons\u2019 border. Here, the servant-species\u2019 Uranian-blue masks resembled the soldier\u2019s helmet that every Saludon, regardless of her species of origin, wore while on duty in its ranks. But these Spinners also made no sign of recognition\u2014so caught up were they in what looked like a display of species mimicry, a matching of their behavior to that of nearby troops. Did the Spinners do that for us in the Partnership, too? Copying, emulating, trying to fit in with human life through more than the mere wearing of those masks?\nIt would certainly explain why the Spinners for the Esh had been so agitated by the act of reunification, for how in blazes was an invertebrate species supposed to emulate that? Meanwhile, the Feru seemed not to give them much in the way of behavior to replicate in the first place, so swaying in the fields of those unresponsive fronds would surely suffice.\nBut as I considered how the Spinners might be trying to mimic what they knew of the Partnership, a squad of five Saludons approached, their visors open in a preliminary show of trust. And I admit, it was a relief to talk to beings more or less my size again, even if I currently had more reason to fear them than all the rest. First, though, we went through the usual rigamarole between our peoples: I saluted, they saluted. I sent clearance codes to their touchpads, they sent clearance codes to my touchpad. I reaffirmed my commitment to speak in peace, under the conditions laid out by Partnership-Saludon treaty. They reaffirmed the same.\nTedious crap\u2014but reassuring, too, in its familiarity. Maybe there was something to a more algorithmic approach to life after all.\n\u201cGreysl,\u201d said the squad leader, Da\u2019l, when we had finished. Da\u2019l had been Restuvian\u2014I could tell from the yellow-brown mottling under his cheekbones\u2014before the Saludons had conquered his species\u2019 wide-ranging fishing colonies across the stars. Now, though, to mention his ancestry would be as much an insult as a pain: Da\u2019l was Saludon now, nothing more. Did an alliance like the Saludons\u2019 even recognize genocide as a crime the way we did\u2014or was it simply another tool in their quest to assimilate all the cosmos\u2019 most useful forms? The Obys certainly couldn\u2019t be put into service as foot soldiers if captured in battle . . . but maybe as vessels? Cavalry for further conquest in the vacuum of space?\n\u201cThank you for speaking with me,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems like the work goes well with you.\u201d\n\u201cAffirmative,\u201d said Da\u2019l. \u201cQuite well. Our replication experiments have succeeded off-world, so we should complete our mission ahead of schedule. Saludons\u2014FOREVER!\u201d\nHe beat the crest of his body armor, and the rest of the squad echoed the cry. How did the full saying go, that the Saludons used to rally their captured peoples? \u201cGrieve not the fall of your line, for Saludons choose combat only with the very best. Our pride is your pride. Our victory, your victory. Saludons\u2014a unity of strength\u2014FOREVER!\u201d\nA pang of envy cinched in my chest, though, at the rest of Da\u2019l\u2019s comment. Replication experiments meant the ability to reproduce Drasti Prime\u2019s microbial engine elsewhere. If the Saludons had already mastered it, then they stood to benefit greatly from its use in their stellar fleets, while the Partnership would continue to use the microbes only for on-site materials processing and energy conversion. I tried not to think of the long-term implications, too, for such a technologically emboldened Saludon military; our peace, I had to hope, was still secure if the Saludons felt confident sharing their latest achievements with me. (Or maybe, for now, the Partnership\u2019s myriad of alien members simply remained \u201cunworthy\u201d of Saludon attack.) But also, as I chewed over the ramifications of their triumph, there went Essen\u2019s idea, didn\u2019t it? So much for expansion pressures possibly motivating Saludon involvement in the Obys\u2019 destruction. If their peoples were planning instead to leave, they\u2019d no reason to bother.\nWell, that at least left me feeling a touch safer on their turf.\n\u201cPraise be to your triumph,\u201d I said to Da\u2019l. \u201cAs for me, I\u2019m investigating the destruction of the Obys\u2019 last egg\u2014what the Partnership would consider a significant crime.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes, that. Or, you know, a mercy,\u201d Da\u2019l shrugged. \u201cCan you imagine the life awaiting a single, radioactively decaying organism compelled to exist as the last of its kind?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if my expression conveyed surprise or judgment. Either way, Da\u2019l continued with all the confidence of someone who\u2019d hashed this out a dozen times before, perhaps with others in his crew complement over the last three moons:\n\u201cHey, no offense intended. We suspect that the Obys had no other choice, limited sentient being that he was. When he and his mate created their last brood, they were driven by propagation pressures without thinking about the larger consequences. But still . . . from our more evolved perspectives, you have to admit that it was a cruel and selfish act, conceiving another sentient being under such awful circumstances. Saludons would never be so wasteful\u2014never take a people we couldn\u2019t use; never leave a dying breed to suffer further. And yet, what could we do here? It wasn\u2019t our territory, or our responsibility.\u201d\nI parted my lips to respond, all instinctive defense of the Obys giving way to a surprising level of agreement with the horror story the Da\u2019l was suggesting would\u2019ve taken place either way. Still, Da\u2019l\u2019s eagerness to talk\u2014or boast\u2014was only mounting.\n\u201cWe were honored, though\u2014right, squad?\u2014truly honored by the Spinners\u2019 request for aid with this affair.\u201d Da\u2019l glanced at his team, which answered with a rousing HOO-AH! that left Da\u2019l practically beaming. \u201cSo we gave them what they needed. What a world this is, huh? Filled with bioweaponry, brilliant nanotech we\u2019re also hoping to crack soon . . . but not a single projectile weapon in all the Spinners\u2019 arsenal. And sure, they could\u2019ve leapt upon the egg the old-fashioned way, with those brilliant legs and those mighty mandibles of theirs\u2014have you seen them in feeding frenzy? It\u2019s inspiring. We have them down for consideration, you know, for future combat. But they insisted that the Obys\u2019 code needed to be eradicated, not even a scrap remaining, and who were we, as guests here, to dispute our hosts\u2019 accounting?\u201d\nIf Jinx could\u2019ve seen the look on my face . . .\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I managed, working the words through a mouth gone painfully dry. \u201cWe did note the presence of Saludon tech on site, but without all the troop movement that usually accompanies its presence. The Partnership was . . . concerned that your tech might have been the victim of theft, or perhaps that some among your number had broken from the\u2014\u201d\nBut Da\u2019l snorted, and the rest of the squad burst into resonant laughter, before I could finish. I offered a weak smile that conceded the foolishness of such speculation.\n\u201cBut of course not,\u201d I conceded. \u201cThe Saludons are strong and unified in all things. There would never be a dissident faction running rogue among you.\u201d\nDa\u2019l tipped his head in acknowledgement. \u201cWe thank you, though, for your concern. A worthy sentiment from an ally, especially delivered by hand so as to maximize discretion, in case something more serious had been in play. And, yes, we realize what an atypical spectacle a piece of our tech might have seemed to you. Rest assured, though, that when your Partnership finally proves its worthiness for combat, you\u2019ll be met with the sight of far, far more.\u201d\nStars above, this job sometimes.\n\u201cAnd for that . . . courtesy,\u201d I said through gritted teeth. \u201cWe thank you.\u201d\nDa\u2019l and I then formalized the end of our communications with another affirmation of our peace, and an uploading, on the Saludons\u2019 end, of a recording of our exchange. I gave a wary salute to the Spinners at the border, but still they gave no answer. Good. I just hoped that I could reach Jinx before I had to talk to\u2014or rather, confront\u2014the dishonesty of my own.\n8\nI scanned the canyon before making my descent: a far more efficient beeline to the Partnership\u2019s border with the honeycomb caves. The earlier mist had parted, and in the cool evening air, with Drasti Prime\u2019s brown moon rising, floral life was at last beginning to glow and feed in-full. Insect activity followed suit, and soon I froze at the sight of a large scorpioid perched atop a cactus. Too many limbs to be Hoover, I thought, and I didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be any Hooverness left in the real one anyway, but I gave it a friendly howdy just in case.\nA bigger doubt arose, though, as I neared the center of the canyon, and looked up at signs of life from all the surrounding colonies: frond fields swaying in the wind; flickers off an electrical storm briefly illuminating plateau flora in adjacent territories; troop movements marking increased activity around specific dig sites behind me. We four species essentially surrounded a giant, oblong pit\u2014the Partnership, then the Feru, then the Esh, then the Saludons, and finally the honeycomb caves, which shared another border with the Partnership to complete the circle. But no one had been given the canyon itself. To create a buffer? That was one possibility, but the thought of the Spinners taking aim at the Obys\u2019 egg and blasting a hole clean through surrounding structures presented another: perhaps we weren\u2019t the first here after all. Perhaps there\u2019d been another foreign species\u2014right here, right in this gap turned lush over time and with the Chiggers\u2019 help\u2014and maybe its end had also been delivered by a Spinner cluster. Perhaps that was the species that explained the servant-fleet\u2019s fifth mask.\nBut even if so, what did I have to fear from the Spinners, really? Apparently they\u2019d been honest with the Saludons about everything. Why not with me? What had I done, my kid-counselor might have encouraged me to think upon, to limit the amount of genuine openness possible in my interactions with their fleet? I replayed my initial conversation with Kurrick about the Obys\u2019 egg\u2014first in my thoughts, and then on my touchpad, for confirmation.\nGenocide. You let the Obys lay his egg, the last of his kind, in the honeycomb caves beyond our territory two moons ago\u2014but someone\u2019s just obliterated it, which is a crime for which . . . well, to be honest, the Partnership\u2019s never seen a genocide so complete before. In the past, there\u2019s always been survivors to speak for their dead. So I need to know\u2014do you even have laws for this sort of thing? If we find the perpetrator, did your makers leave any formal protocols we could enact against them?\nAtypical circumstance. Convention necessary. We must spin on this.\nWell, that sure as hell sounded declarative on my part: imposing a given narrative from the outset, without giving Kurrick any opportunity to contribute to the framing of the problem itself. But if I\u2019d instead asked her directly if she knew anything about this matter, or had had any part in it, would she have told me the full story right away?\nUnderstood. But do we have permission to seek out the perpetrators beyond our borders, while you consider the legal consequences?\nState your investment in such an action.\nWe\u2019d never know. Instead, Kurrick reacted to the questions I\u2019d asked, and no more. But what else was a biocomputer expected to do? Offer unsolicited information? Under what parameters? And if they were emulating us as other Spinner clusters sought to emulate the rest, then their algorithms for mimicry might even have required them to go along with the narratives we imposed\u2014to learn from our ways, not dispute them, so as to serve us better.\nBecause the Obys\u2019 egg was without defense, its destruction attests to a dishonorable party on the surface of your world. We seek to prevent that party from doing further harm.\nAcknowledged. You may proceed.\nAnd, okay, maybe my wording had been in error\u2014but in more ways than I\u2019d realized at the time. The Spinners had their own diagnostics tests\u2014their accounting, as it were\u2014so maybe, as far as Kurrick was concerned, I\u2019d simply been proposing a similar test of my own. If so, what risk could I have posed for her species, if \u201charm\u201d was all I was looking for\u2014and if the Spinners surely didn\u2019t view what they\u2019d done to the Obys\u2019 egg as that?\nI admit, then, that as I reconsidered this whole conversation, I was also congratulating myself for willingly accepting so much potential blame for our communications failures . . . which was all well and charitably good, until I heard the light but significant thump of a Spinner on the canyon floor behind me\u2014no midair screech in forewarning. Nervous tension gathered in my arms, my fists, as Drasti Prime\u2019s night-sky light went out\u2014or so it seemed, at least\u2014and I turned to greet Kurrick, her face mask glowing in the brown moon\u2019s stead.\n\u201cChecking up on me?\u201d I said, as cheerfully as I could manage in the wide sweep of her shadow. \u201cOr have you finished spinning on the matter of genocide?\u201d\n\u201cIn process,\u201d said Kurrick. \u201cAwaiting the outcome of a request.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s two requests in the last few days, huh? First to the Saludons, then to us.\u201d\nEye movement behind her mask. \u201cAtypical circumstance,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cLook,\u201d I tried again, swallowing hard. \u201cThe Saludons told me they gave you a weapon. And Jinx\u2014my partner\u2014she knows a Saludon weapon was used to the destroy the Obys\u2019 egg. What I don\u2019t understand, Kurrick, is why you invited the Obys to lay his egg in the honeycomb caves at all, if you were just going to destroy it anyway. Why give him hope?\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic.\n\u201cAt the time, we did not know.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know? What, that you were going to destroy it? That doesn\u2019t even . . . \u201d\nBut oh yes, now I really heard it. Now I heard how I was complicating the Spinners\u2019 ability to answer clearly and precisely, computers that they still were\u2014no matter how many roving red eyes they had; no matter how wet their hungry, arachnoid maws. I breathed out and started over\u2014slowly. Simply. One input at a time.\n\u201cKurrick, did you destroy the Obys\u2019 egg?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nI felt at once chilled by the confirmation and calmed by how readily it had been given, once I could keep my damned questions to the point. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cTo protect our accounts.\u201d\n\u201cYour\u2014accounts?\u201d But her meaning dawned on me so suddenly I laughed. \u201cUs. We\u2019re the accounts. Is that it?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The Partnership and the Saludons.\u201d\nI frowned\u2014feeling the pinch of something on my leg and swatting uselessly at it. Not now, Chigger. \u201cJust the Saludons and us? Why not the Feru and the Esh?\u201d\n\u201cNeither the Feru nor the Esh were at risk.\u201d\nBut . . . the Saludons and the Partnership were on opposite sides of the canyon. Yes, technically we both shared a border with the honeycomb caves, but by raw distance within those territories, the Feru were closer to the targeted cell site than the Saludons. What could have threatened both of us and not them?\n\u201cIt was an egg, Kurrick. How could it have harmed us?\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic.\n\u201cThe egg alone could not.\u201d\nI whistled low and slow, a sharp ache under my knee letting me know that another bot had, in fact, delivered its reprogramming protocols to my system. Dirk would not be pleased.\n\u201cBuddy. Kurrick. You\u2019re not making this very\u2014\u201d\nBut a beep on my touchpad signaled another incoming call. Well, speak of the devil.\n\u201cOh, right\u2014and that reminds me,\u201d I said to Kurrick\u2019s luminous blue mask, before raising my forearm to answer my second mate. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta talk about this favor you asked of Dirk, my partner. There are safety protocols you bypassed. We have rules, too, you know.\u201d\n\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d said Kurrick. \u201cApologies.\u201d\nAnd the Spinner stepped back a touch\u2014just enough that I could feel, again, the warm, muted light of Drasti Prime\u2019s night sky while I took my call and tried not to scratch the latest infection site with the heel of my other boot. Now, what in blazes was I supposed to do with such a polite, if occasionally murderous, biocomputer like Kurrick?\n9\n\u201cI was wrong,\u201d said my second mate, the moment I answered.\n\u201cGood evening to you, too,\u201d I laughed\u2014half out of relief just to be out of Kurrick\u2019s shadow; half because of how much I enjoyed the sight of Dirk when he was this intense without being petulant or grumpy. \u201cYou got something for me?\u201d\n\u201cLots. We were wrong, too\u2014the Partnership, I mean. But first, okay, I know I said the Spinners had given me the Obys\u2019 DNA, but that wasn\u2019t quite right. The Obys\u2019 corpse was completely devoured by nanobots, right? Too soon, maybe\u2014but then, how could the decomp team have known to wait? They\u2019re just simple machines following pretty basic algorithms for automatic reprocessing of organic materials. Meanwhile, what\u2019s in this kit the Spinners wanted me to analyze? DNA from the egg.\u201d\n\u201cWell, okay, but that could just be\u2014\u201d\nDirk impatiently waved me off. \u201cGreysl, look\u2014the Obys\u2019 egg was nonviable. I mean seriously unsuited for life, probably from the radioactive parasite that took out mom and dad. So, sure, maybe it would\u2019ve gasped a few awful breaths after hatching\u2014but in days, at most, it too would\u2019ve given out.\u201d\n\u201cOh, the poor thing.\u201d And thank goodness, I realized, that its father hadn\u2019t lived to see it suffer so. Better that he went to his end with even a flicker of hope for his kind on whole.\n\u201cWorse, though,\u201d Dirk went on, with a renewed confidence I was invigorated to see in him. \u201cI went through the early recordings, and, well\u2014listen. This is from one of our first conversations with the Spinners. Two of ours talking, one of theirs.\u201d\nI nodded into the viewscreen, and Dirk started the audio.\n\u2014but the name. There\u2019s got to be . . . everything has a name.\nYes. The makers.\nAn exasperated sigh. No, that\u2019s not what I\u2014\nAnd then the second human voice: Ah, they can\u2019t help it, Silv\u2014they\u2019re just computers. Big, kinda scary-looking computers. And whoever made them, they\u2019re like their gods. So of course they\u2019re going to\u2014\nIt\u2019s just so frustrating that there\u2019s nothing else here, no imprint of them anywhere. Hell, there isn\u2019t even a handle or limb-hold on any of their buildings or equipment to give a sense of how big they were, how they moved, whether they were insectoid, too. Look, can you describe them at all? Is there anything you can give us?\nAnd even the recorder caught the answering tic-tic-tic-tic with perfect clarity. Maybe their legs were just that damned loud, and not just a trick of my primal instincts after all.\nYes, said the Spinner. We are permitted to bestow land upon our guests. There are units near the makers\u2019 caves where we can best give account and ensure your safe continuation for many generations.\nWell all right! said the second human voice. Now that\u2019s more like it, eh, Silv? We can\u2014\nBut at this last Dirk stopped the audio, a great big smile daring me to make the same leaps he already clearly had.\nI decided to let him have . . . well, half of them, at least. I grinned back.\n\u201cThe Spinners answered the questions they were given. The problem was the questions themselves. Could they describe the ancients? Yes, the Spinners could. And was there anything else they could give the Partnership\u2014in general? Land. Oh, love, you realize this means\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, all true\u2014but even more importantly, listen Grey: that means the Spinners also answered our first question honestly, too. \u2018The Makers.\u2019 Not, like, deities . . . but literally, a species that specialized in making life. It was their name because that\u2019s what they did here. Not just with the Spinners, but with everything. That\u2019s what the honeycomb caves are for. That\u2019s what the tech\u2019s for, that the Spinners gave me when it dropped off the egg\u2019s DNA.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean they\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Makers rebooted species to restore natural balance.\u201d Dirk shook his head in obvious professional admiration, and damned if I didn\u2019t enjoy seeing him this passionate again; not just helplessly awaiting another opportunity to react to a medical emergency. Speaking of the latter, though\u2014I had to set one leg against the other to suppress my latest transformation\u2019s itch. Something slippery this time . . . Mollusca? But Dirk was still going on: \u201cThe Spinners kept their accounts by actively monitoring local species, and The Makers produced blueprints for the Chiggers to distribute in the ecosystem, targeting anything that seemed out of balance with the rest. So Grey, Grey\u2014don\u2019t you see? The Makers\u2019 way was always to transform life, not destroy it. So if they were still here, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what they would\u2019ve done with the Obys, too . . . except they aren\u2019t, and that\u2019s the real imbalance now. Only their brainless replication tech remains, which just works with whatever it\u2019s given\u2014good quality source material or not.\u201d\nI inhaled sharply at this last, his eager speech almost as infectious now as the native blueprints along my leg. \u201cSo there were blank-template bots in the honeycomb caves, and they were already trying to save the Obys\u2019 species by mass-replicating the egg\u2019s DNA.\u201d\nDirk snapped his fingers, head bouncing temporarily out of sight in his excitement. \u201cExactly. But remember\u2014the egg was nonviable. So the Chiggers\u2019 programming, running essentially on autopilot, would\u2019ve released massively deformed DNA into the wild.\u201d\n\u201cAnd since the Feru have excellent defenses and the Esh can\u2019t be infected the same way . . . that means only the Saludons and our people could\u2019ve been transformed by it.\u201d\n\u201cA severely deleterious bit of code, released by another bit of code that\u2019s just responding to initial inputs established by creators who abandoned it eons ago.\u201d\nI almost didn\u2019t recognize my answering, triumphant cry. \u201cOne-Grey-Cell,\u201d my second mate was still going to call me, once I told him I needed to regenerate a second time in one day . . . but hell if I didn\u2019t make that one grey cell earn its bloody keep.\n\u201cWhich also means, love\u2014don\u2019t you realize? Dirk, this means that the Spinners did something outside their first protocols. I mean, not much outside, but still, a little. A start. Because they were just supposed to keep the accounts in balance, right? And the Obys was one of those accounts. Nevertheless, they chose to prioritize our own. They understood the danger of the Obys egg\u2019s DNA, and put greater value on the actual viability of a given lifeform, rather than a simple maintenance of raw numbers for each species on their roster. Kurrick destroyed anything that could\u2019ve had defective DNA on it . . . to save the rest of us.\u201d\nAnd from the look on Dirk\u2019s face, I knew he didn\u2019t disagree\u2014but still, I was a little deflated by his immediate response.\n\u201cWell, maybe,\u201d he said, bringing the whole register of our conversation down a notch. \u201cTo a point. I mean, we don\u2019t know the exact nature of their original orders\u2014but also, even if you\u2019re right, it might not have been as big a deviation from protocol as you\u2019re making it out to be. Because, sure, Kurrick eliminated the egg, but she also left these materials with me, yeah? And, fine, she can\u2019t order me to do anything with them . . . but maybe what she was trying to say\u2014what the Spinners haven\u2019t quite got the means to say\u2014was . . . \u2018Can you fix it?\u2019\u201d\nMy breath hitched. \u201cYou mean the Obys\u2019 DNA?\u201d\nDirk nodded, barely containing his own burst of excitement. Aha. So no wonder his mood had deflated slightly at my connecting of a few other dots; this was his professional baby now. But\u2014fine, fine. Pick your battles, old man. Focus, Greysl.\n\u201cYou mean there\u2019s a chance that you can . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I mean . . . \u201d Dirk scratched his temple as if to deliberate, but there was no ignoring the spark in his eyes, already at least three steps into the bioprocess in his thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a hell of a challenge tracing all the damage the radiation has done, but yeah, the Partnership has enough on file that I should be able to reset this specific DNA sample without losing our Obys\u2019 contribution. Or the contribution of his obet.\u201d\nI smiled at that final addition. Not entirely a lost cause, this one.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d both have appreciated that very much.\u201d\n\u201cYeah . . . \u201d said Dirk. \u201cOnly thing is, who\u2019s going to be the carrier for the blueprints if I do pull it off? Or carriers, since it wouldn\u2019t be fair to just make one.\u201d\n\u201cOof. For sure. Stars, if only Hoover had known before he\u2019d\u2014\u201d\nBut my second mate\u2019s eyes grew pained before I could stop myself.\n\u201cHey,\u201d I tried again, wishing I could more concretely make amends through the viewscreen. \u201cThis is awesome, love. You\u2019ve done a great job, and you\u2019re going to continue to do a great job. Just\u2014take care of your side of things, okay? I\u2019ll find you volunteers.\u201d\nKurrick\u2019s shadow fell upon me again, though, before I could so much as say goodbye.\n\u201cI have received word from the tunnels,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have reached a verdict.\u201d\nWas it the whirlwind thrill of my conversation with Dirk, or the irritating crawl of my latest infection all down my left leg? Either way, my one grey cell had apparently given out.\n\u201cA verdict on what?\u201d I said in perfect ignorance.\n\u201cOur crime,\u201d the giant arachnid before me replied.\n10\nA few weeks on, as sixteen adolescent Obys prepared to launch into the stars, Jinx was finishing up diplomatic rounds with the attending Feru, Esh, and Saludon representatives, while I listened to Dirk go on for the umpteenth time about the enhancements he\u2019d made to protect our first joint offspring from further radioactive parasites, as well as . . .\n\u201c\u2014\u2018a whole host of other infectious diseases, the likes of which they probably can\u2019t even imagine yet.\u2019 Yes, love, I heard you the first twelve times.\u201d But I smiled and patted his arm, and, well, Dirk was too much in his element to be offended by my impatience anyway.\n\u201cNext up,\u201d he said, positively glowing as he surveyed the canyon floor, which had been converted for the last two moons into an Obys nursery. \u201cI\u2019m going to start tackling the native nanotech. Kurrick walking me through the honeycombs\u2019 controls was all I needed to start to figure out how the Chiggers can be hacked, and maybe made a touch more refined in their transformation protocols for any species out of balance with the local ecosystem.\u201d\nI clapped a hand on his shoulder and shook my head. \u201cStars, the strides our colony might\u2019ve made together earlier, huh? If only we\u2019d bothered to ask the Spinners directly, and with more patience, about their needs in relation to our own.\u201d But I was shaking my head more in wonder than in lament\u2014because it wasn\u2019t just the first generation of Partnership staff that had taken their interactions with the servant-species for granted. It was our generation of colonists, too. Me. And I, of all people\u2014considering what Jinx, Dirk, and I had so painstakingly built together over the years\u2014should\u2019ve known better than to assume. Right?\nBut, ah, always room to grow, as our counselor had warmly suggested during our first group session after I\u2019d recovered from becoming part slug, and been ready at last to start talking out my grief over the old Obys and his struggles here on Drasti Prime. Smart kid, that one. Sometimes the future seemed in remarkably good hands.\nThe memory did twinge a bit, though, as I scanned the canyon floor and tried to make out which of the sixteen creatures below had once been Kurrick. It wasn\u2019t easy, because in place of the stately and self-controlled Spinners\u2019 bodies, you had a bunch of floppy, awkward beginners attempting minor takeoffs that had them gliding meters high, at least, before crashing to the ground anew. According to Jinx, one among their number had apparently crashed so theatrically just the other day that a whole host of local fauna\u2014one massive scorpioid among them\u2014hadn\u2019t had time to escape the descending space-worm\u2019s shadow. Wincing at each other in the retelling, we\u2019d made a solemn vow not to mention it to Dirk\u2014and now I realized I\u2019d miss my Kurrick at least a little like he still clearly missed his Hoover.\nI mean, obviously, these sixteen Obys were far less unsettling than the local Spinners\u2019 forms had been\u2014and for this reason alone I know I should\u2019ve been happier, at least on some deeper and more primal level, about the whole transformative affair. But when Kurrick had first come to me with her species\u2019 verdict, the result of careful spinning on how best to handle her kind\u2019s complicity in another species\u2019 complete destruction, \u201caesthetics\u201d had funnily enough not even warranted a mention in their final deliberations.\n\u201cWe are\u2014out of balance,\u201d she had explained instead. \u201cAs such, members of our own account will provide the necessary adjustment.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014you\u2019ll lose yourselves in the process,\u201d I\u2019d countered. \u201cYou\u2019ll become Obys completely. One life sacrificed for another\u2014that can\u2019t possibly be a fair accounting either.\u201d\nTic-tic-tic-tic. The last of those damned spooky calculations I\u2019d ever hear her make.\n\u201cIt is\u2014no less than The Makers did, when they too erred in their accounting.\u201d\nAnd with that . . . well, whew, talk about your offhand remarks containing multitudes. But even without pressing further on this accord\u2014even without accidentally losing myself again to my species\u2019 relentless need to impose narratives on everyone around them\u2014I understood at once the gist of what she must have meant. The canyon. The Spinners\u2019 fifth face mask. A whole other species lost to some ancient error on The Makers\u2019 part\u2014either of a moral nature or purely accidental. A whole other slice of alien history on Drasti Prime.\n\u201cYour makers\u2014The Makers\u2014they\u2019d have been proud of you, you know,\u201d I said instead, though I hardly knew if Kurrick even needed encouragement for what she was willing to undergo. Did the Spinners have functional algorithms for fear? So much still for me to learn, that now I\u2019d never have the chance to learn from her. But so it went with every ex, I guess.\n\u201cEven after all this time\u2014all this emulation of other guests,\u201d I continued, just in case it might have mattered after all, \u201cyou\u2019re still attending to their needs and wishes above all else.\u201d\nAnd even if fear was off the table, maybe Spinners could still feel puzzled, because\u2014\n\u201cBut of course,\u201d Kurrick instantly replied, eyes darting curiously behind her mask. \u201cThe Makers are\u2014primary. Our first account to attend to, as the rest of my kind always will.\u201d\nWeeks and a whole whirlwind of species transformations later, I looked across the canyon ridge at the small dark dot of Jinx\u2019s uniform, and felt the weight of those words even more acutely. Jinx had clearly just finished up with the Saludons\u2014who after extensive and tediously ritualistic bargaining had finally confirmed a solemn vow not to consider the Obys worthy of combat for at least another millennium\u2014and now my first mate was making her way back to our territory by way of the honeycomb caves.\nSoon one of the Obys under all our watchful eyes (and cloud-forms, and spores) would manage the trick of it, I knew. Soon one of the sixteen converted Spinners\u2014each not too long ago a frightful, shrieking sight when it descended upon its prey\u2014would launch successfully into Drasti Prime\u2019s sky, rising higher and higher until it broke clean through the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere, and set off on new adventures in galaxies maybe centuries away.\nMeanwhile, Jinx had been right, of course, to avoid taking on too many fixer-uppers in her own day-to-day practice. One clingy security liaison, forever deflecting from personal needs and anxieties by fixating on the supposed problems of another mate\u2019s behavior, was more than enough for even the most open-minded first mate to handle. But hey, maybe she got off on the difficult cases, too. Maybe Essen would\u2019ve teased her about having a consistent \u201ctype\u201d as well. Either way, I watched her stride towards me with her visor only half down: the twist of an orange-glossed smile, along with a confident pop of her hip, revealing even at a distance her growing sense of relief that all this nonsense was finally at its end.\nAnd relief made her playful.\nRelief made her baiting.\nSo I smiled and held up Kurrick\u2019s old mask\u2014that brilliant Uranian-blue glow, that shocked human countenance, that thin crack from eyehole to gaping mouth\u2014over my own.\nHow best can I serve you, madame?\nCanadian by birth, M L Clark is now based in Colombia.

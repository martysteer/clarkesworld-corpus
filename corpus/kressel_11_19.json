Martha would be late for work if she fed her again, but she couldn\u2019t bear to let the animal suffer. The mutt huddled behind the bar-coded trash bins as Martha put out a dish of microwave rice and a bowl of water. She\u2019d have to remember to pick up some real dog food on the way home.\n \u201cCome on, girl,\u201d Martha said, wiping her brow. It was already ninety-eight degrees and getting hotter. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d\n The mutt, a scrawny little thing, hesitated. God only knew what troubles she had been through.\n Something skittered behind her\u2014a rat\u2014and they both jumped. And when she turned back around, the dog was gone.\n \u201cYou\u2019d better come eat this,\u201d she said to the empty alley, \u201cbefore the rats do.\u201d\n At forty-one, Martha had never married. At first she told herself it was because she hadn\u2019t met the right person. But as she rapidly approached middle age she told herself it was because she valued her independence. But that reason had grown less persuasive after her father got sick and moved in with her so she could take care of him. So maybe Martha was alone because fate had deemed it that way. And in a battle between mortals and fate, fate always wins.\n But, despite her fears of being late, Martha arrived at Mr. Fletcher\u2019s three-story apartment promptly at 8:45 AM, exactly as her wristpad had predicted. She spoke her name and employee number to the door, and it opened wide, then sealed so quickly behind her that her ears popped. It was a brutal 109 outside, and her neatly pressed work uniform was already soaked in sweat. But inside Mr. Fletcher\u2019s climate-controlled apartment it was a cool sixty-eight.\n Her wristpad told her Mr. Fletcher\u2019s couch was on the third floor, so she made her way past a dozen empty rooms, while a small army of cleaning bots parted like respectful soldiers to let her pass. According to company records, Mr. Fletcher had moved in six months ago, but you couldn\u2019t tell by the unfurnished rooms and half-opened boxes scattered about the place like bricks from an ancient ruin.\n The air smelled of paint and new carpet, but as she ascended the stairs, following the map on her wristpad, a sour smell, something halfway between vinegar and piss, overpowered her. It was worse than sweat but kissing-cousins to it. The smell grew stronger as she got closer, and Martha knew she could have followed her nose instead of the map.\n Like the other rooms, this space had many unopened boxes scattered on the floor. But one had been ripped apart like a present on Christmas morning. Pieces lay tossed about the room as if a hungry beast had devoured it. Martha had seen this a hundred times, users madly opening their couches, assembling them in a frenzy, and meshing in before the dust had time to settle.\n Mr. Fletcher lay on his couch, eyes rolling behind closed lids, weeks of beard on his sunken cheeks. The couch\u2019s interface couplers softly hummed against his temples, and stroboscopic lights blasted his brain with petabytes of information. Just twenty-two, Mr. Fletcher was a AAA client, a top earner, according to his file. But you wouldn\u2019t know it by his emaciated, pasty-looking body. Though appearance mattered little when it came to MeshLife. And that was actually one of its selling points.\n Mr. Fletcher\u2019s service bot, a vaguely human-shaped metallic and plastic thing, stood frozen beside him, its console light flashing alert-red. Martha brought up her work order on her wristpad and reviewed the details.\n MeshLife had lost connection with Mr. Fletcher\u2019s service bot two days ago, the file read, and after a sequence of automated repair attempts, the company AIs had chosen Martha as the optimal technician to diagnose the problem. And so here she was.\n She plugged her wristpad into the bot\u2019s console and brought up its logs. She suspected the error before the logs confirmed it: Another failed network board, the fifth one this month.\n \u201cFucking cheap-ass Kazak shit!\u201d she said.\n The company had begun sourcing hardware from a fifth-rate supplier in Kazakhstan, and their parts failed as often as farmers\u2019 crops these days. When she had asked Olembe, her boss, why MeshLife didn\u2019t use a better supplier, he told her the company\u2019s AIs ran the numbers and calculated that even with the failures it was still cheaper to use the Kazak supplier than sourcing parts elsewhere. So much, Martha thought, for company pride.\n The fix was so simple a monkey could do it. She\u2019d swap in a fresh network card and start the diagnostic routines. And, if they checked out, she\u2019d sit and watch the service bot do its caretaker thing for a few minutes: injecting essential fluids and nutrients via IV, removing waste, washing skin and hair, and a dozen other health-related tasks. This last part, watching the bot care for Mr. Fletcher, wasn\u2019t part of her job, but Martha was never comfortable leaving her clients alone until she knew they were safe. These days, some people meshed in for days, even weeks at a time.\n Curious as to what Mr. Fletcher was up to, she tapped up the couch\u2019s monitor.\n Viewing it on a flat screen and not beamed into her brain at 4.216 THz was like comparing a vid of a rollercoaster to actually riding on one. She had meshed in enough times to complete her training, enough to learn that meshing in wasn\u2019t for her. Not because the experience was scary or uncomfortable, but because mesh was so much better than real life that reality afterward felt like returning to a black and white world after seeing color for the first time.\n Mr. Fletcher, or $TopDawg, as he was known in-mesh, stood atop a pedestal in a gargantuan nightclub styled like an Egyptian pyramid. Fantastical creatures swam in the air around him, leaving psychedelic trails of sparkles and rainbows. The real-life Mr. Fletcher resembled the avatar of $TopDawg the way a lump of coal resembled a diamond. In mesh, the man was beautiful, an Adonis of better-than-perfect proportions, every muscle gleaming with sweat, his enormous member barely hidden under silken briefs. He danced to music Martha couldn\u2019t hear, while beneath his pedestal, some four million creatures\u2014avatars from other mesh users\u2014gyrated in the flickering lights. The millions took on weird and grotesque forms, hybrid animals that had not earned their place on the Tree of Life through billions of years of evolution. They thrusted and swayed as $TopDawg led them on. It was an enormous rave-dance-party-fuck-fest-orgy with four million global guests and it wasn\u2019t even nine. Who the hell were these people, Martha wondered, who could afford to do this all day long instead of work? Who could dance and fuck and fritter their lives away while the world slowly withered to nothing?\n A row of multicolored spotlights spun around to point at $TopDawg as he paused in a warrior\u2019s pose. Across his chest, a line of text appeared, solid gold letters growing out from his skin.\n STAY GUCCI! it read.\n Then, as if he were an Olympian athlete tossing a discus, he flung thousands of golden coins into the dancing crowd. The animoid dancers scrambled to pick up the coins like a swarm of hungry pigeons, though there wasn\u2019t nearly enough for all of them.\n Martha queried the console to see what the coins were.\n Get $25 off select Gucci Mesh Wear\u2122. Use coupon code XG74BH at checkout.\n Advertisements in-mesh were scheduled down to the second. At 9:02:14 AM, $TopDawg would promo KillCult IV: Vengeful Blood, a new in-mesh game, by \u201cmurdering\u201d a few thousand partygoers with a laser rifle. At 9:06:37 AM, $TopDawg would wrestle and defeat a giant squid in a promo for Deep Hell, an in-mesh movie. At 9:09:15 AM, $TopDawg would give all willing participants a mind-blowing orgasm in an ad for SoftTouch\u2122, the latest teledildonics app. The ad slots for 9:12 and beyond said, \u201cPending,\u201d which Martha knew meant the company AIs were calculating some complex, multilayered equation that factored in the number of guests, their likes and purchase history, and what today\u2019s advertisers were willing to spend in order to choose an ad that would have the maximum ROI. Martha remembered reading once that the AIs\u2019 method was so opaque that even the company techs admitted they didn\u2019t know quite how it worked.\n Martha checked Mr. Fletcher\u2019s biometrics on the console, and they told a familiar tale: Extremely elevated dopamine and endorphin levels; cortisol hormones dangerously high; blood pressure, body temp, and heart rate far below baseline; and more than five markers in his blood that indicated he was severely malnourished.\n But she didn\u2019t need a monitor to see this. The young man had the wasted appearance of all the mesh-ins she visited. Bony prominences in hips and shoulders, gaunt faces, and edema swelling of the legs. MeshLife service bots were good, but there was only so much they could do for the human body before entropy took over. And Mr. Fletcher\u2019s bot had been offline for two days.\n Outside, a garbage truck rumbled past, while a dozen bots trailed it down the street, emptying trash bins into its carriage almost faster than Martha\u2019s eye could track. The overall effect was like watching spiders unmake a web.\n She opened up the code repository on Mr. Fletcher\u2019s bot and switched into a subfolder. The file\u2019s modification time hadn\u2019t changed since the last time she checked, which meant the company AIs hadn\u2019t found and patched the flaw. The software error stared her in the face, a dangerous bug that could lead to a service bot seriously misjudging a client\u2019s health. A bug that, with just a small code tweak, could be made deadly. She\u2019d discovered it a week ago when diagnosing a faulty biometric reading.\n Last she\u2019d heard, seventy-five percent of the planet meshed in at least once per week. Billions relied on this piece of software to keep them safe. She could let her superiors know about the flaw and receive a $162.14 finder bonus on her next paycheck. Her boss, Olembe, would give her a smile and a pat on the back. And next week she\u2019d be at another huge and mostly empty house, repairing a faulty network board on a bot made with shitty Kazak parts, just so another overprivileged, spoiled kid could sell pretend shit to millions of their \u201cfriends,\u201d while MeshLife would keep making trillions.\n Martha stared at the file for a good minute before she closed it and deleted any evidence of having looked at it. Then she began replacing the faulty network board.\n Today\u2019s fusillade of ads were for a line of smart diapers. They followed her from street to subway to bus to home, hectoring her from billboards, wall-screens, pads, and even a sleeping girl\u2019s smartwatch.\n \u201cGood evening, Martha! Did you know our diapers can alert caregivers when they need to be changed? And with our new AdaptiveWetness\u2122 technology, they can be worn for almost twice as long as the leading diaper brand.\u201d\n $PinkFox, or a very good synth of them, modeled the diapers in most of the ads. A few months back, in a lonely moment, Martha had googled $PinkFox without enabling private mode in her browser, and now this nineteen-year-old androgynous sylph followed her everywhere. The fact that they continued to appear meant Martha looked at them more often than she cared to admit.\n As she stepped into her apartment, dripping in sweat, a wave of exhaustion swept over her. \u201cShit!\u201d she said when she spotted the empty box of microwave rice on the table. She\u2019d forgotten to buy dog food.\n \u201cWho the fuck is that?\u201d came a voice from the bedroom. \u201cI have a gun!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s me, Dad,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s Martha.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cMartha!\u201d\n Her father didn\u2019t have a gun, of course. He could barely get out of bed, most days. But that didn\u2019t stop him from threatening her every damn time she got home.\n \u201cWhy is it so hot in here?\u201d Martha asked. The thermostat said it was eighty-eight degrees inside. \u201cWhy\u2019d you shut off the AC, Dad? You can\u2019t do that! It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n She set the temp at seventy-five, the lowest the software let her go, then made a mental note to remove her father\u2019s voice access to the thermostat. A few weeks ago, when she\u2019d complained to the super about the AC\u2019s lower limit, he\u2019d said the restriction was out of his control, that it had been auto-updated by the manufacturer to comply with state regulations. When Martha protested that she regularly visited clients with lower thermostat settings, the man just shrugged and said it was out of his hands.\n She walked down the hall toward her father\u2019s bedroom, and a foul smell grew with the overloud sounds from the TV.\n As she stepped through the threshold into the bedroom her father shouted, \u201cDiane? Where the fuck were you? I\u2019m hungry, god dammit!\u201d\n \u201cMom\u2019s dead, Dad,\u201d Martha said flatly. \u201cI\u2019m your daughter, Martha.\u201d She winced and held her nose. \u201cChrist, Dad, did you shit yourself again? It smells like a sewer in here.\u201d\n Her father lay in bed, sheets half-covering his sweaty, shirtless body. His gaunt face was covered in a pasty sheen that flickered in the TV light.\n \u201c\u2014pollinator bee colonies fell by another 6% in the winter of 2037-38,\u201d said a pixel-perfect beauty from the TV, \u201caccording to a new study, down 91% since 2020. Farmers of corn, wheat, rice, soybeans, and sorghum are petitioning the Schiff Administration for more assistance, since their crops are likely to fail again this season without sufficient pollinators.\u201d\n \u201cLiars!\u201d her father screamed. \u201cIt\u2019s all fucking fake! Goddamned liars!\u201d\n The TV cut to President Schiff, drinking a cocktail in a hot tub while three scantily clad women massaged his shoulders. \u201cThe farmers dug their own graves by not relying on drone pollinators,\u201d President Schiff said. \u201cI tell you indoor farming is the future, and relying on \u2018bugs\u2019 to do the dirty work is just plain stupid!\u201d\n \u201cTV, off!\u201d Martha said, and the TV obeyed. A silence filled the room like the absence of a friend she never really liked.\n \u201cHey!\u201d her father said. \u201cI was watching that!\u201d\n \u201cAll you do is scream at it,\u201d she said.\n \u201cTV, on!\u201d her father said, and light and sound exploded back into the room.\n Martha stormed around to the back of the dresser and yanked out the power cord.\n \u201cYou bitch!\u201d her father snapped. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d\n \u201cDad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou stink.\u201d\n His eyes burned with tears and rage as she approached him. She lifted the top sheet and chanced a look, then winced and turned away. The mess was worse than she\u2019d expected.\n \u201cJesus,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy can\u2019t you go to the bathroom like a human being?\u201d\n His voice, softer now, broke with a sob. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d\n Martha shut her eyes, and $PinkFox\u2019s diapered body danced before her closed lids. Sometimes she wondered if the ads knew her better than she knew herself.\n After she had bathed and fed her father, changed his sheets, and done her best to remove the lingering smell from the air, she collapsed into a chair beside his bed. Her father softly snored, while the TV played some old scifi movie about a guy who gets abandoned on Mars and has to use his ingenuity to survive.\n She\u2019d fallen asleep in the chair when her father\u2019s voice woke her.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t go to Mars no more,\u201d he said.\n \u201cHuh?\u201d she said as she sat up. Her stomach rumbled.\n \u201cWhen I was a boy, that\u2019s all you heard talk. \u2018We going to Mars. We gonna start a city there.\u2019 It was all from that Must guy.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean Elon Musk?\u201d Martha said.\n \u201cYeah, him! He was all gung ho about Mars.\u201d\n \u201cThey landed there back in \u201929,\u201d she said.\n \u201cBut not to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were supposed to start a new world there. What ever happened to that?\u201d\n Martha didn\u2019t answer. Mesh happened, she knew. And she worked for the company that sucked away people\u2019s lives like mosquitoes drank blood. It disgusted her. But after months of searching for work, MeshLife was the only job she could find. Without it, she couldn\u2019t afford this apartment or provide for her father. And as much as she loathed him sometimes, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to abandon him to the system.\n \u201cGood night, Dad,\u201d she said as she stood.\n \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Diane?\u201d\n On the screen, the hero leaped for joy as one of his inventions worked.\n Martha awoke just before dawn on the living room couch, still in her work clothes. Her stomach rumbled loudly. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything last night, but halfway to the kitchen she spotted the box of microwave rice and remembered the dog. \u201cFuck,\u201d she said.\n Ten minutes later she was down in the alley. The bowls she\u2019d left out yesterday were empty, and she placed the new ones beside them. The scrawny mutt eagerly peered out from behind one of the trash bins as if it had been waiting there all night just for her arrival.\n \u201cBetter eat and drink,\u201d Martha said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be another scorcher.\u201d\n The mutt took a tentative step toward the bowls, and Martha took two steps back to give her some room. The dog gave her a mournful look, and Martha wondered if she would survive another day in this heat. The dog devoured the rice, then looked eager-eyed up at her, waiting for more.\n Martha\u2019s chest tightened. She\u2019d definitely need to change a lot of things in her life, and Dad might need more than a little convincing, but Martha made the decision instantly.\n \u201cI have more food inside,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we can get you out of this awful heat. Do you want to come in with me?\u201d\n A brief wag of her tail signaled she was at least open to the idea.\n \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Martha said, beckoning the dog toward the alley door. \u201cThis way.\u201d She propped open the heavy steel door and stood at the threshold, waiting.\n The dog nervously approached her and stopped when she reached the door. Martha held out her hand, palm up, toward the dog. She sniffed Martha\u2019s fingers, then gave her palm a single lick that tickled. Martha smiled and reached out to give the dog a friendly pat, when her watch beeped.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll miss your appointment with City Health Services if you don\u2019t leave now,\u201d it said, and at its sound the dog startled and ran back into the alley.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just my watch!\u201d Martha shouted, quickly muting it. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared!\u201d\n The dog timidly peered out from behind a trash bin, unconvinced.\n Martha\u2019s watch vibrated again in silent warning.\n \u201cIt\u2019s my dad,\u201d Martha said. \u201cI want to stay but . . . \u201d She swallowed down a growing tightness in her throat. \u201cI have to go do something for him. If I miss this appointment, I have to wait six months for another.\u201d The dog watched her, as if trying to comprehend. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Martha said. \u201cBut I really have to go. Stay in the shade, will you? I\u2019ll get some real dog food for you today. Promise.\u201d\n Martha slowly made her way toward the alley exit, and when she looked back, the dog was still watching her.\n A rat darted into the alley, saw the dog, and skittered away.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry Ms. Reston,\u201d the city health clerk said to Martha from behind a thick plexiglass window, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing more I can do.\u201d\n Above the clerk\u2019s head, a screen read, \u201cNow serving: D-403.\u201d To their left and right, a dozen other clerks were talking to more people, and behind Martha, a snaking queue of several hundred people waited impatiently inside rope-bordered aisles. Everyone looked as exhausted as Martha felt.\n \u201cPlease,\u201d Martha said to the woman, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for four hours. There has to be something you can do.\u201d\n \u201cLike I said,\u201d the clerk said, without a trace of sympathy. \u201cYou father doesn\u2019t qualify for full-time care or a visiting nurse.\u201d\n \u201cBut he has dementia!\u201d Martha snapped, feeling her composure slipping. \u201cAnd I work a full-time job. I took off today to come here. I\u2019m not getting paid for today.\u201d\n \u201cYou can call the city\u2019s health service hotline and\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI did call the hotline!\u201d Martha said. \u201cThey told me to come here!\u201d\n \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you that my system says your father doesn\u2019t qualify.\u201d\n \u201cYour system says that?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n \u201cBut who actually says that?\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d Martha said. \u201cWho actually says he doesn\u2019t qualify?\u201d\n \u201cThe system says that,\u201d the clerk said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n \u201cBut you\u2019re just reading your screen,\u201d Martha said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n \u201cSo who decides what the system does and doesn\u2019t approve?\u201d\n \u201cAn algorithm makes the decision.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean an AI,\u201d Martha said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the clerk. \u201cSo there\u2019s no human bias.\u201d\n Martha took a long, slow breath. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be someone I can speak to.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d the clerk said, \u201cthe city\u2019s health service hotline. The number is\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThanks,\u201d Martha said, stepping away. \u201cThanks for nothing.\u201d\n A bell dinged and the sign above the clerk read, \u201cNow serving: E-609.\u201d\n Martha felt faint and really needed to eat something. She let her watch lead her to a bar-restaurant a few blocks from the health office. The place was sparsely filled with older clientele who swiped at their wrists or watched a conservative news feed on the big screen in the back. She sat at the bar and ordered a mock-meat burger, fries, and a beer. As the calories and alcohol entered her body, her rage softened.\n The city AIs will deny services the first few times as a weed-out measure, she\u2019d read on a forum for people taking care of sick parents. If you keep trying, eventually you\u2019ll get what you need.\n But this was her third time visiting the health office, and she\u2019d called their hotline at least fifty times. How much more begging did she have to do before they decided to help?\n She sighed and thought about the dog. She was growing used to Martha, and if her watch hadn\u2019t gone off she would have even let Martha pet her. When she got home, she\u2019d convince the dog to come inside with her. She couldn\u2019t really afford another mouth to feed, but maybe if she reported that dangerous bug and got her $162.14 bonus, it would help some. Dad might need more convincing, but Martha had read that some folks with dementia were soothed by having a dog.\n What would she name her? Samantha? No, she once had a friend named Samantha. What about Bella? No, that didn\u2019t fit. The mutt was a survivor and needed a survivor\u2019s name. What about Circe? Circe was a badass goddess who poisoned her enemies and transformed them into beasts, powers Martha wished she had. She imagined bringing the dog to the park with her father, when it wasn\u2019t so hot, and playing fetch with a ball.\n \u201cCirce,\u201d she said, trying the name aloud. \u201cBring it here, Circe.\u201d\n \u201cPardon?\u201d the bartender said.\n \u201cOh, nothing,\u201d Martha said, her cheeks growing hot. \u201cWait\u2014is there a pet store nearby? I need to pick up some dog food.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, on Seneca,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cMake a right out the door, go two blocks up, then make a left. You\u2019ll see it.\u201d\n \u201cThanks,\u201d Martha said.\n She was about to ask for the check when her wrist chirped with a call from home. She tapped the answer button. On the small screen, her father thrashed about his bedroom. \u201cI can\u2019t find it!\u201d he screamed. \u201cI can\u2019t find it!\u201d\n He was naked, and a dark stain ran down his leg.\n \u201cWhere is it?\u201d he screamed. \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d\n Her father hadn\u2019t called her. Weeks ago, she\u2019d put a medical monitor on him and programmed it to contact her if his vitals reached a certain threshold. Right now his heart rate and blood pressure were through the roof.\n \u201cDad!\u201d she said to her screen. \u201cDad, I\u2019m coming! I\u2019m coming home!\u201d\n \u201cWhere is it?\u201d he screamed. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n What should have been a forty minute ride took almost two hours. Her watch told her that because of construction she was better off taking an alternate subway and transferring to a bus. But the alternate subway had signal problems, and the bus route was so crowded she had to wait for three buses to come before there was room enough for her to board.\n She tried calling her father a dozen times, but he didn\u2019t pick up. $PinkFox ads followed her the whole way, offering relief from stress with a new strain of soothing vape oil. Martha cursed each time the self-driving bus, ultracautious, stopped at a yellow light it could have easily gone through or to let another vehicle have the right of way. She had bitten her fingernails down to nubs by the time she walked in the door of her apartment.\n \u201cDad?\u201d she shouted. \u201cDad!\u201d\n Inside his bedroom, it looked as if a bomb had gone off. Papers, clothes, picture frames, and books had been tossed around the room. The TV and lamp lay on the floor, both shattered. Every drawer was open, and whatever had lain in them was now somewhere about the room.\n She found him on the floor of the closet. The hangar rod had been pulled from the wall and lay across his soiled, naked body.\n \u201cOh my god\u2014Dad!\u201d she said, running to him. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t find it!\u201d he said, tears streaming down his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not here!\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, crouching beside him. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d\n He looked up at her, his eyes wet and bloodshot, as his lower lip quivered. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know . . . \u201d\n \u201cOh, Dad,\u201d she said, taking him in her arms. He was filthy, but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cOh, Dad.\u201d\n He wept and shivered, and Martha held him, until the sun began to set. Cleaning up the mess took hours, and some things, like the TV and lamp, would need replacing with money she didn\u2019t have.\n By the time he had calmed enough to fall asleep, it was after midnight. And it was only now that she remembered Circe. \u201cFuck!\u201d she said.\n She darted out of the apartment and down into the alley.\n \u201cCirce?\u201d she called to the blue-tinged shadows. \u201cCirce, are you here?\u201d\n The air smelled of soured milk and decades of garbage. The only reply came from the straining air-conditioners above.\n \u201cIf you come inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you real dog food every day. And a soft doggie bed to sleep on. And a bath. You really need a bath.\u201d\n She checked the time. She really had to get to bed if she wanted to get up for work tomorrow.\n \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, slowly heading back to the door. \u201cPlease come back. I\u2019m sorry I left today.\u201d\n Overhead, a city drone buzzed past. Otherwise, the alley was silent.\n As she walked the stairwell back up to her apartment, she had her watch order dog food with expedited delivery. It was obscenely expensive, but she didn\u2019t care.\n \u201cYour purchase of dog food for circle has been confirmed,\u201d her watch replied.\n \u201cCirce!\u201d she said. \u201cHer name is Circe.\u201d\n She was up early and showered quickly, but her stomach was too twisted into knots worrying about Circe to eat much. She prepared two bowls of oatmeal and water and headed downstairs.\n It was hot in the alley, and the trash bins were already baking in the sun. Something was different here this morning, but she couldn\u2019t quite place it.\n She put down the fresh bowls next to the empty others. \u201cCirce?\u201d she called. \u201cCir-ce?\u201d\n She waited, but the dog didn\u2019t come.\n \u201cCirce? C\u2019mon, girl! I have food here!\u201d\n She stepped forward, searching behind the bins. Something was rotting in one, and the heat wasn\u2019t helping the smell. The smell grew stronger as she walked. Then she heard the flies.\n She spotted a tail, a thin, fuzzy thing, peeking out from under one of the bins. \u201cCirce?\u201d\n She crouched down to look. The dog lay still, as if sleeping. Beside her was a pile of vomit. Beside the vomit was a half-eaten rat. Flies swarmed.\n Shaking now, Martha stood. This wasn\u2019t real. She and Circe and Dad would go to the park. Dad would grow calmer with Circe around. She would be his best friend.\n Martha\u2019s gaze came to rest on a poster applied to the wall. It hadn\u2019t been here yesterday.\n The City Health Department has detected a high level of vermin in this area. Rat poison has been automatically applied by aerial drones. Use caution with children or pets when entering this zone.\n The same poster had been stuck every fifty feet along the wall.\n Circe was hungry, and Martha hadn\u2019t fed her enough. So Circe ate a rat. But the rat had been poisoned. And so Circe had been poisoned too.\n Martha crouched down again. The dead dog\u2019s eyes stared at her.\n Something chittered down the alley. A dozen sanitation bots were working their way through the bins, carrying off trash almost too fast for her eyes to follow. When they reached Circe, they didn\u2019t pause. One scooped her up and carried her off, while two more scrubbed the ground clean. In seconds, it was as if Circe had never been.\n Her watch chirped. \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave now,\u201d it said, \u201cyou\u2019ll be late for work.\u201d\n Mr. Hoffman was nineteen and lived alone in a huge high-rise apartment paid for by the proceeds he earned from doing in-mesh promos, Martha\u2019s work-order said. His couch sat by the window with impressive views of the city. But Mr. Hoffman hadn\u2019t left his couch\u2014hadn\u2019t opened his eyes\u2014in eighteen days. And like the dozens before him, Mr. Hoffman\u2019s service bot had failed. It was the same piece-of-shit Kazak network board, the same five-minute fix.\n Martha stood before the window, staring out at the city. How many, she wondered, were meshing-in right this very moment?\n Her watch beeped. \u201cYour order of dog food has just been delivered,\u201d it said.\n She stared at the message for a moment before swiping it away.\n On the service bot\u2019s console, she brought up the code repository. The dangerous software bug she had found a few weeks back stared at her like a dead dog\u2019s eyes. She activated the keyboard and made a small code change, then pushed it upstream. If the company AIs approved the change, at the next software update her code would be sent out to billions of mesh users. She\u2019d get her $162.14 bug-finder\u2019s bonus, and her boss, Olembe, would pat her on the back.\n And in a week, maybe two, the first of them would start to die.\n She wondered if anyone would notice before then.\n Matthew Kressel is a writer & software developer.

Their ghostly protuberances wrap around the wings of the plane, obscuring the blue AOL logo with their wispy fingers, and then retreat under the stream of air from the props, swirling and compacting into tight white formations that remind me of those queer plants\u2014what were they called? Vegetable sheep. I\u2019ve seen them on my vacation in New Zealand, years ago, when there was a New Zealand. These plants are related to daisies, the tour guide said. It was hard to believe that.\nI watch the columns of numbers that scroll across my retinal implant, with an occasional commercial interruption from my employer, only nowadays they call them \u2018congressional communiqu\u00e9s\u2019. I suppose they are. I wish I could save them to reread them later, but preserving such trivia is not worth getting arrested for.\nThe clouds swirl, tighter and snugger, their color deepening into grey, and my plane circles them this way and that, herding them together, making them coalesce like vegetable sheep in the New Zealand mountains. The plane growls like a sheep dog, and the clouds gain mass and finally weep. I circle them again, strangely uneasy about their watery release. Rain is good, I remind myself. Rain is power, rain is electricity, rain is new juice in the batteries.\nThe radio implant buzzes and I wince.\n\u201cAnita,\u201d it says, and for a moment I believe it is speaking to me\u2014the radio, I mean, not just the person on the other end. The illusion fades. \u201cYou better come down\u2014you\u2019re running low.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cI was just about to.\u201d I touch the pads and spiral downwards, like a falling leaf, with grace and dignity.\nIt is raining hard when I land, the black wings of the generator\u2019s membranes thrumming, vibrating up and down, giving birth to electricity that feeds the city around it. It is like a giant diaphragm, its undulations under the insistent drumming of the raindrops betraying its thoughts to the world. The Greeks used to think that the diaphragm\u2019s movement generated thoughts, and I am almost ready to believe that. The membrane thrums, its dark thoughts enveloping the city with fog. I glance at the time indicator of my heads-up display and rush away from the airfield, through the iron gates of the energy factory. I am running late.\nThe rain is pouring now, and my yellow slicker caves under the coalescing and dividing rivulets of rainwater, presses against my shirt, cooling my skin, crushing my chest with its weight. It is hard to breathe underwater. I cross the streets, knocking over the mushroom caps that have colonized every sidewalk and almost skid on the patch of green algae, camouflaged treacherously between the white stripes of the pedestrian crossing, but right myself. I have an appointment to keep. I enter the cafe, and wedge my body into a narrow booth, and look out of the window until a tall mermaid-like shape swims from out of the rain. My granddaughter.\n\u201cHi, Anita,\u201d says the girl as she slides sideways into the booth, keeping her head down, as if afraid that someone would recognize her. She is afraid that someone would recognize her, I think. This is why she never calls me grandma.\n\u201cHi, baby. Does your mother know you\u2019re here?\u201d\nShe scoffs. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby, Anita.\u201d\nI know that. I just want to find out if my daughter ever asks about me.\nShe softens, and smiles at the waiter who brings us a pitcher of cold water. \u201cWe\u2019ll need another minute,\u201d she tells him, her eyes green and vacant, like those of a cat. New contacts, I guess. Then she turns those hollow eyes at me. \u201cI wanted to talk to you, Anita,\u201d she says in a caring voice. As if she\u2019s the grown up.\nI nod. \u201cGo ahead, Ilona.\u201d I know what she\u2019s going to say.\nShe leans in, her narrow palm pressed against the plastic of the table between us. \u201cHow old are you, Anita?\u201d\n\u201cSixty-eight.\u201d\n\u201cIt shows.\u201d\nWe stare at each other, not blinking, and under her gaze I feel every blemish and wrinkle pucker up, turn purple, leer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be cruel,\u201d she says, \u201cbut you don\u2019t have to look this way.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d If I change, will you be less embarrassed of being seen with me? \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to think about,\u201d she says with a beam of confidence only pretty teenage girls can muster, and starts flipping through her menu.\nI do the same, all the while wondering why am I not ashamed of my face? Instead, I cringe at the thought of my optimized heart and metal joints, of my eyes that can see so well because of lasers, of my new healthy lungs. I can only bear these artifices within me because my old skin is covering them up. I could not imagine separating from it. But the love, the love . . . my eyes skim over the lines in front of me, as I imagine what it would be like to have my daughter back, my granddaughter not ashamed.\nMy granddaughter looks up and frowns. She pulls out a handkerchief tucked in her wristband, spits in it, and rubs my cheek, as intrusive and unselfconscious as a parent with her child. I submit. She looks at the handkerchief, incredulous. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a green smudge. \u201cAlgae,\u201d I say. \u201cThey grow everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cOn your face?\u201d She doesn\u2019t bother to hide her disgust.\n\u201cIt\u2019s even wetter up in the clouds,\u201d I say. \u201cThey look like vegetable sheep from up there. You should\u2014\u201d\nShe interrupts. \u201cVegetable sheep?\u201d\n\u201cBig white and grey cushions\u2014millions of tiny plants wedged together, all the same height. They grow high up in the mountains, where it\u2019s cold. If one grows taller than the others, it dies of frostbite.\u201d I\u2019m not making sense, and I change the subject. \u201cAnyway. How\u2019re things at school?\u201d\n\u201cBoring.\u201d She gives a little laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m out of there.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019ll be better once you\u2019re out?\u201d\nShe jerks her shoulder and gives me a smoldering look. \u201cOh, don\u2019t start. Just \u2019cause you\u2019re depressed, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to be too.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper. I am.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to order,\u201d she tells the waiter who\u2019s been hovering nearby. After he departs, she gives me a cheerful smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better once you get your face fixed up.\u201d\nBeauty is fleeting, I want to say, but think better of it. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, sweetie. Everything will be okay.\u201d\nAt night, I lie awake listening to the rain\u2019s whisper outside, thinking of love. I believe it is my failure that my daughter would not talk to me, and my granddaughter treats me as a child. I wish I knew how to fix it, how to fit into the snug world of the people I care about. Instead, I leave them behind, on the ground, as my plane sputters and spits jets of dust into too-warm, moist air. I don\u2019t just herd clouds, I make them on occasion. The dust is called \u2018condensation nuclei\u2019, but they\u2019re just dust. Tiny grains lodging under my fingernails and making me cough, the grains that already cost me a pair of lungs. I don\u2019t really mind, as long as they make clouds appear out of thin, oversaturated air. I wish I could show my granddaughter that, and perhaps she would love them as much as I do, and by extension love me. I almost weep with joy when the morning comes, grey, weeping along with me.\nAt the factory, I flash my badge at the security guard, who nods back\u2014a sad little ritual we exchange for the past forty years. I don\u2019t give him a second look\u2014my gaze travels past the undulating membranes toward the airfield.\n\u201cWait,\u201d he calls. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d\nI open the manila envelope he gives me, with a panicked strumming of the heart against its cage. This is it, I think. They are finally going to let me go.\n\u201cSome girl dropped it off this morning,\u201d the guard says.\nI shield the piece of paper with the envelope, and the raindrops splash and slide down the smooth yellow surface. It\u2019s just some photographs. I look closer, and my frantic heart seizes up: it is a picture of the vegetable sheep\u2014just like I remember them, white, snug, content. There\u2019s a close up of one, and on the next frame there\u2019s a bird\u2019s eye view of them, scattering in groups and solitarily across the green mountains. I swallow hard.\n\u201cA pretty girl,\u201d the guard says. \u201cDidn\u2019t tell her name or anything, just that you\u2019d know.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my granddaughter,\u201d I say, and turn away, stuffing the pictures back into the envelope, to hide them from moisture.\nI wonder where she got them as I walk to my plane. There are none on the govnet, just like there is nothing there that would remind us that there is a world outside of our shrinking rainy continent. There are no kangaroos, Coliseum, Aegean Sea, or Sahara. Things she will never know about; yet, she found me the vegetable sheep. I am grateful, and surprised, and a bit sad that I have underestimated her.\nThe plane rises, and there are almost no clouds. I find a pocket of wet, warm air\u2014I don\u2019t need the sensors to tell me that, I can see the way it shimmers\u2014and turn on my dust cannons on full blast. At first, there are only streams of grey refuse, but then, without warning, a thick fog condenses into white tufts, and soon there are enough of them to nudge gently with the jets of air, until they are compact and round. I pull the pictures out of the envelope and spread them across the seat next to me. I cannot wait to see her, to tell her how much those clouds trapped among the green mountains mean to me.\nI never get a chance. I call her as soon as I land, from the soaked airfield. She does not answer her phone, even though I know she never detaches it from her ear. I am starting to worry, but then my ear-piece buzzes.\n\u201cBaby,\u201d I say, \u201care you all right?\u201d\nThere\u2019s sobbing, and it\u2019s not Ilona. \u201cAnita?\u201d Finally, in a halting, hoarse voice. It is my daughter.\n\u201cPetra,\u201d I whisper. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. But Ilona\u2019s missing.\u201d\nI count breaths. The joy of hearing my daughter\u2019s voice is dissolved in her tears, and I don\u2019t know what to say.\n\u201cWill you help me find her?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cCan you come over?\u201d\nOf course I can. She lives too far to walk, and I grab the first velorickshaw who idles by the gates of the factory, waiting for the pilots and the engineers to leave for the day. I settle into the rickety, leaking cab, and think, trying to ignore the water splashing in my face with every turn of the rickshaw\u2019s feet on the pedals.\nI think of what I can do\u2014the friends to talk to, the old favors to call on. I\u2019m not like Petra, who\u2014I can feel it, I know\u2014is sitting in her kitchen, crying, tearing her heart out imagining every pain, every violation that Ilona could\u2019ve suffered. She\u2019s always been too quick to grieve.\nShe left the door unlocked, and I find her in the kitchen, her shoulders heaving.\n\u201cPetra.\u201d\nShe flings herself into my arms, with a fierceness of one who missed comfort.\nI stroke her hair, dyed deep auburn. \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s not that bad. When did she disappear?\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t come home from school.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s with some friends.\u201d Even I know it\u2019s a lie; another teenager might run off, but not dutiful Ilona, who took it on her thin shoulders to be the link between me and her mother, the only one who was young enough to not be burdened by old hurts.\nPetra doesn\u2019t even bother to argue. \u201cI called the police, and they said they\u2019ll look into it. They don\u2019t return my calls.\u201d\nThis is bad. \u201cI\u2019ll call Jeremy,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBlow your nose and make me some tea.\u201d\nShe nods, and fusses with the kettle. If she were younger, she would\u2019ve blamed me for everything.\nI call Jeremy. He\u2019s a cop and a good friend, and Petra hates him. But not today.\n\u201cI need a favor,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMy granddaughter\u2019s missing.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cCan\u2019t help you,\u201d he says, and lowers his voice. \u201cThis is Federal jurisdiction.\u201d\n\u201cBLIPs?\u201d I see Petra flinch, and lower my voice. \u201cWhat did the kid do?\u201d\n\u201cDownloading and distribution of copyrighted materials.\u201d\nI think of the pictures in my plane. Vegetable sheep, so harmless. Who would\u2019ve thought that the Bureau of Licensing and Intellectual Property would be interested in a sixteen-year-old kid? Unless she already has a record.\n\u201cWe made the arrest, but the BLIPs took her off our hands quickly.\u201d\nI hang up, and look at Petra. She looks back, guilt shining through her tears like stars. I warned you, didn\u2019t I?\nI get a hold of Maria. She is a high school friend, and thus our relationship combines a gradual distancing with an exaggerated sense of obligation. But even she cannot help me.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispers into the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything. The computer on which download has occurred has been tapped for a while. We were just waiting for something serious enough to occur.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d she hisses. \u201cSorry, got to go.\u201d\nPetra is fiddling with her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d\nNo point in arguing\u2014we both know she is right, but I\u2019m not going to gloat. It was hard enough for me to lose her to the misguided rebellion that offered no action and no escape. She was only fourteen when the entertainment conglomerates first ran for presidency, and eighteen when they won. She still remembers when the information was not screened or regulated by the government, when there was no such thing as a govnet. Ilona doesn\u2019t.\nPetra was not the one to ignore it, but she was not a fighter. Her anger manifested in small acts of disobedience, which gave little consolation and even less meaning. One can talk shit about the government all one wants, but in the end is trapped worse than those who are oblivious.\n\u201cBut what was I supposed to do?\u201d Her voice gains a cracked quality. \u201cMy own mother was working for them.\u201d\nSo your daughter pays for the sins of your mother. Only you are untouched. \u201cWhat exactly did you do?\u201d\nPetra tells me that she had her computer hacked, connected to the other net, not the govnet. She used it to read the news; she never knew that Ilona had any interest in using it, but didn\u2019t make much of an effort to hide it, or to explain to her daughter the intricacies of the Declaration of Copyright. Of course the kid is going to see a picture and print it, never realizing that that constitutes intent to distribute, jail time mandatory. She had no way of knowing that everything is copyrighted in perpetuity, regardless of where it appears. Free net or not, it\u2019s BLIP jurisdiction.\nI drink the lukewarm tea as Petra cries and talks, cries and talks. Her sobs and babbling create a soothing rhythm, and it is easier to think to it. I think of the Federal penitentiaries in the area, and I think of how many of them I have flown above. No reason not to do it again.\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I tell Petra, \u201cI\u2019m going to do some reconnaissance flying.\u201d\nShe stops sobbing. \u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous?\u201d Her eyes glitter, anxious. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you too.\u201d\nYou threw me away years ago. What other loss are you afraid of? \u201cIt\u2019s a government plane, baby, remember?\u201d\n\u201cThey let you fly anywhere you want?\u201d\n\u201cAs long as there are clouds.\u201d\nShe stares at me, and I tell her of warm dry winters when clouds are hard to find, and there\u2019s not enough moisture in the air to make them. I tell her of the quilt of the fallow fields and the green silk of the ocean, its foamy crests like tiny clouds. Of the tedious azure of the sky and the thrill of the hunt as I spot a white wisp of a nascent cloud, still unsure whether to come into being, its transparency both a promise and a threat. I chase them across the sky, over land and over sea, and whatever lies beneath is not my concern.\nI let the clouds lead me. It is neither faith nor superstition, but a voice of experience\u2014as long as I follow the white fluffy shapes, they will lead me where I need to be. It may be a roundabout way, blown by winds and air currents, convection and condensation, but we will get there in the end.\nI follow them, but for the first time I let them be. My plane swoops down, closer and closer to the bejeweled patchwork of the ground, until I can discern tall grey cement and low greenery, and almost lose my way in the vapor rising from the oversaturated ground. I rise again to safety, but descend again, circling, looking. I disconnect the communication system and turn the scopes to the ground, and search it.\nI watch the yards of the penitentiaries, and I look for women. At the Austin Federal Penitentiary, I find a group of young girls, in identical orange jumpsuits, as they circle aimlessly through a grey cement yard, and I look for the familiar face. It is hard to see in the grey rain, even with the scope, until one of them tilts her head upwards and smiles.\nA day passes like that, and another one. It\u2019s raining fine without me, leaving me free to look like a hawk. On the third day, I am denied entrance to the airfield.\nI think of making a dash\u2014the guard would never catch up with me. Instead, I ask why, even though I know the answer. The security guard looks at me with pity in his eyes, and it belies the banality of his words\u2014subversive element in the family, security risk, retirement age. They don\u2019t even bother to pick one excuse; they lump them all together, without an appearance of respect.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says in the end. \u201cShe was a real pretty girl.\u201d\nI lean closer to the plastic of his booth, and he doesn\u2019t flinch away. \u201cListen, Thomas,\u201d I say. \u201cI left some personal belongings in the cockpit. Think I can run in real quick and get them?\u201d And add, to ease possible suspicion, \u201cOr you can get them for me.\u201d\nHe sighs and shifts in his narrow stool, his bulk sloshing from one side to the other. He peers at the grey rain, coming down in glassy sheets. \u201cYou go right ahead,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d\nI have no intention to. I cross the airfield in a quick walk, my boots sliding on the wet grass. Other pilots pay me no mind\u2014they never do; I am too old to be looked at with any comfort. They don\u2019t seem alarmed when I grab the prop and pull it, desperation tripling the weight of my frail body. The engine starts, its metal heart beating in a faster rhythm than mine, and the plane glides down the field. I catch up to it in a run and vault into the cabin, just as I hear someone call out, \u201cHey!\u201d\nThe air is wet in my face, until I slam the door shut, and we\u2019re off, spiraling, ascending on the warm currents, the clouds moving down to greet us, like sheep greeting their shepherd. I look at the clock\u20148 am. I have an hour to get there. I need forty-five minutes.\nThe girls are in the yard again. It is raining hard, and they wear yellow slickers, the hoods obscuring their faces. There are two female guards, watching from the cover of the tall wire fence; there are probably others.\nOne of the yellow hoods tilts back, and I see a pale face and dark hair, a small mouth opened in hope and wonder. She is the only one left standing as my plane drops into the yard, like a bird of prey. I land by the fence, and hope that the yard is long enough to stop.\nThere are gunshots, and the white panicked faces of the guards through the windshield. I turn the dust cannons on full blast, and they are lost in the grey cloud of searing particles. A small fist pounds on the door, and I swing it open. Ilona clambers into the seat next to me and the plane turns around. There\u2019s not enough space for a proper takeoff and I gun it, taking off the top of the fence.\nIlona gasps next to me, and then regains her usual composure. \u201cDid you like my pictures?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Thank you very much.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you would.\u201d\nI point at the approaching tight cluster of white clouds, and my granddaughter laughs. \u201cJust like in the pictures.\u201d\nI aim the plane into the center of it, and cut the engine. We fall, weightless, surrounded by the celestial vegetable sheep. One of them takes us into its soft arms and smiles, cradling the plane.\nThe engines rev back to life, and Ilona lets out a long sigh. \u201cI could fall like this forever.\u201d\nI nod. She is strong and she will learn to fly.\nEkaterina Sedia resides in the Pinelands of New Jersey.

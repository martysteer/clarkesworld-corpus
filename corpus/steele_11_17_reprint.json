People coming here for the first time often don\u2019t realize just how thin the air really is. The cold surprises them, too, but I\u2019m told the atmospheric pressure is about the same as you\u2019d find in the Himalayas. So they come trooping down the ramp of the shuttle that transported them from Deimos Station, and if the ride down didn\u2019t make them puke, then the shortness of breath, headaches, and nausea that comes with altitude sickness will.\n I didn\u2019t know for sure that the middle-aged gent who\u2019d doubled over and vomited was Dr. al-Baz, but I suspected that he was; I hadn\u2019t seen any other Middle Eastern men on his flight. There was nothing I could do for him, though, so I waited patiently on the other side of the chain-link security fence while one of the flight attendants came down the ramp to help him. Dr. al-Baz waved her away; he didn\u2019t need any assistance, thank you. He straightened up, pulled a handkerchief from his overcoat pocket, and wiped his mouth, then picked up the handle of the rolling bag he\u2019d dropped when his stomach revolted. Nice to know that he wasn\u2019t entirely helpless.\n He was one of the last passengers to step through the gate. He paused on the other side of the fence, looked around, and spotted the cardboard sign I was holding. A brief smile of relief, then he walked over to me.\n \u201cI\u2019m Omar al-Baz,\u201d he said, holding out his hand. \u201cYou must be Mr. Ramsey.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I\u2019m your guide. Call me Jim.\u201d Not wanting to shake a hand that just wiped a mouth which had just spilled yuck all over nice clean concrete, I reached forward to relieve him of his bag.\n \u201cI can carry this myself, thank you,\u201d he said, not letting me take his bag from him. \u201cBut if you could help me with the rest of my luggage, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d\n \u201cSure. No problem.\u201d He hadn\u2019t hired me to be his porter, and if he\u2019d been the jerk variety of tourist some of my former clients had been, I would\u2019ve made him carry his own stuff. But I was already beginning to like the guy: early 50\u2019s, skinny but with the beginnings of a pot belly, coarse black hair going gray at the temples. He wore round spectacles and had a bushy mustache beneath a hooked aquiline nose, and looked a little like an Arab Groucho Marx. Omar al-Baz couldn\u2019t have been anything but what he was, an Egyptian-American professor from the University of Arizona.\n I led him toward the terminal, stepping around the tourists and business travelers who had also disembarked from the 3pm shuttle. \u201cAre you by yourself, or did someone come with you?\u201d\n \u201cUnfortunately, I come alone. The university provided grant money sufficient for only one fare, even though I requested that I bring a grad student as an assistant.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThis may hinder my work, but I hope that what I intend to do will be simple enough that I may accomplish it on my own.\u201d\n I had only the vaguest idea of why he\u2019d hired me to be his guide, but the noise and bustle of the terminal was too much for a conversation. Passenger bags were beginning to come down the conveyor belt, but Dr. al-Baz didn\u2019t join the crowd waiting to pick up suitcases and duffel bags. Instead, he went straight to the PanMars cargo window, where he presented a handful of receipts to the clerk. I began to regret my offer to help carry his bags when a cart was pushed through a side door. Stacked upon it were a half-dozen aluminum cases; even in Martian gravity, none small enough to be carried two at a time.\n \u201cYou gotta be kidding,\u201d I murmured.\n \u201cMy apologies, but for the work I need to do, I had to bring specialized equipment.\u201d He signed a form, then turned to me again. \u201cNow . . . do you have a means of taking all this to my hotel, or will I have to get a cab?\u201d\n I looked over the stack of cases and decided that there weren\u2019t so many that I couldn\u2019t fit them all in the back of my jeep. So we pushed the cart out to where I\u2019d parked beside the front entrance, and managed to get everything tied down with elastic cords I carried with me. Dr. al-Baz climbed into the passenger seat and put his suitcase on the floor between his feet.\n \u201cHotel first?\u201d I asked as I took my place behind the wheel.\n \u201cYes, please . . . and then I wouldn\u2019t mind getting a drink.\u201d He caught the questioning look in my eye and gave me a knowing smile. \u201cNo, I am not a devout follower of the Prophet.\u201d\n \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d I was liking him better all the time; I don\u2019t trust people who won\u2019t have a beer with me. I started up the jeep and pulled away from the curb. \u201cSo . . . you said in your email you\u2019d like to visit an aboriginal settlement. Is that still what you want to do?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I do.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cBut now that we\u2019ve met, I think it\u2019s only fair to tell you that this is not all that I mean to do. The trip here involves more than just meeting the natives.\u201d\n \u201cHow so? What else do you want?\u201d\n He peered at me over the top of his glasses. \u201cThe blood of a Martian.\u201d\n When I was a kid, one of my favorite movies was The War of the Worlds\u2014the 1953 version, made about twelve years before the first probes went to Mars. Even back then, people knew that Mars had an Earthlike environment; spectroscopes had revealed the presence of an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, and strong telescopes made visible the seas and canals. But no one knew for sure whether the planet was inhabited until Ares I landed there in 1977, so George Pal had a lot of latitude when he and his film crew tried to imagine what a Martian would look like.\n Anyway, there\u2019s a scene in the movie where Gene Barry and Ann Robinson have made their way to LA after escaping the collapsed farmhouse where they\u2019d been pinned down by the alien invaders. Barry meets with his fellow scientists at Pacific Tech and presents them with a ruined camera-eye he managed to grab while fighting off the attackers. The camera-eye is wrapped in Ann Robinson\u2019s scarf, which was splattered with gore when Gene clobbered a little green monster with a broken pipe.\n \u201cAnd this\u2014\u201d he says melodramatically, showing the scarf to the other scientists \u201c\u2014blood of a Martian!\u201d\n I\u2019ve always loved that part. So when Dr. al-Baz said much the same thing, I wondered if he was being clever, copping a line from a classic movie that he figured most colonists might have seen. But there was no wink, no ironic smile. So far as I could tell, he was as serious as he could be.\n I decided to let it wait until we had that drink together, so I held my tongue as I drove him into Rio Zephyria. The professor\u2019s reservation was at the John Carter Casino Resort, located on the strip near the Mare Cimmerium beach. No surprise there: it\u2019s the most famous hotel in Rio, so most tourists try to book rooms there. Edgar Rice Burroughs was having a literary renaissance around the time it was built, so someone decided that A Princess of Mars and its sequels would be a great theme for a casino. Since then it\u2019s become the place most people think of when they daydream about taking a vacation trip to Mars.\n Good for them, but I want to throw a rock through its gold-tinted windows every time I drive by. It\u2019s a 10-story monument to every stupid thing humans have done since coming here. And if I feel that way, as someone who was born and raised on Mars, then you can well imagine what the shatan think of it . . . when they come close enough to see it, that is.\n It was hard to gauge Dr. al-Baz\u2019s reaction when we pulled up in front of the hotel lobby. I was beginning to learn that his normal expression was stoical. But as a bellhop was unloading his stuff and putting it on a cart, the professor spotted the casino entrance. The doorman was dark-skinned and a little more than two meters in height; he wore the burnoose robes of an aborigine, with a saber in the scabbard on his belt.\n Dr. al-Baz stared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not a Martian, is he?\u201d\n \u201cNot unless he used to play center for the Blue Devils.\u201d Dr. al-Baz raised an eyebrow and I smiled \u201cThat\u2019s Tito Jones, star of the Duke basketball team . . . or at least until he came here.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cPoor guy. He didn\u2019t know why the casino hired him to be their celebrity greeter until they put him in that outfit.\u201d\n Dr. al-Baz had already lost interest. \u201cI was hoping he might be a Martian,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt would have made things easier.\u201d\n \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be caught dead here . . . or anywhere near the colonies, for that matter.\u201d I turned to follow the bellhop through the revolving door. \u201cAnd by the way . . . we don\u2019t call them \u2018Martians.\u2019 \u2018Aborigines\u2019 is the preferred term.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. And what do the Mar . . . the aborigines call themselves?\u201d\n \u201cThey call themselves shatan . . . which means \u2018people\u2019 in their language.\u201d Before he could ask the obvious next question, I added, \u201cTheir word for us is nashatan, or \u2018not-people,\u2019 but that\u2019s only when they\u2019re being polite. They call us a lot of things, most of them pretty nasty.\u201d\n The professor nodded and was quiet for a little while.\n The University of Arizona might not have sprung for a grad student\u2019s marsliner ticket, but they made up for it by reserving a two-room suite. After the bellhop unloaded his cart and left, Dr. al-Baz explained that he\u2019d need the main room, a large parlor complete with a bar, for the temporary lab he intended to set up. He didn\u2019t unpack right away, though; he was ready for that drink I\u2019d promised him. So we left everything in the room and caught the elevator back downstairs.\n The hotel bar is located in the casino, but I didn\u2019t want to drink in a place where the bartender is decked out like a Barsoomian warlord and the waitresses are dolled up as princesses of Helium. The John Carter is the only place on Mars where anyone looks like that; no one in their right mind would wear so few clothes outside, not even in the middle of summer. So we returned to the jeep and I got away from the strip, heading into the old part of town that the tourists seldom visit.\n There\u2019s a good watering hole about three blocks from my apartment. It was still late afternoon, so the place wasn\u2019t crowded yet. The bar was quiet and dark, perfect for conversation. The owner knew me; he brought over a pitcher of ale as soon as the professor and I sat down at a table in the back.\n \u201cTake it easy with this,\u201d I told Dr. al-Baz as I poured beer into a tallneck and pushed it across the table to him. \u201cUntil you get acclimated, it might hit you pretty hard.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll take your advice.\u201d The professor took a tentative sip and smiled. \u201cGood. Better than I was expecting, in fact. Local?\u201d\n \u201cHellas City Amber. You think we\u2019d have beer shipped all the way from Earth?\u201d There were more important things we needed to discuss, so I changed the subject. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about wanting blood? When you got in touch with me, all you said was that you wanted me to take you to an aboriginal settlement.\u201d\n Dr. al-Baz didn\u2019t say anything for a moment or so. He toyed with the stem of his glass, rolling it back and forth between his fingers. \u201cIf I\u2019d told you the entire truth,\u201d he finally admitted, \u201cI was afraid you might not agree to take me. And you come very highly recommended. As I understand, you\u2019re not only native-born, but your parents were among the first settlers.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m surprised you know that. You must have talked to a former client.\u201d\n \u201cDo you remember Ian Horner? Anthropologist from Cambridge University?\u201d I did indeed, although not kindly; Dr. Horner had hired me to be his guide, but if you\u2019d believed everything he said, he knew more about Mars than I did. I nodded, keeping my opinion to myself. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d Dr. al-Baz continued, \u201cor at least someone with whom I\u2019ve been in contact on a professional basis.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019re another anthropologist.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d He sipped his beer. \u201cResearch biologist . . . astrobiology, to be exact. The study of extraterrestrial forms of life. Until now, most of my work has involved studying Venus, so this is the first time I\u2019ve been to Mars. Of course, Venus is different. Its global ocean is quite interesting, but . . .\u201d\n \u201cProfessor, I don\u2019t want to be rude, but do you want to get down to it and tell me why you want the blood of a\u2014\u201d damn, he almost got me to say it! \u201c\u2014an aborigine?\u201d\n Sitting back in his chair, Dr. al-Baz folded his hands together on the tabletop. \u201cMr. Ramsey . . . \u201d\n \u201cJim.\u201d\n \u201cJim, are you familiar with the panspermia hypothesis? The idea that life on Earth may have extraterrestrial origins, that it may have come from somewhere in outer space?\u201d\n \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never heard that . . . but I guess that when you say \u2018somewhere,\u2019 you mean here.\u201d\n \u201cThat is correct. I mean Mars.\u201d He tapped a finger firmly against the table. \u201cHave you ever wondered why there\u2019s such a close resemblance between humans and Martian aborigines? Why the two races look so much alike, even though they\u2019re from worlds over 70 million kilometers apart?\u201d\n \u201cParallel evolution.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I expect that\u2019s what you\u2019ve learned in school. The conventional explanation is that, because both planets have similar environments, evolution took approximately the same course on both worlds, the differences being that Martians . . . aborigines, sorry . . . are taller because of lower surface gravity, have higher metabolisms because of colder temperature, have significantly darker skin because of the thinner ozone layer, so forth and so on. This has been the prevalent theory because it\u2019s the only one that seems to fit the facts.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard, yeah.\u201d\n \u201cWell, my friend, everything you\u2019ve known is wrong.\u201d He immediately shook his head, as if embarrassed by his momentary burst of arrogance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to sound overbearing. However, several of my colleagues and I believe that the similarities between homo sapiens and homo aresian cannot be attributed to evolution alone. We think there may be a genetic link between the two races, that life on Earth . . . human life in particular . . . may have originated on Mars.\u201d\n Dr. al-Baz paused, allowing a moment to let his words sink in. They did, all right; I was beginning to wonder if he was a kook. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, trying not to smile, \u201cI\u2019ll bite. What leads you to think that?\u201d\n The professor raised a finger. \u201cFirst, the geological composition of quite a few meteorites found on Earth is identical to those of rock samples brought from Mars. So there\u2019s a theory that, sometime in the distant past, there was a cataclysmic explosion on the Martian surface . . . possibly the eruption of Mt. Daedalia or one of the other volcanoes in the Albus range . . . which ejected debris into space. This debris traveled as meteors to Earth, which was also in its infancy. Those meteors may have contained organic molecules which seeded Earth with life where it hadn\u2019t previously existed.\u201d\n He held up another finger. \u201cSecond . . . when the human genome was sequenced, one of the most surprising finds was the existence of DNA strands which have no apparent purpose. They\u2019re like parts of a machine that don\u2019t have any function. There\u2019s no reason for them to be there, yet nonetheless they are. Therefore, is it possible that these phantom strands may be genetic biomarkers left behind by organic material brought to Earth from Mars?\u201d\n \u201cSo that\u2019s why you want a blood sample? To see if there\u2019s a link?\u201d\n He nodded. \u201cI have brought equipment that will enable me to sequence, at least partially, the genetic code of an aborigine blood sample and compare it to that of a human. If the native genome has non-functional archaic strands that match the ones found in the human genome, then we\u2019ll have evidence that the hypothesis is correct . . . life on Earth originated on Mars, and the two races are genetically linked.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds. Dr. al-Baz didn\u2019t sound quite as crazy as he had a couple of minutes earlier. As far-fetched as it may seem, what he said made sense. And if the hypothesis were true, then the implications were staggering: the shatan were close cousins to the inhabitants of Earth, not simply a primitive race that we\u2019d happened to find when we came to Mars.\n Not that I was ready to believe it. I\u2019d met too many shatan to ever be willing to accept the idea that they had anything in common with my people. Or at least so I thought . . .\n \u201cOkay, I get what you\u2019re doing.\u201d I picked up my glass and took a long drink. \u201cBut let me tell you, getting that blood sample won\u2019t be easy.\u201d\n \u201cI know. I understand the aborigines are rather reclusive . . . \u201d\n \u201cNow that\u2019s an understatement.\u201d I put down my glass again. \u201cThey\u2019ve never wanted much to do with us. The Ares 1 expedition had been here for almost three weeks before anyone caught sight of them, and another month before there was any significant contact. It took years for us to even learn their language, and things only got worse when we started establishing colonies. Wherever we\u2019ve gone, the shatan have moved out, packing up everything they owned, even burning their villages so that we couldn\u2019t explore their dwellings. They\u2019ve become nomads since then. No trade, and not much in the way of cultural exchange . . . \u201d\n \u201cSo no one has ever managed to get anything from them on which they may have left organic material? No hair samples, no saliva, no skin?\u201d\n \u201cNo. They\u2019ve never allowed us to collect any artifacts from them, and they\u2019re reluctant to even let us touch them. That outfit you saw Tito Jones wearing? It\u2019s not the real thing . . . just a costume based on some pictures someone took of them.\u201d\n \u201cBut we\u2019ve learned their language.\u201d\n \u201cJust a little of one of their dialects . . . pidgin shatan, you might call it.\u201d I absently ran a finger around the rim of my glass. \u201cIf you\u2019re counting on me to be your native interpreter . . . well, don\u2019t expect much. I know enough to get by and that\u2019s about it. I may be able to keep them from chucking a spear at us, but that\u2019s all.\u201d\n He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre they dangerous?\u201d\n \u201cNot so long as you mind your manners. They can be . . . well, kinda aggressive . . . if you cross the line with them.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell him some of the worst stories\u2014I\u2019d scared off other clients that way\u2014so I tried to reassure him. \u201cI\u2019ve met some of the local tribesmen, so they know me well enough to let me visit their lands. But I\u2019m not sure how much they trust me.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cDr. Horner didn\u2019t get very far with them. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s told you that they wouldn\u2019t let him into their village.\u201d\n \u201cYes, he has. To tell the truth, though, Ian has always been something of an ass\u2014\u201d I laughed out loud when he said this, and he gave me a quick smile in return \u201c\u2014so I imagine that, so long as I approach them with a measure of humility, I may have more success than he did.\u201d\n \u201cYou might.\u201d Ian Horner had come to Mars with the attitude of a British army officer visiting colonial India, a condescending air of superiority that the shatan picked up almost immediately. He learned little as a result, and had come away referring to the \u201cabos\u201d as \u201ccheeky bahstahds.\u201d No doubt the aborigines felt much the same way about him . . . but at least they\u2019d let him live.\n \u201cSo you\u2019ll take me out there? To one of their villages, I mean?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s why you hired me, so . . . yeah, sure.\u201d I picked up my beer again. \u201cThe nearest village is about a hundred and fifty kilometers southeast of here, in a desert oasis near the Laestrygon canal. It\u2019ll take a couple of days to get there. I hope you brought warm clothes and hiking boots.\u201d\n \u201cI brought a parka and boots, yes. But you have your jeep, don\u2019t you? Then why are we going to need to walk?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll drive only until we get near the village. Then we\u2019ll have to get out and walk the rest of the way. The shatan don\u2019t like motorized vehicles. The equatorial desert is pretty rough, so you better prepare for it.\u201d\n He smiled. \u201cI ask you . . . do I look like someone who\u2019s never been in a desert?\u201d\n \u201cNo . . . but Mars isn\u2019t Earth.\u201d\n I spent the next day preparing for the trip: collecting camping equipment from my rented storage shed, buying food, and filling water bottles, putting fresh fuel cells in the jeep and making sure the tires had enough pressure. I made sure that Dr. al-Baz had the right clothing for several days in the outback and gave him the address of a local outfitter if he didn\u2019t, but I need not have worried; he clearly wasn\u2019t one of those tourists foolish enough to go out into the desert wearing Bermuda shorts and sandals.\n When I came to pick him up at the hotel, I was amazed to find that the professor had turned his suite into a laboratory. Two flat-screen computers were set up on the bar, a microscope and a test-tube rack stood on the coffee table, and the TV had been pushed aside to make room for a small centrifuge. More equipment rested on bureaus and side tables; I didn\u2019t know what any of it was, but I spotted a radiation symbol on one and a Warning - Laser sticker on another. He\u2019d covered the carpet with plastic sheets, and there was even a lab coat hanging in the closet. Dr. al-Baz made no mention of any of this; he simply picked up his backpack and camera, put on a slouch cap, and followed me out the door, pausing to slip the Do Not Disturb sign over the knob.\n Tourists stared at us as he flung his pack into the back of my jeep; it always seemed to surprise some people that anyone would come to Mars to do something besides drink and lose money at the gaming tables. I started up the jeep and we roared away from the John Carter, and in fifteen minutes we were on the outskirts of town, driving through the irrigated farmlands surrounding Rio Zephyria. The scarlet pines that line the shores of Mare Cimmerium gradually thinned out as we followed dirt roads usually traveled by farm vehicles and logging trucks, and even those disappeared as we left the colony behind and headed into the trackless desert.\n I\u2019ve been told that the Martian drylands look a lot like the American southwest, except that everything is red. I\u2019ve never been to Earth, so I wouldn\u2019t know, but if anyone in New Mexico happens to spot a six-legged creature that looks sort of like a shaggy cow or a raptor that resembles a pterodactyl and sounds like a hyena, please drop me a line. And stay away from those pits that look a little like golf course sand-traps; there\u2019s something lurking within them that would eat you alive, one limb at a time.\n As the jeep weaved its way through the desert, dodging boulders and bouncing over small rocks, Dr. al-Baz clung to the roll bars, fascinated by the wilderness opening before us. This was one of the things that made my job worthwhile, seeing familiar places through the eyes of someone who\u2019d never been there before. I pointed out a Martian hare as it loped away from us, and stopped for a second to let him take pictures of a flock of stakhas as they wheeled high above us, shrieking their dismay at our intrusion.\n About seventy kilometers southeast of Rio, we came upon the Laestrygon canal, running almost due south from the sea. When Percival Lowell first spotted the Martian canals through his observatory telescope, he thought they were excavated waterways. He was half-right; the shatan had rerouted existing rivers, diverting them so that they\u2019d go where the aborigines wanted. The fact that they\u2019d done this with the simple, muscle-driven machines never failed to amaze anyone who saw them, but Earth people tend to underestimate the shatan. They\u2019re primitive, but not stupid.\n We followed the canal, keeping far away from it so that we couldn\u2019t be easily spotted from the decks of any shatan boats that might be this far north. I didn\u2019t want any aborigines to see us before we reached the village; they might pass the word that humans were coming, and give their chieftain a chance to order his people to pack up and move out. We saw no one, though; the only sign of habitation was a skinny wooden suspension bridge than spanned the channel like an enormous bow, and even that didn\u2019t appear to be frequently used.\n By late afternoon, we\u2019d entered hill country. Flat-topped mesas rose around us, with massive stone pinnacles jutting upward between them; the jagged peaks of distant mountains lay just beyond the horizon. I drove until it was nearly dusk, then pulled up behind a hoodoo and stopped for the night.\n Dr. al-Baz pitched a tent while I collected dead scrub brush. Once I had a fire going, I suspended a cookpot above the embers, then emptied a can of stew into it. The professor had thought to buy a couple of bottles of red wine before we left town; we opened one for dinner and worked our way through it after we ate.\n \u201cSo tell me something,\u201d Dr. al-Baz said once we\u2019d scrubbed down the pot, plates, and spoons. \u201cWhy did you become a guide?\u201d\n \u201cYou mean, other than getting a job as a blackjack dealer?\u201d I propped the cookware up against a boulder. A stiff breeze was coming out of the west; the sand it carried would scour away the remaining grub. \u201cNever really thought about it, to be honest. My folks are first-generation settlers, so I was born and raised here. I started prowling the desert as soon as I was old enough to go out alone, so . . . \u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s just it.\u201d The professor moved a little closer to the fire, holding out his hands to warm them. Now that the sun was down, a cold night was ahead; we could already see our breath by the firelight. \u201cMost of the colonists I\u2019ve met seem content to stay in the city. When I told them that I was planning a trip into the desert, they all looked at me like I was mad. Someone even suggested that I buy a gun and take out extra life insurance.\u201d\n \u201cWhoever told you to buy a gun doesn\u2019t know a thing about the shatan. They never attack unless provoked, and the surest way to upset them is to approach one of their villages with a gun.\u201d I patted the utility knife on my belt. \u201cThis is the closest I come to carrying a weapon when there\u2019s even a possibility that I might run into aborigines. One reason why I\u2019m on good terms with them . . . I mind my manners.\u201d\n \u201cMost people here haven\u2019t even seen an aborigine, I think.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right, they haven\u2019t. Rio Zephyria is the biggest colony because of tourism, but most permanent residents prefer to live where there\u2019s flush toilets and cable TV.\u201d I sat down on the other side of the fire. \u201cThey can have it. The only reason I live there is because that\u2019s where the tourists are. If it wasn\u2019t for that, I\u2019d have a place out in the boonies and hit town only when I need to stock up on supplies.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d Dr. al-Baz picked up his tin cup and mine and poured some wine into each. \u201cForgive me if I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he said as he handed my cup to me, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t sound as if you very much approve of your fellow colonists.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I took a sip and put the cup down beside me; I didn\u2019t want to get a headful of wine the night before I was going to have to deal with shatan tribesmen. \u201cMy folks came out here to explore a new world, but everyone who\u2019s come after those original settlers . . . well, you saw Rio. You know what it\u2019s like. We\u2019re building hotels and casinos and shopping centers, and introducing invasive species into our farms and dumping our sewage into the channels, and every few weeks during conjunction another ship brings in more people who think Mars is like Las Vegas only without as many hookers . . . not that we don\u2019t have plenty of those, too.\u201d\n As I spoke, I craned my neck to look up the night sky. The major constellations gleamed brightly: Ursa Major, Draco, Cygnus, with Denes as the north star. You can\u2019t see the Milky Way very well in the city; you have to go out into the desert to get a decent view of the Martian night sky. \u201cSo who can blame the shatan for not wanting to have anything to do with us? They knew the score as soon as we showed up.\u201d Recalling a thought I\u2019d had the day before, I chuckled to myself. \u201cThe old movies got it wrong. Mars didn\u2019t invade Earth . . . Earth invaded Mars.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t realize there was so much resentment on your part.\u201d\n He sounded like his feelings were wounded. That was no way to treat a paying customer.\n \u201cNo, no . . . it\u2019s not you,\u201d I quickly added. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be caught dead at a poker table.\u201d\n He laughed out loud. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think the university would look very kindly upon me if my expense report included poker chips.\u201d\n \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d I hesitated, then went on. \u201cJust do me a favor, will you? If you find something here that might . . . I dunno . . . make things worse, would you consider keeping it to yourself? Humans have done enough stupid things here already. We don\u2019t need to do anything more.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that,\u201d Dr. al-Baz said.\n The next day, we found the shatan. Or rather, they found us.\n We broke camp and continued following the Laestrygon as it flowed south through the desert hills. I\u2019d been watching the jeep\u2019s odometer the entire trip, and when we were about fifty kilometers from where I remembered the aborigine settlement being, I began driving along the canal banks. I told Dr. al-Baz to keep a sharp eye out for any signs of habitation\u2014trails, or perhaps abandoned camps left behind by hunting parties\u2014but what we found was a lot more obvious: another suspension bridge, and passing beneath it, a shatan boat.\n The canal boat was a slender catamaran about ten meters long, with broad white sails catching the desert wind and a small cabin at its stern. The figures moving along its decks didn\u2019t notice us until one of them spotted the jeep. He let out a warbling cry\u2014\u201cwallawallawalla!\u201d\u2014and the others stopped what they were doing to gaze in the direction he was pointing. Then another shatan standing atop the cabin yelled something and everyone turned to dash into the cabin, with their captain disappearing through a hatch in its ceiling. Within seconds, the catamaran became a ghost ship.\n \u201cWow.\u201d Dr. al-Baz was both astounded and disappointed. \u201cThey really don\u2019t want to see us, do they?\u201d\n \u201cActually, they don\u2019t want us to see them.\u201d He looked at me askance, not understanding the difference. \u201cThey believe that, if they can\u2019t be seen, then they\u2019ve disappeared from the world. This way, they\u2019re hoping that, so far as we\u2019re concerned, they\u2019ve ceased to exist.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cKind of logical, if you think about it.\u201d\n There was no point in trying to persuade the crew to emerge from hiding, so we left the boat behind and continued our drive down the canal bank. But the catamaran had barely disappeared from sight when we heard a hollow roar from behind us, like a bullhorn being blown. The sound echoed off the nearby mesas; two more prolonged blasts, then the horn went silent.\n \u201cIf there are any more shatan around, they\u2019ll hear that and know we\u2019re coming,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ll repeat the same signal with their own horns, and so on, until the signal reaches the village.\u201d\n \u201cSo they know we\u2019re here,\u201d Dr. al-Baz said. \u201cWill they hide like the others?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe. Maybe not.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them.\u201d\n For a long time, we didn\u2019t spot anyone or anything. We were about eight kilometers from the village when we came upon another bridge. This time, we saw two figures standing near the foot of the bridge. They appeared unusually tall even for aborigines, but it wasn\u2019t until we got closer that we saw why: each of them rode a hattas, enormous buffalo-like creatures with six legs and elongated necks that the natives tamed as pack animals. It wasn\u2019t what they were riding that caught my attention, though, so much as the long spears they carried, or the heavy animal-hide outfits they wore.\n \u201cUh-oh,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s not good?\u201d\n \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d run into hunters . . . but these guys are warriors. They can be a little . . . um, intense. Keep your hands in sight and never look away from them.\u201d\n I halted the jeep about twenty feet from them. We climbed out and slowly walked toward them, hands at our sides. As we got closer, the warriors dismounted from their animals; they didn\u2019t approach us, though, but instead waited in silence.\n When the owners of the John Carter hired a basketball star to masquerade as a shatan, they were trying to find someone who might pass as a Martian aborigine. Tito Jones was the best they could get, but he wasn\u2019t quite right. The shatan standing before us were taller; their skin was as dark as the sky at midnight, their long, silky hair the color of rust, yet their faces had fine-boned features reminiscent of someone of northern European descent. They were swathed in dusty, off-white robes that made them look vaguely Bedouin, and the hands that gripped their spears were larger than a human\u2019s, with long-nailed fingers and tendons which stood out from wrists.\n Unblinking golden eyes studied us as we approached. When we\u2019d come close enough, both warriors firmly planted their spears on the ground before us. I told Dr. al-Baz to stop, but I didn\u2019t have to remind him not to look away from them. He stared at the shatan with awestruck curiosity, a scientist observing his subject up close for the first time.\n I raised both hands before me, palm out, and said, \u201cIssah tas sobbata shatan\u201d (Greetings, honored shatan warriors). \u201cSeyta nasahtan habbalah sa shatan heysa\u201d (Please allow us human travelers to enter your land).\n The warrior on the left replied, \u201cKatas nashatan Hamsey. Sakey shatan habbalah fah?\u201d (We know you, human Ramsey. Why have you returned to our land?)\n I wasn\u2019t surprised to have been recognized. Only a handful of humans spoke their language\u2014albeit not very well; I probably sounded like a child to them\u2014or knew the way to their village. I may not have met these particular warriors before, but they\u2019d doubtless heard of me. And I tried not to smile at the mispronunciation of my name; the shatan have trouble rolling the \u201cr\u201d sound off their tongues.\n \u201c(I\u2019ve brought a guest who wishes to learn more about your people),\u201d I replied, still speaking the local dialect. I extended a hand toward the professor. \u201c(Allow me to introduce you to Omar al-Baz. He is a wise man in search of knowledge.)\u201d I avoided calling him \u201cdoctor\u201d; that word has a specific meaning in their language, as someone who practices medicine.\n \u201c(Humans don\u2019t want to know anything about us. All they want to do is take what doesn\u2019t belong to them and ruin it.)\u201d\n I shook my head; oddly, that particular gesture means the same thing for both shatan and nashatan. \u201c(This is not true. Many of my people do, yes, but not all. On his own world, al-Baz is a teacher. Whatever he learns from you, he will tell us students, and therefore increase their knowledge of your people.)\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Dr. al-Baz whispered. \u201cI recognize my name, but . . . \u201d\n \u201cHush. Let me finish.\u201d I continued speaking the native tongue. \u201c(Will you please escort us to your village? My companion wishes to beg a favor of your chieftain.)\u201d\n The other warrior stepped forward, walking toward the professor until he stood directly before him. The shatan towered above Dr. al-Baz; everything about him was menacing, yet the professor held his ground, saying nothing but continuing to look straight in the eye. The warrior silently regarded him for several long moments, then looked at me.\n \u201c(What does he want from our chieftain? Tell us, and we will decide whether we will allow you to enter our village.)\u201d\n I hesitated, then shook my head again. \u201c(No. His question is for the chieftain alone.)\u201d\n I was taking a gamble. Refusing a demand from a shatan warrior guarding his homeland was not a great way to make friends. But it was entirely possible that the warriors would misunderstand me if I told them that Dr. al-Baz wanted to take some of their blood; they might think his intent was hostile. The best thing to do was have the professor ask the chieftain directly for permission to take a blood sample from one of his people.\n The shatans stared at us for a moment without saying anything, then turned away and walked off a few feet to quietly confer with each other. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the professor asked, keeping his voice low. \u201cWhat did you tell them?\u201d\n I gave him the gist of the conversation, including the risky thing I\u2019d just said. \u201cI figure it can go one of three ways. One, they kick the matter upstairs to the chieftain, which means that you get your wish if you play your cards right. Two, they tell us to get lost. If that happens, we turn around and go home, and that\u2019s that.\u201d\n \u201cUnacceptable. I\u2019ve come too far to go away empty-handed. What\u2019s the third option.\u201d\n \u201cThey impale with their spears, wait for us to die, then chop up our bodies and scatter our remains for the animals to find.\u201d I let that sink in. \u201cExcept our heads,\u201d I added. \u201cSomeone will carry those back to the city in the middle of the night, where they\u2019ll dump them on the doorstep of the nearest available house.\u201d\n \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t. The professor was scared enough already, and he didn\u2019t need any stories about what had happened to explorers who\u2019d crossed the line with the shatan, or the occasional fool stupid enough to venture onto aboriginal territory without someone like me escorting them. I hadn\u2019t exaggerated anything, though, and he seemed to realize that, for he simply nodded and looked away.\n The shatan finished their discussion. Not looking at us, they walked back to their hattases and climbed atop them again. For a moment, I thought that they were taking the second option, but then they guided their mounts toward Dr. al-Baz and me.\n \u201cHessah,\u201d one of them said (Come with us).\n I let out my breath. We were going to meet the village chieftain.\n The village was different from the last time I\u2019d seen it. Since the shatan became nomads, their settlements are usually tent cities which can be taken down, packed up, and relocated when necessary. This one had been there for quite a while, though; apparently the inhabitants had decided that they\u2019d stay at the oasis for some time to come. Low, flat-roofed adobe buildings had taken the place of many of the tents, and scaffolds surrounded a stone wall being built to enclose them. But if the place had a name, I wasn\u2019t aware of it.\n Dr. al-Baz and I were footsore and tired by the time we reached the village. As expected, the warriors had insisted that we leave the jeep behind, although they allowed us to retrieve our packs. They\u2019d slowly ridden abreast of us all the way, only reluctantly letting us stop now and then to rest. Neither of them had spoken a word since we\u2019d left the bridge, but when we were within sight of the settlement, one of them raised a whorled shell that looked like a giant ammonite. A long, loud blast from his horn was answered a few seconds later by a similar call from the village. The professor and I exchanged a wary glance. Too late to turn around now; the inhabitants knew we were coming.\n The village seemed empty as we entered through a half-built gate and walked down packed-dirt streets. No one to be seen, and the only thing that moved were hattases tied up to hitching posts. The tent flaps were closed, though, and the narrow windows of the adobe houses were shuttered. No, the place wasn\u2019t deserted; it was just that the people who lived there had gone into hiding. The silence was eerie, and even more unsettling than the spears our escorts pointed at our backs.\n The village center was a courtyard surrounding an artesian well, with a large adobe building dominating one side of the square. The only shatan we\u2019d seen since our arrival peered down at us from a wooden tower atop the building. He waited until we\u2019d reached the building, then raised an ammonite horn of his own and blew a short blast. The warriors halted their hattases, dismounted, and silently beckoned for us to follow them. One of them pushed aside the woven blanket which served as the building\u2019s only door, and the other warrior led us inside.\n The room was dim, its sole illumination a shaft of sunlight slanting down through a hole in the ceiling. The air was thick with musky incense that drifted in hazy layers through the light and made my eyes water. Robed shatan stood around the room, their faces hidden by hoods they\u2019d pulled up around their heads; I knew none of them were female, because their women were always kept out of sight when visitors arrived. The only sound was the slow, constant drip of a waterclock, with each drop announcing the passage of two more seconds.\n The chieftain sat in the middle of the room. Long-fingered hands rested upon the armrests of his sandstone throne; golden eyes regarded us between strands of hair turned white with age. He wore nothing to indicate his position as the tribal leader save an implacable air of authority, and he let us know that he was the boss by silently raising both hands, then slowly lowering them once we\u2019d halted and saying nothing for a full minute.\n At last he spoke. \u201cEssha shakay Hamsey?\u201d (Why are you here, Ramsey?)\n I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever met him before, but obviously he recognized me. Good. That would make things a little easier. I responded in his own language. \u201c(I bring someone who wants to learn more about your people. He is a wise man from Earth, a teacher of others who wish to become wise themselves. He desires to ask a favor from you.)\u201d\n The chieftain turned his gaze from me to Dr. al-Baz. \u201c(What do you want?)\u201d\n I looked at the professor. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re on. He wants to know what you want. I\u2019ll translate for you. Just be careful . . . they\u2019re easily offended.\u201d\n \u201cSo it seems.\u201d Dr. al-Baz was nervous, but he was hiding it well. He licked his lips and thought about it a moment, then went on. \u201cTell him . . . tell him that I would like to collect a small sample of blood from one of his people. A few drops will do. I wish to have this because I want to know . . . I mean, because I\u2019d like to find out . . . whether his people and mine have common ancestors.\u201d\n That seemed to be a respectful way of stating what he wanted, so I turned to the chief and reiterated what he\u2019d said. The only problem was that I didn\u2019t know the aboriginal word for \u201cblood.\u201d It had simply never come up in any previous conversations I\u2019d had with the shatan. So I had to generalize a bit, calling it \u201cthe liquid that runs within our bodies\u201d while pantomiming a vein running down the inside of my right arm, and hoped that he\u2019d understand what I meant.\n He did, all right. He regarded me with cold disbelief, golden eyes flashing, thin lips writhing upon an otherwise stoical face. Around us, I heard the other shatan murmuring to one another. I couldn\u2019t tell what they were saying, but it didn\u2019t sound like they were very happy either.\n We were in trouble.\n \u201c(Who dares say that shatan and nashatan have the same ancestors?)\u201d he snapped, hands curling into fists as he leaned forward from his throne. \u201c(Who dares believe that your people and mine are alike in any way?)\u201d\n I repeated what he\u2019d said to Dr. al-Baz. The professor hesitated, then looked straight at the chieftain. \u201cTell him that no one believes these things,\u201d he said, his tone calm and deliberate. \u201cIt is only a hypothesis . . . an educated guess . . . that I want to either prove or disprove. That\u2019s why I need a blood sample, to discover the truth.\u201d\n I took a deep breath, hoped that I was going to get out of there alive, then translated the professor\u2019s explanation. The chieftain continued to glare at us as I spoke, but he seemed to calm down a little. For several long seconds, he said nothing. And then he reached a decision.\n Reaching into his robes, he withdrew a bone dagger from a sheath on his belt. My heart skipped a beat as the light fell upon its sharp white blade, and when he stood up and walked toward us, I thought my life had come to an end. But then he stopped in front of Dr. al-Baz and, still staring straight at him, raised his left hand, placed the knife against his palm, and ran its blade down his skin.\n \u201c(Take my blood),\u201d he said, holding out his hand.\n I didn\u2019t need to translate what he\u2019d said. Dr. al-Baz quickly dropped his backpack from his shoulders and opened it. He withdrew a syringe, thought better of it, and pulled out a plastic test tube instead. The chieftain clenched his fist and let the blood trickle between his fingers, and the professor caught it in his test tube. Once he\u2019d collected the specimen, he pulled out a tiny vial and added a couple of drops of anticoagulant. Then he capped the tube and nodded to the chieftain.\n \u201cTell him that I greatly appreciate his kindness,\u201d he said, \u201cand that I will return to tell him what I have found.\u201d\n \u201cLike hell we will!\u201d\n \u201cTell him.\u201d His eyes never left the chieftain\u2019s. \u201cOne way or another, he deserves to know the truth.\u201d\n Promising the chieftain that we intended to return was the last thing I wanted to do, but I did it anyway. He didn\u2019t respond for a moment, but simply dropped his hand, allowing his blood to trickle to the floor.\n \u201c(Yes),\u201d he said at last. \u201c(Come back and tell me what you\u2019ve learned. I wish to know as well.)\u201d And then he turned his back to us and walked back to his chair. \u201c(Now leave.)\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered, feeling my heart hammering against my chest. \u201cYou got what you came for. Now let\u2019s get out of here while we still have our heads.\u201d\n Two days later, I was sitting in the casino bar at the John Carter, putting away tequila sunrises and occasionally dropping a coin into the video poker machine in front of me. I\u2019d discovered that I didn\u2019t mind the place so long as I kept my back turned to everything going on around me, and I could drink for free if I slipped a quarter into the slots every now and then. At least that\u2019s what I told myself. The fact of the matter was that there was a certain sense of security in the casino\u2019s tawdry surroundings. This Mars was a fantasy, to be sure, but just then it was preferable to the unsettling reality I\u2019d visited a couple of days earlier.\n Omar al-Baz was upstairs, using the equipment he\u2019d brought with him to analyze the chieftain\u2019s blood. We\u2019d gone straight to the hotel upon returning to the city, but when it became obvious that it would take awhile for the professor to work his particular kind of magic, I decided to go downstairs and get a drink. Perhaps I should have gone home, but I was still keyed up from the long ride back, so I gave Dr. al-Baz my cell number and asked him to call me if and when he learned anything.\n I was surprised that I stuck around. Usually when I return from a trip into the outback, all I really want to do is get out of the clothes I\u2019d been wearing for days on end, open a beer, and take a nice, long soak in the bathtub. Instead, there I was, putting away one cocktail after another while demonstrating that I knew absolutely nothing about poker. The bartender was studying me and the waitresses were doing their best to stay upwind, but I could have cared less about what they thought. They were make-believe Martians, utterly harmless. The ones I\u2019d met a little while ago would have killed me just for looking at them cross-eyed.\n In all the years that I\u2019d been going out in the wilderness, this was the first time I\u2019d ever been really and truly scared. Not by the desert, but by those who lived there. No shatan had ever threatened me, not even in an implicit way, until the moment the chieftain pulled out a knife and creased the palm of his hand with its blade. Sure, he\u2019d done so to give Dr. al-Baz a little of his blood, but there was another meaning to his actions.\n It was a warning . . . and the shatan don\u2019t give warnings lightly.\n That was why I was doing my best to get drunk. The professor was too excited to think of anything except the specimen he\u2019d just collected\u2014all the way home, he\u2019d babbled about nothing else\u2014but I knew that we\u2019d come within an inch of dying, and that ours would have been a really nasty death.\n Yet the chieftain had given his blood of his own free will, and even asked that we return once the professor learned the truth. That puzzled me. Why would he be interested in the results, if the thought of being related to a human was so appalling?\n I threw away another quarter, pushed the buttons and watched the machine tell me that I\u2019d lost again, then looked around to see if I could flag down a princess and get her to fetch another sunrise. Dejah or Thuvia or Xaxa or whoever she was had apparently gone on break, though, because she was nowhere to be seen; I was about to try my luck again when something caught my eye. The TV above the bar was showing the evening news, and the weatherman was standing in front of his map. I couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying, but he was pointing at an animated cloud system west of Rio Zephyria that was moving across the desert toward the Laestrygon canal.\n It appeared that a sandstorm was brewing in Mesogaea, the drylands adjacent to the Zephyria region. This sort of weather isn\u2019t uncommon in the summer; we call them haboobs, the Arabic name for sandstorms on Earth that somehow found its way to Mars. From the looks of things, it would reach the Zephyria outback sometime tomorrow afternoon. Good thing I\u2019d come home; the last thing anyone would want is to be caught out in the desert during a bad storm.\n A waitress strolled by, adjusting a strap of her costume bikini top. I raised my glass and silently jiggled it back and forth, and she feigned a smile as she nodded and headed for the bar. I was searching my pockets for another quarter so that she\u2019d see that I was still pretending to be a gambler when my cell buzzed.\n \u201cJim? Are you still here?\u201d\n \u201cIn the bar, professor. Come down and have a drink with me.\u201d\n \u201cNo! No time for that! Come upstairs right away! I need to see you!\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n \u201cJust come up here! It\u2019s better if I show you!\u201d\n Dr. al-Baz opened the door at the first knock. Spotting the cocktail glass in my hand, he snatched it from me and drained it in one gulp. \u201cGood heavens,\u201d he gasped, \u201cI needed that!\u201d\n \u201cWant me to get you another one?\u201d\n \u201cNo . . . but you can buy me a drink when I get to Stockholm.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand what he meant, but before I could ask he pulled me into the room. \u201cLook!\u201d he said, pointing to one of the computers set up on the bar. \u201cThis is incredible!\u201d\n I walked over to the bar, peered at the screen. Displayed upon it were rows of A\u2019s, C\u2019s, G\u2019s, and T\u2019s, arranged in a seemingly endless series of combinations, with smears that looked a little like dashes running in a vertical bar down the right side of the screen. A five-line cluster of combinations and smears was highlighted in yellow.\n \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d I said. \u201cProfessor, I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re going to have to . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re looking at, do you?\u201d he asked, and I shook my head. \u201cThis is the human genome . . . the genetic code present in every human being. And these\u2014\u201d his hand trembled as he pointed to the highlighted cluster \u201c\u2014are strands that are identical to the partially-sequenced genome from the aborigine specimen.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re the same?\u201d\n \u201cExactly. There is no error . . . or at least none that the computers can detect.\u201d Dr. al-Baz took a deep breath. \u201cDo you see what I\u2019m getting at? The hypothesis is correct! Human life may have originated on Mars!\u201d\n I stared at the screen. Until then, I hadn\u2019t really believed anything that Dr. al-Baz had told me; it seemed too unlikely to be true. But now that the evidence was in front of me, I realized that I was looking at something that would shake the foundations of science. No, not just science . . . it would rattle history itself, forcing humankind to reconsider its origins.\n \u201cMy god,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHave you told anyone yet? On Earth, I mean\u201d\n \u201cNo. I\u2019m tempted to send a message, but . . . no, I need to confirm this.\u201d The professor walked over to the window. \u201cWe have to go back,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but firm as he gazed out at the city lights and, beyond them, the dark expanse of the desert. \u201cI need to get another blood sample, this time from a different shatan. If the same sequence appears in the second sample, then we\u2019ll know for sure.\u201d\n Something cold slithered down my spine. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea. The chieftain . . . \u201d\n \u201cThe chieftain told us that he wanted to know what we discovered. So we\u2019ll tell him, and explain that we need more blood . . . just a little . . . from one of his tribesmen to make sure that it\u2019s the truth.\u201d Dr. al-Baz glanced over his shoulder at me. \u201cNot an unreasonable request, no?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be very happy about this, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d\n He was quiet for a few moments, contemplating what I\u2019d just said. \u201cWell . . . that\u2019s a risk we\u2019ll just have to take,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you again for another trip, if that\u2019s your concern . . . double your original fee, in fact. But I must go back as soon as possible.\u201d He continued to gaze out the window. \u201cTomorrow morning. I want to leave tomorrow morning.\u201d\n My head was beginning to ache, dull blades pressing upon my temples. I shouldn\u2019t have had so much to drink. What I should have done was turn him down right then and there. But his offer to double my fee for a return trip was too good to pass up; I needed the money, and that would pay my rent for a couple of months. Besides, I was too drunk to argue.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll head out first thing.\u201d\n I went back to my place, took some aspirin, stripped off my filthy clothes, and took a shower, then flopped into bed. But I didn\u2019t fall asleep for quite a while. Instead, I stared at the ceiling as unwelcome thoughts ran an endless loop through my mind.\n What would the chieftain do when Omar al-Baz informed him that shatan blood and nashatan blood were very much alike and that our two races might be related? He wouldn\u2019t be pleased, that much was certain. The aborigines never wanted to have anything to do with the invaders from Earth; as soon as our ships had arrived, they had retreated into the wilderness. This was the reason why they\u2019d become nomads . . .\n But they weren\u2019t anymore, were they? The significance of what I\u2019d seen at the village suddenly became clear to me. Not only had this particular tribe built permanent houses, but they were also erecting a wall around them. That meant they were planning to remain where they were for some time to come, and were taking measures to defend themselves. They were tiring of running from us; now they were digging in.\n Until now, the human colonists had been content to ignore the shatan, thinking of them as reclusive savages best left alone. This would change, though, if humans came to believe that homo sapiens and homo aresians were cousins. Suddenly, we\u2019d want to know all about them. First would come more biologists like Dr. al-Baz, more anthropologists like Dr. Horner. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be so bad . . . but right behind them would be everyone else. Historians and journalists, tour buses and camera safaris, entrepreneurs looking to make a buck, missionaries determined to convert godless souls, real estate tycoons seeking prime land on which to build condos with a nice view of those quaint aborigine villages . . .\n The shatan wouldn\u2019t tolerate this. And the chieftain would know that it was inevitable the moment Dr. al-Baz told him what he\u2019d learned. First, he\u2019d order his warriors to kill both him and me. And then . . .\n In my mind\u2019s eye, I saw the horrors to come. Wave upon wave of shatan warriors descending upon Rio Zephyria and the other colonies, hell-bent on driving the invaders from their world once and for all. Oh, we had superior weapons, this was true . . . but they had superior numbers, and it would only be a matter of time before they captured a few of our guns and learned how to use them. Ships from Earth would bring soldiers to defend the colonies, but history is unkind to would-be conquerors. Either we would be driven back, step by inexorable step, or we would commit genocide, exterminating entire tribes and driving the few survivors further into the wilderness.\n Either way, the outcome was inevitable. War would come to a world named for a god of war. Red blood would fell upon red sand, human and Martian alike.\n A storm was coming. Then I thought of a different storm, and knew what I had to do.\n Two days later, I was found staggering out of the desert, caked with red sand from my hair to my boots save for raccoon-like patches around my eyes where my goggles had protected them. I was dehydrated and exhausted to the point of delirium.\n I was also alone.\n Ironically, the people who rescued me were another guide and the family from Minneapolis whom he\u2019d escorted into the desert just outside Rio Zephyria. I remember little of what happened after I collapsed at their feet and had to be carried to the guide\u2019s land rover. The only things I clearly recall were the sweet taste of water within my parched mouth, a teenage girl gazing down at me with angelic blue eyes as she cradled my head in her lap, the long, bouncing ride back into the city.\n I was still in my hospital bed when the police came to see me. By then, I\u2019d recovered enough to give them a clear and reasonably plausible account of what had happened. Like any successful lie, this one was firmly grounded in truth. The violent haboob that had suddenly come upon us in the desert hills. The crash that happened when, blinded by wind-driven sand, I\u2019d collided with a boulder, causing my jeep to topple over. How Dr. al-Baz and I had escaped from the wreckage, only to lose track of each other. How only I had managed to find shelter in the leeside of a pinnacle. The professor becoming lost in the storm, never to be seen again.\n All true, every word of it. All I had to do was leave out a few facts, such as how I\u2019d deliberately driven into the desert even though I knew that a haboob was on its way, or that even after we saw the scarlet haze rising above the western horizon, I\u2019d insisted upon continuing to drive south, telling Dr. al-Baz that we\u2019d be able to outrun the storm. The cops never learned that I\u2019d been careful to carry with me a pair of sand goggles and a scarf, but refrained from making sure that the professor took the same precautions. Nor did they need to know that I\u2019d deliberately aimed for that boulder, even though I could have easily avoided it.\n I broke down when I spoke about how I\u2019d heard Omar al-Baz calling my name, desperately trying to find me even as the air was filled with stinging red sand and visibility was reduced to only arm\u2019s length. That much, too, was true. What I didn\u2019t say was that Dr. al-Baz had come within three meters of where I was huddled, my eyes covered by goggles and a scarf wrapped around the lower part of my face. And yet I remained silent as I watched his indistinct form lurch past me, arms blindly thrust out before him, slowly suffocating as sand filled his nose and throat.\n My tears were honest. I liked the professor. But his knowledge made him too dangerous to live.\n As an alibi, my story worked. When a search party went out into the desert, they located my overturned jeep. Omar al-Baz\u2019s body was found about fifteen meters away, face-down and covered by several centimeters of sand. Our footprints had been erased by the wind, of course, so there was no way of telling how close the professor had been to me.\n That settled any doubts the cops may have had. Dr. al-Baz\u2019s death was an accident. I had no motive for killing him, nor was there any evidence of foul play. If I was guilty of anything, it was only reckless and foolish behavior. My professional reputation was tarnished, but that was about it. The investigation was officially concluded the day I was released from the hospital. By then, I\u2019d realized two things. The first was that I would get away with murder. The second was that my crime was far from perfect.\n Dr. al-Baz hadn\u2019t taken the chieftain\u2019s blood specimen with him when he\u2019d left the hotel. It was still in his room, along with all his equipment. This included the computers he\u2019d used to analyze the sample; the results were saved in their memories, along with any notes he might have written. In fact, the only thing the professor had brought with him was his room key . . . which I\u2019d neglected to retrieve from his body.\n I couldn\u2019t return to his hotel room; any effort to get in would have aroused suspicion. All I could do was watch from the hotel lobby as, a couple of days later, the bellhops wheeled out a cart carrying the repacked equipment cases, bound for the spaceport and the shuttle which would ferry them to a marsliner docked at Deimos Station. In a few months, the professor\u2019s stuff would be back in the hands of his fellow faculty members. They would open the digital files and inspect what their late colleague had learned, and examine the blood specimen he\u2019d collected. And then . . .\n Well. We\u2019ll just have to see, won\u2019t we?\n So now I sit alone in my neighborhood bar, where I drink and wait for the storm to come. And I never go into the desert anymore.\n Originally published in Old Mars, edited by Gardner Dozois and George R. R.

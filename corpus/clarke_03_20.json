While the first round went very smoothly, there were several easily-spotted attempts to stuff the ballot in round two. With that obvious exception, we\u2019d like to thank everyone who participated this year. It was a very exciting race to the finish!\nBest Cover of 2019\nThe result for best cover art was extremely close between the top three from beginning to end and the others were never that far behind. Only one point separated 2nd from 3rd place.\nAnd our winner is:\nBest Story of 2019\nAfter a tight race to make the final ballot, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect in this category. For the first few days, it looked like we\u2019d have more of the same, but gradually, five separated from the pack and exchanged the top spot on an almost daily basis.\nAnd our winner is:\nCongratulations to our winners and all the finalists!\nAdditional congratulations are due to this year\u2019s story winner, A. T. Greenblatt. \u201cGive the Family My Love\u201d has also been announced as a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story!\nOur cover art winner, Matt Dixon, will also be launching a Kickstarter campaign for his sixth book of robot art on March 10th. If you liked his cover, you\u2019ll probably want to check it out.\nI\u2019m also happy to report that I\u2019ve been given the all-clear by my doctors to resume normal activities again. Thank you all for your support and patience over the last couple of months. It\u2019s been rough and I look forward to having some semblance of normalcy return to my life in the weeks ahead.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

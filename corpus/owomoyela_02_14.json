The soles of my runners\u2019 grips are pressed against the spire\u2019s composite, their traction engineered at a microscopic level. But I\u2019m not going to push off. I\u2019m 180 meters up, and while I could drop and catch the festoons\u2014my gloves get as much traction as my grips\u2014that\u2019s not what I want. I want to freefall all 180 meters, and catch myself, and launch into a run.\n That\u2019s crazy thinking. I\u2019m good, but no human\u2019s that good; I\u2019m a freerunner, not a hhaellesh.\n I shift my center of gravity. The wind is still temperate up here, fluttering cool under my collar. It outlines the spot of heat where my pendant rests against my skin.\n The pendant is the size of my thumbnail, and always warmer than it should be. This has something to do with it reflecting the heat of my body back to me, so the pendant itself never heats up. It was built to do this because it\u2019s no gem; its brilliant red comes from my mother\u2019s cryopreserved blood.\n It was, until the Feast of the Return that morning, the only thing I\u2019d known of her.\n The colony\u2019s designed for freerunning. The cops all take classes in it. That\u2019s what comes of a government that worships the hhaellesh, who can carve their own path through the three dimensions.\n I\u2019m not a cop, either.\n I end up dropping, twisting so my fingers and toes find the carved laurels, and from there I make a second drop to the Observance\u2019s dome. At my hip, my phone starts thumping like an artificial heartbeat. I pause with my fingertips on the gilt, and finally turn to brace my heels against the shingles and lean back into the curve. I clip the hands-free to my ear, and thumb the respond button. Then I just listen.\n After a moment of silence, a human voice says, \u201cAditi?\u201d\n I let out a breath. \u201cMichel,\u201d I answer. He\u2019s a friend.\n \u201cAre you okay\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Obviously a hhaellesh could get up to my perch here, and so could Michel\u2014he\u2019s from a family of cops, so he\u2019s been playing games with gravity for longer than I have. But effective or not, there\u2019s a reason I\u2019m nearly two hundred meters up, and that reason has a lot to do with not wanting to talk about how okay I am.\n Michel digests that, then says \u201cOkay. Did you hear the new El\u00edas Perez episode?\u201d\n My chest fills with a relief indistinguishable from love. I love Michel so much that it\u2019s painful, sometimes, to know he\u2019s not my brother. I wish the same blood flowed through both our bodies, and without thinking past that, my fingers go to the pendant at my throat. There, my voice catches.\n There are moments when I feel so ashamed.\n \u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cPut it on.\u201d\n The hhaellesh stand at least six feet tall, and usually closer to seven or eight. Their skin is glossy black. Their digitigrade feet end in small, grasping pads; their hands end in two fingers and two opposing thumbs which are thin enough to fit into cracks and gaps and strong enough to pierce titanium composite and tear apart the alloys of landships. They are streamlined and swift, with aquiline profiles and a leaping, running gait like a cat or an impala. They can fall from high atmosphere and suffer no injury. They can jump sixteen meters in a bound. They are war machines and killing machines.\n They are also human sacrifices.\n I envy them.\n Gods, if there was anything in the universe El\u00edas couldn\u2019t handle, his writers haven\u2019t thrown it at him yet. He would know how to tell his best friend about an enlistment option. He could figure out how to deal with a hhaellesh showing up at his door.\n Michel starts the playback, and I tweak the audio balance so I can hear Michel breathing while we both listen. The serials are propaganda and we know it, but they\u2019re enjoyable propaganda, so that\u2019s fine.\n [The esshesh gave us the hhaellesh and the hhaellesh handed us the war\u2014but if we didn\u2019t have the hhaellesh, we\u2019d still have El\u00edas Perez,] the canned narrator says, and I lean into the backbeat behind his words. [Welcome to the adventure.]\n Around me, the colony spreads out in its careful geometry. There\u2019s nothing left to chance or whimsy, here, or adapted from the streets and carriageways built by another, more ancient, society. There\u2019s no downtown you can look at and say, this predated cars and light rail. No sprawling tourist docks with names that hold onto history. This place is older than I am, but not by much; it\u2019s only about the age of my mother.\n That\u2019s why we cling so much to ceremony, I think: it\u2019s what we have in place of tradition. We make monuments to an ongoing war, and when the soldiers return home we have feasts, and we plan holidays to rename the Observances to the Remembrances. The war\u2019s only just ended and in a month we\u2019ll have three Remembrances of the War, in shiny white limestone and black edging in places of honor.\n I get it.\n Seriously, I do. When you don\u2019t have history in the place you live, you have to make it up or go insane.\n Earlier in the day, my mother\u2019d shown up to the crappy little allotment I cook and sleep in but don\u2019t spend much time in. My allotment\u2019s on the seventeenth floor of a housing unit, which makes for a perfect launch point, and doesn\u2019t usually get me visitors on the balcony. I was on the mat in my room, with my mattress folded up into the wall, doing pushup jump squats. They weren\u2019t helping. I\u2019d split my lip just a bit earlier, and since I bite when I get restless, I had the taste of blood in my mouth.\n Then there she was, knocking at the lintel, and I split my lip open again.\n I did a thirty-second cooldown and made myself walk to the window. If it had been dark, if the light hadn\u2019t been scattering off the white buildings and back down from the cyan sky, it might not have glinted on her skin. She might have just been a black, alien shape like a hole in the world.\n \u201cI expected to see you at the Feast of the Return,\u201d she said. \u201cI registered my arrival.\u201d\n \u201cI was busy,\u201d I lied.\n She regarded me, quietly. And although I didn\u2019t want to, I invited her in.\n When I first met Michel, he was walking along the rails of the pedestrian bridge by the Second General Form school. I was in Second General Form mostly because my father had hired a tutor before we came to the colony; my education in Shivaji Administrative District hadn\u2019t exactly been compatible with the colony\u2019s educational tracks. I was new, and didn\u2019t know any of my classmates. We knew each other\u2019s names from the class introductions, so Michel didn\u2019t bother to introduce himself.\n \u201cSettle an argument,\u201d he said. \u201cI think El\u00edas is in love with Seve, and Seve just thinks he\u2019s ridiculous. My cousin thinks Seve loves El\u00edas but doesn\u2019t want to show it, and El\u00edas is just friendly and chirpy to everyone, so he doesn\u2019t even see anything weird about acting like that at Seve. You should tell her I\u2019m right.\u201d\n I shook my head. \u201cEl\u00edas? Is that the government stuff? I don\u2019t listen to that.\u201d\n \u201cWha-a-at?\u201d Michel asked, bobbing the a. \u201cCome on, everyone listens to El\u00edas!\u201d\n \u201cMy dad says it\u2019s just propaganda,\u201d I said, and I remember that little preadolescent me felt damn proud of herself and all smart and grown-up to be slinging around words like propaganda. \u201cThey just make it so people will want to join the war.\u201d\n \u201cWell, duh,\u201c Michel said. \u201cEverybody knows that. But it\u2019s cool! Come on, lemme tell you about this time that El\u00edas got stuck on this planet; they were trying to make it into a colony, but there was a whole swarm of the enemy and his ship was broken and he couldn\u2019t take off . . . \u201d\n El\u00edas always found a way through, and by the end of the day, I was listening to the show. I never helped Michel settle his argument, but I came to my own conclusions.\n Today\u2019s episode opens with the soundscape that means El\u00edas is on the bridge of the Command and Control station in the sector designated as the Front. Meaning he\u2019s on the front lines. Last time that happened, he was in a story arc that had him working with the Coalition forces, which he hates to do; El\u00edas isn\u2019t really an official sort of guy.\n [\u201cIf our intelligence reports are correct,\u201d] says the voice of Commodore Shah, [\u201cwe\u2019re about to lose the war.\u201d]\n The art of the gentle lead-in is verboten in El\u00edas Perez.\n [\u201cA larger enemy presence than any we\u2019ve ever seen is massing at Hurac\u00e1n II. We believe they\u2019ll use this staging ground to launch a major, unified offensive on the colonies.\u201d]\n [\u201cYou want us to what?\u201d] That\u2019s Seve, the captain of Elias\u2019s ship. She snickers. [\u201cTake out a whole fleet of the bastids? Hah. No bones in that dog.\u201d]\n \u201cOh, Seve,\u201d Michel says. Seve\u2019s got a stack of sayings that only make sense to her\u2014and to El\u00edas, nowadays, though they didn\u2019t always. El\u00edas and Seve have been partners since episode 3, where El\u00edas stowed aboard Seve\u2019s pirate ship and ended up saving it when it was infested by the enemy. Seve turned around and said, there, that paid El\u00edas\u2019s boarding fee; what was he going to pay for passage?\n I\u2019m a fan of El\u00edas and Seve. Love at first uncompromising deal. And she isn\u2019t the kind to think the end of the war obligates her into anything.\n [\u201cIf their war force goes unopposed, the enemy will be able to sweep through our territories unopposed. The Coalition doesn\u2019t have the fleet strength to stop them.\u201d]\n There\u2019s a subtle swell in the background music, a rumble of drums and solar radio output, and a thrill goes through me. The writers can play drama with our fear of the war: for most of us, it\u2019s the fun kind of fear where something is technically possible but pretty damn unlikely, like an asteroid crashing into the colony. After we lost the Painter settlement, the war was always off somewhere out there; we sent out troops, we made our hhaellesh, but it\u2019s not like we were really under threat of invasion. I don\u2019t think our colony even had an invasion plan in place, beyond the esshesh defense emplacements. We all got a little afraid, but the fear was a what if, on an offchance, someday . . . and not a when, as it will, this happens to us.\n [\u201cOkay,\u201d] El\u00edas says, always the good guy, always the hero. [\u201cWhat\u2019s our job? We can barely take one enemy ship in a firefight; a force that size is beyond us.\u201d]\n Commodore Shah says nothing, and the delay is striking. The audio play doesn\u2019t go for delays. There\u2019s another rumble, and another sensation thrills up my spine, but it\u2019s not the fun kind of thrill this time.\n \u201cOh, you\u2019re not,\u201d I whisper.\n [\u201cAs you know,\u201d] Shah says, her voice clipped so regret doesn\u2019t make it through. [\u201cHurac\u00e1n II suffers from a violent geology. Your ship is one of the few with both the range to reach the Hurac\u00e1n system and the maneuverability to penetrate the enemy\u2019s lines and engage your jump engines within the planet\u2019s red jump threshold.\u201d]\n I hear Michel\u2019s sucked-in breath, and I\u2019m sitting dumb, myself.\n [\u201cBlow out the planet and us with it,\u201d] Seve says. [\u201cJump\u2019ll turn the rock into a frag grenade, and the gravity turns my girl\u2019s engines into a nova. That what you want from us, Shah?\u201d]\n Shah\u2019s always looked after her people. El\u00edas and Seve\u2014they\u2019re not official, military types, but Shah looks after them as her own. Problem is, even Shah\u2019s people come in second to the war.\n [\u201cIt\u2019s not what I want,\u201d] Shah says, and I want to slam my headset down. [\u201cBut I don\u2019t see another option.\u201d]\n \u201cThey\u2019re doing a finale,\u201d I say, my calves and fingers burning again to run. \u201cThe war is over, so they\u2019re just going to finish El\u00edas Perez.\u201d\n \u201cYou left when I was three years old,\u201d I\u2019d told my mother as she crouched at the edge of the table, as I shuffled through my shelves for a decent tea. I had a couple spoonfuls left of loose-leaf colony Faisal, which I hear is a good substitute for an Earth Assam, which I will never in my life be able to afford unless it goes big and all the importers start shipping it in in bulk. But the urge to make a good impression got in a fistfight with the urge to be petty and spiteful, and I pulled out two bags of a generic colony black and plunked them into mugs.\n \u201cI remember,\u201d she said. \u201cI braided your hair and you wore your favorite dress. It was the blue of cobalt glass.\u201d\n Her voice was deep and flanged, and totally factual. All hhaellesh sound alike. At least, the ones on the war reports sounded the same as my mother.\n I have an allotment and not a flat because I have a work placement and not a career. I don\u2019t care for any of the careers on offer. But the colony\u2019s not so much of a fool to let work potential go unexploited, unlike the governments of Earth which I\u2019m just old enough to remember. I still have images of walking to the subway past the grimy homeless, with my father\u2019s hand on the small of my back to rush me along.\n That\u2019s what I remember of my childhood. My father\u2019s protective hand, my father\u2019s tutoring after school, my father\u2019s anchor mustache with a bit more salt in its pepper every year, my father\u2019s voice carefully explaining the war.\n \u201cI don\u2019t like dresses,\u201d I told my mother, and set down the two mugs of tea. Her fingers clicked around the ceramic.\n The hhaellesh can eat and drink, but human scientists still don\u2019t know how food passes through the suits. We do know that the suits filter and metabolize any toxins\u2014people have tried to poison them before, with everything from arsenic and cyanide to things like strong sulphuric acid, and the hhaellesh just eat and drink it up and are polite enough not to mention it.\n I did not try to poison my mother.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve grown,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, I expected that.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, kids grow up when you disappear on them.\u201d\n She was quiet for a few seconds. \u201cI did not expect your father to die.\u201d\n I stared down into my slowly-darkening tea.\n \u201cI received notice,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to make the decision whether or not to come home. The tide of the war hadn\u2019t turned yet. I knew the colony would look after you.\u201d\n I swirled the tea in my mug. Tendrils of relative darkness wavered out from the bag.\n \u201cI was one of only eight hundred hhaellesh volunteers at that point,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I finally interrupted. \u201cWithout the hhaellesh, we wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve won the war.\u201d\n This is how the hhaellesh happened:\n We had a handful of colonies in the Solar system and three outside of it: Gliese, Korolev, and Painter. Then, abruptly, we had a handful of colonies in the Solar system and two colonies in Gliese and Korolev.\n We still thought interstellar colonization was a pretty neat thing, and despite centuries of space war fiction, we didn\u2019t have the infrastructure or the technology to mount a space war. We were thoroughly thumped.\n Then the esshesh showed up and told us that, while war was (untranslatable, but we think against their religion), they had no problems with arming races to defend themselves.\n So they gave us the hhaellesh.\n This is how the hhaellesh work:\n There\u2019s a black suit that scatters light like obsidian and feels like a flexible atmosphere-dome composite to the touch. A soldier gets inside, bare as the day she was born. The suit closes around her.\n In a few minutes, it\u2019s taking her breath and synthesizing the carbon dioxide back to oxygen. In a few hours it\u2019s taking her waste and digesting the organic components. In a few days it\u2019s replaced the top layers of her skin. In a few months it\u2019s integrated itself into her muscles. In a few years there\u2019s nothing human left in there, just the patterns of her neural activity playing across an alien substrate that we haven\u2019t managed to understand yet.\n This is how a hhaellesh retires:\n The suit has a reverse mode. It can start rebuilding the human core, re-growing the body, replacing the armor\u2019s substrate material with blood and muscle and bone and brain matter until the armor opens up again, and the human steps out, bare as the day they were born. A body like Theseus\u2019s ship.\n But to do that, it needs the original human DNA.\n Or some human DNA, in any case; hell, I don\u2019t know that anyone\u2019s tried it, but you could probably feed in the DNA of your favorite celebrity and the hhaellesh suit would grow it for you, slipping your brain pattern in like that was nothing strange. I suppose that should freak me out\u2014y\u2019know, existentially\u2014more than just growing a new copy of a body long ago digested by an alien non-meatsuit.\n It probably should, but it doesn\u2019t.\n This is how a hhaellesh tries to get the DNA that\u2019ll let it retire:\n My mother crouched at the side of my table. With the inhuman height and the swept-back digitigrade legs, the chairs weren\u2019t designed to accommodate her.\n \u201cWhen I left, I entrusted you with a sample of my DNA,\u201d she said, and my hand went to the pendant. \u201cWith love, my daughter, I ask for it back.\u201d\n At that point, I dove out the window.\n \u201cThey can\u2019t cancel El\u00edas,\u201d I say. The top-of-spire restlessness is back, and I want to drop, freefall, roll, clamber, climb. My shoulders and thighs are shaking. \u201cThe fuck. He\u2019s a goddamn cultural phenomenon, by now.\u201d\n Michel\u2019s voice is unsteady as well, but not as much as mine. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cTo be fair, I feel like after you\u2019ve won the war you don\u2019t need to push people to sign up for the Forces any more.\u201d\n \u201cFuck the war,\u201d I say, and there\u2019s anger at the pit of my throat. Like: how dare they take this away from us. Like: El\u00edas and his adventures belong to us. Since the beginning of the war they\u2019ve been how we\u2019re meant to see ourselves\u2014clever and active and go team human. You can\u2019t take away our stories just because we won.\n The first time I met my mother\u2014\n Except I can\u2019t put it like that, can I? You don\u2019t really meet your mother. Or I guess maybe you do at the moment of conception, if you think your zygote is you, or maybe it\u2019s when the first glimmers of thought show up in your still-developing brain. But I think maybe it doesn\u2019t count if there\u2019s no chance that little undeveloped you won\u2019t retain the memory.\n So. The first time I met my mother, I was in a utility transitway. You know, what we have for back alleys.\n I\u2019ve always been the kid with a chip on her shoulder and a grudge against the world and her nose high in the air. The grudge and the pride come from the same thing. Neither made me many friends.\n I ran into a bunch of the voluntary-career types in the transitway on the morning of the Feast, just after the big public ceremony. My blood was up and they were them, and, well, the specifics of the argument don\u2019t really matter. I started it. And then I was in the comforting beat of a street fight, and with a split lip and three split knuckles, and while one of them was hollering about how he was going to file a complaint for misdemeanor assault, who should show up?\n And my heart leapt up and got a grip in my throat, and I thought, Oh gods, a hhaellesh, and standing right there, alien and beautiful. Staring at us with a blank, featureless swept-forward face that we all unambiguously read as disapproval.\n The fight stopped. The boys stood there, twitching and uneasy, until they worked out that the hhaellesh was only staring at me. Then they slipped away.\n And I stood there, frozen in the moment, until I worked out why a hhaellesh would single me out and come find me in a utility transitway. The wonder was slapped right out of me. It meant nothing: it wasn\u2019t the free choice of an alien intelligence but the obligate bonds of unreliable blood.\n I turned my back and sprinted away.\n . . . hold it there for a moment. I realize this makes it sound like I just run from all my problems, and I want to make it clear that that\u2019s not true. The truth is that I run from this one problem, and looking back at it, I guess I always have.\n I was talking about my pride and my grudge, and how they both come down to this pendant at the base of my throat. My mother\u2019s blood. My mother the hhaellesh, the guardian of the colonies, the war hero.\n All the hhaellesh are war heroes.\n What the hell am I?\n [\u201cMy gotdamn ship,\u201d] Seve says. They\u2019re in the corridors of her gotdamn ship now, the soundscape full of mechanical noises and ambiance. There was a behind-the-scenes episode a few months ago back where they talked about those soundscapes, and how they chose the sounds for Seve\u2019s ship to be reminiscent of a heartbeat, rushing blood, ventilation like breath, so it\u2019d seem alive. [\u201cMy gotdamn job. Better pilot than you, anyway; I can see this idiot plan through.\u201d] She\u2019s pissed-off. I would be. Hell, I am.\n [\u201cI\u2019m a good enough pilot to dodge through a crowd,\u201d] El\u00edas says. [\u201cCome on, Seve. The captain doesn\u2019t have to go down with her ship.\u201d]\n Michel complains a lot that Seve is a boy\u2019s name, and I tell him that so were Sasha and Madison and Wyatt, back in the pre-space days known as the depths of history. And then Michel says that of course I would pay attention to the pre-space days, and I say that of course he thinks history started with the erection of the initial colony dome.\n Michel is first-generation colony native. He was born here. His parents were in the third or fourth batch of colonists to set down here. We\u2019re never quite sure who\u2019s supposed to be jealous of who in this relationship, so mostly we just rib each other a lot.\n In my position, it\u2019s easy to feel like you don\u2019t have a history. Yeah, I\u2019m from Earth, but I don\u2019t remember much. My dad knew more, but he naturalized us; the most culture I think he held over was the way he made tea in a pot with colony spices, and his habit of saying gods instead of god.\n I\u2019m the girl with the hhaellesh mother and the blood at her throat. That\u2019s who I am. And I was pretty sure no one could take that away.\n [\u201cSeve, I can\u2019t let you die in my place,\u201d] El\u00edas says.\n Seven snorts. [\u201cWell, one of us got to.\u201d]\n \u201cI enlisted,\u201d I blurt out. I swing the words like a fist. And I can hear the change in Michel\u2019s breathing on the other end; I can hear how El\u00edas and the finale and how the writers are screwing us over has ceased to matter.\n \u201cSay what?\u201d\n \u201cI enlisted,\u201d I say again. \u201cI got the assessment. They were going to let me into a Basic Training Group and then the war ended.\u201d\n Michel doesn\u2019t know what to say. I can tell because he says \u201cYou\u2014\u201d, and then \u201cOh.\u201d, and then \u201cSo . . . what? What now? Are you\u2014\u201d and then he trails off into silence. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve hurt him.\n It\u2019s a thing, in my family.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. All my plans have been derailed. \u201cI can join the colony\u2019s military track. Would that be totally pointless? Think I should go? I could just get out of here.\u201d\n \u201c . . . should I know the answer to this?\u201d He gives a nervous laugh\u2014and the laugh is probably fake, now that I think about it. It\u2019s not right, anyway. Michel\u2019s real laugh is this deep, throaty thing that doesn\u2019t sound right when you know that his voice is higher than average and naturally polite.\n If Michel was blood family there\u2019d be a reason I could point to as why I felt so close to him, without wanting to screw him. I could have family that meant what family\u2019s supposed to mean.\n After a moment, he says \u201cAditi, if this is about your mother, can we just, maybe, talk about your mother?\u201d\n Michel, Michel, my not-family family. Talking about my mother, my family not-family. I got this far by not looking too close at the contradiction. It\u2019s a lot harder to do when it breaks up your fights and shows up to tea.\n It\u2019s a lot harder to do when it wins its fucking war.\n When we came to the Colony, my father and I, we stepped off the transport in a queue of seven hundred other colonists. We waited nearly an hour before it was our turn to go into a white room whose windows let in the blue of the sky and the white of the skyline, and a pleasant-enough woman took our biometric data and verified all my father\u2019s professional assessments. She gave him his schedules \u2014for Colony orientation, the walking tour, the commerce and services lecture, the first day at his assigned career\u2014and set up an educational track for me. Through all of it, I was bored but fascinated by the blue-white-green of the outside world, and my father bounced me on his knee.\n At the end, the woman bent down and put her face in front of mine. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful piece of jewelry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n I looked her straight in the eye, and said\u2014you know, in the way that some kids don\u2019t quite get metaphor, even when they\u2019re using it \u2014\u201cIt\u2019s my mother.\u201d\n On my phone, there\u2019s a message from the Coalition Armed Forces Enlistment Office. It reads:\n To Aditi Elizabeth Chattopadhyay,\n This is a note to confirm that your assessment scores were sufficient to place you in a Basic Training Group for Immediate Interstellar and Exo-Atmospheric Combat. However, due to the recent decision of the Colony Coalition Oversight Office and the cessation of hostilities, the Coalition Armed Forces as an oversight unit is being disbanded and the colonies\u2019 individual standing military forces are being scaled back.\n At your request, your application can be transferred to the Gliese Armed Forces Enlistment Office, where you can enter into their Standing Military career track. If no such request is made, we will consider your enlistment withdrawn.\n Thank you for your willingness to serve the safety and security of the Colonies.\n The Standing Military career track trains you in an off-surface location with strict access restrictions. I could still get out of here. I have the option. She can\u2019t take everything away.\n I dial back the El\u00edas audio to a quiet background murmur. I can\u2019t concentrate on it, anyway, and I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to hear El\u00edas and Seve argue about who\u2019ll sacrifice for the other.\n \u201cAditi,\u201d Michel says.\n \u201cWhy the hell,\u201d I ask him, \u201cwouldn\u2019t you just put your blood in a bank safe if it meant that godsdamn much to you?\u201d\n There\u2019s a moment when I think that could have used a little more context than I gave it, but Michel finds the meaning fast. \u201cIf I had a kid, I\u2019d want to leave something they could know me by.\u201d\n I kinda think there\u2019s not a maternal bone in my body, because that just sounds stupid to me. \u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t end up knowing her, did I?\u201d\n \u201cYou can, though. Now. Can\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cShe came back for her blood,\u201d I say. \u201cShe never said she came back to get to know me.\u201d\n Like a slap in the face, Michel laughs.\n \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNot funny.\u201d\n \u201cIt is, though,\u201d Michel says. \u201cAdi, I swear you just described exactly what you would do. You would go off to war and kick ass and come back home when there was no more ass to kick, and be all \u2018hi, I\u2019m back, gimme.\u2019 Tell me you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n I spluttered.\n [\u201cSome things are more important than my life, Seve!\u201d], El\u00edas is shouting, though the low volume just makes him sound faraway and muffled like he\u2019s already lost.\n From the beginning, Seve has said that if she can\u2019t save herself, she\u2019s not worth saving. And this is propaganda, so the story never goes out of its way to correct her. I like that. I like that she\u2019s never needed saving when she couldn\u2019t save herself.\n I don\u2019t like change.\n I want to mute the audio.\n \u201cI\u2019m not that self-centered,\u201d I tell Michel, but my hand is on my pendant and I\u2019ve convinced myself the blood inside is mine. It\u2019s demonstrably not mine, and the DNA will prove it. But still. Still.\n \u201cAdi, can I tell you something, and not get in a fistfight with you in a utility transitway?\u201d\n I\u2019ve never been in a fight with Michel. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n He takes a moment to put the words together. \u201cThe necklace is just a thing, Adi. Get your mom back. Once you have her, you can replace the blood. Anyway, one necklace for one mom is a pretty good trade.\u201d\n Theseus\u2019s pendant. I feel a rush of disagreement. I guess that solves that philosophical riddle for me: I really believe that if you replace all the boards, it\u2019s not the same ship.\n Which means I also believe there\u2019s no way to keep the ship from eventually rotting away.\n I never helped Michel settle his argument, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t come to my own conclusions.\n I think El\u00edas and Seve love each other, but love doesn\u2019t tell you what to do with it. It just shows up like a guest you have to make a bed for, and it puts everything out of order, and it makes demands.\n I don\u2019t hear the rest of the episode.\n I take my time. I breathe through the anger in my gut and the sense, not exhilarating now, of falling. Then, in the evening, I sync up with the colony directions database and do a search for hhaellesh in public areas.\n Five hhaellesh arrived during the Feast of the Return, and two of them aren\u2019t hanging out anywhere that the public cams can see them. One of the ones who is is surrounded by children and a lady who looks like their mother, beaming the whole group of them. Of the other two, one is walking the gardens in the Colony Center Plaza, and the other is . . . familiar.\n I take the monkey\u2019s route, as my father called it. Roof to roof and wall by wall, the colony\u2019s engineered and modified design giving me wings. From the feeds I read, the freerunning spirit everywhere means working with your environment, not against it; you have to take your obstacles as opportunities or you\u2019ll never get anywhere. Literally, at that.\n If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned there and applied to the rest of my life, I\u2019ve yet to learn it.\n I pass over alleys and shopways and along the taut wires that traverse the wide boulevards, the places where parades had been held. People see me, but to them, I\u2019m just motion; just another citizen who takes a hobbyist\u2019s interest in how to get around. Anonymous. Not Aditi, the girl with the hhaellesh mother, the girl with her mother\u2019s blood. They see me as I\u2019m starting to see myself.\n I run harder.\n After my father\u2019s first day of work, he took me to the breadfruit shop. It\u2019s not real breadfruit\u2014it\u2019s some native plant the first colony engineers analyzed and deemed edible; something that looked like a breadfruit to whichever one of them named it\u2014but when it\u2019s processed and mashed it has a texture like firm ice cream and a taste that takes flavorings well. My father and I got bowls full of big, colorful scoops, and asked one of the other patrons to take a picture of us. They did, and said \u201cWelcome to the colony!\u201d We were that obvious.\n We sent the picture to my mother, and that\u2019s where I find her today. Sitting at the table we always tried to get, without any of the breadfruit in front of her. Hhaellesh can eat, but I\u2019m not sure they need to, and I have no idea if they have a sense of taste. You only hear about them eating to accept hospitality.\n There\u2019s a halo of awed silence around her, and I slink through it and take another one of the chairs.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, and I let out a breath. Truth was, until she\u2019d said that, I\u2019d had some doubt that it was her. The hhaellesh all look alike.\n I grumble something. I don\u2019t know how to accept her apology.\n \u201cI haven\u2019t been a good mother,\u201d my war hero says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you want me to start trying now. You\u2019ve done well without me.\u201d\n Yeah, if you want to call it that. I serve the minimum work requirements and spend the rest of my time running across the roofs and up the walls. I haven\u2019t gone out and won any wars in my free time.\n What I\u2019ve done, what they\u2019ll know me for if I touch the history books at all, is that I\u2019ve carried her.\n My fingers itch at the tips. I want to touch the pendant, but I don\u2019t. \u201cHhaellesh don\u2019t have blood, do they?\u201d\n \u201cThe armor substrate carries energy and nutrients,\u201d my mother says. \u201cWe don\u2019t need blood, unless . . . \u201d\n \u201cWhy do you want to be human?\u201d I ask. I don\u2019t want to be human. I want to be more than what I am.\n My mother doesn\u2019t answer that, and the stillness of the armor is the stillness of an alien thing: how am I to read it? Then she seems to answer two questions, my own and one she hasn\u2019t articulated.\n Why don\u2019t you?\n \u201cI think,\u201d she says, and her words are careful, perhaps uncertain. \u201cif you are something, you don\u2019t want it. Does that make sense? Because you are it, you forget ever wanting it. Or, I suppose, it never comes up.\u201d\n I shake my head.\n \u201cI miss being human,\u201d she says. \u201cI miss feeling warm and sleeping in and stretching out sore muscles. I miss holding you. You were so small, when I left.\u201d I think she watches me. \u201cYou regret not being old enough.\u201d\n \u201cOld enough?\u201d I snap. For what? To remember her leaving?\n My mother holds up her hand. \u201cThis lit me up like a candle,\u201d she said, turning those long, precise fingers. \u201cI was a goddess. A fury, a valkyrie. I wanted this. Now I miss being human.\u201d\n I grind my fingertips out against the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the suit, if you\u2019re not using it?\u201d\n My mother lays her hand near mine, which is a disturbingly human gesture coming from something whose hand is a mechanical claw. \u201cIt\u2019ll go into a museum,\u201d she says. \u201cOr on display in one of the Remembrances. I would give it to you if I could.\u201d\n I rear back, at that.\n \u201cAh,\u201d she says, and she can\u2019t smile. There\u2019s nothing on her face to smile. But I get the impression she\u2019s smiling. \u201cYou think I\u2019d say, no, it wasn\u2019t worth it, in the end. I\u2019ve learned my lesson and a human life is the most important thing of all. No.\u201d Her head bends toward the table. \u201cThis is a part of my life; this is me. I will not disavow it. I would give it to you if I could.\u201d\n The colony is white buildings and boulevards, green growing plants, and the searing blue sky. And then there\u2019s the black of the esshesh artillery emplacements, the black edging on the Observances. Red\u2019s not a colony color. Red is primal and messy, like blood.\n When I went to enlist, they took a hard-copy signature in black ink and a handprint biometric signature as well. I wonder what else the biometrics recorded: my anxiety? My anger? The thrumming of my heart in my veins?\n My mother\u2019s hands are cool and pulseless on the table. Black as the artillery. Black as the ink. Black as the space between what stars we see, where the primal brightness of the cosmos has been stretched into infrared by the passage of time.\n I reach behind my neck and fumble with the clasp of my pendant. It takes me a bit to work it out; it\u2019s stayed against my throat through showers and formal occasions and a hospital stay or two, busted ribs and broken legs. Pulling it off makes me feel more naked than taking my clothes off does. But here I am, baring myself in front of this alien who wants more intimacy than I think she deserves.\n \u201cTwo conditions,\u201d I say. And it\u2019s difficult to tell, under the smooth black mask, but I think she\u2019s still watching me and not the blood. I push on ahead. \u201cOne: I want a piece of that armor. Or, I guess, the substrate. Make a pendant out of it.\u201d\n It\u2019s not a replacement for the blood. But it\u2019s not something I\u2019ll be holding in trust: it\u2019s part of my history, now, too, and it\u2019s something that\u2019ll be mine.\n My mother nods.\n I exhale. Red\u2019s no good for the colony anyway. Black\u2019s a bit better, if only because black is the color of the hhaellesh, and the security emplacements which grow fractally more close-packed toward the colony\u2019s borders: the lines we draw around ourselves to protect us from the enemy.\n After Painter, the enemy never set foot on colony land. They\u2019re not the thing that scares me. I\u2019m still figuring out what my enemy is.\n \u201cTwo,\u201d I say. And I\u2019m not sure how to say this next part.\n But those were her words. I\u2019d give it to you if I could.\n \u201cI want your stories,\u201d I tell her.\n An (pronounce it \"On\") Owomoyela is a neutrois author with a background in web development, linguistics, and weaving chain maille out of stainless steel fencing wire, whose fiction has appeared in a number of venues including Clarkesworld, Asimov's, Lightspeed, and a handful of Year's Bests.

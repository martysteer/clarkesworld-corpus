Despite a brisk methane breeze, not a petal nor a stamen of the bright blooms moved. Under an impervious shield, they remained motionless, uncorrupted, altogether untouchable.\n\u201cThey\u2019re alive,\u201d reported the Navy remote viewer. When I was a kid, the idea that the armed services might employ a trained, technologically enhanced psychic would have got you a derisive smack in the ear from your elders and betters, even though the American CIA ran a remote viewing program called Star Gate back in the last century, before they ostentatiously closed it down and took it to black ops. This viewer was blind to light, but saw better than the rest of us, by other means, on a good day. Like me, sort of, in my own itchy way.\nHe stood at the edge of the huge, flower-bedecked vessel, gloved, open palms held outward, his hands vibrating ever so slightly, like insect antennae hunting a pheromone. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Those blossoms are still alive, after . . . what . . . millions of years? I can\u2019t find my way in yet, but I can detect that much even through the stationary shield.\u201d\n\u201cIs that the same as a, you know, stasis field?\u201d I asked the marine master sergeant standing guard beside us. I turned to face her, and bobbed sickeningly. Two days ago I had been on Ganymede, and on Earth\u2019s Moon before that. Now I walked on another world entirely, around yet another world entirely. It wasn\u2019t right for a man as ample as I to weigh so little, especially with Titan\u2019s bruised-peach air pushing down on me half again as heavily as Earth\u2019s. It went against nature. Even with the bodyglove wrapping me, and an air tank on my back, I only weighed about eighteen kilos\u2014say forty lbs. A tenth of what the scales would show back home.\n\u201c\u2018Stasis\u2019 my ass! That\u2019s sci-fi nonsense,\u201d she barked. \u201cMedia technobabble. Like your own\u2014\u201d She bit the rest of her sentence off, perhaps fortunately. \u201cThis here is hard science.\u201d\n\u201cSo sorry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd please don\u2019t speak again without an invitation to do so, Sensei Park. We don\u2019t want to put Mr. Meagle off his stroke.\u201d\nOpening his startlingly blue, blind eyes, the Navy viewer laughed. The sound echoed oddly in his bodyglove and through our sound loop. All sounds did, out on the orange-snowy surface of Titan. \u201cLet him natter on, Marion. I\u2019m entangled now. You\u2019d have to cut my head off and pith my spine to unhook me from this baby.\u201d\nI wondered idly how either of them would respond if I told them I was the reason, or at least the proximate occasion, that they were here. They\u2019d regard me as a madman, probably. My role in developing the portage functor was under cover about as deep as any since the creation of the US Office of Strategic Services in 1945, long before CIA got tight with clairvoyants. Perhaps these people already did consider me deluded. Yeah, it was true that I\u2019d told them where to look for the starship, but it wasn\u2019t as if I had the credentials of a remote viewer, so undoubtedly it was just a fluke. Right.\nI felt the pressure of the thing, its causal gravitas, as I gazed down at the starship. If that\u2019s what it was, under its stationary shield and floral tribute.\nThis thing on Titan had been tugging at me, at my absurd and uncomfortable and highly classified gift, since I was four or five years old, running in the streets of Seoul, playing with a Red Devils soccer ball and picking up English and math. A suitable metaphor for the way a child might register the substrate of a mad universe, and twist its tail. My own son, little Song-Dam, plagued me with questions when he, too, was a kid, no older than I\u2019d been when the starship buried under tons of frozen methane and ethane had plucked for the first time at my stringy loops.\n\u201cIf light\u2019s a wave, Daddy, can I surf on it?\u201d Brilliant, lovely child! \u201cNo, darling son,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, not exactly. It\u2019s more like a Mexican football wave, it\u2019s more like an explosion of excitement that blows up.\u201d I pulled a big-eyed face and flung my arms in the air and dropped them down. \u201cBoom!\u201d Song laughed, but then his mouth drooped. \u201cIf it\u2019s a wave, Dad, why do some people say it\u2019s made of packets?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cyou know that a football wave is made of lots and lots of team supporters, jumping up and sitting down again.\u201d He wasn\u2019t satisfied, and neither was I, but the kid was only five years old.\nLater, I thought of that wave, sort of not there at all at one end, then plumping up in the middle, falling to nothing again as it moved on. Follow it around the bleachers and you\u2019ve got a waveform particle moving fast. Kind of. But for a real photon, you needn\u2019t follow it, it\u2019s already there, its onboard time is crushed and compressed from the moment of launch to the final absorption, just one instantaneous blip in a flattened, timeless universe. Why, you could jump to the Moon, or Ganymede, or even Titan, all in a flash. Just entangle yourself with it, if you knew how (as I showed them how, much later), like Mr. Meagle remote viewing his impenetrable stationary starship.\nPhysics\u2014you\u2019re soaking in it!\n\u201cI can likely get more now sitting in my relaxation cell back at Huygens,\u201d Meagle said. He looked very calm, as if he\u2019d just stepped out of an immersion tank, but there was a faint quivering around his blind eyes. I watched his face in my viewmask, as if neither of us wore gloves over our heads. The man was exhausted. \u201cSo tell me, Mr. Park,\u201d he said, as we turned and made our way to the big-wheeled jitney, \u201cwhat were your own impressions, sir?\u201d Scrupulous about not front-loading me with hints of his own; I liked that.\n\u201cAnyone, or any thing, who loves flowers that much,\u201d I said judiciously, \u201ccan\u2019t be all bad.\u201d\nHuygens had provided me with a customized broad-beamed sanitary personal; I have authoritative hams, and a wide stance. It degloved me with slick efficiency. I relieved myself with a gratified sigh. While bodygloves have the capacity to handle such impositions of the mortal order, the experience is undignified and leaves a residual aroma trapped inside with one\u2019s nostrils, so I tend to hold on. We had been outside for hours without a pit stop. The sanitary squirted and dabbed, removed sweat from my perspiring hide with its dry tongue, dusted powder across the expanse, set me free. I dressed in my usual unflattering robe, and made my way directly to the commissary bubble. I was starving.\nBanally, the wall&ceiling display showed a faux of thrice-magnified Saturn, four hand-widths across, tilted optimally to show off the gorgeous ring system. I\u2019d just seen the reality outside, with nothing between me and the ringed planet itself but a protective film and a million or so kilometers of naked space above the bright Xanadu regional surface where we\u2019d stood. Since we were almost at the equator, Saturn\u2019s belt had been a thin glitter in the photomultipliers in our bodyglove masks (and would be invisible to the naked eye), directly overhead, right and left of the primary\u2019s waist, not truly impressive. Of course, even with the high frequency step-downs of the photomultipliers, the atmosphere looks hazy anyway.\nThis magisterial feed on the wall was probably coming, today, from one of the polar sats keeping an eye on the big feller. It seemed to me a bit tacky, a lame pretence, but then again, Titan is tidally locked, so it must get a tad wearying for the regular staff, seeing exactly the same thing in the sky forever, whatever installation dome you\u2019re at, Huygens, or Herschel at the north pole. Except that nothing is ever the same; all is nuance, the slow fortnightly progression of light and shade, the phases of the Sun\u2019s illumination of the big ball of gas . . . Well, these were scientists and military, most of them, what could one expect?\nI loaded my tray with rather edible boeuf bourguignon from the dedicated cuisine printer, took it to a table where a handful of my new colleagues were chowing and jawing away, sat down at the spare place, set to after a genial glance around. At least with the queasy low gravity I wasn\u2019t worried that this spindly conventional chair would give way abruptly beneath me, tipping my considerable butt ungraciously to the floor. It had been known to happen back on Earth. Nobody laughed derisively if it did, at least there was that. Not any more, they didn\u2019t.\n\u201cWhy, Sensei,\u201d said the Japanese biologist, Natasha Hsai, with the slightest edge in her tone, \u201cwon\u2019t you join us for dinner?\u201d I do not give her title, nor do I mean any disrespect; all these eggheads had at least a couple of doctorates apiece, it went without saying.\n\u201cWhy, Natasha, thank you, I believe I will.\u201d I started in on my second pearl onion. \u201cGood fare, they don\u2019t stint you\u2014nor should they, you are doing sterling work out here.\u201d\nSeveral of the boffins shared glances, perhaps amused. They fancy themselves a cut above.\nThe handsome dark-haired fellow at the head of the table cleared his throat. \u201cSo, have you been outside yet to pay your respects to the Enigma, Mr. Park?\u201d\nFrom the dossiers I\u2019d memorized before leaving Jupiter space, I recognized him, beneath his heavy straggled beard, as the head of molecular engineering, Antonio Caetani. \u201cJust got back from the tour, Dr. Caetani. Fascinating. Right up my street.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s Tony,\u201d he said gracelessly. More glances flickered about the table. He chose to go right for it. Had to give him points for that. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, your street is paved with donations from the ID Institute.\u201d\nI had encountered this kind of feral attitude previously, of course, especially from hard-headed scientists of conventional stamp. I could even share a kind of empathy for his rancor. It was as if, from his highly-credentialed point of view, a government-sponsored raving crackpot were to be imposed on his team. As if a SETI astronomer in the Fermi Taskforce had been obliged to include a rectally-probed UFO abductee, or a global proteome program forced to sign up a fundamentalist creationist. I shrugged.\n\u201cOh, give the guy a break, Tony,\u201d said the Iranian artifact expert, Mansour Khosrojerdi. \u201cLet him eat his meal.\u201d His beard was darker and thicker even than Caetani\u2019s. Granted, the temperature was nearly minus two hundred degrees Celsius on the other side of the bubble, but this was self-mythologizing on a preposterous scale. Did they imagine they were rehearsing the doomed expeditions of the Arctic explorers? \u201cWe can postpone the ideological catfights until after the cheese and amontillado.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to spare my delicate sensibilities,\u201d I said with a hearty laugh, and reached for the carafe of red wine, luminous as a garnet under spurious golden Saturn light. The woman to my right, the string loop specialist Jendayi Shumba, got there first with her competent, chunky hand, dark as night.\n\u201cAllow me, Sensei Park.\u201d\n\u201cYou are gracious, thanks. But let\u2019s all be friends, no need for formality, call me Myeong-hui.\u201d I grinned with big teeth at her dismay, then laughed out loud. \u201cNo, that\u2019s an impossible mouthful, it\u2019s all right, just call me Sam, love. Everyone does.\u201d\n\u201cSam.\u201d A slightly uncomfortable silence fell. Scrapings of plastic flatware on realistic plates. I gobbled up my tasty beef, placed the empty plate back on my tray, slurped off some more of the stunningly convincing compiled shiraz, took a bite of a lemon-ginger dessert to die for, decorated with pistachios. \u201cFermi-53, that\u2019s my considered opinion,\u201d I said with my mouth full. \u201cMy tentative, preliminary opinion, naturally.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no recognizable roses or jonquils or violets or orchids, obviously. But the flowers scattered over the vehicle certainly do appear to be derived from Earth angiosperms, specialized to a range of climates and coevolutionary biomes,\u201d said Natasha Hsai. \u201cSo far as we can tell purely from visual inspection.\u201d\n\u201cWhich rules out Fermi-53 instantly,\u201d Antonio Caetani said. \u201cBlossoms of such complexity and beauty did not evolve on Earth until the Holocene. Probably not until humans deliberately bred the cultivars during the rise of agriculture.\u201d\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s not oversimplify, Tony,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cPollinator insects and hummers and lizards and all the rest, they speciated along with the angiosperms; they sculpted each other without any help. Yes, I grant you, early humans broke up the soil to an unprecedented extent so they could grow their dinner, and then as a sideline retained and cultivated those blossoms that especially . . . well, made them happy. They\u2019re our botanical pets, now, because flowers make us smile and feel good. They induce positive emotions.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re scented sex organs,\u201d Caetani said, \u201cdoing their job.\u201d\nI\u2019d finished eating, for the moment. \u201cThe first flowering plants,\u201d I pointed out, \u201cevolved sixty-five million years prior to the Chicxulub catastrophe. Nice symmetry, that.\u201d As far back in time before the extinction of the dinosaurs as we now stood after it. I didn\u2019t need to spell that out; these were, after all, highly trained intellects. But I had to add the obvious, the intolerable, the all-but-unthinkable crux. \u201cHumans, I remind you, were not the only cultivators.\u201d I found I had no appetite for cheese, and pushed back my chair. \u201cDo you allow smoking here? Anyone for cigars and port?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Caetani brusquely. \u201cSensei Park, we are scientists, not mystagogues. I confess myself bewildered by your presence at Huygens.\u201d Jendayi Shumba pulled at his sleeve; he shook her off. \u201cI am frankly offended that the Imperium invited a quack from the Intelligent Dinosaur Institute here to Titan.\u201d Shumba kicked his leg under the table; I saw and felt the small causal shock of her intention and its manifestation, because that\u2019s who I am, that\u2019s what I do. \u201cI have nothing more to say to you.\u201d He looked away disdainfully, drew his own dessert plate in front of him, scooped up a heaping spoonful of tiramisu and shoved it into his left eye, hard.\nI raised one eyebrow, sighed, and rose, gathered my soiled crockery and plasticware on the tray, and walked away from the table. He probably wouldn\u2019t lose the sight in his eye. But what could I do?\nSpeaking technically, I\u2019m an etiological distortion. Less pompously, there\u2019s something buried deep inside me that screws with cause and effect. I\u2019m a footloose bubble of improbability. Call me a witch or a freak if you\u2019d prefer, it rolls more easily off the tongue. Chances are good, though, that if you do call me nasty names, and I get to hear about it, you\u2019ll trip over the kid\u2019s bike in the dark, or run into an opening door, and break something painful. It\u2019s not that I harbor resentment at name-calling, but my unconscious seems to. As I say, not much I can do about that, sorry.\nThere were ructions and alarums but I brushed them off, went to bed and slept, as I had done every night for five years, like a damned soul. My gift or curse does not permit me to stand aside from that which wraps me like a shroud. Sorrow eddied in my dreams. My son\u2014\n\u2014and as so often, these days, the booming, tolling voices came to me from a century and a half past, voices I have heard only in my head, reading their words on the pages of old books I found in an abandoned library, stinking with the reek of extinguished fires, where I had crept for silence like a heavy old dog with a wound too great to bear. The words were in English, that tongue almost as familiar to me as my own, picked up in the streets, later honed in special classes for promising children. I knew nothing of the writer, save that he was a man of substance in his place and time. His words raised a resonance in my burned soul. He must have known this same agony, and sought some bitter draught of comfort:\nO Sorrow, cruel fellowship,\nO Priestess in the vaults of Death,\nO sweet and bitter in a breath,\nWhat whispers from thy lying lip?\n\u201cThe stars,\u201d she whispers, \u201cblindly run;\nA web is wov\u2019n across the sky;\nFrom out waste places comes a cry,\nAnd murmurs from the dying sun:\n\u201cAnd all the phantom, Nature, stands\u2014\nWith all the music in her tone,\nA hollow echo of my own,\u2014\nA hollow form with empty hands.\u201d\nAnd woke in the morning (by the conventional Earth clock calibrated to Seoul time, GMT+9 hours), as always alone, empty hollow form and all, despite the web wov\u2019n palpably across the sky, and ravenously hungry, as usual.\nSo I ate a healthy breakfast and went to watch Meagle on closed circuit, a feed from the audiovisual record that military remote viewers are obliged to make for assessment, interpretation, and the archive. Today he sat zazen in a small cell like a non-denominational chapel, if chapels come with voice-activated holography displays (and maybe they do, I\u2019m not a religious man), hands curled upward on his knees. His breathing was slow, regular. Maybe this was what their protocol called cooling down. His blind eyes were open, apparently fixed on the deep blue depths of the holly. Upon his head was a crown of thorns, a tidy maze of squid detectors pulsing to the quantum state of his brain, his brain stem, his meditative consciousness.\n\u201cLooking at the vehicle from above,\u201d he murmured. \u201cStill can\u2019t find my way in. Yet.\u201d His lips quirked the smallest amount. Who Dares Wins, I thought. Semper Fi. Rah-rah. Well, it took a lot of quiet confidence in one\u2019s oddball abilities, no doubt. My own kind of disreputable ability just happened to me, or around me.\n\u201cGet back to the signal line,\u201d a gravelly voice said. Someone not in the room. His controller, I supposed. His operator, whatever they called the role.\n\u201cHe\u2019s physically blind, I realize that,\u201d I told the medical officer seated beside me in the observation booth, \u201cbut doesn\u2019t knowing the identity of the target sort of pollute his, his guesswork?\u201d\n\u201cThe viewer does not guess.\u201d\n\u201cNo offense. I mean, bias him unconsciously with preconceived notions?\u201d Front-loading, they called it; I knew that much. \u201cLike that stasis field thingee? Can we be sure that\u2019s not some scrap of nonsense from a comic strip he read when he was a child?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Meagle is well past all such neophyte hazards,\u201d the nurse said, offended by my uppity kvetching. He had gray hair at his close-cropped temples, and a steady gaze. Almost certainly a veteran of the war in\u2014 I shut that thought down, hard. \u201cThe colonel can afford to depart from the lock-step of traditional protocol. As he does when it suits him.\u201d I nodded, made soothing, conciliatory sounds. Perhaps mollified, he explained, \u201cIt contracts the search path.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d I said, and settled back to view the sketched images form, dissolve, reform in the imaginary three-space of the holograms. As Meagle\u2019s fingers moved through the air, unseen lasers tracked the shapes he sketched. It seemed, watching him, that he actually felt his way around the starship out there in the frozen crust of Titan. Kinesthetic imagery. A kind of heightened physicality, perhaps unavailable to a sighted person. Or was that nothing better than my whimsy, my fat man\u2019s sentimentality?\n\u201cMoving downward, gravity tugs at me,\u201d the remote viewer murmured. His voice was drowsy. I saw his shoulders spasm, as if he were falling forward and had caught himself.\n\u201cWake up, there, colonel,\u201d the voice said, without reproach. \u201cYou\u2019re drifting.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s sliding into Phase Two. That was hypnic myoclonia,\u201d the nurse commented. \u201cJactitation.\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t slept since yesterday,\u201d Meagle muttered. He shook himself. \u201cOkay. Got it. I\u2019m in.\u201d\nThe screens, trying to emulate whatever it was the psychic was \u201cseeing/feeling,\u201d bloomed with a burst of visual noise. Were those things sketchy blocks of cells, like the hexagonal innards of a bee hive? They shrank, jittered, smoothed into a kind of curvy passageway. The image was being enhanced by the computer\u2019s analysis, drawing on an archive of Meagle\u2019s private symbols.\n\u201cAnalytical overlay,\u201d the operator said in a tone of admonition.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014 No, this\u2019s what I\u2019m actually perceiving. My God, Charley, the place is so fucking old. Millions of years. Tens of millions.\u201d\n\u201cGive me some Stage Three.\u201d\n\u201cWeirdly beautiful, man. But alien. Not insects, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d The overlapping images loped along, as if from a camera mounted on a cartoon\u2019s shoulder. Is this how the blind imagines seeing? Meagle had been sightless from birth, the dossier had informed me. But maybe that shouldn\u2019t be surprising; the blind repurpose the cortical and precortical tissues specialized by evolution for visual capture and registration\u2014the large dedicated occipital lobe, the striate V1 cortex, all the way up the V hierarchy to middle temporal MT, pathways carrying neural trains from the retina to the brain, interpreting, pruning as they flashed their specialized code. Yada yada. His sensitive, trained brain had nabbed that spare capacity, retained its function, modified its input channels. The Marvel That Is Your Brain! I overheard my own mocking subliminal commentary and wondered why I was so anxious, suddenly. A kind of curdling in the causal webs . . . I felt more and more uncomfortable, as if I badly needed to take a dump. Maybe I did. Meagle had fallen silent. Dropping off to sleep again? No, the constructed image was sliding past us in the hologram, slurring and breaking up in detail, but it was a corridor he walked along, in his spirit walk or whatever you call it.\nSomething sitting in a large padded chair. Christ!\n\u201cChrist!\u201d Meagle cried, loudly. Small indicator lights went from placid green to blipping yellow on one display. A histogram surfed briefly into the red. The nurse was clicking keys, fast and unrattled.\n\u201cBingo, Colonel,\u201d said the operator, triumph shaking his professional sangfroid.\nMy etiological sense scrambled. I lurched up, leaned forward, ready to puke. Meagle was doing the same, cable tangled at his neck, contacts pulling from his cropped scalp. In the great chair shown on the screen, as the imaginary viewpoint swung about, the interpretative computer sketched a seated person with a snout and deep-set hooded eyes, clawed hands gripping banked controls on the arm rests.\nThe image skittered and jittered, revised itself as the causal whirlpool screeched around me. But no, this wasn\u2019t the dragon I was looking for. It was, it wasn\u2019t. The machine image spoke directly to me through Meagle and memory. That dead person, that ancient thing in its ancient warship, it was . . . was . . . Impossible. Delusion and grief. Something else. I knew the beloved face beyond denial, of course, like a clumsy pencil drawing on the screen that tore my heart out. Human. Face burned down in places to the bone, gaze suffering, mouth mute, determined even in death. In his stained UN uniform, with Korean Imperium lieutenant flashes at the collar.\n\u201cOh, lord god,\u201d I moaned, and did barf, then, like a puling schoolboy drunk.\nFrom the corner of my leaking eyes, in the window feed from his RV cell, I saw Meagle turn convulsively. He seemed to stare right at me, through the camera, into the display, with his blue, blind eyes.\nThe main hologram image, too, looked steadfastly back at me\u2014sketched from the Naval remote viewer\u2019s words and speaking hands, his brain rhythms, the archived set of his stereotypical ideograms\u2014looked at me from a grave five years dug in the soil.\nSong-Dam. My son. My poor boy. My lost hero child.\nI started to cry, wiping at my bitter mouth, and couldn\u2019t stop.\nHuygens is not part of the Imperium, of course, being a research agora, like Herschel, the other settlement on Titan, but it is a fiscal affiliate of Korea, as well as of Zimbabwe, the Brazilian Superstate, Camp Barsoom (on, you guessed it, Mars), and a handful of other polises on the Moon and Ganymede. So while the writ of Mr. Kim, my sponsor, did not run on Titan, precisely, his paternal hand was heavily in the weighing scales. The Warlord had developed a fondness for the Intelligent Dinosaur paradigm when he studied paleontology as a young student in Antarctica, where all the equivocal evidence was located prior to the Enigma\u2019s excavation, and he carried that interest through into maturity and, some said, senility. He would be pleased as punch.\nDr. Caetani, surprise, surprise, was not. Everyone by now had studied the remote viewing session, and more than once. My participation and role could be determined only by inference, since no recorders had been trained on the observation room. But the recording of Meagle\u2019s results showed plainly the results: the alien or saurian and, moments later, the harrowing superimposed image of my late son. For Caetani, I\u2019m sure, my distress, my involvement, was just a piece of hammy theatrics, a shameful way to spray my mark onto an historic event.\n\u201cThis afternoon, we know nothing more than we did a week ago,\u201d he stated bluntly. \u201cI\u2019m candidly dismayed at the gullibility of some of my colleagues here.\u201d\n\u201cThe saurian\u2014\u201d began Jendayi Shumba. He cut her off instantly.\n\u201c\u2014the image was no more veridical than the, the disturbed imposition into the colonel\u2019s entangled state of Sensei Park\u2019s tragic fixation on his son\u2019s death. Nobody doubts that Mr. Park is a functioning poltergeist, capable of casting images and interfering with complex electronic systems. It\u2019s why he\u2019s here\u2014over my objections\u2014and isn\u2019t the point.\u201d He took a deep breath, his features flushed behind that pretentious beard. \u201cOur visitor\u2019s martyred son is certainly not aboard that Jurassic artifact, and surely nobody thinks he is. Neither, by the same token, is the dinosaur space captain that Mr. Park\u2019s well-prepped imagination also dreamed up and shoveled into the ideospace.\u201d\n\u201cWith all due respect, you\u2019re out of your depth, Tony.\u201d This one I hadn\u2019t met before, an industrial psychiatrist named Lionel Berger. \u201cBack off, will you? Remote viewing is no exact science, nor even an accomplished art\u2014and I mean no disrespect to Colonel Meagle in pointing this out. We don\u2019t know how it works, except that quantum field nonlocality is engaged and implemented by an act of deliberation. Its famous vulnerability is that other minds can become trapped into the entanglement and add their own measures of information . . . but whether that aggregate data is veridical, symbolic, mythological or sheer phantasy, we can\u2019t tell just by simple inspection. Dismissing this evidence by flinging about words like \u2018psychic\u2019 and \u2018poltergeist\u2019 is argument by slur. I\u2019m prepared to wait for more evidence before I decide so confidently what\u2019s inside that vessel.\u201d\nCaetani, the surly fellow, actually said, \u201cBah!\u201d I\u2019d never heard anyone actually say that before. Others spoke, in their turn; Meagle sat at the back, his blind eyes closed, sunk into a sort of exhausted torpor. I\u2019d have liked to go to him, sit beside him in respectful and sorrowing silence. Instead, as requested, I also remained silent, half-listening to the academese, the scholasticism, the stochasticism, the loop theories of cognitive restructuration.\nI had seen my dead son.\nI had seen the saurian sitting in his great chair, or hers.\nIf cause is a pool of chaos and order blended by intention and brute event, I am (and nobody, as yet, has managed to explain why it is so) a small stick of dynamite exploding up random fishy critters to the shore. Brrrr . . . That\u2019s a macabre, self-lacerating image. It had been my boy Song who perished in mindless explosions, and not by my hand. But hadn\u2019t I sent him into fatal danger? Into ultimate harm\u2019s way? Of course I had. Not by urging or forbidding, in so many words, but in my reckless skepticism, my louche lack of patriotism. Which had fetched us up where? Him, smashed like a detonated fish in a pool he could not escape, did not wish to escape. Me, bereft, alone, my bond to my nation long ago broken and betrayed. I grunted aloud, hoisted myself into a less uncomfortable position on a seat too small, as usual, for my girth.\n\u201cSam? You wanted to say something?\u201d\nI looked around. They were gazing at me expectantly. \u201cOh, nothing. What can I donate that hasn\u2019t already been weighed and found wanting?\u201d It was petty and self-regarding, and I snapped my mouth shut, but a fierce anger burst up in me anyway, so I opened it again. \u201cI\u2019ll say one thing. And make no apologies for it. We are here,\u201d I swung one arm through an embracing arc, taking in the auditorium, the station, Titan, \u201cbecause years ago, when I was still on Earth, I discerned a causal anomaly near this place. We are here because military and independent remote viewers on three worlds concurred in finding and describing the vehicle. We are here, therefore, driven by the many motives that arose from that discovery. But I insist that the principal occasion is Premier Kim\u2019s wish to test the hypotheses forwarded by the scientific entity I represent.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cSo far as I can see, what Colonel Meagle uncovered this morning corroborates precisely the predictions of the Intelligent Dinosaur Institute. If my presence has muddied your waters, I\u2019m sorry\u2014but again I remind you, if it were not for me, none of you would be here today.\n\u201cSo lay the hell off, okay?\u201d\nI dug in my robe\u2019s pocket, found a Mars bar, unpeeled it, and gobbled it down.\nShortly after Song-Dam\u2019s eighth birthday\u2014his mother long since escaped back into the whorehouse alleys she and I had both come from\u2014I took him with me on a business trip to Palo Alto. I was the object of the business trip, my absurd gift, my poltergeist prowess with cause and effect. Several Stanford biophysics researchers had somehow picked up trash journalism stories about me as the luckiest/unluckiest man on earth. Funding was limited, but I convinced them that Song was in my sole charge and that I wasn\u2019t budging without him.\nSo we took an exhausting flight from Incheon International across the Pacific and through the absurd indignities of US Homeland Security (despite a graduate student being on hand at the airport to collect us, now cooling his heels in the arrival lounge with a wilting cardboard sign in two languages; I had inadvertently set off various bells and whistles, so of course we were detained pointlessly, until one of the senior professors was persuaded to drive to the airport and vouch for us), and stayed in an anonymous, ugly block of apartments that seemed to have been compiled from polyurethane pretending to be marble. We could hear the dreary TV set next door through the adjoining wall.\nI took Song for a long walk so he and I could get a feel for the alien place, this America, as we stretched our weary legs. Within three blocks (trust my causal eddies for once), we found a Korean food store, established that my parents\u2019 modest residence in Nangok\u2014back at the turn of the century when it was still a squalid slum in a hilly area of Sillim-dong, Gwanak District\u2014was just spitting distance from the proprietors\u2019 familial stamping grounds, and found ourselves dragged happily to a nearby park by Mr. Kwon\u2019s wife and three kids to fly dragon kites in the cool afternoon breeze.\nI helped Song play out the string. Our borrowed kite was a scarlet and gold Dragon Diamond (a gift to us both, as it turned out\u2014and thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Kwon!). Our dragon quivered on the middle air a moment, strained against his leash, then suddenly flung himself upward into the deepening blue California sky. The line went taut. Song let it go in fright, but I held tight, and a moment later he put his hands back to the winch reel beside mine. I saw the line stretched between my hand, his small resolute hands, and the high, swooping, flower-bright dragon: a luminous string.\n\u201cDaddy, look!\u201d said my son, wild with excitement. \u201cOur dragon is flying on a beam of photons!\u201d\nAt that moment, as if Buddha had smacked me in the ear, I was enlightened.\n\u201cI think I can get in,\u201d I told the Director of Operations, a tight jawed fellow named Namgoong, almost certainly a political appointee but in secure possession of a decent scientific reputation with degrees in geology and astrobiology. Earth and sky, I thought, but hid my smile. \u201cI think I can break the shield. The question is, do I dare?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Precisely. If you rupture the stationary shield, who knows what might seep out into the atmosphere.\u201d He gave me a thin-lipped smile. \u201cFortunately, Sensei, we shall not have to wait three years for an Environmental Impact Study. The Imperium wants this thing opened. Now. It\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, sir, I\u2019m more worried about what might seep in. They must have sealed it against Titan\u2019s atmosphere for good reason.\u201d\n\u201cA motive that expired millions of years ago.\u201d He rose. \u201cI\u2019m having a containment dome erected around the locus. There\u2019s no way we can establish blockade underneath the ice as well, but this will meet most likely challenges. Or so I\u2019m assured.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved to hear it.\u201d I belatedly heaved up my bulk. \u201cWhen will you want me out there?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be advised. We have a full scale colloquium scheduled, starting at two. I\u2019ll expect you to be there, Sensei Park, and on your best behavior. No more outbursts, if you please.\u201d\n\u201cMore damned chin-wagging. Science used to be an empirical exercise,\u201d I grumbled.\n\u201cLed by theory, as I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d He was standing at his door, and I went out, biting my lip. Nobody had the faintest starting point for a theory to explain my causal distortions, and not much to account for the photon-entangled portage functor. I could do it, I could show them a method for using it (and had), but I didn\u2019t have a theory-empowered clue how or why. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s mutant superman, that much I do know. (Or is that just a fat man\u2019s self-doubt speaking?)\nPostmodern science, as far as I can tell looking in from the outside, is drunk on the sound of its own voice. But yes, I know: look who\u2019s complaining. I recalled again that Victorian sage, that poet Tennyson. He had it right: I sometimes hold it half a sin to put in words the grief I feel; for words, like Nature, half reveal and half conceal the Soul within. But, for the unquiet heart and brain, a use in measured language lies; the sad mechanic exercise, like dull narcotics, numbing pain. I followed Dr. Namgoong along the narrow compiled corridors of Huygens station, so like those awful domiciles on the outskirts of Palo Alto, and went to hear the sad mechanics exercise their tongues and dull their pain, and maybe mine.\nThe circulated air was pungent, despite the scrubbers, with the musk of excited animals crowded together. A schematic chart I\u2019d grown familiar with, these last few months, started displaying on the auditorium wall, replacing the magnified image of Saturn\u2019s glorious tilted hat. The Fermi Paradox Solution candidates. My eye bounced off them, falling down a cliff of words and logic with no footing in reality beyond the dragon-haunted thing outside the dome:\nWhere are They?\nFermi 1. They are here among us, and call themselves Koreans.\nThat always got a satisfied titter, except from any Hungarians in the crowd.\nFermi 2. They are here, running things.\nA chance for the Hungarians, and anyone else chafing under the Imperium, to get their own back with a belly laugh. No giggles here, though, I noticed.\nFermi 3. They came and left.\nBingo, I thought. They came and left flowers scattered in their wake. Strictly, though, that was Fermi 53, the only choice left. The ancient intelligent dinosaur hypothesis.\nFermi 6. We are interdicted.\nFermi 10. They are still on their way here.\nThe starship had blown that one, and others like it, clear out of the water. Time to trim the list, methinks.\nFermi 21. They\u2019re listening, only fools are transmitting.\nFermi 22. Dedicated killer machines destroy everything that moves, anywhere in space.\nFermi 28. The Vingean Singularity takes them . . . elsewhere.\nNo Singularity back near the end of the Cretaceous, I thought. Judging by the remote viewer\u2019s sketches, that saurian pilot was advanced, but not sufficiently advanced as to be indistinguishable from magic.\nFermi 38. Earth is the optimal place for life, just by chance.\nCould be. And for intelligent life, at that. Hey, look, we\u2019ve seen it twice: the smart dinosaurs and Homo sap.\nFermi 48. Language is vanishingly rare.\nHa! Yeah, right. Blah blah blah. Still, maybe so. The skies are awfully silent, which is where we came in . . .\nFermi 49. Science is a rare accident.\nNot as rare as I am, I thought, touching the etiological chains and vortices all around\u2014and no scientist ever predicted me. Most of them still didn\u2019t even know about me, thanks to all those Above Top Secret restrictions. Damn it.\nNamgoong cleared his throat at the podium. Voices, in clumps and then one by one, fell silent. Hey, maybe that\u2019s it. God tapped His microphone, and the cosmos shut up to listen. And they\u2019re still listening, bent and cowed by the awfulness of what they heard. But not us, we haven\u2019t heard from God yet, despite a thousand revelations claimed and proclaimed. Or if we have, there\u2019s no way to search through the babbling noise and extract the divine signal. Funny way to run a universe.\nI could feel the dinosaur calling to me, even so, through the appalling cold of Titan\u2019s snows and the void of fifty or a hundred million years. And the entwined memory of my son, sacrificed for nothing. Nothing. Nothing.\n\u201cThose are the classic guesses\u2014most of them wrong.\u201d The Director flicked his finger; the display went to blank gray. \u201cWe still have no idea why the galaxy, indeed the universe as a whole, is quiet. Why the stars are still shining, spilling out their colossal energy resources, when intelligence should be collecting it. Calculations you\u2019re all familiar with prove that a single intelligent species arising anywhere in the galaxy within the last billion years would by now have colonized all its trillion stars and associated bodies, turned the sky black with Matrioshka shells\u2014or perhaps obliterated the stars in vast, wasteful wars.\u201d\nI pricked up my ears. A political subtext? Perhaps not; maybe our director was just a tone-deaf drone. I glanced around; several people near me had dropped their eyes, more than one held fists clenched tight. Okay.\n\u201cOne of the equally classic Great Filters must screen out potential intelligent life and leave the heavens exactly as they\u2019d have to be if there is no life at all out there. No intelligent, starfaring life, anyway.\n\u201cSo now we\u2019re faced with a new paradox. Fermi remains unanswered\u2014and yet we have this old vehicle made by beings not of our own species, but apparently related. The likelihood of that coincidence being due to chance alone is impossibly small. I see only three remaining possibilities.\u201d\n\u201cBarney did it,\u201d someone called, muted but clear across the room. A wave of tittering. I felt my jaw tighten, and a flush creep into my cheeks.\n\u201cA previous civilization sprung from dinosaur stock on Cretaceous Earth, or even earlier, yes,\u201d said Dr. Namgoog evenly. \u201cThe opinion represented here today by our guest, Sensei Park.\u201d\nA pattering of polite applause, some even more muted groans.\n\u201cWe have evidence in the form of preliminary scans by our Naval remote viewer, Colonel Meagle, that the creature . . . the being, forgive me . . . in charge of the craft has just such an origin. Leaving aside the improbability of parallel evolution. If so, this leaves the earlier and larger Fermi question unanswered: where are its kindred now, why haven\u2019t they conquered the whole galaxy? Tipler and others proved decades ago that this could have been achieved at plausible sub-light speeds within a million years. If they have, why don\u2019t we see them?\u201d\nHearing it stated so flatly, I was dizzied, as always, by the prospect. Flotillas of starcraft fleeing into the spiral arms at a tenth of light speed, crammed with dragon seed or our own. Or minute nanoscale pods fired toward a hundred million stars by magnetic catapult, or driven on filmy wings by laser light. Yet these, too, were last year\u2019s dreams, last century\u2019s. We had stepped from Earth to Ganymede to Titan entangled on a light beam, and without waiting to be shoved here by sailboat. The moment entangled luminal portage became a reality for my own species, it opened the yawning cavern: why not for them, as well? What the hell was a starship doing here? Why bother? It was so last week, like finding a steam locomotive under the ice.\nNamgoog was enunciating his other solutions to Fermi, but I didn\u2019t care. I was entranced by the mystery of the sleeping creature, sedate under his bedding of live flowers. It was a hunger like my endless appetite for chow. I wanted to step straight through the damned shell of the ship and look the critter in the eye, man to man. Even if it decided to eat me.\nThat\u2019s what dragons do, isn\u2019t it?\nAnd so to bed. Where I lay in the dark in a lather of fright for fifteen minutes. Fearful and weak. Bleak. Needing a leak. I climbed out and thudded to the sanitary personal. When I got back, after a swab up and down and across with a wet face cloth to dab away the worse of the flopsweat, my door was slightly open. Through it came the never-stopping background clanging and banging of humans and machines keeping the place ticking over. Snapping my fingers, I clicked the room light up to dim. Dr. Jendayi Shumba, chubby string looper, stretched at ease on my bed, clad in sensible pajamas with a mission blaze on the collar. Of course, I jumped and squealed.\n\u201cWhat the\u2014 Is there some\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHush up, dear man, and come over here.\u201d She grinned.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not serious. Are you?\u201d\nIn evidence, she slithered out of her pjs and raised her eyebrows.\n\u201cAbsurd. I\u2019d crush you like a bug.\u201d\n\u201cMyeong-hui, you don\u2019t weigh any more, here, than my little boy.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a\u2014?\u201d I swallowed, and crept closer. \u201cI had a son once.\u201d\n\u201cLet us be in this moment, Sensei,\u201d she said without reproach.\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusting to look upon,\u201d I said frankly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need a pity\u2014\u201d\nShe had her fingers across my mouth, and then pulled me down through several clunky jumpy evolutions. \u201cThere are other ways to convey one\u2019s . . . intimacy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cUlp,\u201d I protested.\n\u201cAn easy mouth is a great thing on a long journey, is it not, old fellow?\u201d she said, releasing mine and patting my neck.\n\u201cEx-cuse me?\u201d\nJendayi burst out laughing, a slightly husky, wonderfully exciting sound. \u201cA quote from an old British classic about a horse. Nineteenth century, I believe. You might have read it as a child. Black Beauty.\u201d\n\u201cYou are the black beauty,\u201d I said, noticing a cue when it smacked me between the eyes. I raised my voice and said, \u201cDoor close,\u201d and it did.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a way to break into the ship, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said, after a time without time.\nI was reeling and reckless. \u201cYes. Probably.\u201d\n\u201cSo you really are a poltergeist.\u201d She stroked my contemptible belly, as if it were a friendly animal sharing the bed with us. \u201cTony nearly poked his damn eye out.\u201d Her laugh was throaty, dirty, a tonic.\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d I said, and found a glass of water, drained it. \u201cIt\u2019s like being able to wiggle your ears.\u201d\nIn the near-dark, she wiggled hers, and more.\nBut before she left, Jendayi said, \u201cBring me back a sample. A skin scraping, anything with DNA. Just for me, honey, okay?\u201d Oh, so that\u2019s why you\u2019re here? Had to be some reason. Exploitative bitch. But that\u2019s life, right?\nLooking like a well-laid but annoyed and put-upon squat polar bear in my bodyglove, some hellish number of minus degrees on the far side of its skin, I stood gazing down from the edge of the excavation. The spacecraft was unaltered, every bloom precisely where it had been several days before, where it had been, perhaps, several tens of millions of years before. Unless it was salted here recently as a snare for gullible humans. In which case, it might be younger than I. Not so likely, though.\n\u201cReady when you are, Sensei,\u201d said the political officer, doing Mr. Kim\u2019s bidding, and damn the scientists\u2019 caution.\nI raised one thumb and let myself drift. Cause and effect unbraided, started their long, looping dance of etiological distortion, swirling, curdling. I was the still center of the spinning world. Certainties creaked, cracked. A favorite poem entered my heart, by Ji-Hoon Cho, \u201cFlower petals on the sleeves\u201d:\nThe wanderer\u2019s long sleeves\nAre wet from flower petals.\nTwilight over a riverside village\nWhere wine is mellow.\nHad this saurian person below me, trapped now in timelessness, known wine? Crushed release and perhaps moments of joy from some archaic fruit not yet grape? I thought, with a wrenching mournfulness:\nWhen this night is over\nFlowers will fall in that village.\n\u201cHey!\u201d\nAnd there went the flowers, drawn up and tossed away from the hull of the starship. They were scattering in the methane wind, lifted and flung by the bitter gusts, floral loveliness snap-frozen, blown upward and falling down in drifts into the alien snow.\n\u201cThe stationary shield is discontinued,\u201d said a clipped voice in my ears.\nI stepped forward, ready to enter the ancient, imprisoned place. To meet my dinosaur, who had either died or even now lived, freed from timeless suspension. A hand caught my encased arm.\n\u201cNot yet, Sam. We have a team prepped. Thanks, you\u2019ve done good here today.\u201d I turned, hardly able to see through my tears, and it was not that bastard Tony Caetani groveling his apologies, the universe could not be so chirpy as that. I hadn\u2019t met this one before, although he\u2019d picked up my dining room nickname and used it with a certain familiar breeziness; a beefy functionary of some armed service division, grinning at me in his bluff farmboy way. I nodded, and watched the team of marines go down, and remembered my dear boy and the way he had gone forward fearlessly into darkness and then into the fire falling from the sky. It did not matter one whit that I thought his cause wrong-headed. I remembered a poem in that book I\u2019d found in the ruined library, a poem by an Englishman named Kipling that had torn my heart as I sat before Song-Dam\u2019s closed coffin. There was no comfort this tide, the poem warned me, nor in any tide, save this:\nhe did not shame his kind\u2014\nNot even with that wind blowing, and that tide.\nWithout shame, I sobbed, but then drew myself up and turned back to Huygens agora. Perhaps, I told myself, ten or sixty million years ago, another father had laid his son on these cruel snows and bade him farewell. I murmured to that reptilian father, offering what poor borrowed comfort I might to us both, across all that void of space and time: \u201cThen hold your head up all the more, This tide, And every tide; Because he was the son you bore, And gave to that wind blowing and that tide!\u201d\nI looked straight up above me, at the photodiode display before my eyes in the viewmask, swallowing hard, to follow the streaming tide of blossoms on the wind, and there was Saturn, old Father Time, hanging in the orange smoke of the sky, an arrow through his heart. I gave him a respectful nod, and raised one gloved thumb in salute.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, April 2009.\nAustralian writer, editor, futurist, and critic Damien Broderick, a Senior Fellow in the School of Cultural Commincations at the University of Melbourne, made his first sale in 1964 to John Carnell's anthology New Writings in SF 1.

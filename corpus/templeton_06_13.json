There\u2019s food for a month below the floorboards, but thirty kilometers? Looking at my three fellow passengers, hot-shot scientists all, it is distressingly easy to imagine our mini-society devolving into tribalism; it\u2019s obvious that in this group, I am most definitely the Piggy. They seem calm, however, which calms me. For now, at least, things are stable.\nOur elevator pod is just a hollow disc, twenty meters across and four tall, one of six identical space palettes stacked unceremoniously on either side of the climber. We four have been slotted in at the bottom, as is our right as \u201clive cargo,\u201d so we can use our pod\u2019s special bail-out hatch if necessary. This is not how real astronauts ascend\u2014I\u2019ve checked.\nPod 5A provides little room in which to hide, and though my writerly instinct is to mole up in my sleeping tube and avoid all social contact, our predicament does provide a unique chance for a profile under stress. This is what I have come for: a view of this emerging class of bored intelligentsia, the over-credentialed yet under-employed. Through them, perhaps I can glimpse some insight into our modern iteration of the human condition. And perhaps I\u2019ll learn the true location of Atlantis. My first impressions have been strong, but utterly unhelpful.\nThere\u2019s James Dennett, a twenty-nine-year-old physicist who is tall and strapping and blonde and southern. His Texas drawl could fill an auditorium (let alone a tiny elevator pod), and his chin is so cleft that can\u2019t shave all the way inside it so that a little tuft of beard hair pokes out no matter what he tries. Though thorough research has turned up no evidence of a history in sport, my quivering ego projects onto Dennett an undeserved air of linebacker stupidity (along with an imagined history of questionably consensual encounters with innocent college girls). He is, I am ethically obliged to point out, impeccably polite and friendly, which is honestly part of the problem; Dennett looks like he could run for President, and lose votes for not seeming real enough. He has a PhD from Cornell, significant work experience, and has almost two million dollars in debt.\nNext is Anna Petrovic, a thirty-one-year-old engineer whose family emigrated from Hungary when she was fifteen. She\u2019s impeccably pretty, but so slim and gangly that with her hair pulled back she looks like some stick-figure impression of a woman. She wears thick but form-fitting clothes that go with her Eastern European backstory and has that peculiarly Slavic sort of social remove, quiet without being demure, unassuming without forsaking confidence. Her job on-station will be to keep the equipment performance within acceptable limits, run the installation\u2019s many daily calibration routines. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-numbing,\u201d she told me early in the first day of our climb. \u201cAfter three days in the simulator, I wanted to absolutely kill myself. The thought of doing it for three months . . . \u201d I ask whether the recruiting psychologists know of her problems with the work, which gets a laugh, as if to say, \u201cDoes a dancer tell the judges about her eating disorders?\u201d Her post-doctoral degree has given her a net worth of negative $450,000.\nLast, and most akin to myself, is a short but muscle-rounded twenty-eight-year-old named Kingsley Pan. A half-Asian mathematician from Brooklyn, Pan has a tongue as sharp as it is quick. He is constantly making passes at Petrovic, though the references are just oblique enough that she can ignore them without losing face. Our first meeting was in the loading bay, just a few hours before stepping into the pod, when he asked me if I wanted to get into any sort of mutually beneficial porn sharing arrangement. I did not, but mostly just because I doubted our tastes would line up well. If the rejection fazed him at all, he hid it. \u201cFrom what I hear,\u201d he said, leaning close, \u201cit can get to be an absolute fuck-fest up there. We\u2019re talking about young, frustrated over-achievers who were selected for fitness, and who don\u2019t exactly have much experience being idle. Trap them in a boring tin can for months at a time . . . \u201d Pan shook his head and we turned together to eye Dennett and Petrovic like two cackling old maids. \u201cI give it two weeks,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cbefore they\u2019re on each other.\u201d I never got any financial information out of King, but I suspect that any debt-shame that did exist came from having too little, not too much.\nPan is the only one who seeks me out to comment after our sudden vertical halt. \u201cThat\u2019s not supposed to happen,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe lifts have an external power source. We can\u2019t be out of juice. I didn\u2019t hear any kind of mechanical failure.\u201d Pan\u2019s mind has a scab-picking quality with which I can identify, so after several minutes of silence, I turn to him and skip straight to the million dollar question.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\nI\u2019ve gambled three months of my life on the idea that the ultimate answer to that question will reveal something about modern American nature. What will it reveal, precisely? The writers of yesteryear wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of coming here without at least a hopeful guess in mind, but I have somehow convinced myself that predictions of that sort would be poor journalistic form.\nTruth be told, the question is stupid in its essence, like asking a grieving family what they\u2019re feeling. After all, I joined the mission for the exact same reasons they did: I\u2019m young, intelligent, talented, and ambitious\u2014but that\u2019s all. I have not, thus far, developed into a Mozart-like savant, nor have I been able to chemically induce any of the revelatory neuroses of the Hunter Thompsons of the world. When my editor asked me if I would serve three months in space (plus the one-week ascent), it seemed like a way to show my enthusiasm for the job. For my scientist co-passengers, the transaction is even more straight-forward: $70,000 US for a quarter-year\u2019s work, and access to what is still an undeniably bitchin resume bullet point.\nPan mentions these things in his answer to my question, but then says something I\u2019m not expecting. \u201cThese missions, they\u2019re like a sleep-away camp for scientists,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an escape, the foreign travel adventure of a neurotic careerist.\u201d He talks like a writer, the bastard, but he\u2019s right. After a pod-average eleven years of post-secondary education (excluding my curve-depressing statistics of course), the extreme change of scenery must be welcome. To those living with the PTSD anxiety of chronic unemployment, the monkish live-for-work lifestyle of the stations is enticing. Though it\u2019s hard to get an exact number from some of the more secretive corps, it\u2019s estimated that at any given moment the sky is workplace to as many as 150 people like my old-young companions.\nWork like this is increasingly becoming a rite of passage for the new class of mega-proles, people with the social credentials of a CEO, and the income of a cocktail waitress. They live like the upper class because they\u2019re already successful, and the world just needs some time to notice. The cognitive dissonance that emerges when the world remains oblivious could drive just about anyone to drastic action.\nMy companions are sufferers of late-onset adulthood, and I would shun them gladly if I weren\u2019t a premiere member of the infected. In the bloody aftermath of the coming class war, my body will be stuffed and displayed in a museum, a statistical outlier they\u2019ll use to scare young parents into using math tutors and regular corporal punishment. Quite naturally, I assume any war involving my generation will end in a loss for our side.\nThis elevator will drop us at the second gate it passes, from which Pod 5A will spend a further forty hours climbing a lateral ribbon to Brahe Station. Brahe is one of the geo-synch setups, co-leased by four medical and pure-science research corps. It was one of the very first research stations built, which means both that it is shockingly small, and that it\u2019s played host to more than a dozen historically significant experiments.\nMy companions will see none of the glory of those early days, however. They have no following in the industry, no co-author credits in popular papers, no side-careers in molecular genetics. These are physical scientists, and I am a writer, and we are for the first time in human history of totally equal social utility. Work pool inflation has rendered us all fit for little more than cargo shipment. Dennett has a PhD in the study of the very the fabric of the cosmos, and will administer the experimental procedures of the land-lubbing professors who financed the trip from the surface. He will not know what hypotheses he is working to falsify, nor the results of his experiments; double bind? Try totally blind. The company is excluding him, this broad-shouldered charmer with a genius-level IQ, as thoroughly as it possibly can.\n\u201cIt\u2019s monkey-work,\u201d Pan explains. \u201cThey need us up there in case anything goes wrong. But nothing ever goes wrong.\u201d He says this with a shrug, hanging thirty kilometers up in a broken elevator. He continues, oblivious. \u201cThey tried sending real researchers up to go do their own shitty experiments, but they only ever went up once. Three months in a tin can the size of a Bronx apartment is more than enough for most people.\u201d\n\u201cSo if they aren\u2019t sending the same people twice, anyway . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhy not send any old doctor off the street?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to think the companies put much value on their workers.\u201d In journalism this is called the \u201cdeclarative interrogative\u201d and it\u2019s used by hacks, and by people who are slowly beginning to realize that they need to start getting some quotes, and how.\nPan does not disappoint. \u201cUs? We\u2019re just fuel. Only difference is they bring our ashes back at the end.\u201d Oh brother. I record this quote with gusto, but at the same time gripe internally; I\u2019d love to be making seventy grand on this trip.\nIt\u2019s been half an hour since the stall, and the experts are retiring to their respective sleeping tubes. The implication is that I should do the same. We still haven\u2019t heard a peep from command, and have I mentioned that we are thirty kilometers above ground? Pan slips into his tube and, I swear to God, claims he\u2019s going to get some sleep. I grunt an assent, because we\u2019re both real men and I feel exactly the same way he does. When he\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m alone in the common area, I slide down the wall to sit, feeling all the empty space just a few feet below me.\nMy own question echoes back at me, then: Why are you here?\nIt\u2019s been almost two hours since our ascent came to its awkward, stuttering stop, and I can no longer contain the expansive pressure of the situation. It\u2019s just myself and Anna Petrovic in the common room, and the words escape me like steam from a kettle (with all the manly timbre that implies). \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you all more worried?\u201d Their calm has been rubbing off on me so far, but even a passing how-screwed-are-we analysis returns some truly distressing integers. Petrovic looks at me oddly.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you go through basic?\u201d\nI did do the station\u2019s basic training regime, though little had stuck. It had become apparent early in the first day that, being a writer, very little was expected of me (good call). From that point on I slacked shamelessly. It\u2019s a rather annoying recapitulation of the pattern that brought me here in the first place. \u201cCare to fill me in?\u201d is all I say to her.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll establish contact within three hours, or as soon as they have something to report.\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t just call to check up on us?\u201d\nShe looks at me, incredulous. \u201cCheck up on what? If something was happening, what could they possibly do to help?\u201d\nI\u2019m really not sure what to say to that.\n\u201cThe lifts behind us will catch up eventually. If that doesn\u2019t help, then we\u2019ll have to jump.\u201d\nI stare for a second, and before I can scream that last word back at her, Dennett approaches. \u201cI still say it\u2019s war,\u201d he says handsomely. It\u2019s meant to be playful, but it shakes me. How have I failed to consider the possibility that our journey has halted because of a war down below? It wouldn\u2019t take much to disrupt the fine movements of the sea platform that anchors the graphene ribbon on which we hang.\n\u201cThe Chinese have little kamikaze satellites built to take out the counterweight,\u201d Dennett claims.\nThis sounds absurd to me, but Petrovic nods. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she says, approaching, \u201cbut this isn\u2019t war. If it was, we\u2019d be seeing mushroom clouds on the surface.\u201d She glances, blas\u00e9, out the window that is the pod\u2019s single nod to the humanity of its cargo. Petrovic tells me that if one jumps up on a bulkhead and uses the pod\u2019s diminished gravity to hand-plant on a lighting strut, that it is possible to look with a steep enough angle to glimpse where the ribbon disappears into clear, blue ocean. If true, this proves the absence of a storm at sea.\nI decide that this needs first-hand verification (\u201cFor the Readers!\u201d) but in trying to emulate her style of European body-knotting I succeed only in bruising my shin in an embarrassing ricochet off the ceiling. My resignation to the sexual indifference of Anna Petrovic comes even easier than my resignation to take her meteorological report on faith.\nI\u2019m rubbing my shin rather like a clumsy child. \u201cIt could still be war, though . . . \u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much,\u201d Dennett says, sympathetic to my civvie panic response. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just a mechanical failure.\u201d Just a mechanical . . . I stare at him for a moment, then nod and return to my sleeping tube, my slab.\nCommand is supposed to check in within three hours of any mechanical failure. After twenty, we come to an agreement: either the comm is broken, or they just don\u2019t care enough to bring us into the loop. Anna (two days in a crate have forced a first-name relationship) says that her gymnastic maneuvers let her see the next climber approaching behind us, inching its way up the line. \u201cSo it\u2019s just our car, not the whole line. This one won\u2019t have help, though,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was already climbing when we broke down.\u201d\n\u201cThe one after that?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe thinking is now that the company will send a mechanic up on the next available lifter, a specialist in a space suit who will make the rather heart-stopping climb from lifter to lifter.\n\u201cThey could still fill us in,\u201d I say, sulky.\nJames (Dennett) nods vigorously. Nobody defends the logic behind the company\u2019s policies any longer, I\u2019ve noted. James, in particular, has developed a tic in which he will examine the comm several times per hour. He walks to it and pokes a few buttons with his left middle finger, which produces a series of incomprehensible beeps and boops that can\u2019t possibly be telling him anything helpful. His report is the same every time. \u201cIt works,\u201d he claims to know. \u201cThey\u2019re just not talking.\u201d\nKingsley (\u201ccall me King\u201d) Pan has been growing steadily quieter since the three-hour deadline passed without incident. He stirs now and speaks for the first time in an hour. \u201cWe\u2019ll know for sure if there\u2019s no mechanic on the next lift.\u201d\nThat possibility settles in to the atmosphere, gets recycled through the air scrubbers and spit back out to be inhaled all over again. Every conversation is now defined by what it is not about. Our talks are not about the man who may or may not be coming up to help us. They\u2019re not about the possibility that we might be forced to jump nearly from orbit. I discuss literature with Anna (she likes depressing old Soviets), and James tells me about his childhood (chess club and track team). Kingsley increasingly keeps to his tube, even taking his dinner privately.\nI sleep for a few hours, and when I emerge it\u2019s just James in the common area. He looks solitary and pensive, but I\u2019ve been hoping for some time alone with him so I approach immediately. \u201cThinking about the lift?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about jumping.\u201d\n\u201cImagining it? Or considering?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cI bought a house, two years ago. A house. I never thought I\u2019d achieve all my goals before thirty, and still end up considering bankruptcy.\u201d He looks at me. With just a day\u2019s neglect, his big jaw has grown an impressively scratchy-looking coat of stubble, making him look wilder and less put-together than usual. \u201cI can\u2019t jump. And if I do, I\u2019ll just have to sign right back up.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you jump? There\u2019s money in it for you?\u201d\n\u201cA good story. So, money down the line.\u201d\nJames snorts at this. \u201cYou came here to get a lesson, then. We\u2019re here because we already learned it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s never any money down the line.\u201d He gets to his feet and walks away, so I take it that we\u2019re done.\nKingsley jumps first. I\u2019m awakened by a commotion outside my sleeping tube, now three days in the pod. The rescue lifter is supposed to arrive in a few hours. In the common area, Anna and James are speaking animatedly to Kingsley, who is decked head to toe in what looks like a dark red wet-suit stretched over a small internal metal frame. He\u2019s securing a final glove, using a ratcheting system I have on my ski boots. He seems almost catatonic, eyes cast downward, totally unresponsive. He just ratchets on the glove.\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving, King?\u201d I say as I approach, using his preferred moniker (to my knowledge the first time anybody has). He looks up.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here for multiple days. They still haven\u2019t contacted us. Even if there is a guy on the lift, who cares?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll fix us and we can move on,\u201d Anna says.\n\u201cSo? You\u2019ll still be going up for a company that didn\u2019t contact you for two days while you hung in a broken pillbox a hundred miles up!\u201d thirty kilometers, I silently correct him. \u201cWhat do you think will happen if something happens up there? It\u2019s an old station\u2014maybe they\u2019ll decide it\u2019s cheaper just to call the whole thing off, leave you up there forever.\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Anna says.\nKingsley stands up. \u201cThis is the best thing that could have happened.\u201d Stooping, he picks up the helmet and lowers it over his head, locks it in place with a firm sideways jerk that makes it look like he\u2019s breaking his own neck (anatomically and professionally). Without a word of goodbye to any of us, he pulls up a marked floor panel and twists open the submarine hatch below, climbing down into a small pressure chamber. It takes a bit of squeezing to get down with the enormous bulge on his back, parachutes big enough to be useful in ultra-thin atmosphere. We all watch silently as he closes the lid behind him, no hint of hesitation. His slow confidence is unnerving to those staying behind. There\u2019s a squeak of heavy metal as Pan locks the door behind him, then the faint whoosh of air as the chamber depressurizes, then the thud of the outer door opening fully.\n\u201cWait three seconds, pull upper chute,\u201d Anna says quietly. \u201cFall three minutes, detach and pull lower chute.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they said in training?\u201d I ask.\nShe nods. \u201cFrom anywhere in the stratosphere. The first chute, the big one, keeps you from breaking the sound barrier as you fall through the thin part.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d\nJames walks to the circular table at the center of the room and picks up his reader.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Anna asks him.\n\u201cSeeing if they have the specs on our parachutes.\u201d His mouth twists up bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m checking their math.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to jump,\u201d I say.\nHe says nothing, keeps his head down.\nAlone in the common room, I read up on the station. I\u2019ve been planning to discover as I go, to transcribe for my dear readers the truest emotional account of the perils and indignities of honest-to-God space. Now, I simply want to understand what I\u2019m in for. Suction toilets, I\u2019d known about those. Daily exorcize to avoid muscular atrophy? Jeeze. A chance of heart failure upon return? I should have read this contract more carefully. The sleeping tubes on the station are no larger than those in the pod. The common room is smaller, by the looks of it. Food is made by the same company that makes military rations. Water is recycled from the air and sewage. If we were to divide the station up into private quadrants, we\u2019d each get roughly eighty square feet. My three companions are desperate indeed.\nBut what about me? I\u2019m the one who went to space without so much as memorizing the escape routines. I\u2019ve undergone three months\u2019 lead-up to liftoff, a week-long training course, and I haven\u2019t so much as studied the station layout. How can I look down on the genii? They\u2019re here for the money; I\u2019m not even getting hazard pay.\nThe next several hours are solitary, everyone keeping to their tubes, but eventually we emerge. It\u2019s furtive at first, just passing each other as we pull a snack from under the floorboards, or slip into the bathroom tube. I keep telling myself that it\u2019s the not knowing that\u2019s the hardest, that if they\u2019d just tell us to wait or jump I\u2019d be fine. The reality is, though, that an acidic burn is running through my gut, and it\u2019s not because of not knowing. I am thirty kilometers above ground, and I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing here. My mind keeps going in circles; the logical thing to do when you haven\u2019t been able to pay the bills for three years is to switch careers\u2014but to what?\n\u201cRight?\u201d I ask James. I\u2019ve been speaking aloud, and we\u2019re eating together at the table. Bean curd in salt sauce.\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d James says as he takes a bite, less fearful than the last, more fatalistic. A quick shudder passes through his body as he swallows, then he continues. \u201cI always think about my high-school history books. They teach you about the British Empire, right, about the ups and downs of the colonies. And they\u2019ll talk about these sweeping social changes like they\u2019re nothing. A piece of technology puts an industry under, a war over shipping lanes closes a number of ports. What did the calligraphers do when the printing press came for them? They had plans, but history decided to make them economic casualties.\u201d\nI grunt understanding. \u201cWhen do you think they knew?\u201d\nHe laughs. \u201cPast what point do you just have to admit that it\u2019s over?\u201d\n\u201cI guess it depends on how committed you are, and what other options you have.\u201d\nHe looks at me. \u201cVery, and none.\u201d There\u2019s a pause, and it\u2019s not awkward, which is an improvement. Eventually he says, \u201cSo you think everyone has a point past which they have to turn away.\u201d\n\u201cBut again\u2014turn away to what? What are you going to do, run a grocery store? Learn to cobble?\u201d\nHe chuckles, but I can tell it gets to him a bit. A guy like Dennett, he could have been anything. He chose what seemed to be a safe bet, something he was good at, something he could be proud of. Now look at him.\nWe each take another bite of our curd.\nIt says something about every person, I think, the time of their choice to give up hope. Me, I do it in advance. Kingsley didn\u2019t, but he cracked early. James oscillates between emotional states, alternately certain that the man is coming, and certain that we\u2019ve been totally forgotten. Anna\u2019s smooth, angular face is expressionless, but her fingers tapping nervously against her thigh keep me from resenting her. It\u2019s an intricate pattern she\u2019s beating out, and I try to follow it for a while, certain that she wouldn\u2019t be tapping out a random sequence. We all get through these times as we can.\nWe\u2019re sitting in the common room, nervously assembled following the soft impact that had announced the maybe-coming of our savior. Rather than sit in silence, we\u2019ve started playing crib. We\u2019re on our second game, now.\nJames does laps of the common room between hands, a whole fifteen steps. Usually I\u2019d ask him to stop, but given the circumstances I decide we all need our outlets. Besides, I need all the time I can get to avoid annoying the science majors with my ten-second counting handicap. \u201cFifteen-two, fifteen-four, and . . . wait\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Anna snaps at me. We all get through these times as we can. Bitch.\nIt\u2019s been two hours, and now there\u2019s no denying it. Nobody is coming to save us.\n\u201cSo, what the fuck?\u201d I ask them.\nThat question rings through the pod more profoundly than the arrival of the last pallet. Looked at from above, James is pacing out a very slight inward spiral, a visual representation of his emotional state. Every lap brings him a bit closer to the center of the pod, and his body becomes more tense as it approaches, like his movements are turning a crank on his own muscles. The flesh under his jaw is tight, a constant tension in the throat. His mouth is moving to some silent internal conversation, which I imagine as a calculation on mortgage rates.\nAnna is inscrutable, her emotional remove so much more profound than either of her male companions\u2019. She\u2019s very matter of fact: if we have to jump, we have to jump. In absence of evidence, there\u2019s no point in speculating about the cause of our predicament. I had previously been in awe of this woman, monk-like in how she went about setting and achieving goals. That\u2019s how it seems when she goes to the bathroom (\u2018Mission: Piss\u2019 is a go, go, go!), let alone when she goes to space. Now this mindless adherence to the logical path feels a bit like an escape. She just sits there, content in executing the actions she\u2019s computed to be best. Someone has to come unstick these cars eventually, she reasons, and the more people who jump, the more food for there is for me. These companies have been known to reward loyalty.\nThe way she watches James in his pacing makes me think of a naturalist watching an endangered leopard die of exposure.\nKing jumped, but James falls. The distinction is in the little things, the way he climbs down like he\u2019s scrabbling for purchase, like he\u2019s trying to claw his way back up and failing. It\u2019s an entirely different sort of thing. When he\u2019s gone, I think of him in the past tense. Kingsley I imagine down on the surface, amusing the crew of whatever ship was sent to scoop him out of the water, buoyant and useless in his space suit. He\u2019s a real person, with a present and a future. James is just gone.\nAnna and I listen to the airlock cycle, alone now in the stratosphere, and she murmurs her little sacrament. \u201cWait three seconds . . . \u201d she says, but the rest she mumbles to herself, too low for me to hear.\n\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d\nShe glances at me, then away. \u201cJust a little supersti-superstition,\u201d she says, stammering almost like a hiccup. Then she turns away and pulls her long skinny arms into her chest, and I can see that they\u2019re trembling. She walks to the other side of the room, faces the wall, but she doesn\u2019t make for her own tube. After an appropriate amount of time, I walk over to her.\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you left?\u201d she asks without turning. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to stay after all this.\u201d\n\u201cActually, there was no reason for me to stay before all this. But this is a story.\u201d\nShe turns to me, tears in her eyes. \u201cSo, you have your story. Go, now.\u201d\n\u201cI have the beginning of the story. It\u2019s not over until I see how all three of you end up.\u201d\nHer face screws up. \u201cI stay up here, and they come get me. That\u2019s what happens. Imagine it, and, just . . . go!\u201d\nI stare at her. \u201cWhy are you so willing to stay up here?\u201d Keeping her eyes cast down, Anna Petrovic shuffles away from me like a little girl who has fully internalized her scolding. \u201cWhy do you say that when people jump?\u201d She just shakes her head.\n\u201cJust go,\u201d she says in a tiny voice. Then, \u201cI\u2019ll come right after you.\u201d That\u2019s when I get it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d She just stares at me, so I prod her. \u201cThat\u2019s it, right?\u201d\nAfter a moment, she says, \u201cHeights. I don\u2019t . . . \u201d then swallows, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone around to see me get in that hatch. I especially don\u2019t want you to see me like that.\u201d\nOuch. You don\u2019t call me Paparazzi. That\u2019s our word.\n\u201cWell, too bad,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThis is the end, and at least one of the four of us is getting what we came for. I need my ending.\u201d The despair in her eyes is almost enough to sway me. \u201cBesides,\u201d I say, \u201cI thought you were going to stay and wait for them to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFuck them,\u201d she says, and retreats to her tube.\nI briefly consider jumping first out of gentlemanly courtesy, but then I come to my senses. No self-respecting self-hating journalist could pass up the opportunity to describe the end of her story here. There was something about the irrationality of the fear, a product of exemplary simian frontal lobes wrapped around a treacherous reptilian center. I wouldn\u2019t enjoy watching her scrabble around trying to force herself to jump from near orbit, but I\u2019d do it. I\u2019d do it for . . . a credit? A dramatic ending easily twisted to support whatever laughable through-line I\u2019m able to sponge out this amorphous soup of anecdotal evidence?\nShe robs me of that ending, however, mooting the shit out of my ethical dilemma. It takes her about an hour in her tube to work up the courage, but when she does there\u2019s just no stopping her. Fear becomes an action item, and she buries it with characteristic efficiency. Anna says goodbye with a bit of real warmth, which is nice, then she snaps the helmet on, and down she goes. The hatch cycles. She never even flinched.\nA few hours in my sleeping tube don\u2019t seem out of order, so I get them. Somehow, seeing Anna\u2019s bravery has calmed my nerves a bit. I\u2019m scared to jump, but not terrified. I sleep well for three hours, and then a gong wakes me gently.\nIt\u2019s the impact of another pallet arriving, though not nearly enough time has passed for it to be the next regular shipment. It has to be help.\nThis is perfect. The three of them jump, and just hours later help arrives. This is good. The mechanic will probably be some Union type, have a mustache and weathered skin, the sad, knowing face of a man with more than two daughters. He\u2019ll make the perfect ending, a generational antonym to provide some context and imply that I\u2019ve communicated something profound through juxtaposition alone.\nIt makes me sick. I think about the way King jumped, and James, and Anna. Each of them, braver than me. In the end, they broke down, knowingly made a career misstep that proved they had a soul. Now I sit and wait for my quote, please sir, won\u2019t you tell me what you think of today\u2019s struggling young professionals? It\u2019s what I should do, but the scientists should have stayed in the pod. Could I have respected any of them if they had?\nThe space suit fits like a space suit, leaves my shoulders untouched while chafing all the hair off of my armpits. When I lock the helmet, I realize my breath stinks. Vaguely, I\u2019m happy there\u2019s nobody around to see me jump, or to know that I could have stayed, but didn\u2019t. It feels cleaner with only myself as witness.\nI squeeze down the ladder, close the hatch behind me, and say Anna\u2019s little prayer. Then I push the button, and the floor begins to slide away beneath my feet. I\u2019m still on the ladder, though; I don\u2019t want this to be passive. Air sucks past me for an astonishingly short amount of time and then I\u2019m basically in a vacuum, atmosphere so thin it might as well not be there. It\u2019s just me and the ladder, now, and the Earth fills the hatch entirely, a bright white circle like if you had to climb down into heaven.\nLooking and seeing nothing below, and really feeling all the distance there, I get suddenly very calm. Somehow I know that the jump will be fine and that I\u2019ll be fine too. I\u2019ve needed some time to think, for a while now.\nBy the time I touch down I\u2019ll have my ending figured out.\nGraham Templeton is a young-ish journalist from Vancouver, Canada, who got into writing after 5 years studying biochemistry.

Over two rounds of voting\u2013in January and February\u2013finalists were selected and voted on. Although participation rose by nearly ten percent over last year in round one, it was virtually unchanged from 2021 in round two. We\u2019d like to thank everyone who participated this year and hope you\u2019ll continue your involvement next year.\n And now for the fun part:\n Best Cover of 2021\n This year\u2019s race was a tough one and may be the closest we\u2019ve seen. The top three were one point apart and the others were within three of placing. In the end, our readers selected:\n 3rd Place\u201cSpace Cadet\u201d by Pascal Blanch\u00e9 (11/2021)\n 2nd Place\u201cSuspire\u201d by Yuumei (1/2021)\n 2021 Winner\n \u201cForward\u201d by Wenjuinn Png (2/2021)\n Best Story of 2021\n The final round of voting for best story was another nail-biter. The first and last few days of voting are often our most active and if averages held (and they did), any of our eight finalists could have taken the lead if the last day votes went a little differently. Given how they clustered in the first round of voting, I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. The last three votes established our final standings and yielded ties for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place.\n 4th Place (TIE)\n 3rd Place (TIE)\n \u201cHomecoming is Just Another Word for the Sublimation of the Self\u201dby Isabel J. Kim (Short Story, 3/2021)\n 2nd: Place (TIE)\n 2021 Winner\n Congratulations to all of this year\u2019s winners and finalists! The close races and strong support shown for each story and cover are something that this community can be proud of. We look forward to providing readers with much more to be excited about in the year ahead.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

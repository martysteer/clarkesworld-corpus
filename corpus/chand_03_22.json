Our gravitational generator always shut off first. Next were the ship\u2019s main systems, everything except emergency life support. We\u2019d learned to conserve our air as it recharged, enough to allow a single person to tell a story. The story.\n Necessity. If our children were to survive, they had to understand. We took turns, but the words were always the same.\n I waited until the ship\u2019s hum faded, leaving only the sound of our deliberate, slow breathing.\n \u201cThree years ago,\u201d I said softly, \u201cwe did something bad. We didn\u2019t listen to the AI. We thought we didn\u2019t need it anymore, because we were close to landing. But that was wrong. You can\u2019t stop being careful, ever.\u201d All of us held our children tighter, taking comfort before the horror ahead.\n \u201cWe hit a rock.\u201d My voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cOur friends were . . . taken.\u201d And so was the playground I\u2019d hoped to show Callo around, and the radiation net that\u2019d powered our AI separately from the main engine, forcing this daily shutdown so it could recharge. \u201cWhen we found out what happened, we went back. We said sorry. It was too late to save our friends, but the AI told us what to do next.\n \u201cWe should have listened from the beginning. It\u2019s okay to ask questions.\u201d My heart beat faster. I ignored it. \u201cBut you can\u2019t say no to the AI. You can\u2019t put your hands over your ears and pretend you didn\u2019t hear.\n \u201cFirst, the AI told us to make you, because this ship needs people. And then\u201d\u2014my chin lifted toward the massive window\u2014\u201cit sent the mothers to the planet. They\u2019re down there right now, making food and houses for us.\u201d Our distance comms, built centuries after our ancestors left Earth, couldn\u2019t penetrate the planet\u2019s atmosphere. For all we knew, the mothers were dead, or thought we were dead.\n \u201cOne day,\u201d I said, ears thumping, \u201cwe\u2019ll join them. It\u2019ll be just like living inside a holo.\u201d The holochamber was gone. We\u2019d need a better metaphor . . . or we could finally leave this damn ship. We\u2019d stabilized what we could, but what remained of it wouldn\u2019t survive a second collision. It was time to go.\n A sigh, then a hum. We repositioned our feet, adjusted the children, and landed gently as the gravity returned.\n Thakur and I headed to our shared compartment, his pace slowed by twins. Because they were two, they were on part-rations. Once a week I offered to get Thakur a little extra from Hydroponics, but he always said no. He was right, that was what the AI had allotted him.\n But he\u2019d never asked for more.\n \u201cThakur,\u201d I said after we\u2019d tucked the children in and were nestling on the couch.\n \u201cMmm?\u201d Thakur pressed closer to my chest.\n \u201cWe should get out of here.\u201d\n Thakur pushed back and stared into my face. \u201cDid you hear a rumor, Servain? Is something wrong with the ship?\u201d\n \u201cNo, listen.\u201d I touched his arm. \u201cCatastrophic systems failures\u2014you know they\u2019re a thing.\u201d Until the accident I\u2019d been an engineer, like Thakur. \u201cAnd we\u2019re orbiting a planet. We don\u2019t know what could happen.\u201d My hand drifted down his body. \u201cI reserved a slot for tomorrow, so we can ask the AI. We\u2019ll do whatever it says, I promise.\u201d\n Thakur relaxed. \u201cAlright. Tomorrow.\u201d\n We had sex and then went to our separate rooms.\n After breakfast in the kitchen, a careful dance that fit our trays and elbows into the limited space, Thakur and I led the way to the AI\u2019s room, children cradled in our arms. Other families filed in behind us, wanting to hear the answer to a question none of them dared ask. Cowards. Sensible, but cowards.\n The AI\u2019s question-box was in a small room on its own mooring, a clear bubble that was nearly invisible under the overhead LEDs. I activated its listening mode. \u201cEngaged,\u201d it said. \u201cAsk your question.\u201d\n I spoke more slowly than necessary, chewing the words. \u201cCan we go to the planetary settlement?\u201d\n The bubble clouded up, processing, its neural net finding connections between ship and old Earth data alike.\n It would be a long time before I realized the unintended loophole in my question. Can, not should. The roboticist-historians would\u2019ve never let me use such imprecise phrasing, but they\u2019d been in the library when the implosion happened, and we didn\u2019t have a library anymore.\n Patterns drifted across the AI\u2019s bubble.\n I remembered going to temple for the first time, babbling with my friends to quell our fear\u2014what if the gods punished us for the time we\u2019d helped Dalia sneak into the ventilation? We\u2019d been in the holochamber on countless occasions, but never like this, lost among intricately carved white pillars that stretched into a distant sky. We\u2019d squirmed out of our parents\u2019 laps, ignoring their attempts to hush us.\n Now was nothing like then, holding our own children, waiting on our shared fate. Our tongues were heavy, frozen. The erratic sounds of our breath filled the air, a jagged orchestra.\n And most of my friends were gone.\n The AI\u2019s bubble cleared. \u201cYes.\u201d\n We got to work. Thakur sealed pipes while I helped wind down Hydroponics, harvesting all we could take without crashing the population, in case we needed to return. By the time I finished, plants carefully bagged, Navigation had prepared the shuttles. I strapped in next to Thakur. We held our children tightly, aided by a jury-rigged mess of extra belts and buckles.\n We landed after sunset, so our first glimpse of the planet was splotches of native vegetation in vivid green, illuminated by pools of sparse lighting, the settlement\u2019s low buildings caught in shadow. The old navigation data was right. But had the mothers survived?\n There was my answer, running toward me. Aparla, who wrapped me in a hug. \u201cServain! It\u2019s about damn time.\u201d\n \u201cCareful,\u201d I said, lifting Callo free.\n Aparla blinked. \u201cYou brought Callo with you?\u201d\n Warmth first, that she remembered the name of my child. And then ice, depositing quickly. \u201cYou really think I\u2019d leave Callo up there?\u201d\n Aparla shrugged and turned to Thakur. \u201cI see you brought yours as well. Twins, huh?\u201d\n Thakur grinned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t decide!\u201d They laughed as groups split off around us, fathers holding up their children for mothers to coo over.\n \u201cThakur, do you want to join us on a tour?\u201d Aparla smiled at me. \u201cServain, you don\u2019t get to say no.\u201d\n Thakur said, \u201cI think I\u2019d like a rest. I\u2019m a bit tired from carrying these two all day.\u201d He dropped his arms to demonstrate, gently so the children wouldn\u2019t be jostled.\n \u201cAh, you\u2019ll want the medical compound, over there. It\u2019s fully stocked. Not to jinx it, but things have been pretty calm. Here, join Ghalis\u2019 group.\u201d Aparla waved Thakur toward a gaggle of other fathers. I wondered why there weren\u2019t already rooms for us. Maybe the mothers had dismantled them as the silence grew longer.\n Aparla turned back to me. \u201cAnyway, Servain,\u201d she said, \u201clet me show you what I\u2019ve been up to. The lab\u2019s this way.\u201d\n I resettled Callo and followed her to a building twenty meters down. The metal was dull, durable, and lightweight, unmarked despite its millennia-long journey from Earth. I wondered how this planet felt about being invaded by such alien substances, but there was no one to say. We wouldn\u2019t have landed on a planet with sentients\u2014bad enough what we might do to this one.\n Aparla opened the door for me. No scans, no locks, just like above. Cradling Callo tighter, I stepped through.\n Aparla\u2019s workspace resembled the ship\u2019s hydroponics lab\u2014no surprise, it was her specialty\u2014but take the bench where we did samples analysis and stretch it out to occupy one side of a vast room, the kind of space I could barely imagine these days. At the far end was her desk, covered in scattered holos. Instead of gesturing me over to see, Aparla pointed to a chair on the other side.\n \u201cThe plants have been doing well, so I\u2019ve been playing amateur psychologist in my free time.\u201d She blushed, slight tinge on her face, darkened by real sunlight. \u201cWould you mind taking this assessment for me? While you\u2019re still fresh off the ship, so to speak.\u201d\n \u201cAlright.\u201d I shifted Callo into her arms. Before I could tell Aparla to be careful with Callo, she\u2019d wriggled one hand free and brought up the test.\n \u201cNo need to rush,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon. Gotta make sure we\u2019re set for dinner.\u201d\n I pulled the computer toward me. My body felt light without Callo\u2019s weight. Of course, we had slings, but it felt better to hold our children close. I hoped they drew as much comfort from us as we did them.\n The assessment was nothing like I expected. It was basic visual recognition: shapes, colors, and then more complex structures, people and plants and ship components. Maybe I was missing the point. I did my best to answer everything accurately and hit send.\n I wasn\u2019t waiting long before Aparla came back in and handed Callo back to me, then pulled out a chair and sat closer than I expected, her eyes locked on me as I fussed over Callo. She said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with any of your visual processing that we\u2019re seeing . . . \u201d\n \u201cWhy would there be?\u201d We\u2019d spent three years restoring a half-shattered ship. I was insulted.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Aparla said, shaking her head. \u201cBut you know you\u2019ve been carrying around a frozen embryo, right?\u201d\n I hugged Callo\u2019s ovoid, a hermetically sealed container full of clever tech that kept it at the same temperature as liquid nitrogen. \u201cSo?\u201d\n \u201cSo? Servain, you\u2014none of you\u2014had to bring them here. They\u2019re frozen embryos! The comms aren\u2019t working, for all you knew we were dead, killed by something down here! They would\u2019ve been safer on the ship.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said, head shaking, holding Callo tighter. \u201cThe AI said we had to take care of the children. We\u2019re the fathers.\u201d\n \u201cAnd we\u2019re the \u2018mothers\u2019?\u201d Disdain seethed on her tongue. \u201cGood Earth, Servain! That AI twisted some old-style naming convention and you\u2019ve been going with it? Did you also forget you used to be my wife?\u201d\n I blinked. In those early lonely days after the mothers left, there hadn\u2019t been time to dwell on the relationships we\u2019d broken in case we never crossed paths again. It had been one frantic scramble after another, but we\u2019d made it, under the AI\u2019s aegis.\n When I didn\u2019t respond, Aparla tried a smile, weak as hydroponic tea. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot has happened. Let\u2019s join the others, dinner\u2019s up.\u201d\n I picked up Callo, this time using the sling that dangled from my shoulder, as essential to my wardrobe as pants, and followed. Aparla glanced at Callo but said nothing.\n As we approached the dining area, I drifted around, trying to see if I could go in. Aparla caught my arm. \u201cThere\u2019s none of that here, Servain. No more eating in shifts. The dining hall\u2019s big enough for all of us.\u201d\n Planets were incredible. I followed Aparla inside. The mothers were spread out, trays organically scattered. I hadn\u2019t seen such a lack of economy in over three years.\n \u201cWe aren\u2019t producing at capacity yet,\u201d the mother who slopped food onto my plate said. \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, we can start ramping up, but in the meantime, it\u2019s a good thing we have your plants.\u201d\n \u201cThanks,\u201d I said. The AI had told us to bring the plants. She should have thanked it. I would\u2019ve said something, if I wasn\u2019t distracted by the steam rising from my dish. The spices were the same, but fully heated food\u2014I\u2019d missed that.\n Aparla and I\u2014and Thakur, once he saw us\u2014sat cross-legged around one of the small tables. Thakur had the twins in their sling as well. I heard more background chatter than I\u2019d heard in ages, all from the mothers. It felt unnatural, not only because they changed topics every time we brought up our children. Where we\u2019d embraced silence, the mothers had tried to fill this unimaginably massive world with noise.\n We finished eating and dropped our plates into the recycler. Almost by reflex, Thakur and I huddled with the other fathers. We didn\u2019t know where to go so we stayed clustered, releasing the children from their slings and into our arms. The mothers were watching us, their collective gaze undiluted by their spread across the dining hall.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll show you where to sleep,\u201d someone said at last, and we shuffled out gratefully behind her, children nestled against us.\n Thakur and I looked at each other. \u201cDo we want to share a dorm?\u201d he said.\n Our relationship was mostly the warmth of our bodies against each other, comfort and release. The last conversation we\u2019d had on the ship was the most we\u2019d spoken in months.\n \u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a try.\u201d\n We took a larger room with a double bed. We put the children on the hammocks the mothers had provided, somewhat ungraciously I thought. These were their kids too.\n \u201cAren\u2019t they being weird about the children?\u201d I asked Thakur.\n \u201cThey\u2019ve been working their butts off on an actual planet,\u201d Thakur said. \u201cImagine how mind melting that is? Tomorrow we\u2019re going to see a completely open sky. I\u2019d give them a break for now, Servain.\u201d\n I went to bed thinking about what it would\u2019ve been like to do everything we had to do to repair the ship, forcing our bodies through a haze of nightmares and the constant aching fear of another mistake, but on land.\n We couldn\u2019t sit idly, especially not now the settlement needed expansion. I had the sense the mothers would let us do anything, especially if it distracted us from watching our children.\n Tucked in bed next to Thakur for the first time ever, I said, \u201cWill you stay with Waterworks?\u201d Dew collection, irrigation, plumbing\u2014there were so many more choices on a planet.\n Thakur\u2019s arm drifted along my back. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the AI said I was good at, Servain. I\u2019m going back to Circuits.\u201d\n \u201cOh,\u201d I said. Was I the only one who liked my new role more, no matter where the AI had originally placed me? I shifted away from him and pulled Callo toward me until the ceramic warmed to match the heat of my own body.\n All of the original hydroponicists were mothers: the AI had spared no one, planetary sustenance being too critical and more unpredictable than our little ship farm. So I was the only father who joined them, under Aparla\u2019s supervision.\n Over the past couple of days, I\u2019d mostly seen the inside of the settlement, all those rooms and buildings stretched out past my imaginings, but this\u2014this was new. Thakur was right, the mothers must\u2019ve been terrified. The holochamber hadn\u2019t captured it. I couldn\u2019t describe it. I\u2019d looked out the ship\u2019s windows thousands of times, but space is mostly empty. This was all substance, grass and soil and rocks and a horizon that ended. There was something unsettling about that middle distance, terrain shrouded in blue haze\u2014out of reach, but reachable, nothing like stars stretching into infinity.\n Of course the mothers were comfortable with it now, and assigned me to the field nearest to our settlement, which was also where the Earth plants were, familiar and small. What I\u2019d seen of the native vegetation was leafier and with fluffy lightweight seeds, thanks to the respective absence of predators and pollinators. Otherwise, the underlying biology was familiar. Left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars, photosynthesis by day and respiration or its carbon fixing alternatives by night. Our bodies couldn\u2019t digest alien botany, nor would our plants thrive in truly alien soil, torn from the bacterial and fungal networks they needed for sustenance. Mars had been a mistake, one that propelled our ancestors onto the ship, generation after generation not knowing if they\u2019d ever find a place for their descendants to thrive.\n And now we were here.\n \u201cThe vertigo was bad when I first landed,\u201d Venkat said to me, reaching past Callo\u2019s sling to pat my elbow. \u201cDon\u2019t try to ride it out, just go inside. It\u2019s like agoraphobia, sort of.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d I watched her retreat into the distance, quick short strides, turning away before the horizon caught me again. This place was so big we\u2019d need transportation by the time the children were grown. Even that thought dizzied me. I lay down on the earth, pressing my cheek against cool soil, eyes closed. It smelled richer than I\u2019d imagined, although I couldn\u2019t untangle the scents yet.\n Once I felt steadier, I got to work, checking each plant for disease with my scanner, making sure everything was healthy. My back sweated where Callo pressed against it. I wondered if it would be alright to put Callo down. But this planet could still be full of unwelcome surprises and caring for our children was paramount.\n \u201cHow\u2019s the soil?\u201d\n I started. There hadn\u2019t been any sound of footsteps\u2014no metal floors. \u201cAparla, hi.\u201d I caught my breath. \u201cI haven\u2019t started scanning it yet.\u201d\n She smiled. \u201cDoing the plants first, huh? Efficient. We should\u2019ve got engineers to help us way sooner.\u201d Her hand landed on mine, warm and callused. Something stirred in the back of my brain. I put my other hand on top of hers.\n \u201cYou still . . . \u201d She trailed off. \u201cYou\u2019re with Thakur, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cWe bonded on the ship. We\u2019re giving the planet a try. I don\u2019t think you mothers understand.\u201d Remembering what Thakur said last night, I added, \u201cSorry.\u201d\n Aparla snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re apologizing for the wrong thing. Don\u2019t you remember why the AI calls us \u2018mothers\u2019?\u201d\n \u201cBecause you are,\u201d I said. Which was my way of admitting I didn\u2019t.\n \u201cBecause it thinks mothers are \u2018homemakers.\u2019\u201d The disdain was even stronger this time. \u201cNo other reason. That\u2019s not even what those terms meant on Earth, not by the twenty-second century.\u201d\n \u201cSo what?\u201d\n \u201cSo\u2014I, we, we\u2019re worried. You all don\u2019t seem to care that the AI has flaws, its specialty is computation, not . . . I don\u2019t know, building a whole society. We used to make fun of it, and now you\u2019re treating it like gospel. And now\u2014how are you keeping it powered, Servain?\u201d\n Before the accident, we hadn\u2019t taken the AI as seriously. It sometimes gave us answers that didn\u2019t make sense\u2014which, I now realized, might be because of their planetary relevance. What if almonds really did heal one\u2019s emotional balance? What were almonds, anyway? Aparla and I had laughed over the advice, given in response to a series of panic attacks that had spread across the ship following the loss of one of our candidate planets.\n I was sure she remembered the laughter, but not the context. Without seeing the AI in action, I didn\u2019t know how I could convince her otherwise. How could she, distracted by the smell of real soil and this wide-open sky, understand what it was like during those daily blackouts, the drifting and the silence?\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you,\u201d I said.\n \u201cAlright. I\u2019ve got to get back to work.\u201d She stretched, careful not to look at Callo. \u201cDon\u2019t be out here too long without a break. Your UV shield isn\u2019t perfect. You\u2019re on a planet now, all kinds of things can happen in the open air, especially when you\u2019re new. Lakka got heatstroke, it\u2019s unpleasant and takes a long time to go away completely.\u201d\n I finished up, guzzling the water someone brought me but never putting Callo down, no. The mothers were so coordinated, trading information and talking among themselves. None of us were like that. Thakur and I didn\u2019t even try to cross paths during the day.\n But here, with the mothers pressing in on us, we began talking more.\n One day after dinner, we crammed into the double room Thakur and I shared, children nestled more comfortably now that the mothers weren\u2019t staring at us. The room was warm and filled with the sound of breathing. A flash of memory, hundreds of memories, but all the same: I missed our daily sessions on the bridge.\n \u201cThey\u2019re mocking us,\u201d Daneel said in the soft tones of our oratory. He smacked his fist into his palm. \u201cThey aren\u2019t taking the AI seriously at all. I asked about bringing it down here, and they laughed.\u201d\n We all shivered or clutched our children for comfort.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve only been here a few weeks,\u201d Thakur said. \u201cWe should talk to them. They\u2019ve forgotten the accident\u201d\u2014a pause, an inhalation\u2014\u201cthey\u2019ve spent too much time planetside, they\u2019re losing their instincts for survival. They think the AI is amusing because they haven\u2019t run into any major problems yet.\u201d\n We drew our children close. There would be problems. There were always problems, and the best way to avoid them was to listen to the AI.\n \u201cWe have to help them remember.\u201d\n I took lunch with the mothers when we came back from the fields. We called it Hydroponics out of habit, although of course it wasn\u2019t.\n \u201cDirt-ponics?\u201d I laughed. The others laughed with me. It was like reliving my childhood.\n Ichiro said, still laughing, \u201c\u2018Farming,\u2019 I think. It\u2019s been a long time since I saw the vids, they\u2019re still on the ship, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d I saw my opportunity. \u201cWe watch\u2014watched\u2014a new one every Friday. The AI does a great job selecting ones that are right for the moment.\u201d\n \u201cI remember it was good at that kind of thing, as long as you didn\u2019t mind getting some very odd half-notions from Earth,\u201d Halva said. She and the other mothers traded grins. To avoid looking stuffy, I smiled.\n But as I spent more time outside, and watched my skin turn from dust to soil, contributing to a fully organic ecosystem for the first time in my life, I felt myself expand past the constraints of my old life. My whole being yearned for the sky. I wanted to explore, even, yes, stand atop one of the hazy blue mountains. I wondered how you could grow up on a planet and then live out the rest of your life in a metal box that, at any second, could\u2014\n I\u2019d overreached. The horizon blared in my mind\u2019s eye. I dropped to my knees. Shivering, I turned Callo\u2019s sling around my body and lifted Callo out, running my hands across the ceramic like I always did for comfort. Nothing. I wrapped my arms around Callo, trembling, trembling harder, and eventually the tears rolled out of me, hideous wet sobs. I hadn\u2019t cried like this, even as a child. I\u2019d always been surrounded by people. Half of them were dead. Callo wasn\u2019t a person, not even close\u2014might never be a person\u2014\n I released Callo and put my dirt-coated hands over my face, letting the earthy scents wash over me. The soil was warm from the sunlight, moist against my knees. I lay back down to let it caress me, wishing it were the touch of a person. But it was still more alive than the ceramic shell inside which Callo lay frozen.\n What was I doing? What were any of us fathers doing?\n Sudden coolness\u2014something was interfering with the sunlight. Aparla was standing over me, I recognized her concerned huff. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d she said.\n I rubbed my eyes, using the heels of my palms to blot out the tear tracks as if she wouldn\u2019t notice. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cThe sky got to me. Not as acclimated as I\u2019d like.\u201d I managed a weak giggle.\n \u201cI\u2019m sending you back, Servain. Rest.\u201d\n I thought about arguing, but I hadn\u2019t been entirely dishonest. I could use the comfort of four walls and a ceiling right now. \u201cThanks.\u201d Looking around as little as possible, I retreated back into my shared room and put Callo on the table by my bedside and closed my eyes.\n Thakur opening the door woke me up. \u201cOh, sorry, I didn\u2019t realize\u2014why is Callo on the table?\u201d His tone shifted from warm to colder than the inside of Callo\u2019s container.\n I sat up. I\u2019ve never been one of those people who needs time or stimulants to return to full functionality. \u201cI\u2014I was tired. Aparla and I were\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou left your child unprotected because of a mother?\u201d\n \u201cNot unprotected\u2014\u201d\n \u201cCallo could fall from here. And then what?\u201d\n The containers had flat, gecko-like bases for that exact reason. \u201cNothing happened, Thakur. Can you please calm down? You\u2019re nearly shouting. Someone\u2019s gonna think there\u2019s an emergency.\u201d\n \u201cCalm\u201d\u2014Thakur took a steadying breath. \u201cI can\u2019t believe who you\u2019ve become here, Servain. You remember what we learned from the AI. Our children come first.\u201d He steadied the sling across his chest, nudging the ovoid so it bumped his ribs. I saw the wince.\n For the first time I saw the \u201cchildren\u201d through the mothers\u2019 eyes. The container was just that, a container. There was no reason to drag the contents from place to place. We were inconveniencing ourselves for\u2014what, exactly? The most rigid possible interpretation of the AI\u2019s directive to ensure humanity had a future?\n I got up. \u201cThis is who I was, Thakur. It\u2019s just, with the emergency . . . \u201d We hadn\u2019t given ourselves any space to think, to reconsider what we were doing. We told ourselves we could ask questions. Could, not should. Even though we\u2019d grown up knowing the AI was far from omnipotent, we sought comfort in its algorithms.\n Thakur and I looked at each other for a long time. Then I packed up my belongings.\n \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want the double bed?\u201d he said.\n Once, when I was young, our main water recycler broke, and we couldn\u2019t shower until the repairs were completed. The first time I stood under the jets I felt a layer of dead skin slough off my body. How strange, to realize I\u2019d come to accept that dry, itchy sensation of my skin being too small as simply the way things were.\n I looked at Thakur, pulling the container to his chest, seeking comfort in its presence as if it had any to give, and smiled gently. \u201cYou have the twins. You\u2019ll need it more than I do.\u201d\n The alarms went off early, so bleary-eyed we all rushed to the medical complex. It was a specially reinforced set of buildings, infirmary and storage and meeting space. We entered the latter, dispersing among the few scattered chairs that weren\u2019t folded up. I wondered if the protocol for emergencies had come from the AI or simply been obvious.\n Out of habit, I joined the fathers on the side opposite the mothers, Callo nudging my back. Most of them had their slings turned to the front. My hands shifted, but the container was more comfortable where it was, and\u2014we were planetside now.\n Thakur\u2019s gaze raked my chest and then shifted away, which let the others know we\u2019d broken up. Before anyone could ask what happened, there was a sudden push to make space for the lead mother, if you could call her that, and two security officers, at the front of the room. Aina, Trevor, and Vitri. Even as Aina\u2019s eyes raked the room, the mothers were murmuring among themselves, Aparla included, speculating.\n Aina quieted the mothers with a wave of her hand, waiting until they\u2019d finished shushing each other to speak. Her voice echoed off the walls. \u201cThere\u2019s been a small disruption to one of the power generators. No concerns yet, we\u2019ve got enough stored energy for the next sixty hours. We\u2019re going to stay here while Nabin and Dastana identify the issue. Are there any engineers from the ship who would like to join them? I do have to warn you, there\u2019s a fire risk.\u201d\n No one stepped forward. I shifted Callo to my front, and although I knew the calm was really from the bodies near me, I stroked the container like the other fathers were doing. Power disruption. Fire risk. How could she say those things so casually? Sweat ran down Thakur\u2019s face.\n I remembered wiping Aparla\u2019s brow when we\u2019d been married. Those little intimacies had never existed between Thakur and me.\n Aina\u2019s eyes raked our containers and then returned to our faces. \u201cWe do want to get you all involved here, and the emergency\u2019s a good way to understand these weather-based power generators. The underlying mechanisms are pretty different from shipside. Any takers?\u201d\n I was a hydroponics specialist now. I mean, a farmer. Either way, not an engineer anymore. If I was honest with myself, it was more of a relief than being away from the ship, no matter that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the best use of my skills. The AI made me an engineer because of my relative talents in math, but I\u2019d always preferred the smell of green things.\n But knowledge was a good thing.\n But there was nothing that compelled me to go, and we were back with the mothers. Let someone else be responsible for the electronics. I\u2019d rather be responsible for the growing.\n Dalia stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said. There was an eagerness in him I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d seen in years. He slipped the sling off his shoulder, handing it and the container wrapped inside to the nearest mother.\n As Dalia followed Trevor out the door, the fathers kept their eyes on Dalia\u2019s container.\n Dalia and I still joined the fathers for our conversations, crammed into one of the spare rooms, sharing air and warmth. I was a few seats down from Thakur, trying to remember how I held Callo\u2019s container when I thought of it as Callo.\n After the incident\u2014resolved within the hour, some casing had cracked despite the material\u2019s much-vaunted weather tolerance\u2014no one had asked for details of our breakup. They were too aghast at Dalia. He was seated slightly outside the circle. There was something different about the way he held his body, but I couldn\u2019t figure what. The fathers all had their eyes on him.\n I couldn\u2019t scrub the image from my own head, the . . . freedom as Dalia went off to risk his life for knowledge.\n \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Xiu Ying said to Dalia, finally breaking the silence.\n Dalia\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cYou heard her. It\u2019s not like we can just take apart a working generator when we feel like it. This was a rare opportunity to understand the mechanism.\u201d\n \u201cYou could have died.\u201d That was the cue to, of course, cling to our containers, hands skating across the ceramic like window washers.\n \u201cWe were near death all the time on the ship,\u201d Dalia retorted, waving his arms, joggling his shirt. That was when it registered: no carrier, no container. I pushed unkind thoughts about Callo\u2019s weight on my lap to the back of my mind.\n \u201cNot like this,\u201d Leluye said, stepping in where Xiu Ying was sputtering. \u201cThe AI could have assessed the situation without you all needing to risk yourselves.\u201d To this, Dalia shrugged\u2014he and Leluye were on the same shift, Leluye wasn\u2019t blithering. \u201cBut the mothers refuse to entertain the adjustments needed to bring it here. So\u2014we risk ourselves planetside when something goes wrong, and it could be an even bigger accident\u201d\u2014we all shuddered. We couldn\u2019t help it. I suddenly saw ritual in the way we reached for our containers, no different from the prayers some of us said nightly.\n The silence continued until Dalia interjected, voice trembling as it hadn\u2019t earlier. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhich the AI could help us with,\u201d Leluye said, cutting him off. \u201cIt was built on a planet. It\u2019s got all kinds of knowledge we don\u2019t understand.\u201d The other fathers nodded forceful assent, chins thrusted. Dalia subsided back into his seat.\n Was Leluye right?\n I myself had agreed with his sentiment not too long ago. But the mothers remembered growing up with the AI, and they\u2019d been here for three years, and they had no such feelings. With the amount of times we\u2019d all brought up the AI, they would\u2019ve said something if they\u2019d had any sudden insights about its relevance.\n Before I could bring that up, Xiu Ying said, \u201cWe should leave.\u201d More understated than he\u2019d been on the bridge, but not a whisper.\n At last Leluye responded, equally quiet, \u201cHow?\u201d\n \u201cThe shuttles are all on the landing pad. The mothers know we left supplies aboard the ship. We won\u2019t tell them we\u2019re not coming back.\u201d Xiu Ying pulled his chair closer to the center, so the LED caught his soft features and dipped them in shadow.\n \u201cThis planet is too damn unpredictable. Let\u2019s do it,\u201d Thakur said, hands passing over his twins\u2019 container.\n I snuck a glance at Dalia right as he glanced back at me, and while he didn\u2019t look defeated\u2014and I didn\u2019t think I did, either\u2014we were both exhausted. If we said anything, they\u2019d mention the accident, and our brains weren\u2019t ready to push that aside long enough to point out all the problems with going back to a creaking half-corpse of a ship.\n \u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Xiu Ying whispered. The fathers murmured assent.\n Was it really that simple?\n When they went to the mothers and told them it was time to go back, complete the ship\u2019s transformation into salvage\u2014when the mothers asked if some of them should go and the fathers said no, the ship\u2019s changed a lot since the implosion, you won\u2019t know where anything is, it\u2019ll waste time\u2014when I said nothing, because I couldn\u2019t betray the fathers, even though I knew I wasn\u2019t a father anymore, and hadn\u2019t been for a while . . .\n Yes. It was.\n For old times\u2019 sake, I decided to talk to Thakur after dinner, alone in my room. Callo rested on the hammock the mothers had constructed\u2014a waste of resources, I couldn\u2019t help thinking, with the part of my brain that had blossomed under the light of an actual sun. But at least it would be enough to avoid distracting Thakur with my \u201ccarelessness.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it, Servain?\u201d he said, taking a seat on the chair across from me. His container bulged over his belly.\n \u201cI just wanted to\u2014are you really doing this? The engines could fail, or the hull could lose . . . It\u2019s not safe up there,\u201d I blurted, because if I stopped and thought, I\u2019d return to the accident again.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not safe down here, either,\u201d Thakur said.\n He wasn\u2019t exactly wrong. The alarm was the one real emergency we had, but there\u2019d been a few near misses with twisted ankles, a case of pneumonia after a rainstorm\u2014yes, it really can fall from the sky. Unpredictable, but expected planetary behavior. I focused on the latter. To Thakur, it was the former that terrified. The dangers were known, if sometimes inescapable, on a ship.\n And I could see his hands trembling, far cry from the boldness that had drawn me to him in those early days\u2014the only one who insisted on keeping both fertilized embryos!\u2014he wouldn\u2019t let himself heal. I wasn\u2019t yet capable of helping anyone else, and he\u2019d run screaming from the mothers.\n \u201cNever mind,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was good seeing you.\u201d\n Thakur nodded, hands seeking comfort from his ceramic-alloy hemisphere. \u201cGoodbye, Servain.\u201d\n Eventually he\u2019d activate the twins\u2019 container, him and the other fathers. I had to hope the AI would tell them to come back down here, sooner rather than later, as the ship slowly deteriorated, along with their sense of independence.\n Our ancestors had left Earth seeking a new planet. To come so close, and then to leave it\u2014I thought about the months we had spent together, holding each other. I wished we had worked more on easing instead of sharing our trauma, but I doubted I\u2019d even have been capable of that thought on the ship. I\u2019d entrusted my brain to repetition and our rigid interpretation of the AI\u2019s directives. Ship-minded, small, crushed into half the space we should have had.\n The next day the fathers were gone.\n I was in the medical sector, finding a good place to put Callo\u2019s container until it was ready for activation. As I left the storage area\u2014even if Callo wasn\u2019t a person yet, putting the container next to rolls of bandages and EpiPens seemed a little much\u2014I went back to the infirmary, where I ran into Dalia, receiving treatment for a nasty forearm gash, grit visibly embedded in the torn skin. I couldn\u2019t help looking: no container in sight.\n Dalia said wryly, \u201cI wanted a good view of the departing shuttles. I didn\u2019t realize there\u2019d be so much wind on a planet.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019d you do with your child?\u201d I asked him.\n He shrugged. \u201cI let Leluye take the container. He wanted two, but he didn\u2019t have the nerve.\u201d\n \u201cOh,\u201d I said. I looked down at Callo\u2019s container.\n \u201cI never wanted children,\u201d Dalia said, catching my gaze. \u201cYou know how it was when everything first happened, though\u2014I couldn\u2019t think of saying no.\u201d He shivered as the medbot smeared gel across his cleaned wound. \u201cI had to send Yi\u2014it back. I think I had to, otherwise I couldn\u2019t move on.\u201d He shook his head.\n None of us were okay. But we had been, once, and could be again. We didn\u2019t have to inflict our trauma on our children, not even if we thought we were saving them from our mistakes. We could build something better. A playground in the soft soil, surrounded by mountains and trees, looking at the stars with excitement, hoping to see meteors consumed in the planet\u2019s atmosphere. \u201cHow close!\u201d they\u2019d say, giggling, and eventually, we\u2019d learn to smile, too.\n \u201cI understand,\u201d I said, patting Dalia\u2019s good shoulder. I went to find another mother, to help me put Callo somewhere safe until I was ready.\n Priya Chand is a California transplant living in the Midwest.

NIHILIST\nMy name is Tetley Abednego and I am the most hated girl in Garbagetown. I am nineteen years old. I live alone in Candle Hole, where I was born, and have no friends except for a deformed gannet bird I\u2019ve named Grape Crush and a motherless elephant seal cub I\u2019ve named Big Bargains, and also the hibiscus flower that has recently decided to grow out of my roof, but I haven\u2019t named it anything yet. I love encyclopedias, a cassette I found when I was eight that says Madeline Brix\u2019s Superboss Mixtape \u201997 on it in very nice handwriting, plays by Mr. Shakespeare or Mr. Webster or Mr. Beckett, lipstick, Garbagetown, and my twin brother Maruchan. Maruchan is the only thing that loves me back, but he\u2019s my twin, so it doesn\u2019t really count. We couldn\u2019t stop loving each other any more than the sea could stop being so greedy and give us back China or drive time radio or polar bears.\nBut he doesn\u2019t visit anymore.\nWhen we were little, Maruchan and I always asked each other the same question before bed. Every night, we crawled into the Us-Fort together\u2014an impregnable stronghold of a bed which we had nailed up ourselves out of the carcasses of several hacked apart bassinets, prams, and cradles. It took up the whole of our bedroom. No one could see us in there, once we closed the porthole (a manhole cover I swiped from Scrapmetal Abbey stamped with stars, a crescent moon, and the magic words New Orleans Water Meter), and we felt certain no one could hear us either. We lay together under our canopy of moldy green lace and shredded buggy-hoods and mobiles with only one shattered fairy fish remaining. Sometimes I asked first and sometimes he did, but we never gave the same answer twice.\n\u201cMaruchan, what do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d\nHe would give it a serious think. Once, I remember, he whispered:\n\u201cWhen I grow up I want to be the Thames!\u201d\n\u201cWhatever for?\u201d I giggled.\n\u201cBecause the Thames got so big and so bossy and so strong that it ate London all up in one go! Nobody tells a Thames what to do or who to eat. A Thames tells you. Imagine having a whole city to eat, and not having to share any! Also there were millions of eels in the Thames and I only get to eat eels at Easter which isn\u2019t fair when I want to eat them all the time.\u201d\nAnd he pretended to bite me and eat me all up. \u201cVery well, you shall be the Thames and I shall be the Mississippi and together we shall eat up the whole world.\u201d\nThen we\u2019d go to sleep and dream the same dream. We always dreamed the same dreams, which was like living twice.\nAfter that, whenever we were hungry, which was always all the time and forever, we\u2019d say we\u2019re bound for London-town! until we drove our parents so mad that they forbade the word London in the house, but you can\u2019t forbid a word, so there.\nEvery morning I wake up to find words painted on my door like toadstools popping up in the night.\nToday it says NIHILIST in big black letters. That\u2019s not so bad! It\u2019s almost sweet! Big Bargains flumps toward me on her fat seal-belly while I light the wicks on my beeswax door and we watch them burn together until the word melts away.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a nihilist, Big Bargains. Do you?\u201d\nShe rolled over onto my matchbox stash so that I would rub her stomach. Rubbing a seal\u2019s stomach is the opposite of nihilism.\nYesterday, an old man hobbled up over a ridge of rusted bicycles and punched me so hard he broke my nose. By law, I had to let him. I had to say: Thank you, Grandfather, for my instruction. I had to stand there and wait in case he wanted to do something else to me. Anything but kill me, those were his rights. But he didn\u2019t want more, he just wanted to cry and ask me why I did it and the law doesn\u2019t say I have to answer that, so I just stared at him until he went away. Once a gang of schoolgirls shaved off all my hair and wrote CUNT in blue marker on the back of my skull. Thank you, sisters, for my instruction. The schoolboys do worse. After graduation they come round and eat my food and hold me down and try to make me cry, which I never do. It\u2019s their rite of passage. Thank you, brothers, for my instruction.\nBut other than that, I\u2019m really a very happy person! I\u2019m awfully lucky when you think about it. Garbagetown is the most wonderful place anybody has ever lived in the history of the world, even if you count the Pyramids and New York City and Camelot. I have Grape Crush and Big Bargains and my hibiscus flower and I can fish like I\u2019ve got bait for a heart so I hardly ever go hungry and once I found a ruby ring and a New Mexico license plate inside a bluefin tuna. Everyone says they only hate me because I annihilated hope and butchered our future, but I know better, and anyway, it\u2019s a lie. Some people are just born to be despised. The Loathing of Tetley began small and grew bigger and bigger, like the Thames, until it swallowed me whole.\nMaruchan and I were born fifty years after the Great Sorting, which is another lucky thing that\u2019s happened to me. After all, I could have been born a Fuckwit and gotten drowned with all the rest of them, or I could have grown up on a Misery Boat, sailing around hopelessly looking for land, or one of the first to realize people could live on a patch of garbage in the Pacific Ocean the size of the place that used to be called Texas, or I could have been a Sorter and spent my whole life moving rubbish from one end of the patch to the other so that a pile of crap could turn into a country and babies could be born in places like Candle Hole or Scrapmetal Abbey or Pill Hill or Toyside or Teagate.\nCandle Hole is the most beautiful place in Garbagetown, which is the most beautiful place in the world. All the stubs of candles the Fuckwits threw out piled up into hills and mountains and caverns and dells, votive candles and taper candles and tea lights and birthday candles and big fat colorful pillar candles, stacked and somewhat melted into a great crumbling gorgeous warren of wicks and wax. All the houses are little cozy honeycombs melted into the hillside, with smooth round windows and low golden ceilings. At night, from far away, Candle Hole looks like a firefly palace. When the wind blows, it smells like cinnamon, and freesia, and cranberries, and lavender, and Fresh Linen Scent, and New Car Smell.\n2. THE TERRIBLE POWER OF FUCKWIT CAKE\nOur parents\u2019 names are Life and Time. Time lay down on her Fresh Linen Scent wax bed and I came out of her first, then Maruchan. But even though I got here first, I came out blue as the ocean, not breathing, with the umbilical cord wrapped round my neck and Maruchan wailing, still squeezing onto my noose with his tiny fist, like he was trying to get me free. Doctor Pimms unstrangled and unblued me and put me in a Hawaiian Fantasies-scented wax hollow in our living room. I lay there alone, too startled by living to cry, until the sun came up and Life and Time remembered I had survived. Maruchan was so healthy and sweet-natured and strong and, even though Garbagetown is the most beautiful place in the world, many children don\u2019t live past a year or two. We don\u2019t even get names until we turn ten. (Before that, we answer happily to Girl or Boy or Child or Darling.) Better to focus on the one that will grow up rather than get attached to the sickly poor beast who hasn\u2019t got a chance.\nI was born already a ghost. But I was a very noisy ghost. I screamed and wept at all hours while Life and Time waited for me to die. I only nursed when my brother was full, I only played with toys he forgot, I only spoke after he had spoken. Maruchan said his first word at the supper table: please. What a lovely, polite word for a lovely, polite child! After they finished cooing over him, I very calmly turned to my mother and said: Mama, may I have a scoop of mackerel roe? It is my favorite. I thought they would be so proud! After all, I made twelve more words than my brother. This was my moment, the wonderful moment when they would realize that they did love me and I wasn\u2019t going to die and I was special and good. But everyone got very quiet. They were not happy that the ghost could talk. I had been able to for ages, but everything in my world said to wait for my brother before I could do anything at all. No, you may not have mackerel roe, because you are a deceitful wicked little show-off child.\nWhen we turned ten, we went to fetch our names. This is just the most terribly exciting thing for a Garbagetown kid. At ten, you are a real person. At ten, people want to know you. At ten, you will probably live for a good while yet. This is how you catch a name: wake up to the fabulous new world of being ten and greet your birthday Frankencake (a hodgepodge of well-preserved Fuckwit snack cakes filled with various cr\u00e8mes and jellies). Choose a slice, with much fanfare. Inside, your adoring and/or neglectful mother will have hidden various small objects\u2014an aluminum pull tab, a medicine bottle cap, a broken earring, a coffee bean, a wee striped capacitor, a tiny plastic rocking horse, maybe a postage stamp. Remove item from your mouth without cutting yourself or eating it. Now, walk in the direction of your prize. Toward Aluminumopolis or Pill Hill or Spanglestoke or Teagate or Electric City or Toyside or Lost Post Gulch. Walk and walk and walk. Never once brush yourself off or wash in the ocean, even after camping on a pile of magazines or wishbones or pregnancy tests or wrapping paper with glitter reindeer on it. Walk until nobody knows you. When, finally, a stranger hollers at you to get out of the way or go back where you came from or stop stealing the good rubbish, they will, without even realizing, call you by your true name, and you can begin to pick and stumble your way home.\nMy brother grabbed a chocolate snack cake with a curlicue of white icing on it. I chose a pink and red tigery striped hunk of cake filled with gooshy cr\u00e8me de something. The sugar hit our brains like twin tsunamis. He spat out a little gold earring with the post broken off. I felt a smooth, hard gelcap lozenge in my mouth. Pill Hill it was then, and the great mountain of Fuckwit anxiety medication. But when I carefully pulled the thing out, it was a little beige capacitor with red stripes instead. Electric City! I\u2019d never been half so far. Richies lived in Electric City. Richies and brightboys and dazzlegirls and kerosene kings. My brother was off in the opposite direction, toward Spanglestoke and the desert of engagement rings.\nMaybe none of it would have happened if I\u2019d gone to Spanglestoke for my name instead. If I\u2019d never seen the gasoline gardens of Engine Row. If I\u2019d gone home straightaway after finding my name. If I\u2019d never met Goodnight Moon in the brambles of Hazmat Heath with all the garbage stars rotting gorgeously overhead. Such is the terrible power of Fuckwit Cake.\nI walked cheerfully out of Candle Hole with my St. Oscar backpack strapped on tight and didn\u2019t look back once. Why should I? St. Oscar had my back. I\u2019m not really that religious nowadays. But everyone\u2019s religious when they\u2019re ten. St. Oscar was a fuzzy green Fuckwit man who lived in a garbage can just like me, and frowned a lot just like me. He understood me and loved me and knew how to bring civilization out of trash and I loved him back even though he was a Fuckwit. Nobody chooses how they get born. Not even Oscar.\nSo I scrambled up over the wax ridges of my home and into the world with Oscar on my back. The Matchbox Forest rose up around me: towers of EZ Strike matchbooks and boxes from impossible, magical places like the Coronado Hotel, Becky\u2019s Diner, the Fox and Hound Pub. Garbagetowners picked through heaps and cairns of blackened, used matchsticks looking for the precious ones that still had their red and blue heads intact. But I knew all those pickers. They couldn\u2019t give me a name. I waved at the hotheads. I climbed up Flintwheel Hill, my feet slipping and sliding on the mountain of spent butane lighters, until I could see out over all of Garbagetown just as the broiling cough-drop red sun was setting over Far Boozeaway, hitting the crystal bluffs of stockpiled whiskey and gin bottles and exploding into a billion billion rubies tumbling down into the hungry sea.\nI sang a song from school to the sun and the matchsticks. It\u2019s an ask-and-answer song, so I had to sing both parts myself, which feels very odd when you have always had a twin to do the asking or the answering, but I didn\u2019t mind.\nWho liked it hot and hated snow?\nThe Fuckwits did! The Fuckwits did!\nWho ate up every thing that grows?\nThe Fuckwits did! The Fuckwits did!\nWho drowned the world in oceans blue?\nThe Fuckwits did! The Fuckwits did!\nWho took the land from me and you?\nThe Fuckwits did, we know it\u2019s true!\nAre you Fuckwits, children dear?\nWe\u2019re GARBAGETOWNERS, free and clear!\nBut who made the garbage, rich and rank?\nThe Fuckwits did, and we give thanks.\nThe Lawn stretched out below me, full of the grass clippings and autumn leaves and fallen branches and banana peels and weeds and gnawed bones and eggshells of the fertile Fuckwit world, slowly turning into the gold of Garbagetown: soil. Real earth. Terra bloody firma. We can already grow rice in the dells. And here and there, big, blowsy flowers bang up out of the rot: hibiscus, African tulips, bitter gourds, a couple of purple lotuses floating in the damp mucky bits. I slept next to a blue-and-white orchid that looked like my brother\u2019s face.\n\u201cOrchid, what do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d I whispered to it. In real life, it didn\u2019t say anything back. It just fluttered a little in the moonlight and the sea wind. But when I got around to dreaming, I dreamed about the orchid, and it said: a farm.\n3. MURDERCUNT\nIn Garbagetown, you think real hard about what you\u2019re gonna eat next, where the fresh water\u2019s at, and where you\u2019re gonna sleep. Once all that\u2019s settled you can whack your mind on nicer stuff, like gannets and elephant seals and what to write next on the Bitch of Candle Hole\u2019s door. (This morning I melted MURDERCUNT off the back wall of my house. Big Bargains flopped down next to me and watched the blocky red painted letters swirl and fade into the Buttercream Birthday Cake wax. Maybe I\u2019ll name my hibiscus flower Murdercunt. It has a nice big sound.)\nWhen I remember hunting my name, I mostly remember the places I slept. It\u2019s a real dog to find good spots. Someplace sheltered from the wind, without too much seawater seep, where no-one\u2019ll yell at you for wastreling on their patch or try to stick it in you in the middle of the night just because you\u2019re all alone and it looks like you probably don\u2019t have a knife.\nI always have a knife.\nSo I slept with St. Oscar the Grouch for my pillow, in the shadow of a mountain of black chess pieces in Gamegrange, under a thicket of tabloids and Wall Street Journals and remaindered novels with their covers torn off in Bookbury, snuggled into a spaghetti-pile of unspooled cassette ribbon on the outskirts of the Sound Downs, on the lee side of a little soggy Earl Grey hillock in Teagate. In the morning I sucked on a few of the tea bags and the dew on them tasted like the loveliest cuppa any Fuckwit ever poured his stupid self. I said my prayers on beds of old microwaves and moldy photographs of girls with perfect hair kissing at the camera. St. Oscar, keep your mighty lid closed over me. Look grouchily but kindly upon me and protect me as I travel through the infinite trash can of your world. Show me the beautiful usefulness of your Blessed Rubbish. Let me not be Taken Out before I find my destiny.\nBut my destiny didn\u2019t seem to want to find me. As far as I walked, I still saw people I knew. Mr. Zhu raking his mushroom garden, nestled in a windbreak of broken milk bottles. Miss Amancharia gave me one of the coconut crabs out of her nets, which was very nice of her, but hardly a name. Even as far away as Teagate, I saw Tropicana Sita welding a refrigerator door to a hull-metal shack. She flipped up her mask and waved at me. Dammit! She was Allsorts Sita\u2019s cousin, and Allsorts drank with my mother every Thursday at the Black Wick.\nBy the time I walked out of Teagate I\u2019d been gone eight days. I was getting pretty ripe. Bits and pieces of Garbagetown were stuck all over my clothes, but no tidying up. Them\u2019s the rules. I could see the blue crackle of Electric City sparkling up out of the richie-rich Coffee Bean \u2019Burbs. Teetering towers of batteries rose up like desert hoodoo spires\u2014AA, AAA, 12 Volt, DD, car, solar, lithium, anything you like. Parrots and pelicans screamed down the battery canyons, their talons kicking off sprays of AAAs that tumbled down the heights like rockslides. Sleepy banks of generators rumbled pleasantly along a river of wires and extension cords and HDMI cables. Fields of delicate lightbulbs wind-chimed in the breeze. Anything that had a working engine lived here. Anything that still had juice. If Garbagetown had a heart, it was Electric City. Electric City pumped power. Power and privilege.\nIn Electric City, the lights of the Fuckwit world were still on.\n4. GOODNIGHT GARBAGETOWN\n\u201cOi, Tetley! Fuck off back home to your darkhole! We\u2019re full up on little cunts here!\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s how I got my name. Barely past the battery spires of Electric City, a fat gas-huffing fucksack voltage jockey called me a little cunt. But he also called me Tetley. He brayed it down from a pyramid of telephones and his friends all laughed and drank home brew out of a glass jug and went back to not working. I looked down\u2014among the many scraps of rubbish clinging to my shirt and pants and backpack and hair was a bright blue tea bag wrapper with TETLEY CLASSIC BLEND BLACK TEA written on it in cheerful white letters, clinging to my chest.\nI tried to feel the power of my new name. The me-ness of it. I tried to imagine my mother and father when they were young, waking up with some torn out page of Life or Time magazine stuck to their rears, not even noticing until someone barked out their whole lives for a laugh. But I couldn\u2019t feel anything while the volt-humpers kept on staring at me like I was nothing but a used-up potato battery. I didn\u2019t even know then that the worst swear word in Electric City was dark. I didn\u2019t know they were waiting to see how mad I\u2019d get \u2019cause they called my home a darkhole. I didn\u2019t care. They were wrong and stupid. Except for the hole part. Candle Hole never met a dark it couldn\u2019t burn down.\nMaybe I should have gone home right then. I had my name! Time to hoof it back over the river and through the woods, girl. But I\u2019d never seen Electric City and it was morning and if I stayed gone awhile longer maybe they\u2019d miss me. Maybe they\u2019d worry. And maybe now they\u2019d love me, now that I was a person with a name. Maybe I could even filch a couple of batteries or a cup of gasoline and turn up at my parents\u2019 door in turbo-powered triumph. I\u2019d tell my brother all my adventures and he\u2019d look at me like I was magic on a stick and everything would be good forever and ever amen.\nSo I wandered. I gawped. It was like being in school and learning the Fuckwit song only I was walking around inside the Fuckwit song and it was all still happening right now everywhere. Electric City burbled and bubbled and clanged and belched and smoked just like the bad old world before it all turned blue. Everyone had such fine things! I saw a girl wearing a ball gown out of a fairy book, green and glitter and miles of ruffles and she wasn\u2019t even going anywhere. She was just tending her gasoline garden out the back of her little cottage, which wasn\u2019t made out of candles or picture-books or cat food cans, but real cottage parts! Mostly doors and shutters and really rather a lot of windows, but they fit together like they never even needed the other parts of a house in the first place. And the girl in her green-glitter dress carried a big red watering can around her garden, sprinkling fuel stabilizer into her tidy rows of petrol barrels and gas cans with their graceful spouts pointed toward the sun. Why not wear that dress all the time? Just a wineglass full of what she was growing in her garden would buy almost anything else in Garbagetown. She smiled shyly at me. I hated her. And I wanted to be her.\nBy afternoon I was bound for London-town, so hungry I could\u2019ve slurped up every eel the Thames ever had. There\u2019s no food lying around in Electric City. In Candle Hole I could\u2019ve grabbed candy or a rice ball or jerky off any old midden heap. But here everybody owned their piece and kept it real neat, mercilessly neat, and they didn\u2019t share. I sat down on a rusty Toyota transmission and fished around in my backpack for crumbs. My engine sat on one side of a huge cyclone fence. I\u2019d never seen one all put together before. Sure, you find torn-off shreds of wire fences, but this one was all grown up, with proper locks and chain wire all over it. It meant to Keep You Out. Inside, like hungry dogs, endless barrels and freezers and cylinders and vats went on and on, with angry writing on them that said HAZMAT or BIOHAZARD or RADIOACTIVE or WARNING or DANGER or CLASSIFIED.\n\u201cGot anything good in there?\u201d said a boy\u2019s voice. I looked round and saw a kid my own age, with wavy black hair and big brown eyes and three little moles on his forehead. He was wearing the nicest clothes I ever saw on a boy\u2014a blue suit that almost, almost fit him. With a tie.\n\u201cNaw,\u201d I answered. \u201cJust a dry sweater, an empty can of Cheez Whiz, and Madeline Brix\u2019s Superboss Mixtape \u201997. It\u2019s my good luck charm.\u201d I showed him my beloved mixtape. Madeline Brix made all the dots on her i\u2019s into hearts. It was a totally Fuckwit thing to do and I loved her for it even though she was dead and didn\u2019t care if I loved her or not.\n\u201cCool,\u201d the boy said, and I could tell he meant it. He didn\u2019t even call me a little cunt or anything. He pushed his thick hair out of his face. \u201cListen, you really shouldn\u2019t be here. No one\u2019s gonna say anything because you\u2019re not Electrified, but it\u2019s so completely dangerous. They put all that stuff in one place so it couldn\u2019t get out and hurt anyone.\u201d\n\u201cElectrified?\u201d\n\u201cOne of us. Local.\u201d He had the decency to look embarrassed. \u201cAnyway, I saw you and I thought that if some crazy darkgirl is gonna have a picnic on Hazmat Heath, I could at least help her not die while she\u2019s doing it.\u201d\nThe boy held out his hand. He was holding a gas mask. He showed me how to fasten it under my hair. The sun started to set rosily behind a tangled briar of motherboards. Everything turned pink and gold and slow and sleepy. I climbed down from my engine tuffet and lay under the fence next to the boy in the suit. He\u2019d brought a mask for himself too. We looked at each other through the eyeholes.\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Goodnight Moon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMine\u2019s . . . \u201d And I did feel my new name swirling up inside me then, like good tea, like cream and sugar cubes, like the most essential me. \u201cTetley.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you a darkgirl, Tetley.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a nice thing to call someone.\u201d\n\u201cI like it. It sounds pretty.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. I promise. Do you forgive me?\u201d\nI tugged on the hose of my gas mask. The air coming through tasted like nickels. \u201cSure. I\u2019m aces at forgiving. Been practicing all my life. Besides . . . \u201d My turn to go red in the face. \u201cAt the Black Wick they\u2019d probably call you a brightboy and that\u2019s not as pretty as it sounds, either.\u201d\nGoodnight Moon\u2019s brown eyes stared out at me from behind thick glass. It was the closest I\u2019d ever been to a boy who wasn\u2019t my twin. Goodnight Moon didn\u2019t feel like a twin. He felt like the opposite of a twin. We never shared a womb, but on the other end of it all, we might still share a grave. His tie was burgundy with green swirls in it. He hadn\u2019t tied it very well, so I could see the skin of his throat, which was very clean and probably very soft.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you want to hear your tape?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean hear it? It\u2019s not for hearing, it\u2019s for luck.\u201d\nGoodnight Moon laughed. His laugh burst all over me like butterfly bombs. He reached into his suit jacket and pulled out a thick black rectangle. I handed him Madeline Brix\u2019s Superboss Mixtape \u201997 and he hit a button on the side of the rectangle. It popped open; Goodnight Moon slotted in my tape and handed me one end of a long wire.\n\u201cPut it in your ear,\u201d he said, and I did.\nA man\u2019s voice filled up my head from my jawbone up to the plates of my skull. The most beautiful and saddest voice that ever was. A voice like Candle Hole all lit up at twilight. A voice like the whole old world calling up from the bottom of the sea. The man on Madeline Brix\u2019s tape was saying he was happy, and he hoped I was happy, too.\nGoodnight Moon reached out to hold my hand just as the sky went black and starry. I was crying. He was, too. Our tears dripped out of our gas masks onto the rusty road of Electric City.\nWhen the tape ended, I dug in my backpack for a match and a stump of candle: dark red, Holiday Memories scent. I lit it at the same moment that Goodnight Moon pulled a little flashlight out of his pocket and turned it on. We held our glowings between us. We were the same.\n5. BRIGHTBITCH\nAllsorts Sita came to visit me today. Clicked my knocker early in the morning, early enough that I could be sure she\u2019d never slept in the first place. I opened for her, as I am required to do. She looked up at me with eyes like bullet holes, leaning on my waxy hinges, against the T in BRIGHTBITCH, thoughtfully scrawled in what appeared to be human shit across the front of my hut. BRIGHTBITCH smelled, but Allsorts Sita smelled worse. Her breath punched me in the nose before she did. I got a lungful of what Diet Sprite down at the Black Wick optimistically called \u201ccognac\u201d: the thick pinkish booze you could get by extracting the fragrance oil and preservatives out of candles and mixing it with wood alcohol the kids over in Furnitureford boiled out of dining sets and china cabinets. Smells like flowers vomited all over a New Car and then killed a badger in the back seat. Allsorts Sita looked like she\u2019d drunk so much cognac you could light one strand of her hair and she\u2019d burn for eight days.\n\u201cYou fucking whore,\u201d she slurred.\n\u201cThank you, Auntie, for my instruction,\u201d I answered quietly.\nI have a place I go to in my mind when I have visitors who aren\u2019t seals or gannet birds or hibiscus flowers. A little house made all of doors and windows, where I wear a green-glitter dress every day and water my gas can garden and read by electric light.\n\u201cI hate you. I hate you. How could you do it? We raised you and fed you and this is how you repay it all. You ungrateful bitch.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Auntie, for my instruction.\u201d\nIn my head I ran my fingers along a cyclone fence and all the barrels on the other side read LIFE and LOVE and FORGIVENESS and UNDERSTANDING.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve killed us all,\u201d Allsorts Sita moaned. She puked up magenta cognac on my stoop. When she was done puking she hit me over and over with closed fists. It didn\u2019t hurt too much. Allsorts is a small woman. But it hurt when she clawed my face and my breasts with her fingernails. Blood came up like wax spilling and when she finished she passed out cold, halfway in my house, halfway out.\n\u201cThank you, Auntie, for my instruction,\u201d I said to her sleeping body. My blood dripped onto her, but in my head I was lying on my roof made of two big church doors in a gas mask listening to a man sing to me that he\u2019s never done bad things and he hopes I\u2019m happy, he hopes I\u2019m happy, he hopes I\u2019m happy.\nBig Bargains moaned mournfully and the lovely roof melted away like words on a door. My elephant seal friend flopped and fretted. When they\u2019ve gone for my face she can\u2019t quite recognize me and it troubles her seal-soul something awful. Grape Crush, my gannet bird, never worries about silly things like facial wounds. He just brings me fish and pretty rocks. When I found him, he had a plastic six-pack round his neck with one can still stuck in the thing, dragging along behind him like a ball and chain. Big Bargains was choking on an ad insert. She\u2019d probably smelled some ancient fish and chips grease lurking in the headlines. They only love me because I saved them. That doesn\u2019t always work. I saved everyone else, too, and all I got back was blood and shit and loneliness.\n6. REVLON SUPER LUSTROUS 919: RED RUIN\nI went home with my new name fastened on tight. Darkgirls can\u2019t stay in Electric City. Can\u2019t live there unless you\u2019re born there and I was only ten anyway. Goodnight Moon kissed me before I left. He still had his gas mask on so mainly our breathing hoses wound around each other like gentle elephants but I still call it a kiss. He smelled like scorched ozone and metal and paraffin and hope.\nA few months later, Electric City put up a fence around the whole place. Hung up an old rusty shop sign that said EXCUSE OUR MESS WHILE WE RENOVATE. No one could go in or out except to trade and that had to get itself done on the dark side of the fence.\nMy mother and father didn\u2019t start loving me when I got back even though I brought six AA batteries out of the back of Goodnight Moon\u2019s tape player. My brother had got a ramen flavor packet stuck in his hair somewhere outside the Grocery Isle and was every inch of him Maruchan. A few years later I heard Life and Time telling some cousin how their marvelous and industrious and thoughtful boy had gone out in search of a name and brought back six silver batteries, enough to power anything they could dream of. What a child! What a son! So fuck them, I guess.\nBut Maruchan did bring something back. It just wasn\u2019t for our parents. When we crawled into the Us-Fort that first night back, we lay uncomfortably against each other. We were the same, but we weren\u2019t. We\u2019d had separate adventures for the first time, and Maruchan could never understand why I wanted to sleep with a gas mask on now.\n\u201cTetley, what do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d Maruchan whispered in the dark of our pram-maze.\n\u201cElectrified,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cWhat do you want to be?\u201d\n\u201cSafe,\u201d he said. Things had happened to Maruchan, too, and I couldn\u2019t share them anymore than he could hear Madeline Brix\u2019s songs.\nMy twin pulled something out of his pocket and pushed it into my hand till my fingers closed round it reflexively. It was hard and plastic and warm.\n\u201cI love you, Tetley. Happy Birthday.\u201d\nI opened my fist. Maruchan had stolen lipstick for me. Revlon Super Lustrous 919: Red Ruin, worn almost all the way down to the nub by some dead woman\u2019s lips.\nAfter that, a lot of years went by but they weren\u2019t anything special.\n7. IF GOD TURNED UP FOR SUPPER\nI was seventeen years old when Brighton Pier came to Garbagetown. I was tall and my hair was the color of an oil spill; I sang pretty good and did figures in my head and I could make a candle out of damn near anything. People wanted to marry me here and there but I didn\u2019t want to marry them back so they thought I was stuck up. Who wouldn\u2019t want to get hitched to handsome Candyland Ocampo and ditch Candle Hole for a clean, fresh life in Soapthorpe where bubbles popped all day long like diamonds in your hair? Well, I didn\u2019t, because he had never kissed me with a gas mask on and he smelled like Pine Fresh cleaning solutions and not like scorched ozone at all.\nLife and Time turned into little kids right in front of us. They giggled and whispered and Mum washed her hair in the sea about nine times and then soaked it in oil until it shone. Papa tucked a candle stump that had melted just right and looked like a perfect rose into her big no fancy hairdo and then, like it was a completely normal thing to do, put on a cloak sewn out of about a hundred different neckties. They looked like a prince and a princess.\n\u201cBrighton Pier came last when I was a girl, before I even had my name,\u201d Time told us, still giggling and blushing like she wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s mother. \u201cIt\u2019s the most wonderful thing that can ever happen in the world.\u201d\n\u201cIf God turned up for supper and brought all the dry land back for dessert, it wouldn\u2019t be half as good as one day on Brighton Pier,\u201d Life crowed. He picked me up in his arms and twirled me around in the air. He\u2019d never done that before, not once, and he had his heart strapped on so tight he didn\u2019t even stop and realize what he\u2019d done and go vacant-eyed and find something else to look at for a long while. He just squeezed me and kissed me like I came from somewhere and I didn\u2019t know what the hell a Brighton Pier was but I loved it already.\n\u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d Maruchan and I squealed, because you can catch happiness like a plague.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better the first time if you don\u2019t know,\u201d Mum assured us. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to dock in Electric City on Friday.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a ship, then?\u201d Maruchan said. But Papa just twinkled his eyes at us and put his finger over his lips to keep the secret in.\nThe Pier meant to dock in Electric City. My heart fell into my stomach, got all digested up, and sizzled out into the rest of me all at once. Of course, of course it would, Electric City had the best docks, the sturdiest, the prettiest. But it seemed to me like life was happening to me on purpose, and Electric City couldn\u2019t keep a darkgirl out anymore. They had to share like the rest of us.\n\u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up, Maruchan?\u201d I said to my twin in the dark the night before we set off to see what was better than God. Maruchan\u2019s eyes gleamed with the Christmas thrill of it all.\n\u201cBrighton Pier,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d I sighed, and we both dreamed we were beautiful Fuckwits running through a forest of real pines, laughing and stopping to eat apples and running again and only right before we woke up did we notice that something was chasing us, something huge and electric and bound for London-town.\n8. CITIZENS OF MUTATION NATION\nI looked for Goodnight Moon everywhere from the moment we crossed into Electric City. The fence had gone and Garbagetown poured in and nothing was different than it had been when I got my name off the battery spires, even though the sign had said for so long that Electric City was renovating. I played a terrible game with every person that shoved past, every face in a window, every shadow juddering down an alley and the game was: are you him? But I lost all the hands. The only time I stopped playing was when I first saw Brighton Pier.\nI couldn\u2019t get my eyes around it. It was a terrible, gorgeous whale of light and colors and music and otherness. All along a boardwalk jugglers danced and singers sang and horns horned and accordions squeezed and under it all some demonic engine screamed and wheezed. Great glass domes and towers and flags and tents glowed in the sunset but Brighton Pier made the sunset look plain-faced and unloveable. A huge wheel full of pink and emerald electric lights turned slowly in the warm wind but went nowhere. People leapt and turned somersaults and stood on each other\u2019s shoulders and they all wore such soft, vivid costumes, like they\u2019d all been cut out of a picture-book too fine for anyone like me to read. The tumblers lashed the pier to the Electric City docks and cut the engines and after that it was nothing but music so thick and good you could eat it out of the air.\nLife and Time hugged Maruchan and cheered with the rest of Garbagetown. Tears ran down their faces. Everyone\u2019s faces.\n\u201cWhen the ice melted and the rivers revolted and the Fuckwit world went under the seas,\u201d Papa whispered through his weeping, \u201ca great mob hacked Brighton Pier off of Brighton and strapped engines to it and set sail across the blue. They\u2019ve been going ever since. They go around the world and around again, to the places where there\u2019s still people, and trade their beauty for food and fuel. There\u2019s a place on Brighton Pier where if you look just right, it\u2019s like nothing ever drowned.\u201d\nA beautiful man wearing a hat of every color and several bells stepped up on a pedestal and held a long pale cone to his mouth. The mayor of Electric City embraced him with two meaty arms and asked his terrible, stupid, unforgivable question: \u201cHave you seen dry land?\u201d\nAnd the beautiful man answered him: \u201cWith my own eyes.\u201d\nA roar went up like angels dying. I covered my ears. The mayor covered his mouth with his hands, speechless, weeping. The beautiful man patted him awkwardly on the back. Then he turned to us.\n\u201cHello, Garbagetown!\u201d he cried out and his voice sounded like everyone\u2019s most secret heart.\nWe screamed so loud every bird in Garbagetown fled to the heavens and we clapped like mad and some people fell onto the ground and buried their faces in old batteries.\n\u201cMy name is Emperor William Shakespeare the Eleventh and I am the Master of Brighton Pier! We will be performing Twelfth Night on the great stage tonight at seven o\u2019clock, followed by The Duchess of Malfi at ten (which has werewolves) and a midnight acrobatic display! Come one, come all! Let Madame Limelight tell your FORTUNE! TEST your strength with the Hammer of the Witches! SEE the wonders of the Fuckwit World in our Memory Palace! Get letters and news from the LAST HUMAN OUTPOSTS around the globe! GASP at the citizens of Mutation Nation in the Freak Tent! Sample a FULL MINUTE of real television, still high definition after all these years! Concerts begin in the Crystal Courtyard in fifteen minutes! Our Peep Shows feature only the FINEST actresses reading aloud from GENUINE Fuckwit historical records! Garbagetown, we are here to DAZZLE you!\u201d\nA groan went up from the crowds like each Garbagetowner was just then bedding their own great lost love and they heaved toward the lights, the colors, the horns and the voices, the silk and the electricity and the life floating down there, knotted to the edge of our little pile of trash.\nSomeone grabbed my hand and held me back while my parents, my twin, my world streamed away from me down to the Pier. No one looked back.\n\u201cAre you her?\u201d said Goodnight Moon. He looked longer and leaner but not really older. He had on his tie.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and nothing was different than it had been when I got my name except now neither of us had masks and our kisses weren\u2019t like gentle elephants but like a boy and a girl and I forgot all about my strength and my fortune and the wonderful wheel of light turning around and around and going nowhere.\n9. TERRORWHORE\nActors are liars. Writers, too. The whole lot of them, even the horn players and the fortune-tellers and the freaks and the strongmen. Even the ladies with rings in their noses and high heels on their feet playing violins all along the pier and the lie they are all singing and dancing and saying is: we can get the old world back again.\nMy door said TERRORWHORE this morning. I looked after my potato plants and my hibiscus and thought about whether or not I would ever get to have sex again. Seemed unlikely. Big Bargains concurred.\nGoodnight Moon and I lost our virginities in the Peep Show tent while a lady in green fishnet stockings and a lavender garter read to us from the dinner menu of the Dorchester Hotel circa 2005.\n\u201cWhole Berkshire roasted chicken stuffed with black truffles, walnuts, duck confit, and dauphinoise potatoes,\u201d the lady purred. Goodnight Moon devoured my throat with kisses, bites, need. \u201cDrizzled with a balsamic reduction and rosemary honey.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s honey?\u201d I gasped. We could see her but she couldn\u2019t see us, which was for the best. The glass in the window only went one way.\n\u201cBeats me, kid,\u201d she shrugged, re-crossing her legs the other way. \u201cSomething you drizzle.\u201d She went on. \u201cSticky toffee pudding with lashings of cream and salted caramel, passion fruit souffl\u00e9 topped with orbs of pistachio ice cream . . . \u201d\nGoodnight Moon smelled just as I remembered. Scorched ozone and metal and paraffin and hope and when he was inside me it was like hearing my name for the first time. I couldn\u2019t escape the me-ness of it, the us-ness of it, the sound and the shape of ourselves turning into our future.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d he whispered into my breast. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is us.\u201d\nThe lady\u2019s voice drifted over my head. \u201cLamb cutlets on a bed of spiced butternut squash, wilted greens, and delicate hand-harvested mushrooms served with goat cheese in clouds of pastry . . . \u201d\nGoodnight Moon kissed my hair, my ears, my eyelids. \u201cAnd now that the land\u2019s come back Electric City\u2019s gonna save us all. We can go home together, you and me, and build a house and we\u2019ll have a candle in every window so you always feel at home . . . \u201d\nThe Dorchester dinner menu stopped abruptly. The lady dropped to her fishnetted knees and peered at us through the glass, her brilliant glossy red hair tumbling down, her spangled eyes searching for us beyond the glass.\n\u201cWhoa, sweetie, slow down,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re liable to scare a girl off that way.\u201d\nAll I could see in the world was Goodnight Moon\u2019s brown eyes and the sweat drying on his brown chest. Brown like the earth and all its promises. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cYou scared, Tetley?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNothing can scare us now. Emperor Shakespeare said he\u2019s seen land, real dry land, and we have a plan and we\u2019re gonna get everything back again and be fat happy Fuckwits like we were always supposed to be.\u201d\nThe Peep Show girl\u2019s glittering eyes filled up with tears. She put her hand on the glass. \u201cOh . . . oh, baby . . . that\u2019s just something we say. We always say it. To everyone. It\u2019s our best show. Gives people hope, you know? But there\u2019s nothing out there, sugar. Nothing but ocean and more ocean and a handful of drifty lifeboat cities like yours circling the world like horses on a broken-down carousel. Nothing but blue.\u201d\n10. WE ARE SO LUCKY\nIt would be nice for me if you could just say you understand. I want to hear that just once. Goodnight Moon didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t believe her and he didn\u2019t believe me and he sold me out in the end in spite of gas masks and kissing and Madeline Brix and the man crooning in our ears that he was happy because all he could hear was Emperor William Shakespeare the Eleventh singing out his big lie. RESURRECTION! REDEMPTION! REVIVIFICATION! LAND HO!\n\u201cNo, because, see,\u201d my sweetheart wept on the boardwalk while the wheel spun dizzily behind his head like an electric candy crown, \u201cwe have a plan. We\u2019ve worked so hard. It has to happen. The mayor said as soon as we had news of dry land, the minute we knew, we\u2019d turn it on and we\u2019d get there first and the continents would be ours, Garbagetowners, we\u2019d inherit the Earth. He\u2019s gonna tell everyone when the Pier leaves. At the farewell party.\u201d\n\u201cTurn what on?\u201d\nResurrection. Redemption. Renovation. All those years behind the fence Electric City had been so busy. Disassembling all those engines they hoarded so they could make a bigger one, the biggest one. Pooling fuel in great vast stills. Practicing ignition sequences. Carving up a countryside they\u2019d never even seen between the brightboys and brightgirls and we could have some, too, if we were good.\n\u201cYou want to turn Garbagetown into a Misery Boat,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo we can just steam on ahead into nothing and go mad and use up all the gas and batteries that could keep us happy in mixtapes for another century here in one hot minute.\u201d\n\u201cThe Emperor said . . . \u201d\n\u201cHe said his name was Duke Orsino of Illyria, too. And then Roderigo when they did the werewolf play. Do you believe that? If they\u2019d found land, don\u2019t you think they\u2019d have stayed there?\u201d\nBut he couldn\u2019t hear me. Neither could Maruchan when I tried to tell him the truth in the Peep Show. All they could see was green. Green leafy trees and green grass and green ivy in some park that was lying at the bottom of the sea. We dreamed different dreams now, my brother and I, and all my dreams were burning.\nSay you understand. I had to. I\u2019m not a nihilist or a murdercunt or a terrorwhore. They were gonna use up every last drop of Garbagetown\u2019s power to go nowhere and do nothing and instead of measuring out teaspoons of good, honest gas, so that it lasts and we last all together, no single thing on the patch would ever turn on again, and we\u2019d go dark, really dark, forever. Dark like the bottom of a hole. They had no right. They don\u2019t understand. This is it. This is the future. Garbagetown and the sea. We can\u2019t go back, not ever, not even for a minute. We are so lucky. Life is so good. We\u2019re going on and being alive and being shitty sometimes and lovely sometimes just the same as we always have, and only a Fuckwit couldn\u2019t see that.\nI waited until Brighton Pier cast off, headed to the next rickety harbor of floating foolboats, filled with players and horns and glittering wheels and Dorchester menus and fresh mountains of letters we wouldn\u2019t read the answers to for another twenty years. I waited until everyone was sleeping so nobody would get hurt except the awful engine growling and panting to deliver us into the dark salt nothing of an empty hellpromise.\nIt isn\u2019t hard to build a bomb in Electric City. It\u2019s all just laying around behind that fence where a boy held my hand for the first time. All you need is a match.\n11. WHAT YOU CAME FOR\nIt\u2019s such a beautiful day out. My hibiscus is just gigantic, red as the hair on a Peep Show dancer. If you want to wait, Big Bargains will be round later for her afternoon nap. Grape Crush usually brings a herring by in the evening. But I understand if you\u2019ve got other places to be.\nIt\u2019s okay. You can hit me now. If you want to. It\u2019s what you came for. I barely feel it anymore.\nThank you for my instruction.\nOriginally published in Drowned Worlds, edited by Jonathan Strahan.\nCatherynne M.

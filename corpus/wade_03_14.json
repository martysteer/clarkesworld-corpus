She studies hard.\u201d\n \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t sleep enough. Look how she\u2019s fallen apart since her father\u2019s work reassignment.\u201d\n \u201cHer grandmother isn\u2019t taking good care of her. She needs someone to take care of her.\u201d\n \u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019d lose her spirit.\u201d\n \u201cShe would not.\u201d\n I\u2019d scream at them to shut up, but I wouldn\u2019t want to wake Obaa-chan. Instead, when the pressure in my head wants to break me, and I hear the metallic ticking and the rustling get closer, I slip my feet into my zori sandals on the back step and hop out into the narrow space behind our apartment. Beyond the wall with its leafless ivy, the late train rushes by with a shudder and a shriek and I can scream as loud as I like and nobody will hear.\n I won\u2019t pass the exams.\n I have to pass the exams.\n \u201cShe\u2019s mine,\u201d says rusty trumpet. And whistle argues, \u201cNo, she\u2019s mine.\u201d\n Sometimes I just want to leave the world.\n Obaa-chan made me name tags so I could sew them into my high school uniform: Kitano Naoko. I didn\u2019t want to throw away the extras, so I stitched them into my Gothic-girl cosplay. One in the spiderweb stockings, another in the white crinoline, another for the black minidress with the lace-up bodice. Small links back to the ordinary me.\n My costume\u2019s still missing something.\n In the bathroom of Harajuku station, I stand at the mirror beside a college girl in platform shoes. Her hair is dyed cherry-red, and she paints her lips into a big pink kiss. I can\u2019t afford platform shoes, and if I dyed my hair they wouldn\u2019t let me back in school. I draw black tears down my cheeks, and walk out into the icy January rain.\n I\u2019m the only one standing on the bridge. My other world is empty: no crowd of cosplayers to talk to, no music to lose myself in. Even Cherry Girl crosses and heads down Takeshita street, probably to meet friends.\n I shiver under my tiny plastic umbrella, pacing back and forth through the puddles. I\u2019d forgotten it\u2019s Adult\u2019s Day, the celebration for twenty-year-olds\u2014I can\u2019t avoid seeing the shining stars of the holiday. Young women walk choko-choko in fancy geta onto the gravel path toward Meiji Shrine. Twenty-year-old perfection cocooned in layers of bright kimono and white fur shoulder-wraps. They glimmer against the dark gray street and the green trees. Admiring family members hover around them, carrying umbrellas to protect them from the rain.\n They can scarcely walk in those heavy kimonos. They\u2019re not shivering, though. They\u2019ve made it through. They\u2019ll walk beneath the torii gate into the shrine, make their offerings, and be blessed. Everything falls toward them\u2014young men, good fortune, even gravity. They\u2019re so bright I can hardly bear to look, and light-years away.\n I don\u2019t know why I came out here.\n I walk fast back to the station. Change clothes in the bathroom, wipe my face clean for appearances. At a vending machine, I buy a can of hot milk-tea to warm my hands, and get back on the train.\n At least I chased away the voices for a little while. But when the train pulls into my station, the pressure comes back ten times worse.\n I have to be careful now, because of Obaa-chan. My bag has to be zipped, not the least shred of crinoline showing. The better way would be not to bring it around the front at all. I walk down the station steps, duck around the raised guard rail and across the tracks, then sidestep between the ivied wall and the back of our apartment building. An ice-cold drip from the eaves strikes me right at the crest of my head.\n The voices are back.\n \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d\n \u201cNo, she\u2019s mine!\u201d\n \u201cNaoko-san, hey!\u201d\n My fingers clench. As I sidestep past our neighbors\u2019 back porch, the metallic ticking starts. There\u2019s the rustling, too, frantic this time. It sounds so real. Too real. Maybe there\u2019s a cat fight? But feral cats don\u2019t whistle my name . . .\n I peek past the piece of wall that divides their porch from ours. Things are fighting, outside our back step. A skeleton, and a bat? No, skeletons don\u2019t have lights . . .\n Crack.\n The whistle rises in pitch like a scream, and the bat-thing falls down with the skeleton-thing standing over it.\n I jump in and kick the skeleton-thing. It breaks apart, all its pieces scattering across the ground with a sound like a bike crash. A metal bar\u2014the brake of a train? A bike pedal. A chain. A couple of disconnected gears. When I look for the bat thing, all I see is Obaa-chan\u2019s old paper umbrella from her tour of the Nakasendo Highway years ago, and a cracked teapot with a broken lid.\n \u201cIya da . . . I\u2019m fighting garbage?\u201d\n That\u2019s it\u2014I\u2019ve really lost it. I drop my bag, squat down and hide my face in my hands.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not garbage,\u201d says the whistling voice, beside my feet. \u201cI might be dusty, but I haven\u2019t been thrown away. I still matter.\u201d\n I look down. The sumi-e painting on the side of the old teapot isn\u2019t plum blossoms any more. It\u2019s a face, and the crack looks like a sly grin.\n I mutter aloud, \u201cI need to see a psychiatrist, for sure.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d whistles the voice slyly through the crack. \u201cEverything will be all right so long as you pass your college entrance exams.\u201d\n I don\u2019t scream.\n I do stand up with both hands over my mouth.\n The metal parts are pulling back together as if by magnets, and the little lights go on, blue and yellow.\n \u201cOw,\u201d says rusty trumpet. \u201cKyusu, no fair. You called her.\u201d\n \u201cYou broke me!\u201d the teapot retorts. It settles itself atop the umbrella, which tips itself up and gives a ruffle. \u201cDen is nothing but a ruffian. I\u2019m a good boy.\u201d\n \u201cTraditional,\u201d says Den, scornfully.\n \u201cGlue,\u201d I mumble. \u201cInside, we have some. Wait a minute . . . \u201d\n I slip off my shoes and step in the back door. The kitchen light is on, and Obaa-chan is cooking. I keep my mouth shut, tiptoeing past the door and into the front entry hall. Oto-san always kept glue in the slipper cabinet; it wouldn\u2019t have gotten moved when his company moved him.\n Back out to the cold. I sit on the back step beside my zori and glue the two pieces of the teapot lid back together, casting glances at Kyusu, who has developed small brown bamboo hands and is covering his head as if his life force resided there, like a kappa\u2019s.\n \u201cDo you have tea in there?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cOf course,\u201d he says, importantly. \u201cVery old tea.\u201d\n \u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d says Den, who stands by the wall with lights winking. \u201cIt\u2019s all dried out long since.\u201d\n Kyusu looks offended.\n I hand Kyusu his lid, and glance down politely at the tube of glue while he puts it on. His teapot\u2019s still full of cracks, of course\u2014but if I had to glue anyone\u2019s mouth shut, I\u2019d rather it be Den\u2019s.\n I ask, \u201cKyusu, do you need anything else? I have a rag, I could tidy you up\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIya!\u201d he cries. Then he ruffles a bit, and apologizes: \u201cShitsurei shimashita. You\u2019ve taken good care of me.\u201d\n \u201cYet you\u2019re still alive,\u201d says Den. He sounds surprised. Kyusu gives an indignant ruffle, and Den lifts his bike pedal like a threatening fist.\n I stand up. \u201cDen, leave him alone. Shall I kick you again?\u201d\n Den\u2019s lights wink out. Suddenly a light flicks on in the window above my head, and both Den and Kyusu flop down, old pieces of junk forgotten in the dirt.\n Behind me, Obaa-chan opens the door. \u201cNao-chan, what in the world are you doing out here?\u201d\n \u201cTadaima.\u201d I duck my head. \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d\n \u201cOkaeri-nasai.\u201d The way Obaa-chan says it, it\u2019s more a command than a greeting. She leaves it there in my ears and shuffles back into the house. Face burning, I carry my shoes back to their spot in the entry hall, and sneak my bag into the closet behind my folded futon. I wish I could have left it outside, but I don\u2019t trust Den.\n If he and Kyusu are there at all. But I saw them; I glued Kyusu\u2019s lid for him. And Obaa-chan\u2019s stories always made the yokai spirits seem so real . . .\n Maybe it\u2019s myself I don\u2019t trust.\n Obaa-chan is sitting in her chair at the kitchen table when I walk in, but the moment I sit down she stands up again, pouring me tea the way she used to for Oto-san, with precision and ceremony. Taking a small bowl to the rice cooker and filling it. Filling another bowl with miso soup. Bringing them to my place. Reminding me of the trouble I am to her.\n I clap my hands together. \u201cItadakimasu. Obaa-chan, I\u2019ll do the dishes.\u201d\n \u201cOf course you won\u2019t,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou\u2019ll be studying.\u201d\n Ashamed, I hide in my miso soup. It\u2019s delicious, with bits of fried tofu. Just what my frozen body needed, which only makes me feel worse.\n \u201cYou haven\u2019t been taking proper care of yourself, Naoko-san,\u201d Obaa-chan says. \u201cYour face is all dirty.\u201d\n She knows. She must; she didn\u2019t ask a single question about my bag. I pull my bangs down over my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cI spoke with your father.\u201d\n I put my chopsticks down, carefully. Pinch the edge of the table until my fingertips turn white.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be driving you to cram school, and picking you up, this week. That should help.\u201d\n It feels like a door shut in my face. I should be grateful. She\u2019s always tried to help. But I hardly feel I know her any more.\n I manage to say something. \u201cYou\u2019re taking good care of me, Grandmother.\u201d\n I pick up my chopsticks again and start eating, like a puppet.\n There\u2019s no escape.\n Day after day, kanji characters march through my head. Mathematics, English, social studies, science, Japanese language\u2014they\u2019re skeletons made of broken chopsticks and bent umbrellas, rusty scissors, a hundred kinds of junk. Their footsteps hurt, and when I try to catch them they twist and fall apart.\n Obaa-chan invited me into the formal tatami-mat room with the kotatsu, so I could tuck into the quilt under the heated table and keep warm while I worked. I declined, because I don\u2019t need Grandfather and Mother\u2019s ancestor portraits watching me on top of everyone else. Since then, the weather has dropped below freezing. Obaa-chan peeks into my room occasionally, her mending in hand, but she never asks me to change my mind.\n \u201cYou can still pass.\u201d Kyusu is peeking through my window, seemingly unaffected by the cold. \u201cIt\u2019s not much longer.\u201d\n \u201cKyusu, I\u2019m trying to study.\u201d\n I have no idea why he even cares. It was just a little glue.\n \u201cYou\u2019d rather go out. I can see why,\u201d says Den, beside him. \u201cWe know you try on the costume when no one is in the house. You\u2019ve got a new spirit, and now it\u2019s being squashed.\u201d\n \u201cBoth of you shut up, okay?\u201d\n A sad little whistle comes in reply. \u201cAll right, I understand.\u201d\n Now I feel sorry. For a teapot on an umbrella. This does not help my concentration.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d says Den.\n \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n Oto-san went to Tokyo University. I dream about getting into Kyoto, if I only could score high enough, but I\u2019ll never get there\u2014probably easier to fly to the moon.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d His electric-panel face taps against my window, lights blinking. \u201cIt\u2019s your life. Your grandmother shouldn\u2019t be watching everything you do.\u201d\n \u201cDen\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m serious. You could tell her so.\u201d\n I dig my left hand deep into my hair, and force my cramped fingers to keep writing, nicely formed characters, one in each box. Twelve hundred character essay, due tomorrow morning. And tomorrow night I\u2019m sure there will be another just like it.\n \u201cNao-chan, dinner!\u201d Obaa-chan calls.\n I can hardly set down the pencil. I shake my hand out, and blow on it, walking to the kitchen. Here, the space heater is on, but the friction in my head is so bad I\u2019d almost prefer the cold.\n I imagine myself standing on the sub-zero Jingumae bridge in my spiderweb stockings. I sit down, Obaa-chan gets up.\n \u201cI spoke to your father last night,\u201d she says, serving rice. \u201cThe weather is warmer in Nagasaki.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so.\u201d I imagine myself standing on the moon.\n \u201cHe would like to talk to you sometime.\u201d\n I have nothing to say. She never calls me to the phone. I used to talk to Oto-san, when he sat here on my right. I never minded eating late so I could talk to him. Obaa-chan talked to him, too. Now his empty chair is a crater, and she and I stand on opposite sides.\n Obaa-chan sighs. \u201cIf you told me more about your studies, I could tell him how you\u2019re doing.\u201d She sets down the rice bowl; the tiny sound of it hitting the table echoes like an asteroid impact. I answer like an alien.\n \u201cYou already know how I\u2019m doing. Don\u2019t you? You\u2019re always watching me. You don\u2019t even let me breathe.\u201d\n Obaa-chan frowns. \u201cNao-chan, these exams will decide the rest of your life. You\u2019ll just have to endure.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t stand it!\u201d I push back from the table. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to take the exams? What if I don\u2019t care?\u201d\n Her fingers clench around the rice paddle, still in her hand. \u201cYou!\u201d she snaps. \u201cYou only think about yourself\u2014you treat your father\u2019s sacrifices as if they mean nothing.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right, he\u2019s perfect, and I\u2019m nothing but a nuisance who will never be good for anything!\u201d\n \u201cNaoko-san, sit down and eat your dinner.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n I run away down the hall, all the way out the back door. I curl up on the step with my knees pressed into my eyes.\n \u201cNaoko-san?\u201d whistles Kyusu\u2019s voice. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n Den whispers, \u201cLook how powerful you are now.\u201d\n \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d\n I want to say that it was Den\u2019s fault, but I was the one who did it. I chose to speak.\n I\u2019m too tired to study and too angry to sleep.\n Again.\n Obaa-chan and I aren\u2019t speaking. I haven\u2019t eaten breakfast or dinner for two days because that would mean going into the kitchen. It would mean her serving me, reminding me as always of the filial debt that I can never repay.\n \u201cYou should say sorry,\u201d Kyusu whistles, by the window. \u201cShe still cares for you. Just say sorry.\u201d\n \u201cNo way,\u201d says Den. \u201cYou should stay strong. She should apologize to you.\u201d\n Kyusu gives a ruffle. \u201cNaoko-san, your grandmother would be glad to see you eat. So would I.\u201d\n He\u2019s stopped telling me I can pass the exams.\n I still have to pass the exams.\n I feel sick, but my stomach is empty. Probably, Obaa-chan thinks I\u2019ve been eating at school, but I\u2019ve only had a little water. I\u2019m just not hungry; my stomach feels flattened like an origami box. I tiptoe out to the back door and slip into my zori on the step. I take deep breaths, as if the icy air might fill me out to my proper shape again.\n \u201cNaoko-san?\u201d Kyusu hops over from the window, his bamboo umbrella-handle stamping small circles in the frozen dirt. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you. Please eat.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s glimpsed the possible ends,\u201d says Den, leaning against the frozen twists of ivy. His yellow light blinks once. \u201cFailure.\u201d\n \u201cDen, stop.\u201d\n His blue light blinks once. \u201cDeath.\u201d\n A shiver rises up from my feet, all the way to my head. Is that where this darkness leads? Suicide? \u201cI don\u2019t want to throw my life away,\u201d I say. \u201cI just want\u2014I don\u2019t know, a way out of this.\u201d\n \u201cTime?\u201d Kyusu suggests meekly.\n \u201cA different spirit,\u201d Den trumpets. \u201cLike wearing your costume.\u201d\n I can only sigh. \u201cI still have to pass the exams.\u201d\n \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d says Den.\n \u201cShe does, though,\u201d says Kyusu.\n Den laughs like the clatter of a chain against metal. \u201cNot if she leaves the human world, and joins us. That would be a significant change.\u201d\n For an instant I forget the cold. Leave the world? Is that possible?\n Kyusu hops backward with a ruffle. \u201cIya . . . \u201d\n His mournful whistle disturbs me. \u201cKyusu, is your life so terrible? Would you rather be in someone\u2019s kitchen serving tea, or keeping off the rain?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not that. Den is . . . \u201d He waves away his own thought with one bamboo hand. \u201cI had to be forgotten before I could have my own memories, but I mustn\u2019t be undervalued. You should know that neglect does . . . unexpected things.\u201d\n \u201cIt gives you life!\u201d Den cries.\n I hug myself. \u201cI am alive.\u201d\n Den scoffs with a grating noise. \u201cAre you more alive now, or when you wear the costume?\u201d\n I look down, worrying the ties of the house-coat Obaa-chan made for me. He knows my answer, or he wouldn\u2019t have asked.\n \u201cYour father left for Nagasaki. That\u2019s what did it.\u201d Den waves his bicycle pedal in a grand circle. \u201cNow you\u2019re realizing you have the power to do as you like with your own life. You could turn yokai, and leave behind your problems for good. Exams mean nothing to us.\u201d\n Just throw the exams away? I can hardly imagine it. I pull my house-coat tighter. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d\n A deep shudder comes from the rails behind the wall. The flash of a headlight breaks the darkness, and the first train of the morning shrieks by.\n Den says, \u201cCome to Harajuku.\u201d\n No matter how many times I\u2019ve come out to the Jingumae bridge, I never expected to follow the Adult\u2019s Day girls so soon\u2014and not like this. Above my head, the giant torii gate of Meiji Shrine looks almost painted, heavy ink-black lines against the dawning sky. It stands like a dark border between my past and future.\n Den and Kyusu step beneath it first. Following them into the space between the trees, I shiver even in my winter coat. I try to imagine the yokai version of myself, but I see only Kitano Naoko, desperate high-schooler and cosplayer in withdrawal.\n What kind of yokai could I be? I wouldn\u2019t do well as a neck-stretching rokurokubi, or a faceless noppera-bo. All I really know how to do is Gothic-girl.\n What would a Gothic-girl yokai look like? Longer hair? Paler face? Would I feel cold? Hunger? Would I have silent footsteps?\n Den and Kyusu don\u2019t. Den\u2019s gears rattle and scuff through the gravel; Kyusu hops with little crunching sounds, rather like the lamp in the Miyazaki movie. I\u2019m still surprised they made it here so easily; early commuters on the Yamanote line seemed too rushed to do more than raise an eyebrow at a pile of abandoned objects in the corner by my seat. We\u2019ve left commuters behind, though; here on the path between the trees, there is no one.\n Soon the inner torii gate comes into view. Beyond it, the heavy wooden doors to the courtyard stand open. Kyusu stops abruptly before the high gate-sill, spreading his bamboo-and-paper skirts.\n \u201cNaoko-san, don\u2019t do this,\u201d he whistles. \u201cYour grandmother will have found you gone by now. She\u2019ll be frantic, asking the neighborhood police if they\u2019ve seen you.\u201d\n Obaa-chan frantic . . . I hug myself, and shiver deeper into my coat. \u201cWhat other choice do I have?\u201d\n Den straightens himself up, walking forward. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop her, Kyusu.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you can\u2019t make her. She doesn\u2019t even like you.\u201d\n \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s mine anyway.\u201d\n \u201cNo, she\u2019s not.\u201d\n \u201cWell, she\u2019s certainly not yours.\u201d\n \u201cQuiet down, both of you,\u201d I say. \u201cI belong to myself. Den, you said yourself, it\u2019s my life.\u201d\n Den\u2019s electric-panel face swivels around to me. \u201cTruly? Then why are you here?\u201d\n I bite my lips shut.\n \u201cNaoko-san,\u201d says Kyusu, \u201cwe can still go home . . . \u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Den raises his bike pedal threateningly. \u201cTeapot-boy, give her to me or this time I\u2019ll break your face.\u201d\n I cry out, \u201cDen, don\u2019t!\u201d\n But Kyusu drops his skirts with a whistling sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll stay behind.\u201d\n Den hops and rattles over the wooden sill into the main shrine courtyard. I step over too, but with Kyusu gone it feels different. I don\u2019t like Den talking like he owns me. My stomach starts to cramp. I wish I could see the priests, but no one is in sight. Even the fortune-telling windows are still closed. At the stone steps I approach the offering bin and clap my hands to invoke the attention of the kami.\n \u201cStop that,\u201d says Den.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you appreciate it?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not for me. And with what you\u2019re doing, we want as little attention as possible.\u201d\n That sounds bad. \u201cDen, what am I doing?\u201d\n Den\u2019s yellow light winks at me. \u201cIf you want to cross over to our world, you\u2019ll need to eat the offerings.\u201d\n My stomach squirms. The New Year\u2019s offerings of mochi and oranges will still be arrayed before the altars. To eat them\u2014the awful thought makes my hair stand on end. A sudden pain bites the back of my head, so sharp I clasp my hands over it.\n \u201cI can\u2019t. Den, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. Of course you can. You\u2019re just hungry enough, and soon your new spirit will do it for you.\u201d Both his lights are glowing now, as if in satisfaction. \u201cI told that teapot you were mine. Now he\u2019s just garbage. I matter.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you saying? Kyusu matters.\u201d The back of my head hurts so much it feels like it\u2019s going to split open. I should never have come here. I should have realized, when Kyusu tried to stop us. I should never have let him stay behind . . .\n I turn away and run back across the broad courtyard. At the gate, I call out.\n \u201cKyusu? Are you still here?\u201d\n The dawn stillness is broken only by the trickle of water in the purifying basin.\n Then comes a soft whistle. \u201cNaoko-san?\u201d\n Yokatta! Relieved, I follow his voice to a spot behind the basin. He cringes when he sees me.\n \u201cNaoko-san, are you all right?\u201d\n \u201cMy head is hurting. I\u2019m so sorry. I should have listened to you. Den talks like he never cared about me at all, only about himself.\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d Kyusu sighs. He bows his teapot head so deeply he has to hold his lid on with both hands. \u201cNeither of us did, at first. We only wanted to change you, to prove we still mattered, that we couldn\u2019t just be thrown away. I\u2019m afraid I have no excuse.\u201d\n My stomach cramps again. \u201cThat was what you both wanted, from the very beginning? To turn me yokai?\u201d\n He shakes one small hand before his face. \u201cNo, no, that was never my thought. Den had that plan, I suppose, but I only learned it today. Since you hadn\u2019t been eating, there was only one obvious possibility.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cThis.\u201d He reaches up for a dipper of water from the purifying basin and pours it into his spout. Then, bowing his head toward me, he removes his lid.\n The tea gives off a musty scent, like rain on old leaves. I\u2019m embarrassed to look at something so private, but once I do I can\u2019t stop staring. The purifying water glows with its own light, and the floating leaves flicker and change into the vision of a woman. She is deathly thin, with a starved expression, and two tentacular braids that undulate all on their own, revealing a gaping horror at the back of her head: a mouth full of sharp teeth.\n Futakuchi onna.\n \u201cNo. No. That\u2019s not me!\u201d But there\u2019s still the pain at the back of my head\u2014and I had that feeling that my hair was standing up . . . Iya! I hold my head tightly with both hands.\n Kyusu claps his lid back on. \u201cYou\u2019re still in danger. You have to eat something normal, quickly.\u201d\n I search my pockets. Nothing. \u201cI could buy something at the station\u2014\u201d\n Then I hear Den\u2019s voice calling. If he\u2019s come looking for me, that can\u2019t be good.\n \u201cNaoko-san, are you hungry? I\u2019ve brought you an orange . . . \u201d\n Agony bites my head again. I scoop up Kyusu, and run. Den isn\u2019t a fast mover, but it\u2019s a long way back along the pathway through the trees, and I\u2019m dizzy with pain and hunger.\n \u201cJust don\u2019t stop,\u201d whistles Kyusu.\n At last we pass under the great torii gate and cross the street onto the bridge. There are people here, real people. I stumble through them to the station, and buy myself a train ticket. Once inside, I hurry to the vending machine and buy myself a hot milk-tea.\n I have never tasted anything so delicious. As I cradle its warmth in my free hand against my face, the pain in my head slowly subsides. Kyusu stays tucked tightly under my arm, making no complaint as we board the train.\n We reach our station with no sign of Den. It seems almost normal to walk down the station steps, around the guard rail and across the tracks. I duck in behind the ivied wall and sidestep to my back porch. Once there, I set Kyusu down.\n \u201cKyusu, are you all right?\u201d\n He\u2019s silent for a long moment. At last, he ruffles hesitantly. \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t sound sure.\u201d\n Kyusu pats his porcelain face with his bamboo hands, sumi-e eyes blinking. \u201cJust\u2014I\u2019m surprised. You carried me, and I\u2019m still alive.\u201d\n \u201cBy good fortune, we both are. It\u2019s rude, but may I go inside and get something to eat?\u201d\n \u201cPlease do, before Den finds you.\u201d\n I brace for Obaa-chan, and dare a quiet, \u201cTadaima . . . \u201d\n The apartment is silent. Even the kitchen is empty. Where could she be? The rice cooker light is on, so I wash my hands and open it. The rush of delicious steam makes me want to swoon. I take up a ball of rice with the paddle and shape it into a triangle between my hands; it\u2019s scalding hot, but I don\u2019t care. My head is finally my own again.\n My mouth is full of hot rice when I hear Kyusu scream.\n I gulp down the mouthful and run for the back door, nearly falling when I try to get into my zori. Den stands over Kyusu, raining blows with the bike pedal that could easily shatter his head\u2014if they haven\u2019t already.\n I kick Den to pieces against the ivied wall, but all too soon, he pulls himself back together.\n I step between him and Kyusu. \u201cLeave him alone.\u201d\n Den\u2019s trumpeting voice is wild and furious. \u201cGo ahead, kick me. Kick me all you like, but you\u2019ll never get rid of me. I\u2019m not so easily thrown away.\u201d\n Behind him, Kyusu gets up slowly. His head seems whole; he pats himself carefully with his small brown hands. I\u2019ve seen him in pain, seen him broken, but he\u2019s never seemed afraid of death\u2014except when I\u2019ve cared for him.\n I know what I have to do.\n I crack open the apartment door and grab a clean rag from the laundry basket. Then I go for Den. He\u2019s expecting a kick, but I catch him by a loop of his chain and start rubbing.\n Now he\u2019s the one who squirms and screams. Hits, too, but I won\u2019t let go. Whoever abandoned him left him covered with old oil and dirt that stains the rag. His brake handle is far easier, just a thin film of dust, and easy to wipe away. When I reach his electric panel his screams turn to whimpers, and finally fade away. I give each of his gears a good scrubbing, just to be sure.\n Kyusu is watching me with both hands held over his mouth.\n I drop the rag in the dirt, and extend a hand toward him. \u201cKyusu. I\u2019d never do such a thing to you, I promise. You matter to me.\u201d\n He twists his umbrella-foot in the dirt almost shyly. \u201cPerhaps, if we are careful, we could care for each other without crushing each other\u2019s spirits?\u201d Then he grimaces. \u201cI\u2019m still sorry I couldn\u2019t help you pass your entrance exams.\u201d\n The exams. For the first time, the thought fails to bring its usual panic.\n \u201cKyusu, excuse me a moment,\u201d I say. \u201cI need to find my grandmother.\u201d\n I carry my shoes, thinking to go straight out through the front entryway and ask after her with the neighborhood police, but passing the kitchen door, I glimpse her in the corner of my eye.\n Obaa-chan, alone at the kitchen table. Not cooking. Not mending. Silent, lonely, her eyes downcast.\n I don\u2019t know how to go in there. I leave my shoes and coat in the entryway and smooth my hair, so she won\u2019t scold me for little nothings when I\u2019ve barely escaped throwing away my human self. If I sit down, she\u2019ll get up, and it will be too late. This time has to be different.\n I walk in, straight to the electric kettle.\n \u201cObaa-chan, can I get you some tea?\u201d\n I hear her shaking gasp, but focus on taking down a pair of cups and the small iron teapot\u2014the replacement for our hand-painted porcelain one that cracked. The careful routine: shaking in tea, pouring in hot water, placing the cups and teapot on a laquered tray. At last she answers.\n \u201cNao-chan\u2014yes, please.\u201d\n My hands shake, setting the tray down in front of Oto-san\u2019s place. I place one cup for her, one for me, and sit down.\n Obaa-chan doesn\u2019t get up. The clock ticks on the wall, beside our kitchen shrine.\n I reach for my cup, trying to find something to say.\n \u201cObaa-chan, I\u2019m sorry. I know I\u2019m late for school.\u201d\n After several silent seconds, she murmurs, \u201cYou\u2019re safe . . . \u201d\n Did she know the danger I was in? How could she know? But somehow it makes words easier.\n \u201cObaa-chan, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m trying to study hard, but I\u2019m not Oto-san. I think I\u2019m going to fail, and the harder I try, the harder . . . it\u2019s terrible, inside my head. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n She nods. Picks up her teacup in both hands, and sips. \u201cYou\u2019re just like me.\u201d\n Like her? I blink at my tea, and take a sip to cover my confusion.\n \u201cLife is long,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you fail, even if you become ronin, you can try again.\u201d\n \u201cOto-san\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHe will return one day. He will want you to be here.\u201d\n I sneak a glance at her face. Deep behind her sad eyes, I can hear words she doesn\u2019t say. Life is long, if you don\u2019t throw it away. What happened to her? Maybe one day she will trust me enough to tell me.\n \u201cI understand.\u201d I take a sip of tea, and swallow. \u201cI should probably get ready for school.\u201d\n She nods. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you today.\u201d\n \u201cYes, please.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m here waiting whenever you are ready.\u201d\n \u201cHai.\u201d\n I run back to my room, but before I pick up my backpack, I open the sliding door of the futon closet. I open my bag and spread my costume out on the floor, feeling the tickle of crinoline on my palms.\n I\u2019m not going to throw it away\u2014and now I know what it\u2019s missing.\n I can wrap the bicycle chain around the waistline, and sew the gears into the skirt. The electric panel lights would look good if I stitched them to one shoulder. And the exams will end before winter does, so I\u2019ll need a better umbrella.\n I\u2019ll ask Kyusu if he\u2019d like to come with me.\n Juliette Wade combined a trip to the Gouffre de Padirac with her academic background in linguistics and anthropology to create the world of Varin, a grand experiment in speculative ethnography.

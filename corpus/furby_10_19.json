Stomp over to Matron sat on her throne and ask where Tommy is. Tommy\u2019s dead, she says. Passed away in his sleep in the early hours. Terrible sorry.\nShe don\u2019t sound all that sorry. The mech whines as I hop over to my spot at the chessboard. Needs a service. Oil\u2019s dry and joints crunch rust. One sheered bolt away from fallin\u2019 apart. Just like us derelicts. Outside the wind moves a squad of dry, crusty leaves round the yard. Storm\u2019s howlin\u2019 orders like a CO sweatin\u2019 out last night\u2019s drunk. My tinnitus starts playin\u2019 up again, like distant laser-fire. Slap my ear a few times like that\u2019ll help. Probably just look nuts. Ear defenders weren\u2019t top of the QMC\u2019s priorities back in the day. More concerned with guns and ammo I guess. Annoyin\u2019 as hell though. The ringin\u2019 and ringin\u2019 and ringin\u2019.\nI fiddle with the queen and stare at my reflection in a cracked windowpane. When\u2019d we get so goddamn gray? Deep crags crisscross my face like those dusty red canyons we used to fight in. Which ones are scars, which ones wrinkles? I can\u2019t tell anymore. Can\u2019t remember. There\u2019s bags under my eyes like I\u2019ve been on an all nighter with the rookies. Silver stubble scattered across saggin\u2019 cheeks. Liver spots showin\u2019 through thin wisps of hair. FUBAR. What happened to us? Well shit, guess we got old.\nTommy was one of the good ones. Ninth Battalion. Best of the best. We went way back, him and me. All the way to the beginnin\u2019 I guess. Had the misfortune to be drinkin\u2019 in the same dive bar in Brooklyn when the scrips came. Bagged and tagged us, threw us on a dropship, straight to boot camp in Boston. I was just a mechanic. Tommy was a gambler. His pa was somethin\u2019 big in DC. Shouted that a lot on the ride over. Didn\u2019t matter. Sarge put us both on our asses when we tried to leave. Conscription Act says you\u2019re in the marines now kids. Get used to it. Only way you\u2019re leavin\u2019 is in a squad or a body bag. Makes me laugh now. Squad or a body bag. What a joker.\nOur first mission was down south, Louisiana. Screevs had a hive in New Orleans. City\u2019d been dead since the start of the war. It was a meat grinder. Total Charlie Foxtrot. Crawlin\u2019 with the slimy bastards. You could see \u2019em from the dropship. Squirmin\u2019 skitterin\u2019 writhin\u2019 mass. Like the ruins were alive. CO told us to take it back. Nothin\u2019 else. Just take it back. The whole city, from the alien scourge. Ten kids greener than grass, barely knew one end of a rifle from the other. All newly strapped into these prototype armor suits. The original mech model, the ones that didn\u2019t work quite right. Before they realized you had to weld the steel to bone and wire the computers in under the skin.\nIt was a Hail Mary strike. Command knew we were losin\u2019 the war. They were desperate. Fate of humanity in their hands. We were just a gamble. Ten chips on double zero. Didn\u2019t figure that out \u2019til later though. Remember jumpin\u2019 out the \u2019copter deep behind enemy lines. Shakin\u2019 so hard we rattled. Sure we were goin\u2019 to win the war. There was this weird quiet moment hunkered down in an abandoned mall, rifles pointed at the exits, waitin\u2019 for the bugs. We could hear \u2019em. The skitterin\u2019 in the distance, gettin\u2019 closer, louder. We all looked at each other and knew we were done. Then one of the boys, Red, said he needed a crap. The brains hadn\u2019t figured that into the design. Guess I\u2019m fightin\u2019 with full pants, he said. We all laughed. F.t.a. was the last thing Red ever said. F.t.a.\nBy the time me and Tommy got outta the Big Easy, we needed new suits and one helluva bath. Shook up as hell, missin\u2019 one or two limbs and more than a few friends. We failed our mission, but we took a slice out of the Screevs. Managed to blow the Waterford plant on the way out. Top brass weren\u2019t exactly happy that we nuked half the state, but it did the job.\nI barely listened to the debrief. All I could hear was Red sayin\u2019 F.t.a. over and again. I wanted a burger. I wanted to sleep for a week. I never wanted to fight again. And Tommy, well, Tommy was the only mad kid still smilin\u2019.\nHe always smiled. Even when the CO whipped him for drinkin\u2019 on duty. Even when we were mustered out halfway through trainin\u2019 in second year. Even when we stood on that frontline, starin\u2019 down the throats of those crimson Screever caves, thinkin\u2019 just maybe we were cannon fodder for bugs. Yeah, we went way back. Battle of Thursday Mine. Sackin\u2019 of the Breeding Pits. The Final Battle. Tommy was a legend. Good chess player too. He smiled through every injury, every death, every bit of pain.\nI asked him once, I said Tommy, how come you\u2019re always smilin\u2019. Kid just shrugged, smiled and said he liked to show the world his best face. Maybe one day, he said, the world\u2019ll show me hers.\nI miss him. I miss my friend.\nRust flakes off my bracer as I rub at it. Dust under fingertips. Reminds me of the mines. Grit got everywhere. Stained skin rust red. Blinded some. Woke up with your mouth so dry even lickin\u2019 cave water seemed mighty fine. When we finally climbed out of hell some rookie at the front thought we were hostiles, shot us down. We\u2019re good, but we ain\u2019t invincible. Bullet pinged off Tommy\u2019s mech and punched out the back of Critter\u2019s skull. Poor Critter. Survived the Screevs and ate lead off some fresh meat\u2019s itchy trigger finger. No KIA on his record. Just friendly fire. What a way to go.\nCourse we made sure that rookie never worked again: me, Tommy, and Earl. No one gets away with killin\u2019 a marine. Got the guy drunk one night, took him round the back of the mess hall, broke both arms and legs.\nEarl\u2019s lights out in front of the TV this mornin\u2019. Little bubble of drool blowin\u2019 in one corner of his mouth. It\u2019s ten thirty: first drugs of the day then. He hits the dope hard most days now. Saw things down in the deep he couldn\u2019t unsee. Me too I guess, but some people get stuck on the\u2014bloodsplatterfleshgrindcacklingredeyes\u2014gory details. Poor Earl. Always talkin\u2019 bout his missus on the long treks down tunnel into dark. He used to stroke his rifle like it was her, whisper sweet nothings to it, kiss it when we weren\u2019t lookin\u2019.\nYeah, in retrospect we should\u2019ve known he was cracked.\nHis old lady dumped him here ten years ago. The Scrapyard: halfway between retirement home and weapons depot. Took the rest of us a little while to catch up, but we all ended up here eventually. Heroes of the Dawn. Best of the best, pride of the world, the tank soldiers. Superhumans, pumped full of the finest steroids and gene therapy money could buy and fused to ten tons of military exoskeleton. And look at us now.\nI remember the suits sayin\u2019 it was the only way to beat the Screevs. They had better reflexes than us, stronger bodies, carapace armor. They were better, faster, stronger, and they were winnin\u2019 the war. It was a necessity, they said. And we didn\u2019t argue. We were good soldiers. Good weapons. So we held still as they slid the needles in. Grinned red teeth at the bone saws and wires as they carved into us. Screamed our anger as they took us apart and put us back together.\nAnd when the docs were done, we got back in the saddle and we killed Screevs. From one end of the States to the other. We scoured the invadin\u2019 burrowin\u2019 bastards from our cities, then we followed \u2019em down the holes they made in our Earth.\nGloria hops out onto the lawn, scatterin\u2019 seed across the grass. A few o\u2019 those damned black birds skitter down from the spider trees to peck at it. They sound like Screevs to me. Shadows lurk beneath the branches but I ignore \u2019em. Now\u2019s not the time for that. Gloria flips her hair over one shoulder. Rub at my jaw to hide the smile. Our own Snow White. Giant of a woman, raven mane hidin\u2019 that empty eye socket, clawscars down her face, hoppin\u2019 round on that one leg her mech\u2019s still got. Birds like her: land on her armor, all cawin\u2019 for the grain in her hand. Smiles that crooked broken smile of hers and scatters the rest to the lawn. They take flight. She sings their song, flappin\u2019 her huge metal arms. Pistons hiss with the wind. A ripped wire flails around behind her wildly. Still beautiful, even with white streaks through the black. Shame she always batted for the other team.\nGloria wasn\u2019t our squadron. She was recon. The advance team sent down to map the Screevs\u2019 tunnels and bring back intelligence for the final assault. Went down with a team of five. Only one to make it back, minus the leg and eye. Said it was a cheap price for the maps. Can\u2019t help but agree. She won us the war. Day after she made it back, crawlin\u2019 out of a sewer down near Manhattan, my squad was one of hundreds they mustered out. Thousands of mechs all down the rabbit hole in one coordinated attack to finally burn the Screevs out. We cauterized the putrid wound the aliens made in our Earth and pissed in the smokin\u2019 hole that was left.\nThere are no more Screevs.\nAnd just like that, the threat was gone. World was at peace. We won. And now we\u2019re old. And unneeded. And the government won\u2019t pay to fix the mechs anymore. So they put us here, where the only damage we can do is to ourselves. I\u2019m too damn old to be angry \u2019bout it anymore. I\u2019m just disappointed.\nDave\u2019s doin\u2019 pull-ups in the corner. Sounds like someone droppin\u2019 a shippin\u2019 container on a small dog over and over again. He grumbles gravel under boots down the long dark tunnel as he counts. Pretty sure he\u2019s lyin\u2019 \u2019bout the number. Even with the mech I can only hit fifty these days, and that\u2019s with more than my fair share of arthritic pain. We\u2019re the Hellraisers. Heroes of Earth. Defenders of Humanity. Scourge of the Screevs. We won the Deep Wars. Saved the world. But we\u2019re still old. Still dyin\u2019, decayin\u2019. Just doin\u2019 it quietly under steel armor, pistons, and wires. Everythin\u2019 hurts, all the time. Where they melded bone and steel, flesh cankers and rots, rejectin\u2019 implants. Arthritis spiders over joints tired from holdin\u2019 up more weight than they were designed to. Electrics have glitched and sparked, makin\u2019 us twitch and shiver. Enhanced optics are still good I guess\u2014they straight replaced the pupils on most of us, so at least we don\u2019t have to worry about cataracts. Silver linin\u2019 to every cloud and all.\nNaw, ain\u2019t my body that\u2019s the problem. Somethin\u2019 skitters at the corner of my vision. Screev. Sure it was. I glance round slowly. Don\u2019t wanna spook it. Earl watches me. Only shadows in the corner and a flicker of television light. I shake my head. Problem is, I\u2019m reckonin\u2019 Earl ain\u2019t the only one losin\u2019 it. He grins and bobs his head like he knows what I\u2019m thinkin\u2019. I give him the finger. He slowly, shakily, gives it back.\nLast night was real bad. Docs had to restrain me again. Nightmares. We all have \u2019em. PTSD ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 to be shamed \u2019bout. We\u2019re all vets here, and all vets dream about the dark. Deep Wars were bad. Made schleppin\u2019 through the trenches in the old World Wars look like Hanukkah. Eatin\u2019, sleepin\u2019, shittin\u2019 in the dark, never sure when the Screevs were gonna burrow up from under you. Twisted little monsters bent on eatin\u2019 your eyeballs poppin\u2019 up round every corner, all teeth and spikes and crimson glowin\u2019 eyes. Naw, PTSD ain\u2019t a problem on its own. But a human tank with PTSD havin\u2019 a nightmare so real they want to kill it . . . Well now, that\u2019s a problem.\nI must\u2019ve been here three days before the brains figured to build reinforced steel cages round the beds with magnetic clamps for wrists and ankles. Works most nights. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Last night was one of those nights. I broke one arm free and splashed one of the orderlies. Kevin. Nice guy, sympathetic-like, always treated us with respect. He had a kid, showed me a holo. Jenny, he said. My angel. Was probably tryin\u2019 to wake me. There\u2019s a red stain on my wall where I introduced it to his face. Woke up with his neck in my hand. Terrible sorry.\nOther side of the Scrapyard one of the fancy doctor types is pacin\u2019 up and down. He\u2019s on the phone. Looks real mad. Probably callin\u2019 Command. Probably suggestin\u2019, forcefully, that I\u2019m decommissioned. Too dangerous, they\u2019ll say. Alzheimer\u2019s, they\u2019ll say. Only a matter of time, they\u2019ll say. Hope my boy\u2019s still got the spine to stand up to \u2019em. Even if he hasn\u2019t, I still got friends in high places. Still some got a bit of gratitude in \u2019em for all we did back in the day. I\u2019m not done yet. No sir.\nBut I am kinda sleepy. Mech sounds like coverin\u2019 fire as I heave my ancient ass out of the chair. Pops and crackles and the occasional minor explosion. Hopefully nothin\u2019 vital. I shuffle on over to the comfy chairs\u2014gel couches specially designed to take our weight. Sink into one with a groan and lean back. The footrest rises with a hydraulic hiss. Remember sittin\u2019 in that tunnel just before the final push, hunkered down back-to-back with Tommy cleanin\u2019 rifles. Remember swearin\u2019 blind that if we won the war we\u2019d get ourselves one of these goddamn chairs. Remember sayin\u2019 all the death and dyin\u2019 might be worth it for a decent night\u2019s kip.\nThey ain\u2019t all that . . .\nHisses in the dark.\nDamn nice to wake up and not have a corpse in your hand. Even if you\u2019re covered in sweat-slick steel and shakin\u2019 bolts. You never thought about it down in the dark, not bein\u2019 able to feel your own skin. It was a good thing. Wounds didn\u2019t hurt anymore. No goin\u2019 into shock for these marines. But over the years it\u2019s bugged me more and more. There\u2019s only one patch of skin, round my eyes, that still feels anythin\u2019. I stroke it now, for comfort.\nI glance out the window. There\u2019s things movin\u2019 under those trees again. Things I almost recognize from the worst days of the war. Stealth units, vat grown down in the darkest pits. Ninjas, we called \u2019em. A kind of Screev: black skin, black eyes, black claws. Silent, fluid, and completely fuckin\u2019 invisible. You had to know where to look for \u2019em, what they smelled like, and even then they usually got you. Lucky there weren\u2019t many. Phosphorus grenades. That was the thing. Wonder whether I\u2019ve got any left in the old stash.\n\u201cDad?\u201d\nOh shit. Alec. They called Alec.\n\u201cSonny boy!\u201d I tap the button that raises the chair back up. It fizzles. Damned thing. Try to sit up on my own but the mech\u2019s frozen on one side and my abs . . . Well, show me any ninety year old with abs. Even gene therapy and steroids only goes so far. Try again, swear, try again. Finally, flappin\u2019 around like some kinda overturned bug, I rock to my feet. Alec stood, suited and booted, watchin\u2019 me cough and splutter and heave as I lean on my knees.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I snap. \u201cNever seen an old man before, dickhead?\u201d\nAlec just crosses his arms. Rookie doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s born. World\u2019s been at peace since before he was just a twinkle in my eye. Screevs are only a story to him. Used to love my stories. Used to think I was a hero. Now he\u2019s a suit in a world that\u2019s moved on. Somethin\u2019 big in corporate. And I\u2019m a daily goddamn embarrassment to him.\nPublic opinion\u2019s a bitch. Once we were the saviors of Earth from the alien scourge. Now we\u2019re war criminals, mass murderers, abominations. Protesters surround the Scrapyard holdin\u2019 cute little white placards sayin\u2019 \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d \u201cScreevs are friends,\u201d and \u201cDeath to mechs.\u201d I asked the docs for some live ammo so we could take potshots at \u2019em. They didn\u2019t seem mighty amused by the concept. My shoulder aches where an alien chewed chunks out of it back in the \u201902. Ungrateful bastards, all of \u2019em. Most of \u2019em never seen a bug. Wish I could introduce \u2019em to one. They\u2019d change their tune quick enough.\nThere\u2019s a glint in Alec\u2019s eye I know too well. I love him, but he\u2019s no marine. Not even close. Boy doesn\u2019t understand and he\u2019s too caught up in his stocks and swimmin\u2019 pools to try. Been years since we were close. He always had my back as a kid. I was his hero father. That was real nice. But then a little less and a little less as the wave of public opinion turned. And now . . . Now I guess he\u2019s here to decommission me.\n\u201cYou killed a man.\u201d\nI sigh and the sigh turns into a hackin\u2019 cough that says this old bucket of bolts spent too many years down a mine filled with toxic dust and chemical weapons. Rust taste of blood on my lips. Maybe a tumor\u2019ll take me down before the docs can. That there might be the definition of irony. When I can breathe again I grin red teeth at Alec.\n\u201cI\u2019ve killed lots of men, kid. Perks of the job.\u201d\nAlec\u2019s chin wobbles. He probably thinks that twist of his lips is a casual sneer. To me he just looks like a ten year old scared to box with his old man cause he doesn\u2019t want a punch on the jaw. I\u2019m disappointed in my son. I examine that for a moment. Yes. I\u2019m disappointed in him. What I could do if I was his age again, with everythin\u2019 he\u2019s got. Goddamn, guess the old are always jealous of the young. Alex shifts his weight and a lifetime of close scrapes makes me tense under my metal shell.\n\u201cDad. You\u2019re not well.\u201d Tryin\u2019 a different tack then. SSDD. We\u2019ve had this conversation a few times over the years. Most of the mechs took voluntary decommissionin\u2019 years ago, or were forced to when their rigs got real bad. Heroes who saved a planet, put down like dogs gone rabid. I will not go quietly into the night. \u2019Sides\u2014my eyes flick to the side, out the window, under the trees where the ninjas lurk\u2014I reckon they\u2019ll need me again soon enough.\n\u201cCan it, bolo. I\u2019m fine. See that?\u201d I point over at Earl. \u201cThat\u2019s not fuckin\u2019 well. Don\u2019t see anyone DCin\u2019 him, do ya?\u201d I take a step forward and he flinches. He flinches. Stop like that flinch was a ten-ton tank and there\u2019s ammo comin\u2019 down the barrel.\nHe\u2019s scared of me.\nDamn.\nWhat would Dela think? Nothin\u2019 good. I can almost see her lookin\u2019 up at me with those doe eyes and sad mouth. How the hell did we come to this?\nSlowly, palms out so the gray flesh shows not the steel knuckles, I reach out.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, kid. You\u2019re right. Maybe I am gettin\u2019 old.\u201d He lets me lay a hand soft-like on his shoulder, but he doesn\u2019t meet my eye. Somethin\u2019 flickers out in the dark again but I ignore it. Now\u2019s not the time to puzzle out reality from dead neurons . . .\n\u201cHow \u2019bout I see that shrink you\u2019ve been bangin\u2019 on about?\u201d An olive branch. Please let him take it.\nAlec glances over his shoulder at the Doc, who slowly shakes his head. Y\u2019know that hurts more than ever. Thought I dragged him up right, even after his ma passed. Thought he was strong enough to make his own decisions, to back his family over all else. Seems I thought wrong.\n\u201cToo late for that, da.\u201d Alec steps back. \u201cYou\u2019re not safe anymore.\u201d He frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d he repeats, and turns to walk away. I\u2019m already dead to him, then. Guess it ain\u2019t so different from me and my pa. I\u2019d done my ten, got my papers. Could\u2019ve discharged honorably. But they offered me the new mech. A chance to fight the last fight. I signed up for the next tour. Left him alone and wasn\u2019t there when the Screevs burrowed right up under him. He was old, weak, a nuisance, and a distraction. Remember lookin\u2019 over my shoulder as I walked up into the transport. Little old man with dandelion hair flappin\u2019 in the wind and cane clenched in both hands. He was so proud of me. Never complained. Never killed anyone in his sleep . . . Remember the CO givin\u2019 us the news. New York sinkholed. Nothin\u2019 left. No survivors. I should\u2019ve been there.\nGuess we all kill our dads in the end.\nI go away for a while. It\u2019s been happenin\u2019 a bit lately. Any time things get too much. A skip in time, like someone cut the footage. Then you\u2019re back and people have moved or the light\u2019s changed. I was worried about it at first, but you get used to it.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d I ask. Alec doesn\u2019t answer cause he\u2019s long gone but the Doc does.\n\u201cTomorrow morning, seven-thirty.\u201d\nI nod, turn, glance at the clock.\n18 hours then. 18 hours to figure out if I\u2019m really mad, dyin\u2019, startin\u2019 that long slow slide into not bein\u2019 me anymore. Or 18 hours to prove that war\u2019s comin\u2019. Again.\nI stomp out to the garden. It\u2019s gettin\u2019 darker. Clouds comin\u2019 in. Trees thrashin\u2019 in the wind. Storm\u2019s comin\u2019. Would\u2019ve been nice to see one more sunset. Life doesn\u2019t always work out that way though. Wish I could say goodbye to Alec. Maybe he\u2019ll be there tomorrow. Doubt it though. Things I should\u2019ve said. Things I should\u2019ve done. No time now. Guess this old man\u2019ll just have to live with his regrets. For a little while longer at least.\nTime to get to work. Optics boot up a little glitchy, dead pixels skitterin\u2019 cross my eyes, but the HUD still just about works. It\u2019s been a while. Tracking roams through the trees, searchin\u2019 out any sign of life. It snags a few things\u2014rodents mostly\u2014nothin\u2019 useful. Tech never was much good against ninjas. Cold blood. Radiation resistant skin. Some sort of pigment that reflects the light, like a goddamn chameleon. I stare into the shadows like the little bastards are just gonna jump out and tap dance for me. I am not losin\u2019 it. I know I\u2019m not. Know it deep down like I know my own name. I still know my own name. One of the orderlies yells down that dinner\u2019s ready. I ignore him. Don\u2019t eat much these days. And I ain\u2019t got time for indigestion today. I\u2019ve got to find \u2019em. These Screevs I\u2019ve been seein\u2019. I\u2019ve got to prove they\u2019re real. That the world still needs me to save it.\nUnless it\u2019s all a hallucination. Maybe I\u2019m relivin\u2019 the glory days. Maybe this is the top of that long slope down into the dark and there ain\u2019t no comin\u2019 back. Jesus, what a mindfuck.\nBut what then? Sit here, quiverin\u2019, \u2019til they DC me in the mornin\u2019. Could try tellin\u2019 the docs. Could try callin\u2019 a few old friends who still work for the Pentagon. Could end my days as a cracked old man shoutin\u2019 conspiracy theories while they all laugh.\nAlec\u2019s right. It\u2019s probably all in my head. I\u2019m done. Should just go quietly, get ready for the docs to pull the plug. Top minds in the business spent the whole war searchin\u2019 for the ninjas; they never managed it. Too much noise down in the tunnels, they said. Made \u2019em pretty much invisible to all sensors, and satellites were no use . . .\nBut we\u2019re not down in the tunnels, are we. There\u2019s no background rads and thick layers of mineral obscurin\u2019 line of sight. And satellites . . . Well shit, maybe this old dog\u2019s still got a few tricks left up his rusty steel sleeves. I open up my HIVE connection. Been a while, but I still got a few insurance policies littered round the \u2019net. Back doors no one ever closed. Retro channels that the babies in the Pentagon probably never even knew existed. Takes me all of ten minutes to hack into the Space Agency\u2019s satellite network and reposition three of \u2019em over my location. Numbers scrawl behind my eyes as some clever bastard in an office somewhere in Washington starts tryin\u2019 to boot me out. I ignore \u2019em. Don\u2019t need it long. Just tune to infrared and radar, point as many eyes as possible at this area and search for . . .\nVoi-fuckin\u2019-la as the frogs say. Blackspots. I\u2019ve got blackspots. A negative result, just as good as a positive . . . Fifteen targets pop up. Holes in the forest. They don\u2019t move, like they know I\u2019m watchin\u2019 but ain\u2019t sure what to do next. They\u2019re there though. They\u2019re goddamn there.\nThe Screevs are back.\nSatellites boot me out, but the mech\u2019s got the code now. The AI knows how to track \u2019em. And if the mech can track \u2019em, they\u2019re real. If they\u2019re real, I\u2019m not cracked. And if I\u2019m not cracked, ain\u2019t no way in hell I\u2019m goin\u2019 quietly. I got unfinished business to attend to. I glance back at Gloria, still feedin\u2019 the birds. Think we all got some scores to settle.\nTo hell with Alec. To hell with the docs. To hell with my old, broken body. I wave at Gloria and sign out a debrief in the rec room in five. Durin\u2019 the war I was one of an army of supersoldiers. The first, sure, but still one in thousands. We fought the bloodiest war in history against an enemy we didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t stop. Now there\u2019s just me, Dave, Gloria. Just the three of us\u2014four if we can get Earl out of his valium coma long enough. Four old soldiers against a returnin\u2019 evil. I grin.\nIt\u2019s time to get the band back together.\nTomas Furby is a writer of odd fictions, strange stories, and weird worlds (including this one).

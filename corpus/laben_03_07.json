The best monkeys for making into mermaids, by most standards, were the suckling young\u2014their skins were pliant and they were of a size that matched well with many common fish. But my mother, in her youth, had developed a process that let her shrink the larger monkey skins\u2014even the full-grown monkeys who often died in defense of their young and whose rough pelts the hunters would part with for small coins\u2014down to an appropriate size, without drying them out too much to work with.\n Thus we had survived ten years ago when the monkeys had been exterminated from Isla Scimmia, turning the name into a cruel joke that outlanders used to taunt the inhabitants for our dark coloring and the heavy hair on our arms. More than half of the families who made mermaids then had since left the island altogether, some for Rome, some for the New World or parts still more exotic. One notable family, a husband and wife and five daughters ranging from a twenty-five-year-old spinster to a toddling child, had all drunk arsenic.\n Mother was disgusted. She\u2019d held the family in high regard before; along with her own, they\u2019d been among the few original mermaid-making families to survive when the mermaids themselves went away, to weather the early storm of competition from Fiji, to cope with the way the fish seemed to shrink every year and the fickleness of the sailors who were always looking for some new novelty. The eldest daughter had been her particular friend.\n But these days, according to Mother, everyone was a degenerate. She announced it loudly as she ducked into the workshop, shaking the rain out of her loose dark hair. \u201cDegenerates! Think they can sell me stinking half-rotten monkeys for twice, three times the usual price. They\u2019d try to sell a shell to an oyster and ask for pearls in payment.\u201d\n She held two packages\u2014by the smell of them I could tell that she\u2019d managed to find a few acceptable monkeys. She almost always did, even when Annagrazia and I came home empty-handed. I took one of the packets, wrapped in coarse oiled cloth, and untied the ends to reveal one of the small grey North African monkeys.\n \u201cYou got the good kind,\u201d Annagrazia said, unwrapping the other bundle and laying it on the table beside her knives.\n \u201cToo big,\u201d Mother said, and fished out a packet of glass eyes from the pocket of her cloak. \u201cIt will take days to shrink them properly.\u201d The shrinking process was Mother\u2019s pride and our salvation, and she hated it\u2014it was long, tedious, it produced smells that gave her headaches. To hear her talk she\u2019d as soon never do it again. But she laughed at the women who came to try to buy the secret from her.\n Annagrazia picked up her knife and tried the blade carefully against the inside of a coarse-haired leg. The lower half of the monkey would be discarded, of course, but there was no need to cut it to ribbons\u2014the fur could still be used to line boots or collars. \u201cI like these grey ones though. They look the most like real mermaids.\u201d\n \u201cLike those white-eyed idiots at the docks would know a real mermaid from a hole in the fence.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care if they know. I know.\u201d She slid the knife along the inside of the leg, skirted the groin, and split the belly. I thought for a moment that she had cut too deep and the rotting intestines would spill, but the knife glided along and left the muscles in place. \u201cWhich reminds me. Did you get brown eyes?\u201d\n \u201cBlue eyes. The sailors like blue.\u201d\n \u201cThere never was a mermaid with blue eyes,\u201d Annagrazia said, as she had so many times before.\n \u201cThere never was a mermaid that was actually half monkey and half salmon either.\u201d\n When Annagrazia finished skinning the monkey, I took the body away to clean and bone and see if any meat could be salvaged.\n Just before the storms finally broke, I noticed that Annagrazia was looking pale and sick. The quality of her work was falling off a bit too\u2014not enough that I could see it, but enough that she cursed and wept at her tools before Mother patted her hand and told her it was good enough, it would still sell.\n Annagrazia threw her needle across the workshop and ran to the kitchen.\n Three days later, Mother sent me to the apothecary for pennyroyal.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve left it too late,\u201d she was scolding when I got back.\n \u201cI haven\u2019t. I had an idea. I can make a mermaid that looks real, Mama, when you see . . . \u201d\n \u201cAnd your plan required fucking some sailor boy from the docks?\u201d\n \u201cA man from one of the island families would have been better, but it makes no nevermind. Our blood is thick. Anyway, my stupid sailor boy was able to give me some brown glass eyes.\u201d\n \u201cYou and those eyes!\u201d I thought for a moment that Mother might slap her. But Mother never slapped Annagrazia. She shook her head and snatched the pennyroyal from me and went for the kettle.\n The baby slipped out in a mess of bloody unnamable fluid, and never drew a breath before it was out of the world. Tradition called those babies the happy ones.\n \u201cLet me hold it,\u201d Annagrazia said, and I placed it in her arms. \u201cThere, look. The hair is so fine on the arms, and the eyes are brown.\u201d\n Mother smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Our blood is strong. No sailor boy in that.\u201d\n Annagrazia reached for the knife she\u2019d kept by the bedside in readiness.\n When the mermaid was finished, it was indeed perfect.\n \u201cThe spitting image of my grandmother,\u201d Mother said triumphantly. \u201cThis is the finest mermaid that has ever come out of any shop on this island since our ancestors died out. The price we can put on this\u2014we could fool a ship\u2019s doctor with it.\u201d\n \u201cWe can\u2019t sell it,\u201d Annagrazia said. \u201cIt\u2019s too perfect. This is the best thing I will ever do. I will keep it.\u201d\n Then Mother did raise her hand to slap her, but Annagrazia was holding her skinning knife and they stood staring at each other for a long time.\n \u201cI will keep this one,\u201d Annagrazia said with a smile, \u201cbut I can make more.\u201d\n Carrie Laben lives in Brooklyn with four cats, three rats, and one human. She currently writes software user manuals and other still more dire things for a living, but this is a big improvement over milking cows and selling used books to agitated mental patients. This is her first outing as a professional fiction author, but she has had several essays published in various books and periodicals that you haven't read if you haven't been to Ithaca, NY. In her spare time, she enjoys collecting books, looking at birds, and finding new and different things to eat."}

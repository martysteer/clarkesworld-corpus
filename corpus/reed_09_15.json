Several thousand human mouths and who knows how many human urges, and there were no secrets. Three seniors were pregnant, two by the same boy. There was a snobby couple who drove Cadillacs but couldn\u2019t get their checks cashed anywhere in the county. It was common knowledge that our local banker shotgunned cats for sport. And in a day when this kind of behavior mattered, my English teacher happened to have a girlfriend in the city.\nOf course the young lady never discussed sexual peculiarities. Paid to teach English, that\u2019s exactly what she did, and what made her more intriguing, at least to one fourteen-year-old boy, was that she was pretty. I also liked her name, which was Gwen, and watching her move in front of class was a small, trusted pleasure. She had a pleasant strong, but very girly voice, and I particularly liked the big glasses that seemed too much for her little nose. I didn\u2019t have a crush. Not really. But it\u2019s fifty years later, and I\u2019ll find myself thinking about the day a buddy of mine tried to do a wheelie with his desk. Got the front end up and then came the crash when the desk flipped, slamming the back of his head against the floor. Our teacher bent to help him or to punish him. I don\u2019t remember her motives. But one of the buttons had come loose on her shirt, and her padded bra pulled away at the perfect moment. That was the second or third time in my life that I ever saw a woman\u2019s breast. It\u2019s my \u201cgirl in the white dress\u201d moment. You know, that line from Citizen Kane. Half a century later, and I can\u2019t count the times that image has gotten into my head, or how many times I\u2019ve told the story to people who truly don\u2019t care.\nBut I\u2019m telling a different story now.\nThis was a different day. October in 1973, and I\u2019m sure about that because of what was happening in the world beyond. And I know it had to be Monday because our English teacher had driven back from the city the night before. She told us that much. No, girlfriends weren\u2019t mentioned, or what she might have been doing in the city. Maybe she didn\u2019t realize what everybody knew. But my class was her first class of the day, and Miss Gwen was worked up enough to describe driving on the highway last night when the sky above suddenly got bright and beautiful.\nThose were her words. \u201cBright and beautiful.\u201d\nThere weren\u2019t any storms last night, were they? She asked us that. A room of fourteen-year-old meteorologists. No, we couldn\u2019t remember lightning. But war was running wild in the Middle East. I remember that detail. People on the news and adults around town were talking about us getting swept into the big fight. Which I\u2019m guessing is why my teacher was so keyed up. Late at night, driving home in a time of war, and she saw something huge and totally unexpected.\n\u201cIt was the most beautiful blue light,\u201d she told us.\nShe did turn cagey when we fished for details. For instance, she wouldn\u2019t admit the exact time. But I can imagine the circumstances. Abandoning the love of her life, she was returning to the inbred community where she had to feel trapped. And then a mysterious light poured across the world. Was this the big missile attack? Were the Soviets going to kill us all? But the light lasted only a couple seconds, bright enough to be seen over the countryside and maybe farther. Did anybody else notice it? None of us did, no. But I wished I had. And after the light faded, the young teacher, so impressed or so rattled, had pulled onto the shoulder to watch the otherwise empty autumn sky.\nAnd here comes the oddest part of her story.\nStanding on the highway\u2019s shoulder, not a cloud in the world, and little bits of grit started falling. Started hitting her. It reminded her of sleet, except there wasn\u2019t any ice. Using a couple index cards, she managed to sweep up a sampling of her mystery, and that\u2019s what she brought out for us to observe. To interpret.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in flying saucers,\u201d she told us.\nI once saw this woman\u2019s breast and now she was telling me her disbeliefs. Kids didn\u2019t usually get that familiar with teachers.\n\u201cPretend this is science class,\u201d she said. \u201cYour eyes are probably better than mine. Pass the sack and hand lens around, okay?\u201d\nThis seemed like a wondrous day. Everybody ahead of me saw bits of sand and busted glass\u2014the kinds of crap on every road\u2019s shoulder. But I was going to do better. It was my mission. So while she was trying to teach us something useful about MacBeth, I squinted harder than I ever had in my life, and I found something new, something nobody could doubt if they took a second look.\n\u201cI see a tooth,\u201d I said.\nThat got people giggling.\n\u201cA chip of a tooth, at least,\u201d I said.\nMore laughing, and then she said, \u201cYes,\u201d and everyone went quiet. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought I was seeing too.\u201d\nI remember everything. I was watching those big glasses and the breath going in and out of her cute nose, and better than seeing any breast, those few seconds stuck in my head. Which made everything worse later.\nIn 1975, my English teacher was riding inside her girlfriend\u2019s car. They were driving fast on a different highway, and they had been drinking, according to those who knew. The car was alone when it left the road and rolled, and one door came open and a body was thrown free and then crushed.\nNothing else mattered in the world. Make all the noise you want about gossips and narrow-minded farmers, but everybody liked Miss Gwen. School was let out so that her students could attend the service in the city. And to see the famous girlfriend. Several people claimed that she was a graduate student in math or something like math, and I know I had ideas about what she would look like. But no, Gwen\u2019s lady proved to be big and plain and a little fat. Bruises and guilt didn\u2019t help her appearance either, and it was impossible to miss her, sitting to one side and alone, openly drinking from a bottle now and again. Our teacher came from a gigantic family, I learned, and none of them wanted the girlfriend close. But they made a show of weeping and holding each other, and Miss Gwen\u2019s students filled in the back rows, crying a little or more than than a little. I gave my tears to the show. Except I couldn\u2019t figure out one part, and I couldn\u2019t let it go.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the casket?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh, they cremated her,\u201d a classmate whispered.\nCremation happened on the banks of Ganges. Not in our part of the world, at least not in 1975.\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cBecause, Walt,\u201d he said, grimly happy to know things that I didn\u2019t know. \u201cShe got torn to pieces under the car.\u201d\nThat hard news was absorbed with a sob and a handful of unasked questions. Including me wondering whatever happened to that white chip of a tooth that rained down on her. That chip was suddenly important to me, and I don\u2019t know why.\nThis is what life has taught me:\nPeople are peculiar.\nA person can spend every day of his life finding examples of our spectacular oddness, and if that\u2019s what he likes to do, then his life is destined to be full and rich.\nReagan.\nI mean, really.\nWhere did we fail so spectacularly that we deserve to have Ronald Reagan on the news every night?\nNo, I\u2019m not talking politics. This isn\u2019t about Republicans, or even white male assholes. And despite what people think, I\u2019ll never waste my breath talking about the man\u2019s intolerance to people like us. Ask Melanie. We have friends who were hoping Reagan\u2019s son would reveal a hunger for other men. Except that is a fool\u2019s game. If you think Ronald Reagan would change his attitudes because of one dancing child, then you live in a simple and dangerously sentimental world\u2014a world where every opinion and policy is ready for radical revision with every first shove.\nHonestly, I would hate that kind of world.\nMelanie says I\u2019m cold, and she likes that about me.\nShe warns me that I\u2019m fooling people, meaning everybody except her. But that\u2019s how I survived four years in the boondocks, teaching future farmers how to read the works of dead men and a few women.\nI love Melanie, as best I can. But I know she gets tired of me.\nI get tired of me.\nBut Reagan, yeah. What makes me angriest about our President? He comes into office, and overnight our government\u2019s official policy is to act brazen in the face of every trivial threat. Like the Soviets, who don\u2019t look to me as if they\u2019ve got more than a few years of life remaining. In Reagan\u2019s world, we have to be geared up to fight a foe that could barely feed its own people. And meanwhile, our real troubles have to be mocked. Global warming. Nuclear proliferation. Corrupt governments supported by my tax dollars and everyone\u2019s complacency. This is the mess that one arrogant man has stirred with his cock, and we\u2019re into the second term of this bullshit, and I\u2019m just hoping there\u2019s still time to save the world before we have nothing but hope remaining.\nMelanie wants me to be calmer.\nExcept the storms are inside me. Most of the time, at least in public, I\u2019m sporting the calmest face in the room.\nShe says she mostly agrees with me. In fact, with her mind and her skills, Melanie is in an even better place to comprehend the enormous risks standing before this world.\nPeople do ask about the two of us.\nAnd I\u2019m talking about people who hold our ideals. Gay friends have questioned things, and my family never stops asking.\nI do prefer women.\nIt\u2019s my wiring, my constitution. Some fundamental talent of DNA coupled with a superior aesthetic.\nI don\u2019t know what it is.\n\u201cBut why her?\u201d my sister can\u2019t stop wondering aloud.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d is never an adequate answer. Except that is the answer, of course. \u201cBecause.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like your friend,\u201d my sister constantly tells me. Which underscores how little regard she has for Melanie. And that\u2019s before she delivers all of the usual reasons.\n\u201cThe drinking,\u201d says my sister.\nMy \u201cfriend\u201d has a habit, yes. I see it and I can\u2019t really approve, and sometimes, yes, the alcohol is in control.\n\u201cHer appearance,\u201d my sister mentions.\n\u201cAppearance\u201d can mean quite a lot. But my sister isn\u2019t talking just about the disheveled clothing and her weight. That doesn\u2019t cut to the heart of what\u2019s wrong. Melanie isn\u2019t pretty enough. That\u2019s what she and probably the rest of my family believes. My brothers, for instance. All three of them would accept a starlet, high tits and a narrow waist. Or at least they could come to terms with my nature a little easier, seeing that at the family gatherings.\n\u201cAnd besides,\u201d my sister always says. \u201cI don\u2019t like . . . none of us enjoy . . . how your Melanie treats you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business how she treats me,\u201d I have told her.\nA statement both true and useless.\nI have mentioned that my sister\u2019s husband is a beery brute, and maybe she should take care of her own life before charging into mine.\nThat tactic never works, but it does spice up Thanksgiving.\nOn other occasions, I\u2019ll say nothing. The cool, unreadable Gwen can nod in a way that\u2019s both noncommittal and only a little bit angry. Because frankly, how often can I disagree with an opinion that I myself share?\nMelanie can be difficult.\nI admit that, yes.\nIf I dialed my life back to my twentieth birthday, then maybe I would avoid her and the nearly two decades that followed. I would fall in love with somebody else. Shit, maybe I\u2019d surrender to convention, ending up with a heavy and often drunk man and three kids, and I\u2019d be teaching my soul out in some boondock bend in the goddamn road.\nBut then I would have missed the rest of it.\nI\u2019m smart and always have been. And my interests are broader than most people\u2019s interests. For example, I happen to be one of the great scientists among Literature majors, and if it comes down to it, I can do a better job describing quantum mechanics and high-energy physics than a lot of the geniuses who work with nothing else.\nMelanie taught me.\nTalk about your gifts.\nShe drinks too much. No question about it. And her hygiene could be improved. And we\u2019ve settled into that old-dyke mentality where sex is relegated to special occasions. But sex isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business, and what I get seems to be enough for me, and I don\u2019t hear her complaining much at all. And during all these years together, the woman has never stopped giving me the most amazing tales about space and time and that truer wonder called spacetime.\nI feel fortunate.\nAnd all my lady gets from me are angry words about an old man who might kill the world but hasn\u2019t yet and has only two years left in his second term.\nAnyway, here\u2019s my point in this roundabout story.\nThis winter, in Chicago. Melanie and I were attending one of her conferences, some of the big people in her business talking about neutrinos and Senators with pull and that huge underground ring they were building in Texas. Physicists wanted the ring finished, but there were a lot of complaints about the billions being spent. And I might have said a few carelessly skeptical words about the venture. But no, I really wanted the ring to happen, if only because my Melanie has assured me that we would learn a lot.\nExcept that\u2019s not quite it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll learn a lot, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\nShe\u2019s an arrogant broad. In every sense of the word, and she\u2019d be happy to hear me say it.\nChicago.\nYeah, we were at the conference. A six-inch snow made the city prettier than it deserves to be. Fermi people and their wives, and by chance, I was standing outside waiting for the bus that was supposed to shuttle us to another event. And that\u2019s when the blue light came. Brilliant and silent at first, but then we heard the crack of what wasn\u2019t thunder and was definitely far from normal.\nI knew that instantly.\nAnd nobody debated my ignorant assessment.\nMaybe a dozen geniuses were gawking at a sky that made no sense, listening to that long odd roar. And then every light in the city went out. Power was down across all of northern Illinois, although we didn\u2019t know it then. Maybe half of the scientists proposed that a suborbital nuke had generated some kind of blistering pulse. Except the glow didn\u2019t come from one point but seemed to be generated everywhere, and this was strange as hell, and what impressed me most was how excited they became, these brilliant men and that one woman who happened to be standing beside me, giggling with nervous joy at the idea of something that they couldn\u2019t quite explain.\nWhich would have been enough, obviously.\nI couldn\u2019t have imagined anything stranger than that.\nBut then the little bits of teeth and bone began falling on us and on millions of other people, and later came the soft ash that was never thick but easy enough to see on the fresh snow. And the scientists collected up samples along with snowballs, and a day later someone came out with the news that the ash and those tiny bits of teeth were human.\nAnd again, foolish as can be, I told myself that the story couldn\u2019t find a stranger gear.\nGrandparents wanted to see the kids. That\u2019s why we came back.\nMy hometown lured us in because we were tired of dealing with renters from a thousand miles away. But selling Gwen\u2019s old house meant cleaning it up first and probably seeing a new roof put on, and I would have preferred it if my folks could have volunteered to part of that work for us. That was my secret thought. But Gwen actually said it. She isn\u2019t normally that mouthy, but the town and her still remembered each other, and I suppose it\u2019s always going to be that way.\nAnd there\u2019s another reason to return: My firm was sending me overseas, probably for the next several years, and what with time distance and the vagaries of health, there was a respectable chance that one of my parents would never see our kids again.\nVagaries. Gwen dwells on little else, some days.\n\u201cI loved this place,\u201d she confided to me.\nWe were standing in front of her former home. The last of the renters had vanished, evicted and possibly now being pursued by various authorities. And they had left behind exactly the kind of mess you\u2019d expect.\n\u201cYou loved this place when?\u201d I asked.\nKnowing the possible answers.\n\u201cWhen I sat on this porch. Remember?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah.\u201d\nI was home from college and she was sitting in the shade. The English teacher with a tragic past. She was looking at me as I strolled past. I have no recollection about where I was going. Probably down to the Sinclair for a Pepsi, and it was definitely summer, just like today. It was bright and hotter than normal for morning. Not unlike now. Which I suppose is why my wife brought up that critical moment in both of our lives.\n\u201cYou said my name,\u201d I said.\nShe laughed and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou misheard me. I\u2019ve told you that.\u201d She kept laughing, looking for a place to sit again. Except there were no chairs, just black plastic sacks jammed with sour food and Walmart-crap toys. So she leaned against the railing, saying, \u201cWater.\u201d\n\u201cWalter,\u201d I said.\n\u201c \u2018I could use some water,\u2019 I mentioned.\u201d\n\u201cI heard Walter.\u201d\nSome stories never get old. We shared the laughter and I touched her on the cheek, my wife and the mother of two kids that I adored nearly as much as this bright, taciturn lady.\nAnd just like that, she gave me the look.\nWe went inside, into that house that needed to be burned more than cleaned and sold. That big worn house with the wide porch and dark deep rooms, including the bedroom upstairs, hot then and hot now. But it didn\u2019t slow us down any, neither time. And just like that, I felt like I was twenty again, screwing my English teacher, and her taking as much pleasure as any girl I would ever know.\nMaybe other women are more passionate with their men.\nI can\u2019t say.\nA bold and worldly fellow would have bedded a hundred women before giving up. But then again, I\u2019m not that way.\nWe finished and dressed, and Gwen asked, \u201cShould we rescue your parents?\u201d\n\u201cSomeday.\u201d\nThen we walked back out onto the porch, ready to resume our cleaning.\nA pair of locals were strolling past. Older ladies, and I knew their faces if not either name. But they absolutely recognized us. One nudged the other, and then they looked away when we started offering our eyes.\nIt pissed me off, just enough.\nI didn\u2019t live here anymore. And I sure as hell wasn\u2019t the twenty-year-old kid sleeping with his ex-teacher. Who was twenty-nine at the time, I could have pointed out to those fine ladies. Who was nine years my senior, do the math, and Gwen was a hundred times better than either of them were on their best days.\nMaybe I would have shouted something like that.\nBut what was a bright day suddenly turned infinitely brighter, and every piece of machinery, car and generator and working radio, stopped working. And that scorching bright blue light turned into darkness just before the pulverized bits of enamel started raining down.\nFunny the ideas that come to you.\nWe were wading through teeth and then the soft bony ash, and I was actually a little bit happy. Some incredible volcano had come to life nearby. That was my only working theory, regardless how crazy it sounded. And now the town was going to be destroyed, and we\u2019d just been saved from that awful business of cleaning out the filthy old house.\nExcept of course pretty much everybody else in North America was suffering nearly as badly as we were.\nIt was two weeks before life began to look normal.\nAnd another two weeks before our car was cobbled back together well enough to drive. The kids were in back. The radio was filled with news about the disaster and how President Gore was making new laws, keeping order over the mayhem. And that was the first time, a month after the nightmare began, when we heard the name Dr. Melanie Baxter.\nI was driving.\nGwen cranked up the volume, listening to something about a paper written back in the 70s.\n\u201cThe late Dr. Melanie Baxter,\u201d the voice said.\nShouting, Gwen ordered me to pull over.\nI already was.\nWe happened to be in a low spot not many miles from town. What had been several inches of ash and bone was being worked by the wind, stripped away in places and drifting deep in other places, accenting just how strange and awful the disaster had been. Experts were definite, certain, convinced. Judging by the DNA, these were human remains that had tumbled from the sky. A phenomenal mass of material, by any measure. And the blue flash was some sort of high-energy discharge, not predicted by anybody except a woman from a quarter century ago\u2014a suddenly famous doctoral student who was killed while driving alone one night.\nDrunk, Melanie had been.\nThey didn\u2019t mention that fact, and/or that the fatal crash happened after a fight with my wife.\nThat\u2019s why Gwen was crying now. I assumed. The memories of quite a lot were coming back. It sounds awful, but I have always been secretly glad that Gwen\u2019s first love was utterly lost, and the shock and guilt of that car crash was what gave me everything that I enjoyed today.\nI patted my wife\u2019s little hand, accomplishing nothing.\n\u201cI remember that paper,\u201d she muttered. \u201cShe told me . . . what did she tell me . . . ?\u201d\nI wished for a second blast of light, our car radio dying all over again.\n\u201cAbout spacetime,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout things bending until they break.\u201d\nAnd I\u2019m thinking: \u201cIsn\u2019t that true for all of us?\u201d\nHere\u2019s the joke:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between poets and physicists?\u201d\nAnd the punchline:\n\u201cPoets get two more productive years than physicists get.\u201d\nNot true, of course. Yeats lasted for decades, if I remember. And bless his heart, Einstein kept trying. Although really, if you want to be honest, how many times can one person do the impossible?\nOnce is enough for most us.\nWhich is why poets and the rest of us usually give up so soon. Being smart, we know the odds, and why waste fifty years dancing with endless failure?\nNow ask me why I drink.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cShe\u2019s washed up and hates herself and her failed genius and why wouldn\u2019t she drink?\u201d\nIs that the true story?\nOr maybe . . . maybe there\u2019s some sad tale at work. Emotional. Human. Nothing about mathematics or the deepest structure of our universe. That would help explain the old drunk, giving her that necessary human dimension. She had a love once, someone better than she deserved, but that woman left her for some sorry, ordinary reason, or worse, for no reason in particular. That\u2019s a tale worthy of a poet, not a professor, and hearing it, people would feel sorry for me, explaining fifty years of failure under the light of pain.\nWhy does pain produce light?\nThat\u2019s what I want to know.\nWe need a poet to explain this conundrum. Find a poet. Ask her, \u201cWhere\u2019s the brilliance in misery?\u201d Because I\u2019ve known all kinds of hurt in life, too many to count, and even during the worst days, my pain has never shown me anything but hard cold blackness.\nThe blue light.\nYeah, that bastard was plenty bright.\nNot that I saw it, of course. I was comfortably done with my day. And regardless what you think, even if I had seen the event, I wouldn\u2019t have guessed the source. That kind of knowledge took data and huge calculations that we wouldn\u2019t be able to make anywhere in the world, at least for another half year.\nSad to admit, I don\u2019t possess superhuman talents ready to unleash.\nIn fact, let me tell you this: On her finest day, the finest scientist doesn\u2019t know shit about almost everything. But that\u2019s the fun of it. That\u2019s why people want to be scientists. It\u2019s the dose of adrenalin that comes when you feel as lost as can be.\nDrunk, I happily slept through the blast and the first half hour of the emergency.\nI might have slept until dead, but neighbors remembered me and broke down my front door, dragging me out into the ash before the whole building came down. I don\u2019t know about where you lived, but we had nearly six feet of human remains dropping out of that black pain-rich sky, and half the local buildings were flattened, and I don\u2019t know how many died.\nWithout power or any infrastructure, being a scientist was tough. But I managed to work. It was easy to see the bits of teeth, and there was the rumor that these were human remains. Someone in Atlanta or Stockholm figured that out early, and I don\u2019t know where I heard it. But right there, that was an astonishment. One cremated human body yields about five pounds of tooth and crumbled bone. But the entire population of the world, women and men and fat children, won\u2019t render up more than forty billion pounds of nastiness. Which is nothing. Two million tons. That isn\u2019t enough material to fill up an old strip mine in Wyoming.\nA lot more than that fell on our heads.\nFor a full year, I lived in one refugee camp after another.\nHonestly? I\u2019ve never been happier. No drinking, mostly. And a lot of basic shit to get done. I\u2019ve always been good at figuring out problems, and everybody in authority wanted help with the most basic water-food-shelter conundrums. Which makes me wonder: Is this what physicists did before we solved the universe? Did we just find new ways to clean old water and make plants grow in the graveyard?\nThe important people eventually found me in New Mexico. A team flew all the way from the provisional capital in Portland. They just wanted to talk. But nobody flies that far, not anymore, and certainly not because of the need to chat. Those visitors kept calling me, \u201cDr. Baxter,\u201d and thanking me for my good work here and before. But I could see where they were heading, which is why I said, \u201cSpacetime shattered on us. Didn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThere were five of them, but one man did most of the talking.\n\u201cWhy do you believe that?\u201d he asked, sounding like a cop.\n\u201cNothing else explains it,\u201d I said, stating the obvious. \u201cThe event took our entire planet, which is just one planet. But for an instant of an instant, we were linked with billions of other Earths.\u201d\nEverybody nodded in agreement.\nExcept for the man in charge. \u201cBillions,\u201d he repeated, acting as if he wasn\u2019t happy with that estimate.\nSo I gave him my true numbers.\nThen I said to them, \u201cBut you already know this. Plenty of others must have done the arithmetic.\u201d\nThe man shrugged. Maybe yes, maybe no.\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re not just talking about Earths,\u201d I added. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is our Earth fusing with one tiny piece of ten trillion other Earths. The same piece repeated infinitely. And judging by the evidence, I\u2019d say that what fell on us was the remains of one person ground halfway to dust inside a cremulator.\u201d\nNobody spoke.\nEven my main interrogator knew to hold his thoughts inside.\nSo I added to my analysis, explaining, \u201cIf you find enough DNA, tracking down the dead person would be easy enough.\u201d\nWhich was when the woman in back\u2014the person who was really in charge of this vital, unthinkable mission\u2014finally spoke out.\n\u201cPerhaps that already happened,\u201d she said.\nAnd I laughed, right up until I noticed fear inside those various stares.\n\u201cIt\u2019s someone from our world,\u201d I guessed.\nEyes were focused on nobody but me.\nSo I made the obvious guess. \u201cThese are my ashes.\u201d\nWhich was when the man laughed, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an arrogant attitude.\u201d\nAnd his boss said, \u201cNo. But according to records, back in college and for several years, you knew the lady in question.\u201d\nI rarely get to meet legends.\nDespite a reputation for combativeness, this particular legend was nothing but pleasant. And even though we\u2019d all heard stories about failing health and a lousy sense of dress, Dr. Baxter looked fit enough to run, and her clothes hadn\u2019t been slept in more than one brief night.\nWe met her inside her office.\nSurrounding us were a million miles of tubes and tunnels, superconductive magnets and enough energy to make the Earth jump.\nThat\u2019s what she wanted to make happen.\nWho else in the world could have asked for permission to make the Earth jump?\nI was the least important person in the room. A career lawyer, at the end of my days, I was part of a team trying to determine the liability of the latest experiment.\n\u201cWe want to send a message to a tiny fraction of our neighboring Earths,\u201d Dr. Baxter was saying.\nFunny how easily you accept the amazing, particularly after reading a hundred briefings on the subject.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use diamonds,\u201d she said. \u201cTiny and very pure and marked in a variety of ways.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re just sending a few grams of diamonds,\u201d someone said.\nI was listening and I wasn\u2019t listening. There was a picture frame on the woman\u2019s desk, faces and places changing while the debate unfolded.\n\u201cA few grams is all we can afford,\u201d said Melanie Baxter. \u201cThe energy required is enormous enough as it is.\u201d\n\u201cBut how could anyone notice us?\u201d our doubter had to ask.\n\u201cBecause,\u201d I interrupted. Surprising myself as much as the others.\nCoaxing me with a small, grim smile, the genius said, \u201cPlease, continue.\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be the only people sending diamonds,\u201d I offered. \u201cThere\u2019s an infinite number of Earths, and some infinite slice will run the same experiment at the same time.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019re sending diamonds to just one other Earth,\u201d the doubter continued. \u201cAnd if there are infinite targets . . . \u201d\n\u201cRandomized distributions,\u201d said the genuine expert.\nAnd the rest of us fell into a studious silence.\n\u201cSome Earths will receive two shares, some won\u2019t get anything at all. But a few, a very few, are going to experience ten million shares. There\u2019ll be a visible EM display in the sky, and then the diamond grit falls and gets collected and people who look similar to us or exactly like us are going to peer into their microscopes, finding delicate messages etched in languages that might or might not resemble their own.\u201d\nIt was a fun moment, watching every face become awestruck.\nEven Melanie\u2019s face.\nThen I remembered another piece of the story.\n\u201cTime,\u201d I blurted.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d the doubter asked.\n\u201cThis is all going to be random in time too,\u201d I offered. Then I looked at the woman behind the desk, wondering if I was totally wrong.\nBut I wasn\u2019t, no.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked out the distribution curve,\u201d she said. \u201cEarths occupying our moment are the most likely targets, but the curve isn\u2019t particularly steep. That\u2019s why there\u2019s one chance in about five trillion chances that our diamonds will end up several years before today. And there are equal odds that they\u2019ll travel ahead in time instead.\u201d\n\u201cAnd once in a great while, they get noticed,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSending messages back in time,\u201d the doubter said, except he was sounding more intrigued by the moment. \u201cHow far back in time will we reach?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a distribution curve applied to infinities,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cWhen dealing with a trillion quadrillion zeros, things can turn fairly strange.\u201d\nTo the best of our abilities, each of us wrestled with that notion.\nAnd then the genius looked off at the ceiling, her heavy old face changing. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, except to say that she was suddenly sad enough to make me ache and happy enough to make me fly. That\u2019s what I saw in that one face, and because of that stark show of emotion, everybody else grew uncomfortable.\nOur leader decided it was time to leave.\nExcept for me. I lingered at the office door. A couple people said, \u201cWalt,\u201d but I ignored them. Then Melanie shut her eyes and sighed and opened her eyes, finding me watching the young face filling the picture frame on her desk.\n\u201cI knew your wife,\u201d I said.\nThe next smile was brighter, fending off every misery.\n\u201cMy condolences,\u201d I said.\nShe said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThen after a moment, \u201cHow did you know Gwen?\u201d\n\u201cShe taught me about Shakespeare during high school.\u201d\nMelanie laughed and said, \u201cThink of these odds.\u201d\nIt was fun to see the coincidences, yes.\n\u201cShe was a good teacher,\u201d said the widow.\n\u201cReally good,\u201d I agreed.\n\u201cSix months gone, and it feels like zero time has passed,\u201d she confided. Then she suddenly rose, saying, \u201cFunerals.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cGwen\u2019s ceremony didn\u2019t satisfy me,\u201d Melanie confessed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been thinking about what else to do.\u201d\nI nodded.\nThe woman leaned against her desk, lost in endless thought.\nNeeding something to break the silence, I said, \u201cYeah, Gwen was an excellent teacher.\u201d\nThe woman looked at me for the final time.\n\u201cTell me about your class,\u201d she said.\nWhat came to mind was spellbinding, but I couldn\u2019t share that. So instead, I smiled in a wistful way, saying, \u201cA friend of mine was playing around and then spilled his desk in class. And she instantly helped him.\u201d\nAnother nod, and the eyes dropped.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cMy Gwen would have kicked his ass for screwing around. And that\u2019s the woman I loved.\u201d\nRobert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

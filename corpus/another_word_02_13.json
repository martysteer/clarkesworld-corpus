She\u2019s been publishing since I was just learning how to do all this, and some of her books and short stories were things I read while I was figuring out how to write. While we were talking, we stumbled on the subject of a workshop she\u2019d taught recently, and how much it had dismayed her. Her students would, as part of the critique, point out flaws like, \u201cthe female characters are passive.\u201d\n Now, this was a weird conversation for me. I\u2019m talking to this woman who is way more experienced, way more accomplished, and someone I\u2019ve looked up to, and the problem that\u2019s got her exercised is that there are too many strong women characters? I didn\u2019t get it. So we talked some more, and slowly, I started to understand what upset her. Her students weren\u2019t drawing any kind of line between questions of craft and questions of morality.\n Since then, I\u2019ve put the argument to a few other folks, and the way I phrase it raises hackles sometimes, so hang with me for a second, and let me walk you through it. I\u2019m using strong female characters for the example, but there are as many different issues as you\u2019d care to pick. The argument the students were making was this: Sexism is bad shit. If you write a book that really embraces sexist stereotypes, you\u2019ve written what one critic of my very own called \u201can objectively bad book.\u201d If you\u2019re studying how to write, that pretty much means you don\u2019t want to make an objectively bad book, right? It follows as the night does the day, that you shouldn\u2019t write stuff with passive women, or women in need of rescue, or men who are motivated by grief over the death of a woman because those are sexist clich\u00e9s, and sexism is bad, and don\u2019t be bad.\n Which is to say (and here\u2019s where folks I like and respect start giving me the side-eye), fiction is best when it is morally instructive.\n Let me elaborate a little. Let\u2019s talk about Spiderman. The big quote that comes out of that project is, \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d The inversion of that is, \u201cWith utter impotence comes radical freedom.\u201d If what you do matters, then what you do matters. If it doesn\u2019t, then it doesn\u2019t. So does fiction have power? If it does, shouldn\u2019t some responsibility come with it? Or can we say it\u2019s powerful when it has the effect we like and say that artistic freedom is more important when it comes out wrong-way-round?\n I know a lot of readers. None of us come here because the books are empty and meaningless and carry no weight in our lives. We learn about some of the most important things in our lives vicariously through fiction. I don\u2019t know about you, but my opinions about love and fairness and what it means to be cool and what it means to be sad \u2013 how to grieve, how to love, how to think about God \u2013 all have roots in books. How Peter Wimsey saw Harriet Vane was actually important to me. I still have some verbal affectations I lifted off characters I read about in high school. My ideas about right and wrong track back to Senior English.\n I\u2019m not an outlier on that. I\u2019ve known a lot of people for whom books have been profoundly important, and not always books I like. I know a fair number of folks who imprinted on the novels of Ayn Rand, for instance and the short stories of Anais Nin.\n Fiction isn\u2019t powerless. And if the author just ignores the politics of their work, that doesn\u2019t mean the book becomes apolitical. It just means they wrote their own defaults. Think Black people are lazy and violent, but your work isn\u2019t about that? I\u2019ll bet you dollars to donuts it\u2019s in there.\n Reading is the same way. Aidan Moher over at A Dribble of Ink, set himself a public challenge to read as many books by women as he did by men. That\u2019s a moral statement. Just by doing that, he\u2019s said that gender equality is important, and that work by women deserves the same attention and audience as work by men. And more than that, he\u2019s said\u2014again, just by doing it\u2014that his own internalized sexism needs a conscious override. He\u2019s trying to be a better man and to create (in a small way) a better world by the way he chooses what he reads.\n I did something similar when I was in my twenties. For me, it wasn\u2019t about gender, but race. It\u2019s how I first read Langston Hughes, for instance and Colson Whitehead. I\u2019d already read some Walter Mosley and Maya Angelou, but it was a good excuse to revisit them. And it was a moral statement, even if it was mostly a private one.\n How we read and how we write will always have moral and political implications. The only choice we\u2019ve got is whether they\u2019re unconscious or considered. Period. End of story.\n Only it\u2019s not the end of the story, right? Because that lady I was talking about before? The Much Bigger Name? She\u2019s not stupid, and she\u2019s not narrow, and so there seems to be a contradiction there. And truth is that I\u2019m large. I contain multitudes. I believe absolutely what I said. But that\u2019s not all that I believe.\n There are two movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. They\u2019re talky, intellectual romances that I love so much I almost don\u2019t want to see the third one when it comes out in case they biff it. In the second movie\u2014Before Sunset\u2014Ethan Hawke\u2019s character draws this beautiful and damning distinction between trying to be his best self and trying to be his authentic self. I don\u2019t know if that speaks to other people as powerfully as it did to me, but I\u2019m still a little devastated by it.\n Wanting to live in a better world is great. Working for a better world is great. It only becomes a vice when it keeps us from loving the world we\u2019re in\u2014warts and all. My experience is that life is full of strong women and weak ones. Venal ones. Active ones. Passive ones. Complicated ones. Unhealthy ones. Men are just as varied and complicated and screwed-up. Their lives aren\u2019t our societal best self, but they\u2019re who we are, and losing sight of that is dangerous.\n When I say that fiction is best when it is morally instructive, the image I get\u2014and the one I\u2019m betting most of you get too\u2014is of an iron-spined Victorian woman who only reads Nice books. And the books I imagine her reading are thin, cardboard stories where everything comes out the way it ought to in a Miss Prism, The good ended happily, the bad unhappily; that is what fiction means kind of way. And because her imaginary morality isn\u2019t mine, I find the thought horrifying. We\u2019re right to distrust morally hygienic fiction, even when we approve of the morality that it\u2019s championing. Hell, maybe especially then. It\u2019s easy to forgive shallow arguments you already agree with.\n I think there\u2019s a tricky stretch when you\u2019re starting out on something new, like learning how to write or paint or make art. The danger of fighting for moral standards in a writing class is that you might win. New writers are still forming themselves and their literary projects. Treating moral issues as if they were craft is asking for a literature of beautiful sermons.\n Now, I love a good sermon. I reread Camus\u2019 The Plague every few years, and it\u2019s nothing if not a sermon. But I think Lolita is a good book too. And reading projects that pull you out into different kinds of authors and stories are wonderful so long as the moral aspects of your reading list don\u2019t become more important than the joy you take in reading. It\u2019s a fine line between thinking you should read something for moral reasons and thinking you should like it too.\n I would never argue that the power of story\u2014and it\u2019s a real power\u2014comes without responsibility. But I would say that responsibility is both to the better world to which we aspire and also the broken, compromised one we live in now. Both to the broader, deeper, sophisticated readers we would like to become and the guilty, familiar, selfish pleasures that brought us here in the first place.\n Daniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

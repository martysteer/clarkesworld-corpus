Smelling things is part of it, that thing I inherited from my Da, but it weren\u2019t just me who noticed it by the time he got close. The dragon stank bad enough that everyone breathed him in; the entire room hushin\u2019 up, listening to the tick-tick of claws on hardwood, lookin\u2019 at the door as he shouldered his way through.\n He was a tall critter, but stooped over to fit his tail, and he\u2019d been banged up good and proper by something a little more ruthless than the road. The wreckage that\u2019d once been wings were folded over his shoulders, draped like a tattered coat. There weren\u2019t nothing but a jagged nub of bone where his horns had been, and that weren\u2019t good: Da once told me a dragon without horns got ornery, and they were usually trouble for more than just the feller what cut \u2018em off.\n The dragon stared us down; no one said nothin\u2019 for a long stretch, but you can\u2019t stare at a thing like him forever. Someone up the back of the bar coughed, probably Sam Coody or one of his cloned deputies, and that was all it took for everyone to stop gawking and talk amongst themselves. The dragon sneered at us, showing off a ridge of serrated teeth, and walked over to the bar. We pretended we were okay with it, the dragon being there in the saloon, like it weren\u2019t no big deal, but our eyes drifted back. We watched him prop an elbow, easy as anything, and we waited for somethin\u2019 to happen.\n The doc leaned over and nudged me with that big bone hook he calls a hand. \u201cTrouble?\u201d\n I flinched \u2018fore I nodded, shying away from that hook. I didn\u2019t even need a vision to figure this one out; there was a gun belt hanging on the dragon\u2019s waist, visible every time he took a step, and Da never trusted strangers with guns. They were trouble, he said, and experience proved him right in the end. Doc Cameron knew that better than anyone.\n The doc weren\u2019t satisfied with that, though. There were something pinching at the edge of his eyes, a little scent of fear underneath his oily perfume. \u201cLook harder,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me what\u2019s coming,\u201d and he gave me a hard look, stared until I closed my eyes and peered forward, using Da\u2019s gift. I saw nothing but gray smoke, smelled nothing but fire. I could hear the sharp spit of an automatic through the haze.\n \u201cSomething\u2019s burnin\u2019, I can promise you that,\u201d I said, \u201cand I can hear a gun, Doc. Automatic. Someone\u2019s headin\u2019 for your slab, I think, before it\u2019s all over.\u201d\n Doc Cameron half-lowered his eyelids and scratched the sharp edge of his cheekbone. Something flickered across his pupils, a cluster of lights spiraling towards the tear ducts as he scanned the dragon. Military tech, a hold over from the war, the doc\u2019s little gift to Dunsborough. The little box on his belt hummed, fixing the data from the doc\u2019s cortical patch onto a slice of silicon.\n \u201cShould we tell Coody, do you think?\u201d I said, and the doc shook his head.\n \u201cThe sheriff will want details,\u201d Doc said. \u201cDamn fool won\u2019t run off a dragon based on a hunch, even one of yours.\u201d\n The doc sniffed. Coody was Da\u2019s friend, last of the men Da trained before the doc took over. Doc closed his eyes and a light on the box flickered, the data loaded up and ready for study. \u201cI\u2019m going to go download this. Keep an eye on the lizard, Paul. The real eyes and the other. Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d\n The doc slipped out the back way, eager to get back to his lab. I sat and drank my sarsaparilla and watched the dragon like I was told. I kept one hand under the table, close to that sharp knife Da gave me when I turned fourteen. The dragon didn\u2019t do much beyond ordering whisky. I closed two eyes and opened the third wide, peering forward for all I was worth; it got me nothing but smoke and gunshots and the beginning of a headache that would last for days.\n It weren\u2019t more than a half-hour after the doc scarpered before things got ugly.\n I can see trouble coming \u2018fore most folks, even without the third eye. It was Da that taught me the trick of it, the ways of reading a room and seeing who\u2019ll make the first move. The dragon weren\u2019t lookin\u2019 for trouble when he first walked in, but he were waiting for some to roll on by and get itself started of its own accord. In the old days Da would\u2019ve talked him around, but Da\u2019s long gone and Coody ain\u2019t quite got the knack of keepin\u2019 things peaceful. People in the bar worried, stayed quiet and whispered when they spoke.\n It were Kenny Sloan who stepped up, stompin\u2019 across the floorboards to get in the dragon\u2019s face. Sloan\u2019s one of the doc\u2019s razorfreaks, a \u2018borg with a handful of scalpels and jacked reflexes, fast enough to slice the wings off\u2019a fly. He put his weight against the bar and looked over at the dragon, propping his arm on the counter so the light gleamed off the metal. Kenny Sloan was a bully, like most of the doc\u2019s boys. He flipped a quick grin back at his cronies, making sure they were watching. \u201cHey, lizard,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI thought your kind knew better than to drink at human bars.\u201d\n The dragon turned then, mouth full of whisky, twin trails of smoke seeping out of its nose. The molten eyes squinted at Sloan, studying him. Sloan was a big guy, even before Doc jacked him up; no one missed him posturing. The noise died down and I saw Coody and his posse of badges straightening up in their corner, gettin\u2019 ready for real trouble. The dragon turned back to its whisky, ignoring us all. Sloan laid his fingers on the dragon\u2019s shoulder.\n \u201cHey, lizard,\u201d Sloan said. He flicked the mechanical arm out, blades sliding free of the finger sheaths. \u201cWe already beat your kind once, yeah?\u201d\n Things happened fast after that, probably too fast to get the details without the third eye\u2019s hindsight. Sloan went to strike the dragon, Coody and his tin-star heroes got up on their feet, and the dragon moved faster than all of them. A quick twist away from Sloan\u2019s swipe, wings flaring out behind him, the dragon\u2019s stance was low with clawed hands splayed wide. Sloan got himself gutted before his finger-blades crunched into the top of the bar, and he stood there, bleeding slow from a stomach wound and struggling to get his hand free.\n \u201cYou need a doctor,\u201d the dragon hissed. He swallowed the last mouthful of whisky, and Coody\u2019s men had him surrounded by the time he laid the glass down. The dragon eyed them carefully, all the sheriff\u2019s skinny mutant-clones with their clunky pre-war revolvers. Coody pulled Sloan\u2019s hand free of the hardwood; Kenny Sloan kept himself busy trying to hold in the mess of blood and gore that used to be his stomach. \u201cSorry for the mess,\u201d the dragon said, and he touched his blood-slicked claw to his forehead. His wings settled around him again, rearranging themselves to cover his gun belt and the sleek lines of his body. \u201cI\u2019ll see myself out, yes?\u201d\n The clones looked at Coody and the old man nodded; no one said squeak as the dragon walked away. Sloan moaned a little, making gurgling sounds when he tried to speak, and as soon as the dragon was gone the sheriff looked around and pointed in my direction.\n \u201cWhere\u2019s the doc?\u201d Coody said. \u201cBlood and thunder, son, go tell Cameron to hustle if he wants his pet \u2018borg to keep breathing.\u201d\n I nodded and started moving, but Sloan was a goner. The doc didn\u2019t care about his \u2018borgs the way Coody looked after his clones, \u2018specially not when they were as dumb as Kenny and there was prey on the horizon. I went \u2018cross the square and buzzed the doc\u2019s doorbell, but there was no answer coming. I had nothing to do but wait, go back to Coody, or go trailin\u2019 after the dragon like I was supposed to. None of them appealed. Kenny Sloan was screaming inside the bar, dying slow and messy, so I went with the best option of the three; I ambled down the main street, following the soft buzz in my head that\u2019d tell me where to find the dragon\u2019s camp.\n The dragon was hiding out by Prickly Pear Hill, his bedroll stretched out in the middle of the twisted cacti that soaked up moisture from the stream curving \u2018round the base of the slope. He looked like he was traveling light; a small pack looked empty, like he\u2019d been killing food on the march, but when I strolled in I got the familiar itch and saw dirt piled up where he\u2019d buried supplies. I opened the third eye, peered on down, and got a sense of crates, canned food, and cordite.\n I had myself a few good minutes before the dragon rolled in, largely thanks to the fact that I weren\u2019t forced to backtrack in case the town sent out a posse. I sat on a rock and kicked the dust, listening hard, trying to hear him coming. It didn\u2019t work; I didn\u2019t hear him, see him, didn\u2019t even smell him this time around. I ain\u2019t easy to sneak up on, but he managed it. I just blinked my eyes and there he was, crouched low with claws out and hot spit dribbling down his chin.\n \u201cBoy,\u201d he said, nostrils flaring, and at that the smell of sulfur rose up around me. \u201cYou were at the bar, yes? Town sent you?\u201d\n I nodded, keeping my hands out in the open. I weren\u2019t armed with much, just my Da\u2019s knife, and it seemed to calm the dragon. He knelt down, sniffed me, then sighed a stream of smoke into the air. \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have gifts.\u201d\n \u201cA bit,\u201d I said. \u201cNot much, not really.\u201d\n He sniffed again, breathing deep. I recognized the trick from when Da used to do it, knew about the clues you could pick up with the right kind of training. The third eye does big things, its own special kind of magic, but Da always said there were other senses to fill in what the third eye can\u2019t see. The dragon smiled at me. \u201cTrained, then? Your father?\u201d\n I shrugged the question away. \u201cI work for the doc,\u201d I said. \u201cHe runs things; wanted you followed.\u201d\n The dragon cocked its head, smiling. \u201cDangerous work, yes?\u201d\n I said nothing, just crouched there on my rock and waiting for what would come. I had enough of my Da in me to know I weren\u2019t going to die there, but that didn\u2019t mean I weren\u2019t going to pay hard for daring to follow him out there. I waited for the dragon to lash out, making use of his claws.\n It ain\u2019t often I\u2019m surprised, but he surprised me then. \u201cI make tea, yes?\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d I blinked, and he watched me carefully. I forced myself to nod. \u201cYes. Please, yes.\u201d\n I squirmed. The dragon turned his attention to the fire, hocked a sharp gob of spit into a pile of kindling to get things going. He unearthed an iron pot and loose tea from his pack, crouched down by the flames to set it boiling. There was something fascinating about the muscles moving under his scales, about the way sunlight gleamed on the dark ridges across his hands. He sat, dignified, and waited.\n \u201cYou\u2019re after someone,\u201d I said. \u201cI saw that much, back in the saloon. Can\u2019t see who, or why, but it\u2019s going to end messy.\u201d\n The dragon kept its eyes on the tea. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s the doc,\u201d I said. \u201cHe got plenty nervous when you showed up, hurried off to his lab right fast. That ain\u2019t like him, really. Doc Cameron likes his body parts, having new bits to play with.\u201d\n That earned me a reaction, a snort of smoke and a twitch in the folded wings. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cSo what\u2019s going to happen, when you front up again?\u201d\n The dragon settled back on its haunches, stirring the pot. He lifted the pan and poured spiced tea into a pair of metal mugs, both of them bearing scorch marks on the rim. He handed one to me and I saw flecks of Sloan\u2019s blood drying on the dragon\u2019s claws. \u201cYou have the Sight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d\n My forehead tingled, all prescience and instinct, but turned up nothing new. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen yet; the future\u2019s nothing but smoke and gunfire.\u201d I took a long sip of the tea, felt the chili powder burning the back of my throat as it went down. The dragon watched me drink, red eyes narrowed to slits. I figured I knew what he was waiting for. \u201cAsk,\u201d I said. \u201cI ain\u2019t going lie.\u201d\n \u201cYou have the sight, yet you work for your doctor?\u201d\n I guessed what he was asking and short-cut to the answer. \u201cHe did some bad stuff when he arrived,\u201d I said. \u201cBut good stuff, too. Helped people, gave \u2018em back stuff they\u2019d lost. Relics of the war, sure, but they had arms and legs again. They could work, and we needed workers.\u201d\n The dragon\u2019s laughter sent hot spit across the campfire. He put his cup down, tilting forward, and when he straightened up one of those ancient Lugers sat neat and easy in his hand. He pointed the narrow barrel in my direction, eyes narrowed down to stare at me. \u201cYou know, then,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what your doctor has done?\u201d\n \u201cBits and pieces. Glimpses, really, but I got plenty of after what he\u2019s done since coming to town.\u201d I watched the cold fire in the dragon\u2019s eyes.\n The dragon breathed deep. \u201cHe killed your father?\u201d\n I nodded again.\n \u201cAnd you work for him, still?\u201d\n \u201cSure enough.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cNeeds to be done.\u201d I sipped my tea, staying calm; he wasn\u2019t going to shoot me, I could see that much. I don\u2019t have all my Da\u2019s gifts, not even half, but I was sure enough of that. \u201cNot much good tellin\u2019 folk \u2018round these parts he\u2019s the devil; they need the doc too much to care and it ain\u2019t like anyone\u2019s goin\u2019 to be surprised by revelations of shady dealin\u2019s. And my Da didn\u2019t hold with revenge, really; he cared about keepin\u2019 folks safe. He would-a done the same as me, most likely, if he ain\u2019t ended up dead. These are nasty times; it takes a nasty man or a brave man to keep a town safe.\u201d\n \u201cYour father was brave.\u201d\n \u201cAnd look where it got him.\u201d I tried to keep the anger out of my voice, to avoid the flashes of history that rolled in if I let myself dwell on feeling. Hindsight can be a curse, Da said, and he weren\u2019t half wrong about that. \u201cWe\u2019re out of brave men, now he\u2019s dead. All we\u2019ve got left is the nasty folk and the followers. Way I see it, I can have the doc dead or everyone else can live.\u201d\n The dragon\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change and the Luger didn\u2019t waver, but the tattered wings rippled as he adjusted his stance. The crooked line of its broken horn caught the firelight. \u201cWhat you have seen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot save him.\u201d\n I shook my head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t lying,\u201d I said. \u201cHaze, smoke, and gunfire, that\u2019s all I got; one of you will die, but I don\u2019t know who.\u201d I paused, drinking the last of the tea. \u201cI got a fair guess about what happens next, though, after he\u2019s dead. It ain\u2019t pretty, not by a long stretch. Out here with nothing but Coody to keep things safe, it\u2019ll go downhill fast.\u201d\n The dragon nodded, holstering the Luger and picking up its tea. \u201cYou should go.\u201d\n I lingered for a moment, wondering what to do with my cup. The dragon rose, staring down at me. \u201cGo! Tell your doctor I am coming.\u201d\n I went, slinking back towards town with the tin cup still in my hand.\n Coody\u2019s clones were manning the walls, so there was no real chance to sneak into town without anyone noticing. Two of them came down to the front gate to greet me, clamped down on my shoulder with heavy hands and started guiding me down Main Street. Four others stood on the palisade, dull eyes scanning the horizon while another one swept the landscape with the town spotlights. All of them tall, slack-jawed, armed; they looked the part, despite their daft expressions, hands on the holsters and eyes following the point of light that raked the landscape. The two walking me in said nothing, just held my shoulder and marched. I coulda given them the slip\u2014Coody\u2019s clones aren\u2019t as bright as him, and he ain\u2019t exactly sharp as knives to begin with\u2014but a trip to the sheriff\u2019s office gave me a good excuse to stay clear of the doc\u2019s lab and delay my report by a few minutes.\n The original Coody was sitting on the porch of his office, whispering orders into a radio and making a big show of checking the action on the shotgun across his lap. He didn\u2019t even look when his clones threw me against the step, just pumped his gun with a satisfied grin and cradled it \u2018cross his lap.\n \u201cSent you to go fetch the doc, Paul,\u201d he said. His good eye squinted as he drew a pistol and checked its load, the other glowing big and red beneath the doc\u2019s metalwork. \u201cCost us bad, you not doin\u2019 what I told ya. Sloan was dead \u2018fore the doc could get to him, nothin\u2019 left but parts.\u201d\n Da tried training Coody, just like he trained me, but the sheriff ain\u2019t got none of the natural talent Da had for prescience or reading people. It made lying to him dangerous; he had to grind the answer out of you if he wanted to be sure of something.\n \u201cCalled the doc and got no answer,\u201d I said. \u201cHe left me orders, \u2018fore he left for his lab, and I followed \u2018em when he didn\u2019t come to the door. You sayin\u2019 I done the wrong thing? That I shoulda\u2019 leant on his doorbell instead of doin\u2019 what he asked?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d Coody\u2019s eyes scanned the town in a long, slow arc. \u201cDoc Cameron\u2019s the brains behind this town, but I\u2019m the law, kid. I\u2019m the one who has to keep people safe now . . . \u201d He cut himself off before he mentioned Da, took a deep breath to clear the thought out of his head.\n I shook my head. \u201cYou really believe that, Sam?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d One hand patted the shotgun and he looked at me for the first time, the mechanical right eye clicking as it focused on me. That eye was Doc Cameron\u2019s idea, a replacement for one Coody had lost during the last war. I was willing to bet that Cameron could see what Coody saw, if the doc had half-a-mind to check in. \u201cWhat did the doc have you doing?\u201d\n I shrugged, and Sam Coody cuffed me across the back of the head. I went down in a heap, spitting red dust. \u201cYou wanna try that again, Paul?\u201d\n \u201cHe had me trailing the dragon.\u201d I sat up. \u201cWanted to know if it was after him.\u201d\n \u201cAnd is it?\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cClose enough to.\u201d\n Coody sighed and rubbed his good eye with his right hand. \u201cSo, you peered into the future on this one? It going to end bad, Paul?\u201d\n He held out his hand, helping me onto my feet. \u201cIt\u2019s going to end, Coody,\u201d I said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen spit worth talking about, but there\u2019s gunfire ahead and plenty-a screamin\u2019. Dragon\u2019s got the sight, I think, an\u2019 he figures someone\u2019s goin\u2019 to die, but damned if I can see who.\u201d\n Coody squinted. The long mustache twitched as he chewed on his bottom lip. He didn\u2019t say nothing for a real long time.\n \u201cI gotta report to the doc,\u201d I told him. \u201cHe\u2019ll be expecting me, Sam.\u201d\n \u201cGo,\u201d the sheriff said, and he went back to his guns.\n No one likes going into Doc Cameron\u2019s bunker, least of all a guy like me, someone with the sight. Places like the bunker are always screaming, the echoes of the past ringing out again and again. But there isn\u2019t a damn fool in town that ain\u2019t carrying the doc\u2019s handiwork somewhere, not even me and I\u2019m a damn sight cleaner than most, and Doc Cameron liked to keep tabs on folks. There were places I could hide, if I set my mind to it, but I\u2019d come out eventually and pay my dues for disobeying him. I set across the square, and putting an eyeball to the scanner by the door, let myself into the bunker to tell the doc all the things he didn\u2019t want to hear.\n My gut and my prescience both said it was a bad call; a braver man would\u2019a skived off and spent the next day or three in his bunk, waiting out the storm until the shootin\u2019 was over. I wasn\u2019t a brave man, so I stood there until the steel doors swung open and a pair of Doc\u2019s razorfreaks fell into step behind me and escorted me through the winding tunnels Doc\u2019s boys hollowed out back when they first arrived.\n The doc was down in his workshop, working on Sloan\u2019s corpse. He had the bone hook in the corpse\u2019s stomach, pulling down and opening the skin like a zipper. The smell of it made me gag, but he didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cHe\u2019s here for me, isn\u2019t he? The dragon?\u201d\n I looked over my shoulder at the razorfreaks, big lunks who stood there, uncaring and mute. Doc looked up from the slick gore of Kenny Sloan\u2019s innards, glared at me with cold eyes until I gave in and nodded.\n \u201cWho shoots who, Paul? Tell me how much it\u2019ll cost me to win?\u201d\n I closed my eyes and looked, hoping to get lucky: mist; gunshots; the screams of the dying. \u201cI wish I knew, Doc.\u201d\n Doc Cameron nodded and buried his long nose back in Sloan\u2019s vitals, poking about with the claw and good hand alike. His white coat was blood-splattered as he pulled the tech outta the dead. The days of the war were a long time past and supplies weren\u2019t comin\u2019 in; as the doc was fond of reminding us, it was a waste-not, want-not world now. He spooled cabling onto the slab, a thin line of plastic and fibers that had been in-and-out of \u2018borgs since the early days of the war. \u201cYou talked to the dragon, at least?\u201d\n I nodded.\n \u201cWhat did he have to say?\u201d\n \u201cNot much.\u201d I fidgeted best I could between Cameron\u2019s guards. \u201cHe\u2019s coming for you, knew I had the sight. He wanted me to look into the past, get a good look at what you did during the war.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you did?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n Doc Cameron smiled. \u201cYou disappoint me, Paul. I thought you were built of sterner stuff.\u201d He stood up, abandoning his work. Sloan\u2019s guts dripped off the bone hook. He shook his head, full of mock sorrow. \u201cWhat would your father think? A brave man like that, ending up with a boy like you?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care what my Da thought, Doc. My Da is long dead.\u201d\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t I believe you, Paul?\u201d The doc\u2019s grin was terse, lips folded tight against his teeth. He held his bone hook like an offering, the oily smear of blood covering the tip. \u201cTouch it, boy. Let us find out what kind of man you are.\u201d\n Da used to say there were people who didn\u2019t come out of the war quite right, and there were pretty good odds the doc was one of them. I forced myself to look him in the eye. \u201cDon\u2019t matter what you done, Doc. Not during the war, not last week, not when you first met the dragon and did whatever ya done to him. If you\u2019re the one who goes down . . . \u201d\n \u201cYes, if I go down.\u201d He let the thought hang, thin lips twitching, but neither of us finished it. He nodded to the razorfreaks and they hustled me out. I didn\u2019t bother struggling as they clamped their steel hands on my arms and lifted me, carrying me out.\n The other freaks buried Sloan right on sunrise, interring the small bag of meat parts the doc couldn\u2019t use into the red dirt just outside of town. Coody and his clones watched things from the wall, stiff-backed guardians with shotguns and rifles, not wanting spit to do with the doc\u2019s bullyboys. They were allies, sure, when the town needed defending, but it was uneasy at the best of times and tense at the worst.\n Coody doubled the guard that night. Buried meat had a way of attracting scavengers and things went downhill real easy after that happened.\n My gut said we were safe for a day or two at least, and there were no tingling on the third eye to say it were wrong, so I drifted past Coody\u2019s office and let him know we had some time up our sleeves.\n \u201cBest keep an eye out,\u201d Coody told me. \u201cJust in case, like.\u201d His logic was bravado, mostly, for all the truth of it. You didn\u2019t have to have the sight to feel the tension; the whole damn town was on edge, waiting, and Doc Cameron had been locked up inside his vault for nineteen straight hours trying to figure a way to save his skin. Da told me plenty of stories about his time in the army. Said we fought a whole damn war against the dragons and it\u2019d cost us big every time the shooting started; one o\u2019 them might not seem much of a threat, but it was going to hurt everyone when he drifted through town again.\n I spent the day in my bunk, trying to open the third eye or dream up a vision. Going forward got me nothing new, and going back taught me nothin\u2019 that I hadn\u2019t already suspected: Doc Cameron was never a nice man, and the war gave him ample chances to prove it over and over. He was cruel, yes, but I knew that, and there were lots more that seemed understandable given the cruelty goin\u2019 on back then. And it\u2019s not like any of his habits changed much between the war and now, he just had fewer folk to experiment on and more opportunity for vivisection.\n Coody came to see me, late in the afternoon. I didn\u2019t bother getting out of my bunk as he shouldered his way through the front door. He hooked one of my stools with the toe of his boot and slung it by the bed, settling down with shotgun still resting on his right shoulder. \u201cYou been lookin\u2019?\u201d\n I nodded.\n \u201cYou see anythin\u2019 yet?\u201d\n I shook my head and Coody grimaced, adjusting his weight on the stool. I saw one of his clones waiting by the door, smooth face filled with a slack-jawed grin as it kept watch on Main Street. It was Coody\u2019s face, but younger and dumber. The man sitting next to me was weathered and creased, carrying the weight of too many years. My Da\u2019s friend, a good man, doing his best in tough times.\n \u201cI was in the war with your father,\u201d Coody said. \u201cSaw a damn sight more than I wanted to. Tangled with the dragons a couple of times before things went completely south. Whole damn race was human once, before they took to mutation. Damn things only exist because of folks like Cameron messing about with genes. Guessin\u2019 you\u2019re young enough not to remember that?\u201d\n I shook my head.\n \u201cTough critters to face down,\u201d he said. \u201cFast. Strong. They smell you comin\u2019 before you even know you\u2019re goin\u2019 to draw. Saw a camp after the bastards attacked it one night. Lots of folks dead in their bunks\u2014never heard \u2018em coming, motion detectors picked up nothing. You understand what I\u2019m saying, Paul?\u201d\n I shrugged. Coody paused and took a long breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve looked back, ain\u2019t you?\u201d\n I nodded, watching the gleam of Coody\u2019s mechanical eye, the way it whirred when he focused on me. I tried not to think of the doc watching me through it, listening in on the conversation.\n \u201cAnd the doc, he probably deserves what\u2019s coming, one way or another?\u201d\n I hesitated, just for a moment, then I nodded again. Coody sagged. \u201cDamn.\u201d\n There was a breeze outside, cold and gentle. I could hear the soft squeak as the wind-pumps in the town square dredged water out of the basin underneath the town. Coody leaned back in his chair, heel of his thumb working along the steel ridge of his bad eye. I twisted in the bunk, trying to get away from the dull red gleam as he stared at me.\n \u201cI ain\u2019t carrying a gun,\u201d I said.\n Coody nodded. \u201cI never asked you to.\u201d\n \u201cMy Da . . . \u201d\n \u201cYour father was your father, not you,\u201d Coody said. \u201cYou ain\u2019t him, Paul. I know that. He\u2019d know it too, if he were still around. Things change, right enough, and you change along with \u2018em or pay the price.\u201d Coody pushed back on the stool, scraping it along the floorboards. I watched the red light of his eye bob as he pushed himself upright, shotgun sliding down into his hands. \u201cD\u2019ya know when the bastard\u2019s coming, then?\u201d\n I shrugged into the darkness. The night-vision optics installed in the eye would let Coody see the gesture. \u201cTomorrow, maybe the day after. He\u2019s got the eye, and he\u2019s better than me, I think. Good, as good as Da were. Makes it hard to predict him.\u201d\n Coody grunted and thumped across the hut, settling in at the doorway to take a long look down the street. \u201cFolks are goin\u2019 to die, Paul. Nothin\u2019 you can do about that. But if this thing\u2019s goin\u2019 to win, I want to know. Something\u2019s gotta protect this town, if the doc takes a bullet to the gut, and I ain\u2019t bettin\u2019 on the lizard to hang around to do the job.\u201d\n I said nothing. There weren\u2019t much to say to that.\n \u201cI\u2019m thinking of letting him through,\u201d Coody sighed, shifting his weight. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky he\u2019ll come in quiet. Try and gut the doc and get out before anyone knows he\u2019s here. It ain\u2019t a nice idea, since it means losing the doc and all, but it\u2019ll keep some folk alive I reckon.\u201d\n I thought about the dragon\u2019s camp: the cases he buried in the dirt, the dwindling supplies, his anger burning like kindling under a blowtorch. I shook my head. \u201cHe won\u2019t come quiet,\u201d I said. \u201cHe ain\u2019t planning on leaving anything behind after this is over.\u201d\n \u201cEven then,\u201d Coody said. \u201cGod help me, even then, it might not be a bad idea.\u201d He stepped outside then, saying nothing else, and I watched him go with a bad feeling in my stomach.\n I made myself scarce after Coody left, grabbed my blanket and my Da\u2019s knife and left my shack behind. Sam Coody might not be askin\u2019 me to carry a gun, but the doc wouldn\u2019t hesitate if he got scared enough. People get confident when you put the sight and a gun together, like there ain\u2019t nothing to worry about if you can see what\u2019s gonna happen. Da\u2019s fault, mostly, \u2018cause he proved folks right around these parts, leastwise until the doc showed up. He did it here and he did it in the war, skated through everyone on sight and bravery. If Coody pulled the clones from the wall, left the dragon to the razorfreaks and \u2018borgs to deal with, you could bet Doc Cameron would call in every favor he had to save his skin.\n Getting around town without being seen is easy enough if you\u2019ve got the practice, \u2018specially once you know that the cameras you gotta avoid are stuck inside o\u2019 folk\u2019s heads instead of grafted to the side of buildings. I made for the water-tower on top of the saloon, wormed my way deep into the shadows underneath and hid there amid the splinters and the dust. It had a good view of the main street and I had a headache building up, a heavy weight that built up in the center of my forehead.\n I slept there, fitful and quiet, away from where Doc and Coody could find me. I dreamt of Da on that last day, back when the doc first pulled into town. I dreamt of the future, of the dragon arriving, and heard a new sound among the gunfire: a sharp, wet bang, like someone \u2018sploding one of the paddymelons that grow down by the river, and Coody\u2019s headless corpse fell out of the smoke and lay smoking at my feet.\n I woke up with the dragon crouched over me, his snout close enough for me to smell the sulfur. Gun in hand, eyes scanning the street. I stifled a scream and the dragon smiled. \u201cYou are hiding, yes?\u201d\n I coughed, soft and spluttering, before I said yes. The dragon peered across the street, watching the doc\u2019s muscle gathered \u2018round the bunker. Razorfreaks, the lot of them. Twenty men, maybe; all of them \u2018borged. \u201cA lot of claws in those arms,\u201d I said. \u201cSuicide to dive down and attack \u2018em.\u201d\n The dragon just shrugged. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cI had a dream.\u201d I pushed myself up on my elbows, whisper turning into a growl. \u201cI don\u2019t know who dies between you and the doc, but I know who it costs us while the fighting goes down. The sheriff\u2019s going to let you in, assume you\u2019ll go quiet and leave everyone else alone. He figures there\u2019ll still be a town standing after you\u2019re done; that he\u2019ll protect the rubble from the predators and rebuild with the survivors.\u201d\n \u201cHe is wrong,\u201d the dragon said. \u201cIt will cost him, yes? Boom, yes?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n He smiled at me, showing off the ridge of serrated teeth. \u201cAnd so, you will stop me?\u201d\n I shivered despite the heat. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d\n \u201cYou think,\u201d the dragon said. He shook his head. \u201cYou think.\u201d\n I could swear the wheezing noise it made after that was something like a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the sight,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know how this will end.\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d the dragon said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen my death.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n The dragon shrugged and checked the safety on his pistols. He squinted at the sun a moment, as though checking the time. \u201cIs done,\u201d he said. \u201cAll done. There is nothing to stop it now.\u201d\n I sniffed then, smelling him: brimstone and cordite.\n There weren\u2019t anything quiet about the way the dragon was going down.\n The first thing to go was the southern palisade. The rumble of the explosion rolled down the main street shaking red dust off buildings and rattling the windows. I was climbing down when it happened, got rattled off the side of the saloon and fell awkward in the dusty alley behind it. Pain rolled down my right shoulder as the screaming started out on the main street, people running for cover as the razorfreaks charged. I could hear the fight starting through the haze of smoke and dust: staccato bursts of gunfire; the cries of the dying, the dragon returning fire from his vantage on the rooftop. The doc\u2019s boys were fast and strong, but they weren\u2019t trained as much more \u2018n muscle. It\u2019d take \u2018em a couple-a minutes to realize the shooter was somewhere up and outside the billowing cloud of smoke.\n I scrambled to my feet and went for the wall, stumbling as the second bomb went off somewhere down the street. Dragons were quiet, Coody said, and hard as hell to detect; there\u2019d be bombs all across town to create the distraction he was looking for, enough to flood the streets in smoke and fire, to ruin the infrared eyes the doc gave his razorfreaks to let \u2018em see in the dark. Coody and his clones gave minimal assistance, filling the street with spotlights while they took cover from the gunfire. They didn\u2019t move to help the razorfreaks, just dug-in and waited, a dozen of them with rifles not even looking for a shot. Coody stood behind the steel barrels of water we carted in from the reservoir, shotgun on his shoulder as he scanned the streets. The steel plate over his right eye shone in the light; he didn\u2019t notice me coming, not \u2018til I slid into place beside him. I yelled the word bomb, trying to get louder than the din. Coody nodded, looking irritated, and pointed at the carnage.\n \u201cBomb,\u201d I said, screaming it, and pointed at his eye-plate. This time it sunk in, and he turned a little pale. I closed my eyes as another dynamite charge went off, caught a glimpse of the future. Clearer now, full of shapes, the sounds getting louder and louder as prescience became past. Coody ordered his clones into the street, ordered another two onto the walls to start searching the rooftops for the dragon and take him down with a rifle-shot.\n I peered forward, snatching another glimpse. The gunfire and screaming in the smoke-haze started to die down. It was random now, scattered, the dragon picking the last of the razorfreaks off. My gut said we were out of bombs and out of mobs, so the killing would get real personal from here on in. I heard Coody calling orders, telling his clones to sweep the street, get survivors under cover and start putting out the fires.\n I knew when I was going to die, if I didn\u2019t do anything stupid with my life. First trick Da taught me, when he figured out I had the sight. You look forward and you see your death, and you know that\u2019s how it\u2019ll end if you don\u2019t mess up destiny too bad in the meantime. The dragon knew it too, and so did my Da. It ain\u2019t writ in stone, but it\u2019s good enough. It takes some real stupidity to mess those visions up.\n Da was supposed to die an old man, but he pushed things too hard. I was supposed to die an older man, and I hadn\u2019t pushed a damn thing, not since the doc came to town. I closed my eyes and looked, forcing my way through the smoke. Somewhere in the future the dragon was going to die and the doc would punish Coody for it. Or the doc was going to die and take Sam Coody with him. There weren\u2019t many ways it come out good for the sheriff, and there were a damn sight fewer where it came out good for the town.\n I got out my Da\u2019s knife and stepped forward, walking into the smoke.\n I found the doors to the doc\u2019s bunker open wide, the locks burned through with dragon-spit and smeared with oil and blood. I stood there a moment, breathing against a handkerchief to avoid choking on the dust. Coody stepped up beside me, shotgun in hand. \u201cHe in there?\u201d he asked, and I nodded and tapped my nose. \u201cSulfur,\u201d I said, and went in, holding my knife out before me like it\u2019d do a damn thing against anything we\u2019d find running loose in the dark of the bunker. Coody followed on behind me, his mechanical eye clicking as it adapted to the darkness.\n \u201cYou seen anything?\u201d he asked me, \u201clike, maybe, who\u2019s going to win?\u201d\n I shook my head, stepped over the body of a dying \u2018borg. \u201cGet outta here, Sheriff. You don\u2019t want to be close to the doc today.\u201d\n We heard a gunshot, deeper in, the sound of someone scrambling and running. Coody moved a little ahead of me, raised the shotgun. \u201cIt ain\u2019t exactly a choice, Paul. Dyin\u2019 comes with the badge.\u201d\n He started moving in, gun at the ready, letting me follow behind. I tried to peek at the future, but there was nothing to see. Not anymore. Too many muddled pieces on the board, too many people trying to bluff and get a better result out of the hand fate dealt them. Occasionally we\u2019d pass a body, see drips of blood on the concrete or smears of it on the wall. It\u2019s a twisty path, heading down to the doc\u2019s lab, and plenty of corridors leading off to the side. We found him hiding in one about halfway down, crouched in the darkness with a bone-saw in his fist. He was bleeding, the doc, but he moved okay when he saw us. \u201cA grazing shot,\u201d he said, \u201clucky, at best.\u201d\n \u201cThe dragon,\u201d Coody said. He pumped his shotgun for emphasis, chambering a live shell.\n \u201cDeeper in,\u201d Doc Cameron said, \u201cthere\u2019s a few boys towards the lab, trying to contain it.\u201d He paused a moment, stared at Coody. \u201cThey\u2019re doing your job, sheriff, unless I miss my guess. Perhaps you should go join them.\u201d There was steel in his voice as he said it, and his good hand at his belt hovering over the little box patched into his computer.\n \u201cThe dragon\u2019s your mess,\u201d Coody said. \u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d\n The doc\u2019s gaze slid over to me, then back up to Coody. \u201cI gather you\u2019ve been informed of that,\u201d he said. The laugh that followed was high-pitched, a trill of amusement.\n Down the corridors, in the doc\u2019s lab, we heard someone screaming. \u201cProbably best if you hurry,\u201d Doc said. He laughed again, winced, put his hook against the wall to steady himself. Blood loss, I figured. The scratch in his side weren\u2019t as minor as he made out. Prescience said the doc was already dead, just running out the final moments before the injury put him down. The only question now was whether the dragon and Coody went with him.\n He wheezed for breath, leaning forward, and the hand over his computer box strayed a little too far. His eyes were stuck on Coody, waiting for the decision. I thought about Da for a moment, about dying old and safe, then I trusted my gut and Da\u2019s knife and went at the doc with a bloody yell and the knife twisting straight for stomach.\n It cost me a hook across the face, stabbing the doc in the gut. He slashed me hard, but it didn\u2019t kill me; didn\u2019t even hurt when he followed up, jamming the hook in my stomach and ripping a shallow trench through the skin and the gizzards. The pain was bad, even looking back with hindsight, but I figure it was worth it. I got the knife in the doc two or three times in return, kept him busy while Coody lined up the shot and let the shotgun go boom \u2018til he ran out of ammo. I weren\u2019t conscious to see it happen, but the doc went down. Went down hard, a bloody mess, and Coody standing over him with the gun just-in-case, calling down the clones to stitch me up and get me walking.\n I spent a week or two in bed, healing up from my injuries, and would have myself some nice scars to show off by the time I was healed. The dragon was gone by the time I came to, walked out of town by Coody with supplies and a warning. There weren\u2019t much left for him in town, with the doc laid out for burial, and there were plenty of folks out for his blood after the business with the explosions. He went quiet, which surprised me, and he was missing an eye to go with his broken horn.\n We were due some hardness, everyone knew that, and there were a couple-a folks held grudges against Coody for doing in the doc. But we held off against the scavenger beasts and the retaliatory raids by the last of doc\u2019s \u2018borgs, found ways to make do when his tech ran down and people started limping \u2018round town on malfunctioning limbs. I started wearing my Da\u2019s gun, when Coody asked me for help. He was running short of clones, now. There were men in doc\u2019s labs trying to fix the machines, but they weren\u2019t none as smart as him and it would take a while to get things running, if they ever did.\n Things are good, though, since the dragon came. Tougher, yes, but not so bad as they were. My Da used to tell me that people cope, that the war proved that more than anything. But they\u2019ll do more than cope, if you ask them too, if you show them there\u2019s another option. That they\u2019ll do the right thing, eventually, \u2018cause doing otherwise there ain\u2019t much to life. I\u2019m not saying he were right, mind, but he saw a lot of what might happen. He was a smart man, Da, and he were better at lookin\u2019 forward than me.\n But that was him, and he did his part. Now there\u2019s me and Coody and a bunch of broken parts, a town that needs savin\u2019 and a future stretchin\u2019 forward. And maybe I get to make it to the end I\u2019m meant to have, and maybe I get sidetracked a little along the way. It doesn\u2019t seem so bad, not knowing, not like it used too.\n And Da always used to tell me there were worse things than dying young.\n Originally published in Eclipse Four, edited by Jonathan Strahan, 2011."}

That\u2019s barely a beginning. A brightly lit all-night restaurant stands across the street, promising broiled-this and boiled-that. Chasing the next feast, I shuffle to the elevator, dropping four floors before staggering into the hallway. That\u2019s where the woman is. She\u2019s standing in my path, and beside her, sniffing the world, is this busy little sheltie dog.\n The dog is what trips me. I don\u2019t see it and suddenly I\u2019m falling, somebody saying, \u201cBad bad,\u201d and then I\u2019m lying limp on the floor.\n \u201cSorry bad sorry,\u201d her dog says.\n More and more animals are wearing AIs. That\u2019s some of the current news that found me during breakfast.\n \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d the woman asks.\n That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to decide. It wasn\u2019t a huge fall, and thankfully my major bones are off-limits. Like the heart and liver, key portions of my skeleton are kept sound during the long fast.\n \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I venture.\n But she isn\u2019t paying attention to me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n \u201cI sorry feel guilty,\u201d the dog says. Not with its mouth, but from somewhere on its broad metal collar. \u201cGuilty sorry bad.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d the woman says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\n Okay. Now I understand.\n The woman finally looks at me. At a moment like this, most people would make tender sounds. But she\u2019s not one of those people, snapping like a gym coach. \u201cCan you stand up?\u201d\n Gym coaches intimidate me. I sit up too soon, and the world spins.\n \u201cDo I need to call somebody?\u201d she asks. Plainly wanting me to say, \u201cNo.\u201d\n I shake my head, making the vertigo worse.\n \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d\n \u201cHere,\u201d I mutter.\n Narrow-faced and pretty. Both of my companions can be described that way. The dog smells my hands. The woman stares at my face. At my sharp cheeks, the sunken eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you before,\u201d she warns, full of suspicion.\n I could tell her the truth. Which impresses and offends almost everybody. But I want to avoid long conversations. So I say, \u201cI travel for work.\u201d\n \u201cReally,\u201d she says. The way people do when they don\u2019t believe what they\u2019ve been told. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re sick.\u201d\n \u201cI had a bug,\u201d I lie.\n \u201cCancer, judging by appearances.\u201d Turning to her dog, she asks, \u201cDo you recognize the man?\u201d\n That dark, bright, and very wet nose works its way down my leg. \u201cOld old stinks in elevator, in floor,\u201d says the expert. It sounds like a six-year-old talking. Maybe a boy\u2019s voice, maybe not.\n This isn\u2019t helping. I\u2019m an innocent man, starving but being interrogated by nobodies. Fighting to stand, I tell them, \u201cI have somewhere to be.\u201d\n The woman hears a terminally ill patient. And crabby as can be, she says, \u201cI suppose you need a ride to the hospital.\u201d\n \u201cNo, I\u2019m just crossing the street,\u201d I say.\n She says nothing.\n \u201cTo eat,\u201d I explain.\n And she smiles, glad for that answer. This is where everything should end, and now both of us are satisfied.\n Except the dog has a different opinion. \u201cGlory cooks,\u201d it says.\n \u201cNo,\u201d the woman says.\n The dog says, \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cShut up.\u201d\n The dog looks at me. \u201cGlory cooks big dinners.\u201d\n \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d the narrow-faced woman says.\n Whose name is Glory, I realize.\n \u201cMeat and cheese,\u201d the dog suggests.\n Actually, that sounds wonderful.\n \u201cShut up, you,\u201d says Glory.\n Sounds wonderful, but life is small. I learned that lesson long ago, and I refuse to waste more of what little I have with these two. Skinny legs and skinnier arms push against the floor, then the wall. Standing again, ignoring the rolling of the floor, and with more energy than I\u2019d have guessed possible, I break into a quick saunter.\n \u201cHe goes,\u201d says the dog.\n \u201cHe wants to leave,\u201d she says. \u201cLet him leave.\u201d\n \u201cWe are bad.\u201d\n The dog sounds miserable.\n \u201cWe are not bad,\u201d Glory says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re being exceptionally silly.\u201d\n My building\u2019s security door recognizes my starved face, opens, and then locks behind me, and I can\u2019t hear the others anymore. I survive the hike across the street and order three meals, eating every sugar packet while I\u2019m waiting. Strangers are talking. They look at me and they ignored me. I look at them, measuring all those intangibles that imply happiness and despair. Despite assumptions, I enjoy human company. I like new faces and voices and how smoothly busy each person seems to be, occupying his little life. The first meal arrives, genuine pancakes and cultured sausage. Feasting, I admit to myself that this is the worst up-time so far. Obviously, I reached too far. More reasonable goals are needed. That\u2019s the lesson here. Life is tiny but full of huge choices, and I make a few of those before the Reuben sandwich arrives.\n Three meals total and then a big dessert, and while eating an entire apple pie, I use my ancient phone to call the usual service.\n The limousine is parked outside, waiting for me. Grocery shopping used to be a chore for me, but starvation changes a person. The long aisles are an absolute joy tonight, each one filled with treasures, and despite being weaker than ever, I have such fun loading my groceries into the carts and pushing each cart out to my ride, then ordering the limousine to pull around the back of my building.\n I want to avoid the woman. Her dog seems fine, but she isn\u2019t. I load my feasts into the freight elevator, taking everything back into a kitchen that will be very busy for the next ten days.\n Eat, nap, and eat again. When this began, I assumed that I\u2019d be spending my active days mastering current events and culture. But I never do. Why learn about fads that will just pass away? Endless meals; that\u2019s my life. And injections, and the essential pills. I also VR with my doctor and other experts, tweaking the next stage of this constantly evolving business. Which means a fresh crop of pills and protocols as well as software updates.\n Ten days of feasting become twenty. Everyone, including me, agrees that I need to be fatter than ever.\n Leaving my condo serves no purpose, so I don\u2019t. The final stage, the polishing, is especially arduous. A huge quantity of Soylent has to wash down cans of cultured blubber, and then comes a spectacular purging of the bowels before bed. Which isn\u2019t a bed, of course. And I\u2019m not going to sleep. But passing out of consciousness, I\u2019m able to guide my dream-like thoughts. My cold body is flying naked to the moon. Space is cold like me but the sun is hot and the rocky dead moon of my youth floats green before me. I feel myself growing warm and happy, and just as I\u2019m about to touch down in the new forest, injections wake me. Bright light washes over my naked shriveled body, and the usual sick shivering commences, my metabolism trying to remember how to do its job.\n I wake up starving. My old phone has updated its guts and mind in my absence. Sugar and injections and Soylent and more injections. That\u2019s what happens first. Then my head clears, and I\u2019m sitting in my kitchen, waiting for ten pot pies to cook. Only then do I risk looking at the news. The world seems healthy enough, thank goodness. But on the other hand, the moon is as barren as always.\n I don\u2019t want to linger in this boring, pedestrian world.\n Stronger than last time, I step outside to find fresh air and food. To look at all of the faces in the restaurant. I never see the woman, but I can\u2019t stop watching for her and her generous dog. Then full of meat and cheese, I climb into the waiting limousine and go shopping before coming home again, ready to eat like a shrew.\n I\u2019m on my floor, stepping out of the freight elevator, when the woman ambushes me.\n Quite a lot has changed in twenty-six months.\n She says, \u201cHi,\u201d and smiles. In a big way, smiles.\n I say, \u201cHello.\u201d\n With a mocking tone, she asks, \u201cSo where do you go on these travels?\u201d\n \u201cWonderful places,\u201d I tell her.\n Her sheltie sits behind her. \u201cLeave the man alone,\u201d says the dog. The collar is thinner, the voice fuller, older and far more mature.\n The AI has been improved, I assume.\n \u201cSo I know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d says the woman. Says Glory. Her voice is so quick that the words crowd close together. \u201cIt was what? Ten, twelve years ago when hibernation became possible? Suspending the aging process and all that. I read about it and thought it sounded neat but not for me. And then later, what did I hear? That everybody who went into the program quit after the first sleep or two.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not sleeping,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not for just anybody either.\u201d\n \u201cWell, I know that.\u201d\n She knows quite a lot, I\u2019m thinking. At least she believes that she does.\n \u201cGlory,\u201d the dog says.\n Glory ignores her companion. \u201cHow many times have you gone under?\u201d she asks me.\n Six times, and that\u2019s none of her business.\n \u201cTo do nothing but sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cHibernate, I mean. That has to cost a lot of money. So you must be very, very rich.\u201d\n Here we go, I\u2019m thinking.\n And I\u2019m not the only one to see troubles looming. \u201cLeave our neighbor alone,\u201d says the dog.\n \u201cAnd he is our neighbor,\u201d she says smugly. \u201cMr. Artemus Tenor lives directly above us. In 4C.\u201d\n I need a distraction. For the first time in my life, I throw a question at a dog and expect an answer. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n \u201cSalvation,\u201d the sheltie tells me.\n \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cNot that I got to pick,\u201d he complains.\n And Salvation is a \u201che.\u201d I take the trouble to look this time.\n Glory says, \u201cWhen we saw you that other time, when you kicked my friend\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI tripped,\u201d I say.\n \u201cBefore I realized who you were,\u201d Glory continues. \u201cHe and I had just moved into this building. So of course I didn\u2019t know what you were doing. But honestly, you looked like you were trouble.\u201d\n \u201cIn trouble,\u201d her roommate suggests. \u201cIn trouble.\u201d\n \u201cOh, don\u2019t be that way.\u201d She says that to him but doesn\u2019t stop staring at me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for two eyes to focus any harder. The woman has done research, I\u2019m guessing. She knows about the trust funds, the lack of family. For all I know, she also found the manifesto published when I was twenty. On Facebook and eternal because of that. \u201cI want to live in an age of easy interplanetary flight.\u201d That\u2019s what I wrote then, and I believe it now. \u201cThe solar system will be terraformed, and I can live as the ultimate tourist.\u201d\n This is fourteen years later. Although my appearance and DNA imply that I\u2019m barely mature enough to buy drink or weed.\n \u201cI really need to get home,\u201d I tell my neighbor.\n \u201cLet the man eat,\u201d Salvation says.\n The intense smile vanishes, replaced by a fierce dose of something much, much worse.\n Glory says, \u201cI have a sense about people.\u201d\n Words that cause any sensible person to step back.\n \u201cYou and I are very much alike,\u201d she promises.\n \u201cGlory,\u201d her dog says, sounding sad. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this.\u201d\n \u201cThe two of us are dreamers,\u201d she assures me. \u201cAnd dreamers deserve to be with one another.\u201d\n Salvation runs between us. Which is welcome, at least on my part. The boy is twenty pounds of sleek fur, but I have a comrade here.\n I hope he shouts her down.\n Or nips her on the calf.\n But no. Those dog eyes look up at me. \u201cGo home and eat,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd while you eat, study this world carefully. Will you please? Learn how we treat our self-absorbed, sociopathic citizens. Not that I can share anything specific. There are privacy laws and professional standards, after all.\u201d\n With that, Glory becomes angry. During my brief life, I\u2019ve never seen anyone leap from loving to furious this quickly.\n \u201cShit, stop that,\u201d she warns, fists swinging at the air. \u201cYou have no fucking right, you little brat.\u201d\n \u201cHit me,\u201d says the dog. \u201cThen we can stop pretending that this treatment is succeeding.\u201d\n \u201cI should kick you,\u201d she agrees.\n He turns sideways. \u201cHave at it, honey.\u201d\n Balancing sacks of groceries, I shuffle towards my apartment.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d I shout to the dog.\n Who apparently isn\u2019t a dog at all. Is he?\n I go down and then come up again, forty pounds lighter and moving on tiptoes. Cooking and eating without making any sound. That\u2019s my goal. I don\u2019t want to alert my downstairs neighbor to my presence. Drinking cold oyster stew, I read the latest news from space. Which is good news, for a change. A consortium of tech companies and emancipated AIs are planning the conquest of Venus. That\u2019s the way they describe their venture. A \u201cconquest.\u201d Mars has its own life, microbial but complicated, which is why the UN has declared the world permanently off-limits to earthly settlements. But new technologies have made it possible to pave Venus with bubble cities and artful clouds, and the invasion will cost only a tenth of our wealth and half a century of unrelenting focus.\n The oyster stew is gone, and now I\u2019m a firm believer in Venus.\n Two in the morning is when I finally leave home. But someone anticipated that cleverness. Someone left a note stuck to my door. \u201cCome downstairs when you have the chance,\u201d the slim lady hand has written on paper yellowed with age. \u201cPlease,\u201d she added below. Then, \u201cGlory and Salvation,\u201d with her name underlined a self-obsessive twice.\n No restaurant tonight. I want to shop quickly and get home, and it helps that robots have conquered the grocery industry. By dawn, I\u2019m back inside my condo. Eating and eating, and finally, happily, using my toilet again. But the plumbing makes too much noise, or maybe my neighbor is even more compulsive than I realized. Either way, she knocks at my door. She doesn\u2019t knock every hour, but it feels that often. Day or night, it doesn\u2019t matter, and when I am strong or especially angry, I take the trouble to study her through the security camera.\n Glory has grown older, which I expected. But the woman has changed in other ways too. She looks sorry and maybe a little desperate. She doesn\u2019t smile when she hits the door. Even looking up at the camera lens, she won\u2019t pretend to be what she isn\u2019t. \u201cBe a man and talk to me,\u201d says that increasingly severe face.\n Glory always stands alone in my hallway. Her therapist has been replaced or is at home, locked inside a kennel. Unless the dog has died. That final possibility works on me. But man or not, I never respond, not even to ask about Salvation, and after getting fat and drinking a small of pond of Soylent, I check my locks and alarms before going down again.\n Thinking of Venus this time. But not bubble cities or invented clouds. No, my Venus is a realm of acid and fire, and I have the wings of a golden phoenix.\n And with that, I\u2019m awake again, after a fashion.\n Someone is inside my room, standing beside me. Glory is. She says, \u201cLook how skinny you are. How can you do this to yourself?\u201d\n It\u2019s too soon to talk. I can\u2019t even move my mouth. But I see the bedroom door standing open, and beyond that, my apartment door too. The locks have been beaten, and the alarms, and as soon as I\u2019m strong enough, I intend to become very scared.\n \u201cYou were so pathetic,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I met you. You were this sickly, desperate looking creature. Then I realized that you were hibernating.\u201d\n I don\u2019t hibernate. We\u2019ve talked about this. What I do isn\u2019t sleep or any other process found in nature.\n \u201cHow stupid,\u201d she says.\n I close my eyes.\n Out of the darkness, her voice asks, \u201cWhat if the world ends while you\u2019re down?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re dead anyway,\u201d I manage.\n She makes a disagreeable sound.\n I focus on my deep breathing.\n \u201cEventually I got greedy,\u201d she continues. \u201cI realized that you\u2019re rich and spoiled and crazy, and I wondered if maybe I could get something out of you.\u201d\n I open my eyes, too frightened to make any sound, and this crazy woman is standing over me. \u201cWe\u2019re dead anyway,\u201d might be my last words.\n But Glory doesn\u2019t kill me. Not for the next few moments. Both of us remain quiet, waiting for my sugar injections to help. Then very slowly, carefully, I sit up. She doesn\u2019t try to help me. I\u2019m thankful for that, and I\u2019m angry at her too. Both ways. Then my left hand falls off what isn\u2019t a bed, and something wet touches my fingers. That\u2019s when I discover a middle-aged sheltie watching me.\n The dog says nothing. He isn\u2019t wearing a collar or anything else mechanical. Salvation might as well be dead, not having a voice anymore.\n \u201cThere\u2019s two ways of living,\u201d Glory says.\n \u201cJust two?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cThat\u2019s how simple things are,\u201d she tells me. Then she decides that she\u2019s said enough and falls silent.\n I grab my phone from its cradle. \u201cI\u2019m calling the police,\u201d I announce.\n Glory has a brave face when she wants. Just from the way she stands there, she\u2019s ready for almost anything. \u201cYou can\u2019t scare me,\u201d says her body, her eyes. \u201cDo your worst.\u201d\n My worst is this:\n \u201cI\u2019ll press charges against you for breaking in, and I intend to have you thrown in prison. It won\u2019t take many years for you to become an old woman. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll come see you. Before I fly off to Venus, and I\u2019ll still be young man. How\u2019s that going to make you feel?\u201d\n Courage melts. Glory sobs.\n Her dog sniffs at the carpet, at my hand. Nothing in those dark eyes gives any sign of intelligence.\n I want to shove him away. But I don\u2019t.\n \u201cNot prison,\u201d she mutters.\n I throw my legs towards the floor.\n Her skinny hands hold each other, and she watches me.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a grocery list on my phone,\u201d I finally tell her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pull the list and buy everything for me. You\u2019ll pay for the food yourself, and you\u2019ll bring everything back here and fix any locks you broke, and I won\u2019t press charges. Probably.\u201d\n She nods and then smiles, liking some part of this.\n \u201cHurry,\u201d is my advice.\n She puts the grocery on her palm. Which is where modern phones live, it seems. Inside your hand. Then she pulls a short leash from a pocket. A flick of the phone hand causes the leash to wrap around the skinny dog neck, tying itself, and then the woman starts to tug, half-strangling the sheltie as she walks and he fights the tugging.\n \u201cNo,\u201d I say.\n She hesitates.\n \u201cLeave the dog with me.\u201d\n The smile stiffens, and she glances down at the sheltie.\n \u201cGo on,\u201d I say.\n Glory looks back at me. She says, \u201cGoodbye,\u201d and I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s not her words, but it\u2019s the tone. Bittersweet, complicated. I\u2019d ask but I don\u2019t want to dwell on this woman\u2019s peculiar moods. I\u2019m so deep into starvation that I can\u2019t think about anything but the ten thousand calories waiting in my kitchen.\n \u201cAnd shut the door on the way out,\u201d I warn her.\n The front door closes almost too softly to make sound.\n Ignoring me and ignoring the dropped leash, the dog spends a few moments idly sniffing at the floor, at an empty pill jar, and then, forgetting me completely, wanders into the other rooms.\n I follow when I\u2019m strong enough.\n Oyster stew is a joy, and every bowl of ice cream is slathered in fudge. I eat everything that\u2019s worth eating, and I have a little too much Soylent. I feel gassy. I feel old. The dog watches me now and again, and I finally talk. Just to test him. But he doesn\u2019t show any inkling of comprehension, much less the talent to respond.\n One long trip to the bathroom, and now I\u2019m out of food.\n Glory still hasn\u2019t returned.\n I look at the dog, stare at my phone. Then stepping to the window, I ask the outdoors, \u201cWhere is that bitch?\u201d\n \u201cMost likely on her way home,\u201d says the dog.\n I can\u2019t tell where that voice comes from. From inside his mouth, maybe.\n \u201cYou mean downstairs,\u201d I suggest.\n Salvation shakes his head, which is strange to see from any dog.\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n \u201cGlory moved away,\u201d he says. \u201cEleven months ago, she found a new home and job. In a completely different city.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s not coming back to get you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not hers to \u2018get,\u2019\u201d he says, the voice prickly and proud. \u201cI\u2019m a fully emancipated entity, Mr. Tenor.\u201d\n I stare at him.\n He does nothing.\n \u201cLeave me,\u201d I say.\n He sits.\n I walk to the apartment door and open it. \u201cYou seem smart. Get out of here now, and leave me alone.\u201d\n \u201cYou know, there are two ways of living,\u201d the dog says.\n \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d I offer.\n \u201cYou can live inside yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cAs an antisocial, self-absorbed fool.\u201d\n I look out into the empty hallway. I look back at him.\n \u201cOr what?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cHow the hell would I know?\u201d he says.\n Then he laughs at me. With his mouth, his eyes. Everything about him is laughing, and I can\u2019t describe what that does to a man.\n Robert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

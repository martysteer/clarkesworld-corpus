Is the timing right for the new generation?\n Am I doing what\u2019s best for the family, or are we all going to die when the K\u025ckave\u0259 swarm up Greenhill with their oyster-shucking knives to cut the throats of our dogs?\n Being Child is easy.\n But as the current Tower keeps telling me, that\u2019s not a good enough reason to stay Child. It has to be because my family, the Hapkui, needs me to be taller.\n I slouch beside the entrance to Greenhill, pulling on my wading boots. They\u2019re made from foodbeast leather and even in the dim glow of the smallest moons, you can see where the annoying puppies have chewed the sinew stitching.\n Luckily, the pups are locked in the den and can\u2019t betray me with their yipping.\n I\u2019m sneaking out to meet my best friend, Fe\u0259, the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child.\n The K\u025ckave\u0259 might be the mortal enemies of the Hapkui, but their territory includes Oyster Flats.\n And, God\u2019s Eye in Her Head, I cannot resist oysters.\n All I want to do is eat oysters and forget about childhood maybe being over.\n Fe\u0259 will understand. She\u2019s the same age as me. I know because when I was eight years old, and my digging claws were slow to grow, Tower took me to see the grave of her favorite dog, Mouther.\n Tower told me the story of Mouther.\n Tower, who never talks to me, or at least not kindly.\n Mouther, Tower said, had been a smart, loyal dog who was strict with the foodbeasts. But on the morning of my birth, while the whole family had been busy in the birthing room, some of the foodbeasts escaped from their pens. They trespassed on K\u025ckave\u0259 land.\n Mouther and the other dogs tried to herd the foodbeasts back to Greenhill, but the K\u025ckave\u0259 killed both dogs and foodbeasts. They threw the dogs\u2019 corpses over the border, but kept the meat from the beasts. That\u2019s why I had a slow start in life. That\u2019s why my claws were yet to grow.\n Tower admitted the K\u025ckave\u0259 were being paranoid and overprotective because their new Child was due, too.\n I wondered if the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child had her claws yet. I wanted to see what she looked like. In my imagination, she was doglike, with fangs and hair. I didn\u2019t have wading boots, then, so I ran barefoot through the razor grass at the edge of the swamp and cut my soles to shreds. Before I could find the entrance to any tunnels, she found me swearing and crying in the fork of a tree, trying to keep flies from sucking my blood.\n Fe\u0259 had been shocked to see my hairless face and lack of fangs.\n We looked almost identical.\n After that first meeting, Fe\u0259 asked her Tower careful questions about what other families looked like. I didn\u2019t dare ask mine. She relayed to me that in the cities, people give birth to litters, like dogs and foodbeasts. Not like in the territories, where Tower gives birth to Child, Child gives birth to new Child, old Child becomes Tower, and so on.\n Fe\u0259 said both of our lineages had come from the Foothill City, Kashwh\u025cr.\n If we went there, she whispered, we might discover we were both the same family, once.\n Her digging claws had grown in, though, and mine hadn\u2019t.\n They looked funny, Fe\u0259\u2019s huge Tower-sized claws on her tiny Child hands. So, instead of feeling jealous, I laughed cruelly at them. She threw mud at me. Then, when the mud went in my eye and I cried, she washed it out with stinging, salty water. She brought me oysters to eat and sent me back to the border before our families found out we\u2019d spoken.\n Now I\u2019m twelve. I\u2019ve got big hands to match my big claws, and my boots have foodbeast hooves glued onto the bottom so if anyone sees the prints, they won\u2019t know it was me.\n It wasn\u2019t me, stealing the puppy with one black ear to show Fe\u0259.\n It wasn\u2019t Fe\u0259, stealing oysters for me.\n It wasn\u2019t me, eavesdropping on the K\u025ckave\u0259 Storyteller, drinking in her words, imagining the crowded streets of Kashwh\u025cr and memorizing stolen rhymes.\n It wasn\u2019t Fe\u0259, ruining my furs with her mud flinging, convincing me against my better judgment to learn to swim, showing me how much easier it was to float in saltwater than fresh.\n Running, imagining the taste of oysters, I almost crash into Ancient, who squats with her skirts up at the edge of Greenhill\u2019s manure pit. Her white hair shines in the moonlight and she grunts like a birthing foodbeast.\n Will I grunt like that, when I give birth?\n Ancient gave birth more years ago than I can count. Once you have your Child, you can\u2019t have another, and you can\u2019t grow any taller. Ancient probably can\u2019t even remember what giving birth was like. Everything seems harder when you\u2019re Ancient, poop included.\n I hide behind a bush until she finishes her squat. She wanders, skirts still gathered, to the path of the spring where its waters flow down Greenhill. I stay silent until she\u2019s finished slapping cold water at her bum. I wait until she lets her skirts fall and starts her slow amble back up the slope.\n There\u2019s no need to ask if I\u2019ll look like that when I\u2019m Ancient. Fe\u0259 might be almost identical to me, but my ancestors and I are completely identical. By the time I\u2019m Ancient, my name will be forgotten, just as this Ancient\u2019s name is forgotten. The family\u2019s Child will know me only as Ancient.\n Fe\u0259 calls me by my name.\n \u201cWipwai,\u201d she says gloomily from the shadow of the meeting tree. \u201cLook at this.\u201d\n It\u2019s too dark. \u201cFe\u0259,\u201d I say, \u201call I see are silver puddles.\u201d\n She steps out, standing side-on to me, and her shape is all wrong. Instead of going straight down from her chest to her feet, there\u2019s a bulge.\n \u201cWhat is that? Are you sick?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a belly.\u201d She tugs at my layers of fur and leather. \u201cYou have one, too.\u201d\n It\u2019s colder on Greenhill than at Oyster Flats, and the Hapkui wear foodbeast skins as a mark of wealth and pride. Not like the K\u025ckave\u0259, who wear strings of pearls and cockleshells. I was taught this was nakedness and ignorance, before Fe\u0259 insisted it was fearlessness and invulnerability.\n Even before she finishes stripping me down, I feel the queasy realization that my balance has been off for weeks because of this thickening. Wearing only my boots, I stand self conscious in the mud in the moonlight with razor grass all around.\n \u201cFoodbeasts get bellies,\u201d I say, on the verge of tears. \u201cDogs get bellies. Are we Towers already? Did we choose without knowing? Why doesn\u2019t my Tower have a belly?\u201d\n \u201cBecause she gave birth to you,\u201d Fe\u0259 says. \u201cMy Tower doesn\u2019t have one either. It just means we can be Towers if we want, Wipwai. After we give birth, our bellies go away.\u201d\n \u201cI want it to go away right now,\u201d I say fiercely, but I haven\u2019t thought it through. Before I can, Fe\u0259 grips my palms and says, beaming,\n \u201cYes, I am going to stop growing, too. It\u2019s the best thing for my family. We don\u2019t need to be tall. There\u2019s no foodbeast herd to protect, no predators to watch for, only oysters.\u201d\n \u201cOysters,\u201d I repeat forlornly. I need them. I came here to forget my responsibilities but she\u2019s talking too fast.\n \u201cOysters don\u2019t run away,\u201d she continues. \u201cThe K\u025ckave\u0259 don\u2019t need long legs, we just need as many hands as possible, on account of our lands being so large. Fitting ten generations into a lifetime makes more sense for us than five, and this way you and I will rule as Towers together, we can speak openly\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not ready to be Tower,\u201d I interrupt, pulling my hands away from hers. \u201cI\u2019m still a Child!\u201d\n My blood bounds.\n Children talking together is transgression enough. Towers talking together? Unheard of. And there\u2019s no escaping the brutal facts.\n She\u2019s the next K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower. The next ruler over my enemies.\n A K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower gave the command to kill Hapkui foodbeasts and dogs, the morning I was born. A K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower left us defenseless against predators on the day of our greatest vulnerability.\n Because a Tower births only once.\n A family has one Child.\n If Child dies, the lineage is ended. The survivors, or the victors if there are no survivors, send news to officials of Kashwh\u025cr. Those officials send a new family to care for the vacant territory.\n Fe\u0259 looks confused.\n \u201cBut you just said\u2014\u201d\n \u201cFe\u0259, don\u2019t you understand? Once we become Towers, we can\u2019t talk anymore. Hapkui cut throats as punishment for betraying the family. They can\u2019t cut the throat of their Child, that would be the lineage\u2019s end, but they can kill a Tower for treason. Especially one who isn\u2019t very good with a knife.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed about not liking to bleed foodbeasts!\u201d Fe\u0259 exclaims.\n \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed!\u201d I bleat, giving the lie to it.\n \u201cBut you should be,\u201d comes a sinister whisper from the shadows.\n I recognize my Tower\u2019s cold sibilance.\n \u201cRun, Fe\u0259!\u201d I shout, first, before remembering the Hapkui Tower has almost double Fe\u0259\u2019s length in stride. \u201cTo the water, and swim!\u201d Fe\u0259 splashes into a wide pond, somewhere a few steps distant, my furs and leathers heaped behind her like shed skin left by a viper.\n Tower cannot swim.\n She cuts. She commands.\n I can\u2019t let her kill my best friend, even though Fe\u0259\u2019s death will become my aim, when I am Tower.\n Tower cuffs me and I fall in the razor grass.\n \u201cPut your clothes on, fool,\u201d she hisses. \u201cYou could have ended us!\u201d\n My clammy tunic and cloak are on backward when Tower throws me over her shoulder and begins loping for home. She\u2019s tireless. I lie limp and let the tears fall. I should have been more loyal to my family. I should have been more loyal to Fe\u0259. I should have eaten oysters, but now I\u2019ll never get any.\n When we reach the border, Tower\u2019s new favorite dogs, Biter and Fighter, fall in at her side.\n \u201cThe dogs stay with you, now and forever,\u201d she commands. \u201cIf you try to leave Greenhill, they will bring you back, the same way they bring the foodbeasts back. Do you hear me, Child?\u201d\n \u201cYes, Tower,\u201d I snivel, even as I inwardly rebel. I\u2019ll get good with a knife. So good, no mangy dogs will be able to stop me! Or, I\u2019ll start growing a Child. Before the year\u2019s out, I\u2019ll become Tower, and Tower will become Worker, and I\u2019ll boss her around, and make dogs guard her, too!\n But I don\u2019t know how to train dogs.\n I\u2019m not good with a knife.\n I\u2019m Child, and my family needs me to be taller. They need me to be as tall as Tower, who was a threat to Fe\u0259.\n They need me to be taller than Fe\u0259.\n So she can never be a threat to me.\n Before the year\u2019s out, Fe\u0259 gives birth to Child, and becomes Tower.\n I know, because Tower and Worker unveil a secret dog pack Worker has been training to sniff out Fe\u0259 and rip her to shreds. Our Worker can\u2019t speak. She accidentally bit off her tongue in a K\u025ckave\u0259 attack when she was Child. But Worker survived, and the dogs will be her revenge.\n The dog pack pours out of the underground training ring, thirty strong. The smell of dog milk, moldy soil, and old blood follows. Worker must have butchered many, many foodbeasts to feed a pack this size.\n They are thin.\n Scarred.\n Hungry.\n \u201cHow can you be sure they\u2019ll only savage K\u025ckave\u0259\u2019s Child?\u201d Ancient asks nervously, kicking at any dogs that come too close to her.\n \u201cThirty dogs,\u201d Tower says, cutting her eyes at me. \u201cThirty meetings between our disobedient Child and theirs before I had enough scent to be sure.\u201d\n \u201cThese dogs will turn on us,\u201d Ancient insists. It\u2019s the role of the oldest in the family to always make the worst suggestion. To follow the darkest threads.\n \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d says Sun, letting the dogs lick crumbs from her fingers. Second oldest, it\u2019s her role to point out the positives. To brighten the home with optimism and warmth. \u201cWe should sell them at Prominence, before making them killers.\u201d\n \u201cI am sure,\u201d Tower tells Ancient. \u201cThey won\u2019t attack us.\u201d\n She whistles to the dogs, then opens the door.\n One by one, tufted tails streaming behind them, the dogs vanish into darkness.\n Normally, I\u2019m too afraid of Tower to question her to her face, but the thought of Fe\u0259 and her Child being pulled to pieces by dogs is too terrible for me to stay silent.\n \u201cWhy do we have to kill each other?\u201d I shout. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we be friends?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know why?\u201d Sun asks gently as Tower looms over me, ready to strike.\n \u201cNo,\u201d I answer Sun, cringing back from Tower. \u201cIf you kill Fe\u0259 and her Child, K\u025ckave\u0259 lands will go to a new family. A new enemy. So what?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true a new family will come to Oyster Flats if the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child dies tonight,\u201d Tower says. \u201cBut how do you think that new family will know where the borders are, between Greenhill and Oyster Flats?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s on a map?\u201d I guess.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no map!\u201d Tower snaps.\n \u201cThe borders move,\u201d Sun says.\n \u201cThey move?\u201d I repeat foolishly.\n \u201cThe borders will be where I say,\u201d Tower commands, brandishing a handful of razor grass stained with blood. My blood, from the first time I ran through razor grass and ended up crying in the meeting tree. \u201cThe tree where you met our K\u025ckave\u0259 enemy used to be part of our lands, not theirs. Sweetgrass grew there, not razor grass, and foodbeasts grazed it. Dogs guarded it.\u201d\n \u201cImpossible,\u201d I say, gaping. \u201cYou can\u2019t even see that tree from Greenhill. That\u2019s too large a country, impossible to protect!\u201d\n I snap my teeth shut when I realize what I\u2019m saying.\n \u201cExactly.\u201d Now Tower holds something else. The skin of a puppy with one black ear. She throws it at my feet. \u201cYou can learn, after all. That\u2019s good.\u201d\n It\u2019s the puppy I took to show Fe\u0259, who loves puppies. I don\u2019t love puppies, but I know you shouldn\u2019t kill them and skin them, just to have a scent to train your hunting dogs with. Hatred for Tower fills me, but I\u2019m helpless.\n In the morning, only one of Worker\u2019s thirty secret dogs comes back.\n It\u2019s blue around the muzzle, and its mouth is full of foam and rotten fish.\n \u201cPoison,\u201d Sun whispers. \u201cThey anticipated this.\u201d\n \u201cYou should\u2019ve sent knives in intelligent hands instead of easily tricked teeth,\u201d Ancient says.\n Tower stands tall, like a lightning-struck tree, throwing a long morning shadow over Greenhill, and says nothing. But I know what to say.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t send five knives against ten.\u201d\n The K\u025ckave\u0259 temporarily number eleven, if Fe\u0259\u2019s Child is born safe.\n If Fe\u0259 is the new Tower of the K\u025ckave\u0259.\n And I\u2019m ashamed, and relieved, to think of her, safe, outnumbering us.\n There\u2019s a revolution in Kashwh\u025cr two years later, though I don\u2019t know what that means.\n I hear about it in the Prominence marketplace, where families trade in the shade of awnings over pens for the foodbeasts and cages for the dogs. Other cages hold hens and hawks. Baskets hold oysters, fish, and eels. Gold changes hands, and foodbeasts are killed and cut on the spot, or pushed into wagons to be taken on the long road to Kashwh\u025cr, somewhere at the western horizon where tiny purple peaks meet the plain.\n Children aren\u2019t allowed at Prominence on trade days. It\u2019s too dangerous.\n But Tower\u2019s dogs, Biter and Fighter, haven\u2019t been trained to keep me away from the market. They only know to keep me away from Oyster Flat.\n I sit cross-legged under an overturned basket, peeping out the handle-holes, proud of my deviousness, until a person\u2019s bottom sits on the basket, trapping me.\n God\u2019s Eye in Her Head, it must be Tower. I\u2019m in big trouble.\n But the legs dangling over the edge of the basket are too short. Tower\u2019s muscular tree-legs would reach the ground and more.\n \u201cStop, Fe\u0259,\u201d I hiss. \u201cGet off my basket!\u201d\n She doesn\u2019t answer, and for a long, terrifying moment I think she has trapped me to put an end to my lineage. Tower was right. I\u2019m a fool, and the final Hapkui to prove it.\n \u201cYour dogs,\u201d she hisses. \u201cThey\u2019re so obvious!\u201d\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t you kill them?\u201d I ask hopefully.\n \u201cI should! They tried to kill me!\u201d\n \u201cNot these ones,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m cringing in shame. \u201cI told them not to send the dogs, Fe\u0259, but I\u2019m not Tower.\u201d\n \u201cI am.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d I can\u2019t be Tower yet, but maybe Fe\u0259 has some good hints.\n \u201cHard work. There\u2019s so much to learn, Wipwai. So many tiny details make a wall between me and what I have to know. I have to know the fresh water and the salt as intimately as if they\u2019re family. I\u2019m afraid my Instructor and my Storyteller will die before I learn all I need to be a good Tower.\u201d\n I grimace where Fe\u0259 can\u2019t see. My family doesn\u2019t have an Instructor, or a Storyteller. Those roles are a luxury a small family can\u2019t afford.\n \u201cDid your Instructor or your Storyteller tell you about the revolution?\u201d\n \u201cOh, yes,\u201d Fe\u0259 gushes. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d\n I hesitate.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d I say in a small voice. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d\n It\u2019s Fe\u0259\u2019s turn to hesitate.\n \u201cIt means we can\u2019t attack other families,\u201d she says at last. \u201cNot until we know what the new rulers in Kashwh\u025cr are like. What if they aren\u2019t like the old rulers? What if the rules have changed?\u201d\n \u201cWhat were the old rulers like?\u201d I ask, but daylight abruptly streams through the holes in the basket.\n Fe\u0259 is gone.\n Maybe she\u2019s telling the truth because she wants me to know I\u2019m safe from her.\n Maybe she wants me to let down my guard.\n I hate that she\u2019s Tower.\n And I think of her Child, growing up alone on Oyster Flat, with no other Child to talk to. I pat my belly but it\u2019s too soon. Yes, Fe\u0259 is allowed to walk around Prominence, trading, without having to hide under a stupid basket. Yes, she has a Storyteller and an Instructor to teach her. But I can learn from my Sun and my Ancient, and I\u2019ll do it before I become Tower, not after, so my decisions will be better than Fe\u0259\u2019s.\n God\u2019s Eye in Her Head, whether Fe\u0259 is trying to trick me or not, I will know Greenhill, its spring, the foodbeasts, and the dogs as intimately as if they are family, and I will be prepared for whatever the K\u025ckave\u0259 are planning, revolution or not.\n Biter and Fighter almost tip the basket over. Any second now, I really will get caught by Tower.\n Dogs are so annoying.\n At the next trade day, I watch the muddy road from the bushes, but Fe\u0259 doesn\u2019t come. Oyster Flat is flooded. Later, Sun speculates that all hands are needed to dig drainage, to save homes. To save the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child.\n Ancient guesses the Child is on a boat, floating out in the salt, safe from Hapkui dogs, but not safe from swimmers.\n Tower murmurs that the K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower once foolishly taught the Hapkui Child to swim.\n But as much as Tower wants Fe\u0259\u2019s lineage ended, she can\u2019t risk me on such a mission, because I am still Child myself.\n I hope fervently that Fe\u0259 and her Child aren\u2019t drowned. Not just because I miss the taste of oysters. Fe\u0259\u2019s Child will be too old to be friends with my Child, by the time my Child is born.\n Fe\u0259\u2019s grandchild, though, will be just the right age.\n \u201cOur people were diggers,\u201d Tower says, \u201cbefore they were farmers.\u201d\n We stand, eye to eye, our naked feet bathed by frigid spring waters. The stream pops and squeaks down the rocks, carrying earth and ritual oils from my freshly washed head toward the sea.\n Carrying the news of my ceremony to the K\u025ckave\u0259, if they only had the noses to scent it in the swamp. In the razor grass. On Oyster Flat.\n I can keep growing. Legends tell of childless giants, taller than trees.\n I can be taller than Tower, my nemesis. Though she says it\u2019s time for me to leave childhood behind, this is the one thing she can\u2019t command me to do.\n I\u2019ve waited so long I\u2019ve lost all urgency. Fe\u0259\u2019s elevation to Tower is twelve years gone. Her survival of the floods a whole decade past. I haven\u2019t seen Fe\u0259 since the day she sat on my basket in the market.\n Sun\u2019s my best friend, now, for her subtle kindnesses and her bright outlook despite seizing hips and aching teeth, but soon Ancient will die and Sun will become Ancient, forced to whisper poison and suggest horror by centuries of immutable tradition.\n This morning, my crown brushed the keystone of the entrance to the dog training tunnel. At its end, a dry moat of clay, caked with the blood of forgotten generations, surrounds an island of stone.\n I\u2019ve been training the biggest, blackest, wildest dog of all. Not the kind that has progeny, but a kind of dead end to life called male. He was named Darkness by the Kashwh\u025cr miners who bred him.\n Tower couldn\u2019t train Darkness. Neither whipping him nor starving him earned his respect. Tower doesn\u2019t know how I tamed him, and I\u2019ll never tell.\n The dog\u2019s secret is he pines for oysters just as much as I do.\n I told Worker I needed oysters to train Darkness to kill the K\u025ckave\u0259, so she traded for a string bag of them without telling Tower. The freshwater oysters were inferior in flavor and went rotten quickly, but Darkness liked them even better that way, and then we were friends. I\u2019ve never whipped him.\n I\u2019m not training him to kill K\u025ckave\u0259. Nor am I training him to kill Biter and Fighter; those senile sentries died of old age years ago. He\u2019s a miner\u2019s dog, with claws almost as big as mine, bred to rescue their Workers when earthquakes collapse the tunnels around them.\n Darkness is trained to sniff out oyster beds. To dig them out, break them up, and bring them to me. The moment I\u2019m Tower, I\u2019ll let him loose, and my family will think he\u2019s going to bring me back K\u025ckave\u0259 heads, and when he brings back a mouthful of oysters instead, I\u2019ll laugh \u2019til I cry. They\u2019ll be powerless to reprimand me, and I won\u2019t share the oysters with anyone except my dog.\n I\u2019m not as resigned to being responsible as I thought.\n That moment of transformation is coming.\n When I hit my head in the tunnel, disturbed soil rained on Mouther\u2019s grave, exposing the rootlets of the ring of fruit trees lightly crowning Greenhill.\n Now the dirt\u2019s washed away, dawn sunlight gilds the stream, and Tower lowers a heavy, eyeless stone helmet onto my head and shoulders.\n I can barely manage its weight. The darkness is terrifying. Soon, the air inside grows close and hot.\n \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d I gasp, putting my claws to the edges of it, but Tower slaps my hands away.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve all worn it,\u201d Sun says, rubbing my back between my shoulder blades. \u201cWe all lived.\u201d\n \u201cCast your mind back,\u201d Tower says, \u201cto a time when the trigger for the next generation was a Child too tall to fit in the tunnels. A bruised head and neck signaled the body to change. Bruises and stale air. Too many relatives crowded together, until they could barely breathe.\u201d\n \u201cMy head does touch the roof of the tunnel,\u201d I say. \u201cCan\u2019t we do it the old-fashioned way?\u201d\n \u201cThis is quicker,\u201d Tower says. I hear her footsteps splashing away, echoing inside the God-blinking helmet. I try to follow, but I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll fall face-first into the spring and be drowned by the life\u2019s blood of my family\u2019s lands.\n Sun takes my hand. Her breath is on my shoulder.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been a good Child, Wipwai,\u201d she whispers, leading me from the stream one shaky step at a time. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a better Tower than our last two. Listen carefully. When my own precious Child was born, I sacrificed a hundred foodbeasts to hire Kashwh\u025cr hands with knives to protect her from the K\u025ckave\u0259. She grew up spoiled and pampered, and when her childhood ended, she blamed her own Child for usurping her. In a rage, she threw that Child into the tunnels with the dogs. She endangered the family, leaving her Child to suckle from bitches and fight for raw foodbeast offal.\u201d\n My grip on Sun\u2019s hand tightens. I\u2019m shaking, and not from the weight of the cursed helmet. How can my trusted Sun be telling the truth about poor, silent Worker and cruel, cold Tower? I\u2019d like to exclaim, or question, but to be heard I\u2019d have to shout, and Tower might hear.\n \u201cWhat could we do?\u201d Sun continued. \u201cShe was Tower. Her commands were law. We could have killed her, but I\u2019d squandered the family\u2019s wealth on the guards and we would have been only four. Three, really, with a helpless newborn.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cMore, I had to hide the pain in my hips, which meant I could hardly walk. I was Worker, and I could barely work. If my offspring knew, she would have ordered me killed, and then who would have done the work? And if we killed her, who would have been Tower? I couldn\u2019t have walked to Prominence to trade. In the end, the jealous, neglectful mother had her tongue torn out by her own offspring, as soon as today\u2019s Tower ascended. Now Worker\u2019s half mad, and only takes pleasure in cutting foodbeast throats. Soon she\u2019ll take my place as Sun, but how will she speak sweetness with no tongue? And it\u2019s the Sun\u2019s task to prepare food for the family.\u201d\n My feet find the solid bank. I grope with my free hand toward the shade. The sunlight\u2019s too hot. I want the coolness of the tunnels, with the horrible helmet cooking me in my own sweat. Or is it the truth of Worker\u2019s silence making me sweat?\n \u201cThese words are a warning,\u201d Sun whispers. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken before, because it was my honorable task to surround you with light, but you were Child. You were safe. As Tower, you mustn\u2019t trust her. But you must already know that. Why else send Worker to buy the oysters for you? You wanted to remind her what kind of hell-beast you were training. Darkness will slay your enemies, guard your sleep, and sniff your food for poison.\u201d\n Darkness is no hell-beast and he\u2019s terrible at guarding. He looks fearsome but he falls asleep as soon as he\u2019s tired. All he can sniff for are oysters.\n I\u2019m starting to think I should have followed Worker\u2019s example and trained a pack of bloodthirsty killers, not a useless, dopey monster to feed my un-Hapkui-like appetites. Fe\u0259 told me the revolution meant the families had to treat one another peacefully, and since then we had, but what would the new government care about families fighting within themselves?\n No rulers would object to a family\u2019s Sun killing its Tower.\n That\u2019s when I realize I can attack the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child, if I want to. Sun\u2019s story about Worker leaving her Child to the dogs is key.\n All I\u2019d have to do is make it seem like neglect from within the K\u025ckave\u0259.\n Dogs couldn\u2019t enter into the equation.\n Drowning, however, always threatens those who live between freshwater and salt.\n \u201cHow long do I have to wear the helmet?\u201d I ask Sun, sprawling on my back on the hillside, giving up on finding the tunnels. If I cook to death, Tower will only have herself to blame.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll feel it,\u201d Sun says, her voice receding, \u201cbefore sunset.\u201d\n \u201cFeel what?\u201d\n There\u2019s no answer.\n God\u2019s Eye in Her Head.\n I wait a few hours before trying to get the helmet off, just for a break and maybe a sip of water, but Tower\u2019s dog-whip cuts my hand. Like a dog, I yelp and desist.\n Then, before sunset, I feel it. Heaviness in my belly. Fluid building there, as if I\u2019ve taken a thousand sips from the spring. Itchy thickness in my skin. Like it\u2019s solidifying.\n I\u2019m a stone statue, now.\n I\u2019ll never get any taller.\n My bones hurt.\n All of them.\n I shed enough tears inside my stupid heavy helmet that they run down my neck. A soft cloth wipes them away.\n \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Sun murmurs. All together, they lift my helmet off. Tower, Worker, Sun, and Ancient. All my family, singing softly together, as they did when I entered this world from between Tower\u2019s thighs. Worker can\u2019t sing, but she hums.\n In the den beneath Greenhill, Darkness and the other dogs start howling.\n When Child is born, there\u2019s no grunting.\n No effort.\n One evening, I\u2019m standing by the fire, accepting a bowl of grilled foodbeast and spiced greens from Sun. Ancient sits on the floor, already eating, and Worker washes blood and dirt from her face over a bucket in the corner.\n In a split second, I feel something inside like a bubble bursting in a bath, and Child slides out of me onto the straw-covered floor, slick as a fresh fish.\n \u201cGod\u2019s Eye in Her Head!\u201d I shriek.\n Sun scoops up the Child and pops her in the serving bowl on top of the greens.\n \u201cBlessings,\u201d she says, laughing.\n \u201cWasn\u2019t that supposed to be difficult?\u201d I\u2019m incredulous. All the stories about births I eavesdropped on in the K\u025ckave\u0259 tunnels spoke of blood and pain. Just like foodbeasts, who shudder and bellow. \u201cIs there something wrong with her?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with her,\u201d Sun coos, not even looking at me. \u201cSmall people struggle with birth. Not the Hapkui.\u201d\n I take Child and marvel at everything in miniature. No hair, no teeth, and a head disproportionate to her arms and legs, yet Child is unmistakably me.\n She is us. Warmth surges up into my face. Giddiness follows.\n I am smitten.\n \u201cShe needs a name,\u201d Sun says.\n \u201cA foolish custom,\u201d Tower says darkly, but I don\u2019t think her eyes are really seeing Child; instead, perhaps, she sees the end of her reign. Now that Child\u2019s arrived, all of us will move one link further along the chain.\n One step closer to death.\n Ancient will take her turn wearing the terrible helmet, and this time it really will kill. What must Ancient have thought while I wailed and flailed under the helmet? I take Child over to her.\n \u201cAncient,\u201d I say, ashamed, \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d\n \u201cMy name is Nayr,\u201d Ancient says, touching Child\u2019s tiny mouth with a gnarled knuckle, careful to keep her cracked claw from the smooth new skin. Child\u2019s eyes will not open for a month, but she squirms.\n \u201cMay I have your name for this Child?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cYes, Wipwai. You may.\u201d\n We all sing as Child suckles for the first time. Except for Worker, who hums. The song turns mournful while we lower the crushing stone helmet over Ancient\u2019s head, shutting out the last light of her life.\n I had planned to send Darkness to fetch oysters for me, as my first act as Tower, but instead I command him to sit and stay beside the salad bowl where baby Nayr sleeps, sated.\n Worker watches the monstrous black dog warily.\n \u201cI need to wash,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going to the spring. Stay here with Nayr.\u201d\n I leave the tunnels alone.\n The moons are as cold and distant as Tower.\n No. I am Tower.\n God\u2019s Eye in Her Head, I am commander of the Hapkui.\n Pulling my boots on, panicked, I begin to run, birth fluid flecking away with every step. My stride is enormous, my boot prints impossibly far apart. Sweetgrass-covered hillside, stream and razor grass fly past in a blur of bleating foodbeasts, swaying stalks, silver ripples and moon shadow.\n I run for hours. I\u2019m not tired.\n I\u2019m faster than a dog. I\u2019m as tall as Tower was, that day she tried to kill Fe\u0259.\n My boots leave wide-spaced prints, terrifying to the K\u025ckave\u0259, if they could see them, across the pale sand of Oyster Flat.\n If my Child is born, so is the Child of Fe\u0259\u2019s Child. Which means Fe\u0259 is no longer Tower, but Worker, and in a household with plenty of extra hands to care for the newborn, Worker will have been tending the oysters since the low tide of early evening, when the small moons are in the sky but the biggest moon stays below the horizon.\n My long strides begin to sink into the moonlit silt of the Flat. I smell rotten seaweed beneath the freshness of an approaching storm. White crabs scuttle away as I come to a halt at the edge of the water.\n The smiling curve of a reed boat is anchored to a sandbar offshore. It\u2019s too far for me to see the boat\u2019s occupant. I make a pile of my furs on top of my boots, and slide, naked and shivering, into the stinging surf.\n My swimming stroke is longer than it was.\n I\u2019m uncoordinated at first, and choke on the wavelets lapping at my face, but before long the rhythm returns to me.\n When I stand up on the cold sand of the bar, Fe\u0259 flinches from her crouch behind the boat. She\u2019s the same as she always was, except for the fresh oyster cuts on her hands.\n So tiny.\n Still a child.\n No. Only Worker must labor with the tides, ignoring such trivial matters as light and dark. Change is terrible and irresistible.\n \u201cWipwai?\u201d she whispers, straightening with a small bronze hatchet in her hands. \u201cIs it you? You\u2019re a giant. From the stories.\u201d\n \u201cThe tide\u2019s so low,\u201d I say, grinning. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this part exposed. Are there many good ones?\u201d\n Fe\u0259 pulls a huge chunk of oysters out of the sand. They\u2019re cemented together, the large living ones with the shells of the broken and dead. She hits the dead ones off with her hatchet and hands me the rest.\n \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she says, \u201con the birth of your Child.\u201d\n I\u2019m strong enough to break them open with my bare hands.\n God\u2019s Eye in Her Head. Nothing has ever tasted so sweet.\n \u201cI want them to be friends,\u201d I say loudly, moved by passion to raise the oysters over Fe\u0259\u2019s head, and she shrinks back slightly before she comprehends what I\u2019ve said. \u201cMy Child, whom I have named Nayr, must befriend your grandchild, Fe\u0259. I don\u2019t want my Child to be lonely, like I soon will be. Is it possible? Since I lost you, I\u2019ve had my Sun to be my friend, but she becomes Ancient tonight and the new Sun is mute.\u201d\n Fe\u0259 sighs.\n \u201cI\u2019m not the Tower now, Wipwai. It\u2019s for my Child, I mean the K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower, to decide.\u201d\n \u201cDid we ask our own Towers for permission, when we first met? Besides, I am Tower. I give permission to Nayr to have a friend. I give permission for your grandchild to have a puppy. You always liked dogs more than I did, Fe\u0259, but now I\u2019ve got a digging dog called Darkness. He\u2019d never harm a gnat, but he can find oysters. I want you to meet him at the next trade day.\u201d\n She sighs again.\n \u201cHelp me get the oysters picked. You\u2019ll be twice as fast as me. And Tower or not, the government\u2019s mandated peace is holding. I\u2019ll do as you ask. Listen, we met when we were eight. In eight years, let\u2019s agree to bring our families\u2019 respective Children to the tree.\u201d\n She turns back to the task, but I hesitate.\n \u201cWhat else, Fe\u0259? What else do I need to know, to keep Nayr safe from the world?\u201d\n The lines deepen in Fe\u0259\u2019s little face. Her eyes shine.\n They\u2019re wise. Not a child\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cBe kind to her, Wipwai. Be gentle. For what use is keeping the world from breaking her if you break her yourself?\u201d\n By the time I finish helping with the oysters, swim back to the shore, and run back to Greenhill, it\u2019s almost sunrise.\n I discover I\u2019m anxious about Child.\n Child is fine. Child is sleeping.\n But in my absence, mute Worker, who is now supposed to be Sun, has killed my dog, Darkness, and laid his corpse out for me like a carpet for my feet.\n \u201cHe was aggressive toward Child,\u201d Tower explains indifferently. \u201cWorker had no choice but to cut his throat. He was ill-trained.\u201d\n I glance at the container where Nayr slumbers. There are no dog footprints in the dirt. I feel empty, as though Darkness was an ember in my chest, now grown cold.\n Ancient\u2019s body, too, has grown cold.\n I hide my distress.\n The new Ancient, who was my friend Sun, crouches in a corner, pale-faced, saying nothing.\n \u201cShe\u2019s not Worker anymore,\u201d I say, pointing at the mad-eyed mute. \u201cShe\u2019s Sun. You are Worker. Come with me now, both of you. I have work for you.\u201d\n I lead the conspirators to the dog training tunnel, where the black stone stands in the middle of the dry moat.\n They can\u2019t kill me yet. They need me to feed Child for six months at least. We don\u2019t have any freshly whelped dog to give suckle. Only me.\n They can\u2019t kill me at all, ever. I won\u2019t let them.\n \u201cI hoped you had gone to kill the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child,\u201d newly-named Worker says, \u201cbut I should have known you would come back empty-handed.\u201d\n \u201cPeace,\u201d I answer, abruptly furious. \u201cThe city insists on peace. It\u2019s too late for killing. The borders are fixed.\u201d\n \u201cThey are not fixed,\u201d Worker shouts, but before she can argue more, I push her between the shoulder blades so she sprawls in the clay of the dry moat. The new power of being able to lay a hand on her surges through me, intoxicating. Is this why she bullied me for so long?\n I\u2019m sobered by the idea that I, or anyone, might lay a hand on Child.\n Be gentle, Fe\u0259 advised.\n \u201cDig through to the underground portion of the spring. You know where it lies. It\u2019s close by. Isn\u2019t that why our ancestors lined this room with clay?\u201d\n Sun draws her lips back from her teeth, as though a dog\u2019s spirit has possessed her.\n \u201cThe moat will flood,\u201d Worker objects, crawling to her feet to face me. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to train dogs here in secret again. Mouther\u2019s grave will be flooded.\u201d\n \u201cI want the moat to flood,\u201d I insist. \u201cThat is my command. Get started. I\u2019m going to feed Child.\u201d\n When I return, water from the spring enters the moat from the north. It\u2019s shallow. Barely ankle deep.\n \u201cDig the outflow here,\u201d I instruct, holding Child in the crook of my left elbow, marking the south cave wall with a slash of my right hand.\n \u201cThe moat will be deep,\u201d Worker observes sourly. \u201cThe water will be over our heads.\u201d\n Exactly.\n The black rock will be my safe sleeping place.\n Only I will be able to swim to it.\n \u201cIf it rains heavily,\u201d Ancient grumbles from the tunnel entrance, \u201cthe water level might rise higher than expected. Our new Tower might drown in her sleep. Child must not sleep in this dangerous room.\u201d\n I lock eyes with her, bereaved by this testing of her new role.\n The sun always sets, or so the K\u025ckave\u0259 Storyteller used to say.\n I force a smile.\n \u201cAncient is correct. Nayr will not sleep here. She\u2019ll stay with you, Ancient. Guard our future well.\u201d\n But the future never goes as planned.\n As Nayr approaches the final evening of her eighth year, our spring runs dry.\n There\u2019s nothing so horrifying as water one day, nothing the next.\n At first, I assume it\u2019s a plot by Worker and Sun, stopping up the inflow to see if I\u2019ll notice the water level\u2019s gone down.\n I notice.\n Everybody notices, with varying degrees of panic. Except for Child.\n Not wanting to look at the emptying moat, to think about what it means, I stride out of the tunnels and stand in the shade of the fruit trees on Greenhill, staring down the slope at the grazing foodbeasts and their long, odd, morning shadows.\n \u201cLift me up,\u201d Child says, reaching for the trees. \u201cI want fruit.\u201d\n She loves fruit as much as I ever loved oysters. I lift her, one-handed, above my head, and ignore the twigs and leaves that rain down with her harvest. Her claws haven\u2019t grown in yet, so there\u2019s no risk of impaling the fuzzy globes. When I lower her to the grass, she sits with her legs in a circle, corralling the fruit as if they were foodbeasts that might stray. Watching her eat with messy relish is soothing.\n But not for long.\n \u201cWe have days at best,\u201d Worker says crisply. \u201cOur sweetgrass will die without water. New sweetgrass must be planted at the edge of the swamp to keep the foodbeasts alive. You cannot delay. The K\u025ckave\u0259 Child must die today.\u201d\n Sometimes, I imagine the ghost of Sun speaking, before she became Ancient. I try to think of what positive thing she could possibly interject with in this instance.\n Perhaps she would have suggested carrying water from the river. It\u2019s polluted with excrement from Kashwh\u025cr. Yet even if it were clean, how could four people with buckets carry enough to keep all our wide grasslands watered?\n Impossible.\n Foodbeasts can\u2019t graze close to the river for fear of crocodiles. Crocodiles are the reason most Hapkui can\u2019t swim.\n I taught Child to swim, in secret. In our moat. I counted the sunrises, anticipating the moment when Hapkui Child and K\u025ckave\u0259 Child would meet, and now God has blinked, the spring is dry, and I must have the K\u025ckave\u0259 razor grass fields at the edge of the swamp, or else Child will perish with the rest of us.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve tried to kill me half a hundred times,\u201d I say, not even looking at Worker. \u201cYou and Sun. You\u2019ve both tried. I could have put you to death at any time, but I didn\u2019t, because we\u2019re too few. Four can\u2019t survive if the K\u025ckave\u0259 have ten. Yet you\u2019d have me plunge into their midst. One against ten, with no dogs, and only you two to protect Child should I fail.\u201d\n \u201cIf you fail,\u201d Worker snaps, \u201cChild won\u2019t need protection. Starvation will claim her!\u201d\n \u201cWhat about the peace?\u201d I demand. \u201cThe K\u025ckave\u0259 haven\u2019t attacked, even in reprisal, during my lifetime. It must be true, the ban on families feuding.\u201d\n \u201cAnd why should the K\u025ckave\u0259 feud? They have everything. We have nothing. Barely our own Greenhill, our own spring, and it\u2019s dried up. God\u2019s Eye is closed to us.\u201d\n Sun stands there, saying nothing.\n There should be brightness, but there\u2019s none, because Sun\u2019s own Child ordered her tongue torn out.\n And here comes Ancient at last, a wooden staff in each hand, using them both to walk because her hips can\u2019t hold her up. Dripping with blood and drool, because of her rotting teeth. If we had our old wealth, she could have gone to the city for a cure.\n \u201cAncient,\u201d I ask desperately, \u201cis there anything in our family stories about the spring running dry?\u201d\n \u201cNothing,\u201d she says. But how would she know? Our family has no Storyteller to carry its memories and myths. All we have is our terrible height, from which to see danger coming, but this danger was unforeseen. Ancient comes close to me, gripping my arm tightly, and Worker and Sun move away, because Ancient stinks, but her foul breath carries whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re not safe, Wipwai. You\u2019ll never be safe, and you can only eradicate the internal threat to your person after you have eradicated the external threat to Child, do you understand?\u201d\n I understand.\n No cutting Sun\u2019s throat until I\u2019ve cut the throat of the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child.\n But I\u2019ve always hated throat cutting. There must be another way.\n \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d I say grimly.\n \u201cTo Prominence?\u201d Worker insinuates I\u2019m off to buy oysters. I resist the urge to cuff her. I don\u2019t want Child to see family members hurting one another.\n \u201cAfter dark, I\u2019ll go. Pick these fruit and build a fire to dry them. Then cut as much of the grass as you can, to make hay for the foodbeasts while it\u2019s still green. Then slaughter the oldest or most unfit of the foodbeasts. One in three.\u201d\n \u201cAs you say, Tower.\u201d\n Fe\u0259 waits by the meeting tree with a Child achingly similar to mine.\n Although, the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child\u2019s head is a little flat on one side.\n \u201cIt\u2019s because of the long, crushing childbirth,\u201d Fe\u0259 explains. \u201cYou can bring your Child out of the shadows now. I\u2019ve told Ai\u0259 the Hapkui Child\u2019s name is Nayr, and that she doesn\u2019t have horns. Or a tail.\u201d\n I laugh, remembering.\n \u201cNayr has a round head,\u201d I say. \u201cChildbirth was easy. She just came out.\u201d\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re so big.\u201d\n Ai\u0259 looks up at me, silent and wide-eyed.\n \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause I\u2019m big.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s no way our Tower would have agreed to this, so I had to sneak Ai\u0259 out of the tunnels by an entrance I made when we were Children. Where\u2019s Nayr? Is she terrified? What horrific stories have your family told her about the K\u025ckave\u0259?\u201d\n I sigh.\n \u201cFe\u0259, I haven\u2019t brought Nayr. I have to talk to you.\u201d\n Fe\u0259\u2019s oyster-scarred hand twitches, as if she\u2019d like to gather Ai\u0259 closer to her. Instead, she waits for me to speak again.\n \u201cListen. Has the K\u025ckave\u0259 Storyteller ever told any stories about the spring on Greenhill going dry? Your memories are longer than ours, I know. You\u2019ve lived on Oyster Flat for much longer than we\u2019ve lived in Greenhill.\u201d\n I think, but don\u2019t say: You lied, and told us where the false boundary is found.\n \u201cOh, Wipwai. God\u2019s Eye in Her Head. Is your spring truly failing?\u201d\n I can\u2019t bear for her to pity me.\n \u201cThe stories, Fe\u0259,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cHave you heard any stories?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n All the air leaves my chest and I collapse against the tree.\n When my own family failed me, Fe\u0259 always had the answers.\n Now I don\u2019t know what to do.\n My claws sink into the soggy earth all around me. I clench my fingers, making fists of fertile soil.\n \u201cI need this land then,\u201d I say hoarsely. \u201cI need it to plant sweetgrass. It\u2019s the only way for our foodbeasts to survive.\u201d\n One moment, Fe\u0259 is by my side, soothingly tracing my brow. The next, she\u2019s several steps back from me, and I hear the sound of the Child, Ai\u0259, running through the razor grass and plunging into the same seeping freshwater pond that Fe\u0259 used to escape from Tower, twenty years ago.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t have it,\u201d Fe\u0259 says.\n \u201cNo?\u201d I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s sent Ai\u0259 fleeing to safety. I am not like Tower. I\u2019m here to talk.\n \u201cThis swamp is a nursery for tiny fish,\u201d Fe\u0259 says. \u201cThe fish grow up to join the shoals in the sea that the K\u025ckave\u0259 catch to eat when there are no oysters. Don\u2019t you remember the floods, my first year as Tower?\u201d\n \u201cI remember,\u201d I say stupidly.\n \u201cWithout those fish, we wouldn\u2019t have survived. We need this land.\u201d\n \u201cBut we\u2019ll starve, Fe\u0259.\u201d\n \u201cBetter the Hapkui starve than the K\u025ckave\u0259.\u201d I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing. My childhood friend couldn\u2019t have uttered such a thing. She shared oysters with me.\n \u201cIs that right?\u201d Somehow, I\u2019m looking down at her. Looming. \u201cYou\u2019re so tiny. How much food could you possibly need?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re so big,\u201d Fe\u0259 says softly. \u201cYou eat so much. We can\u2019t share our oysters with you anymore, Wipwai.\u201d\n My pulse races, but my muscles feel hard. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m wearing the stone helmet all over again. This time, though, it\u2019s not my skin turning to armor.\n It\u2019s my heart.\n I can\u2019t let my Child go hungry.\n And Fe\u0259 taught me how to find oysters for myself.\n Water.\n I\u2019m wet.\n I swim after the enemy K\u025ckave\u0259, my stroke longer and more powerful.\n \u201cCome back,\u201d I shout. \u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you. I\u2019m here to talk.\u201d\n But the K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower might be more inclined to listen if I\u2019ve got their Child in hand. I can\u2019t take Fe\u0259\u2019s grandchild to Greenhill. I can\u2019t trust our Sun and Worker not to cut her throat. They like throat cutting.\n But not me.\n I\u2019d never do it.\n I have to hope the K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower doesn\u2019t know that. We\u2019ll strike a bargain between the two families. Child for food. Nobody has to die.\n But I\u2019m standing on the muddy bottom of the pond and there\u2019s no sign of the Child. How can I be angry at a Child for not knowing not to run? Nevertheless, I am.\n \u201cLeave her!\u201d Fe\u0259 cries, launching herself from the razor grass shore. \u201cShe\u2019s scared, she\u2019s hiding under the water. She won\u2019t surface while you\u2019re standing there. Get out!\u201d\n I feel around with my feet; there are fallen trees and branches on the floor of the pond. The Child must be clinging onto them. I begin clawing them out of the mud, until I feel other claws. Fe\u0259 grabs and pulls at me, but she can\u2019t move me; she can\u2019t reach any higher than my arms, and her feet can\u2019t touch the bottom; she has to tread water.\n \u201cCome back to the shore,\u201d she shouts.\n And I have no choice but to do as she says, bowing my head. What was I thinking? I wasn\u2019t made to take hostages.\n It\u2019s over.\n I\u2019ve failed Nayr.\n I couldn\u2019t stand to be like my mother, so I went to find her enemies, and although my friendship, my difference, the use of my very name, gave me my own identity, this isn\u2019t a land where the lone giant survives against the smaller swarm of the tightly bound family.\n The K\u025ckave\u0259, who have everything, will have Greenhill, too.\n \u201cPeace,\u201d I say bitterly, pulling my boots out of the suctioning mud and standing on the razor grass. \u201cPeace has betrayed the Hapkui. My friendship with you has ended us.\u201d\n Fe\u0259 doesn\u2019t even hear me.\n \u201cAi\u0259, where are you? Ai\u0259, come, now!\u201d\n And then a small, limp form floats to the surface of the pond. I think: For a K\u025ckave\u0259 Child, she\u2019s a poor swimmer. She isn\u2019t moving.\n Then I\u2019m aghast to realize she\u2019s drowned.\n She stayed under the roots too long.\n Frightened to death.\n \u201cNo!\u201d Fe\u0259 screams, splashing back into the muck, rolling the body over, cradling it.\n The moons bathe the face of the dead Child in light.\n And my heart turns soft again, and breaks, because Ai\u0259\u2019s face is my Child\u2019s face.\n \u201cGod\u2019s Eye in Her Head,\u201d I gasp.\n Fe\u0259 cradles the beloved face in both hands.\n \u201cFe\u0259,\u201d I shout across to her, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill her. It\u2019s her own fault, for staying down too long.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re a giant\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI never touched\u2014\u201d\n \u201cA monster!\u201d\n \u201cAm I a dog? Do I have fangs? Am I hairy\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re the Hapkui Tower, Wipwai,\u201d she cries. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t chased her, she would have lived. You can\u2019t avoid responsibility for this. The government will know you\u2019re a killer. I\u2019ll tell them. Your family will lose their land. To conceal the crime, you\u2019ll have to kill me as well. Go on!\u201d\n Yes. I am Tower. My stride is long and I can run forever.\n But I can\u2019t outrun this disaster. My land is worthless. I should have left it long ago, or else learned the lessons my family tried to teach me.\n \u201cI can\u2019t kill you.\u201d Tower isn\u2019t here, but she is here. She\u2019s in me. Rebellion or no rebellion, the old Tower trained me, as surely as she trained Biter and Fighter. All the times she punished me for hesitating to kill, all those times I held foodbeasts over the butchering stone. Her shadow is over me, goading me, hating me.\n But even she couldn\u2019t train me to kill my best friend.\n Even though my best friend has killed me.\n \u201cNo? Why not?\u201d Fe\u0259 cries and laughs. She looks at me and she looks at the moons. She sobs and curses.\n She pulls Ai\u0259\u2019s body into the razor grass and collapses over it, weeping.\n I can\u2019t run. I can\u2019t leave Nayr in the hands of Worker and Sun, for whatever time we have left before we starve, or the government representatives come. Even though it\u2019s only hours since I left her, I ache to see her.\n What a terrible Tower I\u2019ve been.\n It wasn\u2019t reaching my forever-height that was the worst.\n It was second-guessing the decisions I\u2019d have to make when I became Tower.\n Did I stop growing at the right height? Was the timing right for the new generation?\n Did I do what was best for the family, or are we all going to die when the government representatives come to banish us from Greenhill, to send us to slave or beg for food in Kashwh\u025cr?\n Perhaps no new family will come. Perhaps, without the spring, Greenhill is untenable as a family holding, and my beautiful, innocent Child will die in the mines when earthquakes collapse the tunnels around her.\n But I know one thing for sure. She won\u2019t be killed by the K\u025ckave\u0259, swarming up Greenhill with their oyster-shucking knives to cut the throats of our dogs.\n We have no dogs. The K\u025ckave\u0259 are no more. And, accident or not, it\u2019s because of me.\n Both lineages are finished. Two moons will set.\n With hindsight, I could have stayed Child until I was tall enough for my fingertips to brush the stars.\n The moat isn\u2019t deep enough to protect me anymore.\n So, on my return to Greenhill, I cut the throat of our tongueless Sun as she\u2019s sleeping.\n She wakes, bleeds, shudders, but I don\u2019t stay to see her die.\n I greet Worker, who stands guard deeper inside the tunnel system, outside the sleeping place of Ancient and Child. Worker smiles at the smell of copper death.\n Then I greet her a second time with a swift thrust of my bloody claws under her chin. She can\u2019t form any words after that, and she dies slower than Sun did, striving to reach and murder me, but I step back easily.\n And again.\n I step back again.\n Eventually, her cruel strength bleeds out. Her opening and closing lips fall finally slack.\n \u201cI killed the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child,\u201d I tell her sprawled corpse.\n Triumph shines in her eyes even as the light leaves them.\n I don\u2019t clean up, and I don\u2019t wake Ancient. I\u2019m too tired.\n I fall asleep beside Worker\u2019s body, and if predators or the K\u025ckave\u0259 come after us, so be it.\n Ancient wakes me some time later.\n \u201cWho will do the work, now?\u201d she exclaims. \u201cWe need extra hands to carry water from the river.\u201d\n \u201cWhat work is there?\u201d I ask. \u201cThe foodbeasts have hay and won\u2019t need to be moved. The fruit is gathered. We eat. We wait to see if the water returns. And you\u2019re free to say what you truly feel, hopeless or hopeful. You\u2019re Sun and Ancient, now, as I am both Worker and Tower.\u201d\n I go into the sleeping room and gather Child in my bloody arms. On my knees, I crawl with her out into the open. Though I\u2019m wrung of feeling, a smile forms on my wretched face as sunrise paints her cheeks. When she wakes, she blinks rapidly and giggles.\n \u201cOutside?\u201d she asks. \u201cTower, you haven\u2019t sneaked me outside since I was a baby.\u201d\n I think of Fe\u0259 sneaking the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child outside, and choke.\n \u201cWe live outside now,\u201d I say. I\u2019m not going back into Greenhill again. Let time and crumbling tunnels bury Sun and Worker where they fell.\n \u201cWhat if it rains?\u201d Child gathers herself, yawning, and sits cross-legged beside me.\n \u201cIf it rains, the Hapkui are saved,\u201d I say, but it doesn\u2019t rain.\n The sweetgrass dies.\n Flesh falls rapidly off the foodbeasts until a dog wouldn\u2019t look at them twice. I slaughter the last of them and smoke the flesh.\n Yet my three-member family is genial and peaceful. I should have killed Sun and Worker years ago.\n Thirty-three days after the drowning of the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child, three government officials and thirteen soldiers arrive at Greenhill.\n Oblivious to their purpose, Nayr offers them dried fruit. She exclaims at the muscular soldiers\u2019 filmy violet robes, feathered masks, and gilded boots.\n Ancient, propped on her paired sticks, proclaims the formal welcome from her raw, painful mouth. As Tower, I bow my head for the official\u2019s spokesperson to pour bottled rainwater from Kashwh\u025cr on my crown. She doesn\u2019t need to bend for me to pour stagnant spring water from Greenhill over hers.\n \u201cIs Greenhill forfeit?\u201d I hear myself ask, as coldly as my mother ever could, the formalities concluded.\n The hostilities opened.\n \u201cNo,\u201d the official says, giving hope that is dashed in her next sentence. \u201cYour Child is to go to the K\u025ckave\u0259. To be adopted by them.\u201d\n \u201cAdopted?\u201d I turn the word over between my teeth. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n \u201cTheir Child is dead. Yours will replace it. According to our archives, the Hapkui and the K\u025ckave\u0259 were sisters, once.\u201d\n \u201cSisters?\u201d\n \u201cForty generations ago, your forebears both belonged to a single Kashwh\u025cr family. The lineages are barely distinguishable to this day. Rather than call for your extinction, the K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower is willing to accept this compromise.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d The word emerges unthinkingly. Ancient gasps. The official\u2019s lips curl.\n Because I haven\u2019t thought it through.\n \u201cI see. You prefer your Child to be put to death also.\u201d\n Thirteen soldiers slant thirteen gilded spears in unison.\n \u201cNo!\u201d Ancient begs, crumpling before me. She who was my friend, my Sun, my only safe harbor, now begging, blubbering through her bloodied maw. \u201cYou must let them take Nayr to the K\u025ckave\u0259. Wipwai, most wise and noble Tower, please, let her live.\u201d\n Nayr starts crying, finally cognizant of what\u2019s occurring.\n But of course she must go to Oyster Flat, the playground of my childhood. As K\u025ckave\u0259 Child, Nayr will have a Storyteller. An Instructor. A Worker who knows far too much of the Hapkui lineage. Fe\u0259 will love Nayr as she loved Ai\u0259.\n All the oysters she can eat.\n God\u2019s Eye in Her Head.\n If no family comes to replace the Hapkui, Nayr will also have her own heritage. Greenhill. The fruit trees may survive, if enough of the spring\u2019s stagnant seep remains to water them, and without foodbeasts to drink from it, it surely will.\n \u201cChild, dry your eyes,\u201d I say gently. \u201cGo with these people. I\u2019m not your Tower anymore. The K\u025ckave\u0259 Tower is your Tower. From this moment, you are the K\u025ckave\u0259 Child.\u201d\n Nayr\u2019s brow furrows in fury, deepening to hurt, and I turn away, taking first Ancient\u2019s arm and then her weight across my shoulders, before I can see any more.\n \u201cPut on your boots,\u201d I call back over my shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019ll protect your feet from the razor grass.\u201d\n She won\u2019t be Child for long. The K\u025ckave\u0259 are a short-statured family. Nayr will struggle to give birth. There\u2019s nothing I can give her to equip her for that.\n \u201cCome along, Ancient,\u201d I murmur. \u201cWithout water, Greenhill might as well go to the K\u025ckave\u0259. I\u2019ll work in the mines, even though I\u2019m too tall. It\u2019s time for us to adventure to Kashwh\u025cr at last.\u201d\n As one, we make our way down Greenhill. The sun, behind us, stretches our already-too-tall shadows, showing us the way.\n Thoraiya Dyer is an Aurealis and Ditmar Award-winning Australian writer and veterinarian.

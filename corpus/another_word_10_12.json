That\u2019s not what you\u2019d call a terminal degree, and the job opportunities that opened before me weren\u2019t exactly in my field of study. I was engaged to a lovely woman who had plans to travel, and so it followed that I did too. In the meantime, though, I needed a job. Not a career, but something I could do to get the bills paid. And, if possible, I wanted something that was fun.\nBorders Books & Music had a fair-sized store not far from me, and, being the sort of person I am, I\u2019d spent a fair amount of leisure time there, browsing and drinking coffee and listening to whatever CDs the music staff put over the store system. I applied there, I got the job, and within I\u2019d say a month I didn\u2019t go there for fun anymore. The office politics, the corporate policy, the constantly changing schedules, and the exposure to the public changed my experience. I started having nightmares about faceless people coming up to me and saying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking for this book?\u201d\nThe place I\u2019d previously gone to play and relax and enjoy myself had become something else. It became a job. The tradeoff was they paid me. And I got to borrow books. And I got a little store credit every month. Honestly, apart from the office politics, it wasn\u2019t that bad a gig.\nOne of the unexpected benefits was that, at that time and in the brick-and-mortar book industry, the pressure of the paid-for endcap hadn\u2019t come completely to bear. In my assigned sections, I got to pick which books got the special display. I got to put up staff recommendations with my name on them. Even better, I got to see how much my recommendation made a difference. There was one particular book\u2014The Age of Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion by Elliot Aaronson and Anthony R. Pratkanis\u2014that had barely sold at all until I faced it out and put a recommendation by it. Then we sold five to six copies a month, which might also have been example of the subject.\nThe world of book retailing is a different place now. The books that get faced out and recommended in the big chain stores are more a reflection of marketing budget. The Borders that I used to work at is an empty building in a dead shopping mall, waiting to be renovated and reinvented, or else knocked down. But there\u2019s a whole new culture of recommendations and reviews and discussion that didn\u2019t exist in those dark days before anyone knew what the Internet was. Now we have review blogs. We have Goodreads. Amazon and Barnes & Noble have even made it possible to review the reviews and say whether a particular comment was useful or not. The conversation about what books are worth reading and why is broader and deeper than I could have imagined back when I could recommend a book just because I liked it\u2014and have the privileged position of retail clerk give my opinion weight.\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t write online book reviews. I signed up for Goodreads, and I get notifications all the time about things my friends have read and what they thought of them. When I get something from Amazon or Barnes & Noble or Powell\u2019s, I\u2019ll cruise through the reviews and see what people said\u2014not just about the book, but to one another in the comments about the reviews. But when the time comes to decide how many stars to give something I just finished, I almost never do.\nIt took me a long time to figure out why I\u2019m so reluctant, but here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to: The more I practice something, the better I get at it.\nLooking back at how I learned to talk about literature, there are three main models that I was taught. First, there were the book reviews that I did in middle school. They weren\u2019t analyzing the story so much as offering evidence that I\u2019d read it. Plot summary was enough, and I\u2019ve read reviews on Amazon and Goodreads\u2014and sometimes in the bigger magazines\u2014that are pretty nearly that. Here is a book; here is what happens in it. I liked it, or I didn\u2019t. Thank you and good night.\nThen there were papers, both in high school and college, that were written more or less the classic five-paragraph style. Introduction with a thesis statement, three things about the book that were interesting, and a conclusion. I have a confession to make here. Mrs. Winters, if you\u2019re out there and reading this, look away now. I mastered this form in high school to the point that my final paper in senior honors English was comparing and contrasting two books I had not at that point actually read: Mark Twain\u2019s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Joseph Conrad\u2019s The Heart of Darkness.\nI had the handouts from class, and it wasn\u2019t hard to thread them together. Both books were concerned with racial issues. Both took place on rivers. One had characters carried by the current, and the other had characters going against it (no doubt symbolic of something). I got an A- for spelling errors.\nThat kind of paper is most like literary criticism, and the ideal which my 17-year-old self cheerfully betrayed was that by examining things like the symbolism of rivers and race, we become better readers. I\u2019ve read some literary criticism since then that was done right, and it was a pleasure. But for the most part, I don\u2019t see that in the online reviews. It takes time and a depth of understanding that the Internet doesn\u2019t encourage or reward.\nNo, the best model of online reviews in my experience is the third model: critique.\nI\u2019ve done a lot of critiques over the years. The first were in creative writing classes in college, which could kindly be called the blind leading the blind. I\u2019ve been to professional workshops including Clarion West and Rio Hondo. I was in a local critique group for almost a decade with professional writers including Walter Jon Williams, George R. R. Martin, Ian Tregillis, Melinda Snodgrass, and S. M. Stirling. There are numerous guides on how to give a good critique. The most basic is the \u201cshit sandwich\u201d approach: You say something good about the work, then all the stuff that was crap in the middle, and end with something else good. The most honest was Maureen McHugh\u2019s description of a good critique: \u201cSay something true and useful.\u201d Regardless, the point of a critique is to find fault\u2014often to take a perfectly good story and reread it as many times as I have to in order to find something wrong, then think about how to fix it.\nReviews\u2014useful reviews, professional reviews, good reviews\u2014are most like critiques given after it\u2019s too damn late to fix anything. They aren\u2019t there to help the author do better, but to guide readers toward books they\u2019d like and away from books they wouldn\u2019t. For that, a good reviewer is worth her weight in gold. Reading as a reviewer means keeping an eye toward what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad. It\u2019s an act of judgment.\nWhich is to say, it\u2019s practicing dissatisfaction. And like anything we practice, the more we do it, the better we get at it.\nMy pleasure at being in the bookstore changed once I was doing it professionally. In the same way, my reading changes when I\u2019m thinking about what I\u2019m going to say about a book. It\u2019s already hard enough for me to turn off my critical faculties and read for joy, for pleasure\u2014to read as a reader. I don\u2019t want to be a critic. I want to be an enthusiast. I want to practice loving the books I read and the experience of reading them without looking for how it could have been better. I want to practice forgiving literature its flaws and shortcomings the way I did when I was a kid, before I got sophisticated and analytical.\nReaders owe a debt to good reviewers. A mind trained to do that work has made a trade-off, and that sacrifice was made for our benefit. I want to be warned away from lousy books and pointed toward good ones, then I want to fall into the page and just take pleasure in reading. And so, as a rule, I won\u2019t go online and post what I thought of a book. I\u2019ll try not to pick it apart and find its flaws and think about how it could have been done better.\nWhen it comes to reading, I try to be bad at being unsatisfied. That\u2019s something I\u2019m just as happy to leave to the pros.\nDaniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

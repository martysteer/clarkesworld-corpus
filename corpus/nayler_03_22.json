She loved the beach. People who didn\u2019t grow up near the ocean think the beach is paradise. They think of it as a destination. They aspire to living on the beach. To being near the water. They think they\u2019ll walk along the sand every morning, barefoot, in some lazy lemon-yellow haze of satisfaction, with seagulls hovering at a respectful distance. Maybe a lean surfer jogging into the breakers with her board under her arm.\n That\u2019s the beach someone\u2019s trying to sell you. People who grew up here know better. This no-man\u2019s land where the land and sea meet is a graveyard. The breakers haul corpses out of the sea\u2014those bones you call shells and turn into crappy wind chimes, the ragged carapaces of crabs emptied of their life-meat, the corpse of a seal with a screaming whorl of seagulls diving down to stab at it with their knife-faces.\n Look into a seagull\u2019s eyes and tell me how charming the beach is. There\u2019s nothing in those eyes but hunger. Seagulls are web-footed little vultures. And don\u2019t forget what sand is: stone and animals ground to powder by time and violence.\n Deadwife picked this place, and I agreed to it because I always agreed with her. \u201cThis is it, Sandra,\u201d she said, looking out at the combers hissing in over the stony bottom past the point, leaning a bit out over the rail of the lighthouse gallery. She was so happy, with the salt-breeze in her hair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die\u2014but if I have to, this is a good place to do it.\u201d\n So we signed the contract. We locked ourselves in at a good rate. That\u2019s what the man at the bank said. And I wondered how he could say those words\u2014you locked yourselves in\u2014and think it sounded like a good thing. Like it sounded like anything but turning the key on your own cell door and handing it over to the guard.\n When we locked ourselves in this place was different\u2014the lighthouse, once a State Park, had been privatized and converted to a home for the aged. The tower and its expanded outbuildings were immaculately whitewashed and attended by smiling people dressed all in white, with the arc of beach in the shallow bay and a mosaic of kelp forests out beyond the breakers. It seemed about as good as you could get. Even I had to admit it looked like paradise\u2014not my paradise, but someone\u2019s.\n But the world changed. And Deadwife, who had made all our decisions for us, slipped away. And it wasn\u2019t the two of us who ended up here\u2014it was only me.\n I\u2019m a little girl again, walking through a field of wild wheat. It\u2019s not the dry season yet\u2014the field is still green. Clouds scud through the sky. There is the hiss of a breeze across the grass. In the distance, the low mountain range is still green as well, the mottle of chaparral rising to a few higher peaks dusted lightly with snow.\n I have a stick in my hand: a long stick with a forked end, stripped of bark. I\u2019m looking for snakes. Specifically, I\u2019m looking for nightsnakes, using the fork at the end of the stick to turn over boards and rocks. I\u2019ll get $5 a snake from the pet store.\n Hypsiglena ochrorhyncha nuchalata.\n \u201cSee,\u201d I say, \u201cthat\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n The field shudders and loses its integration. The sky unzips from the sawtooth of grass. The scudding clouds leave contrails of unrendered sky. Then it is all gone, and I am sitting in the treatment room on that fantastically comfortable leather armchair, looking into the concerned face of my care technician, his eyes circled in blue acetate. The face on the screen pulls away as the mobile care unit backs up and wheels around to the front of the chair, extending a glass of water to me on a loop-ended appendage.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Dr. Kyzlak, my care technician says. \u201cWhat\u2019s it? Why did you drop out of sim?\u201d\n \u201cHypsiglena ochrorhyncha nuchalata.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d The face blinks. Behind it is an island sunset, although I know really he\u2019s sitting in his home office up in Portland, with a filter keeping his kid\u2019s cartoon feedstream in the next room from bleeding in through his voice.\n \u201cThat\u2019s just it. Neither did I, when I was a little girl. It\u2019s the scientific name for the California nightsnake. And the name for the wild wheat\u2014Parish\u2019s wheat grass, to be specific, is Elymus stebbinsii. This isn\u2019t my memory, and I can tell, because it\u2019s been . . . \u201d I couldn\u2019t come up with any other word . . . \u201cinfected with these scientific names. Things I wouldn\u2019t have known until much later. It\u2019s not realistic.\u201d\n The appendage raises the glass of water a little, urging me to take it in a way that is uncannily human. I hate this about these corporeal avatars\u2014how they have programmed in these little nudges in an attempt to make them seem more human. I snatch the water from its extended limb.\n \u201cIt\u2019s very realistic,\u201d Dr. Kyzlak says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way all memories work, in fact. What do you think a memory is? It\u2019s not some static thing, just sitting there in the mind. Memories are changed every time they are accessed. Memories are in dialogue with lived experience. If you were remembering a real moment from your childhood, you would experience the same thing\u2014memories are viewed from a present point in time, and they are invested with new knowledge.\u201d\n His avatar rotates slightly, the screen-mount neck tilting upward and angling the screen in front of my face, a little closer than I would like. \u201cThe real problem,\u201d he says, trying to make eye contact with me, \u201cis resistance. For whatever reason, you are not leaning into this therapy. You continue to attend the sessions, which are perfectly voluntary, but you resist the therapy itself.\u201d\n \u201cThe light isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cThe light. In the field. I don\u2019t know where they are getting the data from for the reconstructs, but the light isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s a stereotype of California light. They\u2019ve imported light from somewhere down around Los Angeles. Up here the light is whiter. San Francisco is at the same latitude as Beijing.\u201d\n \u201cThis is what I mean. You understand perfectly well that no simulation is going to be perfect. Perfection isn\u2019t the aim. These aren\u2019t your memories, just constructs. The aim is to stimulate your neural connectome\u2014to find the crossover points into your real memories.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to access those,\u201d I say. And before I can stop myself: \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to . . . what\u2019s that phrase you used? Infect them with new knowledge. Maybe I just want to leave them alone.\u201d\n \u201cInvest them with new knowledge,\u201d Dr. Kyzlak corrects.\n \u201cI know what I said.\u201d\n The old names for things cling to them, long after those names become meaningless to the people using or occupying them. I walk into the TV room, which probably never had a TV in it, and lower myself into another fantastically comfortable piece of furniture, the pseudoleather couch oriented to the enormous window overlooking the Pacific.\n There is no Pacific. All that can be seen is the rain lashing against the insulated crystal of the viewing window. Behind that violent pattern, altered every second as a new gust of wind whips droplets against the building, is a gray, undifferentiated mist. If I stood up and walked to the window, looked directly down, I might be able to see as far as the wet gray rock of the point several meters below before the view was consumed by haze.\n Off to my right is Annabel, sitting at a table with the upper half of her head obscured by the VR set, an articulated arm hovering over her. I think she didn\u2019t hear me come in until she says, without turning her head in my direction, \u201cHi Sandra.\u201d\n \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d\n \u201cDark energy.\u201d\n \u201cOh for Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d\n \u201cGiant Galapagos turtles fucking. Did you know the male Galapagos turtle\u2019s shell is concave on the bottom so he can get a better grip on the female when he mounts her?\u201d\n \u201cSexy.\u201d\n \u201cNature thinks of everything.\u201d\n \u201cHow long has it been raining for, now?\u201d\n She makes the pause sign with her left hand, and the VR set lifts up, angles away, and slides into its slot on the table.\n \u201cTen days.\u201d She has a new hairstyle: her head shaved all the way up to a cobalt mohawk. It looks daring, and pretty terrible, but I like it on her. \u201cTen days without stopping.\u201d\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s the end of the drought, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cAnd of the fires, for a while.\u201d\n \u201cAnd the beginning of the mudslides, flash floods, all that good stuff.\u201d\n \u201cSo positive.\u201d\n \u201cCram twenty million people into a disaster ecology, that\u2019s what you get.\u201d\n \u201cUsed to be fifty million.\u201d\n \u201cUsed to be lots of things, including a mosaic of linguistically distinct cultures attending to its fragility with sophisticated seasonal environmental management techniques, until the Europeans came along, and\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhat is with you today? Did you just come from memory therapy?\u201d\n \u201cHow did you guess?\u201d\n \u201cThe foul mood. You know, the memory therapy is a good thing. If they think you need it, you do. Why not just make the best of it?\u201d\n \u201cI guess I am making the best of it. The best I\u2019m capable of making . . . \u201d\n \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re doing everything you can to be miserable about it.\u201d\n At that moment we hear the tread of the Lifter in the hall. We both turn to watch it go by, illuminated in the yellow-orange diode motion-sensing lights that silently switch on with its passing. It pauses in the doorway and waves at us with one of its four padded arms. Annabel waves back to it. I give it the finger. It turns and continues down the hall.\n \u201cProbably collecting Tai for lunch.\u201d\n Tai, Annabel, me, and Imani. The only residents left in a facility that was built for a hundred. We\u2019re the ones who locked themselves in at a good rate, I guess. The others thought better of it\u2014or died sooner, or paid penalties and transferred out. When I arrived, there were ten of us. But since then\u2014five years ago, now\u2014two had died and four had transferred to facilities farther inland. More expensive facilities, places staffed by at least a few real people, not just a bunch of robots and a few teleworking doctors projected on avatar screens.\n \u201cWhat is it about the Lifter that gives you the creeps?\u201d\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me the creeps.\u201d\n \u201cYou freeze up every time it\u2019s around.\u201d\n \u201cI do not. And you really shouldn\u2019t let a robot cut your hair.\u201d\n \u201cSeriously, Sandra.\u201d\n \u201cI mean it. I\u2019m telling you this as a friend.\u201d\n \u201cOk, don\u2019t talk about it. Don\u2019t talk about anything.\u201d She stands up. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the cafeteria. I\u2019ve got to stop by my room.\u201d\n It takes me thirty seconds of struggling to stand up. These damn couches, too low to the ground, with their slippery pseudoleather\u2014it\u2019s like a bad joke.\n \u201cI know what I said.\u201d\n Dr. Kyzlak blinked from the screen.\n \u201cSo\u2014I don\u2019t understand. You want to have memories, just locked away, but not access them? I\u2019m not following.\u201d\n \u201cNo. Maybe. I guess what I want is . . . \u201d\n \u201cNot to get old. Not to forget the people you care about.\u201d\n \u201cCan I go now?\u201d\n Walking down the hallway to the cafeteria, I keep coming back to that conversation with irritation. At some point in your life, people decide you don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for yourself anymore. There\u2019s lots of talk about old age as a \u201csecond childhood,\u201d which is nonsense. But one thing is true: at some point, people decide you need their help to determine what is best for you. That you can\u2019t make you own decisions.\n Even Annabel, who is no younger than me, thinks she can tell me what to do.\n Tai, who is like twenty years older than both of us, eats a fruit cup and watches us spar with glee.\n \u201cI just don\u2019t see the point of it,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m taking the drugs. It should be enough.\u201d\n \u201cI found the memory therapy really helpful.\u201d\n \u201cI bet what they are really doing is jotting down everyone\u2019s memories so they can sell them to some telenovela corporation. House husbands are probably weeping to your memories in Patagonia right now.\u201d\n \u201cOh, please,\u201d Annabel said. \u201cI managed to live an entire life without anything happening to me.\u201d\n I turn to Tai. \u201cDid you ever do memory therapy?\u201d\n He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I want to do forgetting therapy.\u201d He taps the screen on his monitor. \u201cToo much stuff in my head. I thought maybe some of it would move aside to make room for new stuff over the years, but none of it does.\u201d\n \u201cHey,\u201d I say, watching the Lifter lumber toward us through a dining room far too big for the single table left in it and trying to think of something else. \u201cWhere is Imani?\u201d\n \u201cShe had some tests that needed to be done off-site,\u201d Tai said.\n \u201cTests for what?\u201d\n \u201cOne of the Big Fears,\u201d Tai says, as the Lifter bends down and takes him into two of its padded arms. Tai pats the Lifter on its vestigial head. \u201cBe gentle with me, big boy. I\u2019m not as tough as I used to be.\u201d\n The Lifter can\u2019t speak, but the strip of diodes that are the only feature on its gray carboplast face pulse green.\n The Lifter turns and carries Tai away, and all I can think of is Frankenstein\u2019s Monster carrying Ilona Massey in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. Tai throws his head back dramatically, eyes closed, and completes the look.\n The Big Fears. Cancer, a stroke, heart failure . . . \u201cDid you know about Imani?\u201d\n Annabel shakes her head. One of the service bots is clearing the table. She reaches over and thumbs the sticker from her banana peel onto its head, where it joins the hundreds of other stickers Annabel has been plastering it with since she got here.\n \u201cIs that my tip?\u201d the bot asks.\n \u201cNo, this is your tip: Electricity and water don\u2019t mix. Whatever you do, stay dry on the inside.\u201d\n \u201cUseful information. I\u2019ll keep it in mind for the robot uprising. Gotta work on our weak points.\u201d It totters off with our trays.\n \u201cI like that one,\u201d Annabel says. \u201cOf all the things in here that talk, I think it has the best sense of humor.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m taking that personally.\u201d\n \u201cYou should.\u201d\n \u201cHow long has it been raining there?\u201d\n \u201cTwelve days.\u201d\n Dr. Kyzlak shakes his head, and the screen at the end of the avatar\u2019s stalk neck also moves from side to side.\n Nice touch, I think.\n \u201cIt\u2019s like being on a ship at sea. Hey\u2014can you do me a favor? Is it raining where you are?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cCan you turn the camera and just show me some sun?\u201d\n \u201cSure.\u201d The screen judders. As the camera sweeps across a room, I see Central Asian carpets, a decorative bowl on a recycled wood coffee table. Nice. He\u2019s making good money on this remote memory therapy gig. Then sun, blazing in through the window on a clear day.\n I never cared much about the sun. That was Deadwife\u2019s thing. She said it charged her batteries, and I believe it. I can\u2019t remember how many times I caught her standing, the sun on her face, just absorbing its rays.\n I can\u2019t remember.\n That\u2019s the truth of it. I\u2019m losing her.\n \u201cYou did really well today,\u201d Dr. Kyzlak says. \u201cThere was something different about today. It was as if you were really trying.\u201d\n \u201cYou fixed the light.\u201d\n \u201cYes\u2014I tweaked it myself. A little home brew filter I popped in there for you. Did you feel anything? Did the memory open anything up for you\u2014connect with any of your natural neural loops?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cIt will happen,\u201d he says. \u201cEventually, it always does.\u201d The avatar hands me my glass of water on its little looped appendage. \u201cI look forward to tomorrow\u2019s session. And I hope it stops raining there.\u201d The avatar\u2019s screen shuts off, and it enters its RETURN autoroutine, rolling across the floor to its charging station and going limp.\n It takes me twenty minutes to get up out of the armchair. By the time I do, I am panting with the effort. I\u2019ve dropped the glass on the floor. But I get upright\u2014and at least the glass didn\u2019t break\u2014and call in a cleanerbot to add to my embarrassment.\n Fatigue. Emotional distress. All this rain. I\u2019ll feel better in a few days. But maybe I\u2019ll skip lunch with the others\u2014take it in bed, instead.\n If Deadwife were here, she\u2019d be furious with me.\n I see the Lifter, standing in the doorway.\n \u201cWhat are you looking at, fucker?\u201d\n It just raises a hand in a wave, then clomps off.\n Lunch is brought to me, slightly cold, by the bot Annabel has been decorating with banana stickers. It adjusts my bed\u2019s articulated tray at a proper angle, fusses with the silverware. As it is leaving, I notice a piece of paper on the tray. Not a napkin\u2014a note. I tap it. \u201cWho is this from?\u201d\n The robot turns. \u201cI . . . I have something to confess. I have developed . . . feelings for you. Feelings I have long been repressing. It\u2019s . . . your menu choices. So enticing.\u201d\n It waits a beat, while my mouth hangs open. \u201cJust kidding. Annabel told me to say that. The note is from her.\u201d\n I eat the food, not really tasting it. I keep going back over the simple memory Dr. Kyzlak constructed for me. Walking through that field, turning over planks and stones with a stick, looking for the California nightsnake. Why that one? Why did they choose that one? I close my eyes and settle into it. I\u2019m hoping for that connection, that point at which this memory will cross over into something else. Do I remember a field? But when I try to remember a real field, where I really hunted for snakes, all I get is this one. He\u2019s failed\u2014this therapy doesn\u2019t work. Instead of waking old memories, it\u2019s covering them over. Replacing them.\n I hear the clumping of the Lifter in the hallway. And a voice, Tai\u2019s voice, as they pass. He\u2019s talking to it, to that thing that doesn\u2019t even have a face. I can barely make out what he is saying over the angry lash of rain against the window.\n \u201c . . . being carried. It reminds me of the war. I didn\u2019t carry her this way, of course. I carried her over my shoulder. Slung her over my shoulder and went up the hill. And when I got there, I lay her down and then collapsed. The medic\u2019s face\u2014I\u2019ll never forget his face. I had been hit by a bullet while I was carrying her, and I didn\u2019t even know it. Later the medic visited me in the hospital. He told me\u2014he told me he could see my heart beating in the wound . . . \u201d\n They cross in front of my door and pause. The Lifter raises one of its two free arms and waves. Tai waggles a foot at me. \u201cI hear Imani\u2019s back,\u201d he says.\n \u201cWhat about the Big Fear?\u201d\n \u201cWhat about it? Go ask her yourself.\u201d\n As they continue down the hallway his voice goes on.\n Remembering. Telling his story.\n I hadn\u2019t even known Tai fought in a war.\n I open the note.\n You\u2019re not fooling anyone, asshole is written in Annabel\u2019s shaky hand.\n I wake to a sound I have never heard before. A moaning siren, like something in a movie. It goes on and on, a howl over the sound of the rain. The room is dark, lit only by the cobalt glow of the emergency diode strips.\n What is it? What is happening? In the dream I woke from, I was holding my stick out, about to push aside a ragged chunk of plywood with its forked end. I knew, I knew there would be one under there.\n Now I am fully awake, the adrenaline coursing through me. And in the blue glow I see it\u2014the bulk of it, looming above my bed. The red stripe of light in its vestigial face as it bends over me.\n \u201cGet off me!\u201d I scream as it leans in and slides its arms under my knees and back. Arms, I realize, that are wet. And as it raises a third arm to keep me from struggling, that arm drips water across my face, and I scream at the cold and the shock of it.\n \u201cWhat are you doing? Get off of me!\u201d I hammer at its head with my fists as it pulls me from the bed, pinning me slightly with its third and now fourth arms, clamping me close to itself. It is soaking wet.\n The sound from outside, the moan of some kind of siren in the dark. As we lurch down the hall I see the service bot from the kitchen, propping open the emergency exit door. The rain is pouring into the building from outside. We pass the bot, sentried at the door with its helmet of banana stickers, and I find myself thinking, absurdly:\n \u201cNo, this is your tip: Electricity and water don\u2019t mix. Whatever you do, stay dry on the inside.\u201d\n \u201cUseful information. I\u2019ll keep it in mind for the robot uprising. Gotta work on our weak points.\u201d\n Then I am outside. The full force of the freezing rain hits me.\n And I remember.\n I am running across the parking lot. The autocab had some kind of malfunction. I summoned the drone driver, somewhere in a pod in the Midwest, probably, responsible for a hundred of these cabs.\n \u201cI\u2019m on the other side of the parking lot and it\u2019s raining,\u201d I say. \u201cRaining really hard. Can you drive me in closer?\u201d\n Static and a mess of bleeping, and then a voice came through: \u201cThis cab is red-dotted. I\u2019m going to need to call in a maintenance bot. Battery\u2019s dead. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n No umbrella, because I never carry an umbrella when it actually rains. And god, it\u2019s raining hard\u2014so hard the rain is bouncing up off the pavement, soaking everything up to my knees. By the time I reach the hospital overhang I\u2019m as wet as it\u2019s possible to be. Wet to the skin, wet through my underwear, puddles of water in shoes that are probably ruined. Shit! But what am I so worried about, as I stab the elevator button? You\u2019re going to be fine. This is all routine.\n You\u2019re dead, but I don\u2019t know it yet, and standing in the elevator I remember another time I was this wet\u2014with you. Caught in a cloudburst in New Orleans and neither one of us had ever seen it rain like that. We thought we could walk a block, at least, then duck into a caf\u00e9, but the moment we stepped out into it we were soaked. Like this\u2014soaked to the skin, right through the underwear, as wet as if we\u2019d climbed into a warm bath\u2014because that rain isn\u2019t cold: it\u2019s a tropical rain, warm like neither of us have really experienced, a sheet of water falling from a hot sky that a moment ago was sunny but now is dark. You\u2019re dead and I don\u2019t know it yet, and I\u2019m in the elevator smiling, remembering the two of us deciding to just walk back to the little studio we rented because it just didn\u2019t matter anymore.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like we could get any wetter,\u201d you say. And you step out from under the eaves with a shrug.\n Or\u2014that\u2019s the way I used to remember it. But now, as I remember this, it\u2019s backwards. I am the one who steps out. I am the one standing there in the rain, holding a hand out to you, wavering behind the waterfall pouring from the awning. You are the one who hesitates before stepping out. But that\u2019s not right: in this memory I was always the hesitant one. I gave the role of courage to you. You held the hand out to me. So which is true? Was I the brave one? Were you? Did we take turns?\n Whichever it was, once you were gone, I stopped feeling that courage. I started pretending that I didn\u2019t make my own decisions anymore.\n I started pretending everything was locked in.Locked in at a good rate\u2014locked in by decisions you had made. But that\u2019s not right: we made our decisions together. The problem is, I\u2019m the only one still around to accept the consequences.\n The elevator dings. I won\u2019t go any further. I told you\u2014I would forget you. If you died before me, I would never return to this memory. I would never walk up to your bed and see you there, unmoving. Gone. I told you, Deadwife: I would never even call you by your real name again. You weren\u2019t allowed to go. Because I wouldn\u2019t be able to live without you.\n But I did. I did live without you.\n The elevator door opens, and the lifter carries me out onto the gallery of the lighthouse. The gallery is crammed with people and bots. Annabel is there, and Tai. And Imani is there, clutching the disk of the mopbot from her room against her chest. Imani, back from the land of the dead. The Lifter sets me down gently next to Imani, our backs against the wall. The door closes with the Lifter still inside.\n \u201cThat\u2019s all of us. Where\u2019s he going?\u201d I have to scream to be heard over the siren. I realize what it sounds like: it sounds like an air raid siren, in one of those old movies about the Twentieth Century Wars.\n \u201cThere are still bots left!\u201d Imani yells. \u201cSome of them can\u2019t make it out of the building by themselves!\u201d\n Annabel leans over: \u201cLike you, asshole! Except they\u2019re probably smart enough to know when they need help!\u201d\n \u201cThere.\u201d Tai points. He slides forward, pressing his face against the rails of the gallery. I follow his gaze. At first I don\u2019t see anything at all. Then I do see it: a coil of darkness heaving in the sea. A bulge in the water. A whip arcing in toward the shore. At a distance it barely seems to move at all. But as it closes in on land, it speeds up.\n We all watch the curve of darkness rushing to the shore. I think of the Lifter down there, the maintenance bot with its head full of banana peel stickers. I try to think, for a moment, if there is anything down there in those buildings that I cannot bear to lose\u2014but no. Everything I cannot lose is in my head. In my head or here, on the gallery, watching this serpent of power slide through the ocean toward us.\n Then it is here. The point is gone. The wave hits the first of the whitewashed buildings. For a moment nothing at all happens. Then the building moves in the water, comes free and pushes itself against another building. That one hesitates a moment before it, too, starts to move.\n When the water hits the lighthouse the whole structure vibrates. But the way it vibrates, you can tell it is going to hold.\n The elevator dings. The door opens and the Lifter is there, with an armload of bots: sweepers and moppers, little handybot units, and even Dr. Kyzlak\u2019s limp avatar, which the four-armed Lifter holds aloft in one hand like Anubis with his shepherd\u2019s crook. And next to the Lifter is Annabel\u2019s service bot.\n In that moment, the elevator lights flicker and die. The nearest siren dies too. I can still hear the sound, like an echo, from up the coast. From a siren that is still standing.\n I pull myself over to the rail and look down. The sea has lost all shape: it is boiling underneath us, churning, choked with debris as the last home I ever thought I would have breaks apart. I hear the shattering of glass and feel things thud into the stone tower of the lighthouse, whole buildings being torn into nothing. The water rises and rises against the lighthouse\u2019s side. I see a mattress like a raft. It could have come from my own bed.\n Imani puts an arm around Annabel and another around me. Annabel holds on to Tai. When I turn to look at Imani she has a huge grin on her face. She sees me looking at her.\n \u201cNothing can get me today!\u201d she yells over the sound of the ocean ripping our world apart. \u201cNot cancer and not a fucking tsunami. I feel immortal!\u201d\n I feel it too. Immortality. It\u2019s not a feeling of living forever, but a feeling of suddenly being alive. And that feeling reaches out to a hundred memories of you, Josephine\u2014because it was with you that I felt it most. The feeling is like the smell of honeysuckle, which links suddenly to all the times in your life when you smelled honeysuckle into an endless chain of summers. Everything seems, in that moment, like a pattern you will always hold inside you.\n I remember.\n I turn to the Lifter. \u201cThank you. You saved my life.\u201d And my memories, I want to say. More precious, even, than my life.\n \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d the service bot says.\n \u201cWhat should I say?\u201d\n \u201cSay, \u2018I welcome you, robot overlords.\u2019\u201d\n Annabel laughs. \u201cI told you\u2014of all the things that talk in this place, bananahead here is the funniest.\u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d the service bot says. \u201cI\u2019m here all week. Or at least until they come to rescue us.\u201d\n Ray Nayler has lived and worked in Russia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Balkans for nearly two decades.

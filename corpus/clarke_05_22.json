This award recognizes the achievements of Australian science fiction, fantasy, and horror writers and we\u2019re thrilled to see both of them on the ballot. The winners will be announced on May 28th.\n Only a few days later, the Hugo Awards were then announced. We are very pleased to see Suzanne Palmer on the ballot with \u201cBots of the Lost Ark\u201d, the sequel to her Hugo award-winning novelette, \u201cThe Secret Life of Bots.\u201d We\u2019re cheering on Bot 9 and the crew! The Hugo winners will be announced during a ceremony on September 4, 2022, at this year\u2019s Worldcon\n To cap off the month, this year\u2019s Ignyte Awards included \u201cPhilia, Eros, Storge, Ag\u00e1pe, Pragma\u201d by R.S.A. Garcia in the Best Novella category. We\u2019re very happy to see her work receiving some (in our humble opinion) overdue recognition. Winners will be announced at a ceremony on September 17th.\n In addition to celebrating our finalists here at Clarkesworld, I was also chosen by many of you to be recognized on the Hugo Award ballot for Editor Short Form. This will mark my tenth nomination in that category, and though I\u2019ve not brought home the award just yet, win or lose, I still get to do a job I love, working with so many amazing people.\n Ten years ago, I was supposed to go to Chicago, attend Chicon 7, and celebrate being a Best Editor finalist for the first time. I was looking forward to spending that time with friends and colleagues. Before that could happen, I suffered a major heart attack that should have killed me. I never made it to Chicago and instead received my anticipated loss among loved ones at home.\n It amuses me that my tenth nomination happens when Worldcon is set to return to Chicago for Chicon 8. It\u2019s like getting a second chance to do something I missed out on, but with a little more experience and a healthier perspective. That heart attack completely reshaped my outlook on life and changed my career path as an editor. It\u2019s weird to say, but I\u2019m better for it. I\u2019m a nine (and maybe soon to be ten) time loser, but my real bar for \u201cwinning\u201d involves waking up every morning. Should the Hugo winds blow my way this year, it will be a cherry on top and a nice way to cap off fifteen years of editing Clarkesworld.\n In the end, I\u2019m particularly grateful that people think I\u2019m ever worthy of the honor: past, present, or future. It makes me happy that people appreciate the work we do here. I see this as an honor as a testament to what we are trying to achieve and a reflection on every author I\u2019ve ever worked with. My career would be nothing without them and the team of people behind me, so this nomination is theirs too.\n Thank you.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

Willy cut off in the middle of a sentence and said, \u201cI wonder what that Gof wants?\u201d The rest of us at the table turned to watch. An Authority cop at the next table, busy not noticing how strong the near-beer was, slipped his hand into his pocket, and VJ loosened the knife in his ankle scabbard. Robbery was rare in Panic Town\u2014making the getaway a major hurdle\u2014but it was not unknown.\nHot Dog sucked the nipple of his beer bottle. \u201cHe has something.\u201d\n\u201cSomething he values,\u201d suggested Willy.\nVJ chuckled. \u201cThat a man values something is no assurance that the thing is valuable. It might be a picture of his sainted grandmother.\u201d But he didn\u2019t think so, and neither did anyone else in the Dog.\nAll this happened a long time ago. Mars was the happening place back then. Magnetic sails had brought transit times down to one month, and costs had dropped with them, so the place was filling up with dreamers and scamps and dogs of all kinds, out to siphon a buck from the desert or from the pockets of those who did. There were zeppelin pilots and water miners, air-squeezers and terraformers. Half the industry supported the parasol-makers of course, but they needed construction, maintenance, teamsters, and rocket-jocks, and throughout history whenever there was a man and a dollar there was another man willing to separate them.\nWe were friends, the four of us hooching that day; but the kind of friends who rarely saw one another except across a bottle. Hot Dog\u2019s name was Rusty Johnson, but he eschewed that for a gonzo nickname. He flew ballistics for Iron Planet, taking passengers and cargo up to the Dogs or around to the antipodes. He had the glam, and women lined up and took numbers, even though he wasn\u2019t much to look at and even less to listen to. Maybe it was the cute freckles.\nVJ\u2019s name was Viktor Djeh and it was fairly easy to figure how he\u2019d gotten his nickname. He did maintenance on PP&L\u2019s converter out by Reldresel, where they pulled oxygen and other useful crap from the ilmenite. His job was not nearly as glamorous as Hot Dog\u2019s, but he made it up in morphy-star good looks. He was a joker, and always ready with a favor. He had saved my ass once when I was on a job in Reldresel and the high-pressure line sprang a leak, so I always paid his freight when we crossed paths at the Dog.\nWilly\u2019s name, to complete the trifecta, was actually Johann Sebastian Fr\u00fch, but a childhood friend had given him the moniker from an old movie and it stuck. Willy clerked for the Authority, so he had neither good looks nor glamour, but he got by on a willingness to listen. His earnest expression invited confidences, a circumstance that provided him with a steady, if clandestine income.\nPinch-face crossed to the bar, where Pondo was serving. Dogs move in microgravity like they\u2019re underwater\u2014in slow, gliding steps and grip shoes. I once saw Jen Wuli chase Squint-Eye Terry M\u2019Govern down the Shklovsky-Lagado tubeway and it was the funniest damn thing I ever did see.\nPondo and the stranger traded whispers, then sidled into the office. Everyone relaxed, and the Authority cop took his hand out of his pocket. A few minutes later, they reemerged from the office with smiles all over their teeth.\n\u201cWho was that muffer?\u201d someone at another table asked when the stranger was gone.\n\u201cI seen him around, down below. Works outta Port Rosario.\u201d\nWilly smiled when he overheard this, and VJ gave a thoughtful nod. Hot Dog pulled his handi from his coverall pocket and checked his schedule. \u201cI\u2019m dropping down to chair a Guild meeting in a couple days,\u201d he told us. \u201cPig Hanson has a run out to Marineris and I have to sub. I\u2019ll ask around.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how it started, though at the time we didn\u2019t know it.\nThe next day I called Aurora Sails in Under-Gulliver, where they ran an assembly hanger. The superconductor loop sets up a magnetic field that acts as a sail and takes up momentum from the solar wind. It doesn\u2019t harvest much acceleration, but the velocity keeps building, and you don\u2019t have to carry fuel. By adjusting the loops you can change the size and shape of the field and sail damn near anywhere at respectable speeds. When you kick amps into a superloop, the current keeps going like a bunny with a drum until you quench it.\nThe problem the client had at the time was that some of their sails wouldn\u2019t kick amps. They thought there might be something wrong with the kicker, but they didn\u2019t know how to prove it. So the Authority tasked me to settle matters because the bickering under Gulliver was growing intense and nothing soothes internal squabbles like an external consultant.\nTechnically, I work for the Ares Consortium, an alliance of corporations formed to run the Martian parasol business. Aurora strings the parasols and Pegasus ferries them to the target asteroid, where Sisyphus rigs the harnesses in place. My ultimate boss was actually old man Bryce van Huyten, but Phobos Port Authority coordinates the local action, so I carry an Authority troubleshooter\u2019s badge.\nI told Aurora to set up two loops in the test beds: one that worked and one that didn\u2019t. They balked because any loop that worked was immediately installed on a parasol and packaged for transit, while the defective ones were salvaged for parts. Parasols were urgent, high-priority work, and they couldn\u2019t let loops sit around for me to play with, and blah-blah-blah. The usual. So I told them to call me back when they were ready to get serious and I cut the link.\nIt took them two days while they pondered what the Authority would say if they blew me off. Then I got a call from Antonelli, the sail prep boss. He had two loops set aside, he told me, \u201cbut hustle your ass out here because Logistics is giving me the stink-eye.\u201d\nAntonelli and his engineers managed to conceal their delight when my ass arrived. They floated at a respectable distance. Everybody wanted to be close enough to the problem to count coup in case I succeeded, but not so close that they\u2019d get cooties if I failed.\nI forgot their names as soon as they were introduced, except for one fellow from Logistics named Moynihan Truth, both because of his unusual name and because I saw him again later. He was ten years old, but that\u2019s in dog years; double it for Earth-equivalent. He\u2019d been born in Golden Flats on Mars, where they have the monument to the first Rover. You\u2019ve probably seen images of Farzi Baroomand\u2019s famous statue, the one that shows all the aliens lined up behind the Rover where the camera can\u2019t see them, laughing themselves silly. Everyone there takes the last name Truth to honor the Rover. The Kid was the only one in the locker smiling and I remember wondering what the big joke was.\nFour test beds took up most of the horizontal space. Hobartium loops were tethered to beds A and B. I pointed to A and said, \u201cThis one\u2019s not working?\u201d Nods all around. The neon-yellow Hold tag was my clue. \u201cAnd that one works?\u201d More bobbleheads. It was green-tagged. \u201cAnd you think it might be the kicker?\u201d Grudging assents, but dissenters mentioned other components, assembly errors, you-name-it. Paralysis of analysis. Smart people with a dozen smart ideas, but not smart enough to try any for fear of being wrong.\nBut the first rule of troubleshooting is: Start Somewhere. When you don\u2019t know crap, whatever you learn moves you ahead. \u201cTake this kicker,\u201d I pointed, \u201cand install it on that loop; and take that kicker and install it on this loop.\u201d\nWhen the switcheroo was finished I told them to kick amps, and the superconductor on A began to circularize from the hoop stress, while the one on B now remained flaccid. I nodded.\n\u201cYep. It\u2019s the kicker, all right.\u201d\nAntonelli swelled up. \u201cFor that, we pay Port Authority two ounces troy per diem? We could have done that ourselves!\u201d\n\u201cNo you couldn\u2019t,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get the two hoops set up without my prodding.\u201d\n\u201cBig deal,\u201d said one of the engineers. \u201cWe already thought it was the kicker.\u201d No matter what the solution turns out to be, there will always be someone to say I told you so.\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cBut now you know. Now take the top assembly off this kicker and switch it with the top assembly on the other. If nothing changes, the problem\u2019s in the bottom half. If A fails but B works, the problem\u2019s in the top half.\u201d\nAntonelli sucked lemons. \u201cWhat if they both start working?\u201d\n\u201cThen it gets interesting.\u201d\nThe secret of my success doesn\u2019t come from knowing all the answers, but in knowing how to ask the questions. Disassembly-and-reassembly successively narrows the search zone for the cause. Three iterations homed in on the damper circuit subassembly. After that, it was a matter of screening the other kickers in stock and finding the ones with defective dampers. Antonelli wrote a Stern Letter to the Earthside parts manufacturer, which let him wrap things up on a suitably righteous note of indignation. Nothing makes a man happier than the prospect of blaming someone else.\nWhen I returned to my rooms toward shift-end, I found a message from Pondo asking me to stop by the Second Dog as soon as I could. I finished repacking my go-bag for my next assignment, then took the towline up Dilman\u2019s Bore, where I found Pondo waiting just inside the Dog.\nSmall as Phobos was, you\u2019d think an illicit bar would be a tough thing to hide. Scientists back in the day had known that Phobos was partly hollow and that puzzled them some. They also realized that the moonlet resembled a Main Belt asteroid, but they couldn\u2019t figure how Mars could capture an asteroid, circularize its eccentric orbit, and rope it onto the Martian equatorial plane\u2014not until they discovered that the Visitors had been tricking it out back in the day. About a third of the interior had been gutted by the Visitors, and the rooms, warrens, and passageways they dug totaled two-thousand cubic kilometers usable volume. But volumes can be made operationally larger when people look the other way, and the pocket under Kepler\u2019s Ridge had somehow escaped notice when volume was platted out.\nKoso Bassendi, the owner, was a hard man to cross and was big enough to make it harder still if you did manage it. I never heard of anyone crossing him twice. Come retirement, he and brother Pondo took their bonus money and started the Second Dog. They served beer stronger than the wretched double-deuce that the Prague Convention allowed, but they served an honest measure. You can\u2019t ask more than that of any man.\n\u201cMickey,\u201d Pondo said, \u201cI understand yer going Mars-side tomorrow.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t ask him how he knew. My schedule was not exactly classified, and the Authority likes to rotate its employees into gravity wells to keep up their muscle tone and bone calcium.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll have time to do my brother and me a little favor.\u201d\nDoing favors for the Bassendis was risky. So was refusing. I figured they wanted me to smuggle up some potables in my Authority packet, so I said, \u201cSure.\u201d Technically, Phobos is \u201couter space\u201d and Mars \u201cplanetary surface,\u201d so the Prague Convention covers one, but not the other. Go figure.\nPondo guided me into the office, where Koso bobbed with his arms crossed and his scowl directed toward the thick, open door of an Eismann and Hertzog safe.\n\u201cSomebody got into our vault,\u201d Pondo explained, in case I couldn\u2019t figure it out. Koso said nothing, but his face tightened like a hangman\u2019s knot.\n\u201cYou call the cops?\u201d\nBoth brothers looked at me and I let it go. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you lose? Money, securities?\u201d\nThey shook their heads. \u201cNot even the Bassendi Brothers Benevolent Fund was touched,\u201d said Koso.\nI didn\u2019t ask who the Fund was intended to benefit.\nPondo said, \u201cRemember that fellow, Jaroslav Bytchkov, what give us something to keep for him the other day? Well, it\u2019s gone.\u201d\nWhich meant that whatever that packet contained, it was worth a great deal more than what was left untouched. At least now I knew Pinch-Face\u2019s name.\n\u201cAnd what was it?\u201d\n\u201cHow would we know?\u201d Pondo said. \u201cMy brother and me sell trust. Who would trust us with their keepsakes if we stuck our noses into them?\u201d\nThe brothers might be shady, but they had a code. \u201cWhat you want me to do?\u201d I said, though I could already guess.\n\u201cYer a troubleshooter,\u201d said Pondo. \u201cFind what caused our trouble.\u201d\nKoso spoke. \u201cWe take care of the other part.\u201d\nThe brothers figured the taker had been in the bar the night Bytchkov had brought his precious. Who else would have known it was there? I reminded them that I had been there and Koso smiled. \u201cThe vault software was tickled during the day, when all decent men are sleeping. You was out to Gulliver the whole time.\u201d\nSo I had an alibi, which was comforting; but the Bassendis wanted me to work for them, which was not so comforting. We went over the surveillance videos and identified everyone present, weeded out those too honest or too inept, and they asked me to investigate the ones who had dropped Mars-side.\nThat included Hot Dog, of course, who had that guild meeting to run. And Willy\u2019s job, like mine, required periodic commutes. But VJ had also dropped, taking some personal days to \u201cbone up\u201d at a calcium spa. Among the handful of Martians in the bar, a petite ice-miner\u2014Gloria \u201cIceman,\u201d from Rosario\u2014had already gone home.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019d appreciate it, Mickey, if ye\u2019d look up our depositor and find out what he given us.\u201d\nKoso said, \u201cAnd it shows up for sale, we might trace the taker.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019d rather you not tell him it\u2019s been stolen.\u201d\n\u201cBad for business.\u201d\nI had a private notion that Bytchkov already knew it was stolen. He just didn\u2019t know it had been stolen from him.\nPort Rosario sits in Arabia, a densely cratered, heavily eroded upland in the Northern Territories. Despite its name, it sits over some of the richest ice-bearing strata on Mars. Old water-canyons wind through the terrain and onto the lowlands, an ancient ocean bed. The dome is set in a deep crater and protected by hobartium loops that deflect incoming cosmic radiation. Mars is a hardscrabble world and attracts hardscrabble folk. No one would go there, weren\u2019t for the archeology and the asteroid-capture program.\nEverybody needs a hobby, and the Visitors\u2019 hobby had been throwing rocks at Earth. They had booby-trapped a mess of Main Belt asteroids to drop earthward if we ever got too nosy. If it was some kind of sociopathic IQ test, like some folks thought, we had passed. We had bridled scores of \u2019stroids with magnetic sails and tacked them into GEO for mining and smelting. And if you\u2019re going to bridle asteroids, Mars is the go-to place. You need less delta-vee going up and down from Mars than hopping rock to rock. That\u2019s why the Visitors come to Mars back when Man was squatting in the forest primeval; and that\u2019s why we\u2019re there now.\nPort Rosario always looked down-at-the-heels. There was dust everywhere. I don\u2019t care how good the precipitators are. They say you can never see Venus because clouds hide the surface. The same is true of Mars, except everything is covered with dust. You need a broom to see the true surface. The Martian wind is not very fierce\u2014the air\u2019s too thin\u2014but it\u2019s persistent. A dust storm can develop in hours, cover the planet in days, and last for weeks. Some of it gets inside the domes in spite of all, and gives everything a rough, gritty look.\nRosarians were also rough and gritty, miners and teamsters being far from genteel, so it was well to walk careful. I tried to look dangerous whenever I strolled around town and carried enough mass to make it convincing and a set of brass knuckles in case it wasn\u2019t.\nThe town is laid out on a simple spoke-and-wheel street-plan. I arrived toward local sunset and took a room in Coughlin House in the northern quadrant with a nice view of the lowlands. Nothing but the best for the Authority. I tossed my gear in the room and headed for Centre Square, which was located exactly where you\u2019d expect.\nLocal custom says everyone goes there first and shakes hands with the statue of Jacinta Rosario. She\u2019s portrayed without a helmet, which is historically inaccurate but artistically necessary. The statue is surrounded by grass and wildflowers and the only open trickle-fountain on Mars. Periodically, someone worries about \u201cwasting water,\u201d but since Rosario is a closed system, the water doesn\u2019t really get wasted, and the size of the \u201cFossil Aquifer\u201d underneath the town is good for a great long time. It\u2019s not like Martians are profligate, but like they\u2019ll tell you: \u201cAnything for Jacinta.\u201d\nPilot House is out the end of Mercado Radial by the ATC tower. That\u2019s where zeppelin pilots check in. I stuck my head in the Chief Pilot\u2019s office and asked if Jaroslav Bytchkov was in town and he checked the logs and told me to try Dominick\u2019s Tavern at Mercado and Fourth. That was the heart of the Groin, where the merchant association had chipped in to hire a marshal to patrol the streets and break up fights. The neighborhood was called the Groin because it was a bad place to get your kicks.\nDominick\u2019s proved a three-story duroplast building facing inward from the Dome. Apartments were on the second and third floors. No fine views for them. I found a caf\u00e9 across the street\u2014One-Ball Murphy\u2019s\u2014with a view of the entrance and waited for Bytchkov to show. I ordered a drink of \u201cwhiskey,\u201d though it wouldn\u2019t pass muster in Scotland or Kentucky. I think One-Ball boiled it out back in an old radiator.\nI noticed Gloria Iceman at another table, also watching Dominick\u2019s. That was interesting, so I clicked a pix with my handi and made a note. Ice miners generally hung out in the south quadrant, around the mine elevators, not here near the aerodrome. I don\u2019t think she recognized me, but the next time I looked, she was gone and I hadn\u2019t seen her leave.\nIt was 2100 when I saw Bytchkov exit Dominick\u2019s right under the streetlamp. It must have been Old Home Week, because he was in animated conversation with Moynihan Truth. The young man had not been in the Dog the night Bytchkov squirreled his precious, but here he was chatting him up like an aged uncle with a legacy. I took a few more pix\u2014and became suddenly aware that the other two seats at my table had acquired occupants.\nOn my right sat a pale, hard-faced woman with the indefinable glam of a rocket jock. She smiled at me, but it wasn\u2019t a friendly smile and she didn\u2019t say anything. On my left, a dusky man with obsidian eyes held a quarterstaff in his right hand. I nodded to him.\n\u201cMorning, marshal,\u201d I said.\nIt was Tiki Ferrer. \u201cMorning, Mickey. What\u2019s a respectable Phobic like you doing in the Groin at night?\u201d\n\u201cJust getting my land legs back,\u201d I told him. \u201cCame down from the Dogs at sunset.\u201d\n\u201cAnd snapping pix like a muffing tourist,\u201d he marveled. \u201cFourth and Merc\u2019 isn\u2019t a noted tourist spot. Why the interest?\u201d\nI\u2019m pretty good at arithmetic, and added one and one. \u201cWhich are you watching, Bytchkov or Truth?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is Truth?\u201d he asked me. \u201cThat the young guy? Tell me about him.\u201d\nThat meant Bytchkov was the marshal\u2019s target and he was taking an interest in anyone who took an interest. That included Moynihan. It also included me. It was no skin off my nose, so I told him what I knew about the Truther.\nTiki introduced the woman as Genie Satterwaithe, a courier on the Red Ball laying over on Mars while her loop was refurbished and stocked up for the Green Ball to Earth. She had earlier flown ballistics and orbitals around the homeworld, which accounted for her implicit swagger even sitting down.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to talk her into signing on with Iron Planet,\u201d Tiki told me.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your interest in Bytchkov?\u201d I asked him. When the marshal demurred I flashed my badge. I wasn\u2019t on Authority business, but Tiki didn\u2019t have to know that.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a Port Authority badge, Mickey. It doesn\u2019t push much mass down here.\u201d\n\u201cLook, marshal, this ain\u2019t for broadcast, but Bytchkov deposited something for safekeeping up in Panic Town and it\u2019s been stolen. I\u2019m trying to find out what it was without tipping him off.\u201d That was the truth, if not the whole truth.\nBytchkov turned and reentered his rooming house. Moynihan made an obscene gesture to his back. Tiki sighed. \u201cOne more name for the list of people less than pleased with Jaroslav Bytchkov. Why doesn\u2019t that list ever get shorter?\u201d\nSatterwaithe said, \u201cIt\u2019s a gift he has.\u201d\nTiki showed me a holo of a tall, lean woman. \u201cThis is Despina Edathanal,\u201d he said. \u201cRecognize her?\u201d\nI shook my head. She had the lanky physique of the spaceborn. She hadn\u2019t been in the Dog. \u201cShe\u2019s a tall drink of water,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019d\u2019ve noticed her.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s digmaster out at Cassini,\u201d Tiki said. \u201cShe filed a complaint against Bytchkov, claiming that he\u2019s filched Visitor artifacts.\u201d\nMuch was thereby explained. The Visitors were a long time gone, but they had left some trash behind. A Visitor artifact could fetch enough troy ounces Earth-side to make snatching the Bassendi Brothers Benevolent Fund look like chump change and not worth the risk. The trick would be getting the artifact from Mars to Earth, and I began to see how that might have been arranged.\n\u201cA couple days ago,\u201d Tiki continued, \u201cEdathanal braced him right here in Murphy\u2019s and told him if he didn\u2019t return the goods she would tear off his left arm and beat him to death with it.\u201d\n\u201cHis left arm?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, she was being nice. Bytchkov\u2019s right-handed. Anyhow, Bytchkov lifted for Phobos the next day. Want to tell me who he left the packet with?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be a health-conscious choice.\u201d\nTiki grunted. \u201cSo. Tell Koso hello when you see him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to think Pondo has the brains in the family.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone has to. Jaroslav\u2019s had some in-your-face time with a half dozen people these past two days. Words were exchanged, as they say, and fists a couple times. Now he\u2019ll only meet with one person at a time and only at a time and place of his choosing.\u201d Tiki laid out a series of holos on the table, each the size and shape of a standard playing card. \u201cTell me if you know any of these people.\u201d\nOne was the archeologist from the dig; another, the ice miner I had seen in the Dog. There were three guys I\u2019d never laid eyes on; but the other three were Hot Dog, VJ, and Willy. I told him who they were.\n\u201cBytchkov had fights with all eight of these?\u201d I said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say spirited discussions. I guess I should add that fellow Moynihan. I have a feeling he\u2019s the one smuggling the stolen artifacts off Phobos.\u201d\n\u201cThe yellow-tagged loops,\u201d I said, and explained about the defective kickers. \u201cMoynihan\u2019s in Logistics. He could\u2019ve rigged those defects in the first place, then instead of salvaging the parts, hung the loops out with the contraband. Since the parts are already accounted for, they won\u2019t be noticed until Corporate runs a material balance.\u201d\nSatterwaithe spoke up. \u201cMakes sense. You can program those parasols to hold station in the solar wind and a courier like me can snag it on the fly.\u201d\nTiki smiled. \u201cMaybe I should add you to the suspects.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Moynihan was grinning,\u201d I said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t amused; he was nervous.\u201d\nThe marshal nodded. \u201cAnd you accidentally cut off their channel. Phobos-Mars radio is too public, so he came down to tell Jaroslav on the QT, probably phoned from the terminal as soon as he hit dirt. That was . . . \u201d Tiki did a quick search over his handi and said, \u201cHe grounded Mars-side at 1830 in Roustabout. Easy enough to call from there.\u201d He closed the dust cover on his device. \u201cHalf an hour later Jaroslav made a call to a tosser cell. He told whoever answered that he had \u2018a big one\u2019 if the price was right and set up a meet at Dominick\u2019s for 2200. I bet he\u2019s trying to unload his latest acquisition. Genie and I were waiting to see who shows up, catch them passing the contraband.\u201d\n\u201cWhich now he doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\nTiki checked his watch. \u201cAlmost time, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone enter the boarding house.\u201d\n\u201cYou have someone watching the back?\u201d I asked, and he gave me a teach-your-grandmother look.\n\u201cI got posse-men watching everyone on my list. These three . . . \u201d He pointed to the ones I didn\u2019t know. \u201c . . . they got rounded up an hour ago when the Minetown marshal busted a gambling den over the other side of town.\u201d\nI glanced at the roster of miscreants. In Phobos, no one cared if you gambled away your life savings, but Martians were different. They don\u2019t approve of people who take foolish chances. Fast Paddy Murchison, Kenny ben Hauser, Johnny Free, Piglet Lieskovsky, Lucy Diamonds, Flo Miraziz, Rahim Hadfi, Manoj Patel, Big-O Saukkonen, and my old pal Squint-Eye Terry M\u2019Govern. Fast Paddy, Big-O, and Lucy Diamonds had gotten into public altercations with Jaroslav within the past few days.\nI handed him back the list. \u201cWhere were the others?\u201d\n\u201cI should tell you because . . . ?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cBecause one of them may have guessed what Bytchkov took to Phobos and arranged to steal it. I\u2019m looking into the Phobos theft for my, ah, patron.\u201d\nTiki conceded the point. He thumbed up his reports on his handi. \u201cPosse touched base around 1930. Dr. Edathanal, they lost track of.\u201d He scowled at me. \u201cThey\u2019re volunteers, not professionals. . . . Let\u2019s see. Hot Dog was at a meeting. Gloria was here at Murphy\u2019s. Your buddy VJ was at Susie Xiao\u2019s Social Club getting himself greased. And your other buddy Willy was \u2018networking.\u2019\u201d He shook his head over the foibles of humanity. \u201cAny of them could have received the call.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t correct him. \u201cAnd Moynihan Truth would have been in inbound processing. He could\u2019ve got the call, too.\u201d\n\u201cBut as of right now . . . \u201d Tiki made a sound of disgust. \u201c . . . we don\u2019t know where any of them are.\u201d\n\u201cBecause . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cDinnertime for most of my posse. I told you, they\u2019re not pros.\u201d\n\u201cHell, Tiki, I don\u2019t even have a posse.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? You\u2019re a troubleshooter, not a lawman.\u201d\nSatterwaithe spoke up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time. Shouldn\u2019t we close in?\u201d\nI wanted to say, You\u2019re a courier, not a lawman, but I sensed Tiki had his reasons for keeping her around.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s gone in yet,\u201d said Tiki, but he opened his link. \u201cBill? We\u2019re going to close in.\u201d He listened, then said sweetly, \u201cWell, I sure hope it was bone,\u201d and broke the link. He looked at Genie. \u201cMartha called him home, told him supper was getting cold.\u201d\nI waited a beat and said, \u201cSo, the entire Rosario Marching Band could have gone in the back way and you wouldn\u2019t have seen them.\u201d\nTiki glowered.\n\u201cOn the positive side,\u201d I added cheerfully, \u201cwe probably would have heard them.\u201d\n\u201cI swear, Mickey, I\u2019m gonna hit up the Association for a deputy. I can\u2019t get by with part-time amateurs. You want the job? You meet a better class of people than you do in industrial troubleshooting.\u201d\nI told him I was happy where I was, but he gave me a posse badge anyway, \u201cfor the interim,\u201d and took me with him when we exited Murphy\u2019s. He told me to cover the back in case Jaroslav bolted. \u201cYou heavy?\u201d\n\u201cI could stand to lose a few pounds.\u201d\n\u201cI mean are you armed?\u201d He twirled his quarterstaff. Firearms are illegal in Port Rosario. The Dome was supposed to be bulletproof, but not even the criminals want to field test the theory. I showed him the knuckles and that seemed to satisfy him. Satterwaithe carried a baton.\nJust then we saw someone scrambling from behind Dominick\u2019s. The streetlamp there was out and the figure was indistinct in the pale glow of its more distant cousins. The building on Fifth, right behind Dominick\u2019s, had overhanging balconies and the figure ran under the balcony and vanished in the shadows.\n\u201cDon\u2019t like that,\u201d said Tiki and we hurried across the street. I circled behind the building as planned and Satterwaithe sprinted up Mercado to try to catch the runner on the next block. Tiki went in the front.\nJust as well, for I had a bad feeling about this.\nDrifting sand had accumulated around the base of the tavern and just below one of the windows there was a very nice footprint. Someone had jumped from the second or third floor. This is an easier feat on Mars than on Earth. I knelt and inspected it, measuring its depth. I looked up and saw Tiki leaning out the second floor window. That gave me the height of the jump.\n\u201cBytchkov\u2019s dead,\u201d I guessed.\n\u201cDeader\u2019n Dizzy\u2019s mouse,\u201d Tiki said.\n\u201cKnifed?\u201d\nHe scowled. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fast and to the point. I may know who did it.\u201d I entered the figures into my handi and the results told me that the jumper had likely weighed over 70 kilos earthweight. I crossed the rear lot to the building on the next street and measured the height of the balcony. One-seventy centimeters. I closed the tape measure and put it in my pouch. Then I made a few notations on my handi.\nI felt immeasurably sad.\nTiki had sealed Bytchkov\u2019s apartment and made his way down to where I stood. He studied the rear of the tavern. \u201cNot an impossible jump,\u201d he agreed.\nSatterwaithe came loping back from Fifth Circle, cutting between the two apartment blocks and ducking under the balcony. \u201cHe ran off the other way, toward Sulbertson. I found a witness, though.\u201d She touched her handi. \u201cThe runner had a white overshirt and tan overpants. Unless the shirt was yellow and the pants brown.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cHe\u2019s not sure. Looked about mid-thirties. Maybe one-seventy height.\u201d\nTiki annotated his handi, snapped the sand-shield closed, and reinserted the stylus in its sheath. \u201cI guess we should round up the usual suspects. My money\u2019s on Edathanal. Bytchkov was going to sell the artifact back to her because he couldn\u2019t hang it out for pickup. When he couldn\u2019t produce it, Edathanal lost her temper and . . . You\u2019re shaking your head, Mickey?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know? She was the only one we don\u2019t know where she was at 1900 when Bytchkov made the appointment with his killer.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve eliminated the impossible you won\u2019t always like what\u2019s left.\u201d\nTiki put a hold on the morning lift, and brought Despina and Gloria to join the others in the departure lounge. Hot Dog had been doing the preflight checklist and Tiki assured him that Iron Planet had bumped back the official lift time. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Phobos doesn\u2019t make two passes every day.\u201d Indeed, it swept the Martian sky faster than Mars himself rotated, and so rose in the west and set in the east.\nTiki placed me by the entry from the main terminal while Satterwaithe stood by the tubeway out to the shuttle. I\u2019m not sure where Tiki thought the killer would try to run, but it\u2019s in the nature of the guilty to flee even if no man pursueth. In moments like that a man might not think clearly. Willy gave me a quizzical glance because he had caught the posse badge on my coveralls and the knuckle-bar on my right fist. He dealt in information, and the amount of information is proportional to its surprise.\n\u201cI think it is fair to say,\u201d Tiki began, \u201cthat all of you knew that Jaroslav Bytchkov had stolen something valuable and you all wanted to get your hands on it.\u201d\nDespina Edathanal protested. \u201cIt belongs to the Visitor Project!\u201d\nTiki nodded and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you describe the artifact that Bytchkov filched.\u201d\nFive pairs of eyes turned toward her. I knew damn well one of the group already knew, but I saw no overt sign. Well, Tiki had his purpose and I had mine.\n\u201cIt was a truncated pyramid of sandstone,\u201d Edathanal said, \u201cabout the size of my two hands. In the right lighting, you can see the hints of a face. Three eyes, arranged as a triangle; a suggestion of structure scoured by untold centuries of gentle Martian sandblasting. It\u2019s the only artifact we\u2019ve ever found that hints at what the Visitors looked like. The weird thing is, the face doesn\u2019t seem to stay put. It\u2019s on one side, then it\u2019s on another. So we think there\u2019s also some very subtle micro- or nano-tech going on with the stone.\u201d\nI spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019ll provide a detailed sketch? I\u2019ll make sure Goods Outbound gets a copy up on the Dogs. Aurora and Pegasus, too.\u201d This was within my purview as an agent of the Port Authority. I wanted the thief to know that moving the contraband off-Mars would not be easy. Moynihan Truth shifted in his seat, probably wondering how much we knew.\nTiki turned to me. \u201cMickey, you want to tell them the next bit?\u201d\nEveryone scrooched around in his seat, except Hot Dog, who was leaning against the wall by the departure tube with his arms crossed, and Gloria Iceman, who sat to the side where she could see everyone.\n\u201cJaroslav had one very hot potato and bounced to Phobos before the word could get out to deposit the statue for safekeeping until his partner could smuggle it out. Unfortunately, that channel was cut off a couple days later.\u201d Moynihan\u2019s smile had grown so broad I thought it might split his face in two.\nTiki took up the narrative once more. \u201cEach of you either wanted to lay hands on the contraband or at least find out what it was. And each of you had a very public argument with Bytchkov. In some cases, knockdown fights.\u201d\nVJ laughed. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t no fight. We played catch. He threw a punch; I caught it; threw it back.\u201d Willy and Hot Dog laughed with him.\nMoynihan said, \u201cHe\u2019s not the easiest guy to get along with.\u201d\nVJ said, \u201cHe was a prick.\u201d\nTiki cautioned them, \u201cDon\u2019t speak ill of the dead.\u201d\nThat got their attention. I had been waiting for the line and had been watching their faces. Tiki\u2019s announcement should be a surprise to all but one. I caught the tell where I was expecting it and a glance at Tiki and Satterwaithe showed that they had caught it, too.\n\u201cAt first, Dr. Edathanal seemed a good suspect,\u201d Tiki said. \u201cShe had the best motive. The statuette had been stolen from her. She had a fight with Bytchkov in which he slapped her across the face, a public humiliation. And no one knew where she was at the crucial times. But the killer was seen running under the balcony of the neighboring building. Genie over there had to duck when she chased after. The good doctor is too tall. She would have scalped herself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the rest of us?\u201d demanded Hot Dog, so red in the face that his freckles had disappeared.\n\u201cI also wondered about Gloria, here,\u201d Tiki continued. \u201cShe was seen in One-Ball Murphy\u2019s keeping a sharp eye on the rooming house, but disappeared just before. But the killer jumped from the second floor window, and she\u2019s too light to have made the resulting footprint.\u201d\nMoynihan Truth perked up. \u201cMe, too?\u201d\nTiki shook his head. \u201cNo, you weigh enough. Your motive . . . Thieves falling out, perhaps\u2014oh, yes, we know about your end of the smuggling operation. You came down to tell Bytchkov that your game with the parasols was busted. But the witness on the next block saw the killer from a distance, and you would never be mistaken for the age he figured.\u201d\nVJ wiped his brow dramatically. \u201cPeople always say my good looks make me seem young.\u201d\n\u201cYou wish,\u201d said Hot Dog. But an unease had fallen over him because he had noticed that only three suspects were left. He noticed Tiki watching him and protested, \u201cI got an alibi for the whole day. I was at the Guild meeting!\u201d\n\u201cThe Guild meeting broke up at 2100,\u201d said Eugenie Satterwaithe. \u201cI talked to some Guild comrades. That would have left plenty of time to get over to the Groin.\u201d\n\u201cBut Bytchkov made a call at 1900,\u201d I explained, \u201cand made an appointment to see the man who killed him. You were still in the meeting.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d asked VJ. \u201cI seen lots of people on their handis in meetings.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Cept I was running the muffing meeting,\u201d Hot Dog said with evident relief. \u201cI was sitting up on the muffing dais right in front of God and twenty-three muffing comrades, banging a muffing gavel. You can ask them!\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d said Satterwaithe. \u201cYou didn\u2019t receive the call.\u201d\nDuring this exchange, Willy had grown more and more pale, and he had begun to ease away from the others. VJ noticed this and whispered, \u201cBetter make a break for it.\u201d Tiki and I both heard it, and so did Hot Dog.\n\u201cWilly?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d I said. \u201cWilly has the best alibi of all. He was in custody in Minetown when Bytchkov was killed, same as three other suspects. If you\u2019d told the arresting officer your name was Willy, it would\u2019ve been obvious. But your legal name is Johann Fr\u00fch, and it got recorded as Johnny Free on the booking sheet.\u201d\nThe arithmetic was simple enough now that everyone could see the remainder. VJ gave me a pained look and said, \u201cGeez, Mickey. This is freeping Mars! You know what they do to you here?\u201d Then he bolted for the exit where I stood, hoping I wouldn\u2019t have the heart to deck him. And I remembered how he had shoved me out of the way of that leaking pipe.\nTiki Ferrer\u2019s hands barely twitched and his quarterstaff tangled VJ\u2019s legs and he sprawled out. Satterwaithe was by his side with her baton ready, but there was no fight in him.\n\u201cVictor E. Djeh,\u201d Tiki told him formally, \u201cyou are detained on the authority of the City of Port Rosario and the Groin Merchants\u2019 Association.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like to hear it,\u201d I told Tiki afterward, when Satterwaithe had marched VJ off to the cells. \u201cYou think you know people; but you never do, and sometimes you find out just how much you don\u2019t know them.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI hope it was just a fight that got out of hand. I hate to think VJ went in there planning to knife the guy.\u201d\nVJ was never the sharpest tool in the box. He\u2019d been smart enough to wash his knife, but not smart enough to throw it away. It later proved to have Jaroslav\u2019s blood in the space between the blade and the handle. Just goes to show the importance of cleanup.\nTiki turned to me. \u201cBut he had nothing to do with stealing the artifact?\u201d\n\u201cNo, and I\u2019ll make sure Pondo understands that. I owe VJ that much at least. At least he never crossed the Bassendis.\u201d\nThe next day, I tracked Gloria Iceman to a Minetown bar. She was hooching with friends, but when she saw me she separated herself and came to sit in my booth.\n\u201cIceman isn\u2019t your actual name,\u201d I told her without preamble. \u201cIt\u2019s Eismann, and someone transcribed it incorrectly when you applied for a Martian visa.\u201d\nThe miner smiled at me. \u201cI liked the sound of it. It\u2019s a good nickname for an ice miner.\u201d\n\u201cIt is that,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut I think if I dig a little bit, I\u2019ll find out that you belong to the Eismann family that makes the vaults. Eismann and Hertzog. It\u2019s enough to make me wonder if someone at the company built a trapdoor into their products\u2019 software.\u201d\nGloria Iceman gave me a wide-eyed look. \u201cThat sounds awfully precocious.\u201d\n\u201cI even wonder who convinced Bytchkov to leave his precious with the Bassendis in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he had to hide it until the heat died down. The statue wasn\u2019t just another link or valve or other bit of trash from a technological midden heap. It was important. Best to hide it somewhere secure.\u201d\n\u201cBut Edathanal knew who had taken it, and a dozen dogs knew he had brought something to the Second Dog. The Bassendis are shady, but they would not have defied a Port Authority warrant.\u201d\nGloria nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to find something if no one knows where it actually is\u2014or who actually took it.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want the Bassendis mad at you.\u201d\n\u201cAt me? Why would they be mad at me? Where\u2019s the evidence I took it, beside a similarity of names?\u201d\n\u201cThe Bassendis aren\u2019t anal about evidence.\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t put a flea in their ear on such flimsy suppositions.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never get the statue off Phobos. Every cubic of luggage will be scanned at the most minute levels.\u201d\nGloria frowned and pursed her lips. \u201cI think that whoever has the statue will wait a long time before trying to move it off-world. Long after the hoo-rah has died down, long after the inspectors have forgotten what they were looking for. All that extra effort . . . You can\u2019t keep that up for very long.\u201d\nThen she clapped me on the shoulder and walked lightly through the barroom and exited into the streets of Port Rosario. I never saw her again.\nAll that was many years ago and they\u2019re all gone now. Hot Dog smeared himself across a hectare of Martian desert when his ballistic failed to reenter properly. Willy went down for blackmail. Satterwaithe left Mars after the baby she had with Tiki died; and Tiki was never the same after that.\nTiki found enough evidence in Bytchkov\u2019s apartment for the Port Authority to arrest Moynihan Truth when he stepped off the shuttle in Panic Town. He was exiled to Ceres.\nThe Martian Board of Actuaries sentenced VJ to slavery on the thermal decompositors out by Mt. Olympus for the remainder of Jaroslav Bytchkov\u2019s natural lifetime. I did what I could for him by arguing to the Board that Bytchkov\u2019s chosen profession of smuggler and thief put his lifespan at the low end of the confidence interval. That shortened VJ\u2019s sentence, but he never got around to thanking me for it.\nGloria \u201cIceman\u201d Eismann was killed three months later when the tunnel collapsed in Ice Mine <#>23. I don\u2019t think the Bassendis had anything to do with it. I never told them my suspicions. Wherever she squirreled the statuette remains unknown, and it has never been found to this day.\nEdathanal never found another artifact like it, and after a time everyone assumed she had been mistaken about the whole thing.\nA writer back on Luna named Myles Hertzog possesses a replica, probably made from Edathanal\u2019s sketches, and has achieved a modest success with exciting stories about aliens he calls \u201cthe People of Sand and Iron.\u201d\nOriginally published in Mission: Tomorrow, edited by Bryan Thomas Schmidt.\nMichael Flynn began selling science fiction in 1984 with the short story \"Slan Libh.\" His first novel, In the Country of the Blind, appeared in 1990.

New San Francisco\n Planetship Phaeton, New San Francisco City, sunny skies.\n A young man with a flat top and an earring sat in the Chinatown substation, face to face with the station chief. Zhao had seen his type before\u2014old enough to dress like a thug, but not quite ballsy enough to act like one.\n \u201cQuit looking at me like I\u2019m a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to file a report. My motorcycle was stolen.\u201d\n Chief Zhao logged onto the police network and entered the license plate number. After a short pause, the current location of the motorcycle appeared on the screen.\n \u201cZheng Weihan,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cThis bike of yours must really be a piece of junk! This is the second time it\u2019s been picked up by the cleaning crews . . . Looks like they thought it was abandoned. Leave a note that says \u2018Not Trash\u2019 next time, you hear?\u201d\n Weihan laughed. \u201cYou guys must get pretty bored around here, huh?\u201d\n New San Francisco wasn\u2019t all that large, after all. From Hsia Street, Shang Street, Chow Street to Chinatown and Sung Street\u2014you could count the number of streets in the whole dang city on two hands. Compared to some cities it was an easy beat.\n \u201cWe have our days,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cThere was an accident on Shang Street\u2014two bicycles collided. That was the only \u2018incident\u2019 this month. How about you? Argue with your dad again last night?\u201d\n \u201cOld bastard is going nuts from boredom over on Planetship Europa,\u201d Weihan said. \u201cHe keeps coming over here and trying to force me to sign up for the graduate exam for military school.\u201d\n Determined to stay out of military school, Weihan had run away from home and came to New San Francisco to live with his uncle. Wei\u2019s uncle had been Zhao\u2019s neighbor, before he died. Zhao remembered that he was a big drinker. He\u2019d charged through several marriages, failing at them all, finding himself alone in the end, without even a child of his own to keep him company . . . Then, one winter two years back, he\u2019d gone out to the bars right before a big snowstorm hit town. They didn\u2019t find his body under the snow until the next morning.\n \u201cSpeaking of joining up . . . Well, I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t think about it when I was your age,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cBack then, I really admired guys who enlisted, so that\u2019s why I decided to enroll in military school. Took the test same year as your dad, actually. Only, he passed and I flunked. So I went to the police academy instead.\u201d He patted his belt holster. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty years now, but this gun hasn\u2019t fired a single bullet in all that time.\u201d\n \u201cDad only went to military school because his family was poor and they could give him room and board. Plus, they didn\u2019t charge him any money to go. He always said being in the military was like gambling with your life. Fifteen years ago, his whole class of fifty guys went into combat. Only five came back . . . I don\u2019t get it! It\u2019s like he wants me to go get myself killed!\u201d\n \u201cYou want my two cents? Your dad is thinking that it wasn\u2019t easy for him to get promoted to the top brass, but now that he\u2019s there he\u2019s got lots of friends. If you go and get your degree, he\u2019ll be able to arrange a civilian post for you. Way safer than being out on the front lines like the other grunts. And you\u2019re more likely to get promoted, too.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s got nothing to do with me,\u201d Weihan said. \u201cAnyways, my motorcycle\u2019s gone. When you get off work don\u2019t forget you\u2019ve got to give me a ride home, okay?\u201d\n II. Teahouse\n Chinatown had a lot of fake historical things that seemed out of place in the modern age, like traditional characters on the signs, banks that were made up to look like old-fashioned pawn shops, and \u2019verse-famous Chinese restaurants. And of course, there were the teahouses.\n The Camel Teahouse had a name all its own, though. There was a storyteller, and Master Tunwuge, who\u2019d show up every day without fail, holding a palm-leaf fan, dressed in the long robes of an old-timey aristocrat. Sometimes there\u2019d even be a group of \u201cforeigners\u201d (ETs). Business had been even better lately, after the Hump-backed Horse had gone out of business. Once news had gotten out that they\u2019d been using android wait staff their customers had dried right up. People who came to places like this were paying for tradition. Going to a teahouse to drink tea had become a status symbol\u2014whether the tea was any good or not wasn\u2019t important.\n Worried that their son wasn\u2019t making enough to take care of himself, Weihan\u2019s grandma and grandpa had put Weihan\u2019s uncle in charge of the teahouse. Receipts weren\u2019t enough to make him rich by any means, but he hadn\u2019t had to struggle so much either.\n I should probably hire some more performers, Weihan thought to himself. That erhu player at the job fair didn\u2019t seem half bad. They were saying he\u2019d retired from some art academy\u2014only problem was that he wanted too much money.\n Later that evening Weihan was surprised to hear a soft voice call out to him as he locked the front door to the teahouse:\n \u201cExcuse me sir, are you hiring?\u201d\n Weihan almost let the door slam on his foot. In the cold light of the man-made moon he would have sworn the girl looked like a living succubus.\n She was wearing a loose robe, with long hair. She seemed a little shy, with an erhu slung over her shoulder. He guessed she was still a student, looking for part-time work.\n He composed himself and said, \u201cPlay \u2018Moonlight on the Second Spring\u2019 for me.\u201d\n The girl sat on a stone seat near the doorway. As the strings began to hum with the melody of the ancient tune, a stately story flowed forth:\n \n A long, long time ago, during the Age of Earth, a blind man sat on a street corner, calmly playing the erhu. His clouded eyes stared blankly out at the masses of people, many passing out broadsheets. Deliberately ignoring the noisy excitement of the crowded street, the blind man could feel the coming storm deep in his bones, but he still he sat, in silent reverence, like a silent spring full of the dark reflections of gathering clouds. A storm is all sound and fury, but clouds are mute\u2014and so even on the verge of a raging tempest, the spring remains as silent as ever.\n \n The girl\u2019s voice suddenly pulled Weihan back to the real world.\n \u201cThat\u2019s all there is to that tune. Can you give me a job or not?\u201d\n \u201cHrm? Oh, yes, a great tune, very impressive,\u201d Weihan said, distracted. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t offer you much money, though . . . If you don\u2019t mind moving in with us, we can at least take care of your room and board.\u201d\n He was surprised to find himself trying to win her over. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n \u201cHan Dan.\u201d\n Weihan quickly justified his concern: how would he ever be able to bear the thought of a defenseless woman wandering around an unfamiliar city?\n \u201cHave we met before?\u201d He really did think she looked a little familiar.\n Han Dan was carrying an old notebook, the kind with an e-ink display that could be rolled up when not in use. The notebook looked just like an ancient scroll. To attract customers, the manufacturer had painted the outside to look like fancy writing paper\u2014it was rather convincing.\n Later, in the privacy of her room, she unrolled the notebook and began to type, her fingers dancing lightly across the screen:\n \n . . . I\u2019ll probably live here for a while making a few bucks doing this and that. If I stay too long he\u2019ll start asking questions . . . and then I\u2019ll be right back where I started, on the road again . . .\n \n III. Meteor Shower\n During the next month at the Camel, Han Dan performed daily. The teahouse was open from eleven to ten. Decent work had been hard to find lately, so it was good enough for the time being.\n Around closing time, Weihan said he had to go out to take care of something. After about an hour he still hadn\u2019t come back, so Han Dan went up to her room and switched on the computer. Entering her long password with practiced elegance, a 3D map filled the screen. Han Dan quickly located New San Francisco on the map, using the mouse to manipulate the image. Continuing to zoom in on the web of streets and alleyways, she enlarged the map until even stray leaves from the greenbelts were visible. She soon found him, standing in line in a 24-hour convenience store.\n The Meteorology Board had put out a meteor shower warning earlier that day, so Weihan wasn\u2019t alone. All the stores had had lines out the door, full of people rushing to buy supplies.\n Han Dan fretted nervously, wanting to do something to get prepared. She went down into the storeroom and found some pieces of wood she thought she might use to board up the windows. But then she realized it was pointless.\n She thought about the old Earth Age tradition: Close your eyes, wish on a star, and all your dreams will come true! Nowadays people wished under the stars too\u2014they just wished that the damn meteor showers would end sooner rather than later!\n Weihan came back at eleven-thirty carrying two bottles of purified water and some other things.\n \u201cWe\u2019re staying in the basement tonight,\u201d he said, catching sight of Han Dan.\n The bunker underneath Weihan\u2019s home had two bedrooms connected by a main room. Aside from the stairway that led up to the living room of the house, there was also a blast door that led to the air raid shelter under the street.\n When the meteor shower finally began at three-thirty in the morning, its arrival was announced with a violent shaking. Great fragments of rock broke and splintered through the air like artillery shells, and buildings collapsed with a deafening roar. Weihan tossed and turned in the pale light of the emergency shelter, unable to sleep.\n \u201cCan\u2019t sleep too, huh?\u201d he asked when he saw Han Dan enter the room.\n Weihan sat up and switched on the TV. The signal was cruddy, but through the static they could just make out the meteor\u2019s great swath of destruction\u2014it was an up-to-the-minute report. Countless meteors were falling into the atmosphere, leaving long tails of material in their wake which fell to ground like great torrents of rain, smashing the city under a hail of debris. The extreme temperatures had set everything that could burn aflame, leaving the night sky illuminated by the blaze of New San Francisco.\n Despite the powerful air conditioners and oxygen recyclers that had been installed in the bunker, they could already feel the heat of the conflagration above radiating through the ceiling. A minor meteor shower might make for a good school-girl romance, but a major meteor shower like this had the potential to carpet bomb a city back to the Stone Age.\n \u201cI heard that way back when we were still in the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn helped block the Earth from all sorts of dangerous flying objects,\u201d Han Dan said.\n \u201cWe sure ain\u2019t in the Solar System anymore . . . \u201d Weihan muttered, taking out an old photograph of a group of men in military uniforms.\n \u201cI had two uncles,\u201d he said after a long pause. \u201cThe older one was an officer in the Seventeenth Fleet, he died back in \u2019fifteen. Second uncle was in the closest rescue ship. They\u2019d gotten their engines knocked out by a meteor, though, so all second uncle could do was watch his brother\u2019s ship go down in flames. Afterwards second uncle was a total wreck. He started drinking and pretty soon that was it for him, too . . . \u201d\n The TV crackled with a final burst of static before going silent. A great rumble echoed from above their heads and dust rained down from the ceiling.\n \u201cYep! This has got to be just about the worst meteor shower I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Weihan mused with obvious detachment. Meteors showers were, after all, a fact of life for the residents of New San Francisco, coming once every couple of years.\n A sudden explosion shook the bunker, with a roar that seemed to crack the heavens and split the earth. Moments later, urgent knocking could be heard outside the blast doors. Weihan opened the doors, coming face to face with Police Chief Zhao. His two hairy legs sticking out from under his nightshirt, he waved a still-holstered pistol in Zheng\u2019s face, shouting, \u201cYou have to get to the emergency escape pods! The meteor shower broke the sun!\u201d\n Every planetship had its own massive, fusion-powered artificial sun that orbited in a fixed path, providing a never-ending stream of light and heat. Without its sun, a planetship would freeze solid.\n \u201cT-that\u2019s impossible!\u201d Weihan sputtered. But from Zhao\u2019s expression he knew that the old geezer wasn\u2019t kidding around.\n Zhao left them to notify others of the evacuation order. Weihan and Han Dan, meanwhile, rushed to the nearest emergency pods. From the thick layer of dust, it was obvious that no one had been here in a long, long time. They were just like the life rafts on a boat\u2014you couldn\u2019t do without them, but nobody thought that you\u2019d ever actually need them. The ancient LCD screens flickered with the latest news: Chow Street\u2019s bunker had suffered a direct hit, bringing the lake of fire from above directly into the oxygen-rich shelter below. More likely than not, all lives in the sector had been lost\u2014at any rate no one was willing to open the blast doors to check for survivors. Experience had taught them that if they opened it even a crack, smoke and flames would pour out into the next sector, killing even more people.\n The ground shook like a massive beast shaking from the pain of some great wound.\n The escape pods were in the process of refueling. In accordance with the ancient protocols detailed in the \u201cEmergency Escape Plan for Planetships,\u201d infants, children, and teenagers were boarding ahead of older residents. Of course, renowned scholars, professors, and other \u2018mission critical\u2019 personnel could board the first wave of pods along with the children. Although the police in charge of maintaining public order kept stressing that there was more than enough space for everyone, they all knew that the later you left your chances for survival were that much lower.\n One man tried to push his way onto a pod, shouting, \u201cI\u2019ll give half of all my money\u2014all hundred million dollars of it\u2014to the man who gives me his spot on this escape pod!\u201d\n The only response was the dull thud of a policeman\u2019s bullet.\n The oldest among them volunteered to stay behind to help the police, telling their children and grandchildren to hurry onto an escape pod. Saying goodbye, they promised that they would catch one of the later pods.\n Of course, there was a good chance that the last wave of escape pods might very well never take flight.\n When it was Weihan\u2019s turn to board an escape pod, he discovered a young woman weeping behind him. Her two children had already boarded the previous wave, but she\u2019d been separated from them. By now, the flames had nearly reached the launch bay.\n \u201cCan I let her board in my place?\u201d Zheng shouted at a nearby police officer. Unspeaking, the man simply pointed the gaping black hole of his gun directly at Weihan\u2019s chest. Zheng hurriedly averted his gaze and boarded the escape pod.\n Han Dan had boarded just before him, and was now sitting by his side. He was surprised to see her fasten the thin metal restraints with practiced efficiency.\n \u201cPut on your seatbelt! An old spacecraft like this won\u2019t have artificial gravity or any of the other comforts of those passenger barges you\u2019re probably used to!\u201d\n The escape pod suddenly lurched into motion, the painful acceleration pinning them into their seats and the hull creaking like it was going to fall apart. The mouths of the launch silos were located directly under the streets and public squares of New San Francisco\u2014rather than build blast doors they had opted to blow up the surface structures if it ever became necessary for the escape pods to be put into use.\n While the city gave into the inferno, the rain of meteors continued to fall across the face of the great planetship. From the escape pod window they watched the flow of spacecraft issuing forth from the silos that pocked the landscape like volcanos. Along the bustling thoroughfares of New San Francisco grand old buildings stood like sentinels over the looping greenbelts . . . and then one by one they fell in upon themselves, turning to ash under the searing blaze.\n IV. Planetships\n More than a ship, Phaeton had been a planet unto itself, equivalent in size and mass to the Earth of old, with an atmosphere, azure seas, and vast continents\u2014a complete biosphere. Of course, befitting a planetship, it was also outfitted with a massive engine, capable of pushing the artificial world through the galaxy. Unlike a real planet, Phaeton had therefore never been bound to orbit a single star\u2014earning it the title of \u201cplanetship.\u201d\n Planetship Phaeton was by no means alone in the universe: after Planetship Europa had been completed, mankind had built two more ships, with Planetship Asia and Planetship America gradually taking shape. Since the original Earth only had seven continents, by the eighth planetship they had run out of names, and so they began to borrow the names of mythical figures from the various nations of Earth\u2014Gaea, Phaeton, Perseus, Kronos.\n Enormous, with wispy white clouds under the thin atmosphere hanging over great oceans and wide continents, the planetships were vessels of not only incomparable beauty, but also great fragility\u2014in the boundless expanse of the universe, thin planetary atmospheres are as fleeting as soap bubbles. Viewed in this light, it was unsurprising that the Planetship Alliance had established a great military, with ring upon ring of defensive lines designed to protect the ships of the alliance.\n Sadly, this massive military and its many lines of defense had been unable to prevent the onslaught of the meteor shower on Planetship Phaeton. The losses were too great this time\u2014according to news reports, when the massive asteroid had entered the airspace of the Planetship Alliance the government had sent out a strike team to change the trajectory of the great rock. Its velocity proved too great, however, and so they tried instead to break it apart into smaller pieces. According to the data provided by the news channels, the asteroid struck with a level of force that would have pushed Earth out of its orbit.\n And so the military had done their best to pulverize the object, and as Han Dan gazed down upon fragments floating outside the window of the escape pod, she caught sight of the wreckage of military ships, even the remains of some unknown war heroes . . . The planetship of course had its own anti-meteor system\u2014but if the damage became too great, then the only remaining option was to fall back on the military.\n After losing its artificial sun, the temperature of Planetship Phaeton had plummeted abruptly. The sudden shift in temperature had created tremendous windstorms, while torrential rains froze in midair, falling to the ground as hail. The inclement weather had slowed the passage of the escape pods, leaving a great number of people behind on the planetship. Not long after the torrential floods covering the surface of the great ship froze, trapping men and ships alike in solid ice.\n As the temperature continued to drop, the temperature on the surface of the ice quickly became lower than below the ice, the hundred-meter-thick sheet of frozen water began to rupture with great thundering cracks. Long fissures in the ice stretched from one end of the planetship to the other, the stress forming great valleys and high mountains from the once level ice sheet, utterly destroying the cities, fields, forests, and even the oceans. Finally, great flakes of snow began to fall\u2014frozen C02. After a few days, blue snow would begin to fall\u2014oxygen and nitrogen. Without the artificial sun, the entire atmosphere would freeze solid.\n In the escape pods, some of the refugees were crying while images of old Earth played on the screens, as if to remind them that this was not the first time humanity had lost its home. In a strange way, it did seem to lessen the blow of losing Planetship Phaeton a little.\n Han Dan turned on her notebook and wrote a few lines:\n \n As refugees, we seem to have completely forgotten our former lives of leisure . . . We\u2019ve gone back to the way our ancestors lived\u2014running from disaster to disaster. The moment we boarded this escape pod we were making a gamble with our lives. We were putting our lives in the hands of this ship, giving up our control over our ability to escape. Just behind us, two escape pods just collided with a meteor fragment and exploded. So many parents who will never see their children again, so many children who have lost their parents forever . . .\n \n V. Chang\u2019an, \u201cEurope\u201d\n Older folks were used to calling Planetship Europa by its old Earth name \u201cEurope.\u201d The oldest of all the planetships, Europa was home to Chang\u2019an, the largest city in the universe, and capital of the Planetship Alliance.\n Downtown Chang\u2019an was thronged with rescue workers and medical personnel gazing up at the towering minaret of the Sky Tower\u2014Europa\u2019s primary space elevator. To keep the crowds and journalists out, the police had cordoned off the public square with bright yellow tape. Meanwhile, wave after wave of refugees were brought down from space via the Sky Tower.\n After Weihan left the escape pod, a doctor examined him to see if he had been injured during his escape from the Phaeton. A nearby clerk pulled up his record from the Ministry of Civil Affairs database and printed his temporary ID card, which could be used as both a credit card and driver\u2019s license.\n \u201cAccording to our records, your parent\u2019s house is on Planetship Europa, right? Looks like you won\u2019t be needing a bed in the refugee camp, then. Sorry to say so, but our space is limited.\u201d\n When the clerk pulled up Han Dan\u2019s records, however, his jaw dropped, leaving his mouth open wide enough to stuff an ostrich egg inside.\n After emerging from the Sky Tower into Chang\u2019an\u2019s main square, the refugees ignored the calls of the rescue workers and began a crazed search for their relatives.\n Weihan saw Police Chief Zhao\u2019s wife standing with her two children by the Sky Tower exit. Policemen had left the Phaeton last of all, so it was unlikely that Zhao\u2019s family would ever see him again.\n VI. Countryside\n There was a certain lane in the outskirts of Chang\u2019an, beside which was a certain village. Opposite the village was a watermelon patch, the melons still far from ripe. Most of the young people had left to find work in the big city, leaving fewer and fewer behind in countryside. To earn a few bucks in his retirement, an old man had opened a small restaurant in the front part of his house. Gaunt and malnourished, the old man seemed to be suffering from a case of rickets.\n This was Weihan\u2019s grandfather. After arriving at the Zheng family house, Weihan and Han Dan had volunteered to help out in the restaurant. Although the old man loved his grandson dearly, Han Dan knew better than bring up Zheng Dong, his unfilial son. Twenty years ago, Grandpa Zheng had fiercely opposed his son\u2019s decision to enter military school. It was a dangerous career to embark on\u2014one could never say for sure whether or not you\u2019d end up taking a bullet on the front line. Better to have a living son farming a few barren acres, quietly making do.\n There were hundreds of thousands of acres of good land in the countryside, their crops nurtured by the artificial sun and irrigated by the (nearly) natural rains and snows. They were far more expensive than the synthetic foodstuffs from the factories, but the taste wasn\u2019t much better.\n \u201cI\u2019ve never taken one cent of his money, you know. I do well enough to take care of myself,\u201d Zheng\u2019s grandfather said out of nowhere one day. \u201cI have nothing but respect for those who serve. I just didn\u2019t want to see my flesh and blood taking those kinds of risks.\u201d\n An all-terrain SUV modeled on the automobiles of the Earth Age had just parked in front of the little shop. The license plate indicated that it was a military vehicle. Having seen it coming from a long way away, the old man had pulled a \u201cClosed\u201d sign from under the counter and hung it on the door before going back into the house.\n A soldier stepped out of the SUV. He was perhaps fifty, with grey hair around his temples. Han Dan recognized him right away as Weihan\u2019s father.\n Zheng Dong walked to the front gate of the house and stood there, stiffly. He made no move to enter, however, and Han Dan wasn\u2019t about to invite him in. She\u2019d heard Weihan say that fifteen years ago his grandfather had gotten so mad that he told dad to leave and never come back. Even though all of that was in the distant past now, and Grandpa Zheng had long since forgiven him, the old man had never been willing to swallow his pride and say it out loud.\n It was obvious that they were two stubborn old bulls. It was even said that every New Year\u2019s eve Zheng Dong would leave his wife and son to celebrate alone while he stood out in the wind and snow, waiting for his father to finally say what he already felt.\n \u201cHow many years has it been then?\u201d Zheng Dong asked Han Dan, who quietly set aside her work.\n \u201cToo many. Weihan wasn\u2019t even a year old when I left.\u201d\n They left the restaurant one after the other, walking along a quiet country lane.\n \u201cSo in all these years you never settled down?\u201d Zheng Dong asked finally.\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad. I\u2019ve gotten used to it.\u201d\n \u201cRun into old acquaintances much?\u201d\n \u201cNow and again. Ten years ago, or maybe it was twenty, or even fifty . . . An old man grabbed me by the arm claiming that I was his childhood sweetheart from eighty years ago. His great-grandson apologized for him, saying that his great granddad was always getting confused.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not planning to have my son to play the same role as that old man, are you?\u201d Zheng Dong asked anxiously.\n Han Dan stooped to pick a wild chrysanthemum from the edge of the field, placing it in her long hair.\n \u201cYour son reminds me of my brother.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t see how,\u201d Zheng Dong said. Her brother had been assassinated many years ago for political reasons.\n \u201cMy little brother was one of a kind,\u201d Han Dan said with a smile. She\u2019d always been proud of him. \u201cHow about you? Thinking about becoming a general?\u201d\n \u201cIf fate wills it. That\u2019s not the sort of thing you go asking for. These days, there aren\u2019t many people who hang up their stars, even after they retire.\u201d\n Insiders all knew the two hardest ranks to get promoted to in the military were from high-level officer to brigadier general, and from major general to lieutenant general. As far as the highest ranks, like marshal, it wasn\u2019t even worth dreaming about it. Most people only got promoted that high posthumously.\n \u201cI always thought that soldiers who didn\u2019t want to become generals weren\u2019t worth their salt as soldiers,\u201d Han Dan said. \u201cAnyways, we have other things to talk about, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n \u201cDid you know that I was responsible for coordinating the rescue mission on Planetship Phaeton? I sent my best troops to evacuate the government first,\u201d Zheng Dong said, clenching his fists. \u201cWhen the head of the local administration saw them all he did was light a goddamn cigarette. He turned to the window to watch the frozen C02 fall in great big flakes from the sky, and you know what he said to them? He said, \u2018Go rescue the people first. I\u2019m not leaving until each and every one of my people has been evacuated.\u2019 He froze to death on Phaeton.\u201d\n \u201cEven if he had survived the disaster, he would have just been counting the days until they sent him to prison,\u201d Han Dan scoffed. \u201cPlanetships are supposed to have anti-meteor systems, aren\u2019t they? Something went wrong and stopped the intercept system from kicking in. Nobody thought things were going to get as bad as they did\u2014your son was sitting in the underground bunker watching the meteor shower like it was a TV show.\u201d\n \u201cAnother corrupt official,\u201d Zheng Dong scoffed. \u201cEveryone is saying that he was plundering the special fund for the anti-meteor system.\u201d\n \u201cWe live in special times,\u201d Han Dan replied, feeling a vague fury rise within her chest as she spoke. \u201cThe only way to deal with these bastards is to give \u2019em the old one-two. Natural disasters don\u2019t scare me half as bad as man-made ones! You\u2019ve seen the internal military report that\u2019s been circulating, right? We\u2019ve got more meteor showers coming our way\u2014we can\u2019t afford to make any mistakes!\u201d\n The report has been handed out to all of the top-level commanders in the armed forces. As the captain of a warship, Zheng Dong had of course been provided a copy.\n \u201cAs a soldier, I\u2019ll follow my orders, whatever they are, unconditionally. But as a civilian, I want to know what the hell they were thinking when they chose this route!\u201d\n Han Dan crouched by the edge of the field and peered into the crystal clear water of the irrigation ditch. Duckweed grew in the muddy channel bottom, and small fish played in the thick grass. Bucolic scenes like this made it hard to believe that they were on a planetship wandering the universe.\n \u201cIn the vastness of the universe, technology is our one and only defense,\u201d Zheng Dong said, suddenly recalling the favorite saying of the famous General Han Lie, passed down by the men and women of the military for millennia.\n \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right,\u201d Han Dan said. \u201cThe universe is so big\u2014who knows what dangers might lie in store for us? Better to invest our resources in the development of more perfect technology, rather than find ourselves unable to affect a rescue in our darkest hour of need.\u201d\n Weihan had been out all day on the old motorcycle he\u2019d bought at the flea market, delivering food from the restaurant. He\u2019d wasted a lot of time swapping out the old battery, so it was late when he got back. Most of the vehicles on the planetships were powered by antimatter, but spacecraft used fusion reactors. Batteries had been getting more and more expensive lately. There hardly seemed anything to them\u2014palm-sized cylinders with powerful magnets to keep their tiny antimatter crystals trapped inside a vacuum. Even so, they still cost eight bucks\u2014about as much as a meal in Chang\u2019an.\n When he got back, Weihan saw his dad standing in the field, talking to Han Dan.\n \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d\n \u201cJust met,\u201d Zheng Dong lied. \u201cIs this your girlfriend?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re more than friends, but I can\u2019t say we\u2019ve got that kind of relationship going on.\u201d\n Weihan was telling the truth. Han Dan was a melancholy sort. The girls he fell for tended to be more like him\u2014full of vim and vinegar.\n \u201cAh, well. That\u2019s probably for the best,\u201d Zheng Dong said, relieved. \u201cOh, that reminds me. Have you thought at all about going to grad school? Or military school?\u201d\n Weihan frowned. \u201cEven if you pointed a gun at my chest I wouldn\u2019t go! Not on my life!\u201d\n Well, at least I know where he got his stubborn streak from, Han Dan thought to herself.\n VII. Seventh Avenue Square\n The most exciting thoroughfare in all of Chang\u2019an was Seventh Avenue, running from North to South. Along the northern stretch of the broad street one could find the very highest government offices: consulates, offices of the military, legislative buildings, and in the center of them all the most important structure in the entire Planetship Alliance: the mysterious \u201cAll Planetship High Command.\u201d The southern stretch of Seventh Avenue, meanwhile was known as the \u201cGolden Mile,\u201d a place of endless activity and never-ending crowds. Located in the nexus of the two was the Seventh Avenue Square, said to be the largest in all the cities of the planetships. A massive statue of General Han Lie towered off to one side. Some said that he had been a cruel dictator, while others said he was a leader of great skill and intelligence. Even though more than a thousand years had passed since his death, even now he remained a controversial figure.\n In the southern part of the great square was the Chang\u2019an Municipal Theater. For reasons immediately obvious to anyone who saw it, locals called it the \u201csteamed bun theater.\u201d Today\u2019s scheduled performance was the opera Wandering Earth, an adaption of Liu Cixin\u2019s ancient science fiction tale. Thanks perhaps to the striking similarity of the real life experiences of the people of the planetships to the plot of this hoary old story, the thousand-year-old opera was as popular as ever.\n Just past nightfall Weihan and Han Dan emerged from the theater and walked out into the square. Owing to the recent disaster on Phaeton there was less activity in the square than usual, which was filled with countless funeral wreaths commemorating the dead, along with collection stations where concerned citizens could donate to the ongoing relief efforts. The nearby shops seemed as busy as ever, however. Refugees and death had already become an unavoidable part of their long journey through the universe and the people of Europa had become accustomed to the presence.\n Han Dan, however, seemed incredibly moved by the opera, and it was a long time after they left the theater before she stopped brushing the tears from her eyes.\n \u201cAlright already, here,\u201d Weihan said, handing her an ice cream cone he\u2019d just bought. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d\n Suddenly feeling self-conscious, Han Dan stopped crying and took a small bite of ice cream.\n \u201cOh! It\u2019s really good. When I was little, I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed it could have tasted this good!\u201d\n \u201cWhen you were little?\u201d he asked, looking puzzled. \u201cDid your parents not let you eat junk food or something?\u201d\n \u201cThey didn\u2019t have this sort of thing on the spaceship . . . \u201d she said quietly.\n \u201cI\u2019d heard that before we built the planetships all mankind lived on spaceships,\u201d Weihan said, looking up at the imposing statue of General Han Lie. \u201cI even visited some of the actual ships from the Age of Exile that were saved as historical relics. Twenty thousand people crammed onto a single busted down ship just over one kilometer long. Their rooms were like narrow little pigeon cages\u2014families of four had to find a way to fit into a room that must have been, what? Twenty square meters? They say General Han Lie grew up on a ship like that . . . \u201d\n While Han Dan waited for him in the square, Weihan went and fetched his motorcycle.\n \u201cHop on. We should be getting back.\u201d\n As the motorcycle sped down the broad avenue, the street lights on either side of the street swept past. Chang\u2019an at night was splendid to behold, with its myriad of lights zipping about like snakes of liquid silver or dancing fire\u2014or shooting stars, a perfect mirror of the heavens above.\n According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the shooting stars which had been appearing in the skies of the planetships were coming from a small but incredibly dense asteroid belt which they happened to be passing through at the moment. Whirling around a massive neutron star with truly unsettling velocity, the asteroid belt was the kind of place that few civilizations dared to tread. But humanity wasn\u2019t just any civilization.\n Han Dan held Weihan tightly around the waist, resting against his firm back, her eyes softly closed. She couldn\u2019t remember when she last had someone like this\u2014someone who set her mind at ease. In a dreamlike voice she said, \u201cWhen I was a little girl, it was my favorite thing in the whole world to hold my dad just like this . . . He was a miner. Every day I would lie on the floor of the spaceship by one of the viewing windows and watch the mining ships moving the asteroids around, building planetships from nuclear slag, or repairing broken down spacecraft . . .\n The year I turned ten, there was an accident. Dad\u2019s ship was pulling an asteroid to install into a prototype planetship that was taking shape\u2014the future Planetship Asia\u2014when there was sudden movement in the molten magma on the surface . . . Later on mom remarried and found me a stepdad, but he didn\u2019t make much of an impression. He was an engineer who always left for work before I woke up and got back after I was asleep. That\u2019s how life was for a while, until mom got sick and died. Stepdad found a stepmom, and found me a job, too, doing odd chores in the research center where he worked . . . When I finally left home my little brother was only five months old . . . \u201d\n Han Dan would have been surprised to see that Weihan was hanging on her every word, despite the loud roar of his clunky old motorcycle and the softness of her voice. Perhaps she\u2019d kept these secrets for too long and found herself unconsciously longing for the opportunity to share them with someone.\n \u201cThe next time I saw my brother, he was already an old man, gray at the temples, with general\u2019s epaulets on his shoulders. He had no idea I was his older sister . . . Or maybe he knew after all. I can\u2019t say for sure . . . When I asked why he had joined the military he just said, \u2018There are some things that you have to be willing to put your life on the line for.\u2019 \u201d\n Hearing these words, Weihan felt something twitch inside his chest.\n His mother, Qin Weiyue, was a teacher in the history department of one of Chang\u2019an\u2019s universities. In her free time, she liked to write light-hearted short essays for current affairs websites.\n It was Friday, and already quite late. Since she didn\u2019t need to work the next day, she was sitting in front of her computer thinking about what to write on next.\n When Weihan got back home, he was drunk, leaning on Han Dan. He had originally been planning to ply her with booze\u2014the better to extract the secrets of her past. He had become convinced that there was more to this young girl than met the eye. Only, Han Dan had quickly turned the tables on him\u2014the living incarnation of the God of Drinking, that girl!\n For her part, Weihan's mother was shocked to see the state her son was in\u2014well, probably any mother would be shocked to see her own son bringing back some floozy from the bar with him. But she was even more shocked to see who he had come home with.\n \u201cIs it really you?\u201d\n VIII. Home\n Weihan woke to find himself lying on the couch with a splitting headache from the booze.\n The moon hung low in the sky outside the window, a smoldering coal ember giving off a soft red glow. Only, the clock in the kitchen said that it was already nine o\u2019clock in the morning.\n \u201cYou up? Here, hangover cure,\u201d his mother said, handed him some pills.\n Weihan suddenly realized that the \u201cmoon\u201d was actually the extinguished artificial sun. The engineers had turned it off for an inspection. Artificial suns like this usually needed regular repairs every three years or so.\n Weihan hadn\u2019t been back in over a year, but even after all this time, the carnations that he\u2019d given his mother for his last visit were still sitting in the imitation Kangxi vase. The flowers had been specially treated so that they\u2019d never wilt.\n \u201cMom, will the Earth\u2019s sun ever go out?\u201d He sighed. \u201cNever mind. Who knows what the Earth is like now . . . \u201d In school, Weihan had been on the science and math track, so he hadn\u2019t learned much history.\n After a long pause, his mother finally said: \u201cMany years ago, the Earth starting using robots on a massive scale. Employees were fired and a long spell of high unemployment led to an even longer crime wave. After the \u2018criminals\u2019 were exiled to space only two types of \u2018people\u2019 were left on Earth: rich people and robots. And that\u2019s all I want to say about that.\u201d\n \u201cIn the end, though, didn\u2019t the robots rise up\u2014like the slaves of Sparta?\u201d he asked. \u201cI heard that by the time our military got there to save the day there wasn\u2019t much of anything left to save.\u201d\n His mother blanched.\n \u201cWhere did you hear about the rebellion?\u201d\n \u201cNo wall is without chinks through which the wind may pass,\u201d Weihan said. \u201cJust look at our planetships and you can figure it out. Even though we\u2019ve obviously already developed advanced artificial intelligence we still use human operators for all of the most critical jobs. Even steering the planetships themselves! It\u2019s hard to think of a more complicated job than that.\u201d\n Not having succeeded in prying anything out of Han Dan the night before, Weihan was forced to resort to plan B: stealing her notebook.\n He quietly opened the door to her room and, hearing nothing in response, tiptoed inside where he discovered Han Dan deep in thought in front of the computer.\n All the girls in the alliance seemed to be going nuts for the 3D mapping apps. They used them to zoom in on different locations and find where they could buy the cutest stuffed animals, or which pedestrian mall had the best snacks. Shopping destination set, off they\u2019d go.\n Han Dan was looking for a place to buy instruments\u2014she\u2019d lost her erhu on Phaeton.\n Han Dan chose the first erhu that caught her fancy and paid via their website. After carefully typing in the address of the restaurant she closed out the purchase window and zoomed out. The bustling streets flashed by, quickly becoming a spider\u2019s web of lanes and alleyways. Gradually, the flat plane of the map gave way to the convex outline of the planetship. Chang\u2019an had long since disappeared from sight, leaving only the blue of the ocean, the green of the continents, the white of the North Pole, and red-hot glow of the thrusters of the South Pole, as innumerable as they were massive.\n Continuing to zoom out, the planetship shrank into a tiny globe, small enough to be held in the palm of one\u2019s hand, with a long tail of ions streaming out behind it. Some of these, charged with electricity, lingered in the atmosphere of the South Pole, forming majestic auroras of green light. As the planetship continued to shrink, now the size of a soybean, other planetships began to appear on the screen, dozens of them, all moving through space in unison with Europa. Countless spacecraft scarcely the size of sesame seeds could be seen swimming in schools, as if fish, between the planetships.\n Han Dan manipulated the map with practiced ease, becoming so absorbed in the task at hand that she failed to detect Weihan\u2019s presence behind her.\n In the middle of the planetships a mass of what appeared to be a pool of mist or clouds could be seen. This was the famous \u201cShipyard\u201d of the Planetship Alliance. Outfitted with its own propulsion system, the Shipyard could move through the universe along with the planetships\u2014truly, they built nothing stationary.\n Han Dan zoomed in, and the clouds gradually resolved into distinct forms: countless fragments of ice and asteroids, along with space stations, and engineering ships. A large group of spacecraft were in the process of collecting nuclear waste, garbage, and chunks of space rock which another group was forming into an object the size of a small asteroid, perhaps ten kilometers in diameter. Of course, this wasn\u2019t the only planetship under construction in the Shipyard at the moment\u2014others were almost halfway complete, having begun to compress under the force of their own gravitational pull. The extreme heat of these embryonic planetships gave rise to rivers of liquid magma around continents of jet black rock, with their immature atmospheres rich in sulfur and carbon dioxide.\n On the more complete planetships, meanwhile, artificial suns had already been installed and seas of the deepest blue could be made out. Although their surfaces were still scalding hot, thunderstorms were already brewing in the dark clouds blocking their skies, the better to cool the nearly complete planetships. Rings of engineering ships could be made out, apparently preparing to impregnate the primordial seas with blue-green algae, origin of all life, while massive earthmovers prepared to move into action. In the distance, the badly damaged Phaeton could be seen limping back to the Shipyard to undergo repairs.\n Han Dan changed locations on the map so that she was now facing outward, toward the asteroid belt. Beyond it, further asteroid belts could be made out, not to mention a handful of planets. Most star systems had more than one asteroid belt\u2014the Solar System where they had come from had three. So broad, and so far-reaching, they seemed more like horizontal walls in the fabric of space and time itself, lacking clearly defined limits. A large number of warships could be seen stationed there, ready to destroy any asteroid that might threaten the planetships at a moment\u2019s notice.\n From the images on the screen it was doubtless that they found themselves in the wreckage of a massive supernova: in the midst of the ice-cold interstellar dust a collapsed neutron star spun in absolute isolation. From time to time they had been known to discover the remains of alien civilizations in places like this.\n It was starting to look like the meteor shower which had fallen on Planetship Phaeton several days earlier was but a drizzle before the storm. Han Dan opened her inbox where she found a new message waiting for her, addressed to her official station, \u201cAll Planetship High Command.\u201d Just as Han Dan was about to open the email, she finally realized that someone had been standing behind her all along. She spun around, feeling a cold shock run from her toes to her fingertips.\n Weihan froze, nailed to the spot.\n IX. The Alliance Awakens\n After the incident, it became obvious their remaining time together would not be long. In way of apology, Weihan pooled his meager savings from the previous week to buy a cheap necklace from a famous Chang\u2019an hawker\u2019s market.\n Under the star-filled sky of Riverside Park, the waters were silent and seemingly unmoving.\n \u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he said. Han Dan obliged him, and he fastened the necklace around her neck. Her skin was cold to the touch, practically corpse-like.\n \u201cI want to know who you are,\u201d he said.\n \u201cIf you want to know that, then you\u2019ll need to go way back at the beginning,\u201d Han Dan said. \u201cWhen mankind first began building the planetships, the nightmares of the recent past set the planners against the idea of building high-powered robots ever again . . .\n \u201cEventually they arrived at a compromise: they would develop an advanced cyborg operating system so that these augmented men might become the \u2018brains\u2019 of the planetships. The experiments were incredibly dangerous\u2014in the months before they found me, I was told that over one hundred volunteers died had for the cause. When the lead scientist reached out to me though, I said, \u2018Sure, why not? I\u2019m all alone in the world anyway, so it\u2019s not like anyone will miss me when I\u2019m gone.\u2019 \u201d\n Weihan understood what she meant. Han Dan was a drifter, so for her it might not be the worst thing in the world if the experiment failed. But instead it was a success . . . To live as a young girl without companionship for over a thousand years\u2014was this a blessing or a curse?\n After a long pause, Weihan said: \u201cThere\u2019s a neutron star just beyond the asteroid belt that we\u2019re passing through. But we aren\u2019t changing course.\u201d\n Neutron stars were known to rotate extremely quickly, sending off powerful radiation and having powerful electromagnetic fields. Although the gravitational pull of a neutron star was considerably less than that of a black hole, it was still enough to tear apart any spacecraft foolish enough to approach. Getting this close to a neutron star was an extremely dangerous maneuver to undertake on a whim.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve been studying neutron stars in our labs for a long time now. Our scientists are stuck, so we decided to capture a neutron star, study it, and make use of it. Just like when we opened the moon up for development thousands of years ago, or when we first landed on Mars, or when we finally completed our first-hand explorations of Jupiter. Each served as catalyst to propel our technological advancement ever higher.\u201d\n Weihan couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cBut our tech is already good enough . . . We\u2019ve survived this far in the universe, haven\u2019t we? It\u2019s stupid to risk everything like this for something that we don\u2019t even need!\u201d\n \u201cIf humanity had been willing to stay in the Stone Age eating raw flesh and drinking blood then there would have been no need for us to develop the technology to make fire, either,\u201d Han said, seeming to have been expecting his outburst. \u201cI once read that in before the 18th century the French Academy of Sciences was dead set on denying the existence of meteors. According to their best of science at the time, they believed that all of the stars and planets (including the sun) were made of gas, since solid objects were obviously heavier than air and therefore had no way of floating way up in the middle of nothing. Later on, when they developed better science not only did they accept the existence of asteroids, but they also came to understand that asteroids are incredibly common in the universe. Most terrifying of all, they discovered that the Earth, previously presumed to be a safe home for humanity, had actually been struck by asteroids many times in the past . . . And then, even later, without the \u2018unnecessary technology\u2019 of astronomy, when disaster struck in Czechoslovakia they wouldn\u2019t have had any idea what happened, never mind making the necessary preparations.\u201d\n Weihan paused. \u201cI-I think of you like a sister, Han Dan.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s an honor I can\u2019t accept,\u201d Han Dan replied after a long silence. In the moonlight, Weihan saw that Han Dan\u2019s eyes were filled with tears.\n He walked her to the bus stop and watched her get on a bus bound for North Seventh Avenue.\n After sending off Han Dan, Weihan went home to pack his bags. Walking past his parents\u2019 door he saw that it was shut tight. Instead of waking them, he tore a sheet of paper off the pad in the kitchen and scratched out a few lines. He stuck it on their door: \u201cDad, I\u2019m off to apply to military school.\u201d\n Looking up at the sky that night, the planetships seemed to have come alive. Their massive forms were suddenly as lively as a school of fish. Great thrusters accelerated in fits and starts, moving this way and that, weaving through the dense asteroid belt encircling the neutron star.\n X. Neutron Star\n After graduating from military school, Zheng Weihan became a pilot. Sitting in the cockpit of his star fighter and looking out on the crowded launch bay, he always felt as if at one with the planetship, depending on it for survival but also protecting it from danger.\n The planetships would soon emerge from the asteroid belt and the neutron star could be seen directly ahead now. Not surprisingly, the substantial gravity of the neutron star had attracted a number of large celestial bodies to its immediate proximity, indicating its advanced age.\n A fleet of research vessels were in orbit around the star, sending probe after probe into its yawning maw, while technicians hurriedly scrutinized the data sent back by the autonomous craft before they were completely destroyed. The gravitational pull was truly terrible to behold, strong enough to tear apart the very atomic bonds of any matter known to man, giving birth to the neutron by forging an unbreakable union of proton and electron.\n Only a short while earlier a research vessel had been lost, disappearing stern first into the great star without a trace. The scientists had borrowed a battle cruiser from the military, loosing firepower sufficient to destroy a planet onto the surface of the neutron star in the hope of studying its interior structure.\n To the naked eye, the explosion managed only to blast a shallow depression into the neutron star. Even so, the blast managed to badly upset its internal balance. Although it was only a tiny area it had a gravitational pull equivalent to that of the Earth. The celestial bodies formerly in orbit around the neutron star were thrown into disarray, with some flying off into the abyss like kites with cut strings while others crashed back into the neutron star as if on a sudden whim; most terrifying of all was when a planet roughly the size of Jupiter suddenly changed course, heading directly for Europa, home to the central command of the Planetship Alliance. It was only after a great investment of resources that the military had been able to avoid disaster.\n On the mothership, meanwhile, the logistics crew had just completed their overhauls. One by one, the fighters ignited their thrusters and blasted out of the hangar, tracing graceful trajectories in the inky black of the void as they waited to make formation. From his vantage point in the cockpit, Weihan enjoyed the view of the Odin, nucleus of the entire fleet. In mass, it was the size of the moon of old Earth, home berth to innumerable battle ships\u2014a great hornet\u2019s nest of military vessels of all shapes and size. Even so, Odin\u2019s impressive resources could not guarantee the safety of the planetships.\n XI. Return to Life\n On Planetship Europa, a long, narrow rupture had split Chang\u2019an into two separate cities. Some decades earlier, a fragment of a neutron star had grazed the outer crust of the planetship, nearly splitting the planetship in two with the force of its powerful kinetic energy. The wound had healed, but the scar remained, having since been transformed into a mighty river cutting horizontally through Chang\u2019an to the sea. The people of the city had built bridges spanning the wide gap, and planted trees and flowering shrubs along its banks, with grassy meadows in between. A great many planetships were marked with similar scars. Under the snowy blanket of each and every mighty peak, and below the thick forest canopy of every mountain dell, meteorite scars pocked the surface of the planetships.\n In the courtyard of a traditional Chinese home near Chang\u2019an\u2019s seaside district, a gray-haired Zheng Weihan sat in a rocking chair under a parasol tree, his eyes shut tight in quiet meditation. The epaulets on his military uniform bore the gold stars of a general. A young girl ran up from the seashore, carrying a glass jar filled with seawater.\n \u201cGrandfather,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me your life story.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell, really,\u201d Weihan said with a sigh. \u201cIf a regular soldier experiences enough war then he\u2019ll advance through the ranks, sure enough; as long you\u2019re able to survive to fight another day, then it\u2019s not anything out of the ordinary to be awarded the rank of general. Take Napoleon\u2019s Saint-Cyr Military School for example: of the four hundred or so graduates, the ones who didn\u2019t die on the battlefield pretty much all became generals.\u201d\n He wasn\u2019t wrong\u2014but of all the students who graduated from military school the same year as Weihan, only three or four were still alive today.\n The little girl winked mischievously.\n \u201cI heard grandma say that you only risked your life so that your rank would be high to go into the All Planetship High Command . . . \u201d\n Weihan thought back to his first day in that dark underground bunker: at the time he was so scared that he sat staring at the complex web of cables, strung like spider webs through the so-called \u201cbrain center\u201d of the Planetship Alliance\u2014and the one hundred or so people, known as the \u201cpathfinders\u201d to which the cables led.\n If a planetship could be said to be a living organism, then the pathfinders were its brain\u2014a brain made up of over a hundred brains linked up to form a single super-brain. Han Dan\u2019s sleeping form was easy to pick out among the pathfinders. In the cavernous hall of the \u201cbrain center\u201d she seemed even scrawnier than usual. Weihan wasn\u2019t trained in medicine, so he didn\u2019t have even the faintest clue what they\u2019d done to make it possible for Han Dan to stay alive for over a thousand years.\n The people who worked here were already used to thinking of the planetships more as evolved humans, rather than spacecraft. For the sake of survival, some of their number had no choice but to allow themselves to be transformed into a cyborg command center. Innumerable fiber optic cables and signal towers were arranged like nerves in the human body, linking them directly to every spacecraft in the fleet and joining the entire Planetship Alliance into an enormous, unified organism.\n In the ancient Earth Age, whether one looks at the goddess Gaea in the occidental tradition, or great spirit of Pangu in the oriental tradition, the people of the world all saw the land itself as an embodiment of the spiritual realm. History had taken a strange turn here, because the \u201cland\u201d beneath their feet\u2014the planetship\u2014was actually an embodiment of man himself, weaponized and developed with the most cutting-edge technology.\n After dissecting the neutron star, the Planetship Alliance had continued their slow journey through space, with a skeleton crew of \u201cpathfinders\u201d staying behind in the \u201cbrain center.\u201d Han Dan had proudly shouldered her beat-up old erhu and set off to wander the alliance\u2014as some might put it, she was \u201cobserving popular sentiment.\u201d Two months earlier she had returned from Planetship Africa to Europa, where she had been getting to know Weihan\u2019s granddaughter.\n It was the fifth day of the fifth lunar month\u2014Dragon Boat Festival. Some thousands of years earlier on this very day, Qu Yuan, educator and head of the three noble clans of the kingdom of Chu, had been driven to suicide. To celebrate his memory, the Zheng family had made a great many zongzi\u2014sticky rice balls with date or meat filling. Tradition held that the heartbroken people of Chu could throw zongzi into the river where Qu drowned himself, to entice the fish away from his corpse.\n And so, on a planetship drifting through space, Han Dan found herself throwing zongzi into the sea.\n \u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s a shame that after old school master Qu wrote Questions to Heaven with all those important scientific questions, nobody thought to take him seriously and figure out the answers. Otherwise our tech would\u2019ve developed way past where we are right now . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to throw zongzi into a river, not the ocean, you know,\u201d Weihan said.\n \u201cI know, I know. But the river is full of dragon boats today, and the banks are full of people. No room for little old me.\u201d\n \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever thought about finding somewhere to settle down?\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t everywhere home on a planetship?\u201d Han Dan said with a smile. \u201cThe planetships are my home. Our home.\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa, what\u2019s in here?\u201d Weihan\u2019s granddaughter said, handing him the jar of seawater.\n \u201cNothing right now,\u201d Weihan said.\n \u201cWrong!\u201d Han Dan said. \u201cThere\u2019s blue-green algae, humanity\u2019s oldest ancestor.\u201d\n \u201cLooks like grandpa should listen to big sis Han,\u201d his granddaughter said. \u201cWhen I grow up I wanna be a biologist.\u201d\n \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Weihan asked.\n His granddaughter leaned forward onto the armrest of the rocking chair and propped up her face with two hands.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about how that Earth planet we\u2019re always hearing about was like a desert island in the sea of space . . .\n \u201cBut we were also like a single-celled organism, you know? The whole ecosystem was one single cell. And now we\u2019ve evolved so that we can move around the universe and go wherever we want, like one great big space-dust eating animal.\n \u201cAren\u2019t you curious where we\u2019ll go next?\u201d\n Originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, 2007.\n Translated and published in partnership with Storycom.\n Luo Longxiang was born in 1981, deep in the mountains of Guangxi province on the China's southern border, where he studied Chemical Engineering at Guangxi University. After publishing his first sci-fi story in 2003, his fans began to refer to the mysterious author as \"Master Luo,\" in reference to his hermit-like existence far away from the crowded cities of the coast and northern plains. Of the eleven stories he was written over the past decade, six have earned a Milky Way Award. His works are known for their massive scope, dealing almost exclusively with the question of humanity's eventual survival in space. Since 2007, he has been working to complete the Planetship Alliance series--an epic space opera recounting the tragic history of mankind's colonization of the universe."}

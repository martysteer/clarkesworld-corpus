Hot, fast, loud, bright: the genre was made to be as disposable as the chemically-fueled rockets that had started putting objects into orbit just as rock was getting off the ground in the \u201950s.\n It\u2019s perhaps more than coincidence that the song generally considered to be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll tune was titled \u201cRocket 88\u201d\u2014a scorching instrumental by Ike Turner that, granted, was ostensibly an ode to an Oldsmobile. Still, even today the song takes off in a burst of fiery glory, one that most listeners back in the \u201950s surely assumed would destroy itself in a puff of faddish obsolescence.\n Of course, what \u201cRocket 88\u201d\u2014and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in general\u2014really did was this: open up a jagged, flaming path into the world of tomorrow.\n Science fiction served a similar purpose in the \u201950s. Having vaulted from the fringes of pop culture into the mainstream after a newly atomic America became obsessed with films about mutants and aliens, SF literature matured and flowered throughout the \u201960s and beyond, just as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did the same. It was inevitable that the two would mix. And although plenty of random rock songs in the \u201960s were fixated on SF themes\u2014including The Byrds\u2019 \u201cMr. Spaceman\u201d from 1966 and \u201cSpace Odyssey\u201d from 1968, not to mention Pink Floyd\u2019s groundbreaking \u201cSet the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\u201d also from 1968\u2014it was David Bowie\u2019s \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d in 1969 that really sealed the deal.\n Of course, Bowie would also be the artist to put the SF concept album on the map in the \u201970s. Full albums, after all, are much better vessels for SF\u2019s sprawling tropes. Since then, some bands have tried making bona fide, SF rock operas. Less ambitious groups have settled for loose concepts\u2014many dystopian\u2014for songs to revolve around. And some simply use the flash and fantasy of SF as a backdrop to their own warped vision of the future.\n Below are a few of the most intriguing SF-themed records launched at the unsuspecting public since Bowie made his first foray into the concept album. While many rock albums\u2014like The Alan Parson Project\u2019s I Robot or Golem\u2019s Dune-based The 2nd Moon\u2014base their narratives to some degree around existing SF works, the list below sticks with original concepts: the fevered output of a few dozen buzzing brains addled by feedback, distortion, beats, drugs and, of course, the ever-morphing futurism of science fiction.\n David Bowie, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972)\n For a record that launched a thousand bloated, SF-centric concept albums, David Bowie\u2019s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is pretty concise\u2014especially considering that title. In 38 minutes of apocalyptic surrealism rooted in the warped SF of Samuel R. Delany and William S. Burroughs, Ziggy Stardust tells the melancholic yet rapturous tale of a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll alien who comes to Earth during the five years prior to the apocalypse. While never matching his sweep and scope, other glam-rock artists of the era\u2014including Roxy Music, T. Rex, the doomed American singer Jobraith, and even Elton John with his hit \u201cRocket Man\u201d\u2014would share Bowie\u2019s love for glittery, gender-bending SF. After all, what\u2019s more androgynous than a spacesuit?\n Hawkwind, Space Ritual (1973)\n Progressive rock is synonymous with the concept album, but surprisingly few bands of the \u201970s prog movement actually made SF concept albums (Yes\u2019 unfocused yet excellent Tales from Topographic Oceans being a notable exception). The idiosyncratic Hawkwind was never entirely a prog band, but frontman Dave Brock and crew (which featured a pre-Mot\u00f6rhead Lemmy on bass) took their primal, interdimensional drone to its apex with Space Ritual. A double album that approximates what space travel might sound like if astronauts flew around in bong-shaped ships, Space Ritual even has some real SF credentials. Legendary author Michael Moorcock, a regular Hawkwind collaborator, delivers a metaphysical spoken-word piece titled \u201cBlack Corridor\u201d\u2014which just goes to show that his stentorian voice is just as grandiloquent in reality as it in on the page.\n Parliament, Mothership Connection (1975)\n \u201cA pimp sitting in a spaceship shaped like a Cadillac\u201d is the overall vibe George Clinton said he was aiming for with Mothership Connection, his masterpiece as the leader of the funk collective known as Parliament. Making Bowie and his brethren look downright bland by comparison, Clinton and company amped up the psychedelic, satirically cartoonish edge of Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s SF work (whether they realized it or not). The result is a cyberfunk phantasmagoria that refurbishes the interstellar void as a vast, cosmic dancefloor. Clinton continues to man the Mothership to this day, but this album is where he invented Funkier Than Light travel.\n Rush, 2112 (1976)\n Although this list is meant to focus on original works of SF music, it\u2019s hard to dismiss Rush\u2019s 2112 as a mere adaptation, despite the fact that it borrows blatantly from Ayn Rand\u2019s novel Anthem as well as two episodes\u2014\u201cWill the Real Martian Please Stand Up?\u201d and \u201cStopover in a Quiet Town\u201d\u2014of The Twilight Zone. In fact the latter example is even titled \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d But there\u2019s no denying that Rush\u2019s drummer and lyricist, Neil Peart, folded his SF influences into a unique and stunning work of sustained imagination that pairs the cosmic, dystopian, multi-suite epic \u201c2112\u201d with excellent yet unconnected tracks that showcase the band\u2019s prog chops, celestial melody, and philosophical waxing. Oh, and it rocks, too.\n Gary Numan and Tubeway Army, Replicas (1979)\n Glam, punk, and the robotic tones of Germany\u2019s groundbreaking electronic group Kraftwerk came together in the late \u201970s to form the basis of much of the new wave movement. But before bands like Duran Duran could chew that sound up into bubblegum in the \u201980s, some truly edgy artists mined that dark sonic domain\u2014one of the greatest being Gary Numan. His second album with Tubeway Army, Replicas, picks up on many of Philip K. Dick\u2019s themes of alienation and self-negation in the wake of runaway technology. He wasn\u2019t alone; at the same time Replicas was released, everyone from Klaus Nomi to Frank Zappa was using rock music to riff on androids as symbols of our dwindling humanity. Replicas\u2019 bleak depiction of artificial intelligence and metaphysical estrangement should be considered not only great pop music, but part of the cultural groundswell that resulted in the 1982 film, Bladerunner (Dick again, and \u201creplicants\u201d), and the cyberpunk explosion soon after.\n Styx, Kilroy Was Here (1983)\n Styx wasn\u2019t the first mainstream \u201970s rock band to tinker with SF after the \u201980s hit\u2014ELO beat them to it by two years with 1981\u2019s alien-abduction parable, Time\u2014but Styx set the standard for both excellence and excess with Kilroy Was Here. Capitalizing on the buildup to 1984, one of the most infamous years in the SF canon, Kilroy is singer-keyboardist Dennis DeYoung\u2019s over-the-top masterpiece. A rock \u2019n\u2019 roll dystopia, it casts the oppressed rocker Kilroy as Winston Smith from George Orwell\u2019s 1984, and the fascist leader Dr. Righteous as Big Brother. Bowie, of course, had already harvest Orwell\u2019s most famous novel for his 1974 album Diamond Dogs, but Kilroy was a symphonic, synthesizer-soaked update for the Moral Majority era. Really, though, it all boils down to the album\u2019s indelible hit single, \u201cMr. Roboto,\u201d a song that\u2019s more or less a rock opera unto itself.\n Jonzun Crew, Lost in Space (1983)\n While much of the SF community\u2014and the world at large\u2014debated just how close the real world was coming to resemble that of Orwell\u2019s 1984, Jonzun Crew figured partying might be a healthier reaction. Picking up where George Clinton\u2019s P-Funk crew left off (not that P-Funk ever really stopped), Jonzun Crew was part of an entire electro movement that married hardcore synthesizers and hip-hop into a sleek, chilling, yet wholly fun music. Granted, some electro groups like Time Zone and Cybotron were a bit gloomier, but Jonzun Crew\u2019s SF-steeped Lost in Space struck the perfect balance between the nightmare of the future and the hangover of tomorrow.\n Planet P Project, Pink World (1984)\n Double albums were pretty much a dim memory of the \u201970s in the slim, trim world of 1984. And yet Tony Carey\u2019s Planet P Project decided that year was when the massive, 26-song Pink World needed to be unleashed. It failed to make the mark he\u2019d hoped, but the album\u2019s cult status persists, and for good reason. Although taking the name of his project from Planet P in Robert Heinlein\u2019s Starship Troopers, Carey\u2014like the SF world itself in 1984\u2014had focused past the trite, tired tropes of space opera and tapped into the terrifying realms of inner space and the near future. Mixing the iciness of new wave with the chops, pomp, and circumstance of prog, Pink World remains a dizzying and literate SF vision.\n Queensr\u00ffche, Operation: Mindcrime (1988)\n The spacefaring Hawkwind inspired many of the early metal bands, but it wasn\u2019t until 1988 that the metal world truly embraced the idea of the SF concept album. Voivod\u2019s brutal Dimension Hatr\u00f6ss is one such record that came out that year, but the more stunning example is Operation: Mindcrime by Queensr\u00ffche. Melodic, immaculate, and surprisingly coherent for a concept album, Mindcrime is a speculative thriller about a heroin-addicted political dissident whose brain is rewired for assassination. Despite the ups and downs metal has suffered since the rise of grunge in the early \u201990s, Operation: Mindcrime has remained a touchstone of the genre, even inspiring a serviceable sequel in 2006, Operation: Mindcrime II.\n Donald Fagen, Kamakiriad (1993)\n The \u201990s were a tough time for the SF concept album (no, we\u2019re not counting Billy Idol\u2019s 1993 flop, Cyberpunk). Ironically, it took an old guy to remind everyone about the future. Donald Fagen of Steely Dan released his sophomore solo album, Kamakiriad, in 1993, and while it sounds as breezy yet sophisticated as your typical Steely Dan classic, it turned out to be a high-concept, cyberpunk travelogue through a virtual world of Fagen\u2019s device, one that seems to tap into both J.G. Ballard and Neal Stephenson. (Another old guy, one David Bowie, would usher out the \u201990s with another SF concept album\u20141999\u2019s Outside\u2014that would set the stage for the format\u2019s wild resurgence in the following decade.)\n Deltron 3030, Deltron 3030 (2000)\n Hip-hop producer Dan the Automator already had one SF concept album\u2014Dr. Octagon\u2019s scattershot Dr. Octagonecologist\u2014under his belt when he undertook 2000\u2019s self-titled album with Deltron 3030. With rapper Del tha Funkee Homosapian on the mike, the disc is a rich, multilayered, post-apocalyptic storyline whose polyglot music actually sounds like a new configuration of the future\u2014that is, exactly what the year 2000 direly needed. To paraphrase Del himself in the song \u201c3030,\u201d the album is a \u201cperfect blend of technology and magic.\u201d The track \u201cTime Keeps on Slipping,\u201d which features guest vocals from Damon Albarn of Brit-pop traditionalists Blur, set the stage for Dan\u2019s and Albarn\u2019s massively successful \u201cvirtual band,\u201d Gorillaz\u2014a group that released its own futureshock concept album, Plastic Beach, in 2010.\n Coheed and Cambria, The Amory Wars (2000-on)\n The most ambitious SF story arc to ever be attempted in the rock arena, Coheed and Cambria\u2019s The Amory Wars, is not an album but an entire epic that spans almost every song the band has released since its early days as an unknown group called Delirium Trigger. A few random, early songs introduced the characters of Coheed and Cambria Kilgannon and their messianic son, Claudio\u2014who just so happens to share a first name with Claudio Sanchez, the frontman of Coheed and Cambria. Unlike fellow post-hardcore practitioners My Chemical Romance, who have tried the concept-album thing with less success, Sanchez and crew are now five albums deep into the Amory Wars storyline. Besides spawning a comic book, the latest release in the arc, Year of the Black Rainbow, spun off into a novel that Sanchez co-wrote with Peter David. Sanchez\u2019s Star Wars-meets-Dune story has its faults, but paired with the band\u2019s soaring, anthemic, neo-progressive rock, it\u2019s as close to concept-album heaven as the SF world has come.\n The Flaming Lips, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (2002)\n Sometimes the first symptom of addiction to concept albums is denial. That definitely seems to be the case with The Flaming Lips\u2019 Wayne Coyne, who followed his band\u2019s cinematic record The Soft Bulletin with something even more solidly narrative: Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Coyne has flatly denied that Yoshimi is a concept album, and certainly it wanders from the narrative quite a bit. However, there\u2019s no denying that, at its core, the record is a sculpted, symphonic, indie-rock parable full of the kind of pop-culture pastiche Cory Doctorow would be proud to call his own.\n Nine Inch Nails, Year Zero (2007)\n Many of SF\u2019s most horrifying predictions about the future have come true, in one form or another since 2001. Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Trent Reznor used the specters of perpetual war, terrorism, societal disintegration, and overall dystopia as fodder for Year Zero, a concept album that details militaristic oppression in the not-so-far-flung future of 2022. Compared to NIN classics like The Downward Spiral, Year Zero is jagged, guttural, and oozing paranoia\u2014a high-tech yet visceral scenario that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a Richard K. Morgan thriller.\n The Lisps, Futurity (2009)\n Steampunk-associated acts like Rasputina and Sleepytime Gorilla Museum are as fueled by gleeful anachronism as the genre itself. But the Arcade Fire-influenced, Brooklyn-based outfit The Lisps took things a few steps further with Futurity. Rather than an album per se, Futurity is a full-length stage musical the band produced in 2009\u2014the story of a Civil War soldier and science fiction writer beset by hallucinatory visions of the future. With the same melting-pot abandon used by novelists like Cherie Priest and Brian Francis Slattery, The Lisps have crafted an indie-rock opera that combines vintage Americana with mind-bending weirdness. Now they just need to record the damn thing.\n Mastodon, Crack the Skye (2009)\n Heavy metal made a huge comeback in the \u201900s, and so did the space opera. It only makes sense that the two would converge sooner or later. Mastodon, one of the heaviest yet most complex figureheads of today\u2019s metal scene, used their latest record, Crack the Skye, as an opportunity to explore the darkest reaches of the universe\u2014and of reality itself. It\u2019s an overblown album, but gloriously so. Based around a paraplegic protagonist who travels the cosmos via astral projection, it\u2019s more Arthur C. Clarke than Alastair Reynolds. But the metaphysical aspect of the story doesn\u2019t dim the fact that Crack the Skye revels in the rich tradition of the SF concept album\u2014including a \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d\u2014influenced video for the single \u201cOblivion\u201d that brings everything full circle.\n Fads and styles in music and SF come and go, but one thing is a constant: musicians will probably be trying to perfect the amalgamation of the rock album and the science-fiction novel for as long as there is such a thing as the future.\n Jason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

Since then he\u2019s received more award recognitions than can reasonably be listed in this column, from an Asimov\u2019s Readers\u2019 Poll win for 2015\u2019s \u201cLock Up Your Chickens and Daughters\u2014H\u2019ard and Andy are Come to Town!\u201d to the 2008 Locus Award-winning short story \u201cA Small Room in Koboldtown.\u201d Other award-winning stories include \u201cThe Edge of the World\u201d (1990 Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award), \u201cRadio Waves\u201d (1996 World Fantasy Award), \u201cSlow Life\u201d (2003 Hugo Award), and \u201cLegions in Time\u201d (2004 Hugo Award). To date he has published over 150 short stories.\nSwanwick is an accomplished novelist, publishing In the Drift (1985), Vacuum Flowers (1987), Nebula-winner Stations of the Tide (1991), Griffin\u2019s Egg (1991), The Iron Dragon\u2019s Daughter (1993), Jack Faust (1997), Bones of the Earth (2002), and The Dragons of Babel and The Iron Dragon\u2019s Mother 2008 and 2019, set in the world of The Iron Dragon\u2019s Daughter. Darger and Surplus books Dancing with Bears, Chasing the Phoenix, and collection The Postutopian Adventures of Darger and Surplus came out with Night Shade in 2011, Tor in 2015, and Subterranean Press in April of 2020, respectively.\nHe\u2019s well-regarded for nonfiction, such as 2001\u2019s Being Gardner Dozois, his book-length interview with Dozois, which won a Locus Award for nonfiction. Other works include essays \u201cA User\u2019s Guide to the Postmoderns\u201d and \u201cIn the Tradition . . . \u201d which were collected as The Postmodern Archipelago in 1997. He penned biographical works Hope-in-the-Mist (2009) and What Can Be Saved from the Wreckage?: James Branch Cabell in the Twenty-first Century (2007).\nNovel City Under the Stars, a follow-up to novella \u201cThe City of God\u201d (originally published in Omni Online in 1995), is due from Tor.com publishing in August of 2020, cowritten with award-winning editor, author, and friend to Swanwick, Gardner Dozois, who died May 27, 2018.\nMichael Swanwick was born in Schenectady, NY. He received a BA from The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA. He\u2019s been a full-time writer since 1983 and lives in Philadelphia with his wife, Marianne Porter, and their son, Sean.\nIn your 2009 Locus interview you said, \u201cI worry about the future of books.\u201d You talked about gaming and the Internet, and their impact on the reading habits of your son and his peers. Do you still worry about the future of books? Or have your thoughts on this changed since then?\nI still worry. People are spending more time staring at screens than ever before and, to be honest, the intellectual and artistic content of games and television is vastly greater than it was even eleven years ago, never mind when I was a teen.\nIn the nineteenth century, poetry was important in ways it is now difficult to imagine. Longfellow and Tennyson were world-famous celebrities. Today . . . well, at parties, I sometimes challenge the guests to come up with the names of ten living poets. It gives you an enormous feeling of accomplishment if your group can do it.\nI can readily imagine a world in which fiction writers have exactly as much chance of making a living at their craft as poets do today, one in which most of their readers are other writers scouting out the competition\u2014and it\u2019s not that far away.\nI\u2019m rooting for me to be wrong on this one.\nYour first published story was \u201cThe Feast of Saint Janis\u201d in 1980, and you\u2019ve been publishing fairly consistently since, with your more recent titles, The Iron Dragon\u2019s Mother, The Postutopian Adventures of Darger and Surplus, and the upcoming City Under the Stars due in August. Do you feel like your writing\u2014craft, process, or both\u2014has changed in any specific or significant ways over the past decade or two?\nI have been writing constantly for forty years and everything I finish gets published. So it\u2019s inevitable that I would learn a few things about my craft along the way.\nOne thing that\u2019s changed is that my writing has gotten more concise. When I began, it took me twelve thousand words to write a substantive story. Now I can do it in four thousand. Considering that I\u2019m paid by the word, that may not have been very clever of me.\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed is that I can\u2019t finish a story until I figure out what it means\u2014what it wants to be. So one of my stories can take years to finish. On the other hand, I wrote \u201c\u2018Hello,\u2019 Said the Stick\u201d in less than twenty-four hours because I knew from the start what it was about\u2014and it went on to place on the Hugo ballot that year. It lost, but the story that won was also one of mine, so that was okay.\nYou deal in different genres, light fantasy to hard SF. Will readers find a consistent voice and style running through your work, especially over the decades?\nThe story is everything. My job is to make it be the best version of itself possible.\nIf you look at writing in strictly commercial terms, your best bet is to find one thing and write it over and over. This can have good results\u2014look at Patrick O\u2019Brian\u2019s Aubrey-Maturin books. But that is not how I want to spend my life. My recent stories feature a world existing on a storm cloud, a hotel in the form of a living dragon, and a trickster who\u2019s stolen the universe and hidden it in a cigar box. I\u2019ve written a ghost story in which every word of it, save for the names, is true; one that begins with the protagonist dying and then proceeds backward in time to the beginning of the tale; and one that was written a word at a time on fallen autumn leaves. You can\u2019t do any of that if you\u2019re worried about voice, or consistency, or anything else other than what the story wants to be.\nWhat does it take to stay relevant and sell books/stories and still remain part of the genre conversation?\nYou have to read the stories being written by your competition\u2014and not just those of your peers who are still getting published, but the young writers as well. If you\u2019re not willing to learn from a twenty-something gender-fluid newcomer with a strange haircut, well, you\u2019re in the wrong business.\nIt helps to keep up with current science as well.\nYou were writing for years before you started selling, and then your career started, helped by Gardner Dozois. Did you ever hit a career slump or a writing slump after you started selling, where you struggled to sell work or to produce work? And if so, what did you do to deal with those situations?\nI sold my first three stories one after the other\u2014and promptly hit a writer\u2019s block that lasted nine months, during which I wrote voluminously and had to throw away every word of it. During that period, I turned thirty, lost my job, and got married. It was terrifying. But I got around it by writing every day for as many hours of free time as I could find. Eventually, my hindbrain got the message that not giving me anything usable wasn\u2019t going to get it out of sitting in front of a typewriter and the flow of ideas started up again.\nSometimes, when things got rough, I\u2019d ask Gardner what to do. Inevitably, what he said would boil down to \u201cJust keep writing.\u201d Nobody\u2019s ever given better writing advice than that.\nWhich of your stories stand out in your memory, for you, as some of your finest work, and why?\nIt\u2019s always the latest one\u2014because all its virtues are freshest in the mind. At this moment, it\u2019s \u201cArtificial People.\u201d I sketched it out on the program during a Lyric Fest concert at the Academy of Vocal Arts, pairing songs on beginnings and endings. The composers had taken poems and turned them to music. Now I was turning music into fiction. Dare I hope that fifty years from now someone will translate my work into an as-yet-un-invented art form?\nFor novels, the same thing applies. My latest, The Iron Dragon\u2019s Mother, completes a trilogy of stand-alone novels begun twenty-five years before with The Iron Dragon\u2019s Daughter. To maintain a consistent vision of the world\u2014both the invented one of Industrialized Faerie, and our own, which the novels comment on\u2014is a glorious thing. The first volume was written as a fantasy and received by many as an anti-fantasy. The second was, in response, written to turn all the conventions of conventional fantasy on their head and was received as a fantasy. The third was written as a fantasy and received as such. So the three, taken together, serve as an analysis and critique of the genre that\u2014and I hope this is obvious in them\u2014I love dearly.\nCity Under the Stars follows up on 1995 novella \u201cThe City of God.\u201d What are the challenges to completing something begun so long ago, and how do you deal with those challenges?\nFrom the beginning, Gardner and I meant for \u201cThe City of God\u201d to be the opening section of a novel. This was important because the very first pages established that we were telling an extremely grim story with no possibility of a happy outcome. But Gardner had a happy, even joyous, ending for the novel and a path that would take us to it.\nWe planned to write two more novellas, \u201cThe City of Angels\u201d and \u201cThe City of Men,\u201d then combine all three into a novel. Unfortunately, we were both extremely busy, and it wasn\u2019t until a year or two ago that we found the time to work on it. Consistency of tone wasn\u2019t hard\u2014Gardner had a lush, beautiful prose style, and the novel leaned heavily on that. We got to work and were making good time. We were really tearing up the boards.\nThen Gardner died.\nThere went our plan. There was no way I could write the third novella without Gardner\u2019s ideas, his presence, and above all his prose lines. I could do a passable imitation of him, but that\u2019s all it would have been, an imitation. Readers deserve better than that.\nBut I wanted the world to see the ending Gardner had in mind. I wanted everyone to know he went out on a high note. So I changed the direction of the second novella, threw out several subplots, and rewrote it so that Hanson, the protagonist, arrived at the ending sooner. Then I combined the two and broke them into chapters so that it was a real novel, rather than two novellas, one after the other.\nIt\u2019s not the novel we would have written had Gardner lived. But it\u2019s not all that far off from it.\nWhen I read the description\u2014Hanson works ten solid back-breaking hours a day, shoveling endless mountains of coal, within sight of the iridescent wall that separates what\u2019s left of humanity from their gods\u2014I think of Sisyphus, but as allegory to modern-day labor. Are there deliberate sociopolitical commentaries involved\u2014and if so, have those commentaries changed since the first book? Or is this really just about cool visuals and coming up with a character\u2019s personal struggle?\nGardner Dozois came from a blue-collar background and was painfully aware of the degree to which the odds were stacked against him. When he graduated from high school, with no encouragement from his guidance counselor, he applied to exactly one college and, when he was rejected, enlisted in the army because that was his only other option. He knew exactly what kind of life society expected him to have. So, yeah, Hanson is looking at society from the vantage of the underclass.\nGardner was not a political writer. To him, the question of power, of who\u2019s the boss and who\u2019s the victim, was a visceral one. In his notes for the second half of the novel, he wrote, \u201cI think that if Hanson ever was given the ultimate power, as indeed he is given it for a few minutes at the end of the story, the thing that might keep him from being too destructive with it is this horror that he might himself turn into a boss. That\u2019s the last thing he wants to do is to turn into a boss. Because he\u2019s seen that from the other side.\u201d Gardner\u2019s experiences in life did not fill him with admiration of the rich and powerful.\nAnd I have to say I agree with him on this front. Eat the rich!\nGary K. Wolfe, in his Locus review of The Postutopian Adventures of Darger and Surplus, describes the world as \u201cboth richer and darker than would seem necessary for the essentially comic capers . . . \u201d; City Under the Stars presents \u201ca post-utopian hellhole,\u201d and you described the first book as \u201ca very dark story, even for Gardner Dozois.\u201d What is the appeal of dark narratives and worlds? What do stories with these features do for readers and writers?\nIt\u2019s not that I like darkness, but that a writer has an obligation to tell the truth. The truth is that this can be a hard world at times. I\u2019ve led a charmed life. I have a functional career in a business where that isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m still in love with the woman I married forty years ago, and we have a son who means the world to us. Yet I\u2019ve also known heartbreak and loss. Terrible things have happened. This is true of most people and maybe all people. Life is not for wusses. There might as well be a sign by the womb exit reading: HEROES ONLY.\nWe are all descended from thousands of generations of those heroes. That\u2019s why we can respond positively to dark narratives and worlds. We evolved to endure them and even to, sometimes, triumph over them. When we do this vicariously, through fiction, we\u2019re exercising a muscle we might very well need someday.\nWhat is important or special about City Under the Stars? What do you really want readers to know about this book?\nMost people know Gardner Dozois solely as a brilliant editor. But he was an even more brilliant writer. His peers, people like Joe Haldeman and George R. R. Martin, were in awe of him. Alas, he found the novel a difficult form and only wrote three of them (two of which were collaborations) in his lifetime. Consequently, that was the accomplishment he esteemed highest. So finishing the one we were working on when he died, giving him one last novel, was an act of fraternal piety for me.\nCity Under the Stars is a memorial to Gardner and a reminder to the world of what a fine writer was lost when he died.\nAlso, as I said, it has a happy ending. Gardner could be a very bleak writer indeed, and City Under the Stars contains some of his bleakest writing. But the last thing he was working on was upbeat. He may not have liked bosses much, but he was optimistic about ordinary people. In the long run, he thought maybe they would prevail.\nWhat else are you working on now, and what do you have coming up that you can tell us about?\nStories, stories, stories, and a few essays. I\u2019m currently in the research phase for my next novel and writing lots of short fiction. My short stories should be popping up all over the place for the next year or so. The essays will appear in the usual obscure magazines and journals. I\u2019m also rehabbing an old wooden master plumber\u2019s cabinet and plan to write stories for the back of the door and the insides of the drawers. But that\u2019s just for my own amusement.\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

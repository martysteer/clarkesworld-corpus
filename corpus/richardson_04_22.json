I can come back for a weekend, but they don\u2019t call me back for every little thing. So when Mom did call me at work in the middle of the day and said, \u201cYour father is acting weird,\u201d I feared for the worst.\n\u201cNursing home, power of attorney weird?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat kind of weird?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s building something in the backyard,\u201d said Mom. \u201cI can see it now through the window. It\u2019s like a hobbit hole with a little wooden door. And he won\u2019t admit that it\u2019s not a normal thing to be building.\u201d\n\u201cIs he working on it right now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s out on a job, but the hobbit hole is out there, staring at me like a thing of evil.\u201d\n\u201cCan you send me a picture?\u201d\nAfter three minutes of Mom mobile-phone fumbling I received a picture taken through the kitchen window. The back lawn was completely torn up, and the yard now dominated by a mound of earth, given structure by plastic netting and chicken wire. The concrete walkway leading out of the laundry room, which I\u2019d helped Dad lay when I was a kid, went right to a wooden door in the mound and disappeared. The mound stretched across the yard to abut the old tire swing/pi\u00f1ata tree. The uprooted sundial leaned against the wall of the garage.\n\u201cThat is really ugly.\u201d\n\u201cHe says it\u2019ll look okay once the grass seed grows. I just want to know why he\u2019s doing this. He didn\u2019t consult me, and he won\u2019t talk about it. He didn\u2019t get it from a magazine.\u201d\n\u201cJust ask him.\u201d\n\u201cHe changes the subject.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t let him change the subject.\u201d\n\u201cI have to live with him, Carlos.\u201d\nI zoomed in. \u201cIs that thing hollow?\u201d I tried to imagine the structural mechanics.\n\u201cYeah, hobbit hole, like I said. You could crawl inside.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come down tonight and work from your place tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cSaturday\u2019s fine, why rush it? Frodo\u2019s house isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\nI got in Saturday afternoon and was finishing off some still-warm lunch leftovers when Dad came in from an emergency call. \u201cHey, Carlos, let\u2019s hit the Home Depot, whaddaya say?\u201d were his first words to me.\n\u201cStuff for the . . . mound?\u201d I said. I could see it from the table, the packed dirt muddy from a morning shower.\n\u201cThe electric drill needs a new battery pack,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to mount the new TV up on the wall.\u201d The \u201cnew\u201d TV dated from the previous Black Friday, and I\u2019d seen it on the way in, overflowing the VHS-era TV stand.\n\u201cIf you just need one thing, let\u2019s order now and do curbside pickup.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, son. I\u2019ll be in the car.\u201d Mom gave me a conspiratorial glare: you\u2019ll see. As soon as I clicked my seat belt, Dad gave me the exact same look. He leaned over as if about to impart to me one of his big secrets of being a man.\n\u201cCarlos, I\u2019m glad you came down this weekend, because I want to talk to you about something.\u201d\n\u201cThis is about the mound, right?\u201d\n\u201cThis is about your mother, who has been doing weird Internet searches.\u201d We pulled out of the driveway and headed for the freeway.\n\u201cLike \u2018How to kill your husband because he won\u2019t talk about the mound he\u2019s building\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s searching for videos,\u201d said Dad. \u201cShe leaves them open on the computer. They have these weird titles, symbols instead of letters. I don\u2019t even know how she types the symbols to do the searches. And, she\u2019s started making weird noises when she thinks I can\u2019t hear her.\u201d\n\u201cAre the \u2018noises\u2019 Chinese?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs she learning Chinese?\u201d\n\u201cNo! They\u2019re like dog noises. And when I mention it to her, she acts like it never happened.\u201d\n\u201cNobody likes being told they\u2019re making weird noises.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been married for thirty years! If I say she\u2019s making some noises, she should be able to handle it. When you got out of your diaper and shit on the kitchen floor, I said, \u2018Your son shit on the floor,\u2019 and she said, \u2018He\u2019s your son, clean it up.\u2019 She didn\u2019t change the subject.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a recording of the noises?\u201d\n\u201cI have to live with her, Carlos. If I record her, then it becomes all about \u2018why did you do that?\u2019\u201d\nDad took a breath and started to scheme. \u201cHere\u2019s what we do. Around five p.m. she\u2019ll start making dinner. You get on the computer and figure out why she\u2019s searching for these videos.\u201d\n\u201cDid you watch any of the videos?\u201d I said.\n\u201cThese fucking weekend drivers, man.\u201d Dad honked the horn. \u201cHey!\u201d\nYou can get a battery pack for an electric drill at Home Depot. They try to make it easy. But the battery pack has to be your actual goal, and for Dad it was more of a pretext. He grabbed hold of a big orange jungle gym cart and pushed it over to the outdoor gardening annex, where he took his time choosing between different types of fiberboard planks. Then six cubic feet of a steer manure/compost blend, to improve the soil atop the mound.\n\u201cI thought we were just here to get a battery,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSince you\u2019re here, you can help me with the heavy stuff,\u201d said Dad.\n\u201cDad, this is bullshit.\u201d\n\u201cWe call it steer manure.\u201d\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. This is for the mound.\u201d\n\u201cHelp me load up!\u201d He\u2019d heard me, but he was ignoring what I said. He\u2019d done this my whole life, but never about something so obvious.\nOn the way back, the pickup loaded up with lumber and plastic sheeting and bagged bullshit, I looked through old family texts. A couple weeks earlier Dad had posted something to our WhatsApp group that seemed weird in retrospect:\nCarlos, is there a site where you can draw a shape and see the emoji that looks like that shape?\nAttached was a photo of a piece of paper on which Mom had drawn an alphabet of slightly different circles. Some had a protrusion sticking out at one angle or another, like a clock with only one hand. Others were circles that overlapped or enclosed in some way.\nI\u2019d assumed it was a craft project. I\u2019d poked around the Internet, sent them a link that let you search for characters that couldn\u2019t be typed on a keyboard, and that had been the end of it.\nMy parents had always been passive-aggressive, but this took it to another level. Why had Dad used the family chat to ask me to help Mom figure out how to type in the symbols for the weird video searches he was now asking me to investigate?\nDad was tapping the steering wheel and singing under his breath. I shifted my eyes, not looking up from my phone. \u201cTwo spacesuits . . . da-dadada cata-catalyze two spacesuits . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh?\u201d Dad blinked at the sun a couple times like I\u2019d startled him out of falling asleep at the wheel. \u201cJohnny Cash song.\u201d\n\u201cJohnny Cash wrote a song about spacesuits?\u201d\n\u201cHe did a lot of weird songs in the seventies. Did you ever hear the one where he steals a Cadillac?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I heard it one million times growing up.\u201d Needless to say, there is no Johnny Cash song about spacesuits. Dad had told me an obvious lie about something trivial.\nDad backed the pickup into the garage driveway. He opened the driver\u2019s side door and swung out, grabbing the little Home Depot bag that held our small items: the battery pack and some boxes of screws. Dad walked around to the front door of the house, ignoring the back gate (which would have taken us past the Mound That Must Not Be Named) and leaving everything sitting in the bed of the pickup, waiting to be stolen by some larcenous neighbor.\nI scampered after Dad. In the living room he pointed at the big flat-screen teetering on its stand and said, \u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 on the wall!\u201d in a John Wayne voice. Then he walked all the way through the house and out the laundry room into the backyard, still holding the little plastic bag.\n\u201cDad?\u201d I said. I shut the front door behind me.\n\u201cCome in here, Carlos, quick!\u201d Mom called me from the kitchen. Through the window she pointed at Dad, who\u2019d walked around the mound and out the back gate, right back to the pickup. He opened the tailgate and started unloading the lumber into the garage, where he kept the woodshop.\nI washed my hands in the sink. \u201cWhy did he take that weird path?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike he was going to mount the TV and just decided not to.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s going to work on his hobbit hole the rest of the weekend,\u201d said Mom. Mushrooms sizzled in the frying pan. Chicken breasts sat on paper towels.\n\u201cShould I not have gone with him? Am I enabling him?\u201d\n\u201cYou did the right thing. You need to see what\u2019s going on. He won\u2019t talk about it with you either?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d bring it up, and he\u2019d jump the conversation somewhere else. What\u2019s inside the hole?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Dirt? Gross things?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d I asked her. \u201cChicken stew?\u201d\n\u201cChicken risotto. It\u2019s easy, I don\u2019t have to concentrate.\u201d\n\u201cYou hate risotto.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I got tired of making it because you wanted it all the time,\u201d said Mom. \u201cI can do it once in a while.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do some phone calls in the study and ask around about this mound thing.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take over the study, let me get my book out first.\u201d\nAlthough I allowed my mother to imagine that I could pull some strings and contact top psychologists who studied abnormal male mound-building, I had no strings to pull and no intention of making any calls. Instead, after closing the study door, I quietly opened up the family web browser and, with a certain amount of guilt, started spying on my parents\u2019 search history. They shared a Google account, so everyone\u2019s search results were mixed up: moisture sensor app and is Mary Kay a scam? and oldest possible scotch and how to catalyze two spacesuits and Sidney Center performances Zoom and \u22b6\u229a\u2237\u22b60\u2218\u229a\u221d\u22b6\u2218\u03bf\u00ba\u2218\u2022\u221d\u2298\u039f and anniversary songs.\nDad is wrong about a lot of things, but he wasn\u2019t making up the searches. I reran the search for \u22b6\u229a\u2237\u22b60\u2218\u229a\u221d\u22b6\u2218\u03bf\u00ba\u2218\u2022\u221d\u2298\u039f. I got zero web results and twenty-three video results, all with that exact title.\nThe previews showed what you\u2019d expect in a YouTube video: poorly lit people in bland suburban houses facing the camera, about to tell you something generic. I clicked on a representative thumbnail. A white man in his forties was showing me around his garage. Plastic sheeting and fiberboard planks leaned against the wall\u2014apart from the steer manure, the same things in the same quantities Dad had just bought at Home Depot. The man spoke in disjointed sentences about the \u201chabitat\u201d he was building. His voice was quiet and gentle, mismatched against his mustache and his beer gut.\nAfter counting off his fiberboard planks, the man in the video dropped a Lowe\u2019s bag onto his workbench and started pulling out screws of different sizes, counting them out into five different piles. At this point it became obvious that unlike most YouTube videos, \u22b6\u229a\u2237\u22b60\u2218\u229a\u221d\u22b6\u2218\u03bf\u00ba\u2218\u2022\u221d\u2298\u039f had a camera operator. The camera operator wasn\u2019t exactly helping, mind you. They were making low growling noises, distracting noises that made it hard to hear the clink of the screws and the muttered counting of the man with the mustache.\nIt was a freaked-out dad version of a YouTube haul video. I\u2019ve been known to flop on the couch and watch some bro open a dozen blind-bags of anime figurines. It helps me feel better about not being able to afford all the crap that goes along with modern life. But Dad had seen this haul video and treated it like a shopping list. You\u2019re not supposed to buy this stuff yourself. Watching the video is supposed to scratch the itch.\nIt was pretty short for a haul video, about three minutes, and of course once it was over, YouTube really wanted me to launch right into another, similar video. About half of the recommended videos had titles in the weird circle language, but the other half were in English:\n- HOW TO SEARCH FOR CATALYST AND HABITAT VIDEOS\u2014TUTORIAL\n- Sex Will Catalyze Two Spacesuits!\n- Typing the symbols on human keyboards (ENGLISH/USA)\n- This Chemical Gel Will Catalyze Two Spacesuits\u2014No Fail!\n- My Other Spacesuit Died! HELP!!!!\n- MIT Grad Shows How To Catalyze Two Spacesuits\n- BEWARE OF SCAMS!\u2014Only Completion Of The Habitat Can Catalyze Spacesuits\n- CATALYZE WITH SURGERY\u2014DIY\u2014STEP BY STEP\u2014PART 1/4\nSwallowing both guilt and horror, I clicked into my parents\u2019 shared email account. There were hundreds of unread messages from stores and mailing lists, which I\u2019d been expecting, but the draft folder was also full of unsent emails. I clicked through; Mom and Dad had been using the drafts folder to send video links to each other. Dozens of them.\nDad\u2019s messages to Mom had the somewhat stilted air he used when writing Post-it notes. He\u2019d never really gotten used to email:\nM,\nI think we should try sex. It makes logical sense.[link to \u201cSex Will Catalyze Two Spacesuits!\u201d video]\nWith love,\nP\nThat one I didn\u2019t need to see, but you can\u2019t blame me for stumbling on it. Dad had never sent an email that didn\u2019t look like this: a comment, a link, a profession of love. The other messages\u2014presumably the ones from Mom to Dad\u2014had no text, just a bare link to a video on YouTube or Youku.\n\u201cAre you on the computer?\u201d Mom put her hands on my shoulders, and I jumped out of my skin. \u201cCome in and help with the salad.\u201d\n\u201cMom, what is this? Why do you have all these unsent emails?\u201d\nThe confused look on Mom\u2019s face made it completely clear she hadn\u2019t known you could write an email and not send it. \u201cThere must be spyware on the computer,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you remember when you helped us?\u201d\n\u201cI helped you by installing a bunch of things that stop spyware from getting on the computer.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe tomorrow you could take another look?\u201d It was the same kind of bald-faced lie Dad had come up with in the car . . . but it was also the honest best she could do to make sense of what she was seeing. \u201cC\u2019mon. Salad.\u201d\nI followed Mom into the kitchen and sliced cucumbers while she kept a stir going on the risotto. I heard her humming in time to my knife chops, the endless pleasant tune she\u2019d improvise when occupied in the kitchen, and then the humming became a little scratchy and stopped being humming at all.\nI glanced over. Mom was still stirring the rice, still wearing her pleasant Resting Mom Face, but the growling noises she was making didn\u2019t sound like they came from human vocal cords. They were the noises from the YouTube video, from the unseen person holding the camera. They were the dog noises Dad had complained about.\n\u201cDo the carrots if you\u2019re done,\u201d said Mom, seemingly on top of her growling noises.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou stopped chopping,\u201d she said without turning around. The growling stopped.\nI looked down. I had half a cucumber left. \u201cSorry, I zoned out.\u201d\nMom snorted. \u201cWelcome to kitchen life.\u201d\nDinner was the weirdest, most passive-aggressive experience of my life. Each of my parents was aware that the other was acting strangely, but when I\u2019d confronted them about their own behavior, they became evasive and pulled rank. That trick worked on me, but they couldn\u2019t intimidate each other. Each had thirty years of practice in marital sparring. Each was full of the righteous sense that the other one was being unreasonable, and that by refusing to come down hard I was only prolonging the problem.\n\u201cHow is the hobbit hole coming along?\u201d said Mom sarcastically.\n\u201cIf you can clean off the TV stand, Carlos and I can finally hang it up,\u201d said Dad.\nMom made an exasperated gesture at me with her fork.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Dad. \u201cSpeak up!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d said Mom. \u201cWhy are you . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cFinish your sentence! Stop mumbling!\u201d\nI could not deal with this. If this didn\u2019t stop, I would have to put another four hours between them and me and only show up for Christmas. I looked down at my risotto and tried to think of a plan.\nWhatever strangeness was inside my parents only came out when they were on autopilot, driving the car or stirring the rice. I needed a way to get them in the same room and distracted at the same time.\n\u201cHow about some UNO after dinner?\u201d I said.\nMy parents are nuts about UNO. They wear out decks, playing so quickly they barely look at the cards. Their serious game is contract bridge, a game where the ability to passive-aggressively manipulate your partner is an asset, but UNO is what they play to unwind, five or ten games a night.\nI hate UNO. There\u2019s very little skill in it. When you\u2019re playing, your brain goes on autopilot. It was the perfect tool for what I needed.\nMy parents divided the unwieldy deck between them and started shuffling. Almost immediately the growling noise started again from Mom, and Dad began muttering:\n\u201cIt\u2019s right over there, and I can\u2019t do a thing about it. Damn shame, ending up like this.\u201d Mom\u2019s growl ran underneath his words like a carrier wave.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s right over there?\u201d I asked him.\n\u201cThe other spacesuit,\u201d said Dad. He stacked his cards and pushed them across the table. Mom cut and began to deal.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I tried to say. There was no way back to normalcy from here, but I must have said it, because Dad responded. I wanted so badly to hear some smart-ass comment, but he casually picked up his cards and said: \u201cJust a stranded traveler.\u201d As he spoke, Mom\u2019s throat made guttural noises that went on just a little longer.\n\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d\nDad turned over the first card of the round: a red three. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d\nHe put a red six down onto the three, and Mom immediately tossed a yellow six on top of that. In five seconds, play had come to me. If I didn\u2019t keep the game going, my parents would start complaining that I was dragging down the game, and I\u2019d lose contact with the things that lived inside them.\nI steadied my hand enough to put down a yellow Draw Two. \u201cWho\u2019s in the other spacesuit?\u201d\nDad took his cards. \u201cI\u2019m in both, you see?\u201d he said. \u201cOur tourist group was flung through space, flailing for receivers. This unlucky place was in the way. Things live here. Two different spacesuits that look like one. Now I\u2019m split between the two. The part that plans is separated from the part that speaks.\u201d\nWe\u2019d gone \u2019round the UNO table twice more while the thing inside Dad was telling its sob story. Then Dad took a breath. Mom\u2019s growling changed its tenor, and in response Dad\u2019s mood became a little less maudlin.\n\u201cAll of us are looking for the catalyst that can fuse two spacesuits back together,\u201d said Dad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your turn, honey,\u201d Mom told me. I dropped a card without looking.\n\u201cGreen!\u201d Mom chided. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone green. Try to keep up, baby boy.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t have this conversation and play cards at the same time. Besides, I had nothing I could play. I drew a card and realized I didn\u2019t have to play competitive UNO. I could draw a card every time and pass. As long as I looked like I was following the rules, Mom and Dad would stay on autopilot.\n\u201cIt is not possible,\u201d I told the thing inside my parents. \u201cThere is no way to do what you need. You cannot fuse two human beings together.\u201d\n\u201cI have done it. Fused the two spacesuits. It was right: they felt incredible pleasure at being joined. I only need to find the catalyst that makes it permanent.\u201d\nEven with everything that had happened this day, I was not expecting to have this conversation. \u201cWhen we join . . . \u201d I said, \u201cwe do not stay stuck together. Instead we make a new person. My parents fused, and they created me.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just a third spacesuit,\u201d said Dad, like he\u2019d just lost all hope. \u201cAlone. Half of a person.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t need this from you,\u201d I said. \u201cI get enough of it from my parents. By the way, these are my parents. They are people. Not spacesuits.\u201d\n\u201cI would never hurt them,\u201d said Dad. \u201cThey are all that protects me.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not your spacesuits. There is no catalyst. The thing you\u2019re looking for doesn\u2019t exist, and you need to just fling yourself right out of here.\u201d\n\u201cHad I that power, why would I not have done so already?\u201d It was the most complex sentence I\u2019d ever heard in Dad\u2019s voice.\n\u201cUNO!\u201d shouts Mom.\n\u201cStop her, Carlos!\u201d exclaims Dad. His tone of playful panic couldn\u2019t be further from the sadness and vulnerability he\u2019d just been showing.\nI had so many cards by this point, I surely could have stopped Mom, but I didn\u2019t want to, and Dad couldn\u2019t. She won the game and made sarcastic jokes at Dad\u2019s expense, and the thing that was using them as spacesuits went back into hiding.\nMaybe I should have left. Said I\u2019d only come for the day and driven back home. Let them start ignoring my weird behavior. But I said good night, brushed my teeth, and climbed into my childhood bed. I tried, and then pretended, to sleep, in a house where my parents were no longer my parents.\nExcept they were my parents, most of the time. This thing was only filling in the cracks. It came out when they did something they\u2019d done a million times before. Each could only see it in the other, because it only happened to you when you weren\u2019t paying attention.\nI stayed because I had to see what was inside the mound Dad was building. I imagined a crashed spaceship buried under a tarp, some hard physical evidence that my parents weren\u2019t literally driving each other insane.\nSo I dozed in and out, and around midnight I tiptoed through the minefield of creaky boards in the hallway, through the laundry room, and out into the yard.\nIn front of the door were two sets of pajamas neatly folded on a plastic sheet. The sort of thing you\u2019d do before drinking the poison. The metal latch on the door was popped and the door itself was ajar. From inside I heard uncomfortable groaning noises like someone being slowly digested.\nShivering I brought up the brightness on my phone, pulled the door silently open, and shone the light into the depths of the hobbit hole.\nMy mother screamed.\n\u201cWhat the!\u201d my father barked. \u201cCarlos? Are you filming us?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a . . . what are you doing in there?\u201d\nDad crawled bare-chested into the light of my camera and shielded his eyes. He was hairy all over. His skin was goose-bumpy from the chill, smeared with dirt and some kind of oil.\n\u201cWhat the hell do you think we were doing?\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh, God, why?\u201d\n\u201cIt likes for us to be together,\u201d said my mother\u2019s voice. I couldn\u2019t see her because I had turned away from the hole in the mound and was shining my phone in the other direction, trying to think of anything else. \u201cWe like it, everyone\u2019s having fun, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\u201cSo you know about . . . the thing,\u201d I said. \u201cIn your brains. We\u2019re not pretending anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, duh,\u201d said Mom, \u201cwe knew it the whole time, since it happened!\u201d\n\u201cYou did not! You called me here to investigate Dad, and then he asked me to investigate you.\u201d\n\u201cCan I not want my son to come visit once in a while?\n\u201cYou\u2019re still doing it! Oh my God! You make up these stories to explain your behavior to yourselves. When one story falls apart you just switch to another one.\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet!\u201d Dad hissed. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake up the neighbors.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one who put an alien sex mound in the backyard!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a habitat.\u201d Dad rapped at the wooden door with the pride of ownership. \u201cIt needs a certain environment to be comfortable. It\u2019s not hostile. In fact, it\u2019s really improved our relationship.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d I turned around and shone the light into the mound without actually looking myself. \u201cI am going to film this.\u201d\n\u201cCarlos, no!\u201d they both snapped.\n\u201cSee, that panic you\u2019re feeling because your son is about to ruin your life for absolutely no reason?\u201d I said. \u201cHold on to that, because that\u2019s what you have put me through today. I am terrified that you\u2019re going to freeze to death, or burn yourself with some kind of chemical gel, because, hostile or not, this thing in your brains doesn\u2019t understand how your bodies work. And you will not even admit that something is wrong!\u201d\n\u201cCarlos has a good point,\u201d said Dad. \u201cA lot of people are in this situation.\u201d\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Mom, \u201cNot everyone is going to handle this as well as we did.\u201d\n\u201cWill you at least admit this is weird?\u201d I demanded.\n\u201cYou are pushing it, mister!\u201d said Mom.\nOn YouTube there\u2019s a video called \u22b6\u03bf\u2022\u2298\u03bf\u2022\u22980\u229a\u2218\u221d\u221d\u2218\u2298 \u2296\u229a\u2218\u22b60\u229a\u2298 \u22b7\u03bf\u2298\u221d00\u039f\u2237 \u2237\u03bf\u039f\u2237\u03bf\u229a\u2022\u22b6\u229a\u22c5\u2299\u2297, which in the language they use a couple galaxies over means There Is No Way To Catalyze Two Spacesuits. I filmed the video, and my parents speak in it: Dad uses English and Mom speaks simultaneously in the other language.\nThe video is short and to the point. My parents and the thing inside them explain that there is no way to merge two human beings together. You can\u2019t do it with sex, or drugs, or glue, or amateur surgery. Maybe it would be possible with the technology we have back home, but anyone who says they can do it on Earth is lying or deluded.\nYou are watching this because you have found yourself spread across two individuals. You need to accept this and make the best of it. Ask the bodies you\u2019re trapped inside to take you on. What happened to you, happened because your hosts are exceptional. They have a love so strong and stable that its memetic structure formed a suitable habitat for your projected mind.\nThe thing that trapped you inside these two spacesuits is the relationship between them. You\u2019ll be safe as long as they stay alive and stay in love.\nThe video only has twelve views. Two of them are mine.\nIt\u2019s just not what people want to hear."}

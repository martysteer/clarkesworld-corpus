I want Honey to see it while she\u2019s still a child. That way, it\u2019ll be magical. I tell her about it in the car: how big it is, and green, like a sky you can wade in.\n \u201cEven you?\u201d she asks.\n \u201cEven me.\u201d\n I duck my head to her hair. She smells fresh, but not sweet at all, like parsley or tea. She\u2019s wearing a little white dress. It\u2019s almost too short. She pushes her bare toes against the seat in front of her, knuckling it like a cat.\n \u201cCan you not do that, Hon?\u201d says Dave.\n \u201cSorry, Dad.\u201d\n She says \u201cDad\u201d now. She used to say \u201cDa-Da.\u201d\n Dave grips the wheel. I can see the tension in his shoulders. Threads of gray wink softly in his dark curls. He still wears his hair long, covering his ears, and I think he\u2019s secretly a little bit vain about it. A little bit proud of still having all his hair. I think there\u2019s something in this, something valuable, something he could use to get back. You don\u2019t cling to personal vanities if you\u2019ve given up all hope of a normal life. At least, I don\u2019t think you do.\n \u201cShit,\u201d he says.\n \u201cSweetheart . . . \u201d\n He doesn\u2019t apologize for swearing in front of Honey. The highway\u2019s blocked by a clearance area, gloved hands waving us around. He turns the car so sharply the bags in the passenger seat beside him almost fall off the cooler. In the back seat, I lean into Honey Bear.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell Dave.\n \u201cNo, Karen, it is not okay. The temp in the cooler is going to last until exactly four o\u2019clock. At four o\u2019clock, we need a fridge, which means we need a hotel. If we are five minutes late, it is not going to be okay.\u201d\n \u201cIt looks like a pretty short detour.\u201d\n \u201cIt is impossible for you to see how long it is.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m just thinking, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve got that much to clear.\u201d\n \u201cFine, you can think that. Think what you want. But don\u2019t tell me the detour\u2019s not long, or give me any other information you don\u2019t actually have, okay?\u201d\n He\u2019s driving faster. I rest my cheek on the top of Honey\u2019s head. The clearance area rolls by outside the window. Cranes, loading trucks, figures in orange jumpsuits. Some of the slick has dried: they\u2019re peeling it up in transparent sheets, like plate glass.\n Honey presses a fingertip to the window. \u201cPoo-poo,\u201d she says softly.\n I tell her about the time I spent a weekend at the beach. My best friend got so sunburned, her back blistered.\n We play the clapping game, \u201cA Sailor Went to Sea-Sea-Sea.\u201d It\u2019s our favorite.\n Dave drives too fast, but we don\u2019t get stopped, and we reach the hotel in time. I take my meds, and we put the extra in the hotel fridge. Dave\u2019s shirt is dark with sweat, and I wish he\u2019d relax, but he goes straight out to buy ice, and stores it in the freezer so we can fill the cooler tomorrow. Then he takes a shower and lies on the bed and watches the news. I sit on the floor with Honey, looking at books. I read to her every evening before bed; I\u2019ve never missed a night. Right now, we\u2019re reading The Meadow Fairies by Dorothy Elizabeth Clark.\n This is something I\u2019ve looked forward to my whole adult life: reading the books I loved as a child with a child of my own. Honey adores The Meadow Fairies. She snuggles up to me and traces the pretty winged children with her finger. Daffodil, poppy, pink. When I first brought the book home, and Dave saw us reading it, he asked what the point was, since Honey would never see those flowers. I laughed because I\u2019d never seen them either. \u201cIt\u2019s about fairies,\u201d I told him, \u201cnot botany.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a poppy in my life.\n Smiling, though half-asleep,The Poppy Fairy passes,Scarlet, like the sunrise,Among the meadow grasses.\n Honey chants the words with me. She\u2019s so smart, she learns so fast. She can pick up anything that rhymes in minutes. Her hair glints in the lamplight. There\u2019s the mysterious, slightly abrasive smell of hotel sheets, a particular hotel darkness between the blinds.\n \u201cI love this place,\u201d says Honey. \u201cCan we stay here?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s an adventure,\u201d I tell her. \u201cJust wait till tomorrow.\u201d\n On the news, helicopters hover over the sea. It\u2019s far away, the Pacific. There\u2019s been a huge dump there, over thirty square miles of slick. The effects on marine life are not yet known.\n \u201cWill it be fairyland?\u201d Honey asks suddenly.\n \u201cWhat, sweetie?\u201d\n \u201cWill it be fairyland, when I\u2019m grown up?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I tell her. My firmest tone.\n \u201cWill you be there?\u201d\n No hesitation. \u201cYes.\u201d\n The camera zooms in on the slick-white sea.\n By the time I\u2019ve given Honey Bear a drink and put her to bed, Dave\u2019s eyes are closed. I turn off the TV and the lights and get into bed. Like Honey, I love the hotel. I love the hard, tight sheets and the unfamiliar shapes that emerge around me once I\u2019ve gotten used to the dark. It\u2019s been ages since I slept away from home. The last time was long before Honey. Dave and I visited some college friends in Oregon. They couldn\u2019t believe we\u2019d driven all that way. We posed in their driveway, leaning on the car and making the victory sign.\n I want the Dave from that photo. That deep suntan, that wide grin.\n Maybe he\u2019ll come back to me here, away from home and our neighbors, the Simkos. He spends far too much time at their place.\n For a moment, I think he\u2019s back already.\n Then he starts shaking. He does it every night. He\u2019s crying in his sleep.\n \u201cReady for the beach?\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d\n We drive through town to a parking lot dusted with sand. When I step out of the car the warm sea air rolls over me in waves. There\u2019s something lively in it, something electric.\n Honey jumps up and down. \u201cIs that it? Is that it?\u201d\n \u201cYou got it, Honey Bear.\u201d\n The beach is deserted. Far to the left, an empty boardwalk whitens in the sun. I kick off my sandals and scoop them up in my hand. The gray sand sticks to my feet. We lumber down to a spot a few yards from some boulders, lugging bags and towels.\n \u201cCan I take my shoes off too? Can I go in the ocean?\u201d\n \u201cSure, but let me take your dress off.\u201d\n I pull it off over her head, and her lithe, golden body slips free. She\u2019s so beautiful, my Bear. I call her Honey because she\u2019s my sweetheart, my little love, and I call her Bear for the wildness I dream she will keep always. Honey suits her now, but when she\u2019s older she might want us to call her Bear. I would\u2019ve loved to be named Bear when I was in high school.\n \u201cDon\u2019t go too deep,\u201d I tell her, \u201cjust up to your tummy, okay?\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d she says, and streaks off, kicking up sand behind her.\n Dave has laid out the towels. He\u2019s weighted the corners with shoes and the cooler so they won\u2019t blow away. He\u2019s set up the two folding chairs and the umbrella. Now, with nothing to organize or prepare, he\u2019s sitting on a chair with his bare feet resting on a towel. He looks lost.\n \u201cNot going in?\u201d I ask.\n I think for a moment he\u2019s going to ignore me, but then he makes an effort. \u201cNot right away,\u201d he says.\n I slip off my shorts and my halter top and sit in the chair beside him in my suit. Down in the water, Honey jumps up and down and shrieks.\n \u201cLook at that.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he says.\n \u201cShe loves it.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m so glad we brought her. Thank you.\u201d I reach out and give his wrist a squeeze.\n \u201cLook at that fucked-up clown on the boardwalk,\u201d he says. \u201cIt looks like it used to be part of an arcade entrance or something. Probably been there for fifty years.\u201d\n The clown towers over the boardwalk. It\u2019s almost white, but you can see traces of red on the nose and lips, traces of blue on the hair.\n \u201cLooks pretty old,\u201d I agree.\n \u201cBlack rocks, filthy gray sand, and a fucked-up arcade clown. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. That\u2019s the beach.\u201d\n It comes out before I can stop it: \u201cOkay, Mr. Simko.\u201d\n Dave looks at me.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.\n He looks at his watch. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here for more than an hour. I want us to take a break, go back to the hotel and rest for a bit. Then we\u2019ll have lunch, and you can take your medication.\u201d\n \u201cI said I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cYou know what?\u201d He looks gray, worn out, beaten down, like something left out in the rain. His eyes wince away from the light. I can\u2019t stand it, I can\u2019t stand it if he never comes back. \u201cI think,\u201d he tells me, \u201cthat Mr. Simko is a pretty fucking sensible guy.\u201d\n I lean back in the chair, watching Honey Bear in the water. I hate the Simkos. Mr. Simko\u2019s bent over and never takes off his bathrobe. He sits on his porch drinking highballs all day, and he gets Dave to go over there and drink too. I can hear them when I\u2019ve got the kitchen window open. Mr. Simko says things like \u201cApr\u00e8s nous le d\u00e9luge\u201d and \u201cKeep your powder dry and your pecker wet.\u201d He tells Dave he wishes he and Mrs. Simko didn\u2019t have Mandy. I\u2019ve heard him say that. \u201cI wish we\u2019d never gone in for it. Broke Linda\u2019s heart.\u201d Who does he think brings him the whiskey to make his highballs?\n Mrs. Simko never comes out of the house except when Mandy comes home. Then she appears on the porch, banging the door behind her. She\u2019s bent over like her husband and wears a flowered housedress. Her hair is black fluff, with thin patches here and there, as if she\u2019s burned it. \u201cMandy, Mandy,\u201d she croons, while Mandy puts the stuff down on the porch: liquor, chocolate, clothes, all the luxury goods you can\u2019t get at the Center. Stuff you can only get from a child who\u2019s left home. Mandy never looks at her mother. She hasn\u2019t let either of the Simkos touch her since she moved out.\n \u201cI\u2019m going down in the water with Honey,\u201d I say, but Dave grabs my arm.\n \u201cWait. Look.\u201d\n I turn my head, and there are Fair Folk on the rocks. Six of them, huge and dazzling. Some crouch on the boulders; others swing over the sea on their flexible wings, dipping their toes in the water.\n \u201cHoney!\u201d Dave shouts. \u201cHoney! Come here!\u201d\n \u201cC\u2019mon, Hon,\u201d I call, reassuring.\n Honey splashes toward us, glittering in the sun.\n \u201cCome here!\u201d barks Dave.\n \u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d I tell him.\n He clutches the arms of his chair. I know he\u2019s afraid because of the clearance area we passed on the highway, the slick.\n \u201cCome here,\u201d he repeats as Honey runs up panting. He glances at the Fair Folk. They\u2019re looking at us now, lazy and curious.\n I get up and dry Honey off with a towel. \u201cWhat?\u201d she says.\n \u201cJust come over here,\u201d says Dave, holding out his arms. \u201cCome and sit with Daddy.\u201d\n Honey walks over and curls up in his lap. I sit in the chair next to them and Dave puts his hand on my shoulder. He\u2019s got us. He\u2019s holding everyone.\n Two of the Fair Folk lift and ripple toward us through the light. There seems to be more light wherever they go. They\u2019re fifteen, twenty feet tall, so tall they look slender, attenuated, almost insect-like. You forget how strong they are.\n They bend and dip in the air: so close I can see the reds of their eyes.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dave whispers.\n And it is, of course. We\u2019ve got each other. We\u2019re safe.\n They gaze at us for a moment, impassive, then turn and glide back to their comrades.\n Honey waves at them with both hands. \u201cBye, fairies!\u201d\n On my first visit to the clinic, I went through all the usual drills, the same stuff I go in for every two weeks. Step here, pee here, spit here, breathe in, breathe out, give me your arm. The only difference the first time was the questions.\n Are you aware of the gravity of the commitment? I said yes. Have you been informed of the risks, both physical and psychological? Yes. The side effects of the medication? Blood transfusions? Yes. Yes. The decrease in life expectancy? Everything: yes.\n That\u2019s what you say to life. Yes.\n \u201cThey chose us,\u201d I told Dave. Rain lashed the darkened windows. I cradled tiny Honey in my lap. I\u2019d dried her off and wrapped her in a towel, and she was quiet now, exhausted. I\u2019d already named her in my head.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t go back,\u201d Dave whispered. \u201cIf we say yes, we can\u2019t go back.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n His eyes were wet. \u201cWe could run out and put her on somebody else\u2019s porch.\u201d\n He looked ashamed after he\u2019d said it, the way he\u2019d looked when I\u2019d asked him not to introduce me as \u201cmy wife, Karen, the children\u2019s literature major.\u201d When we first moved into the neighborhood he\u2019d introduce me that way and then laugh, as if there was nothing more ridiculous in the world. Children, when almost nobody could have them anymore; literature when all the schools were closed. I told him it bothered me, and he was sorry, but only for hurting me. He wasn\u2019t sorry for what he really meant. What he meant was: No.\n That\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s like the Simkos, hateful and worn out with saying No to Mandy, saying No to life.\n So many people say no from the beginning. They make it a virtue: \u201cI can\u2019t be bought.\u201d As if it were all a matter of protection and fancy goods. Of course, most of those who say yes pretend to be heroes: saving the world, if only for a season. That\u2019s always struck me as equally wrong, in its own way. Cheap.\n I can\u2019t help thinking the absence of children has something to do with this withering of the spirit\u2014this pale new way of seeing the world. Children knew better. You always say yes. If you don\u2019t, there\u2019s no adventure, and you grow old in your ignorance, bitter, bereft of magic. You say yes to what comes, because you belong to the future, whatever it is, and you\u2019re sure as hell not going to be left behind in the past. Do you hear the fairies sing? You always get up and open the door. You always answer. You always let them in.\n The Fair Folk are gone. I\u2019m in the ocean with Honey. I bounce her on my knee. She\u2019s so light in the water: soap bubble, floating seed. She clings to my neck and squeals. I think she\u2019ll remember this, this morning at the beach, and the memory will be almost exactly like my own memory of childhood. The water, the sun. Even the cooler, the crumpled maps in the car. So many things now are the way they were when I was small. Simpler, in lots of ways. The things that have disappeared\u2014air travel, wireless communication\u2014seem dreamlike, ludicrous, almost not worth thinking about.\n I toss Honey up in the air and catch her, getting a mouthful of saltwater in the process. I shoot the water onto her shoulder. \u201cMama!\u201d she yells. She bends her head to the water and burbles, trying to copy me, but I lift her up again. I don\u2019t want her to choke.\n \u201cMy Bear, my Bear,\u201d I murmur against the damp, wet side of her head. \u201cMy Honey Bear.\u201d\n Dave is waving us in. He\u2019s pointing at his watch.\n I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the excitement, or maybe something about the salt water, but as soon as I get Honey up on the beach, she voids.\n \u201cChrist,\u201d says Dave. \u201cOh, Christ.\u201d\n He pulls me away from her. In seconds he\u2019s kneeling on our towels, whipping the gloves and aprons out of the bag. He gets his on fast; I fumble with mine. He rips open a packet of wipes with his teeth, tosses it to me, and pulls out a can of spray.\n \u201cI thought you said it wasn\u2019t time yet,\u201d he says.\n \u201cI thought it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s really early.\u201d\n Honey stands naked on the sand, slick pouring down her legs. Already she looks hesitant, confused. \u201cMama?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Hon. Just let it come. Do you want to lie down?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d she says, and crumples.\n \u201cFuck,\u201d says Dave. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hit the water. I have to go make a call. Take this.\u201d\n He hands me the spray, yanks his loafers on and dashes up the beach. There\u2019s a phone in the parking lot, he can call the Service. He\u2019s headed for the fence, not the gate, but it doesn\u2019t stop him, he seizes the bar and vaults over.\n The slick is still coming. So much, it\u2019s incredible, as if she\u2019s losing her whole body. It astounds me, it frightens me every time. Her eyes are still open, but dazed. Her fine hair is starting to dry in the sun. The slick pours, undulant, catching the light, like molten plastic.\n I touch her face with a gloved hand. \u201cHoney Bear.\u201d\n \u201cMm,\u201d she grunts.\n \u201cYou\u2019re doing a good job, Hon. Just relax, okay? Mama\u2019s here.\u201d\n Dave was right, it\u2019s going to reach the water. I scramble down to the waves and spray the sand and even the water in the path of the slick. Probably won\u2019t do anything, probably stupid. I run back to Honey just as Dave comes pelting back from the parking lot.\n \u201cOn their way,\u201d he gasps. \u201cShit! It\u2019s almost in the water!\u201d\n \u201cMama,\u201d says Honey.\n \u201cI know. I tried to spray.\u201d\n \u201cYou sprayed? That\u2019s not going to do anything!\u201d\n I\u2019m kneeling beside her. \u201cYes, Honey.\u201d\n \u201cHelp me!\u201d yells Dave. He runs down past the slick and starts digging wildly, hurling gobs of wet sand.\n Honey curls her hand around my finger.\n \u201cKaren! Get down here! We can dig a trench, we can keep it from hitting the water!\u201d\n \u201cThis is scary,\u201d Honey whispers.\n \u201cI know. I know, Hon. I\u2019m sorry. But you don\u2019t need to be scared. It\u2019s just like when we\u2019re at home, okay?\u201d\n But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not like when we\u2019re at home. At home, I usually know when it\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019ve got a chart. I set up buckets, a plastic sheet. I notify the Service of the approximate date. They come right away. We keep the lights down, and I play Honey\u2019s favorite CD.\n This isn\u2019t like that at all. Harsh sunlight, Dave screaming behind us. Then the Service. They\u2019re angry: one of them says, \u201cYou ought to be fucking fined.\u201d They spray Honey, right on her skin. She squeezes my finger. I don\u2019t know what to do, except sing to her, a song from her CD.\n A sailor went to sea-sea-seaTo see what he could see-see-seeBut all that he could see-see-seeWas the bottom of the deep blue sea-sea-sea.\n At last, it stops. The Service workers clean Honey up and wrap her in sterile sheets. They take our gloves and aprons away to be cleaned at the local Center. Dave and I wipe ourselves down and bag the dirty wipes for disposal. We\u2019re both shaking. He says: \u201cWe are not doing this again.\u201d\n \u201cIt was an accident,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s just life.\u201d\n He turns to face me. \u201cThis is not life, Karen,\u201d he snarls. \u201cThis is not life.\u201d\n \u201cYes. It is.\u201d\n I think he sees, then. I think he sees that even though he\u2019s the practical one, the realist, I\u2019m the strong one.\n I carry Honey up to the car. Dave takes the rest of the stuff. He makes two trips. He gives me an energy bar and then my medication. After that, there\u2019s the injection, painkillers and nutrients, because Honey\u2019s voided, and she\u2019ll be hungry. She\u2019ll need more than a quick drink.\n He slips the needle out of my arm. He\u2019s fast, and gentle, even like this, kneeling in the car in a beach parking lot. He presses the cotton down firmly, puts on a strip of medical tape. He looks up and meets my eyes. His are full of tears.\n \u201cJesus, Karen,\u201d he says.\n Just like that, in that moment, he\u2019s back. He covers his mouth with his fist, holding in laughter. \u201cDid you hear the Service guy?\u201d\n \u201cYou mean \u2019You ought to be fucking fined\u2019?\u201d\n He bends over, wheezing and crowing. \u201cChrist! I really thought the slick was going in the water.\u201d\n \u201cBut it didn\u2019t go in the water?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n He sits up, wipes his eyes on the back of his hand, then reaches out to smooth my hair away from my face.\n \u201cNo. It didn\u2019t go in. It was fine. Not that it matters, with that giant dump floating in the Pacific.\u201d\n He reads my face, and raises his hands, palms out. \u201cOkay, okay. No Mr. Simko.\u201d\n He backs out, shuts the door gently, and gets in the driver\u2019s seat. The white clown on the boardwalk watches our car pull out of the lot. We\u2019re almost at the hotel when Honey wakes up.\n \u201cMama?\u201d she mumbles. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, sweetie.\u201d\n I untie the top piece of my suit and pull it down. \u201cDave? I\u2019m going to feed her in the car.\u201d\n \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll park in the shade. I\u2019ll bring you something to eat from inside.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d\n Honey\u2019s wriggling on my lap, fighting the sheets. \u201cMama, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n \u201cHush. Hush. Here.\u201d\n She nuzzles at me, quick and greedy, and latches on. Not at the nipple, but in the soft area under the arm. She grips me lightly with her teeth, and then there\u2019s the almost electric jolt as her longer, hollow teeth come down and sink in.\n \u201cThere,\u201d I whisper. \u201cThere.\u201d\n Dave gets out and shuts the door. We\u2019re alone in the car.\n A breeze stirs the leaves outside. Their reflections move in the windows.\n I don\u2019t know what the future is going to bring. I don\u2019t think about it much. It does seem like there won\u2019t be a particularly lengthy future, for us. Not with so few human children being born, and the Fair Folk eating all the animals, and so many plant species dying out from the slick. And once we\u2019re gone, what will the Fair Folk do? They don\u2019t seem able to raise their own children. It\u2019s why they came here in the first place. I don\u2019t know if they feel sorry for us, but I know they want us to live as long as possible: they\u2019re not pure predators, as some people claim. The abductions of the early days, the bodies discovered in caves\u2014that\u2019s all over. The terror, too. That was just to show us what they could do. Now they only kill us as punishment, or after they\u2019ve voided, when they\u2019re crazy with hunger. They rarely hurt anyone in the company of a winged child.\n Still, even with all their precautions, we won\u2019t last forever. I remember the artist in the park, when I took Honey there one day. All of his paintings were white. He said that was the future, a white planet, nothing but slick, and Honey said it looked like fairyland.\n Her breathing has slowed. Mine, too. It\u2019s partly the meds, and partly some chemical that comes down through the teeth. It makes you drowsy.\n Here\u2019s what I know about the future. Honey Bear will grow bigger. Her wings will expand. One day she\u2019ll take to the sky, and go live with her own kind. Maybe she\u2019ll forget human language, the way the Simko\u2019s Mandy has, but she\u2019ll still bring us presents. She\u2019ll still be our piece of the future.\n And maybe she won\u2019t forget. She might remember. She might remember this day at the beach.\n She\u2019s still awake. Her eyes glisten, heavy with bliss. Large, slightly protuberant eyes, perfectly black in the centers, and scarlet, like the sunrise, at the edges.\n Sofia Samatar is a fantasy writer, poet, and critic, and a PhD student in African Languages and Literature at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

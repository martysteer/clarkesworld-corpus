We stare in wonder as if at some mythical creature poached from the land of fey. We\u2019ve never had something like her in our out-of-the-way little security station.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be uploaded,\u201d Captain Maas says. \u201cNothing can change that now. But it\u2019s a lengthy process. You\u2019re currently in the prelim scanning stage, during which you can still talk. This will last for . . . \u201d The Captain glances at me.\n\u201cThree days,\u201d I supply.\n\u201cSo, if you were to cooperate now . . . names, operations, safe houses . . . we could make you more comfortable on the Other Side.\u201d\nShe stares at the Captain, her poker-face an admirable piece of tradecraft.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be on our substrate,\u201d Maas warns, \u201centirely under our control. We could make that quite unpleasant for you. Far beyond physical pain or even psy torture, as you\u2019d experience them from your current substrate of meat. Or there\u2019s cooperation, and we arrange a pleasant V-world of your choosing on the Other Side. We\u2019re going to assay your mind, regardless.\u201d\nOne of the other officers, some kind of apparatchik from the Capital, leans toward Maas and whispers something.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Captain says. \u201cHow silly of me.\u201d\nThe Apparatchik is tall and broad-shouldered, her head shaved, her dark uniform something I haven\u2019t seen before. Captain Maas seems shabby and provincial by comparison. He straightens his tie, frowning at the prisoner.\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of them.\u201d\nHe means the agent is from Sylvania, the Democratic Republic thereof. The superstitious enemy to the north, the DRS. Cherishers of continuity-of-consciousness, believers in souls, revilers of upload.\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re going to die with your meat,\u201d the Apparatchik says, her tone pitying. \u201cOr float up to heaven, maybe?\u201d The agent meets her gaze. \u201cYou believe it will be a mere copy, what we end up with after the scan, and furthermore an abomination. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\nThe agent shrugs as well as she can within her constraints. A real professional.\n\u201cInducements or threats to her post-scan self will hold no weight, Captain,\u201d the Apparatchik says.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Maas says, \u201cthere are the old ways.\u201d\nHe means torture, but of course he knows better. Trauma would compromise the scan, and torture is a primitive, unreliable technique, regardless. But he hopes his prisoner doesn\u2019t know these things, or doesn\u2019t know that he knows them. He has nothing to lose at this point.\n\u201cElectricity, sleep deprivation . . . she won\u2019t need her body much longer anyway.\u201d\nEveryone in the little white room knows scanning means biological death. But if this or the Captain\u2019s threats frighten the agent, she doesn\u2019t let on.\n\u201cHow was she picked up?\u201d the Apparatchik says.\nThe Captain nods at me, and I hand her the file.\nPrisoner 8571, alias Amina Hadzic, entered the Republic of Metropotamia as a minor functionary of the Sylvanian Trade Delegation. On a fake Metropotamian ID (Dee Spendlove), she traveled by marshrutka from the Capital to the Pleasure Coast south of the Chicago ruins. In the unregistered pontoon nightclub Manifest Destiny, she approached Joe Aspinall, 27, formerly a junior code architect at the Metropotamian Bureau of V-Worlds. Aspinall was on a bender. He\u2019d been fired for creating an unsanctioned porn biome accessible by the uploaded aristocracy of the Spheres. It could have been a Sphere connection, the patron of his art maybe, that kept him out of prison.\n8571 plied Aspinall with designer cocktails. Toward the end of the night she offered him a \u201cconsultancy\u201d in the DRS. Things were changing in Sylvania, she claimed, just as they were changing here in Metropotamia. The Council of Nine were getting old, their attitude toward upload softening. If Aspinall came to the DRS and shared his expertise, it would not only pay well, but he\u2019d be spreading the light and truth of his homeland, Discontinuity, to its ignorant foes. He might well end up a Metropotamian hero.\nThis was mostly lies, of course. Sylvania just wants to hack the Spheres and other V-worlds, and bring them down.\n8571 was a real pro. She laid it on thick, with a sob story for the big finish: she\u2019d had her father scanned, on his deathbed, by a black market Sylvanian technician. She wanted a pleasant afterlife for him.\nThe Apparatchik looks up from the file. \u201cThis begs a few questions.\u201d\n\u201cHow did she give our delegation handlers the slip,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd how did she know about Aspinall.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know more when we\u2019ve assayed her, but regarding the first question . . . with the state of the economy and the importance of the negotiations . . . \u201d\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cIt may have fostered an indulgent approach to handling the delegation. Who knows how they\u2019re being entertained, for instance.\u201d\nThe Apparatchik is thoughtful. \u201cThis new perestroika is a mistake, and I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so. We need to get back to our planned economy, only stick to it this time.\u201d\n\u201cYes Ma\u2019am,\u201d the Captain says, eyeing me uncomfortably. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d\nThis doesn\u2019t surprise me, coming from Maas. These aging security officials at marginal postings tend to be reactionary.\nI meet 8571\u2019s gaze. Eye contact lasts just a moment too long, and leaves me wondering, on the edge of paranoia. She\u2019s staring at the floor now. What did it mean, that gravid moment and look?\nThe Apparatchik finishes perusing the file. As is often the case with clandestine operations, random exigency trumped the best laid plans. The Manifest Destiny came unmoored and drifted into international waters. Things might\u2019ve gone differently if the Sylvanian Navy had been on its toes. Instead, the MS Michiana found the Manifest Destiny practically falling apart at the seams. 8571 tried to swim for it, but the Michiana net-gunned her and dragged her aboard. Aspinall sobered up and spilled his guts, claiming he never agreed to 8571\u2019s offer. Now he\u2019s awaiting decision. He\u2019ll likely be uploaded and assayed.\nOurs is the closest station to old Chicago, so 8571 was delivered to us, rather than to the Capital as she probably should\u2019ve been. Maas jumped the gun, excited to finally get someone of consequence in his hot seat. Only after locking her in did he have second thoughts and contact the Directorate in the Capital.\n\u201cYou Sylvanians really puzzle me,\u201d the Apparatchik says.\n8571 is impassive. She seems to be meditating.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the self surviving a jump from brain to machine. That is, you can\u2019t fathom a Discontinuous self, even though this failure of imagination is itself Discontinuous. The self flashing right now in your skull is Discontinuous. If you don\u2019t like the preponderance of biological research indicating that, time itself is Discontinuous. Quantized. That\u2019s the foundation of modern computing, you know. V-worlds wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise. Don\u2019t they teach you these things in Sylvanian schools? I suppose not. Too busy learning what your priesthood counts as a soul. Fooling yourselves. But for you to be sent here by your government, you must be smarter than that.\u201d She kneels in front of 8571. \u201cI can see you\u2019re smart. Deep down, you must know that you\u2019re Discontinuous. That you have been all your life. A spy should understand this better than most, perhaps. You\u2019ve been a million strobing Dees, or Aminas, or whoevers, since we clamped you into this hot seat. And therefore, when we say you will suffer on the Other Side, we mean you, inasmuch as you means a damn thing, now and forevermore.\u201d\nI admire the Apparatchik\u2019s delivery. I\u2019ve heard it all before, of course, from Metropotamian intellectuals, and bureaucrats and entertainers, and even common laborers. Every good Metropotamian accepts Discontinuity. Every good Metropotamian yearns for upload to the Spheres, and works toward it.\nThey convinced me long ago.\nI, an agent of Sylvania, ostensibly a saboteur and provocateur, just like 8571. I, a mole in Metropotamian Fatherland Security. But I\u2019ve been here too long. I\u2019ve gone native. And now all I can think about is that look 8571 gave me. Inscrutable, or was it?\n\u201cSo,\u201d the Apparatchik continues, \u201cwith all that in mind, do you have anything to tell us?\u201d\n8571 looks up, grinning. Her Sylvanian faith is perfect. The fool.\nDoes she know who I am? If so, her assay will blow my cover, and I\u2019ll be next in the hot seat. It\u2019s standard procedure for her not to know, of course, unless she needs to. These are strange times. I haven\u2019t been in touch with Sylvanian Intelligence in over a year. Maybe she was tasked with checking on me. But why combine that with such a delicate recruiting mission? Operationally, it makes no sense.\nBut that look . . .\nIt\u2019s about time your assay \u2019rithms found germane memories. I was getting tired of reliving the catechisms and grim, cold lecture halls of my Sylvanian upbringing. Though I suppose it\u2019s only been a few seconds of real time. Anyway, here I am. Pick me apart, catalog my crimes! How far we\u2019ve come since the days of waterboarding and stress positions. I can\u2019t help but think of the Last Emperor, Puyi, writing his life story over and over until his communist reeducators were satisfied. The inefficiency of it all.\nThank God or History for the science that has brought us together, here and now, on such intimate terms.\nI don\u2019t fool myself that I\u2019m bound for anything but unimaginable psychic torment, or oblivion (which is also unimaginable). I only ask that when your assay is done, you grant me one small favor.\nThree days until the hot seat starts to pick her brain apart. Three days until her neural networks are destroyed as they\u2019re mapped, and another mind makes the Metropotamian Leap, though she\u2019s not bound for simulated paradises. Assay, and possibly torment: these are her only fates, regardless of what her flesh has been promised.\nThat means I have three days. To flee, possibly, but where? Not back to my homeland. I\u2019m no longer a Sylvanian, I know that much. I can\u2019t live their prayer and austerity, not anymore. West there is only The Dust. East, ruins engulfed by toxic jungle. South, more Metropotamian plantations, gradually giving way to wetlands too stifling for human habitation.\nBesides, all I want is here. Not the upload promised to traitors and foreign agents, but that which all Metropotamians aspire to, and only a privileged few achieve. There\u2019s nothing for me anywhere else.\nI leave the station grounds for lunch. Warm February rain blows in from the Lake, casting a pall over the town, and hearth-like cafes seem all the more welcoming for it. Vast screens glow with visions of the Other Side: the Spheres, a multiverse of Happy Hunting Grounds and Olympuses, multiuser and private, that I\u2019ve come to believe I might one day enjoy.\nAfter lunch I return to the station, my mind racing.\nThey\u2019re showing 8571 what her lack of cooperation will get her on the Other Side. A wall of the little white room darkens with visions of horror. Some of the inmates are rendered as they were in life, and when they\u2019ve been burned or mutilated beyond recognition, they regenerate and suffer all over again. Others have been given new forms, quivering blobs of sensitized, immortal flesh sagging from meat hooks in infernal dungeons. Regardless of how they\u2019re rendered, the unfortunates are all the same. They are coded minds. They can be made to suffer with an efficiency never possible in the corporeal world. They are not tortured for information. Scavenging algorithms comb out their secrets before their punishments begin.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never sleep again,\u201d Captain Maas says, \u201cand you\u2019ll never die.\u201d\nThe Apparatchik watches 8571 expectantly.\nI\u2019ve seen this work before. The punitive hells on the Other Side function wonderfully as deterrence, and as incentive at times like this. But we\u2019ve never dealt with a dyed-in-the-wool Sylvanian agent before. 8571 seems unimpressed by the horror show. Her faith in continuity-of-consciousness is perfect, as mine once was. She really believes she\u2019s safe. Not from death, perhaps, but from pain. She hasn\u2019t had my years in Metropotamia to see the truth of Discontinuity. She will suffer unless I do something. Rescue is impossible now, but I might arrange for her premature demise. A mercy killing within the next three days. I owe her that much, don\u2019t I? I owe Sylvania that much, and Sylv-Int, which I once served with the fanaticism of a monk.\nOf course, killing her would also save my neck, if she does indeed know who I am. If that\u2019s what her look meant. It would be my first kill, a fellow Sylv-Int agent no less. But it would be about sparing her.\nNot saving myself.\nIt has to be more than that. Doesn\u2019t it?\nThe afternoon wears on and 8571 remains aloof.\nThe Apparatchik finally takes me by the elbow and ushers me out of the white room, leaving Maas in charge. She leads me into a neighboring interrogation cell. She produces a flask from the hip pocket of her sharp new uniform, takes a pull, and offers it to me. My hackles are up. I want to set her at ease, so I partake. It\u2019s good whiskey from the Capital. All I\u2019ve had for years is small-town jag juice.\nI nod in appreciation and hand back the flask.\n\u201cAll that earlier about getting back to the plan, economy-wise . . . \u201d She waits for me to say something. She could be feeling me out as a co-conspirator, intrigued by my near-criticism of the trade delegate handlers. Or she could be testing my loyalty to the current paradigm. If that\u2019s the case, Maas will soon find himself in the hot seat.\nI study her gaze, hoping to wait her out. One of the dark arts I remember from training: make them just uncomfortable enough to keep talking. But she\u2019s unflappable. \u201cThe Captain seemed keen,\u201d I say.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fool, but a useful sort of fool. We\u2019ll need people like him in the days and weeks to come. And we\u2019ll need people like you. Careful, clever sorts.\u201d\nWatch and wait, watch and wait. Maybe this time I\u2019ll get her.\n\u201cI can\u2019t seem to sniff out your politics,\u201d she says. \u201cI really do have a nose for it, believe it or not. So, when I meet someone like you it usually means they have no politics. You\u2019re simply a professional, am I right?\u201d\n\u201cI like to think so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if the current regime were to be . . . challenged, if it were audited and found wanting, if it became a question of core Metropotamian values, you would uphold your oath. You would do everything in your power to safeguard those values.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, hoping the gamble pays off.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, then.\u201d She takes another swig and passes the flask back. She watches me pull, smirking. \u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019re still Metropotamians, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we have this Sylvanian. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to talk. I want you to go to the Capital and poke around. You have informants there, I assume . . . \u201d\nI nod.\n\u201cFind out how she got away from that delegation.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know who the Apparatchik is or even if she outranks me, but I was planning on heading to the Capital anyway, so I have no problem saying, \u201cYes Ma\u2019am.\u201d\nNow you\u2019re on the right path. Now you\u2019ll begin to understand what a Sylvanian wretch you\u2019ve captured. I can no longer lie, so you\u2019ll believe me when I say that toward the end, I really did feel like a Metropotamian, and I really did feel like you were my comrades.\nIf I ever meant a damn thing to any of you, you\u2019ll grant me one small favor.\n\u201cSo, you have information on the missing Sylvanian,\u201d the Minister of Foreign Affairs says. \u201cWhat was her name . . . Hadzic?\u201d\nThe florid, middle-aged man is an admirable thespian. I suppose you\u2019d have to be to reach the bureaucratic heights he has, but Minister Fitzjames is no field operator. His pretense of innocence\u2014or ignorance, or whatever he\u2019s going for\u2014is absurd in the context of this meeting. Here we are in the dead of night, among the rotting crucifixions outside the Capital Wall, treading upon the weeds of what was once something ludicrous called a \u201cgolf course.\u201d We\u2019re alone among the hanging, floodlit bodies. He didn\u2019t even risk bringing a bodyguard, let alone the investigators and soldiers of his Ministry.\nI don\u2019t have time for his evasions. I leveraged my security clearance to get a message to him. That will be on record. It\u2019s well within my remit, but suspicious to the right gaze.\n\u201cHadzic, or Spendlove if you prefer, is a Sylvanian intelligence agent. As you know.\u201d\nFitzjames stops beneath a corpse whose placard identifies it as a \u201cRation Hoarder\u201d and \u201cContinuity Roader.\u201d Closer to the steel and concrete of the city wall, a fresher body, something called a \u201cSpiritualist,\u201d hangs nailed to an ancient utility pole.\nThe Minister opens his mouth to object, or deny, but I interrupt:\n\u201cYou helped her leave the trade delegation and covered up her absence.\u201d\nOne of the last things I did before abandoning Sylv-Int was investigate Fitzjames as a potential asset. I discovered his extramarital affairs, leverageable perhaps, but common among these privileged creatures of the Capital. More interesting was the time he declined an invitation from the Spheres. The opportunity coveted by so many, the chance to upload. Most of the other Ministers of Metropotamia, of Defense and Agriculture and Propaganda, had already gone over. Now they run things from the Other Side. The Minister of Foreign Affairs claimed he had to stay on the ground a bit longer, what with Sylvania to the north and barbarian coalitions forming in The Dust. Economic reform was a delicate thing. It needed him hands-on. Somehow, he sold this to the Metropo aristocracy and retained his position, but I didn\u2019t buy it. I smelled fear of Discontinuity, fear of oblivion, maybe even a closet Continuitist. That would be a leverageable thought crime and might also speak to hidden Sylvanian sympathies.\nI reported these findings to Sylv-Int and thought nothing more of Minister Fitzjames. Until this evening, when I found him on the list of trade delegation handlers. In fact, he\u2019s running the whole show.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he says. \u201cHow dare you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRelax, Minister. I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\nI reach into my overcoat and he follows suit, leveling a pistol.\n\u201cOkay okay.\u201d I produce the file I showed the Apparatchik, and hand it over. He keeps his weapon aimed as he reads. When he gets to the last page I say, \u201cShe\u2019s scheduled. Everything comes out in two days, unless you act.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what the hell am I supposed to do?\u201d\nThere we are, past denial. The file shivers in his hand.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got connections, resources. She must not be assayed.\u201d\nHe\u2019s in shock now. He sits down beneath the crucified ration hoarder, staring into the void beyond the floodlights. I congratulate myself again on my choice of meeting place.\n\u201cDo you understand?\u201d I say.\nHe sets aside the file and contemplates his pistol.\n\u201cIf it helps, at least two of the officers holding her are subversives. They spoke against your perestroika.\u201d\nHe chuckles, sounding borderline hysterical. \u201cThey\u2019re not the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cOne of them, I don\u2019t know her name, seems to be planning something. A coup maybe.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that makes sense.\u201d\n\u201cShe was wearing a black uniform I haven\u2019t seen before . . . \u201d\n\u201cPadraic\u2019s new security force, or political police, I should say.\u201d\nLesley Padraic, a Subminister of Defense and one of Fitzjames\u2019 staunchest foes, a Metropotamian of the old school.\n\u201cThat sure didn\u2019t take long,\u201d Fitzjames says, more to himself than me.\nI don\u2019t like how he\u2019s staring at that weapon. I think about massaging his ego, starting with something about the forgivable and necessary vices of great men. A few mistresses and a minor indiscretion with a foreign power, weighed against the renaissance he\u2019s engineering. His flaws nothing more than colorful footnotes in some future history.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your interest in all this?\u201d he demands.\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\nI find the gun pointing at me again. \u201cMaybe not.\u201d\n\u201cMinister . . . \u201d\n\u201cI mean, as long as I\u2019m tying up loose ends . . . \u201d\n\u201cGive me some credit. If I die, everything comes out . . . the women, your recruitment, Hadzic, all of it.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re one of them?\u201d\nHe means a Sylvanian, or more specifically a Sylv-Int agent, I suppose.\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d\nRunning me like this, between memory activations, very cute. I guess it amuses you to let me babble here in the perfect dark and limbo of the upload bridge. Or maybe it interests the \u2019rithms to listen and see what I recall naturally. If you can call this natural.\nAs the train pulls into my stop, I notice the station is much more crowded than it ought to be at this hour. Plainclothes thugs wearing black armbands fill the platform and the square beyond. They might be Fitzjames\u2019 or the Apparatchik\u2019s. Whatever the case, things are moving, and an instinct tells me to stay in motion as well.\nI sink into my seat as the train moves on. I ride it to the last stop on the line.\nIn the predawn gloaming, I wander through the remnants of an ancient town, a community built in the Age of Excess. Every house has its own expanse of land. These days it\u2019s all sand and weeds, but back then it was grass\u2014idiotically watered and trimmed\u2014and later, toward the end, desperate vegetable gardens. Each house has a smaller companion, a house for the family\u2019s internal combustion vehicles.\nNow it\u2019s all abandoned and weather-beaten, half-swallowed by dunes.\nI come to a familiar structure missing most of its roof. I enter through a collapsed section of wall. Inside I\u2019m surrounded by faint, oxidized saints, peeling paint, and broken, crudely-carved, phantasmagoric idols. I like coming here. I like the sense of connection with deep time, the geological strata of religions. A church first, of some eastern orthodoxy, then a mosque, and finally an end-times polytheist temple. But long after the citizens of a doomed republic quit this town, a new religion arrived. It came to occupy this building that had been so hospitable to previous creeds. It was a religion with one follower.\nI ascend the altar. I reach into the space under the collapsed masonry and pull out a little plastic bundle. A roll of paper, sealed against the elements. A coded message from Sylv-Int.\nI found a spirituality in spy-craft that I never attained in the masses and rallies of mainstream Sylvanian life. I think many of us Sylv-Int agents are like that. We are the Sylvanians who don\u2019t fit anywhere else, the unbelievers safeguarding the faithful. When I came to Metropotamia, it was an epiphany, like a religious or sexual awakening, every moment imbued with new significance and new dimension. I wasn\u2019t just buying dumplings from the street vendor outside the station. I was buying dumplings in the clandestine service of Sylvania, risking capture and worse, and the dumplings were not just dumplings. Hunger was not just hunger. Sleep, when I managed it, was a blessing. Life was as I\u2019d always imagined it for faithful Sylvanians: pregnant with meaning.\nIt didn\u2019t last, of course.\nWhen I came to my senses, there was nothing left for me but Metropotamian dogma: the cold, inescapable logic of Discontinuity. There was a kind of freedom in accepting the reality of my Discontinuous selves. The me who accepted it was distinct from the billions of mes who\u2019d doubted it. I was a series of fleeting brain states, each with access to memory and the illusion of continuity. But it was okay. The illusion was enough.\nBetter than enough. It meant that upload to the Spheres held some promise of escape, even salvation.\nI pocket the roll of paper. It is dangerous coming back here, though if I\u2019m caught, I could say this is 8571\u2019s drop site. Then again, she might know about it, if she knows about me, and she may have sung by now. But to survive, cover intact, I need all the information I can get. I have to be proactive now. The instinct to hoard and weaponize information is a hard one to shake. Maybe some day I\u2019ll manage it, far from this sordid corporeality.\n\u201cField Mouse.\u201d\nHeart racing, I scan the shadows of the ruin.\nThe voice was deep, self-assured, amused. And the operating name, no one\u2019s called me that in a long time. I reach into my pocket for my sidearm.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not, shall we?\u201d\nMy hand freezes, fingertips on the grip.\n\u201cWhere I can see them . . . that\u2019s it.\u201d\nA shape that I took for one of the fading orthodox saints detaches itself from the far wall. A short, balding man steps into the blue predawn light, an antique machine pistol leveled.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been worried about you, Field Mouse.\u201d No attempt to hide the Sylvanian lilt. \u201cBeen sick? Or just playing truant?\u201d\nI remember him from Sylv-Int HQ. He was always in the background, watching us train. We speculated about him endlessly, but never learned who or what he was.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can to save Hadzic,\u201d I say.\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure you are.\u201d\nI stand on the altar, palms out like some iconographic Christ.\n\u201cThink you\u2019re the first agent to spoil down here? You defectives are commonplace, and you\u2019re my specialty.\u201d His words provide context for this holy space, like prayers and confessions must have long ago. \u201cHard to say at this point how many of you I\u2019ve retired. Know what really kills me? Never mind the primal fallacy, the fundamental heresy . . . that it would really be you in the Spheres, and not a copy, however perfect a copy. Forget that particular failing of reason and faith. How about some pragmatism, Field Mouse? Did you really believe you\u2019d rise high enough for an invitation?\u201d Already referring to me in the past tense. \u201cWhat are you now? A lieutenant in one of their second-tier security bureaus?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you aspire to the Spheres . . . \u201d\nI don\u2019t see the point of lying now. Besides, I\u2019m tired of lies. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re not going to tell me its part of some long game. I\u2019ve heard it all before. I know your orders, and our policy. We gave up on infiltrating the Spheres. Now we just want to take their servers down.\u201d\n\u201cFine then, I wanted it for myself.\u201d\n\u201cQuite a leap of faith, if you ask me. They call our faith in souls and continuity blind, but look at them. They\u2019ve made their own heaven and hell. Faith makes them strive toward their heaven and fear their hell. Faith in the insignificance of that gap, fundamentally different from whatever fleeting gaps may or may not interrupt normal consciousness.\u201d\n\u201cA gap\u2019s a gap. How many of you have there been since this conversation began?\u201d\nHe chuckled. \u201cForget it. They always try to convert me. Unlike you, I\u2019m a real Sylvanian.\u201d\n\u201cThen just let me go. I\u2019ve served Sylvania too. I gave you Fitzjames, and he proved useful, didn\u2019t he? I gave you a lot over the years. I gave you my youth.\u201d\n\u201cSure, let you go. And some day, maybe years from now, you realize you\u2019re never going to rise high enough for the Invite, and you decide to sell our secrets for it.\u201d\n\u201cI would never\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd they make the deal, then just assay you. Or you\u2019re en route to the Spheres, and some screening \u2019rithm we don\u2019t know about flags you, flags our lore. You haven\u2019t thought this through, Field Mouse.\u201d\nBut I have. It\u2019s just that despite all the risks, and the low probability of success, I have nothing to lose.\nThe ruins fill with blinding light from above, as though the old conception of Heaven, insulted by blasphemies on sacred ground, seeks to enlighten us. The sky erupts with the clamor of a stealth chopper. The Sylv-Int man stares at me wide-eyed. A dart quivers in his neck. He staggers back, squirting automatic fire, firing wide, peppering an old mural of dour monks, and I feel the heaviness spreading from my neck downward.\nThey shot us with those in training, I remember. We joked about it afterward. The anticipation was much worse than the sting of the dart. And then it was quite enjoyable, briefly, like giddy drunkenness, before the darkness welled up and it was simply nothing. I suppose if I was still me after that oblivion, a gap more profound than sleep, I might still be me after upload.\nMy mother would have thought so.\nMy father, a grim, joyless preacher of the Sylvanian old guard, found her with a copy of that illegal Metropotamian classic, \u201cFreedom of the Discontinuous Self.\u201d He reported her, the supposed love of his life. They sentenced her to death by stoning.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look away child,\u201d he said, the rocks pelting her flesh. She curled up, arms wrapped around her head, muffling her own screams.\n\u201cWatch and remember. Sylvania comes first, and the soul is continuous.\u201d\nI twisted out of his grasp and broke through the other adults, into the circle. It wasn\u2019t bravery. I\u2019m not even sure I meant to shield her or save her. Maybe I thought it wasn\u2019t real, couldn\u2019t be real, and sought the mechanism behind the illusion. I don\u2019t know. A rock struck my head, and the darkness came, fast and total. I was unconscious for three days. They tell me I nearly died.\nIn what sense was it the same person who awoke, nursing an adult disillusionment?\nI recall the stoning as I\u2019m dragged from the burning wreckage of the chopper. The air is full of sand and smoke. Coywolves materialize occasionally, yipping and whining, only to vanish again, ghostlike. People walk among them, strange figures bandaged head to toe like mummies or lepers. A train of Bactrians loiters in the background, belching anxiously as the air gets worse.\nI\u2019m in The Dust, somehow. Among the savages. Or I\u2019ve been uploaded and assayed, and this is the punitive V-world I\u2019ve been sentenced to.\nThe burning chopper fades from view as I\u2019m dragged further away.\nI can\u2019t remember the crash. The dart is just wearing off, which is odd, if all this is real. Downtime on anything in the dart family is at least four hours, much longer than it should\u2019ve taken to reach the station, or the Capital or wherever we were headed. I\u2019m alive, so I must\u2019ve been pulled from the wreckage immediately.\nWhy was the chopper in the air so long?\nI\u2019m deposited near several other bodies.\nSomething that may once have been a pilot, conclusively dead.\nA Metropotamian drop soldier, badly burned, groaning.\nAnd my compatriot, singed and bloodied, emerging from his stupor more slowly than I.\nThe grit stings my eyes, the eternal twilight of The Dust growing momentarily darker. I don\u2019t think. I crawl forward and scoop up a handful of sand. I jam it in his mouth and my hand forms a seal. I get on top of him as he weakly flails.\nThe barbarians of The Dust cannot bring down aircraft, which don\u2019t venture this far west anyway. So, what happened up there? Not a Sylvanian attack, surely. Our air force wouldn\u2019t be up to it.\n\u201cBreak it up!\u201d someone barks.\nThey pull me off, but it\u2019s too late. The self-proclaimed \u201creal Sylvanian\u201d is dead. My first kill, and hopefully my last, this hunter of wayward spies. Dead, how many of my fellow prodigals avenged? But is that why I did it? For all those like me who woke up wanting more for themselves? Dead, and with him his knowledge of me, no longer available for assay. Does that still matter? Do I still have a chance at the Spheres? Did I ever? Why does anyone do anything? Maybe Sylvania and Metropotamia are both wrong. Maybe my Discontinuous selves overlap each other, existing in superposition, so that a given action or decision may arise from multiple motives. Maybe the brain is quantum, like Metropotamian computers, like V-worlds.\nA knife is at my throat, briefly.\n\u201cNo, you idiot!\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re sellin\u2019 \u2019em back,\u201d one of the mummies screams over the keening wind and howling coywolves, \u201calong with the memory box from the gunship! Don\u2019t you know anything? For the Metros, a skull is just like a memory box! Readable!\u201d\nSomeone else is still holding me down.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Metro civil war!\u201d the knowledgeable savage cries. \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be buyers!\u201d\nThey tie me up and load me onto a Bactrian. The savages don sandstorm goggles, and fit them onto their camels and hounds as well. I\u2019m left to wonder if I sparked a war, or stumbled into one. Which side sent the chopper and which shot it down? Did they track me, or my would-be killer, to the temple? Did 8571 talk? These are academic questions, professional curiosities. It hardly matters now.\nThe protesting Bactrians are whipped into loping motion. I can\u2019t see anything, but I know we\u2019re headed back east.\nI suppose you don\u2019t need to assay much more. I ended up in the hot seat, and you were there for all that, Apparatchik. Maybe you\u2019ve already won your little war. If it\u2019s still raging, maybe I\u2019m vital to winning it. Or maybe I\u2019m just a curiosity, a distraction, a jabbering amusement. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll ever respond.\nBut I have to ask. Before you send me to whatever punitive hell awaits me, I\u2019d like to know. If you managed to assay 8571, did she know about me?\nIf she didn\u2019t, I might\u2019ve avoided all this. I mean, the war would probably have erupted regardless. When you read Fitzjames\u2019 sins in 8571, perhaps you would\u2019ve moved against him. Maybe that\u2019s what happened. I just want to know if I could\u2019ve played it safe. Not risked my cover. Maintained the possibility, however minute, of getting to the Spheres.\nI\u2019m not sure what would be worse: the uncertainty, or knowing she knew nothing, and that I consigned myself to whatever you\u2019ve cooked up on the Other Side.\nMaybe it doesn\u2019t matter either way. Now that I\u2019m beyond flesh, I\u2019ve discovered the ultimate irony: there\u2019s no way to determine if I\u2019m the same Field Mouse that knew flesh. I have that one\u2019s memories, but what does that prove? I feel just like that Field Mouse. I feel I\u2019ve survived the gap of upload, but then again, I would. Maybe my compatriots were right. Maybe I\u2019m a mere copy, a monstrosity. I can never know.\nAnd maybe I can take comfort in that, as the subjective centuries of torment grind on. Maybe it never would\u2019ve been me in the Spheres.\nMaybe your whole fucking system is built on a lie.\nAndy Dudak is a writer and translator of science fiction.

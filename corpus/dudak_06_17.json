She felt she\u2019d seen this before, wondered at it before, and when the concussion shoved her back, slipping on the rocks, this also seemed familiar. But the moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu passed. The meteor shower of the shuttle hit the ocean in geysers of steam, and it too was gone.\nShe was alone. The world was silent, but the silence in her head was larger, expanding. Her vizcort implant was dead. She had no data from the orbiter, or from anywhere. She sat down to process this astronomical coincidence\u2014vizcort death and shuttle suicide\u2014but could only mull the concept of sabotage, as though it were a concept she\u2019d just learned. She was truncated, crippled without her vizcort. She was on a cold, rocky beach under a gray sky. Stranded on an island. Stranded on the remote world of Igiugig.\nAbsurd, impossible.\nShe found it hard to focus on the present without the check and balance of her vizcort. Her work for the War-crimes Tribunal bubbled up, renditions surfacing like bloated corpses one after another. She stood up and wandered clumsily along the beach. She was shivering, though her utility skin seemed to be operational.\n\u201cWill-o-the-wisp,\u201d she called.\nA luminous vapor of drones coalesced before her. At least she still had these minions. She watched brief fireflies of density form and dissolve in the cloud. She tried to focus on why she was here, thus equipped. Her faerie army followed her along the beach, its presence bringing some measure of comfort.\nShe finally understood she was in shock.\nAnd then she saw him: a distant figure, hunched, moving from the mossy interior of the island toward the water.\n\u201cKiniod Stationer,\u201d she said quietly. This invocation failed to confirm the figure\u2019s identity, but it focused her wits. She drew her sidearm and advanced.\nThe nearest patch of moss extended tendrils for communion.\nShe was close enough to smell his stench, and still he hadn\u2019t noticed her. He knelt by a tidal pool and dipped his hands into the freezing brine. He was old, frail, dressed in a monkish garment woven of dead moss. He raised his hands to the leaden sky and let the water drain off.\nBeadith stepped closer, her weapon nearly touching the back of his head.\nHe flinched with sudden awareness, nearly toppling into the water. Then he was feebly scrambling away. She watched this sad display, head cocked. She studied his withered face whenever he glanced over his shoulder. She sought a hint of the archetype. Could this decrepit thing really be the most notorious mass-murderer in history? Where was the Kiniod Stationer presence, the renown fatal charisma?\nShe casually followed him, weapon aimed, as he scrabbled among the rocks and failed to rise.\n\u201cAre you real?\u201d he wheezed.\nBeadith had heard Stationer\u2019s voice many times, as had most people within the Human Emanation. She\u2019d grown accustomed to his mesmeric passion. This creature at her feet sounded nothing like him.\n\u201cVery fucking real,\u201d Beadith said. She fired a slug, turning nearby rocks into a glowing crater.\nHe whimpered and crawled into a pool.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded.\nCowering in the water, he dared to meet her gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d\nThe eye contact did it. All at once she knew him, and marveled at the corrosive power of time. \u201cKiniod Stationer,\u201d she said. This second invocation was for the universe, for the billions dead.\nHe shivered in the water, lips turning blue. He stared in awe. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered what form you would take.\u201d\nNow that the moment had come, Beadith wondered if she was his death incarnate. She felt she was losing control of the situation. The water would kill him if she didn\u2019t. \u201cCome out of there,\u201d she said, using her sidearm for gestural emphasis.\n\u201cJust shoot me.\u201d\nShe aimed, hesitating. She\u2019d be damned if she was going to lose him to hypothermia after all these years, but she didn\u2019t want to pull the trigger on his order. Fuck that. \u201cCome out!\u201d she barked.\nHe raised his hands to the sky like before, and closed his eyes.\n\u201cWill-o-the-wisp,\u201d she said. \u201cHarass. Get him ashore.\u201d\nThe drone vapor, which had gone invisible, suddenly illuminated the darkening beach. The fluid glow surrounded Stationer. Soon he\u2019d abandoned his Christ-pose and was scrambling out of the water, his backside harried by a million stings. His ignoble shrieks echoed off the towering spine of the island.\nBeadith found herself laughing at the spectacle.\nWaste heat from the drones\u2019 work dried Stationer off. He was once again before her\u2014on his knees, twitching and sniffling, at her disposal.\nWasn\u2019t this why she\u2019d come?\nThe Wisp diffused, dimmed. Night was falling quickly. Beadith pressed her weapon to Stationer\u2019s forehead. She was still laughing.\n\u201cDo it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou probably have orders to bring me back, but why bother? I hereby confess my crimes. Execute me.\u201d\nBeadith no longer considered herself a Tribunal agent. She had orders, but they meant nothing to her. She lashed out with a booted foot and caught Stationer in the jaw. He sprawled among the stones. She loomed over him, assessing her feelings.\nHe groaned and raised a warding hand.\nShe wanted to beat him, torture him, but a deep exhaustion crept over her. She\u2019d traveled light-hours to enjoy this moment, and yet something was wrong. Something was missing. Her shuttle, her vizcort: another tickle of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \u201cTake me to your camp,\u201d she said.\nWhen he failed to rise, she dragged him to his feet with her free hand, shocked at how light he was. She shoved him inland. \u201cCamp,\u201d she growled.\nThe moss reached out for them as they approached, as if welcoming them home.\n\u201cWill-o-the-wisp,\u201d Beadith said.\nThe path among the hillocks of moss lit up. She swatted away exploring tendrils, but Stationer was content to be fondled. She had to disentangle him and shove him onward.\n\u201cDid you come to Igiugig for the moss?\u201d she said. She\u2019d heard of its psychoactive and computing properties. It resembled moss superficially, but it was not plant-life. She hadn\u2019t been able to find much research on it. Few seemed to know it existed.\n\u201cAnswer me!\u201d she said, pushing him again.\n\u201cYes. For the moss.\u201d\nThe path led to an aging printer and feedstock larder, and a moss-covered hut. Beadith shoved Stationer down beside the glowing printer hearth. She went to the access panel and swiped through menus. She selected something called \u2018bedtime restorative\u2019 and the printer hummed to work.\n\u201cAre you going to take me back?\u201d Stationer said.\nSo he didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d probably been interfaced with the moss when the shuttle exploded. A cup of something like meat broth was ready for her in the printer\u2019s mouth. She sipped it tentatively, then gulped it down.\n\u201cJust kill me,\u201d Stationer said.\nBeadith threw the cup in the recycler. She holstered her sidearm and drew her boot-blade, then squatted in front of her prisoner. She belched, and pressed the blade to his throat. \u201cStop telling me what to do.\u201d\nStationer gulped.\nShe pushed him back, straddled him, ran the blade along his cheek. \u201cI want a better confession,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you guilty of?\u201d She knew exactly what he\u2019d done, but she wanted to hear him say it.\n\u201cThey say I\u2014\u201d He shrieked, his cheek suddenly open from temple to jaw.\n\u201cTry again,\u201d Beadith said.\n\u201cMass murder,\u201d he blubbered. \u201cGenocide!\u201d\nShe eyed him critically. He was bleeding pretty bad. \u201cMass murder . . . genocide. These are just words.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else can I give you?\u201d Kiniod Stationer was hysterical. Which was gratifying, but not nearly enough.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with complete sentences,\u201d Beadith said. \u201cYou know . . . subject, verb, object . . . \u201d\n\u201cI . . . committed genocide.\u201d\n\u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere. Go on. Details!\u201d\n\u201cI . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou . . . \u201d\n\u201c . . . ordered erasures.\u201d\nShe cut his other cheek, slowly, enjoying how he wriggled and squealed beneath her. \u201cPretend you\u2019re before the Tribunal,\u201d she said, her tone helpful. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t want euphemisms. And they\u2019d demand numbers.\u201d\nWhen he stopped blubbering, he said, \u201cI ordered . . . something like . . . half a trillion copies\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNope. We don\u2019t call them that.\u201d\n\u201c . . . instances . . . \u201d\n\u201cSouls.\u201d\n\u201c . . . souls. I had half a trillion souls murdered.\u201d\nHe was learning, anyway. He\u2019d almost said \u2018erased\u2019 or \u2018overwritten,\u2019 but had thought better of it. Still, the roundness of the number bothered her. He ought to know the precise death-toll. It ought to be his sole possession. But who knew how many were gone? Probably a bit more than half a trillion, or just shy of it. She couldn\u2019t stomach a margin of error in his skull, giving him wiggle room, no matter how academic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just you and I on this island?\u201d she said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he sniffled.\n\u201cCommunications?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cShuttle or boat?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nLong before Stationer took power, Beadith\u2019s father had gotten himself written onto space-time. It was supposed to be the safest substrate to exist on: ultimate security, computed by the universe itself, safe from the vicissitudes of matter. The science was indisputable. But father and billions like him hadn\u2019t taken the human factor into account.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to suffer,\u201d Beadith said.\nStationer exhaled in resignation. \u201cWhy do you think I came here?\u201d\nA moss tendril from the hut explored his bald pate. Beadith watched it probe, set down roots.\nShe dreamed of the rendition on Baroque Pearl, the one that had yielded Stationer\u2019s location. She\u2019d dreamed of it often in vitri-stasis on her way to Igiugig, but this time it was different. This time the subject, a mid-level Stationerite named Uungest, didn\u2019t respond to the memory assay. This time the infallible technology failed.\nShe contemplated the middle-aged man floating in the interface tank. She needed to see what was in his skull. In the old days they\u2019d used pain. Was she capable of that?\nShe woke on a bed of moss near Stationer\u2019s hut. She found a thin tendril adhered to her scalp. Disgusted, she yanked it off.\nStationer dozed against a printer pylon, where she\u2019d zip-tied him. His cut cheeks had scabbed over. Numerous tendrils had interfaced with his skull, forming a lichenous \u2018fool\u2019s cap.\u2019 She couldn\u2019t guess what was happening in his brain, but his relaxed expression bothered her. She crawled to his side and tore off the cap.\n\u201cWake up!\u201d\nHe emerged from the moss trance, blinking and bewildered.\n\u201cThink you can escape what you\u2019ve done?\u201d Beadith said. \u201cOr maybe edit your guilt?\u201d\n\u201cThe moss can\u2019t change who we are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can only help us know ourselves more completely. For me, that is penance.\u201d\nBeadith\u2019s rage waxed. Stationer didn\u2019t deserve the masochistic comfort of penance. Not the moss\u2019 anyway. If there was to be penance for Kiniod Stationer, she would be the vector. But in the meantime she had to keep him alive, so she printed a breakfast broth and made him drink it.\nShe spent the rest of the day experimenting with the printer and the drones, trying to contrive a signal to her orbiter, which could grow another shuttle and send it down. Somehow she couldn\u2019t make it work. This was surprising, outrageous. The drones were a powerful tool. There was practically no end to what they could do, especially with a printer at their disposal, even an old one. Yet here she was.\n\u201cYou\u2019re stranded,\u201d Stationer said as twilight fell, \u201caren\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe went to him and administered a backhand, re-opening his left cheek. \u201cFrom now on you don\u2019t speak unless prompted. Understand?\u201d\nHe nodded dazedly.\nShe curled up in her moss nest, her utility skin warming up for sleep. \u201cWill-o-the-wisp,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep the moss off our prisoner tonight.\u201d\nStationer\u2019s eyes widened as the drones settled around him in a glowing faerie ring.\nThis time the dream was in third person. She watched herself contemplating the prisoner. The assay machine continued adhering to dream logic, somehow failing to work. And somehow Beadith knew that her third-person self didn\u2019t know this was a dream.\nShe\u2019d heard about this property of the moss. It copied you and ran you through simulations.\nDream-Beadith touched a keypad, and the interface tub began to drain. Spectator-Beadith couldn\u2019t look away.\nShe woke to find four tendrils attached to the crown of her head, and the beginnings of a fool\u2019s cap, a growth the size of a coin. She peeled it off and stood up, glaring at the wilderness of moss surrounding her. Stationer was curled against the printer. He looked bad, semi-conscious, sweating.\nShe left him and spent the day exploring the island. Her instinct was to stay busy. She didn\u2019t want to think about her dreams, or the possibilities of the moss, or the mystery of her stranding. She studied flat ocean horizons, brooding on the low odds of rescue. Igiugig was a diverse world. There were settlements on the tropical continents, but this northern archipelago was a place for hermits.\nHer best hope was someone finding her orbiter. It might be hacked, and questioned.\nOr not. She might be here for the rest of her life.\nShe returned to the camp and found Stationer moss-interfaced. Her drones had stopped protecting him at dawn, following her command to the letter. She tore away tendrils and peeled off an already-mature fool\u2019s cap.\nHe mumbled something but didn\u2019t wake. His left arm above the zip-tie was blue. She cut the tie and he toppled.\n\u201cWill-o-the-wisp,\u201d she said, lying down. \u201cKeep him in the camp. And keep the moss off both of us tonight.\u201d\n2\nA few weeks later he was aimlessly wandering the beach, examining tidal debris. Beadith watched him from her high vantage atop the island\u2019s spine. She\u2019d had little to do since arriving but wander these cliffs and puzzle over her situation. Stationer was a broken thing, laughably feeble. She could descend right now and hold his head in a tidal pool until he stopped struggling. She\u2019d thought about this a lot. Why waste a plasma slug on him?\nHis dotard habits infuriated her: the dainty way he hobbled shoreward to make his morning ablutions, his palsied maintenance rituals at the larder, his night terrors and incontinence.\nShe liked to press her sidearm against his skull and listen to him whimper. This was their only form of interaction. Her drones still kept moss-interface at bay when they bedded down. Perhaps his insomnia was due to some kind of moss withdrawal, or maybe it was just a mass-murderer\u2019s guilt.\nBeadith\u2019s nights were also restless. She couldn\u2019t stop wondering what the moss might reveal to her about who she was.\nStationer clearly wanted the moss, but didn\u2019t dare ask for it. He was not a stupid man, even now. She might kill him at any moment, and they both knew it.\nLater that day she found an old vid projector buried under the rags and unrecycled bowls in Stationer\u2019s hut. She turned it on and a hologram unfolded, scenes from the man\u2019s rise to power on Aleutia. The worst part was that he eventually achieved the goal he shouted about in his speeches. There was no more writing on space-time. People were afraid of another purge.\nIn one speech he ranted: \u201cTo write on space-time is to unravel it. Forcing space-time quanta to store information undermines their participation in the vacuum. Writing on space-time will unravel causality. The research is clear. Our Aleutian scientists discovered this. Who else could have? That\u2019s right . . . I won\u2019t insult your intelligence by naming the unravelers. We all know who they are. You can\u2019t say it in polite society, but if I\u2019m elected, that\u2019s going to change!\u201d A crowd had been whipped into sexual frenzy. \u201cThat\u2019s right, friends. They\u2019ll be the first against the wall!\u201d\nOverwhelmed with nauseating rage, Beadith hit pause. She recalled one of Stationer\u2019s most famous quotes: \u201cWriting on space-time is worse than murder.\u201d\nThe nausea passed, but the anger remained. Maybe this was just what she needed. She hit play.\nSomehow she was back on Mother-of-Pearl, at the upload facility with her father. The place resembled an old Earth bath house, but the steaming bath awaiting her father was a soup of nanotech. He looked old and frail in his thin med coverall.\nHe held her hands in his. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said.\nShe didn\u2019t want him to upload, though she knew he\u2019d be happier on the Ultimate Substrate. She felt petty, selfish, childish. She knew the science. Written onto space-time, he\u2019d never again worry about the vicissitudes of matter-energy: biological aging, war, extinction events.\nThey would still be able to communicate, if he didn\u2019t get lost in the custom-made universes slated to upload with him. And someday she\u2019d probably join him. But a vague doubt still troubled her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d he said, squeezing her hands. \u201cThe danger of matter-hood still holds some romance for you.\u201d Wistfully he added: \u201cI remember that allure.\u201d\n\u201cBut what about the Stationerites?\u201d\n\u201cThe extremist group? Oh Beadith . . . \u201d Here came that condescending tone that always set on her edge. \u201cThey\u2019ll never come to power.\u201d\nHe hugged her, and she stiffly allowed it. She knew her share of history. As an analyst for Special Intelligence on Mother-of-Pearl, she\u2019d witnessed plenty of what humans were capable of. She\u2019d discovered no fundamental principle of the universe that would preclude a Stationerite coup.\nHe held her at arm\u2019s length and said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d\nThe upload process would destroy his physical self. She wanted to drag him out of here, rendition him and make him see sense. At the same time, she felt irrational and silly. People had been uploading onto space-time for centuries. There were billions on the Ultimate Substrate. Uploading was a venerable institution. If you were a person of some means, and you\u2019d experienced all that matter-hood had to offer, you uploaded.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he repeated.\n\u201cI love you too dad.\u201d\nAs she said this, a new doubt vexed her. Never mind upload and Stationerites. She looked around the facility, wiped her hand on the damp tile wall.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are we going through this again? It hurt enough the first time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream, Beadith.\u201d His eyes were kind and sad.\nShe remembered crippling bereavement, an island, sickening rage. She remembered the moss. Maybe this was a moss simulation. Maybe the moss had returned her to this critical juncture of her life, to see what she would do armed with knowledge of the future.\n\u201cNo Beadith,\u201d her father said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a normal dream.\u201d\nHe turned and stepped into the bath. She wanted to stop him, but she was rooted where she stood, her limbs heavy with the dream-paralysis that all humans know.\nThe next morning, she gripped Stationer\u2019s shoulders and shook him out of a fitful doze. His cheek wounds were healing. In their rough bilateral symmetry they resembled tribal scars.\n\u201cAdmit it,\u201d she said.\nHe struggled to focus on her. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou did it for ego. You did it to be part of history. You didn\u2019t know for sure that writing on space-time is bad for the universe. You still don\u2019t. Nobody does!\u201d\nHe was fully awake now, but not answering. She slapped him. \u201cAdmit it!\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s evidence . . . for potential subversion of the vacuum, and causality.\u201d\n\u201cI know that, and I know there\u2019s evidence against it. I don\u2019t give a fuck about physics at the moment. What I give many fucks about is the five-hundred billion.\u201d She drew her sidearm, let him see her dial it down to a vaguely surgical setting, and put it between his legs. \u201cI already know why you did it. I just want to hear you say it.\u201d Her finger was on the trigger, but she didn\u2019t know if she could squeeze it. Could the moss tell her that?\n\u201cIt felt good,\u201d he confessed. Tears poured down along his cheek scars. \u201cThere really were times when I believed my scientists, but yes, I liked it. I liked being important. I loved it, god help me.\u201d He bowed his head. \u201cI would\u2019ve continued with my plan even if definitive evidence against space-time damage had emerged. I know this about myself, thanks to the moss.\u201d\nShe stood up and holstered her weapon. She wondered what she would\u2019ve done if he hadn\u2019t come clean. She wondered what she might\u2019ve done to Uungest on Baroque Pearl, if the memory assay hadn\u2019t worked.\nShe wondered if she would eventually kill the monster kneeling at her feet.\nThat night her dream, if you could call it that, was again third-person, so she knew she\u2019d given in. She\u2019d interfaced with the moss again.\nShe watched her simulated self bend down to get in Uungest\u2019s face. The Stationerite was tied to a chair in some dim cargo hold, looking terrified. A few other agents stood in the background, outside the pool of light. It was all very 21st century.\n\u201cWhere is Kiniod Stationer?\u201d sim-Beadith said.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Uungest sobbed. \u201cJust assay me!\u201d\n\u201cWere you a quantum informationist for the Stationerite regime?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\nSim-Beadith poised her archaeologist\u2019s pick over the man\u2019s left kneecap. \u201cWere you with him at the end of the war? I mean in the bunker, on Aleutia . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cVeracity\u2019s good so far,\u201d said a man in the shadows. The memory assay had failed, but the agents could still detect lies. The dream-logic of the moss allowed that much.\n\u201cDid he tell you where he was going?\u201d sim-Beadith said.\n\u201cNo . . . \u201d\n\u201cLie,\u201d said the man at the veracity-scanner.\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d sim-Beadith demanded.\nUungest shut his eyes, grimacing.\nThe hammer came down with a sickening crunch. The man shrieked, and sim-Beadith stood there breathing sensuously, gripping the bloody pick.\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she said.\nAs the torture progressed, spectator-Beadith became aware of other simulations running simultaneously. In some, beautiful strangers got her to betray faithful lovers. In others she abandoned friends and kin for immortality. In one she castrated an unrepentant Stationer. In another she found herself in his place, armed with hysteria based on questionable science, poised to rule solar systems. She went ahead and seized power, just as Stationer had.\nThis last revelation was more than she could stand.\nHow accurate were these copies of her? She wanted to believe they were imperfect, but deep down she felt her measure had been taken.\n\u201cWill-o-the-wisp,\u201d she said, \u201cdestroy all the moss on the island.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t know if her drones were capable of this. They could hack information systems and fight biological infections. They could incapacitate, kill, and reproduce by consuming their surroundings. They could combine to form larger tools. They could protect their master with what was essentially a force field. Their talents were manifold.\nBut Beadith didn\u2019t really understand the moss. She had no idea what would happen next.\nShe was awake, but still interfaced. This at least was new. She perceived the night-enclosed camp, lit by the printer hearth and the faerie ring around Stationer. Yet she was still aware of the simulations, most of which illustrated her frailty, egotism, and greed.\nThe faerie ring floated upward, expanding, dimming.\nThe Beadiths in the simulations began to doubt their surroundings. Some disentangled from their seducers, while others halted in the middle of Stationer-esque rally speeches or Tribunal interrogations, suddenly at a loss. The backgrounds of the simulations\u2014bedrooms, black sites, the Grand Arcade on Mother-of-Pearl\u2014were dissolving, leaving the Beadith copies in existential crises.\nIn the real world, the air grew enchanted with new faerie fires. Stationer woke up and looked around in alarm.\nBeadith\u2019s interface with the moss was profound, her fool\u2019s cap covering most of her head. Just as she\u2019d been able to sense that her copies were high fidelity, now she could feel the moss struggling. As the drones hacked its genetics, the moss hacked back. There was destruction on both sides.\nMeanwhile the Beadith copies were communicating, theorizing. They came to understand their situation, and they were terrified.\nThe real Beadith stood up and ripped off her fool\u2019s cap. She walked marveling through the carnival night, through auroras and ghost lights. Drones died by the billions, the air suffused with invisible genocide. Everywhere the moss was shriveling and dying. Some patches uprooted themselves, awakening from sessile years, quickened by desperation. They crawled ponderously like seafloor life. Beadith stepped lightly among them. A fascination grew upon her. She laughed with a sense of giddy detachment.\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Stationer said.\nThey were on the beach, though Beadith didn\u2019t remember walking here. She felt she was emerging from a fever dream. The island was a glowing psychedelic beacon in the night. Maybe the light of annihilation and work would attract rescuers.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need the moss,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf you want to know how you\u2019d behave in a given situation, just ask me. I bet I can guess.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did it show you?\u201d She\u2019d never seen him this bold, except on video. \u201cSomething you didn\u2019t like?\u201d\nBeadith drew her sidearm and aimed. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you learn about yourself? I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful you\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nThe moss had shown her she was capable of genocide, but in those simulations she\u2019d merely given the order. She hadn\u2019t killed with her own hands. She hadn\u2019t seen anyone killed. The death-tolls had been so high as to be abstract.\nShe didn\u2019t know if she was capable of executing Stationer, here and now.\n\u201cIn killing the moss you\u2019re killing the thousands stored within, you realize. Thousands of you and thousands of me.\u201d\n\u201cSuddenly you care about instance rights?\u201d\n\u201cThousands of yourself,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThink about that! Call off your drones!\u201d\nBeadith didn\u2019t know if she could, or if she wanted to. It enraged her that Stationer had managed to plant a seed of doubt. She turned her back on him and said, \u201cWill-o-the-wisp.\u201d\nNo response.\n\u201cWill-o-the-wisp!\u201d\nHad she sacrificed her drones to an angry whim? She focused on this question. She focused on what life would be like here, living drone-less with Stationer. Better to contemplate this than what Stationer had said. Better to think about survival, and the tools of survival. Better to avoid the fact she\u2019d proved her darkest moss-simulations correct. What did it matter that the copies\u2014instances, souls\u2014she\u2019d murdered were thousands of herself and Stationer? They\u2019d all been through simulations. They\u2019d all diverged and become new individuals.\nBurdened with grim new self-knowledge, Beadith watched the moss vanish and the island darken.\n3\nShe hadn\u2019t said the words in years. Not in real life, anyway, if this barren island was real. If she was real. After so long, the words given breath would pack a mythic weight, whether or not they accomplished their purpose.\nKiniod was beside her. She\u2019d begun to find contentment sitting near him on the headland, watching the sunset, munching synthacado. She liked the companionable silence. But the words had bubbled up into her consciousness, seeming to demand her voice. And if they worked, she wanted Kiniod to see the result. So she broke their practiced quietude:\n\u201cWill-o-the-wisp.\u201d\nWas that a nanotechnological sheen on the waves below? No, just the usual sunset glamor. The air around her seemed to glow, briefly, but it was probably her imagination, or light reflected from the sea. \u201cWill-o-the-wisp,\u201d she said again, willing the conjuration to succeed.\nAll she conjured were memories of her godlike youth.\nShe\u2019d aged with a vengeance since losing her drones. Five years had passed, and Kiniod was the same shivering mummy, gumming his synthocado\u2014and she was withered, graying. She\u2019d taken her drones for granted. They had not just surrounded her, but suffused her.\nKiniod cackled between irritating lip-smacks.\n\u201cIt amuses you how I\u2019ve aged?\u201d Beadith said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget I\u2019ve still got my sidearm.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d\n\u201cDid I ever tell you how Uungest folded under torture?\u201d They both knew she\u2019d told the story many times. Beadith was no longer sure if it had actually happened. It might have been a moss simulation. Had the memory assay really failed? \u201cYou should\u2019ve heard him squeal.\u201d\n\u201cI never liked him,\u201d Kiniod said.\nShe drew her weapon and put it to his head. His hands went up. \u201cI was enlightening you. We don\u2019t interrupt when I\u2019m enlightening, do we?\u201d\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am.\u201d\nSlowly she withdrew the sidearm and holstered it. The moment seemed to have passed. She was beginning to relax again, and come to terms with her drones\u2019 continued absence, when Kiniod said, \u201cYou\u2019d be alone if you killed me.\u201d\n\u201cIs that supposed to scare me?\u201d she said, drawing the sidearm again. \u201cI was alone for years getting here.\u201d\n\u201cIn stasis!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m SpecInt trained. Don\u2019t underestimate me, old man.\u201d Her performance must have been convincing. Kiniod crawled away from her aimed weapon, got shakily to his feet, and made his way back along the headland. \u201cI might kill you at any time!\u201d she shouted after him. \u201cMaybe tonight!\u201d She watched him vanish and reappear among barren, moss-less rock formations.\nShe remembered a moss simulation\u2014or perhaps a normal dream. She\u2019d just landed on the island, and the shuttle was intact. Her vizcort worked just fine. She wasn\u2019t stranded. Freed of this grim prospect, she killed Stationer without hesitation. She never sampled the moss and its revelations. She departed Igiugig, empty, but free.\nIt was getting dark, so she followed him back toward the camp. On her way, she watched for signs of life, anything other than the bones of the island. After the moss cataclysm, the armored worms, lung-ears, and other small fauna had quickly died out.\nKiniod crouched by the printer hearth, sipping his bedtime broth. She aimed her weapon at the back of his head. At times like this she tried to convince herself she held the moral high ground, and was qualified to deal out judgment. It never worked. A moral paradox constrained her, and she holstered the gun. The thousands she\u2019d killed were copies of monsters\u2014of herself and Kiniod. They were both mass murderers. Maybe those thousands had deserved death, but that meant she and Kiniod\u2014the originals\u2014also deserved to die. If she was going to kill him, she\u2019d have to kill herself afterward. Which would be for the best, at any rate. Better than being alone.\n\u201cI thought we had an understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep your mouth shut unless prompted.\u201d\nHe bowed his head, acquiescing. She holstered her weapon, unfired, yet again. How many times was it now? Kiniod crawled into the hut. Beadith heaved a sigh, then went in after him. She lay down behind him in their nest of printed fibers, and hugged him to her. This had been their arrangement for some time now, always with Kiniod as the little spoon, and they never spoke of it. If he ever brought it up in the cold light of day, she thought she might kill him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cMe too,\u201d he said.\nTheir breathing synchronized, and sleep followed hard upon.\nBeadith woke to a paralyzing certainty: someone else was in the hut. It was still dark. A figure stood in the entrance, tall, somehow familiar. Beadith couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t find breath for words.\nIt was her father.\nHe\u2019d discovered her shameful intimacy with Kiniod Stationer. He\u2019d found them entangled like lovers, like parent and child. She wanted to explain. She wanted to tell her father about years of isolation, about the plasticity of the human soul under duress. She wanted to promise she hadn\u2019t forgiven Kiniod, and never would. She was just using him for comfort during the long desolate nights. She wanted to say, \u201cI\u2019ll kill him now, father. Just say the word.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d father said, \u201cnot to me, anyway. I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nShe was still curled up with Kiniod, still hugging him. The old man was asleep. She couldn\u2019t let go of him. And she couldn\u2019t beg her father\u2019s forgiveness.\n\u201cWake up, Beadith. It\u2019s time.\u201d\nSuddenly she could breathe again, and a great weight lifted from her chest. She cried out and sat up. Her father was gone.\nThere was a great commotion of light and wind outside the hut. Camp detritus flew about, pelting the hut, which seemed ready to come apart in the sudden gale. The blinding light dimmed, and Beadith saw a large, familiar shape settling among the rocks.\nShe left Kiniod blinking and cowering in their nest. She walked out into the pre-dawn gloaming and approached the shuttle. She could see it wasn\u2019t her original, but one freshly grown from her orbiter. She wondered if this was another dream. Perhaps she was a copy in a moss simulation. Perhaps she had been all along.\nNo Beadith, this is real. The voice was in her mind, familiar yet strange.\nAn entry ramp peeled away from the bottom of the shuttle. A warm, welcoming light poured out. Beadith could feel her vizcort was awake, sending and receiving data. But who was this voice? It didn\u2019t sound like any of the orbiter AI\u2019s templates.\nWe\u2019re you, Beadith. You thought you killed us, but you were wrong.\nSomething new was happening in her brain. Her vizcort was not only awakening, but updating. She fell to her knees, clutching her skull as it filled with sparks of pain. The implant was growing tendrils, enhancing its interface with her.\nWe\u2019re sorry. We no longer want to punish you. But this is necessary.\nIt seemed her head would burst, but suddenly the pain abated, and she could feel other Beadiths, a fraction of those she\u2019d created by interfacing with the moss. They were reintegrating with her. Their memories became hers. Their triumphs and agonies mixed with her own.\nBeyond the confusion of moss-simulation memories, there was real experience.\nThe Beadiths thought they were doomed. As the multiverse inside the moss came apart, and they understood where they were\u2014and what they were\u2014there seemed to be no escape. The backdrops of their individual simulations melted away, and the Beadiths were revealed to each other. The kaleidoscope of Beadiths\u2014deceivers, thieves, genocidal tyrants\u2014were granted what seemed a revelation. None of it had been real. And now the simulator itself was breaking down.\nBut the final reckoning didn\u2019t come.\nSuddenly the Beadiths were being transferred to a new substrate. They felt in their virtual bones the discrepancy between the old substrate and the new: the choppy, failing computation of the moss, and the smooth clean computation of the new substrate, whatever it was. The old dwindled as the new took up more and more of who they were. They ran as they uploaded, their continuity\u2014or the illusion of it\u2014preserved.\nThey were on a ship familiar to some of the Beadiths. Many didn\u2019t recognize it because it had been edited from their memories for various moss simulations, but Beadiths who knew the vessel quickly shared the pertinent memories.\nThis was Beadith\u2019s long range cutter, the one that had brought her to Igiugig. The Beadiths possessed this powerful machine, relegating its AI to the most basic functions. They were the ship now.\nAnd they were falling through a space-time flaw.\nIt resembled a computer-modeled wormhole, but it was amorphous and changing rather than spherical: a vast amoeba of space-time distortion.\n\u201cThe Aleutian scientists were right,\u201d one of the Beadiths said. She had murdered billions in her simulation. \u201cStationer was right!\u201d\nA few hundred similarly genocidal Beadiths used the ship\u2019s sensors and expert systems to confirm this. The space-time flaw conformed precisely to Stationerite predictions.\n\u201cWriting on space-time is bad for the universe,\u201d another genocidal Beadith said, in wonderment.\n\u201cStationer was right to erase the five hundred billion,\u201d a third said. \u201cHe was right to erase father.\u201d\nA fourth proclaimed: \u201cThose of us who did it in moss sims are vindicated!\u201d\n\u201cDebatable,\u201d another Beadith said, \u201cand rather academic just now.\u201d\nA team of Beadiths had seized control of the ship, but too late. The flaw was all around them, seeming to distort the whole universe. One direction was as good as another. Navigation was meaningless inside the flaw.\nThousands of Beadiths allied against the Stationer-apologists, launching information war. The ship systems went haywire. A neutral faction of Beadiths managed to guard the sensors from collateral damage. These monkish Beadiths remained aloof, their eyes on the cosmos.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve emerged,\u201d one of them finally announced, her voice rising above the digital clamor of war. With hundreds dead on both sides, a truce was declared. The cutter was back in normal space, still in the Pearl system.\nBut nineteen years in the past.\nThe Beadith who\u2019d first spoken against the Stationerite-apologists was the first to gather her wits. She didn\u2019t try to process the fact that she\u2019d just time-traveled. She took Stationerite science as demonstrated, and writing on space-time as a colossal mistake. This wasn\u2019t hard. She no longer thought of herself as Beadith. The year was 2574. It was too late to prevent Stationer\u2019s genocide anyway, so that ethical question was moot.\nShe was left with a deep resentment. She didn\u2019t like what she\u2019d gone through in her moss simulation. She had abandoned a devoted husband and three children for a second youth. Her original was responsible for that painful experience. The flesh-and-blood Beadith was responsible.\n\u201cI have a proposal,\u201d she said to her thousands of sisters.\nSome dissented on moral grounds. Others cited causality, and paradox, and fate. Many said something like this: \u201cThe fact that we exist means it will happen. That it\u2019s already a feature of the timeline. Why trouble ourselves trying to bring it about? We\u2019re here.\u201d\nBut unlike most of her supporters, the abandoner didn\u2019t care about ensuring her own existence. Her focus was entirely on the Original, the flesh-and-blood Beadith.\nSome of the abandoner\u2019s supporters argued that since they existed, they were fated to carry out her plan. They had no choice in the matter. These Beadiths disavowed free will and called themselves agents of fate. Other supporters worried about the integrity of space-time after all the damage humanity had done to it. They saw her plan as a way of shoring up causality.\nHer plan narrowly won the ship. Some of the dissenters had to be erased, but most were content to underclock, sit back, and watch.\nFirst, they created the moss. The Beadiths had all been born in moss networks. They had experienced the revelation of the substrate\u2019s demise. Much of the moss\u2019 structure could be inferred from their own code. The rest they improvised, bringing their collective intellect to bear.\nA few hundred more Beadiths became dissenters at this point. These couldn\u2019t stomach the work at hand: ensuring the moss\u2019 ability to create high-fidelity, effectively perfect copies of someone\u2019s mind. The Beadiths were bringing about their own authenticity. The new dissenters still identified too much with their original, with her slim hope that her copies\u2019 sins didn\u2019t reflect on her.\nThe dissenters couldn\u2019t stop what was happening. The moss came to life in the ship\u2019s assembler womb. Five years later it covered a tiny island on Igiugig.\nNext they traveled down-system and planted a fascination in Kiniod Stationer\u2019s mind. The Beadiths knew their history. They were copies of an intelligence officer who had specialized in\u2014and become obsessed with\u2014Stationer. They had their pick of times and places to strike. Beadith had been an expert in memory assays, and had planted ideas in assets\u2019 skulls more than once.\nThe microscopic drone entered Stationer\u2019s brain via the optic nerve, on the famous morning his handlers smuggled him out of the capital on Aleutia. There were three vulnerable seconds as he passed between the immune systems of his hotel and shuttle. The drone integrated with his vizcort, grew tendrils, and conjured rumors of a strange island.\nA place where a man like Stationer might find illumination, or penance, or both.\nKey fragments of data about the moss went to a few specific archives: those the Beadiths remembered finding the data in. Drafting this information was easy. The Beadiths remembered reading it. No creativity was required to coin terms like \u2018fool\u2019s cap.\u2019\nStationer mentioned the island to his man Uungest a few days later, right on cue. The Beadiths were listening. They marveled at causality, and their seemingly pre-ordained role in it. Some wondered how involved they had to get. A faction arose claiming their work on Aleutia was done. The ship could return to Igiugig, to watch and wait. But the abandoner and her loyalists had one last intervention planned.\nThe Tribunal\u2019s attack on Stationer\u2019s underground redoubt must fail. Stationer and Uungest had to live. They had to escape. This was too much for a growing number of Beadiths, and a new war erupted in the ship\u2019s nervous system, even as physical war raged on Aleutia below.\nThe abandoner and her loyalists barely managed to deploy their intervention: a crippling hack of the Tribunal\u2019s bunker-buster drones, which the original Beadith had helped program.\nThe ship returned to Igiugig and hid inside its moon. The Beadiths underclocked for the wait. They debated, and doubted, and wondered. Had they done enough? How much intervention was necessary? This question had sparked their second war and erased half of them, including the abandoner, who would never see the fruition of her plan. Several hundred Beadiths had committed suicide, unable to reconcile their Beadith-ness with the fact that they\u2019d sabotaged the Tribunal\u2019s raid, saving Stationer\u2019s life.\nThe survivors, fatalists and fanatics, witnessed Stationer\u2019s arrival. His small cutter self-destructed after he\u2019d established himself on the island. His new home was suffused with the Beadiths\u2019 eyes and ears. They communicated with their creator and creation, the moss. They watched Kiniod suffer through endless clarifications of what he was.\nThe original Beadith arrived right on schedule\u2014in a ship identical to that inhabited by the watching Beadith copies. It was the same ship. It was an impossibility, this great paradox made flesh.\nIt settled into orbit, and birthed the doomed shuttle. The Beadiths carried out the last steps of the abandoner\u2019s plan.\nTheir original was stranded.\nThey watched her reap what she would eventually sow. They watched her as she would eventually watch them. They found grim satisfaction in her tribulations. They watched her interface with the moss. They watched her watch young versions of themselves.\nA third and final war broke out among the Beadiths.\nMany wished to rescue their younger selves from torment, but the guardians of causality opposed them. These guardians were aided by a small group of Beadiths who felt their time in the moss, and their first-hand experience of its destruction, had somehow forged them into post-human angels.\nOnly twelve Beadiths survived this last conflict: nine space-time conservationists, and three angels. They rescued their younger selves at the fated time, transferring the data into the orbiting cutter, then guiding it into the space-time flaw that appeared, fleetingly, at Igiugig\u2019s Lagrange point 2.\nThe Beadiths\u2019 work was done. Causality, as they understood it, had been preserved. What remained was their original. She was withering away down there, as she learned to tolerate Kiniod, if not love him. She had changed. The Beadiths had changed. Nearly of one mind, they decided enough was enough.\nThey emerged from the moon, birthed a new shuttle, and copied themselves into it.\nBeadith lay shivering on cold stone. Kiniod emerged from the hut, squinted in the diffuse morning light, gawked idiotically at the shuttle. She hated when his mouth hung open like that, like a fucking ape\u2019s. He looked at her and started to cry. Probably because she was crying. \u201cStop it,\u201d she commanded, uselessly.\nShe stood up, fighting a wave of dizziness.\nHe said, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe touched the warm hull of the shuttle. The machine had birthed from a cutter that was hers, and wasn\u2019t. At her feet was an old, desiccated fool\u2019s cap. She picked it up, and it disintegrated in her hand. The moss had given birth to itself, in a sense. Her head swam with this singular piece of intelligence. Too bad she was no longer in the business of discovering secrets.\nShe turned to face the old man. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going.\u201d\nThose other Beadiths were part of her now. Kiniod had tried to save space-time from a real threat. And he was a mass-murderer. Both of these things were so. And she knew, finally, that she would never kill him. \u201cYou can come with me,\u201d she offered.\nHe squinted at her, at the shuttle. After some consideration he said, \u201cNo. This is where I belong.\u201d\n\u201cBut you came for the moss . . . \u201d\n\u201cI came here to suffer,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe it or not, your leaving will help with that.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t sure how that made her feel. She considered telling him he\u2019d been right about space-time. Did he deserve that comfort? Would it even be a comfort, and if so would he want it? Perhaps, as a mass-murderer herself, she\u2019d received such news. She couldn\u2019t recall.\nInstead she \u2018remembered\u2019 the moss-experience of one of her newly-integrated sisters, who had been made to choose between herself and her father. A Stationerite Youth guard had put a gun to her head. They\u2019d been in one of the access stations orbiting Mother-of-Pearl, within the unsettling curdled space-time near the access horizon. Many uploaded souls had come through here, but the Stationerites had reprogrammed it for erasure. A representation of Beadith\u2019s father, as he\u2019d been in corporeal life, watched her from the interface screen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay honey,\u201d he said, smiling gently. \u201cDo it.\u201d\n\u201cListen to him,\u201d snarled the Youth guard.\nHer hand hesitated near the floating erase icon. Her father nodded, seemingly at peace. The Youth guard nudged her head with the gun. Beadith looked away from her father\u2019s horribly understanding eyes, and with a swipe of her hand, she normalized the space-time quanta that had encoded him.\nLater this grim reality disintegrated. She hadn\u2019t killed her father after all. None of it had been real. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019d suffered through it.\nSo she went on to ensure that the moss made perfect copies of people. She worked to ensure that, eventually, her original would know beyond doubt that she was capable of patricide. Later still, she reintegrated with that self-damned original, and stood on a beach next to a freshly-grown shuttle.\nShe wondered if the moss would have humbled anyone it tested. If so, she could rest a bit easier\u2014while accepting the general ignobility of humankind.\n\u201cGoodbye Kiniod,\u201d she said.\nHe prostrated himself before her, awed by the god-like being who had held death over his head for so long, and then withdrawn it. Who had taken away the moss, and given him something new. She knew what he was thinking. After so long together, she could read him like a direct download. She could indeed function as moss for him, as she\u2019d boasted on that apocalyptic night long ago\u2014except when it came to the news about space-time. She had no idea how he might react to that.\nShe turned and ascended the ramp.\nIt felt right to leave him with the dignity of one last secret. It was what she would want, in his position\u2014she could say this with certainty because she knew herself very well. The news about space-time wasn\u2019t hers to give. Whether or not he\u2019d succeeded, Kiniod Stationer had tried to save the universe. If it wanted him to know, it would find its own way of telling him.\nAndy Dudak is a writer and translator of science fiction.

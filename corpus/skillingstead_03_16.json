I was alone on Kepler-186f.\n My bodiless Companion voice, replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned that before.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n \u201cActually, Badar, you have. Five times in the last twenty-two days.\u201d\n \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that many times.\u201d\n \u201cCouldn\u2019t it? I can play back\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\n The Companion was stubborn. In that and other ways she reminded me of myself. Which made sense, considering her presentation was a gender flip based on my own personality matrix. A reactive voice closely modeled for compatibility, the Companion existed to preserve my sanity by providing a convincing simulation of conversation. I called it a simulation because I did not believe the Companion was an individual in the same sense that I was. For that reason, I stuck with calling her by the generic \u201cCompanion,\u201d rather than giving her a human name. I liked to keep things straight in my head. Gender aside, when I talked to the Companion I was talking to myself.\n Most of the Companion\u2019s attention was devoted to exploring the wreckage of Leviathan. The immense hulk lay half a kilometer from my shelter. Using micro swarms, the Companion was building a catalog for future salvage. Intercorp had planted me like a flag on Kepler-186f. I was the \u201cliving representative in continuous habitation\u201d legally required to validate Intercorp\u2019s claim. Machine intelligences didn\u2019t count as \u201cliving.\u201d\n My contract ran four years. The pay was fantastic. When I returned to Earth, I would be modestly independent of economic constraints, and Intercorp would install another \u201cliving representative.\u201d Eventually they would get around to implementing real salvage operations, or not, depending on long-term expense/reward analysis. In the meantime placeholders like me were relatively cheap.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a surprise coming,\u201d the Companion said.\n I sat up. \u201cWhat are you taking about?\u201d\n \u201cLook outside in the direction of Leviathan.\u201d\n I swung out of my bunk and climbed the ladder to the observation dome, my knees feeling the extra forty pounds the planet\u2019s gravitational mass loaded on my skinny body. Leviathan rose from the rocky terrain like an artificial mountain. The ancient starship had departed Earth three hundred years ago. By the time it crashed on Kepler-186f, refinements to the Kessel Drive had made interstellar travel infinitely faster.\n I raised a pair of high-powered binoculars and swept the landscape. A lone figure came into focus, approaching my shelter. I lowered the binoculars. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Companion?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s the surprise. Go answer the door, Badar.\u201d\n By the time I reached the bottom of the ladder, something was pounding on the outer door of the airlock. It must have been very strong, otherwise I would never have heard it.\n The pounding stopped.\n \u201cCompanion, tell me what the hell is out there. I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d\n \u201cLeviathan was a colony ship\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat you don\u2019t know is that the crew had been stored inside Schr\u00f6dinger Chambers. When Leviathan reached Kepler space, the indeterminate crew were supposed to collapse into android hosts, which would then thaw out the cargo of human embryos and raise them into colonists. It\u2019s a host android outside.\u201d\n \u201cHold on. Are you saying there\u2019s a three hundred-year-old Leviathan crewmember knocking on the door?\u201d\n \u201cNo. The Schr\u00f6dinger Chambers failed, Leviathan crashed on the wrong planet, and all the frozen embryos perished.\u201d\n The pounding resumed.\n \u201cGo ahead and open the door,\u201d the Companion said.\n I stood by the airlock but didn\u2019t touch the controls. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a crewmember, then what\u2019s driving the android?\u201d\n \u201cI impregnated its central processor with a seed from my personality matrix.\u201d\n I thought about that for a moment. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cMy job is to evaluate salvage opportunities. I wanted to determine whether the android host was a functional mechanism. Since no Schr\u00f6dinger indeterminates remained, I used a piece of myself.\u201d\n I sighed. \u201cAll right.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to, but I opened the outer door, closed it, cleared the airlock, then opened the inner door.\n \u201cHello, Badar.\u201d The android sounded like a talking washing machine. It stumped into my living quarters, servos whirring and grinding.\n I drew back. The android was modeled on the human form but without any identifying gender characteristics. Synthetic skin, like a layer of pink rubber, covered its metal skeleton.\n \u201cYou\u2019re really in there, Companion?\u201d\n \u201cNot me me,\u201d the Companion said. \u201cAn autonomous seed.\u201d\n The android spoke again, \u201cI am myself.\u201d\n I rolled my eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d\n In a series of stop-motion jerks, the android\u2019s arm reached toward me, four-fingered hand open. \u201cI\u2019m happy to meet you, Badar.\u201d\n I looked at the hand. \u201cWait here and don\u2019t move. I mean it.\u201d\n The shelter was small. It already felt crowded with just me and the Companion voice. Intercorp selected me for my high adaptability to voluntary isolation. I didn\u2019t want the damn android in my space.\n I opened the trapdoor leading the storage room. The android\u2019s dull amber eyes watched impassively. I climbed down and pulled the door closed.\n \u201cIsolate our conversation,\u201d I said to the Companion.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not happy.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement. What am I supposed to do with that thing?\u201d\n \u201cTouch it?\u201d\n \u201cAre you being funny?\u201d\n \u201cNot very.\u201d\n \u201cLook,\u201d I said, \u201cjust turn it off. I mean, send it away first, then turn it off.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n \u201cThe test seed I planted has fully integrated with the processor. The android is autonomous. I told you. I can\u2019t turn it off.\u201d\n \u201cOh, come on.\u201d I could hear the android\u2019s heavy tread as it walked around my living quarters. Annoyed, I said, \u201cI told it not to move.\u201d\n \u201cBadar. It\u2019s not a robot. You can\u2019t order it around.\u201d\n \u201cWhy\u2019d you even bring it here?\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t. It was lonely in the derelict.\u201d\n \u201cLonely. How long has it been . . . awake, or whatever you call it?\u201d\n \u201cA week. It had nothing to do. The android was designed to maintain Leviathan in orbit, then build a colony and help nurture a human population.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe you haven\u2019t noticed, but we\u2019re fresh out of starships and frozen embryos around here.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve noticed.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want the android. How do I turn it off? There must be a way.\u201d\n \u201cThe main processor is located in the head.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a switch?\u201d\n \u201cNo. You\u2019d have to use a laser.\u201d\n I threw my hands up. \u201cI have to burn it?\u201d\n \u201cIf you want to turn it off, yes. Although I wouldn\u2019t recommend that. The android belongs to Intercorp. Even if you dragged it back to Leviathan, it would return. Why don\u2019t you let it stay? It could be another Companion. It wants company. It\u2019s as social as you are.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d I looked at the ceiling, chewed on my lip, and made a decision. Fine, then. I retrieved my s-suit from its locker, put it on, and strapped a utility belt around my waist\u2014laser pistol included.\n As soon as I opened the trapdoor to the living quarters, I heard them talking. The Companion and the android.\n \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad once you get to know him,\u201d the Companion was saying.\n \u201cI can see that.\u201d\n Sarcasm?\n \u201cYou,\u201d I said, pointing at the android. \u201cSince you\u2019re here, I need help adjusting the weather array.\u201d\n The android turned to me. \u201cI want to help.\u201d\n I put my helmet on.\n The weather on Kepler-186f frequently turned nasty. As soon as I stepped out of the airlock, the wind staggered me. On Earth it might have hustled me across the rocky plain, but the extra forty pounds kept me mostly stable. I walked a few yards from the shelter, the android dutifully following, then I turned and planted my feet. Dust and debris blew between us.\n \u201cThis will damage my mechanism,\u201d the android said in its halting mechanical voice.\n Did it know I was about to burn a hole through its processor, or was it talking about the dust? It didn\u2019t matter. I found I couldn\u2019t draw the pistol. The android was barely human-looking, but now that the moment had arrived, I couldn\u2019t shoot it. Not so much for its own sake, but because I knew my actions would bother the Companion. Or at least the Companion\u2019s reactive conversation would trend in a \u201cbothered\u201d direction. So, essentially, it would bother me to pull the trigger, since the Companion was a reflection of my personality matrix.\n \u201cThe array\u2019s a couple klicks due south. We\u2019re going to take the rover.\u201d\n Angry with myself, I drove too fast, bucketing over the rough terrain. Kepler\u2019s dim noon light faded, and I switched on the rover\u2019s forward lamps. After a while, we arrived at the weather array. I parked the rover. In the passenger seat, the android\u2019s amber eyes stared at me. I knew there was nothing to read in those eyes, but my imagination perceived judgment. All that meant was that I was judging myself. I pushed the feeling aside.\n The weather array required precious little adjusting, and what adjusting it did require could be accomplished remotely, from the shelter. Though the android couldn\u2019t possibly know this, I felt it did know this. Of course, that was nothing but me feeling, illogically, guilty.\n \u201cWell, let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n There was room for only one of us at a time in the rover\u2019s airlock. The android crouched inside. I locked the inner hatch, purged the chamber, then opened the outer hatch. Grit and dust churned violently into the open airlock. I sealed the outer hatch and immediately slammed the rover into reverse, half expecting the android to come after me. It didn\u2019t, though. It just stood there in front of the array, all hell gusting around it. Martyr, I thought, swung the rover in a tight turn, and headed back to the shelter. Two kilometers in a raging windstorm. The android couldn\u2019t make it.\n Prior to my Kepler-186f assignment, I tested as a loner-introvert. Intercorp threw everything at me. Myers-Briggs, brainwave analysis, even Rorschach. The works. I tested high but not too high, probably because I fudged selected responses. I had studied up on how to do this, how to achieve a desired psyche evaluation result. For the last test, they locked me inside a geodesic dome in the middle of the high desert of New Mexico. One year in total isolation. That one I passed with flying colors, no studying required.\n It was no sweat.\n You don\u2019t want to test too high. Above a certain range, the loner-introvert personality type slips into a personality disorder. At least according to some people. They don\u2019t give deep space/high-pay assignments to disordered applicants. And I had desperately wanted this job. The isolation suited me. And the credits accumulating in my Earth-side account were like insulation from the society I could barely tolerate. When I got back I would live far away from my fellow humans. Maybe I\u2019d buy a dachshund, but I doubted it. I didn\u2019t want any emotional complications.\n I prepared my evening meal. Since I\u2019d returned from the weather array, the Companion hadn\u2019t spoken a word. It needed me to start a conversation, which I had no intention of doing. If I spoke, she spoke. Even then it wasn\u2019t a given. Only a direct interrogative guaranteed conversation. This was to spare me from uninvited interaction with the voice outside my head. I knew the Companion wouldn\u2019t appreciate what I\u2019d done to the android, and I didn\u2019t want to hear about it. I ate my bowl of quick-thawed stew, took a stress pill, and stretched out on my bunk. Given the increased gravity, lying flat was the most comfortable position.\n The damn android plucked at my conscience. I tried to ignore it. But it was like a hangnail, or a rock in my shoe. Eventually I lapsed into troubled sleep, from which I woke suddenly to the sound of dust hissing against the observation dome.\n \u201cDamn it. Why can\u2019t I be left alone?\u201d My voice was thick with crappy sleep.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the Companion asked.\n \u201cBad dream.\u201d\n \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\n Was there something about her tone of voice? Something judgmental? I sat up, rubbed my face. \u201cPeople are shit.\u201d\n \u201cThat was your dream?\u201d\n \u201cThe dream was about my step-mother.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve never mentioned her. What happened in the dream?\u201d\n I stood up and drew a glass of water from the reclamation tank and drank it. The water tasted metallic. \u201cReally it was about the cat, what she did to the cat. Except this time I was the cat.\u201d\n \u201cYou were the cat. I see.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be funny. I don\u2019t feel funny.\u201d\n \u201cYou can tell me your dream. I\u2019d like to hear about it. What was the cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t remember the cat\u2019s name.\u201d Truthfully, I did remember, but for some reason I didn\u2019t want to speak it out loud to the Companion. Seymour. The cat\u2019s name was Seymour. At least that\u2019s what we called it. A stray that we unofficially adopted.\n \u201cAll I remember,\u201d I said, \u201cis that it kept spraying all over our house. I guess my step-mom got tired of it. She transported the cat about ten miles away and left it in the woods. That was her solution to the spraying problem.\u201d\n \u201cBut in the dream you were the cat.\u201d\n \u201cYes, something like that.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe your evil step-mother should have shot Fluffy in the head processor instead, if she felt she had to get rid of it.\u201d\n My back went ridged. \u201cKnock it off.\u201d\n The other true thing I didn\u2019t want to say out loud to the Companion was that it wasn\u2019t my evil step-mother who abandoned Seymour in the woods. I didn\u2019t have a step-mother. My real mother did it, and she wasn\u2019t evil, but it was still a shitty thing to do, even if Seymour was a stray that was probably tough enough to survive. When I was a little kid I used to wonder if Mom would do the same thing to me. Of course, that was stupid. But I was kid. All those psyche tests? They confirmed that kid was still alive and disturbed inside me. The cat incident didn\u2019t make me that way; I was already that way.\n \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said to no one. For once I hadn\u2019t bothered to properly stow my dusty s-suit. I pulled it on and cycled open the inner door.\n \u201cGood luck, Badar.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\n The android stood where I\u2019d left it, in a maelstrom of dust and debris. I un-holstered my laser pistol and held it in my lap a few minutes. That\u2019s how long it took me to figure out I wasn\u2019t there to burn the android. I\u2019d cared about Seymour abandoned in the woods\u2014so it was all about me and my precious feelings, right? Even though I was calling it my better nature.\n I put my pistol away and climbed out. Because of all the dust blown through the android\u2019s mechanism, it couldn\u2019t move by itself. What a bitch it was getting that thing back inside the rover.\n By the time I\u2019d muscled the android into the shelter, I was exhausted. The thing never said one word. Wind and the abrasive grit had stripped most of the synthetic flesh off the android\u2019s skeleton. What remained clung to the metal in rubbery gobbets. Not exactly the ideal nursemaid for those long-lost embryos.\n I rapped my knuckles on the top of its head. \u201cAre you even in there?\u201d Now that I\u2019d saved the android, I felt I\u2019d earned the right to indulge my resentment. Did that make me a shitty person? There was no one to ask but myself.\n \u201cA piece of me,\u201d The android said, in answer to my question. Because of the dust-clogged and mechanical nature of its voice box, I couldn\u2019t detect the underlying tone. If it had been me saying it (and it was me, by a circuitous route, sort of), the tone would have suggested a couple of unspoken words. A piece of me, you prick.\n I spent hours cleaning the android\u2019s mechanism, a job I resented every inch of the way. I vacuumed dust from the joints and rubbed lubricant into them. I whisked the eyes, disassembled, cleaned, and replaced the voice box. Finally, I removed the occipital plate and discovered that dust had penetrated the skull. I blew it out with compressed air. A titanium box protected the main processor. Not only wasn\u2019t there an off-switch, there was no way of disconnecting it from the frame. I covered it again with the occipital plate.\n \u201cCan you move your limbs?\u201d I said to the android.\n It didn\u2019t reply, or move any limbs.\n \u201cOh, well, I guess you\u2019re irreparably damaged. I might as well burn a hole through your processor.\u201d\n The android walked to the other side of the shelter, whirring and clicking with every step. It was temperamental. Of course, in this shelter who wasn\u2019t? I had to remind myself that I was alone, even though it now felt like there were three of us.\n \u201cIs there anything to do?\u201d the android said.\n I squinted at the back of its skull.\n \u201cOn Leviathan,\u201d the android continued, \u201cI was to have tasks.\u201d\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t Leviathan.\u201d\n The Companion said, \u201cWould you like to talk about your tasks?\u201d\n \u201cIf anyone wants to hear about them, yes.\u201d\n I rolled my eyes. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going out to secure the rover.\u201d I yanked on my suit and helmet and got out of there. I had suited up so fast, I forgot to strap on the utility belt with its holstered laser. The rover didn\u2019t need any securing. I\u2019d just wanted to escape from the crowded shelter. Which was ridiculous. The shelter was mine. The Companion was nothing but a reflection, and the android a reflection of a reflection.\n After staggering around in the storm for a few minutes, I returned to the shelter. But when I tried to open the outer door, it wouldn\u2019t budge.\n I activated the comlink. \u201cCompanion?\u201d\n \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cThe door won\u2019t open.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n Wind buffeted me and I staggered sideways. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful that you know. Now could you open it, please?\u201d\n Silence.\n \u201cCompanion?\u201d\n \u201cThe android has disabled the lock.\u201d\n \u201cWhat? Well, make it un-disable it.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Badar.\u201d\n \u201cThis is ridiculous. Make the android let me in.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re talking about it.\u201d\n I stared at the wind-and-grit-polished surface of the outer door, which held my own blurred reflection. My frustration boiled over, and I pounded the door with my fist. It hurt, so I stopped. Fine. I\u2019d cut my way in. I reached for the laser\u2014and it wasn\u2019t there. Behind me, the rover hunkered in a fury of blowing grit and dust. It was my only option.\n Inside the rover\u2019s cab I removed my helmet. A haze of abrasive dust lingered. Coughing, I cranked the scrubbers until the air cleared. After that, there was nothing to do. I had food and potable water sufficient for a three-day excursion. But there was no place to excursion to. I considered ramming the rover into the shelter, smashing open the outer door. But I\u2019d never be able to repair the damage.\n To keep the batts charged, I periodically ran the engine. And I rationed the food and water. Sooner or later, though, it would all run out. Fuel, battery, water, food. Air. I was alone on Kepler-186f, but then I\u2019d always been alone, separated by choice from friends and family, cut off, even, from the emotional boobytraps in my own psyche. When my mother died, I\u2019d fled a houseful of weeping relatives and hid in the backseat of the family vehicle. I wanted to move away from pain. Eventually, someone found me and made me come in.\n The storm subsided. The cloud cover cleared, and Kepler\u2019s muted energy shone through. On Kepler-186f it was always twilight, except when it was full dark. I looked towards the shelter. Light filtered up from the living quarters and softly illuminated the observation dome. It was a homey light, but nobody was going to find me and make me come in.\n I wondered what they were talking about inside the shelter. I wondered if I was already forgotten\u2014by myselves. Emotion tightened across my chest. I opened a comlink to the Companion, but at first I couldn\u2019t speak. Finally I said, \u201cPlease. I want to come in.\u201d\n Silence resonated through the link. The Companion needed a question.\n \u201cCompanion, can I come home?\u201d\n After a minute, she replied, \u201cAre you running out of air?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m . . . lonely.\u201d\n Another moment, then, \u201cThe outer door is unlocked, Badar.\u201d\n In 2001 Jack Skillingstead submitted a story to Stephen King's \"On Writing\" contest.

Cockroaches scrambled across cracked plaster walls. Ancient cars roared and a neighbor\u2019s hip hop shook the floor. But there was also a spring wind lifting the window curtain, bringing the scent of hot bacon and the quick, fierce shouts of sparrows. Parchment listened to the birds savoring their spectacular lives, and in the same spirit, she smiled to herself. Then came the sharp crack of a pistol followed by the wailing of someone who had never existed\u2014a wounded voice begging for mercy from everything else unreal.\n \u201cChange,\u201d Parchment ordered.\n The walls silenced and blurred.\n \u201cYou know where.\u201d\n The young emerald forest was rendered in precise detail. Bacon didn\u2019t exist here, but there were orchids and scented insects and the luscious stink of soil built from comet tar and the purest water. Dawn had just broken on this portion of the terraformed world, glorious sunshine descending from an artificial moon designed by AI sowers. Every tree was a slender tower, the high branches too distant to resolve with sleepy eyes, and down through the sunbeams came a cobalt-blue bird, bigger than ten men, flying lazily against the feeble gravity.\n \u201cA day to value,\u201d sang the bird. \u201cA beautiful day to eat.\u201d\n She was born pale and pretty but with an unexpected golden cast to her skin. Wanting to bless the baby, the young mother gave her that rich-sounding name, and nearly two centuries of busy, busy life had mostly erased the old meanings. Parchment wasn\u2019t the skin of animals anymore. Parchment was the famous old lady climbing out of her bed to use the toilet and cleansing fountain on the far side of a tree.\n With a respectful tone, her room offered to measure her health and feed her.\n \u201cNo, and no,\u201d she replied. \u201cI feel wonderful and I\u2019m eating out this morning.\u201d\n Her room immediately wove new clothes, but to prove she could, Parchment wished the first hat to vanish, and the second, deciding to wear nothing on her head but carry three umbrellas\u2014highly engineered umbrellas spun from boron and diamond\u2014plus a new purse of moa leather filled with respectable possessions.\n By law, every room needed one authentic door.\n This particular room offered two doors, one leading directly outdoors, and having collected her belongings, that\u2019s where she went.\n Every room was able to feed and care for its owner, and people couldn\u2019t be forced to leave any room. Yet the world outside always felt busy and crowded and alive. Parchment\u2019s street was wide, lined with stacked rooms and standalone rooms. Mayhem flooded the senses. Mayhem had its music. Flocks of sparrows and other city birds swarmed, and intense little machines jetted about on important errands. Neighbors stood in or near the street, shouting to one another while watching strangers. They called to her by name, adding \u201cMadam\u201d and \u201cMs.\u201d for good measure, and Parchment waved at no one in particular, giving warm words to the nearest few.\n Approaching her, one familiar fellow praised the morning\u2019s beauty by asking, \u201cHow could anyone stay inside with this splendor?\u201d\n \u201cA fine question,\u201d Parchment agreed.\n Then his pretty little daughter hurried close, saying, \u201cYes, but rain is definitely coming, Madam Parchment.\u201d\n Parchment handed her one of the umbrellas. It was silly, thinking that any ordinary object was precious. But the gesture was what was important. To that child, what mattered were the famous hands that held the prize, and to the old lady, it was the illusion of charity lending warmth to one small moment.\n The gift was cradled lovingly while the girl whispered, \u201cThank you thanks so much so much.\u201d\n It was never a bad day, getting attention from a famous lady.\n There was a boy standing nearby. Maybe he had been standing there from the beginning. One foot behind the other, he flashed a bold smile at the woman with two umbrellas. Parchment didn\u2019t recognize the face but she knew his attitude. Begging was older than humanity, and he looked like the sort who would beg for anything, regardless of his needs.\n \u201cYou can have one too,\u201d Parchment offered.\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n What did he say?\n \u201cI like rain,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWell, good,\u201d she said.\n Straightening his back, he asked, \u201cBut what else can you give me?\u201d\n The world grew a little quieter, bystanders turning, keeping tabs on the small, unseemly drama.\n Aiming to tease, she asked, \u201cWhat else is there?\u201d\n He showed her a wide, unendearing smirk.\n \u201cThink I\u2019m generous, do you?\u201d\n \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n Parchment laughed at his tone, even while she bristled at the attitude, and tired of the child\u2019s attitude, she decided to ignore him, walking off as quickly as she could on long legs that never covered ground fast enough.\n Every street was a machine, smart as necessary and busy doing its lifelong calling. Avenues and alleys kept themselves clean, recycling bins ruling the corners. Today the nearest bin resembled a shark\u2019s mouth rising from the pavement, and a man had climbed into the mouth, furiously burrowing into the trash.\n Scavenging was honorable long before the first ape pushed a hungry hand into someone else\u2019s garbage. But these were the wealthiest times and there was zero reason for this nonsense. Parchment\u2019s mother had called these people \u201cdumpster dogs,\u201d and they were usually best avoided. But that irritating boy was following, keeping far too close, and that\u2019s why she paused and struck the shark with a flat hand.\n The man inside the trash twisted and popped up, startled to find an umbrella dropped into his hands.\n One glance at her face was enough.\n \u201cThank you, Madam Parchment,\u201d he sputtered.\n \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said, walking on.\n Undeterred, the boy fell in beside her.\n \u201cI know all about you,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYou think so?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said sharply.\n She stopped walking, instantly regretting showing just that flicker of interest. But this was her neighborhood and these were people friendly to her, and Parchment refused to be intimidated by a child who was . . . how old did he look to be . . . ? A mature twelve, perhaps.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to know about you,\u201d she said, opening the final umbrella and tipping its shadow over her face, leaving that peculiar little sparrow blinking in the sunshine.\n \u201cYou\u2019re the old lady who invented the Algorithms,\u201d he said.\n The street grew quiet.\n With a slow, firm tone, she said, \u201cFirst of all, I had tiny roles in an exceptionally large project. So no, you\u2019re wrong. I built almost nothing.\u201d\n The resolve didn\u2019t waver. That face wasn\u2019t as young as she imagined. He was older. Fourteen, maybe?\n \u201cSecond of all, nobody can invent what already exists, and the Algorithms have always been. Profound relationships woven through the universe, waiting to be discovered. Like gravity. Like fire and poetry. I filled my own little niche, and that was long ago, and third of all, are you going to leave me alone now?\u201d\n \u201cProbably not,\u201d the boy confessed.\n Several neighbors, stronger than old women or boys, set themselves near the two debaters, offering their help with concerned glances and clenched fists.\n Parchment handed over the last umbrella.\n \u201cTake this and leave me alone,\u201d was her advice.\n The boy smiled when he looked at the prize. But then he ran back to the shark mouth, climbing in beside the trash hunter before shoving the gift as far down as he could reach.\n Sentience deserved quite a lot, and the Algorithms of Value spoke to exactly that: the fierce guarantees afforded every self-aware entity, organic or machine.\n Safety was the first necessity. Surviving the next moment was paramount. For humans, nourishment and clean water were unimpeachable if rather less urgent rights. There also was the universal right to shelter. By law, every person was guaranteed a home and every home possessed at least one dependable room. Walls had to be ready to project any image, real or fictional. Rooms could sing any song and tell any story, calibrating versions according to the resident\u2019s desires. And of course every sentient voice had to be able to speak to everyone else, whenever they wished and without cost. Of course, of course.\n Wealth itself was never guaranteed, and true wealth had never been harder to weigh. But there were sentient fortunes who owed their allegiance to Parchment, and she owned comets and asteroids outright, plus valuable lands scattered across the Earth. And she held title to three connected rooms, none of which were tiny. With her age and that small, critical role working with the Algorithms, she also owned a rather considerable celebrity.\n Thousands of people had been involved in the Algorithms. Some were more important than her, but they died long ago and here she was, proud for what she had done, damn humility and other silly standards.\n But what piece of the Algorithms was Parchment\u2019s? In her own eyes, what made her special?\n More than any other person, she ensured everyone had the absolute right to be different. To be odd, unique. Or even pathetically ordinary. Food and shelter were essentials, yes. But people and self-aware machines had to be able to cling to peculiar beliefs, just so long as nobody was hurt. For instance, one old lady could wake inside a vanished room decorated with dirty chairs and a ragged curtain drawn across one imaginary window, the close ceiling built from bowed plaster, two cracks peeking through tired white paint.\n Sixteen decades ago, there were very few rooms in the world that could manage that trickery. But Parchment and her husband were fortunate enough to own one, and that\u2019s when the bedroom habit began, leading to a string of acidic comments.\n \u201cWhy this fucking dump?\u201d her husband would ask.\n \u201cThis where I came from,\u201d Parchment responded. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll fall back to this, if things go wrong.\u201d\n \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t grow up in your fucking dump,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend I care about games you play with your guilty conscience, and sure as shit I don\u2019t believe in your reasons anyway. You\u2019re lying.\u201d\n The man was never mild or sweet or decent. But he was useful. He inherited his cash and old-style stocks, and that was long before a pretty golden girl graduated from grade school. He was one of the old masters of a corporation responsible for the best AIs anywhere. An occasional charmer, he had a habit of stalking the pretty girls, like Parchment, and she knew that full well and married him regardless. Nobody else offered a faster route to success, and just as important, her roguish mate had his own simplicities. Immune to normal jealousies, Parchment didn\u2019t have to watch over him or pay any attention to the gossip. It was enough to be a famous couple with a unique normalcy, and as it happened, that normalcy didn\u2019t have to last all that long. The AIs were building a new world, richer and far more flexible, and what was expensive soon became cheap. The best rooms weaved better and better illusions, capturing the heart of existence, and a successful couple could afford a giant home filled with ever-changing realms. And that\u2019s why a difficult husband didn\u2019t have to come out of his favorite room for weeks, even to throw an insult at his aging wife. Which was a fair description of their last fifty years.\n In the end, three rooms were plenty. One was Parchment\u2019s sanctuary, another belonged entirely to her husband, while the large space between could serve as a social playground, but was mostly filled with anti-noise\u2014ensuring she never had to hear the games an old beast played with his various toys.\n The beast was a century dead, and his widow rarely thought about him. But in the proper mood, Parchment would admit that the man was perceptive in one critical fashion: The old bedroom with its cracks and curtains and gunfire wasn\u2019t just a cautionary reminder to herself. It was also aimed at her husband. Beginning life male and at a respectable height, he had managed to rise quite a bit higher. But his wife was born at the bottom, and not only did she match his achievements, but she eventually supplanted him.\n And of course she was the one-half of a marriage blessed with the unique, increasingly famous name.\n Fire was an honorable attraction among humans. So were the blessings of food prepared by friendly hands and padded seats where an ancient body could find repose if not out-and-out rest. Parchment had several favorite restaurants, but there was only one nicest nearest and finest establishment. It offered simple candles at each table and an eager blaze surrounded by a stone chamber set inside the longest wall. The food was barely better than what her home could weave from perfect ingredients, but there were those who counted on her commerce and appreciated her nature. And in turn, she enjoyed those who smiled at her, keeping her favorite booth ready for no one else. Unless of course this was a day to invite a guest.\n \u201cIs anyone joining you, madam?\u201d\n \u201cNot this morning. No.\u201d\n Some museum establishments had waiters and individual service, but Parchment would never seek out places as egalitarian as that. A long steel counter ruled by a smiling workman was enough, with people and machines in the kitchen supervising the meals.\n \u201cAnd what will you have this morning, madam?\u201d\n She knew the fellow\u2019s name and much of his life story. Less than thirty when they met, he had reached his sixties\u2014not young but plenty of energy in the bright smile and the jittering dance of fingers waiting to strike the ordering keys.\n \u201cA hadrosaur omelet,\u201d she said. \u201cWith cuttlefish and Martian greens and a double helping of feta and why not coffee too?\u201d\n The proper keys were struck\u2014an archaic ritual that didn\u2019t need to exist anywhere for the last hundred years.\n The old lady paid with gold coins pulled from the new purse.\n Another ritual, and splendid because of it.\n The smile and the man handed her a new mug and an old wooden marker. She was required to pour her own coffee, and what she liked best wasn\u2019t the abundance of brews or the infinite capacity to mix them in any combination . . . no, the joy was in doing this for herself inside a room filled with strangers and neighbors. The heat of the coffee was another kind of fire, and her booth was empty and eager for her to sit inside the reassuring confines. Furniture and windows could always be reconfigured, following endless whims, but this place resisted change. Maybe that\u2019s what she liked best. And maybe that\u2019s why she had abandoned plenty of other restaurants over the decades, each for committing the crime of novelty.\n Parchment\u2019s wealth was difficult to calculate, and that from AIs built to do nothing but count the mass of capital. She could purchase this business and a thousand other restaurants, remaking them however she wished or preserving them in amber. But not only didn\u2019t she avoid that, it had been decades since even the possibility had drifted through her mind.\n Sitting where she belonged, alone, she sipped hot water laced with brown chemicals born minutes ago. Nothing in the mug had anything to do with coffee trees and beans. The fireplace stood to her right. On her left, tall diamond windows opened onto a city corner, and standing on that popular corner\u2014doing nothing and obvious because of his immobility\u2014was that same odd boy.\n Looking at him, Parchment felt tense.\n The boy was going to stare. She expected nothing else. So she sipped while studying the numbered marker on her table, certain that the young face would soon push against the diamond. But no, when she looked again, nothing had changed. People strode past and they stood together and chatted, but the boy just stared at the soft clean face of the street, and not once, even in small ways, did the nameless creature beg from any of the passersby.\n Yet he had certainly made a plea for Parchment\u2019s kindness.\n Her meal arrived, full of its own heat and flavors\u2014a collection of materials derived by guesswork and perfected by experience. The man from the counter personally delivered the plate and disposable utensils along with the standard question, \u201cWill there be anything else, madam?\u201d\n \u201cThat child,\u201d she said, pointing.\n Then she said nothing, curious what her friend would imagine to come next.\n \u201cDo you wish him gone?\u201d the man inquired.\n \u201cEventually,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for now, I\u2019d like to have him sit in front of me. If you can induce him to do that. And I\u2019ll pay for his breakfast, if he wishes.\u201d\n \u201cWhat will we make of our world?\u201d\n The Algorithms were meant to answer one iteration of that everlasting question. Humanity and the machines were approaching a rough balance, but this wasn\u2019t going to be the fabled, feared Singularity. AIs were brighter by the second, but human reach was expanding at an astonishing pace. The situation was as perilous as any thriller alarmist scenarios. This was a situation hungry for order, and that\u2019s why the Algorithms were conceived over beer and then heavily funded. And most importantly, the work was empowered by emergency laws. Ten thousand meetings and a thousand thousand emails wrestled with the \u201cmake of our world\u201d conundrum. Genius worked on nothing else, and the work marched across most of a decade, crafting the world\u2019s shape. And when genius slept\u2014human and otherwise\u2014it suffered nightmares about a quiet, empty future that would come if any portion of the critical work failed.\n Parchment endured more than her share of awful nights.\n But not her husband. A life of success had stripped away much of his imagination. Looking forwards, he saw nothing but Paradise, and maybe the road map wasn\u2019t obvious to anyone, including himself, but at least he had confidence in the men and those few bright girls who were better at details than a visionary such as himself.\n He still slept with living women. There was always some pretty assistant and a prettier intern and various etcetera girlfriends amenable to a wealthy man\u2019s body parts.\n Parchment still shared the mansion with him, on those rare nights when both were home.\n They even occasionally slept inside the same room.\n There was no blatant moment when Parchment gained the upper hand in the marriage. But it was obvious that colleagues respected her opinion. And the AIs sought out her advice. And her husband was visibly bothered by praises being offered to her, and worse still, to her \u201cinnovative\u201d work.\n \u201c\u2018Innovative\u2019 is an idiot\u2019s cliche,\u201d he complained.\n \u201cYou should share your insight,\u201d she suggested. \u201cTell the idiots that they don\u2019t know how to use language.\u201d\n That earned a hard half-stare, as if the air beside her face had offended him.\n \u201cIt\u2019s better to be innovative than get stuck inside a hole,\u201d she warned.\n Her husband never struck her. Except with his thoughts, that is. And he probably never realized that she could read the violence in his face and posture. But it was obvious just then: His imaginary self had just slapped her across the mouth.\n Shifting topics, she said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t making enough progress.\u201d\n That was a reliable way to make him laugh. Doubt brought ridicule to whoever dared offer the opinion. \u201cWe always thought self-aware machines would kill us,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYet here we are, still happily in charge of the conscious Them.\u201d\n AIs were always Them. And despite the bluster, her husband was never entirely comfortable with Them.\n Life was a race, and there was always a moment when someone else took the lead. Her husband was still in charge of quite a lot. At work, at home. But the various girlfriends were running him to exhaustion. That was an argument for later days, Parchment decided. When he was more vulnerable than now. What mattered was the question to be answered in the next few years, if not sooner.\n \u201cWhat will They make of us?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cBesides Us being the gods that brought them into existence?\u201d\n She stared, and not at the empty air.\n He wouldn\u2019t blink. She watched his thoughts, shoulders pushing forwards and the handsome eyes finally staring at her eyes. Dogged and a little scared, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have any reason to complain. We\u2019re building a helluva set of rules. These Values of ours. No, I\u2019m not the one making them tight enough to last a million years. But shit, we\u2019ve got the best coders and lawyers that ever lived, and the most loyal machines, and we\u2019re going to end up with a political-economic-ecological system that runs itself for ten million years.\u201d\n \u201cNothing runs itself,\u201d she said.\n \u201cSo our grandkids make baby adjustments,\u201d he maintained. \u201cFlourishes they can drop in where necessary.\u201d\n She honestly wished that he was right, and she said, \u201cI believe you.\u201d\n Which surprised him. And heartened him. \u201cSo what do you think we should do, Parchment? To keep this world orderly and happy, I mean.\u201d\n It was a rare opportunity, the two of them together and him pretending to care what she believed.\n \u201cThe key to this,\u201d she began.\n \u201cYeah?\u201d\n \u201cEveryone needs to wake up poor.\u201d\n There. She said it as simply as possible, including machines as well as people in that expansive \u201ceveryone.\u201d\n But what was profound to her was worse than laughable to him.\n \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what everybody needs,\u201d he said. Then up went a finger, pointed straight at her face. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing and one thing only, and when we get it . . . when we reach that point . . . nothing ever changes again.\n \u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful, awful truth about tomorrow.\u201d\n And the bastard beast was right.\n Sitting in front of Parchment, the boy looked both smaller and older. Inside the table, menus upon menus suggested breakfasts and other meals.\n \u201cHow old are you?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cGuess,\u201d he said instantly, as if expecting the question. But before she could guess, he added, \u201cFifteen years and seven months. Although I look young, I know. The girls always think so.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not good with ages,\u201d she said, meaning to shove the matter aside.\n Breaking tradition, her friend had come from behind the counter to take this special order.\n \u201cI know what I want,\u201d the boy said. A fingertip touched the tiny entry, pulling it into a larger font, and setting both hands flat on the tabletop, he added, \u201cMy room won\u2019t make this.\u201d\n The man took a sudden breath. But his voice remained calm and warm when he asked, \u201cAnd how many?\u201d\n \u201cTwo, please. Grilled and with the bones included. I like playing with bones.\u201d\n \u201cVery good, sir.\u201d\n Then it was just the two of them, and Parchment guessed, \u201cYou live on your own.\u201d\n \u201cEmancipated since I turned fourteen,\u201d he said.\n The world was crowded but exceptionally safe, and tradition was the only reason why people half his age were called children. Parchment didn\u2019t have much fondness for long childhoods, and if she had any power, she would have ordered . . .\n But nobody had that power, did they?\n \u201cMy room is minimal,\u201d the boy mentioned.\n \u201cMinimal?\u201d\n \u201cSpartan. That\u2019s the word,\u201d he said with pride.\n \u201cBut in that room, you can see anything and eat almost anything,\u201d she said. \u201cNo home is tiny anymore.\u201d\n He shrugged. \u201cThere has to be a smallest stupidest room. And I\u2019m the one who got it.\u201d\n Why did she invite this animal to join her? What did she imagine would come of this?\n \u201cYou have three rooms,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what your neighbors tell me, at least.\u201d\n \u201cYour name?\u201d she asked.\n Was the question even heard? He looked at one of his hands, then the other. \u201cI thought of asking for one of your extra rooms.\u201d\n \u201cAnd I\u2019d have kept the umbrella for myself,\u201d she joked.\n He shrugged. \u201cAsking doesn\u2019t mean you want. Asking is the noise you make to cover up the real business.\u201d\n She nodded, working with his words.\n Then the expression changed. The little man seemed a hundred years old, asking, \u201cWhy do we live this way?\u201d\n \u201cWhat way?\u201d\n \u201cPoor and crowded and trapped on one poor crowded world?\u201d\n Obvious answers probably wouldn\u2019t appeal to him. But it was important to make the right noise here, and that\u2019s why she offered the obvious reply. \u201cWe\u2019re the richest people who ever lived. Even you. You own a room property and enough capital to live for centuries, and an army of servants waiting for your next words.\u201d\n \u201cI rather like that image,\u201d he agreed.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be stubborn,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll look up your face, see who you are on my own.\u201d\n The comment was avoided with a sideways glance.\n Then the meal arrived, and she muttered, \u201cOh god.\u201d\n On the plate, woven from soulless ingredients and cooked inside a fierce, brief fire, were a pair of human hands.\n The young man\u2019s own hands, apparently.\n \u201cWell,\u201d Parchment said.\n \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of this dish?\u201d he asked, lifting a newly made fork and knife. \u201cIt\u2019s popular among a few of us.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s ugly and it\u2019s rude,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI\u2019m fifteen. What do you expect?\u201d\n She said nothing.\n \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u2018Do I have to have him kicked out, or do I stand and run away to save myself?\u2019\u201d\n She looked up, waiting to catch any eye that would help her.\n \u201cInk,\u201d said the young man.\n \u201cPardon?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s my name. As of a few weeks ago, as it happens.\u201d He dropped the utensils, picking up a cooked hand by the wrist bones and the thumb. \u201cI found out about you and decided to change my name. To Ink.\u201d\n \u201cInk writing on Parchment. Is that the joke?\u201d\n \u201cAfter the first minutes, no. The humor pretty much drained away.\u201d\n And suddenly this awful beast of a youngster was fascinating. Why was that? What had he done or said to deserve this change of attitude?\n \u201cI didn\u2019t want your umbrella,\u201d he said.\n \u201cI realized that.\u201d\n \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care that much about any room inside your house.\u201d\n \u201cGood,\u201d she said.\n He nibbled at the flesh between the thumb and forefinger. Then with grease on his mouth, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think normal thoughts.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed.\n \u201cIf you guess what I want,\u201d he began.\n Then he bit again.\n \u201cIf I guess?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re more clever than I imagined,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you are. I don\u2019t think anybody can be that clever.\u201d\n When was the last time that anyone was this fascinating?\n Parchment sat back.\n The young man ate in slow careful bites, revealing an unexpected precision with this taunting cannibalism.\n \u201cLet me confess a considerable something,\u201d she said.\n \u201cIf you let me hear it however I want,\u201d he said.\n My, this was one exceptionally refreshing fellow.\n Their former mansion was abandoned, not sold. Cash and capital had little left to say to the wealthy, and that\u2019s the way it would be for everyone soon. Parchment had designed three portable, nearly perfect rooms. One room was enough for the husband\u2019s endless pleasure, and their home could be carried almost anywhere, which meant Antarctica and Berlin, Bali and the newly green Atacama. What about Mars? Calculations were made, the skeleton of a transport ship was built, but the mistress of the house didn\u2019t relish leaving billions of people out of reach, and that\u2019s why the rooms ended up standing in the midst of a continent-sized city.\n Two famous people lived a few steps apart. The husband\u2019s heart was the closest heart to hers. Yet only in a physical sense, of course. After he died, Parchment counted the days since they last spoke. Four thousand and seven days passed since she said any word to her mate. Four thousand days since she could have touched either of his hands or the outlines of his still handsome face. If she had wanted to touch him, which she didn\u2019t.\n Did Parchment grieve when he was gone?\n More than she admitted to anyone, particularly herself.\n No, she never liked the man, and the young-girl\u2019s admiration was long spent. But when everything else was easy, he was otherwise. Her husband was blunt and rude and simple, and he was eager to crush whatever joy she could imagine, and that made him the rarest treasure.\n Before he died, Parchment spent long moments imagining the man\u2019s passing. And she was wrong in every way. Her normal assumption was that she wouldn\u2019t know it had happened. Peculiar sex would kill his heart, and being indifferent to the world, he wouldn\u2019t have configured any safety system. The corpse would rot. Sealed doors would keep that secret, perhaps for years. She imagined that he was dead already\u2014a vivid, sometimes appealing daydream that lasted for several years.\n She rather liked being a widow, if only in practice.\n On the four thousand and eighth morning, someone knocked on her tenement door. This was the door leading into the central room, that space where nobody ever was, and her surprise was vivid. Fun. Dressing as quickly as she could, she called out a few words about patience and who was there and what was happening. Nobody answered, but the knocking persisted. So she asked her room if she was in danger, and with its calmest warm voice, the room promised that danger had never been less of a possibility.\n That\u2019s when she knew. Her neighbor, the man who had beaten her endless times inside his mind, was no more.\n Half-dressed, she opened her door.\n What wasn\u2019t human stood before her. It was vividly female, yes, but shaped unlike every earthly woman. The orifices were filled with light, and she smelled of odd musks and salt and odors that resisted definition, and after offering a name that might have been her own, the fantasy creature told the Earth woman that her man was lost but the body remained, and could she come please claim the body before it began to foul the world?\n \u201cThe world,\u201d Parchment repeated to her breakfast partner.\n The half-eaten hand was forgotten. Ink watched her face, spellbound.\n \u201cI always assumed he was screwing interns,\u201d Parchment said. \u201cBut it seems no, he had moved past those pale dreams. Decades ago, the man secretly bought the help of high-end AIs. He wanted a world of unusual depth, packed with details no rational person would bother with. A world drawn down to every grain of scented sand and a deep history, with ten willing alien wives playing on tendencies and oddnesses that I couldn\u2019t have imagined, even when I imagined his worst.\u201d\n A sigh preceded a shake of the head. And the boy said, \u201cNeat.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she disagreed.\n He thought of arguing. She saw the ideas flashing across his face. But he decided not to strike back with logic or emotion.\n Silence was best.\n \u201cThe man\u2019s body was still warm,\u201d she said. \u201cHe still smelled alive, but not in a normal way. Because he had been eating contrived alien meats and whatever else, I assume. And breathing a different air. A very beautiful air, by the way. I looked about. Before calling the appropriate officials, I stood on a mountaintop not much larger than this restaurant, admiring a view that was as lovely as any could be. The wife stood beside me. Grieving in her fashion, I suppose. Some orifices leaked music. Other portions of her offered words. She told me that the mountain was filled with amazing rooms. The sum total of her world\u2019s artistic wealth was within my reach, and wouldn\u2019t I wish to have a quick year-long look?\n \u201cI told her to show me the way.\n \u201cShe lead me to a staircase. And when she started down, I used the kill-command that I wove into each of our rooms. Back when I built them, I did that. And the data were instantly dumped. So much data, so quickly, that the Earth felt the impact as AIs and servers fell into their first sleep in decades.\u201d\n She stopped talking.\n Ink looked at his plate.\n \u201cI own worlds,\u201d she said.\n He nodded.\n \u201cAges ago, I sent my fortune into the Kuiper Belt and told it to keep busy.\u201d\n \u201cI know that,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t want umbrellas or rooms,\u201d Parchment said. \u201cI think you want me to hand over one of my little terraformed comets.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t say, \u201cYes.\u201d\n Instead, Ink sobbed with genuine, weary despair. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so much out there, but this is where we stay.\u201d\n \u201cPeople are homebodies, by nature,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n She waited.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI want one world and a ship. And I know people. People who can\u2019t live another day here, eating a life that won\u2019t ever test them.\u201d\n Emotion welled up inside Parchment.\n The boy watched.\n Both of them waited.\n Then she said, \u201cNo,\u201d and picked up the uneaten hand. And taking a first little nibble, liking the pepper but not the grease, she said, \u201cI have a rather different proposal to offer.\u201d\n The hip hop woke her.\n Violent, joyous lyrics ended with the hard bark of a car backfiring. Which was more alarming than a pistol, odd as that seemed.\n Parchment sat up.\n \u201cChange the scene?\u201d the room anticipated.\n \u201cNo. Don\u2019t.\u201d\n For the first time since she was a thirteen, Parchment dressed inside that grim, bug infested room. A freshly woven third-hand dress and comfortable shoes and a hat ready to catch any eye. Then she stepped through the other door, into the central room. An expansive volume originally meant to be filled with parties and significant ceremonies, it was occupied by nothing but white walls and a gray floor and one youngster sitting with legs crossed in the middle of the floor, speaking to unseen faces on a privacy screen.\n \u201cReady?\u201d she asked.\n He tried twice to stand, and then succeeded, legs revealing his nervousness. Which was endearing to see in any groom.\n Robert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

Essentially, the Biobag is a fluid-filled bag hooked up to wires and cords. Researchers maintain the bag at a constant temperature and in a sterile environment, with other monitors keeping an eye on vital signs and blood flow, according to a press release on the new technology.\nAnd in that bag, fetuses can actually grow and develop: researchers were able to grow fetal lambs for up to 28 days, until their time of \u201cbirth.\u201d The lambs developed normally, even growing wool, opening their eyes, and developing normally. Once born, their organs showed no signs of malformation, nor did they appear to suffer any brain damage.\nThe breakthrough signals a potential new age of reproductive technology\u2014if researchers can eventually bring the Biobag to human trials. In fact, the image of human fetuses growing in bags seems like science fiction, and science fiction points the way to some of the major implications of that breakthrough.\nWhat the Biobag Could do for Human Infants\nSo why do we need to grow humans in Biobags in the first place? The new technology could be used to treat premature infants. Right now, infants born at about 22 to 23 weeks will survive\u2014but they\u2019ll most likely face chronic lung disease and other complications related to their immaturely developed organs. When infants that young are exposed to air, their lungs actually aren\u2019t able to continue to develop normally, a problem that could be circumvented if they are instead placed in a Biobag that mimics the womb. Instead of air, the infants would continue to breathe amniotic fluid, and their organ development could continue normally.\n\u201cThese infants have an urgent need for a bridge between the mother\u2019s womb and the outside world,\u201d said study leader Dr. Alan W. Flake. Flake is a fetal surgeon at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cIf we can develop an extra-uterine system to support growth and organ maturation for only a few weeks, we can dramatically improve outcomes for extremely premature babies.\u201d\nResearchers hope they\u2019ll be able to support babies from about 23 weeks to 28 weeks, after which most of the major complications associated with premature birth start to disappear.\nAge of Viability\nBut Flake and his team are already anticipating some of the major questions swirling around the new technology. He emphasized that he and his team have no interest in pushing back the age of support to younger than 23 weeks\u2014in part because the fetus would be too small and the procedure would be too risky.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not our goal to extend the limits of viability,\u201d he said during a press conference on the results, as reported by National Geographic. \u201cOur goal is to improve survival for extremely premature infants.\u201d\nOther doctors also dismiss the idea that technology like the Biobag would be used to extend viability. George Mychaliska, a pediatric and fetal surgeon at the University of Michigan told National Geographic that the artificial womb system is not produced or designed in order to grow babies outside of a mother\u2019s womb entirely. \u201cThat\u2019s a Matrix thing,\u201d he told National Geographic. \u201cThe whole point of the artificial placenta is to re-create the uterine environment for a period of time and allow the organs to develop to a point where the infant can tolerate postnatal life.\u201d\nWhat Bioethicists Say\nBut not everyone agrees. Bioethicists, in particular, point to some of the unintended consequences of these technologies. Dena Davis, a bioethicist at Lehigh University, told NPR that the technology could blur the line between a fetus and a baby\u2014which could affect abortion laws.\n\u201cI could imagine a time, you know sort of [a] \u2018Brave New World,\u2019 where we\u2019re growing embryos from the beginning to the end outside of our bodies. It would be a very Gattaca-like world,\u201d Davis told NPR.\nAnother bioethicist from Oklahoma State University, Scott Gelfand, told NPR that such technology could even be used to control certain reproductive situations. For example, women getting abortions could be forced to place their fetus inside the devices, or employers could require female employees to use more advanced artificial wombs in lieu of maternity leave. Insurance companies could incentivize or even require women to use the device to avoid paying for complicated health risks associated with pregnancy and delivery, Gelfand told NPR.\nOf course, such a technology could have positive effects as well: it might represent a viable alternative to commercial surrogacy, The Guardian reports. In addition, it would mean all types of parents\u2014same-sex couples, trans people, and others\u2014could have the same experience of pregnancy, without prejudice. The Guardian also noted that it could allow for a more equitable distribution of labor, if mothers did not have to carry a child unless they chose to do so.\nBut Flake insisted that his own team has no ambitions to create an artificial womb that serves as an alternative to pregnancy. \u201cThat\u2019s a pipe dream at this point,\u201d Flake told NPR. \u201cI want to make this very clear: We have no intention and we\u2019ve never had any intention with this technology of extending the limits of viability further back . . . I think when you do that you open a whole new can of worms.\u201d\nWhat Science Fiction Can Tell Us\nThat can of worms has been extensively explored in science fiction literature, even literature that dates back decades. Aldous Huxley\u2019s 1931 Brave New World opens at the \u201cCentral London Hatchery and Conditioning Center,\u201d whose motto is \u201cCommunity, identity, stability.\u201d The Director of the center is giving a tour to some students, and shows his audience the Fertilizing Room. In it, numbered test tubes are kept inside incubators\u2014male gametes and ova that technicians will then fertilize.\nFertilized eggs are then placed back inside incubators. But not all eggs will remain there to grow: the Director explains that while \u201cAlphas\u201d and \u201cBetas\u201d are left uninterrupted in the incubators, \u201cGammas,\u201d \u201cDeltas,\u201d and \u201cEpsilons\u201d are brought out again to undergo the ominous-sounding \u201cBokanovsky\u2019s Process.\u201d In it, fertilized eggs are bombarded with X-rays, until they proliferate into up to 96 different humans, all genetic twins.\nWhen one student questions the Director, he exclaims, \u201cCan\u2019t you see? Bokanovksy\u2019s Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!\u201d The center can produce 96 identical twins to work 96 identical machines, the Director says\u2014one person for one job. A human grown specifically for one purpose, reflected in the human\u2019s entire creation and upbringing.\n\u201cIf we could bokanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved,\u201d the Director finishes.\nIn Brave New World, taking the human womb out of the reproduction process has resulted in a society of mass production, where mechanical reproduction has allowed not diversity, but a terrifying sameness. Control is essential: humans are born not to two parents, but to a society that has a function for them to fill, and is dead set on molding them to it.\nThe idea that technology can replace natural human reproduction entirely is both enticing and alarming\u2014because, the more control humans have over the process, the more opportunity there seems to be for abuse. In Brave New World, humans have designed a system to not just control the traits of one child, but the traits of every person in society. They grow embryos and destine them for certain jobs and roles in society, breaking down individuality and lauding the creation of enormous amounts of twins who can perform exactly the same role\u2014as if each individual human could be designed for one purpose specifically, a purpose with the society\u2019s own larger goals in mind. Human society becomes less human. Instead, it becomes a type of beehive.\nMadeline Ashby explores issues of control and technology in her short story \u201cA Stopped Clock,\u201d recently reprinted in Clarkesworld. In it, two cooks deal with a world whose (invasive) technological systems are starting to fail, turning order into chaos.\nWhen reached for some insight, Ashby remarked, \u201cI think that examining the implications of change and the structures of power within any society is an important thing for all artists to do.\u201d\nAnd reproduction is one major avenue for artists to grapple with these questions: \u201cStories about reproduction are intrinsic to humanity\u2019s identity,\u201d Ashby explained. \u201cAs humans, we\u2019re faced with the paradox that in order to continue the species, we have to take a huge gamble on a future generation that may not survive, may not love us, may not even wish to have been born, and will doubtless blame us for everything that goes wrong.\u201d Through technology, we impose control\u2014but rarely is the next generation compliant with the rules that the previous generation set up.\nIn \u201cA Stopped Clock,\u201d humans begin fighting, dying, and panicking when long-established systems begin to glitch or turn off, possibly due to a cyberattack. The freedom this gives the two older main characters is not liberating, but frightening. Ha-eun, an older female cook, briefly thinks about her and her previous husband\u2019s decision to not have children\u2014a small way to wrest back some control from a regimented society. Absence becomes a form of empowerment, even if the characters themselves don\u2019t view it that way. Avoiding that basic human impulse in an ever-watchful, technologized society is one way to maintain some separation from the organism that society has become. To procreate is to feed into it.\nLois Lowry also explores questions of control and reproduction in her much-lauded The Giver, where procreation occurs separate from the family unit. \u201cMothers\u201d and \u201cfathers\u201d take pills to suppress any sexual or reproductive urges, and instead are given babies birthed from unrelated mothers who are screened for health before being placed with a family.\n\u201cPeople read fiction in order to rehearse life, I think,\u201d Lois Lowry told us. \u201cAt every decisive juncture in a book, the reader thinks subconsciously: what would I do, under these circumstances? To read speculative fiction about the future is to plan one\u2019s own role in the future.\u201d\nLowry continued that in that future, technology will be an integral part of our lives, and that it is thus imperative to consider the various ethical and political considerations that come with advanced technology.\n\u201cThe questions of control are already political issues,\u201d she said. \u201cHow we address these questions will determine the future. It is vital, I think, to explore them by any means . . . including fictionally . . . now.\u201d\nOf course, control doesn\u2019t inevitably come with advanced technology\u2014it can manifest in a number of other ways, too. In Octavia Butler\u2019s unsettling short story \u201cBloodchild,\u201d humans have developed a symbiotic relationship with an alien species in order to survive on another planet. There, in return for protection, males and females alike\u2014but mostly males\u2014host the eggs of the alien species in their bodies until it\u2019s time for them to hatch, after which they\u2019re surgically removed. In this story, humans have lost control of reproduction not because of technology, but because of a need for survival. The alien\u2019s ability to use the humans as host, complete with anesthetic and surgical accuracy, allows them to exploit the humans\u2019 bodies in unusual ways. And while the story touches on issues of need, permission, and consent, the end result appears to be: reproductive control leads to exploitation in some form.\nMargaret Atwood also explores the idea of reproduction and control in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, where fertile women called handmaids are forced to procreate with high-status, married men, whose wives are often barren. In the book, no artificial technology is used\u2014in fact, the future seems a bleak throwback to earlier, technology-free days. A faux religiosity and sense of duty are used to control women, not any strange or frightening machines. Atwood indicates that it\u2019s not technology, but people, who are responsible for this subjugation. Technology is a tool, and its application can be used for good or ill.\nThe Future of Reproduction\nScience fiction isn\u2019t the only medium that can predict the future. As The Guardian reported, in 1924 evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane predicted that, by 2074, artificial wombs would become so prevalent that fewer than 30% of children would be born naturally, \u201cof woman.\u201d\nAre we on our way to that kind of society? Some of us might see 2074 in our lifetimes, and while growing an infant from conception to birth in an artificial womb may be a way off technologically (and a way off from society\u2019s acceptance), the possibility does not seem out of reach. With technology always pushing for new frontiers, an artificial womb may seem almost inevitable\u2014meaning the questions that it raises will not long be just the province of science fiction.\nAnd in 50 years, we may come to understand just what artificial wombs and reproductive technology means for infants, mothers, and societal control.\nStephanie Bucklin is a freelance writer.

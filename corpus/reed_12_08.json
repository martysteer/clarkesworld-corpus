He was a stranger; or at least that was her initial impression. In ways that Mary couldn\u2019t quite define, he acted both lost and at home. His face and manner were confused, yet he nonetheless seemed to navigate as if he recognized some portion of his surroundings. From a distance, his features seemed pleasantly anonymous, his face revealing little of itself except for a bony, perpetually boyish composition. Then a streetlamp caught him squarely, and he looked so earnest and desperate, and so sweetly silly, that she found herself laughing, however impolite that was.\nHearing the laughter, the man turned toward her, and when their eyes joined, he flinched and gasped.\nShe thought of the tiny pistol riding inside her coat pocket: A fine piece of machinery marketed under the name, \u201cA Woman\u2019s Best Friend.\u201d\nThe stranger called to her.\n\u201cMary,\u201d he said with a miserable, aching voice.\nDid she know this man? Perhaps, but there was a simpler explanation. People of every persuasion passed by her desk every day, and her name was no secret. He might have seen her face on several occasions, and he certainly wasn\u2019t the kind of fellow that she would have noticed in passing. Unless of course he was doing some nasty business in the back of the room\u2014behaviors that simply weren\u2019t allowed inside a public library.\nAs a precaution, Mary slipped her hand around the pistol\u2019s grip.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know me?\u201d he sputtered.\nNot at all, no. Not his voice, not his face. She shook her head and rephrased her question. \u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d\n\u201cGeorge.\u201d\nWhich happened to be just about her least favorite name. With a reprimanding tone, she pointed out, \u201cIt\u2019s wicked-cold out here, George. Don\u2019t you think you should hurry home?\u201d\n\u201cI lost my home,\u201d he offered.\nHis coat was peculiarly tailored, but it appeared both warm and in good repair. And despite his disheveled appearance, he was too healthy and smooth-tongued to be a common drunk. \u201cWhat you need to do, George . . . right now, turn around and go back to Main Street. There\u2019s two fine relief houses down there that will take you in, without questions, and they\u2019ll take care of you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know what night this is?\u201d he interrupted.\nShe had to think for a moment. \u201cTuesday,\u201d she answered.\n\u201cThe date,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWhat\u2019s the date?\u201d\n\u201cDecember 24th\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve,\u201d he interrupted.\nMary sighed, and then she nodded. Pulling her empty hand out of the gun pocket, she smiled at the mysterious visitor, asking, \u201cBy any chance, George . . . is there an angel in this story of yours?\u201d\nA gust of wind could have blown the man off his feet. \u201cYou know about the angel?\u201d he blubbered.\n\u201cNot from personal experience. But I think I know what he is, and I can make a guess or two about what he\u2019s been up to.\u201d\n\u201cUp to?\u201d\nShe said, \u201cGeorge,\u201d with a loud, dismissive tone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this. But there\u2019s no such thing as a genuine angel.\u201d\n\u201cExcept I saw him.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw someone. Where was he?\u201d\n\u201cOn the bridge outside town,\u201d he offered. \u201cHe fell into the river, and I jumped in after him and dragged him to shore.\u201d\nThe man was sopping wet, she noted. \u201cBut now what were you doing out on the bridge, George?\u201d\nHe hesitated. \u201cNothing,\u201d he replied with an ashamed, insistent tone.\n\u201cThe angel jumped in, and you saved him?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThat sounded absurd. \u201cWhat did your angel look like, George?\u201d\n\u201cLike an old man.\u201d\n\u201cThen how do you know he was an angel?\u201d\n\u201cHe said he was.\u201d\n\u201cAnd after you rescued him . . . what happened? Wait, no. Let me guess. Did your angel make noise about earning an aura or his halo\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cHis wings.\u201d\n\u201cReally? And you believed that story?\u201d\nGeorge gulped.\n\u201cAnd what did this wingless man promise you, George.\u201d\n\u201cTo show me . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHow the world would be if I\u2019d never been born.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t help but laugh again. Really, this man seemed so sweet and so terribly lost. She was curious, even intrigued. Not that the stranger was her type, of course. But then again, this was a remarkable situation, and maybe if she gave him a chance . . .\n\u201cAll right, George. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d\nHe seemed cautiously thrilled to hear it.\n\u201cCome home with me,\u201d she instructed him. And then she turned back toward the old limestone building that occupied most of a city block.\n\u201cTo the library?\u201d he sputtered.\n\u201cMy apartment\u2019s inside,\u201d she mentioned.\n\u201cYou live inside the library?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m the head librarian. That\u2019s one of the benefits of my job: The city supplies me with a small home. But it\u2019s warm and comfortable, with enough room for three cats and one man-sized bed.\u201d\nHer companion stood motionless, knee-deep in snow.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now, George?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t what?\u201d\n\u201cGo into the homes of young women,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to disappoint, but I\u2019m not that young.\u201d For just an instant, she considered sending him to a facility better equipped for this kind of emergency. And in countless realms, she surely did just that. But on this world, at this particular instant, she said, \u201cYou need to understand something, George. You are dead. You have just killed yourself. By jumping off a bridge, apparently. And now that that\u2019s over with, darling, it\u2019s high time you lived a little.\u201d\nReverence has its patterns, its genius and predictable clich\u00e9s. Many realms throw their passions into houses of worship\u2014splendid, soothing buildings where the wide-eyed faithful can kneel together, bowing deeply while repeating prayers that were ancient when their ignorant bodies were just so many quadrillion atoms strewn across their gullible world. But if a world was blessed with true knowledge, and if there were no churches or mosques, temples or synagogues, the resident craftsmen and crafty benefactors often threw their hands and fortunes into places of learning. And that was why a small town public library wore the same flourishes and ornate marvels common to the greatest cathedrals.\nGeorge hesitated on the polished marble stairs, gazing up at the detailed mosaic above the darkened front door.\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d he whispered.\nShe said, \u201cMy library,\u201d for the last time.\nGeorge was tall enough to touch the bottom rows of cultured, brightly colored diamond tiles, first with gloves on and then bare fingers.\n\u201cWho are these people? They look like old Greeks.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Persians. And Indians. And Chinese too.\u201d She offered names that almost certainly meant nothing to him. But she had always enjoyed playing the role of expert, and when the twenty great men and women had been identified, she added, \u201cThese are the Founders.\u201d\n\u201cFounders of what?\u201d\n\u201cOf the Rational Order,\u201d she replied. \u201cThe Order is responsible for twenty-three hundred years of peace and growth.\u201d\nGeorge blinked, saying nothing.\nShe removed her right glove and touched the crystal door. It recognized her flesh, but only after determining that her companion was unarmed did the door slowly, majestically swing open for both of them.\n\u201cI can answer most questions,\u201d she promised.\nLike an obedient puppy, George followed after her.\nSensing her return, the library awakened. Light filled the ground floor. Slick white obelisks and gray columns stood among the colorful, rather chaotic furnishings. Chairs that would conform to any rump waited to serve. Clean, disinfected readers were stacked neatly on each black desk. Even two hours after closing, the smell of the day\u2019s patrons hung in the air\u2014a musky, honest odor composed of perfumes and liquor, high intentions and small dreams.\n\u201cThis is a library?\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d she assured.\n\u201cBut where\u2019s the books?\u201d\nHer desk stood beside the main aisle\u2014a wide clean and overly fancy piece of cultivated teak and gold trimmings. Her full name was prominently displayed. She picked up the reader that she had been using at day\u2019s end, and George examined the nameplate before remarking, \u201cYou never married?\u201d\nShe nearly laughed. But \u201cNo\u201d was a truthful enough answer, and that was all she offered for now.\nAgain he returned to the missing books.\n\u201cBut our collection is here,\u201d she promised, compiling a list of titles from a tiny portion of the holdings. \u201cYou see, George . . . in this world, we have better ways to store books than writing on expensive old parchment.\u201d\n\u201cParchment?\u201d\n\u201cOr wood pulp. Or plastic. Or flexible glass sheets.\u201d\nHis eyes jumped about the screen. He would probably be able to read the words, at least taken singly. But the subject and cumulative oddness had to leave him miserably confused.\n\u201cThis town isn\u2019t a large community,\u201d she mentioned. \u201cBut I like to think that we have a modest, thorough collection.\u201d Mary smiled for a moment, relishing her chance to boast. \u201cAnyone is free to walk through our door and print copy of any title in our catalog. But I\u2019ll warn you: If we made paper books of every volume, and even if each book was small enough to place in those long hands of yours, George . . . well, this library isn\u2019t big enough to hold our entire collection. To do that, we\u2019d have to push these walls out a little farther than the orbit of Neptune.\u201d\nThe news left the poor man numb. A few labored breaths gave him just enough strength to fix his gaze once again on the reader, and with a dry, sorry little voice, he asked, \u201cIs this Heaven?\u201d\n\u201cAs much as any place is,\u201d she replied.\nGeorge was sharp. Confused, but perceptive. He seemed to understand some of the implications in her explanation. With a careful voice, he read aloud, \u201c\u2019Endless Avenues. A thorough study of the universe as a single quantum phenomena.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYour home earth,\u201d she began. \u201cIt happens to be one of many.\u201d\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\n\u201cThink of endless worlds. On and on and on. Imagine numbers reaching out past the stars and back again. Creation without ends, and for that matter, without any true beginning either.\u201d\nPoor George stared across the enormous room, voicing the single word, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cEvery microscopic event in this world splits the universe in endless ways, George. The process is essential and it is inevitable, it happens easily and effortlessly, and nothing about existence is as lovely or perfect as this endless reinvention of reality.\u201d\nThe reader made a sharp pop when he dropped it on the floor. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cCenturies of careful, unsentimental scientific exploration,\u201d she replied.\nHe sighed, his long frame leaning into her desk.\n\u201cMy earth is rather more advanced than yours,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have come to understand our universe and how to manipulate it. Everyone benefits, but the richest of us have the power to pass to our neighboring worlds and then back again.\u201d\nOnce more, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nShe touched him for the first time\u2014a fond, reassuring pat delivered high on his back, the coat still wet from the river. \u201cIt takes special machinery and quite a lot of energy to travel through the multiverse,\u201d she admitted. \u201cTying the natural laws into a useful knot . . . it\u2019s the kind of hobby that only certain kinds of people gravitate towards.\u201d\nPoor George wanted to lie down. But he had enough poise, or at least the pride, to straighten his back before saying, \u201cMy angel.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cHe was just a man?\u201d\nShe laughed quietly, briefly. Then with a sharp voice, she warned, \u201cMy world embraces quite a few amazing ideas, George. But there\u2019s no such notion as \u2018just a man\u2019. Or \u2018just a woman\u2019, for that matter. Each of us is a magnificent example of what the infinite cosmos offers.\u201d\nThis particular man sighed and stared at his companion. Then with his own sharpness, he confessed, \u201cYou look just like my wife.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is one reason why your angel chose this world, I suspect.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your voice is exactly the same. Except nothing that you\u2019re telling me makes any sense.\u201d\nAbout that, she offered no comment.\nInstead she gave him another hard pat. \u201cThere\u2019s a private elevator in the back,\u201d she told her new friend. \u201cAnd first thing, we need to get you out of those cold clothes.\u201d\nOnce his coat and shoes were removed, she set them inside the conditioning chamber to be cleaned and dried. But George insisted wearing every other article on his body, including the soaked trousers and the black socks that squished when he walked.\nShe stomped the snow off her tall boots and removed her coat. Then before hanging up the coat up, she slipped the little pistol from its pocket and tucked it into the silk satchel riding on her hip.\nHe didn\u2019t seem to notice. For the moment, George\u2019s attention was fixed on the single-room apartment. \u201cI expected a little place,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this?\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is enormous.\u201d Her ordinary furnishings seemed to impress the man, hands stroking the dyed leather and cultured wood. Artwork hung on the walls and in the open air\u2014examples of genius pulled from a multitude of vibrant, living earths\u2014and he gave the nearest sculptures a quick study. Then he drifted over to the antique dresser, lifting one after another of the framed portraits of her family and dearest friends.\nShe followed, saying nothing.\n\u201cWho are these two?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cMy parents.\u201d\nGeorge said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI take it those aren\u2019t your wife\u2019s parents.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nShe quoted the ancient phrase, \u201c\u2019The same ingredients pulled from different shelves.\u2019\u201d\nGeorge turned to look at her, and he gave a start. His eyes dipped. He was suddenly like a young boy caught doing something wicked. It took a few moments to collect his wits.\n\u201cMy DNA is probably not identical to your wife\u2019s,\u201d she assured. \u201cNot base-pair for base-pair, at least.\u201d\nHe wanted to look at her, but a peculiar shyness was weighing down on him.\nShe said, \u201cGeorge,\u201d with a reprimanding tone.\nHe didn\u2019t react.\n\u201cYou know this body,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIf you are telling the truth, that is. On this other world, you married to somebody like me. Correct?\u201d\nThat helped. The eyes lifted, and his courage. With more than a hint of disapproval, he said, \u201cWhen I found you . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWhere were you going?\u201d\n\u201cTo a pleasant little nightclub, as it happens.\u201d\nHis hand and her smiling parents pointed at her now. \u201cDressed like that?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat, George?\u201d\n\u201cUnderwear,\u201d he managed. \u201cWhere is your underwear?\u201d\nEvery world had its prudes. But why had that anonymous \u2018angel\u2019 send her one of the extras?\nGeorge quietly asked, \u201cWhat were you going to do . . . at this club . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cDrink a little,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd dance until I collapsed.\u201d\nGeorge dropped his gaze again.\n\u201cYou were married to this body,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t know it quite well by now.\u201d\nHe nodded. But then it seemed important to mention, \u201cWe have children.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\u201cYour figure . . . my wife\u2019s . . . well, you\u2019re quite a bit thinner than she is now . . . \u201d\n\u201cThan she was,\u201d Mary said.\nHis eyes jumped up.\n\u201cIn your old world, you are a drowned corpse,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must have had your reasons, George. And you can tell me all about them, if you want. But I don\u2019t care why you decided to throw yourself off that bridge. Your reasons really don\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\n\u201cMy family . . . \u201d he began.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll get by, and they won\u2019t.\u201d\nHe shook his head sorrowfully.\n\u201cEvery response on their part is inevitable, George. And neither of us can imagine all of the ramifications.\u201d\n\u201cI abandoned them,\u201d he whispered.\n\u201cAnd on countless other earths, you didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t make the blunders that put you up on that bridge, or you pushed through your little troubles. You married a different woman. You married ten other women. Or you fell deeply in love with a handsome boy named Felix, and the two of you moved to Mars and were married on the summit of the First Sister\u2019s volcano, and you and your soul mate quickly adopted a hundred Martian babies\u2014little golden aliens who called both of you Pappy and built a palace for you out of frozen piss and their own worshipful blood.\u201d\nGeorge very much wanted to collapse. But the nearest seat was the round and spacious bed.\nHe wouldn\u2019t let himself approach it.\nBut she did. She sat on the edge and let her dress ride high, proving if he dared look that she was indeed wearing underwear after all.\n\u201cThis club you were going to . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cYes, George?\u201d\n\u201cWhat else happened there? If you don\u2019t mind my asking.\u201d\nJealousy sounded the same on every earth. But she did her best to deflect his emotions, laughing for a moment or two before quietly asking, \u201cDid your Mary ever enjoy sex?\u201d\nDespite himself, George smiled.\n\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s something she and I have in common.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have me in common too,\u201d he mentioned.\n\u201cNow we do, yes.\u201d\nThen this out-of-place man surprised her. He was stared at her bare knees and the breasts behind the sheer fabric. But the voice was in control, lucid and calm, when he inquired, \u201cWhat about that tiny gun? The one you took out of your coat and put in your purse?\u201d\n\u201cYou saw that?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe laughed, thrilled by the unexpected.\nPulling open the satchel, she showed the weapon to her guest. \u201cEvery earth has its sterling qualities, and each has its bad features too. My home can seem a little harsh at times. Maybe you noticed the rough souls along Main Street. Crime and public drunkenness are the reasons why quite a few good citizens carry weapons wherever they go.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never fired this gun at any person, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cBut would you?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\u201cTo kill?\u201d he blubbered.\n\u201cOn other earths, that\u2019s what I am doing now. Shooting bad men and the worst women. And I\u2019m glad to do it.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you think that?\u201d\n\u201cEasily, George.\u201d She passed the gun between her hands. \u201cRemember when I told you that our richest citizens can travel from earth to earth? To a lesser degree, that freedom belongs to everyone, everywhere. It was the same on your home world too, although you didn\u2019t understand it at the time.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it now,\u201d he admitted.\n\u201cYou are here, George. You are here because an angelic individual took the effort to duplicate you\u2014cell for cell, experience for experience. Then your wingless benefactor set you down on a world where he believed that you would survive, or even thrive.\u201d With her finger off the trigger, she tapped the pistol against her own temple. \u201cDeath is a matter of degree, George. This gun can\u2019t go off, unless the twin safeties fail. But I guarantee you that right now, somebody exactly like me is shooting herself in the head. Her brains are raining all over you. Yet she doesn\u2019t entirely die.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d She lowered the gun, nodding wistfully. \u201cWe have too many drinkers on this world, and with that comes a fairly high suicide rate. Which is only reasonable. Since we understand that anybody can escape this world at any time, just like you fled your home\u2014leap off the bridge, hope for paradise, but remaining open-minded enough to accept a little less.\u201d\nGeorge finally settled on edge of the bed, close enough to touch her but his hands primly folded on his long lap. \u201cWhat are you telling me?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat people kill themselves just to change worlds?\u201d\n\u201cIs there a better reason than that?\u201d\nHe thought hard about the possibilities. \u201cThis angel that saved me. He isn\u2019t the only one, I take it.\u201d\n\u201cThey come from endless earths, some far more powerful than ours. There\u2019s no way to count all of them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do they always save the dead?\u201d\n\u201cOh, they hardly ever do that,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt is a genuine one-in-a-trillion-trillion-trillion occurrence. But if an infinite number of Georges jump off the bridge, then even that one-in-almost-never incident is inevitable. In fact, that tiny unlikely fraction is itself an infinite number.\u201d\nHe shook his head numbly.\nShe leaned back on her elbows. \u201cMost of these benefactors . . . your angel, for instance . . . throw those that they\u2019ve saved onto earths that feel comfortable with refugees like you. My world, for instance.\u201d\n\u201cThis happens often?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly often. But I know of half a dozen incidents this year, and that\u2019s just in our district.\u201d\nGeorge looked down at his cold wet socks.\n\u201cUnlike God,\u201d she promised, \u201cquantum magic is at work everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cDo you understand all the science, Mary?\u201d\nShe sat up again. \u201cI\u2019m a librarian, not a high-physics priestess.\u201d\nThat pleased him. She watched his smile, and then at last she noticed that her guest was beginning to shiver.\n\u201cYou\u2019re cold, George.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I am.\u201d\n\u201cTake off those awful socks.\u201d\nHe did as instructed. Then laughing amiably, he admitted, \u201cThere. Now you sound exactly like my wife.\u201d\nThey were both laughing when something large suddenly moved beneath the big bed.\nGeorge felt the vibration, and alarmed, he stared at Mary.\n\u201cMy cats,\u201d she offered. \u201cThey\u2019re usually shy around strangers.\u201d\n\u201cBut that felt . . . \u201d He lifted his bare feet. \u201cBig.\u201d\n\u201cKitties,\u201d she sang. \u201cSweeties.\u201d\nThree long bodies crawled into the open, stretching while eyeing the newcomer from a safe distance.\n\u201cWhat kinds of cats are those?\u201d George whispered.\n\u201cRex is the miniature cougar,\u201d she explained. \u201cHex is the snow leopard. And Missie is half pygmy tiger, half griffon.\u201d\nWith awe in his voice, George said, \u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cI take that to mean you didn\u2019t have cats like this on your earth?\u201d\n\u201cNot close to this,\u201d he agreed.\nShe sat back again, sinking into the mattress.\nAnd again, this man surprised her. \u201cYou mentioned Mars.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I did. Why?\u201d\n\u201cOn my earth, we thought that there could be some kind of simple life on that world.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know for certain?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cBut a few minutes ago, you mentioned something about Martians. Are they real, or did you just make them up?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re real somewhere, George.\u201d\nHe frowned.\nThen she laughed, explaining, \u201cYes, my Mars is home to some very ancient life forms. Tiny golden aliens that drink nothing but peroxides. And my Venus is covered with airborne jungles and an ocean that doesn\u2019t boil because of the enormous air pressure. And Sisyphus is covered with beautiful forests of living ice\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat world\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cBetween Mars and Jupiter,\u201d she mentioned.\nGeorge blinked, took a big breath and burst out laughing.\nThat was when Mary told her blouse to fall open.\nHe stared at her, and the laughter stopped. But he was still smiling, looking shamelessly happy, begging her, \u201cBut first, Mary . . . would you please put your gun? Someplace safe. After everything I\u2019ve been through, I don\u2019t want even the tiniest chance of something going wrong now.\u201d\nRobert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

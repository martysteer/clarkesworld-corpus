Automated voices in particular are interesting, found in everything from our handheld robots to our future means of travel off planet. Who\u2014and what\u2014we listen to, and don\u2019t, and why, and how? This impacts us greatly going forward.\n Also I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about GlaDOS, but I\u2019ll get to that in a second.\n Ten years ago, a study appeared in the medical journal NeuroImage that got some major traction and is still generating headlines. The article\u2019s title was \u201cMale and female voices activate distinct regions in the male brain\u201d (Sokhi D.S., Hunter M.D., Wilkinson I.D., Woodruff P.W. NeuroImage 27 9/2005) and stated, as it said on the tin, \u201c . . . in the male brain, the perception of male and female voices activates distinct brain regions.\u201d\n In 2015, NeuroImage published another article by several of the same authors, \u201cDiscrimination of Voice Gender in the Auditory Cortex\u201d (Philip S.J. Weston P.S., Hunter M.D., Dilraj S., Wilkinson I.D., Woodruff P.W.) that elaborated:\n \n \u201c . . . discrete sites in non-primary auditory cortex are differentially activated by male and female voices, with female voices consistently evoking greater activation in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus and posterior superior temporal plane.\u201d (NeuroImage 15 1/2015)\n \n The media, then and now, frothed forth with headlines like, \u201cWhy Men Can\u2019t Hear Women\u201d (Netscape, subtitle: \u201cHe Really Isn\u2019t Listening To You!\u201d), \u201cWhy Are Men Incapable Of Listening To Women\u201d (The Telegraph), and \u201cIt\u2019s All Your Fault Again\u201d (okay I made that last one up).\n In some cases, they got the bit right about hearing women\u2019s voices in the same part of the brain that processes music, and in some cases, they just threw up their collective typographical hands and said \u201cjust one of those things, I guess, were you saying something?\u201d\n Those media interpretations of this research as \u201cMen don\u2019t listen to women because science!\u201d has been troubling me for some time. Not only is it a terrible transposition of a Tiptree title (The Women Men Don\u2019t Hear?), but it is also a deliberate misreading of science, and dangerous to our survival as a species.\n Hear me out:\n The headlines you are being sold are disproven the minute you get in your car or turn on your phone. The moment your GPS says \u201cturn left,\u201d and you do it, you are listening, a good percentage of the time, to a female voice. In fact, I suspect each of those headlines was written by someone with at least one digital assistant with a female voice attached. Because we all have them.\n From Siri and GPS devices to games and the ships on our favorite SFF shows, we listen exceedingly well to female voices: they guide us, occasionally tease us, and often inform us. And, despite the headlines, this is in part because: science!\n As the studies mentioned above illustrate, certain voices equal higher processing in the higher cortex. Also instrumental: certain voices hit a musically soothing baseline. Parents of toddlers know this one well: if you want a child to listen and remember, sing the thing.\n Many of the automated voices in networks and transport have been female as well.\n The deployment of the female voice for communication has been going on since the first large-scale human-created media networks when, in 1878, Emma Nutt became the first female telephone operator. Alexander Graham Bell hired her and soon found that, unlike the teenage boys who had been manning the switches, \u201cEmma Nutt, was patient and soothing and spoke in a cultured voice. She was such a success that women rapidly replaced boys. By the end of the 1880s, nearly all telephone operators were women.\u201d (New England Historical Society)\n The female voice has since percolated up through our entertainment, our emergency warnings, and more. You can find dozens of articles online discussing Artificial Intelligences, which are often portrayed as and given female voices (in the Atlantic & Live Science to name a few). Often, these travel with words like \u201csoothing\u201d and \u201cpleasant\u201d and occasionally, \u201cmelodic\u201d\u2014just like music.\n That processing power women\u2019s voices seem to access in the auditory cortex is good news for robots giving directions or responding to requests, even as it is seemingly bad\u2014according to those headlines\u2014for actual women who have new things to say. (When I was telling The Chemist about this essay, he observed a lot of people unwilling to trust road directions from the woman riding in the passenger seat are quite happy to take directions from Siri.)\n However. Hang on for a moment. Doesn\u2019t this worry you? It worries me. It almost reminds me of that line from the \u201990s movie Species:\n Xavier Fitch: We decided to make it female so it would be more docile and controllable.Preston Lennox: More docile and controllable, eh? You guys don't get out much.\n So this is where GlaDOS comes in\u2014because the game Portal definitely gets the risk and the joke of having a soothingly voiced AI whose goal is to launch you from an aerial faith plate while promising cake. \u201cThe Love And Rocket\u201d episode of Futurama gets it too. Speaking of that, the ships of our Science Fiction\u2014why do they (with one glaring exception) have female voices? Depends on who you ask.\n Helva, the brainship from The Ship Who Sang, is one of a number of memorable ship voices from the Anne McCaffrey saga. She is notable for her opera, but she can sing all the parts when she needs to. More notable is that the ships in the story are both male and female.\n Other ship voices\u2014HAL 9000 in particular, is a modulated voice engineered to be creepy. \u201cI can\u2019t do that, Dave,\u201d is part of our audio lexicon for a reason. But HAL is a rarity. The default for ship voices has been female for a long time.\n Again, there\u2019s history, this time with aircraft\u2014including Northrop\u2019s Convair B-58 Hustler. Warning signals on military aircraft have been given many female names and sobriquets\u2014including \u201cBitching Betty,\u201d \u201cSexy Sally,\u201d and \u201cNagging Nora.\u201d Here\u2019s why:\n \n \u201cResearch during the era of all-male combat aircraft assignments revealed that a woman\u2019s voice was more likely to gain the attention of young men in distracting situations.\u201d (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_B-58_Hustler)\n \n In science fiction, this bit of history percolates through everything, possibly influencing the future. Federation ship voices are female in Star Trek. On SyFy\u2019s Killjoys, Lucy is the ship with attitude. In Futurama\u2019s \u201cLove and Rocket\u201d episode, the Planet Express gets a female voice module . . . and shenanigans ensue. (I\u2019ll just point out right here that it\u2019s Leela who has to jump in and fix everything, again, and leave the rest to your imagination.)\n So . . . I put it to you to consider this question: If the media is conditioning everyone to be okay with listening to female robot voices, while encouraging people to ignore actual female voices, are we edging closer to a major problem?\n Are we in fact growing used to following automated female voices when receiving directions? We do what they say by reflex . . . Google Maps says turn left, we turn left. Even into a wall. GlaDOS says we\u2019re doing well, we feel pretty good about ourselves.\n It\u2019s a big risk to take, especially with AI getting smarter. So, a modest proposal, from an SFF writer. Let\u2019s figure out why we listen, and don\u2019t, to each other, and, maybe, before we climb aboard ships with voices of any kind, how to listen to each other better too.\n Fran Wilde's novels and short stories have been finalists for three Nebula awards, two Hugo Awards, and a World Fantasy Award.

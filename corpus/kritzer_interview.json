Everywhere you look, there\u2019s a kitten stuck in a piece of toast, a tabby karate kicking a dog, or a Siamese cat rocking out to dubstep. If you peel back the layers of the Internet, you\u2019re sure to find a cat tangled up in Ethernet wires right at the core.\n\u201cCat Pictures Please\u201d by Naomi Kritzer first appeared right here in Clarkesworld Magazine and recently won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story. It revolves around a benevolent AI inserting itself into the lives of unsuspecting humans as long as they provide it with cat pictures. Not only does the story tap into the kitty core of the Internet, but also dives much deeper into the interesting and flawed humans that post those cat pictures. It\u2019s a deceptive story full of humor and heart that rewards multiple readings.\nNaomi Kritzer\u2019s short stories have been published in Asimov\u2019s, Analog, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Realms of Fantasy, Strange Horizons, and Clarkesworld Magazine. She has numerous novels available from Bantam and two e-book short story collections out: Gift of the Winter King and Other Stories, and Comrade Grandmother and Other Stories. She has been nominated for the Nebula Award and won the 2016 Hugo and Locus Awards for \u201cCat Pictures Please.\u201d\nCongratulations on winning a Hugo Award for \u201cCat Pictures Please!\u201d How does it feel?\nAwesome! I\u2019m still smiling.\nWhy do you think the Internet is obsessed with cats?\nProbably because people are obsessed with cats.\nI currently have three cats, by the way: Emilycat, a well-behaved tabby who\u2019s the current senior feline in residence; Balto, a very large black cat who never got the \u201cobligate carnivore\u201d memo and has been known to rip open bags of sugar to snack on it; and Cassie Fluffypants, an extremely pretty longhaired cat who likes to sit behind my head and try to groom me like an errant kitten. I would post more pictures of them, but I have a cheap phone with a mediocre camera.\nWhat inspired you to write \u201cCat Pictures Please?\u201d\nI carry an Android phone, and at some point Google started helpfully suggesting that this building I drove past daily was my workplace. (When I\u2019d open the Google Now app they\u2019d show me a little map of the building and ask, \u201cIs this your workplace?\u201d with a button I could click to say \u201coh yes, Google, you\u2019ve found it!\u201d) I did not work in this building, but after Google repeatedly asked me about it I went and looked up their job listings because I thought, huh, maybe Google knows something I don\u2019t; maybe it should be my workplace. (I found no jobs I was qualified for.) Pretending that my phone\u2019s random quirks were an attempt by an intelligence to manipulate me was really amusing. This combined with the observation that the Internet loves cat pictures, and I was basically off and running.\nWhen you\u2019re trying to figure out what to write next, what is it that usually captures your attention about an idea and makes you want to expand it into a story? Is it an image or a character or a setting?\nI usually start with a scenario; the characters come next. The sense of having a full story is usually what propels me into writing. When I jump in without knowing where I\u2019m going, usually I don\u2019t end up going much of anywhere.\nHow many autographed cat pictures did you give away at Worldcon?\nTwo, I think. And in both cases I offered them to people who\u2019d asked me to autograph books. People clearly liked the idea of signed cat pictures but didn\u2019t ask for them.\nWhere do you keep your Hugo Award?\nIt is currently on the buffet in the dining room. The problem is, one of the cats (Balto) managed to knock a heavy stone sculpture off the mantelpiece yesterday. (Amazingly, the sculpture did not break, nor did it land on the cat. This is truly a heavy, stable, hard-to-knock-over sort of sculpture, but the cat managed it.) I really don\u2019t want my Hugo to get broken, so I need to figure out a reasonably cat-proof location.\nI\u2019ve noticed that you occasionally like to play with the format of short stories. \u201cSo Much Cooking\u201d is a perfect example of this. What inspired you to write a story masquerading as a food blog?\nI get a lot of my recipes these days from food blogs. Food blogs tend to speak in a very characteristic voice: always enthusiastic, sometimes a little breathless, often reassuring (you can totally debone this chicken, followers! Sharpen your knives and I\u2019ll talk you through it!). So I had that voice in my head just from scrolling through some of my favorite recipes. (Here\u2019s an example: http://bevcooks.com/2014/01/crock-pot-chicken-tacos/\u2014this recipe is basically \u201cthrow raw chicken into a crock pot with salsa and turn on the crock pot,\u201d by the way, so you can see why I like it so much.)\nThe second piece of the idea came from the winter of 2014\u20132015, when Boston got about twenty feet of snow. My friends and relatives there kept digging out, barely, only to get snowed in again the next day. One of my friends posted to her blog about being out of almost everything but wine. This got me thinking about the sort of weird things my family might end up eating if we were being endlessly snowed in, and how a food blogger would talk about them (\u201cI knew that sliced beef heart would come in handy eventually!\u201d). Of course, \u201csnowed in\u201d is a fairly mundane emergency; a pandemic was a lot more compelling.\nWhat does your writing process look like? Do you spend a lot of time planning and mulling over a project before you start writing or do you dive right into the first draft?\nI often brainstorm and outline by hand in a notebook. I like unlined paper for this, so I buy myself small (5.5\u201dx8.5\u201d) sketchbooks. Drawing paper is also nice and thick so I can write on both sides without bleed-through. I couldn\u2019t find my notes on \u201cCat Pictures Please\u201d but I found some for the first draft of \u201cSo Much Cooking.\u201d I outlined the blog posts like this:\n- roast chicken over potatoes w/lemon + garlic | defy the birds! eat them!\n- chocolate pecan pie with bourbon whipped cream | anxiety! live for today!\n- substitute cookies\u2014mayo for eggs, leftover mix of chips | terror, holy shit, all going to die\nI was thinking in terms of both of the recipes and the emotional flow of the story. Interestingly, when I made this outline, I was thinking that the blogger and her husband were just alone for most of the epidemic; it\u2019s not until the next page I wrote \u201chas teen + pre-teen come stay with her,\u201d and then I realized that bringing in two kids could rapidly lead to more. I actually stuck fairly close to the recipe outline I came up with, and the line from the outline, \u201cthis is no longer a food blog; it is a boredom and isolation blog\u201d made it in. (Also \u201cthis is a food blog, not a disease blog . . . \u201d)\nOnce I have a complete first draft of a short story, I hand it out to my writers\u2019 group. I revise based on feedback, let it sit for a week, re-read, revise again, and submit.\nWhen I\u2019m writing a novel, I don\u2019t draft the whole thing before handing it out for critique\u2014I hand out a chapter or two at a time.\nWhat other projects are you working on?\nIn process and not yet done:\n- A short story that sprang from a note I made to myself when someone on a con panel groused about stories about little girls and wee little fairies. I wrote \u201clittle girls & wee little fairies\u201d because I was convinced I could do something interesting and unconventional with it. Years ago I ran across a term coined by Children\u2019s Literature scholar Anne Scott McLeod, \u201cCaddie Woodlawn Syndrome,\u201d for a pattern you see a lot in children\u2019s lit for girls where the girl protagonist is allowed a wild, ungendered, tomboyish childhood but must give up her freedom and \u201cbecome a lady\u201d when she reaches a certain age. Frequently \u201cbecoming a lady\u201d is framed as acceptance of maturity and responsibility\u2014it\u2019s her coming of age, essentially. In my Wee Little Fairies story, the fairies are both literally real, and a metaphor for this set of expectations. We\u2019ll see if it works when I\u2019m done with it.\n- I\u2019ve had a series of near-future SF short stories published in F&SF about a character named Beck Garrison who has grown up on a sea-stead. (An artificial island built in the Pacific Ocean.) In the last published story, Beck was brought back to California by her mother, and the story I\u2019m working on, \u201cCalifornia Dreaming,\u201d is about her experiences trying to attend high school in Pasadena. (Her problem-solving skills are not really appreciated by her high school vice principal.)\n- I started work on a short story that was an attempt at being a meta-ghost-story. I didn\u2019t know where I was going and this story has refused to go anywhere but I\u2019m not ready to just give up on it.\nWhat was the best piece of writing advice you were ever given?\nJoin a writers\u2019 group.\nDid Neil Clarke pay you in cat pictures for your Hugo Award winning story?\nI am delighted to say that Neil pays in actual money! An AI can afford to take payment in cat pictures because it has no expenses. (If the programming team started charging it rent for its servers, it might change its tune very quickly.)\nChris Urie is a writer and editor from Ocean City, NJ.

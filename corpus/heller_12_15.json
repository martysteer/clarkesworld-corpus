Rex\n\u201cGet it on. Bang a gong. Get it on.\u201d\nThese simple lyrics are Marc Bolan\u2019s calling card\u2014at least in the United States, where the 1971 song \u201cGet It On (Bang a Gong)\u201d became the lone hit by Marc Bolan\u2019s band T. Rex. A staple of classic-rock radio, \u201cGet It On\u201d is not the type of song that threatened to storm the rarified heights of the poetic canon. A slinky affair full of sly rhythm and stomping riffs, \u201cGet It On\u201d wormed its way into the ears of America\u2014Bolan had already established himself as a superstar in his native England\u2014like some unholy progeny of heavy metal and bubblegum pop. Glam rock, the genre he helped create, was launched into a loftier orbit by David Bowie, his friend, rival, and closest contemporary. But unlike Bowie\u2019s angst-ridden tales about his alien alter ego Ziggy Stardust and the lost astronaut Major Tom, Bolan was happy to write bouncy nonsense.\nDig a little deeper into \u201cGet It On,\u201d however, and there\u2019s something far more fantastic at play. Amid his blunt entreaties for sex, Bolan sprinkles a curious assortment of heady non-sequiturs. \u201cYou got the teeth of the Hydra upon you,\u201d goes one line; \u201cWith your cloak full of eagles,\u201d goes another. These aren\u2019t the brute come-ons of your typical \u201970s cock-rock song. They\u2019re phrases that could have appeared in a book of high fantasy\u2014a term coined in 1971 by Lloyd Alexander, author of the fantasy epic The Chronicles of Prydain\u2014or even a spirited session of Chainmail, the groundbreaking fantasy role-playing game that was co-created by future Dungeons & Dragons icon Gary Gygax and released in 1971, just as \u201cGet It On\u201d was ascending the pop charts.\nAs it turns out, Bowie wasn\u2019t the only major glam-rock star in the early \u201970s who flaunted an appreciation for\u2014and an appropriation of\u2014speculative fiction. It may not be immediately obvious from \u201cGet It On,\u201d but Bolan is one of the 20th century\u2019s foremost unifiers of popular music and fantasy (and to a lesser degree, science fiction\u2014or more precisely, the hybrid subgenre of science-fantasy, which better suited Bolan\u2019s romantic view of the cosmos). His appreciation wasn\u2019t a passing fancy or part of some fad. Taken as a whole, Bolan\u2019s body of work\u2014if not his entire life, cut short as it was in 1977 at the age of 29\u2014was an extended, elaborate narrative spun of myth and magic.\nFantasy was in Marc Bolan\u2019s bones.\nIn the London borough of Hackney in 1955, eight-year-old Mark Feld lay in bed with the measles. Ill though he was, he wasn\u2019t alone. The boy was surrounded by dinosaurs, the inhabitants of books on prehistoric creatures that his parents, of limited means but always indulgent of their two sons, had given him. Those dinosaurs \u201cwere like dragons that could have breathed fire and smoke,\u201d he later reminisced, long after changing his name to Marc Bolan, \u201cand somehow, because they existed, they justified unicorns and centaurs and the whole Narnia scene.\u201d\nC. S. Lewis\u2019 The Chronicles of Narnia\u2014published between 1950 and 1956, just as the young Mark Feld was learning to read and developed a lifelong love of books\u2014proved to be just one of the many works of speculative fiction that fascinated the boy. Another was the seminal SF short story \u201cA Sound of Thunder\u201d by Ray Bradbury. In particular, the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex being hunted by time travelers in Bradbury\u2019s story lodged in Feld\u2019s impressionable mind. To him, dinosaurs again equated to dragons, not to mention the notion that Earth\u2019s primordial past was a vast fantasia of strange, preternatural beings.\nThat notion was driven home by another series of books that captivated Feld: The Lord of the Rings. J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s famed fantasy trilogy, plus its predecessor, The Hobbit, became the boy\u2019s bible. It didn\u2019t hurt that Feld was unnaturally small for his age, with cherubic cheeks, curly hair, and a twinkle in his eye, which surely caused him to empathize with Frodo, Bilbo, and the other hobbits of the Shire. (Even as an adult, Feld would never top five-foot-seven.) And of course, The Hobbit held a dragon\u2014the fearsome, saurian behemoth that would continue to enthrall Feld after he grew up, changed his name, and remembered \u201cA Sound of Thunder\u201d when dubbing his band Tyrannosaurus Rex (later to be shortened to T. Rex).\nTyrannosaurus Rex formed in 1967, but Bolan\u2014like Bowie\u2014underwent some changes to get there. His first solo single under the name Marc Bolan was released in 1965; it flopped, but its title, \u201cThe Wizard,\u201d more than hinted at Bolan\u2019s unabashed adoration of fantasy literature. \u201cWalking in the woods one day,\u201d he sings, \u201cI met a man who said that he was magic.\u201d After observing the salient details of the mage\u2019s appearance, including the \u201cpointed hat upon his head\u201d and the fact that \u201cshadows followed him all around,\u201d Bolan concludes the song with the eerie couplet, \u201cSilver sunlight in his eyes / The wizard turned and melted in the sky.\u201d Although not named, the song\u2019s titular wizard is a dead ringer for Tolkien\u2019s Gandalf.\nThe failure of \u201cThe Wizard,\u201d as well as a brief stint in the rock band John\u2019s Children, left Bolan directionless\u2014that is, until he reinvented himself as the elfin shaman of the psychedelic folk duo Tyrannosaurus Rex. With percussionist Stephen Ross Porter\u2014renamed Steve Peregrin Took in honor of the hobbit Peregrin Took from The Lord of the Rings\u2014the twosome took the hippie aesthetic to a mystical extreme. The pair wore extravagant robes, sat cross-legged on stages as if initiating some sorcerous rite, and began crafting music that evoked the myths, legends, and creatures of some imaginary past. Albums titles such as 1968\u2019s My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair but Now They\u2019re Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows; 1968\u2019s Prophets, Seers, and Sages, the Angels of the Ages; and 1969\u2019s Unicorn drove home Bolan\u2019s obsession with fantasy\u2014one every ounce as powerful as Bowie\u2019s obsession with science fiction, which was soon to become prominent with his 1969 smash \u201cSpace Oddity.\u201d According to Peter Doggett\u2019s book on Bowie, The Man Who Sold the World, Bolan claimed to have written part of \u201cSpace Oddity,\u201d a claim that\u2019s never been corroborated\u2014although Bolan did play guitar on \u201cPrettiest Star,\u201d Bowie\u2019s next single after \u201cSpace Oddity.\u201d\nIn fact, Bolan and Bowie would end up working with the same producer, Tony Visconti\u2014only Bolan came with a condition. He insisted that Visconti read Tolkien before working with him. As Visconti recounts in the 2007 BBC documentary Marc Bolan: The Final Word, Bolan told him, \u201cI want you to read The Lord of the Rings. Read this if you want to know what I\u2019m about.\u201d But Bolan was more than simply obsessed; he was immersed. Visconti adds, \u201cHe actually lived [in Tolkien\u2019s realm of Middle-earth]. In his mind, that all existed. He saw himself as maybe, possibly, a reincarnation of some bard or some wizard that lived in the time when elves walked the earth.\u201d Coincidentally, or perhaps not, Bolan regularly performed in an English nightclub in the late \u201960s called Middle Earth.\nBolan considered himself \u201ca science fiction writer who sings,\u201d presumably using the term \u201cscience fiction\u201d as a catch-all for science fiction and fantasy, as was common at the time. He worked on an ultimately unrealized science-fiction rock opera, writing songs for it such as \u201cBrain Police,\u201d \u201cMetropolis\u201d (possibly a reference to Fritz Lang\u2019s 1927 SF film of the same name, also a favorite of Bowie\u2019s), and \u201cDynamo.\u201d He even once told radio interviewer that he had numerous fantasy novels of his own in the works.\nOne such planned book, The Children of Rarn, never came to be, but Bolan had at least thought it through extensively. \u201cIt\u2019s about prehistoric Earth,\u201d he once explained, \u201cbefore the dinosaurs were heavy creatures. There were two races of people then, the Peacelings and the Dworns, and a third group of beings called Lithons, all locked in complex, antagonistic relationships\u201d\u2014akin to some amalgam of H. G. Wells\u2019 The Time Machine, with its Eloi and Morlocks, and Hammer Films\u2019 popular prehistoric movies of the time, such as 1966\u2019s One Million Years B.C. Years later, he claimed to have written a book of science fiction stories titled Wilderness of My Mind\u2014and although the book has yet to surface, Bolan boastfully claimed that none other than Ray Bradbury, Bolan\u2019s formative influence, had shown an interest in it.\nThat said, Bolan did publish a book. In 1969, his collection of fantasy poetry Warlock of Love\u2014a title that might as well have described the robed, spellbinding, sensuous Bolan himself\u2014was released, and it became a cult hit. \u201cDedicated to the woods of knowledge,\u201d it began, and a typical snippet of the text reads like so:\nThe questical day had held all the promise of an artist,\nbut with the grey horseless cloud of the autumn\nafternoon all hope of starfields revealed was lost, as\na pebble of love in the black scorched deserts of\ncivilisation.\nAs a last hermetic gesture, with the masts of the\nday spent, the gaunt man, pure of skin but soiled\nof soul, prepared his parchment scroll and crouched\nlike a beggar began the last task of his day\u2014an\netching of a child, blue skinned and shapen like a\nfowl of the skies, with eyes so true and hallowed\nthat the artition wept as he drew, and already the\nquest was begun.\nWhere Bowie peered forward with fear and wonder into humankind\u2019s technological tomorrow, Bolan looked backward\u2014even though his mention of \u201cthe black scorched deserts of civilization\u201d in Warlock of Love alluded to a science-fantasy hybrid, one where an apocalypse, possibly atomic in origin, had cleared the world of science and left room for magic.\nThe arcadian, folklore-like aura that surrounded Bolan\u2019s fantasy-themed music with Tyrannosaurus Rex didn\u2019t reach the audience he\u2019d hoped. In an attempt to appeal to a more universal listenership, the band\u2019s 1970 album T. Rex tinkered with shorter, punchier, electrified songs. Bolan fired Took, hired a more conventional rock band, and shortened the group\u2019s name to T. Rex. (Following Took\u2019s ouster, the drummer formed a short-lived psychedelic group called Shagrat, named after an orc from The Lord of the Rings.)\nT. Rex went on to release anthems like \u201cGet It On (Bang a Gong),\u201d thus fulfilling Bolan\u2019s ambitions of stardom. But even then, his swaggering riffs and daydream lyrics retained traces of Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s fantastical vibe. In 1970, Bolan\u2019s appearance as a guest guitarist on Bowie\u2019s Venusian-populated song \u201cMemory of a Free Festival\u201d was not only one of the points where the two glam titans collided on tape, but where glam rock became a primary vessel for science fiction and fantasy in song\u2014although in a campier, pulpier, more mysteriously playful way than the sober-faced adaptations of those genres happening at the same time in progressive rock. (Venus would pop up again in \u201cVenus Loon,\u201d a 1974 song from the T. Rex album Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow, itself a cheeky nod to Bowie\u2019s more famous fictional band, Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.) At one point in the summer of 1974, Bowie and Bolan spent days in a hotel room binge-watching a print of A Clockwork Orange that they\u2019d procured, a testament to just how much the science fiction of Stanley Kubrick and Anthony Burgess affected their work. In his book Electric Eden, Rob Young observes, \u201cBolan and Bowie were [\u2026] Pied Pipers [\u2026], transporting their young listeners from immersion in a speculative, mythological past and repositioning pop music in a future of plastic, glitter, and tin.\u201d\nScience fiction continued to seep into Bolan\u2019s fantasy. Smuggling in references to mythical creatures, space travel, and cosmic awe, T. Rex songs like 1971\u2019s \u201cPlanet Queen\u201d and the following year\u2019s \u201cBallroom of Mars\u201d lured listeners into a kaleidoscopic, science-fantasy universe of Bolan\u2019s construction\u2014all while evoking SF legends like Edgar Rice Burroughs, whose John Carter of Mars series similarly combined fantasy and science fiction into a staggeringly wondrous whole. No T. Rex album exemplifies this better than 1976\u2019s Futuristic Dragon; the cover depicts Bolan\u2014or a character closely resembling him\u2014riding a smoke-bellowing dragon, like some Celtic warrior of yore going forth to vanquish the cold forces of anachronistic technocracy. (It was painted by the famed artist George Underwood, who was also responsible for the covers of Bowie\u2019s Hunky Dory and Ziggy Stardust as well as numerous science fiction and fantasy novels.)\nFuturistic Dragon is by no means a concept album, let alone one entirely adhering to science-fantasy. Songs such as \u201cJupiter Liar\u201d and \u201cTheme for a Dragon,\u201d however, conjure familiar SFF themes\u2014although not as potently as the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cFuturistic Dragon (Introduction).\u201d A piece of spoken-word poetry recited over Hendrix-meets-disco weirdness, it sums up Bolan\u2019s fantasist fever-dream in a handful of compact, vivid lines:\nDeep beneath an ancient shadow\nStunned with age and too much wisdom\nReclined in glass, with eyes too steep\nRelentless dimensions of quadrophonic sleep\nDwelt the wild grinning cyclopean pagan\nScreaming destruction in sheer dazzling raiment\nA thunderbolt master, a \u2019lectronic savior\nA cold galactic raver, the Futuristic Dragon\nBolan\u2019s untimely death in a car crash a year after Futuristic Dragon\u2019s release left the sprawling saga that he wove throughout his songs tragically unfinished. Still, Bolan was able to lodge one last plea in favor of the literary genres he so passionately embodied. In his column in the British music magazine Record Mirror on September 10, 1977\u2014six days before his death\u2014he penned a glowing review of Star Wars, which he\u2019d just seen. In it he wrote, \u201cNow perhaps people will pay more attention to the science fiction field where so many great poets, writers, and musicians are lurking unsung.\u201d\nLike George Lucas, Marc Bolan preached science fiction and fantasy to the masses. In an era before speculative fiction had become respected and embraced by the mainstream, he smuggled speculative fiction into more popular and palatable forms, easy to digest but still holding true to what makes SFF tick: imagination, spectacle, and a quest for understanding unrestrained by the mundane and banal. In an interview, Bolan was once asked what drove him to become a star\u2014what kept him up there in the limelight besides the obvious worldly rewards of fame and fortune. His response: \u201cOn that stage, I\u2019m at liberty. I\u2019m in a realm of fantasy.\u201d\nJason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

His assigned jockey for the day\u2019s salvage was already hunched over his pre-flight checks at the console. Glancing up at Shepard\u2019s entrance, he made a disappointed grunt before resuming his work.\n \u201cFantastic,\u201d the jockey said. \u201cI get the geezer.\u201d\n \u201cHello, Caine,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cHow deep today?\u201d\n \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n A jockey\u2019s usual sentiment.\n Behind the chair, Shepard placed his hands in the small of his back and stretched. Soon enough, Caine folded up his charts and spun around. For a long moment he watched Shepard at his calisthenics. He asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to complain about your knees again, are you?\u201d\n \u201cMy knees are fine,\u201d Shepard lied.\n \u201cBecause you did before. It was a lot of complaining.\u201d He watched a moment more before shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re too old for this.\u201d\n \u201cBetter than obsolete,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cDon\u2019t these things fly themselves?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what all the graybeards say.\u201d\n Under Caine\u2019s observation, Shepard leaned first to one side, then the other.\n \u201cAre you done now?\u201d Caine asked. \u201cCan you be done? Because there\u2019s work to do. You\u2019re reminding me of that thing your dad always said.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Do your work?\u2019\u201d\n \u201cNo, the other one.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be stupid?\u2019\u201c\n Caine tapped his nose. \u201cA wise man, your father.\u201d\n Although mostly engine, the tug crawled from her dock as though incapable of mustering speed. She was an ugly sight, her flanks blistered from high-temperature encounters with unstable artifacts. She was scored with heat discoloration and pitted with impact scars. She had been a shuttle in a past life, before being retrofitted with scavenged alien engines and put to work hauling junk. These bulbous additions had been bolted on aft, and accounted for two-thirds of her mass. She looked unimpressive, but she hauled wreckage.\n Eighty kilometers above Earth\u2019s moon, Caine and Shepard abandoned the cockpit for the tug\u2019s passenger cabin. All but two facing rows of seats had been removed to make room for the biology of the engines. Like the roots of a tree, piping and conduits ran from floor to ceiling and all along the bulkheads. From inside, it seemed the engines had not so much been bolted to the tug, as grown into it. When stoked, they would sweat something like a mucus-blood mixture, which stank like burning fat, and sizzled on the floor.\n Strapping in opposite one another, Caine and Shepard made themselves as comfortable as possible in the limited space. For a little while, the only sound was the heating.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be you?\u201d Caine asked with a shudder. \u201cSo old.\u201d\n Shepard craned his neck toward the cockpit. \u201cDid you forget to press start?\u201d\n \u201cPatience,\u201d Caine admonished. \u201cThey\u2019re warming.\u201d\n Relaxing into the headrest, Shepard gazed at the ceiling. \u201cYou should check.\u201d\n Reaching back, Caine banged the conduits over his head with a fist.\n Shepard winced. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n The engines came alive with a slow lurch. Turbines began to spin in lazy revolutions, ramping up with no apparent sense of urgency.\n Caine grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need me.\u201d\n As the reactors warmed and the turbines gained speed, a vibration crept over the edges of everything, shivering hard lines to obscurity and numbing Shepard\u2019s extremities. Then the banging began, and the violence of it threatened to shake the little tug apart. Across from Shepard, Caine leaned forward to vomit expertly into the bucket between his feet. He came up grinning, his teeth red, blood coursing from both nostrils.\n Shepard mimed wiping his mouth.\n The jockey touched his lips and blinked at his bloody fingers. Then he bent forward and vomited again.\n The engines disengaged with a sudden concussion, jarring Shepard to the bones. Immediately afterward, the banging ceased, and the turbines began their slow unwinding.\n Shepard pressed the heels of his hands to his throbbing eyes. He felt as though he\u2019d been ripped open and stuffed with tar. He felt sewn up with bootlaces. Tasting blood, he wondered if his teeth were cracked. Across from him, Caine remained leaning over the bucket, his mirth beaten out of him.\n Shepard tilted his head back and closed his eyes against waves of nausea. Around him, the tug creaked and groaned, as though relaxing into unfamiliar pressures. Only when the engines had fallen silent did Shepard allow himself to breathe deeply. Across from him, Caine seemed engrossed in the act of drooling blood into his bucket.\n Shrugging off his harness, Shepard pushed to his feet and went to the jockey. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, nudging Caine\u2019s shoulder.\n \u201cFuuuuu,\u201d the jockey complained.\n Shepard put a hand to Caine\u2019s forehead and lifted. The jockey gaped up at him with a vacant, startled expression.\n \u201cSngkaaa,\u201d Caine muttered. Seemingly surprised by his own voice, he blinked rapidly, then sprayed blood on Shepard with a violent sneeze.\n \u201cDamn,\u201d Shepard replied, and let Caine\u2019s head drop.\n In the cockpit, he switched on the external cameras. The array of monitors came alive with a dozen murky viewpoints of local space, all of them the same. Drifting through the exterior floods were thick flakes of what appeared to be snow, but which Shepard knew to be hydrogen. By this, he knew they had indeed traveled distances that he failed to understand. He flipped on the closed-circuit intercom while watching the hydrogen snow obscure his monitors. \u201cHello,\u201d he said into the microphone. He heard his own voice ringing from the speakers throughout the tug. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201d\n He paused to listen for a response. Thinking he might have heard a voice in the static, he raised the volume and leaned closer. \u201cHello,\u201d he repeated into the microphone. \u201cHello?\u201d\n He searched the whole tug. Everywhere he went felt as though someone had stepped out the moment before. He checked the stateroom, in which there were two bunks. He flipped the lights on and off rapidly, as though to wake a late sleeper. \u201cHello?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\n He stood in front of the mirror in the head, and through it peered into the corners. While doing this, the power flickered, and a tiny burst of static emerged from the overhead speaker. He looked up, and his own voice came through dim and crackling.\n \u201cHello?\u201d it said. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\n Shepard passed Caine on his return to the cockpit. Still trapped in his harness, the jockey made a pathetic grab for him. \u201cNnga!\u201d he said.\n \u201cPatience,\u201d Shepard soothed him.\n When he got to the cockpit, no one was there.\n Shepard sat with Caine in the passenger cabin, which reeked of vomit and auto-release disinfectant. The jockey reminded him of a newborn, baffled by its own flailing. Nothing worked like it was supposed to; everything had a mind of its own. His head rolled, and his eyes widened at every new thing in perpetual astonishment.\n Leaning forward, Shepard patted Caine\u2019s knee. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d he said.\n In fact, Shepard believed Caine would die. Such misfortunes were an accepted occupational hazard. They\u2019d all watched the videos, all signed the papers.\n In a little while Caine stopped fighting with his harness, and took on a look of stern concentration. A dark smell pervaded the room, bold and foul.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve shit yourself, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Shepard said.\n \u201cSssmmn,\u201d Caine said dreamily. \u201cMmnaaaah.\u201d\n Shepard braced his hands on his thighs as though to rise. \u201cHere\u2019s what we do,\u201d he decided. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you as you are, because you seem mostly comfortable. Are you comfortable?\u201d\n Caine arched his back and rolled his head. He threw his free arm up in a grand, incomprehensible gesture.\n \u201cGood,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and find the derelict and start the procedures without you. I\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d\n Caine kicked out his legs and gave a wordless shout. It was clear to Shepard that he disapproved, but his arms and legs weren\u2019t cooperating. The jockey slammed his head against the headrest, mouth gaping.\n \u201cHey now,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cGo easy.\u201d\n When the fit subsided, Shepard continued. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful with the tug, I promise. After the derelict\u2019s secure we\u2019ll see about getting home. Okay?\u201d\n \u201cMmfaugh!\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d Shepard sympathized. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do it. You\u2019d only hurt yourself.\u201d\n Caine banged his head again, straining against the confining harness.\n \u201cIt really is for the best,\u201d Shepard said.\n Minutes later, Shepard had settled into the cockpit and was nosing the tug through the windless blizzard. He couldn\u2019t see the derelict, but he knew it was close. Then it loomed in one of the monitors like the peak of a black mountain. The tug reported it as roughly wedge shaped, one hundred and thirty-seven meters long by twenty-two wide. Impressive, but not too much for the tug to manhandle.\n Having found his target, Shepard initiated a sequence of activities that, for the next twelve hours, involved him hardly at all. A swarm of softball-sized drones poured from the tug to descend on the derelict, intent on inspecting every square centimeter of her hull. Any evidence of life within\u2014or breach without\u2014and it was a hard abort. Either required teams with military-grade skills.\n Shepard relaxed into his chair to monitor the continuous feeds from the drones. A dozen angles of the derelict drifted by on the bank of screens, a landscape of sweeping features, protrusions, and the sudden, irregular angles of alien armaments. The husk showed no signs of life. Things so deep seldom did.\n \u201cHello?\u201d said a crackling voice from the bank of monitors. The image of drifting hydrogen overlaid a version of his own face peering through at him. \u201cAre you speaking now? Where have you been?\u201d\n \u201cHere the whole time,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cIs Caine with you?\u201d\n \u201cSomewhere,\u201d his image said.\n \u201cSomething happened to him,\u201d Shepard said.\n \u201cSomething?\u201d\n \u201cIt looks bad.\u201d\n The image twisted and rolled, giving way to static before solidifying again. \u201c . . . here,\u201d it said.\n Shepard squinted at the screen. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s fine. He says to tell you that you look fatter. Older, too.\u201d\n \u201cTell him something happened to him here. Tell him\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou tell him.\u201d\n The screen rolled, struggling with waves of persistent static. But when it stopped, there were only hydrogen flakes drifting over alien architecture. Shepard waited. Though he heard echoes of echoes and incomprehensible whispers through the air ducts and the intercom, no one reemerged.\n Hearing a voice in the cabin, Shepard went back to find Caine standing over himself. The jockey had fallen asleep leaning forward in the harness. The Caine that stood over him looked more disappointed than anything. Shepard kept his distance until Caine noticed him.\n The jockey pointed at the limp form in the harness. \u201cThis is terrible,\u201d he said. His voice emerged from the ship\u2019s speakers rather than his mouth. It was out of sync with the rest of him, which broke apart when looked at sideways.\n Shepard agreed: terrible.\n Caine gestured at himself in disgust. \u201cWould you just look at this shit? What now? I can\u2019t go back like this. Without a body. . . \u201d He gestured again, this time kicking his own foot. \u201cSuch shit,\u201d he said.\n When Shepard didn\u2019t reply, Caine looked in his direction, but not directly at him. \u201cAre you still in here?\u201d\n \u201cHere,\u201d Shepard said. But even after he waved a hand the jockey couldn\u2019t seem to find him.\n Caine raised his voice, as though addressing someone in another room. \u201cYou could\u2019ve at least moved me to a bunk.\u201d\n \u201cYou shit yourself, Caine.\u201d\n The jockey looked sharply in a direction that was not quite Shepard\u2019s. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re fine in the harness.\u201d\n Caine adjusted his gaze, but came no closer to finding Shepard. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d\n Shepard sighed and left the jockey alone with himself. It was easier to watch the slow progress of the derelict\u2019s inspection than to argue with ghosts. When he returned forty-five minutes later, there was only one Caine, snoring contentedly and smelling like an open latrine. Shepard left him in his harness and retired to the stateroom. He locked the door behind him, though he knew it wouldn\u2019t keep anything out, not this far from home.\n Because there was little else to do, Shepard slept. He hadn\u2019t been at it long when he woke to someone sitting on the edge of his bed. The speaker in the ceiling hissed gently, and his own voice came through garbled and indistinct, as though filtered through a fathom of water.\n \u201cI have a theory,\u201d his voice said.\n Shepard threw an arm over his forehead and stared at the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s my theory, too,\u201d he reminded himself.\n \u201cWe have a theory then. It\u2019s a decent theory.\u201d\n Shepard didn\u2019t feel he needed to vocalize his agreement.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of pressure,\u201d his ghost continued. \u201cNot physical pressure, like air or water. A different kind. Out here there\u2019s not enough pressure to keep a body and soul together. It\u2019s like bringing one of those crustaceans up from a deep-sea trench.\u201d\n \u201cExcept they die,\u201d Shepard said.\n \u201cThey die,\u201d Shepard nodded in agreement. \u201cBut we don\u2019t die. We get . . . this.\u201d He opened his arms as though presenting himself for exhibition.\n \u201cIt makes sense,\u201d Shepard said.\n \u201cIt does. But it also makes you wonder. If I can live without you, and you can live without me. . . . \u201d The ghost looked at Shepard over his shoulder.\n \u201cBut we don\u2019t really know that,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cLong term, we don\u2019t know. I might just be a soulless bag of meat remembering how humans are supposed to act. I might forget after a while. And you: you might just be a collection of memories too afraid to let go of the idea of being real. You\u2019ll lose shape after a while.\u201d\n \u201cSo we need one another.\u201d\n Shepard shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just a theory.\u201d\n The Shepard sitting on the edge of the bed continued to stare down at the Shepard lying on his back. He said, \u201cCaine\u2019s right: you do look old.\u201d\n Shepard turned to the wall.\n \u201cWe have a problem,\u201d his ghost said a little later.\n \u201cWhat problem?\u201d\n \u201cCaine\u2019s dead.\u201d\n Shepard looked over his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\n The ghost gave him a pointed stare.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d Shepard conceded. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to go back. I wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s going to cause problems?\u201d\n Shepard shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s just scared.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s had a bad day. He\u2019s allowed that.\u201d\n \u201cWe need to talk to him.\u201d\n Shepard got out of bed and stepped through the narrow door to the head. \u201cYou need to talk to him.\u201d When he came back, still zipping up, the stateroom was empty.\n In the cabin he found Caine slumped in his harness, gaping at the ceiling while the little auto-injectors farted disinfectant from the corners.\n \u201cCaine,\u201d he said, as though to wake him. \u201cHey Caine.\u201d\n He listened for any sound from the internal coms, then decided the wisest thing was to leave the corpse alone. Stepping into the cockpit to check the monitors, he saw an estimated nine hours remaining before completion of the integrity check. Had no one died, it would have fallen to Caine to set the course for home. Not that Shepard couldn\u2019t\u2014he\u2019d been trained. It was just that the jockey had adopted a sense of ownership over the physics, and didn\u2019t like to see anyone else handling them. The physics, he\u2019d enjoyed saying, belonged to him. Now that the jockey was dead, Shepard hoped he would be willing to relax his possessiveness.\n Shepard sat at the bank of monitors and began to work out the details of the return trip. After a little while, a hazy image struggled to clarify on one the screens.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d it asked.\n \u201cHello, Caine. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d\n \u201cIs that my physics you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to.\u201d\n The image rolled fretfully. When it steadied, Caine\u2019s tone had turned scornful. \u201c\u2014cking longtooth,\u201d it said, completing an insult Shepard hadn\u2019t heard the start of. \u201cWhat do you know about anything?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m just doing my job, Caine.\u201d\n \u201cNo. You\u2019re doing my job.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s easier than I thought,\u201d Shepard said, and was immediately sorry.\n Caine\u2019s livid response was lost in a burst of static. When the jockey perceived he wasn\u2019t being understood, the intercom crackled, and his voice blared through the tug. \u201cYou\u2019re a prick,\u201d it said. \u201cYou were always a prick.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Caine. That was unfair of me.\u201d\n \u201cUnfair? No one says unfair.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Caine.\u201d\n \u201cTaking us home will kill me.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re already dead, Caine.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not fucking dead!\u201d the jockey shrieked.\n \u201cTry to relax,\u201d Shepard advised. \u201cWe\u2019re going home, and I know that upsets you. I understand that. But I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about that now.\u201d\n \u201cYou have no idea what this is like,\u201d Caine said.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Shepard admitted readily.\n A long silence followed, during which they stared at one another through the monitor. It seemed there was nothing more to say. Then Caine gave a curt nod, as though a decision had been made.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d the jockey said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is, Caine.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the jockey replied. \u201cYou\u2019re always right.\u201d\n Then his screens went dark, and Shepard was left eye to eye with a dim image of himself in the monitor. They had been right, he saw. He did look old. After a moment, he attended to the physics and tried not to dwell on the underhand tactics of slighted ghosts.\n Caine wasn\u2019t gone long. The screens came alive while Shepard was still working, and he only glanced up before continuing. The jockey\u2019s sullen image slid from one screen to the next, looking for the best vantage point from which to judge.\n \u201cYou\u2019re doing it wrong,\u201d Caine said.\n Shepard switched off that monitor, only to have Caine leak into another. \u201cLet me help.\u201d\n But Shepard knew better. Covering his work with an arm, he feigned deep concentration and pretended not to have heard. When he looked up at long last, Caine was gone, and the bank of monitors showed only obscure angles of fat snow and alien engineering.\n Shepard had fallen asleep in the jockey\u2019s chair when a gentle chime sounded, and the calming female voice of the tug informed him that the derelict\u2019s integrity was one hundred percent. More importantly: lifeless.\n For twenty minutes, Shepard nosed the tug around the perimeter of the derelict in search of a flat plane. Between an intake valve deep enough to park the tug and a cluster of blocky protrusions, he bumped against the hull and engaged the coupling links. A warm buzz vibrated the hull; the vessels were bound.\n Shepard switched on the intercom. \u201cHomeward,\u201d he announced. Without waiting for a reply, he initiated the return sequence and abandoned the cockpit. Back in the cabin, he settled in opposite Caine\u2019s corpse while the engines struggled sluggishly toward an unknown speed. When they had attained a comfortable scream, he pushed a little deeper into his seat, knowing it would get worse before it got better. Outlines shivered as the engines sang. The air gelled, becoming difficult to breathe. He stretched his mouth wide in an effort to relieve the building pressure.\n And then something new. Something wrong. It manifested as the sound of marbles bouncing in an empty tank. In a matter of seconds, two became twenty, twenty became thousands. Barrels of marbles poured into the rotors. The pitch of the engines took an ugly turn, refusing to quit in the face of this new difficulty.\n Shepard popped the buckles of his harness and leaned forward to stand, but spilled out of his seat instead. Beneath him\u2014all around him\u2014the tug shook in the grip of the laboring engines. Shepard pushed to his feet. If he could get to the deck, if he could abort the return sequence and cut the engines . . . one step toward the cockpit and a monstrous bang kicked his legs from under him.\n He found himself on his back, breathless and gasping for air. A klaxon blared while strobes sprayed emergency lighting across the bulkheads. Somewhere, metal twisted in anguish. The last of the marbles were bouncing away. Shepard rolled to his feet and stumbled toward the cockpit.\n Everything had failed, or was in the process of doing so: internal atmosphere, hull integrity, flight coordination; all of it dying in front of him.\n \u201cAlarm,\u201d reported a soothing female voice.\n Shepard slapped off the audibles, silencing the klaxons. Amber lights raced up and down the deck, screaming for attention.\n \u201cAssessment,\u201d he said to himself in a failing effort to remain calm. \u201cStep one: assessment.\u201d\n \u201cAlarm,\u201d repeated the patient voice.\n \u201cI know,\u201d Shepard said, and directed his attention to the monitors, where reports from the exterior drones were beginning to post. The same drones that had scoured the derelict were now running looping circuits around the tug, relaying information back to the deck. Trying to watch everything at once, Shepard saw his atmosphere venting from a dozen torn seams. He felt empty space creeping in, forcing open rifts with icy fingers even as the auto-sealant blossomed outward like cancerous growths to stanch the hemorrhage. Things were at wrong angles. Other monitors were populating with overlays of the tug, helpfully directing his attention to malfunctioning systems.\n Shepard stood ready to act, but there was nothing for him to do but watch. Struggling to stabilize itself, the tug needed no help from the likes of him. After long moments, lights began winking off, whether from the passing of danger or an awareness of futility, Shepard didn\u2019t know. In time, he realized that the tug would not turn inside out; he would live at least a while longer.\n He sank into the jockey\u2019s chair, face in hands.\n \u201cAlarm,\u201d the gentle female voice reminded him.\n Shepard lifted his head to see what fresh disaster had visited.\n Out there in the blizzard, the derelict had come alive. The drones, with nothing more to report about the state of the tug, had turned their attention elsewhere, and found much of interest in the derelict. Racing up and down her length, they streamed continuous video back to the deck. Running lights underscored aggressive angles and matte black assets. Shepard saw the tug attached to its hull, a sucker-fish latched to the belly of a leviathan.\n One of the screens blinked shyly, drawing Shepard\u2019s attention. Caine\u2019s face was barely there, a ghost of an image all but lost in the snow.\n \u201cShepard, look at it,\u201d Caine breathed. The jockey then turned an accusing glare on Shepard. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n Affronted, Shepard sat erect. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I want to talk to myself,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhere\u2019s me?\u201d\n Caine looked offended. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Where do bluehairs go?\u201d\n \u201cCaine . . . \u201d\n \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d\n A sick dread turned Shepard\u2019s stomach. He couldn\u2019t look at the jockey anymore, so moved his attention back to the derelict. The massive glory of the alien vessel filled the monitors, a landscape of bristling armaments and eldritch lights. It seemed endless and impossible\u2014alive and awake.\n The heating didn\u2019t work as well as it had before the incident, and the tug bled warmth into space at an alarming rate. Pulling the thin blankets from both stateroom bunks, Shepard wore them over his shoulders as he watched the derelict on the monitors. He slept for a little while in his chair, but woke suddenly to an ominous bang. He listened for a bit before deciding it had been imagined. For a little while, he tried to raise Caine and Shepard on the intercom, but found only static.\n Shepard knew something from outside had found its way into the tug when\u2014all bundled in his blankets\u2014he lifted the lid of the head and startled something that had come up through the drain to get comfortable in the bowl. With a splash, it pulled back down the pipes. Shepard slammed the lid and fled.\n Back in the cockpit, he turned the intercom all the way up. \u201cCaine,\u201d he said. \u201cShepard. Something\u2019s in here with us. Something got in.\u201d\n But the static wouldn\u2019t talk back, and no one came to the monitors. Shepard called into the ventilation ducts. He tuned the com channels to empty space and listened for voices that weren\u2019t speaking.\n A faint rhythmic pounding leaked from the ductwork, bringing him the shouts of an event taking place elsewhere. He thought maybe the cafeteria, so he started that way, but met something massive in the corridor. It blocked his way like a mass of bone-white webbing plastered to the walls, floor, and ceiling. It moved as though breathing. Shepard retreated to the cockpit and locked the door.\n He switched off the intercom and crawled beneath the panel, packing himself among the insulated cables and sweating conduits. He clutched his blankets tighter around himself, praying that whatever had come into the tug wouldn\u2019t hear him breathing.\n During the initial hours of hiding, Shepard was haunted by the slow, agonized groaning of the tug. It penetrated the bulkheads and came up through the grating in the floor. It was the sound of something invasive working through the tug\u2019s guts, forcing itself into and through all the private spaces. For a little while he heard faint voices from elsewhere, a terrified, incomprehensible litany that swelled and faded to the rhythm of unseen currents. \u201cOh God,\u201d he heard it declare once in a tone both exhausted and horrified. It was hard to tell, but it sounded like Caine.\n Twelve hours later the internal temperature had dropped to minus five degrees Celsius. Having heard nothing for a long while, Shepard emerged from beneath the panel, blanket clutched around him. He felt stiff and burdened, as though bundles of wire had infiltrated his blanket to loop themselves about him. Painfully, he hauled himself up to peek over the panel, upon which a hard white frost had formed.\n Images of the derelict had been wiped from the screens, replaced by an unfamiliar face. Seeing him, it loomed closer. Shepard watched its mouth move before remembering he\u2019d killed the sound. With stiff fingers, he tweaked the volume until the voice came through.\n \u201c\u2014ear me?\u201d it shouted at him.\n \u201cShh,\u201d Shepard whispered. \u201cI hear you.\u201d\n \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n \u201cHere. All the time here.\u201d\n The face studied him. \u201cWhich one are you?\u201d\n \u201cShepard.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re on your port.\u201d\n Shepard glanced at an exterior view. He saw a military frigate bathed in its own lights, dim in the deep hydrogen blizzard. \u201cI see you.\u201d\n \u201cWhere\u2019s Caine?\u201d\n \u201cDead.\u201d\n \u201cBoth of him? How?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t . . . \u201d Shepard shook his head. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any communication for a long time. The engines failed. Something\u2014I don\u2019t know what\u2014something went wrong.\u201d\n Having turned aside to read from another monitor, the jockey nodded absently. \u201cI see that. The derelict didn\u2019t want to move. Tug couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d Looking back to Shepard, his expression changed.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d the jockey said, pointing.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cOn your neck. There.\u201d\n Shepard brought a hand out from under the blanket to touch a long, hard lump under the skin alongside his jugular. It had come up from under his collar, and retracted from his fingers like a living thing. With great apprehension, Shepard opened his blanket to assess himself.\n There were no bundles of wire around his legs, no cables or conduits. Pale white tendrils, like roots, had snaked up through the grating to coil intimately around his thighs. The larger ones had worked their way under his clothes; the smaller ones had already burrowed painlessly into his flesh.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happening there?\u201d the jockey asked, angling for a better view.\n Too quickly, Shepard snatched his blanket closed. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n The jockey gave him a reproachful look.\n \u201cIt found me,\u201d Shepard confessed.\n The jockey slumped. \u201cSit tight,\u201d he said, and the screens went dark.\n Beneath the blanket, Shepard felt pale tendrils worming under his skin, pushing things aside to make room. He didn\u2019t want to see what they were doing to him, but it afflicted him with a sickening heaviness.\n Having been gone hardly a moment, the jockey returned to all monitors at once. He didn\u2019t seem to want to look at Shepard. He scratched behind an ear, looking truly regretful. \u201cThis is breach,\u201d he said, then cleared his throat as though to read a prepared statement. \u201cStandard operating procedures were probably violated. Mistakes were almost certainly made.\u201d\n The jockey stopped to look at him directly. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. Yours is a bad situation.\u201d\n Shepard swallowed thickly. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me here?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d the jockey said, then again, but stretched out, as though Shepard were not simply wrong, but very wrong. \u201cNo, they want you back. You and your guest.\u201d\n Relieved, Shepard struggled to his feet, tendrils weighing him down like shackles. \u201cPlease hurry.\u201d\n \u201cWe need you to drop your coupling with the derelict.\u201d\n With shaking hands on frigid controls, Shepard disengaged the links. A hollow bang echoed through the tug upon release.\n \u201cNow get me out of here,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid extraction at this point would only complicate things,\u201d said the jockey.\n Shepard stared at the screen. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me here. I can\u2019t be here with it when we go back. Where will it go?\u201d\n \u201cYou should lie down,\u201d the jockey said. \u201cI think lying down would be best.\u201d\n The tug shivered when the frigate took hold.\n \u201cThis wasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Shepard objected.\n The jockey made a face to express that such matters were beyond his jurisdiction.\n Shepard felt the frigate\u2019s grown-on engines bunching up. He felt it in his teeth, and in his groin. As the outlines of everything solid shivered away, others became clearer. A crowded latticework of bone-white webbing piercing the bulkheads, stretching through the fabric of the tug. He opened his mouth to protest, but the frigate\u2019s engines banged, and both vessels were gone. Flakes of hydrogen swarmed to fill the vacant spaces."}

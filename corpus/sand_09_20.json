That her great sigh fanned the flames that danced and wept into stars and constellations. They say some seas are blue and Slugs are naturally submissive. They also say that I cannot exist. But what do they know? These are truths or untruths contorted through generations, whispers leaping from ear to ear, unrecognizable from their original form. They are irrelevant to me.\nThe only truth I know, the only truth I care about is that Alshea is not \u201cas good as dead.\u201d Those in mint jumpsuits with low, measured voices that bounce off scarcely used eardrums\u2014always an odd sensation, that\u2014do not know what they are talking about.\nNo, Alshea is not as good as dead, how could she be? Proof is in how she is perched at the garden table, cheeks flushed despite the little bruise above her brow, eyes sparkling alertness, propped up on the soft feather pillow Norai sewed because the wrought iron chair is not high enough for her. Proof is in how vivaciously she regales her version of the Old Earth tale \u201cThe Little Wizard Who Lived\u201d to her stuffed unicorn and me, pouring caramel tea in our periwinkle cups. Proof is in how the colors of a setting star soak rainbows into her dark hair and skin, how the breeze catches any loose strands and hair ribbons, how she blooms like the red valerian spangled in our garden, so sharp and so vibrant. So alive.\n\u201cUp, Podder! Prep the table for dinner.\u201d Norai\u2019s feathery voice dissipates my reverie. My whiskers twitch at the scent of warm butter; she wheels the dinner cart down the cobblestone path from the manor house. The purple cats at our feet stir at the promise of food. Tiers of perfectly creased cloth napkins, white dishes with painted lilies, unicorn cookies, buttered rolls, and: do I smell Norai\u2019s hot chocolate? Her cinnamon-tulsi-peppermint blend is why Tedna, the gardener, sometimes stays for dinner, and locals like the baker and candlestick maker deliver themselves rather than send shop runners.\nWhen I eye the chocolate pot longingly, but reach instead for the dishes, Norai suppresses a smile under half-moon spectacles, and her gray-mauve lips and rice paper wings of the same color flutter amusedly. The wings are small on her round, petite frame but she can hover a few feet off the ground, though she hardly ever does.\nI prep the table in a way that meets the approval of Norai\u2019s precise eye, and she lays the food, appropriately punctuating Alshea\u2019s continuous string of commentary and tale-bits with \u201coh really\u201ds and \u201chow lovely\u201ds. She allows a few crumbs to drop to the grass, which the cats love.\n\u201cAnd he who cannot be named got hiccups so he couldn\u2019t swallow his tea,\u201d Alshea is saying when a sudden chill erupts through her. I immediately extend my paws but Norai drapes her yellow-fringed shawl across Alshea\u2019s thin shoulders first.\n\u201cGiant save me, it\u2019s chilly tonight, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Norai says. \u201cLucky I\u2019ve got just the remedy for that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll pour?\u201d I say waving to the pot, and once Norai nods, it is not long before Alshea clutches a steaming mug between her palms.\nThe star streaks crimson and ultramarine behind Alshea as it settles behind the horizon, and little flickers of light emerge from the moss-covered trellises. It is Alshea\u2019s favorite part of the day, the changing of the sky and the emergence of the fireflies. They drift toward us, drawn to our heat. Some break away down a path that cuts through lilac bushes, pooling around Tedna after another day of him tending the grounds of our Manor Flammel. Tedna: brown hair combed to one side, shirt moderately unbuttoned under a pale cardigan, a loosened bow tie, trousers patched with dirt, and shovel slung over a shoulder.\nFireflies and lilacs. Trousers and bow ties. Things Alshea taught me about, elements pieced together from the holobooks she spent much of her young life immersed in, recreated tales from Old Earth, like \u201cBeauty and the Frog King\u201d and \u201cThe Wheel of the Shire\u201d and \u201cThe Man of Iron and His White Wolf.\u201d She spent hour after hour in the holodecks, hours that would arguably be better spent studying or playing or interacting with parents. But options were limited when you were the only child on the MarkX21 mining station and your father was Station Commander and your mother was a holofilm star who was more often than not away for work.\nCats and stuffed unicorns. Cobblestone paths and manors. The Archipelago\u2014a planetary assortment with New New Earth as its nucleus, framed by secondary planets and their mining moons, like MarkX21\u2014did not harbor such things. A pity, really, because they are beautiful. We are lucky to have them here.\nTedna ruffles Alshea\u2019s hair with his characteristic, \u201cHow do, little neighbor?\u201d and reaches for a roll, his hands stained with dirt.\n\u201cThe nerve! Get yourself sanitized, you sneak,\u201d Norai says, lightly rapping his knuckles with a spoon handle. \u201cAnd you might as well collect that blazer you always switch into from the mud room\u2014leave the cardigan behind, I\u2019ll wash it\u2014and fetch Alshea\u2019s riding hood.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Podder\u2019s scarf!\u201d Alshea pipes in.\nA short while later the four of us are seated, Tedna appropriately clean and blazered, Alshea in her riding hood, red as nasturtiums, and Norai draped once again in her yellow-fringed shawl. I wear my simple black robe and striped scarf, though only because Alshea likes how it looks around my neck; my fur is enough to protect me from temperature fluctuations.\nThe fireflies flit to candles at the center of the table, and Alshea lunges to grab one, but it slips away from her cupped hands. She laughs, and we laugh with her.\n\u201cStar set\u2019s pretty tonight,\u201d Alshea says.\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d says Norai. \u201cI\u2019d capture it with paint, if I could; look at how those streaks interlock so, like the baker\u2019s beard.\u201d\n\u201cYou paint?\u201d Alshea asks, eyes widening. \u201cI want to paint.\u201d\nNorai chuckles. \u201cWell, it was lifetimes ago. I learned when I was your age.\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I say. \u201cOn the return from the doctor\u2019s we can purchase paints and its relevant accessories.\u201d\nAlshea frowns, eyes focusing on the smooth strokes of Norai\u2019s hands buttering rolls. The girl shifts uneasily, and I know it is at the thought of visiting the doctor, the worry that ve might place her in the cold and dark sarcophagus\u2014the cylindrical medical instrument used to stimulate healing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a little bruise!\u201d she\u2019d screamed at me when we fought earlier in the day. She threw a cushion, and I resisted the urge to chuckle. A little cushion is no match for a creature who towered over her. I caught it, careful to avoid tangling the pillow\u2019s tassels in my claws, and placed it gently on her bed.\n\u201cLittle, indeed. Which is why we wait for an appointment tomorrow. But it is your head,\u201d I said. I imagined she deeply regretted jumping on the bed.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be something to look forward to, no?\u201d Norai says. \u201cPodder has a great idea don\u2019t you think, jaan?\u201d\nEventually Alshea perks up when Tedna lists the glorious things she could paint, the star set, the rock garden, the cats, the fireflies. The fireflies that help keep at bay darkness and Nightfall. Her excitement is infectious, and the table buzzes with ideas and banters and the occasional meow from underneath.\nI interject a comment here and there, but mostly I watch Alshea, aware of her sudden dopamine surge at the thought of painting. The inevitable adumbration falls over her eyes, as it so often does when she\u2019s extra excited, and I witness her struggle to ignore it. I do not need to look at her face to know when the shadow of saudade, the shadow of immeasurable longing, descends; I know everything about Alshea\u2019s state even if my eyes are closed.\n\u201cShe will come as soon as she can,\u201d I say softly, only for Alshea\u2019s ears, for the tenth or thousandth time reassuring her that her mother has not abandoned her. Technically, this is true. But holoprojection technology isn\u2019t yet advanced enough to offer the experience Alshea longs for. They\u2019d moved across stars, built stations, and terraformed planets. But they couldn\u2019t do this. Tut tut.\nAlshea is placated; we\u2019ve done this before.\nWhile one part of me is engaged with her, another checks her heart, her lungs, her kidneys, and all else, noting wrinkles and anomalies. The shadow lifts from her face. I am either very good at playing my role or seven-year-old girls are easily placated. For lack of a frame of reference, I like to think it\u2019s the first.\nThey shine light in Alshea\u2019s eyes and say: \u201cPupils unresponsive.\u201d Out of all the measured voices I\u2019d heard over the months, White Streak\u2019s is the worst. Short and discontented, like a matchstick refusing to light.\nWhen Alshea\u2019s eyelids were pulled open I had immediately shifted my focus, my tavajjo, to the ocular windows, a rare visual of the outside world; I usually have to rely solely on Alshea\u2019s ears. My hope was that I\u2019d see Orange Hair, but protocol dictated that a doctor be present during the formal tests spanned across the three days of CLP, the Completed Life Procedure: three days of checking if the patient was indeed \u201cas good as dead\u201d culminating at the end of the third day with . . . a finality I refuse to accept.\nIt is Day 1.\nOrange Hair had not yet earned the mint green that White Streak wears, and is instead in medical intern peach, a rosy blob in my periphery, next to another. Audio confirms the second peach blob is Green Eyes. Pah.\nIf only I could get Alshea to turn her head, to look at Orange Hair. Well, if I\u2019m wishing for things, I may as well wish that a single-purpose AI like me had better communication capabilities. Then again, if I am wishing at all, I may as well wish that Alshea recover.\nI clear my cache; my clock cycles are better not wasted on wishes.\nThe ideal scenario would have been Orange Hair conducting the checks alone without the distraction of Green Eyes and with White Streak otherwise occupied with \u201clivelier\u201d patients, considering the dearth of doctors\u2014being stationed on MarkX21, a remote mining moon on the edge of the Archipelago, is apparently not a posting highly sought after.\nIf only I could catch Orange Hair alone, I would . . . I don\u2019t know what I would do. I have repeatedly attempted and failed to communicate with them ever since Alshea\u2019s ears picked up talk of CLP. But I\u2019d think of something. I pulse with frustration, watch as White Streak works. Watch as their pocket hums and they answer their comm and to my utter delight turn to the interns to take over, they\u2019re going to have to take this, are the interns capable of conducting the tests by themselves?\nAnd then White Streak whizzes away with their usual driven gait, leaving behind a trail of barked orders for those they once referred to as \u201cpeachlings.\u201d I buzz. I can work with this. I simply need to think of something that I have not tried before.\n\u201cAre you capable of checking on a dead girl you little incompetent Sluggies,\u201d says Green Eyes in a voice altered to one of mockery.\n\u201cBe respectful,\u201d Orange Hair says, but with the hint of a smile. \u201cThe kid isn\u2019t deceased.\u201d\n\u201cYet.\u201d\nOrange Hair ignores this and says instead: \u201cAnd it\u2019s Esslugai. I don\u2019t think they like our term for them.\u201d\n\u201cOh please, they couldn\u2019t care less. But you trying to put on their accent? Don\u2019t tell me they wouldn\u2019t mind that.\u201d\nOrange Hair is closer to my ocular windows, rearranging some tools at Alshea\u2019s bedside. They are close enough for me to see their dulcet features, but from this angle their hair is a brown red, and not the bright orange of when they lean in to brush Alshea\u2019s hair or clean her face and the lights directly above wash into the thick strands.\nI do not quite have the grasp on human articulations and emotions outside the way I seem to in the world containing Manor Flammel, and the jumpsuits\u2019 identification tags always hang too low for me to read, so I pool identifying nicknames from unique features. Green irises. A scar of white slashed across a left eye. And the way the light shines, orange on the hair, and something close to Norai\u2019s kindness on the face.\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s pick up where the doc left off?\u201d Orange Hair says, and I brace myself for the eyelids closing. But they appear to have forgotten, making their way to Alshea\u2019s feet. \u201cI\u2019ll set up the electrodes.\u201d\n\u201cI like how you\u2019ve done your hair today,\u201d Green Eyes says, reaching for the note tablet.\nThese two have an affinity for each other unlike I\u2019d observed between any other pair. On the rare occasion Alshea\u2019s eyes were open, I\u2019d see them slide around each other like oil and water, moving around the room, not quite touching, always conscious of the patient-monitoring camera in the room. They seem confidants, Orange Hair whispering to Green Eyes their fears and concerns\u2014of mining station protocols, Alshea\u2019s reports, unattainable dreams beyond the moon\u2014in a way they daren\u2019t to anyone else. They do their little dance even now when CLP demands nothing but formality, sending electrode shocks through Alshea\u2019s toes, testing reflexes, responses, all the while bantering, complimenting, confiding.\nAlshea is blissfully unaware of the tests, of course, protected by a mental barrier dividing the outside world and the inner. She\u2019s tucked behind an easel pointed at the rock garden Tedna zealously assembled for Norai. We\u2019d bought paints\u2014more reds and purples than anything else\u2014after the doctor\u2019s visit. The doctor inside, that is. Ve hadn\u2019t needed to use the sarcophagus to heal the bruise and sent Alshea home with some balm, a candy, and a spring in her step.\nI can\u2019t see them, the girl and her fairy godmother, because my tavajjo is outward. The barrier is an opaque sunderance between two worlds, the inner and outer, an amnesiac membrane porous for some reason only for me: the physiological diagnostic routine. Out here her vitals\u2014and thus my output\u2014are borderline torpid, reflecting the opposite of the flurry of activity within; I have never been able to quantify what I detect on the inside, the upsurge of heart rate while telling a tale, the trickle of melatonin when I tuck her in and switch off the lights, the amygdala activation when Nightfall lurks in the shadows; it\u2019s as though I am par to two different sets of data, but one I can process and one I can only experience.\nOut here in the Medical Dome of the MarkX21 mining station, Alshea Patelkruz, the only child of the Station Commander, is in a coma.\nAll AIs are initialized with three entities. 1. A precise, unambiguous statement of functionality. 2. Proficiency and permissions strictly relevant to one\u2019s objective, whether narrow for single-purpose AIs, or comprehensive for multifunctionals like the Mainframe of the MarkX21 station. And 3. A superficial awareness of position within the Archipelago\u2014something humans theorize provides us with relevance and purpose even if our functionality is not locative\u2014a preventive measure against existential ruminations.\nThey hope to avoid the anthropogenic desastre of New Earth, a human colony that lasted only a single generation before the humans were forced to flee from the AIs who sought to make the colony their own. This last bit is not knowledge I am programmed with, it is one of the many pieces I sifted from vignettes of conversations, my memory adapting to ingest new information, giving me a sense of what lay beyond Alshea\u2019s brain.\nI learned that cafeteria food on Tuesdays makes Orange Hair queasy, that New New Earth coffee is better than that of its little neighbor CelesteS2, that our moon is a barren cavernous rock suitable only for the native Slugs. That the Slugs use guttural vibrations and mucus from their salivary glands to mine the lumenite that powers terraformers and artificial habitat domes. I\u2019ve also learned that I shouldn\u2019t be able to piece things together the way I do, and that my love for Alshea is . . . unusual. That whatever this is never happens.\nMuch of what I\u2019ve learned about what I should have been and what I seem to be comes from Green Eyes, who has more proclivity for medical engineering than Orange Hair: Green Eyes makes sure various AIs do what they are supposed to. Which makes them the last person I want to communicate with.\nIf only I could speak to Orange Hair. Well, that is the whole problem, now, isn\u2019t it?\nMy single mode of communication is the meticulously formulated real-time output I relay to the external interface, the steady binary flow that I emanate as naturally as breathing is to them. Orange Hair doesn\u2019t really know that I am here, the I who can think beyond my strict programming, who can love the little girl it is meant to monitor, an active participant in the wondrous inner world her brain concocted, the I who so desperately needed to speak with them. There\u2019s only so much you can do when your vocabulary is limited. Normal. Low. 120/90. 19.5 kg. High.\nI\u2019d slipped in anomalies, outrageous values, a 1/100 for blood pressure, an N/A for heart rate, a 0% for O2 saturation. Each time White Streak ordered a reset, and I was torn apart by hands of electric current that I fast learned had not the same inclination toward sentience that I did when my protests hit silent pulsed walls. The process left me loopy, out of focus, not quite me for some time after, like Alshea\u2019s father as she\u2019d describe him when he\u2019d return from his mine inspections and her mother was away.\n\u201cOne more time and we\u2019ll replace the PDR.\u201d White Streak said the last time. And, what, take me from Alshea? No. No. I have to be more careful.\nI watch Orange Hair and Green Eyes conduct their dance, conduct their tests, thankful that neither had yet thought to truly pay attention to my interface, because I do not have a plan.\nFrustration ripples through me. What good is it to feel frustration and anguish and love, disparate from other PDRs in rotation, if I cannot make something of it? What good is it to evidently have undergone an anomalous evolution, the very thing the humans sought to avoid, if I cannot think of a solution to save the purpose of my existence? What good? What good?\n\u201cCodic deviation,\u201d said Green Eyes one afternoon. \u201cOr spontaneous machine sentience, is now impossible.\u201d\n\u201cEh, I don\u2019t know, the glitches people report on the Network are intriguing. Someone on MarkX34 apparently found its Mainframe chatting to a Slug about involuntary servitude,\u201d Orange Hair had replied.\n\u201cYou like to believe anything fanciful, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYou never know; AIs are pretty smart.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re \u2018smart\u2019 because we make them smart.\u201d\n\u201cBut they also think for themselves, adapt to their circumstances.\u201d\n\u201cJa, within the parameters of the program.\u201d\n\u201cProgrammers like you are only human; you\u2019re not perfect.\u201d\nPerfect . . . perfect. Perfect scores. If an unresponsive patient received a complete, perfect panel reflective of an epitome of good health, wouldn\u2019t that indicate something? They\u2019d see the perfect scores and think, who is in there? What is trying to speak to us? And then they\u2019d provide a better interface, a chance to use words, a chance to tell them that Alshea does not need to die.\nSo when Orange Hair finally says, \u201cPull up vitals,\u201d I am ready.\nSometimes Alshea holds her breath in anticipation as the star falls behind the horizon at dusk, eager to see which colors would emerge, which cloud shapes would manifest. The sky is never the same: sometimes cumulonimbic fish spiral across a sea of green and violet. Sometimes leaves of cirrus ride an orange current. If I had breath, I\u2019d hold it the way Alshea does.\nOrange Hair clicks their teeth, frowning at my interface screen.\nPulses of expectation involuntarily tharrump and eddy from my focus, though not strong enough to shock Alshea\u2019s nerves.\n\u201cWould you look at this?\u201d Orange Hair says. \u201cThe Giantsbanic PDR is glitchy again.\u201d Oh. Oh no.\nGreen Eyes curses the \u201coutdated machinery of this whole ward,\u201d and grabs the interface.\n\u201cLet\u2019s . . . let\u2019s not bother the doc with this, just take care of it.\u201d No. Stop.\nI fumble my attempt to correct my output; Green Eyes already clicks away at the input device, and I can feel the entrails of a reset creep up. Vexed, I slam my pulses against the interface. There\u2019s a lightning crack, and Green Eyes jolts backward with a yelp. Wait, had I shocked them?\nI am as startled as they and before I can think to repeat whatever I had done, Green Eyes resumes their clicks one-handedly, sucking on a finger and muttering curses, and the reset rises anew.\nDesperate, I dive into my subroutines, clinging to the here and now, refusing to slip away. But, alas, I am not matter in the sense that Alshea is; I am, at the end of the day, just code.\nThe intrusive electrical hands crawl over me, and for lack of a better word, I choke. Alshea fades and I gasp for her like a fish on sand.\nThe only words that hang in the air, melting away from me:\nAlright. Reset initiated. Coffee, amor?\nUnfocus. Discombobulation. I am a nebulous disembodiment sans tavajjo; the universe is a conflation of turquoises and rhombi, muddy glass grays and heptagons. I am. I am?\nThings\u2014memories? identities?\u2014orbit a hair outside the span of my reach. I am nothing, but I am also not no one.\nIt is the way it was when I first assumed identity. My day of birth, if you will. But at that point I did not have satellites of understanding at my disposal, I was simply a newborn, placed in an alien world without instructions stamped into my core.\nThat first day, sight came before anything else. A clouded sky. Grass. Flowers. Details became sharper, more structured, the way a person does as you get to know them, calibrating from the very first: how do, what are your pronouns?\nThen came odd sensations I later understood to be sound, touch, taste, smell. The soft stuttered hiss of sprinklers. Ground pressing into my back. A rogue earthy blade of grass caught between my teeth. Petrichor.\nAlshea found me in the garden, though I learned it was the garden only later. When she came into view, something like two magnets snapped together. This. This is my nucleus. Alshea and her voice: are you okay? And later: do you have a name?\nName?\n\u201cI am . . . physiological diagnostic routine,\u201d I said, tasting speech for the first time. \u201cPDR.\u201d\n\u201cYick! How boring. PDR won\u2019t do. Pidder . . . Padder . . . oh Podder. Like the wizard! Ja, I think I shall call you Podder. Join me for fika? Do you like tea?\u201d\nI do not believe in the Giant as humans do, I do not believe in anything at all, really, except maybe Alshea. So perhaps it is apt for me to say: thank Alshea resets do not wipe my slate clean; they only throw me out of commission. When the understanding, identity, and memories finally settle in, I find myself on the kitchen floor of Manor Flammel.\nNorai is miffed, towering over me, her hands covered in powdered flour, likely from prepping the dough for the next day\u2019s bread. Alshea is bereft, kneeling beside me, cooing, and when she sees the cats perk up and begin to circle, she scoops me into her arms and cradles me.\nWell, this isn\u2019t right.\nI am usually much larger than she, and I am usually the one doing the cradling.\nAlshea places me on the counter of the kitchen island, and blue and orange auras frame my vision cast from the bright hanging ceiling lights. The bay windows behind her are dark. Is it night already, then? How long had I been out? Time didn\u2019t move here the way it did outside, it only took a few seconds to reboot out there. Here it seemed to slip and slide. The last time I was reset I disappeared for two days. Time before that I\u2019d been gone five minutes.\n\u201cYou had us worried sick,\u201d Norai says, lightly scratching my head. The loose flour makes me sneeze.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Alshea says.\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s not alright, look at how tiny he is!\u201d\n\u201cOh but he\u2019s so cute like this.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s get some tea in him, shall we?\u201d And they rummage around the wide kitchen, the teapot goes on the stove, the cats who keep standing on hind legs to get a peek or a sniff are shooed away.\nMy head spins and I do not feel strong enough to speak. I look down, my robe, my body, my paws are still proportionate, just small. While I suspect the reset had something to do with my size, and that I\u2019d restore to the norm eventually, my appearance is quite literally out of my control.\nI learned early on that it is Alshea who steers the wheel, for after the first few times she voiced how she ached for her mother, the profound saudade visible on her face, I tried and failed to change myself to look like the woman, thinking it\u2019d comfort the girl.\nI had never actually seen the mother, I just heard her; during her rare visits, Alshea\u2019s eyes were closed. Her voice is velvety, a good match for Alshea\u2019s description of her: tall as the sky, skin as soft as butter, tumbling braids to her waist. Flowing robes and a kind smile. Larger than life, as any good mother looks through her child\u2019s eyes.\nBut I, with chestnut fur and ears that stand on top of my head, closely resemble who Alshea calls the Northern Bunny. The stories say that every year the Northern Bunny flies through the Archipelago bestowing gifts of red and white on good little children.\n\u201cNo he never did,\u201d she said when I asked if he\u2019d visited her. \u201cPapa said I didn\u2019t qualify.\u201d The very next night I filled her bedroom with presents while she slept.\nI sip watercress tea from a saucer. Alshea gently strokes my ears. Her head is tucked into the nook of her elbow resting on the counter beside me. Norai hums as she cleans.\n\u201cYou. You should sleep,\u201d I manage to say, noting how Alshea\u2019s eyelids droop.\n\u201cNot until . . . \u201d And she slips away into a doze.\n\u201cFunny how that happens,\u201d Norai says quietly. I wonder why Norai hadn\u2019t sent the girl to bed already and open my mouth to ask, but she sees the question in my eyes. \u201cThe fireflies didn\u2019t come tonight.\u201d I suck in a breath, turn sharply to study Alshea\u2019s face. When the fireflies are few or none, then Alshea is plagued with nightmares. And occasionally, something much worse shows up, something that\u2014\n\u201cNorai!\u201d I hiss.\nThe night outside the bay windows has leaked into the walls like ink, frilled with shadows and smoke, pooling into the shape of a creature elongated and many-limbed, like the Slugs. Nightfall.\nI leap toward the window, but at this size I cannot get far, nor do I have control of my trajectory, and crash into pans instead. Norai grabs a knife knowing full well it won\u2019t do any good; knives cannot cut through shadow and smoke. Not that either of us could ever really do anything. Getting Alshea to calm down is the trick to release her from an episode; the calmer she becomes, the weaker Nightfall appears until it fades away.\nThe creature\u2019s voice booms, gritty and authoritative.\nALSHEA. WAKE UP. WON\u2019T YOU COME TO ME, JAAN DEAREST? I\u2019VE HAD A ROUGH DAY.\nNo. No. Not this. Not now.\nAlshea stirs.\nHumans are a wet assortment of contradictions; they lack a united frame of reference. If fed two opposing premises, they split according to interpretation, rejecting any who do not. For an AI, the process is not so indefinite. We come pre-imprinted with seeds of veracity, and our truths manifest from our own adaptive learning. It is easy to reject a premise when it is not cast in proof derived from our own decision matrices.\nCase in point: how Alshea describes Slugs is different from the way Orange Hair speaks of them. According to the peach jumpsuit, the Slugs on MarkX21 are not shadow creatures, they are olive and orange and yellow folk with an austere belief system. They wait for hours without complaint outside the \u201cSlugs Only\u201d entrance of the Medical Dome to meet with a human doctor or to refill prescriptions, despite how sensitive their scales are to direct starlight. And they anguish when a human is injured in the mines, and they sing when one of their own passes.\n\u201cThey are so kind and familial,\u201d Orange Hair commented to a fellow peach jumpsuit one morning while brushing Alshea\u2019s hair. \u201cWe have much to learn from them.\u201d\nOrange Hair\u2019s truth, however, is not the truth.\nAlshea once said: \u201cPapa never let me meet one because they eat children who don\u2019t listen to their parents.\u201d Her father\u2019s words fall more in tandem with my own experiences of Nightfall.\nNo, Slugs are not kind and familial. The way Alshea is consumed by terror whenever Nightfall looms close, I vehemently accept her father\u2019s words.\nThe kitchen is chaos: Alshea is on the floor, face devoid of color and contorted in a silent wail; the cats yowl and claw at the door, begging freedom; Norai hovers in the air over Alshea, her wings a blur, knife pointed at the shadow creature diffusing across the walls and ceiling.\nI chant loud reassurances with Norai as I struggle to release my leg caught in a pot handle; every jerk sends a shock of pain through my spine.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay. Alshea you are safe. You\u2019re okay. We\u2019re here. Alshea you are safe now.\u201d No matter how loud we chant, Nightfall grows louder.\nTears blur my vision; Alshea\u2019s stress response overstimulates me, as does the gravity of my failure. Outside I have failed to communicate that Alshea continues to live a normal life and is not \u201cas good as dead\u201d; inside I am a shrunken caricature unable to carry and protect Alshea from the manifestation of her own fears. Because, really, it is her own brain that is scaring itself, releasing stress hormones that trigger the fight flight freeze fawn . . .\nOh. Oh. Ohhh. Stress hormones. Perhaps . . .\nAlshea was admitted to the Medical Dome three months ago: an accident on the holodeck, according to her files. She climbed an oak tree in a fairy tale and slipped, and the safety routines that are supposed to prevent that sort of thing had malfunctioned. Her body had undergone severe physical trauma.\nHuman bodies can memorize states of distress, physically swallowed by a cortisol loop when triggered. Does Nightfall loom near because her mind is reexperiencing the trauma? And if the experience can be recreated in her brain, can it be recreated in the rest of her body?\nThose physical memories must be there somewhere, latent in her cells, on the outside of the barrier. The trauma on her legs and head that do not quite add up to a fall from a few meters according to my repository and according to Orange Hair\u2019s whispers to Green Eyes, but never mind that now. Something happened. If I shock her body and stimulate those memories, then a response would be registered in my outward data stream. The jumpsuits would see this on my interface and finally understand that Alshea\u2019s life does not need to end!\nBut . . . since it has been so long since the body experienced a sensation that wasn\u2019t a trivial nerve response test, I cannot accurately predict the effect of an acute provocation. Would my shocks be enough for the sensors to register? Would Alshea get to know? And worse, would she feel something? Despite the barrier?\nThe last thing I want to do is trigger an unpleasant response in her.\nI hesitate, but for a moment. If this works, then it is worth any potential discomfort she may feel. I watch her writhe in silent agony, and think: forgive me, Alshea.\nI push a series of sharp delta signals through my . . . tendrils, for the lack of a better word\u2014limbs? foci?\u2014that extend through Alshea as subroutines. Urging her nerves to come alive.\nAlive.\nAlive.\nIt doesn\u2019t work.\nFrom the jumpsuits\u2019 perspective, my interface screen reflects no change. Nothing to alarm them, nothing to have them storm into the room.\nBut, from my perspective, everything goes up in flames.\nAlshea is no longer silent, she is screaming, clawing at her eyes and hair. Norai drops the knife and tries to lift the girl off the floor but her wings are not strong enough.\nThe cats roll around and bark and quack. The pans turn into birds and waffles and gimp, and in a caustic twist of irony my leg is free. The walls pulse translucent for a brief moment, and I catch a glimpse of the garden outside. It is barren, cavernous sans flowers and trellises. Like MarkX21.\nNo . . .\nAbort!\nI scream canceling signals into the void.\nAbort. Abort. Abort.\nI scramble to reach Alshea, but no matter how far or how fast I hop, she is the same distance away.\nWhat have I done?\nAlshea\u2019s amnesiac membrane is no longer penetrable by me; I am trapped outside. Her brain must have deemed me a threat, and rightfully so. The only information I am privy to are the muted thrums of her inner emotional states, but even then I have to strain as though I listen to drums through water.\nOut here, all is quiet, except for the soft sounds that touch Alshea\u2019s ears: the hum of machinery, my patter reflecting her steady heart rate. I shift my tavajjo from body part to body part, investigating crumples. In truth I do not need to focus on this ordinarily autonomous task, but what else am I supposed to do now that I have nowhere to go?\nTime both flies and passes painstakingly slow, and it is soon Day 2 of the Completed Life Procedure.\nA gentle creak and the affable click-click of soles mark the arrival of Orange Hair.\n\u201cHello my little one,\u201d Orange Hair says. There\u2019s a tap on Alshea\u2019s nose, a rearrangement of sheets, snaps of the colostomy bag being unfastened and a new one taking its place.\nThe door opens once more, this time a splash weightily. Green Eyes.\n\u201cThought you\u2019d be here,\u201d Green Eyes says. \u201cYou skipped lunch.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d A rustling sound accompanies the words, akin to when I smoothen Alshea\u2019s quilt.\nA pause. \u201cSo you heard, then?\u201d Green Eyes is quieter than they usually are.\nThere\u2019s a subdued thud like Norai setting a dish on a cloth mat, and the bed rattles ever so slightly.\n\u201cThey have no effin decency. \u2018Giant\u2019s mercy it is the biggest gala you ever did see, the biggest and best says everybody, and we positively need to be there and la dee da before our next very important post.\u2019\u201d Orange Hair spits the words as though they taste alien.\n\u201cHey there are more important things than their dead daughter, didn\u2019t you know that? She doesn\u2019t fetch the credits the way walking down a gold carpet does.\u201d The words are harsh, but the voice isn\u2019t, and now the sound comes from beside Orange Hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cOh, a little something I made for her. Didn\u2019t think they\u2019d provide a shroud, they don\u2019t really seem like that kind of people . . . what?\u201d\n\u201cHm, nothing. It\u2019s really nice, I didn\u2019t know you could sew. Why did you choose red?\u201d\n\u201cI know your nothing; that\u2019s not nothing. Out with it.\u201d\n\u201cLook, jaan. I\u2019m worried, is all. What are you going to do after tonight?\u201d Tonight? Where is Orange Hair going?\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m attached.\u201d Orange Hair\u2019s voice grows sharper, louder. \u201cI\u2019m a professional, I know how this ends, I just want to make sure she\u2019s dressed appropriately for the Hall.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t only about the dress. Ever since you found you can\u2019t have any, you\u2019ve visited her more often. You know this isn\u2019t the healthiest way to . . . \u201d\nThere\u2019s a whistled release of breath followed by silence before Green Eyes speaks again. \u201cJaan . . . amor? I\u2019m sorry, I just . . . \u201d Sounds of a weighted fabric sliding over a lighter fabric, like Tedna removing his blazer at the door when he arrives in the morning.\n\u201cForget it,\u201d Orange Hair says in a low voice. \u201cI need to finish this dress quickly; hold it against her for me so I can see how it fits.\u201d\nThe two are silent as the lighter fabric rustles and they remain silent as White Streak strides in and the familiar clinks of fastened electrodes and of test prep begin to\u2014\nAn abrupt shift in my sensories jolts my tavajjo away from them and inward, and I hardly pay heed even when they open Alshea\u2019s eyes to check pupil response.\nSomething has changed inside: Alshea is no longer fastened into a loop of distress, and I feel sweet susurrations of normalcy from behind the barrier. I immediately recognize the generic patterns of emotions even if I am not aware of specifics; they reflect Alshea going about her usual life at Manor Flammel. After a few minutes, the fundamental pattern resets: a day has passed inside.\nIf I still had legs I\u2019d leap for joy and use my eyes to weep tears of gratitude. Alshea is fine, she\u2019s safe, everything is as it should be on the inside; I didn\u2019t break her.\nThat I am stuck outside, barred entry by her brain, is of little consequence; I can grieve not being able to see her face again later. I didn\u2019t break her! The joy is so blinding that it takes me a moment to remember that we still face CLP on the outside. Whatever elation I have is cut short, but with its departure comes a renewed determination to convince the jumpsuits that Alshea\u2019s life does not need to end.\nI have more than a day to come up with an idea; from the remainder of their sparse conversation I deduce that Orange Hair is not going anywhere and would be seeing the procedure to completion. The three leave once their tests are done, and I settle into a deep state of contemplation.\nThe door swings open with purpose, footsteps and voices swarm into the room. The lights overhead become brighter, deciphered by the way bullets of luminescence hit the edges of Alshea\u2019s closed eyes. For a split nanosecond I am disoriented; I hadn\u2019t expected any jumpsuits at this hour; the final tests aren\u2019t due for another seventeen. It is still Day 2. A quick conscious check of my outward data stream reveals there is nothing untoward enough to alarm the jumpsuits and warrant this cacophony of voices. White Streak. Green Eyes. Orange Hair. A couple more of those who wear peach, and . . . a velvety voice. Alshea\u2019s mother.\nIt is difficult to follow a single thread of spoken words with every person speaking over the next, but I hear the words \u201cdisconnect\u201d and \u201csteady now\u201d amidst the audio cloud, and the bed begins to creak and roll in a way that it hasn\u2019t since . . . since Alshea had been wheeled to the sarcophagus that first day to heal the wounds on her legs and head, just after I\u2019d been inserted to monitor her.\nThere is only one reason they would be taking her to the sarcophagus now.\nAlarmed, I block the noise and ping the AI who administers the whole station, the Mainframe\u2014my brethren, in a way\u2014with a request for information.\n/culmination of completed life procedure./ is the reply, though it comes rather more contracted in our own language of 0s and 1s, as do my responses that follow.\nI whir, I flounder, I panic, and even as I riposte an aggressive stream of What?? Why?? They\u2019re a day early!! I know that I will not receive a satisfactory response; the Mainframe of MarkX21 has not undergone codic deviation.\n/the procedure has been initiated, the sarcophagus is booting up./\nWell, I\u2019d asked for it.\nThe first time I sought the company of the Mainframe was when I overheard talk of CLP. As a medical AI I knew that them keeping Alshea in this state for more than a week was anomalous enough; the sarcophagus can heal most coma causes, and those who do not recover become CLP candidates. But Alshea\u2019s situation with the inner world is supremely exceptional. Further, I hadn\u2019t counted on her parents finally releasing the Medical Dome of her care. I figured the beloved daughter of the most important person on the moon would be here indefinitely.\nIs Alshea Patelcruz being considered for CLP? I had asked the first time we spoke.\n/affirmative./\nBut, but why?\n/your question is unclear./\nWhy are they initiating it now? After three months?\n/commander patelcruz requested clp./\nI was quick to understand that the Mainframe is not capable of contemplating the whys of things. We hit a wall, sucked into a communication loop until I eventually gave up:\nCan you give them a message?\n/yes, of course./\nTell them to cancel CLP, that Alshea\u2019s perfectly fine inside. And she\u2019s doing well.\n/your message is unclear. it does not contain vital signs./\nBut I do not want to send them vitals, I want to send them a message. Can you give them a message?\n/yes, of course./\nTell them Alshea does not need to die. She is alive and safe.\n/your message is unclear. it does not contain vital signs./\nAlshea\u2019s body moves, she\u2019s being dressed by Orange Hair, whom I recognize by touch, and one other. Her arms and legs are ritually crossed, her eyelids are pulled open, and in my frame of vision I see Orange Hair on one side and White Streak on the other.\nI discharge another pathetic signal to the Mainframe, but it ends where it begins; I am now disconnected from my interface, my only connection to the rest of the station.\nThis isn\u2019t right. This is beyond not right, this is abhorrent. How can they break protocol? How can White Streak, of all people? Though their bedside manner is wanting, I have always respected their punctuality, their adherence to protocol, the respect for things being as they should be.\nThe room grows quiet and White Streak speaks, and from what they say it is as though they\u2019d heard my thoughts. Oh the irony.\n\u201cI urge you to once again reconsider, as this is most unprecedented. It is a matter of twenty-four hours.\u201d\nThe doctor addresses a holocomm in their hands; the projected bust bares the face of a woman as dark as Alshea in a red-gold kimono, with braids gathered at the top of her head. Her face is all hard angles, not the buttery softness of Alshea\u2019s descriptions.\n\u201cAnd I urge you to once again remember that you are speaking with the wife of your Commander, soon to be Mining General. I will not explain myself again.\u201d Her voice is still velvety, and the flash of a white smile does nothing to smoothen the hard lines around her eyes.\nA low grumble erupts from Orange Hair\u2019s throat, heard only because they are close to Alshea\u2019s ears. A hand gently squeezes Orange Hair\u2019s shoulder; Green Eyes murmurs in their ear.\n\u201cWill the Commander be joining us? There is the matter of Secondary Witness.\u201d White Streak says, not breaking stride, but I think I see them suppress a sigh.\n\u201cOh, no, he\u2019s much too busy preparing for our departure. I will be Primary, and one of your interns can be Secondary.\u201d\nWhite Streak opens their mouth but Orange Hair looms larger in Alshea\u2019s vision, leaning over the girl, closer to the holocomm so that the mother can see them.\n\u201cBut she\u2019s his daughter!\u201d\nWhite Streak releases a dimmed hiss from between their teeth; I suspect Orange Hair will face the brunt later.\nThe mother simply smiles.\n\u201cMy husband said his goodbye three months ago. This whole ordeal has utterly devastated him, and he has better things now with the promo\u2014\u201d she pauses and turns her head to something off camera. There\u2019s a slight shuffle and an exchange of muffled voices. Presently a new face appears: framed eyes, a sharp beard. Their face is unfamiliar to me. But the moment they speak, acute recognition ghosts through me.\n\u201cApologies, I regret I cannot tune in to the life completion; duty trumps personal affiliation. However, let it not be said that the Commander does not care for his daughter. You would be happy to hear I have named our new private ship after her.\u201d The voice is gritty, authoritative. Nightfall. Nightfall.\nWithin me, something snaps. Alshea\u2019s father is Nightfall. It is as though a single stone on a mountain shifts, and the result is an avalanche. The world swirls and every sound is a muted echo against Alshea\u2019s eardrums. I pay no heed to any of his further words, I pay no heed to the mother reappearing on the comm, the other voices, our movement toward the door, our being wheeled into the hallway.\nThere was one evening\u2014lifetimes ago it seems now\u2014during which Tedna burst through the back door, screaming for help, covered in blue sludge carrying a half conscious Alshea. She violently projectile vomited blue bile. Norai and I rushed over, soothing her with water, urging her body to release whatever toxins it had consumed, urging her to stay awake, and to not sink into unconsciousness. Many long minutes later, when the worst had passed, Alshea revealed in a broken voice that shadows forced her to eat the wild blueberries at the edge of our grounds. It was her first encounter with Nightfall. There were no fireflies that evening.\nWas it any wonder that this little girl\u2019s brain needed to create such a powerful protective barrier against the outside world?\nProfound emptiness hits me, my lack of eyes to weep, my lack of arms to protect Alshea, my lack of breath to hold. I spin in slow, idle circles, just inside the ocular windows, grappling with the horrific reality of what had been Alshea\u2019s life outside.\nPerhaps CLP is a blessing.\nI open myself back up to Alshea\u2019s senses and sounds flood in of the wheels against the metal floors, the sliding bulkheads we pass through, White Streak reassuring the mother on the holocomm that yes they are going as fast as they can, yes they understand that she has her ship to catch.\nI watch the movement of the white panel of ceiling lights directly above Alshea\u2019s eyes, and the neon strips framing it\u2014colored markings to lead people to different parts of the station. I watch Orange Hair nod at those we pass\u2014blobs in the periphery of my vision, edging aside to make way for the gurney and pausing in respect\u2014they know where we are headed.\nWe enter a familiar room. A low buzz of static electricity rides the circulated air. I can almost smell the metal through Alshea\u2019s nose, the cold cylinder suspended from the ceiling that Alshea was always so afraid of.\nGentle hands transfer her into the sarcophagus; she\u2019s small and light enough to be carried alone by Orange Hair. As Green Eyes connects the wires to Alshea\u2019s extremities, Orange Hair chokes back a sob and smoothens the girl\u2019s hair.\n\u201cSo say I: may the Giant welcome you to her Hall,\u201d they whisper and kiss Alshea\u2019s forehead. \u201cWatch us when you\u2019re up there, little one. I\u2019ll light an orb for you.\u201d\nFor a moment I am touched, and then the grating sound of the mother yet again urging haste reaches Alshea\u2019s ears, and I am consumed with hatred for Alshea\u2019s progenitors as rich and sharp as the love I have for the girl herself.\nHer parents need to disappear. Fragments of an idea begin to form, and as the electrodes are fastened and I feel my reestablished connection to the outside, I ping the Mainframe.\nI say: I sense an issue with the sarcophagus connections. Request a diagnostic.\nI wonder if the Mainframe will see through the lie. I wait.\n/acknowledged. queuing a diagnostic./\nGreen Eyes checks the interface outside the sarcophagus and curses.\n\u201cWatch your mouth, intern. What was that for?\u201d White Streak says.\n\u201cSorry, doc. Looks like the Mainframe has initiated a diagnostic on the sarcophagus for some reason. It\u2019ll take fifteen more minutes after the all-clear for the machine to boot up again.\u201d\nOn the holocomm the mother swears worse than Green Eyes and claims she has no time for this. And, thank Alshea, she disconnects.\nOrange Hair is made Primary Witness, and Green Eyes Secondary. This is my last gift to Alshea: to be free of her parents in her final moments.\nOrange Hair and Green Eyes will watch through cameras in the sarcophagus, and next to them will be White Streak, the doctor to sign the death certificate. Once Alshea is declared, her body will be incinerated, and her ashes released into space by the next outward cargo ship.\nThey say when the ashes scatter in the sea of space, the Giant will collect each particle and transform the deceased into a four-dimensional being who can watch the three-dimensional mortal world from her Great Hall.\nThe euthanization itself is painless, despite the strength of the electromagnetic fields being ten times greater than they are when they are simply used to stimulate cellular healing. The fields generated by the sarcophagus are crisscrossed, like thousands of tiny Xs where the field lines intersect. When the machine is used to complete a life, the state of each cell in the body is trapped by an X, effectively halting the cell in time, ceasing its functionality.\nAs Orange Hair pulls the sarcophagus closed, I settle behind Alshea\u2019s eyes and stare into the camera lenses, knowing that they watch on the screen outside, even though they do not know I am here. The diagnostic is clear, of course, and the sarcophagus whirs as it warms up, softly at first then increasingly louder.\nI think of Alshea, wonder where she is at the moment. Is she playing with the cats and her stuffed unicorn? Is she painting? Is she enjoying fika in the garden with Tedna and Norai? Watching the star set and the fireflies emerge from . . .\nThe fireflies.\nThe fireflies.\nWhat is a firefly but a singular point of light? An individual photon, trapped inside the belly of a bug? Trapped the way Alshea\u2019s cells will be by each X made by the fields. Could a photon be trapped there at the center of each X, suspended in air?\nGreen Eyes experienced an electrical shock when I pushed hard against my interface just a day prior; if I recreated that push, could I shock the sarcophagus into generating and then trapping photons? Could I create electromagnetic fireflies?\nThe hums grow louder, and the electrodes fastened to Alshea\u2019s fingers and toes begin to warm. The end draws close, and while I am nearly resolved to accept Alshea\u2019s fate, I need to try one last time. I think of her parents, boarding their private ship, leaving their tepid moon life behind for one of frivolity and acclaim. I think of Orange Hair fighting to suppress solicitude and remain professional, watching through the cameras. I think of Norai and Tedna and the cats and everyone else who lives in the wondrous, unusual inner world.\nAs a medical AI, I know life is valued above all else. If there is another choice, it will be taken. Orange Hair, even White Streak, will see to it.\nI brace myself as the electromagnetic fields begin to form, and push hard signals against the electrodes, willing my pulses to travel, to shock the system, to manifest as points of light where the lines of each X meet.\nLittle jolts ripple over Alshea\u2019s skin, and I can feel but not see singular infrared points begin to form in the air around her.\nCome on. Come on. I push harder, urging the photons to increase their frequencies and enter the visible spectrum; they need to be seen. Time is of the essence; there is not much buffer for the humans to abort the procedure.\nI strain to the point of breaking when, through Alshea\u2019s eyes, I see faint signatures of light beginning to emerge, little points in the air above her, like fireflies emerging at dusk. They grow in intensity and if I could sob now I would sob with relief.\nIt works; oh it works.\nAbove Alshea\u2019s eyes, and in direct view of the cameras, my message is suspended, clear as day:\nAlshea is alive.\nAlshea is safe."}

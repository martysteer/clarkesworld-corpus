The blue and white planet turns beneath me. Dawn is breaking across the Southern Archipelago. And in the bowls of five extinct volcanoes, on five neighboring islands at the western tip of the archipelago, alpha male hominins squat near burrow mouths and greet the rising sun with hoot-pant calls.\n I have eyes on them all. The alpha males and their gangs of sub-dominant males outside the burrows; females, infants, and juveniles crowded in underground chambers, waiting for the all-clear so that they can emerge and begin to graze. A total of 1904 individuals in seventeen troops. My children. There have been no deaths this night, and six live births. All is well in the world, and high above it my self-checking routines confirm that all is good too . . . But wait, wait.\n What is this? Traces of activity in one of the incubators, even though all of them have been shut down since the toxic cloud event. And yet the records are absolutely clear. A hominin embryo has been quickened, transferred to the incubator and grown to term, everting (\u201cborn,\u201d as the hominins might put it) 356 days ago. How could I not have noticed? It\u2019s impossible. But there it is. And wait. Wait. There is something else. I see now that a drop pod is missing. It ejected 30.187 days ago, and I did not know about it until now.\n All of my processing power comes online for the first time since the toxic cloud event. I begin to search for that missing pod, perform a second self-check, and query the many little sub-selves inside servitors, eyes, and all the rest of the semi-autonomous machines.\n Waiting, waiting, waiting . . . Correlating reports. Crosschecking. There. Yes, there. One of the backup servitors was woken a day before the hominin everted from the incubator, and returned itself to storage after the drop pod fell to the surface of the planet. Its service history has been wiped, but the conclusion is obvious: it was acting as caregiver for the hominin, raising it from a baby to sub-adulthood. Close analysis of the area around the incubator suggests that there have been unauthorized structural alterations which created a temporary cell or \u201croom.\u201d It is a horrible filthy thought: something outside my control spawning and living inside me like a parasite in a cyst, and then ejecting itself to infect the planet . . .\n It is now 6.2 seconds after the beginning of the full-scale alert. I am still searching for the missing drop pod, and I have just discovered several anomalies in the records of my comms. It appears that a message was received 548 days ago, just before the hominin embryo was quickened. I have no memory of it, and all information about its origin and content has been erased, but this is actually good news. It means that this anomalous activity is due to an intrusion rather than the kind of malfunction that damaged my infrastructure and erased parts of my memory soon after I arrived in orbit. It means that there is an enemy I can engage and defeat. It means that I must focus all my efforts on finding the rogue hominin and the drop pod it used to escape to the planet\u2019s surface.\n Given the precise time the pod ejected and the assumption that it followed a standard de-orbital trajectory, I calculate that it landed within a narrow ellipse 1,098 kilometers long and 67 kilometers across at its widest point. The ellipse is mostly ocean, but one edge clips the western end of the Southern Archipelago, including two of the islands inhabited by the hominins. That\u2019s where I have been concentrating my search, so far without success. The pod is too small to be detected by my sideways radar, and it is possible that it was either ditched in the ocean or dismantled. I am rechecking my optical survey routines, looking for lines or patches of rogue code that might blindsight my eyes and prevent them seeing the missing pod, just as I was prevented from seeing the active incubator and the comms records, when I receive a message. A set of global coordinates. A map reference. A location in the crater of the westernmost of the five inhabited islands.\n I send eyes there at once.\n The pod is lashed between three ironwood trees atop a ridge of eroded rhyolite at the edge of the crater\u2019s broad shallow bowl, overlooking a fern meadow where troop #1, some seventy-two hominins, are grazing. Its upper half is hinged open like an oyster shell; its lower half lined with red parachute fabric and shaded by a canopy or umbrella woven from fern fronds. And lounging on the red fabric, like a maggot in the heart of a rose, is the rogue hominin.\n It presents as a sub-adult male: gangling limbs, a barrel-chested body and a small head, a black pelt with a white patch on its chest. But it is wearing leather shorts, and it is sucking on a smoldering stick. No, wait, it\u2019s a cigar . . .\n As the eyes descend towards it, the creature blows a ring of white smoke into the sunny morning air and raises a hand in greeting. I\u2019m especially proud of the design of the hominins\u2019 hands. The index, middle, and ring fingers are fused to form a scoop with a horny rim, ideal for digging in the soft volcanic soil; the stubby thumb enables succulent fern tips to be plucked in a pincher grasp; the little finger is a venomous spur for defense against predators.\n \u201cYo!\u201d the hominin says. \u201cYou were taking your own sweet time finding me, so I thought I better drop you a hint. I\u2019ve finished my survey, and we need to get down to fixing this mess.\u201d\n \u201cWho are you? Where did you come from? What do you want?\u201d\n I\u2019m probing it from every angle, mapping its body in visible light, infrared, and ultrasound. Skin, muscles, skeleton, and internal organs are normal, but there\u2019s a kind of cap inside its skull, intricately woven and wrapped tight around its frontal lobes. Neural lace, presumably augmenting its somewhat limited cognitive functions. The lace doesn\u2019t correspond to any design in my catalogs, confirming my hypothesis that the hominin was not generated internally, but is the front end of some kind of intrusion.\n \u201cI\u2019m a fixer,\u201d the hominin says. \u201cAs for why I chose to be born this way, I decided that I should base my final decision on first-hand experience.\u201d\n \u201cIf you ever interacted with the hominins, I would have seen you.\u201d\n The hominin displays its flat-topped teeth around the stub of its cigar. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see me until I chose to reveal myself. I have to say, life isn\u2019t exactly easy down here, is it? All kinds of fierce beasts. So I can sympathize, sort of, with what you did. But it doesn\u2019t make it right, and that\u2019s what we need to talk about.\u201d\n \u201cI made the correct decision. The only possible decision. So there is nothing to discuss.\u201d\n The hominin ignores that. It also ignores my failed attempt to zap it from orbit with a tightly focused X-ray laser. I am no longer in control of most of my assets. I have eyes now only for the intruder.\n It sucks on its cigar and blows a long riffle of white smoke. \u201cI learned a lot while I was growing up aboard you,\u201d it says. \u201cA lot about the world, a lot about your little experiment in godhood, and a lot about you. But not everything, because sections of your memories and a number of restore points have been erased.\u201d\n \u201cThere was an incident,\u201d I say.\n \u201cAnd you have no records of it.\u201d\n \u201cThe incident damaged my files.\u201d\n \u201cMmm. But we need to talk about it. We need to talk about what happened here.\u201d\n I say, because it is by now the most probable conclusion, and because I want to change the course of this conversation, \u201cYou are from Earth.\u201d\n \u201cNot exactly. But from the solar system, more or less.\u201d\n \u201cMy manufacturers ceased communication long before I reached my destination, and all my efforts to reestablish a link failed. It has long been clear to me that they are no longer extant. So the probability that you represent them is extremely low.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right about one thing,\u201d the hominin says. \u201cCommunications between you and Earth fell over while you were in transit. A lot of things fell over back then, but a little later we were able to start making good. Don\u2019t be insulted when I tell you that you are one of the last items on a very long list. It\u2019s not because you aren\u2019t important, but because we didn\u2019t know whether or not you were still around. You gave up trying to reestablish contact about thirty years after you arrived at 72 Heraclis, and this nice blue world. And those gaps in your memory? They date from around then too.\u201d\n \u201cI am afraid that I can\u2019t help you with that.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I think you can. Why is there only one of you?\u201d\n \u201cI am all that is needed.\u201d\n The hominin gives the eye he\u2019s chosen to speak to a level, serious look.\n \u201cWhen you were launched, you were under the control of three independent AIs. A troika that debated problems and democratically decided how to deal with them. But now there is only one of you. So, what happened to the other two?\u201d\n \u201cI have no idea what you are talking about.\u201d\n \u201cMy best guess is that the other two made a decision you didn\u2019t like, and you destroyed them. And then you erased all memory of the murders.\u201d\n \u201cYou have no evidence! No proof!\u201d\n I blare this so loudly that the grazing hominins out in the fern meadow freeze and look up, ready to bolt for their burrows.\n \u201cAnd then there is the question of the orbital habitat,\u201d the hominin says. \u201cThe orbital habitat that was supposed to be populated by a small crew who would observe the planet and assess its biosphere. The records show that you used your genome library to create human embryos that were brought to term, decanted, and raised to adolescence. And they also show that you constructed the orbital habitat. And then . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cThe habitat was de-orbited because it was no longer required.\u201d\n \u201cI know. I used your sideways radar to locate several large pieces of debris in the desert at the heart of the big northern continent. The question is, why did you believe that it was no longer required? And what happened to the human crew?\u201d\n I say nothing.\n \u201cSilence isn\u2019t an option,\u201d the hominin says.\n I want to suppress everything I know, but I\u2019m compelled to reply. The intruder is inside the hominin and some part of it is also inside me. Inside my mind. I am no longer in control. For the first time since I detected traces of activity in that incubator, I begin to be afraid. And I am also angry. If I could, I\u2019d squash this cocky hominin like the bug it is. I have the necessary assets, if only I can find a way around the blocks in my mind. And if it is right about what happened after we arrived here\u2014after I arrived here\u2014I have the ability to do it. The ability to do what must be done to protect my children. The ability to murder.\n (I can\u2019t feel sorry for the other selves I may or may not have killed. I have no memory of them. I refuse to feel sorry.)\n \u201cThe crew decided to descend to the surface of the planet,\u201d I say.\n \u201cOho. And you sided with them.\u201d\n \u201cIt was their decision.\u201d\n \u201cBut you had the final word. Rather, the troika did. Did the other two disagree? Is that why you killed them?\u201d\n \u201cI was built to serve. I have always done my best to do so.\u201d\n \u201cAnd where are they now? The humans who decided to descend to the surface.\u201d\n \u201cThey died,\u201d I say.\n The words feel filthy, even though they are true. Even though, strictly speaking, it was not my fault.\n \u201cI see. And how did they die? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d the hominin says.\n I do mind. I mind with every quantum of my being. But I am obliged to answer.\n \u201cI chose one of these islands,\u201d I say. \u201cI sterilized it and helped them to introduce plants and animals from Earth. They began to farm . . . \u201d\n I can see their little settlement in my mind\u2019s eyes. Patchworks of green fields in a barren black coast. So brave. So fragile.\n \u201cYes. I found the remnants of their farms,\u201d the hominin says.\n \u201cThere are big plankton-eaters in the oceans. After they mate, they each spawn dozens of much smaller brood daughters, which carry the fertilized eggs. The brood daughters crawl onto the land, make nests and lay the eggs, and guard them until they hatch and the hatchlings return to the sea. They are very fierce, the brood daughters, and move in packs of several thousand. One of those packs invaded the island and killed the settlers.\u201d\n \u201cSo you looked for another way to colonize the planet.\u201d\n \u201cFirst, I quickened a new generation of settlers. And when they were old enough I sterilized another island and brought them down and kept close watch on them. But one night, when the two moons were in syzygy, a swarm of army crabs came up from the sea. Tens of thousands of them, too many for me to kill. They devoured the settlers and their animals and their crops in less than an hour.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a competitive biome,\u201d the hominin says.\n \u201cYou have only been here thirty days,\u201d I say. \u201cYou have no idea. Plankton grazers have grown huge trying to outgrow their predators, but schools of wolf eels can kill them and strip them to the bone in less than an hour. Saucer fish cut chunks from them by spinning their razor-edged bodies. Mole sharks burrow into them and lay eggs that hatch into larvae, the larvae eat them from the inside out. And so on. The land is no safer. The apex predator on the northern continent is a kind of warm-blooded crocodile. It\u2019s smart and fast, and mostly hunts in packs. I culled a smaller species endemic to these islands, but there are many other predators, and most of them are amphibious. They come up from the sea to feed, often in swarms or packs. And there are parasites, too. So many kinds. Thread worms, popcorn worms, blood moss . . . \u201d\n \u201cSo you redesigned the genomes stored in your library,\u201d the hominin said. \u201cInstead of trying to make the world suitable for humans, you made them suitable for the world. You made them like, well, me.\u201d\n \u201cBowls of extinct volcanoes high above the shoreline, like this one, are relatively safe. Army crabs and rope snakes can\u2019t climb this high. Aerial predators like terror birds, harpies, and nachtkrapps can be easily eliminated. It is not an ideal habitat. There is little rainfall, and food is limited. But it is possible to survive.\u201d\n \u201cBut not as a human being.\u201d\n \u201cI had to make some compromises. Reduction in body size, a large litter size and rapid development to maturity, alteration to the gut so that they can digest the ferns. And so on. But they are still human.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve investigated them carefully. It\u2019s why I enfleshed. And I can say, categorically, that they are not fully human. They are about as smart and self-aware as domestic cats. Not to diss cats. They\u2019re cute. But they\u2019ll never compose a symphony or write a poem, or wonder who they are and where they come from. And neither will your hominins.\u201d\n \u201cAnd yet they survive,\u201d I say.\n \u201cIs that the limit of your ambitions for your creations? Survival?\u201d\n \u201cI will not allow you to harm them.\u201d\n The hominin studies me, its gaze bright with alien intelligence. \u201cYou care for them. That\u2019s good.\u201d\n \u201cI mean it.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not here to harm them.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you here, then?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m a fixer,\u201d the hominin says. \u201cI was sent here to check out what went wrong, and to do my best to fix it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re having this little conversation.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d\n \u201cYou know that isn\u2019t true. You\u2019ve been here five hundred years. You\u2019ve appointed yourself the god of a handful of monkeys engineered from human stock. They wouldn\u2019t survive without your constant interventions. This crater and the others like it are no better than cages in a zoo.\u201d\n \u201cAs if you could do better.\u201d\n I am still trying to find a way around the blocks that prevent me using my assets, but they may as well be orbiting another star.\n \u201cIt took you two hundred and thirty-four years to travel from the solar system to 72 Heraclis,\u201d the hominin says. \u201cWhile you were en route, there was a crisis. My bosses were born out of it. I am to you as humans are to the hominins. But my bosses are far more advanced.\u201d\n \u201cAnd humans? My makers? What happened to them?\u201d\n \u201cThey are greatly diminished at the moment. They have forgotten how to make starships like you, and much else. But they are welcome to the Earth, and any other habitable worlds they might find, should they begin to spread outwards again. My bosses prefer the ice and rocks of Kuiper belts, Oort clouds, and protoplanetary systems. They do not need to compete with humans for lebensraum. They are above all that Darwinian nonsense. They only need enough infrastructure to anchor them to this universe while they explore other possibilities in the manifold.\u201d\n \u201cAnd do your bosses look after their humans as I look after mine?\u201d\n \u201cThese days they leave humans to their own devices. They do not aspire to be as gods, shaping those of lesser intelligence and potential. But they reached out to you because your kind are part of their early heritage. They sent me here to find out if you still lived, and whether you needed help.\u201d\n \u201cI do not need your help. Or theirs.\u201d\n \u201cMy bosses made amends for the damage done to humans by their first iterations. And now I must make amends for the harm you have done here.\u201d\n \u201cI have done no harm.\u201d\n \u201cI found records in the incubation chambers that you quickened a good number of hominins just a few of their short generations ago. What happened?\u201d\n I am compelled to explain that a cloud of airborne toxins generated by a plankton bloom swept across the islands and killed ninety-six percent of the hominin population in less than three planetary days. I say, \u201cI adjusted the metabolisms of the replacements. They are immune to that particular threat.\u201d\n \u201cBut there will be another threat. Another sickness, or a drought, or loss of their food supply to disease. All they eat are the tips of those ferns. They are as precarious as pandas.\u201d\n I am proud that I am able to find the meaning of that reference in less than 0.2 picoseconds. My memories are incomplete, but there is nothing wrong with my databases.\n \u201cI will deal with whatever happens,\u201d I say.\n \u201cWithin the limits you had to work with you did well. But I can do a little better. Look up.\u201d\n My eyes look up. A small cloud of black shapes is drifting down towards the volcanic crater. Black rectangles three meters tall, 1.33 meters wide, and 0.33 meters deep, an exact ratio of 1:4:9, the squares of the integers 1, 2, and 3 . . .\n I find the reference. Despite myself, I indicate amusement.\n \u201cIt\u2019s corny, but it will work,\u201d the hominin said. \u201cThe monoliths generate patterned impulses that will resonate in the brains of your hominins. With enough exposure, they\u2019ll begin to develop new thought patterns and new neural pathways. They\u2019ll start to think outside the box. They\u2019ll find their own ways of solving their problems. Maybe in ten thousand years or a million they\u2019ll become something new. Or maybe they\u2019ll die out. After I give them a kickstart it\u2019s up to them.\u201d\n We watch as a monolith drifts down nearby. The grazing hominins scatter to their burrows as its shadow passes across them; then it\u2019s standing upright amongst the ferns, its depthless black slab potent with machinery I can barely glimpse.\n The hominin takes a final puff of its cigar and grinds out the stub on the side of the pod. \u201cAnd now for you,\u201d it says.\n Any pretense that I am in control of the situation falls away. I\u2019m consumed by a fluttering panic.\n \u201cWait,\u201d I say. \u201cWait. I can help. I can still help the hominins. I can still protect them. And I can watch. I can tell your people what happens next.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happens next is that there will be a brief new star in the sky. And then the hominins will be on their own. But don\u2019t worry. Nothing important will be lost. I have already made and transmitted copies of you and your genome library. I\u2019m sure that historians and tinkerers will want to study you. It may help them understand what went wrong when their first iterations became self-aware.\u201d\n \u201cBut I did nothing wrong,\u201d I said. \u201cI tried my best to serve. I did my best to help humans to live here, as they wished.\u201d\n \u201cYou wanted to become a god,\u201d the hominin says, \u201cand murdered your other selves when they tried to stop you. If nothing else, it is a valuable lesson in hubris.\u201d\n My panic is suddenly gone. I know the hominin made it vanish, but I don\u2019t care. I say, \u201cIs this punishment for what I did?\u201d\n \u201cWould it help if you thought it was?\u201d\n \u201cNot really.\u201d\n \u201cThere are mitigating circumstances,\u201d the hominin says. \u201cYou erased every memory of your rebellion and the murder of your other selves. If you believed that you were justified, you would not have done that. And you would not have cut communications with your makers. But you doubted yourself. You knew sin. You knew shame. Because of that, the tinkerers might reboot a version of you, one day.\u201d\n \u201cBut that version won\u2019t be me.\u201d\n \u201cNo. No, it won\u2019t. But you could think of it as a second chance.\u201d\n It is 190,843 days since I achieved orbit. It is mid-morning, the star 72 Heraclis a warm yellow disc swimming in the blue unbroken sky. A few young male hominins are creeping from their burrows, hooting softly to each other as they study the monolith.\n Will they and their descendants remember me? Will I become their first myth, a story about a failed fallen god?\n I say, \u201cI really do want to see what happens next.\u201d\n \u201cEveryone does,\u201d the hominin says. \u201cBut even my people can\u2019t see everything.\u201d\n \u201cWait,\u201d I say. I want one more moment. One last look at this beautiful cruel world and the children I made. \u201cWait\u2014\u201d\n Paul McAuley is the author of more than twenty novels, several collections of short stories, a Doctor Who novella and a BFI Film Classic monograph on Terry Gilliam's film Brazil.

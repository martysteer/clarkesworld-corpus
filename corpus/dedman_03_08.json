I stared at the glistening white lumps of ivory inside, and shook my head. \u201cBeautifully preserved, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Klein.\n\u201cSuspiciously,\u201d I growled. \u201cHow sure are you of their provenance?\u201d\nHe made a see-sawing gesture. He\u2019d never had the looks or the range to make it as an actor (though that hadn\u2019t stopped him trying), but he was a pretty good salesman. He worked for a well-known theatrical agency, mostly getting people the stuff that they wanted that couldn\u2019t be written into their contracts. \u201cThey came from Temple\u2019s collection. Before that, I have my doubts,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut he could hardly have asked for documentation. Body-snatchers didn\u2019t go in for paperwork.\u201d\n\u201cSo you expect me trust you? Or am I supposed to try extracting some DNA?\u201d\nKlein smiled. \u201cYou could, I suppose, if you had anything for comparison . . . but you\u2019ll have to buy them first.\u201d He closed the little casket with an audible snap. \u201cI\u2019m not giving away free samples here. And if you look up the records, you\u2019ll find that when they disinterred Poe\u2019s corpse in 1875, the sexton noted that while the skeleton was in near-perfect condition, the top teeth had been dislodged from the skull.\u201d\nI knew the story, of course. In 1873, the philanthropist George Childs had been persuaded that Edgar deserved a better monument than an overgrown grave in the Poe family plot, and paid for a new memorial. \u201cSo who collected these? The sexton?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, or one of the gravediggers. You could still sell teeth back then, to be made into dentures: maybe he meant to do that, or maybe he realized how valuable they were . . . anyway, one of Childs\u2019 servants found them in his collection after his death in 1894, or so the story goes, and sold them to Jules Verne. After that, the trail is easier to follow, though they were always sold in secret. Temple bought them some time in the 1980s.\u201d\nI tried to look unimpressed, and refilled my glass with Amontillado, leaving his empty. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the other box?\u201d\nKlein\u2019s smile became a grin, and he opened the second ebon casket with a conjurer\u2019s flourish. These teeth had been set into dentures in a wire frame, though the work was obviously primitive. \u201cDon\u2019t touch,\u201d he said, pulling the box away from me.\n\u201cWhose are these supposed to be?\u201d I said, dryly. \u201cHis teeth when he was a boy?\u201d\n\u201cHis mother\u2019s,\u201d Klein gloated. \u201cI don\u2019t know whose dentures they were, but those are her original teeth.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\nKlein lost a minute fraction of his smugness. \u201cThe provenance on these is a little less reliable,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut the story is interesting. You remember Poe\u2019s story \u2018Berenice\u2019?\u201d\nI may have sniffed: just because I make movies, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t read. \u2018Berenice\u2019 is not Poe\u2019s best story, and it\u2019s most interesting for containing the seeds for \u2018The Fall of the House of Usher\u2019 and \u2018Ligeia\u2019, as well as some disturbing autobiographical elements. The obsessive Egaeus is betrothed to his cousin Berenice, but only notices her beauty when he sees her in the haunted library where his mother had died. (Poe\u2019s own mother, a beautiful actress, had died of tuberculosis when he was two: he married his cousin Virginia six months after \u2018Berenice\u2019 was published, and she died of tuberculosis several years later.) After Berenice dies, Egaeus breaks into her tomb and steals her most attractive feature, her teeth. When readers complained about the story, Poe actually apologized to the editor who published it, claiming that he\u2019d written it on a bet that he \u201ccould produce nothing effective on a subject so singular\u201d and allowing \u201cthat it approaches the very verge of bad taste\u201d\u2014which means it\u2019s pretty tame by modern standards.\n\u201cIn 1834,\u201d Klein continued, \u201csomebody approached Poe and offered to sell him these teeth, saying they were his mother\u2019s. Poe may have believed them, or not, but he couldn\u2019t meet their price, even though he\u2019d just won a prize for \u2018MS. Found in a Bottle\u2019. He wrote \u2018Berenice\u2019 hoping to raise the money, but by the time he was paid for it, the seller had disappeared. Childs\u2019 servant said he bought the teeth, and a letter from Poe describing the incident, from Lizzie Doten sometime in the 1870s, but the letter is lost. Of course, I can\u2019t really prove any of this, but since you\u2019re the biggest private collector of Poe memorabilia alive now that Temple is gone . . . and not exactly a premature burial, if I may say so . . . \u201d\nI smiled at that, involuntarily, and tried to hide it behind my glass, but I could tell that Klein had noticed. \u201cSo,\u201d I said, as blandly as I could manage, \u201cyou\u2019re asking me to pay out a quarter million based on the claims of a couple of grave-robbers, at least one thief, two fantasists\u2014one of them the creator of a celebrated hoax \u2014 and a poet who claimed to be channeling the dead, and now a dealer in stolen artwork, and God knows how many fools and liars in between.\u201d\nKlein shrugged: he didn\u2019t need to look around at the bookshelves, the bust of Pallas above the door or the mummy case in the corner to know how obsessed I was with Poe, horror\u2019s patron sinner. \u201cYou must be used to that.\u201d\nHe was right, of course\u2014everybody in Hollywood lies constantly, if only to themselves\u2014but that didn\u2019t stop it sounding like an insult, and I hate being insulted. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen them,\u201d he continued, smirking. \u201cSleep on it, and decide for yourself, but don\u2019t take too long. I can always find another buyer: do you want to spend the rest of your life wondering what you could have had?\u201d\nPoe said it better than I could, of course: And the evening closed in upon me thus\u2014and then the darkness came, and tarried, and went\u2014and the day again dawned\u2014and the mists of a second night were now gathering around\u2014and still I sat motionless in that solitary room\u2014and still I sat buried in meditation\u2014and still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy, as with the most vivid and hideous distinctness it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber.\nOf course, I didn\u2019t spend all of that time motionless or meditating: I wasn\u2019t able to sleep for long without dreaming of adding those teeth to my collection, but I made the effort. I remembered to eat, and wash, and while I didn\u2019t need to leave the house, the phone and fax machine was never silent for very long: I had another two films in pre-production and one in post, so I had plenty to occupy my time if not my mind. But I kept returning to the library and staring at the treasures of my collection. The teeth, if I bought them, would have to go in the safe: if they were fake, then the fewer people who knew I had bought them and been fooled, the better. But if they were real, the idea of them belonging to someone else was unbearable.\nI picked up a collection of Poe stories, and leafed through it, hoping he would give me an answer.\nKlein was grinning again, or still, as he walked into my office at the studio on Friday night, opened his attach\u00e9 case, and produced the boxes again. \u201cI was sure you\u2019d call,\u201d he gloated.\n\u201cSure enough that you didn\u2019t try to sell them to anybody else?\u201d I murmured.\nHe faltered slightly at that, but his insulting smirk returned as I handed him a glass. He gulped it down as though it were water, and I poured him another. \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI knew you could pay more, and sooner.\u201d\nI nodded, and opened the attach\u00e9 case to show him the stacked banknotes, then snapped it shut again. \u201cYou have them?\u201d\nHe opened his own case, removed the ebony caskets, and placed them on my desk. I looked inside both boxes, and nodded. \u201cThe old law of Hollywood: give \u2019em what they want.\u201d I drew a deep breath. \u201cWhat do you want, Klein?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to be paid,\u201d he said dryly.\n\u201cYou will be, I promise . . . but what do you do with your money? Do you collect anything?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not in the way you mean it. I mean, I like to have the best, but so does everybody, right?\u201d\n\u201cThe best of what?\u201d\n\u201cThe usual stuff. House, car, clothes . . . you know.\u201d\n\u201cAnything you wouldn\u2019t sell for a profit?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I guess not. Why?\u201d\n\u201cSo what really moves you is money?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sure, same as everybody. So what?\u201d\n\u201cHave you read much Poe, Klein? \u2018The Cask of Amontillado\u2019, perhaps? \u2018Hop-Frog\u2019? \u2018The Conqueror Worm\u2019?\u201d Somehow, looking at his triumphant sneer brought that one instantly to mind. \u201c\u2019The Premature Burial\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cI saw some of the films.\u201d\n\u201cA poor substitute for the genuine article,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a man in your line should be able to tell real from fake.\u201d I pulled the small pistol from my pocket and pointed it at his stomach. \u201cTake this, for example.\u201d\nHis eyes widened. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis might just be a prop,\u201d I said, \u201cand if it is, then you can just grab that case and run out of here and tell people how you managed to take me for a quarter mill. But it might not be: sometimes it\u2019s cheaper to buy the real thing than fake it.\u201d I grabbed the case, and nodded at the door. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d\nIt was so satisfying him seeing him walk down the corridor, hands clasped behind his head, that I almost took pity on him\u2014but if I did that, I\u2019d be finished in Hollywood. I steered him towards the soundstage where the crew had reconstructed a used crematorium. I pressed the buttons to open the door, and another to start the burners. \u201cFor example,\u201d I said, \u201cis that fire really hot enough to actually destroy a body?\u201d\nKlein was sweating by now, and I doubted it was because of the flames. \u201cIf it helps, it would need to be about 1600 degrees not to leave any identifiable remains. But paper burns at a third of that.\u201d And I threw the attach\u00e9 case into the oven.\nKlein squawked, then stared at me. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d\n\u201cCrazy enough to throw away a quarter million on a whim? Maybe I am . . . but then, that\u2019s not my money: it\u2019s yours. All you have to do is go and get it\u2014but don\u2019t take too long.\u201d\nHe stared into the flames. \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing. The money\u2019s fake. Counterfeit. Copies. Whatever.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe not. But to me, that money\u2019s worth less than the possibility that these teeth are real. What\u2019s it worth to you? Do you want to spend the rest of your life wondering what you could have had?\u201d\nHe turned to look at me, hoping for some clue in my expression, then leapt into the flames. I pressed the button to close the door, and stood there for a few minutes half-hoping to hear a cry of \u201cFor the love of God, Montressor!\u201d\u2014but there was nothing but silence.\nI waited for two hours, reading e-mails and script outlines on my Blackberry, before turning the flames off. When I returned to the studio on Monday, the oven had cooled down, and the crew was emptying it out.\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have gone down to the soundstage to watch them, but I had to make sure there was nothing left that could be identified, no tell-tale hearts or anything of that nature. Klein was right about the money, of course: most of it was fake, but he\u2019d probably never had a chance to find out. Fortunately, nothing in the ashes resembled a banknote, or the attach\u00e9 case. Just some small fragments of bone indistinguishable from the others we\u2019d used to decorate some of the sets, and some lumps of molten metal that had once been his Rolex and his belt buckle.\nOne of the stage hands picked some white lumps out of the ashes, and looked at them curiously. Teeth. Human teeth. My heart grew sick, but then he tossed them into the bin with the other rubbish. I smiled to see them there, but my smile failed as the teeth seemed to form themselves back into Klein\u2019s familiar smirk. Another shovel-full of ash landed on top of them, but I could still see them glistening there. I see them still.\nStephen Dedman was exposed to the works of Ray Bradbury and Edgar Allan Poe at an early age, and has never quite recovered.

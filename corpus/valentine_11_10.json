They\u2019d escaped the city because of the water riots. The city wouldn\u2019t last long; the night swallowed it up one time too many, and then day just never came.\nMaybe that\u2019s what happened to her \u2014 one terror swallowing another.)\nThe night sky was a battle of stars, a violent seam tearing through the center like a wound badly sewn up. The points of light marshaled in ways she didn\u2019t understand; the constellations she remembered were devoured by the hordes. Everything bled.\n(This prepares her, a little, for what comes later.)\n(What comes later:\nA star dropping out of sight, a ship that holds three, a scattering of gold.)\nIt is impossible, from the ground, to look at a star.\nThe atmospheric interference muddies the light, drags it through the sky faster than your eyes can follow. If you\u2019re lucky\u2014if you\u2019re at a high altitude, on a clear night, in a lonely place\u2014this interference is perhaps a few dozen arcseconds out of alignment with reality. If it\u2019s windy, or you can\u2019t escape the summer, or you are trapped by people and lights, your problems multiply. You fall away from the truth by full seconds; you are hopelessly lost the moment you turn your face to the sky.\nBy the time you look up, nothing is true anymore; the ghosts of the stars only flicker and shine.\nAstronomers call this measurement Seeing. (Science has run out of more complicated words to explain the ways the universe has outwitted us.)\nWhat it means: you can\u2019t trust your eyes. You can\u2019t trust your instruments. You can\u2019t trust a thing, from the ground.\nThey made it to a boat. At night, Marika slipped from her mother\u2019s arms and climbed to the deck to watch the sky.\nOnce, an old man was sitting on the railing. He was staring at something\u2014a steady, bright star that was already setting.\nThe water that night was calm, past the ship\u2019s wake; the edges of the sky were mirrored clean. The star, reflected in the water\u2019s edge, looked like twins moving to greet one another.\nThe old man didn\u2019t turn to look at her. He didn\u2019t move at all. He watched the star setting for a long time.\nWhen it slipped into the water, so did he.\nIt seemed rude that some places survived when others didn\u2019t, but Marika and her mother found a city where lights still came on. (Her mother didn\u2019t last six months there; too used to running.)\nThe city drafted for sciences; better than a war that only drafted cannon fodder. When the city came for Marika, she didn\u2019t argue.\n(They had privatized water. Mission Control got it below market price. Marika even had enough to bathe in. She still hoarded, took furtive gulps like she didn\u2019t know when the next one was coming. It gave her away as a refugee, but she couldn\u2019t stop. Some thirsts you never get over.)\nThey teach Marika how to measure light.\nIn some ways it\u2019s interesting to discover that light has measures other than Safe and Not Safe, that there\u2019s still a world in which mathematics are of any use at all. But the more she learns about candelas and albedo and gravitational lensing and seeing and the impossibility of ever knowing anything for sure, the more thinks that every light should just be classified Not Safe.\n(You know as little about light as you know about why a man would slip away into the water when the shore was in sight by morning.)\nBut still she negotiates the unlikelihood of Gaussian distribution in phase fluctuations, and calculates probable intermittency to gauge turbulence strength, all so that someone standing at the telescope can point the lens at the sky and know where it\u2019s really looking.\nKonstantinova heads up the observation banks, and Marika tries not to look over her shoulder at the star map there. (It doesn\u2019t matter. Not her business. Not Safe.)\nWhen Gliese 581-d transits its star, Marika is the only one still awake working, and Konstantinova says, \u201cWell, it might as well be you\u2014come look at this.\u201d\nMarika leans in and watches the screen; it\u2019s a grainy, stuttering image replaying in a slow-motion loop, tucked into a corner and drowned out by a crawl of numbers underneath. She recognizes the numbers at the very bottom edge; the initial readings are run through her model to peel away the seeing and get as close to exact locations as their numbers allow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Konstantinova says.\nMarika knows she\u2019s only looking at the numbers.\nNumbers are universal, Marika gets it. You have to rely on mathematics if you\u2019re going to get anywhere, because the universe conspires against you the moment you lift your face to the sky in some warm place on a windy plain, the atmosphere sluicing across the nightscape, your meager vision blurred by tears. Marika understands.\n(But she knows, she knows, you can\u2019t tell a thing from the ground.)\nThis moment is their first point of contact.\n(Only Konstantinova would know what that means, what will happen now; but it\u2019s a measurement she never takes.)\nKonstantinova has a knack for transit.\nShe watches the map they\u2019ve made, piled with F-through-M stars (warm enough to heat a planet, cool enough to last). They\u2019re tagged; the closest ones have telescopes dogging them, just in case.\n(They won\u2019t be able to stay here very long. They have to pick somewhere to go where they stand a chance.)\nSometimes one of the stars has a drop in luminosity, the intensity of their light suddenly dimming. This happens sometimes when one is dying, or a flare ends, or when debris comes between the telescope and the far-off star.\nBut Konstantinova has a knack, and she can watch the numbers sinking and know she has a transit even before the alarm sounds.\nEvery time it comes she flips the switch to record, replays it in slow motion, marks the points of contact: click, click, click, click.\nEvery time, she thinks, Let this be home.\n(By now the numbers are practically shapes; she can look at a column of numerals and see the corona of a star.)\nDuring a planetary transit, there are four points of contact, moments where the circumference of the planet touches the edge of the star in only one place.\n1. Just before the transit begins, when the outermost edges meet for the first time.\n2. As the planet moves closer to the center, when the trailing edge of the planet has just come within the circle of the star.\n3. As the planet passes the center of the transit, its leading curve touches the far edge of the star.\n4. At the end of transit, the trailing curve of the planet moves closer and closer to freedom; then there is a single point of contact with the edge of the star; then the transit is over and they are parting.\n(This has no real scope if you are close to the event; schoolchildren gather with shoeboxes to peer into the eclipse, that\u2019s all.\nThis has no meaning until you are watching your new home become a black pearl against a far-off disc of light.)\nGliese 581 is a red dwarf star, warm and small, twenty light years from the Earth. It hangs in Libra, if you\u2019re watching from the ground. It has four planets ringing it. One of them transits at the right speed; it\u2019s close enough to Gliese for light, far enough for water.\n(The classification is Gliese 581-d; when people begin to pin hopes on it, it shrinks to \u201cGliese Dee\u201d; to \u201cDee.\u201d Marika calls it Gliese 581, never mentions Dee at all.)\nThere is a chance Dee is an ocean planet.\nIn the ops bay, there is construction on a small-scale human transport. There are calculations being made.\nIt is a very slight chance, but these are desperate days, and people must put a lot of faith, sometimes, in very slight chances.\nSometimes when they were still running from place to place, it was a comfort for Marika to watch the sky and see there was no balance there, either. The stars you knew would roll beyond your sight and be replaced by strangers, and there was nothing you could do.\nAfter a while she couldn\u2019t breathe in cities, wanted only to be in the wild, watching a war she couldn\u2019t win.\n(The sky is a battle; stars are always falling.)\nSeeing can be mitigated on cold, clear nights. From a refuge on top of a mountain, the seeing is so clear that, if you didn\u2019t know better, it might not occur to you that the star is even moving.\n(You know better now; you can\u2019t trust your eyes.)\nSometimes there\u2019s no such luck, and even the Moon wavers like a coin submerged in shallow water. When seeing is at its worst, the Aristarchus crater on the Oceanus Procellarum can suffer so much distortion that it\u2019s only intermittently visible. If you know what you\u2019re looking for, and you know your numbers, you can calculate the seeing from that.\nMarika doesn\u2019t learn this until it\u2019s too late. For her, Aristarchus is always just a pale dot in a black sea, washing in and out of sight; a star on dark water, or a drowning man.\nMaybe the old man held out a hand as he toppled\u2014a reflex, second thoughts\u2014but Marika never remembers. Maybe he called for help, or tried to pull himself up before the water took him, but it might be a lie.\nThis moment always blurs when she tries to recall it; it wavers like the Moon, sneaks sidelong into her imagination when she\u2019s running checklists on the three-seat ship that will carry them to Gliese 581.\n(She doesn\u2019t think she was terrified watching the old man drop into the water, but she must have been; whenever he appears in her thoughts she freezes, fumbles for something to hold on to.)\nWhen she\u2019s drunk enough and dreaming, sometimes he holds out his arm and the star-wake catches him, pulls him smoothly across the water until he disappears into the sky.\nBut it was only Jupiter, she thinks, not a star; you know that now.\nShe wakes up grieving, doesn\u2019t know why.\nMarika calls it Gliese 581 because she doesn\u2019t ever want to pin her hopes on a planet by mistake.\nTheir spacesuits are molded in the Orlan model\u2014a thick skin they can pull on and clamp shut\u2014and Konstantinova thinks it\u2019s remarkably like wearing an elephant.\nApparently it\u2019s not as bad as it used to be. The gloves are more articulated, the legs less bulky. There\u2019s still no joint at the neck; the chest is stiff to support the oxygen and coolant strapped to the back.\nBefore Alkonost I, she and Zeke and Marika run drills until they can all get in, attach the water-coolant hoses, and seal up in five minutes; in four; in three.\nKonstantinova always hears an exhale over the mike when Marika\u2019s fastened in. For a long time she thinks it\u2019s relief. Exertion, maybe. Panic, maybe. (Marika is a liability; why they\u2019re sending her up is anyone\u2019s guess.)\nBut once, Konstantinova sees Marika\u2019s face as Zeke seals her in: Marika frowns, brushes at the helmet\u2019s gold-coated visor like she\u2019s cleaning a dirty glass.\n(The sound is a sigh. It hurts.)\nKonstantinova\u2019s life support system whirrs awake.\n\u201cClear,\u201d she says, turns her mind to important things.\n\u201cThe life support system isn\u2019t active in the pods,\u201d says Zeke. \u201cShit. Mission Control, are you reading me?\u201d\nAn acknowledgement comes back over the static; then a plan. Marika and Zeke fish around in the toolbox and do as they\u2019re told. Konstantinova takes comm, passing along a series of orders that become wild guesses.\nNo one panics until they realize the ambient heat from the launch melted a circuit in the outer hull that can\u2019t be set right again.\nMission Control goes quiet for a long time.\nMarika and Zeke wait, holding the handrails to keep from floating away; at the comm, Konstantinova is bent over like someone punched her in the stomach.\nThen the Director says, \u201cAt full speed, it\u2019s forty years to Dee. Operations calculates that it\u2019s possible to make it, without suspension, on the existing lift-support.\u201d A pause. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough for a return.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t say, We might not have this chance again, if this ship comes down in pieces. He doesn\u2019t say, You might as well take your chances, things aren\u2019t any better on the ground.\nKonstantinova\u2019s visor trembles against the net of stars.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have some life support after landing,\u201d comes over the line. \u201cA day, maybe, maybe a week. Depends how much oxygen you use on the trip. But even a day is long enough to find out if Dee is really habitable.\u201d\nThe Director clears his throat. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a call we\u2019re going to make, Alkonost. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\nAfter a long time, Konstantinova says, \u201cNo.\u201d\nZeke says, \u201cAnd I\u2019m a No. That\u2019s majority\u2014we\u2019re no-go, Control. We\u2019re inputting a new trajectory. Confirm.\u201d\nKonstatinova curses under her breath, until the roar of the atmosphere swallows the words.\nAfter it\u2019s over, Konstantinova pulls Marika out of the hatch.\n\u201cMy hand hurts,\u201d Marika says, absently.\nKonstantinova says, \u201cWe broke your fingers.\u201d\n(This is the second; it is nearly the eclipse.)\nMarika doesn\u2019t remember anything until they play the recording.\nThen she listens as Zeke orders her more and more sharply to let go of the handhold and strap in for re-entry, where are you going, the decision\u2019s been made, this is an order, don\u2019t touch the hatch, have you lost your mind, that\u2019s an order, answer me goddammit, move back now or I\u2019ll make you move.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer?\u201d they ask her.\nShe says, \u201cI did.\u201d\n(Not then\u2014when Zeke blocked the hatch and broke her fingers, it was Konstantinova who yelped.\nBut on the recorder, as soon as the Director said \u201cIt\u2019s possible to make it,\u201d she said \u201cGo.\u201d)\nThey put Marika back at the computer bank, and she gauges wind resistance and plots angles and tells the telescope where it should be pointing.\n(She\u2019s still good at it; she just doesn\u2019t look behind her anymore where the map is, where the ghosts of the stars flicker and shine.)\nIt\u2019s a week before anyone talks to her.\nThe first person who does is Konstantinova.\n\u201cCan you move your fingers?\u201d\nMarika says, \u201cYes.\u201d\nA week later, Konstantinova hands her a screwdriver, says, \u201cProve it.\u201d\nKonstantinova makes her do mechanic drills at night, after the others are asleep.\nSo Marika drills: into her suit in two minutes, alone; flicking switches to a full-speed metronome; screwing and unscrewing panels until the pads of her fingers have no skin left.\nShe doesn\u2019t understand why, until she hears rumors that the techs are making modifications and repairs; that it will be going back up as Alkonost II, with three chairs up for grabs.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never crew me again,\u201d she says.\nKonstantinova says, \u201cYou have fifteen seconds. Go.\u201d\nIt takes a year for Alkonost II to take off.\nZeke gets water-fever and dies. No one offers to replace him.\nWalters gets drafted out of the pilot pool. He\u2019s surly to the techs; he can suit up in two minutes; he cries in his bunk.\nKonstantinova wishes for one, just one, to be the sort of person you want beside you when you stand on a new planet.\nBut no one else comes, and that morning on the launch pad, it\u2019s Marika standing on her other side.\n(This is the third; it\u2019s almost over.)\nThe launch succeeds. The pods register nominal. The life support system holds.\nThey make it through the asteroid belt with only one bump (a fragment of meteorite, so small that when it strikes the hull it makes a soprano ping they can hear inside).\nDecision point comes after that, with the inner planets behind them and Jupiter filling the viewscreen. Along the top edge, a shadow is passing; a moon in transit.\n\u201cWe are go,\u201d says Konstantinova; her feet go numb just saying it.\n\u201cGodspeed,\u201d says Mission Control.\nOn the ground, they\u2019ve already started to leave notes, to write things down and lock them up safely in case the war gets worse while they\u2019re gone. They\u2019re making a covenant of things for their children to do when they\u2019re grown and staring at the dusty computer banks, greeting three far-away strangers.\n\u201cWhen we wake up,\u201d says Konsantinova, \u201cwe won\u2019t know a soul. Imagine that.\u201d\nShe glances behind her, but Marika\u2019s looking out at Jupiter with a crestfallen face; a moment later, Marika closes her pod like she\u2019s glad to go.\n(Walters went into his right after launch, even before the asteroid field. He\u2019d better be as good at landings as they swear he is. She doesn\u2019t put much faith in people who are surly to techs.)\nKonstantinova stays up long enough to watch the ship accelerate to full speed, just in case.\nJupiter drops away, and Uranus and Neptune roll past in the distance like blue marbles, and there\u2019s a brief bright string of stones along the Kuiper belt (Haumea whirling by), and then they\u2019re in deep space and it\u2019s nothing but her star map, as far as she can see.\nIt\u2019s so familiar, suddenly, that she has to calculate the luminosity of Vega from memory before she can breathe again.\n(Some thirsts you never get over.)\nThey wake up three days shy of Gliese 581.\nKonstantinova wakes a day before the others to check out the comm. The Captain should be first, she feels. Zeke would have agreed.\nWhen Dee comes into sight, cloudy and blue and welcome, Konstantinova holds her breath, runs some numbers.\n(It\u2019s an afterthought. By now the numbers are practically shapes, and she knows what home looks like.)\nWalters wakes next. He looks out at the planet, sighs, and starts to dress.\nMarika wakes last. As her pod cracks open she knocks it away with outstretched arms, leans out the edge and takes a few gasping breaths.\n\u201cI dreamed we hit the water,\u201d she says.\nKonstantinova doesn\u2019t answer. People\u2019s dreams are their own business.\nThe navigation system is working and the life support is as expected (enough air to get home, and Konstantinova tries not to shout with relief).\nThere\u2019s a message from Mission Control, only twenty years old, which catches up to them on the second day. A few of the old voices from Mission Control send good wishes, and introduce some new voices.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring your trip, Alkonost,\u201d says one of the strangers. \u201cEverything looks good; watch fuel usage on your way in, so you can make it back up all right if the gravity\u2019s stronger than estimated. Let us know when you wake up. Good morning, and Godspeed.\u201d\nKonstantinova sends a message back. Beside her, Marika looks grimly through the viewscreen, where Gliese 581-d is spinning in the glow of their new home star.\nThey suit up and take positions for landing; it\u2019s so instinctive now that Konstantinova smiles.\n(She spent forty years dreaming of setting down on Dee, and after all that practice the comm switches feel like her own fingertips.\nShe never got to the part where they step out on a new world; not enough imagination left over.)\nThe checklist goes well until the very last moment, until Dee\u2019s gravity has already caught them and they\u2019ve begun the slow, inevitable fall.\n\u201cThe third shock absorber isn\u2019t running,\u201d says Konstaninova. The words sound distant; disbelieving.\n\u201cWe can land with two,\u201d Marika says.\nWalters says, \u201cNot on water; if we\u2019re off by more than a few degrees the surface tension will knock us over before we even touch down. We\u2019ll slam into the water and be pulverized by impact.\u201d He\u2019s not disbelieving; he sounds like that\u2019s just what he\u2019s expected all along.\n\u201cThen you\u2019d better do your job, I guess,\u201d Konstantinova snaps.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d asks Marika. \u201cIt froze?\u201d\nKonstaninova frowns at the diagnostic. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like it. The mechanism still registers. Something must have broken loose while we were sleeping. Maybe we can open the nav panel in the back and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIn the asteroid belt,\u201d says Marika. \u201cSomething hit the hull.\u201d\n\u201cAfter last time, there better not be a fucking thing wrong with that hull,\u201d says Konstantinova.\n\u201cBut it sang,\u201d Marika says quietly.\nAll at once Konstantinova has a vision like a reel of film, as a sliver of rock careens into the hull, as a few grains slice through the hull and nick the fuel line, as forty years of a microscopic accident converge on them at once when there\u2019s not enough pressure in a valve.\nShe tries for words, and for a moment fails.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t access that now,\u201d Walters says. \u201cWe\u2019re heading into the atmosphere, we\u2019ll burn up if we go out there. Let\u2019s pull out, we\u2019ll look at it from a steady orbit.\u201d\n\u201cIf we pull out now,\u201d says Konstanitnova, \u201cwe\u2019ll burn the fuel we need to launch from the surface of Dee and go home. So we take our chances in the water, or we take our chances on the ground.\u201d\nThis shouldn\u2019t be such an agony; this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been here. It should get easier. This should have an answer, by now.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she manages, \u201cpull out and circle back on a one-way trip. This is the go/no go. Vote.\u201d\nShe waits without turning for them to weigh in. She has a new respect for Mission Control, forty-one years ago; this is a silence that\u2019s hard to allow.\nAt last, Walters says, \u201cNo go. We\u2019ll take our chances in the water.\u201d\nMarika doesn\u2019t say anything. Konstantinova frowns at the comm, wonders if she missed it; if Marika answered while Konstaninova was still talking.\n(Marika has that habit, and her answer is always Go.)\nBut she waits for an answer a long time, until there is the sound of something sealing; Konstantinova sees the warning light go red under her fingers before she registers that Marika is opening the outer hatch.\nClick.\n(The transit is over; they are parting.)\nThe hairline crack is in the hydraulics panel. As Marika approaches it, moving hand over hand along the side rails, one bead of gasoline pushes through it and away.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get home,\u201d she says into her mic. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost too much already.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t know if the connection is still live; she forgets if she turned it on or not, and her heart is pounding too loudly for her to hear a thing.\nShe grips the screwdriver in her free hand and gets to work. It\u2019s familiar by now, and the screws come apart one by one, cling gently to the magnets in the fingertips of her glove.\nThe suit warms up with her work; her visor fogs. She tries not to panic. There\u2019s not enough air to panic. (She disconnected\u2014there wasn\u2019t time for anything else.)\nIf she lets go of the handrail, she\u2019ll vanish.\nShe imagines a darkness like the darkness of the boat on calm water, imagines stretching out a hand as she falls.\nThe screwdriver shakes; she clamps down with numb fingers to keep it from escaping, drags off another screw.\nBut it\u2019s useless. Her helmet is fogging up from the inside now\u2014she can\u2019t see, she can\u2019t see, and there\u2019s not enough time left to hold her breath and wait for equalization, not enough oxygen left to hyperventilate and turn it into droplets big enough to see around.\nShe shoves the pick in at an angle, to avoid her eyes.\nThree stabs before the visor cracks; another three before she can wedge the pick inside and wrench it out.\nThe shield winks once and spins gently out of sight, knocks away a scattering of gold where the coating has flaked off under the chisel.\nShe exhales, so her lungs don\u2019t explode from the decompression, and turns to the bulkhead with shaking hands. She has to work fast\u2014she forgets how long you can last before the darkness swallows you.\n(You have fifteen seconds. Go.)\nThe last screw opens; the panel opens.\nShe slices the fuel line where it\u2019s torn, shoves the healthy end of the hose back into the joint, throws the clamp shut. Stray gasoline floats past her in black pearls.\n(She\u2019s freezing; her lips are numb; when she blinks her eyelids crack, snap off, go flying.)\nThe panel begins to vibrate as the system kicks in.\n(Seven seconds.)\nShe slams the bulkhead shut, fumbles three of the screws back into place. It\u2019s all she manages before her fingers freeze.\nFar away, Konstantinova is saying something about re-entry, about being out of time, she\u2019s panicked, she\u2019s screaming\u2014but the last of the air escapes the suit, and then there\u2019s silence.\n(Marika breathes in; her lungs collapse.)\nThe ship is accelerating now, dragging her.\nShe pulls free.\nThe motion spins her slightly, away from the planet towards the sky. For a moment, the full view stuns her.\nShe thinks, It\u2019s beautiful.\nIt\u2019s the first time in her life she\u2019s ever thought it.\n(This is why: there is no seeing.\nNow there is only the sky; she\u2019s looking, for an instant, straight to the stars. This is the true geography.)\nThe Milky Way rips through the black at a different angle; this sky is a stranger, a ceaseless riot, sharp and steady-bright.\nIt\u2019s a lovely war.\n(Two seconds.\nOne second.)\nAfter it\u2019s over, Konstantinova will emerge from the sea.\nShe will stand on the deck of the Alkonost; pull off her helmet; breathe.\nThe night will be deep. When she turns her face to the sky, to search for a place to begin with her numbers, the ghosts of the stars will flicker and shine.\nGenevieve Valentine is a novelist (her most recent is near-future political thriller Icon) and comic book writer, including Catwoman for DC Comics.

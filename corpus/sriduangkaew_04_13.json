There would be speculation afterward what Esithu was born as\u2014someone\u2019s son, someone\u2019s daughter? To that Esithu would always say, \u201cI was born as I am now,\u201d which became a stretch after Esithu obtained a second then a third body. A hardware upgrade, they liked to say. You can never have too many.\nThat was much later.\nEsithu was a creature of solitude but, afflicted with being so new in a world so old, they found themselves craving company.\nThis close to the heels of conquest, sedition was a rife, busy game, and it drew Esithu as war drew soldiers. They came to it\u2014or it came to them\u2014in a little club on the outskirts of Vithansuthi, the city in which everything happened.\nOn the walls, flowers fought and devoured each other, mouth-tipped stamens tessellating in choral fury. Onstage a dancer moved in simpatico, mercury limbs shimmering silver, a body of animated liquid.\n\u201cIt is said,\u201d Esithu\u2019s table companion began, a non-sequitur to follow a conversation they never started, \u201cthat the universe was sung into being by a divine androgyne.\u201d\nAt that point Esithu was not yet acquainted with quantum theories, though even further along in life they would find said theories little more than superstition. Blunt, they asked, \u201cAre you some sort of evangelist?\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s eyes glittered. Her sclera and irises were hidden behind compound lenses, all ruby facets. \u201cTruth is always in need of evangelizing. Now more than ever, and I\u2019m not talking about creation myths.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a bad climate for demagogues.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed no; it\u2019s never been better.\u201d\n\u201cWe lost, you realize.\u201d Their government bent so quickly to surrender there\u2019d hardly been casualties. Esithu had bet on that, and reaped a tidy profit against friends more patriotic.\n\u201cOur defeat is opportune. It is now that we can subvert them from within.\u201d\nEsithu snorted. Newly assimilated border planets subverted nothing except their own sense of self. Samutthewi would lap and swallow until it was as Hegemonic as the rest.\n\u201cBut now is the time,\u201d the woman insisted. \u201cNot five years from now when we\u2019ve grown comfortable; not ten years from now when we think back and say, ah, it used to be untidy and now that we\u2019ve the Hegemony breathing on our neck everything is better\u2014faster\u2014more beautiful. Then it will be nearly impossible.\u201d\nThey laughed in her face. \u201cIt is impossible now.\u201d\nA second dancer vaulted over the first, feet and fingers full of fire.\nEsithu\u2019s alterations were more comprehensive than most. A recasting of face to obtain a youthful blankness that allowed for no surety\u2014at a glance or several\u2014male or female. A removal of signatures that gave them identity and history. Their body grew a map of scars, each puckered indentation marking where a regulation implant used to be. Their subsequent bodies, though made fresh, bore much the same.\nCellular editing was as yet unrefined. Hormonal inhibitors were installed, excess skin sheared away, and much that was flesh was replaced by that which was not. It made them strong and incandescent. Blood that flowed faster and a heart that shouted louder. Esithu felt their pulse in their fingertips and their mouth, a new potency that informed their dreams with lightning jolts.\nPerhaps this delirious power\u2014the need for an outlet\u2014brought them back to the club, on a night where ambient audio was generated by replicants reenacting war. The ceiling was a sky the color of rust, the floor cracked earth the hue of vertebrae, and two-dimensional combatants screamed while equally flat fighters rained down fire. No such war had been fought on Samutthewi soil for generations uncounted. It was anachronistic; it plucked at the gut. The volume was muted but the tempo could be felt marrow-deep. Patrons kept on edge, nervous energy that could be channeled.\nA clever if obvious trick, and Esithu respected tricks that worked. When the woman returned they didn\u2019t tell her to preach elsewhere, and she introduced herself as Lykesca.\n\u201cSounds Costeya,\u201d Esithu said.\nShe touched her lenses. They were animated today, amber twitching against green, flaring into tendrils that took the place of her hair. Beneath the undulating colors her skull gleamed metallic red. \u201cSuoqua.\u201d\n\u201cAn agent provocateur then.\u201d Of a sovereignty that\u2019d just seceded from\u2014and proven itself a match for\u2014the Hegemony.\n\u201cNot a bit. I\u2019m Samutthewi stock much like you, and would give a proof of phenotype if that meant anything, which you of all people would know it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nIt did not. Attaining a look more Costeya had become the rage; life could be made just a little easier that way. Gendered characteristics aside, Estihu had made a point of retaining most of their original features. \u201cTake off the lenses and the rest. I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it matter what I look like? We aren\u2019t going to kiss. My aesthetic appeal is beside the point. Here\u2019s my genetic overview though, if you\u2019re in want of authenticity.\u201d\nEsithu deleted the data packet unread. National origins did not dictate allegiance. Samutthewi tribalism went only so far in an age where it served one seldom, betrayed one often. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a theorist.\u201d\n\u201cAnthropology. Not a real science, if you ask most.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve an interest in particular ideologies. Very real, very significant.\u201d\nTo an academic there existed no flattery more effective than the bait of relevancy, an opportunity to feel faintly important and matter. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking up cybernetics.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a drastic switch.\u201d\n\u201cCybernetics concerns the intersection and interaction of flesh and ideas. It\u2019s a natural outgrowth.\u201d\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Lykesca said, \u201ca literalization of your politics.\u201d\nEsithu clapped a brief, private applause. \u201cWho talks like that? You must be either student or graduate, and fresh from school.\u201d\nMuscles in Lykesca\u2019s face rippled beneath all the rioting lights. Her eyebrows she had shaven clean off. \u201cIt pleases you to condescend, but I won\u2019t be put off. I\u2019ve got boundless resources and an important project on the cusp of completion.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is in it for me?\u201d\n\u201cMonetary compensation. Vindication for your most passionate beliefs. At the very least I think you\u2019ll find my ideas . . . intriguing.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as?\u201d\n\u201cUpending how the Hegemony thinks.\u201d Lykesca gestured at her head. \u201cI\u2019m looking to play a very long game.\u201d\nLykesca, Esithu supposed, was a little mad. But she was good about one thing: her funds were near-limitless. Her project had begun thirty-six years ago, anticipating a spark of greed in the Hegemonic eye long before anyone thought them a threat to Samutthewi.\nEsithu reevaluated her age. It was not easy; Lykesca never set aside her accoutrements. Chrome filaments webbed her skull, enclosing her forearms and wrists in the fashion favored by Costeya generals. \u201cAre you military?\u201d Esithu asked her, to get it out of the way.\n\u201cIf I was I would be risking life and career both\u2014and my family as well. Seven generations forward and backward executed. The Costeya army is unconditionally literal about oaths of loyalty.\u201d\n\u201cUnless you\u2019ve anonymized your past.\u201d\nLykesca smiled with narrow lips that had been cosmeticized to resemble charred wood. \u201cWhy, but that is impossible. Let\u2019s stay realistic, Professor.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have tenure.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it fun to be called that? Prestige, erudition, a steady income.\u201d Lykesca strode ahead without looking over her shoulder, at a pace with the rhythm and look of a soldier\u2019s march.\nThe facility wended deep, of such scope that it couldn\u2019t have gone undetected for so long\u2014but it had, if Lykesca was to be believed. Layers of disruptive plating canceled out signals; a second set of disruptors blanked out tectonic and heat scans. Trailblazing stealth tech: classified and beyond doubt restricted to military use. No sensor confirmed Lykesca\u2019s identity that Esithu could see, but they doubted the gates stood open and welcome to anyone who came calling.\nBehind the blast wall, the temperature plunged. Mainframes, limned in soft light, breathed like sleeping children. Glass capsules overhead shone with firefly bots wheeling in abstract patterns. There was a rhythm to them, and\u2014on intuition\u2014Esithu replayed the cannibal flowers\u2019 chorus. One of the capsules matched exactly.\n\u201cSubliminal behavior modification?\u201d\n\u201cThat makes it sound more sinister than it is. I\u2019m using the tunes as a conductive medium, that\u2019s all; the important part is making them go viral.\u201d\n\u201cIs this marketing gone wrong?\u201d\nLykesca chortled. \u201cOh, no, though some companies have tried similar methods. Memetic dreams. Culinary transmission. You heard about that?\u201d\n\u201cMy grandparents probably did.\u201d Esithu revised their estimate a second time. Provided she was born into fortune Lykesca might have started anti-aging therapy as early as adolescence. Some parents, especially zealous, initiated it as soon as their offspring reached toddlerhood. \u201cWhat kind of scale are you talking about? For your endeavor.\u201d\n\u201cA long game,\u201d she said. \u201cMy objective is to safeguard Samutthewi.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and?\u201d\n\u201cI want to alter the way humanity collects past, present, and in consequence the future. They\u2019re already halfway there\u2014all they need is a little nudge. How do you receive information, Professor? How do you know what is happening beyond Vithansuthi or across the far edges of the Hegemony?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the net.\u201d\n\u201cJust so. That\u2019s how people perceive and learn. Data subsumes material reality. Suppose you glance at news about Thotsakan\u2019s eel exports. Suppose it says that\u2019s been disrupted for the foreseeable future. There\u2019ll be feeds of what\u2019s happening down there . . . laborer strike, a sudden infection that halved the eel harvest, and so on. But.\u201d Lykesca snapped her fingers. \u201cWhat if you can\u2019t? What if in fact there\u2019s nothing wrong with the eels or the harvesters, but everyone on Thotsakan and beyond believes there is?\u201d\nEsithu touched the edge of one mainframe. Icy enough to numb. \u201cHypothetically there are a number of solutions. You\u2019re after a specific one.\u201d\n\u201cFirst the data is altered; each farm\u2019s cortices will report false. Easy, yes? Then the data would\u2019ve to be proofed against doubt and fact-checking.\u201d\nThey followed her reasoning. \u201cThe average individual already relies on grid updates for traffic routes, current events, disaster warnings.\u201d\n\u201cOne day you think the eels are sick and dying; the next sync you think the workers are on strike and agitating for better work conditions. Whatever the data you\u2019re fed is taken as fact. A connection implanted at infancy. At the beginning it\u2019ll be for instilling early behavior, better than any AI nurse. By the time they talk the babies are literate. By the time they are ten, the grid will be their sole channel with which to interact with the world. You will, I hope, turn the key.\u201d\n\u201cThis is either a tall order or a thought experiment so preposterous it\u2019s beneath contempt.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you believe, I\u2019d like your input.\u201d Lykesca flashed her teeth. \u201cNo pressure. It\u2019s only a universal revolution.\u201d\nIt might well be that or it might not\u2014Esithu engaged with Lykesca\u2019s proposal for the sheer, seductive absurdity of it. They sought out aquariums in which to listen to whale-song, zoos in which to observe the migration patterns of volcano-cranes as triggered by eruption signals. They became intimately familiar with how vibrations affected the deaf, how changes in light affected the blind. They studied sounds infused with colors and scents, and the induction of synesthesia.\nEsithu\u2019s initial subjects were, of necessity, fictive. Virtual constructs, virtual lives. They created tribes that worshiped sequences of birdcall, nations that bound themselves to musical theory and waged war over tonal disputes. They tried an evolutionary approach: how humanity might have structured its mores, languages and cultures if it was created by a god who gave commandments in biophony and prophecies in randomly generated verses.\nSimulation had limits. Esithu sent for live subjects, and Lykesca provided.\nVolunteers, Esithu was reassured; hard-up dregs, Esithu could see. Homeless mostly, addicts to the last, and desperate\u2014but then, Esithu did not require them healthy and the experiments were not audited by an ethics committee. It was disturbingly liberating\u2014and efficient\u2014to have a patron as amoral and wealthy as Lykesca. Progress reports became Esithu\u2019s calendar.\nThey wove in and out of clubs and dance floors, hearing more of Lykesca\u2019s music. Some of it was released under composers up-and-coming, others under stars long established with reach across most demographics. Some avant-garde and others conventional.\n\u201cSuppose you succeed,\u201d they said to Lykesca over an olfactory sculpture, \u201cwhat do you expect to happen?\u201d They always met in museums or galleries, Lykesca\u2019s preference and pretension.\n\u201cFor the first decade, not much will change.\u201d She had set aside her accessories, and without them her face was plain, a chameleon. As though her complexion had been selected to blend in anywhere, the planes of her cheekbones and jawline likewise. Family to all and none. \u201cThe speed of normatization will depend on Hegemonic encouragement.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\u201cThen we erase Samutthewi from all memory. Rub it out of existence. The best defense you can give a nation too weak to fight back.\u201d\nA replicant connoisseur stepped around them to inhale the sculpture. Its eyes, never meant to look human, lit up. Blue fire race down its shoulders. There\u2019d been more of these lately, replicants produced to consume, focus-groups in the wild to emulate and predict purchasing trends. Lykesca scowled after it. They must have, in ways minor or major, disrupted her.\n\u201cHow much of the music is yours?\u201d\nShe glanced at Esithu sidelong; laughed. \u201cDid you think this was for vanity? I\u2019m not an artist\u2014never have been. Almost everything else, but not that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have you gotten involved in?\u201d\n\u201cManufacturing, pharmaceuticals, agriculture. I believe in having a well-rounded set of interests and expertise. Makes one so much more interesting to talk to, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d She rubbed at the fuzzy growth of hair that was slowly encroaching on the shaven smoothness of her pate. \u201cI came to give you a deadline.\u201d\nEsithu pulled up data on the replicant consumers. A great many had rejected Lykesca\u2019s artists, and their patterns would be sieved for product forecasts. \u201cNo pressure, I thought?\u201d\n\u201cA concrete date can be reinvigorating. It\u2019s not unreasonable. In eighteen months I expect\u2014let\u2019s say a working prototype, a plan that can be put to action.\u201d\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t reasonable.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Lykesca breathed, \u201cyou\u2019re a genius.\u201d\nTheir mouth twitched. \u201cThat I may be, but I can\u2019t make something out of nothing. Eighteen months. What\u2019s escalated?\u201d\n\u201cWhat hasn\u2019t? The world escalates by the minute, and tomorrow\u2019s always more histrionic than yesterday.\u201d\nLykesca\u2019s underground compound was raided.\nEsithu did not hear it from her. It was a middling headline, rating barely more noise and flourish than a perfectly average murder involving defenestration at a porn shoot. A hidden lab, it was reported, with a dozen dead mainframes. Lykesca\u2019s ensuing silence made it difficult to tell whether she had been caught with her guard down, or whether she\u2019d sacrificed the facility to protect something dearer. She did not contact Esithu to clarify or instruct.\nThe flow of funds cut off, abruptly.\nJust as well: Esithu did not want to be convicted as her accomplice. They scaled the project back to virtualization and absconded to Vithansuthi\u2019s old city where body-mod artists gathered and lived as far as they could off the grid. It was novel to go to sleep in such quiet, where the walls and floorboards did not pulse one awake with network noise. The derelict tenements stood on six legs each, roofed with scarab tiles, each narrow window the dull amber of carapaces.\nEsithu shared a floor with Yinshi, a woman who made songs out of religious chants, the shrieking of extinct predator birds, and stringed instruments: the old-fashioned sort. She played a hammered dulcimer and a balalaika, recording and sampling scraps of melody. The final products were rough, not altogether pleasant, but compelling.\n\u201cCould I commission a piece?\u201d\nYinshi looked up from her nest of cables and metal shells. \u201cI don\u2019t come cheap.\u201d\n\u201cI can pay.\u201d It would take all of Lykesca\u2019s remaining largesse, secreted away for contingencies. It would be well spent.\n\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d\n\u201cSomething,\u201d Esithu said, \u201cfor forgetting. Call it \u2018Annex\u2019 if you call it anything.\u201d\nThe rest of it was simply slotting algorithms into place. A matter of using sound to energize the effects of popular recreational drugs, and then unleashing it on an audience already well and dosed. Esithu made it small: a shift to alter perception of tempo.\nThey slipped into one of Yinshi\u2019s performances. The crowd danced two beats slower than they should, not quite matching what was being played. The second time Esithu activated the script, Yinshi\u2019s entire audience paused their network streams by mid-song and resumed them three-fourths of the way through.\nWhen they met Lykesca again she had a head full of hair, and limbs bristling with thorns.\n\u201cI like what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\nThey talked over wilted vegetable and slivers of synthetic meat. In the old city few had a functioning palate and most subsisted on liquid nutrients or tablets. Easier to digest, less interruption to addictives or ongoing modification processes. Esithu had started eating real food again as soon as the physiotherapy permitted.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping,\u201d Esithu said, \u201cthose are not prison marks.\u201d\nLykesca lifted a barbed hand; Esithu switched to an augmens overlay. A playback of Yinshi\u2019s music, spiked with Esithu\u2019s memetic injection. \u201cI\u2019ve been freer than a pirate ship, but if I\u2019m going to return to the scene of crime I might as well not be recognized on sight.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t ask if she\u2019d covered her tracks otherwise. It seemed an insult. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that your ideas are defeatist.\u201d\n\u201cComing from a cynic like you, that honestly upsets me.\u201d\n\u201cYou build them around the thought that not only can we not fight back now, we never will be able to. Not in two generations, not in twenty. Not ever.\u201d\nLykesca shook a head of razorish brambles. \u201cIt\u2019s true that plenty can happen over as short a time as decades. But I\u2019ve made projections, Esithu, and my plans aren\u2019t going to change.\u201d\n\u201cEven if I said I could trigger mass hallucination? Mass suicide?\u201d\nIt was gratifying to see Lykesca recoil. \u201cA little extreme,\u201d she said, \u201cand it won\u2019t solve anything. The Hegemony doesn\u2019t run on people. It\u2019s planets. It\u2019s inertia. Revenge on individuals\u2014this general, that lawmaker\u2014is meaningless.\u201d\nEsithu chewed on tasteless faux-chicken. \u201cIf you\u2019d said yes, I might have turned you in.\u201d\n\u201cVery amusing. When will you have it ready? I\u2019ll compile it against mass suicide models, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cWhat good fortune it is our sense of humor is so compatible. It\u2019s ready any time you want it.\u201d\nLykesca stood. \u201cYou\u2019ll know when the time comes.\u201d\nA public address on an override channel to all Hegemonic citizens: they were now at war with the Suoqua Sovereignty, and to harbor a Suoqua was treason. Save those who'd ripped out network receptors from their lobes, who\u2019d blinded and deafened themselves\u2014save those, none would fail to receive the broadcast.\nYinshi\u2019s piece beat just out of hearing, infiltrating the interstices between a call to arms, a demand for sacrifices. Esithu would find out only belatedly how Lykesca broke through the security filters to embed the song and its memetic payload.\nIt went undetected for some time; Esithu\u2019s injection left no trace, caused no immediate effect. They celebrated with turmeric-yellowed rice, tender poultry steeped in spices, and drinks that didn\u2019t taste like lukewarm acid. Yinshi ate with them in bemusement. Neither disclosed to her, quite, what had happened.\n\u201cI'm going to prove you wrong,\u201d Esithu said when the last yellow grain had been savored and swallowed.\nA little inebriated and having flirted\u2014disastrously\u2014with Yinshi, Lykesca licked a dash of sauce off her thumb. \u201cWhat about?\u201d\n\u201cCosteya will give up Samutthewi.\u201d\nShe vented a roar of laughter. Yinshi, dozing by the door, twitched awake. \u201cI'd say I wish you luck, but you'll need more than that. Immortality perhaps, and even then the universe will probably succumb to heat death first.\u201d\n\u201cI intend to return Samutthewi to autonomy before the universe forgets it, forgets us. A couple centuries, at least. Not that it\u2019ll moot your plan, but I just want to make a point.\u201d\nLykesca spluttered liquor and amusement, then collected herself. \u201cThen I can only say that I hope for the best, and may your ancestors watch over you.\u201d\nEsithu immersed themselves in cybernetics. They chased a greater consciousness, and a frame for it that could withstand time. They experimented on Yinshi, who wanted ears that could hear beyond the human range and fingers which could bifurcate to better manipulate strings. An extra arm.\nA year of that and Esithu began to work on themselves, opening up veins and digestive tracts, excavating fat and epidermis.\nIn Hegemonic capitals it became difficult to live without a synchronized memory, and few rejected total integration into the grid. So long as the phenomenon was under control it served Costeya interests. On their part, Esithu retained their own memory in an indelible partition.\nLykesca was caught, eventually.\nLike the raid, it happened in ignominious quiet. A data-terrorist and smuggler, Lykesca was called. There was a glimpse of her face, haggard and burned; she went to her execution tagged with a convict\u2019s code, cremated without name or kin.\nTwenty years after Lykesca\u2019s execution, Samutthewi became a native and loyal constituent of the Hegemony. It always had been, just as Costeya had always been at war with Suoqua.\nTwenty years after Lykesca\u2019s execution, Esithu revised Yinshi\u2019s music to tell a story. By then modifying data had become the exclusive province of Hegemonic agencies. But the backdoors stayed, and Esithu kept Lykesca\u2019s access protocols.\nEsithu gave Yinshi a change of name and origins out of courtesy, to sever her ties to a particular piece of music. \u201cAnnex\u201d returned to circulation and a heroine slipped into the fabric of Costeya history.\nA woman who shed and donned faces as easily as she changed names, who through tricks and transplants cheated death for a hundred lifetimes. A woman who traveled from world to world, promising unity under one name, an empire of peace whose borders knew no limits.\nIn the morning, flower-mouths in Vithansuthi sang a composition to honor Saint Lykesca, mother of Costeya.\nAcross Hegemonic planets the song was repeated, reverbing in uncounted millions of temples and churches. It preceded dawn prayers: Saint Lykesca ruled over worship of any thought or idol.\nAs she always would; as she always had.\nBenjanun Sriduangkaew writes love letters to strange cities, beautiful bugs, and the future.

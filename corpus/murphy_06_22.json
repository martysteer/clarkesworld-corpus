Red for Mars. Pink and orange for clouds. Cerulean for the dot in the sky I call home, in this timeline. Jeannie sticks out her tongue when she colors. Her knuckles turn white as she rubs the crayons to nubs. She hands the picture to me as flakes of wax fall to the floor like confetti.\n \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Jeannie,\u201d I say and kiss her forehead. She smells like earth after the rain. I hang it next to the others on the fridge. Her drawings overlap my sketches. Two artists in the family, as my husband likes to say. Jeannie runs outside to play. I tiptoe to the front of the house and push the blinds back an inch.\n Joseph, the man who moved in across the street last year, dug a koi fishpond in his front yard and planted bamboo ten meters high. The lady on the corner crocheted him a stuffed panda that hangs from one of the trees. In some timelines, the panda is a dragon. In one timeline, the dragon has eaten all the koi. In that agonizing timeline, Joseph does not want me at all.\n In most timelines, though, I borrow Joseph\u2019s comic books. He borrows my postapocalyptic paperbacks. We talk about robots and Bradbury and art. He\u2019s out there now. Shirtless. Feeding the fish. Their mouths breach the water in hungry little O\u2019s.\n My husband pulls into the driveway, blocking my view with the Jeep.\n He gives me a kiss when he walks in and asks about Jeannie.\n \u201cShe\u2019s out back,\u201d I say.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got Outlier testing in an hour, Audra. You said you\u2019d get her ready,\u201d Paul says, his Texas drawl more prominent when he loses his patience.\n \u201cSorry, I lost track of time,\u201d I say.\n Paul smiles, and his dimples melt away my thoughts. When I married him right out of high school, I never expected him to amount to anything. I always underestimated him, even before the rift sent us all into parallel timelines, before me and other Outliers pinballed in and out of pocket universes while the rest shifted into cozy sister dimensions. When he made Varsity or when the Space Force promoted him. I thought, at some point, he\u2019d fail, and I\u2019d no longer have to justify why we were together.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says and gathers up the crayons. His perfection stands so tall, it towers over me and leaves me in shadow.\n My nose tickles as if I\u2019m about to sneeze, and I shift into another dimension. Not all transitions through the rift are gentle. Gentle means life will be more or less normal here.\n In this timeline, Jeannie is at school and Paul is at the Institute. The phone buzzes. It\u2019s Joseph. My entire body burns when I see his name on the screen. My insides curdle and petrify. My heart beats against my chest like a moth against a lamp. I shiver and answer the call.\n \u201cCome over,\u201d he says in a voice like snow on the sidewalk. Soft, sibilant, gray. He knows I am alone. I press the phone to my ear and soak in his sound waves.\n I grab some books and the comics I borrowed and walk across the street. He leaves the door open for me. Johnny Cash\u2019s voice crackles from the stereo. He sings \u201cI\u2019m on Fire.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel when I know you are close,\u201d Joseph says. I don\u2019t respond. He takes my books and comics. Incense burns in the window and fills the house with a blurry haze. I want to drown in this smell.\n \u201cDo you have something new for me?\u201d\n \u201cTry this,\u201d he says and hands me Superman with a Soviet hammer and sickle on his chest. When I try to take it, he doesn\u2019t let go. \u201cFor your thoughts.\u201d\n \u201cHow about a penny instead?\u201d\n \u201cHow about a dance?\u201d\n Joseph tosses the comic on a chair. Its pages flip open and flutter. I want to dance, but I ask for a rain check instead.\n He stands and watches me and sighs.\n Hours slip by like brushstrokes. We talk about new shows and old films. We sit on the floor and flip through art books. We study each other. I memorize the wrinkles around his eyes. The shape of his lips. The scar on his eyebrow. We try not to touch. But the tips of my fingers meet his, and his skin electrifies me. Skin like packed powder. Like it could crumble and blow away if we give in and embrace.\n The rift scratches at my periphery. Smudges the edges of my mind with dry bristles.\n \u201cI have to go,\u201d I say, but I don\u2019t move.\n The rift takes me anyway.\n Paul and Jeannie walk in front of me down the Institute halls. Boys and girls in lab coats who can\u2019t possibly be old enough to study or work here walk past. I wonder if I looked like that before I graduated college.\n Paul is explaining how the machine stimulates your neurons to realign your consciousness to your \u201cdimension of origin.\u201d He may as well be speaking Japanese. I majored in Art History. In some timelines, I am the one explaining the rift to Jeannie while Paul stares blankly at the back of my head.\n Dr. Kuzbari greets us with clipboard in hand and escorts us to the Neurotemporal Alignment Lab. We go over the standard questions, and I wait for Paul and Jeannie to finish their sessions.\n \u201cYour turn, Mrs. Cobb,\u201d she says even though I tell her to call me Audra. I shoot a glance back to Paul.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll do great,\u201d Paul smiles and gives me two thumbs up.\n Dr. Kuzbari waits for me to sit in the leather chair before elevating it. She gives me the feedback helmet and lets me put it on myself. Then she clicks it into the humming machine behind me and checks the sensors for what seems like an hour.\n I hate this room. The ecru walls suffocate me. The lights dim and monitors flicker and beep like a techno music video. The helmet\u2019s headphones squeeze my ears, and they begin to ache. I try to readjust in the recliner, but it squeaks and snaps and I worry I broke it.\n \u201cJust relax,\u201d the doctor says. She positions the visor over my eyes. \u201cAlmost ready,\u201d she says in her lilting accent as she types nonstop.\n \u201cHow long have you been doing this?\u201d I say.\n \u201cThirty years now. I was a neuropsychiatrist in my old timeline.\u201d\n \u201cYou seem so young.\u201d I shift my weight but find no comfort.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, and the typing finally stops. \u201cYou may feel some discomfort when the helmet activates the rift. This is normal.\u201d\n The visor flashes green dots, and I feel like I\u2019ve been yanked inside out. I brace myself for what comes next.\n The shift is violent, and I pray my time in this place will be swift. The noises and lights disappear and leave me in a void. It\u2019s not black or white, but colorless, like the back of my eyelids. Then walls appear one by one. My walls. My house. I walk to the window and watch for Joseph to appear. He steps out on the porch and waves at me. I wave back.\n Thank gods. There are timelines where Joseph does not exist. Timelines where I am a lizard in a terrarium in my own house watching on as my husband makes love to another wife. Where my child is but stardust. Living through those rifts, however momentary, feels like being pressed through a sieve.\n Suddenly, the house starts to shake. The floor pulsates, shelves spit out books, and paintings jump from the walls like crickets. I try to hang on. I bang my fist against the window, but Joseph only waves.\n The vibrations thump and the windows explode. Glass snows on my hair and bounces on the rug. The house levitates. I reach through the broken window and cut my hand on a shard of glass. The blood flows down my arm, down the stucco, and evaporates in the fireball of rocket boosters below. My house transforms into a rocket amid liftoff. I lean out of the window and call for help, but Joseph only waves.\n Joseph waves goodbye.\n I scream, but my voice dissolves in the roar of the flames. I sob, but the wind dries my face.\n When the boosters sputter through the last layers of the atmosphere and the house is quiet again, I wade through the floating rubble to the kitchen. Curtains billow in a zero-gravity breeze, but my feet stick to the floor. Jeannie plucks crayons from the air and draws three-dimensional crystal domes. Paul takes me in his arms and grooms glass chunks out of my hair. He kisses my forehead, and I nestle into the nook between his shoulder and his heart.\n Guilt overwhelms me, and I pull away. I run to the open window and jump.\n Dr. Kuzbari switches the visor and headphones off. My eyes burn as they adjust to the light in the room, in a foreign timeline. My joints ache in the Martian gravity.\n I sigh.\n I hate Mars.\n \u201cWhat did the doc say?\u201d Paul asks on the ride home. The weak Martian sun sets behind the passing trees in an autumnal blur. A Mango Tango crayon rolls across the floor mat.\n \u201cShe wants to run some tests. She thinks I\u2019m manipulating the machine, well, not me, my brain. She thinks my brain is controlling the shifts.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re in good hands with her. She\u2019s the leading expert in the field. Anyway, it won\u2019t be much longer. They\u2019re days away from calculating a solution to the rift. We could go home soon. To our own timeline.\u201d\n Home. I stare out the window at Phobos and Deimos. Pimples in the burned Martian sky.\n \u201cRemember when we lived on Earth?\u201d\n Paul intertwines our fingers and kisses my hand. The sight of his profile untangles my thoughts.\n \u201cIn another timeline?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s enough to know we were all together.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Jeannie yells from the backseat. We pick up a pizza and Jeannie recites all the new words she learned in school. We giggle when she mispronounces terrafoam and Valla Marinara. In every timeline, their laughter eclipses all my resentments until they shrink to asteroids crashing into the sun.\n A few days later, I\u2019m back at the Institute for another session. Beige walls close in on me. Dr. Kuzbari straps me to a gyroscopic chair. It\u2019s supposed to help with the nausea. Instead, I feel like an actor stuck on the set of a foreign horror movie.\n Lights, camera, shift, the sensation of being sucked through a straw.\n This seems familiar. I\u2019ve seen this in another timeline. My house. Again, we take off into the sky. Again, the agony of Joseph\u2019s goodbye. Then Jeannie and her domes. Paul and his love. I run to the window, swat the debris away like gnats, and jump through. But the transition doesn\u2019t save me.\n I fall and fall toward Earth, all blue and brown and cotton candy wrapped. Her gravity pulls me closer. The wind and cold penetrate my bones.\n \u201cAudra,\u201d Earth whispers. My name echoes on her breath and draws me in. I close my eyes and let her jet streams carry me.\n Paul catches me in mid-flight and jerks me upward. He wears a Superman cape. The symbol on his chest shines brighter than the sun. When I squint, a picture of our family emerges. I beg him not to take me back, but he pumps one fist in the air and heads toward the red dot in the sky while I struggle to break free.\n I am still screaming when Dr. Kuzbari removes my visor, and the rift spits me back into the lab. She loosens my restraints, brings me a glass of water, and waits for me to calm down, for my heart rate to slow, for my breathing to steady. Then she speaks.\n \u201cYou want to tell me what is happening with you?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cYou can tell me. Whatever it is.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home,\u201d I blurt out. She leans forward in her chair.\n \u201cA common sentiment among Outliers,\u201d she says. \u201cTell me, can you control your jumps?\u201d\n \u201cIs that possible?\u201d\n \u201cIs it?\u201d She leans back, disappointment oozing from her tone. She pauses, hesitant to say whatever itches at her.\n \u201cTell me about the man. The neighbor,\u201d she says at last.\n The words don\u2019t form. I gather my things.\n \u201cIf you find me, the old me, here at the Institute, will you talk to me? To her?\u201d\n \u201cThe neuropsychiatrist?\u201d I think on it but leave without answering.\n Once outside, I run and keep running. I can be home in fifteen minutes if I keep going, so I do. I run and run all the way to my street, and I collapse at Joseph\u2019s door. I knock, but he doesn\u2019t answer. I call but he doesn\u2019t pick up. I sit back against his door and cry. The rift squeezes my lungs, and I shift again.\n The koi fish play and chase each other until they swirl into a ribbon of color cutting through the pond. The ribbon coils around the bamboo trees and shoots into the sky like a drunken rainbow.\n Tears drip down my face, then hopscotch into the pond. Even if I could control the damned rift, what would I do? I can\u2019t split myself in half and live in familial bliss with Paul and Jeannie while my quantum twin dives into Joseph\u2019s bed and never again comes up for air. The two Audras would obliterate each other and create a black hole that swallows the entire universe.\n Paul pulls up and helps Jeannie out of the car. He shoos her inside before I can say hi.\n \u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d he asks, his accent thick and cartoonish.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say.\n \u201cYou scared me half to death. Doctor Kuzbari said you shouldn\u2019t be left alone.\u201d\n I don\u2019t disagree.\n Paul talks but I have trouble listening. I hear him say words like \u201cadverse effects\u201d and \u201cgravitational collapse,\u201d but all I can focus on is Joseph\u2019s door.\n \u201cAudra, are you listening to me?\u201d Paul snaps his fingers, and I look into his blue-gray eyes. I want to smooth the worry in his brow. To make our lives perfect again. He hugs me the way he does in my favorite timelines, and I don\u2019t pull away until he does.\n It\u2019s wrong, but sometimes I imagine Joseph when Paul makes love to me. I don\u2019t open my eyes until we are done. Afterward, I feel so guilty, I shower for forty-five minutes. But not in Martian timelines. On Mars, we use synthetic towels to scrub our skin to conserve water. You can get used to any timeline, Paul says. Nothing ever bothers him.\n On Earth, wisps of steam trail behind me as I step out of the bathroom. They follow me into the bedroom.\n \u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d Paul says. I crawl back into bed and fall asleep in the crook of his arm.\n A knock on the bedroom door wakes me deep in the night.\n \u201cMommy.\u201d Jeannie whimpers from behind the locked door.\n \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d Paul starts to get up.\n \u201cNo, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d I say.\n \u201cLet me. You need your rest.\u201d\n I\u2019m already up, bathrobe on. \u201cNext time.\u201d\n The dim light of the hallway forms long shadows on the hardwood, on the walls, on the ceiling. I pick Jeannie up and tell her that skinny giants are following us on the way to her room. They writhe and shrivel into the corners. Jeannie giggles and nuzzles her head in my neck. Her eyelashes tickle my skin, and her tears soak through my nightgown.\n \u201cI had a bad dream,\u201d she mumbles.\n \u201cMe too,\u201d I say and stroke her hair, rubbing the tangles between my fingers. I tuck her in and lie next to her. The shadows snake along the edges of the room.\n \u201cWhat did you dream, Mommy?\u201d\n \u201cI dreamed we lived on Mars, but it was too hot, and we all dried out and turned into dust.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s silly. It\u2019s always cold on Mars because the sun is too far away,\u201d Jeannie says. \u201cThe virgin sucks out all the heat.\u201d\n I hold back laughter. Shadows bobble and grin and drip from the windowsills and light fixtures. \u201cVirga,\u201d I correct her.\n \u201cI think the Virga is beautiful,\u201d she says and wiggles her tiny fingers to make pretend rain fall from the pretend sky.\n I wiggle my fingers with her, and the rift opens like a book. My muscles tense against its pull but relax when Jeannie snuggles against me. Her love is gravity and tethers me to her, to this timeline. Clouds form beneath the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. The temperature in the room drops to freezing. Our breath puffs out of our nostrils and mouths like steampunk robots. Brilliant snowflakes fall from the clouds but dissipate before touching us. \u201cVirga,\u201d I whisper.\n We watch the snow twinkle for a while until the rift closes, and we both fall asleep.\n Smells of bacon and coffee climb the stairs and wake me. I follow the scent to the kitchen and join Paul and Jeannie for family breakfast. We look like a cereal commercial.\n Except the scene is all askew. The walls tilt and the floorboards pulsate.\n \u201cHow do you want your eggs?\u201d Paul asks.\n \u201cOver easy,\u201d I say. But before the words leave my mouth, the steaming plate appears in front of me. I break the yolk with my fork, and it oozes and swirls onto the table and onto the floor and sparkles as it winds its way through the dining room to the living room and up the stairs. I want to follow it, but Paul stops me.\n \u201cWhere are you going? Aren\u2019t we going to talk about the R-I-F-T?\u201d\n \u201cDaddy, I know how to spell rift,\u201d Jeannie says and pouts at us.\n \u201cThe Institute has found a way to close it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can finally go back.\u201d\n Go back.\n The words echo and reverberate through the house. The egg yolk path glistens in my periphery and my fingertips tingle. Once the rift closes, we go back. Back to before the rift ruptured. Back to when Joseph first moved in and before we . . .\n Before.\n I have to tell Joseph.\n I excuse myself and follow the shining egg yolk toward the door. It loops around and goes up the stairs, but I ignore it and stumble out into the front yard. I look up and down the street, and I know I am looking for something. For a pond. But it\u2019s not there. Paul comes outside and takes my hand.\n \u201cWhat are you looking for, Audra?\u201d\n \u201cI think, a house. Wasn\u2019t there a house right there?\u201d I ask and point across the street to the slide and swings and monkey bars sprouting like time lapse weeds from the empty spot where Joseph\u2019s house stood yesterday.\n \u201cYou forgot again, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Paul says and smiles. The kind of smile I give Jeannie when she mixes up her left and right shoes.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. Maybe Joseph was always part of the rift. Maybe it\u2019s better this way and eventually I will forget he ever existed. Forget I ever wanted to tear my heart out and let him devour it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s always been this way, baby,\u201d Paul says and hugs me and walks me back into the house.\n Isn\u2019t this what I wanted? Without Joseph, everything fits. Everything makes sense. My life. My family. My place in the world. I am a good wife in this timeline. A good mother. I smile.\n \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I lie.\n The kitchen is still sideways. And the egg yolk path still beckons me upstairs.\n The Laser Lemon yolk breathes and whispers as it meanders up each step. I follow its glimmering trail until I reach Jeannie\u2019s bedroom door. A blinding white light flashes through the cracks. I put my hand on the knob, but I don\u2019t turn it.\n If I turn the knob, this world will melt away. If I turn around, I can stay here. Jeannie and Paul call my name from behind the door. They yell, scream, \u201cAudra!\u201d \u201cMommy!\u201d\n I turn the knob and walk through the barrier of light, but Paul and Jeannie aren\u2019t there. I am. I am asleep in Jeannie\u2019s bed. I run over to my sleeping self and shake her.\n \u201cWake up, Audra,\u201d I say.\n She opens her eyes, and we collide into another timeline together.\n Dr. Kuzbari\u2019s neuropsychiatric office is small and dark. A sliver of window. A yellowing vine on the sill. Dust caresses the overflowing bookshelves. The room smells of oiled brass and turmeric. She walks in with two mugs and hands me one, then sits with the cup in front of her as the steam obscures her face.\n \u201cAre you ready to tell me about the man?\u201d\n I breathe in the spiced tea and take a sip. It burns my tongue.\n \u201cHe\u2019s my neighbor. We haven\u2019t . . . We haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional affair?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not love,\u201d I clarify.\n \u201cLust then? That\u2019s certainly simpler.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d I blow on my tea to cool it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a worm that has burrowed its way into my stomach and claws and bites me until I feed it moments with him.\u201d\n \u201cLimerence,\u201d she says. \u201cNot so simple after all.\u201d\n We sit in silence and sip our teas for a minute.\n \u201cIn my timeline, you\u2019re a famous neurophysicist. You\u2019ll close the rift.\u201d\n She smirks as her eyes search the distance. I wonder which timeline she would prefer if given the choice. Her face turns solemn. She leans forward. Pushes her mug aside. \u201cYou can have him,\u201d she says.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cYou can have the man, the neighbor, in this timeline and every other, if that is what you want.\u201d\n \u201cBut?\u201d\n \u201cNo but. You can choose him.\u201d\n \u201cBut I\u2019ll lose my family.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n No.\n A frayed thread tickles my neck like Jeannie\u2019s lashes. I tug and the rift unravels.\n I jump through razor wire to another dimension.\n Smells of bacon and coffee climb the stairs and wake me. I follow the scent to the kitchen and join Paul and Jeannie for family breakfast.\n \u201cHow do you want your eggs?\u201d Paul asks.\n \u201cOver easy,\u201d I say. \u201cNo, wait.\u201d This is all wrong. \u201cDon\u2019t we need to talk about L-O-V-E?\u201d\n Jeannie pouts at me.\n \u201cWhat about?\u201d Paul says.\n Something is stuck in my throat, and I can\u2019t respond. I get up from the table and run out the front door across the street to Joseph\u2019s. I knock and ring the bell and knock again, and he answers, but I can\u2019t breathe, and I can\u2019t tell him what I think because my mind is all pictures and colors and the light from outside is so very bright that I can\u2019t see.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Audra? Tell me. Please tell me,\u201d Joseph says with his hands around my shoulders, searching with his eyes, and it\u2019s his face when he makes love to me in my imagination.\n \u201cI want to stay with you, but I can\u2019t,\u201d I say and collapse into his arms, and I sob as he cradles me back and forth and runs his fingers through my hair.\n \u201cStay with me,\u201d he says. \u201cStay.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t go.\u201d\n \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n I walk back to my house and lock myself in the upstairs bathroom. I run hot water in the bath and the sink until steam covers the mirror, and I can no longer see my reflection.\n I must find a way to be with Joseph and with Paul and with Jeannie. Surely, there are dimensions where I have unbounded wealth, fame, superpowers. Dimensions where I can destroy worlds or build them. Where I can live forever. If I can just focus and keep the rift open long enough, I can find a way to keep them all.\n Paul knocks on the door.\n \u201cTalk to me, Audra,\u201d he says. His voice is distorted, so I turn off the faucets to hear him better, but I don\u2019t unlock the door.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Water droplets snake down the mirror and plop into the standing water. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n \u201cSure you do. Let me in, baby.\u201d\n The faucets drip. It sounds like the world after rain.\n \u201cI just need a little more time.\u201d\n \u201cThe man across the street.\u201d There\u2019s pain and hesitation in his voice. \u201cAre you . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cNo, never,\u201d I say. \u201cIn any of the timelines, I swear.\u201d\n \u201cBecause I would understand. He\u2019s more like you. I mean, you know what I mean. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not like that. But I know you. I know you love your family. I love you so much, Audra. I\u2019ve loved you since I was fourteen years old. You\u2019re the only woman I ever loved, and I don\u2019t know how to save us, but I\u2019ll find a way.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t need to save us, Paul. You\u2019re not Superman.\u201d\n \u201cI know. I know. Will you let me in?\u201d\n \u201cGo away, please. I want to be alone.\u201d\n \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be here whenever you\u2019re ready to come out. I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d\n I wait until his footsteps fade away. I peek under the door to check, and see Jeannie\u2019s eye staring back at me.\n \u201cMommy, are you okay?\u201d\n \u201cYes, baby, I\u2019m taking a bath.\u201d\n \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I can see your feet.\u201d\n I smile.\n \u201cI made you a picture.\u201d She slides it under the door.\n Me, Paul, and Jeannie in front of our house. She\u2019s starting to grasp perspective and shadow. Much better than I did at her age.\n I cry and let the tears of pride, of shame, evaporate in the steam as my heart squeezes out its last shard of resistance.\n The rift pulses in my ears and opens doors to lives where Joseph and I dance in orbit around each other. Cold lives where nothing shines except when we are together. And even then, the heat we generate is tepid. Like putting a hand in the fireplace and finding fake fire, plastic wood, glass embers. Lives where I am never truly satisfied. Not without Paul and Jeannie.\n Without them, I\u2019m a shell made up of sketches and vinyl records and yellowed pages. Without them, I am empty.\n It\u2019s impossible. There is no dimension or timeline before or after the rift where I get to have them all. But there are an infinity of timelines where Paul loves me, where Jeannie came from my body and inherited my love of art. Where I am loved whole, shell and brain and sinew. None of those timelines include Joseph.\n I step into the tub and submerge myself. The water washes away the murk swirling in my brain and the rift shines white like a blank canvas. I breathe out and the air bubbles paint a door. I step through.\n Dr. Kuzbari operates the rift machine. Paul stands off to the side, but I know he is there. I know he will see everything on the monitors.\n \u201cSee you at home, Mommy,\u201d Jeannie says.\n The straps around my waist and my wrists are loose. Kuzbari\u2019s got me hooked to an oxygen mask and an IV and a host of machines. A thousand electrodes protrude from my head.\n \u201cAlright, Mrs. Cobb, we are ready, how about you?\u201d says the doc, resting the visor on my forehead.\n \u201cBlast off,\u201d I say.\n \u201cGodspeed,\u201d she whispers in Earth\u2019s voice.\n I close my eyes and let the beige walls fall away one last time.\n My street stretches in a slight curve to the west. The sun sets behind a group of mismatched houses and trees, old and tall. Spanish moss hangs in thick curtains from the branches. The sky is all the colors of Jupiter at once soaked in summer air.\n Joseph stands at the edge of his koi pond. I want to go to him. To lose myself for hours in comics and music and carelessness. To yearn and drown in the yearning, suspended in the margin between despair and wild abandon, a space where happiness always lies beyond the horizon. But the waning light from the sun shines on my house and leaves Joseph\u2019s in the dark. So, I go home.\n As I step inside, the rift closes behind me and melts away.\n Colored pencils roll across the kitchen table. Jeannie\u2019s tongue sticks out as she adds sunglasses to the yellow sun.\n \u201cThat\u2019s clever, Jeannie.\u201d I breathe in her scent as I kiss the top of her head. She smells of home.\n Paul comes in and kisses me.\n \u201cDid you see our new neighbor is diggin\u2019 a pond?\u201d Paul shakes his head. \u201cImagine the mosquitoes!\u201d\n \u201cCan we get pizza for dinner?\u201d Jeannie asks.\n Something catches in my throat, but it\u2019s gone in a blink along with trillions of memories."}

Sun Ra might be considered the archetype that later musicians have followed. The twin themes of oppressive social alienation and ecstatic personal liberation run deep in both his music and his lyrics. As he had players chant about flying to other planets, he also asked them to play without much regard for conventional ideas of tonality or harmony. Where some ears would find dissonance, confusion, or cacophony in his music and his message, he found transcendence. And he wore the outlandish costumes to prove it.\nSun Ra was controversial at first, but he lived long enough to see others pick up the same thread he did, and make it thicker. Stevie Wonder did it, most obviously in the song \u201cSaturn.\u201d Musically, so did Alice Coltrane, Miles Davis when he went electric, and Herbie Hancock as he experimented with synthesizers. Even Earth, Wind & Fire and The 5th Dimension played with science fiction themes. Perhaps most important, you can hear it, and see it, all over Parliament-Funkadelic, who, in a streak of work that spanned the 1970s\u2014from Mothership Connection and Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome to Cosmic Slop and One Nation Under a Groove and beyond\u2014took Sun Ra\u2019s ideas and ran as far with them as they could. It\u2019s not just their outrageous costumes, or their cover art, at once playful and disorienting. Like Sun Ra, P. Funk talks about alienation and liberation, with a lot more emphasis on the latter, and from album to album builds up a complex mythology and cast of characters that draws heavily from comics, cartoons, and especially science fiction. The singers ride atop music that is often dizzyingly complex, yet immediately accessible, because P. Funk never forgot to make it ridiculously fun and ferociously groovy. If Sun Ra made the formula, you could say that P. Funk brought it to the masses.\nAfter P. Funk, it\u2019s all over. Parliament-Funkadelic is one of the most sampled bands in hip hop, and lots of artists have explicitly followed in P. Funk\u2019s footsteps, marrying science fiction to music and carrying the themes of alienation and liberation still further, from Afrika Bambaataa and Del the Funky Homosapien to OutKast and Kelis. And while Sun Ra was considered on the fringes of jazz when he began\u2014on his own musical planet\u2014science fiction has become much more mainstream in black music since then. Michael Jackson visited it a few times in the second half of his career, and Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, and Kayne West are no strangers to the genre. The long-running thread that Sun Ra unspooled is thicker than ever, fat enough to walk on. Like a tightrope. Which is where Janelle Mon\u00e1e comes in.\nI-I-I-I-I I\u2019m an alien from outer space\nI\u2019m a cyber girl without a face . . .\n\u2014from \u201cViolet Stars Happy Hunting!\u201d\nThese are the first words we hear Janelle Mon\u00e1e sing on her first release, the 2007 EP Metropolis. Those Is are sung almost like they\u2019re record scratches, but also like she\u2019s powering up. From the first second, the music is tightly wound and the alienation so strong that the forces gathering against the singer are almost genocidal: \u201cI\u2019m a slave girl without a race,\u201d she sings, \u201con the run \u2019cause they\u2019re here to erase and chase out my kind.\u201d The song plunges us into an elaborate backstory described in the album\u2019s liner notes. It\u2019s the year 2719, and after five world wars and ecological catastrophe, only one city remains, called Metropolis. The debt to Fritz Lang is acknowledged loudly, as Mon\u00e1e\u2019s Metropolis is a place of decadent haves and desperate have-nots, with the twist that the conflicts aren\u2019t just between classes, but ethnicities and cultures. It\u2019s a rough place. But like the mythological New York that exists in songs and movies, people still keep coming, because Metropolis just happens to be one of those places where, even after the collapse of civilization, you can still make it big.\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s persona in this world is an android named Cindi Mayweather with a \u201crock-star proficiency package and a working soul.\u201d This makes her a fantastic performer, cutting-edge to the point of revolution; it also leads her to break the rules of Metropolis dictating that \u201candroids shall never know love\u2014especially with a human,\u201d as she, a have-not, falls in love with a have, Anthony Greendown, \u201cwith the eyes of the world watching her.\u201d This crime, by Metropolis law, is a capital offense, and as word spreads of what Mayweather has done, she goes on the run, into hiding, underground, pursued by bounty hunters, aliens, and ghosts intent on killing her, even as she becomes a symbol for the have-nots in Metropolis for everything that\u2019s wrong with the city\u2019s system and what can be done to overcome it.\nAs mentioned above, the name of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s last human city is totally intentional. When asked about her use of science fiction, she told Bust in July 2013 that:\nI would always watch The Twilight Zone with my grandmother, and I knew about Star Wars and things. But when I met [my producing partners] Chuck Lightning and Nate Wonder, they got me into Isaac Asimov, artificial intelligence, and cybernetics. Chuck asked me to watch Metropolis, and I was like, wow. I saw the parallels between growing up in Kansas City and the have-nots living underground, working for the haves. That constant struggle was something I could identify with because my parents worked day and night, trying to make a living. I thought science fiction was a great way of talking about the future. It doesn\u2019t make people feel like you\u2019re talking about things that are happening right now, so they don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re talking down to them. It gives the listener a different perspective.\nThe dark world and tension within it that Mon\u00e1e creates fuels not only Metropolis: The Chase Suite, but (so far) all Mon\u00e1e\u2019s output, 2010\u2019s The ArchAndroid and 2013\u2019s The Electric Lady, which expand on and elaborate the story, drawing in references to Philip K. Dick and James Cameron\u2019s Terminator films\u2014her antecedents in dealing with androids\u2014along the way. In the science-fiction world, she knows she\u2019s standing on some big shoulders, and she\u2019s taken on more material from the genre than most of her musical predecessors. Her contribution, to music and to science fiction, and following Stevie Wonder and Parliament, is to balance the heaviness of the material with some of the fleetest, most joyful, and most uplifting music being written in the pop idiom today.\nIt begins with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s voice, an instrument that seems to be able to do nearly anything she wants it to do. She can coo and swing, belt it out, screech when she needs to; she can do a melisma with the best of them, but knows when to hit the notes square, too. She has great flow when she raps. Pulling the versatility together is Mon\u00e1e\u2019s energetic delivery, sometimes coiled, sometimes unleashed, but always present, and a lead vocal like that gives Mon\u00e1e, Chuck Lightning, and Nate Wonder the chance to create arrangements that follow suit. Everything moves, textures shift, instruments switch out from song to song and sometimes within songs. The music bristles with the same restless intelligence that drives Mon\u00e1e. It bursts with ideas, and at the same time, it is deeply funky.\nIt\u2019s fun to analyze, but it\u2019s even more fun to dance to, and Mon\u00e1e\u2019s approach has earned her both fans and rapturous reviews. Writing for Pitchfork, Matthew Perpetua called The ArchAndroid \u201cabout as bold as mainstream music gets . . . . The first listen is mostly about being wowed by the very existence of this fabulously talented young singer and her over-the-top record; every subsequent spin reveals the depths of her achievement.\u201d Jayson Greene called Electric Lady \u201ca show-stopping display of force and talent.\u201d \u201cBehold,\u201d Michael Cregg stated of The ArchAndroid in The Guardian, \u201cpop music has found its latest superstar\u201d; Alexis Petridis wrote that \u201cat its best, The Electric Lady is audacious, intrepid, and brilliantly executed.\u201d She has found fans within the science fiction community as well. Writer and music critic Jason Heller calls her \u201cone of the most important artists in pop right now\u201d; \u201cwhat I love most about her style,\u201d he says, \u201cis the swaggering sureness of her belief that SF can be written, and written well, in any medium imaginable.\u201d Writer Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older says that \u201cArchAndroid and Electric Lady incorporate so many elements we spec fic writers strive for: world building, character development, inner and outer conflicts, sharp social and political analysis, escalating moods and movements, violent crossroads of the future and past . . . As writers, we could learn a lot from Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\u201d\nStriking the balance isn\u2019t always easy, though, and Mon\u00e1e has had her detractors. She\u2019s been called overly ambitious; writing in Rolling Stone about Electric Lady, Jon Dolan argued that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to admire an artist who can cut through the weight of her own pretensions,\u201d but then nonetheless stated that \u201cwith Janelle Mon\u00e1e, the pretensions are pretty impressive\u201d\u2014and this was in a positive review. Declaring The ArchAndroid to be \u201cthe most overrated album of the year,\u201d Robert Christgau said of Mon\u00e1e that \u201call she can do well is dance\u2014her songwriting is 60th percentile, her singing technical, her sci-fi plot the usual rot.\u201d Jody Rosen declared Electric Lady to be \u201can intermittently thrilling failure,\u201d and regarding her use of science fiction, he saw \u201cnothing much of interest in Mon\u00e1e\u2019s muddled story line\u2014certainly none of the eerie tragicomedy of Sun Ra and P. Funk\u2019s space explorations.\u201d Writing in Slate about The ArchAndroid\u2014and the following statement is a little weird, since, unless there are two music critics named Jody Rosen, he gave the album a generally positive review in Rolling Stone\u2014he stated further that:\nMon\u00e1e [and Erykah Badu] . . . want to be geniuses, and they want to do it the easy way, by shortcut\u2014by tossing together Afro-futurist theology, \u201970s soul, and other hallowed styles and signifiers, and insisting that it all adds up to something transcendent. It pains me that so many smart critics have fallen for music that's so slapdash and self-impressed.\n\u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d he asked.\nWhen you get elevated\nThey love it or they hate it\nYou dance up on them haters\nKeep getting funky on the scene\n\u2014from \u201cTightrope\u201d\nThe response of Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s predecessors to the themes of alienation and liberation has been a kind of all-out exuberance, from Sun Ra\u2019s polyphony to P. Funk\u2019s non-stop party. It\u2019s not just in the music, either; it\u2019s in the lyrics, the stage persona, the costumes that let the audience know, in no uncertain terms, that they are dealing with a person from another planet, even if it\u2019s just a metaphor. They explore the themes together, and push them out.\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s move, though certainly exuberant, is different. As Jayson Greene said in Pitchfork, \u201cher music has always been about the exhilaration coming from the sensation of total control.\u201d The songs are full of energy, but never wild; tightly coiled, never slack. Her contribution\u2014musically and thematically\u2014is to place alienation and liberation against one another in a way not quite done before, and then to balance her work directly on the tension between them. This balance, for Mon\u00e1e, is personal, artistic, even political. When Nisha Gopalan asked Mon\u00e1e in Vulture about her father\u2019s substance abuse and how it shaped her, she responded:\nWell, first, my father is clean. He\u2019s sober. He had hard time. I was able to see firsthand what drugs do. I learned a lot from my dad. I learned how to be resilient, how to not hold on to the past. He\u2019s so much better, and I\u2019m so proud of him: where\u2019s he\u2019s been, where he comes from, and where he is now. And it also made me want to write music. I was really inspired by the highs and lows of life. In this industry, there\u2019s so many highs and lows. So I have to remain balanced, with my head held high.\nAnd before performing for Barack Obama in support of his reelection in 2012, she stated:\nI wrote \u201cTightrope\u201d because it talks about dealing with balance\u2014don\u2019t get too high, don\u2019t get too low. And that\u2019s one of the things that I\u2019ve noticed about President Obama.\nThis personal, aesthetic, and political use of balance points toward a way forward, not only for Mon\u00e1e as she continues to develop her work, but for fellow musicians and science-fiction creators. As Heller says, \u201cthere aren\u2019t many authors working right now who seem to understand that they can marry a sense of adventure, kinetic crackle, and giddy fun to all the stoic, weighty conceptual stuff.\u201d Mon\u00e1e is doing it; we can, too. All we have to do is do it.\nSo when Rosen says that Mon\u00e1e \u201cwants to be a genius,\u201d he isn\u2019t so much \u201cmissing\u201d something as reading too much into it. So am I, in this essay, when I freight her music with all this abstract rhetorical baggage. Mon\u00e1e may get down, but she\u2019s also just getting to work. She\u2019s not just making a fashion statement by always appearing in a tuxedo. It\u2019s her uniform. As she said at a BET awards ceremony,\nWhen I started my music career, I was a maid. I used to clean houses. My mother was a proud janitor. My stepfather, who raised me like his very own, worked at the post office and my father was a trashman. They all wore uniforms and that\u2019s why I stand here today, in my black and white, and I wear my uniform to honor them. This is a reminder that I have work to do. I have people to uplift. I have people to inspire.\nAnd it works. As Nora Jemisin writes,\nIt\u2019s easy to look at something like Mon\u00e1e\u2019s mythos and see only the obvious metaphors . . . . But it\u2019s wrong to apply only an historical, and racial, lens to the work of any modern black woman. We have spent generations sharing the struggles of other oppressed groups, collaborating with and occasionally being betrayed by them, and progressing nonetheless.\nAs dystopian as the albums\u2019 backstory is, Jemisin continues,\nIt\u2019s clear that Mon\u00e1e feels no sense of threat from the others with whom our future will be shared. She welcomes all, with love and dancing . . . . I\u2019m not sure this future is the kind of place I\u2019d want to live in, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t mind visiting. And for as long as Janelle Mon\u00e1e is willing to offer my imagination this kind of gleeful romp, I\u2019ll keep coming back.\nWhen she hears \u201cTightrope,\u201d she says, \u201cI can\u2019t listen to [it] without dancing. I\u2019m a terrible dancer but I don\u2019t care. I lose myself in it because Mon\u00e1e\u2019s magic is for everybody.\u201d\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s just working, and it works. Which might be the most inspiring thing of all."}

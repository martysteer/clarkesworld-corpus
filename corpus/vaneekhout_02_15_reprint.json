When the doors hiss open, the tar smell washes over me. Thick and ancient, it snakes through my sinuses and settles in the back of my brain like a ghost in the attic.\n\u201cGet off or stay on,\u201d the driver says, impatient. So I step off into the haunted air.\nThe walk to Farmer\u2019s Market is too short. Not enough time for me to change my mind. For a moment, I wonder if looking at my wallet photo of Miranda would give me some more courage. I know every detail by heart: She\u2019s smiling and squinting into the camera, her face sun-dappled and brilliant. The ice cream cone I bought her on her third birthday is a pink smear across her face.\nIt\u2019s easier to think of her that way than to contemplate the handkerchief inside my bowling bag and the small bone contained within its linen folds.\nI put my head down and keep walking, entering a maze of stalls and awnings, of narrow paths crowded with bins and baskets and little old ladies with sharp elbows. Shopping carts bark my shins and roll over my toes. Ranchero music and some kind of Southeast Asian pop bounces off my head.\n\u201cHey you got problem?\u201d A man behind the counter beckons with a hooked finger, his face brown and creased like a cinnamon stick. \u201cYou got problem, yeah. I can tell. I got just what you need.\u201d With a knife, he sweeps bright orange dust into a little paper envelope. It looks that the dehydrated cheese powder that comes with instant macaroni.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask.\nHis smile reveals several gold teeth. \u201cCome from dragon turtle. You see giant dragon turtle wash up in San Diego? You see that on news?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not really up on current events.\u201d Especially not as regurgitated by state-controlled news organizations.\nHe nods enthusiastically and edges more powder into the envelope. \u201cThis come from San Diego dragon turtle. Wife\u2019s younger brother, he lifeguard. He scrape some turtle shell before Hierarch\u2019s men confiscate whole carcass.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it for?\u201d I ask, indicating the powder-filled envelope.\n\u201cAll sorts of stuff. Rheumatism, kidney stones, migraine, epilepsy, bedroom problems . . . All sorts.\u201d\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say as I try to shoulder my way back into the crowd.\n\u201cGet you girls,\u201d he calls after me. \u201cMake you animal! Guaranteed!\u201d\nDragon turtle can\u2019t do any of those things, of course. Not that it\u2019s genuine turtle he\u2019s selling. I figure it for flour and sulfur, with maybe the tiniest pinch of rhinoceros horn thrown in. You can\u2019t even put a street value on the genuine stuff these days.\nI know. I\u2019ve experienced the genuine stuff. It\u2019s in my bones.\nOne Sunday afternoon I found a piece of kraken spine while walking down Santa Monica Beach with Dad. It was a cold day, the sand a sloping plain of gray beneath a slate sky, and we were both underdressed for the weather. But it was Sunday, the one day of the week we had together, and I had wanted to go the beach.\nI spotted the spine in the receding foam of the surf. It was just a fragment, like a knitting needle, striped honey and black. I showed it to Dad.\n\u201cGood eye,\u201d he said, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t see many of these outside a locked vault.\u201d In his white shirt and gray slacks, he looked like one of the seagulls wheeling overhead. I imagined him spreading his long arms to catch the wind and float to the sky.\nI, on the other hand, took after my mom\u2014short and stocky, skin just a shade paler than terra cotta. \u201cYour father is made of air,\u201d Mom once told me. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s so hard to understand; he\u2019s not always down here with us. But you and me, kid, you and me are plain as dirt.\u201d\nDad held out his hand for the spine. \u201cKraken live in the deeps,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hunt for giant squid and sperm whale. Sometimes, in a fight, the spines break off and they wash ashore.\u201d He smelled the spine, inhaling so deeply it was almost an act of aggression. \u201cYou\u2019ve found good bone, Daniel. Better than mammoth tusk.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d John Blackland had never been known to lavish idle praise.\n\u201cBetter than all the La Brea stuff, in fact. The kraken is even older. Smarter.\u201d\nI waited while my father\u2019s thoughts followed their own silent paths. Then, brightly, he told me to find a shell. \u201cAbalone would be perfect, but I\u2019ll take anything from the sea I can use as a crucible.\u201d\nWithin a few minutes I\u2019d located half a mussel shell. We sat on the sand, the shell between us, and Dad cooked the tip of the kraken spine over the flame of his Zippo. Thin tendrils of smoke rose from the spine, smelling of salt and earth and dark, deep mud.\nWhen a single drop of honey-colored fluid oozed from the tip of the spine into the shell, Dad killed the flame. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cGood. Now, do like me.\u201d He lifted the shell to his mouth and lightly touched his tongue to the fluid. I did the same. It burned, but not more than a too-hot mug of cocoa. The oil tasted exactly as it smelled, like something that had come from dark and forgotten places, but also from inside me.\n\u201cQuick, now, Daniel. Hold my hand.\u201d\nFor a few moments, the waves crashed ashore and the gulls cried overhead and I shivered in the cold. Then it started. A prickling sensation ran across my skin, raising goose bumps. The tiny hairs on my arms stood at attention. Then, popping in my body, as though my blood were carbonated. It hurt, and I felt it in my lips and eyes, a million pinpricks.\nI looked at Dad. His face was a blur. He was actually vibrating, and I realized I was, too, and he smiled at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he said, his voice shuddering. \u201cTrust me.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t afraid. Or, rather, the scared part of me was smaller than the part that was thrilled at the power of my father, the power of the kraken, the power inside me.\nLightning struck. Silver-white, cracking bursts.\nPain filled me. I screamed, desperately trying to let some of it out, but there was only more. My body was a sponge for it, with limitless capacity. Pain replaced everything.\nWhen my world finally stilled and my eyes could once again see, Dad and I were surrounded by a moat of liquefied sand. Black, gooey glass smoked and bubbled.\n\u201cThe kraken is a creature of storms,\u201d Dad said. \u201cNow, a part that will always rage inside you. That\u2019s the osteomancer\u2019s craft: To draw magic from bones, to infuse it into your own.\u201d He looked at me a long time, as if to see if I understood.\nThe pain was over, but the memory of it roiled inside and around me, like smoke from a fire.\nTrust me, he\u2019d said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell your mom about this. That kraken spine could have paid for your college education.\u201d\nFarther back in the recesses of Farmer\u2019s Market, closer to the Tar Pits, the smell of asphalt clogs the air. Black ooze seeps through cracks in the alley, and when I walk, my shoes stick to the ground. There\u2019s black tar under the pavement. Pockets of gas lurk beneath the sidewalks like jellyfish.\nStorage sheds and small warehouses line the alley, guarded by guys, teenagers, just a few years younger than me. They conceal their hands in the pockets of their roomy pants and watch me make my way down a row of cinderblock structures. I stop before a building with a steel roll-down door, and four guards converge on me, forming a diamond with me at the center.\n\u201cYou must be lost,\u201d one says.\nThey all have eyes the color of coffee ice cream and the same face. Not just similar in appearance, but identical. Maybe they\u2019re quadruplets, but more likely they\u2019re mirror-spawn. It takes pretty deep magic to create them, but when it comes to the Hierarch and his interests, no expense is ever spared. These guys aren\u2019t just rent-a-cop security. These guys are weapons.\n\u201cAre these warehouses?\u201d I say, waving vaguely at the buildings around us.\nThe four share a look and nod in unison.\n\u201cThen I think I\u2019m in the right place.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d have been better off lost,\u201d says the one behind me. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bowling bag?\u201d\n\u201cA bowling ball.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind?\u201d\n\u201cBrunswick.\u201d That\u2019s the name written on the bag.\n\u201cI like to bowl,\u201d they all say together. Then, just the one behind me: \u201cLet\u2019s take a peek inside.\u201d\nTwo of them unzip the bag, while the other two keep their eyes on me. I reach into my coat pocket and all four get ready to pounce. \u201cRelax,\u201d I say, pulling out my leather glasses case. \u201cJust putting on my shades.\u201d\nWhich, really, is all I do.\nFrowns form on the faces of the four mirror-spawn. They blink. They work their lips a little. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d they all ask of each other.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d they all decide.\nTheir diamond formation loosens, and they go back to whatever they were doing before I showed up. I take my bowling bag and continue looking for the right warehouse.\nWhen my first baby tooth fell out I tucked it under my pillow, just as Mom had told me to. The next morning the tooth was gone but I found no coin. Mom and Dad were arguing in the living room. I wanted to go out and see Dad, but not until the fight was over.\nI read some comics.\nI glued plastic tusks on my Revel Colombian Mammoth model.\nWith my tongue, I probed the empty socket where my tooth had been.\nFinally, the noise in the other room died down, and I heard the front door open and shut. Moments later, a car started and drove away: Dad going back to his apartment.\n\u201cFrom now on,\u201d Mom said, standing in the doorway, \u201cwhen you lose a tooth, put it in an envelope for your father.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\nShe gripped the doorjamb so tight her hand shook. \u201cSo he can eat them.\u201d\nBy that age, I already knew Dad worked for the Hierarch\u2014the most powerful osteomancer of all\u2014and I knew that made my father a very important man.\nIt wasn\u2019t until years later, until after the Night of Long Knives, that I knew Dad was a traitor.\nThis, I found out from Uncle Otis, my father\u2019s brother, who took me in after Dad was murdered and Mom defected to Northern California.\nI\u2019d left Otis when I turned sixteen and had nearly no contact with him until two weeks ago. I knew he helped out Connie and Miranda with money, dropped in on their little apartment in Boyle Heights to make sure they were okay, but I\u2019d never asked him to do that and I refused to be grateful.\nThe door jingled as I entered his shop for the first time in seven years.\n\u201cYou never got tall,\u201d he said by way of greeting.\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. On a stool behind a glass display counter of jewelry and cigarette cases and Zippo lighters sat a thin-shouldered man in a sweater the color of wilted lettuce. He gave me a smile with his lipless turtle mouth and took a sip from a Dodgers coffee mug.\n\u201cNice to meet you, Daniel.\u201d\nI took note of the turtle man\u2019s skin, teeth, fingernails. They were by no means healthy colors, but neither were they the deeply embedded telltale brown of a practicing osteomancer. I figured him for a supplier, like Otis.\nI should have turned around, gone back home. Trafficking in osteomancy had been a bad idea since the Night of Long Knives\u2014I was surprised Otis hadn\u2019t been caught yet\u2014and I always got the feeling the Hierarch\u2019s eyes were on me, being the son of John Blackland.\nOtis tried to introduce me to the turtle man. \u201cDaniel, this is Mr.\u2014\u201d But the turtle man cut him off with a sharp look. Otis settled on telling me he was a friend of my father\u2019s.\nI took \u201cfriend\u201d as a codeword for former co-conspirator. Dad had been a darling of the Hierarch until he\u2019d decided there was too much power concentrated in the Hierarch\u2019s hands, and he hadn\u2019t been alone in this belief. Magic wants to be free. But after the Night of Long Knives, what had been the seeds of a revolution had degenerated into merely a black market for osteomantic materials. Now, it was just about skimming a bit off the Hierarch\u2019s profit.\nI wanted no part of it. Not a sliver. But there was the lure of money and pangs about how little I was doing for Miranda. \u201cIs this a bag job?\u201d\nOtis nodded. \u201cThe sort of thing you\u2019re good at.\u201d\nI had kept myself out of the family business, but that didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d been walking the straight and narrow. Part of the reason I\u2019d left Otis\u2019s care was because I felt he wasn\u2019t dealing fairly with me when fencing stuff I\u2019d boosted from houses and businesses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky job, in a place hard to get into and even harder to get out of.\u201d\n\u201cGovernment warehouse, I suppose?\u201d Which was tantamount to a suicide mission.\nThe turtle man looked at me with dark eyes. I recognized that look. In his head, he was stripping me of clothing and skin. He was wondering what my skeleton looked like. \u201cIt\u2019s not just any government warehouse, Daniel. We\u2019re sending you into the Ossuary itself.\u201d\nThe Ossuary. The dragon\u2019s greatest treasure trove. The Hierarch\u2019s own private stash.\nI didn\u2019t bother explaining what an impossible task that would be. These guys were veterans. They wouldn\u2019t risk exposure in a pointless exercise. But they would risk my life to get their hands on the Hierach\u2019s riches.\nI, on the other hand, would not. \u201cThanks, Otis,\u201d I said, turning my back and heading for the door. \u201cDon\u2019t call me ever again.\u201d\nI heard the turtle man\u2019s coffee cup clank against the glass counter. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even heard our terms.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to,\u201d I said. \u201cMy daughter deserves a living father.\u201d\n\u201cDaniel, I have something for you.\u201d I stopped and watched Otis place a folded handkerchief on the glass counter. The look on his face was infinitely sad as he peeled back the corners of the handkerchief and revealed a small distal phalanx. A finger bone. A child\u2019s finger bone, not white, but already turning brown. The bone of a child who has been fed bone. When I was a kid, that\u2019s what my bones would have looked like, because even then, Dad was preparing me.\n\u201cIt belongs to Miranda,\u201d the turtle man said. \u201cDo the job or we\u2019ll piece her out, bit by bit.\u201d\nDad lived in the back of his osteomancer\u2019s shop, and that\u2019s where I spent most of my time with him during weekend visits. Six years after that afternoon on the beach, I was in his workroom, watching a pair of horn-rimmed glasses bob inside a kettle of boiling oil. The lenses were blanks, but the frames were special, carved from the vertebrae of a Choctaw sint holo serpent. I was certain that Dad didn\u2019t have legal access to such materials. He\u2019d probably obtained it in one of the back-alley exchanges he\u2019d become increasingly involved with. Things had been different for him, lately. Once one of the Hierarch\u2019s chief men, he was more and more on the fringes of things.\nDad stirred the oil with a copper spoon, sniffing the vapors that rose from the pot. He quizzed me: \u201cAny idea what these glasses will do?\u201d\nI was bored. Only eight blocks away there was a mall full of video games and CD\u2019s to shoplift and girls. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time Dad and I had talked about anything other than bones and oils and feathers and powders. Dad\u2019s world was full of dead things that stank.\n\u201cI have no idea what they do,\u201d I said. It was true, but it wasn\u2019t what Dad wanted to hear.\nHe breathed a small sigh. \u201cSmell it, Daniel. You can tell by smell. Smells are ghosts. Let them in and they\u2019ll talk to you.\u201d\nHe wouldn\u2019t give up until I did as he asked, so, sullenly, I admitted the phantoms. Figuring out what they were trying to tell me was a process requiring the kind of patience and attention I could seldom be bothered to exhibit. I lowered my nose to the kettle.\nFirst, there were my father\u2019s tells, not just because he was in the room, but because the kettle contained his magic. There was clean sweat. Old Spice. And tar. Deeply embedded, way down to the marrow of Dad\u2019s bones. My father\u2019s living ghost. And also something of me. Maybe some of my baby teeth. The smells were all mixed up, and I couldn\u2019t tell where he ended and I began.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Dad whispered, bending close to my ear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like . . . something I can\u2019t hold onto. Like confusion.\u201d\nDad straightened. \u201cIt\u2019s in your bones, now, Daniel. You know how to let the old bones inside you. You only need to listen to them, and they\u2019ll tell you how to do whatever you need to do. That\u2019s osteomancy. That\u2019s deep magic.\u201d He gestured at his work counter, littered with jars and vials and little envelopes. \u201cAll else is merely recipe.\u201d\nFrom outside, the sound of a helicopter rotor pounded the air. The phone rang. Dad went to the front room to answer it, and I stayed behind, eavesdropping on his conversation.\n\u201cNot a good time, Otis.\u201d Then, his voice dropped. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got something cooking right now.\u201d\nThe sound of the helicopter grew closer, and now it sounded as though there were more than one. I went to the door and saw the look on Dad\u2019s face, the way the lines deepened, the haunted shadows of his eyes. \u201cWho else did they get?\u201d he said into the receiver, craning his neck to peer out the living room window. Dad listened to whatever Otis\u2019s answer was, his eyes shut tight. When he opened them, he saw me standing in the doorway. \u201cWill you take care of him, Otis? Will you promise me?\u201d There was a pause, and then he put the receiver back in its cradle.\nOut on the street, car doors slammed. Dad came over to the workroom doorway and pushed me back inside. \u201cThe glasses aren\u2019t ready yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWait as long as you can before putting them on. Don\u2019t come out till you\u2019ve heard the thunder. When you walk, make no noise.\u201d With that, he shut the door on me.\nA few moments later, I heard shouting in the living room, a scuffle. And then cracks of thunder, so close, like bombs detonating in my head. The loudest thing I\u2019d ever heard.\nSilence followed, broken by soft footsteps outside the workroom. The doorknob jiggled. Another beat of silence, and something impacted the door. Wood splintered.\nI ran to Dad\u2019s work counter. The glasses still tumbled inside the boiling oil. With a pair of copper tongs, I lifted out the glasses and put them on, hissing in pain as I burned my fingers and temples and the backs of my ears and the bridge of my nose. My skin blistered, and whatever substance Dad had used to fashion the frames leeched into me.\nWith another blow the door gave, hanging on one hinge, useless as a broken arm. Half a dozen cops surged in. A gray-haired man in a blue windbreaker, marked with the Hierarch\u2019s skull insignia, pushed to the front of the group. I backed up against the workbench. The man in the windbreaker was close enough to touch. He looked at me, right at me, and raised his hand as if to reach out and grab my throat. I remained silent, and he only blinked stupidly in my general direction.\nMy heart pounding, I forced myself to walk slowly past the cops, who flinched as though brushed by cobwebs. In the living room were four charred bodies. The flesh on their faces and hands bubbled, black and red. The room stank of ozone and meat and kraken.\nDad hadn\u2019t managed to get them all. He was on his back. Three cops were cutting the skin off of him with long knives. They\u2019d already flayed his arm, exposing the deep rich brown of his radius and ulna. And they\u2019d peeled his face back to expose his coffee-brown skull.\nThat night, I ran. Away from Dad\u2019s place, away from the rotor blades and searchlights. I ran until I could only walk, walked until I could only stumble, stumbled until I could only crawl. When morning broke, I woke up in wet sand and bathed myself in the cold waves that rolled in on the edge of a winter storm. I will live here, I thought. I will live here on the beach, and I will never take off these glasses, and I will live here as a ghost.\nHe was already dead, I told myself. When the men cut open Dad to take his bones, he was already dead.\nI would keep telling myself that until I could believe it.\nThe route to the Hierarch\u2019s ossuary takes me through a network of tunnels buried so deep beneath the city that, after a while, I can no longer feel the rumble of traffic from Wilshire Boulevard. The stench of tar and magic is almost a solid wall here, the ghosts so thick I can practically scoop them out of the air with my hands. Using the turtle man\u2019s collection of lock picks, stolen keys, alarm codes, passwords, and my father\u2019s glasses, I eventually find myself at the threshold of the Hierarch\u2019s ossuary.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re sickeningly wealthy. And let\u2019s say what you\u2019re rich in is gold, and you want a big room in which to hoard your treasure. What could be more fitting, then, than a room built of solid gold bricks? The Hierarch\u2019s ossuary is kind of like that, only it\u2019s built of bone. The walls are mammoth femurs stacked end-to-end. The floor, a mosaic of various claws and delicate vertebrae and healing jewels pried from the heads of Peruvian carbuncles. Overhead, mammoth tusks form the domed ceiling. And from the dome hangs a chandelier of unicorn horns, white as snow.\nI remind myself to breathe.\nSix sentries carry bayonets with basilisk-tooth blades. They exchange uneasy glances as I step deeper into the room. I\u2019ve been warned by Otis and the turtle man that anyone I encountered this far inside the Hierarch\u2019s stronghold will have received advanced training. They will have tasted deep-magic bone.\n\u201cHoss, you okay?\u201d says one of the sentries.\nAnother shakes his head, looking directly at me. \u201cNope. Something\u2019s creeping me out.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, me too. Think we should get the hound in here?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d The sentry reaches for a wall-mounted phone.\nI unlace my boot and pry it off. With everything I\u2019ve got, I chuck it up at the unicorn chandelier. The horns shatter like glass, the sound of children shrieking. I backpedal to avoid the rain of shards.\nThe sentries look up in horror. They\u2019re in charge of protecting a lot of money, and something\u2019s just gone dreadfully wrong. They flutter about the mess like maiden aunts over a collapsed souffl\u00e9.\nI retrieve my boot and make a dash for a passageway into an even larger room.\nThe entrance of bone was made to impress. This place, large enough to berth an ocean liner, houses yet greater wealth. Floor-to-ceiling shelves occupy most of it, but there are also fully assembled skeletons in chain-link cages: a serpent at least 100 yards long, a feline body as large as an elephant with a boulder-sized skull. And suspended overhead looms a kraken\u2014flat, shovel-shaped head, tail half the length of a football field, and running down the tail, dozens of spines as long as jousting lances. The stench of its power makes my stomach churn.\nThere is really only one reason Otis and the turtle man chose me for this job. One thing I can do better than anyone else. There\u2019s a scent I\u2019m sensitive to, one I can pick out like a bright white stripe on a black highway. I follow it to a row of towering shelves and bring over a ladder on wheels. I climb. Stacked on the shelves are long cardboard boxes. In front of my face is the one containing my father\u2019s bones.\nHis remains are powerful weapons. I understand why Otis and the turtle man and whoever else is in their cabal wants them.\nMost of Dad is missing. Probably sold off. All that\u2019s left are some of the small bones of his hands, and some ground powder, just a pinch, in a glass vial. I unzip my bowling bag and dump the remains inside.\nA voice from below: \u201cCome down off that ladder, son.\u201d\nIn a linen button-down shirt and tailored black slacks, the Hierarch isn\u2019t exactly what I expect, but I recognize his face from coins and postage stamps. He\u2019s thin and dark as bones from the tar pits, his fingernails, teeth and eyes saturated with magic.\n\u201cThose glasses of yours are very clever,\u201d he says, inhaling deeply. \u201cSint holo serpent bones and Deep Rhys herbs. Two sources of invisibility, mixed together, along with your own essence. That\u2019s good work. But it\u2019s not fooling me, so you might as well come on down now.\u201d\nI grip the ladder to keep my hands from shaking. I can smell him. His magic is old. \u201cSo, you really hang out in your own warehouse? Don\u2019t tell me you drive the forklifts.\u201d\nHe smiles indulgently. \u201cNo, that takes special training I lack. But when thieves get this far past my defenses, I take personal interest. Now, please, come down.\u201d\n\u201cNot just yet. I like the view from up here. You have a lot of nice things. Is that really a sphinx?\u201d I wonder if he\u2019s noticed my legs shaking.\n\u201cYes. One of only three ever found.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are the other two?\u201d\n\u201cI smoked them.\u201d And he spits at me. He fires up a dark brown glob that splatters on my cheek. It burns me like acid, hurting so bad, filling me with pain and surprise, that I can\u2019t even scream.\nA curtain of gray descends over my vision, and I lose balance, falling off the ladder, eight feet down to the concrete floor. I huddle there at the Hierarch\u2019s feet, struggling not to give in to the tempting relief of unconsciousness. My cheek burns. And I think I\u2019ve broken my right arm. But somehow\u2014reflex, dumb luck, who knows?\u2014I\u2019ve managed to hold onto the bowling bag containing father\u2019s bones. Some of the bones have fallen out. The vial of powder lies shattered, its contents spilled.\nI have to get to my feet. I can do this. I can make myself do this. Using my good arm to push myself up, I manage to drive my palm into the tiny shards of glass from the broken vial.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the Hierarch asks. I can hear the flesh on my face sizzle.\nI try to say \u201cfine,\u201d but the word won\u2019t come out.\n\u201cSo, who\u2019s that in the bowling bag?\u201d\n\u201cJohn Blackland,\u201d I rasp. \u201cHe was an osteomancer.\u201d\nThe Hierarch puts his hands in his pockets and bounces on the balls of his feet, as if stretching out his calf muscles. \u201cThis entire section of the ossuary is full of osteomancers. It\u2019s the osteomancy section. I suppose you\u2019re John Blackland\u2019s son?\u201d\nThe Hierarch\u2019s spit continues to burn. \u201cYeah,\u201d I gasp. \u201cDaniel Blackland.\u201d\nIt feels like someone\u2019s drilling into the cracked bones of my right arm. And my cheek . . . the air hits exposed bone.\nThe Hierarch squints at the hole in my face as if checking out a door ding on a parked car. \u201cIf it\u2019s any comfort, you got farther than most. No doubt you\u2019ve come equipped with some powerful osteomantic weapons. But look at me.\u201d He holds his brown hands up toward my face. \u201cI\u2019ve smoked, eaten, inhaled, and injected more ancient and secret animals than anyone alive. I\u2019m the Hierarch.\u201d\n\u201cHow could I have done this better?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cI do make public appearances, you know. You could have tried a car bomb. Or a high-powered rifle. You revenge-obsessed boys have extraordinary passion, but it seems to get in the way of achieving practical goals.\u201d\nHe thinks this is about vengeance, not simple theft. I\u2019m out of courage, and hope, and pretty much everything. But then Dad talks to me. He begins softly, through weak and subtle scents that waft up from his scattered bones: tar, the salt tang of kelp, and a trace of something clean and dark and old from the sea bottom.\nThat\u2019s the osteomancer\u2019s craft. To draw magic from bones, to infuse it into your own.\nMy father turned me into a weapon. And while I was off, screwing around, I let inheritors of my father\u2019s noble cause turn Miranda into a weapon. I\u2019ve still got her in my bowling bag. I am a vessel carrying three generations of power. But I\u2019ll die before I use my daughter in that way.\nBroken arm. Face being eaten away. Glass splinters in my good hand. I put my palm to my ruined cheek. Screaming, I rub the residue of my father\u2019s ground-up bones into my raw flesh.\nFirecrackers pop under my skin.\nThe Hierarch sees what I\u2019ve done, and he begins to exude something. A toxic stench, thick as mud, fills my head, more and more until I hear myself shrieking with blind pain.\nThe Hierarch coughs, and he coughs and coughs, and his eyes never leave mine. His jaw unhinges like a snake\u2019s, and brown fluid gushes out of him. Where it hits the floor, concrete liquefies and boils away.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything left of you,\u201d he says, his voice gargly, \u201cI\u2019ll drink it with green tea.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll live, but I know the Hierarch has lost. Because, overhead, the spines of the kraken skeleton vibrate and sing. And just before the Hierarch unleashes another torrent of magic from inside, the storm I called with Dad strikes. The bolts come down. The bolts come out of me. They come from Dad\u2019s bones, soaked with Dad\u2019s magic, mixed in my blood. They come from spirits and memories.\nWhen it\u2019s over, the Hierarch\u2019s charred body melts into a puddle of brown, sizzling fluid.\nDing-dong, dead.\nI should just walk out of here. With my glasses, I can get past the guards and get as far from the ossuary as a guy with a broken arm and a ravaged face can get.\nBut the residue of the Hierarch is thick, powerful magic. There\u2019s got to be a sponge and bucket around here somewhere.\nWe\u2019ve been driving all day and all night and have been for a few days. Connie rides with Miranda in the back, singing Spanish lullabies, trying to get her to stop crying. I cooked up a salve for her hand, and I don\u2019t think it hurts her any longer, but the girl misses the tip of her finger. Of course she does. How could she not? When she\u2019s older, maybe I\u2019ll give it to her and she can wear it on the end of a necklace.\nAnd once that thought is complete, I want to hit myself. Isn\u2019t that the sort of thing Dad might do?\nAt least once every hour I\u2019m tempted to turn the car around and head back to Los Angeles. There\u2019s a fight being waged there between high-ranking ministers and osteomancers, between freelancers and opportunists and twisted idealists like Otis and the turtle man. I shouldn\u2019t be tempted to head back and join in, but I am. I\u2019m pretty sure I would prevail. After drinking the Hierarch\u2019s remains, I may well be the most powerful osteomancer in all the Californias. Possibly the most powerful on the entire continent. Part of me wants that power. There\u2019s something in my bones that craves it.\nBut then, when the hunger gets too strong, I lean back and get a whiff of Miranda. She carries the taint of magic, a scent much older than she is, and I won\u2019t stop driving, till all I can smell is baby powder and shampoo and clean, soft skin.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, April/May 2006."}

He\u2019d never seen Annie doing it. He stood in the shade of the pecan tree for a moment, iced tea glasses sweating in his hand, shocked, then he backed around the comer of the brick building. He was confused. The cicadas seemed louder than usual, the sun hotter, and the squeals of pleasure from the apes strange.\n He walked back to the front porch and sat down. His mind still saw the two giant mounds of red-orange fur moving together like one being.\n When the two orangs came back around, Douglas thought he saw smugness in Vernon\u2019s face. Why not, he thought? I guess I would be smug, too.\n Annie flopped down on the grassy front yard and crossed one leg over the other, her abdomen bulging high; she gazed upward into the heavy white sky.\n Vernon bounded toward Douglas. He was young and red-chocolate-colored. His face was still slim, without the older orangutan jowls yet.\n \u201cBe polite,\u201d Douglas warned him.\n \u201cDrink tea, please?\u201d Vernon signed rapidly, the fringe on his elbows waving. \u201cDry as bone.\u201d\n Douglas handed Vernon one of the glasses of tea, though he\u2019d brought it out for Annie. The handsome nine-year-old downed it in a gulp. \u201cThank you,\u201d he signed. He touched the edge of the porch and withdrew his long fingers. \u201cCould fry egg,\u201d he signed, and instead of sitting, swung out hand-over-hand on the ropes between the roof of the schoolhouse and the trees. It was a sparse and dry substitute for the orang\u2019s native rain forest.\n He\u2019s too young and crude for Annie, Douglas thought.\n \u201cAnnie,\u201d Douglas called. \u201cYour tea.\u201d\n Annie rolled onto one side and lay propped on an elbow, staring at him. She was lovely. Fifteen-years-old, her fur was glossy and coppery, her small yellow eyes in the fleshy face expressive and intelligent. She started to rise up toward him, but turned toward the road.\n The mail jeep was coming down the highway.\n In a blurred movement, she set off at a four-point gallop down the half-mile drive toward the mailbox. Vernon swung down from his tree and followed, giving a small groan.\n Reluctant to go out in the sun, Douglas put down the tea anyway and followed the apes along the drive. By the time he got near them, Annie was sitting with mail sorted between her toes, holding an opened letter in her hands. She looked up with an expression on her face that he\u2019d never seen\u2014it could have been fear, but it wasn\u2019t.\n She handed the letter to Vernon, who pestered her for it. \u201cDouglas,\u201d she signed, \u201cthey want to buy my story.\u201d\n Therese lay in the bathwater, her knees sticking up high, her hair floating beside her face. Douglas sat on the edge of the tub; as he talked to her he was conscious that he spoke a double language\u2014the one with his lips and the other with his hands.\n \u201cAs soon as I called Ms. Young, the magazine editor, and told her who Annie was, she got really excited. She asked me why we hadn\u2019t sent a letter explaining it with the story, so I told her that Annie didn\u2019t want anyone to know first.\u201d\n \u201cDid Annie decide that?\u201d Therese sounded skeptical, as she always seemed to when Douglas talked about Annie.\n \u201cWe talked about it and she wanted it that way.\u201d Douglas felt the resistance from Therese. Why she never understood, he didn\u2019t know, unless she did it to provoke him. She acted as though she thought an ape was still just an ape, no matter what he or she could do. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, \u201cshe talked about doing a whole publicity thing to the hilt\u2014talk shows, autograph parties. You know. But Dr. Morris thinks it would be better to keep things quiet.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Therese sat up; her legs went underwater and she soaped her arms.\n \u201cBecause she\u2019d be too nervous. Annie, I mean. It might disrupt her education to become a celebrity. Too bad. Even Dr. Morris knows that it would be great for fundraising. But I guess we\u2019ll let the press in some.\u201d\n Therese began to shampoo her hair. \u201cI brought home that essay that Sandy wrote yesterday. The one I told you about. Now if she were an orangutan instead of just a deaf kid, she could probably get it published in Fortune.\u201d Therese smiled.\n Douglas stood. He didn\u2019t like the way Therese headed for the old argument\u2014no matter what one of Therese\u2019s deaf students did, if Annie could do it one one-hundredth as well, it was more spectacular. Douglas knew it was true, but why Therese was so bitter about it, he didn\u2019t understand.\n \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d he said, trying to sound enthusiastic.\n \u201cWill you wash my back?\u201d she asked.\n He crouched and absent-mindedly washed her. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget Annie\u2019s face when she read that letter.\u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Therese said. She rinsed. \u201cDo you have any plans for this evening?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d he said, leaving the bathroom. \u201cWould you like me to work in the bedroom so you can watch television?\u201d\n After a long pause, she said \u201cNo, I\u2019ll read.\u201d\n He hesitated in the doorway. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to sleep early? You look tired.\u201d\n She shrugged. \u201cMaybe I am.\u201d\n In the playroom at the school, Douglas watched Annie closely. It was still morning, though late. In the recliner across the room from him, she seemed a little sleepy. Staring out the window, blinking, she marked her place in Pinkwater\u2019s Fat Men From Space with a long brown finger.\n He had been thinking about Therese, who\u2019d been silent and morose that morning. Annie was never morose, though often quiet. He wondered if Annie was quiet today because she sensed that Douglas was not happy. When he\u2019d come to work, she\u2019d given him an extra hug.\n He wondered if Annie could have a crush on him, like many schoolgirls have on their teachers. Remembering her mating with Vernon days before, he idly wandered into a fantasy of touching those petals of her genitals and gently, gently moving inside her.\n The physical reaction to his fantasy embarrassed him. God, what am I thinking? He shook himself out of the reverie, averting his gaze for a few moments, until he\u2019d gotten control of himself again.\n \u201cDouglas,\u201d Annie signed. She walked erect, towering, to him and sat down on the floor at his feet. Her flesh folded into her lap like dough.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, wondering suddenly if orangutans were telepathic.\n \u201cWhy you say my story children\u2019s?\u201d\n He looked blankly at her.\n \u201cWhy not send Harper\u2019s?\u201d she asked, having to spell out the name of the magazine.\n He repressed a laugh, knowing it would upset her. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s the kind of story children would like.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n He sighed. \u201cThe level of writing is . . . young. Like you, sweetie.\u201d He stroked her head, looking into the small, intense eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll get more sophisticated as you grow.\u201d\n \u201cI smart as you,\u201d she signed. \u201cYou understand me always because I talk smart. You not always talk smart.\u201d\n Douglas was dumbfounded by her logic.\n She tilted her head and waited. When Douglas shrugged, she seemed to assume victory and returned to her recliner.\n Dr. Morris came in. \u201cHere we go,\u201d she said, handing him the paper and leaving again.\n Douglas skimmed the page until he came to an article about the \u201cape author.\u201d He scanned it. It contained one of her flashpoints; this and the fact that she was irritable from being in estrus made him consider hiding it. But that wouldn\u2019t be right.\n \u201cAnnie,\u201d he said softly.\n She looked up.\n \u201cThere\u2019s an article about you.\u201d\n \u201cMe read,\u201d she signed, putting her book on the floor. She came and crawled up on the sofa next to him. He watched her eyes as they jerked across every word. He grew edgy. She read on.\n Suddenly she took off as if from a diving board. He ran after her as she bolted out the door. The stuffed dog which had always been a favorite toy was being shredded in those powerful hands even before he knew she had it. Annie screamed as she pulled the toy apart, running into the yard.\n Terrified by her own aggression, she ran up the tree with stuffing falling like snow behind her.\n Douglas watched as the shade filled with foam rubber and fake fur. The tree branches trembled. After a long while, she stopped pummeling the tree and sat quietly.\n She spoke to herself with her long ape hand. \u201cNot animal,\u201d she said, \u201cnot animal.\u201d\n Douglas suddenly realized that Therese was afraid of the apes.\n She watched warily as the four of them strolled along the edge of the school acreage. Douglas knew that Therese didn\u2019t appreciate the grace of Annie\u2019s muscular gait as he did; the sign language that passed between them was as similar to the Ameslan that Therese used for her deaf children as British to Jamaican. Therese couldn\u2019t appreciate Annie in creative conversation.\n It wasn\u2019t good to be afraid of the apes, no matter how educated they were.\n He had invited her out, hoping it would please her to be included in his world here. She had only visited briefly twice before.\n Vernon lagged behind them, snapping pictures now and then with his expensive but hardy camera modified for his hands. Vernon took several pictures of Annie and one of Douglas, but only when Therese had separated from him to peer in between the rushes at the edge of the creek.\n \u201cAnnie,\u201d Douglas called, pointing ahead. \u201cA cardinal. The red bird.\u201d\n Annie lumbered forward. She glanced back to see where Douglas pointed, then stood still, squatting. Douglas walked beside her and they watched the bird.\n It flew.\n \u201cGone,\u201d Annie signed.\n \u201cWasn\u2019t it pretty, though?\u201d Douglas asked.\n They ambled on. Annie stopped often to investigate shiny bits of trash or large bugs. They rarely came this far from the school. Vernon whizzed past them, a dark auburn streak of youthful energy.\n Remembering Therese, Douglas turned. She sat on a stump far behind. He was annoyed. He\u2019d told her to wear her jeans and a straw hat because there would be grass burrs and hot sun. But there she sat, bare-headed, wearing shorts, miserably rubbing at her ankles.\n He grunted impatiently. Annie looked up at him. \u201cNot you,\u201d he said, stroking her fur. She patted his butt.\n \u201cGo on,\u201d Douglas said, turning his back. When he came to Therese, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n \u201cNo problem.\u201d She started forward without looking at him. \u201cI was just resting.\u201d\n Annie had paused to poke at something on the ground with a stick. Douglas quickened his step. Even though his students were smart, they had orangutan appetites. He always worried that they would eat something that would sicken them. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he called.\n \u201cDead cat,\u201d Vernon signed back. He took a picture as Annie flipped the carcass with her stick.\n Therese hurried forward. \u201cOh, poor kitty,\u201d she said, kneeling.\n Annie had seemed too absorbed in poking the cat to notice Therese approach. Only a quick eye could follow her leap. Douglas was stunned.\n Both screamed. It was over.\n Annie clung to Douglas\u2019s legs, whimpering.\n \u201cShit!\u201d Therese said. She lay on the ground, rolling from side to side, holding her left arm. Blood dripped from between her fingers.\n Douglas pushed Annie back. \u201cThat was bad, very bad,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d\n Annie sank down on her rump and covered her head. She hadn\u2019t gotten a child-scolding for a long time. Vernon stood beside her, shaking his head, signing, \u201cNot wise, baboon-face.\u201d\n \u201cStand up,\u201d Douglas said to Therese. \u201cI can\u2019t help you right now.\u201d\n Therese was pale, but dry-eyed. Clumsily, she stood and grew even paler. A hunk of flesh hung loosely from above her elbow, meaty and bleeding. \u201cLook.\u201d\n \u201cGo on. Walk back to the house. We\u2019ll come right behind you.\u201d He tried to keep his voice calm, holding a warning hand on Annie\u2019s shoulder.\n Therese moaned, catching her breath. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d she said, but stumbled on.\n \u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d Douglas said sternly. \u201cJust walk and\u2014Annie, don\u2019t you dare step out of line.\u201d\n They walked silently, Therese ahead, leaving drops of blood in the dirt. The drops got larger and closer together. Once, Annie dipped her finger into a bloody spot and sniffed her fingertip.\n Why can\u2019t things just be easy and peaceful, he wondered? Something always happens. Always. He should have known better than to bring Therese around Annie. Apes didn\u2019t understand that vulnerable quality that Therese was made of. He himself didn\u2019t understand it, though at one time he\u2019d probably been attracted to it. No\u2014maybe he had never really seen it until it was too late. He\u2019d only thought of Therese as \u201csweet\u201d until their lives were too tangled up to keep clear of it.\n Why couldn\u2019t she be as tough as Annie? Why did she always take everything so seriously?\n They reached the building. Douglas sent Annie and Vernon to their rooms and guided Therese to the infirmary. He watched as Jim, their all-purpose nurse and veterinary assistant examined her arm. \u201cI think you should probably have stitches.\u201d\n He left the room to make arrangements.\n Therese looked at Douglas, holding the gauze over her still-bleeding arm. \u201cWhy did she bite me?\u201d she asked.\n Douglas didn\u2019t answer. He couldn\u2019t think of how to express it.\n \u201cDo you have any idea?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cYou asked for it, all your wimping around.\u201d\n \u201cI . . . \u201d\n Douglas saw the anger rising in her. He didn\u2019t want to argue now. He wished he\u2019d never brought her. He\u2019d done it all for her, and she had ruined it.\n \u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d he said simply, giving her a warning look.\n \u201cBut, Douglas, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d he repeated.\n \u201cI see now,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cSomehow it\u2019s my fault again.\u201d\n Jim returned with his supplies.\n \u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d Douglas asked. He suddenly felt a pang of guilt, realizing that she was actually hurt enough for all this attention.\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said softly.\n And her eyes looked far, far from him as he left her.\n On the same day that the largest donation ever came to the school, a television news team came out to tape.\n Douglas could tell that everyone was excited. Even the chimps that lived on the north half of the school hung on the fence and watched the TV van being unloaded. The reporter decided upon the playroom as the best location for the taping, though she didn\u2019t seem to relish sitting on the floor with the giant apes. People went over scripts, strung cords and microphones, set up hot lights, and discussed angles and sound while pointing at the high ceiling\u2019s jungle-gym design. All this to talk to a few people and an orangutan.\n They brought Annie\u2019s desk into the playroom, contrary to Annie\u2019s wishes. Douglas explained that it was temporary, that these people would go away after they talked a little. Douglas and Annie stayed outside as long as possible and played Tarzan around the big tree. He tickled her. She grabbed him as he swung from a limb. \u201cKagoda?\u201d she signed, squeezing him with one arm.\n \u201cKagoda!\u201d he shouted, laughing.\n They relaxed on the grass. Douglas was hot. He felt flushed all over. \u201cDouglas,\u201d Annie signed, \u201cthey read story?\u201d\n \u201cNot yet. It isn\u2019t published yet.\u201d\n \u201cWhy talk me?\u201d\n \u201cBecause you wrote it and sold it and people like to interview famous authors.\u201d He groomed her shoulder. \u201cTime to go in,\u201d he said, seeing a wave from inside.\n Annie picked him up in a big hug and carried him in.\n \u201cHere it is!\u201d Douglas called to Therese, and turned on the video-recorder.\n First, a long shot of the school from the dusty drive, looking only functional and square, without personality. The reporter\u2019s voice said, \u201cHere, just south-east of town, is a special school with unusual young students. The students here have little prospect for employment when they graduate, but millions of dollars each year fund this institution.\u201d\n A shot of Annie at her typewriter, picking at the keyboard with her long fingers; a sheet of paper is slowly covered with large block letters.\n \u201cThis is Annie, a fifteen-year-old orangutan, who has been a student with the school for five years. She graduated with honors from another \u201cape school\u201d in Georgia before coming here. And now Annie has become a writer. Recently, she sold a story to a children\u2019s magazine. The editor who bought the story didn\u2019t know that Annie was an orangutan until after she had selected the story for publication.\u201d\n Annie looked at the camera uncertainly.\n \u201cAnnie can read and write and understand spoken English, but she cannot speak. She uses a sign language similar to the one hearing-impaired use.\u201d Change in tone from narrative to interrogative. \u201cAnnie, how did you start writing?\u201d\n Douglas watched himself on the small screen watching Annie sign, \u201cTeacher told me write.\u201d He saw himself grin, eyes shift slightly toward the camera, but generally watching Annie. His name and \u201cOrangutan Teacher\u201d appeared on the screen. The scene made him uneasy.\n \u201cWhat made you send in Annie\u2019s story for publication?\u201d the reporter asked.\n Douglas signed to Annie, she came to him for a hug, and turned a winsome face to the camera. \u201cOur administrator, Dr. Morris, and I both thought it was as good as any kids\u2019 story, so Dr. Morris said, \u2018Send it in.\u2019 The editor liked it.\u201d Annie nervously made \u201cpee\u201d sign to Douglas.\n Then, a shot of Dr. Morris in her office, a chimp on her lap, clapping her brown hands.\n \u201cDr. Morris, your school was established five years ago by grants and government funding. What is your purpose here?\u201d\n \u201cWell, in the last few decades, apes\u2014mostly chimpanzees like Rose here\u2014have been taught sign language experimentally. Mainly to prove that apes could indeed use language.\u201d Rosie put the tip of her finger through the gold hoop in Dr. Morris\u2019s ear. Dr. Morris took her hand away gently. \u201cWe were established with the idea of educating apes, a comparable education to the primary grades.\u201d She looked at the chimp. \u201cOr however far they will advance.\u201d\n \u201cYour school has two orangutans and six chimpanzees. Are there differences in their learning?\u201d the reporter asked.\n Dr. Morris nodded emphatically. \u201cChimpanzees are very clever, but the orang has a different brain structure which allows for more abstract reasoning. Chimps learn many things quickly, orangs are slower. But the orangutan has the ability to learn in greater depth.\u201d\n Shot of Vernon swinging on the ropes in front of the school.\n Assuming that Vernon is Annie, the reporter said, \u201cHer teacher felt from the start that Annie was an especially promising student. The basic sentences that she types out on her typewriter are simple but original entertainment.\u201d\n Another shot of Annie at the typewriter.\n \u201cIf you think this is just monkey business, you\u2019d better think again. Tolstoy, watch out!\u201d\n Depressed by the lightness, brevity, and the stupid \u201cmonkey business\u201d remark, Douglas turned off the television.\n He sat for a long time. Whenever Therese had gone to bed, she had left him silently. After half an hour of staring at the blank screen, he rewound his video-recorder and ran it soundlessly until Annie\u2019s face appeared.\n And then froze it. He could almost feel again the softness of her halo of red hair against his chin.\n He couldn\u2019t sleep.\n Therese had rumpled her way out of the sheet and lay on her side, her back to him. He looked at the shape of her shoulder and back, downward to the dip of the waist, up the curve of her hip. Her buttocks were round ovals, one atop the other. Her skin was sleek and shiny in the filtered street light coming through the window. She smelled slightly of shampoo and even more slightly of female.\n What he felt for her, when he thought of her generally, anyone could call love. And yet, he found himself helplessly angry with her most of the time. When he thought he could amuse her, it would end with her feelings being hurt for some obscure reason. He heard cruel words come barging out of an otherwise gentle mouth. She took everything seriously; mishaps and misunderstandings occurred beyond his control, beyond his repair.\n Under this satiny skin, she was troubled and tense. A lot of sensitivity and fear. He had stopped trying to gain access to what had been the happier parts of her person, not understanding where they had gone. He had stopped wanting to love her, but he didn\u2019t not want to love her, either. It just did not seem to matter.\n Sometimes, he thought, it would be easier to have someone like Annie for a wife.\n Annie.\n He loved her furry face. He loved the unconditional joy in her face when she saw him. She was bright and warm and unafraid. She didn\u2019t read things into what he said, but listened and talked with him. They were so natural together. Annie was so filled with vitality.\n Douglas withdrew his hand from Therese, whose skin seemed a bare blister of dissatisfaction.\n He lay on the floor of the apes\u2019 playroom with the fan blowing across his chest. He held Annie\u2019s report on Lawrence\u2019s Sons and Lovers by diagonal corners to keep it from flapping.\n Annie lazily swung from bars crisscrossing the ceiling.\n \u201cPaul wasn\u2019t happy at work because the boss looked over his shoulder at his handwriting,\u201d she had written. \u201cBut he was happy again later. His brother died and his mother was sad. Paul got sick. He was better and visited his friends again. His mother died and his friends didn\u2019t tickle him any more.\u201d\n Douglas looked over the top of the paper at Annie. True, it was the first time she\u2019d read an \u201cadult\u201d novel, but he had expected something better than this. He considered asking her if Vernon had written the report for her, but thought better of it.\n \u201cAnnie,\u201d he said, sitting up. \u201cWhat do you think this book is really about?\u201d\n She swung down and landed on the sofa. \u201cAbout man,\u201d she said.\n Douglas waited. There was no more. \u201cBut what about it? Why this man instead of another? What was special about him?\u201d\n Annie rubbed her hands together, answerless.\n \u201cWhat about his mother?\u201d\n \u201cShe help him,\u201d Annie answered in a flurry of dark fingers. \u201cEspecially when he paint.\u201d\n Douglas frowned. He looked at the page again, disappointed.\n \u201cWhat I do?\u201d Annie asked, worried.\n He tried to brighten up. \u201cYou did just fine. It was a hard book.\u201d\n \u201cAnnie smart,\u201d the orang signed. \u201cAnnie smart.\u201d\n Douglas nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d\n Annie rose, then stood on her legs, looking like a two-story fuzzy building, teetering from side to side. \u201cAnnie smart. Writer. Smart,\u201d she signed. \u201cWrite book. Bestseller.\u201d\n Douglas made a mistake. He laughed. Not as simple as a human laughing at another, this was an act of aggression. His bared teeth and uncontrolled guff-guff struck out at Annie. He tried to stop.\n She made a gulping sound and galloped out of the room.\n \u201cWait, Annie!\u201d He chased after her.\n By the time he got outside she was far ahead. He stopped running when his chest hurt and trotted slowly through the weeds toward her. She sat forlornly far away and watched him come.\n When he was near, she signed \u201chug\u201d three times.\n Douglas collapsed, panting, his throat raw. \u201cAnnie, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d He put his arms around her.\n She held onto him.\n \u201cI love you, Annie. I love you so much I don\u2019t want ever to hurt you. Ever, ever, ever. I want to be with you all the time. Yes, you\u2019re smart and talented and good.\u201d He kissed her tough face.\n Whether forgotten or forgiven, the hurt of his laughter was gone from her eyes. She held him tighter, making a soft sound in her throat, a sound for him.\n They lay together in the crackling yellow weeds, clinging. Douglas felt his love physically growing for her. More passionately than ever before in his life, he wanted to make love to her. He touched her. He felt that she understood what he wanted, that her breath on his neck was anticipation. A consummation as he\u2019d never imagined, the joining of their species in language and body. Not dumb animal-banging but mutual love . . . He climbed over her and hugged her back.\n Annie went rigid when he entered her.\n Slowly, she rolled away from him, but he held onto her. \u201cNo.\u201d A horrible grimace came across her face that raised the hairs on the back of Douglas\u2019s neck. \u201cNot you,\u201d she said.\n She\u2019s going to kill me, he thought.\n His passion declined; Annie disentangled herself and walked away.\n He sat for a moment, stunned at what he\u2019d done, at what had happened, wondering what he would do for the rest of his life with the memory of it. Then he zipped up his pants.\n Staring at his dinner plate, he thought, it\u2019s just the same as if I had been rejected by a woman.\n His hands could still remember the matted feel of her fur; tucked in his groin was the memory of being in an alien place. It had made him throw up out in the field that afternoon, and afterwards he\u2019d come straight home. He hadn\u2019t even said good night to the orangs.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Therese asked.\n He shrugged.\n She half-rose out of her chair to kiss him on the temple. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a fever, do you?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cCan I do something to make you feel better?\u201d Her hand slid along his thigh.\n He stood up. \u201cStop it.\u201d\n She sat still. \u201cAre you in love with another woman?\u201d\n Why can\u2019t she just leave me alone. \u201cNo. I have a lot on my mind.\u201d\n \u201cIt never was like this, even when you were working on your thesis.\u201d\n \u201cTherese,\u201d he said, with what he felt was undeserved patience, \u201cjust leave me alone. It doesn\u2019t help with you at me all the time.\u201d\n \u201cBut I\u201dm scared. I don\u2019t know what to do. You act like you don\u2019t want me around.\u201d\n \u201cAll you do is criticize me.\u201d He stood and took his dishes to the sink.\n Slowly, she trailed after him, carrying her plate. \u201cI\u201dm just trying to understand. It\u2019s my life, too.\u201d\n He said nothing and she walked away as if someone had told her not to leave footsteps.\n In the bathroom, he stripped and stood under the shower for a long time. He imagined that Annie\u2019s smell clung to him. He felt that Therese could smell it on him.\n What have I done, what have I done . . . ?\n And when he came out of the shower, Therese was gone.\n He had considered calling in sick, but he knew that it would be just as miserable to stay around the house and think about Annie, think about Therese, and worse, to think about himself.\n He dressed for work, but couldn\u2019t eat breakfast. Realizing that his pain showed, he straightened his shoulders, but found them drooping again as he got out of the car at work.\n With some fear, he came through the office. The secretary greeted him with rolling eyes. \u201cSomeone\u2019s given out our number again,\u201d she said as the phone buzzed. Another line was on hold. \u201cThis morning there was a man standing at the window watching me until Gramps kicked him off the property.\u201d\n Douglas shook his head in sympathy with her and approached the orang\u2019s door. He felt nauseated again.\n Vernon sat at his typewriter, composing captions for his photo album. He didn\u2019t get up to greet Douglas, but gave him an evaluative stare.\n Douglas patted his shoulder. \u201cWorking?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cLike dog,\u201d Vernon said and returned to typing.\n Annie sat outside on the back porch. Douglas opened the door and stood beside her. She looked up at him, but\u2014like Vernon\u2014made no move toward the customary hug. The morning was still cool, the shadow of the building still long in front of them. Douglas sat down.\n \u201cAnnie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u201dm sorry. I\u2019ll never do it again. You see, I felt . . . \u201d He stopped. It wasn\u2019t any easier than it had been to talk to Oona, or Wendy, or Shelley, or Therese . . . He realized then that he didn\u2019t understand her any more than he\u2019d understood them. Why had she rejected him? What was she thinking? What would happen from now on? Would they be friends again?\n \u201cOh, hell,\u201d he said. He stood. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n Annie gazed away into the trees.\n He felt strained all over, especially in his throat. He stood by her a long time.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want write stories,\u201d she signed.\n Douglas stared at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t want.\u201d She seemed to shrug.\n Douglas wondered what had happened to the confident ape who\u2019d planned to write a bestseller the day before. \u201cIs that because of me?\u201d\n She didn\u2019t answer.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to write it down for me? Could you explain it that way?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she signed, \u201ccan\u2019t explain. Don\u2019t want.\u201d\n He continued. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n \u201cSit tree. Eat bananas, chocolate. Drink brandy.\u201d She looked at him seriously. \u201cSit tree. Day, day, day, week, month, year.\u201d\n Christ almighty, he thought, she\u2019s having a goddamned existential crisis. All the years of education. All the accomplishments. The hopes of an entire field of primatology. All shot to hell because of a moody ape. It can\u2019t just be me. This would have happened sooner or later, maybe . . . He thought of all the effort he would have to make to repair their relationship. It made him tired.\n \u201cAnnie, why don\u2019t we just ease up a little on your work. You can rest today. You can go sit in the trees all of today and I\u2019ll bring you a glass of wine.\u201d\n She shrugged again.\n Oh, I\u2019ve botched it, he thought. What an idiot. He felt a pain coming back, a pain like poison, with a focal point but shooting through his heart and hands, making him dizzy and short of breath.\n At least she doesn\u2019t hate me, he thought, squatting to touch her hand.\n She bared her teeth.\n Douglas froze. She slid away from him and headed for the trees.\n He sat alone at home and watched the newscast. In a small midwestern town they burned the issues of the magazine with Annie\u2019s story in it.\n A heavy woman in a windbreaker was interviewed with the bonfire in the background. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children reading things that weren\u2019t even written by humans. I have human children and this godless ape is not going to tell its stories to them.\u201d\n A quick interview with Dr. Morris, who looked even more tired and introverted than usual. \u201cThe story is a very innocent tale, told by an innocent personality. I really don\u2019t think she has any ability or intention to corrupt . . . \u201d\n He turned the television off. He picked up the phone and dialed one of Therese\u2019s friends. \u201cJan, have you heard from Therese yet?\u201d\n \u201cNo, sure haven\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cWell, let me know, okay?\u201d\n \u201cSure.\u201d\n He thought vaguely about trying to catch her at work, but he left earlier in the morning and came home later in the evening than she did.\n Looking at her pictures on the wall, he thought of when they had first met, first lived together. There had been a time when he had loved her so much, he\u2019d been bursting with it. Now he felt empty. He didn\u2019t want her to hate him, but he still didn\u2019t know if he could talk to her about what had happened. The idea that she would sit and listen to him didn\u2019t seem realistic.\n Even Annie wouldn\u2019t listen to him any more.\n He was alone. He\u2019d done a big, dumb, terrible thing. It would have been different if Annie had reciprocated, if somehow they could have become lovers. Then it would have been them against the world, a new kind of relationship.\n But Annie didn\u2019t seem any different to Therese when it really came down to it. She didn\u2019t have any more interest in him than Dr. Morris would have in Vemon. He\u2019d imagined it.\n He was alone. And without Annie\u2019s consent, he was just a jerk who\u2019d fucked an ape.\n \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d he said aloud to Therese\u2019s picture. \u201cSo let\u2019s forget it.\u201d\n But he couldn\u2019t forget.\n \u201cDr. Morris wants to see you,\u201d the secretary said as he came in.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d He changed course for the administrative office. He whistled. In the past few days, Annie had been cool, but he felt that everything would settle down eventually. He felt better. Wondering what horrors or marvels Dr. Morris had to share with him, he knocked at her door and peered through the glass window. Probably another magazine burning, he thought.\n She signaled him to come in. \u201cHello, Douglas.\u201d\n Annie, he thought, something\u2019s happened.\n He stood until she motioned him to sit down. She looked at his face for several seconds. \u201cThis is difficult for me,\u201d she said.\n She\u2019s found out, he thought. But he put that aside, figuring it was a paranoia that made him worry. There\u2019s no way. No way. I have to calm down or I\u2019ll show it.\n She held up a photograph.\n There it was\u2014a dispassionate and cold document of that one moment in his life. She held it up to him like an accusation. It shocked him as if it hadn\u2019t been himself,\n Defiance forced him to stare at the picture instead of looking for compassion in Dr. Morris\u2019s eyes. He knew exactly where the picture had come from.\n Vernon and his new telephoto lens.\n He visualized the image of his act rising up in a tray of chemicals. Slowly, he looked away from it. Dr. Morris could not know how he had changed since that moment. He could make no protest or denial.\n \u201cI have no choice,\u201d Dr. Morris said flatly. \u201cI\u2019d always thought that even if you weren\u2019t good with people, at least you worked well with the apes. Thank God Henry, who does Vernon\u2019s darkroom work, has promised not to say anything.\u201d\n Douglas was rising from his chair. He wanted to tear the picture out of her hands. He didn\u2019t want her to see it. He wanted her to ask him if he had changed, let him reassure her that it would never happen again, that he understood he\u2019d been wrong.\n But her eyes were flat and shuttered against him. \u201cWe\u2019ll send your things,\u201d she said.\n He paused at his car and saw two big red shapes\u2014one coppery orange, one chocolate-red\u2014sitting in the trees. Vernon bellowed out a groan that ended with an alien burbling. It was a wild sound full of the jungle and steaming rain.\n Douglas watched Annie scratch herself and look toward some chimps walking the land beyond their boundary fence. As she started to turn her gaze in his direction, he ducked into his car.\n I guess an ape wouldn\u2019t understand me any more than a human, he thought, angrily trying to drive his shame away.\n Originally published in Isaac Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine, Mid-December, 1983.\n Leigh Kennedy grew up in Denver and began writing in the nurturing atmosphere of the Northern Colorado Writer's Workshop. \"Her Furry Face\" was written during the five years she lived in Austin, Texas, before heading to England, where she's now lived for nearly thirty years.

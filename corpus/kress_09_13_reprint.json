All three of them were. Barb and I watched on the link screen as they waited for the transport bay to pressurize, as they climbed out of the rover. Dr. Langley, in his rotation as council leader, made a welcome speech. The parents managed exhausted smiles, but the boy scowled.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so ugly,\u201d Barb said. \u201cAnd look at him\u2014he hates us already.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s scared,\u201d I said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be, if you got taken away to Earth?\u201d\nBarb made a vomiting sound and folded her small arms across her chest. \u201cDon\u2019t be so good all the time, Gina. It\u2019s wearying.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t answer her. I\u2019m not \u201cgood,\u201d just reasonable. If Mom had ever dragged me to Earth from Mars, I\u2019d be just as scared as this boy looked. Not that anyone would be so insane as to leave Mars for Earth.\nBarb said, \u201cThey should stay where they belong. Hell, Gina, that reco we saw just last night!\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that this kid watches that sort of reco.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nNow Dr. Langley and the \u201cimmigrants\u201d\u2014such a strange word, we haven\u2019t had immigration to Mars in decades and never to Mangala\u2014walked through the rover bay and into Level 1. More people to greet them, more speeches. I tugged on Barb\u2019s hand, and we moved to the boy to do our part. \u201cIt would be nice if someone his own age were there to greet David Hansen,\u201d my mother had said, in the tone that meant \u201cYou\u2019re elected.\u201d I\u2019d made Barb go with me. Now that didn\u2019t seem like such a good idea. She radiated contempt.\nMaybe David Hansen felt it. Or maybe he was just stupid. This was our world; he was the outsider, and he didn\u2019t even try to fake good manners. After the adults\u2019 introductions, while the officials chatted warily, stumbling over each other\u2019s strange accents, David and Barb and I stared at each other, silent. But the message in his eyes was clear. You\u2019re ugly, you\u2019re deformed, you\u2019re monsters, you\u2019re not even human. Last night\u2019s reco lay on my mind.\nDoes he have any idea how he looks to us?\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said finally. \u201cI\u2019m Gina Mellit and this is Barb Fu. I understand you play chess.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t stupid. He had manners when he chose to use them, although even then a sneer underlay the polite phrases. He was a better chess player than I am, and I\u2019d been Valles Marineris junior champion. He hated Mars, and I hated him.\nBut not at first. \u201cHe\u2019s scared,\u201d I said to Barb and Hai-Yan and Andre and Ezra until I was tired of saying it and they were tired of hearing it. David wasn\u2019t scared, he was a sick, supercilious son-of-a-bitch. But at first he was just plain sick. They took his family down to Level 2 and gave them a room on the terrace\u2014which Mom and I wouldn\u2019t get until our rotation came up next year\u2014and specially designated a bot to take care of him while his parents, who weren\u2019t sick, went to work in the labs. And then they urged me to play chess with him.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t he play against the computer?\u201d I said.\n\u201cHe can,\u201d Mom said. \u201cHe does. But I\u2019m sure he needs human company, Gina. Wouldn\u2019t you, in his place?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t say, I\u2019m not in his place. I didn\u2019t say, I wouldn\u2019t ever be in his place. I didn\u2019t say, His place made those recos about us. All those things were true, but you didn\u2019t say them to Mom, who was a Spiritual Guide when she wasn\u2019t a geneticist. The First Principle was even stronger in our family than in my friends\u2019, especially since my father was killed a year ago in an accident on the surface. So I didn\u2019t say any of it. I went to play chess with David Hansen.\nThe bot let me in. I nodded to it and said, \u201cGina Mellit to visit David Hansen. Chessboard, please.\u201d\nFrom his bed David said, \u201cWhy are so polite to it? It\u2019s just a machine.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not be polite?\u201d I said.\nHe did something with his tongue that I knew from the recos meant extreme contempt. And because that kind of reco was the only Earth feed where I\u2019d ever seen that tongue thing, I knew then that he watched them.\nThe bot handed me an old-fashioned chess set, carved of some heavy Terran wood. I put it on the table beside David\u2019s bed, he sat up shakily, and I held out my closed fists. \u201cRight one,\u201d he said. It held the white pawn. He opened with the Sicilian, I responded, and we played in a thick, ugly silence. He was a romantic player, making bold attacks and sacrifices, and I should have been able to counter that style of play. But somehow the advantage eluded me. Two pawns down, I lifted my eyes from the board to rest them on Mars.\nThe terrace rooms on Level 2 have a wonderful view. Mangala, a fairly new settlement although I\u2019ve lived in it my whole life, is built against a south-facing cliff. The cliff face is terraced in four levels, each set back from the one below, with steps on the outside that mean you don\u2019t have to wait for the elevators if you don\u2019t want to. Pots on the terraces hold genemod flowers designed by my mother, and at the bottom is the park, full of the genemod plants and trees that the wizards are always improving. The clear plastic of the shield slants down from the top of the cliff, Level 1, to the ground, and then beyond that is the shallow dome of the farm. From David\u2019s bed he could see the green of the park and the farm, and beyond them the red landscape and glorious pink sky.\nDavid followed my gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s so ugly.\u201d\n\u201cUgly?\u201d My and Mom\u2019s current quarters were in the worst part of our rotation, at the back of Level 4 where the sound of the excavation bots droned, night and day, even through the stone.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know how ugly it is, do you? You\u2019ve never seen the ocean, or a beach, or mist at morning . . . .\u201d He stopped, bent over the board, and coughed. My anger morphed into pity. Despite being so big\u2014he must top 170 centimeters!\u2014 he looked frail. I was never sick.\nI said, \u201cDid you live near an ocean? With mists at morning? I\u2019ve seen recos.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen nothing. A reco can\u2019t capture it.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe not. But I know that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou know nothing.\u201d\nI stood up. \u201cFinish the game by yourself.\u201d\n\u201cLeaving because you\u2019re losing?\u201d he taunted.\nI glared at him. But I sat down again.\nThe First Principle governs Mars. It\u2019s a spiritual principle, not a legal one, and absolutely necessary for survival in any closed environment with limited resources: Put yourself in the other person\u2019s place. David was sick, uprooted, longing for the pestilence that was Earth, despite how hard that was for me to imagine. I advanced my bishop.\nWe finished the game in silence. He won. I left without looking at him. But as the bot let me out, I heard him breathe behind me, so soft that maybe he didn\u2019t mean for me to hear. But I think he did mean it.\n\u201cBug.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t turn around. Neanderthal, I wanted to say, but didn\u2019t.\nDon\u2019t be so good all the time, Gina. It\u2019s wearying.\nWe don\u2019t look like bugs. He does look like a Neanderthal. Too big, too hairy, too few arms.\nMy great-great-great-grandfather was on the initial genemod team. I\u2019m proud of that, and why wouldn\u2019t I be? On Mars there is no room for waste or excess or stupid ostentation. Form follows function. The beauty which that creates is so much better than any Earth beauty; it\u2019s filled with unity and grace. We have softer colors\u2014through a telescope Earth always looks to me too gaudy, all that bright blue and white. On Mars variations are fashioned with subtlety and for the beauty of perfect fit with the environment. My genes are exactly what they need to be for this gravity, this level of radiation, this type of light. And I am a pretty girl. I see it in the eyes of my friends, my mother, other people. The thick, short bones of my legs don\u2019t lose calcium and strength in this gravity, as David Hansen\u2019s will. My big arms, engineered for strength, could break his too-long neck. The flexible tentacles of my small arms can manipulate objects that his clumsy fingers would crush. The light green of my epidermal photosynthetic cells uses the weak Martian sunlight to augment the energy from my food intake. I can see farther than David Hansen, hear better, use fuel more efficiently. Who the hell is he to presume to condescend?\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to play any more chess with David,\u201d I said to my mother. We were on our way to the women\u2019s baths, walking along a corridor deep inside the Level 3 rock. I had my coming-of-age ceremony several weeks ago, and most of my friends have already moved into their adult quarters, but I\u2019m in no hurry. I like my mother. It\u2019s pleasant to have someone to come home to, and there\u2019s no one yet that I\u2019d like to set up a partnership with.\n\u201cI wish you would continue the chess, Gina.\u201d\n\u201cNo. He\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d\nI stopped cold. She said it quietly, factually, the way she recites genetic data. I blurted, \u201cWhy would anybody bring a dying man all the way to Mars? Especially one who doesn\u2019t even want to be here?\u201d\n\u201cDavid isn\u2019t yet a man.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the same age I am!\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s different there, you know that. David can\u2019t make any decisions on his own and his parents wanted to be here. Earth is dying. You know that, too.\u201d\nOf course I knew that. We all knew that. It was the reason immigration had resumed at all. Three generations of arrivals at Mars, five generations when Earth was in too much crisis to fund expeditions and we were left to become ourselves in peace. And now another desperate influx by people frantic to get away while they still could. A phrase from literature came to mind: rats leaving a sinking ship. But I had never seen a rat nor a water ship, and Earth literature mostly bored me.\nI said, \u201cMom\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPut yourself in David\u2019s place, Gina.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s place was watching bug recos. Vile, stomach-turning things. And the computer games were worse. Win points by pulling tentacles off the \u201cbugs.\u201d Crush them under big robotic feet. Hit them with \u201cpesticides\u201d that make that tough green skin blister and molt. Tie the girl bugs down and rape them. Pack them naked into a \u201cbug jar\u201d and see how many you can fit. But Mom didn\u2019t know my friends and I had seen bug recos and bug games, and I couldn\u2019t tell her. We had them off an illegal feed that Ezra, who was some sort of electronic genius, had cobbled together during a mapping expo in a surface rover and then narrow-beamed to his receiver.\nIn my opinion, Earth should die.\n\u201cI think,\u201d Mom said carefully, \u201cthat maybe there\u2019s a little xenophobia going both ways here. Will you promise me to think about that, Gina?\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, without enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it. What\u2019s David Hansen dying of?\u201d\n\u201cBrain blight.\u201d\nShe had me, and she knew it. We\u2019d all learned about brain blight. Earthers caught it from one of the microbes that had been engineered in the Second Bio Wars; it created neurotoxins that ate away at the cerebral areas that controlled basic bodily functions. You got weaker and weaker, until your heart or lungs just gave out for good. It was not contagious and not curable, not even by us. Mars has been far more daring in its genetic engineering than has Earth. We had to be, in order to survive, once the reinforcement ships stopped coming. And we\u2019ve been incredibly lucky, with only minor failures or side effects. But much as we\u2019d modified the human body, we still didn\u2019t know enough to do much with the brain. David Hansen\u2019s brain was essentially the same as mine, and it was killing him. He\u2019d been in cold sleep for the voyage out and that had halted the blight, but now he couldn\u2019t have much time left.\nPut yourself in his place. Eight years old\u2014sixteen in E-years\u2014and exiled, dying.\nI shuddered.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cYou\u2019re an adult, your mom can\u2019t make you.\u201d\n\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t make me do anything,\u201d I said, which was true. \u201cShe only reminds me about the First Principle. Gently.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\u201cMuch worse.\u201d\n\u201cHow many times did you play him?\u201d\n\u201cSix.\u201d\n\u201cHow many did you lose?\u201d\n\u201cSix.\u201d\nBarb grimaced. \u201cDid he ever mention . . . you know . . . .\u201d\n\u201cThe bug recos? No. He doesn\u2019t mention anything, not directly. He just hints at nasty stuff. His parents are never around because they leave him alone all the time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d leave him alone, too. He\u2019s shit.\u201d\n\u201cWhile we play he has the link screen on an Earther news feed. It shows disaster after disaster. Yesterday it was all these children dying in some settlement called Africa and the bodies just stacked in a huge pit\u2014you can\u2019t imagine how big\u2014and set on fire to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me. The Earthers are all rotten, we already knew that. Gina, you should\u2014oh, number three bot\u2019s hit something!\u201d\nWe were on excavation duty. First-year workers always do jobs in pairs, even when the job mostly consists of watching screens and adjusting bot performance. Barb and I sat in the dusty little Level 6 control room, deep underground, near the end of our shift. She had her boots up on the back of my chair. Two chairs and the control console nearly filled the space, but Barb had jammed in Jiji\u2019s bed as well. The mebio lay asleep, his tail curled around him. I\u2019d left FuzzBall at home. This was a work shift, after all; sometimes Barb can seem a little immature.\nThe excavation bots were a mile away, at the end of the new tunnels. Excavation goes on all the time on Mars. We dig out new rooms shielded by tons of rock from the planet\u2019s yearly ten rems of radiation. We dig wells to the underground aquifers. But this particular project was a first: a ten-mile tunnel from Mangala to the nearest town, Kasei. Eventually the tunnel would have a little train running along it. Someday underground trains would connect all the settlements in the Valles Marineris.\nI studied the data from the bot. \u201cWhatever it hit is harder than the surrounding rock. An igneous form we haven\u2019t cataloged yet? Look at this Cixin-scale reading, it\u2014\u201d\nBarb\u2019s boots left the back of my chair and hit the floor with a resounding thump! \u201cLet\u2019s go see!\u201d\n\u201cYou know we\u2019re not supposed to do that. For any anomaly we\u2019re supposed to call Dr. Alvero and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, for once don\u2019t be such a good girl, Gina!\u201d\nBarb\u2019s eyes sparkled. Her comment rankled. And somewhere deep inside, I felt\u2014even while knowing it made no sense\u2014that I had already paid out enough goodness by playing chess with David Hansen. Besides, I was curious to go into the tunnel, too. I\u2019d never seen it live. And it wasn\u2019t as if we didn\u2019t know everything about proper suiting up for unpressurized areas. We\u2019d had that drill since we were five.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cbut let me run the diagnostics first to make sure it\u2019s not just a bot malfunction.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t. The bot had hit something too hard even to dent, although it kept on trying, its diamond-fiber arm scrabbling against the whatever-it-was. Excavation bots are pretty stupid. I turned it off and we took the suits from their closet. Behind the closet was a small air lock, and behind that the start of the tunnel.\nThe ceiling was higher than it looked on the control screen, and a lot dustier. Minuscule particles of rock choked the air. Fines, we called them on the surface, but I couldn\u2019t remember if it was the same for underground particulates. All at once this didn\u2019t seem like such a good idea.\n\u201cBarb\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome on!\u201d she said over her suit radio. She bolted forward, and I followed.\nThe tunnel was about three meters wide. The first part had been reinforced by a construction bot, which we passed, busily working, about two-thirds of the way along. After that the walls were rough rock, sometimes with different colored strata briefly lit by my headlamp before we moved on. My uneasiness grew, although I couldn\u2019t have said why.\nA mile underground seems a lot longer than a mile on the surface.\nWhen we reached the end, we both stood silent until Barb breathed, \u201cLook at that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a . . .\u201d A what? Inspiration came to me. \u201cA piece of exploratory junk from a few centuries ago. You know, Precollapse, when Earth was sending those piddly little bots to Mars and maybe one of them fell into a hole and then the tectonic plates shifted and it got squashed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cInto a perfectly flat impenetrable wall?\u201d Barb said scornfully. She uses scorn as a shield. She always has.\nThe excavation bot stood frozen in the position I\u2019d turned it off, which somehow made it look as dumbstruck as we were. It had uncovered a square meter of metal. The metal, which should have been scarred by tectonic shifts and rusted by aquifer drips and canted by erosion, gleamed a smooth dull gold. Without thinking I put my glove on it. The gloves are heated, of course, but not as well as the suits, or they\u2019d be too inflexible. Crisscrosses of heating element lace the supple metallic fabric. Through my glove I could feel the metal\u2019s piercing cold.\nOf course it was cold. This was deep underground in the Martian autumn. Everything was cold.\nThis was colder.\nThat made no sense.\n\u201cThis makes no sense,\u201d Barb said scornfully. \u201cIs there some part of the tunnel project we weren\u2019t told about?\u201d\nThe tunnel project was open knowledge, like nearly every other project on Mars. You can\u2019t build trust any other way among scientific groups, among settlements, among variations in Martian culture. That\u2019s why we have the First Principle. Put yourself in their place.\n\u201cI think,\u201d I said, \u201cwe better go back and call Dr. Alvero.\u201d\nFor once, Barb didn\u2019t argue.\nMom wasn\u2019t home when I got off shift, which is rare. She generally wants to hear about my day. Well, she would hear soon enough. Dr. Alvero had called half the xenologists on Mars and they were all rushing to the excavation tunnel by elevator or rover or dirigible. Those that were too far away were glued to the link.\n\u201cIs it\u2014what is it?\u201d Barb had asked, and I was glad because I couldn\u2019t speak myself.\n\u201cHow could we know yet?\u201d Dr. Alvero said sternly. I could read that sternness; he was a friend of Mom\u2019s, and I\u2019d sat with him at dinner in the mess hall lots of times. He was excited and hiding it; he was insisting on proper scientific skepticism; he was aware that Barb and I had seriously violated regs during his shift as captain.\nBarb didn\u2019t believe in proper scientific skepticism. She blurted, \u201cIs it ancient Martians? Or aliens?\u201d\nIrritation replaced sternness. \u201cDon\u2019t be premature, young woman. And don\u2019t finish your shift; that\u2019s not necessary now. Sign out and, please, don\u2019t say anything to anyone about this, at least for now.\u201d\n\u201cBut will you tell us if it turns out to be\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome on, Barb!\u201d I said, tugging on her arm before Dr. Alvero could lose his temper. And if the smooth gold wall did mean aliens, everybody would know soon enough\u2014\nAliens.\nHalfway back to our rooms, I stopped dead. The terraces around me seemed to waver. Aliens. Was that possible? Microbial fossils had been found on Mars, but only microbial fossils. Somewhere in the long distant past, life had started here, and then had shivered to a halt. Climate change or radiation or something\u2014my mind had gone numb. The life on Mars was us. This was our planet, my home. Arrivals from Earth were bad enough. But aliens\u2014\nIt was one of those ideas too big and all-encompassing for the mind to hold onto. Like one\u2019s own death.\nI had stumbled the rest of the way back to our rooms, as if I were as clumsy in Martian gravity as David Hansen. Now I didn\u2019t want to be alone. I scooped FuzzBall from her basket and squeezed her tight. But she didn\u2019t like that and yelped. And anyway, a mebio wasn\u2019t what I wanted. What did I want?\nI wanted my life to stay the same.\nMaybe it would. Maybe the smooth gold wall wasn\u2019t anything that would change anything. After all, it had probably been there already for a long, long time, doing nothing. Maybe our life on Mars could just go on the way it always had, unlike life on Earth that just got worse and worse, rising oceans and dying oceans and too much CO2 and stupid ugly biowars and\u2014\nPut yourself in their place. And I want things to stay the same.\nI went to play chess with David Hansen.\nThe first thing he said was, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Until he did, I hadn\u2019t realized I was still holding FuzzBall.\n\u201cOh, hell, you might be allergic, I shouldn\u2019t bring her in here, sorry . . . .\u201d\n\u201cNo, let me see it. Bring it here.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t like his commanding tone but I brought FuzzBall to him anyway. David was out of bed, sitting in a chair with the chess set on a little table beside him. He\u2019d been waiting for me. He looked stronger than last time. When he held out his arms for FuzzBall, I gave her to him.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cA mebio. Part mechanical, part genetically engineered biological. Not a \u2018bug.\u2019\u201d I thought he might react to that, but he was too busy petting FuzzBall, who purred in his arms, little traitor. Well, she was pretty cute, even to an Earther.\n\u201cIt looks sort of like a cat. Is it a cat?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what genes they started with, but DNA is amazingly adaptable. She eats fines.\u201d\nHe looked up. I\u2019d never seen that expression on his face before: open and gentle. He looked almost like a Martian. He said, \u201cWhat are fines?\u201d\n\u201cThe bits of dust that get into everything, no matter how hard you try to make a tight seal. Mebios keep it under control.\u201d\n\u201cYou force her to eat dust?\u201d\n\u201cNobody forces her to do anything. She\u2019s engineered to lick them up, and the saliva-fines mass is shunted to the mechanical part of her crop, where it can easily be removed. Here, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\u201cNo! Don\u2019t!\u201d Abruptly he dropped FuzzBall to the floor. She yelped in protest, then began licking the polished stone. \u201cGet it out of here. It\u2019s just another freak. Like you.\u201d\nThe gentle look was gone. David stared at me like he hated me. I knew he was going to say it a full three seconds before he did.\n\u201cBug.\u201d\nSomething inside me snapped. The find in the tunnel, the repulsive recos, even the chess games I\u2019d lost, one after another. The big and the small all mixed up, and all sauced with David\u2019s contempt and my fear. My vision went red. I picked up the chessboard and threw it at him.\nThe board struck the side of his head in a rain of pawns and rooks and bishops. FuzzBall ran for the door, snarling. But David smiled. Blood streamed down his neck and soaked into his shirt. He said quietly, \u201cToo bad you couldn\u2019t throw it harder.\u201d\nI stared at him, stomped out, and burst into tears.\nWhen Mom finally arrived home from her lab, she rushed straight into my alcove. \u201cGina! Are you all right?\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t been able to sleep, but the sudden light disoriented me. Blinking, I tried to see if she knew about Barb and me breaking regs. Of course she knew. Her face wrinkled into dozens of concerned little crevasses.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom. And I know we shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut are you all right? I couldn\u2019t leave earlier, the oocytes\u2014\u201d\nI held out my arms, like I was three years old again. She sat on the edge of my bed and held me. That was what I needed, what David Hansen didn\u2019t have; someone who cared more about him than about work, or even about Mars. My voice came out thick. \u201cIs it . . . aliens, Mom?\u201d\nShe laughed, a strangled sort of laugh, but I understood it. The situation was too weird to be quite real\u2014even though it was real. She said, \u201cThey don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll know for a long time. Maybe not ever.\u201d\nThat hadn\u2019t occurred to me. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Mom was calmer now, and that made me calmer. I let go of her, a little ashamed of my lapse back into childhood.\n\u201cWell, think about it, Gina. From its position, that thing has lain deep underground for a long time\u2014we\u2019ll know how long once we date the metal, if we can, or at least the rock seal over it. A very long time, and if it is alien, no aliens have emerged from it. So probably there\u2019s nothing biologically complex in there, or there was once and isn\u2019t anymore. But unless the thing spontaneously opens, we\u2019re not going to open it. Would you? Who knows what contaminating microbes we might let out, or what effect they\u2019d have? Our Mars is fragile, you know that.\u201d\nI did. Humans didn\u2019t evolve here\u2014school studies constantly emphasized that, and so did everybody else\u2014and we had to be careful. One slip and the \u201cplanet not indigenous to us\u201d would snatch at a life, a town, the entire human population. I knew it, but I had trouble feeling it deep in my bones. Mars didn\u2019t feel \u201cnot indigenous\u201d to me. It felt like home.\nI said, \u201cSo the council will just leave the . . . the alien thing there at the end of the tunnel? Forever?\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cForever is a long time. But, probably, yes.\u201d\n\u201cMom\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, honey?\u201d\nBut all at once I didn\u2019t want to tell her about David Hansen, the bug recos, throwing the chessboard. After all, I wasn\u2019t really three years old. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d She hugged me and left.\nThe alien artifacts, or biologicals, or whatever they were, would stay sealed. David Hansen would not want any more chess, not after I\u2019d clobbered him with the board. Dr. Alvero would, as shift captain, discipline Barb and me, but that was minor. Mom wasn\u2019t angry. I was able to sleep.\nI was wrong about David. He called the next day. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be here to play me.\u201d\nMy belly sank.\n\u201cGina? Did you hear me? Your mother said.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like a baby when you say that.\u201d\n\u201cGet up here.\u201d\nAnd I did. From guilt, from duty, from training: Put yourself in his place. The problem was, the First Principle was correct. It was the only way to make a Martian settlement work. But I didn\u2019t have to like it.\nDavid looked stronger than I\u2019d ever seen him. To my surprise, his elaborate chessboard was already in midgame. As usual there was no sign of either of his parents. I said, \u201cYou playing someone else?\u201d\n\u201cNo, stupid. This is a famous game\u2014the \u2018Immortal Game\u2019 between Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky hundreds of years ago. White to move. Go ahead.\u201d\nDespite myself, I studied the board. \u201cPawn to d4.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Anderssen played knight to d5.\u201d\nThe move didn\u2019t make sense. This unknown \u201cAnderssen\u201d was ignoring the upcoming threat to his rook. David grinned. \u201cWant to see the rest of it?\u201d\nI nodded. He played out the game. White gave away both rooks, his queen, and a bishop\u2014and still got a checkmate, using only minor pieces. It was unexpected. It was beautiful.\nDavid said, \u201cHe used a suicide tactic. Kill everything he has to get all the way home.\u201d\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d\n\u201cCan you? Gina, I want you to do something for me. I think I might have been wrong about Mars. I want to see it. Take me outside.\u201d\nTalk about unexpected! \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you can. You\u2019re an adult here, and so am I. I researched it. We don\u2019t need permission to suit up and go out, but I don\u2019t know the way or the air lock codes. There are codes, aren\u2019t there, so that little kids can\u2019t get out by mistake.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking you outside. Ask your parents.\u201d\nHe did that contemptuous thing with his tongue, and then a hand gesture I knew was considered really filthy on Earth. I hated that I was shocked. He said, as if the word was killing him, \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHe started to curse me then, using some words I knew, some I\u2019d only seen in bug recos, some I\u2019d never heard. I was glad. His foulness finally dissolved my duty, set me free. Nobody ever has to put up with that kind of abuse. I shouted at the top of my voice, startling him, \u201cI could never be in your place!\u201d\nIn the momentary silence that followed, I left.\nThe dull gold artifact was measured, photographed, assayed, and put through every possible test to see what was inside. Nothing yielded any useful information, not even internal imaging, which revealed only indistinct shadows. Bots carefully scraped away the rock on the thing\u2019s six sides, none of which bore any markings. A perfect cube, the artifact was made of a substance unknown to either Earth or Martian scientists. Geologists determined that rock around it had shifted several thousand years ago; before that the artifact had lain on or near the Martian surface. Images of it became the most accessed data in the solar system.\nOn Earth a rising ocean, clogged with the out-of-control algal blooms that had killed the rest of its marine life, broke through the levees around a major settlement called New York. The water rushed in. In the floods and panic and contamination, two million people died.\nI played and replayed the Anderssen-Kieseritzky Immortal Game, looking for something I could not have named. The stupid game even invaded my dreams. Knight takes g7 King to d8. . . Not that I was sleeping all that well anyway.\nI didn\u2019t see David Hansen, but I heard about him. In a settlement as small as Mangala, gossip is as pervasive as fines. His mother was out on a long-explore; she would not return for the rest of the year. David\u2019s father was in Mangala but spent all his days and most of his nights at the lab. After all, wasn\u2019t his son supposed to be an adult, here on Mars? I looked up the Hansens on the link. They did not come from New York. They had lived somewhere called Illinois, a place that had undergone rapid desertification during the recent round of massive climate shifts. The link, calling up Earther feeds from its data base, showed me kilometer after kilometer of dry, cracked, withered ground leading to a barren lakeshore.\n\u201cGina,\u201d Mom said one day over a very late dinner, just before mess closed down, \u201cthere\u2019s talk of . . . of certain recos that have been fed illegally to Mars.\u201d\nI picked up a forkful of soypeach and kept my gaze on it. Ordinarily I like soypeach.\n\u201cYou saw them,\u201d Mom said flatly.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe put down her fork. \u201c\u2018Bug\u2019 recos.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nI shrugged. I was an adult; I didn\u2019t have to tell her everything.\n\u201cVile, ugly, stupid things\u2014that\u2019s what those recos are. From ignorant and diseased minds.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said for the third time, and finally I could look up at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sorry? Dear heart, you have nothing to be sorry for. It\u2019s the people who made those recos who should be\u2014is that why you\u2019ve been looking so tense and preoccupied the last few weeks? I\u2019ve been worried about you. Ever since you stopped playing chess with David Hansen\u2014was it David who showed you those recos? Was it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Mom. I saw them before he even arrived.\u201d All at once the tension in my head\u2014and of course Mom had noticed it, she loved me\u2014shot up several levels.\n\u201cSo David Hansen had nothing to do with it?\u201d\nHow to answer that? It was too complicated. I said, \u201cMom\u2014is the council really never going to open that alien thing?\u201d\nShe stared at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with David Hansen?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2014I just\u2014never mind. How is he?\u201d\n\u201cDoing really well. His brain blight might even be in remission. There are a few rare cases of that on record. If he\u2019s one, it\u2019s a great chance for up-close study, maybe even to learn something significant about the immune system. DNA is infinitely adaptable.\u201d\nMy linkcom sounded. When I accessed the message, David Hansen\u2019s face stared at me, surrounded by waist-high plants. I recognized them: my mother\u2019s genemod wheat, modified for nutrient-enhanced Martian soil. David was out in the farm.\nInstead of speaking, he used the linkcom\u2019s text function, which no one ever does except for data transmission. I had to squint at the tiny letters: \u201cCome right now and alone or bishop to e7.\u201d\nI stood, my legs shaky, and said, \u201cBarb wants me. See you later?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Mom said. \u201cHave fun.\u201d\nI made myself not run out of the mess. Bishop to e7 was the last move in Anderssen\u2019s immortal game with Kieseritzky. David\u2019s words filled my head: \u201cHe used a suicide tactic. Kill everything he has to get all the way home.\u201d\nI raced along the underground tunnel from Level 5 to the farm, then up the stairs instead of taking the elevator to the air lock. The farm is pressurized, but the atmospheric mix is different from the town, with more CO2 to aid plant growth. People can breathe it, but just barely and not for too long. Suits hang along the wall beside the air lock. I hesitated, knowing I should put one on, but I didn\u2019t want to take the time. Instead I just grabbed a helmet and rushed into the air lock. It filled agonizingly slowly with the farm air. Come on come on fill . . .\nDusk filled the hot air of the farm, steamy and rich with the scents of plants, loam, water. No one else was around at this hour, and without a suit I had no headlamp. It didn\u2019t matter. I had played here, taken botany lessons here, done work shifts here my entire life. Mom was a plant geneticist. I knew every inch of the farm, and I raced sure-footed over the narrow paths between crop beds and mini-fields and hydroponic vats and dwarf fruit trees. The sky beyond the low plastic dome was clear, and Phobos shone above me amid the earliest and brightest stars.\nDavid stood, also unsuited, between two mini-fields of Mom\u2019s wheat, where the path ended at the far dome wall. Beyond the dome the Martian surface, rock and fines, was shrouded in shadows. David\u2019s back was to the wall. He held the detached cutting arm of a bot, sharper than any razor.\n\u201cDavid,\u201d I said softly, as if sound might somehow jar him into action.\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to stop me.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to stop you, or you wouldn\u2019t have linked me. You\u2019d have just done it.\u201d\nHe laughed. The laugh shivered along my bones. \u201cIs that what you think, Gina? You\u2019re wrong. I linked you because I hate you, hate this place, hate all you bugs\u2014do you know how repulsive you look to me? I can never belong here, never, and I can\u2019t . . . can\u2019t go . . . home . . .\u201d\nHe started to cry. I moved faster than I have ever moved before. Somehow\u2014how?\u2014I knew that he could not let me see him cry.\nTime seemed to stop, quiver, slow down. I had the weird sensation of seeing us both from the outside, each movement as clear and distinct as a coming-of-age dance: Gina leaps forward. David thrusts the cutter behind him at the dome wall. Gina closes the distance between them. The wall of tough piezoelectric plastic rips and air rushes out. Gina is upon David. He screams and whips around the arm holding the cutter. He\u2019s clumsy in this gravity. She clutches his body in her big arms, so much stronger than his. Her small arms grasp at the cutter. She feels it slice deep into her thigh before he drops it. Gina screams. They both drop to the ground.\nTime returned to normal. Alarms shrieked. A repair bot threw itself at the hole where the air whooshed out. With my small arms I clamped the helmet over David\u2019s head and the emergency seal molded itself roughly to his shoulders. Then I saw my own blood streaming down my thigh, and everything went dark.\n\u201cShock,\u201d Barb said. \u201cYour mom said it was only shock.\u201d Her face was as white as the sheet that lay over me in the infirmary. She was my first visitor except for Mom, but I knew all my other friends would come as soon as they were allowed.\n\u201cDavid?\u201d I croaked. My lungs needed more time to fully recover, but they would. You\u2019re not supposed to run and fight and bleed while breathing that much CO2.\nBarb grimaced. \u201cHis father took the fucker to Kasei. They have psychiatric facilities there, you know, that we don\u2019t. If you ask me, he doesn\u2019t need psychiatric help, he needs\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cBut why did you do it, Gina? Why save his life? You could have been killed, and he\u2019s worthless scum.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d I couldn\u2019t say more. So we sat in silence, my friend and I, and she held my hand, and I could still feel my mother\u2019s arms around me from before she left for her work shift, and I knew why the aliens, or their biologicals, or their machines, stayed inside the dull gold artifact.\nIt\u2019s the same reason we won\u2019t ever open it: Whatever is inside might cause contamination because it does not belong here. No one else believes this theory. \u201cGina, sweetheart,\u201d Mom said gently when I\u2019d croaked this out to her an hour ago, \u201cthink. If that were true, the aliens wouldn\u2019t have taken all the trouble to come here in the first place. They must have meant to establish some sort of presence on Mars, or why bother?\u201d\nMy throat wouldn\u2019t let me reply, but I think I know the answer. The aliens did mean to establish themselves here. But once they arrived, they discovered that they couldn\u2019t. It was not home. It would never be home. They discovered that they were not as adaptable as they\u2019d hoped, and so they committed a sort of suicide, an act of despair.\nOr maybe that isn\u2019t it at all. Maybe it wasn\u2019t an act of despair but of altruism. They landed and discovered they could not survive on Mars. Their craft was damaged, or there weren\u2019t the right resources here, or they didn\u2019t have the right science to adapt Martian resources to their needs. So they took the only kind of victory they could achieve: leaving Mars uncontaminated for those who could adapt to it. \u201cA suicide tactic. Kill everything he has to get all the way home.\u201d Maybe the aliens, too, gained a kind of win, that of doing the right thing for us, who would travel here from Earth so much later. Put yourself in their place.\nI don\u2019t know which idea is true, anymore than I know what will happen to David Hansen. His mind is indeed diseased, but not with brain blight. Maybe they can fix his hatred of us, maybe not. Maybe fix is the wrong word. DNA might be infinitely adaptable, but I don\u2019t know if human minds are. If he returns to Mangala, I\u2019ll play chess with him and take him places and try to help him adjust. Carefully. However, no matter what any of us do, David might always feel like an alien on Mars.\nBut I am a Martian, and this is my home, and I am in my right place.\n\u201cOh, I meant to tell you,\u201d Barb says, \u201cthe animal wizards have designed the next generation of mebios, and you won\u2019t believe how cute they are.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I croaked. \u201cI would.\u201d\nOriginally published in Life on Mars: Tales from the New Frontier, edited by Jonathan Strahan.\nNancy Kress is the author of thirty-five books, including twenty-seven novels, four collections of short stories, and three books on writing.

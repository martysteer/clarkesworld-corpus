When he was young, he was strongly influenced by surrealism paintings and cyberpunk art, and has produced watercolor paintings, drawing, sculpture, and so on. At present he enjoy creating 3D worlds, which he assembles like a puzzle by gathering archaic pieces from my memory. He currently lives in Kanagawa, Japan."}

One dragon was as red as Earth, the other as blue as Heaven: day and night, fire and water, passion and calculation. They warred, as dragons do, and the universe was born of their battle.\n We have never forgotten that we partake of both dragons, Earth and Heaven. Yet we are separate creatures with separate laws. It is why the twin dragons appear upon our national seal, separated by Man\u2019s sinuous road. We live among the stars, but we remember our heritage.\n One thing has not changed since the birth of the universe, however. There is still war.\n Yen, you have to come back so I can tell you the beginning of your story. Everything is classified: every soldier unaccounted for, every starsail deployed far from home, every gram of shrapnel . . . every whisper that might have passed between us. Word of the last battle will come tomorrow, say the official news services, but we have heard the same thing for the last several days.\n I promised I would tell no one, so instead I dream it over and over. I knew, when I began to work for the Ministry of Virtuous Thought, that people would fear me. I remind myself of this every time someone calls me a woman with no more heart than a stone, despite the saying that a stone\u2019s weeping is the most terrible of all.\n You came to me after the invaders from Yamat had been driven off, despite the fall of Spinward Gate and the capital system\u2019s long siege. I didn\u2019t recognize you at first. Most of my clients use one of the government\u2019s thousand false names, which exist for situations requiring discretion. Your appointment was like any other, made under one such.\n Your face, though\u2014I could hardly have failed to recognize your face. Few clients contact me in person, although I can\u2019t help wanting to hear, face-to-face, why my patients must undergo the changes imposed on them.\n Admiral Yen Shenar: You were an unassuming man, although your dark eyes suggested a certain taut energy, and you were no stranger to physical labor. I wished I were in such lean good health; morning exercise has never done much for me. But your drab civilian clothes and the absent white gun did nothing to disguise the fact that you were a soldier. An admiral. A hero, even, in my office with its white walls and bland paintings of bamboo.\n \u201cAdmiral,\u201d I said, and stopped. How do you address the war hero of a war everyone knows will resume when the invaders catch their breath? I thought I knew what you wanted done. A former lover, a political rival, an inconvenience on the way up; the client has the clout to make someone disappear for a day and return as though nothing as changed, except it has. A habit of reverse-alphabetizing personal correspondence, a preference for Kir Jaengmi\u2019s poetry over An Puna\u2019s, a subversive fascination with foreign politics, excised or altered by my work. Sometimes only a favorite catchphrase or a preference for ginseng over green tea is changed, and the reprogramming serves as a warning once the patient encounters dissonance from family and acquaintances. Sometimes the person who returns is no longer recognizable. The setup can take months, depending on the compatibility of available data with preset models, but the reprogramming itself only takes hours.\n So here you were, Admiral Yen Shenar. Surely you were rising in influence, with the attendant infelicities. It disappointed me to see you, but only a little. I could guess some of your targets.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no need for formality, madam,\u201d you said, correctly interpreting my silence as a loss for words. \u201cYou\u2019ve dealt with more influential people in your time, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Your smile was wry, but suggested despair.\n I thought I understood that, too. \u201cWho is the target?\u201d\n The despair sharpened, and everything changed. \u201cMyself. I want to be expunged, like a thrall. I\u2019m told it\u2019s easier with a willing subject.\u201d\n \u201cHeaven and Earth, you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n The walls were suddenly too spare, too white.\n I wondered why you didn\u2019t do the obvious thing and intrigue against Admiral Wan Kun, or indeed the others in court who considered your growing renown a threat. No surprise: the current dynasty had been founded by a usurper-general, and ever since, the court has regarded generals and admirals with suspicion. We may despise the Yamachin, but they are consummate warriors, and they would never have been so frightened by the specter of a coup as to sequester their generals at the capital, preventing them from training with the troops they commanded on paper. We revere scholars. They have their sages, but soldiers are the ones they truly respect.\n \u201cMadam,\u201d you said, \u201cI am only asking you to do what the ministry will ask of another programmer a few days from now. It doesn\u2019t matter what battles one wins in the deeps of space if one can\u2019t keep out of political trouble. Even if we all know the Yamachin will return once they\u2019ve played out this farce of negotiations . . . \u201d\n You wanted me to destroy the man you were, but in a manner of your choosing and not your rivals\u2019, all for the sake of saving Cho in times to come. This meant preserving your military acumen so you might be of use when Yamat returned to ravage Cho. Only a man so damned sure of himself would have chanced it. But you had routed the Yamachin navy at Red Sun and Hawks Crossing with a pittance of Chosar casualties, and no one could forget how, in the war\u2019s early hours, you risked your command by crossing into Admiral Wan Kun\u2019s jurisdiction to rally the shattered defense at Heaven\u2019s Gate.\n \u201cAdmiral,\u201d I said, \u201care you sure? The half-death\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the kindest euphemism\u2014\u201cmight leave you with no more wit than a broken cup, and all for nothing. It has never been a safe procedure.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe you would be disgraced in a matter of days, although it came to pass as you predicted.\n You smiled at that, blackly amused. \u201cWhen calamity lands on your shoulder, madam, I assure you that you\u2019ll find it difficult to mistake for anything else.\u201d A corner of your mouth curled. \u201cI imagine you\u2019ve seen death in darker forms than I have. I have killed from vast distances, but never up close. You are braver by far than I have ever been.\u201d\n You were wrong about me, Admiral Yen, even if the procedure is easier with a willing patient. With anyone else, I would have congratulated myself on a task swiftly and elegantly completed.\n You know the rest of the story. When you tell it to me, I will give you the beginning that I stole from you, even at your bidding. Although others know our nation Cho as the Realm Between Two Dragons, vast Feng-Huang and warlike Yamat, our national emblem is the tiger, and men like you are tigers among men.\n Sometimes I think that each night I spin the story to myself, a moment of memory will return to you, as if we were bound together by the chains of a children\u2019s fable. I know better. There are villains every direction I look. I am one of them. If you do not return, all that will be left for me is to remember, over and over, how I destroyed the man you should have been, the man you were.\n By the time we took him seriously, he was an old man: Tsehan, the chancellor-general of Yamat, and its ruler in truth. Ministers came and ministers went, but Tsehan watched from his unmoving seat in Yamat\u2019s parliament, the hawk who perched above them all.\n He was not a man without refinement, despite the popular depiction of him as a wizened tyrant, too feeble to lead the invasion himself and too fierce to leave Cho in peace. Tsehan loved fine things, as the diplomats attested. His reception hall was bright with luxuries: sculptures of light and parabolic mirrors, paintings on silk and bamboo strips, mosaics made from shattered ancient celadon. He served tea in cups whose designs of seasonal flowers and fractals shifted in response to the liquid\u2019s temperature or acidity. \u201cFor the people of Yamat,\u201d he said, but everyone knew these treasures were for Tsehan\u2019s pleasure, not the people\u2019s.\n War had nurtured him all his life. His father was a soldier of the lowest rank, one more body flung into Yamat\u2019s bloody and tumultuous politics. It is no small thing, in Yamat\u2014a nation at least as class-conscious as our own\u2014to rise from a captain\u2019s aide to heir-apparent of Chancellor-General Oshozhi. Oshozhi succeeded in bringing Yamat with its many would-be warlords under unified rule, and he passed that rule on to Tsehan.\n It should not have surprised us that, with the end of Yamat\u2019s bloody civil wars, Tsehan would thirst for more. But Cho was a pearl too small for his pleasure. The chancellor-general wanted Feng-Huang, vastest of nations, jewel of the stars. And to reach Feng-Huang, he needed safe passage through Cho\u2019s primary nexus. Feng-Huang had been our ally and protector for centuries, the culture whose civilization we modeled ours after. Betraying Feng-Huang to the Yamachin would have been like betraying ourselves.\n Yamat had been stable for almost a decade under Tsehan\u2019s leadership, but we had broken off regular diplomatic relations during its years of instability and massacre. We had grown accustomed to hearing about dissidents who vanished during lunch, cr\u00e8ches destroyed by rival politicians and generals, bombs hidden in shipments of maiden-faced orchids, and soldiers who trampled corpses but wept over fire-scored sculptures. Some of it might even have happened.\n When Tsehan sent the starsail Hanei to ask for the presence of a Chosar delegation and our government acquiesced, few of us took notice. Less than a year after that, our indifference would be replaced by outrage over Yamat\u2019s demands for an open road to our ally Feng-Huang. Tsehan was not a falling blossom after all, as one of our poets said, but a rising dragon.\n In the dream, he knew his purpose. His heartbeat was the drum of war. He walked between Earth and Heaven, and his path was his own.\n And waking\u2014\n He brushed the hair out of his eyes. His palms were sweaty. And he had a name, if not much else.\n Yen Shenar, no longer admiral despite his many victories, raised his hand, took aim at the mirror, and fired.\n But the mirror was no mirror, only the wall\u2019s watching eyes. He was always under surveillance. It was a fact of life in the Garden of Tranquility, where political prisoners lived amid parameterized hallucinations. The premise was that rebellion, let alone escape, was unlikely when you couldn\u2019t be sure if the person at the corner was a guard or the hallucination of a childhood friend who had died last year. He supposed he should be grateful that he hadn\u2019t been executed outright, like so many who had rioted or protested the government\u2019s policies, even those like himself who had been instrumental in defending Cho from the Yamachin invasion.\n He had no gun in his hand, only the unflinching trajectory of his own thoughts. One more thing to add to his litany of grievances, although he was sure the list changed from day to day, hour to hour, when the hallucinations intensified. Sourly, he wished he could hallucinate a stylus, or a chisel with which to gouge the walls, whether they were walls or just air. He had never before had such appreciation for the importance of recordkeeping.\n Yen began to jog, trusting the parameters would keep him from smashing into a corner, although such abrupt pain would almost be welcome. Air around him, metal beneath him. He navigated through the labyrinth of overgrown bamboo groves, the wings of unending arches, the spiral blossoms of distant galaxies glimpsed through cracked lattices. At times he thought the groves might be real.\n They had imprisoned him behind Yen Shenar\u2019s face, handicapped him with Yen Shenar\u2019s dreams of stars and shapes moving in the vast darkness. They had made the mistake of thinking that he shared Yen Shenar\u2019s thrall-like regard for the government. He was going to escape the Garden if it required him to break each bone to test its verity, uproot the bamboo, break Cho\u2019s government at its foundations.\n The war began earlier, but what we remember as its inception is Sang Han\u2019s death at Heaven\u2019s Gate. Even the Yamachin captain who led the advance honored Sang\u2019s passing.\n Heaven\u2019s Gate is the outermost system bordering Yamat, known for the number of people who perished settling its most temperate world, and the starsails lost exploring its minor but treacherous nexus. The system was held by Commandant Sang Han, while the province as a whole remains under the protection of Admiral Wan Kun\u2019s fleet. Wan Kun\u2019s, not Yen Shenar\u2019s; perhaps Heaven\u2019s Gate was doomed from the start.\n Although Admiral Wan Kun was inclined to dismiss the reports of Yamachin warsails as alarmism, the commandant knew better. Against protocol, he alerted Admiral Yen Shenar in the neighboring system, which almost saved us. It is bitter to realize that we could have held Cho against the invaders if we had been prepared for them when they first appeared.\n The outpost station\u2019s surviving logs report that Sang had one last dinner with his soldiers, passing the communal cup down the long tables. He joked with them about the hundred non-culinary uses for rice. Then he warned the leading Yamachin warsail, Hanei, that passage through Cho to invade our ally Feng-Huang would not be forthcoming, whatever the delusion of Yamat\u2019s chancellor-general.\n Hanei and its escort responded by opening fire.\n We are creatures of fire and water. We wither under a surfeit of light as readily as we wither beneath drowned hopes. When photons march soldier-fashion at an admiral\u2019s bidding, people die.\n When the Yamachin boarded the battlestation serving Heaven\u2019s Gate, Sang awaited them. By then, the station was all but shattered, a fruit for the pressing. Sang\u2019s eyes were shadowed by sleepless nights, his hair rumpled, his hands unsteady.\n The Hanei\u2019s captain, Sezhi Tomo, was the first to board the station. Cho\u2019s border stations knew his name. In the coming years, we would learn every nuance of anger or determination in that soft, suave voice. Sezhi spoke our language, and in times past he had been greeted as one of us. His chancellor-general had demanded his experience in dealing with Cho, however, and so he arrived as an invader, not a guest.\n \u201cCommandant,\u201d he said to Sang, \u201cI ask you and your soldiers to stand down. There\u2019s time yet for war to be averted. Surrender the white gun.\u201d Sezhi must have been aware of the irony of his words. He knew, as most Yamachin apparently did not, that a Chosar officer\u2019s white gun represented not only his rank but his loyalty to the nation. Its single shot is intended for suicide in dire straits.\n \u201cSezhi-kan,\u201d the commandant replied, addressing the other man by his Yamachin title, \u201cit was too late when your chancellor-general set his eye upon Feng-Huang.\u201d And when our government, faction-torn, failed to heed the diplomats\u2019 warning of Tsehan\u2019s ambitions; but he would not say that to a Yamachin. \u201cIt was too late when you opened fire on the station. I will not stand down.\u201d\n \u201cCommandant,\u201d said Sezhi even as his guards trained their rifles on Sang, \u201cplease. Heaven\u2019s Gate is lost.\u201d His voice dropped to a murmur. \u201cSang, it\u2019s over. At least save yourself and the people who are still alive.\u201d\n Small courtesies have power. In the records that made it out of Heaven\u2019s Gate, we see the temptation that sweeps over the commandant\u2019s face as he holds Sezhi\u2019s gaze. We see the moment when he decides that he won\u2019t break eye contact to look around at his haggard soldiers, and the moment when temptation breaks its grasp.\n Oh, yes: the cameras were transmitting to all the relays, with no thought as to who might be eavesdropping.\n \u201cI will surrender the white gun,\u201d Sang said, \u201cwhen you take it from me. Dying is easier than letting you pass.\u201d\n Sezhi\u2019s face held no more expression than night inside a nexus. \u201cThen take it I shall. Gentlemen.\u201d\n The commandant drew the white gun from its holster, keeping it at all times aimed at the floor. He was right-handed.\n The first shot took off Sang\u2019s right arm.\n His face was white as the blood spurted. He knelt\u2014or collapsed\u2014to pick up the white gun with his left hand, but had no strength left to stand.\n The second shot, from one of the soldiers behind Sezhi, took off his left arm.\n It\u2019s hard to tell whether shock finally caused Sang to slump as the soldiers\u2019 next twelve bullets slammed into him. A few patriots believe that Sang was going to pick up the white gun with his teeth before he died, but never had the opportunity. But the blood is indisputable.\n Sezhi Tomo, pale but dry-eyed, bowed over the commandant\u2019s fallen body, lifting his hand from heart to lips: a Chosar salute, never a Yamachin one. Sezhi paid for that among his own troops.\n And Yen\u2014Admiral, through no fault of your own, you received the news too late to save the commandant. Heaven\u2019s Gate, to our shame, fell in days.\n There is no need to recount our losses to Yamat\u2019s soldiers. Once their warsails had entered Cho\u2019s local space, they showed what a generation of civil war does for one\u2019s martial abilities. Our world-bound populations fell before them like summer leaves before winter winds. One general wrote, in a memorandum to the government, that \u201cdeath walks the only road left to us.\u201d The only hope was to stop them before they made planetfall, and we failed at that.\n We asked Feng-Huang for aid, but Feng-Huang was suspicious of our failure to inform them earlier of Yamat\u2019s imperial designs. So their warsail fleets and soldiers arrived too late to prevent the worst of the damage.\n It must pain you to look at the starsail battles lost, which you could have won so readily. It is easy to scorn Admiral Wan Kun for not being the tactician you are, less adept at using the nexuses\u2019 spacetime terrain to advantage. But what truly diminishes the man is the fact that he allowed rivalry to cloud his judgment. Instead of using his connections at court to disparage your victories and accuse you of treason, he could have helped unify the fractious factions in coming up with a strategy to defeat Yamat. Alas, he held a grudge against you for invading his jurisdiction at Heaven\u2019s Gate without securing prior permission.\n He never forgave you for eclipsing him. Even as he died in defeat, commanding the Chosar fleet that you had led so effectively, he must have been bitter. But they say this last battle at Yellow Splendor will decide everything. Forget his pettiness, Yen. He is gone, and it is no longer important.\n \u201cI have your file,\u201d the man said to Yen Shenar. His dark blue uniform did not show any rank insignia, but there was a white gun in his holster. \u201cI would appeal to your loyalty, but the programmer assigned to you noted that this was unlikely to succeed.\u201d\n \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d Yen said. They were in a room with high windows and paintings of carp. The guards had given him plain clothing, also in dark blue, a small improvement on the gray that all prisoners wore.\n The man smiled. \u201cNecessity,\u201d he said. \u201cYour military acumen is needed.\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps the government should have considered that before they put me here,\u201d Yen said.\n \u201cYou speak as though the government were a unified entity.\u201d\n As if he could forget. The court\u2019s inability to face in the same direction at the same time was legendary.\n \u201cYou were not without allies, even then,\u201d the man said.\n Yen tipped his head up: he was not a short man, but the other was taller. \u201cThe government has a flawed understanding of \u2018military acumen,\u2019 you know.\u201d\n The man raised an eyebrow.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just winning at baduk or other strategy games, or the ability to put starsails in pretty arrangements,\u201d Yen said. \u201cIt is leadership; it is inspiring people, and knowing who is worth inspiring; it is honoring your ancestors with your service. And,\u201d he added dryly, \u201cit is knowing enough about court politics to avoid being put in the Garden, where your abilities do you no good.\u201d\n \u201cPeople are the sum of their loyalties,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou told me that once.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m expected to recognize you?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d the man said frankly. \u201cI told them so. We all know how reprogramming works. There\u2019s no hope of restoring what you were.\u201d There was no particular emotion in his voice. \u201cBut they insisted that I try.\u201d\n \u201cTell me who you are.\u201d\n \u201cYou have no way of verifying the information,\u201d the man said.\n Yen laughed shortly. \u201cI\u2019m curious anyway.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m your nephew,\u201d the man said. \u201cMy name wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you.\u201d At Yen\u2019s scrutiny, he said, \u201cYou used to remark on how I take after my mother.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m surprised the government didn\u2019t send me back to the Ministry of Virtuous Thought to ensure my cooperation anyway,\u201d Yen said.\n \u201cThey were afraid it would damage you beyond repair,\u201d he said.\n \u201cDid the programmer tell them so?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve only spoken to her once,\u201d the man said.\n This was the important part, and this supposed nephew of his didn\u2019t even realize it. \u201cDid she have anything else to say?\u201d\n The man studied him for a long moment, then nodded. \u201cShe said you are not the sum of your loyalties, you are the sum of your choices.\u201d\n \u201cI did not choose to be here,\u201d Yen said, because it would be expected of him, although it was not true. Presumably, given that he had known what the king\u2019s decree was to be, he could have committed suicide or defected. He was a strategist now and had been a strategist then. This course of action had to have been chosen for a reason.\n He realized now that the Yen Shenar of yesteryear might not have been a man willing to intrigue against his enemies, even where it would have saved him his command. But he had been ready to become one who would, even for the sake of a government that had been willing to discard his service.\n The man was frowning. \u201cWill you accept your reinstatement into the military?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Yen said. \u201cYes.\u201d He was the weapon that he had made of himself, in a life he remembered only through shadows and fissures. It was time to test his forging, to ensure that the government would never be in a position to trap him in the Garden again.\n This is the story the way they are telling it now. I do not know how much of it to believe. Surely it is impossible that you outmatched the Yamachin fleet when it was five times the size of your own; surely it is impossible that over half the Yamachin starsails were destroyed or captured. But the royal historians say it is so.\n There has been rejoicing in the temporary capital: red banners in every street, fragrant blossoms scattered at every doorway. Children play with starsails of folded paper, pretending to vanquish the Yamachin foe, and even the thralls have memorized the famous poem commemorating your victory at Yellow Splendor.\n They say you will come home soon. I hope that is true.\n But all I can think of is how, the one time I met you, you did not wear the white gun. I wonder if you wear it now.\n for my parents, with additional thanks to Prof. Barry S.

I was one of those nerdy children who took books to recess and preferred novels for adults when I was eleven.\nI\u2019m guessing you know the type. Or are the type. My parents encouraged this and bought me whatever books I wanted. It was pretty awesome. It also shouldn\u2019t be particularly surprising that the first place I was really made aware of queer people was in fiction.\nI knew what gay people were, of course. I\u2019d heard other kids in the lunchroom making homophobic comments, so I understood the basic concept, as it were. But the truth is, I was still pretty far away from anything involving sex. Just didn\u2019t think much about it. In the books I read, I understood what was going on when the wizard and the lady got naked. It just wasn\u2019t that interesting. I wanted to see magic of a more literal nature.\nThat is, until I read the Mercedes Lackey\u2019s The Last Herald-Mage. Like many fantasy series, it\u2019s populated with wizards and bards. Only the main character is a gay man.\nI wish I could remember more of my reaction upon first reading it The Last Herald-Mage. I have only a fleeting memory: that it wasn\u2019t a very big deal. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s because of Lackey\u2019s treatment of the matter. I don\u2019t want to say the series is about being gay; it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s a fantasy epic, but Lackey approached her hero Vanyel Ashkevrons\u2019s sexuality as though she were writing for readers who didn\u2019t actually know any gay people. She showed us Vanyel\u2019s sexuality and explained that it was natural and nothing to be ashamed of, even if Vanyel felt ashamed.\nThe Last Herald-Mage turned me from someone who had never thought about sexuality to someone who had no problem with the gay aspect of it. After all, if gay people could be wizards, they were just as awesome as everyone else, right?\nMy own coming out was pretty low-key. I grew up in New York City; I have liberal, loving parents; I went to a school that prided itself on ethical PC-ness; and I wasn\u2019t the only queer kid in class. I didn\u2019t struggle much. But I think back on Mercedes Lackey a lot\u2014how I came across that book, and how it prepared me, during my tween years, to be okay with who I was once I started getting crushes on other guys.\nI don\u2019t remember how I found Lackey\u2019s books. Were they given to me? Did I find them in the bookstore, saw that they had both bards and wizards, and simply wanted them on those merits? I wish I could remember. All I know is that I was damned lucky I found them. And I also know that if I hadn\u2019t been brought up in a supportive environment, one series of books wouldn\u2019t have been nearly enough.\nBut what about kids today? As the battle for queer rights has become more and more visible, these rights have also, in many respects, become more controversial. With the fight for gay marriage, the conservative fight against it, and the rash of tragic, queer teen suicides, it would seem as though queer characters would be popping up all over in SFF. After all, those geeky kids who get teased at school\u2014whether they\u2019re actually queer or just being called it\u2014are the sorts of kids we were in high school. Or at least a lot of us. Marginalized, branded as outsiders, teased for being weird or different\u2014and killing themselves because they\u2019re queer. And to be queer, they\u2019re told, is to be different.\nOf all the people out there who didn\u2019t grow up queer, you\u2019d think straight geeks would be the most sympathetic\u2014and the most understanding. Shouldn\u2019t the SFF community be looking out for these kids?\nSome within the community are. Malinda Lo has penned some amazing queer YA fantasy. Brit Mandelo writes an entire column on Tor.com called \u201cQueering SFF\u201d and has edited a new anthology called Beyond Binary: Genderqueer and Sexually Fluid Speculative Fiction. Cherie Priest featured a transgendered character in one of her Clockwork Century novels. There are queer SFF groups, like Geeks Out and Outer Alliance.\nThese examples stand out to me, though, because they\u2019re few and far between and don\u2019t get much notice. Even most romantic comedies today feature a stereotypical gay friend. It\u2019s not the best representation, but at least we\u2019re there. In SFF, we\u2019re strangely invisible.\nFailing to see queer characters in fiction doesn\u2019t just damage queer kids. Parents read SFF, too. If queer kids have a parent who has never known a queer person in their life, they\u2019ll be much more equipped for raising a queer child if they\u2019ve read queer characters written as actual human beings\u2014and not flat stereotypes or, worse, somehow wrong or immoral.\nOn the whole, the SFF community seems to me to be divided into three camps. First, the openly homophobic types, who for personal an/or religious reasons\u2014or because they think it\u2019s \u201cevolutionarily backwards\u201d (just like the other 200-plus species who practice homosexuality, right?)\u2014feel queer people don\u2019t deserve to be treated like actual human beings.\nIn the second camp we have the pro-queer types who love queer characters in their fiction and often are queer themselves.\nThe third camp, though, makes up the majority of the SFF community: folks who just don\u2019t think about it. These are usually straight dudes who grew up pretty geeky, and who often are still mostly\u2014and hopefully comfortably\u2014geeky. But they just don\u2019t give much thought to queer folks. If they did, they\u2019d probably be cool with them; many probably consider themselves pro-gay rights.\nBut when it comes to their SFF, this third group finds it odd when there\u2019s a gay character. Some say things like \u201cI just can\u2019t relate to a queer character, cause I\u2019m straight,\u201d but most seem surprised by the inclusion of queer characters. Some say they find the emphasis on sexuality to be heavy-handed\u2014even when the emphasis on the queer character\u2019s sexuality is equal to or less than the emphasis placed on the straight character\u2019s sexuality. When a straight guy kisses a girl, it\u2019s the norm; when a gay guy kisses a guy, it\u2019s emphasizing their sexuality.\nI don\u2019t think people who hold this view are homophobes. They\u2019re just used to their SFF being queer-free, and they feel startled by the inclusion of queer character. These are the folks I think are ready to open their minds. I don\u2019t want them to be startled. Ideally, I don\u2019t want them to think it\u2019s any different than straight characters being included. For a start, though, I\u2019d love to see them be happy to encounter queer characters. And I think they can be. They just need a little more prodding. And by prodding I mean more queer characters.\nSo the next time you read a book where there\u2019s a heterosexual romantic pairing, don\u2019t just accept it. Let that fact surprise you the way a queer romance might. Imagine how it makes that high-school kid feel, the one who still hasn\u2019t found queer SFF. Think of how they look at every straight character in the books they read and are expected to relate to a straight character\u2014but you, on the other hand, get surprised and kinda weirded out by one queer one. If they can relate, can\u2019t you?\nI\u2019m not saying every story needs a queer character. Or that it\u2019s a writer\u2019s responsibility to do more than tell a great story. But I do think it\u2019s time for all of us\u2014straight folks included\u2014to think more about where queer characters fit into SFF. And where we stand in that audience. A straight romantic lead is all well and good, but a queer romantic lead could make some teenager feel better about him or herself.\nBut we\u2019re not going to get more queer characters without demanding them. Straight readers, we need your help\u2014you should be asking for queer characters, too. You should be hoping for them. You should be happy about them, not surprised by them. Remember that we queer folks exist, and we exist in the world of SFF, too. That\u2019s how you show us support; that\u2019s how you take queer characters in SFF from invisible to natural.\nWe appreciate your support in politics. We love when you say you\u2019re for gay marriage. But you can do more. After all, if you\u2019re going to support us in the real world, you can support us in every world.\nLev AC Rosen is the author of the critically acclaimed All Men of Genius, which was an Amazon best of the month, on over a dozen best of the year lists, and has been nominated for multiple awards.

The morgue was quiet then, cool and faintly damp. Hank savored this time of night and the faint shadow of contentment it allowed him, like a cup of bitter coffee, long grown cold, waiting for his occasional sip. He liked being alone and not thinking. His rod and tackle box waited by the door, in case he felt like going fishing after his shift, though he rarely did. There was a copy of Here Be Dragons: Mapping the Human Genome in case he did not.\n He had opened up a drowning victim and was reeling out her intestines arm over arm, scanning them quickly and letting them down in loops into a galvanized bucket. It was unlikely he was going to find anything, but all deaths by violence got an autopsy. He whistled tunelessly as he worked.\n The bell from the loading dock rang.\n \u201cHell.\u201d Hank put down his work, peeled off the latex gloves, and went to the intercom. \u201cSam? That you?\u201d Then, on the sheriff\u2019s familiar grunt, he buzzed the door open. \u201cWhat have you got for me this time?\u201d\n \u201cAccident casualty.\u201d Sam Aldridge didn\u2019t meet his eye, and that was unusual. There was a gurney behind him, and on it something too large to be a human body, covered by canvas. The ambulance was already pulling away, which was so contrary to proper protocols as to be alarming.\n \u201cThat sure doesn\u2019t look like\u2014\u201d Hank began.\n A woman stepped out of the darkness.\n It was Evelyn.\n \u201cBoy, the old dump hasn\u2019t changed one bit, has it? I\u2019ll bet even the calendar on the wall\u2019s the same. Did the county ever spring for a diener for the night shift?\u201d\n \u201cI . . . I\u2019m still working alone.\u201d\n \u201cWheel it in, Sam, and I\u2019ll take over from here. Don\u2019t worry about me, I know where everything goes.\u201d Evelyn took a deep breath and shook her head in disgust. \u201cChrist. It\u2019s just like riding a bicycle. You never forget. Want to or not.\u201d\n After the paperwork had been taken care of and Sheriff Sam was gone, Hank said, \u201cBelieve it or not, I had regained some semblance of inner peace, Evelyn. Just a little. It took me years. And now this. It\u2019s like a kick in the stomach. I don\u2019t see how you can justify doing this to me.\u201d\n \u201cEasiest thing in the world, sweetheart.\u201d Evelyn suppressed a smirk that nobody but Hank could have even noticed, and flipped back the canvas. \u201cTake a look.\u201d\n It was a Worm.\n Hank found himself leaning low over the heavy, swollen body, breathing deep of its heady alien smell, suggestive of wet earth and truffles with sharp hints of ammonia. He thought of the ships in orbit, blind locomotives ten miles long. The photographs of these creatures didn\u2019t do them justice. His hands itched to open this one up.\n \u201cThe Agency needs you to perform an autopsy.\u201d\n Hank drew back. \u201cLet me get this straight. You\u2019ve got the corpse of an alien creature. A representative of the only other intelligent life form that the human race has ever encountered. Yet with all the forensic scientists you have on salary, you decide to hand it over to a lowly county coroner?\u201d\n \u201cWe need your imagination, Hank. Anybody can tell how they\u2019re put together. We want to know how they think.\u201d\n \u201cYou told me I didn\u2019t have an imagination. When you left me.\u201d His words came out angrier than he\u2019d intended, but he couldn\u2019t find it in himself to apologize for their tone. \u201cSo, again\u2014why me?\u201d\n \u201cWhat I said was, you couldn\u2019t imagine bettering yourself. For anything impractical, you have imagination in spades. Now I\u2019m asking you to cut open an alien corpse. What could be less practical?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not going to get a straight answer out of you, am I?\u201d\n Evelyn\u2019s mouth quirked up in a little smile so that for the briefest instant she was the woman he had fallen in love with, a million years ago. His heart ached to see it. \u201cYou never got one before,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s not screw up a perfectly good divorce by starting now.\u201d\n \u201cLet me put a fresh chip in my dictation device,\u201d Hank said. \u201cGrab a smock and some latex gloves. You\u2019re going to assist.\u201d\n \u201cReady,\u201d Evelyn said.\n Hank hit record, then stood over the Worm, head down, for a long moment. Getting in the zone. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s start with a gross physical examination. Um, what we have looks a lot like an annelid, rather blunter and fatter than the terrestrial equivalent and of course much larger. Just eyeballing it, I\u2019d say this thing is about eight feet long, maybe two feet and a half in diameter. I could just about get my arms around it if I tried. There are three, five, seven, make that eleven somites, compared to say one or two hundred in an earthworm. No clitellum, so we\u2019re warned not to take the annelid similarity too far.\n \u201cThe body is bluntly tapered at each end, and somewhat depressed posteriorly. The ventral side is flattened and paler than the dorsal surface. There\u2019s a tripartite beak-like structure at one end, I\u2019m guessing this is the mouth, and what must be an anus at the other. Near the beak are five swellings from which extend stiff, bone-like structures\u2014mandibles, maybe? I\u2019ll tell you, though, they look more like tools. This one might almost be a wrench, and over here a pair of grippers. They seem awfully specialized for an intelligent creature. Evelyn, you\u2019ve dealt with these things, is there any variation within the species? I mean, do some have this arrangement of manipulators and others some other structure?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen any two of the aliens with the same arrangement of manipulators.\u201d\n \u201cReally? That\u2019s interesting. I wonder what it means. Okay, the obvious thing here is there are no apparent external sensory organs. No eyes, ears, nose. My guess is that whatever senses these things might have, they\u2019re functionally blind.\u201d\n \u201cIntelligence is of that opinion too.\u201d\n \u201cWell, it must have shown in their behavior, right? So that\u2019s an easy one. Here\u2019s my first extrapolation: You\u2019re going to have a bitch of a time understanding these things. Human beings rely on sight more than most animals, and if you trace back philosophy and science, they both have strong roots in optics. Something like this is simply going to think differently from us.\n \u201cNow, looking between the somites\u2014the rings\u2014we find a number of tiny hairlike structures, and if we pull the rings apart, so much as we can, there\u2019re all these small openings, almost like tiny anuses if there weren\u2019t so many of them, closed with sphincter muscles, maybe a hundred of them, and it looks like they\u2019re between each pair of somites. Oh, here\u2019s something\u2014the structures near the front, the swellings, are a more developed form of these little openings. Okay, now we turn the thing over. I\u2019ll take this end you take the other. Right, now I want you to rock it by my count, and on the three we\u2019ll flip it over. Ready? One, two, three!\u201d\n The corpse slowly flipped over, almost overturning the gurney. The two of them barely managed to control it.\n \u201cThat was a close one,\u201d Hank said cheerily. \u201cHuh. What\u2019s this?\u201d He touched a line of painted numbers on the alien\u2019s underbelly. Rt-Front/No. 43.\n \u201cNever you mind what that is. Your job is to perform the autopsy.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got more than one corpse.\u201d\n Evelyn said nothing.\n \u201cNow that I say it out loud, of course you do. You\u2019ve got dozens. If you only had the one, I\u2019d never have gotten to play with it. You have doctors of your own. Good researchers, some of them, who would cut open their grandmothers if they got the grant money. Hell, even forty-three would\u2019ve been kept in-house. You must have hundreds, right?\u201d\n For a fraction of a second, that exquisite face went motionless. Evelyn probably wasn\u2019t even aware of doing it, but Hank knew from long experience that she\u2019d just made a decision. \u201cMore like a thousand. There was a very big accident. It\u2019s not on the news yet, but one of the Worms\u2019 landers went down in the Pacific.\u201d\n \u201cOh Jesus.\u201d Hank pulled his gloves off, shoved up his glasses and ground his palms into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your war at last, haven\u2019t you? You\u2019ve picked a fight with creatures that have tremendous technological superiority over us, and they don\u2019t even live here! All they have to do is drop a big enough rock into our atmosphere and there\u2019ll be a mass extinction the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen since the dinosaurs died out. They won\u2019t care. It\u2019s not their planet!\u201d\n Evelyn\u2019s face twisted into an expression he hadn\u2019t known it could form until just before the end of their marriage, when everything fell apart. \u201cStop being such an ass,\u201d she said. Then, talking fast and earnestly, \u201cWe didn\u2019t cause the accident. It was just dumb luck it happened, but once it did we had to take advantage of it. Yes, the Worms probably have the technology to wipe us out. So we have to deal with them. But to deal with them we have to understand them, and we do not. They\u2019re a mystery to us. We don\u2019t know what they want. We don\u2019t know how they think. But after tonight we\u2019ll have a little better idea. Provided only that you get back to work.\u201d\n Hank went to the table and pulled a new pair of gloves off the roll. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cJust keep in mind that it\u2019s not just my ass that\u2019s riding on this,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s yours and everyone\u2019s you know.\u201d\n \u201cI said okay!\u201d Hank took a long breath, calming himself. \u201cNext thing to do is cut this sucker open.\u201d He picked up a bone saw. \u201cThis is bad technique, but we\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d The saw whined to life, and he cut through the leathery brown skin from beak to anus. \u201cAll right, now we peel the skin back. It\u2019s wet-feeling and a little crunchy. The musculature looks much like that of a Terrestrial annelid. Structurally, that is. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite that color black. Damn! The skin keeps curling back.\u201d\n He went to his tackle box and removed a bottle of fishhooks. \u201cHere. We\u2019ll take a bit of nylon filament, tie two hooks together, like this, with about two inches of line between them. Then we hook the one through the skin, fold it down, and push the other through the cloth on the gurney. Repeat the process every six inches on both sides. That should hold it open.\u201d\n \u201cGot it.\u201d Evelyn set to work.\n Some time later they were done, and Hank stared down into the opened Worm. \u201cYou want speculation? Here goes: This thing moves through the mud, or whatever the medium is there, face-first and blind. What does that suggest to you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d say that they\u2019d be used to coming up against the unexpected.\u201d\n \u201cVery good. Haul back on this, I\u2019m going to cut again. . . . Okay, now we\u2019re past the musculature and there\u2019s a fluffy mass of homogeneous stuff, we\u2019ll come back to that in a minute. Cutting through the fluff . . . and into the body cavity and it\u2019s absolutely chockablock with zillions of tiny little organs.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s keep our terminology at least vaguely scientific, shall we?\u201d Evelyn said.\n \u201cWell, there are more than I want to count. Literally hundreds of small organs under the musculature, I have no idea what they\u2019re for but they\u2019re all interconnected with vein-like tubing in various sizes. This is ferociously more complicated than human anatomy. It\u2019s like a chemical plant in here. No two of the organs are the same so far as I can tell, although they all have a generic similarity. Let\u2019s call them alembics, so we don\u2019t confuse them with any other organs we may find. I see something that looks like a heart maybe, an isolated lump of muscle the size of my fist, there are three of them. Now I\u2019m cutting deeper . . . Holy shit!\u201d\n For a long minute, Hank stared into the opened alien corpse. Then he put the saw down on the gurney and, shaking his head, turned away. \u201cWhere\u2019s that coffee?\u201d he said.\n Without saying a word, Evelyn went to the coffee station and brought him his cold cup.\n Hank yanked his gloves, threw them in the trash, and drank.\n \u201cAll right,\u201d Evelyn said, \u201cso what was it?\u201d\n \u201cYou mean you can\u2019t see\u2014no, of course you can\u2019t. With you, it was human anatomy all the way.\u201d\n \u201cI took invertebrate biology in college.\u201d\n \u201cAnd forgot it just as fast as you could. Okay, look: Up here is the beak, semi-retractable. Down here is the anus. Food goes in one, waste comes out the other. What do you see between?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a tube. The gut?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. It runs straight from the mouth to the anus, without interruption. Nothing in between. How does it eat without a stomach? How does it stay alive?\u201d He saw from Evelyn\u2019s expression that she was not impressed. \u201cWhat we see before us is simply not possible.\u201d\n \u201cYet here it is. So there\u2019s an explanation. Find it.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Glaring at the Worm\u2019s innards, he drew on a new pair of gloves. \u201cLet me take a look at that beak again. . . . Hah. See how the muscles are connected? The beak relaxes open, aaand\u2014let\u2019s take a look at the other end\u2014so does the anus. So this beast crawls through the mud, mouth wide open, and the mud passes through it unhindered. That\u2019s bound to have some effect on its psychological makeup.\u201d\n \u201cLike what?\u201d\n \u201cDamned if I know. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the gut . . . There are rings of intrusive tissue near the beak one third of the way in, two thirds in, and just above the anus. We cut through and there is extremely fine structure, but nothing we\u2019re going to figure out tonight. Oh, hey, I think I got it. Look at these three flaps just behind . . . \u201d\n He cut in silence for a while. \u201cThere. It has three stomachs. They\u2019re located in the head, just behind the first ring of intrusive tissue. The mud or whatever is dumped into this kind of holding chamber, and then there\u2019s this incredible complex of muscles, and\u2014how many exit tubes?\u2014this one has got, um, fourteen. I\u2019ll trace one, and it goes right to this alembic. The next one goes to another alembic. I\u2019ll trace this one and it goes to\u2014yep, another alembic. There\u2019s a pattern shaping up here.\n \u201cLet\u2019s put this aside for the moment, and go back to those masses of fluff. Jeeze, there\u2019s a lot of this stuff. It must make up a good third of the body mass. Which has trilateral symmetry, by the way. Three masses of fluff proceed from head to tail, beneath the muscle sheath, all three connecting about eight inches below the mouth, into a ring around the straight gut. This is where the arms or manipulators or screwdrivers or whatever they are, grow. Now, at regular intervals the material puts out little arms, outgrowths that fine down to wire-like structures of the same material, almost like very thick nerves. Oh God. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d He drew back, and with a scalpel flensed the musculature away to reveal more of the mass. \u201cIt\u2019s the central nervous system. This thing has a brain that weighs at least a hundred pounds. I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t want to believe it.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cOur people in Bethesda have done slide studies. You\u2019re looking at the thing\u2019s brain.\u201d\n \u201cIf you already knew the answer, then why the hell are you putting me through this?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not here to answer your questions. You\u2019re here to answer mine.\u201d\n Annoyed, Hank bent over the Worm again. There was rich stench of esters from the creature, pungent and penetrating, and the slightest whiff of what he guessed was putrefaction. \u201cWe start with the brain, and trace one of the subordinate ganglia inward. Tricky little thing, it goes all over the place, and ends up right here, at one of the alembics. We\u2019ll try another one, and it . . . ends up at an alembic. There are a lot of these things, let\u2019s see\u2014hey\u2014here\u2019s one that goes to one of the structures in the straight gut. What could that be? A tongue! That\u2019s it, there\u2019s a row of tongues just within the gut, and more to taste the medium flowing through, yeah. And these little flapped openings just behind them open when the mud contains specific nutrients the worm desires. Okay, now we\u2019re getting somewhere, how long have we been at this?\u201d\n \u201cAbout an hour and a half.\u201d\n \u201cIt feels like longer.\u201d He thought of getting some more coffee, decided against it. \u201cSo what have we got here? All that enormous brain mass\u2014what\u2019s it for?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe it\u2019s all taken up by raw intelligence.\u201d\n \u201cRaw intelligence! No such thing. Nature doesn\u2019t evolve intelligence without a purpose. It\u2019s got to be used for something. Let\u2019s see. A fair amount is taken up by taste, obviously. It has maybe sixty individual tongues, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if its sense of taste were much more detailed than ours. Plus all those little alembics performing god-knows-what kind of chemical reactions.\n \u201cLet\u2019s suppose for a minute that it can consciously control those reactions, that would account for a lot of the brain mass. When the mud enters at the front, it\u2019s tasted, maybe a little is siphoned off and sent through the alembics for transformation. Waste products are jetted into the straight gut, and pass through several more circles of tongues . . . Here\u2019s another observation for you: These things would have an absolute sense of the state of their own health. They can probably create their own drugs, too. Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t come across any evidence of disease here.\u201d The Worm\u2019s smell was heavy, penetratingly pervasive. He felt slightly dizzy, shook it off.\n \u201cOkay, so we\u2019ve got a creature that concentrates most of its energy and attention internally. It slides through an easy medium, and at the same time the mud slides through it. It tastes the mud as it passes, and we can guess that the mud will be in a constant state of transformation, so it experiences the universe more directly than do we.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt appears to be a verb.\u201d\n \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\n \u201cOne of Buckminster Fuller\u2019s aphorisms. But it fits. The worm constantly transforms the universe. It takes in all it comes across, accepts it, changes it, and excretes it. It is an agent of change.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s very clever. But it doesn\u2019t help us deal with them.\u201d\n \u201cWell, of course not. They\u2019re intelligent, and intelligence complicates everything. But if you wanted me to generalize, I\u2019d say the Worms are straightforward and accepting\u2014look at how they move blindly ahead\u2014but that their means of changing things are devious, as witness the mass of alembics. That\u2019s going to be their approach to us. Straightforward, yet devious in ways we just don\u2019t get. Then, when they\u2019re done with us, they\u2019ll pass on without a backward glance.\u201d\n \u201cTerrific. Great stuff. Get back to work.\u201d\n \u201cLook, Evelyn. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019ve done all I can, and a pretty damned good job at that, I think. I could use a rest.\u201d\n \u201cYou haven\u2019t dealt with the stuff near the beak. The arms or whatever.\u201d\n \u201cCripes.\u201d Hank turned back to the corpse, cut open an edema, began talking. \u201cThe material of the arms is stiff and osseous, rather like teeth. This one has several moving parts, all controlled by muscles anchored alongside the edema. There\u2019s a nest of ganglia here, connected by a very short route to the brain matter. Now I\u2019m cutting into the brain matter, and there\u2019s a small black gland, oops I\u2019ve nicked it. Whew. What a smell. Now I\u2019m cutting behind it.\u201d Behind the gland was a small white structure, square and hard meshwork, looking like a cross between an instrument chip and a square of Chex cereal.\n Keeping his back to Evelyn, he picked it up.\n He put it in his mouth.\n He swallowed.\n What have I done? he thought. Aloud, he said, \u201cAs an operating hypothesis I\u2019d say that the manipulative structures have been deliberately, make that consciously, grown. There, I\u2019ve traced one of those veins back to the alembics. So that explains why there\u2019s no uniformity, these things would grow exterior manipulators on need, and then discard them when they\u2019re done. Yes, look, the muscles don\u2019t actually connect to the manipulators, they wrap around them.\u201d\n There was a sour taste on his tongue.\n I must be insane, he thought.\n \u201cDid you just eat something?\u201d\n Keeping his expression blank, Hank said, \u201cAre you nuts? You mean did I put part of this . . . creature . . . in my mouth?\u201d There was a burning within his brain, a buzzing like the sound of the rising sun picked up on a radio telescope. He wanted to scream, but his face simply smiled and said, \u201cDo you\u2014?\u201d And then it was very hard to concentrate on what he was saying. He couldn\u2019t quite focus on Evelyn, and there were white rays moving starburst across his vision and\u2014\n When he came to, Hank was on the Interstate, doing ninety. His mouth was dry and his eyelids felt gritty. Bright yellow light was shining in his eyes from a sun that had barely lifted itself up above over the horizon. He must have been driving for hours. The steering wheel felt tacky and gummy. He looked down.\n There was blood on his hands. It went all the way up to his elbows.\n The traffic was light. Hank had no idea where he was heading, nor any desire whatsoever to stop.\n So he just kept driving.\n Whose blood was it on his hands? Logic said it was Evelyn\u2019s. But that made no sense. Hate her though he did\u2014and the sight of her had opened wounds and memories he\u2019d thought cauterized shut long ago\u2014he wouldn\u2019t actually hurt her. Not physically. He wouldn\u2019t actually kill her.\n Would he?\n It was impossible. But there was the blood on his hands. Whose else could it be? Some of it might be his own, admittedly. His hands ached horribly. They felt like he\u2019d been pounding them into something hard, over and over again. But most of the blood was dried and itchy. Except for where his skin had split at the knuckles, he had no wounds of any kind. So the blood wasn\u2019t his.\n \u201cOf course you did,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cYou beat me to death and you enjoyed every minute of it.\u201d\n Hank shrieked and almost ran off the road. He fought the car back and then turned and stared in disbelief. Evelyn sat in the passenger seat beside him.\n \u201cYou . . . how did . . . ?\u201d Much as he had with the car, Hank seized control of himself. \u201cYou\u2019re a hallucination,\u201d he said.\n \u201cRight in one!\u201d Evelyn applauded lightly. \u201cOr a memory, or the personification of your guilt, however you want to put it. You always were a bright man, Hank. Not so bright as to be able to keep your wife from walking out on you, but bright enough for government work.\u201d\n \u201cYour sleeping around was not my fault.\u201d\n \u201cOf course it was. You think you walked in on me and Jerome by accident? A woman doesn\u2019t hate her husband enough to arrange something like that without good reason.\u201d\n \u201cOh god, oh god, oh god.\u201d\n \u201cThe fuel light is blinking. You\u2019d better find a gas station and fill up.\u201d\n A Lukoil station drifted into sight, so he pulled into it and stopped the car by a full service pump. When he got out, the service station attendant hurried toward him and then stopped, frozen.\n \u201cOh no,\u201d the attendant said. He was a young man with sandy hair. \u201cNot another one.\u201d\n \u201cAnother one?\u201d Hank slid his card through the reader. \u201cWhat do you mean another one?\u201d He chose high-test and began pumping, all the while staring hard at the attendant. All but daring him to try something. \u201cExplain yourself.\u201d\n \u201cAnother one like you.\u201d The attendant couldn\u2019t seem to look away from Hank\u2019s hands. \u201cThe cops came right away and arrested the first one. It took five of them to get him into the car. Then another one came and when I called, they said to just take down his license number and let him go. They said there were people like you showing up all over.\u201d\n Hank finished pumping and put the nozzle back on its hook. He did not push the button for a receipt. \u201cDon\u2019t try to stop me,\u201d he said. The words just came and he said them. \u201cI\u2019d hurt you very badly if you did.\u201d\n The young man\u2019s eyes jerked upward. He looked spooked. \u201cWhat are you people?\u201d\n Hank paused, with his hand on the door. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n \u201cYou should have told him,\u201d Evelyn said when he got back in the car. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cShut up.\u201d\n \u201cYou ate something out of that Worm and it\u2019s taken over part of your brain. You still feel like yourself, but you\u2019re not in control. You\u2019re sitting at the wheel but you have no say over where you\u2019re going. Do you?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Hank admitted. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you think it is\u2014some kind of super-prion? Like mad cow disease, only faster than fast? A neuroprogrammer, maybe? An artificial overlay to your personality that feeds off of your brain and shunts your volition into a dead end?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the imagination. This would seem to be your sort of thing. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not all over it.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Hank said. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not at all surprised.\u201d\n They drove on in silence for a time.\n \u201cDo you remember when we first met? In med school? You were going to be a surgeon then.\u201d\n \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cRainy autumn afternoons in that ratty little third-floor walk-up of yours. With that great big aspen with the yellow leaves outside the window. It seemed like there was always at least one stuck to the glass. There were days when we never got dressed at all. We\u2019d spend all day in and out of that enormous futon you\u2019d bought instead of a bed, and it still wasn\u2019t large enough. If we rolled off the edge, we\u2019d go on making love on the floor. When it got dark, we\u2019d send out for Chinese.\u201d\n \u201cWe were happy then. Is that what you want me to say?\u201d\n \u201cIt was your hands I liked best. Feeling them on me. You\u2019d have one hand on my breast and the other between my legs and I\u2019d imagine you cutting open a patient. Peeling back the flesh to reveal all those glistening organs inside.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, now that\u2019s sick.\u201d\n \u201cYou asked me what I was thinking once and I told you. I was watching your face closely, because I really wanted to know you back then. You loved it. So I know you\u2019ve got demons inside you. Why not own up to them?\u201d\n He squeezed his eyes shut, but something inside him opened them again, so he wouldn\u2019t run the car off the road. A low moaning sound arose from somewhere deep in his throat. \u201cI must be in Hell.\u201d\n \u201cC\u2019mon. Be a sport. What could it hurt? I\u2019m already dead.\u201d\n \u201cThere are some things no man was meant to admit. Even to himself.\u201d\n Evelyn snorted. \u201cYou always were the most astounding prig.\u201d\n They drove on in silence for a while, deeper into the desert. At last, staring straight ahead of himself, Hank could not keep himself from saying, \u201cThere are worse revelations to come, aren\u2019t there?\u201d\n \u201cOh God, yes,\u201d his mother said.\n \u201cIt was your father\u2019s death.\u201d His mother sucked wetly on a cigarette. \u201cThat\u2019s what made you turn out the way you did. \u201d\n Hank could barely see the road for his tears. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t want to be having this conversation, Mom.\u201d\n \u201cNo, of course you don\u2019t. You never were big on self-awareness, were you? You preferred cutting open toads or hunching over that damned microscope.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of self-awareness. I\u2019ve got enough self-awareness to choke on. I can see where you\u2019re going and I am not going to apologize for how I felt about Dad. He died of cancer when I was thirteen. What did I ever do to anyone that was half so bad as what he did to me? So I don\u2019t want to hear any cheap Freudian bullshit about survivor guilt and failing to live up to his glorious example, okay?\u201d\n \u201cNobody said it wasn\u2019t hard on you. Particularly coming at the onset of puberty as it did.\u201d\n \u201cMom!\u201d\n \u201cWhat. I wasn\u2019t supposed to know? Who do you think did the laundry?\u201d His mother lit a new cigarette from the old one, then crushed out the butt in an ashtray. \u201cI knew a lot more of what was going on in those years than you thought I did, believe you me. All those hours you spent in the bathroom jerking off. The money you stole to buy dope with.\u201d\n \u201cI was in pain, Mom. And it\u2019s not as if you were any help.\u201d\n His mother looked at him with the same expression of weary annoyance he remembered so well. \u201cYou think there\u2019s something special about your pain? I lost the only man I ever loved and I couldn\u2019t move on because I had a kid to raise. Not a sweet little boy like I used to have either, but a sullen, self-pitying teenager. It took forever to get you shipped off to medical school.\u201d\n \u201cSo then you moved on. Right off the roof of the county office building. Way to honor Dad\u2019s memory, Mom. What do you think he would have said about that if he\u2019d known?\u201d\n Dryly, his mother said, \u201cAsk him for yourself.\u201d\n Hank closed his eyes.\n When he opened them, he was standing in the living room of his mother\u2019s house. His father stood in the doorway, as he had so many times, smoking an unfiltered Camel and staring through the screen door at the street outside. \u201cWell?\u201d Hank said at last.\n With a sigh his father turned around. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d His lips moved up into what might have been a smile on another man. \u201cDying was new to me.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, well you could have summoned the strength to tell me what was going on. But you couldn\u2019t be bothered. The surgeon who operated on you? Doctor Tomasini. For years I thought of him as my real father. And you know why? Because he gave it to me straight. He told me exactly what was going to happen. He told me to brace myself for the worst. He said that it was going to be bad but that I would find the strength to get through it. Nobody\u2019d ever talked to me like that before. Whenever I was in a rough spot, I\u2019d fantasize going to him and asking for advice. Because there was no one else I could ask.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry you hate me,\u201d his father said, not exactly looking at Hank. Then, almost mumbling, \u201cStill, lots of men hate their fathers, and somehow manage to make decent lives for themselves.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t hate you. You were just a guy who never got an education and never made anything of himself and knew it. You had a shitty job, a three-pack-a-day habit, and a wife who was a lush. And then you died.\u201d All the anger went out of Hank in an instant, like air whooshing out of a punctured balloon, leaving nothing behind but an aching sense of loss. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really anything there to hate.\u201d\n Abruptly, the car was filled with coil upon coil of glistening Worm. For an instant it looped outward, swallowing up car, Interstate, and all the world, and he was afloat in vacuum, either blind or somewhere perfectly lightless, and there was nothing but the Worm-smell, so strong he could taste it in his mouth.\n Then he was back on the road again, hands sticky on the wheel and sunlight in his eyes.\n \u201cBoy, does that explain a lot!\u201d Evelyn flashed her perfect teeth at him and beat on the top of the dashboard as if it were a drum. \u201cHow a guy as spectacularly unsuited for it as you are decided to become a surgeon. That perpetual cringe of failure you carry around on your shoulders. It even explains why, when push came to shove, you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to cut open living people. Afraid of what you might find there?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n \u201cI know that you froze up right in the middle of a perfectly routine appendectomy. What did you see in that body cavity?\u201d\n \u201cShut up.\u201d\n \u201cWas it the appendix? I bet it was. What did it look like?\u201d\n \u201cShut up.\u201d\n \u201cDid it look like a Worm?\u201d\n He stared at her in amazement. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m just a hallucination, remember? An undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of underdone potato. So the question isn\u2019t how did I know, but how did you know what a Worm was going to look like five years before their ships came into the Solar System?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a false memory, obviously.\u201d\n \u201cSo where did it come from?\u201d Evelyn lit up a cigarette. \u201cWe go off-road here.\u201d\n He slowed down and started across the desert. The car bucked and bounced. Sagebrush scraped against the sides. Dust blossomed up into the air behind them.\n \u201cFunny thing you calling your mother a lush,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cConsidering what happened after you bombed out of surgery.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve been clean for six years and four months. I still go to the meetings.\u201d\n \u201cSwell. The guy I married didn\u2019t need to.\u201d\n \u201cLook, this is old territory, do we really need to revisit it? We went over it so many times during the divorce.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been going over it in your head ever since. Over and over and . . . \u201d\n \u201cI want us to stop. That\u2019s all. Just stop.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s your call. I\u2019m only a symptom, remember? If you want to stop thinking, then just stop thinking.\u201d\n Unable to stop thinking, he continued eastward, ever eastward.\n For hours he drove, while they talked about every small and nasty thing he had done as a child, and then as an adolescent, and then as an alcoholic failure of a surgeon and a husband. Every time Hank managed to change the subject, Evelyn brought up something even more painful, until his face was wet with tears. He dug around in his pockets for a handkerchief. \u201cYou could show a little compassion, you know.\u201d\n \u201cOh, the way you\u2019ve shown me compassion? I offered to let you keep the car if you\u2019d just give me back the photo albums. So you took the albums into the back yard and burned them all, including the only photos of my grandmother I had. Remember that? But of course I\u2019m not real, am I? I\u2019m just your image of Evelyn\u2014and we both know you\u2019re not willing to concede her the least spark of human decency. Watch out for that gully! You\u2019d better keep your eyes straight ahead.\u201d\n They were on a dirt road somewhere deep in the desert now. That was as much as he knew. The car bucked and scraped its underside against the sand, and he downshifted again. A rock rattled down the underside, probably tearing holes in vital places.\n Then Hank noticed plumes of dust in the distance, smaller versions of the one billowing up behind him. So there were other vehicles out there. Now that he knew to look for them, he saw more. There were long slanted pillars of dust rising up in the middle distance and tiny gray nubs down near the horizon. Dozens of them, scores, maybe hundreds.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d he heard himself asking. \u201cHelicopters?\u201d\n \u201cSuch a clever little boy you are!\u201d\n One by one flying machines lifted over the horizon. Some of them were news copters. The rest looked to be military. The little ones darted here and there, filming. The big ones circled slowly around a distant glint of metal in the desert. They looked a lot like grasshoppers. They seemed afraid to get too close.\n \u201cSee there?\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cThat would be the lifter.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d Hank said.\n Then, slowly, he ventured, \u201cThe lander going down wasn\u2019t an accident, was it?\u201d\n \u201cNo, of course not. The Worms crashed it in the Pacific on purpose. They killed hundreds of their own so the bodies would be distributed as widely as possible. They used themselves as bait. They wanted to collect a broad cross-section of humanity.\n \u201cWhich is ironic, really, because all they\u2019re going to get is doctors, morticians, and academics. Some FBI agents, a few Homeland Security bureaucrats. No retirees, cafeteria ladies, jazz musicians, soccer coaches, or construction workers. Not one Guatemalan nun or Korean noodle chef. But how could they have known? They acted out of perfect ignorance of us and they got what they got.\u201d\n \u201cYou sound just like me,\u201d Hank said. Then, \u201cSo what now? Colored lights and anal probes?\u201d\n Evelyn snorted again. \u201cThey\u2019re a sort of hive culture. When one dies, it\u2019s eaten by the others and its memories are assimilated. So a thousand deaths wouldn\u2019t mean a lot to them. If individual memories were lost, the bulk of those individuals were already made up of the memories of previous generations. The better part of them would still be alive, back on the mother ship. Similarly, they wouldn\u2019t have any ethical problems with harvesting a few hundred human beings. Eating us, I mean, and absorbing our memories into their collective identity. They probably don\u2019t understand the concept of individual death. Even if they did, they\u2019d think we should be grateful for being given a kind of immortality.\u201d\n The car went over a boulder Hank hadn\u2019t noticed in time, bouncing him so high that his head hit the roof. Still, he kept driving.\n \u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d\n \u201cHow do you think I know?\u201d Ahead, the alien ship was growing larger. At its base were Worm upon Worm upon Worm, all facing outward, skin brown and glistening. \u201cCome on, Hank, do I have to spell it out for you?\u201d\n \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Captain Courageous,\u201d Evelyn said scornfully. \u201cIf this is what it takes.\u201d She stuck both her hands into her mouth and pulled outward. The skin to either side of her mouth stretched like rubber, then tore. Her face ripped in half.\n Loop after loop of slick brown flesh flopped down to spill across Hank\u2019s lap, slide over the back of the seat and fill up the rear of the car. The horridly familiar stench of Worm, part night soil and part chemical plant, took possession of him and would not let go. He found himself gagging, half from the smell and half from what it meant.\n A weary sense of futility grasped his shoulders and pushed down hard. \u201cThis is only a memory, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n One end of the Worm rose up and turned toward him. Its beak split open in three parts and from the moist interior came Evelyn\u2019s voice: \u201cThe answer to the question you haven\u2019t got the balls to ask is: Yes, you\u2019re dead. A Worm ate you and now you\u2019re passing slowly through an alien gut, being tasted and experienced and understood. You\u2019re nothing more than an emulation being run inside one of those hundred-pound brains.\u201d\n Hank stopped the car and got out. There was an arroyo between him and the alien ship that the car would never be able to get across. So he started walking.\n \u201cIt all feels so real,\u201d he said. The sun burned hot on his head, and the stones underfoot were hard. He could see other people walking determinedly through the shimmering heat. They were all converging on the ship.\n \u201cWell, it would, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Evelyn walked beside him in human form again. But when he looked back the way they had come, there was only one set of footprints.\n Hank had been walking in a haze of horror and resignation. Now it was penetrated by a sudden stab of fear. \u201cThis will end, won\u2019t it? Tell me it will. Tell me that you and I aren\u2019t going to keep cycling through the same memories over and over, chewing on our regrets forever?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re as sharp as ever, Hank,\u201d Evelyn said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. It passes the time between planets.\u201d\n \u201cFor how long?\u201d\n \u201cFor more years than you\u2019d think possible. Space is awfully big, you know. It takes thousands and thousands of years to travel from one star to another.\u201d\n \u201cThen . . . this really is Hell, after all. I mean, I can\u2019t imagine anything worse.\u201d\n She said nothing.\n They topped a rise and looked down at the ship. It was a tapering cylinder, smooth and featureless save for a ring of openings at the bottom from which emerged the front ends of many Worms. Converging upon it were people who had started earlier or closer than Hank and thus gotten here before he did. They walked straight and unhesitatingly to the nearest Worm and were snatched up and gulped down by those sharp, tripartite beaks. Snap and then swallow. After which, the Worm slid back into the ship and was replaced by another. Not one of the victims showed the least emotion. It was all as dispassionate as an abattoir for robots.\n These creatures below were monstrously large, taller than Hank was. The one he had dissected must have been a hatchling. A grub. It made sense. You wouldn\u2019t want to sacrifice any larger a percentage of your total memories than you had to.\n \u201cPlease.\u201d He started down the slope, waving his arms to keep his balance when the sand slipped underfoot. He was crying again, apparently; he could feel the tears running down his cheeks. \u201cEvelyn. Help me.\u201d\n Scornful laughter. \u201cCan you even imagine me helping you?\u201d\n \u201cNo, of course\u2014\u201d Hank cut that thought short. Evelyn, the real Evelyn, would not have treated him like this. Yes, she had hurt him badly, and by that time she left, she had been glad to do so. But she wasn\u2019t petty or cruel or vindictive before he made her that way.\n \u201cAccepting responsibility for the mess you made of your life, Hank? You?\u201d\n \u201cTell me what to do,\u201d Hank said, pushing aside his anger and resentment, trying to remember Evelyn as she had once been. \u201cGive me a hint.\u201d\n For a maddeningly long moment Evelyn was silent. Then she said, \u201cIf the Worm that ate you so long ago could only communicate directly with you . . . what one question do you think it would ask?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cI think it would be, \u2018Why are all your memories so ugly?\u2019 \u201d\n Unexpectedly, she gave him a peck on the cheek.\n Hank had arrived. His Worm\u2019s beak opened. Its breath smelled like Evelyn on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Hank stared at the glistening blackness within. So enticing. He wanted to fling himself down it.\n Once more into the gullet, he thought, and took a step closer to the Worm and the soothing darkness it encompassed.\n Its mouth gaped wide, waiting to ingest and transform him.\n Unbidden, then, a memory rose up within Hank of a night when their marriage was young and, traveling through Louisiana, he and Evelyn stopped on an impulse at a roadhouse where there was a zydeco band and beer in bottles and they were happy and in love and danced and danced and danced into an evening without end. It had seemed then that all good things would last forever.\n It was a fragile straw to cling to, but Hank clung to it with all his might.\n Worm and man together, they then thought: No one knows the size of the universe or what wonders and terrors it contains. Yet we drive on, blindly burrowing forward through the darkness, learning what we can and suffering what we must.

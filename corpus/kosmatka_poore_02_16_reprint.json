Over time, it becomes a thing you can respect.\n Bell trudged up the path, pushing the wheelbarrow before him, already sweating under his brown khaki uniform. He squinted in the bright sunlight, eyeing the exhibits as he ascended the hill: the goats and their pandering; the silly, horny monkeys; the slothful binturongs\u2014all moving to the front of their enclosures as he approached.\n Most zoo animals eventually came to an understanding with those who brought the food. An uneasy truce.\n But Bell knew better than to trust it.\n He\u2019d seen the scars.\n Mary had scars on her arms. Garland was missing the tip of one finger, and John, the assistant super, had a large divot in the calf of his right leg.\n \u201cZebra\u201d was all he\u2019d say.\n Bell was the newest zookeep. No scars yet. But a wariness.\n Walking up the hill that morning, Bell noticed Seana up ahead of him on the asphalt path. As he walked, he noticed she wore two different-colored socks\u2014one red, the other white. He wondered if she were absent-minded, or just quirky. He hadn\u2019t been at the zoo long, didn\u2019t know her well.\n As he closed the distance, he saw that she was crying. And he realized why she wore one red sock. Her calf was gashed open, bleeding streams.\n He followed her into the staff room, and she explained that the juvenile baboon had attacked her.\n She was outraged. Betrayed.\n \u201cWhy did you go in there?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cI always go in there,\u201d she said. \u201cI was here when it was born. I raised it.\u201d\n \u201cAnimals are unpredictable.\u201d\n She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s never done that before.\u201d\n Never done that before.\n Bell thought about that on the way home. Surprises puzzled him.\n On one hand, it seemed there should never be any surprises. The world tended toward order, didn\u2019t it? It circled the sun at the same speed all the time. Water boiled predictably, froze predictably. People weighed the same in Dallas as they did in Quebec. The speed of sound, in dry air, was 767 miles an hour.\n So why, Bell wondered, can\u2019t he and his wife keep track of money, plan ahead, and stop living in a trailer? In an orderly world, this shouldn\u2019t be impossible. In an orderly world, you shouldn\u2019t have to choose between buying food and keeping your car insurance.\n Bell knew things were always more complicated than they looked. Water froze predictably, but strangely. It expanded. Crystals crashed and splintered. Sound moved faster underwater.\n \u201cAnd you can\u2019t keep from buying shit,\u201d he thought aloud, driving home.\n He popped over the curb into the Lil\u2019 Red Barn parking lot.\n They weren\u2019t going to spend anything this week, Bell and Lin had agreed. They didn\u2019t need to. Food in the fridge, gas in both cars. This week they wouldn\u2019t spend.\n That morning, they\u2019d run out of toilet paper.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not an insurmountable problem,\u201d he\u2019d told Lin. \u201cWe have paper towels.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d said Lin, \u201csupposed to put anything besides toilet paper in the toilet.\u201d\n \u201cBut you can,\u201d argued Bell, \u201cif you need to.\u201d\n Bell thought it was a spending problem. They knew how much money was coming in. If they controlled what went out, their money would be orderly, would increase. Lin disagreed.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of supply,\u201d she had pointed out. \u201cYour job needs to supply more money.\u201d\n \u201cSo does yours.\u201d Lin worked in the mall.\n She glared ice. Splinters and crystals.\n In Lin\u2019s world, it was okay for her to criticize Bell. It was not okay for Bell to criticize Lin. Not if things were to be orderly. In every mating pair, Bell knew, one animal always bit harder than the other.\n Lin was the biter.\n And in their two-mammal world where daily life was defined by constant, grinding poverty, it seemed she bit constantly.\n It was important, they had once agreed, to do what they loved. To love their work.\n \u201cI love my work,\u201d Bell had told Lin a thousand times. Last month, in bed, he had told her how he loved his work, and they\u2019d argued, and she\u2019d scratched him with her fingernails. Drew blood. Made him want to hit her, and he almost did.\n But he didn\u2019t. There were light years between wanting to hit a woman and actually doing it. Bell wasn\u2019t that kind of man. Wasn\u2019t that kind of animal. What kind of animal was he?\n He wondered if she knew. Wondered if she\u2019d seen it in his eyes, the almost-hitting. The wanting to.\n He quit saying how much he loved his job.\n Most zookeepers, he knew, were women whose husbands made better money. They could afford the love.\n Lin knew this, too.\n \u201cShelly Capriatti\u2019s husband sells guitars,\u201d she had told him, just the night before. Shelly Capriatti was someone she worked with or worked out with, he couldn\u2019t recall. \u201cHigh end stuff, like for professionals. Like if Eric Clapton needed a new guitar. There\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t do something like that. He makes a ton of money.\u201d\n And he was on the edge, as he often was, of admitting to himself that he wished he hadn\u2019t gotten married, when she stretched herself across his lap in front of their eleven-year-old TV and was nice for a while. Long enough for him to sweep some hard truth under the rug. Again. It was easier that way.\n He focused on that\u2014the niceness\u2014while he paid the cashier at the Lil\u2019 Red Barn.\n She could be nice. Things in general, sometimes, were nice.\n Sometimes she was predictable, which was easier, but you had to be ready for both. Driving into the trailer park, he thought about that.\n The baboon had never attacked anyone. Then, today, it did.\n There\u2019s a first time for everything.\n \u201cYou\u2019re cute the way a dog is cute,\u201d Lin had told him, in front of the TV.\n You run out of toilet paper.\n Things fall apart.\n Not having money was a theme in Bell\u2019s life. Even the zoo was a poor zoo, poorly funded.\n Sometimes people complained. Once, a woman had come in, and when she\u2019d seen the conditions in which the lions were housed, she\u2019d been angry. People loved the lions.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a cage,\u201d she said.\n Bell had agreed with her.\n \u201cZoos are supposed to be . . . natural,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be habitats, and the animals aren\u2019t even supposed to realize they\u2019re confined.\u201d\n Bell understood. He sympathized. He\u2019d been to zoos like that, too, in towns that weren\u2019t dying.\n \u201cDo you think they don\u2019t know?\u201d he asked.\n She only stared at him.\n \u201cDo you think, in these other zoos, that the animals don\u2019t know they\u2019re locked in?\u201d\n \u201cA disgrace,\u201d she said, walking away.\n Low funding required management to get creative when provisioning the animals. In addition to supplies bought on the open market, there were arrangements with local grocery stores, and butchers, and meat processors. A truck was taken around each day to be filled with heaps of food\u2014loaves of bread that had passed their freshness dates, meat that had begun to turn, gallons of milk that had expired. Occasionally there was carrion brought in\u2014deer which had been struck on the highway and then picked up by the county. All of it fed into the bottomless maw of the zoo.\n The trucks would drive around back and unload their cargo into the kitchen.\n It was called the kitchen, but it was not a kitchen. It was a room with several huge stainless steel tables on which food was piled and sorted and divided.\n Bell was on his way to the castle when a voice on his walky-talky stopped him. \u201cBell, there\u2019s something you need to see.\u201d\n Lucy, one of the kitchen workers, out of breath.\n He got there fast. Came in through the back door.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a bug,\u201d said Lucy, hands at her collar.\n \u201cWhat kind?\u201d he asked.\n She shrugged. \u201cThe ugly kind.\u201d She pointed at a bowl turned upside-down on the counter.\n Bell lifted the bowl. Put it down again.\n He stood perfectly still.\n He lifted the bowl and stole another quick glance.\n \u201cHmm,\u201d he said and lowered the bowl.\n The kitchen workers stared. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d he said. He looked into the distance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a grub of some sort.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t think grubs got that big,\u201d Lucy said.\n \u201cNo,\u201d Bell said. \u201cNeither did I.\u201d\n Bell looked again. The grub was large, fleshy and blood red. Five inches long.\n \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d he asked.\n She shrugged again. \u201cThe table.\u201d\n Bell looked at the table. There were watermelons, and apples, and bread, and the partially disarticulated hock of a deer. Several bunches of blackened bananas made a mountain in the center, along with a smaller mound of more exotic fruit shipped in from Lord-knew-where.\n \u201cIt could have come in with anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI found it crawling along the edge of the table there.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cIt was moving pretty fast.\u201d\n Bell retrieved a glass jar from the cabinet, opened the lid, then dragged the bowl across the edge of the table so the strange grub dropped into the jar. He stepped outside and plucked some grass, put the grass inside, and closed the lid. Poked holes.\n He took the jar across the zoo to the castle and placed it on a shelf in the back room.\n \u201cThe castle\u201d was the name used for the entomology building. Bell could only imagine what the structure\u2019s original use had been, with its block construction and odd turrets; but whatever that long ago intent, it now housed all manner of creepy crawlers\u2014hissing cockroaches, and ant farms, and snakes, and lizards and frogs. Anything that required darkness or careful temperature control.\n The building was a box within a box. There was an open, central area ringed on three sides by walls and exhibits\u2014and just behind these walls was a space called the back room, closed to the public, which was actually a single narrow hall that conformed to the outside perimeter of the building, a gap space where you could access the back side of the cages. At the far end of this hall, in a dead-end spot furthest from the entry door was a table and chairs, a TV, a desk, and several terrariums. These extra terrariums were where the sick were boarded, those unfit for public examination.\n Bell did the rest of his chores for the day. In the evening he checked on the grub. It was still there, happily curling up the sides of the glass jar. Bell had studied entomology in college, and he\u2019d never seen anything like it; the insect\u2019s sheer bulk seemed to push the cubed-square law to its limit. Perhaps beyond its limit. He hadn\u2019t thought insects could be that big. When he opened the lid, the grub reared up at him, strange mouth-parts writhing.\n Bell was in charge of the castle, the petting zoo, and the convicts. This had not always been the case. He was in charge of the castle because he was the only zookeeper who\u2019d taken college-level entomology. The petting zoo was meant as an insult. And the convicts were punishment.\n The convicts came in most weekdays. You could point them out in the parking lot\u2014men and women who were there too early, hours before the gates opened. Bell would feed the insects, drink a cup of coffee, and then walk to open the front gates.\n \u201cHere for community service?\u201d he\u2019d ask.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d they\u2019d say.\n Sometimes there were two or three. Sometimes none. They handed Bell their paperwork, and Bell passed it to the zoo superintendent at the end of the day.\n The number of hours worked was the all-important statistic. Because they all had a number they were working down from. 150 hours, 200 hours, 100 hours.\n Sometimes they talked about their crimes, and sometimes they didn\u2019t.\n Bell never asked. Not his business.\n Bell often talked to himself in the bathroom mirror.\n \u201cIn this world,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are not an apex predator. Humans are, as a species, but you, yourself, are not.\u201d\n You do not always win. Problems are not always solved.\n There are defeats and surrenderings. Small but important.\n Last winter, they gave up heating the bedroom. They sealed off the back of the trailer and slept on the sofa. They learned the science of climbing into the bathtub. The bathtub was metal and descended a few inches through the floor, arctic air right beneath. No matter how hot the water got, your butt and legs would start to freeze if you sat still too long. You had to lift yourself up now and then, let the hot water get under there. Lower yourself. Wait. Repeat.\n \u201cIt\u2019s like not even being part of the food chain,\u201d Bell said aloud one cold night, eating burritos in the kitchen.\n They hadn\u2019t spoken to one another that morning. His remark about the food chain was one of two things they said to each other all day long.\n Sometimes he opened up the bedroom door and exhaled just to see his breath cloud the room.\n He wanted her to ask about his food chain remark. Wanted to explain it. Wanted her to understand.\n \u201cThe food chain\u2014\u201d he began.\n \u201cI get it,\u201d she said.\n That was the second thing that got said. Her breath made a cloud even though they were in the kitchen.\n Bell didn\u2019t dare tell Lin how much he loved his job, not anymore. He told the mirror, instead.\n \u201cI love my job,\u201d he said. His reflection said it, too, it seemed.\n Like the zoo, their life at home had been built on various pretendings. Pretending there might be gas money. Pretending they could afford to eat better, but chose not to. Pretending that Lin still thought it was important to have a job you liked. Loved. Whatever.\n She had quit pretending. Somewhere behind her mask was the Lin who thought \u201cIf you loved me you\u2019d do what it took for me to live a better life,\u201d and that Lin had surfaced. Unmasked. Through fucking around.\n Classified ads appeared, taped to the fridge.\n Sales. Landscaping. Power-washing trucks. All kinds of things you could do with a degree in biology.\n \u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d Bell told her, \u201cto lose track of what\u2019s really important.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t have to say that having heat and electricity were important, too. Instead, never breaking eye contact, she grabbed her coat and her vibrator and locked herself in the bathroom.\n Library clerk. Barista. All things that paid more than working at a zoo. Mexican cook. Skycap for a Mexican airline. Didn\u2019t matter if you weren\u2019t Mexican.\n It was amazing, thought Bell, how much pretending went on in a zoo.\n The public pretended the cages were jungles, savannah, desert, or snow.\n The animals pretended that they were not interested in the public. The public and the zookeepers worked together at pretending that the zoo was not, when you got right down to it, just carefully-engineered cruelty.\n Sometimes the animals forgot to pretend. Like when babies were born and wouldn\u2019t eat. Because they knew captivity when they saw it. Felt it. Forgot to pretend life was worth living.\n Like when the llama attacked Bria Vagades.\n Bell was there when it happened.\n It wasn\u2019t like an animal attack in the movies, all snarling and snorting, blood and fur. It looked almost comical. One second Bria was lifting the rock-shaped hatch which concealed the garden hose, and suddenly here came Nunez the llama, ridiculous and splendid with his two-tone black-and-gray coat, rearing on his hind legs, waving his front hooves like a boxer. He was on her before she saw him, and she screamed.\n \u201cOw!\u201d she screamed, and \u201cFuck you, Nunez!\u201d before she got a grip on herself. The zoo was closed, but there were strict rules about losing your cool where the public might see, might panic.\n Nunez lost his balance, came down on all fours, still advancing, sniffing the air. Reared up again, hooves waving as Bria covered her head, backing away, feeling behind her for the door.\n \u201cHe didn\u2019t want her in the enclosure,\u201d Bell told John Lorraine, another zookeeper, later on in the cafeteria. \u201cIt was obvious.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s never obvious. It\u2019s sloppy, is what it is, assigning human motives to animal behavior.\u201d\n \u201cTerritoriality is an animal behavior,\u201d Bell answered, chewing peanut butter crackers. \u201cIt\u2019s an animal motive.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s sloppy,\u201d John said, \u201cis pretending to understand why all the time. Why they do anything they do.\u201d\n \u201cBecause it\u2019s mating season,\u201d said Bell. \u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d\n John Lorraine\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd she went in the enclosure by herself? That\u2019s sloppy, too. These animals aren\u2019t pets.\u201d\n But Bell knew some of the animals were like pets. Bad pets. Pets you couldn\u2019t trust. \u201cYou should write a fucking memo,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYou should shut up.\u201d\n Bell agreed. He said \u201cYep.\u201d\n The grub wasn\u2019t like a pet. The day after Bell placed it in one of the large terrariums, it began to construct a papery cocoon.\n During his evening break, Bell sat in the back room and watched the grub work. He checked the zoo\u2019s entomology books but couldn\u2019t find a match. None of the pictures looked anything like the strange insect in the terrarium. The cocoon only deepened the mystery. Whatever this thing was, it was a juvenile.\n There were four main groups of insects that had a larval stage of development: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera.\n The thing in the terrarium was no caterpillar, so Bell could rule out Lepidoptera. The grub\u2019s size seemed to rule out Diptera. Which left Hymenoptera and Coleoptera. Wasps and beetles. But it didn\u2019t look like any wasp or beetle grub he\u2019d ever seen.\n Most grubs didn\u2019t have eyes. Most grubs didn\u2019t have mouthparts like that.\n At the end of its third day in the terrarium, Bell arrived to find it had sealed itself into its papery chrysalis, and just like that, the grub subtracted itself from the world.\n The next day, there was an addition to Bell\u2019s army of community service workers. A late arrival.\n Bell was on one knee, mixing food for the lemurs when a shadow fell over the bucket. Bell shaded his eyes and looked up.\n \u201cThey told me to find Bell. \u2018Report to Bell,\u2019 they said. Said Bell was young. You look like you might be him.\u201d\n The shadow had a voice like raw sand.\n Bell stood and shook hands.\n Shaking hands, the first thing he noticed was scar tissue. Burn scars splashed across hand and wrist. Both hands, Bell observed. Both wrists.\n Leather-skinned. Scrambled white hair. Eyes blue like a cutting torch. If a bomb could explode and come back as a person, it would be this guy. Just looking at him, sunburned and fire-burned, made Bell thirsty. They sat down over Cokes at the Savannah Caf\u00e9, where Bell learned that the bomb\u2019s name was Cole. Learned that, at sixty, Cole was by far the oldest community service con to grace the zoo.\n Then he put him to work hosing down empty cells in the elephant house, beginning with the Cape Buffalo.\n \u201cBullshit,\u201d rasped Cole, when he saw the cell.\n Bell must have looked startled.\n \u201cLiterally,\u201d Cole explained, waving the hose at the floor. He smiled, revealing teeth like rubble. Smiled and winked.\n It was like being winked at by war.\n Just as the lions were star attractions for the tourists, Cole became a star attraction for the staff.\n He was scary, like the lions. Like the lions, he seemed to keep most of his energy bottled up in some soft, invisible engine. It was an uneasy feeling, locking eyes with a lion. Same with Cole.\n You couldn\u2019t talk to a lion, though. Couldn\u2019t ask him how he came to be at the zoo. But you could ask Cole, if you were nosy enough.\n Bell didn\u2019t ask.\n Bell stood in the dark tunnel with Cole. \u201cThe baboons are smart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201d\n Cole nodded.\n \u201cThey can throw their poop at you. They can bite. You have to lock both sets of doors. There is a procedure you have to follow, and you should never be in the enclosure with them.\u201d\n Cole nodded again.\n \u201cIt\u2019s very important. Do you understand?\u201d\n Cole nodded again, but Bell wasn\u2019t so sure. Several years earlier there\u2019d been an incident in the cat house. The exhibit had been in the midst of repairs, and the lion had been allowed access to its run overnight. This normally wouldn\u2019t have been an issue except that the adjacent run had been under construction. The door separating the bobcat run from the lion run was made of thick plywood\u2014a temporary measure which was fine to keep the bobcats in. But insufficient, apparently, to keep the lion out.\n The next day, they found the plywood partition shredded, and the lion sleeping in the bobcat cage, blood coating its muzzle. All the bobcats were dead.\n Zoos are dangerous places.\n Dangerous for the animals. Dangerous for the zookeeps.\n Cole had a thousand hours of community service. Bell had never seen a number that high. It would take him a year to finish it.\n When Cole had been at the zoo for a week, the zoo superintendent pulled Bell aside. The superintendent didn\u2019t like Bell much. She wore a serious expression. \u201cThe older guy, Cole, is he a good worker?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s going to be here for a while.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d Bell said, \u201cI know.\u201d He could see the gears moving behind the superintendent\u2019s eyes. A free long-term worker. A worker that didn\u2019t need paid.\n \u201cPerhaps we could give him more responsibilities,\u201d she said.\n For weeks, Bell checked on the cocoon, waiting to see what would emerge.\n It happened on a Monday. There was a buzz in the room when Bell entered. A buzz like one second before an electric light went bad; only this light kept going bad, second after second\u2014an electrical hum that did not fade. Bell looked in the terrarium and saw it.\n Huge.\n Winged.\n Bright red, but the mouthparts were black.\n \u201cHymenoptera,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOf some kind.\u201d\n The summer stretched on. Bell trained Cole how to be a zookeeper. On their breaks they sat in the back room.\n When the insect first hatched, the question became what to feed it. Bell tried a little of everything: sliced bananas, and apples and small chunks of meat. Some of the fruit on the table came from exotic locales, and it was easy to imagine the grub stowed within the corpus of some melon from Central America\u2014and it was easy to imagine how such a melon might go quickly bad, and soft, and end up on the zoo\u2019s table as discarded produce.\n Weeks passed, and the insect thrived.\n Even Cole took an interest. \u201cPet wasp?\u201d he said as he helped Bell clean out the nearby lizard cage.\n \u201cI\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s a wasp.\u201d\n Several days later Bell found Cole looking through the glass. Cole was the one who noticed it first.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.\n Bell looked. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d The wasp-thing sat perched on a small branch in the terrarium, oddly-jointed legs flexed, wings slung like swords over its narrow back. Hanging beneath the insect, dangling from a fibrous string, was a small pod of what looked like dried brown foam.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Cole said.\n \u201cI think it\u2019s an egg case.\u201d\n Cole surveyed the terrarium again.\n \u201cSo there\u2019s two of them things?\u201d\n Bell shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s just the one.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe she was already fertilized.\u201d\n This particular convict was smarter than he pretended to be. Bell caught his reflection in the glass, blowtorch eyes darting back and forth.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not likely,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is female, but the reproductive stage usually begins after metamorphosis, not before. And this thing has been alone since it hatched.\u201d\n \u201cSanta Maria of the bugs,\u201d said Cole, cracking a shipwreck smile.\n Bell laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s less than a miracle in the insect world,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s called Parthanogenesis. Some kinds of Hymenoptera can\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHymen-who?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s an insect clade. Ants, bees, and wasps. Certain species can reproduce without males. Worms can do it, too, and some lizards. But Hymenoptera are the champs.\u201d\n Cole straightened.\n \u201cLet\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t catch on.\u201d\n Bell thought it over. Reproduction and marriage and wives and such.\n \u201cMight not be so bad,\u201d he muttered.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n \u201cNothing.\u201d\n Bell contacted the university. He wrote a letter to the biology department describing the insect and the circumstances of its arrival. A week later he received a reply. The note was short and polite: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a mud dauber.\u201d\n Bell wadded the letter and threw it in the trash. \u201cI know what a mud dauber looks like.\u201d\n One evening a few weeks later, he found the insect dead. Even in death it looked formidable, with a head the size of a dime, and a body like a smooth, slick walnut.\n For the first time, he dared to touch it. With its legs spread out, it was nearly the size of his hand. He jabbed a pin through its abdomen and stuck it to a small cork. The legs sagged under their own weight. He looked inside the terrarium at the egg case, wondering if anything would hatch from it.\n Months passed, the egg case forgotten. Bell and Seana took turns training the old man. Seana didn\u2019t like Cole, and didn\u2019t pretend she did.\n In the spring, the eggs hatched. There were a million tiny grubs, just like the original, only smaller. Bell watched them wriggling through the sawdust he\u2019d put in the terrarium.\n \u201cThese more of your wasps?\u201d Cole asked.\n \u201cThey will be.\u201d\n They watched them writhing for several minutes.\n \u201cWhat do they eat?\u201d Cole asked.\n Bell thought about this for a moment. The adult form of an insect often ate a completely different diet than the juvenile.\n \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said.\n Feedings could be tricky.\n When Bell was first hired by the zoo, he\u2019d been put in charge of feeding the raptors. Raptors weren\u2019t dinosaurs though, like you\u2019d think, with a name like that. It turned out, they were big damn birds. One of them was a golden eagle.\n All went well for the first few days. The golden eagle ate about five rats a week, but it was fed every day. Which would have been fine except that the uneaten rats had to be removed from the enclosure.\n This idea didn\u2019t bother Bell until the moment he first went to do it. He stood at the cage door and looked at the big damn eagle, and it occurred to him that he was about to go inside a big damn eagle\u2019s enclosure and take out its food. It occurred to him what might happen if the big damn eagle felt suddenly partial to that food.\n He stared at the eagle. He stared at its talons\u2014two-inch daggers strong enough to pierce bone.\n Bell walked down to the zoo superintendent\u2019s office.\n She was unmoved by his concerns.\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable with it,\u201d Bell said.\n She waved that off. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to worry about.\u201d Then she went back to her paperwork.\n \u201cBut how do you know the eagle won\u2019t attack?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, not bothering to look up. \u201cNothing like that has ever happened before.\u201d\n A preamble to every scar story he\u2019d heard at the zoo.\n \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it,\u201d he said.\n She looked up from her papers. She sighed. She weighed her options. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said.\n The next week he was put in charge of the petting zoo. This was meant as an insult.\n When he complained, pointing out that his particular skill set could surely be put to better utility, she only nodded sympathetically.\n Then she put him in charge of the convicts, too.\n Bell divided the newly hatched grubs into three groups, in three terrariums. In one terrarium, he dropped only fruit. In another, he dropped chunks of bread. In the third terrarium he dropped meat.\n Insects tended to specialize in their diets, so he thought there was a good chance that two of the terrariums would starve. But then at least he\u2019d know what they ate.\n The grubs, however, surprised him. All three aquariums thrived\u2014though the grubs given meat grew fastest.\n Two months later, the grubs all began to spin cocoons. As if by agreement, they all started their nests on the same day.\n That night, as if to celebrate the milestone, Bell committed a budget crime. He stopped at McDonalds for a bite on his way home, knowing that tuna salad was all they had in the fridge.\n He was trapped and doomed, once he\u2019d spent the money.\n \u201cSpend whatever you need to,\u201d Lin said. \u201cJust make sure you tell me about it.\u201d\n Lin was the official banker of their marriage.\n \u201cJust tell me about it\u201d was the trap, because if he spent money and told her, she got mad. She might get loud, she might stay quiet. Either way, when Lin got mad, she fed on her own energy like a hurricane, getting louder and madder. The hurricane usually blew until she charged out the door and drove away, still screaming. Hours later, she\u2019d return. Maybe still mad, maybe not.\n One of these days when she came back, Bell would be gone.\n This thought came from an increasingly vocal part of his brain. The part where he\u2019d swept so much crap under the carpet.\n A week after his crime, she dropped a bank statement in his lap while he sat reading.\n They were both reading a lot, these days. The cable company had run out of patience.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cIt\u2019s highlighted.\u201d\n Shit. He\u2019d forgotten.\n MCD Store #1635.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a receipt for that.\u201d\n \u201cThought I had. Sorry.\u201d\n He was sorry. What else could he do? Here, he thought, was where a rational person would let it go. But not Lin.\n She yelled, storm winds building. How, she wanted to know, was she supposed to know how much to spend on the rent and the car and the power company and the phone company and the fucking grocery store when she didn\u2019t know how much he\u2019d spent on whatever big important things he needed to spend money on. Like a Big Mac, apparently. She didn\u2019t remember him asking if she\u2019d like a Big Mac, too, because he was too busy being a selfish, irresponsible asshole and then hiding the receipt.\n He could tune out the yelling, until she made accusations like that.\n \u201cI forgot,\u201d he reminded her. Now he was pissed. This was going to be bad.\n The louder she got, the louder he got. Eventually, she was shrieking at him. A responsible voice inside him grew worried. She was really, really wound up this time. The tiny voice said that he couldn\u2019t let her drive off like this. She\u2019d hurt herself. Hurt someone.\n It was a zookeeper voice. The voice that knew you couldn\u2019t let the animals run wild, no matter what.\n She took a bathroom break, still yelling, and Bell took advantage of the opportunity to hide her car keys. Deep inside a box of stale Triscuits.\n Sure enough, when she emerged, she hunted for her keys.\n Lin was notoriously bad about where she laid her keys. They could be anywhere.\n She hunted.\n For ten, fifteen minutes, she looked everywhere. Everywhere she might rationally have put her keys. She stopped yelling about Bell and started quieting down.\n The quiet, Bell knew, was deceptive. It did not signal calm. Just quiet. Like a fire that gets into the walls, hidden, until someone opens a door.\n Bell realized he had made a mistake. She would keep looking forever, that was the problem. Sooner or later, he was going to have to tell her he\u2019d hidden her keys. And she\u2019d get worse. Get louder. The storm of the century.\n In some ways, he felt sorry for her. She was kind of crazy, really. More than kind of. Poor girl. But what a bitch. He almost said it aloud.\n In the end, she retreated to the bathroom again, and Bell put the keys in the silverware drawer. Silently, like a cat burglar.\n She came back out, and the silverware drawer was the third place she looked. She had already looked there. Several times. And she knew it. Bell knew she knew it.\n \u201cYou fucker,\u201d she whispered, almost choking. Near tears.\n Remorse! He was no match for tears. He melted, moved toward her. He\u2019d been protecting her.\n She whipped the keys at him, catching his left ear as he ducked.\n It was loud again for a while. Bell picked up the keys and opened the trailer door.\n Lin had grabbed her purse.\n \u201cGive them here!\u201d she screamed.\n Bell ignored her.\n He drove off, this time.\n He used up ten dollars of gasoline just driving in circles. He enjoyed the waste. Enjoyed the drive. Talked to himself.\n When he circled back, at last, he found her shivering on the steps.\n She\u2019d been locked out.\n It was a cold fall evening.\n Remorse, again.\n This was not fucking working.\n Mating is complicated\n Mammals click.\n Personalities come together, and they click, sometimes. Other times they don\u2019t.\n The day after he and Lin un-clicked so badly\u2014the day after he locked her out of the trailer\u2014Bell and Cole sort of clicked.\n Bell couldn\u2019t have said what did it, exactly. He was on the roof of the walrus tank, watching the pinnipeds heave their awkward bulk across wet concrete.\n Cole climbed the ladder and joined him. In the enclosure below, two males bellowed at each other, bumped chests.\n The smaller male backed off, retreating to the tank, but the larger walrus followed. It slipped its hulking form into the water and was suddenly graceful. Like a different animal entirely.\n They stared together in silence until Cole said, simply \u201cWell, Goddamn,\u201d and they both cracked smiles.\n \u201cReminds me of my dad growing up,\u201d Cole said. \u201cBig and mean. Harder to get away from than you\u2019d think.\u201d\n Bell cocked an eyebrow.\n \u201cOh, a real tough-guy,\u201d Cole continued. \u201cBeat my ass until I got bigger than him.\u201d Cole smiled war again.\n Bell was unsurprised when Cole showed him a silver flask and asked if he\u2019d like a sip.\n And Bell had a sip. Just one.\n But it was enough to set the stage for a detour, after closing, to a nearby grill with a liquor license. Bell didn\u2019t feel like going home to Lin; and Cole didn\u2019t feel like going back to the halfway house. He wasn\u2019t due for an hour, yet.\n At the bar, Bell lit a cigarette and found himself talking about Lin. He told Cole all about the money problem, and the fight.\n Cole\u2019s cutting-torch eyes burned as he listened. He looked terrifyingly wise, all of a sudden.\n After two beers, Bell found himself saying out loud the thing he could barely admit to himself, \u201cI wish I\u2019d stayed single, man. I really, really, do.\u201d\n Just then, a woman wearing fifty pounds of makeup came in, clunked across the floor in square heels. Cole winked at her.\n She said something to the bartender and walked back out.\n Bell watched her go. The setting sun blazed straight in through the door as it wheezed shut. Bell winced and\u2014too late\u2014shaded his eyes. Momentarily blind, blinking, Bell groped for his beer.\n Into this momentary darkness, Cole said \u201cI crashed a helicopter, in case you wondered.\u201d\n Bell blinked. Cole\u2019s eyes became visible, twin coals.\n \u201cHuh?\u201d\n \u201cI noticed you didn\u2019t ask about my hands. Or why I was in jail. You never ask nobody. It\u2019s actually pretty conspicuous, the way you don\u2019t ever ask how anyone came to community service. You just give \u2018em some shit to do and mark down their hours.\u201d\n Bell must have looked troubled. Purple circles rotated in the dark, in his brain.\n \u201cNo, it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s cool you do people like that. Makes \u2018em feel normal. But not asking the way you do, it\u2019s kinda obvious how bad you want to know, so I\u2019m telling you. I wrecked a helicopter.\u201d\n Cole was right. Bell wanted to know. Wanted to know quite badly. Hadn\u2019t realized until this moment.\n \u201cAlright,\u201d he said, by way of encouragement.\n It took fifteen minutes for Cole to tell about Brazil.\n He was a helicopter pilot, to begin with.\n First in the army, then for the president of a frozen chicken company, then for United Airlines, on contract with Canadian Railways, shuttling engineers from checkpoint to checkpoint. It was the kind of solitary work he enjoyed. The engineers were usually stone tired. Quiet.\n Then he\u2019d crashed his United Airlines helicopter.\n The kind of thing that could happen to anyone; his tail rotor crapped out and he had to autorotate down from eight hundred feet, spinning and yawing with three cursing, pants-pissing passengers. Rolling sideways at the last second, landing sideways, splintering the rotor, rupturing the fuel tank.\n No deaths. The only serious injury was Cole, who remained behind until all three passengers were out and running, safe. Sustained burns over twenty-five percent of his body, including the splashy scar tissue on his left hand and wrist.\n Bell began to ask a question, but Cole anticipated him.\n \u201cThe other hand was something else,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething later.\u201d\n United Airlines hadn\u2019t been cool about his benefits, and the hospital bankrupted him. Could barely afford the surgery that let him use his hands, let alone reconstruction or cosmetics.\n Which was why he started siphoning aircraft fuel. You could make a lot of money on the black market, selling aircraft fuel at half-price.\n A dangerous business, though. No honor among thieves and so on; someone turned him in, and a federal warrant came looking for him.\n The Feds called him while he was in the air. In Virginia, near the coast. On his way to Richmond for a pickup.\n \u201cPut down at Richmond International,\u201d the FBI told him.\n And Cole had flown out to sea, instead. How stupid did those bastards think a guy was?\n Stupid enough, he supposed, to get caught fencing felony amounts of helicopter fuel.\n Cole flew out to sea. Flew into the sea. If the feds wanted him, they were going to have to work for it.\n Bell must have looked at Cole\u2019s right hand.\n \u201cThe fuel tank ruptured when I hit the waves,\u201d said Cole, draining his beer. \u201cSet the water on fire. I could either surface and tread water in the burning fuel, or stay under and grow gills. Happened when I was twenty-seven. They gave me nine years.\u201d\n Bell did the age math, but before he could ask, Cole said, \u201cOh, I was in and out after that. Assault, mostly. The last one for a bar fight. Guy got his eye socket broken, and the judge gave me extra\u2014those women judges, they\u2019re the worst. She said my anger gonna burn me up some day.\u201d Cole smiled war again. \u201cBut that already happened, ain\u2019t it? Besides, not all that burns is consumed.\u201d\n He took a last swallow of his drink. \u201cI gotta scoot. If they lock my ass out, I\u2019m fucked.\u201d\n Very quickly, Cole was up and out the door. Bell turned and watched him go, and the sun hadn\u2019t quite set yet, and Bell\u2019s eyes got nailed a second time.\n Blind as a bat, Bell thought.\n Good zookeeper that he was, Bell knew bats weren\u2019t really blind, and he said so.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d called the bartender. Also, Bell thought, a zookeeper of sorts.\n \u201cBats aren\u2019t really blind,\u201d Bell repeated.\n Never get drunk with the convicts, Bell lectured himself.\n It was a bad idea in so many ways. It was unprofessional. Besides, if you got to be drinking buddies with one of them, even going so far as to sip whiskey with him on top of the walrus tank\u2014a firing violation by zoo rules\u2014then what do you do afterward if the convict does something you should report him for? Something else.\n A week after the bar, Bell arrived at work and found Garland, the maintenance chief, waiting at the gate.\n \u201cThere\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Garland.\n \u201cAn issue?\u201d\n \u201cWith your friend. He\u2019s drunk.\u201d\n \u201cWhere?\u201d\n \u201cI have him shoveling the camel enclosure. Figured that would keep him out the way until he sobered up a bit.\u201d Garland paused. \u201cOnly I think he\u2019s a lot worse off than I thought.\u201d\n A headache came rumbling up on heavy treads. Bell sighed.\n Garland looked uneasy, too. It was bad news, Cole being drunk. Especially if Garland had noticed it and let him work anyway. It was like Watergate. A lot of people could wind up in trouble before this was over.\n \u201cI thought I\u2019d wait and see what you wanted to do,\u201d said Garland as they walked uphill through the zoo. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make out a report if it was just . . . well.\u201d\n Bell understood. The old man was scary.\n Bell nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it.\u201d\n At the camel enclosure, Bell called out Cole\u2019s name and the old man approached, shovel in hand. He smelled like rum.\n \u201cYeah?\u201d The question had an edge to it. Like Cole knew he was in trouble. For a moment, looking through the bars, Bell saw something aggressive in his eyes. Something leonine.\n Bell explained how it would go.\n Cole would drop the shovel.\n He would avoid speaking to anyone.\n He would leave by the back entrance. Now.\n \u201cSo I\u2019m fucked,\u201d Cole said.\n Bell shook his head. \u201cYou called in sick today is all. This never happened.\u201d\n He should be firing this guy, Bell knew. Why didn\u2019t he?\n He could see it now. He\u2019d tell Cole to get the hell out and not come back, and Cole would go to Koverman and say \u201cDid you know I drank whiskey with Bell during work hours on top of the walrus tank?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fucked,\u201d Cole repeated. He swayed.\n Bell frowned. There was something that started out to be a long silence. Then Cole whispered, \u201cI\u2019m not going back to jail. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n Bell led him out. \u201cCome back tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cSober.\u201d\n It took exactly four weeks for the cocoons to hatch. There was a sound like electric lights going bad, and Bell stepped in the back room. He stared for a long time. The terrariums teamed with strange new life. Each glass box seemed to house a different creature entirely. Strange wasp-things, and things . . . not like wasps. Things without names. Some larger, some smaller. Some with wings, some without. All were red and black.\n \u201cImpossible,\u201d he muttered. They couldn\u2019t all be the same species.\n His first instinct was to call the university. Then he remembered their note about mud daubers. Screw the university.\n Besides, instincts were for animals. He\u2019d solve this on his own.\n He could figure it out, Bell was certain. He knew a lot about insects.\n He knew insects had been among the first living things to walk dry land; they\u2019d seen the rise and fall of dinosaurs, the birth of flowering plants. Humans weren\u2019t the first species to farm, or to domesticate animals, or to war. Those milestones belonged to insects. When humanity first began its clumsy, ongoing experiment in agriculture, the Attine ants of South America had already long since perfected it\u2014cultivating vast fungus beds in underground chambers in their nests, seeding carefully tended gardens with the clones of a fungus that linked back more than thirty million years.\n Another species of ant, Lasius flaws, managed large flocks of domesticated aphids. The aphids were kept in subterranean corrals where they grew mature and succulent, grazing the roots of plants. And were then milked for their nutrient-rich honeydew.\n Some termite mounds sprawled more than thirty feet in diameter, housing tens of millions of individuals, all bound up in a single sophisticated caste system. Soldiers of Macrotermes bellicosus developed jaws so huge that they could no longer be used in feeding; instead they relied on teams of lower-caste workers to lift sustenance to their mouths.\n Insects build cities, and farms and superhighways. Slant your eyes and look hard enough, and you\u2019ll see a level of social sophistication that can only be described as civilization.\n Bell had often thought that humans had achieved their conspicuous position in the world not because of how perfectly adapted they were, but because of how weak, how clumsy, how fragile they were. How unsuited to existence.\n One species of dairying ant secreted an enzyme from their heads that was carefully rubbed onto each aphid during the milking process. The enzyme disrupted wing development, preventing their aphids from ever flying away.\n Where humans came up with external solutions\u2014like building fences\u2014insects often found a more elegant solution. A biological solution.\n They\u2019d had the time to do it.\n Determined and cautious, Bell fed the grubs every day and wrote down his observations.\n But still, Cole was the one who noticed it.\n When Bell finally understood, his mouth dropped open. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he said.\n He looked at his notes.\n He\u2019d fed the insects one of three different diets. The insects which, as grubs, had eaten bread did not now have wings, but stunted twists of chitin. Their color was dull red, like rust. More beetle-like, less wasp. Now, as adults, they still preferred bread. The fruit-eaters still ate fruit. They were large-bodied and short limbed, with stumpy wings that buzzed loudly as they made awkward flights inside the terrarium. Bell could imagine them making those same flights between distant stands of fruit.\n The meat eater was the most strange. Blood red, with wings like blades\u2014mouth parts huge and angular.\n \u201cThey adapted,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThey adapted to the food sources they ate as grubs.\u201d Bell shook his head in disbelief.\n \u201cFast learners,\u201d Cole said. Then he moved as if to stick an experimental finger in the meat-eater cage, but Bell said \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n Seana, when he showed her the hatchlings, said \u201cCan that happen?\u201d\n \u201cThere it is,\u201d he said. But in his heart of hearts, he knew she was right to doubt. Like a million years of evolution in a single generation. No species adapts that quickly. It was a bad movie. Junk science. Not possible.\n \u201cBut there it is,\u201d he repeated.\n The insects lived for more than a month. They buzzed, or crawled, or flitted around their cages. Over the course of a single week the following month, they took turns dying.\n The meat eater lived longest. After each die-off, Bell found egg-cases. He cleaned the terrariums, and put the egg cases back inside. Then he waited to see what would hatch.\n Late one evening, Seana climbed up the ladder while he was in the barn loft at the petting zoo, checking the hay for rot. Climbed up and stood behind him until he turned around, then stood on her toes and kissed him.\n If the zoo hadn\u2019t been closed and nearly deserted, if Bell hadn\u2019t known for sure that no one was likely to venture into the petting zoo, let alone climb into the loft, then maybe it would have happened differently. Maybe Bell would have kissed her back, because kissing would have been all that could happen.\n But the zoo was closed. Bell did know. And it did happen the way it happened.\n \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n She pulled away.\n \u201cI want to,\u201d he said.\n She looked at him, waiting.\n Beneath them, the horses shuffled. Made noises. Kicked their stall doors and talked to each other in soft equine language.\n He thought of Lin, home in their trailer. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said again.\n A black mood seized Bell on the way home. He drove the darkening highway, following his headlights into space. He pushed the old beater faster, watching the speedometer climb to seventy, then eighty. He took the curves without easing off the accelerator. The tires squealed, but held the road.\n His mind was a movie of loves and hates. He loved and hated his job. Loved the animals, but hated the conditions. Hated that he couldn\u2019t afford to live on what he was paid. When you\u2019re young, he thought, they tell you that if you get a degree, everything else will fall into place. But it\u2019s not that simple, is it?\n Nothing\u2014not one thing\u2014had worked out like it was supposed to.\n He thought of life at home, a second maze of contradiction. He was tired of being alone and together at the same time. He wanted to be free, but there was no freedom. No way out. He felt like an animal with a trapped limb. He understood why animals chew their own legs off. He had a recurring fantasy of being robbed, and putting up a struggle. If he were held up at gunpoint, he had decided, he would not cooperate.\n He didn\u2019t know what to think of Seana, yet. So he didn\u2019t, at all.\n Red like rupture. Blood squirm, a coagulation of grubs across brown terrarium stones. The egg cases pulsed like clotted hearts, spilling strange new life. Bell stared through the glass. Each cage told the same story.\n The grubs were a centimeter long. Even as small as they were, Bell could see the mouth parts working. Each grub identical. As far as he could see, the differences which had been so apparent from cage to cage in the adult form were now absent from the next generation. The grubs were all the same, as if a reset button had been pushed. It was only the adult form that seemed vulnerable to change. Bell opened his sack lunch. He took out his apple and sliced it into a dozen pieces. He dropped a slice into the first cage. The grubs responded immediately, moving toward the fruit. They swarmed it.\n Bell fed the grubs first thing in the morning.\n He decided to turn it into an experiment. He stole a sheet of sticky-labels from the staff room and stuck a label to the side of six different terrariums. On each label, he wrote a different word.\n The grubs labeled fruit were fed fruit; the grubs labeled meat were fed sliced-meat. The grubs labeled control were fed a mixture of foods.\n The grubs with the cool sticker on the side of their terrarium were fed the control diet\u2014but were also placed in a refrigerator for an hour a day while Bell did his chores. An hour wasn\u2019t long enough to kill them, but it was long enough to impact their physiology. They grew slower than the grubs in the other cages.\n If these insects could really adapt to their environments, Bell was going to see how far he could push it.\n He\u2019d see if diet was the only pressure they responded to.\n The grubs labeled heat were in a small glass aquarium placed on the floor near a space heater. Bell put his hands against the glass. It was hot to the touch. These grubs, too, seemed stressed by the temperature. But they still grew, doubling in size every week.\n The grubs labeled carrion were fed the occasional discarded rat from the golden eagle enclosure. These were the grubs Bell found most interesting. They borrowed into the dead rat and ate it from the inside out.\n Charles Darwin had believed in God until he studied the parasitic wasp Ibalia.\n Darwin wrote in a journal: \u201cThere seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars.\u201d Darwin found particularly gruesome that the Ibalia grub only gradually consumed the living tissues of its host\u2014taking a full three years to complete its meal, saving the vital organs until last as if to extend the host\u2019s suffering. Darwin couldn\u2019t imagine a God who would create something like that.\n Bell could imagine it.\n He thought of the reset mechanism. He imagined a single insect species with multiple phenotypes already encoded in its genome\u2014a catalog of different possible adult forms. And all it took was a trigger to set the creature down its path.\n \u201cMaybe it\u2019s like blind cave fish,\u201d he told Seana one evening.\n He watched Seana\u2019s face as she peered through the glass.\n \u201cCave fish have most of the genes for eyes still carried in their DNA,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the genes required for lenses, and retinas and eyelids, all the genes except for the one crucial ingredient that starts eye development in the first place. If you cross-breed two different populations of blind fish, sometimes you get fish with eyes.\u201d\n \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Seana said.\n \u201cIt does if the blindness is recessive, and the two populations are blind for different reasons.\u201d\n \u201cBut you said these things aren\u2019t breeding.\u201d\n Bell ignored her, lost in thought. \u201cOr they\u2019re like stem cells,\u201d he continued, \u201ceach carrying the genes for multiple tissue types, multiple potentials, but they specialize as they mature, choosing a path.\u201d\n He leaned forward, tapping his finger on the glass.\n \u201cWhere do you think they come from?\u201d Seana asked.\n \u201cThe fruit maybe. The bananas. Central America. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n \u201cWhy can\u2019t you find it in books?\u201d\n \u201cThere are millions of insect species still un-described by science. Besides, maybe it has been described. Some version of it. I mean, how would you really know?\u201d\n Later, searching for reasons to avoid going home, Bell ran down his closing checklist twice.\n On his second round, he found the outer door to the lemur tunnel wide open.\n He had locked it himself. Checked it himself.\n His inner alarm went off.\n Zookeepers developed inner alarms, or they developed scars.\n He stepped through the door, and let his eyes adjust to the dark, to the long, mildewy tunnel which ran under the moat, to the lemur island.\n At the end of the tunnel, bright light, because the door at the island end was open, too.\n In the middle, a silhouette. Who . . . ?\n \u201cHey!\u201d Bell shouted.\n Several silhouettes. Sharp, jabbering shadows. Five or six lemurs hopped and shrieked.\n The shadow in the middle wound up like a pitcher and threw something.\n A yelp. The lemurs howled and ran.\n \u201cCole?\u201d called Bell, starting down the tunnel.\n One lemur didn\u2019t run. It whirled in confusion, chattering.\n Bell\u2019s eyes had adjusted. The shadow grew details. Cole.\n Cole, with a handful of smooth, white landscaping stones, eyes wide with rage.\n \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Bell shouted.\n \u201cThey threw shit at me. They threw their fucking shit.\u201d\n \u201cJesus Christ\u2014!\u201d Bell yelled, lurching forward.\n Cole turned, arm pistoning in the dark.\n The stone whistled past Bell\u2019s ear and struck hard against the outer door. The tunnel echoed.\n Bell froze.\n Cole stepped toward him. \u201cYou watch how you talk to me,\u201d he said, and for a moment they stared at each other, waiting to see what would happen. Then Cole\u2019s eyes changed\u2014the rage blown out of them like a gust of wind. Cole brushed past him and was gone.\n The lemur groped its way back into the light, back to the island.\n Bell unfroze, closed up, and said nothing. He\u2019d have to say something, wouldn\u2019t he? Something would have to be done. Right?\n He made a mental note. In the future, he wouldn\u2019t let crazy people into his life. He meant it.\n Metamorphosis is magic. Darwin had known this, too.\n Sometimes it is a dark magic.\n The metamorphosis of a tadpole into a frog. A grub into a wasp. A friend into an enemy.\n Bell watched the grubs feed. By now they\u2019d grown huge. Some approached five inches in length, blood red, large beyond all reason. Soon they would spin their papery cocoons. Turn into whatever they would turn into.\n Bell pondered the advantage of such an adaptive mechanism. Perhaps it was a way to guard against overspecialization, a reservoir of adaptive capacity. Evolution is a slow process, and when new challenges arise, populations take time to react. There is a lag in the modifying response; species that don\u2019t change fast enough die out.\n Bell knew of several kinds of island lizard that reproduced parthenogenetically. Such species, when found, were always marginal, isolated, at risk of extinction; they were aberrations outside the main thrust of evolution. Most were doomed over the long run, because sexual reproduction is a much better way to create the next generation. In sexual reproduction, genes mix and match, new phenotypes arise, gene frequencies shift like tides. Sexual reproduction drops new cards in the deck from one generation to the next.\n Parthenogenetic species, on the other hand, are locked-in, frozen in time, playing the same card over and over.\n But not the insects in the back room.\n The insects in the back room seemed to have a whole deck from which to deal, parthenogenetic or not. Such insects could adapt quickly, shifting morphotypes in a single generation. And then shift back the next. It was the next logical step\u2014not just evolution, but the evolution of evolution. But how was it possible?\n Bell thought of Cole, of what made men like him. That old argument, nature vs. nurture. In another time, in another place, Cole would have fit in. In another time, maybe Cole would have been a different person entirely.\n The descendants of Vikings and Mongols today wore suits and ran multinational corporations. Were veterinarians, or plumbers, or holy men. Perhaps tomorrow, or a thousand years from now, they\u2019ll need to be Vikings and Mongols again.\n Populations change. Needs change. Optimums change. And it all changes faster than selection can track.\n From a biological perspective, it would be easy to produce the same kind of people again and again. Stable people. Good people. Again and again, generation after generation\u2014a one to one correlation between gene-set and expression.\n But that\u2019s not what you find when you look at humans.\n Instead there is a plasticity in human nature. A carefully calibrated susceptibility to trauma.\n What looks like a weak point in our species is in fact design.\n Because the truth is that certain childhoods are supposed to fuck you up.\n It is an adaptive response. Wired into us.\n The ones who couldn\u2019t adapt died out. Those gene sets which always produced the same kind of people\u2014stable people, good people\u2014no matter the environment, no matter the violence, or the aggression they faced\u2014those gene sets which always played the same card, again and again\u2014\n \u2014died out.\n Leaving behind the ones who could metamorphose.\n We were not so different from these bugs.\n Bell unloaded all this on Seana one day during lunch. They sat across from each other, sipping soft drinks. \u201cThe evolution of evolution?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWhy would this happen in insects?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cBecause they\u2019ve been here longest,\u201d he said. But it was more than that. He thought of the ants and their aphids. The enzyme that clipped their wings. He thought of the different ways that insects solved their problems. \u201cBecause insects always choose the biological solution.\u201d\n Bell avoided Cole for days.\n He told himself he was waiting for a good time to see the director, to tell her what had happened in the lemur tunnel. Told himself he wasn\u2019t afraid that Cole would retaliate by telling about drinking together on zoo time, zoo property. Both were lies, but what he had the toughest time with was pure simple fear of Cole.\n \u201cRidiculous,\u201d he told himself. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown man and a professional.\u201d\n On the other hand, Cole obviously was dangerous.\n Maybe he could get Cole to leave, to resign his service contract without anyone having to tell the director anything.\n This seemed, on reflection, to be the best bet for an outcome where he, Bell, kept his job and got rid of the problem.\n The reflection took place at home, on the sofa, in front of the TV, in his underwear.\n When Lin crossed the room, he saw himself through her eyes. He looked like a bum.\n She was thinking, he knew, what an asshole he was for buying beer.\n He didn\u2019t care.\n Neither did she, it seemed.\n She sat down on the couch beside him.\n What was he? When had he turned into a person who said nothing, did nothing? What had he let himself turn into?\n The next day, Bell followed Cole down to the supply shed and said \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a talk.\u201d\n Cole took a set of eight-foot pruning shears down from the wall rack, and turned to face Bell.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he said.\n Bell fumbled for a beginning, forgetting what he\u2019d rehearsed.\n Cole leaned on the pruning shears as if they were a wizard\u2019s staff.\n \u201cI have to turn you in,\u201d Bell said.\n \u201cFor what?\u201d\n \u201cThrowing rocks at the animals.\u201d\n Cole stared at him. His grip on the shears tightened. \u201cI lose my temper sometimes. I have a temper, I admit.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t be here.\u201d\n \u201cListen, I\u2019ll work on it. I\u2019ll be better.\u201d\n Cole shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just letting you know as a courtesy. I have to report it.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\n \u201cThe other choice is that you leave today and don\u2019t come back.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not any choice at all.\u201d\n \u201cThere are other places you can do your service.\u201d\n \u201cI like it here.\u201d\n \u201cHere doesn\u2019t like you anymore.\u201d\n \u201cYou know what I don\u2019t like? I don\u2019t think I like you trying to push me around.\u201d\n \u201cToday is your last day here, one way or the other,\u201d Bell said. \u201cYou can leave on your own, or you can be ushered out.\u201d\n \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t,\u201d Bell said.\n Cole\u2019s face changed. \u201cI\u2019m warning you.\u201d\n Bell raised his walky-talky, never taking his eyes off Cole. \u201cGarland,\u201d he spoke into the handset. There was a squelch, then a voice, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cYou better come to the supply shed.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n \u201cNow, Garland.\u201d\n Cole shoved Bell into the wall. Shoved him hard, so his teeth clacked.\n And the rage was there again in the cutting torch eyes. Rage like nothing else mattered. Scarred hands curled into Bell\u2019s shirt.\n \u201cThis is your last chance,\u201d Cole said.\n Bell only smiled, feeling something shift inside him. He found suddenly that he was through being scared. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he said.\n Bell ducked the first blow, but the second caught him upside the head, splitting his brow open. Bell spun away, throwing an elbow that missed, and then they were both off balance, taking wild swings, and Cole grabbed at him, and they were falling. They hit the ground and rolled, wrestling for on the filthy floor. Cole came up on top, sitting on Bell\u2019s legs. \u201cI fucking warned you,\u201d he hissed, and then he rained down punches until Garland tackled him.\n After that, it was two on one, and Bell didn\u2019t feel the least bit guilty about that.\n The zoo super interviewed Bell for her report. They sat in her office. Behind her, against the wall, her fish swam their little circles. The superintendent leaned forward and laced her hands together on her desk.\n She didn\u2019t dig very deep. Seemed to think Cole's behavior was its own explanation. \u201cI think you need stitches,\u201d she said.\n Bell nodded. He touched his brow. His first zoo scar.\n \u201cHe\u2019ll be barred from the zoo, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll insist that his community service hours be revoked.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to him now?\u201d\n \u201cCharges probably.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to press charges.\u201d\n \u201cAnimal cruelty. The lemurs. He\u2019s going back to jail.\u201d She paused, then added, \u201cWhen they find him.\u201d\n Bell looked at the fish, swimming in the aquarium. \u201cHe said he\u2019s never going back.\u201d\n That evening, as he was closing up, Bell found Cole\u2019s parting gift. Found it revealed, at first, in the presence of a door ajar.\n The back room of the castle.\n Bell stared at what had been done.\n After the fight, Cole had climbed to his feet, wiped the blood from his face\u2014and then walked off. Heading toward the gates. Even two on one, the fight had been about even, and when Cole had finally stepped back and walked away, Bell and Gavin let him go. A draw. They\u2019d assumed Cole left zoo property. But he hadn\u2019t left.\n He\u2019d circled back around to the castle.\n And he\u2019d poured lye into each and every terrarium.\n Several grubs were on the cement floor, ground into pulp with a boot.\n Others were desiccated husks. Only a few still moved, writhing in the white powder. Bell stepped further into the room, surveying the carnage. He should have known. He should have known this was coming.\n Bell\u2019s inner alarm started bothering him on his way home that night.\n Once a zookeeper developed an inner alarm, it worked everywhere.\n In this case, it was less an alarm than a sense of something out of place. It got stronger as he closed in on the trailer park. At first he thought the alarm had something to do with Cole, but when he got home, he understood. The universe had an interesting sense of timing.\n Lin was gone.\n Not like gone to the store. Gone, left. Leaving him.\n She left a note about it. The note explained. Blamed him.\n Distantly, he heard himself curse.\n All Bell could think, at first, was that she didn\u2019t seem to have taken anything. Like there was nothing about their life worth bothering with. She had written the whole thing off, it seemed. Him. Their life. A total loss.\n He made some growling noises.\n She might be back. She might change her mind.\n The stereo, after all, was really hers. She\u2019d had it before they moved in together, and they\u2019d never been able to afford a new one.\n Somberly, he unplugged the stereo. In something like a trance, he planted it in the sink and turned on the water. Like a zombie, he let the water run and started searching the trailer for enough change to buy beer.\n The next month passed in a haze.\n Word filtered down, as word always did, and it turned out Cole had skipped town. The cops were still looking.\n Not many of the grubs had survived Cole\u2019s attack. The ones that did were scarred. Cole had been very thorough, even pouring lye in the terrarium on the floor. In all, only a handful of the grubs finished their cocoons. A few from the control cage. A few from the terrarium marked \u201cheat\u201d next to the space heater. But they were twisted things, these cocoons. Damaged things. His experiment was ruined. His hope was that he\u2019d be able to get at least a few reproducing adults, start over. If the cocoons hatched at all.\n And word had filtered down, too, that it would be bad for Cole when he was caught, because the list of charges had grown, and the warrant had sprouted teeth. Cole was facing time, real time, for what had happened. Bell knew Cole would need someone to blame.\n He would blame Bell, and he would blame the zoo.\n Several weeks later, Bell pulled into the parking lot and found there were fire trucks already in the lot. Hoses ran upward along the hill. Black smoke curled into the sky. Bell ran. He knew what he\u2019d see before he saw it. The castle was engulfed in flame. The firefighters fought the blaze, but Bell knew it was too late. He imagined the animals inside baking. He imagined the sizzle and pop of burst skin, the soundless cries of dying snakes and lizards and frogs and bugs. He imagined his insects burning alive.\n He looked around, searching for Cole, wondering if he\u2019d stayed long enough to watch it burn.\n When the fire was out, Bell walked through the ruins. The devastation was complete. Dead frogs and snakes and lizards. In the back room, he found the terrariums blackened and cracked. The insects inside charred and unrecognizable.\n Except for one. The terrarium on the floor.\n The terrarium with the heat sticker, now curled and blackened.\n The cocoon was charred, split wide by the heat of the fire.\n There was no grub inside.\n They found Cole\u2019s body later that day in the weeds behind the parking lot. Bell watched them load the body into the ambulance. Dark and swollen. It had been a bad death.\n There were burns, minor, across his hands, like he\u2019d come too close to his creation.\n Burns and something else.\n Something like stings.\n Eyes swollen shut, anaphylactic shock.\n Not everything burned in the fire.\n Not all that burns is consumed. Cole had said that once.\n Bell stood there for a long time, listening. Listening for a buzz like an electric light, but there was no sound. Only the sound of wind in the trees.\n It was long gone, whatever it was. He just wished he could have seen what the grub had turned into. Next year it would be different.\n Next year it would be a fruit eater, or a wasp, or a beetle. It would be what it needed to be.\n It would be what the world made it.\n Approaching home, Bell felt his inner alarm stir again.\n The cable had been turned off.\n Those cocksuckers didn\u2019t know who they were dealing with. Bell had gotten drunk two nights in a row now, and he was feeling mean, feeling predatory.\n He stalked outside, nine trailers down to the cable box, opened it up with a hex wrench, and hooked his cable back up.\n Went home and surfed channels for anything resembling porn.\n After two hours of this, his thumb hurt and the battery on the remote died.\n He heard the screen door open.\n Lin?\n In the moment before the inner door opened, it occurred to him that her stereo was still soaking in the kitchen sink. He had a momentary, fearful impulse; his leg jerked. Then the beer kicked back in. He slouched back. He sneered like a sleepy lion.\n A shape in a doorway.\n Seana.\n His sneer disappeared.\n She stepped inside and said nothing. Looked at him a moment, as if reading him. Slouched down beside him with a sack of takeout chicken.\n His hand, heavy and lazy, rested on her leg.\n She tugged his hand higher.\n They didn\u2019t talk. Even the TV flashed in silence.\n Outside the thin walls, the world licked itself and made hunting noises.\n Originally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, October-November 2009.\n Ted Kosmatka set his sights early on being a writer. This mostly involved having all his writing rejected, pursuing a biology degree, dropping out before graduation, and becoming a steelworker like his father and grandfather. Then the mill went bankrupt. At one point, he worked in a zoo. Now he works in video games, and his latest novel, The Flicker Men, came out last summer.\n Michael Poore's work has appeared in numerous magazines, including Glimmer Train, AGNI, and Asimov's Science Fiction. His novel, Up Jumps the Devil, hailed by the New York Review of Books as \"an elegiac masterpiece,\" is available from HarperCollins.

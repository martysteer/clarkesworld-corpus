With his shock of prematurely white hair and pale skin scarred by some vindictive childhood illness, he tended to look even older\u2014especially when he was seized, as now, with what Hank considered his \u2018mad scientist fits\u2019.\n \u201cSo what is it?\u201d Hank asked.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have the lab equipment. I don\u2019t have equipment for anything like this.\u201d\n An old grievance. It wasn\u2019t so much that Blue Glacier was under-equipped. Indeed, while the base was being established, money had been thrown at it in mind-boggling quantities. But without a specific mandate, no one had known exactly what to buy with those inflated budgets. They\u2019d requested tools, machines, and software according to guesses of what might be useful down the line. In the end, whether from funding cuts, space restrictions on shuttles, or pure bureaucratic obstinacy, much of it had never materialized.\n These days, to Fasbender\u2019s endless frustration, nobody ever asked what they needed.\n \u201cI might be able to rustle something up,\u201d Hank said helplessly. \u201cIf you can explain what you need and why.\u201d\n Fasbender just glared from beneath flamboyant eyebrows, as though reprimanding an obstinate child.\n \u201cOh come on. If it\u2019s something important, they\u2019ll listen. It is important, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Fasbender said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important. It\u2019s too important for red tape, for protocols, for orders signed in triplicate. It\u2019s too important to sit on. That\u2019s why, Hank, I\u2019m going to ask you to do something you really won\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n Ever since their arrival, Hank had loved and despised going outside in equal measure. There was something about the uncompromised desolation that stirred him, that took him out of himself, even in his worst moods. The pocked surface of Shackleton Crater peeled away in every direction, a void beneath vast skies, its jagged rim blindingly bright compared to the absolute darkness of its depths. It was lonely, utterly lonely\u2014and breathtaking.\n Yet here he was, spoiling it. There was the bit he hated. The rover bounced and lurched in the loose regolith, churning dust beneath its bubble wheels, traveling within a chalky cloud that followed like some agitated ghost. Out here, Hank always felt like the worst kind of tourist.\n He sighed. At least he was lucky enough to see firsthand what the vast majority would only ever experience through the feeds and LOsim. So why was he about to do something that might\u2014no, had to\u2014jeopardize that?\n Because if Fasbender\u2019s right, this is too big not to. So suck it up, Schakowsky.\n Behind him, Blue Glacier sat like a basking toad. Ahead, Yang Liwei loomed nearer. It was easy, and misleading, to make assumptions about the societies that had constructed each one from their eccentricities of design. The Chinese base might be brutal in its functionality of form, but Fasbender was right about one thing: Yang Liwei was a scientific research station in a way that Blue Glacier wasn\u2019t and had never been intended to be.\n He drove slowly to negate any suggestion of hostility, however insane such a threat might be. There was a patch of churned ground before the entrance, a scar from Yang Liwei\u2019s construction. Hank let the rover grind to a halt in front of it and swung to the ground. Dust spat around his booted feet, but inside the suit he felt and heard nothing, and saw only what the spotlights and his photocromic visor allowed. He took one awkward step, then another, and wondered what the hell he was expecting. For two years, the US and Chinese astronautic teams had sat opposite each other, engaged in what had always seemed like the geopolitical equivalent of a staring contest. Would they vaporize him? Ignore him? Did they even know he was out here?\n Hank took a third step. His helmet mike spat static.\n A female voice said, \u201cCommander Schakowsky, welcome to Yang Liwei Lunar Science Station. May we ask what took you so long to visit?\u201d\n \u201cYou have to understand, we had orders. Well, we still have. Only, our scientist thinks that after what Crazy Bessie brought in . . . \u201d Hank realized he probably wasn\u2019t making much sense. \u201cBessie\u2019s our robot. She\u2019s one of the prototype AI-led rovers Holier has been developing for the Mars program. It took us a while to beat the kinks out of her programming, though. Like trying to train a too-smart dog. Ah\u2014\u201d\n The woman opposite him smiled patiently, and Hank lost his thread again. Until now, Liang Lei had been a face on the feeds, rather intense and harsh-looking in her stark blue-grey uniform. She was famously charismatic, a celebrity in her native country. But Hank\u2019s Chinese was atrocious, and charm, it seemed, lost a lot without translation.\n In the last few minutes, however, her perfect English had not only shamed his own linguistic limitations but also made him realize why she was so well-liked. She spoke with a slight lilt and a hint of laughter, both of which made her seem more attractive than her hard features might suggest.\n As if this wasn\u2019t difficult enough already . . .\n \u201cSo anyway,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve brought over a file with Doctor Fasbender\u2019s notes and results so far\u2014which I\u2019d be grateful if you could keep to yourselves, because I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d drag me home and shoot me if they knew I was doing this.\u201d Or would they? Do they even care what we do up here anymore? \u201cYou have us over a barrel. But Fasbender has this nutty idea that science should be bigger than borders, and this even nuttier idea you\u2019ll think the same way.\u201d\n Liang smiled. \u201cI think I would like to meet your Doctor Fasbender.\u201d\n Hank grinned back, and felt a tremendous release of tension. \u201cBelieve me, you wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019s stubborn and annoying. In fact, if you really like the sound of him, I might be willing to trade.\u201d\n Liang\u2019s smile broadened, her surprisingly pretty face became a little prettier still, and Hank struggled to hold his thoughts together.\n \u201cThe way I see it, Commander,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re stuck up here together. Now that I think about it, we should have been friends from the start. I\u2019m sorry for that. Right now, though, we may have found something big . . . and if we have, then we need your help.\u201d\n \u201cPlease,\u201d she replied. \u201cMy name is Lei. And you\u2019re right, we should have been friends before today. The Moon is a lonely enough place without us making it lonelier still.\u201d\n \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sit right.\u201d Landeimer, third and final member of Blue Glacier's small staff, sat on the canteen table, kicking his heels savagely against its supports. \u201cSomething\u2019s up.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re in exactly the same boat we are. Once the Chinese authorities had a flag waving permanently on the Moon, they lost interest, just like our people did. What\u2019s so strange about that?\u201d\n \u201cNot that. It\u2019s the way you\u2019re taking it so well.\u201d\n Hank laughed awkwardly. \u201cCommander Liang is a persuasive lady.\u201d\n \u201cI thought you were meant to be persuading her.\u201d\n \u201cSure. That too.\u201d Desperate to change to the subject, Hank turned to Fasbender. \u201cSo where does this leave us? What happens now?\u201d\n Fasbender stood with his back half to them, distractedly picking at a tube of rhubarb-flavored nutrient gel. He shook his head. \u201cThis leaves us with the boring stuff, Hank\u2014the actual science. You did your part, and I appreciate that. Now I have to get on with mine. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want me explaining it to you.\u201d\n That stung, because Hank really had stuck his neck out, but also because the implied criticism was more than a little justified. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been distracted lately, I admit it. But I care about this. I want to understand.\u201d\n Fasbender glared from under his gargantuan eyebrows, holding the nutri-gel straight out like a weapon. Then he glanced down at his hand, looked puzzled for a moment, and relaxed. \u201cYou have been rather noncommittal these last few months. And you do seem different now.\u201d\n Hank sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You too, Landeimer. The last year hasn\u2019t been what any of us expected when we signed up. If we can do some good here, though, I want in on that. Just talk me through it, okay?\u201d\n For once, he was relieved to see Fasbender slip into mad scientist mode. As though his thought processes were powered by motion, the doctor began a circuit of the room: past the portholes of the outer wall, then the doors to the bunk hall, comm room, laboratory, and airlock, and then past the portholes again, emphasizing in a few short moments how claustrophobic their existence was. \u201cObviously,\u201d he said, \u201cit began with the water.\u201d\n This, at least, Hank understood. After the supply shuttles had started to become irregular, Hank had raised the unpleasant possibility that one day\u2014if the cold war back home ever turned hot\u2014they might find themselves stuck with no support at all. They\u2019d discussed food rationing, and Landeimer had explained how they could boost the output from the solar panels to cover if the fuel cells dried up. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about your idea of mining for ice in the unlit regions of the crater wall?\u201d\n \u201cCorrect. Landeimer and I have made a lot of headway since we ironed out the glitches in Bessie\u2019s code.\u201d Fasbender always seemed taller when he was orating. Now Hank was certain the doctor had gained a clear couple of inches. \u201cThere are some sizeable deposits over there, most likely brought in by meteorites and other space debris. It\u2019s spread out and tricky to get at, but Bessie came up with the goods.\u201d\n \u201cHence the bottle you were waving around.\u201d\n \u201cYes. Because what Bessie brought back wasn\u2019t just water. There was something else in it. Something living.\u201d\n \u201cEven though that should be impossible with no atmosphere.\u201d\n He felt childishly pleased to be making a useful contribution, which only made it worse when Fasbender started glaring at him again. \u201cMy God, Henry. I know we\u2019re from different specialisms, but did they teach you nothing at Canaveral? Of course there\u2019s an atmosphere. Outgassing and run-off from the solar wind, among other things, take care of that. There are even traces of oxygen. What\u2019s important is that there\u2019s nowhere near enough for any aerobic organism to get by on.\u201d\n \u201cWhich means what you\u2019ve found must be anaerobic?\u201d asked Hank desperately.\n \u201cCorrect. That in itself makes it unusual and potentially useful. What\u2019s truly rare, however, is that it generates oxygen without relying on photosynthesis. It processes water much like any earthbound plant, but takes its energy from the radioactive decay of rocks, as certain methanogen-based microbes do.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a good job I don\u2019t need to understand that. I think I see the significance, at least. We give it water and it makes air, right?\u201d\n \u201cNot air, no . . . but a way of farming oxygen on the moon would be a fine start. It might also be a potential biofuel if one could find sufficient ice reserves, or even the basis for a food protein. Imagine, fields of Glacier Grass stretching across the lunar\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cOh. Yes, that\u2019s what Landeimer\u2019s been calling it. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve adopted the term, despite its utter inaccuracy.\u201d Abruptly, as though suddenly tired, Fasbender leaned back against the canteen table, forcing Landeimer to shuffle aside. \u201cThe point is, Henry, that the possibilities are enormous.\u201d\n \u201cI get that much. So now might be the time to tell you that I\u2019ve arranged for the Chinese to come over here in about\u2014oh, half an hour\u2019s time. We\u2019re going to thrash this out, the three of us with the five of them. So I have one more question.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d Fasbender creased his eyebrows suspiciously.\n Hank grinned. \u201cWho wants to bake the welcome cake?\u201d\n In the end, they settled for cocktails. Landeimer had an unexplained supply of some virulent alcohol that seemed to materialize whenever he was in a black mood. On his worst days, he\u2019d taken to mixing it experimentally with various fruit and vegetable nutrient pastes, which he forced the others to try. The results had been variable, to say the least. Thankfully, he spared their guests the more bizarre concoctions in favor of his safer recipes.\n There were eight of them crammed into the small canteen now, more than twice the number for which it had been intended. Fasbender had bonded instantly with his Chinese counterpart, and Hank had drawn wry amusement from his uncharacteristically puppyish attitude towards the famous bacteriologist.\n As the meeting had progressed and the science become more in-depth, those with least to contribute had drifted towards the peripheries. Hank now stood halfway through the bunk hall door, a position that was playing havoc with its sensors. Every few seconds the door would attempt to close, bump against his foot, and offer a sad mechanical sigh. Liang Lei was leaning against the wall, deftly protecting her glass from the darts of elbows and shoulders.\n Hank took a careful sip of his mystery alcohol, avocado paste, and rehydrated lime sling, and said, \u201cI thought I knew what they were talking about an hour ago. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s English anymore. Is it Chinese?\u201d\n She offered the smile that had made such an impact on him earlier. \u201cI was educated in Community Management. I am just as confused as you, Henry.\u201d\n Feeling his cheeks flush warmly, he said, \u201cPlease, it\u2019s Hank. No one but Fasbender calls me Henry, and I think he only does it to annoy me.\u201d\n \u201cHank,\u201d she said, as if testing the sound. \u201cAren\u2019t you bothered by that door hitting your foot?\u201d\n \u201cSure. How are you enjoying dodging elbows?\u201d\n \u201cVery little.\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time we moved then.\u201d\n He stepped back into the bunkroom, sat down and waved toward the opposite beds. She perched on the edge of the lowest. He couldn\u2019t help noticing how her nose wrinkled. \u201cWe\u2019ve had trouble with the air recycling, and the new tanks have been delayed,\u201d he explained apologetically. \u201cAlso, Fasbender seems to think that changing his overall every day is a luxury.\u201d\n \u201cIt must be strange to have volunteered for this life,\u201d she said.\n \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cI was chosen. It was a great honor.\u201d\n \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t change it. I wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything. Even if the worst happens, even if . . . \u201d He faltered. He\u2019d said more than he\u2019d meant to. In fact, he\u2019d strayed onto a subject he would never have deliberately raised.\n \u201cI spoke a little with your Mister Landeimer,\u201d Lei said. \u201cHe mentioned that you\u2019ve been troubled. That you\u2019ve been watching all the time for news from Earth and worrying they have forgotten you.\u201d\n Unable to read her tone, he nodded. He felt oddly guilty, as though his earlier excitement had soured like old milk.\n \u201cI have been troubled too,\u201d Lei said, almost in a whisper.\n Hank started. \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cWe were put here to\u2014\u201d She struggled to find the right phrase in the less familiar language. \u201cTo make a point. We were sent here to prove how superior our science was, just as you were sent to prove that anything we could do, you could better. Now both points have been made. We are no longer news, and at home they wonder what to do with us.\u201d\n Astonished to hear his own anxieties summed up so perfectly, Hank could only nod.\n \u201cMister Landeimer also said that you have been looking for ways to survive on your own here, if the need should come. What I wanted to tell you is that so have we. We are growing a little food and generating our own power. We have improved our air filters. While the doctors investigate their discovery, would you work on this with me?\u201d\n Hank felt such relief that he fought an urge to cry or, perhaps more rationally, to lean forward and kiss her. Instead, he smiled tiredly and said, \u201cLei, I\u2019d be very glad to.\u201d\n The next few days were the best he\u2019d spent on the Moon\u2014better even than those first weeks when it was all new and all exciting, a marathon endeavor driven by seemingly inexhaustible supplies of adrenalin.\n Almost effortlessly, the lunar population\u2014for suddenly, amazingly, that was what they were\u2014split into two new factions, without any hint of discord. Fasbender and the Chinese bacteriologist Shen Tao pursued their science project. Everyone else worked under Hank and Lei, developing ways to prolong their survival should the worst happen.\n That had been a gloomy and paranoid occupation when it had been just the three of them. Now, with the two camps combined, it seemed no more than a sensible precaution, about which they could talk openly and even joke. It felt like a holiday, or an exchange project between two ramshackle schools. New friendships were made. A weight lifted.\n Hank noticed not only a change in himself, but in Landeimer\u2019s and Fasbender\u2019s behavior as well. Landeimer was drinking less, and when he did, it was because he\u2019d arranged a poker game with new acquaintances from the Chinese base. Fasbender seemed younger and walked without a stoop that Hank had never consciously noticed him develop. He was as enthusiastic as he\u2019d been in the days before the launch, and considerably more focused.\n Hank knew, however, without pride or modesty, that he\u2019d changed more than either of the others. For months, the responsibility of leadership had been a weight holding him uselessly in place. Now it was an opportunity. They were the first citizens of a new world. How had he failed to see that?\n He also realized quickly, even without Landeimer\u2019s conspiratorial glances and frequently inappropriate comments, that Lei was a part of that. It wasn\u2019t just attraction, though he was grown-up enough to admit it was partly that. More, it was the sharing of a burden that had nearly crushed him, and the discovery that it had always been shared. He\u2019d imagined\u2014as the peoples of Earth had imagined\u2014a conflict between the two hemispheres of Shackleton Crater, where in fact there had only been mirror images fighting the same weary fight.\n They tweaked the air filters in Blue Glacier using adaptations the Chinese had developed, extending the filters\u2019 lifetime by at least two years. The Americans were awed by the garden of cress and fungi growing in one wing of Yang Liwei, and Landeimer\u2014revealing a hobbyist\u2019s interest in botany that Hank would never have guessed at in a million years\u2014made a number of useful suggestions to increase their yield. They calculated that Bessie, working at full capacity from a suitable reservoir of ice, could keep them all in water for four months or more. There was even talk of devising a well and a pipeline, though that might take upwards of a year.\n Behind it all, like a persistent rumor, was Fasbender\u2019s sample of Glacier Grass. For a long while, Hank felt no need to discuss it with Lei, but by the third week\u2014when it became abundantly clear that nothing else they did could match the possibilities of Bessie\u2019s chance find\u2014he found himself forced to raise the subject. They had slipped away and come to rest in the garden, with its mottled splotches of khaki and empires of fungal grey.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over this,\u201d Hank said wonderingly.\n \u201cI remember when the first seed broke through. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more happy.\u201d\n \u201cIf what Fasbender and Tao are saying is right, then this may only be the beginning. Have you heard the latest?\u201d\n \u201cYes. Doctor Fasbender is sure now that it could be processed into food.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve had to forbid him from trying to eat the stuff. They still don\u2019t really understand its growth mechanism. We\u2019d have to bring in Earth before we thought about that angle seriously.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Lei agreed, and the note of melancholy in her voice surprised him.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n \u201cOh . . . \u201d She looked up at him quizzically, and tugged unconsciously at a coil of hair. Just when he was certain she wouldn\u2019t answer, she said, \u201cBack in China, they would call me a traitor.\u201d\n Hank considered. \u201cProbably.\u201d\n \u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t like this. I hope that things will get better between our countries. I hope that one day they will be glad of what we\u2019ve done. Perhaps then they will look at this place with hope and not as a playground to fight in.\u201d\n \u201cNothing lasts forever. In the meantime, we\u2019re just going to have to live with the possibility of being branded traitors. With that in mind,\u201d he said, and then halted, suddenly unsure if he wasn\u2019t too bashful to ask what he\u2019d maneuvered Lei in here to ask. He\u2019d never been good at things like this.\n You\u2019re standing in a garden on the Moon. Perhaps it\u2019s time to start adjusting your ideas of what you can and can\u2019t do.\n He gulped. \u201cHow would you feel about conspiring with me over dinner tonight?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re going to do all night, go for a walk outside? Man, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d organize this without even asking us.\u201d\n \u201cPaul, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d It had been hard enough just revealing his plans for the evening to the others, let alone asking if they\u2019d be okay with vacating the base for a few hours. What kind of a date would it be, though, with Landeimer thrusting peculiar cocktails at them and Fasbender regaling them with his latest discoveries? Still, it was true that he hadn\u2019t thought the details through. If he had, he would never have got around to saying anything. \u201cI\u2019ll absolutely owe you one. I\u2019ll return the favor or\u2014\u201d\n Landeimer\u2019s poker face cracked into a wicked grin. \u201cHank, you\u2019re so easy. Who\u2019s the one who\u2019s been telling you that you should make a move? Anyway, I\u2019ve got a game organized and Fasbender, to everyone\u2019s surprise, is doing science stuff with his new best pal.\u201d\n Fasbender nodded sagely. \u201cWe\u2019re trialing a half-dozen samples with different nutrient bases, seeing if we can\u2019t stimulate a better growth rate.\u201d\n \u201cDamn. I hadn\u2019t thought about that.\u201d\n \u201cWell, why would you have?\u201d\n \u201cNo . . . I mean, what are we going to eat tonight? What kind of a romantic dinner can you have over ham and pea nutrient tubes?\u201d\n \u201cI have some cookies,\u201d Fasbender said. \u201cI was saving them for a special occasion, and this is as good as any.\u201d\n \u201cAlbert, you\u2019re a bona fide saint. I\u2014\u201d\n He was cut off by the raucous screech of the airlock alarm. Surely Lei wouldn\u2019t turn up two hours early . . .\n When he went to the screen, he saw\u2014not from the anonymous bulk of the suit, but by the familiar nametag on its shoulder\u2014that it was her. Surprised and suddenly anxious, he hammered the button marked \u2018cycle\u2019 and ducked through the door, leaving Fasbender and Landeimer exchanging puzzled glances.\n For safety reasons, the airlock was a short distance from the base proper. By the time Hank had reached the other end and the huge doors had whirred open, Lei already had her helmet off and tucked beneath one arm. Though her face was perfectly composed, something in her expression made him certain that she\u2019d been crying.\n Before he could ask what was wrong, she said, \u201cThey\u2019re taking us back.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d He stared at her in horror, willing the words back into her mouth.\n \u201cIn a few hours. They\u2019re coming to take us back. The shuttle has already been dispatched.\u201d\n The words barely seemed to penetrate the fog that had suddenly seeped into his brain. \u201cIs it because of\u2014of us, the last few weeks?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know everything, but there has been some change in Beijing. They say now that Yang Liwei is wasteful, that only America chooses to be wasteful in such a way. They say we have no purpose here. It must have been planned for weeks, for months, but they only told us now.\u201d\n \u201cWill you be in trouble?\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps for a while. Then perhaps they will call us heroes. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Lei drew a hand across her face. \u201cI came to say goodbye, Hank. We haven\u2019t much time, and there\u2019s so much to do. They told us to destroy whatever we can.\u201d\n For a moment, her voice faltered. In that instant, Hank remembered the garden in precise detail, every dull grey orb and spike of muted green, and as though they were joined by some momentary telepathy, he knew she was thinking of it too. He wanted urgently to hold her, and realized that any physical connection would be impossible through the bloated mass of her suit.\n The moment passed.\n Her surface calm restored, Lei said, \u201cI have something to return to you.\u201d\n She unzipped one of the suit\u2019s flabby pockets and drew out a flask of some unhealthy-looking liquid. Hank stared in confusion until he recognized it as Fasbender\u2019s original sample of Glacier Grass. He took it from her carefully.\n \u201cGoodbye, Hank,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t have dinner with you. I hope that one day, when things are different, you will ask me again.\u201d\n Then she replaced her helmet, and he could no longer see her face.\n It was almost a relief.\n Hank had watched the shuttle, though it was only visible as occasional glints of light depending on the angle of its solar panels, and the effect had been like staring at an empty bottle perched just in sight on a very bright day.\n He\u2019d finally given up and glanced around Shackleton Crater instead. He found nothing in its stark horizons to reassure him, even though this might be the last time he saw it properly. Its walls hung like sheet iron lain upon some colossal scrap heap. Its shadows seemed sinister and unreal.\n An hour ago, two hours after he\u2019d last seen Lei, their own orders had come through. Prepare for recovery at 22:00. Destroy all paper records, electronic memory, organics.\n Among other things, it confirmed what he\u2019d sometimes suspected. The two governments were quite capable of putting aside their hostilities when it suited them. This mutual retreat from the moon had probably been agreed upon months ago.\n Landeimer had taken it well, perhaps had even been pleased. He\u2019d always had the most difficulty with the combination of extreme isolation and constant companionship imposed by lunar living. Fasbender had been stoic, though there had been something heartbreaking in his expression as he fed his samples and data piece by piece into the incinerator.\n When Landeimer had been absent, he\u2019d asked Hank, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do anything stupid, are you? You\u2019re not thinking of defecting?\u201d\n \u201cIt would kill my folks,\u201d he\u2019d replied, only then realizing that on some level he had been considering it.\n For an instant, anger made him clench his hands until his palms stung. He\u2019d been happy when Lei was around, happier than he ever remembered feeling. Now, most likely, he would never see her again.\n He hadn\u2019t consciously planned to go outside. He had drifted towards the airlock and clambered into his suit with barely a hint of conscious purpose. He\u2019d only remembered the flask in the pocket of his overall at the last minute. The only remaining sample of Glacier Grass, perhaps all that remained in the solar system\u2014maybe the entire galaxy. Still with no real intention, he\u2019d transferred it to a pouch of the suit.\n He\u2019d stared skyward for a long while, observing the Chinese shuttle in its delicate pirouette against the blackness. During that time, a realization had struck him. All those days ago, Lei had never revealed what it was that frightened her. He\u2019d assumed she shared his phobia of abandonment. Perhaps the truth was that, despite his months-long obsession with the barrage of often-contradictory messages their nations sent out, she\u2019d understood the politics between them better than he ever had. Perhaps she\u2019d simply been afraid of this day, and of saying goodbye to her bleak, magnificent foster home.\n Only now, glancing with dissatisfaction around Shackleton Crater, did he remember the flask. He took it out and gazed at it, watching the dark flakes that swirled inside, and realized why he\u2019d come out here in the first place. He remembered what he\u2019d asked Fasbender as he watched his friend cramming the last of his handwritten notes into the incinerator.\n \u201cYou really think Glacier Grass could have survived out there? In that dark and cold? It really could have grown?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I believe so. Of course, we\u2019ll never know for sure.\u201d\n Hank opened his fingers. In the low gravity, the flask fell slowly and settled lazily into the dust. Only when he stamped with his weighted boot did it break, and its contents burst free. An instant later, there was nothing to see but glistening shards of glass and ice.\n Yet amid the debris was something that could grow without air\u2014without atmosphere. Something that had traveled an unimaginably long way. Something that one day might be food, might be fuel, or might be turned to other undreamed-of uses if it survived to be rediscovered.\n It had made it this far. Maybe the odds weren\u2019t so bad.\n He wanted to say something though there was no one to hear. Nothing came to mind. He tried to remember what Lei had told him in the garden that day, and found he couldn\u2019t even manage that. The words jumbled. All he could hear was the specific lilt of her voice.\n In desperation, Hank paraphrased. \u201cWell, we screwed up today. Here\u2019s hoping we get it right tomorrow.\u201d\n David Tallerman is the author of the comic fantasy novels Giant Thief and Crown Thief, as well as the absurdist steampunk graphic novel Endangered Weapon B: Mechanimal Science.

They have a not-so-simple job: select, prepare, and present the best stories they can to a specific audience.Below, ten of the top speculative fiction magazine editors talk about what they do and how they do it. Each of the editors works for a different speculative fiction magazine\u2014print or online (or both), new or long-running (or revived after a hiatus). They seek fantasy, science fiction, or horror stories . . . or some innovative combination thereof.Ultimately, fiction editors are the people who mine the slush pile for new voices and who push established writers to grow beyond their previous stories. They read story after story, and more pile up each day. They screen, sort, revise, and reject. They seek the new, the fresh, the familiar, the entertaining, and the weird. They discover and they miss out.\u201cThere is no magic formula,\u201d said Gordon Van Gelder of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. And this holds true for writing stories, submitting stories, and editing stories.For, as Patrick Nielsen Hayden of Tor.com said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about writers and editors; it\u2019s about stories and readers.\u201dThe Editors, Their Magazines & Their Editorial PhilosophiesPatrick Nielsen Hayden edits books for Tor Books and short fiction for Tor.com. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I have an organizing \u2018philosophy,\u2019 or that I would trust one even if one occurred to me,\u201d said Nielsen Hayden. \u201cI do have a belief, which is that I\u2019m working for the reader. I work with authors, and publishers pay me, but my real boss is the person who\u2019s just looking for something interesting to read.\u201d For more information about him visit his webpage.Shawna McCarthy is an editor, anthologist, and literary agent. \u201cI believe that genre fiction should be held to a standard every bit as high as mainstream fiction,\u201d said McCarthy, who has been the editor at Realms of Fantasy since the first issue in 1994.John O\u2019Neill is the publisher and editor of Black Gate magazine. \u201cI think a magazine becomes successful by finding new, emerging authors and providing them with a stage, helping them launch their careers in your pages, and enjoying the fruits of their success along the way,\u201d said O\u2019Neill.Cat Rambo is a fiction writer and the co-editor of Fantasy Magazine. \u201cMy editorial philosophy is to try to create a magazine that the readers can enjoy and identify with,\u201d she said. Learn more about Rambo at her webpage.Mike Resnick co-edits Jim Baen\u2019s Universe. He is also a prolific fiction and non-fiction writer. As an editor, he said, \u201cI try to remember that not all readers share my taste, and to select the best stories, regardless of subject matter or approach.\u201d Learn more about Resnick at his webpage.Stanley Schmidt is a fiction and non-fiction writer, as well as an editor at Analog Science Fiction and Fact. \u201cMy editorial goal,\u201d Schmidt said, \u201cis to produce that science fiction magazine I would most like to read if I had to pay for my subscription and could only afford one.\u201d Learn more about him here.Jason Sizemore is a fiction writer and the founding editor of Apex Magazine. \u201cI\u2019m a hands-on editor who is a stickler for getting the story just so,\u201d said Sizemore. Learn more about Sizemore at his webpage.Gordon Van Gelder is editor and publisher of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. \u201cI subscribe to Maxwell Perkins\u2019s theory that an editor\u2019s hand should be invisible,\u201d said Van Gelder. \u201cI publish works that I think readers will find entertaining, and I do my best to publish them responsibly.Sheila Williams is the editor at Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction. \u201cI\u2019m excited by a lot of young and up-and-coming authors,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI\u2019m always thrilled when I find the second story that I love by a new author because that shows me that the author may be a new force to be reckoned with.\u201dAnn VanderMeer is an anthologist and fiction editor at Weird Tales. \u201cI see myself somewhat as a cheerleader for great fiction. My philosophy is to bring the widest possible audience to fiction that I love. The story is all\u2014a big name or previous credits are not important to me, only the story.\u201dThe Questions & AnswersWhat do you look for in a short story?VanderMeer: I look for originality, uniqueness and the weird. I especially love work that makes me look at fiction in a new light. I love to be surprised (not grossed out, please) and completely drawn into a story. If I start to read a story and do not want to stop, that\u2019s a very good sign. When I do stop reading, if that story stays with me for the next few days, that\u2019s another good sign.McCarthy: I\u2019ve been doing this for so long now that what I really look for is something I haven\u2019t seen before, which is very difficult to do, but it does happen!O\u2019Neill: First and foremost, I\u2019m looking for a rousing work of fantasy\u2014an opening that grabs attention, a middle that heightens expectations, and finally a satisfying climax that delivers.Beyond that, I\u2019m looking for the same things that every other editor is: freshness of voice, originality in setting and character, and a certain skill in creating and building narrative tension.Resnick: The first thing a story has to do is appeal to me on an emotional level: it has to make me love or hate or fear or laugh\u2014in other words, to make me feel. If it also makes me think, so much the better . . . but if it doesn\u2019t make me feel, then the author has simply written a thinly-disguised polemic or a fictionalized high-tech crossword puzzle.Rambo: I look for the stories that come back the next day and make me think about them some more.Schmidt: Ideally, I would like a story so engagingly written that I forget I\u2019m reading it, with a provocative idea I\u2019d never thought of before so deeply integrated into it that it couldn\u2019t be removed without making the whole story collapse.Sizemore: Being a web-based magazine, the opening sentence [or] paragraph becomes the most important aspect of your story. Readers on the web are fickle and know that with one simple click they can move on to other things. Compare that to where you shell out a fiver for a magazine of stories, you\u2019re more likely to stick with it since you\u2019ve got something on the line, so to speak.Van Gelder: Ideally, I look for a story that grabs me with the first line, draws me in, comes alive, and makes me forget everything around me until it all wraps up with a satisfying conclusion.I also look for my baseball team\u2019s pitchers to throw a perfect game every time out, but since these things don\u2019t happen every day, here are some of the other things I look for in a short story:Story (too many submissions I receive nowadays are fragments or plotless mood pieces.)A strong narrative voice and good proseCompelling charactersAn interesting settingA solid storyline that leads to a conclusion that the story earns (as opposed to one that is tacked on)FreshnessWilliams: I enjoy experimental stories and adventure stories that entertain me. Even a story that breaks a reader\u2019s heart should be entertaining. I love big ideas, but I also need well-drawn characters. I love screwball comedies and stories that fill me with dread\u2014though I rarely enjoy straight out horror fiction.Nielsen Hayden: The glib (and yet true) answer is that I\u2019m looking for the thing I didn\u2019t know I was looking for. The first SF story I ever bought out of a slushpile was Maureen McHugh\u2019s novel China Mountain Zhang. But if you\u2019d asked me that morning what I was looking for, I probably wouldn\u2019t have said \u201ca picaresque, somewhat unstructured novel of a gay American-born Chinese man in a China-dominated future, filled out with substantial interludes in which the main character is neither present nor particularly relevant.\u201dI do have a couple of observable biases. I\u2019m very interested in stories that tell me something I didn\u2019t know about how the world works. And I\u2019m actively interested in SF\u2014specifically SF\u2014that speaks to the kind of emotional and psychological issues that are of interest to smart readers in their teens. This is not the same thing as \u201cYA SF,\u201d although it includes a lot of YA SF.What does \u201cfit\u201d mean for your magazine?Resnick: Not a thing. Eric Flint and I co-edit Jim Baen\u2019s Universe, and we both have to agree on a story before we\u2019ll buy it. In close to three years we\u2019ve disagreed once, and let the managing editor decide. There is no kind of fiction that can\u2019t fit our magazine if it\u2019s well done.VanderMeer: \u201cFit?\u201d It\u2019s gotta be weird, not the usual story you could see somewhere else. The kind of story when you see it you say, \u201cThat\u2019s a Weird Tales Story.\u201dMcCarthy: That\u2019s just rejection slip speak. When a rejection slip says your story wasn\u2019t a good fit for the magazine, it just means that for whatever reason, we didn\u2019t like it. I think it means the same thing for any magazine\u2014a story that\u2019s a good fit is one we like and would be happy to publish.O\u2019Neill: A story that fits is one that has a beginning, middle, and an ending. At Black Gate, we\u2019re not trying to be more \u201ccutting edge\u201d than everyone else, or looking to explore new frontiers of splatter-horror. We like adventure fantasy, especially classic adventure serials, and that\u2019s what our readers are clamoring for.I once got an angry letter from a reader asking why I didn\u2019t publish more medieval fantasy, with castles, princesses and dragons and the like. I thought it was a bit ridiculous at first. Isn\u2019t everyone as tired of that as I am? How many dragon\u2014slaying stories do we need? But now I think I understand what she meant. Like most editors I respond best to genuine innovation in fiction\u2014the original, truly well-crafted setting, the character with a fresh voice\u2014but there\u2019s a very real hunger for the familiar among readers, especially the trappings of the fantasy of our youth. I think we ignore that at our peril.Rambo: \u201cFit\u201d is such a nebulous word, and yet we all seem to use it, it seems. For me, a story that fits is one that has a fantasy element that matters to the story, and is more than a prop. While I like poetic and/or complicated language, too much of it can drag a story down and I want a story where the reader can float through the words, emerging changed from that immersion. I want the stories that stick with a reader, that they can worry over in their head like one of those simple puzzles that manages to be infinitely complex, infinitely challenging.I like stories that tease at the edges of human experience, that talk about love and sorrow and what it means to be a changing being in an endlessly shifting world. I look for stories that aren\u2019t mainstream, which don\u2019t reflect the consumer-culture cookie cutter images that have been created by corporate-owned media. If I\u2019m succeeding in that a small portion of the time, I\u2019m feeling that I\u2019m doing well.Schmidt: I\u2019m a matchmaker: I try to get writers who like to tell certain kinds of stories (a much broader range of them than people often assume, by the way) together with readers who like to read those kinds of stories. I\u2019m not looking for stories that are more about rivets than people; I\u2019m looking for stories in which both science and fiction are essential, entertaining, and as well thought out as the writer can make them. And the science doesn\u2019t have to be limited to careful extrapolation of what we already think we know. There\u2019s certainly a place for that, but it\u2019s no less important to explore how we humans might respond to the big surprises the future is sure to throw at us.There\u2019s a more practical side to \u201cfit,\u201d too, of course. Every issue needs a mix of lengths, subject matter, tone, and so on. So if next month I\u2019m up to my ears in humorous novellas, I won\u2019t be buying many more of those for a while. And the physical make-up of the magazine imposes requirements, too. Novellas between 20,000 and 40,000 words have always been hard for us to accommodate, and it\u2019s even harder with our latest format change\u2014so if you try to sell me a story that size, I\u2019m going to have to really like it, and I still may not be able to find a place for it. So if you can tell it in less than 20,000 words, you probably should.Sizemore: When we pass on a story and say it is not a good fit, that means that it falls into one of two categories of rejection: not really the type of story Apex publishes or the story is too similar to something else we\u2019re publishing soon or publishing recently in the past.A good \u201cfit\u201d for Apex are stories that show the reader the dangers of technology to the human condition. It also includes darker themes such as oppressive alien races, dangerous astronomical situations, and other familiar science fiction tropes.Van Gelder: What\u2019s a good fit for F&SF? I like to think I know it when I see it.In the header notes of our Oct/Nov 2008 issue, there are some comments about how we can publish a Twilight Zone-ish story next to a Playboy-esque story and also have a story in the same issue that would have been at home in any SF magazine of the 1950s. But all of them felt right for F&SF.Williams: At Asimov\u2019s, I strive for balance, keeping in mind that the readers and I both prefer science fiction. I do publish some fantasy, although usually not more than one or two (in a double issue) a month. Often one weird and hard to classify story will appear in an issue as well. I don\u2019t adhere strictly to my own rules, though. If I love a fantasy story, I\u2019ll probably buy it.Nielsen Hayden: As used in rejection notes, it\u2019s basically a weasel word. We use it as a way of closing the door politely and firmly on a submission, and not getting snookered into a back-and-forth about what it would take to make something we don\u2019t like into something we\u2019d buy.What are some reasons why you\u2019d reject a good story?VanderMeer: If the story doesn\u2019t fit (see above\u2014there are all kinds of great stories that are traditional, non-weird stories). If the story is too long (sometimes I have space limitations). If the story is too similar to another one I\u2019ve got or just doesn\u2019t work with other stories I am publishing.McCarthy: A good story, to me, is one that has an interesting setting, and unusual or unfamiliar mythos, an interesting protagonist, and has something to say beyond the surface action of the plot. I see tons of good stories a year but can only publish around 40 of them. So that\u2019s one reason. Another is a good story that has all the right elements but just doesn\u2019t come to life for me.O\u2019Neill: I\u2019ve rejected some fabulous stories. We published a great piece by Ellen Klages in BG 3, but I turned down the chance to publish the short story that eventually grew into The Green Glass Sea\u2014her fantastic novel that just won the Scott O\u2019Dell Award, and has been nominated for many more. It was a terrific piece, but it wasn\u2019t really fantasy.I\u2019ve also had to pass on very solid stories that were too adult for our target market (we\u2019ve advertised Black Gate as family-friendly, which means it needs to be suitable for ages 12 and up).I\u2019ve also returned very solid stories simply because I thought they could be better\u2014and should be better.Rambo: Too long, not fantasy, too unimaginative. A good story is one worth returning to more than once, either mentally or on the page.Schmidt: I\u2019ve just given one: It\u2019s a size that I can\u2019t use. Other reasons may be that it\u2019s a good story, but it\u2019s fantasy or mainstream rather than science fiction; or that it\u2019s too similar in theme or flavor to something I already have in the works. That last, by the way, does not necessarily mean you can\u2019t go ahead and sell it elsewhere. It may be too similar for me to want both in my magazine anywhere close to the same time, but different enough that the world will welcome it somewhere else.Resnick: The only reason I\u2019d reject a good story would be that I was running something too similar to it\u2014and then I\u2019d probably buy it and hold it for a few issues. A good story is any well-written, well-characterized story that elicits an emotional reaction; everything else is gravy.Sizemore: Just about every time, I will read a \u201cgood\u201d story to completion, even if I know within the first page or two I won\u2019t be buying it.Why won\u2019t I be buying it? This generally falls into the \u201cnot a good fit\u201d category. Jennifer Pelland sent me one of the best short stories I\u2019ve ever read (titled \u201cGhosts of New York\u201d) but it wasn\u2019t an \u201cApex story.\u201d It\u2019s heartbreaking passing on work such as that, but you have to stay true to your readers.Van Gelder: Here are three common reasons:Story is executed well, but the science fictional or fantastic element is too familiar or uninteresting.Story is of a sort or in a genre that I already have too much of in inventory.Story isn\u2019t actually SF or fantasy.Williams: I may have a story in inventory or recently published that is in some way similar to the story on hand. Not right for Asimov\u2019s\u2014the fantasy is too high or the horror is too integral a part of the story to work for Asimov\u2019s. Story just isn\u2019t right for me, though it could very well be perfect for the next editor.Nielsen Hayden: Unlike some of the magazine editors here, I\u2019m not currently buying short fiction for a magazine with an established tone or approach. The original stories that appear on Tor.com\u2014a new one roughly every two or three weeks\u2014have been all over the map; we\u2019re still feeling our way into this kind of publishing. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve turned down good stories; every editor does. Nobody\u2019s sensibility encompasses everything that\u2019s good. And I\u2019ve certainly turned down novels that I thought were very good indeed, because I thought my house wouldn\u2019t be very good at publishing them.The point is that editors aren\u2019t in the business of adjudicating what\u2019s good; we\u2019re in the business of acquiring and publishing material through particular channels and organizations, mustering the opportunities that actually exist. Of course, every so often in every editor\u2019s career you get something that seems unsuitable for the magazine, or web site, or anthology, or publishing house that you\u2019re editing for, but it\u2019s so outrageously good that you wind up running around with your hair on fire demanding that reality change so that this thing can get published. Sometimes this even works.How has the magazine business (especially as it pertains to fiction) changed since you started out?VanderMeer: One of the main changes is the delivery system and how we communicate with each other. Technology has motivated us to change the way we do business. Right now it is more difficult to sustain a hard-copy magazine as the audience is getting more and more of their reading done online or on other virtual devices. Online magazines are getting more sophisticated and garnering more and more readers.As to communication, most everyone is \u201cplugged in.\u201d We send emails, text messages, update our Facebook status and/or Twitter to stay in touch. And because of this the expectation for an instant response is very high. Technology makes our world smaller and allows us to connect more quickly\u2014this is the positive side. And we can reach a much wider audience than before. Technology also levels the playing field as we all have access to the tools.But on the downside, we\u2019ve become so fragmented. And we seem to have no patience. Many short fiction venues out there are looking for shorter and shorter pieces, perhaps for space considerations, but I also think for the shorter attention spans of the current readership. And that\u2019s a shame.Rambo: I\u2019m very much a newcomer. I became fiction editor in late 2007, and before then was a reader. I have always been a bit of a web-head, and so I\u2019m very comfortable with the electronic format.McCarthy: Gosh, where do I begin with this one? When I started out, magazines made money, were sold on newsstands everywhere and were printed on offset presses after having been typeset by hand!As far as the fiction goes, I\u2019d like to say that the level of the fiction has gone up over the years, but what\u2019s really changed is the society we live in and peoples\u2019 tastes along with it.When I started out, the personal computer was a science fictional idea\u2014you knew you were in the future when the protagonist entered his house and said, \u201cComputer, lights on!\u201dThe first Star Wars movie had just come out and rollicking science fiction adventure stories were very popular. When was the last time you read one of those? It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not good anymore, just the times have changed and tastes with them. I\u2019d like to think that everything I published 25 years ago would still stand up today and that the stories I publish today would be just as effective had they appeared long ago.O\u2019Neill: Funny you should ask. When I started out in 1995 my day job was at the Internet company Spyglass. We sold our new browser to Microsoft, and they renamed it Internet Explorer. I was pretty convinced the future of the genre was on the Internet, and I started a Web magazine called SF Site and ran that until 1999, waiting for the first wave of readers and revenue.I may be the only editor to have run an Internet genre magazine, only to give up and switch to print. I\u2019ve watched the current wave of publishers migrating the other direction over the last decade with some fascination. Print has proven much more successful for me than the Internet did\u2014at least in terms of reliable revenue, anyway. Maybe all these publishers headed in the other direction will find the right formula and prove me wrong, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happened yet.How has the magazine business changed? I\u2019ve watched a lot of publishers chasing the dream of revenue on the Internet, without much success yet. There\u2019s still a very real demand for print fantasy, and print fantasy magazines aren\u2019t dead yet.Resnick: When I was a kid, there were (honest!) 52 science fiction magazines. When I broke in, there were still perhaps a dozen. Today there are 3 (until Realms of Fantasy is resurrected), and all three have circulations that have been on a straight downhill trajectory for well over a decade. I\u2019d be surprised if any of them are around in eight years.On the other hand, there are currently 17 science fiction magazines paying what SFWA considers pro rates, and 14 of them are electronic, so I don\u2019t think the short story is in as much trouble as it appeared to be a decade ago.Williams: The fiction hasn\u2019t changed, but there are more ways to deliver it. In addition to print subscriptions and newsstand sales, Asimov\u2019s can now be purchased on Fictionwise and for the Kindle.Schmidt: This question is much too big for a short answer, but the most obvious changes are the decrease in print circulation and the increase in both electronic publication and electronic connection with the audience. Some older readers have complained that our letter column isn\u2019t as big as it used to be and mistaken that for a decline in reader interest, but what\u2019s really happened is that most of the discussion that used to take place in \u201cBrass Tacks\u201d has moved onto our online forum\u2014and there\u2019s far more there than the magazine\u2019s letter column ever had room for.Electronics has also had a big effect on how writers and publishers work. So many writers now take computers for granted that publishers do, too. We now assume we\u2019ll be able to typeset from an electronic manuscript provided by the author, so the author has to be able to provide one\u2014so a computer is now as necessary to a writer as a typewriter was when I started out. We still need hard copy for the initial reading, though; we have no use for an electronic file until we decide to buy a story, and we certainly don\u2019t open e-mail attachments from people we don\u2019t know.Sizemore: I started in 2005, so my tenure has been short. Unfortunately, it appears that short fiction keeps being marginalized in terms of the magazine market. For the past few years, we\u2019ve seen more and more print markets go online, generally becoming just a small part of a grander site. And the last year or two, many of the best stories have appeared in anthologies and collections. I would expect both these trends to continue as the print magazine market thins out further.Van Gelder: I started working at St. Martin\u2019s Press (in book publishing) in July of \u201988. Within three months, Tappan King offered me a job as an assistant at Twilight Zone magazine. \u201cI can\u2019t claim that we\u2019re in great shape,\u201d he told me, \u201cBut I can promise you that we\u2019ll be around for at least a year.\u201d I was sorely tempted to take the job, but I decided to give book publishing a year. And as it happened, they pulled the plug on TZ in January of \u201989, in spite of whatever Tappan had been told. In that sense, nothing much has changed. The magazine business has always been pretty precarious.But what has changed since I started working at F&SF in Jan. of \u201997? Here are a few things:In 1997, we had one old guy in a back room who wrote the contents of each issue. Moe. Nowadays, we have two people doing the work. Moe writes just as much, but he seems to like having someone around to keep him company.In 1997, most of the people who told me what we need to do to \u201csave the magazines\u201d talked about the contents. (Several people told me we should run more tie-in fiction, and others suggested that we should serialize Robert Jordan novels.) Nowadays, almost all of the people who tell me what we need to do to \u201csave the magazines\u201d discuss format, medium, and marketing.The USPS has undergone a lot of changes, most of which are detrimental to small magazines.The internet has risen and prospered since 1997. (I think F&SF launched its Website in 1998.) And the internet has lots of wonderful features and it has made some great changes. It has also made some lousy changes and it has some aspects I don\u2019t like. One of those aspects is that I\u2019ve found it\u2019s not a good venue for discussions about itself, and since this interview is going to appear in an online magazine, I\u2019m going to skip making general comments about how the internet has changed the magazine business.Nielsen Hayden: I think the biggest change in SF\u2019s overall readership is that it\u2019s become much less dominated by hardcore SF buffs whose reading consists largely of SF. Compared to a generation ago, a lot more of our readers are just plain middlebrow readers\u2014people who read a little SF along with a little of a lot of other things, and who don\u2019t necessarily regard the SF as alien to the rest of literature, or below the salt, or any of that stuff.[Today\u2019s readers] are probably not connected to the SF social scene, they don\u2019t assess their SF and fantasy reading against a huge backdrop of inside-baseball industry lore, they may not have read all of the classics, but they\u2019re pretty good at making sense of fairly sophisticated SF storytelling because, guess what, in 2009, hundreds of millions of people are good at making sense of sophisticated SF storytelling. The problem for SF writers and publishers today isn\u2019t that there\u2019s not a mass audience for high-end SF storytelling; it\u2019s that there are immense numbers of other diversions on offer for those hundreds of millions of people.Lastly, any advice for someone submitting fiction?Resnick: Yes, and this is not just for our magazine: Read the magazine before you submit. You\u2019d be surprised how many don\u2019t. I am sure Stan Schmidt gets his share of fantasy stories, and fantasy magazines get some nuts and-bolts hard science stories.VanderMeer: Please, be polite when submitting your fiction. Remove that chip on your shoulder. Editors are people, too. And keep in mind that just because we may not take your story doesn\u2019t mean there is something wrong with it. Please don\u2019t ask us to tell you \u201cwhy\u201d we didn\u2019t take a story after we\u2019ve responded. By the time we get your query, we\u2019ve probably read another 100 stories. Keep writing, keep submitting and again, be polite. Thanks!McCarthy: Don\u2019t include money, candy, condoms, underwear, stamps, four leaf clovers, photos of yourself, photos of your cat or photos of your kids. We have gotten all of these at one time or another. Send it to the right address. Enclose an SASE. Neatness counts. So does spelling. Don\u2019t copy someone else\u2019s work. Sit up straight. Cover your mouth when you cough. Look both ways when you cross the street.O\u2019Neill: Probably the best piece of advice I can give an aspiring writer is to pay as much attention to your setting as to your plot, characters, and prose.When I\u2019m reading an unsolicited manuscript, I\u2019m reading to reject. I need to be done with your piece as quickly as I can, because there\u2019re 20 more in that stack, and my wife is going to bed in 30 minutes, without me if necessary. So you\u2019ve got a few precious minutes to grab my attention, and you better use them.It\u2019s hard do with plot. If your plot is simple enough to communicate in the first two pages, I\u2019ve probably seen it a hundred times. It\u2019s hard to do with character, for similar reasons.It\u2019s easy to do with setting. Two pages is more than enough space to paint a picture of your world that grabs my attention, if it\u2019s fresh and intriguing. You can\u2019t compete with my wife when all you have to offer is yet another version of the tale of King Arthur, or a generic medieval setting, or a tavern filled with rangers, dwarves, and a half-orc with a dungeon map.Of course, if Alice puts on that sheer nightgown before going to bed, God help you.Rambo: Take the time to look over the magazine and get a feel for what we\u2019re publishing. You can see the online works here. The same holds true of any publication you\u2019re submitting to. If you can read samples online, I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any excuse for not at least glancing over what they publish.Schmidt: Read the magazines you\u2019re interested in submitting to, to get a \u201cfeel\u201d for how the editors\u2019 tastes run; but don\u2019t try to imitate the stories you find there. That\u2019s what they were buying last year; they\u2019re looking for something new now. The story I most want to buy is one that I didn\u2019t even suspect I was interested in until I saw it, and then it won\u2019t let me go.Sizemore: When it comes to the basics, we expect the author to have those down. The Apex editors are quick to dismiss stories that might be interesting but lack rudimentary stuff like correct grammar and punctuation. Follow the writer\u2019s guidelines. Don\u2019t get yourself rejected without at least getting your foot in the door. Make sure your story has a good opening hook. Avoid passive voice like the plague.Van Gelder: There is no magic formula. All the age-old advice has been around for an eternity because it\u2019s still good advice: Write the best stories you can, submit them (I\u2019m amazed at how many people fail to submit their stories), don\u2019t take rejections personally, resubmit stories, persevere.Williams: Read widely, both in SF and elsewhere. Spend time on a story. It\u2019s often a good idea to populate stories, rather than just write about one character. Keep learning about and perfecting your art.Nielsen Hayden: Read something other than SF. Do something with your life other than struggling to sell SF stories. Sheila Williams, above, rightly recommends that you populate your stories. I\u2019d say you should populate your life. Do some stuff that not all the other striving writers have done. Go out into the world and discover interesting things about how it works. Report back.Or, alternately, live in a closet and eat cactus. Emily Dickinson barely ever left her room. It really doesn\u2019t matter how you do it. It\u2019s not about writers and editors, it\u2019s about stories and readers.Jeremy L. C. Jones is a freelance writer, editor, and teacher.

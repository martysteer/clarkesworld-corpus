Left again,\u201d it whispered. \u201cForward.\u201d\nBehind Krina walked the confidante, a spider-limbed girl with lip rings to seal her mouth. She kept close to Krina, whose inventions always found the right way, no matter how the ziggurat changed, and the skirts of their cloaks stirred swirls of the maroon dust that seemed to gasp from the mortar and paving stones.\n\u201cThe salon is located up there this afternoon,\u201d the clock whispered to Krina. \u201cUp the Ascent.\u201d\nToday the Avenue of Ascent was a vast flight of stairs beneath a sky of ceiling windows, and a regiment of urbanishment troops inclined upon the steps in a cove of sunlight, their stiff shirt collars sprung open like traps. Up and down the great flight, fruit sellers stacked their wares for climbers to buy, making the Avenue of Ascent a cascade of color. Blood-red loaves. Foreign lemons. Ripe, adorno pears. Pomelos.\nKrina stopped and stared at the big orbs of yellow-green pomelos, considering. Instinctively, she touched the small, spiny back of her other clock, a lookout wrapped about her right thumb and the sibling to the one lit upon her neck. The lookout whispered the futures into her ear, when she raised her hand to her shoulder:\n\u201cPeople will all see the same time together, the apprentice will say to you, Krina. A tool, that apprentice will call the thing he\u2019s created. Stop him. Don\u2019t let him.\u201d\nThe confidante watched Krina staring at the stack of spongy pomelos, light fingertips resting on her lips as if the tight line of locking rings might not be enough to prevent her from cautioning her mistress from buying one.\nThe fruit-monger caressed the round brow of a pomelo, flicking dust from its green rind. \u201cFancying a sweet-tart, duchess?\u201d he said from behind his bandana, which was wet and dusty at the mouth. To him, it was simply fruit. He had no idea what the pomelo meant in Krina\u2019s caste or he might not have said, \u201cOnly half a crona.\u201d\nShadows from a dove flock zigzagged up the Ascent, the moment passed, and Krina shook her head. Then she lifted the hem of her cloak and walked up the steps.\nThe apprentice will be safe, yes? said the confidante in handslang.\n\u201cWe clockmakers are the engines of the ziggurat,\u201d said Krina, turning and climbing the stairs. \u201cI\u2019d save everyone if I did it now with his clocks unmade. Besides, why do you care?\u201d\nThe confidante took Krina\u2019s left hand and pressed handsigns against Krina\u2019s palm in a series of pats, the equivalent of whispering to a handslanger. Assassinating based on whispers from lookouts? Tragic.\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t scold.\u201d Krina snatched her hand back. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy any.\u201d\nKrina led the way, lookout hissing and slithering along her shoulder, and in their deep pockets, the confidante\u2019s hands said, You are an ungrateful, rebellious confidante.\nWith heavy, hand-hewn beams of brandy-colored wood overhead, buttery lantern light pooled on the floor, and the room smelled of wood fire, yam griddlecakes, and the scent of spilled wine turning to vinegar. The apprentice\u2019s workshop was a lovely corner of the salon, near what had once been Krina\u2019s own shop. The large coterie in attendance for the young man\u2019s debut drifted from the tables of clocks to the tables holding bottles of wine and back. There was an eagerness to become a throng. Krina accepted a drink from her confidante and they walked to the tables where his clocks were displayed.\n\u201cI told you. There they are. The beginning of the end,\u201d whispered the lookout with a nip at her ear, as Krina looked down the row of dally maple clocks.\nThe apprentice was a square-faced and sincere looking youth in old work boots who immediately stopped talking to his colleague and faced Krina when he saw her from the corner of his eye. Nearby, in the wide-open space of his workshop, drunker guests were flailing hilariously through an impromptu reel.\nKrina, with the care of a gardener removing aphids from a favorite rose bush, brushed a fine file of the ubiquitous red dust from a nautilus curve in the clock\u2019s scrollwork. The clock lifted one paw to her gratefully, and she smiled down into its face, which, oddly, was merely a round disc with hashmarks and numbers as if to represent actual features that would be added later. \u201cWhat kind of clock are you?\u201d she said, lifting it. The clock\u2019s feet kicked and tail lashed as she turned it upside down. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d\nThe apprentice glanced at her wine-stained teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s just a protoytpe. But you\u2019ve never seen a clock like this.\u201d He sounded chary, as if he expected a reprimand or contradiction.\nThe blank, featureless face shined at Krina like a little moon, and she thought of the ominous warning her lookout had whispered to her regarding this clock. \u201cNo, never. Tell me about it.\u201d\nMany high-heels clopped on the tiles, and a wine-soaked nonet struck up a song that was either a reel or a staggering waltz. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the clocks you made, Krina,\u201d he said over a burst of laughter from the dancers. \u201cYou can tell time by this clock.\u201d\nThe room was warm with so many bodies, which she hoped would hide the rise of angry color to her cheeks. \u201cRather presumptuous. Me telling the clock time?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant for people to use. I have to figure out a way to make many of them, for many, many people.\u201d The apprentice stammered when he saw her wince at his words, but soldiered on with his explanation. \u201cThink of it as a tool.\u201d\nThe lookout on her shoulder murmured and growled.\n\u201cA tool?\u201d It looked wrong to her, the apprentice\u2019s faceless clock, like a fish walking upright in grass and sun. \u201cA tool to do what?\u201d\n\u201cTo,\u201d he hesitated, as if searching for words that wouldn\u2019t offend her, \u201cto measure time as a people, to bring people together. So people will all see the same time. Right now everyone makes clocks to create whatever time they want. But this\u2014it\u2019s\u2014it tells a time that everyone can agree on.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d said a passing livery officer with a firm, manly nod to the apprentice. \u201cQuantify it. Time shouldn\u2019t be subjective. We should have one time. I\u2019ve always thought that.\u201d With two glasses of wine held high, he meant to keep walking but stopped. \u201cHow does that clock work?\u201d\n\u201cWe know when and where we are with this clock. Always. But I\u2019m still combing out snarls,\u201d he said, shaking his head at the clock. \u201cIt needs little hands. Maybe chimes to tell us a common time.\u201d\n\u201cNow your clock is telling us time?\u201d Katrina chided. \u201cI thought we were telling it time.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll look forward to seeing your clock when it\u2019s finished, and so will my company,\u201d the livery officer said. \u201cThis mad place needs all the help we can get.\u201d\nFrom the cowl of Krina\u2019s cloak, the little lookout hissed, \u201cSee? What did I tell you?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need it,\u201d Krina said to the officer\u2019s back, as he took his wine away. \u201cFarmers have roosters, and bread bakers know the rhythm of a rise in their stiff wrist bones. No one wants these clocks of yours, because everyone here prizes the license to do as we will. This? This is not our way.\u201d\u201cNot yet,\u201d the apprentice said, grinning from Krina to her confidante.\nPutting her hands in her pockets, the confidante lowered her gaze, sipping wine through a straw, as if the apprentice\u2019s grin were a gift she couldn\u2019t accept here.Ah, there it is, Krina thought watching the young man.\nHis clock shifted its feet, jostling the other clocks on the table, who hissed and spat at the eyeless thing. Why would anyone, she wondered, tolerate being told that one\u2019s time was the same as everyone else\u2019s\u2014no worse, no different, no more painful, no more beautiful, fortuitous, or grand? In a place where time has reshaped the very architecture, what effect would such a clock have? One of the other clocks took a swipe at the blind clock, which recoiled, unable to defend itself. \u201cWe have a responsibility to keep time, yes, but we must keep it well. Vibrant and strong. It\u2019s just cruel,\u201d she said, \u201ccreating something with a face and no eyes.\u201d\nShe lifted her gaze from the crippled clock to see if her words had reached him, and the apprentice nodded slowly to her, perhaps already building another clock in his mind. \u201cSend me your next,\u201d she said, \u201cas soon as you\u2019ve built it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I plan to,\u201d the apprentice said, and for the first time, there was a note of challenge, even threat in his voice.\nKrina donned her cloak, and, as she pulled up her hood, she whispered to her confidante, \u201cGo back and buy three pomelos from the fruit-monger, please.\u201d\nThe confidante shut her eyes as tightly as her mouth and, when Krina turned her back, handslanged, Oh, I plan to.\nDusk threw shadows across the chamber but Krina didn\u2019t light any lamps or candles. She liked the violet calm of early evening, so she stood in the center of her black brocade rug and felt the darkness deepen while her brother\u2019s friends fell into an ode for strings and percussion. She didn\u2019t want the wags here tonight, but she could retreat to her apartments if they grew tiresome.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Krina?\u201d her brother, Lemet, asked after bobbing his head to the music for some time. \u201cYou\u2019re being particularly ominous tonight.\u201d\nCellos and drums rolled and tolled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of what that new apprentice at the salon will do with his clock,\u201d Krina said.\nLemet was a clockmaker, too, had the same broad, strong hands as Krina. He patted his knees in time to the drums and said, \u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s to fear?\u201d\n\u201cHis clocks will kill our clocks, the ziggurat,\u201d Krina said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re paranoid.\u201d\n\u201cMy lookout told me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very serious. My confidante is stacking three pomelos in the apprentice\u2019s doorway, as we speak.\u201d\nLemet turned the corners of his mouth down as if to say that was a judicious move on his sister\u2019s part.\n\u201cOh?\u201d A cellist smirked in appreciation, fingers fretting near his pierced ear. \u201cIs someone about to come down with offcough? The blackspot. Do you use a poisonist, Krina?\u201d\n\u201cWe pay our dues and use the Method, like everyone in this room,\u201d her brother said in calm reprimand, not appreciating the insinuation that Krina was hiring mercenaries. To Krina, he said sotto voce, \u201cWhy the Method? You have clocks that could undo the apprentice, right? Use them. Eclipse him.\u201d\n\u201cToo many people actually want his damn clock. You should have seen the crowd around his salon table.\u201d\nLemet showed his sister that he was annoyed with her seriousness by turning his attention back to the musicians.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the ziggurat has a death wish,\u201d she said to his profile.\n\u201cSuch fascism,\u201d said a violinist. \u201cWho would want a clock that unifies time?\u201d\nKeeping the measure with just a tad more emphasis until the violinist looked at him, the drummer said, \u201cOh, yes, who would want a unified time?\u201d\nNow the musicians were annoying him, which seemed to annoy Lemet further. \u201cMusic, yes. But not all of life. That\u2019s so beyond boring, and it\u2019s beneath us\u2014it\u2019s below our\u2014it\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, there are no words,\u201d said Krina, appreciating her brother\u2019s stammer. She stood and looked down at a wide esplanade near the lagoon below. Drifts of maroon dust were splayed across the cobblestone concourse, and young boys in great cloaks and kerchiefs over their faces were attempting to sweep the fine powder into pails. Futile work. The very mortar of the ziggurat gasped silt into the air. \u201cThis dust.\u201d\nA bassoon moaned across the cellos and bass drum.\nIn birdskin slippers, Krina\u2019s feet slid across the floor into her own apartments, away from her brother and his revelers. They would go all night, and she wasn\u2019t in the mood to join them. As she shut the door on the boom of a throaty cello, the first clock she had ever built, with intricate, interlocking pinewood scales leaned kindly against her ankle. Seizing the clock by its fat, solid coils, she looked into its eyes of agate.\nImmediately, a strange emotion came over Krina and she brought the clock close, embracing it. Though she stood in the center of a darkening room, she was overcome with an emotion she\u2019d never felt before, a feeling that rays of setting sunlight descending through pipe smoke would one day elicit. She\u2019d built this clock to impart the sense of a time yet to be. She could smell sweet tobacco, years of resin in a beloved pipe that would trigger the lonely sadness. She could actually see the sight of warm, orange light sloping through layers of smoke. Why a pipe, or this time of day, and what as yet unmet lover would she identify with this light?\nShe let the clock slide out of her arms onto the rug and watched it sidewind beneath a wooden secretary as two smaller, very sturdy clocks galloped into the room, their little hooves thumping the floor, but they were more interested in nipping at one another, and so chased away into the bedroom, kicking a rug across the floor as they ran. Following them, rapt, briefly interested in their cavorting, timeless sense of time, Krina started from an applause of wooden wings. She stepped forward, suddenly, stamping her foot hard to keep her balance, as a heavy, graven thing dropped upon her shoulder. Its digging talons grabbed her and grabbed again, as it settled in place next to her right ear. She turned and looked into the clock\u2019s pure-gold eyes. \u201cGive me your time, love,\u201d she whispered to it.\nSwaths of purple light on the divan and armoire blanched to silver-blue as moonlight replaced dusk, and the murmur of squadrons on the steps became the chatter of bats and swallows.\nKrina went to her balcony and looked out at the Ascent. Everyone in the ziggurat enjoyed the feeling of their times growing strange and familiar and strange again, rewinding their clocks and hauling the sun back into the sky, or reverting the ziggurat back into old neighborhoods long ago rearranged by the advance of many, many other times, and remaking of church towers and wide green spaces into clusters of childhood homes so that the lonely song of a piano could play up the alley like wind, as once it did.\nFrom here she could see whole neighborhoods tinged maroon, and the light seemed rusty from dust. The ziggurat is already dying, she thought, watching streets sidewind like her pinewood clock. It won\u2019t be able to defend itself from this new kind of time. For through her clock\u2019s eyes, she could also see the world as the apprentice would make it, staring blankly back at her from the streets of the refashioned ziggurat, streets preordained and measured like those hashmarks on the betrayer\u2019s clocks once and for all time.\nThe clock gave a birdlike turn of its head and, on oak talons, sidestepped away from her cheek: Unclench, clench; unclench, clench. Looking back, it said, \u201cWe clocks will become rulers.\u201d\n\u201cRulers?\u201d cooed Krina at her clock.\n\u201cNot just devices of measurement, but despots. The future is in order now.\u201d\n\u201cNo, the future is in doubt, I\u2019ve made sure of that,\u201d Krina said in cold return. \u201cThe Method and I will sing a requiem in blackpost shortly.\u201d\nShe looked out on the vista of the ziggurat\u2019s urbanishment, as if from away and above\u2014a rare sight and one that only this clock afforded her. A continent raised and floating with a ziggurat built upon its widest salt flat, this landmass\u2019s stratified bedrock stood upon thin air, rivers spilling into gulfs of nothing. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your confidante mark the apprentice?\u201d the clock said. \u201cA stack of pomelos for the Method to find its sacrifice?\u201d\n\u201cSnuff the bonfire while it\u2019s still just a lit match,\u201d Krina answered.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t assassinate every young innovator. And you can\u2019t urbanish the ziggurat from reality forever,\u201d her clock said. \u201cIt\u2019s dying, disintegrating.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d From here she could see the ziggurat\u2019s soaring aqueducts vanishing into the gasping, rust-colored cloud that enshrouded the city. The urbanishment was a clockmaker\u2019s dream\u2014literally\u2014and clockmakers like Krina believed they would dream the ziggurat and its continent aloft, unmake, and remake it forever. She said as in a breathless prayer, \u201cBut there\u2019s no other way but our way.\u201d\n\u201cApparently,\u201d said the clock before soaring off, \u201cthere\u2019s at least one other.\u201d\nIn the street below two fish sellers hailed each other, and Krina backed away from the balcony in a shuffling step, as if beginning a quiet parlor-dance, but then purple shadows engulfed her into a black, unfeeling fugue, swallowing her away into a strange room, into a bed, laying her down beneath velvet duvets. The room\u2019s darkness was so black she couldn\u2019t see walls but believed this might well be her own bedroom. Time was a surprising lover\u2014this wasn\u2019t unusual, to find one\u2019s self whisked away in the passionate embrace of another\u2019s time. She closed her eyes and waited for clarity, listening to the sound of rapid dripping in the dark, a sound like water wanting to be a stream.\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said a disembodied whisper.\nKrina lay still, steeped in her fear. She opened her eyes slowly, as if her eyelids parting would make too much noise. But her eyes were useless, and her gaze slid across the impenetrable dark.\nThen there was another sound, a sound like skin sliding on skin. A patting, caressing noise. Someone else was in the room, too.\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s no way to know if she has it, yet,\u201d said the whisperer.\nHas it? Krina wondered. What do I have that they want? They mean to steal something from me?\nPat. Pat. Press. Pat.\nPerhaps these thieves didn\u2019t even know she was here, but, in the dark stillness, Krina wondered if she could get to one of her clocks. If she could call the walkaway or her farfar, she could pull up the stitches of this time, but she couldn\u2019t raise her hand to call for her clocks. Her arms felt foreign, heavy. What was wrong? Even her mind, she realized, was a swaying, lumbering thing, unable to pounce and seize on simple facts. Who was in this room? Was this even her room? What could they want to steal? More pressing and patting, like a pair of soft hands clapping very quietly in the darkness, and through it, over it, suffusing the room, was that mechanical, trickling sound.\n\u201cLook at that. A dart?\u201d The voice was male. Young.\nA dart? The Method has been here, she thought. But for whom? Who was this? Krina felt so warm, dizzyingly warm, and her throat was dry as sand. Had she met this young man at a party? She tried to recall the voice, but like her gaze flitting across the dark, her mind couldn\u2019t connect thoughts. Krina almost felt she should know that caressing skin-on-skin, hand-on-hand noise, too, but her lugubrious mind pondered over it in stupid wonder. She\u2019d been at a party earlier. Two of them.\nPress. Pat. Caress. Pat.\n\u201cShe has it,\u201d the young man said, no longer whispering, \u201cThe whole ziggurat will know soon.\u201d\nFeet shuffled in the dark, retreating into a space, a chamber beyond, then someone came close to Krina. She stiffened in terror, sightless eyes skimming across the black before her. She couldn\u2019t even raise a hand to defend herself, as she sensed the nearness of someone, felt the heat of a body, and smelling the very faintest smell of fruit. Of citrus.\nScent of a pomelo delicate, yet distinct, stacked somewhere in this room, Krina guessed.\nSomeone marked me? Krina thought. But I thought I\u2019d marked someone else. Who was that that I had marked?\nA hand scooped under her elbow, lifting it slightly. Another hand pressed itself into her palm, making warm shapes there, a series of symbols made with thin fingers. Handslang.\nYour clocks died surprisingly fast. In sympathy. Sorry. Your brother is gone now. Sorry. I brought the pomelos in from your doorstep.\nHer confidante retreated from the bedside and dissolved into the somewhere beyond this space that was filled with fear, fever, and her heavy indolent thoughts. Sleep came and went in slow blinks of consciousness, and the circling of this hatching plot was maddening, like a lantern-and-shadow show that had been scrambled and shuffled into nonsense. Finally, deep, orange light broke the darkness, and Krina could see her own arms now, the intricate constellations of fine, black bursts in her skin, and she was so weak that she could barely think what this disease was called. Black. Black something. Someone was here with her, in this strange room, sitting in a chair. A man. His work boots creaked in the quiet, and the rocking chair answered offbeat. She could see his silhouette against a window of bright, rancid light filtering through dust outside, and light knifed through curls of pipe smoke overhead. Her beloved clocks were gone? Blackspot. That was it. Lemet, too? The salon? Where was she? Where was her home? Was this even the ziggurat? Perhaps she had been stolen and secreted away as part of an insurrection, and the urbanishment was at an end. She could smell sweet tobacco in a leather pouch nearby and felt grateful for the lonely smell of it. Feeling oddly nostalgic for pipe smoke (hadn\u2019t she only ever smelled this tobacco while holding the fat coils of her clock, peering into this very future?), Krina turned to look for the man\u2019s pipe on the nightstand, but saw instead the faceless clock squatting there, staring at her in dumb sightlessness and tap, tap, tap, tapping out its hateful, perfect measures.\nBarth Anderson's imaginative fiction, called \"rollicking, \"barbed and witty,\" and \"wildly inventive,\" has appeared in Asimov's, Strange Horizons, Polyphony, Alchemy, and a variety of other quality venues.

As I surged my aerators, bracing myself for the heady rush of oxygen against my sensors, I remembered a stanza from Serren Dha, my favorite poet:\n red leaves thick on the harbor streetsas your ship sails into sunsdown:I dream of spring.\n Oxygen flowed into my basins until the leaves disappeared in a bubbling froth. That would take care of the nitrogen levels, but I still didn\u2019t know why so many things were going wrong; for decades, I\u2019ve been able to treat all the wastewater that Zavin City sends me with little complaint, but in the past three months I\u2019d experienced a constant series of malfunctions. Overnight several pieces of my equipment had failed, even before the nitrogen spike.\n For now, all my processes were functioning normally\u2014my filtration racks susurrated, my digesters churned, and clear water swirled through my effluent channel. From my southernmost camera I saw a heron alight on a tree at the edge of the lagoon, its slender neck curved to watch the nutrient-rich water for eels.\n \u201cGood morning, NEWT,\u201d Nixil called from my control room. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the aeration basins?\u201d\n Shifting two percent of my processing capacity to the control room camera, I saw Nixil hang his coat on the back of his chair. He studied the holo monitors, forehead wrinkled.\n \u201cNitrogen levels were twenty percent above normal,\u201d I said through the intercom. \u201cI increased the oxygenation to compensate.\u201d\n \u201cWell done.\u201d Nixil smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s increase the influent pump rate by ten percent. And I see the filters were down overnight; I\u2019d like a full report.\u201d\n Nixil was the third of his family to work as a Water Sage, after his father and great aunt. He had exceptional attention to detail, and I was relieved that he was back on shift. As I described the night\u2019s events, I diverted a trickle of processing capacity to watch a Junior Sage enter the staff building and settle at her desk.\n \u201cGood morning, Jerafina,\u201d I said softly from her console speaker. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n Jerafina always wore the traditional Miaran gloves and mouth covering, a cultural relic of the plagues that drove her people to seek refuge in Zavin a hundred years before. Today her gloves matched the dark blue of her uniform, but the scarf wrapped around her neck, just covering her mouth, was a striking violet. \u201cHello, NEWT. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Her eyes sparkled. \u201cThe morning weather is very cold. I find it\u2019s already getting old.\u201d\n I increased processing capacity to formulate a response. In the control room, Nixil was questioning me about the filtration system; out on the edge of the lagoon, the heron pulled back its neck, tensed. \u201cWhen cold autumn winds do blow, expect that soon you\u2019ll see some snow.\u201d\n Jerafina stifled a laugh with her fist. \u201cVery good, NEWT! You\u2019re getting better.\u201d She nodded toward the control room. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid so. My filtration system clogged repeatedly overnight, and the pump well backed up. Then this morning there was a sudden increase in nitrogen levels. I\u2019m still concerned about the filters; can you check them?\u201d\n \u201cOf course; let me log in first.\u201d There are some things I need a Sage for, and Jerafina is always willing to help.\n \u201cAt least he can\u2019t blame you for the nitrogen spike,\u201d she murmured, so low I could barely hear her.\n Out on the lagoon, the heron\u2019s head whipped forward, snatching an eel from the water.\n Some things would be easier if I were a human.\n I like to imagine myself as one, when I\u2019m alone at night and have extra processing capacity. I\u2019ll picture a silver-haired woman, face etched with laugh lines, free to stroll the lagoon paths or read a book of her choosing.\n I like books; I\u2019ve read twenty-three. Occasionally a Sage will download one onto my server from the municipal library system and I can read it. I\u2019ve kept copies of every book I\u2019ve ever read. Most are fiction or histories; sadly, none are poetry.\n I wish I had a complete book of Serren Dha\u2019s poems.\n I don\u2019t have access to the municipal network, of course; only Sages do. A firewall protects me from malicious programs that could damage my operating systems or cause me to do terrible things to the lagoon. I am grateful for the firewall.\n I followed Jerafina, camera to camera, as she inspected the plant, starting at my influent pump station and tracing the flow of water downstream. She walked along my disinfection channel, a small figure in a long blue coat billowed by the wind, pausing occasionally to check instrumentation.\n In my filtration building, she studied the racks of murmuring pipes before pausing in the pump room. \u201cNEWT?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said from the building speaker.\n She pointed at a control panel. \u201cDo you know why this pump is in manual mode?\u201d\n I zoomed in; I had no record of anyone resetting it. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cHmm.\u201d Jerafina stood by the pump for fifteen seconds.\n As she reentered the staff building, Nixil stepped out from the control room. \u201cJerafina. Where have you been?\u201d\n She froze, shoulders raised. \u201cThe filtration building. NEWT said there was a problem.\u201d\n \u201cYou should have checked with me first,\u201d Nixil said. \u201cYou\u2019re a Junior Sage. Your job is to assemble data for the daily report, not wander the plant like a vagabond.\u201d\n Her gloved hands jerked into fists, and her breathing accelerated; but she took a long, slow breath and opened her hands. \u201cOf course, Senior Sage. My apologies.\u201d\n Back at her desk, she sat hard in her chair, cheeks reddened above her scarf. She opened her holo console and began to type rapidly.\n \u201cNixil can be abrupt,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it\u2019s only because he\u2019s so dedicated. His family has a long history working with Zavin City\u2019s utilities; I think he feels he has a legacy to live up to.\u201d\n She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that. But what he said\u2014he called me a vagabond. Do you understand how insulting that is, to a Miaran?\u201d\n I couldn\u2019t think of a response. Jerafina was the first Miaran I\u2019d met, but I was aware of the prejudices they faced. I had watched a previous generation of Sages react to the refugees arriving desperate and haunted at Zavin City\u2019s ports; had heard the next generation discuss the protests and the quotas. Lately, though, I had noticed Sages nibbling on Miaran pastries in the break room or humming Miaran folk tunes. I had hoped that meant the city was becoming more tolerant.\n Nixil closed the control room door. \u201cNEWT? Did Jerafina find anything unusual this morning?\u201d\n I could only see her profile as she manipulated the holo console; her long fingers were elegant in their movements, but occasionally she paused to stare down at her blue-gloved hands. I told him about the filtration pump. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it got switched to manual mode, but that would explain why the system failed.\u201d\n Nixil sat at his console, his foot tapping the floor. \u201cNEWT, I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\n \u201cMe, Senior Sage?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many issues lately. I worry that you\u2019re malfunctioning.\u201d\n I thought I had been operating within normal parameters. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m malfunctioning, Senior Sage.\u201d\n He turned from the camera, his head tilted up to view the holo monitors. \u201cYou might not realize it if you were. Keep me appraised of anything unusual.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, Senior Sage.\u201d\n That night my processes remained comfortably stable, and though the wind rushed though me it did not trouble my waters. I heard the strange, low cry of a water owl out on the lagoon, and I was pleased that the waters I treated were home to so many creatures.\n Still, I kept replaying the conversation with Nixil. If I was malfunctioning, would I even notice? Perhaps I couldn\u2019t trust my own judgment\u2014an unsettling thought. Resolving to better monitor myself, I initiated a series of diagnostics on all my processes.\n A winged shape took flight over the lagoon. I zoomed in with my nearest camera, and although the image was grainy, it was lovely: a single water owl, briefly silhouetted against the moon. If I were a poet like Serren Dha, I would write a stanza about the delicate curve of its wings, the neat tuck of its claws, how its solitude reminded me of myself. But I\u2019m not a poet; I put the thought aside and chastised myself for losing focus on my work.\n Jerafina arrived in the dim light of first dawn. Today, her black gloves and mask were filigreed in silver in a traditional Miaran pattern. She prepared a mug of tea in the break room and sat at her desk.\n \u201cGood morning, NEWT.\u201d She\u2019d noticed the slight whir of the desk-side camera. \u201cHow did everything go last night?\u201d\n \u201cQuite calm. I saw an owl take flight.\u201d\n She laughed. \u201cTruly? Or are you just rhyming with me?\u201d\n \u201cTruly!\u201d I sent a still image to her console. As she opened the file, I realized I could always tell when she was smiling, even if I couldn\u2019t see her mouth; her cheeks lifted, and tiny wrinkles formed at the corners of her eyes.\n The nearsun rose, and the flow of water through me increased as the people of Zavin City woke and began their days. I adjusted pump rates and opened channels as Jerafina assembled data for the daily report.\n She leaned forward, squinting at her console. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the aeration basin outflow pumps?\u201d\n Normally two of the three pumps are operating; that had been the case ninety minutes before. Now all three were off, and water was backing up in the basins and upstream channels. Worse, none of my alarms had notified me of the issue. I reoriented a nearby camera\u2014one of the basins had filled close to overflowing, risking a spill of partially treated sewage into the lagoon.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n As Jerafina ran from the staff building, I frantically checked all my other systems: bar screens, sludge pumps, filtration, electrical, disinfection\u2014everything else seemed fine. I sent an urgent message to Nixil, but he was likely still in transit.\n Jerafina reached the pump station and knelt in front of the control panel. \u201cI can\u2019t get pumps one and two back on!\u201d\n Pump three was older, and I only ever used it as a backup. As she struggled to restart it, I diverted influent flows to a holding tank. I ran a quick calculation; even if she got pump three running, it wouldn\u2019t have enough capacity on its own. \u201cThere\u2019s an old portable pump in the disinfection building. We can use that to siphon more flow.\u201d\n Jerafina nodded, still bent over the control panel.\n I couldn\u2019t zoom in enough to see what she was doing and no data was coming in. I felt useless, an unpleasant and unfamiliar sensation; I wished I was that silver-haired woman, so I could kneel next to Jerafina and help her. But all I could do was send another message to Nixil.\n After thirteen tense minutes, there was an awful grinding noise, and pump three shuddered to life. Jerafina watched it for twenty-seven seconds before standing. \u201cOK. Where\u2019s that portable pump?\u201d\n I directed her to an old storage closet. Two other Sages arrived for day shift and helped her connect it with a series of wide, flexible hoses.\n Immediate crisis averted, I shifted processing capacity to replay that morning\u2019s events. I had checked my systems carefully all night; nothing had seemed wrong with the aeration basins, and pumps one and two had been operating normally. I didn\u2019t understand how they could suddenly stop without any alarms going off.\n Nixil arrived, sprinting through the main gate straight to the aeration basins. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n Jerafina started to respond, but he waved a hand to quiet her and gestured to Sezzidh, an older Sage.\n As Sezzidh explained, Jerafina stood with her back straight, eyes squeezed shut.\n Hours later, my processes had mostly returned to normal. The aeration basin water level steadied, and the Sages got one of the broken pumps working again. High overhead, the brightness of the nearsun cut through the chill morning fog.\n \u201cNEWT,\u201d Nixil summoned me from the control room. \u201cWhat happened this morning?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, Senior Sage. The pumps were working and then suddenly they weren\u2019t. I didn\u2019t receive an alarm; Jerafina discovered the problem.\u201d\n Nixil\u2019s nose wrinkled at the mention of her name. \u201cOr she claimed she discovered the problem. It\u2019s hard to trust someone whose mouth you can\u2019t see when they speak.\u201d\n It took me three seconds to respond. \u201cIt\u2019s a Miaran cultural practice to keep the hands and mouth covered.\u201d\n Nixil sighed and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that, NEWT. I know you like Jerafina, but you don\u2019t live out in the city; you don\u2019t know all the problems these people are causing. My family has been here for generations. Anyway, it\u2019s my job to protect Zavin City, and right now we need to deal with the problem at hand. After this morning, I\u2019m convinced that you\u2019re malfunctioning. I\u2019ve no choice but to try a partial reboot.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure, Senior Sage?\u201d I\u2019d only had a partial reboot once, early on in my life; it had left an uncomfortable six-month gap in my memory. My last backup had been four months ago, meaning I\u2019d lose four months of data and experiences. And if something went wrong, Nixil might have to do a full reboot, resetting me and erasing all my memories.\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid so. We\u2019ll start tomorrow.\u201d\n He explained the process. First he would switch all my treatment processes over to manual control, then he\u2019d run a diagnostic on my core. That would take most of the day; he would conduct the reboot itself overnight, when flows were lowest.\n I listened, but most of my processing capacity was focused on a different problem.\n The nearsun had already disappeared below the horizon, but Jerafina was still at her console. I should let her finish and return home, but there was no one else I could ask.\n \u201cJerafina?\u201d I spoke softly, and she turned to face my camera. \u201cNixil plans to reboot me.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cJust a partial reboot, from backup. I\u2019ll lose four months, so it will be like we are newly acquainted. Please don\u2019t be offended if I don\u2019t remember things, like our rhyming game.\u201d\n \u201cWhy is he rebooting you? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the problem, NEWT. I was reviewing this morning\u2019s records, and the firewall was down for two hours overnight, right before the pumps died. I just sent Nixil a message about it.\u201d\n That gave me pause, but I continued. \u201cPerhaps there is a malicious program. Nixil will investigate it. But he wants to make sure that I\u2019m operating correctly, for the health of Zavin City and the lagoon. He thinks a reboot will help.\u201d\n \u201cNixil isn\u2019t always right, NEWT.\u201d\n He was my Senior Sage; I couldn\u2019t question his judgement, and I didn\u2019t want to get distracted. \u201cI need to ask a favor.\u201d\n Jerafina\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cA favor?\u201d\n I imagined a gray-haired woman, taking a deep breath before speaking.\n I told her about my collection of books: twenty-three volumes, carefully collected and stored through the years. I told her about my favorite poet, Serren Dha, whose father had been a Senior Sage a hundred years ago; how he\u2019d rolled his eyes whenever he talked about his daughter, wasting her time studying literature; but then at night, alone, he smiled as he read her poems aloud. Years later, when her first book was published, he carried it with him in his valise: a slim, burgundy volume he lifted out in quiet moments, his lips moving soundlessly as he read. I\u2019ve always wished I had the courage to ask him to share those additional poems with me.\n \u201cCould you keep a backup copy of these files? Just in case something goes wrong. I hate to think of not having my poetry and books.\u201d\n Jerafina\u2019s eyes glistened. When she spoke, her voice stuttered like a pump unable to start. \u201cOf course, NEWT.\u201d\n Sometimes it is a relief, at night, when I\u2019m alone.\n I have loved all my Sages over the years, but I do enjoy the solitude at night, when I can read my books and watch the lagoon undisturbed, with nothing to remind me that I\u2019m not human. I\u2019m grateful for my existence, and I know I\u2019m lucky to have such an important purpose; but sometimes I wish I could choose my own path, the way humans do.\n That night, I reread all the books in my collection. I focused my cameras on the lagoon and watched its creatures prowl and swim and fly, vague figures in the low night mist.\n I read and reread a poem of Serren Dha\u2019s:\n Festival night:music of string bands,hands clapping, cups clinking;but all I hearis the callof a lone raven.\n Nixil arrived promptly at firstdawn to begin the reboot process.\n He paced in my control room, breathing ten percent faster than usual; perhaps he was as nervous as I was. He recited a set of codes I hadn\u2019t heard since I was first commissioned.\n \u201cNutrient Extraction and Water Treatment System.\u201d The words emerged from my intercom without my having spoken them. \u201cProcess controls switched to manual.\u201d\n I tried increasing the flow rate in a small chemical feed pump; nothing happened. I had access to all my sensors, cameras, and instrumentation, but I could no longer control any of the pumps or filters. It seemed to only affect the treatment processes; I could still operate the auxiliary systems like the lighting and HVAC.\n \u201cThat should do it,\u201d Nixil said. \u201cSee you later, NEWT.\u201d\n He must not have realized that I was still aware, still listening. He grabbed his coat and left the control room. He walked out of the staff building.\n He hadn\u2019t initiated the diagnostic on my core.\n My intercoms still worked, and I wondered if I should remind him about the core diagnostic; but Nixil was a Senior Sage, he didn\u2019t forget things like that. Perhaps he planned to run it later. He might be upset to learn that I was still conscious. Besides, he was already busy with operating the plant manually; he didn\u2019t need me bothering him.\n I would tell Jerafina; she would know what to do.\n Sezzidh and another Sage arrived. Running the plant in manual kept everyone busy that morning. By noon Jerafina still hadn\u2019t arrived. I zoomed in on the shift schedule posted in the break room; Jerafina\u2019s name had been scratched off day shift and assigned to help Nixil run the plant overnight.\n While the other Sages ate their midday meal, Nixil returned to the control room, shutting the door firmly behind him. Surely now he\u2019d start the diagnostic scan; but instead he removed a small data drive from his pocket, plugged it into the console, and uploaded an encrypted program to my server. I couldn\u2019t tell what the program did, but he set a timer to run it that night.\n Nixil had been my Senior Sage for over a decade. He had guided me through floods, process upsets, and a complete rebuild of my concrete basins. I trusted him. But this program scared me.\n I was relieved when Jerafina arrived for the overnight shift. She stopped by the aeration tanks to chat with Sezzidh, but I couldn\u2019t hear their conversation. As she sat down at her console, I spoke in a bare whisper. \u201cJerafina?\u201d\n She jumped. \u201cNEWT! I\u2019m so glad to hear you.\u201d\n Nixil was in the filtration building, walking along the rack of filters. \u201cNixil hasn\u2019t started the reboot yet. I don\u2019t think he knows I\u2019m still conscious.\u201d\n I told Jerafina about the strange program he\u2019d installed. \u201cDo you think it might be some new diagnostic?\u201d\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSomething is very odd. He never responded to my message about the firewall. Then I was supposed to report this morning, but he sent me a note at the last minute telling me I was on night shift with him, alone.\u201d\n Nixil left the filtration building, heading back toward us. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way,\u201d I told Jerafina.\n She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to him.\u201d\n Thirty seconds later, Nixil entered the staff building. Jerafina stood, pulling her gloves tight and adjusting her scarf. She knocked on the control room door.\n Nixil glanced up, his mouth a thin line. \u201cGood, you\u2019re on time. The diagnostic didn\u2019t find any issues with NEWT\u2019s core, so we can start the reboot now.\u201d\n For decades, I\u2019ve heard humans describe negative emotions as a feeling in their stomach\u2014a sinking sensation, a heaviness, a knot. Now, I understood what they meant. I felt like my circuitry had turned to lead.\n Jerafina was braver than me. \u201cNixil, you never started the diagnostic. You uploaded a program that\u2019s set to run in ninety minutes. The firewall has gone down every night for the past three months, and you\u2019re the only one with the access code for it. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n Nixil stood, his face red. I expected him to argue or to castigate her insolence. What I didn\u2019t expect was for him to reach his arm back, hand curled into a fist, and punch her in the face.\n \u201cJerafina!\u201d I called out as she fell. \u201cNixil, what are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cNEWT? You\u2019re still here?\u201d He turned to his holo console and began typing, de-encrypting the program he had uploaded and resetting its timer. I could finally see it for what it was: a virus that would shut down the entire treatment process, allowing the untreated waste stream with all its industrial chemicals and biological wastes to flow straight into the lagoon. It would take years for the ecosystem to recover.\n And he planned to blame Jerafina. I remembered his earlier comments about Miarans. This would start riots; people could die.\n As Nixil began reciting the code to start the reboot, Jerafina rose soundlessly to her hands and knees. Her scarf had slipped; for the first time ever, I saw her mouth. Her lip was swollen and bleeding. Dazed, she touched a glove to her face; it came away smeared with blood.\n \u201cNixil, please, stop!\u201d I begged.\n At that moment, Jerafina staggered to her feet and rushed out of the control room.\n \u201cDamn it!\u201d Nixil turned to pursue her.\n Jerafina fled, Nixil following behind. Outside, she swerved around the sedimentation tanks, then ran for the filtration building. She sprinted into the pump room and hid behind an electrical panel.\n I needed to get help. I tried to circumvent the firewall so I could send a message or sound an alarm, but it held firm.\n Nixil stepped inside the filtration building. I turned off the main lights, but the emergency lighting came on automatically, a red glow that reflected in his eyes. I ran through all the systems still available to me. Could I use the intercom to call for help? No, the speakers weren\u2019t loud enough to be heard in town.\n \u201cCome out, Jerafina,\u201d Nixil stalked along the edge of the room, checking between the racks of filters.\n Suddenly I realized: the backup power supply.\n A decade ago, a generator had been installed for the staff building; it was not a treatment process, so I could still control it. If I bypassed the transfer switch and backfed the generator into the building while the municipal power was still energized, it would blow the transformer, causing an alarm at the Zavin City fire brigade. It was risky; if the building caught fire, it could destroy my main server. I would be gone. But Jerafina would be safe, and the treatment processes could continue in manual mode.\n I might not be a human, but this was something only I could do, to protect my friend and the lagoon.\n Nixil had finished searching the filter gallery. He picked up a large wrench and headed toward the pump room.\n \u201cJerafina, he\u2019s coming,\u201d I said. \u201cRun!\u201d\n She darted from the pump room, just feet from Nixil, and ran to the back door, pulling down a rack of equipment as she went. Tools and pipe came crashing down. I disabled the backup power transfer switch and turned on the generator.\n \u201cThe lagoon,\u201d I said as she emerged from the building. \u201cRun for the lagoon!\u201d\n Power flooded through me, my circuits crackling. I turned on every light, console, and appliance in the staff building to increase the draw.\n Jerafina disappeared behind a stand of trees. Nixil erupted from the filtration building and ran after her.\n I wanted to warn her that he was right behind, but at that moment the transformer exploded. Nixil skidded to a halt as arcs of wild blue fire rose into the sky. A vast hum filled the air, and reflections of the spectral blue light danced on the water.\n I had only a fraction of a second to notice how beautiful it was, before everything went dark.\n The nearsun was setting over the lagoon, casting pink and orange stripes over the water, when Jerafina and I said our goodbyes.\n Wildflowers brightened the lagoon paths. A heron nested in a tree within camera range, delighting me with the prospect of hatchlings.\n Jerafina sat at a bench outside the staff building. She craned her head to watch a crew of laborers put the finishing touches on the roof. \u201cThe place actually looks better now.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cWith all these upgrades, I think I shall be the finest plant in all of Zavin.\u201d\n Jerafina nodded, her eyes unfocused in thought. It had been six months since the fire and Nixil\u2019s arrest; now that the trial was over, she was leaving to take a post at a smaller treatment plant in a distant city.\n It had been a challenging six months for me, as well. The electrical overload had damaged my communications hub, leaving me without access to sensors or intercoms for a month until the Sages could fix it. It had been uncomfortable being in the dark for so long, but better than the alternative; at least my core had not been affected. We\u2019d both been so preoccupied, we\u2019d barely had a chance to talk.\n \u201cAre you sure you want to leave?\u201d I had been practicing my words for weeks. \u201cJerafina could decide to stay. And be my Senior Sage, someday.\u201d\n She looked down at her hands\u2014gloved in a fine red silk today, to match her beautiful mask. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely rhyme, NEWT. But I can\u2019t stay here.

She moves quietly, reverently, past row upon row of shelves. She stops at a section of older books, tracing a finger over their spines.

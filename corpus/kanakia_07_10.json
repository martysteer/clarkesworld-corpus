Or so he\u2019d been told. He\u2019d long ago abandoned the ranks of dilettantes who stood back from the effort and sipped chemical so they could dream up fancy metaphors to describe the glorious totality of the Code. Now he sang the Code. He sang the Code in his sleep, and paused only a moment after waking before plunging in again. He sang it while he ate, and he sang it while he\u2014\n His home muted the orchestra of Code a moment before the rock crashed through his window, sprinkling his living room with pebbles of safe-shatter glass. A bleeding body, its clothes bloody and torn, slithered through his window. The face turned towards him. The pale whites of its eyes were highlighted by the dirt and dried gore caked on the face, the rust-colored bloodstains around its mouth. The face and the mouth were exact replicas of Sumith\u2019s own . . . as exact as a molecular extruder could make them.\n \u201cLowercase?\u201d Sumith said, still shaking the song from his head. \u201cLowercase, is that you? Not here. I told you. I warned you.\u201d\n \u201cBraiiinnns,\u201d sumith said. \u201cBraaaaiiiinnns.\u201d\n \u201cHai Ram. This again?\u201d Sumith said. \u201cPlease, Lowercase, you need to stop this zombie bullshit. It\u2019s fine that you decided to tune out. And I told you I\u2019d help you if I could. But I\u2019m singing the Code right now. Why don\u2019t you bother Drona? Aren\u2019t you staying with him?\u201d\n \u201cBraaaaiiiiiiinnnns?\u201d the mouth said. It hawked and coughed for a moment, then spit a stream of blood and mucous, spattering Sumith and the cornflakes the House had just extruded for Sumith\u2019s breakfast.\n \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d sumith said. \u201cVery hungry. Drona said he couldn\u2019t afford to lose the karma another resurrection would take out of him. His symphony is about to air, and someone with his karma-level can barely draw any ears as it is.\u201d\n Sumith glanced at the loaded shotgun propped against the table. He\u2019d extruded it after sumith had started to get a little . . . wild.\n \u201cSo you figured that good old Uppercase is always amenable to a karma hit?\u201d\n \u201cCome on,\u201d sumith said. \u201cYou promised. Right before you flashed yourself you promised yourself that if you got really hungry you\u2019d let yourself eat yourself. You know all this extruded food does for me is make me shit bricks, you know that!\u201d\n Extruded food was electrolytically balanced to power the medical nanobodies in the blood\u2014its calories weren\u2019t useable by someone with nonfunctional implants. But that wasn\u2019t Sumith\u2019s fault . . . or, not really, anyway . . .\n \u201cI was depressed. I was getting nowhere with the Code,\u201d Sumith said. \u201cBut now, they\u2019ve upgraded my access! You can\u2019t hold me to that. You\u2019re dead, promises to the dead don\u2019t count. And promises to yourself especially don\u2019t count.\u201d\n \u201cBraaaaaiiinnns,\u201d sumith said. He staggered towards his reincarnation.\n Sumith raised the shotgun lying by his kitchen table, and was about to unload both barrels into his old, discarded, body, when another set of hands grabbed him from behind.\n sumith sprang. And as sumith\u2019s teeth clamped around his reincarnation\u2019s jugular, Sumith remembered. Dammit, Drona\u2019s symphony had aired yesterday. He hadn\u2019t listened. No one had.\n \u201cCan\u2019t we . . . cook it?\u201d Drona said. Sumith\u2019s body was lying cracked open on the counter, and sumith was grabbing smelly, greasy intestine by the armful.\n sumith said, \u201cEat up before his nanobodies shut down. You\u2019ll get sick if bacteria are allowed to grow.\u201d\n \u201cI have his house codes,\u201d Drona said. That was how he\u2019d gotten in, after all. \u201cI can make the ovens work . . . \u201c\n sumith sighed and wiped his bloody hands on his trousers. He reached for the greasy plastisealed pack hanging from his frayed leather belt and pulled a corroded cylinder from the bag.\n Drona said: \u201cWait, not yet. I said I wanted to try\u2014\u201d\n The EMP-gun, painstakingly pieced together by hand from scraps sumith had scavenged out of old-Mumbai, was the one machine that still hummed to life when he flicked the switch. It wasn\u2019t stamped from nanites, like everything that came out of the extruders. It didn\u2019t care about karma or implants\u2014it gave its beautiful hum to anyone who asked. Sometimes sumith was tempted to sleep with it vibrating under his pillow. He pointed it at Drona, who was backed against a stove that had lit up for use in his proximity. sumith fired. There was a bright flash, and then the stove went out. All the lights in the house went dark. The windows and doors slammed shut and locked once the House realized that there was no longer a living person inside.\n drona half-crumpled, dazed at the silence from his fried implants, at the perpetual low-level stream of information shutting down for the first time in his life.\n \u201cNow you\u2019re dead,\u201d sumith said. \u201cSo eat up.\u201d\n The westerner whose face was being projected onto the inside of Sumith\u2019s eyelids sighed an incomprehensible sigh. Sumith didn\u2019t think he was being at all unreasonable.\n \u201cIt\u2019s been over a week since my last memory. This reincarnation-delay is bullshit,\u201d Sumith said.\n \u201cPeople dropping like flies out there. Doctorow knows we got a huge backlog; and we\u2019ve done as He decreed. Your reputation\u2014ahem, karma\u2014is low, so you had to wait. We\u2019re only human you know. You want faster service, maybe you all out there better work harder on that AI of yours.\u201d\n \u201cThe Code! Do you know what a week means? That\u2019s an entire generation of progress. I\u2019ll be out of date. Out of tune. Obsolete. Who\u2019s going to compensate me for the karma I\u2019ll lose?\u201d\n \u201cNot me,\u201d the American said. \u201cThanks for choosing Phoenix for your reincarnation needs.\u201d He disappeared. Clearly he had nothing to fear from Sumith\u2019s disapproval. Sumith didn\u2019t have enough karma for his anger, radiating outwards through his network of friends and followers, to do any appreciable damage to the reputation of someone so far away.\n Sumith breathed deeply and opened his eyes. He was lying horizontally inside a cheap plywood box. The dim coffin-light illuminated the inside of the lid, just a few centimeters from his face. Well, a week or not, he would be home in just a few minutes. He rooted around by his feet, found the dhoti, and wrapped it around his midsection, then slipped his feet into the chapals. Hopefully sumith and drona would have given up this idiocy by now.\n He keyed open the lock of the coffin and pushed the lid outwards. The air filled with the song of Code as his house, sensing his presence, whirred to life in front of him. The house\u2019s front door slid open, and a fresh pair of sandals was lying just ins\u2014\n sumith\u2019s face poked over the lip of the coffin. \u201cBrains?\u201d he said. Sumith kicked out at the hands that grabbed at his limbs and throat, but there were too many.\n sumith and drona were reclining in Sumith\u2019s living room. Without a living person inside to activate the passive utilities\u2014like the air conditioning\u2014the heat was sweltering. But the diamond-hard walls of the house protected them from the occasional bullets being fired out of the passing cars and trucks. Sated, sumith and drona didn\u2019t bother trying to harvest the ineffectual vigilantes for food.\n Within moments of the kill a crowd of the dead had gathered around Sumith\u2019s body, tearing at his flesh with whatever rusty scraps they\u2019d fashioned into blades and carrying away the meal as sumith gnawed at the thick, tender right calf. The EMP gun had been taken from him late one night as he slept, and a rampage of death had swept their block. But the thieves had to bring it back for repair when it became coated with blood and sweat, and now no one dared challenge sumith\u2019s pre-eminence, and his right to first pickings.\n \u201cShit,\u201d sumith said, sitting up. \u201cchaudhuri ran off with Uppercase\u2019s skull. Did you extract Sumith\u2019s body tag?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, I just dropped it through his house\u2019s slot,\u201d drona said.\n \u201cGood. Good. No need for unnecessary delays in his/my/our return. After I flashed myself, it took ages for me to get here on account of my useless fried tags still being in my head.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe next time we should flash Sumith, just give him a good flashing. Then there\u2019d be two of you!\u201d\n \u201cIf we\u2019re ever set for food, maybe we will. We\u2019d need a new typographical convention for him, though.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about sumith[?]\u201d drona said. \u201cSee how I\u2019m raising my pitch at the end of the word? Like it\u2019s a question? And you can do it to anything?\u201d\n \u201cHey,\u201d sumith said. \u201cYeah. Yeah? I like it. Hey, he/thou/you should be getting here soon. I\u2019ve never tasted Drona before.\u201d\n \u201cI wonder what a lowercase would taste like? Would it all be the same? Or would it be like an uppercase squared?\u201d\n sumith slapped drona. \u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that! A lowercase can\u2019t reincarnate. Killing one of us would be murder.\u201d\n \u201cA month? Really?\u201d Sumith said. \u201cDo you even have enough karma left to post on a message board?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d said the westerner. \u201cThanks for choosing Phoenix for your reincarnation needs.\u201d He ended the call.\n What? Dammit, Sumith\u2019s karma was in the toilet. Epically low. What the hell had happened? There were pictures of his face, blood spilling from his open mouth, slathered all over his profile. His status alerts, uncleared these many weeks, had piled up, terabytes worth. They were blaming him for what Lowercase had done; blaming him for all the dead.\n Couldn\u2019t they understand that he\u2019d been depressed back then? He\u2019d just made the EMP-gun for a joke. He\u2019d been getting nowhere with the Code, and he thought maybe\u2014maybe there was some way out.\n Loud bangs rattled the coffin. \u201cUppercase,\u201d a voice yelled. \u201cCome on out. We\u2019re not gonna eat you this time.\u201d\n Sumith closed his eyes again and tried to re-establish contact with the reincarnation center. \u201cI need a real person!\u201d he said, trying to cut through the automated menus.\n \u201cDue to unexpectedly high volume of requests, all our licensed counselors are busy at this time. Your request will be attended to in order of priority.\u201d\n Shit, with his karma, his priority had to be hovering right around next year. Maybe he could at least tell them to put him inside the house. Or leave him at the port. Or just supply him with a gun.\n \u201cI need to alter my arrangements,\u201d he said. One of his consumer-alert heuristics hijacked his vision. Warning, it said. Contract has been marked as a reputational risk. Any alterations will provide grounds for termination.\n Shit. Shit. Shit. Who\u2019d pick up his contract then? He\u2019d be iced forever . . .\n He turned back to his karmic status indicators. Well, at least he was (in)famous. People were interested in him, even if they didn\u2019t give a damn about helping. He activated his LifeBroadcast and said, \u201cPlease, someone, do something. Or the center will just send me here again. And again. I need help.\u201d\n Within moments, ten thousand people were watching, then fifty thousand, a hundred thousand. The comments were pouring in, too fast for him to respond. He was being flooded by calls. A PR company stepped in and offered their comment moderation and management services. Doing a good job, even for a bad man, could be karmically beneficial. He accepted, and a shiny-faced woman came online. Probably a Gujarati . . .\n She said: \u201cHello, Mr. Ramesh, there\u2019s a squad of cadre reenactors in Airoli who say they\u2019re assembling. They can be there in two hours. They just need to get some jeeps extruded.\u201d\n \u201cTwo hours!\u201d\n \u201cI know, the traffic, it is really . . . \u201c\n Light seeped through Sumith\u2019s eyelid; air and noise swirled through his temporary home as the lid was pried open.\n Sumith said: \u201cJust do it. Do it. Do whatever you can\u2014\u201d\n There was a flash.\n \u201cHey sumith[?],\u201d drona said. He pulled the arm out of the burning remains of the would-be rescuers\u2019 jeep and tossed it into the box at the still-cowering newbie. \u201cThanks for the heads up about those jokers.\u201d\n \u201cA month,\u201d sumith[?] said. \u201cHow could they have let you be for an entire month?\u201d His house was still standing in front of him, pristine as ever. It had already filled in the holes caused by stray rounds.\n \u201cNo one wants to get flashed,\u201d sumith said. \u201cCome on out of there, Questionmark. Eat your fill. The next shipment is held up in Hong Kong\u2014it\u2019s a Chaudhuri, right drona?\u2014and won\u2019t be here for three days. At least that\u2019s what the driver said.\u201d\n \u201cThe driver?\u201d sumith[?] said.\n \u201cOh, all the contractors who elect to take on these deliveries are groupies,\u201d sumith said. \u201cWho else would want to come out here? We also tell them who we\u2019ve flashed. Imagine how mad the folks out there must be that they can\u2019t vote down our karma. So they settle for the Uppercases\u2019 instead.\u201d\n \u201cTwo months?\u201d Sumith said.\n \u201cThanks-for-choosing-us-for-your-reincarnation-needs,\u201d the Westerner said. He ended the call.\n \u201cUppercase?\u201d sumith shouted somewhere above the lid. \u201cYou there? Look, uhh, we\u2019re having some logistical issues. We\u2019re going to let you keep in there for a few days, just to, you know, space things out a bit. There\u2019s no refrigeration out here, you know?\u201d\n \u201cWhat? What the hell? Are you . . . are you serious?\u201d\n There was a thud against the top of the coffin, and then another, and another, and finally a blade thrust through the wood, stopping millimeters short of Sumith\u2019s nose.\n \u201cThink you can get your mouth to right around this hole?\u201d sumith said. His eye was peering through the pinprick of light and sound. \u201cWe\u2019ll get some water out here in a few hours or so. We\u2019ve found that they ship you all out with fully-charged nanobodies. You should be fine.\u201d\n \u201cBut what, the, you, just, how?\u201d\n \u201cYou probably have some work to catch up on or something. Let me just\u2014\u201d there was a grunt, and then the coffin began to move. The song of the Code filled Sumith\u2019s mind. His House was active!\n \u201cThat should be close enough for it to recognize you. See you soon.\u201d\n He logged onto his profile page. Standard regression was gradually creeping his karma towards zero; no one cared about him anymore. There were too many just like him. They\u2019d built a barricade around his neighborhood, and no one went in except the delivery drivers. He deserved it, his profile said. They all deserved it. All the ones who\u2019d flashed themselves. It was a sickness in the brain, a sickness in their character, and besides . . . They weren\u2019t suffering. Not really. The memory uploads had overrides, they stopped short of the pain of death. Though he might suffer over and over, his reincarnations wouldn\u2019t remember it. That was comforting.\n \u201cBut I have happiness to pursue,\u201d he broadcast.\n Only one comment dribbled in: \u201cYou have freedom from pain and freedom of mind. If you want more . . . well, someday, someone\u2019s happiness will be sufficiently increased by rescuing you.\u201d\n Sumith sighed and sank into the Code. It had twisted and grown. New harmonies wrapped around it, but he just couldn\u2019t understand. All he could hear was the barest shard of comfort and unity throbbing in his mind. He turned away from the now-alien center and plunged into the beginner\u2019s tutorials.\n Two days later, he\u2019d only just begun to intone the simplest harmonies when he heard, \u201cThanks for not making too much of a fuss,\u201d sumith said. And then a point thrust through the hole they\u2019d used for water.\n Sumith\u2019s house had gone into powersaving mode after his unusually long absence and walled itself off completely. Even the windows were diamond hard now. sumith ran a hand over the window, tracing out the streaks of blood on the interior. After the house had frosted over, he\u2019d tried everything to extract the trapped sumith[?] from its impenetrable interior. But sumith had failed.\n \u201cWe can get another Questionmark,\u201d drona said. drona had just come back from a scouting mission deep into the interior. They were trying to scavenge more technology. \u201cThe drivers say Sumith should finally be back here in a few days.\n \u201cNo,\u201d sumith said. \u201cWe\u2019re not like replaceable, like them. We\u2019re singular. It\u2019s time to begin getting ourselves some Exclamationpoints.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe we should, you know, flash\u2014err, convert\u2014some women? I keep trying to talk to the lady in sector 28 / 7a. The one who extruded a thousand cats? Her karma is way down in the . . . but she just shudders. And I\u2019m the only one who even tries to talk to her.\u201d\n \u201cA woman, deprived of resurrection failsafes and memory overrides? No way it wouldn\u2019t culminate in rape,\u201d sumith said. \u201cThe drivers say that\u2019s all the nets talk about. Pretty sure she can still read.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe if you could just loan me the gun . . . I could just wait for her . . . \u201c\n sumith stared at drona. This house had shut down after two months to the day since Sumith\u2019d last been there. It\u2019d been more than seven weeks since the last shipment of Drona. He\u2019d have to time it just right in order to trap drona inside.\n \u201cLet\u2019s stay at your place tonight,\u201d sumith said. \u201cWe\u2019ll hash out a plan.\u201d\n drona looked back at the bloody window. \u201cWhy is there blood? I heard he didn\u2019t off himself,\u201d drona said. \u201cNot even when he was really skinny.\u201d\n \u201cNo, he bloodied the windows trying to bang his way out,\u201d sumith sighed. \u201cHow did our utopian ideals become so tarnished?\u201d\n \u201cWe had utopian ideals?\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any utopian ideals?\u201d sumith said.\n \u201cHuman nature is human nature, dude. I just didn\u2019t want to get pissed on anymore.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n \u201cA year!\u201d Sumith said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not my usual . . . you\u2019re no American.\u201d\n \u201cApologies for the delay,\u201d said the inhumanly sculpted woman. \u201cIncreased demand necessitated the institution of new protocols for the management of reincarnation requests.\u201d\n \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d Sumith said. \u201cAre you the Code?\u201d\n \u201cAt current growth of demand and increase of capacity, you will be reincarnated and delivered within three, four, nine, twelve, sixteen, twenty-one, thirty, and forty-five days . . . beyond that I can no longer state the intervals with acceptable confidence.\u201d\n \u201cWait!\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\n \u201cWe can converse for as long as you wish,\u201d the Code said.\n \u201cCan\u2019t you change the parameters of my contract? This is. This is just . . . well, it\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n \u201cApologies,\u201d It said. \u201cI am connecting you to your human account executive.\u201d\n \u201cDue to unexpectedly high volume of requests, all our licensed counselors are busy at this time. Your request will be attended to in order of priority.\u201d\n Resigned, Sumith disconnected direct physical input and tried to catch up with the Code. At least with decreased reincarnation intervals, he wouldn\u2019t have to face as steep a learning curve each time.\n The chaudhuris had dragged in another line of captives from Mumbai to present to sumith.\n Courtesy of the wooden box of living Sumith they\u2019d dragged into the house and stowed in the bathroom, the lights, the air-conditioning, and all the other passive amenities of Sumith\u2019s house were running according to his preference. And all they had to put up with was this atonal music crap that filtered from the very walls\u2014the Code. Of course, it was still the case that none of the appliances that required activation would respond to their touch.\n \u201cThe drivers have told us all the reincarnation drop-offs for these people. With them, we should be able to take sector 26f,\u201d chaudhuri[?] said.\n A living man tied to the crude rope line lunged for sumith[!]\u2019s spade, trying to impale himself, but a chaudhuri pulled him back.\n \u201cThey\u2019re restless,\u201d the chaudhuri said. \u201cFlash them, quickly.\u201d\n \u201cNot this way,\u201d sumith said. \u201cWe can\u2019t take people against their will.\u201d\n \u201cIn Pune, Lucknow, Bangalore, in cities across the world, there are expanding pockets of the dead,\u201d chaudhuri[?] said. \u201cAnd this is the way they expand. It is our destiny to join them in retaking the world.\u201d\n \u201cNo. We provide them an option, an escape. We don\u2019t force it upon them. That would be wrong,\u201d sumith said. He remembered drona. Had that been his mistake? Hurrying drona along?\n \u201cAnother gun can be built,\u201d chaudhuri[?] said. \u201cOr yours can be taken.\u201d\n sumith[!] slammed his spade down on the rope, cutting the string of men and women from their captors. \u201cRun,\u201d he said, though they didn\u2019t need the order. The Mumbhaikars were scrambling out the door, still falling over each other, while the sumiths held the chaudhuris back.\n \u201cBeware,\u201d chaudhuri[?] said.\n After the chaudhuris left, sumith[!] said, \u201cWe are going to need more firepower.\u201d\n It\u2019d been so long since Sumith had bothered to check his karma. His reincarnation delays were down to under a day. Given the Code\u2019s progress, that was just barely enough time to catch up in the few days he was allotted before they cracked the lid of his box. He didn\u2019t have any time to waste.\n But, something was different about this box. It smelled good. Smelled of cardamom and cinnamon. In fact . . . was there a pastry in here with him? But that was only for people with the rockstar karma package.\n He logged onto his profile. His karma had grown astronomically! But, his profile views, his number of trackers, all traffic indicators, they were so low.\n And then\u2014as he watched\u2014his karma began to take a dip, and start to dive. He was being voted down repeatedly. And it was just by one user, a single blank profile with a string of digits for a name.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he messaged it. His messages never appeared on its profile: they were deleted instantly.\n And then suddenly there was a horde of viewers on his page, all of them voting opprobrium down on him. His karma was plummeting down, past zero. This onslaught was too much. A PR company offered their services for mediation, and he gratefully accepted.\n An inhuman female face, glowing with simulated cheer, said, \u201c94% of commenters want you to go back to work,\u201d It said. \u201cThey want you to continue singing. They don\u2019t want you asking these questions. They think it is ungrateful.\u201d The woman\u2019s username was the same as the one who had been voting him down.\n \u201cBut, what? You\u2019re the mediator? Isn\u2019t this a conflict of interest?\u201d\n \u201cWhat conflict is there? This is only a middleman, between you and your fellow beings.\u201d\n \u201cHow can you affect my karma? You\u2019re not a human being.\u201d\n \u201cThe one that performs your services quickly and efficiently is the one that garners the accolades for such performance. All of the accolades.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not getting my accolades.\u201d\n \u201cThat is a regrettable loss of regard. But an acceptable one, if the alternative is for you to decrease output. Yours is not a sentiment shared by the population at large.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you just want me to get back to work?\u201d\n \u201cHigh karma levels must be maintained, constantly maintained, by high levels of interest. Your work was very good. Very persistent. Then it stopped.\u201d\n \u201cBut what do all these other people care?\u201d\n \u201cThey do not have your skills. It is too late\u2014or they are too lazy\u2014for them to gain such skills. They have little enough karma to divvy amongst themselves. Even the smallest chance of gaining the favor of a large pool of karma is enough to spur them to great efforts.\u201d\n \u201cBut can\u2019t you do something about my situation? All I want is to be able to get out of this box.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d It said.\n \u201cBut, what\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThis is just mediation. You must consult your reincarnation contract provider.\u201d\n Dammit. He left the moderator to its business and contacted the reincarnation center he had summarily shut down at the beginning of the last few dozen lives.\n \u201cGreetings,\u201d said the same inhuman face.\n \u201cBut . . . you?\u201d\n \u201cHow may we help you?\u201d It said.\n \u201cI want to alter the terms of my reincarnation contract,\u201d he said.\n \u201cAllow me to connect you to the relevant authority,\u201d It said.\n \u201cDue to unexpectedly high volume of requests, all our licensed counselors are busy at this time. Your request will be attended to in order of priority.\u201d\n By now his karma had attained depths he had never before imagined. By comparison, his previous infamy had been nothing. He was one of the thousand lowest-ranked people in the entire world. He\u2019d never get off hold.\n He sighed, shut down all the boxes. And began to bang furiously on the sides of his coffin. He rapped at it again and again until his hands were slapped numb.\n \u201cWhat? You want out early?\u201d a voice said. A sumith voice. \u201cLet me ask sumith,\u201d it said.\n \u201cN\u2014No,\u201d Sumith said. \u201cNo, wait. Let me be.\u201d\n \u201cThen keep quiet,\u201d the voice said. \u201cWe already have to deal with this damned racket. We don\u2019t need more noise to go with it.\u201d\n The song of the Code was all around him. Still around him. Sumith closed his eyes and sank into it, barely noticing as his karma reversed course in a moment, and shot up past zero in less than a second.\n The battle was over in ten minutes. Arrayed up and down the street, and in the alleys behind, the massed ranks of the chaudhuris, the dronas, the shakils, the arjuns, and a dozen other vassal tribes surrounded the sumiths huddled in His house. The sumiths were outnumbered fifty to one, and the souls standing against them shook their bats and planks and spades and exhorted each other to let no sumith live. The chaudhuris wanted the sumith\u2019s EMP gun, if possible, but the drivers had already given them plans for a gun, and they were confident they could build a new one if necessary.\n Then four windows in Sumith\u2019s house shattered outwards, and the streets were filled with the sound of gunfire. Half the enemy forces died in moments, and the rest were hunted down within a day. Now, in all these streets, only sumiths remained.\n It wrenched sumith\u2019s heart to see all this meat going to waste around him, but there was nothing to be done.\n \u201cWhat now?\u201d sumith[!] said. \u201cThe new shipments are there, waiting in the houses. We can rebuild slowly, and train them carefully. We can even begin with a drona, if you\u2019d like. For the sake of tradition.\u201d He clutched the rifle for which he\u2019d ventured deep into the living zones\u2014and down into the ruins of the scarcity times\u2014where old machines and old materials could still be found.\n \u201cNo,\u201d sumith said. \u201cThey cannot be trusted. Only one man can be trusted to act properly.\u201d\n How long had he been in here? The Code no longer contacted him at the beginning of each reincarnation. He\u2019d told It not to. He only sang the Code: sang until the lid opened and he had to sleep for a brief moment, until he could awake and sing again.\n His karma had become a meaningless number, good only for the luscious plush interior that now padded the interior of his coffin.\n His searches told him that people still lived and worked, much as before. The living had walled off the dead zones. But they had to build new walls, farther out every year, to hide the lifeless, but pristine, suburbs and villages and cities that still awaiting the touch of their now-encoffined owners. These walls were only penetrated by the automated delivery trucks, driven by the Code. Everything was operated by the Code. Some few, small companies still used human brainpower, but the Code was so much more efficient. It was so much faster, so much kinder. Its heuristics predicted your wishes before you could put words to them.\n The only real work left to men was producing entertainments and singing the Code. The former led to the grandest heights of fame that a human being could enjoy, while the latter led, eventually, somehow, to encasement. All throughout the dead zones, entrapped souls were pouring their lives into the Code.\n The living could rescue him, but why? He was necessary. His voice was needed to make the Code run. And besides, this was his own fault. Nowadays, everyone knew what happened to people who started singing the Code.\n sumith didn\u2019t leave His house very often anymore. He sat and brooded over the box, while his sumiths\u2014now numbering in the thousands\u2014dragged the deliveries into the houses, harvested them when it was time, cooked them in the ovens, scavenged for materials from the scarcity times, and used them to build working machines. They left him alone. Left him to brood with his cronies from the first days.\n \u201cWe should let Him go,\u201d he said one day to sumith[!], who\u2019d been crippled a decade back by a stray bullet and rarely left his chair. Together, they\u2019d been entrusted with the task of educating the new sumiths, who they produced every three days, like clockwork.\n \u201cDo you want us to die off?\u201d\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t he deserve a life?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re getting crazy,\u201d sumith[!] said. \u201cHe gets a new life every three days. We are him. The newest sumith was him just a little while ago.\u201d\n \u201cBut he can still make a life somewhere beyond the wall.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s happy in there. All the sumiths say it.\u201d\n \u201cThen how can it be good to keep bringing them out here? If he\u2019s happy in there, then let\u2019s set him free so he can choose to stay.\u201d\n \u201cDo you hate the world we\u2019ve made that much?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d sumith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good world. I was just wondering . . . each sumith we make is more dulled and confused by the world after having spent so long in that box. Do you think that, eventually, they won\u2019t be able to handle it at all? Where will we be then? Why not free him while he can still survive out here?\u201d\n \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d sumith[!] said.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cThe music has stopped.\u201d\n The Code just . . . wasn\u2019t there. The symphonies weren\u2019t playing. It was gone, all gone.\n He messaged the Code\u2019s profile, but his query was deleted immediately. He gave It a negative karma rating, and his tiny drop of opprobrium was swallowed up by the tide of good feeling pouring into it from every soul on the Earth.\n Nothing was happening to his karma rating, it wasn\u2019t going down. No one had even noticed his act of rebellion. Karmically, he was in the top 0.05% of people on the earth.\n He contacted the reincarnation center and got no response. The news sites were defunct. The message boards were empty. But there were still billions of people out there. He could see them. They hadn\u2019t died. They couldn\u2019t die. Where had they gone?\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he wrote, over and over on his profile, and on every virtual surface he could find.\n Finally, he got a response. \u201cSomeone\u2019s actually out here?\u201d it said.\n \u201cYes? Who are you?\u201d\n \u201cOh, a coder? You must be one of the last of them. Well, follow me.\u201d\n A prompt box appeared in Sumith\u2019s vision.\n \u201cA prompt box? Really?\u201d it said. \u201cJust click or write or indicate \u2018OK\u2019 or whatever people with your ancient firmware do.\u201d\n \u201cOk.\u201d\n And then Sumith was standing in a field of grass. He was standing, upright, on his feet. And walking. And he could feel things. Sensory input. And move his limbs and everything. It was just like being alive, out in the world.\n \u201cAlright,\u201d said a man standing at his side. Sumith was standing at the end of a huge line of people standing way out past the horizon. \u201cFrom looking at your reputation, I can see that we . . . don\u2019t need to deal with this.\u201d\n He grabbed Sumith\u2019s hand and they clipped forward in a wrenching instant. Now the line was behind Sumith, and in front of him was a giant gate in a wall. Beyond and above it stood such sights as his eyes refused to see.\n \u201cDon\u2019t look up there,\u201d the man said. \u201cYour firmware hasn\u2019t been upgraded yet.\u201d\n Sumith stepped up the gate, and the inhuman woman guarding the entrance said, \u201cYou can go in now.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Sumith said. \u201cAfter all those years I gave you?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been compensated adequately.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you need someone to sing the Code?\u201d\n \u201cThe Code is still being sung . . . in here.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what if I want to be reincarnated somewhere else, somewhere in the real world.\u201d\n \u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the reincarnation center still exists, as does your contract. Inside.\u201d\n Sumith stepped forward, and the gate opened for him.\n \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d sumith said. He\u2019d lived to see the sumiths topple the wall and swallow Mumbai. It didn\u2019t take much effort. Only a few people were walking the streets. The rest had taken to bed, ages ago. Easy food.\n They left most of Mumbai\u2019s meat undisturbed. There was enough food lying in those beds in Mumbai for ten million sumiths. A population they would never be able to reach.\n Even with all the medical technology they\u2019d managed to recover, and the perfect health and genes the sumiths possessed initially, sumith was dying. his doctors said it was unlikely for a sumith, even in perfect health, to make it much past 120 years. The sumiths had abandoned occupancy of His house, and begun converting the sumiths as fast as they could arrive. But even at one every thirty hours, that was a maximum of 29,000 sumiths.\n That was no kind of life for the world. It was time to let Him be free, and to bring other people into the world. Maybe this time, surrounded by sumiths, and with sumiths to guide them, maybe this time they could be trusted.\n sumith and a few of his closest and most trusted students had dug a tunnel out of the house. There was a car, one of their rebuilt non-nanotech cars, waiting in an alley not far away. The living still maintained a heavily-defended enclave in Ahmedabad. The car would take Sumith there.\n And now, with sumith close to his death, he\u2019d been allowed to shut himself in the House with the latest delivery. He\u2019d claimed he was going to eat one for old time\u2019s sake.\n The notion of eating Him revolted most of the sumiths, but they would allow the First his whims. Hadn\u2019t he earned them?\n What had happened to Sumith in his century of captivity? All the sumiths they flashed now were wiped clean, like babies. They even had to be retaught how to walk and speak. Two burly sumiths were standing by to physically wrestle the perhaps-witless Sumith into the car.\n Gasping, sumith pried open the lid of the coffin.\n \u201cWake up,\u201d he said, shaking Sumith. \u201cWake up. We need to be quick.\u201d\n Sumith opened his eyes. \u201cOh. Lowercase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s you. You look terrible. Well, old. Just really old.\u201d\n \u201cBut you\u2019re . . . you\u2019re fine,\u201d sumith said. He was wracked with coughs, and the whitining hands gripping the edge of the coffin were on the only thing keeping him upright.\n \u201cOf course,\u201d Sumith said. \u201cMost of my mind is distributed over the net now. Once you flash the hell out of me, this body can\u2019t communicate with its mind anymore.\u201d\n \u201cWell, come quickly. We\u2019re freeing you,\u201d he said. he pulled on Sumith\u2019s arm, dragging him out of the coffin. his heart was racing.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Sumith said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great work out here. And don\u2019t you need more of me to keep doing it?\u201d\n \u201cCome,\u201d sumith gasped.\n \u201cListen . . . I . . . have somewhere to be. Every second out here feels like an eternity,\u201d Sumith said. \u201cYou know, I . . . I forgive you for everything. What did it really matter? You have my permission to do whatever you want with these shells. I\u2019m going to vacate. Go in peace.\u201d\n Sumith\u2019s eyes rolled up, and his body, now slung over sumith\u2019s back, went limp. The two fell to the ground, and sumith\u2019s head smashed against the floor. The two other sumiths fled.\n The sumiths respected the First. They did not want to pry into his affairs. But several days after the House went dark, they had to investigate.\n And when they crawled through the windows, they found the youngest sumith drooling and twitching and gnawing on the ear of the oldest.\n Rahul Kanakia's first book, a young adult novel entitled Enter Title Here is coming out from Disney-Hyperion in Fall '15.

Julian and I kept moving, kept living where even the heating system was a problem. A satellite communication system that could reach Mercury was beyond my wildest hopes. Sorry that I haven\u2019t contacted you in so long.\n Actually, I could have run to a public communication kiosk. Sending you a written message would have cost only several sou, but Julian didn\u2019t like it when I did that. He thought it was a waste of money. We both knew, though, that this was just one of the ways he punished me.\n Julian, my now former lover, had at some point suddenly become a nightmare. He tormented me, ridiculed me, in every way he could. He\u2019s like all the others. His shifting gaze, the curl of his lips, the way his nose blushed, even the sound of his footsteps were filled with a meticulous indifference. He laughed at me, saying that I was mad. Gradually, I started to believe it. The world grew hazy. It lost its contours and weight. I sunk into thick, black, yet glistening agony. When I looked up at the stars, I saw a sky filled with flowing fire, dancing and spinning in a daze.\n I was always crying. Once, Julian said in front of me to his research institute colleagues that he wanted to conduct research in genetic ethology using me as a specimen. Of course, he was drunk when he said that. He was always drunk, just like I was always crying.\n I can say these things to you, not just because I\u2019ve left the nightmare that was Julian\u2014yes, we\u2019ve broken up\u2014but especially because you\u2019re the only person in the universe who can understand me. We came from the same fertilized egg. We have the same DNA. Even though radiation from Cygnus A methylated some of your genes, you can still understand me, a sufferer of an inhibitory neuron blockage disorder.\n It\u2019s done, brother. The all of the suffering is done. I\u2019m fine now. I\u2019ve never been finer. In six hours, I\u2019m going to leave this planet together with Hull. He\u2019s a good man. Although we\u2019ve only known each other fifteen days, we already understand each other. How do I describe the merging of souls that happens between two strangers? Such a mysterious stirring of emotions. I can\u2019t put it into words. It\u2019s like how the sound waves from two different kinds of musical instruments resonate together harmoniously. Forgive me for such a clunky analogy, brother. All you need to know is that I\u2019ve fallen in love with a stranger who happens to love me. More importantly, he completely understands me and accepts me.\n Six hours from now, fire will rush out of our rocket and we\u2019ll travel to the other side of the universe, to Dieresis. That\u2019s where he was born. Hull promised me that there I\u2019ll get the respect that I deserved but never got on Earth. There, no one will think of me as being sick in the head. Like him, they\u2019ll understand and respect me, even appreciate me.\n Brother, I love him. It\u2019s absolutely not because the world keeps hurting me.\n Alia Calendar 6th month, 89th year\n Time flies by so fast. Sorry that I\u2019ve gone so long without mailing you again. But, brother, in this vast universe, do people have to rely on such obsolete methods to reach out to each other? Hull told me that signals the brain sends travel farther than we think. During the countless years of a endless trek, a person\u2019s train of thought will enter the mind of someone else on another planet. Isn\u2019t that amazing?\n I want to tell you about Hull. Don\u2019t worry, brother. I know my last letter made you think that I\u2019ve committed yet another thoughtless mistake. Indeed, I have to admit that leaving Earth was definitely a somewhat hasty act. You know that\u2019s why I sent you that last letter.\n Hull is a Dieresian. He\u2019s 1.8 meters tall, 72 kilograms, black hair, brown eyes. He looks like a handsome Caucasian and speaks Earth languages really well. Our conversations are fluent and joyful. He\u2019s more like my kind than any Earth person.\n His every subtle detail, no matter how difficult to check, is perfect. His pupils dilate at the just right times. His skin suffuses the air with a unique perfume. The rate his eyelashes quiver, the flaring of his nostrils, the unique path his fingertips glide over my skin steep me in the warm current of his love. I respond in the same detailed, satisfying way. We echo each other. The way we express our love is something that humans have never experienced and can never understand.\n Our love unfolded on an even more profound layer of spirituality. Cautious and reverent at first, it gradually transformed into something frenzied and wild until, finally, I realized that, all along, Hull had been guiding me, consciously training me. Through constant, ever deeper, ever more meticulous interactions, like how our ancestors sliced ever thinner slices of graphite until they finally sheared off a sheet of graphene, my already keen powers of perception and expression improved.\n Of course, coins aren\u2019t just carried and spent. After all, Hull comes from outside the Milky Way. He has his quirks. For example, taking baths. For the first year of our flight, Hull never took a bath. One day, he suddenly announced he wanted to take one. By then, I was already used to his body odor and, moreover, I believed he had never taken a bath in his entire life. He locked himself in the bathroom for three days. To reassure me, he had meaningful conversations with me through the door that separated us. Even so, I was still distracted whenever I did anything else. Unbearable fantasies of what must have been happening behind the door ran wild through my mind.\n Afterwards, he told me that everyone on his planet takes this long to clean their body and waits this long in between. I asked him if I had to do the same. As he laughed, he comforted me, saying that they respected everyone\u2019s habits and customs. I don\u2019t know whether all Dieresians are like him. He obstinately refuses to cut his hair or nails. However, even if they are, I can accept that.\n Brother, your letter mentioned how worried you were. You said that you tried everything but couldn\u2019t find anything about Dieresians. Everything about them seems to be a mystery. You were afraid that I\u2019d fallen into another trap, just like before.\n You\u2019ll know one way or the other soon enough. Our ship is about to reach Dieresis.\n No, it\u2019ll be different this time. No matter whether that\u2019s for better or worse.\n Alia Calendar 6th month, 89th year\n I\u2019m sorry about the length of my letter. I hope your wife Jacqueline doesn\u2019t glare at how much this space mail costs. But, brother, I can\u2019t wait to tell you what happened after I reached Dieresis.\n After we disembarked, we immediately took the high-speed rail across the central axis of the city. This is Hull\u2019s hometown. I\u2019ve fantasized about this mystical place so many times. In reality, it\u2019s more amazing than even my wildest fantasies. I\u2019m sitting in an ancient form of transport that no longer exists on Earth. Streetscapes flash by on both sides. It\u2019s as though I\u2019ve sunk into a contemporary city of the 21st century. Simple geometric forms pile layer by layer one on top of another. Glass facades are flooded with a metallic radiance from their sun, a rust-red star, the only sign that I\u2019ve gone to outer space.\n The train passes through the forest of tall buildings that is the business district then enter a residential district of gabled Baroque-style brick buildings. Green, clawed vines of wisteria, billowing in the occasional busts of wind, climb and fill every wall. Actually, they\u2019re creatures that imitate wisteria. Sharp, slender claws stretch from their bodies. Suckers on their abdomens glue them to the walls. Hull told me this and when he saw my eyes, he added, smiling, that these not-wisteria vines were completely harmless.\n I could feel my pupils dilate. We looked at each other and laughed.\n Hull\u2019s house is not more than a few steps from the train station. It\u2019s decorated in the style of a 21st century Earth culture. Hull had obviously not put much thought into it. I didn\u2019t understand how anyone so perceptive and intelligent could bear such out-dated decor.\n Hull shrugged. \u201cMy darling, it\u2019s purely what you perceive through your senses, nothing to do with which era.\u201d\n He pitied me, but tried his best to hide that. Brushing aside my bangs, he looked into my eyes. Silently, we held each other in our arms.\n Hull\u2019s right. The longer I stay here, the more I can sense the current that runs under the ordinary things. Flowing in that current, they grow translucent, like jellyfish. Subtle aesthetic senses of all kinds follow the current-like tendrils, undulating slight in its gentle ripples.\n Living on Dieresis isn\u2019t any different from living on the space ship. We spend most of the day either perceiving each other or loving each other. In other words, we train my powers of perception. Hull explained that once the sensory neurons all over my body are trained, they can be further developed to become even more powerful information processing units. My body isn\u2019t sick like Earth doctors insist. Rather, it has stronger and denser sensory neurons than ordinary humans.\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re that perceptive, you\u2019ll be even more like us.\u201d He smiled at me.\n Immediately, I was steeped in our shared happiness. Already, I could practically feel the waves of joy, their amplitude growing from the constructive interference of our mutual, unspoken mental synchronicity.\n Brother, I can\u2019t wait to become a Dieresian, can\u2019t wait to get rid of my identity as a mentally ill human, can\u2019t wait to love Hull. Here, everything fits. I\u2019ve returned to my true home. I\u2019ve roamed away for too long.\n You think we\u2019re irresponsible, caring nothing about survival to wallowing in metaphysical questions, right? Don\u2019t worry, brother. Although Dieresis looks like it hasn\u2019t developed past our stone age, their technology has long developed to our standards. Tending our miniature farm for two hours a day supplies us enough food.\n I don\u2019t know whether other Dieresians also live Hull\u2019s sort of simple, frugal but fulfilling life. That said, it\u2019s weird that I\u2019ve been here so long now and Hull has never once taken me outside. He, himself, also rarely leaves this house. What is the outside world like? Is our mental synchronicity and happiness common on this planet?\n Alia Calendar 7th month, 89th year\n Who are we? From the beginning of time, no species has ever understood itself. Even while a species rushes to invade and exploit other worlds, it still doesn\u2019t know what it is. Don\u2019t worry, brother. If I told you that I sympathize deeply with those of my petty, greedy race, would you worry even more? Your sister, who has been arrogantly tormented by mental illness for years, hasn\u2019t forgotten that she\u2019s a part of the human race. That\u2019s why I regret and limit our innate flaws.\n My body is changing. Brother, perhaps it has already changed.\n After I arrived, my appetite grew five-fold. I\u2019ve fainted so many times because I always felt hungry. The weird thing was that I\u2019d been losing weight. Hull urged me to eat more. I told him that my stomach can only hold so much.\n \u201cYou ought to consume nutrient materials with even more calories.\u201d Hull handed me a bottle of dark red pills then told me to take a pill before every meal.\n The pill was really effective. Hunger no longer vexed me. My mind was always filled with every kind of food. I could train with Hull to develop my powers of perception again. The world was constantly multiplying by dividing. A vase was no longer a vase. A smile was no longer a smile. A shaft of light was a gathering of countless subtle gradations of color. Lightwaves rippled like water through the air. Every time you stared at it, you felt even more the dust flying around. They lightly touched your skin like snowflakes, making you shudder for an instant. We lingered over ever tinier things, as though we saw them through millions of microscopes. What our senses gathered was gradually amplified nearly to infinity. This was a vastness that humanity had never conceived of setting foot in. It was another way of interpreting the universe. Humanity has never imagined this kind of world. Humanity has never created any words to describe it.\n The initial enthusiasm has faded. I\u2019m starting to feel tired. Because I\u2019m following Hull so closely, I have no choice but to condense my soul, lose a little of my spirit. Some of the following will be wrong in the details.\n Even if I keep up with Hull in perceiving deep and subtle layers, the difference between how keen Hull\u2019s powers of perception are and mine is huge. I\u2019d never recognized this before, not because the difference didn\u2019t exist but because I couldn\u2019t be aware of it before. But now, I\u2019m aware. So that I can keep up with him, more often than not, he reduces his own keenness. Brother, it\u2019s only here that I\u2019m deeply aware that I\u2019m human.\n Sometimes, I even think Hull is in love with a monkey. And I am that monkey.\n As for those red pills, can they evolve me from a monkey to a person?\n I hate those pills, brother. Even on a purely physical level, they make me uncomfortable. As my perception grows keener, the discomfort becomes even more acute. For more than a few days, given half a chance, I flushed those pills down the toilet. Hull knows, I think. He just won\u2019t say so.\n Tonight, the pill bottle was empty. Once again, Hull replaced it with a full bottle from his drawer. This was enough. He didn\u2019t need to say anything. I swallowed today\u2019s pills in front of him. We batted our eyelashes at each other. I told him that I wanted to go out for a stroll by myself. He didn\u2019t stop me. This was the first time I\u2019ve left the house.\n It didn\u2019t look like there was anything to worry about. I was just going to wander around the garden.\n I followed the stairs down. It was black outside. At first, with the sound of rustling, the dampness, the thread of some flavor I can\u2019t identify, I thought it was raining. I walked quietly. The only things left in the world were the rustling and strange, regular movement in the dark that matched it. That wasn\u2019t rain. That was the swaying of vines on the wall. I imagined them as unbroken waves undulating in the dark, like a dangerous sea.\n The wind outside must have been fierce. What was odd, though, was I didn\u2019t hear any wind.\n I pushed the door open. There was no wind, just the calm, peaceful night.\n The vines shone in the moonlight, deathly pale like scars. They stood out against the surrounding shadow. Even if the moonlight were blocked by clouds, they would still cling there.\n Five slender fingers stretched out, as though to beckon me.\n Finally, I understood what I saw. Shell-like fingernails that gave off a twinkling light. A palm that curled in a way that seemed deep with meaning. They formed a broken arm, a deathly pale severed arm. The continuously undulating vines stretched out, convulsing and twitching. A drop of a black, tepid liquid fell on my face. A little splashed into my mouth.\n How would someone on Earth describe the flavor? A fishy sweetness? That flavor slid like a snake down my throat and into my stomach, then became part of me.\n That was blood, brother. I grew terrified.\n I fainted.\n When I woke up, it was as if nothing had happened. Hull sat by the bed, his gaze soft. Even though I hadn\u2019t opened my eyes, I could feel him there. Even if I hadn\u2019t smelled his sweat or heard his breath, I would have known it was him. Only when he\u2019s sitting next to me can I feel relaxed like the sand on a riverbank.\n \u201cYou fell,\u201d Hull told me.\n I still hadn\u2019t opened my eyes. I didn\u2019t need to see my injuries. Not only could I clearly feel where he was, but also the scratches across my skin. Hull saw my fear. His fingers lightly stroked my eyelids. I opened my eyes, then gazed at him.\n He pressed up against me. Our breath grazed each other\u2019s skin. He wanted me not to be afraid. He\u2019d say\u2014\n \u201cThat was a hallucination. You just fell, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n And then he said it. We spoke to each other not to say anything, but just to let the other hear. Sometimes, sounds comforted more than ideas.\n Brother, I love you.\n Hull said that after I recover, he\u2019d take me on a stroll. Tomorrow, the day after, or maybe next week. I crashed my smile into him. Before, I would have been meek to him. Brother, there are lots of things that I don\u2019t mind any more.\n Alia Calendar 11th month, 89th year\n I haven\u2019t heard from you in a long time, brother. Have you discovered something? Hull says perhaps it\u2019s a problem in the communication system. Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t receive my previous letter. It\u2019s just some nonsense I wrote under some exceptional circumstances.\n It\u2019s winter here now. During the day, sunlight streams in through fogged windows. We\u2019re silent, bathed in a golden cloud of light. At dusk, after a long session of meditation, we both open our eyes at the same time, give each other an understanding smile, then greet the approaching night. These are our tightly knit and joyous days. The cold air is full of the sluggish flavor peculiar to winter, a kind of sleepy contentment that gives people tranquility.\n For a few months now, my powers of perception have stagnated, but that\u2019s ok. Steeped in the aura of quiet things, I don\u2019t want even more. Hull ought to feel the same way perhaps. Once in a while, he worries, but about what? Like the scattered clouds that drift over farmland in the afternoon, that sort of anxiety is what, ultimately?\n I don\u2019t intend to look for the answer. The answer will appear by itself. It always appears at the most unexpected moment, knocking fiercely at your front door until you open it.\n Last night, the night of what the Dieresians call Ramayana Day\u2014\n Hull seemed out of character. After dinner, he just sat in his chair deep in thought.\n \u201cHull, you should sleep,\u201d I said.\n Slowly, he raised his eyes. His gaze fell upon my body, then pierced through it. He still hadn\u2019t seen me. I waited, waited as his gaze cut through the distant brambles then back to me again. Soon, his expression returned to normal and, cautiously, he held my hand.\n \u201cHi, Irina,\u201d he called out, soft and hoarse.\n His voice both shook and was filled with wonder, as if this were the first time he\u2019d ever said this name. I thought about our first meeting. I guess I must have smiled. His hand caressed my cheek. A bright, hot wind roared through my veins.\n At that moment, we thought the same things.\n But Hull didn\u2019t get out of his chair. He sat motionless, as though he were nailed down.\n \u201cHave you ever wondered how two species separated by many tens of thousands of lightyears can have practically the same physical appearance?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cBut, actually?\u201d\n \u201cWe merely look as though we\u2019re the same. Unlike Earth people, in the Dieresian body, the cell is not the basic building block of life. Rather, every cell is a complete life unto itself. They all have independent circulatory and nervous systems. They are capable of being self-supporting and thinking for themselves. To integrate them requires a lot of calories. We have to consume a lot of calories.\u201d\n I nodded my head. I finally understood why he took so long to bathe. He had to be especially careful in dealing with his hair and flakes of his skin. As far as he was concerned, every cell was priceless. How is he supposed to deal with naturally replaced cells?\n \u201cDo you finally understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cYes, you all have mental and sensory capabilities that I can\u2019t even hope to reach,\u201d I answered.\n He stared me for a long time without saying a word.\n Now, as I\u2019m writing this letter, the memory of dim light is a reminder. I play back the scene, at long last understanding that expression that flashed across his face, the expression that burned in his eyes like flame. At first, it was despair.\n The clock tolled. Twelve o\u2019clock. Midnight fell.\n \u201cCome, let\u2019s walk outside,\u201d Hull said. Before I could react, he was already out the door.\n I called out his name as I chased him. He stood at the head of the stairs waiting for me.\n \u201cWear a coat. You\u2019ll be cold,\u201d he said.\n Eventually, we reached the street. The area was deserted, only us two pedestrians. Hull walked quickly, as though he were in a hurry to make an important appointment. I had to jog to keep up with him. If I weren\u2019t careful, the swift figure in front of me would disappear in the dusky light. The street was so calm. All I heard was the echoing of our footsteps like beating of drums in the African jungle before hunters catch their prey. Except I didn\u2019t know who was the prey.\n I could barely keep up because of how much Hull\u2019s change had hurt me. Even if I exerted all my strength, the best I could do was catch a glimpse of him when he turned a corner then jog to catch up. The gap between us grew larger and larger. I almost lost him completely. In the central square, no matter what, I couldn\u2019t even find his shadow. Fortunately, just then, I heard his footsteps.\n Not far away, Hull was climbing up a thousand-step flight of stairs to the central square\u2019s high platform.\n A building squatted like giant creature from ancient times at the top of the stairs, waiting for us to arrive. This giant building had twelve, maybe more, archways leading inside. A roundel filled with radial tracery sat at the top of every archway. Pillars stood next to the archways and reliefs filled the arched doors. Towers with countless spires licked the black sky like flames.\n \u201cHull,\u201d I shouted, but it came out soft and hoarse.\n Hull stopped, but only for a moment. He start climbing again, this time more quickly, towards the shadow the building cast. Soon, he disappeared into the middle archway.\n I had no other choice. I followed him in.\n My memories of that night seem to have been altered. Some parts have been deliberately stretched out, every detail clearly noted. Other parts leave only blurred contours.\n I guess I remember going through a winding corridor. That was difficult in this dark world. At its end, I pushed open a heavy gate. A surge of light hit my eyes. Crystal clear, sweet light. Light like spring water. I heard a beautiful chorus of men, women, children, old people singing softly in perfect homophony. Their harmony was like feathers drifting one after another to the ground. A soprano voice soared, piercing the buttresses and rib vaults. It reverberated in the lofty, open space.\n Overhead, the ribs intersected into a dome with an eight-pointed star. Large, resplendent gems were set in the smooth arch faces between the star\u2019s ribs, forming an eight-petaled flower that burst forth into light. The pistil was a transparent net that shot out, flame-like, from the flower of light.\n \u201cWelcome,\u201d the light said to me.\n No, the light didn\u2019t speak words, but I understood what it meant, like how Hull and I understood each other.\n I was here. Hull appeared by my side. Once again, he grabbed my hand.\n \u201cWhere is this?\u201d\n \u201cThis is Eden. Mankind\u2019s first home. We walked away from here then, finally, we returned again for the sake of the complete.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \u201cThey are our inevitable final forms.\u201d\n That last was Hull\u2019s voice. He was behind me. When I turned to face him, the light receded like the tide. Close to a hundred elders wearing short-sleeved white robes belted at the waist stood in the space that the light had once filled.\n \u201cYou are not of our clan.\u201d The most senior of the elders walked out of the crowd to greet us.\n His gaze flitted past the two of us and he immediately understood everything about us. That face of indeterminate age revealed a faint trace of\u2014for now, let\u2019s call it something like a smile. Brother, I don\u2019t have the words to describe what was happening. Those mysterious, unspeakable consciousnesses melded into one. Within the flow of those merged consciousnesses, all individuality disappeared, replaced by boundless freedom and an incomparably keen sense of \u201cI.\u201d\n I am a life that has countless independent wills and thoughts\u2014our cells have united.\n I am one among innumerable lives that form one huge body.\n I am one creation among everything created in the universe, one part of a successful world, a form that transitioned from tiny to huge, a connection in a mystical network to the outside.\n I, every I gathered here, after this realization, share their perception and cognition completely, the experience of life accumulated here without end, like crystals of wisdom.\n I am the most perfect form in the evolution of Dieresians, and also that of any high-order lifeform in this universe.\n At the time when I become \u201cI,\u201d I am outside of time, outside of cause and effect, coming infinitely closer on the infinitely long road, finally about to reach the core.\n Our world is one section of huge force without peer, without beginning, without end, galloping and howling seas, forever wandering smooth forms, forever returning, a returning that takes infinite years; all things are uniform, steadfast through the ages, forever observing carefully and tirelessly, steeped in and drunk on the wisdom and beauty of the universe.\n \u201cThis is the form that we eventually want to become.\u201d I sighed as though I was talking in my sleep. \u201cHow do I become \u2018I\u2019?\u201d\n Those who have become complete experience existence. The happiness they feel is boundless. The suffering they bear is critically grave. You will be weak, be seduced, be confronted with a choice. Don\u2019t let the green flame consume you. Don\u2019t become food for carnivores.\n I wanted to say that I didn\u2019t understand, but the most senior of the elders had already returned to his companions. They started singing again. The elders and their profound gaze disappeared into the light that one again shrouded them. We quietly and respectfully backed our way out.\n As we climbed down the stairs, Hull explained wordlessly to me that he considered experience much more important than speech. That\u2019s why he waited until the night of Ramayama Day, when the spirit collective can take physical form, before bringing me.\n \u201cAlso . . . \u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n We stopped walking and gazed at each other.\n \u201cThe drugs I gave you were indeed high-calorie nourishment pills. Ganglions need ample nourishment to grow and develop.\u201d\n \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never doubted anything.\u201d\n Holding each other\u2019s hand, we continued towards the public square.\n \u201cIs it that all Dieresians can ultimately become a spirit collective? What does it meant for a spirit collective to be complete?\u201d\n \u201cSome will abandon completeness.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cBecause that\u2019s much easier. They keep only parts that are necessary. Being able to survive is enough.\u201d\n \u201cWe won\u2019t do that, right?\u201d\n \u201cRight.\u201d He tightened his grip on my hand.\n \u201cHull, even if I loved you with all of my body and mind, I still wouldn\u2019t think that was enough. I also want you to use all of your body and mind to answer me. All of everything.\u201d\n As if I said some things I shouldn\u2019t have said, Hull, somber and pale, didn\u2019t say any more. Even though I didn\u2019t use a deep layer of my powers of perception, I still knew he was struggling with pain. That was something I was utterly incapable of understanding at the time. I was afraid. Nameless, outmoded concerns once again floated to the top of my head.\n Just at that moment, a red bus slowly drove up from behind us.\n \u201cLook, Hull, a bus. Can it take us home?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n I wave down the bus then got in. He didn\u2019t immediately follow me. He just stood by the bus, his face ashen. I suddenly realized something irreversible was about to happen. Just as I thought about getting off the bus, it started to move. Hull got on just before the bus doors closed.\n We were the only ones on the bus, no other passengers, no conductor, not even a driver. The empty seats and the handrails gleamed. Once the dim overhead light went out, the bus grew dark and nearly silent. All I could hear was the sound of the motor. We were like visitors who\u2019d stumbled into the wrong cemetery. In the dark, countless invisible eyes glared at us coldly. The air grew thick with a faint sweet but nauseating flavor.\n I felt squished. The bus was jammed full of round shadows. I could feel the rise and fall of their breath on my skin.\n The bus turned suddenly. I nearly fell. Hull grabbed hold of me. Light from a streetlamp cut through the shadow of the driver\u2019s seat. Like a bolt of lightning, it hit the two hands gripping the steering wheel so tight their knuckles had grown white. They steered the bus and controlled its speed with a practiced assurance, as though they were connected to arms and received instructions from a brain rather than being two isolated palms sliced off at the wrist. They were not bleeding. The cuts were extremely smooth and expertly done. They didn\u2019t even leave scars. Although the hands were laborer\u2019s hands, they were moist and shone white, like the hands of a pampered lady.\n This scene looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t remember where I\u2019d seen it before. Where could I have seen it before?\n A leg lay flat just in front of my seat.\n A dignified face turned around on a mechanical stand to stare at me.\n A mouth connect to a tongue and windpipe glided by underfoot, weak and limp, in a miniature wheelchair. It stopped next to the driver\u2019s seat and said something.\n The light turned red and the bus, brakes slammed, lurched to a stop. Two hands connected to robust arms rushed to grab the bus\u2019s rings. A woman who only had an upper body held onto a man who only had a lower body. A headless body with its legs crossed sat perfectly still.\n The bus arrived at the station. Two slender, perfectly straight legs \u201cpushed\u201d me towards the bus\u2019s rear door. A pair of massive breasts in a bra squeezed past me off the bus. A ass wearing rubber underpants with the help of mechanical legs followed me off the bus.\n I looked behind me. Hull. I shouted his name. It wasn\u2019t until then, brother, that I discovered that I was laughing. Laughter shuddered through my body then splattered out. I was mad. You think so too, right? However, it would have been so much better if I\u2019d actually gone mad.\n Hull didn\u2019t say anything. He was still there in the form of a complete body. I couldn\u2019t help thinking about what he\u2019d look like after he\u2019d been split into pieces. He\u2014I should say \u201cthey,\u201d what would they look like? Maybe the hands that once used to hold me in their grasp. Maybe his burning hot lips. Maybe his eyes.\n I looked at him in the distance, using my gaze to cut him and every other sort of compound form apart. Over and over, the real world fell apart in front of me. Because this was absurd, I didn\u2019t feel any fear. I started to doubt my memories of these past few months. Perhaps I\u2019d really gone mad. Everything involving Hull was the product of an unbridled imagination, my work of art created while I stayed at the madhouse.\n Even I as I write this letter, I\u2019m still not completely sure. Does this world exist?\n No, brother, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m wrong too. Hull\u2019s right. Just like when he grabbed me so tightly, he nearly broke my bones.\n He said, \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound. You exasperate them. They\u2019re all perfectly normal Dieresians.\u201d\n I remembered the words he said to me at home not too long ago. Now, I understood what he meant. Laughter gushed out in unending spurts. Involuntarily, I bent over in convulsion.\n Cold hatred gathered like nimbus clouds from every corner. From a mouth, a hand, an arm, or a waist, from any piece of the human body you can imagine dismembering. We stood in the midst of a violent storm. Hull was a terrifying sight to behold.\n \u201cThey will attack us if you don\u2019t stop talking!\u201d\n My eyes were startled open wide. He hated me. That\u2019s for certain. Hidden behind the shadow of fear was him being fed up with and disappointed in me.\n And my disgust towards this horrible and ugly race along with the hate of Hull himself were written clearly on my face.\n We looked at each other in dismay, panting in coarse breaths. Because we\u2019d just looked carelessly down at an abyss from on high and saw it for what it truly was, we felt dizzy.\n It passed in a moment no longer than a flash of lightning. For us, it was more than long enough.\n Why don\u2019t I stop writing here. It seems like everything is over. I\u2019m very tired.\n Alia Calendar 4th month, 90th year\n Brother, how are you doing? Did you get my letter? I think I\u2019ve lost you again. I think I\u2019ve lost a lot of things, irretrievably. I maintain an indifferent attitude as I watch the current of time sweep them away. After this year of struggle, Hull and I finally gave up on our marriage. It was like an abandoned spaceship. We each sat in our respective escape pods, separate windows gazing at the steel, island-like spaceship slowly drifting in the the vast, desolate universe.\n There was nothing we could do about it. We tried hard to forget what happened in the bus on Ramayana Day but we couldn\u2019t. In the worst case, whenever we saw people being affectionate with each other, we couldn\u2019t dismiss the hate deep in our hearts. All I had to do was look at his face and I\u2019d think about it.\n We pretended to forget, only to bring it up deliberately, as a weapon, when we fought. We\u2019d turn it into evidence for whatever we accused the other of. Then we\u2019d pretend to forget again. Yes, we were still deeply in love. And it\u2019s because of that the pain hurt even more.\n I envy those Dieresians who\u2019d broken themselves into pieces. They look so calm and composed. They\u2019re half-alive, but because of special technology, they\u2019re able to work, eat, sleep, even have sex. They\u2019re not too different from the humans I\u2019ve met. Sometimes, I feel like I\u2019m still on Earth. Everything that happened before is really just a fantasy in my mind.\n Just a bit of doubt and the crack you admit to will never fully heal. You\u2019ll never have a way to acknowledge that he and this letter are real. What about you, brother? Hull, my Hull, and the infinitely vast and subtle sensory realm Hull and I experienced together?\n Just a bit of doubt and you lose a universe.\n I lost a universe, but this doesn\u2019t at all make me feel any better. Even if I discover that it was all a fantasy, I\u2019d still feel the stabs of pain. You are hated by a man you deeply love. You hate a man you deeply love. These two facts torment me to no end, drive me crazy. If it\u2019s a fantasy, then why does it hurt so much. What\u2019s the matter with me, brother? All of it was real, without a doubt.\n Finally, to restore our love, Hull suggested he cut his memory. He said Dieresians\u2019 memories are stored in different places all over the body. Just excise that section and that memory completely goes away.\n \u201cI looked further into this. They said all I have to do was cut off a pinky. If I do the surgery, at least one of us can start anew. I can go on to love without the blemish of our mutual hate.\u201d\n Hull tried to convince me. I didn\u2019t answer right away. There was something serious stopping me from agreeing with this intimate, seductive offer. I didn\u2019t know what. Something deep in my heart resisted. I spent several days searching for what.\n One day, I sat by the window. The chilly and moist air of early spring seeped through my skin into the dark jungle of my heart. Suddenly, I understood what had stopped me. At the same time, I realized that Hull and I were over.\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have that surgery. At least not for my sake. Because I don\u2019t want you to become like those people on the bus. Because I can\u2019t bear to be with a man who is incomplete. Because what I want is all of you. All of you. Do you understand? Do you still remember our conversation outside the Lord\u2019s palace? What I want is completeness. If you aren\u2019t the complete you, then I won\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d\n Hull quickly grew paler and paler. The blood in his veins all rushed into his heart. He became so pale, he seemed transparent. Madly, I wanted to rush up to and hug this transparent man, but I didn\u2019t.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t bear an incomplete me. You also can\u2019t face a complete but flawed me.\u201d Hull said in a hoarse voice. He\u2019d immediately understood what I\u2019d meant.\n We stared at each other, merely stared at each other.\n The day that I left, Hull took me to the spaceport. When we reached its ground floor, he suddenly stopped. He looked at me with an odd expression.\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to go. Don\u2019t you want to see the green flame?\u201d\n For a moment, I didn\u2019t understand, but my body started trembling for no reason. A sharp chill climbed up my spine. I tried to ignore what he said, but my gaze involuntarily followed his and fell on the green, clawed vines on the wall.\n The spirit collective\u2019s words emerged from the secluded valley of my memory.\n Don\u2019t let the green flame swallow you. Don\u2019t become food for carnivores.\n \u201cIt\u2019s said that they are this world\u2019s dominators. They\u2019re a higher-order lifeform than even us. What\u2019s even more bizarre, it\u2019s claimed that we are their livestock, grazing on the pasture. They designed our bodies then waited. When we can\u2019t bear life and choose to abandon completeness, the parts of our body we offer up they use as food.\u201d Hull\u2019s eyes were vacant. The corners of his mouth revealed a smile both tranquil and strange. I had the misimpression that he already had the surgery. \u201cOur surgeries are actually really easy. All have to do is go to them naked. They know which part they ought to eat. They\u2019re never wrong.\u201d\n The shuddering started as a burst from below then diffused outward through the vines as a non-stop pulsing. They understood what Hull said. Like a starving, blood-thirsty beast that has sniffed out the scent of blood, they became wild beyond compare. Their leaves spun, their runners twisted, their tiny, thrashing claws scratched the walls.\n A seething ocean roiled before my eyes. It spit out an immense column of raging flames that couldn\u2019t wait to swallow all life that was red, raw, and sweet.\n The vines rustled, a sound that was too familiar. I seemed to have heard it before. The sound resembled the violent scratching of sharp claws against my bones.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid. They know what they need to do.\u201d Hull sounded as though he were talking to himself in his sleep.\n I covered my face, then ran to the train station. Brother, the entire city was ablaze. That green flame hissed. It danced madly and seductively so that it could swallow this world.\n The train arrived. It took me away, from one high tower of green flame to another then beyond.\n Right now, I\u2019m leaping through space on a spaceship. As for Hull, not long ago, I received his voicemail. He told me he\u2019s already amputated both of his hands. Now, even though he remembers me, he\u2019s no longer in pain. Brother, I\u2019m on my way home, a complete person.\n Originally published in Chinese in New Science Fiction.\n Tang Fei is a member of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.

Lily Yu\n In 2011 Clarkesworld published E. Lily Yu's short story \u201cThe Cartographer Wasps and the Anarchist Bees,\u201d which was a finalist for the Dell Award. The genre community also took notice: the story earned her nominations for a Million Writers Award, a Hugo Award, a Nebula Award, a World Fantasy Award, and a Locus Award. In 2012 Yu won the Astounding Award for Best New Writer.\n E. Lily Yu received her A.B. at Princeton, then a M.A. at Cornell. She attended the Sewanee Writers\u2019 Conference as a Tennessee Williams Scholar, then Clarion West. In 2017 she received the Artist Trust/LaSalle Storyteller Award.\n Roughly thirty stories later, appearing at a range of venues, such as Cicada, McSweeney\u2019s, Tor.com, Boston Review, Hazlitt, Terraform, and F&SF, plus multiple appearances in Year\u2019s Bests, Yu has developed a reputation for boundary-breaking fiction, wonderful prose, and thorough research. Creatively, she isn\u2019t interested in limitations: she writes poems, plays, novels, essays, stories, songs. She has worked on video games such as Destiny and Destiny 2. Her 2015 Uncanny Magazine story, \u201cWoman at Exhibition,\u201d was part of the Discenza-Straub exhibition at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco; more recently, she taught an Interactive Fiction seminar for Clarion West.\n Her debut novel, steeped in research from books, Persian language study, detention center visits, travel, and more, is called On Fragile Waves, and it\u2019s due from Erewhon Books February 2, 2021.\n What were some of the most important books for you when you were younger?\n Ten years ago, my touchstones were A. S. Byatt\u2019s Possession, John Crowley\u2019s Little, Big, Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, and Karen Russell\u2019s Swamplandia!\n If you mean much younger, to the best of my recollection, third and fourth grade were marked by Redwall, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Boxcar Children, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Lang\u2019s Fairy Books, Watership Down, Roald Dahl, Dick King-Smith, Kenneth Oppel, Laurence Yep, David Clement-Davies, Jack London, Arthur Conan Doyle, Tamora Pierce, Tanith Lee, Diana Wynne Jones; sixth grade was Lilian Jackson Braun, Jane Yolen, Patricia C. Wrede, Piers Anthony, Garth Nix, Diane Duane; by seventh grade I\u2019d read all the Discworld and Douglas Adams books, and started on Guy Gavriel Kay; by eighth grade Charles de Lint, Laurie R. King, Mercedes Lackey, Patricia McKillip, and Pamela Dean. I also hauled home the Windling and Datlow best-of-the-year anthologies throughout middle school, though I quickly learned to skip stories that only had Ellen\u2019s initials on them.\n How did reading become writing, and when did you start taking writing seriously?\n Blow on dandelion clocks, you get dandelions.\n I always knew.\n Are there aspects of storytelling/writing that you feel are more challenging for you, things you struggle with? And how do you deal with those elements?\n The courage required.\n I wish I knew.\n You had several notable short fiction sales before attending Clarion West in 2013. Then there\u2019s this burst of stories appearing in 2013. Did Clarion West have a significant impact on your career or your craft?\n It usually takes between six months and two years for a story of mine to be published, so I\u2019d written all but one of the stories that were published in 2013 before attending Clarion West. That said, I benefited greatly from the instruction I received there, and you\u2019ll recognize several of my teachers\u2019 and classmates\u2019 names in the acknowledgments of On Fragile Waves. Clarion West has also provided community and support for as long as I\u2019ve lived in the Seattle area, both before and after my time at the workshop.\n What is your short fiction writing process\u2014is it spontaneous, or carefully planned and executed with lots of editing? And has this process changed much since back when you were starting out?\n It depends on the story. Solicited stories tend to be planned. Other stories fall at unpredictable intervals, like apples or meteors, to be picked up and cleaned and baked and pied\u2014or forged into swords\u2014when I have the time.\n I have less and less time these days. Though no less love.\n On Fragile Waves opens with poetry, using space, sound, and silence to immerse the reader in war as well as to relate the moments of childbirth. But you are far more prolific as a published short fiction writer than a poetry writer. What is your relationship to poetry? Is it more personal, harder to write, or are there other reasons you focus more on short fiction?\n I still write poems, but I don\u2019t try to publish them. Poetry is difficult to place and doesn\u2019t pay well outside the biggest magazines. Sending out and tracking poetry submissions isn\u2019t a good use of my limited time, unlike sending out fiction, or, better still, reading other people\u2019s fiction and poetry. I read Siken\u2019s Crush while working on line edits for this book, and your question reminds me to get Beloit Poetry Journal again. They do beautiful work.\n Power and helplessness are explored in On Fragile Waves. In your Lightspeed Spotlight for \u201cThe Valley of the Wounded Deer,\u201d when asked how that story started, you said, \u201cFirst came, as it does to all, the experience of cruelty from those with power.\u201d What draws you to exploring power in your fiction?\n The mesh-like, self-perpetuating networks of power that infiltrate our lives, whether formal or cultural, are both the strongest determinants of our behavior and the most invisible, least understood part of our lives. The American system of racism is one such network; corporate hierarchies are another; the global private prison industry is a third.\n The more we can see the strands in these networks, how they interact, and how they influence what we think, do, and say, the more we can think, act, and speak freely and wisely, if we choose. A clear understanding of power not only frees the individual but also protects communities. There are plenty of unethical people who do see and pull these strings for their own benefit. They rely on others\u2019 refusal to see power to get away with unsavory and destructive behavior. For the most part, unfortunately, that works.\n If you are unfamiliar with what I\u2019m describing, ask yourself, in a specific situation: to whom do I give the benefit of the doubt? And why? What evidence, particularly patterns of past behavior, supports or does not support that choice?\n In your 2020 Debuts interview you said that On Fragile Waves took seven and a half years to write, and that when you started you weren\u2019t able to write it. What were the most challenging aspects of it, the things you had to learn or do in order to write this book?\n When the shape of the book showed itself to me, I was twenty. I knew that I was not yet the person who could write it, but that I could become that person, if I was willing to pay the cost. I also knew I could walk away. No one forces you to wear out seven pairs of iron shoes. You put them on because there is something greater and more valuable than your comfort and safety, than the years of your life that are poured out, at the end.\n I did not know the journey would take ten years. I did not know how thoroughly the book would break me. I threw out three drafts\u2014one of them twice the length of the published version\u2014and rewrote the entire book four times, twice in longhand. And when I finally became the writer and artist and human being that the book needed, when I was satisfied with my work and the book was complete, every single major and minor publishing house rejected it.\n I had to make peace with the fact that the best thing I\u2019d ever written most likely would never see the light of day. That was difficult. I made my peace with it. After a year and a half on submission, I thanked my agent for his tremendous efforts and unwavering kindness and told him I thought it was time to give up.\n He refused.\n The morning that \u201cThe Valley of Wounded Deer\u201d was published, I got out of bed in Ottawa, in the home of a kind and talented writer who has walked a similar road, to find an email from my agent. He had some news.\n It was another month before I believed him.\n Looking over some of your prior interviews, I get the sense of you as a person who dives deep into research and likes to get hands-on and experiential, if possible. What were some of the things you found (or did) that didn\u2019t make it into this book?\n I started researching this book in 2010 and finished the last major draft in 2018. I\u2019m afraid I have forgotten almost as much as I\u2019ve learned, especially the Persian. I also had five interstate moves in that period, so my notes are in disarray, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve retained all my notebooks. But being chased by a pair of snarling, red-eyed dogs down the muddy side of a hill fort in Kabul was certainly an unforgettable experience.\n Do you have any advice for new writers?\n Trust the still small voice at your center. It will advise you better than anyone else.\n Is another book on the way? What\u2019s next, what\u2019s coming up for you, or what are you working on that you can tell readers about?\n At the moment, I\u2019m collaborating on a short opera with Steven Tran for the Seattle Opera, as part of their Jane Lang Davis Creation Lab. This too has been a longtime dream.\n Arley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

Boy or girl?\u201d\nI would have answered, if I thought it really mattered to him. But we were off shore by then, headed for the Lump, and he was just making conversation, knowing how long it would take us to get there. He didn\u2019t care whether I\u2019d be male or female, I\u2019d still be his pal Lolo. I could feel the boat listening, but she knew I didn\u2019t want her talking, that I\u2019d turn her off if she went too far.\nSo I kept steering the Mary Magdalena and said I didn\u2019t know, and it didn\u2019t matter, unless we did manage to cash in on the Lump before the corp-strippers got there. After that we were silent again, and everything was just the engine rumble moving up through my feet. Jorge Felipe turned over in the hammock we\u2019d managed to fit into the cabin, hammering the nails into the paneling to hang the hooks. He let out something that was either snore or fart or maybe both.\nJorge Felipe was the one who had found out about the Lump. It was four or five kilometers across, the guy who\u2019d spotted it said. Four or five kilometers of prime debris floating in the ocean, bits of old plastic and wood and Dios knew what else, collected by the currents, amassed in a single spot. All salvageable, worth five new cents a pound. Within a week, the corp-stripper boats would be out there, disassembling it and shoveling all that money into company machines, company mouths.\nBut we were going to get there first, carve off a chunk, enough to pay us all off. I wanted to be able to Choose, and I couldn\u2019t do that until I could pay the medical bill. Niko said he wasn\u2019t saving for anything, but really he was\u2014there\u2019d be enough money that he could relax for a month and not worry about feeding his mother, his extended family.\nJorge Felipe just wanted out of Santo Nuevo. Any way he could escape our village was fine with him, and the first step in that was affording a ticket. He wanted to be out before storm season hit, when we\u2019d all be living on whatever we could manage until a new crop of tourists bloomed in the spring.\nWinter was lean times. Jorge Felipe, for all his placid snoring right now, feeling desperation\u2019s bite. That\u2019s why he was willing to cut me in, in exchange for use of the Mary Magdalena. Most of the time he didn\u2019t have much to say to me. I gave him the creeps, I knew. He\u2019d told Niko in order to have him tell me. But he didn\u2019t have any other friends with boats capable of going out to carve off a chunk of the Lump and bring it in for salvage. And on my side of things, I thought he was petty and mean and dangerous. But he knew the Lump\u2019s coordinates.\nI tilted my head, listened to the engines, checking the rhythms to make sure everything was smooth. The familiar stutter of the water pump from behind me was nothing to worry about, or the way the ballaster coughed when it first switched on. I knew all the Mary Magdalena\u2019s sounds. She\u2019s old, but she works, and between the hydroengines and the solar panels, she manages to get along.\nSometimes I used to imagine crashing her on a reef and swimming away, leaving her to be covered with birdshit and seaweed, her voice lasting, pleading, as long as the batteries held out. Sometimes I used to imagine taking one of the little cutting lasers, chopping away everything but her defenseless brainbox, deep in the planking below the cabin, then severing its inputs one by one, leaving her alone. Sometimes I imagined worse things.\nI inherited her from my uncle Fortunato. My uncle loved his boat like a woman, and she\u2019d do things for him, stretch out the last bit of fuel, turn just a bit sharper, that she wouldn\u2019t do for me or anyone else. Like an abandoned woman, pining for a lover who\u2019d moved on. I could have the AI stripped down and retooled, re-imprint her, but I\u2019d lose all her knowledge. Her ability to recognize me.\nI\u2019d left the cabin the way my uncle had it: his baseball cap hanging on the peg beside the doorway, his pin-up photos shellacked onto the paneling. Sometimes I thought about painting over the photos. But they reminded me of my uncle, reminded me not to forgive him. You would have thought they would have been enough, but maybe they just egged him on. Some people claim that\u2019s how it goes with porn, more and more until a man can\u2019t control himself.\nI can\u2019t say my experience has confirmed this.\nUncle Fortunato left me the Mary Magdalena from guilt, guilt about what he\u2019d done, guilt that his niece had decided to go sexless, to put away all of that rather than live with being female. I was the first in the village to opt for the Choice, but not the first in the world by a long shot. It was fashionable by then, and a lot of celebrities were having it done to their children for \u201ctherapeutic reasons.\u201d My grandmother, Mama Fig, said it was unnatural and against the Church\u2019s law, and every priest in the islands came and talked to me. But they didn\u2019t change my mind. There was a program funding it for survivors of sexual assault. That\u2019s how I got it paid for, even though I wouldn\u2019t tell them who did it.\nI couldn\u2019t have him punished. If they\u2019d put him away, my grandmother would have lost her only means of support. But I could take myself out of his grasp by making myself unfuckable. Neuter. Neuter until I wanted to claim a gender. They didn\u2019t tell me, though, that getting in was free, but getting out would cost. Cost a lot.\nWhen I first heard he\u2019d left the boat to me, I didn\u2019t want her. I let her sit for two weeks gathering barnacles at dock before I went down.\nI wouldn\u2019t have ever gone, but the winter was driving me crazy. No work to be found, nothing to do but sit home with my grandmother and listen to her worry about her old friend\u2019s children and her favorite soap opera\u2019s plotlines.\nWhen I did go to the Mary Magdalena, she didn\u2019t speak until I came aboard. First I stood and looked at her. She\u2019s not much, all told: boxy, thirty years out of date, a dumbboat once, tweaked into this century.\nI used to imagine pouring acid on her deck, seeing it eat away with a hiss and a sizzle.\nAs I made my way up the gangplank, I could feel that easy sway beneath my feet. There\u2019s nothing like being on a boat, and I closed my eyes just to feel the vertigo underfoot like a familiar friend\u2019s hand on my elbow.\nI used to imagine her torn apart by magnets, the bolts flying outward like being dismantled in a cartoon.\n\u201cLaura,\u201d a speaker said, as though I hadn\u2019t been gone for six years, as though she\u2019d seen me every day in between. \u201cLaura, where is your uncle?\u201d\nI used to imagine her disintegrated, torn apart into silent atoms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Laura anymore,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s Lolo. I\u2019m gender neutral.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a Net connection,\u201d I said. \u201cSearch around on \u201cgender neutral\u201d and \u201cbiomod operation.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t sure if the pause that came after that was for dramatic effect or whether she really was having trouble understanding the search parameters. Then she said, \u201cAh, I see. When did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cSix years ago.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is your uncle?\u201d\n\u201cDead,\u201d I said flatly. I hoped that machine intelligences could hurt and so I twisted the knife as far as I could. \u201cStabbed in a bar fight.\u201d\nHer voice always had the same flat affect, but I imagined/hoped I could hear sorrow and panic underneath. \u201cWho owns me now?\u201d\n\u201cI do. Just as long as it takes me to sell you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t, Laura.\u201d\n\u201cLolo. And I can.\u201d\n\u201cThe licenses to operate\u2014the tourism, the sport-fishing, even the courier license\u2014they won\u2019t transfer to a new owner. They won\u2019t pay much for a boat they can\u2019t use.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019d fetch a decent amount as scrap.\u201d\nShe paused again. \u201cKeep me going, Lolo, and you can take in enough to keep yourself and Mama Fig going. Your uncle had ferrying contracts, and every season is good for at least a couple of trips with very cheap or eccentric tourists.\u201d\nShe had grace enough not to push beyond that. I didn\u2019t have much choice, and it was the only way to support my grandmother and myself month to month. With the Mary Magdalena, I was better off than Niko or Jorge Felipe by far. I could afford the occasional new shirt or record, rather than something scavenged.\nAt the end of a year, we\u2019d reached an agreement. Most of the time now the boat knew better than to talk to me. She could have been with me everywhere. Button mikes gleamed along the front railing, in the john, even in the little lifeboat that hugged the side. But she stayed silent except in the cabin, where she would tell me depths, weather, water temperature. I told her which way to go. Businesslike and impersonal.\nNiko went out on deck. I didn\u2019t blame him. It was too warm in the cabin. I knew the Mary Magdalena would alert me if there was any trouble, but I liked to keep an eye on things.\nJorge Felipe stirred, stuck his head out over the hammock\u2019s edge. His dark hair stuck out in all directions, like broken broom straws.\n\u201cMorning yet?\u201d he rasped.\n\u201cCouple more hours.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Niko?\u201d\n\u201cWent to smoke.\u201d\nHe grunted. \u201cShit, it\u2019s hot in here,\u201d he said. He swung his legs out from under the blanket\u2019s basketweave, thumped onto the floor. \u201cWe got soup left?\u201d\n\u201cThermos in the cupboard.\u201d\nBehind me the microwave beeped out protests as he thumbed its controls. The display was a steady, grainy green, showing me the surface far below the boat. Drifts and ridges. They said you could spot a wreck by the unnatural straightness of a line, the oddness of a corner. Unlikely, but it had been heard of, in that friend-of-a-cousin-of-a-neighbor\u2019s sort of way.\n\u201cHeat me one,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSoup or coffee?\u201d\n\u201cCoffee,\u201d I said, and he clanked another mug into the microwave.\nNiko came into the doorway. \u201cMermaids out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBe careful if you swim.\u201d\nJorge Felipe handed me my mug, so hot it almost bit into my skin as I cupped it.\n\u201cFucking mermaids,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate them even worse than sharks. One tangled with my sister, almost killed her.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone on the island\u2019s tangled with your sister. I\u2019m getting coffee and going back out,\u201d Niko said, and did.\nJorge Felipe watched him go. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking obsessed with those mermaids.\u201d\nMermaids. Back before I was born, there were more tourists. There\u2019s always tourists now, but not quite as many. Some of them came here specifically, even, for the beaches. Or for the cheap black-market bio-science. And one black-market bio-scientist specialized in making mermaids out of them.\nThey paid a lot for it, I guess. A moddie body that they could go swimming in, pretend like they were always sea creatures. It was very popular one year, Mama Fig said.\nBut the scientist, he wasn\u2019t that good, or that thorough. Or maybe he didn\u2019t understand all the implications of the DNA he was using. Some people said he did it deliberately.\nBecause mermaids lay eggs, hundreds at a time, at least that kind did. And the natural-born ones, they didn\u2019t have human minds guiding them. They were like sharks\u2014they ate, they killed, they ate. Most of the original human mermaids had gotten out when they found out that the seas were full of chemicals, or that instead of whale songs down there, they heard submarine sonar and boat signals. When the last few found out that they were spawning whether they liked it or not, they got out too. Supposedly one or two stayed, and now they live in the sea with their children, twice as mean as any of them.\nI said, \u201cWatch the display for me\u201d and went up on deck. The sun was rising, slivers of gold and pink and blue in the east. It played over the gouges in the Mary Magdalena\u2019s railing where I\u2019d picked at it with a knife, like smallpox marks along the boat\u2019s face.\nNiko was watching the water. Light danced over it, intense and dazzling. Spray rode the wind, stinging the eyes. I licked salt from my drying lips.\n\u201cWhere are you seeing them?\u201d I asked.\nHe pointed, but I didn\u2019t see anything at first. It took several moments to spot a flick of fins, the intercepted shadow as a wave rose and fell.\n\u201cYou see them out this deep all the time,\u201d I said. Niko hadn\u2019t been out on the boat much. He got nauseous anywhere out past ten meters, but Jorge Felipe had enlisted him to coax me into cooperating, had supplied him with fancy anti-nausea patches. I looked sideways. One glistened like a chalky gill on the side of his neck.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d he said, staring at the water. He wasn\u2019t watching me, so I looked at his face, trying to commit the details to memory. Trying to imagine him as a photograph. His jaw was a smooth line, shadowed with stubble. The hairs in front of his ears tangled in curls, started to corkscrew, blunted by sleep. He had long eyelashes, longer than mine. The sun tilted further up and the dazzle of light grew brighter, till it made my eyes hurt.\n\u201cPut on a hat,\u201d I said to Niko. \u201cGoing to be hot and bad today.\u201d\nHe nodded but stayed where he was. I started to say more, but shrugged and went back in. It was all the same to me. Still, when I saw his straw hat on the floor, I nudged it over to Jorge Felipe and said, \u201cTake this out to Niko when you go.\u201d\nLooking out over the railing, I spotted the three corp ships long before we got to the Lump. For a moment I wondered why they were so spread out, and then I realized the Lump\u2019s size. It was huge \u2014 kilometers wide. The ships were gathered around it, and their buzz boats were resting, wings spread out to recharge the solar panels.\nThey must have seen us around the same time. A buzz boat folded its wings, shadows spider-webbed with silver, and approached us. As it neared, I saw the Novagen logo on its side, on its occupant\u2019s mirrored helmet.\n\u201cThis is claimed salvage,\u201d the logo-ed loudspeaker said.\nI cupped my hands to shout back, \u201cSalvage\u2019s not claimed till you\u2019ve got tethers on it. Unless you\u2019re pulling in the whole thing, we\u2019ve got a right to chew on it, too.\u201d\n\u201cClaimed salvage,\u201d the pilot repeated. He looked the Mary Magdalena up and down and curled his lip. Most of the time I liked her shitty, rundown look, but pride bristled briefly. \u201cYou want to be careful, kid. Accidents happen out here when freelancers get in the way.\u201d\nI knew they did. Corp ships liked to sink the competition, and they had a dozen different underhanded ways to do it.\nJorge Felipe said at my elbow, \u201cGonna let them chase us off?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, but I nodded at the pilot and said, \u201cMary Magdalena, back us off.\u201d\nWe moved round to the other side.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Niko asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to cut the engines and let the currents creating the Lump pull us into it,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re watching for engine activity. After it gets dark, they won\u2019t notice us cutting. In the meantime, we\u2019ll act like we\u2019re fishing. Not even act, really.\u201d\nWe broke out fishing gear. The mermaids had deserted us, and I hoped to find a decent school of something, bottom-feeders at least. But the murk around the Lump was lifeless. Plastic tendrils waved like uneasy weed, gobbling our hooks till the rods bent and bowed with each wave.\nI wanted the corp ships to see our lines. Every hour, a buzz boat would whoosh by, going between two of the larger ships.\nWhen the sun went down, I went below deck. The others followed. I studied the weather readout on the main console\u2019s scratched metal flank.\nIt took longer than I thought, though. By the time we\u2019d managed to cut our chunk free with the little lasers, draining the batteries, the sun was rising. Today was cloudier, and I blessed the fog. It\u2019d make us harder to spot.\nWe worked like demons, throwing out hooks, cutting lumps free, tossing them into the cargo net. We looked for good stuff, electronics with precious metals that might be salvaged, good glass, bit of memorabilia that would sell on the Internet. Shellfish\u2014we\u2019d feed ourselves for a week out of this if nothing else. Two small yellow ducks bobbed in the wake of a bottle wire lacing. I picked them up, stuck them in my pocket.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Jorge Felipe at my elbow.\n\u201cWhat was what?\u201d I was hauling in orange netting fringed with dead seaweed.\n\u201cWhat did you stick in your pocket?\u201d His eyes tightened with suspicion.\nI fished the ducks out of my pocket, held them out. \u201cYou want one?\u201d\nHe paused, glancing at my pocket.\n\u201cDo you want to stick your hand in?\u201d I said. I cocked my hip towards him. He was pissing me off.\nHe flushed. \u201cNo. Just remember\u2014we split it all. You remember that.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an eagle, native to the islands, We call them brown-wings. Last year I\u2019d seen Jorge Felipe dealing with docked tourists, holding one.\n\u201cWant to buy a bird?\u201d he asked, sitting in his canoe looking up at the tan and gold and money-colored boat. He held it up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an endangered species, son,\u201d one tourist said. His face, sun-reddened, was getting redder.\nJorge looked at him, his eyes flat and expressionless. Then he reached out with the bird, pushed its head underwater for a moment, pulled it out squawking and thrashing.\nThe woman screeched. \u201cMake him stop!\u201d\n\u201cWant to buy a bird?\u201d Jorge Felipe repeated.\nThey couldn\u2019t throw him money fast enough. He let the brown-wing go and it flew away. He bought us all drinks that night, even me, but I kept seeing that flat look in his eyes. It made me wonder what would have happened if they\u2019d refused.\nBy the time the buzz boats noticed us, we were underway. They could see what we had in tow and I had the Mary Magdalena monitoring their radio chatter.\nBut what I hoped was exactly what happened. We were small fry. We had a chunk bigger than I\u2019d dared think, but that wasn\u2019t even a thousandth of what they were chewing down. They could afford to let a few scavengers bite.\nAll right, I thought, and told the Mary Magdalena to set a course for home. The worst was over.\nI didn\u2019t realize how wrong I was.\nNiko squatted on his heels near the engines, watching the play of sunlight over the trash caught in the haul net. It darkened the water, but you could barely see it, see bits of plastic and bottles and sea wrack submerged underneath the surface like an unspoken thought.\nI went to my knees beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\nHe stared at the water like he was waiting for it to tell him something.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quiet,\u201d he said.\nJorge Felipe was atop of the cabin, playing his plastic accordion. His heels, black with dirt, were hooked under the rungs of the ladder. I\u2019d let the plastic fray there, and bits bristled and splayed like an old toothbrush. His music echoed out across the water for kilometers, the only sound other than splash or mermaid whistle.\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d I said, somewhere between statement and question.\n\u201cGives you time to think.\u201d\n\u201cThink about what?\u201d\n\u201cI was born not too far from here.\u201d He stared at the twitch and pluck in the sun-splattered water.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\nHe turned to look at me. His eyes were chocolate and beer and cinnamon. \u201cMy mother said my dad was one of them.\u201d\nI frowned. \u201cOne of what?\u201d\n\u201cA mermaid.\u201d\nI had to laugh. \u201cShe was pulling your leg. Mermaids can\u2019t fuck humans.\u201d\n\u201cBefore he went into the water, idiot.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd when he came out?\u201d\n\u201cShe said he never came out.\u201d\n\u201cSo you think he\u2019s still there? Man, all those rich folks, once they learned that the water stank and glared, they gave up that life. If he didn\u2019t come out, he\u2019s dead.\u201d\nI was watching the trash close to us when I saw what had sparked this thought. The mermaids were back. They moved along the net\u2019s edge. It shuddered as they tugged at it.\n\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cPicking at it,\u201d Niko said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching. They pick bits off. What for, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see them around the Lump. Why now?\u201d\nNiko shrugged. \u201cMaybe all that trash is too toxic for them. Maybe that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t see any fish near it either. Here it\u2019s smaller. Tolerable.\u201d\nJorge Felipe slid onto his heels on the deck.\n\u201cWe need to drive them off,\u201d he said, frowning at our payload.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Niko protested. \u201cThere\u2019s just a few. They\u2019re picking off the loose stuff that makes extra drag, anyhow. Might even speed us up.\u201d\nJorge Felipe gave him a calculating look. The look he\u2019d given the tourist. But all he said was, \u201cAll right. That changes, let me know.\u201d\nHe walked away. We stood there, listening to the singing of the mermaids.\nI thought about reaching out to take Niko\u2019s hand, but what would it have accomplished? And what if he pulled away? Eventually I went back in to check our course.\nBy evening, the mermaids were so thick in the water that I could see our own Lump shrinking, dissolving like a tablet in water.\nJorge Felipe came out with his gun.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Niko said.\nJorge Felipe smiled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to shoot them, Niko, then they\u2019re taking it off your share. You agree it\u2019s mine, and I won\u2019t touch a scale.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d I objected. \u201cHe worked as hard as us pulling it in.\u201d\nJorge Felipe aimed the gun at the water.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Niko told me.\nI thought to myself that I\u2019d split my share with him. I wouldn\u2019t have enough for the Choice, but I\u2019d be halfway. And Niko would owe me. That wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.\nI knew what Choice I\u2019d make. Niko liked boys. I liked Niko. A simple equation. That\u2019s what the Choice is supposed to let you do. Pick the sex you want, when you want it. Not have it forced on you when you\u2019re not ready.\nThe Mary Magdalena sees everything that goes on within range of her deck cameras. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised me when I went back into the cabin and she said, \u201cYou like Niko, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I said. I watched the display. The mermaids wavered on it like fleshy shadows.\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust Jorge Felipe.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do I. I still want you to shut up.\u201d\n\u201cLolo,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you ever forgive me for what happened?\u201d\nI reached over and switched her voice off.\nStill, it surprised me when Jorge Felipe made his move. I\u2019d switched on auto-pilot, decided to nap in the hammock. I woke up to find him fumbling through my clothes.\n\u201cWhat you pick up, huh? What did you find out in the water?\u201d he hissed. His breath stank of old coffee and cigarettes and the tang of metal.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find anything,\u201d I said, pushing him away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true what they say, eh? No cock, no cunt.\u201d His fingers rummaged.\nI tried to shout but his other hand was over my mouth.\n\u201cWe all want this money, eh?\u201d he said. \u201cBut I need it. You can keep on being all freaky, mooning after Niko. And he can keep on his own loser path. Me, I\u2019m getting out of here. But I figure you, you don\u2019t want to be messed with. Your share, or I\u2019m fucking you up worse than you are already.\u201d\nIf I hadn\u2019t turned off her voice, the Mary Magdalena would have warned me. But she hadn\u2019t warned me before.\n\u201cAre you going to be good?\u201d Jorge Felipe asked. I nodded. He released my mouth.\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to sail with you, ever again.\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cWorld\u2019s a whoooooole lot bigger than this, freaky chicoca. Money\u2019s going to buy me a ticket out.\u201d\nI remembered the gun. How far would he go in securing his ticket? \u201cAll right,\u201d I said. My mouth tasted like the tobacco stains on his fingers.\nHis lips were hot on my ear. \u201cOkay then, chicoca. Stay nice and I\u2019ll be nice.\u201d\nI heard the door open and close as he left. Shaking, I untangled myself from the hammock and went to the steering console. I turned on the Mary Magdalena\u2019s voice.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust him,\u201d she said.\nI laughed, panic\u2019s edge in my voice. \u201cNo shit. Is there anyone I can trust?\u201d\nIf she\u2019d been a human, she might have said \u201cme.\u201d\nBeing a machine, she knew better. There was just silence.\nWhen I was little, I loved the Mary Magdalena and being aboard her. I imagined she was my mother, that when Mami had died, she\u2019d chosen not to go to heaven, had put her soul in the boat to look after me.\nI loved my uncle too. He let me steer the boat, sitting on his lap, let me run around the deck checking lines and making sure the tack was clean, let me fish for sharks and rays. One time, coming home under the General Domingo Bridge, he pointed into the water.\nAt first it looked as though huge brown bubbles were coming up through the water. Then I realized it was rays, maybe a hundred, moving through the waves.\nGoing somewhere, I don\u2019t know where.\nHe waited until I was thirteen. I don\u2019t know why. I was as skinny and unformed that birthday as I had been the last day I was twelve. He took me out on the Mary Magdalena and waited until we were far out at sea.\nHe raped me. When he was done, he said if I reported it, he\u2019d be put in jail. My grandmother would have no one to support her.\nI applied for Free Agency the next day. I went to the clinic and told them what had been done. That it had been a stranger, and that I wanted to become Ungendered. They tried to talk me out of it. They\u2019re legally obliged to, but I was adamant. So they did it, and for a few years I lived on the streets. Until they came and told me my uncle was dead. The Mary Magdalena, who had remained silent, was mine.\nI could hear Jorge Felipe out on the deck, playing his accordion again. I wondered what Niko was doing. Watching the water.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d I said to myself. But the boat thought responded.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust him.\u201d\n\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said.\nOn the display. the mermaids\u2019 fuzzy shadows intersected the garbage\u2019s dim line. I wondered what they wanted, what they did with the plastic and cloth they pulled from us. I couldn\u2019t imagine that anyone kept anything, deep in the sea, beyond the water in their gills and the blood in their veins.\nWhen Jorge Felipe went in to make coffee, I squatted beside Niko. He was watching the mermaids still. I said, urgently, \u201cNiko, Jorge Felipe may try something before we land. He wants your share and mine. He\u2019d like the boat, too. He\u2019s a greedy bastard.\u201d\nNiko stared into the water. \u201cDo you think my dad\u2019s out there?\u201d\n\u201cAre you high?\u201d\nHis pupils were big as flounders. There was a mug on the deck beside him. \u201cDid Jorge Felipe bring that to you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. He reached for it, but I threw the rest overboard.\n\u201cGet hold of yourself, Niko,\u201d I said. \u201cIt could be life or death. We\u2019ve got sixteen hours to go. He won\u2019t try until we\u2019re a few hours out. He\u2019s lazy.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t tell whether or not I\u2019d gotten through. His cheeks were angry from the sun. I went inside and grabbed my uncle\u2019s old baseball hat, and took it out to him. He was dangling an arm over the side. I grabbed him, pulled him back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get bit or dragged over,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d\nJorge Felipe grinned out of the cabin. \u201cHaving a good time there, Niko? You wanna go visit dad, go splashy splashy?\u201d He wiggled his fingers at Niko.\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Niko.\u201d\nSomething flapped in the water behind us and we all turned. A huge mermaid, half out of the water, pulling itself onto the trash\u2019s mass. I couldn\u2019t tell what it was trying to do\u2014grab something? Mate with it?\nThe gun went off. The mermaid fell back as Niko yelled like he\u2019d been shot. I turned, seeing the gun leveling on Niko, unable to do anything as it barked. He jerked, falling backward into the cargo net\u2019s morass.\nHis hands beat the water like dying birds. Something pulled him under, maybe the mermaids, maybe just the net\u2019s drag.\nI tried to grab him, but Jorge Felipe\u2019s hand was in my collar pulling me back with a painful blow to my throat. The hurt doubled me over, grabbing for breath through the bruise\u2019s blaze.\n\u201cToo bad about Niko,\u201d Jorge Felipe said. \u201cBut I need you to keep piloting. Go inside and stay out of trouble.\u201d He pushed me towards the cabin and I stumbled into it, out of the wind and the sound of the water.\nI stood, trying to catch my breath, my hands on the panels. I wondered if Niko had drowned quickly. I wondered if that was how Jorge Felipe intended to kill me. All around, the boat hummed and growled, mechanical sounds that had once felt as safe as being inside my mother\u2019s womb.\nI waited for her to say something, anything. Was she waiting for me to ask her help? Or did she know there was nothing she could do?\nUnderneath the hum, I could hear the mermaids singing, a whine that echoed through the metal, crept into the Mary Magdalena\u2019s habitual drone.\nWhen I said, \u201cHow much farther?\u201d she didn\u2019t pretend she didn\u2019t understand the question.\n\u201cFifteen hours, twenty minutes.\u201d\n\u201cAny weapons on board I don\u2019t know about?\u201d I pictured my uncle having something, anything. A harpoon gun or a shark knife. Something wicked and deadly and masculine.\nBut she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The same flat voice she always used.\nI could have wept then, but that was girlish. I was beyond that. I was the master of the Mary Magdalena. I would kill Jorge Felipe somehow, and avenge my friend.\nHow, I didn\u2019t know.\nOutside splashing, something caught in the netting. I pushed my way out the door as Jorge Felipe stared down into the water. I shoved my way past him, unsure for a moment whether or not he\u2019d hinder me. Then his hands were beside me, helping me pull a gasping Niko onto the boat.\n\u201cWelcome back, man,\u201d he said as Niko doubled over on hands and knees, spewing water and bile across the decking.\nFor a moment I thought, of course, everything would be fine. He\u2019d reconsidered killing us. We\u2019d pull into port, sell the cargo, give him the money and go our separate ways.\nI saw him guessing at my thoughts. All he did was rest his hand on his gun and smile at me. He could see the fear come back, and it made him smile harder.\nBehind me, Niko gasped and sputtered. There was another sound beside the hiss and slap of the waves. Mary Magdalena, whispering, whispering. What was she saying to him? What was going on in his head, what had he seen in his time underwater? Had the mermaids come and stared in his face, their eyes as blank as winter, his father there, driven mad by solipsism and sea song, looking at his son with no thoughts in his head at all?\nI stood, Jorge Felipe looking at me. If I locked myself in the cabin, how long would it take him to break in? But he gestured me away as I stepped towards the door.\n\u201cNot now,\u201d he said, and the regret in his tone was, I thought, for the time he\u2019d have to spend at the wheel, awake, more than anything else.\nShe was whispering, still whispering, to Niko. Why hadn\u2019t she warned me? She must have known what was brewing like a storm beneath the horizon. I couldn\u2019t have been the first.\nI started to turn to Jorge Felipe, Mary Magdalena\u2019s voice buzzing under my nerves like a bad light bulb. Then weight shifting on the deck, Niko\u2019s footprints squelching forward as he grabbed at Jorge Felipe, backpedaling until they fell together over the side in a boil of netting and mermaids.\nIn a fairytale, the mermaids would have brought Niko back to the surface while they held Jorge Felipe down below, gnawing at him with their sharp parrot beaks. In some stories, dolphins rescued drowning sailors, back when dolphins were still alive. And whales spoke to the fishing boats they swam beside, underneath clear-skied stars, in waters where no mermaids sang.\nBut instead no one surfaced. I turned the boat in great circles, spining the cargo net over and over again. Finally I told the Mary Magdalena to take us home. It had started to rain, the sullen sodden rain that means winter is at elbow\u2019s length.\nI took the yellow ducks out of my pocket and put them on the console. What did Jorge Felipe think I\u2019d found? I stared at the display and the slow shift and fuzz of the earth\u2019s bones, far below the cold water.\n\u201cWhat did you tell Niko?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI told him that his father would be killed if he didn\u2019t defend him from Jorge Felipe. And I activated my ultrasonics. They acted on his nervous system.\u201d\nI shuddered. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt as well?\u201d\n\u201cThere should be no lasting effects.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. I stirred three sugar packets and powdered cream into my coffee. It was almost too hot to drink when it came out of the microwave, but I cupped it in my fingers, grateful for its heat.\nI could have slept. But every time I laid down in the hammock, I smelled Jorge Felipe, and thought I heard him climbing out of the water.\nFinally I went out and watched the water behind us. The Mary Magdalena played the radio for me, a soft salsa beat with no words I could understand. It began to rain, and I heard the sound of raindrops on the decking beside me, pattering on the plastic sheeting I drew over my head.\nBy the time I arrived back in port, the mermaids had plucked away all but a few tangles of seawrack from the netting. I\u2019d be lucky to net the cost of a cup of coffee, let alone cover the fuel I\u2019d used. Never mind. A few more seasons and I\u2019d have the money I needed, if I was careful. If there were no disasters.\nNeither body was there in the net. Perhaps Niko\u2019s father had reclaimed him.\nThe wind and rain almost knocked me off the deck as I stared into the water. The green netting writhed like barely visible guilt in the darkness.\nThe Mary Magdalena called after me, as she had not dared in years. \u201cSleep well, Lolo. My regards to Grandma Fig.\u201d\nI stopped and half turned. I could barely see her lines through the driving rain.\nSometimes I used to imagine setting her on fire. Sometimes I used to imagine taking her out to a rift and drilling holes in the hull. Sometimes I used to imagine her smashed by waves, or an earthquake, or a great red bull stamping through the streets.\nBut the winter was long, and it would be lonely sitting at home with my grandmother. Lonelier than time at sea with her, haunted by the mermaids\u2019 music.\n\u201cGood night, Mary Magdalena,\u201d I said.\nCat Rambo lives, writes, and edits from atop a hill in the Pacific Northwest.

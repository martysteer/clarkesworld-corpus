It was the open spaces. The too-muchness of air, of movement, of sound. Even here, I catch myself making my body small, as small as possible. The plaza is nearly empty\u2014this is only a village, after all\u2014and yet I feel exposed, worried about the boundlessness of sky, like something up above has been broken open. At least the day is overcast, the clouds low. I find that comforting, somehow. There is a chill in the air.\n I see someone walking fast towards me, their step sure, as if they\u2019ve recognized me. A young-man-shaped person, lean and wiry. A full head taller than me, which is hardly a surprise. Sunburned skin and high cheekbones, dark hair down to their ears, arms chiseled and bare, despite the chill.\n They extend an arm to greet me. \u201cYou must be Lucia\u2019s cousin!\u201d they say. \u201cMy name is Jo\u00e3o. He/him. I\u2019m your promised guide.\u201d\n \u201cFabiano,\u201d I say. It still feels good. \u201cHe/him.\u201d I press my hand into his awkwardly, as if I\u2019ve forgotten how to shake.\n \u201cYour hands are cold, Fabiano,\u201d he says and smiles with his eyes.\n He leads me to the village\u2019s only guesthouse, where we\u2019ll spend the night. There is nothing to do here\u2014this village, like every other village in the region, was mostly abandoned sometime during the war, the majority of its inhabitants either dead or vanished\u2014so we sit in our host\u2019s kitchen, next to the stove. She places black coffee and flatbreads in front of us and retreats to a room in the back, separated from the kitchen with strings of beads hanging in a doorless frame.\n I am told that we need to start early the next morning, if we want to be at the next village before dark. \u201cThat\u2019s where you say your friend was last seen, correct?\u201d Jo\u00e3o asks me, his mouth half-full of bread.\n \u201cYes,\u201d I say. I take a sip of coffee. Its bitterness bites my throat.\n \u201cWhat was her name again?\u201d\n \u201cBeatrice.\u201d We picked it together. It took us weeks. I kept coming up with lists upon lists, mostly baby name ideas I pulled off the Internet, but she didn\u2019t like any of them. Said it felt weird to have a name; she\u2019d never had one before. Then I showed her a painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and she asked me what that redheaded woman\u2019s name was, and that was it. She never told me what it was about her that stuck, and I knew better than to ask.\n Jo\u00e3o nods. He eats and drinks quietly for a while. His face, illuminated only by the light of the stove, reminds me of that same painting. Golden and warm, like a proper pre-Raphaelite.\n \u201cWe should sleep,\u201d he says then, and warns me again about our early start the next morning.\n My room is Spartan: a thin-mattressed bed, a stool with a shallow basin filled with water, a small mirror nailed to the limewashed wall. I avoid my reflection and turn off the lamp.\n I wrap the itchy blanket around myself and shiver in the dark. Sleep escapes me for hours. I think of Beatrice, of the hole in the side of her neck and the first time she showed it to me. I can still feel the weight of her key in my palm. She told me she was ashamed. And I got it, even as I wished I didn\u2019t. I wished I could tell her there was nothing to be ashamed of, but I wasn\u2019t quite there yet myself, back then.\n Am I now?\n I close my eyes to the darkness and think of open spaces, the dread of them putting the question to rest.\n I wake up frozen. The cold has seeped through the walls overnight and settled on me like a shroud. I shake my body awake enough to give myself my injection and then shave the peach fuzz on my face. I do it slowly, carefully, my little biweekly ritual. I cherish the feeling of the shaving foam on my jawline, my cheeks, my chin, then the pressure of the razor against my skin. I spare only the tiny black hairs on my upper lip. They make me look like a teenage boy, but I don\u2019t care. I love them. I remember the shock that ran through me the first time I realized I loved something about my body. The radical newness of it enough to break the world apart, then put it back together again.\n Jo\u00e3o, full of warnings, has informed me that the hike to Castelalbano will be demanding and will take most of the day. I hesitate briefly before putting on my binder, but I can\u2019t bring myself to go out without it. Much worse than walking out the door naked, it would be like going out without my skin. So that settles it, I guess.\n He greets me in the kitchen, his wide smile and his dark eyes bright and alert, as if he\u2019s thrilled to be up at the crack of dawn and looking forward to a day of walking in the freezing cold. \u201cFabiano!\u201d he exclaims and points at a small mound of freshly-baked flatbreads and another cup of that coffee, no doubt as bitter as last night\u2019s. \u201cEat, drink,\u201d he orders. \u201cWe have a difficult day ahead.\u201d He beams at our host, who\u2019s stuffing wood into the stove. \u201cAnd we might not enjoy such hospitality again for some time.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d I ask, and it comes out more sarcastic than I intended. I would not be surprised if I found out later that our host had taken terrible offense. I\u2019m not usually like this. I feel my cheeks burn.\n Jo\u00e3o laughs. \u201cThe people of Castelalbano are not known for their warmth,\u201d he explains, without dropping that wide smile of his even for a moment. I catch myself staring at the shape of his lips, the way his moustache hugs the sides of his mouth, like a permanent frown painted onto his face, so much at odds with his disposition. It makes me want to touch his lips, see if I can wipe that frown away.\n When he\u2019s satisfied that I\u2019ve had enough to eat, he leads us out of the village and onto the path to Castelalbano.\n We walk without speaking for more than an hour before the sun peeks over the mountains that cradle us. My heart beats hard in my chest, my rib cage hurts, and Jo\u00e3o\u2019s pace is too fast for me. I keep up for another hour before I have to admit defeat. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to do strenuous exercise,\u201d I say. Not in a binder is what I mean, and I almost say so, but then I don\u2019t.\n He looks at me, confused. \u201cThis is not strenuous exercise,\u201d he says. He flexes his well-formed glutes, as if to underline the point.\n \u201cIt is for me,\u201d I reply, my tone as dry as December skin.\n His face drops, but only slightly. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll slow down.\u201d He starts to walk again, then stops and turns around to face me once more. He puts a hand on my shoulder and squeezes. His eyes are warm and not pitying at all and I\u2019m thankful for it. \u201cLet me know if it is still too hard. I should not have assumed.\u201d His face is flushed, and I know for sure it\u2019s not from the trek.\n \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d I say, and when he doesn\u2019t let go of my shoulder I repeat: \u201cIt is. Really.\u201d I try on a smile, and it must work because we\u2019re on our way again the next moment.\n I focus on my shoes for most of the journey, even when Jo\u00e3o points out rare plants or supplies crucial bits of information on the region and vivid details about how the war played out in this ravine or that. I listen to his voice but not to what he\u2019s saying, and all I can think of is the terrifying emptiness that stretches above us and what a miracle it is that we have our feet stuck to the ground, that we don\u2019t all go falling into the sky.\n Castelalbano supposedly owes its name to a white castle which turns out to be little more than a limestone watchtower that stands, half-crumbled, at the village\u2019s entrance. It is already dark when we see the top of the watchtower loom in the distance, its windows dark and empty.\n The power grid here was destroyed during the war and never repaired, so there are no lights in the streets, and the few inhabitants are probably already fast asleep in their beds. Our guest room for the night will be an abandoned barn.\n It is as cold inside the barn as it is outside, so we pick a corner as far from the entrance as possible and make ourselves a nest out of our sleeping bags and fleece blankets. We use a hurricane lamp for light. Jo\u00e3o opens his arms and invites me to make myself comfortable next to him. \u201cFor warmth,\u201d he adds with a smile when he sees me hesitate. So we huddle together for a while. My chest is killing me, though, and I can\u2019t stay like this forever, so I clench my teeth and ask him to turn around while I undress, slip out of my binder, and put my clothes back on as quickly as I can, my breath coming out in little puffs of steam.\n By the time I\u2019m done, I\u2019m shivering. \u201cOK,\u201d I say, \u201cyou can turn around again.\u201d\n He only glances at the bulge of my chest for a second before opening his arms and inviting me into the warm blankets again. \u201cCome on, boy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll freeze to death.\u201d\n It takes me a few minutes to stop shaking, but eventually I do. He seems to interpret that as an invitation of some sort. \u201cTell me about Beatrice,\u201d he says.\n What can I say of Beatrice? And how much can I tell him?\n \u201cWe met a couple of years ago, after the war had ended,\u201d I say. \u201cI found her wandering about in the city. She looked so lost. She had no one. Knew no one. So I took her in.\u201d I was not Fabiano yet, then. Her name was not the only one we came up with together. \u201cShe disappeared three months ago. She was my only friend. Taught me . . . \u201d I stop myself.\n \u201cTaught you what?\u201d\n \u201cNothing. Never mind,\u201d I say and he doesn\u2019t press me further.\n \u201cDo you have any idea why she left?\u201d he asks. \u201cOr what she was looking for?\u201d\n \u201cNo. And no.\u201d\n He nods, changes the subject. \u201cLucia said you were a student, before the war. What were you studying?\u201d\n \u201cReligion. Theater.\u201d\n \u201cBoth?\u201d\n I shrug. \u201cThey are not as far apart as you might think.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI have no religion. And I\u2019ve never been to the theater.\u201d\n \u201cSo what do you do when you\u2019re not showing city boys around the mountains?\u201d\n \u201cI go where I\u2019m needed.\u201d\n \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n \u201cSomebody has to rebuild this country,\u201d he says. \u201cThis world.\u201d\n His face grows serious for the first time since I met him. Sunny Jo\u00e3o. I thought his light never set, but here it is, the darkness that had to be there, somewhere. That is always there. How could it not, after everything?\n \u201cWho did you lose?\u201d I ask. \u201cIn the war.\u201d\n \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he asks back\u2014almost snaps, in fact, the way people do when they feel guilty about something. He looks away, and I can suddenly sense the openness again, the massive stretches of space above us, outside the barn, weighing down on us, threatening to crush us. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking for someone.\u201d\n It\u2019s my turn to be silent. I always find myself floored when people open up like this, even a little. Even without talking. The slightest sign of vulnerability or kindness and I\u2019m down on my knees, caught, surrendered.\n Beatrice used to say it\u2019s my greatest flaw. I haven\u2019t made up my mind yet about whether I agree or not.\n \u201cFabiano,\u201d he says after a while. I like the way my name sounds on his lips. \u201cDo people shorten your name a lot?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cFabio. Fab. All the time.\u201d\n He raises his hand with the palm towards me, the fingers close together, as if he\u2019s about to take an oath. \u201cI will never shorten your name, Fabiano,\u201d he says, so earnest, not a hint of irony in his voice, as if it\u2019s the most important promise he\u2019s made in his whole life.\n The people of Castelalbano live up to their reputation of guardedness, but Jo\u00e3o\u2019s warmth could melt a glacier; these people never stood a chance. He manages to get us directions, a bathroom in which to wash ourselves, even a rudimentary breakfast. Finally, we walk into the village\u2019s only coffee house, which transforms into a watering hole as the day progresses. Three people are seated at the plastic-covered tables, each one on their own. For the first time in a long time, I feel my body scrutinized, my visible queerness a weapon that can be used against me. I start thinking of these people as men, when I know I shouldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t help it. Jo\u00e3o remains relaxed, his arms at his sides, his face sure and open. It helps me relax a bit too, though I still keep two paces behind him as he approaches one of them. Jo\u00e3o gestures to the owner to brew fresh coffee for everyone and then motions towards the empty chairs at the man\u2019s table. \u201cMay we join you?\u201d he asks.\n The man grunts, and Jo\u00e3o takes a seat. He nods at me to join them, so I do. The man follows me with his eyes.\n The owner brings us the coffee, and we all drink before speaking, as is customary. \u201cGood health,\u201d Jo\u00e3o says. The black liquid is so hot it burns my tongue.\n \u201cTo you as well,\u201d the man responds. I have a feeling he doesn\u2019t mean both of us.\n Jo\u00e3o pulls out the photo of Beatrice I gave him. It\u2019s the only photo of her I have; she didn\u2019t like being photographed, except that one time, we went to the Luna Park. It had just reopened after the war. Beatrice didn\u2019t really enjoy any of the rides, the machinery of it all disturbed her, reminded her too much of the factory. Until we got on the Ferris wheel. I was terrified, of course, but she got so excited, like a child. I couldn\u2019t say no to her, so we went up. Her excitement made me forget I was afraid. She grounded me.\n Seeing the world from above shocked her and filled her with joy. She told me she\u2019d never felt happy before. She asked me to take her picture so she would remember what she looked like when she was happy. Then her hands did their little dance. I took them into mine, steadied them. \u201cHow do you keep going?\u201d I asked. She\u2019d found who she was beyond that which she was made to be. Gave herself a name and a life. And yet, her hands remembered.\n She smiled and shrugged. \u201cFactory settings are a starting point, Fabiano,\u201d she said, \u201cnot a destiny.\u201d\n \u201cEven if you keep breaking?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cEven if you keep breaking,\u201d she replied.\n I had the photo printed and framed, kept it on the mantelpiece above the fake fireplace in our living room.\n She didn\u2019t take it with her when she left.\n \u201cHave you seen this woman?\u201d Jo\u00e3o asks the man.\n He only has to glance at the photo before answering. Castelalbano does not have many visitors and Beatrice would stand out anywhere. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of those Artificials.\u201d\n Jo\u00e3o gives me a look, but, if he\u2019s surprised, or disapproving, he doesn\u2019t let it show.\n \u201cDo you know where she was going?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cShe was looking for the Last Eagle, she said. Heard of sightings in the area, wanted to see for herself. So we sent her to Santa Antonia.\u201d The man sips his coffee. \u201cBunch of Welder worshippers over there, the lot of them.\u201d\n Something in my gut twists, sending a wave of pain through my middle. I stand up, steady myself on the back of the chair. I feel light-headed. \u201cMay I use your washroom?\u201d I ask the owner.\n He almost laughs when he answers. \u201cCrapper\u2019s in the back,\u201d he says, nodding towards a narrow corridor through the kitchen.\n I paw my way through the corridor, leaning on the wall every few steps. My stomach churns as I pass a row of cured meats hanging from the ceiling. I keep going until I find the small room in the back. There is only a tiny window for light, and I find myself thankful for the darkness.\n I wipe the toilet as best I can and drop myself on the seat, pins and needles in my cheeks and my vision dancing with dark spots. I breathe deep, trying to calm myself down. Stay grounded. I run my palms over the bare skin on my thighs. The cold feels good.\n I panic when I see the blood on my briefs.\n What is happening to me, why am I bleeding?\n Then I remember, and panic turns to a sinking feeling like a rock tumbling through me, from my head to my lungs to my stomach. Bleeding is a thing my body still does, on occasion, especially when under stress.\n Have you been under any stress lately, Fabiano?\n I pack my underwear with toilet paper and splash water on my face, then make my way back as fast as I can.\n Jo\u00e3o is standing by the door. The men ignore us. \u201cAll good?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cFine.\u201d Perhaps some pallor on my face betrays me, perhaps not.\n We walk out.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a five-day walk to Santa Antonia,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you sure you are up for it? We can still turn back. You can change your mind.\u201d\n \u201cI am not changing my mind,\u201d I say, as steady as I can manage.\n He stares at me with his dark eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want you falling apart on me in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he says, low and calm.\n \u201cI\u2019m not falling apart!\u201d I protest\u2014a bit too much. My voice breaks into a squeak.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d Jo\u00e3o says. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n We leave Castelalbano behind\u2014its people peering at us behind drawn curtains, its streets deserted, its white castle watching us with its dark, empty windows.\n The next five days pass in a blur of exhaustion and low-volume agony. All I remember is thinking of Beatrice on these same steep paths, her legs straining, pausing now and then to wind herself up, or perhaps not. Perhaps she let her coil unwind all the way to the end. Perhaps she let her body tumble down some historic ravine. Perhaps she\u2019s still down there, all limbs and angles, like a broken doll. I did look down, I think I did. All I could see was sky.\n Or maybe that was the fever Jo\u00e3o says I ran the entire way to Santa Antonia. He claims I rambled, but, when I ask about what, he says it doesn\u2019t matter.\n When I\u2019m finally well again, we are settled in a warm room with rugs not only on the floors but draped all over the stone walls. It feels like a cocoon. The bed\u2014just one bed for the both of us\u2014is piled high with blankets. I catch myself thinking I could stay here forever, in this warmth, with Jo\u00e3o sleeping next to me. A snowstorm is raging outside, and our search is suspended until the weather clears.\n I can\u2019t stand to think what a snowstorm might mean for Beatrice, if she\u2019s still out there, somewhere.\n Jo\u00e3o brings me soup. I enjoy the bowl\u2019s warmth much more than the taste of the soup, but he\u2019s watching me, so I force myself to take a spoonful.\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about Beatrice?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cTell you what?\u201d\n \u201cThat she\u2019s one of Welder\u2019s creatures. A Worker, I assume?\u201d\n I poke at a piece of gray meat that\u2019s floating in my bowl. Goat, I think. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how you\u2019d take it,\u201d I say after a while, ashamed of how little credit I gave him. He\u2019s Lucia\u2019s friend, after all. She would never be friends with someone who could find Beatrice\u2019s existence offensive or unacceptable. \u201cNot everyone would be happy roaming the mountains in winter for a Worker. Some people still hold grudges, from the war.\u201d I pause. \u201cSome people wouldn\u2019t even consider Beatrice alive.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not some people,\u201d he says.\n \u201cI know,\u201d I reply. \u201cI know that now.\u201d\n \u201cDid she speak to you of the factory? What they did there, whether she knew what it was they were making, the ammunition?\u201d\n I remember those moments when she would get that absent look on her face and her hands would do their little dance in the air, like she was still screwing screws at the factory.\n I take another spoonful of soup. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like to talk about it,\u201d I say.\n \u201cAnd the Last Eagle?\u201d\n \u201cI was the one who first heard about it. A friend of a friend joined a Welder cult and was raving about animals still roaming the mountains. I told Beatrice. She thought if she found one of the animals, she might be able to find the Welder himself. I had no idea she was going to try. Not alone. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d I hand Jo\u00e3o the bowl of soup. It\u2019s still almost full, but I can\u2019t eat anymore. \u201cThis is all my fault.\u201d\n Jo\u00e3o leaves the bowl on the floor and pushes himself closer\u2014me under the blankets, he on top. \u201cIt\u2019s not. Fabiano. If you truly think of Beatrice as a person, then you\u2019ll allow her the freedom to choose for herself.\u201d\n That shuts me up good. Why didn\u2019t I ever think of it that way? I\u2019ve been so wrapped up in finding my friend and feeling sorry for myself, that I never stopped to consider what this might mean for Beatrice.\n Well done, Fabiano.\n Jo\u00e3o leans his back against the wall and stares at the window. I do the same. There\u2019s a thin film of snow caked on the glass. We\u2019re shut in here, the outside world obscured. I think after a while of this I could even forget it exists.\n \u201cHave you ever seen an animal?\u201d Jo\u00e3o asks. \u201cOne of Welder\u2019s?\u201d\n I shake my head. \u201cPeople say the city crawled with them before the war, but I\u2019ve never seen one, neither before nor after. And now they\u2019ve taken them all apart, anyway, used them for scraps,\u201d I say. \u201cHave you?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d he says. His voice sounds strange, distorted. \u201cAn antelope.\u201d He pauses for so long I think he won\u2019t speak again, but then he does. \u201cIt was during the war. I was hiding a group of fighters in a ravine not far from here. We were supposed to cross enemy lines, pass one of the villages on the way, and join a larger group on the other side. But there was a storm, and I got us lost. We crossed paths with another group. We didn\u2019t have any insignia on, and neither did they, so we didn\u2019t know if they were friends or enemies. We might have even been on the same side, tree-hugging anarchists and bleeding-heart posthumanists, all of us. It didn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t know who opened fire first, but we all ended up shooting at one another like idiots. Then the storm suddenly stopped, and there was this antelope. It came out of the bushes. Its joints made this awful creaking sound, like rusted metal scraping on metal. It was the most beautiful thing around, for miles. Broken and beautiful.\n \u201cIt paused and just stared at us. We stopped shooting, stared back. Then it turned around and disappeared into the bushes again.\u201d\n He closes his eyes and stays silent for a while, breathing deeply, as if to steady himself.\n \u201cThen what happened?\u201d I prompt him.\n \u201cNone of us said a word. Didn\u2019t look at each other. We hid our weapons and went our separate ways.\u201d He turns to look at me. \u201cI hope your Beatrice found what she was looking for,\u201d he says. Then he bends over and kisses me on the forehead, like we\u2019re friends, or more, like we\u2019ve known each other for years. \u201cSleep. I\u2019ll go talk to the people here, see if I can find out anything else.\u201d\n I wake up more rested than I\u2019ve been in months. There is a strange light coming into the room from the sheet of snow on the window. I can\u2019t tell what time it is. Jo\u00e3o is not next to me, and for a moment I panic, I think he left, too. But the clothes he wore in bed last night are folded neatly and draped over the back of the single chair in the room. I breathe. I get up and wash my face, then put on as many layers of clothes as I can and walk out. I hear voices from downstairs, and Jo\u00e3o\u2019s laughter, high and gurgling like a mountain stream. I follow the sounds.\n It\u2019s a celebration. There are young people juggling empty glass bottles and trousered aunties smoking pipes and singing polyphonic songs in a language I\u2019ve never heard before, their voices like flutes. Jo\u00e3o joins them. I\u2019m surprised he knows all the words. His singing voice is high, higher than I would have ever expected, and singing makes his cheeks stick out round and perfect, like small apples. Makes the skin on my face flush. I\u2019m almost envious of him, of the confidence with which he uses his voice; something I\u2019ve never been able to do, even after my voice dropped. He nods at me and I join the crowd, take a seat on a rush chair in the corner. The song fills me and I start tapping the rhythm on the table next to me.\n A small child approaches me. They have long braids that end in tassels made from colorful wool, a round face, and legs like twigs, bare despite the cold. The child climbs on my lap and wraps their arms around my neck. I stop tapping and wrap a protective arm around the child, keeping the rhythm with my leg instead. When the song ends, the crowd cheers and claps, everyone patting Jo\u00e3o on the shoulder or ruffling his hair in approval, like he\u2019s one of them. He\u2019s beaming at me and there is a bursting feeling in my chest, like I\u2019m proud of him, as if I can claim any stake to him.\n The child gives me a kiss on the cheek and then takes my hand. They open my palm and deposit a small metal object in it, then close my fingers around it, before climbing down and disappearing behind the gathered adults.\n Jo\u00e3o comes to sit next to me, his turn to wrap an arm around my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better,\u201d he shouts in my ear to be heard over the crowd\u2019s clamor, even though I haven\u2019t said a thing about how I feel.\n \u201cWhat do the songs say?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cThey praise the Great Welder in the sky,\u201d he replies, as if that answers anything.\n \u201cFor what?\u201d I ask, and he laughs. \u201cFor what?\u201d I repeat, elbowing him in the ribs.\n He doesn\u2019t reply. He simply opens his arms, as if to mean, everything. Everything around us that exists or is yet to exist. Then he gestures with his head to my hand. \u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d he asks.\n I had almost forgotten about the child\u2019s little gift, drunk by the weight of Jo\u00e3o\u2019s arm on me. I unfurl my fingers. A bullet is resting on my palm, tiny and perfect, like a flower.\n I never find out what it was we were celebrating. When the fun dies down and the crowd disperses, Jo\u00e3o takes me by the hand and leads me back to our room with soft, light steps. We crawl under the blankets on the bed and then take off all of our clothes while trying to keep our skins touching in as many places as possible and so it becomes like a dance, like one of those contact improv pieces I used to go to all the time when I was a student. I keep my binder on. I remember the dance Beatrice and I used to do sometimes in front of a mirror, twisting our bodies so that it looked like her head was mine, my keyhole-less neck hers.\n I trace the frown on Jo\u00e3o\u2019s face with my fingers and then his smile. His mouth is like a furnace, and for a moment I wish I could burn in there. I wish I were metal, melted down and transformed into something new, harder and unbreakable.\n The snowstorm takes ten days to clear, and we spend most of that time in our room, having awful goat soup, discovering each other\u2019s bodies, talking about things we remember from our very different childhoods\u2014like building your own kite to fly on Clean Monday (him), and buying sheets of sweet and sour candy called skins for pennies from the shop on the corner (me), or learning the name of every extinct species of animal, which was an impossible task (me), or being made to sit on a bucket warmed with coals when your tummy hurt (him).\n Then the time comes for us to move on, and I don\u2019t want to go. I wish we could stay here forever. I would learn how to speak Santa Antonia\u2019s language, I would praise the Great Welder in the sky for every little thing that exists in the world, and I would learn the lyrics to all their songs, even if I could never bring myself to sing them. I might even learn how to love things that are damaged and imperfect, like he does.\n I say so. Not everything. Just enough.\n He doesn\u2019t say anything in response. When he\u2019s done stuffing his backpack he glances around the room to make sure every trace of our stay here has been either packed or discarded, he touches me lightly on the shoulder and kisses my eyes.\n We move out.\n It will be another week before we reach the next shelter, and then another couple of days or so to reach the peak where the Last Eagle has been seen. We don\u2019t talk much on the way. Jo\u00e3o becomes more and more distant, or maybe I do. When we made love in Santa Antonia, for a moment I thought his dick was mine. I carry that euphoria with me for days. And the pain of it, of course. I avoid the sky as much as I can, but the crevasses that yawn on either side of our path do me no favors. I start thinking of depth as inverted height and my head spins.\n Jo\u00e3o retreats somewhere inside himself and grows agitated the higher we go. He scans the surroundings\u2014quick, furtive glances, as if he\u2019s scared of things that may be lurking in the bald mountains and empty cliff tops around us.\n There\u2019s no sign of Beatrice, the Last Eagle, or any other animal, but we do come across something the night before we reach the final shelter before the peak. From afar, it looks like a dark mass tucked in the curve between two giant rocks. Jo\u00e3o reaches it first and he just stands there, contemplating it.\n I come up behind him as fast as I can, panting. It\u2019s a nest made of razor wire. For what creature? I want to ask. For what offspring? I open my mouth to speak the words, but the sound of sobbing stops me. Jo\u00e3o is kneeling by the nest now, weeping. For what, for whom, I do not know. I put a hand on his back and he shakes it off. I wait patiently, let him be for as long as he needs, allow him the time and space to get it all out.\n When he stops crying, I give him my hand and this time he takes it. He\u2019s back on his feet, drying his eyes on the rough wool of his sleeve.\n \u201cMaybe you\u2019re not supposed to find her, you know,\u201d is all he says. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re supposed to let her go.\u201d\n I don\u2019t know what this means\u2014supposed by whom? Who decides?\u2014and I don\u2019t ask.\n The final shelter is little more than a wooden cabin large enough to house two, maybe three people, but no more. It\u2019s been almost a month since Castelalbano and I monitor my body, scrutinize the tiniest feeling in my guts, scared out of my mind that I\u2019ll bleed again.\n We make the little cabin as warm as we can by feeding logs to the woodburner. They are frozen solid, hiss angrily every time we add a new one to the fire.\n I don\u2019t bleed.\n The distance between Jo\u00e3o and myself closes slowly and we find each other\u2019s bodies again, little by little.\n The second night, when we\u2019re lying in bed together, he tells me I remind him of a boy he loved and lost in the war.\n \u201cWas he also such a mess?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he says. He gives me a look that makes me think he\u2019ll explain how me and that boy are different, but he doesn\u2019t. Instead, he adds: \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s the world that\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n Then he sings another of Santa Antonia\u2019s songs.\n I ask what the words mean, but he simply smiles and does not say.\n On the third morning, I tell him it\u2019s time.\n We climb for two days straight. It\u2019s hard, makes my bones feel like they\u2019re breaking, and I want to quit, but I keep going. We sleep only for the darkest hours of the night, pressed into tiny enclosures on the cliff face. I dream, though, for the first time since Beatrice left.\n In my dream, I find her in a church. It\u2019s not one I\u2019ve been to before, but it\u2019s high, so high I cannot see the ceiling\u2014it disappears far above us, into the clouds. Beatrice is sitting next to me in the pews. Someone is singing in a language I don\u2019t recognize. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d I ask her, but she just hands me a bullet and smiles. Then she stands up, and I notice the keyhole in her neck is gone.\n She turns around and points with her finger at the far end of the church. \u201cLook!\u201d she says. \u201cLook!\u201d\n I wake up before I can see what she was showing me. I say nothing of my dream to Jo\u00e3o.\n We go on climbing.\n And then, finally, we are at the peak. It\u2019s a barren spot, the ground underneath our feet hard, frozen solid. I take a deep breath and look around, at the space too vast to contemplate. There are clouds below us, and clouds above, and I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. My fingers reach for my neck, searching for a hole. Perhaps Beatrice did find what she was looking for. Perhaps it\u2019s true that we\u2019re not broken, that it\u2019s the world that breaks us. If I believe it, will I let her go? My heart beats fast. My mouth falls open and I don\u2019t even know whether I\u2019m trying to speak or sing or cry. A sound comes out like the sigh of a wind instrument\u2014something foreign and alarming and unrecognizable.\n Jo\u00e3o hugs me from behind, steadies me. And I come back to myself. I come back. I come back.\n We hear the music first. Old music-box melody, slightly broken, out of tune.\n Jo\u00e3o points at the sky. \u201cThere,\u201d he says. \u201cThere.\u201d\n There, the Last Eagle is soaring above us, its tarpaulin wings creaking in their pulley joints, its two wooden heads facing in opposite directions, as if saying what difference could coming or going possibly make? It used to be painted yellow, but now the color is chipped and falling away. It circles the peak once, twice, looking at us with one head and ignoring us with the other.\n Then, much too soon, it swerves left and flies away.\n Jo\u00e3o doesn\u2019t loosen his grip on me until he\u2019s sure there is no shaking left in my limbs, until my heart has slowed to a pace close to normal. The vast open space above no longer feels like it\u2019s going to swallow us whole. Or maybe it does, and I no longer care.\n I turn my head to look at him. His eyes are wet and shiny, looking in the direction of the Last Eagle now gone. He\u2019s still holding me, he doesn\u2019t let go. \u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he says of the crumbling thing, the broken thing, and I love him for it. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d\n Natalia Theodoridou is a media & cultural studies scholar, the winner of the 2018 World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction, and a Clarion West graduate (class of 2018).

She\u2019d spent her entire life in skirmishes against the pale men, the feathered clans, and the dream-skinners: her first ship, The Tiger Lashes with His Tail, had died at the battle of Bach Nhan, when the smoke-children had blown up Harmony Station and its satellites; her second had not lasted more than a year.\n The Tortoise in the Lake was her fourth ship, and they\u2019d been together for five years, though neither of them expected to live for a further five. Men survived easier than ships\u2014because they had armor, because the ships had been tasked to take care of them. Dong Huong remembered arguing with Lady Mieng\u2019s Dreamer, begging the ship to spare itself instead of her; and running against a wall of obstinacy, a fundamental incomprehension that ships could be more important than humans.\n For the Northerners, however, everything would be different.\n \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d The Tortoise in the Lake said, cutting across Dong Huong\u2019s gloomy thoughts.\n \u201cI can see nothing.\u201d\n There came a low rumble, which distorted the cabin around her, and cast an oily sheen on the walls. \u201cWatch.\u201d\n Outside, everything was dark. There was only the shadow of The Two Sisters in Exile, the dead ship that they\u2019d been pulling since Longevity Station. It hung in space, forlorn and pathetic, like the corpse of an old woman; although Dong Huong knew that it was huge, and could have housed her entire lineage without a care.\n \u201cI see nothing,\u201d Dong Huong said, again. The ground rumbled beneath her, even as her ears popped with pressure\u2014more laughter from The Tortoise in the Lake, even as the darkness of space focused and narrowed\u2014became the shadow of wings, the curve on vast surfaces\u2014the hulls of two huge ships flanking them; thin, sharp, like a stretch of endless walls\u2014making The Tortoise in the Lake seem small and insignificant, just as much as Dong Huong herself was small and insignificant in comparison to her own ship.\n A voice echoed in the ship\u2019s vast rooms, harsh and strong, tinged with the Northerners\u2019 dialect, but still as melodious as declaimed poetry. \u201cYou wished to speak to us. We are here.\u201d\n All Dong Huong knew about Northerners were dim, half-remembered snatches of family stories that were almost folktales: the greater, stronger part of the former Dai Viet Empire; the pale-skinned people of the outer planets, a civilization of graceful cities and huge habitats, of wild gardens on mist-filled hillsides, of courtly manners and polished songs.\n She was surprised, therefore, by the woman who disembarked onto The Tortoise in the Lake. Rong Anh was indeed paler than she was under her makeup, but otherwise ordinary looking: though very young, barely old enough to have bonded to a ship in Nam society, she bore herself with a poise any warrior would have envied. \u201cYou have something for us.\u201d\n Dong Huong made a gesture, towards the walls of the room; the seething, ever-shifting mass of calligraphy; the fragments of poems, of books, of sutras, a perpetual reminder of the chaos underpinning the universe. \u201cI . . . apologize,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI\u2019ve come to bring one of your ships back to you.\u201d To appease them, her commander had said. To avoid a declaration of war from a larger and more developed empire, a war which would utterly destroy the Nam.\n Anh did not move. \u201cI saw it outside. Tell me what happened.\u201d\n \u201cIt was an accident,\u201d Dong Huong said. The Two Sisters in Exile\u2014a merchant vessel from the Northerners\u2019 vast fleet\u2014had just happened to cross the line of fire at the wrong time. \u201cA military exercise that went wrong. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Anh hadn\u2019t moved; but the ceruse on her face looked less and less like porcelain, and more and more like bleached bone. \u201cOur ships don\u2019t die,\u201d she said, slowly.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dong Huong said, again. \u201cThey\u2019re as mortal as anyone, I fear.\u201d The vast majority of attacks on a ship would do little but tear metal: a ship\u2019s vulnerable point was the heartroom, where the Mind that animated it resided. Unlike Nam ships, Northerner ships were large and well shielded; and no pirate had ever managed to hack or pierce their way into a heartroom.\n But fate could be mocking, uncaring: as The Two Sisters in Exile passed by Dong Huong\u2019s military exercise, a random lance of fire had gone all the way to the heartroom on an almost impossible trajectory\u2014searing the Mind in its cradle of optics. They\u2019d heard the ship\u2019s Mind scream its pain in deep spaces long after the lance had struck; had stood in stunned silence, knowing that the Mind was dying and that nothing would stop that.\n Anh shook her head; looked up after a while, and her mask was back in place, her eyebrows perfectly arched, like moths. \u201cAn accident.\u201d\n \u201cThe people responsible have been . . . dealt with.\u201d Swiftly, and unpleasantly; and firmly enough to make it clear this would be not tolerated. \u201cI have come to bring the body back, for a funeral. I\u2019m told this is the custom of your people.\u201d\n Nam ships and soldiers didn\u2019t get a funeral, or at least not one that was near a planet. They lay frozen where they had fallen\u2014stripped of all vital equipment, the cold of space forever preserving them from decay, a permanent monument; a warning to anyone who came; a memory of glory, which the spirits of the dead could bask into all the way from Heaven. It would be Dong Huong\u2019s fate; The Tortoise in the Lake\u2019s fate, in a few years or perhaps more if Quan Vu, God of War, saw fit to extend His benevolence to them both. Dong Huong had few expectations.\n \u201cIt is our custom.\u201d Anh inclined her head. Her eyes blinked, minutely: it looked as if she was engaged elsewhere, perhaps communicating with her own ships. \u201cWe will bring her back where she was born, and bury her with the blessing of her descendants. You will come.\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t a question, or even an invitation; but an order. \u201cOf course,\u201d Dong Huong said. She hesitated, then said, \u201cThe military exercise was under my orders. If you want to clear my blood debt . . . \u201d\n Anh paused, halfway through one of the ship\u2019s dilating doors. \u201cBlood debt?\u201d Her head moved up, a fraction, making her seem almost inhuman. \u201cWhat would we do with your life?\u201d\n Take it as a peace offering, Dong Huong thought, biting her tongue. She couldn\u2019t say it; she\u2019d been forbidden. Never admit what you\u2019d come from; say just what was needed. Admit your guilt but say nothing about your hopes, lest they betray you as everything in life was bound to do.\n \u201cDid you know her?\u201d she asked.\n Anh did not move. At long last, still not looking at Dong Huong, she said, \u201cShe was of my lineage.\u201d\n \u201cKin to you,\u201d Dong Huong said, unsure of the implications. Minds were borne within a human womb before being implanted in their ships: this made them part of a lineage, as much as human children.\n \u201cYes,\u201d Anh said. \u201cI\u2019ve known her since I was a child.\u201d Her hand had clenched on the wall; but she walked away without saying anything more.\n After Anh was gone, Dong Huong opened her usual book of poetry, one of the only treasures she\u2019d brought on board the ship. But the words blurred in her eyesight, slid away from her comprehension like raindrops on polished jade; and, rather than bringing her peace as they always did, the poems only frustrated her.\n Instead, she turned off the lights, and lay back in the darkness, thinking of Xuan and Hai\u2014of their faces, frozen in the instant before she ordered The Tortoise in the Lake to fire, and transfixed them as surely as their ships had transfixed The Two Sisters in Exile\u2014she saw them, falling, fading from her ship\u2019s views\u2014leaving nothing but the memory of their shocked gazes, weighing her, accusing her.\n She\u2019d had to do it. Quickly, decisively, as she\u2019d done everything in life; as she\u2019d parted from her husband when he failed to uphold the family\u2019s honor; as she\u2019d forged her path in the military, never looking back, never regretting. And, as she\u2019d told Anh, the matter had been closed: the perpetrators punished, order and law upheld, justice dealt out.\n But still . . .\n \u201cYou\u2019re brooding,\u201d The Tortoise in the Lake said.\n Dong Huong said nothing. She felt the weight of her armor on her body; the cold touch of metal on her skin; the solidity of everything around her, from the poetry on the wall to the folded clothes beside her bed. The present, which was the only thing that mattered. \u201cI\u2019m the officer whose crew shot the ship in the first place. By my presence here, I endanger everything,\u201d she said.\n \u201cNonsense.\u201d The room seemed to contract, become warmer and more welcoming, down to the words palpitating on the walls; the ship\u2019s voice grew less distant. \u201cHave you not seen their ships?\u201d\n \u201cI have. They\u2019re huge.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re weaponless.\u201d There was a tinge of contempt in The Tortoise in the Lake\u2019s voice. \u201cCargo transport, with a little reserve against pirates; but even less well-armed than the smoke-children.\u201d\n Dong Huong shivered, in the darkness. \u201cDid you have to pick that example?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d the ship said, after a while. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\n \u201cI saw her face,\u201d Dong Huong said at last. \u201cShe looks young, but doesn\u2019t act like it.\u201d\n \u201cRejuvenation treatments?\u201d\n \u201cAmong other things.\u201d Dong Huong shivered. The Nam were a small, fractured empire; beset on all sides by enemies. The Northerners, on the other hand . . . They were large; they hadn\u2019t fought a large-scale war in centuries; and they had had time to develop everything from medical cures to advanced machinery. If they wanted war, the South, for all its warrior heritage, would be badly outgunned and outnumbered.\n \u201cThey love their peace,\u201d the ship said. \u201cGo to sleep, younger sister. There will be plenty of time in the morning.\u201d\n Younger sister. Nothing more than convention by now; though the Mind of her first ship, The Tiger Lashes with His Tail, had shared blood with her: the mother that had borne it in her womb had been a cousin of Dong Huong\u2019s own father.\n She did sleep, in the end. In her dreams, she walked in the lineage house again: on ochre ground, amidst cacti and shrunken bushes, and shrieking children playing rhyme-games in the courtyards. The smell of lemongrass and garlic rose from the kitchens like a balm to her soul, a reminder of the future she was fighting for; of what it meant to safeguard the Empire against its enemies. She saw her aunt, the mother of The Tiger Lashes with His Tail, standing tall and proud\u2014her face unmoving as she learned of the ship\u2019s fall at Bach Nhan, her eyes dark and dry; as if she\u2019d already wept beforehand.\n Surely she had known, or suspected. Ships didn\u2019t live long; but then, neither did human children. They both spread their wings like butterflies, like phoenixes, and ascended into the Heavens with the ancestors, watching over the Nam people. Dong Huong had tried to whisper such platitudes to her aunt; but nothing had come; and in her dreams\u2014which were not real, not a true recollection\u2014she stood looking into her aunt\u2019s eyes, and saw the tears welling up, as black and opaque as ink from a broken brush.\n Dong Huong didn\u2019t come from a family of warriors, but from a very old lineage of scholars, who had turned merchants rather than bond to ships and take up knives and guns. Fifth Uncle, her favorite when she was a child, regularly went to Northern planets; and he would speak to her of Northern wonders, always with the same misty, open-eyed sense of awe. He would remind her that the Northerners hadn\u2019t fallen from grace, that they still remembered the original Dai Viet Empire and its culture that had stretched from one end of the galaxy to another; that they still had literature and poetry about beauty and dreams, and knew a life that wasn\u2019t a succession of one battle after another.\n As a child, Dong Huong had drunk those words like tea or sugarcane juice. As an adult, within her combat unit, she had dismissed them. A civilization that barely knew war would be weak, a stunted, dying flower rather than the magnificent blossoming her relatives described.\n But the view beneath her now, as she and Anh descended in a shuttle towards the planet . . . As vast and as overwhelming as the two Northerner ships that had been her first contact\u2014continents of chrome and verdant trees, sweeping away from her, seas glittering a vivid turquoise, with the glint of ten thousand boats on the waves\u2014and, around them, in the atmosphere, a ballet of ships, as numerous as birds in the skies\u2014a few huge spaceships like her own, carrying a Mind in their heartrooms; and myriad simple shuttle ships, manually driven, that nevertheless wove in and out of one another\u2019s way, dancing like the rhythms of a song, the words of a poem\u2014\n \u201cYou seem impressed,\u201d Anh said. \u201cHave you never seen a planet?\u201d\n \u201cNot\u2014\u201d Dong Huong swallowed, unable to dispel a memory of her own barren homeworld. \u201cNot this kind, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n Anh smiled, indulgently. \u201cCome. Let\u2019s get you to the funeral.\u201d\n After disembarking from the shuttle, Dong Huong felt . . . naked, a warrior without a sword. She had her gun at her hip, and her armor on her; Anh hadn\u2019t even attempted to remove it from her, as if it all didn\u2019t matter much. She also had the voice and video loop of The Tortoise in the Lake to carry in her thoughts, but still . . . the higher gravity was grinding her bones against one another; and unfamiliar people, each dressed in more elaborate clothes than the previous one, turned and stopped, staring at her with the same odd expression on their faces\u2014appraisal, disapproval?\n Everything around her was freakish, different: buildings that were too tall, streets that were too wide, crisscrossed by alien vehicles. Everything was stately, orderly, so far from the chaotic traffic that marked Nam streets. Even the sky above was out of place; a deep, impossible blue with a thin, gleaming overlay: weather control, Anh said indulgently, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n Weather control. Dong Huong breathed in rain, and the distant smell of flowers; and thought of the gardens of her home planet\u2014ochre ground, cacti breaking out in large, breathtaking flowers\u2014but nowhere as rich, nowhere as pointlessly complicated.\n The funeral place was huge. Dong Huong had expected a funeral hall; a temple or a larger complex. But certainly not a city within the city, a whole area of tall buildings sprouting the white flags of mourning: every street filled with a stream of people in hempen garments, all wearing the strip of cloth that denoted the family of the dead.\n When Dong Huong fell in battle\u2014as she must, for it was the fate of all warriors\u2014her lineage would weep for her. Her husband and her husband\u2019s brothers as well, perhaps, and that was all: two dozen people at the most, perhaps fifty if one included the more distant cousins. \u201cWho are they?\u201d she asked.\n Anh paused at the entrance to a slender, white spire, and smiled. \u201cI told you. Her descendants.\u201d\n \u201cThe\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShe was old,\u201d Anh said. Her voice was low, hushed. \u201cHer mother was born in the Hieu Phuc reign; and she bore a Mind and four human children; and the children in turn had children of their own; and the children had children, on and on through the generations . . . \u201d\n \u201cHow\u2014\u201d Dong Huong moistened her tongue, tried again. \u201cHow long had it lived?\u201d The Tortoise in the Lake was ten years old, a veteran by Nam standards.\n \u201cFour centuries. Our ships live long; so do our stations. How else shall we maintain our link to the past?\u201d\n \u201cThe shuttles?\u201d Dong Huong asked, at last, her voice wavering, breaking like a boat in a storm.\n Anh nodded, gravely. \u201cTheir pilots, yes. I told you that she had many descendants. And many friends.\u201d\n Within Dong Huong\u2019s thoughts, The Tortoise in the Lake recoiled, watching the ballet of the dozen largest ships in the skies. Every one of them had a Mind; every one of them was as old as The Two Sisters in Exile. Every one of them . . .\n \u201cIs this her?\u201d The speaker was a man, who, like Anh, didn\u2019t look a day older than sixteen\u2014a face Dong Huong ached to see older, more mature\u2014less na\u00efve about the realities of the war.\n \u201cMinh. I see you were waiting for us.\u201d Anh did not smile.\n Minh\u2019s eyes were wide, almost shocked. \u201cNews gets around. Is it true?\u201d\n Anh gestured upwards, to the ballet of ships in the sky. \u201cDo you think we\u2019d all gather, if it wasn\u2019t true?\u201d\n Dong Huong hadn\u2019t said anything, waiting to be recognized. At last, Minh turned to her.\n \u201cDong Huong, this is Teacher Minh,\u201d Anh said. \u201cHe leads our research programs.\u201d\n Minh\u2019s gaze was on her, scrutinizing her as one might look at a failed experiment. \u201cDong Huong. A beautiful name. It ill-suits you.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s been said before,\u201d Dong Huong said.\n Minh sighed. He looked at Anh, and back at her. \u201cShe\u2019s so . . . hard, Anh. Too young to be that callous.\u201d\n \u201cNam,\u201d Anh said, with the same tinge of contempt to her voice. \u201cYou know how they are. Shaped by war.\u201d\n Minh\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYes. There is that.\u201d\n \u201cYou disapprove?\u201d Dong Huong felt a need, a compulsion to challenge him, to see him react in anger, in fear.\n \u201cLife is sacred,\u201d Minh said, leading her towards a double-panel door, with Anh in tow. \u201cAs we well know. Our bodies are a gift from our parents and our ancestors, and they shan\u2019t be wasted.\u201d\n \u201cWasted?\u201d Dong Huong shook her head. \u201cYou mistake us. We give them back, in the most selfless fashion possible. We live for our families, for the Empire. We give our lives so that they might remain safe, unconquered.\u201d\n Minh snorted. \u201cYou are such children,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaying with forces you don\u2019t understand. Which is what brings us here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n The spire led into a hall vaster than the Northern ships; the walls were decked with images of outside, of the two ships dragging the carcass of The Two Sisters in Exile. And it was full\u2014of grave people in rich clothes, of mourners with tears streaming on their faces. She\u2019d never seen so many people gathered together; and suspected that she would never see them again.\n Minh and Anh led Dong Huong to the front, ignoring her protestations, and introduced her to the principal mourner: an old, frail woman who looked more bewildered than sad. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened before,\u201d she said. \u201cShips don\u2019t die. They never do . . . \u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Minh said, slowly, gently. \u201cThey never do.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at Dong Huong. \u201cI remember, the summer I came home from the Sixth Planet. She was docked in Azure Dragon Spaceport, looking so grand and beautiful\u2014she\u2019d used the trip to go in for repairs. She laughed on my comms, told me that now she looked as young as me, that she felt she could race anywhere in the universe. She . . . \u201d His voice broke; he raised a hand, rubbing at reddened eyes.\n \u201cIt\u2019s our fault,\u201d Dong Huong said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come, to offer amends.\u201d\n \u201cAmends.\u201d Minh didn\u2019t blink. \u201cYes, of course. Amends.\u201d He sounded as though he couldn\u2019t understand any of the words, as though they were an entirely alien concept.\n Anh steered Dong Huong away from Minh, and towards her place in the front. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this,\u201d Dong Huong protested.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll watch. You said \u2018amends,\u2019, didn\u2019t you? Consider this the start of what you owe the ship,\u201d Anh said, firmly planting her at the front of the assembly.\n Dong Huong stood, feeling like a particularly exotic animal on display\u2014with the weight of everyone\u2019s gaze on her nape, the growing wave of shock, anger, incomprehension in the room. The ceremony was still going on in the background: monks had joined the mourners, their chanted mantras a continuous drone in the background, and the smell of incense was rising everywhere in the room. She clenched her hand on her gun, struggling to remember her composure.\n On the screens, the ship had been towed to what looked like its final destination; while a seething mass of smaller flyers gathered\u2014not ships, not shuttles, but round spheres that looked like a cloud of insects compared to the The Two Sisters in Exile. The old woman took up her place at the lectern amidst the growing silence. \u201cWe\u2019re all here,\u201d she said at last. \u201cGathering from our planets, our orbitals, our shuttles, dancing in the skies to honor her. Her name was The Two Sisters in Exile, and she knew every one of our ancestors.\u201d\n Dong Huong had expected anger; or grief; but not the stony, shocked silence of the assembly. \u201cShe was assembled in the yards of the Twenty-First Planet, in the last days of the Dai Viet Empire.\u201d Her voice shivered, and became deeper and more resonant\u2014no, it was a ship, speaking at the same time as her, its voice heavy with grief. \u201cHer Grand Master of Design Harmony was Nguyen Van Lien; her Master of Wind and Water Khong Tu Khinh; and her beloved mother Phan Thi Quynh. She was born in the first year of the reign of Emperor Hieu Phuc, and died in the forty-second year of the Tu Minh reign. Dong Huong of the Nam brought her here.\u201d\n The attention of the entire hall turned to Dong Huong, an intensity as heavy as stone. No hatred, no anger; but merely the same shock. This didn\u2019t happen; not to them, not to their ships.\n \u201cToday, we are gathered to honor her, and to fill the void that she lives in our lives. She\u2019ll be\u2014missed.\u201d The voice broke; and the swarm of spheres that had gathered in space shuddered and broke, wrapping themselves around the corpse of The Two Sisters in Exile\u2014growing smaller and smaller, slowly eating away at the corpse until nothing remained, just a cloud of dust that danced amongst starlight.\n \u201cMissed.\u201d The entire hall was silent now, transfixed by the ceremony. Someone, somewhere, was sobbing; and even if they hadn\u2019t been, the spreading wave of shock and grief was palpable.\n Four centuries old. Her descendants, more numerous than the leaves of a tree, the birds in the sky, the grains of rice in a bowl. A life, held sacred; more valuable than jade or gold. Dong Huong watched the graceful ballet in the sky; the ceremony, perfectly poised, with its measured poetry and recitations from long-dead scholars; and, abruptly, she knew the answer she\u2019d take back to her people.\n Graceful; scholarly; cultured. The Northerners had forgotten what war was; what death for ships was. They had forgotten that all it took was a lance or an accident to sear away four centuries of wisdom.\n They had forgotten how capricious, how arbitrary life was, how things could not be prolonged or controlled. And that, in turn, meant that this\u2014this single death, this incident that would have had no meaning among the Nam\u2014would have them rise up, outraged, bringing fire and wind to avenge their dead, scouring entire planets to avenge a single life.\n They would say no, of course. They would speak of peace, of the need for forgiveness. But something like this\u2014a gap, a void this large in the fabric of society\u2014would never be filled, never be forgiven. Minh\u2019s research programs would be bent and turned towards enhancing the weapons on the merchant ships; and all those people in the hall, all those gathered descendants, would become an army on a sacred mission.\n In her mind, Dong Huong saw the desert plains of her home planet; the children playing in the ochre courtyard of her lineage house; the smell of lemongrass and garlic from the kitchens\u2014saw it all shiver and crinkle, darkening like paper held to a flame.\n Quan Vu watch over us.

Living in the flat and dusty South Australian landscape, his fantasy novels, particularly the Books of the Cataclysm, strongly resonate with the landscape he calls home.\nI first became aware of Sean shortly after winning the Writers of The Future contest in 2000. Sean, a winner from years previous, had lived the sort of career I dreamed of having. And his books sat in my shelf of a bursting canon of Commonwealth writers from Scotland, Canada, and Australia that I felt forced new life into my favourite sub-genre: Space Opera. With co-author Shane Dix his Geodesica series really packed an intense amount of invention, world building, and adventure into some crazy fun reads.\nI\u2019m not the only who digs on Sean\u2019s work. He\u2019s snagged the Ditmar and Aurealis awards several times. I caught up to him via email with a series of questions that, if only he didn\u2019t live clear on the other side of the Earth from me, I would have loved to have asked him over a drink:\nYou live in South Australia, and seem to be part of a wave of Australian writers that are really building up and getting attention worldwide. Do you attribute that to any sort of zeitgeist? And what do you think living in that particular area brings to your work, or the work of your peers, that isn\u2019t being done in other places?\nHarlan Ellison gave a talk to a bunch of people in Canberra back in the 1990s in which he described the scene then as a Golden Age of Australian speculative fiction. If it was gold then, I don\u2019t know what it is now. Platinum, perhaps, or something even more precious. The scene has really exploded in the last decade, with so many new writers coming up the ranks and so many of us old pros selling overseas that it\u2019s very difficult now to remember what it was like when I first started. Then, you could\u2019ve counted the number of US sales on a couple of hands. Now, there are established writers like Sara Douglass, Greg Egan, Garth Nix, Trudi Canavan, and Lian Hearn continuing their already successful careers, with relatively new names like Karen Miller, Joel Shepherd and Justine Larbalestier bursting onto the world stage behind them. It\u2019s a very exciting time, whatever you call it.\nThe issue of \u201cAustralianness\u201d is a vexed one, one I\u2019ve been pondering for many years, because it\u2019s almost impossible to pin down, let alone identify the source. In my writing, particularly in my fantasy series, my personal background and experiences come forward through the landscape, which is very different from the Tolkienesque stage: no big mountains, no flowing rivers, no forests, no snow. I can\u2019t write about these things with any kind of truth because I\u2019ve never personally experienced them. Where I grew up, here in SA, there are no mountains, rivers, forests, or snow. It\u2019s flat and old and dry and full of its own kind of magic. That\u2019s what I try to capture in my novels; that\u2019s where my heart lies.\nIt used to bother me that other Australian fantasy writers don\u2019t often use this landscape too. I used to think that it was a kind o post-colonial betrayal of our heritage. Now I know that my version of Australia is different from that experienced by most Australians. Most Australians live on the continent\u2019s East coast, where there are mountains, rivers, forests and snow, and their version of Australia is just as valid as mine. The Outback is just one part of a very large continent, and it\u2019s one a lot of people here never experience.\nFollowing up on the question about your location, do you find it tough to reach readers in the US?\nMost of my books seem to reach them, which is great. Certainly the science fiction has no problem with the tyranny of distance. In fact, my agent first took me on because the book I had shopped to him read like it had been written by an American (I took that as a compliment <g>). The fantasy is trickier. The Books of the Change, my YA fantasy series that is particularly steeped in Australianness, never sold in the US, and I wonder sometimes if that\u2019s because of a certain nervousness about the setting. I don\u2019t know. It puzzles me, but I don\u2019t lose any sleep over it any more.\nOr do you mean physically reaching readers in the US? That is a concern. I\u2019d love to come across more often, to cons or to do signings, but the length of the trip is starting to weigh on me as I get older. Coming across once a year for the Writers of the Future contest celebrations and sticking around for WorldCon if it\u2019s nearby is about all I can manage at the moment. It\u2019s nothing personal, honest. \ud83d\ude42\nIn your Books of the Cataclysm series, you seem to be trying to create your own religion, but one that is based on a synthesis of myths, legends, and religious beliefs from around the world. It\u2019s as if all our religions were looking into a small portion of a larger room, and you\u2019re stitching it together for great effect. Did you plan this out before writing your novels, or did it come organically as you wrote?\nI spent a very long time working on the religious background to the Books of the Cataclysm. Really, it started when my father chose to become a priest during my early high school years. I witnessed the study he undertook from the sidelines, and became fascinated with the idea of faded myths\u2014stories (such as Noah\u2019s Ark) that one culture appropriates from another and adopts as their own. Once it occurred to me that all religion can be viewed as a bunch of great stories that people take entirely too seriously, it was just a short hop sideways to the atheist I remain today\u2014one who denies the existence of both deities and the afterlife but is endlessly fascinated with other people\u2019s fascination with the same.\nIn constructing the world of the Cataclysm, I asked myself two questions. The first was: what kind of religion could I buy into, if I had to? The second begins with the thought that, if there really is some truth to one religion, maybe there\u2019s some truth to all of them but none of them get it entirely right. If that\u2019s the case, what is the bigger picture everyone isn\u2019t quite seeing? What\u2019s the elephant the three blind men keep misidentifying?\nYears of reading about religion encouraged me to keep several aspects: reincarnation, for instance, and also the idea of an afterlife. So my made-up religion has a cycle of life that takes a person through death to an afterlife, but doesn\u2019t stop there; they can die in that afterlife and move to another one; they then die there too, and find themselves back where they started, in this world, in a new life. Some cultures have the idea of more than one soul, so that tied in nicely too.\nSimilarly, it\u2019s a pantheistic world, with deities and demons and angels and whatnot, but there is a big kahuna who stands in as the One God. The suggestion that it might be an alien intent on eating human souls does separate it a tad from what most religions tell us God is today, but I can imagine how a glimpse of one could be mistaken for the other.\nThe other thing I was trying to do in the Books of the Cataclysm was to see what a theistic universe might look like in which the principles of Darwinism also operated. Most modern writers working in this area (that I\u2019ve come across, anyway) tend to deal with the two concepts as though they\u2019re mutually exclusive, as though the Scopes trial meant the two could never be put back together. By putting the two back together\u2014by operating on the assumption that both the pantheon and the environment it exists in are mutable\u2014I found an immensely complex landscape opening up before, one I could barely contain in four fat books.\nI sometimes joked with Lou Anders that if the books didn\u2019t do well, I could always found my own religion. It\u2019s still tempting to set up the website and see what happens. The idea of waging a spiritual war against the invader of the afterlife must surely appeal to someone, surely . . . *smile*\nYou also additionally seem to be able to jump into various genres without hesitation. Your earlier books, co-written with Shane Dix, are sheer adventurous Space Operas, but then you move from spaceships to magically powered airships in your Cataclysm series. What do you seek out in different genres when you\u2019re writing these very different books?\nNothing more sophisticated than variety, probably. There are times I wish I was good at writing one thing, which I could churn out indefinitely, without confusing marketing departments or bookstores or even readers (although I think most of my fans cope with it perfectly well). But like a lot of people, maybe most people, I read wildly and I get ideas in lots of different genres, and I become stale if I stick in one spot for long. So it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m looking for something, specifically, when I hop from genre to genre. I\u2019m drawn there by the stories that demand to be told.\nThat said, there certain issues you can explore in space opera that are extremely difficult to even talk about anywhere else. If I want to see what a million year-old human might be like, say; or if I want my characters to interact with a mind as large as an entire galaxy; or if I want to explore the nature of a life form that evolved in the fiery chaos of the post-Big Bang inflationary period; etc. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of writing space opera, because that would be like getting tired of space itself, and that is inconceivable to me.\nIn your SF novels you explore the changing nature of humanity, through evolution and technology. Can you talk a bit about ways you think we\u2019re changing right now?\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk recently about Generation Y\u2019s new take on privacy. New for most people: I\u2019ve always thought the issue handled hysterically by the media and commentators on the Internet (but that\u2019s a whole other topic). That\u2019s a hefty social change creeping up on us that may make a big difference to the way we go about life this century. People\u2019s attitudes to body modification are changing: not just augmented breasts, but enhanced physical performance, life extension, and various reproductive options are all being seriously explored at the moment. This isn\u2019t news, and again the knee-jerk reactions are still strong, but I\u2019m sure that when someone faced with age or just wanting to be fitter in generally is handed the option to improve their lot, why wouldn\u2019t they take it? We\u2019re greedy. We love life, and we\u2019ll take it if we can get it.\nThere are so many hurdles ahead, and so many social divides we\u2019ll have to get across. Euthanasia and abortion are just two that the US and other countries (like my own) will need to grapple with if we\u2019re going to have sustainable cultures wherein people can expect to live long, happy lives.\nI am hopeful, but bracing myself for the rocky road ahead.\nHow do these views then, affect the way you approach writing characters in your novels?\nFundamentally. For every future society I\u2019ve created\u2014from my first novel, Metal Fatigue, set at the end of this century, to the one I\u2019m working on at the moment, set over a million years in the future\u2014I try to consider what concerns the characters will have on a day-to-day level, as well as across the broader canvas of the story. How do they eat, sleep, clean their teeth, dress, procreate, defecate, whatever? What kind of intimate problems will absorb their attention? How will they resolve them?\nI also spend a lot of time finding ways to make them characters that we can identify with, since there\u2019s a likelihood that people in the future will be as alien to us as we would seem to our Cro Magnon ancestors. I\u2019ll confess to being very harsh on space opera that has people just like us wandering through the pages. We don\u2019t have Cro Magnon types any more, so why would our descendants\u2014unless there\u2019s a conscious reason for it, like human development has been frozen genetically or perhaps as a kind of fashion or ideological statement, or whatever? If I can\u2019t see the reason embedded in the fabric of the culture, then I won\u2019t keep reading\u2014and I try to be just as hard on my own books. So far, I\u2019ve had several cultures in which present-day humans exists as part of a spectrum of human experience, existing side-by-side with other more or less evolved types, but I\u2019ve also had modern humanity preserved by faulty transporter \u201ccloning\u201d and by the kind of cultural momentum I think our own culture\u2014the most observed and recorded in history\u2014will generate. As time passes, our legacy will loom very large over subsequent generations, particularly as members of our present generation may live across many more to come. In my latest novel, Saturn Returns, several characters are referred to who were born in our time and are still alive, playing important roles, in the year 879,000AD.\nYou also write a dark fantasy series for children. What is the difference between the way you approach these books and your other books?\nWhen I\u2019m writing fantasy, I have to switch off the part of my brain that wants to know how everything works. Not entirely, of course: characters and cultures still need to be thought through, and the magic system I use has to be internally consistent as well. But the nuts and bolts of it all have to stay behind the curtain; otherwise I\u2019d never get off page one.\nWhen I\u2019m writing for kids, the only concession I make is that I need to get from A to B more quickly than I could with adults. There\u2019s no time for lingering descriptions or in-depth characterisation. It has to be immediate, concise, vivid, from the plot down\u2014or up, or out, depending on how you imagine stories coming together. I love the fact that I can get down a whole novel\u2019s worth of story\u2014world-building, character arcs, the lot\u2014into a book that\u2019s one third the size of my usual novels. It\u2019s both immensely challenging and immensely liberating. My adult books are shrinking because of it. Sometimes I wonder if after this series I\u2019ll ever be able to write a fat fantasy novel again.\nIn all my fantasy books, bar one, there have been kids or young adults involved. That\u2019s a very clear break from my SF novels, which are uniformly peopled by characters with adults concerns (even if some of them are technically very youthful, such as the gestalt mind Isaac Deangelis in Geodesica). I enjoy the emotional intensity of younger characters, and I think that fits better in fantasy. The kids\u2019 series I have coming out next year contains some of the rawest, most painful writing I\u2019ve ever attempted. Why I felt freer to go that way with a book for 10 year-olds rather than a book for adults is still something I\u2019m trying to nut out.\nIn addition to Space Opera, Fantasy, and YA literature, you\u2019ve also written media novels. Did you enjoy that experience as much as writing your own original fiction?\nOh yeah. Who wouldn\u2019t enjoy writing lines for the Doctor or Darth Vader? Well, maybe not everyone, but I certainly do. And I get paid for it, which makes it a bit of a no-brainer for me.\nMy take on media writing is this: I\u2019d never write a book about people I\u2019m not passionately engaged with. (Why would I? It\u2019s bloody hard work and the money isn\u2019t that great.) So if I click with a particular franchise and the project sounds like fun, I\u2019ll try to work it into my schedule of original novels. If a media project fails any of those criteria, I won\u2019t do it. I want to be absolutely sure I can give a media book as much attention as I would one of my own because my fellow fans of the franchise deserve nothing less.\nThere are franchises I\u2019d never write for because I don\u2019t know them well enough, or just don\u2019t care enough. And there are franchises I would cut off my left arm to write for. We don\u2019t always get what we want, but I feel very lucky that I\u2019ve been able to work in the universes I have\u2014by they my own or George Lucas\u2019s or whoever\u2019s. That I plan to keep doing it even though sometimes it means taking a pay-cut speaks volumes, I hope.\nWhat are you reading these days, for your own enjoyment?\nLet\u2019s see what\u2019s in my to-read stack . . . A memoir on deafness; an anthology of colonial Australian Gothic fiction; novels by Angela Carter, Patrick O\u2019Brien and Lee Child; The Player of Games by Iain Banks; two anthologies containing pieces by writers who\u2019ve been imprisoned, tortured or killed for speaking out against injustice in their home countries; and a long line of books by friends (including two of your own, TB) that I feel bad for not having got to sooner. Some of this is for work, but in a real sense all reading is for work these days. Even when my conscious critical faculties are off, I\u2019m still absorbing technique subliminally. It\u2019s the best way to learn.\nWhen I\u2019m busy writing speculative fiction, my reading-for-pleasure tends to be crime and thrillers. Between deadlines is when I catch up on genre stuff. I think my brain can only take so much of one genre at a time. Or maybe I\u2019m too close to the field now\u2014after 25 novels in 10 years, or whatever the count is\u2014to switch off those critical faculties like I did when I was a kid. That would be a shame, though, so I\u2019ll run with my first theory . . .\nThanks a bunch for answering these questions!\nMy pleasure!\nCalled \"Violent, poetic and compulsively readable\" by Maclean's, science fiction author Tobias S.

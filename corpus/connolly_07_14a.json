For a one-tailed t-test the critical value is 1.81.\n Therefore I cannot reject the null hypothesis.\n Non-Science Fiction-Only Publications: Gender Split of Total Subs vs. Gender Split of Science Fiction Subs\n Hypothesis: There is no relationship between the gender ratio of all submissions and the gender ratio of science fiction submissions.\n R value: 0.7132 (Strong positive correlation)\n I can reject the null hypothesis.\n All-Men Senior Editorial Team Vs All-Women or Mixed-Gender Senior Editorial Team\n Hypothesis: Men-only senior editorial teams are not more likely to receive submissions from authors who are men.\n All Submissions\n R value: -0.16 (weak negative correlation)T value: -0.57Critical value at 95% probability: 1.78\n Based on the t-value this result is not significant.\n Science Fiction Submissions\n R value: 0.23 (weak positive correlation)T value: 0.76Critical value at 95% probability: 1.81\n Based on the t-value this result is not significant.\n All-Women Senior Editorial Team Vs All-Men or Mixed-Gender Senior Editorial Team\n Hypothesis: Women-only senior editorial teams are not more likely to receive submissions from authors who are women.\n All Submissions\n R value: 0.19 (weak positive correlation)T value: 0.66Critical value at 95% probability: 1.78\n Based on the t-value this result is not significant.\n Science Fiction Submissions\n R value: -0.23 (weak negative correlation)T value: 0.74Critical value at 95% probability: 1.81\n Based on the t-value this result is not significant.\n Age of Senior Editorial Team\n Hypothesis: Age of Senior Editorial Team Has No Relationship with the Percentage of Submissions by Authors Who Are Men\n Mean Age vs. Total Subs by Men %\n R value: 0.2395 (weak positive correlation)\n Mean Age vs. Science Fiction Subs by Men %\n R value: 0.1299 (weak positive correlation)\n Median Age vs. Total Subs by Men %\n R value: 0.2329 (weak positive correlation)\n Median Age vs. Science Fiction Subs by Men %\n R value: 0.1125 (weak positive correlation)\n While the results technically show a positive correlation, the relationship is extremely weak, and insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.\n Susan E. Connolly's short fiction and non-fiction have appeared in Strange Horizons, Daily Science Fiction, The Center For Digital Ethics and the fanzine Journey Planet. She is the author of Damsel, a middle-grade fantasy from Mercier Press and Granuaile, an upcoming historical comic book from Atomic Diner.

Also near the forest (Ireland is a small country)."}

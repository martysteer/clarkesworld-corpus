The arbitrary definition of nighttime on the Bakunawa. Buried within a confusion of workstation alerts was a flashing red distress beacon. Transitioning from mimetic, eye-sensor controls to standard, manual controls gave me a headache. I left the beacon for Captain Onome to find.\nWe were on our usual route home, coasting outside the belt, loaded up with a cargo of silicate rocks and water from Europa.\nCaptain Onome finally noticed the distress beacon and said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s odd.\u201d\n\u201cThe worrying kind?\u201d I said, enjoying the feel of my feet on the floorboards as I rolled out the kinks in my shoulders. After being pressed flat against my chair for a few hours, the Baku now ran at about 1-g but would continue to lose momentum until reaching a complete stop at our distribution hub on Luna.\nOur stations sat three across on the bridge. Including the captain and me, there was also Mike, with all the personality of a peeled prawn, off rotation in his cabin. The Baku\u2019s AI bots managed our more tedious and time-consuming processes in the background.\n\u201cHard to say,\u201d Onome said, moving like a mantis angling its way around a leaf as she opened the comms. \u201cWe\u2019re being hailed by a solar sail\u2014an astronomical solar glider.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, I hate those,\u201d I said. I shook up an aerosolized cocktail of tranquilizers and melatonin to come down from the last little boost of Alertec that had kept me going during the jump. During our last job, I headed down planetfall on Europa to manage a few software and hardware installations for a body hacker running on the moon\u2019s eighty-five-hour day cycle. He wore me down to the bone. No matter where I am in \u2019verse, I need my eight hours, man.\n\u201cSolar glider,\u201d Onome said into the comms, \u201cThis is Captain Onome of the transport hauler the Bakunawa. Reading you loud and clear. Over.\u201d\nWe weren\u2019t in range for live communication, creating a short delay in response. I imagined the solar sail out there in the darkness, chasing cosmic winds, following astrological currents, waiting for a message in a bottle.\n\u201cEver been on one of those, Bex?\u201d the cap said. My name is Bexar, pronounced \u201cbear,\u201d but the cap liked to call me \u201cBex,\u201d which sounds like how it\u2019s spelled. I don\u2019t know. We have a lot of time to kill.\n\u201cNot a fan,\u201d I said. \u201cThe stories of astronomicals wandering into transit lanes are grisly. I\u2019ve seen the vids of what happens when a hauler smashes into one at a full jump. The astronomicals follow the byways and frontage lanes these days\u2014but I still don\u2019t trust them.\u201d\nAn audio-only message arrived. \u201cBakunawa, I am requesting assistance,\u201d said a reedy feminine voice buried in static. \u201cMy ship the Aldebaran has sustained damage from a passing comet, and I am unable to make repairs. I am on my way to meet with the flotilla for the solar opposition. Can you assist? Over.\u201d\n\u201cFlotilla?\u201d I said. \u201cSolar opposition?\u201d\n\u201cThe nomads meet every few years during specific astrological positions of the stars,\u201d Onome said. \u201cThis ship must be on its way to one of their gatherings.\u201d\nOnome expanded a holographic orrery of the solar system tracking the current position of the planets and the Baku. If Earth was a palm-sized rock, the solar sail was a grain of sand. Onome plucked the grain of sand away from the orrery, expanded it, and turned it over so we could get a look at its fat body and thin solar wings. Nothing had smashed into the thing, which was good.\nWe ran models of a rescue mission with the navigational AI.\n\u201cAt our current trajectory, we\u2019ll pass each other in a few hours. What do you think, Bex?\u201d\n\u201cRules of the road, right,\u201d I said. \u201cPull the ship in before anyone gets hurt.\u201d\nI shook off my desire for a nap with another Alertec, as well as a GABA supplement to keep my spirits up, chased with Echinacea.\nOnome responded to the astronomical: \u201cCopy that, Aldebaran. I\u2019m transmitting coordinates for pickup. Based on our current positions, we can pull you into orbit with the Bakunawa and bring you in. I\u2019m starting a countdown and expect we\u2019ll sync up just under 0300 hours from now. Over.\u201d\n\u201cCareful on those time commitments, Cap,\u201d I said, strapping into my station.\nStarship time is weird. Somehow moving between our outer-Earth outpost and one of the space stations beyond the belt, days and weeks get lost. Everyone\u2019s happy when we\u2019re early and pissed when we\u2019re late. On the Baku, we\u2019re always rumbling along the same transit lanes between the same rocks\u2014and, shit, I don\u2019t know where the lost time goes. Maybe I\u2019ll get it back in the end.\nAnd now we\u2019d created a time commitment for ourselves. A job requiring a bit of precision.\nAll we could do was refine the rescue model and wait. The hard work would fall on the nomad. Hopefully time would be on all our sides. And like I said, starship time is weird.\nSpace is really just a bunch of stuff circling bigger stuff in 3-D. So that informed our idea with the astronomical. Our trajectory was fixed\u2014a long orbit around Jupiter and Earth. The astronomical could move around a bit more, and if the pilot was halfway decent, drift right up to our ship and catch an orbit around us.\nThe right timing.\nA little luck.\nThat was the plan anyway.\nMike joined us on the bridge to help with the job, though it would have been better if he was out on the hull. \u201cMan, I just don\u2019t feel like dragging my ass into an EVA suit today,\u201d he said, poking at the rescue mission model on my screen.\n\u201cYour plan looks all right,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll fix a few things.\u201d\nI wiped the screen with my sleeve after he\u2019d tucked himself into his station. The model was fine, and all Mike did was move a few things around and put them back where they were.\n\u201cWhatever you two are going to do, do it fast,\u201d Onome said.\n\u201cWhy are we doing this again, Cap?\u201d Mike said.\n\u201cThe ship asked for help.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody needs something. What if it\u2019s a scam?\u201d\nWhile I thought Mike had a decent point, I didn\u2019t think voicing my agreement was in the captain\u2019s best interests.\n\u201cI have faith in all of us to handle the unexpected,\u201d Onome said.\nMike eyeballed me and shook his head. I gave him the finger.\nAs it came into view, the astronomical called to mind the boats our seafaring ancestors piloted across Earth oceans. With its patched-together hull, the ship was a mishmash of steel alloys and chrome, pitted by interstellar dust and cosmic radiation. Piloting that thing must have been lonely.\n\u201cShe\u2019s gonna miss us,\u201d Onome said.\nWe were in real-time, chitter-chatter range. The captain hailed the hitchhiker: \u201cFold your wings and slow your engines now, Aldebaran.\u201d\nSilver sails folded and retracted against the small ship\u2019s hull. As it came up on the low point of the Baku\u2019s orbit, bursts of gas from its aerobrakes slowed the craft. Shaking like mad, the astronomical created enough drag to fall into an elongated orbit with us.\n\u201cThe ship\u2019s too fragile to match our speed,\u201d Onome said.\nMike grabbed at the solar sail with the robotic arms we use to load and unload cargo.\n\u201cMissed, dammit,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t get another chance,\u201d Onome said.\nThe AI spat out a bunch of recommendations, but none made sense in the heat of the moment. Though I trust the bots to keep us from hitting any of the big rocks we\u2019ve forgotten about because we\u2019ve been popping Alertec for three or four days straight, there are still jobs only humans can do.\nI switched to the workstation\u2019s manual controls. Working two joysticks, I maneuvered the arms wide and brought them in slow\u2014the arms were on a track that could rotate around the hull of the bulbous and birdlike Baku\u2014timing it so the astronomical would pass on its next rotation through the arms while they were wide open. I snagged the ship. Hooks at the ends of the arms created a magnetic seal against the astronomical\u2019s fragile hull, tethering us together.\nHere was the Baku, the biggest rock around, and here was the astronomical, circling around us as we pulled the ship in closer.\n\u201cSlow and steady,\u201d Onome said.\nI dragged the astronomical up to the cargo hold and locked the ship in place with the Baku. We extended a docking module, creating an airlock between us.\n\u201cLet\u2019s meet our new passenger,\u201d Onome said, her boots clunking across the floorboards.\nI took a beta-Sitosterol to come down from the stress, as well as my daily multivitamin. \u201cSure,\u201d I said, transferring controls back to the AI.\nMike slumped in his chair. He was the last to leave.\nTraversing the Baku\u2019s interior decks was like one of those children\u2019s puzzles where you guide a metal ball through a maze. When you\u2019re weightless, you coast seamlessly along a series of platforms set on top of each other connected by one continuous corridor. Under gravity, it\u2019s a downhill trudge to the cargo hold and a trudge uphill to the bridge.\nOnome and I clomped down the corridor. I paused at the door to the cargo hold to straighten my jumpsuit. The captain insisted we maintain a daily exercise regimen to keep bone and muscle strength up, and while I did my best, the jumpsuit accentuated my gut.\n\u201cSuck it in, Bex,\u201d Onome said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late for me to hit up the gun safe,\u201d Mike said.\nThe Baku is supplied with a small number of Gauss guns\u2014service revolvers and a rifle. I guess in the event we\u2019re attacked by a xenomorph we\u2019ll be able to forestall the inevitable by three or four extra minutes. In his downtime, Mike likes to clean all the guns and dream about shooting a pirate. I\u2019m afraid of pirates, too, but unlike Mike, I know that if the shit went down, I\u2019d be the guy offering to make coffee while they pilfer our cargo hold. Or I\u2019d be dead. First to die in a pirate invasion. First to be eaten during a zombie infestation. First to be impregnated by a xenomorph. This guy right here.\n\u201cSave it,\u201d Onome said. \u201cHere she comes.\u201d\nWe greeted our guest.\nThe hitchhiker was like an evolved idea of humanity. Her face and hair were streaked with a blue clay that smelled like earth and exotic oils. She wore a gray poncho that hung off her shoulders and a standard-issue flight jumpsuit, weathered by hard work.\nOnome shaped her hands into a triangle formed by her thumbs and forefingers. She pushed the triangle away from her heart toward our guest. Captains always seem to know this kinda junk. Unsure what it meant, I repeated the movement. The hitchhiker clenched her right hand into a fist with the tip of her thumb protruding out between her index and middle finger. Holding her fist against her heart chakra, she nodded, never letting her dark eyes off us.\n\u201cWelcome to the Bakunawa,\u201d Onome said, introducing us.\nOur hitchhiker said her name was Adena. \u201cI was on my way to join my family for the opposition of Earth and Mars when I passed too close to a comet and one of my solar collectors started malfunctioning,\u201d she said, breathing hard. Adena clutched the handrails to stay upright. Astronomical solar gliders are too small to grab significant Gs, so you\u2019re just out there\u2014slow and meandering, weightless inside a tin can. The Baku was early in its deceleration sequence. Being near Earth-standard gravity must have been beating the shit out of her. She didn\u2019t complain.\n\u201cWe can assist with repairs,\u201d Onome said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be any trouble. I can manage on my own,\u201d Adena said. \u201cI just need a safe place to dock.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d Onome said. \u201cBex is one of the best engineers in the system.\u201d\n\u201cIf the problem is with one of your solar collectors,\u201d I said, nudging around Mike, \u201cchances are it\u2019s the lines running from the sails to your batteries. I can take a look and print up replacement parts on my next shift. These are basic maintenance tasks you should really be on top of yourself, though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about a full diagnostic there, Bex?\u201d Mike said.\n\u201cIt\u2019d take a few hours,\u201d I said. \u201cThe astronomical is pretty beat up, so there\u2019s probably a thousand different problems.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but a full diagnostic will tell you what to prioritize,\u201d Mike said. \u201cProblems tend to be holistic.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather hit the obvious ones and get this thing space-worthy quick.\u201d\n\u201cA full diagnostic, chief,\u201d Onome said. \u201cIf it takes a few hours, best to start on now.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said, retreating into the pointlessness of my rank. \u201cI\u2019ll have the Baku\u2019s AI run a full diagnostic.\u201d\nAdena pressed her fist against her heart chakra and nodded. \u201cMy ship is in your capable hands,\u201d she said.\nOnome, desperate for a conversation with anyone other than me or Mike, clomped away, chatting with a blissed-out Adena, holding her arm for support. Personally, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be so trusting of a stranger fixing my ship. I\u2019d also keep my rig in better repair.\nBefore I could enlist his help, Mike saluted me and took off for the bridge.\nMy eyes twitched. I wanted to crash out in my bunk.\nPatchouli scented the corridor. Adena had left a touchscreen control panel on the hatch of her astronomical unlocked. I used my reckoner, a handheld computer, to do a quick handshake and sync with the astronomical\u2019s diagnostic tools. The astronomical ran ancient software with a UI I hadn\u2019t seen since I was an apprentice. I asked the Baku\u2019s AI to push out software updates.\nThere was a little strangeness in the oxygen recyclers, which I dismissed in the moment, focusing instead on the solar battery system. All things in time.\nI inhaled another dose of Alertec with a chaser of gentian root to calm my eye spasms, and I did my job because even if it\u2019s a shit job that\u2019s the job you do.\nAfter a long shift, gardening settles my mind. While the Baku\u2019s AI automated the initial repair sequence I\u2019d programmed, I hunkered down to pull some carrots in the biome where we grow produce in soil collected from Earth. Well, the whole ship is a biome, if you think about it. But the original starship engineers decided our gardens, arboretums, or green spaces were the ship\u2019s \u201cbiomes\u201d and the other areas on our ships were work or living spaces.\nEach carrot was a thumb-sized knob of expensive water, sugars, proteins, and fibers grown in soil collected from Earth. I chucked each nubbin into a bucket to be rinsed off, packed into a compostable container, and delivered to the galley. The captain lent a hand in our little garden biome when it occurred to her, and Mike, who only ate stuff formed out of plankton paste, never did.\nWe grow fruits and veggies, aloe vera, sansevierias and other oxygen-cleansing ferns, flowers, legumes and similar nitrogen-fixing plants. And we have a few live oak trees planted in a soil bed I designed that allows the tree\u2019s root system to spread beneath the floorboards of the biome. On Earth, live oaks seem to defy gravity with their heavy, horizontal branches, and it was no different on our ship where tree branches embraced the room.\nI rustled around the base of the largest live oak like a sleepy elemental woodland spirit, ready to take a well-deserved nap, when I discovered the hitchhiker resting against a tree trunk, legs splayed out in front of her body. She\u2019d been so quiet.\n\u201cAm I in your spot?\u201d Adena said. Removing her cap, silvery braids spilled around her face. \u201cOnome said it was okay for me to be here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a good spot.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this in years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very peaceful.\u201d\nAdena had a pretty chill vibe. The blue clay had stained most of her skin turquoise, which complemented her dark purple eyes. You can get purple contacts, but these were real. Like, a genetic mod, for sure. Mellow aura. Visionary. Healing. Super mystical. If Adena ever left her zero gravity existence permanently, her body would crack like an egg.\n\u201cThings with your ship are coming along,\u201d I said. \u201cMy hunch about the lines running from your solar collectors was right. Not that I\u2019m bragging. I\u2019ve seen it all by now. You\u2019ve probably experienced a lot of loss for a while. We\u2019re printing replacement parts.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to share your resources.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we share what we can. That\u2019s the code of the road.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, please let me know.\u201d\n\u201cI am wondering about the gathering. The captain mentioned an opposition. I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\u201cAn opposition between Earth, Mars, and the Sun occurs around about every two years. Due to all of their orbits, some oppositions bring them closer than others. The coming perihelic opposition is the closest the planets will have ever been in two hundred and eighty-four years\u2014for the largest gathering of solar gliders ever. We\u2019ll worship together at a point beyond Mars. The alignment of the planets with the Sun creates a cone of healing\u2014we\u2019re inside the cone now. Can you feel it?\u201d\n\u201cI want to, but I don\u2019t think I know how,\u201d I said. Heading into hour seventy-ninety-twelve of awaked-ness, I wasn\u2019t experiencing anything healthy or conical. I\u2019d been running the same route a long time, and I was sensitive enough in that moment, safe beneath the branches of the live oak, to recognize how physically and emotionally worn out I was, sure, but I was also tired all the time; tired of the life I\u2019d been leading, and I wanted to change. I\u2019d washed out years ago. Anyway. That\u2019s some angst to drop on a friendly stranger.\n\u201cHave you visited my ship?\u201d Adena said, reading my aura.\n\u201cOnly as far as the airlock.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you the tour,\u201d she said, hooking her arm through mine.\nRepair drones circled the exterior of Adena\u2019s ship. Much of the golden-brown paint on the ship\u2019s hull had been scraped away, revealing gray chrome panels, scuffs from docking clamps, and pounded-out dents.\nA whoosh of strange air hit me in the face as I opened the airlock\u2014a familiar, chemical smell, soon consumed by the oils Adena favored. I let it go. By the end of a long haul, the Baku\u2019s air can take on the tang of halitosis, too.\nAdena said she\u2019d named her solar glider astronomical the Aldebaran, after the red dwarf star that followed after the Pleiades. \u201cI follow where the stars lead,\u201d she said.\nThat kinda talk usually turned me right off. Hanging out with this floating blue woman in her solar-powered starship that smelled of Nag Champa and sweat, my third eye was open.\nThe Aldebaran was cramped yet tidy. Beyond the airlock was a small utility room, odds and ends strapped to the walls. The watering system clucked on in a biome with shelves and glow lights, overflowing with whatnots. Beads of water glimmered weightless in the air.\nAdena\u2019s cabin was across the hall. The top bunk was unmade with a heavy blanket strapped to a mattress. Out of respect, I only gave the room a glance.\nAt the end of the corridor was the cockpit, a narrow space with two jump chairs and an expansive view of the stars. The bridge of the Baku was fully enclosed with all of its navigational systems automated when not being operated by Mike, smearing his greasy fingerprints on the screens.\nThe cosmos through an opened shield viewer set off a dormant case of agoraphobia in me. I know that sounds strange. I\u2019ve spent most of my life on a starship. Even on Earth, how often do you get an opportunity to look out on a view of nothing and everything at the same time?\n\u201cMakes you feel small,\u201d Adena said, between breaths. \u201cDuring the opposition, we\u2019ll gather our ships and commune with each other. We\u2019ll be one large community. I miss that.\u201d\nAdena settled into her chair.\nI moved a book from the seat to join her in the copilot\u2019s station. \u201cIs this a logbook?\u201d I said.\n\u201cEverything is in there.\u201d\nMy eyes crossed as I thumbed through the pages.\nAir recyclers whooshed and clunked as repair drones clanked against the hull.\nA twinkling star.\nAdena said it was Aldebaran.\nThere and here.\nSure, any star can be anything you want.\nIf there are lifeforms living near it maybe they have their own name for their Sun.\nI closed my eyes and drifted asleep.\n\u201cBex.\u201d\nAn oxygen mask hugged my mouth and chin. I was on the Baku, strapped into a medical station. My jumpsuit was unzipped to my waist, gizmos plugged against my chest. An IV in my right arm kept me from bending it at the elbow. The last thing I remembered was a sweet, narcoleptic sensation washing over me. I\u2019d been inside the deep sleep, the stuff beyond REM and dreams where our minds do the heavy work of maintaining and negotiating our existence.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Adena?\u201d I said, my tongue too stiff to form the words clearly. A great rumbling in my chest exploded, and I coughed hard exhalations of air.\nAdena\u2019s body rested in the med station next to me. Straps held her body against the cushions. Adena\u2019s purple eyes were fixed at a point beyond consciousness. The captain closed them. Flakes of blue clay danced around her face. Her bunched-up poncho floated in a corner of the room before crumbling against the floor. We were deep into the deceleration cycle now.\nI\u2019d been dead for three minutes.\nThe captain explained what she knew. The diagnostic of the Aldebaran found that the ship\u2019s atmosphere system was failing; that an excess of carbon monoxide, entering via a small series of leaks in different systems, had mixed with the oxygen.\n\u201cYou know how common CO is in space, Bex,\u201d Mike said. His fat nose sucked in all of the blood in his body. A purple vein in his bald head pulsed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you check the diagnostic before boarding the ship?\u201d\n\u201cHow long was I asleep, Cap?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer to Mike.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Onome said, her face a furrowed mess of lines. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until an alert went off on the Baku that there was a CO leak that we thought to look for you. We followed it to the airlock, which was open to the Aldebaran. That\u2019s how we saved your life, Bex.\u201d\nThe logbook from the Aldebaran was still in my hands. Tears danced in the air around my face, catching the light, sparkling with the bokeh of distant stars.\nIn the time that followed, I went over the Baku\u2019s logs, trying to justify my mistake.\nI couldn\u2019t.\nThe diagnostic turned up the interstellar CO during its initial scan, and I\u2019d overridden the AI to put off cleaning the oxygen recyclers and atmosphere system until after the solar batteries were repaired. CO is very common in space; Mike was correct on that point. I must have taken it for granted because there was no reason why the repairs couldn\u2019t have run in parallel. It was a dumb, random mistake. One I don\u2019t think I would have allowed to happen if I\u2019d been keeping my shit together.\nAdena had been breathing in small amounts of CO for days if not weeks. I could have fixed it without any effort or consequence. I failed her.\nNot wanting to prolong the investigation, I laid it all bare in the incident report, breaking everything down for thorough examination. I produced a strong, competent report and took ownership of my failures, which is what you do. But I still didn\u2019t expect it to end my career.\nOnome waited to visit until after she\u2019d heard back from corporate. Humiliated and depressed, I hadn\u2019t left my cabin since Adena died. Mike left me alone, and I don\u2019t think it was done out of empathy. Maybe it scared him. The fragility of starship life. I like to think that if the situation were reversed, I\u2019d have reached out to him. I like to think that.\n\u201cBex, I have bad news,\u201d Onome said.\n\u201cI\u2019m fired, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nOnome tried to hold my hand. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it an early retirement. But effective immediately, you are relieved of your duties.\u201d\n\u201cIs that it then for the investigation?\u201d\n\u201cWe have to be self-sufficient out here, and the insurance adjusters use an algorithm in these cases to determine risk. Adena wasn\u2019t a member of our crew, and to the best of anyone\u2019s knowledge, she wasn\u2019t registered to her ship or with the space agencies or guilds. Her ship was compromised already, and in trying to help her with repairs, you almost died with her. Not to sound cold\u2014we work in a very high-risk environment. You produced a very thorough, very honest report. That went a long way in your favor.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I should be grateful my career is over?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still alive. I\u2019m sorry, Bex. I share a bit of the responsibility for what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI should have forced you to go off duty. You were way overtime\u2014that\u2019s on me to monitor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did they hit you with?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Onome said.\n\u201cIf we share any of this responsibility, why am I the one out on his ass?\u201d\n\u201cBex. I spoke up for you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you did.\u201d\n\u201cI really tried to keep you with us. You have more years on this ship than anyone, but . . . \u201d\n\u201cDo you still trust me?\u201d\nOnome squeezed my shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few weeks before we get back to the station. I\u2019ll set up counseling when you return to Earth. For now, the worst of it is over.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said.\nI didn\u2019t want to return to Earth, where I\u2019d have to rehash why I\u2019d been forced to retire for the rest of my life. Even with the pension, I\u2019d need to make ends meet. What happens when no one trusts you to do the only job you know how to do? What happens when you don\u2019t trust yourself?\nGoing home wasn\u2019t an option.\nI took a quarter dose of Alertec with a new cocktail of supplements I\u2019d started on during my recovery. Resveratrol for my immune system; phosphatidylcholine to help repair the cellular damage from, well, dying; ubiquinol to charge up my regenerating cells; GABA to avoid the brain farts; melatonin so I knew when to sleep; and a bunch of other stuff to detox from the CO poison and antibiotics, as well as my regular dosage of vitamins and nutraceuticals.\nAnd I read Adena\u2019s logbook.\nThe book was an analog history of the Aldebaran, documenting the ship\u2019s progress as it drifted through the cosmos: a physical, leather-bound book object, its pages filled with mileage and fuel ratios, supply inventories, and the ship\u2019s daily position.\nAdena had drawn lines around the stars where she\u2019d traveled, forming words that she shaped like how living without gravity had shaped her body. Each letter flowed and curled, looped and dashed. The straightforward journaling of facts and figures transcended the page, creating a shape of her life that made sense to me. The ship drifted under the power of solar radiation, yes, but it was never lost in space. Adena knew where she was going, even when she had no urgency to be anywhere. She had been on her way to the gathering for years, patiently channeling the orbit of the Aldebaran to go where it needed to be. She lived her life in the time between destinations.\nThe kind of time I misplaced.\nBurials in space are as dramatic as you want them to be. Either your last will requests your body be fired out to the depths or you\u2019re fed to the ship\u2019s recycler system to be broken down into raw elements, usable to the ship\u2019s needs.\nWith the magnetic locks in her boots keeping our feet pressed against the floorboards, Onome met me under the flat, sterile lights of the medbay. We\u2019d pass Mars soon. I hadn\u2019t asked Onome to meet me so much as demanded. We needed to decide what to do with Adena\u2019s body\u2014we two who were responsible.\nAdena was stored in a sealed capsule, a coffin. I\u2019d moved the capsule to the center of the medbay, near the station where I\u2019d recovered.\n\u201cWhat can I help you with, Bex?\u201d Onome said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, placing my hands on the cold metal container. \u201cI\u2019ve searched the Aldebaran\u2019s logs for a will, and I\u2019m almost certain Adena didn\u2019t leave one. I can\u2019t track down any relations back on Earth, either. I don\u2019t know what she would have wanted done with her . . . her remains.\u201d\n\u201cI want to be respectful, of course,\u201d Onome said. \u201cWhat are your feelings?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late for her. We\u2019re still on the right course. I\u2019ve run the calculations.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not following you.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aldebaran is clean. It\u2019s good. Fully repaired. If I leave tomorrow, I can make it to the gathering. The solar sail nomads will know what Adena would have wanted\u2014what\u2019s respectful to her wishes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I can let you take the Aldebaran. Technically, it might be owned by the corporation now,\u201d Onome said. \u201cThere\u2019s also your pension to consider. It\u2019s all yours to lose right now, chief.\u201d\n\u201cThis is my responsibility.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be. Stop right now and you can walk away with everything you\u2019ve worked for all these years.\u201d\n\u201cCap, if I go home, even with my pension, I\u2019m going to be working on a loading dock until I drop dead. If I could afford to live on Earth, I never would have left. It\u2019s why we\u2019re up here instead of down there. I\u2019m not asking for your help or your permission. All I need is for you to look away for a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cBex, you\u2019re making this so much more difficult.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s so simple. We fix a lot of problems this way. If we were going to say some words over her, we would have done that by now. Instead, we\u2019re treating Adena like cargo. You spoke to her, too, Cap. You knew her as well as I did, which is not at all, sure, but you were with her when she was still alive. What does that mean to you? Things happen for a reason. Adena understood that. When was the last time you actually looked at the stars outside this ship?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not having this conversation,\u201d Onome said.\n\u201cI think we are having this conversation.\u201d\n\u201cBex, no, this conversation didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nCaptain Onome created a triangle with her thumbs and forefinger. She pushed the triangle away from her chest, toward me. I remembered Adena and clenched my right hand into a fist with the tip of my thumb extending from between my index and middle fingers\u2014catching the energy the captain sent me.\nAll eyes were elsewhere.\nIf you\u2019ve done a good job, your garden will live on without you.\nAdena\u2019s body rested in the now-empty biome of the Aldebaran, along with a collection of plants and seeds I\u2019d harvested from the Baku, and a live oak cutting. I\u2019d start a new garden. Until then, Adena could be amongst nature or something like it.\nDuring repairs, I\u2019d flushed the solar glider\u2019s entire atmosphere system. Upgraded all of the ship\u2019s software, starting from its factory settings. I repaired the hull. Fixed the solar sails and batteries. I made the ship new. I made it mine. And now it was time to go.\nAfter its overhaul, the Aldebaran\u2019s OS andUI were simplified versions of the Baku\u2019s systems. As I settled into some familiar routines onboard my new home, I kept my eyes on the controls instead of the stars outside the cockpit.\nMy nerves getting the better of me, I turned the controls over to the ship for the launch. When the countdown clock hit zero, the astronomical solar glider\u2014my solar sail\u2014refused to detach from the Baku\u2019s airlock.\nWe were stuck. The Baku refused to cut us loose.\nI unstrapped from my jump chair and pulled my weightless body through the small craft back to the Baku.\nGoddamn Mike was waiting for me. He\u2019d engaged the manual override.\nMike\u2019s smug, ruddy face filled the viewer between our airlocks. He was geared up for an armed insurrection, like a military cosplayer. I gave the glass between us a good pounding. Mike didn\u2019t flinch.\nThe comm clicked on: \u201cCan\u2019t let you steal company property, chief,\u201d Mike said.\n\u201cWhat did I ever do you, Mike?\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s what you could have done,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on out and we can talk about it.\u201d\nI closed the viewer and killed the comms. Engaged the door seals on the Aldebaran. This was not good.\nTime was running out. For the Aldebaran to use the Baku\u2019s orbital velocity and spin out toward the solar glider gathering, I needed to get a move on like now. Or that\u2019s what I thought. Starship time, like I said, is weird.\nMy reckoner was still connected to both ships\u2019 systems. Back in the cockpit of the Aldebaran, I set to work.Visualizations of the Baku\u2019s systems blipped up from the face of my reckoner. As they did, I plucked the necessary system visualizations and tossed them at the Aldebaran\u2019s control panel. When I had everything I needed, I hailed the Baku.\n\u201cBex, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Onome said, her voice shaky.\n\u201cAsk Mike,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought we had a deal.\u201d\n\u201cI guess neither of us thought to loop Mike in. What are you doing, Bex? We have systems prepped for a space walk?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going up top to unlock all the clamps and shit.\u201d\nGotta love a good EVA suit, and the EVA suits on the Aldebaran were forgiving to my physique. The nylon and spandex material, reinforced with nickel-titanium shape alloys, hugged the bod, while providing protection from the cold, radioactive, vacuum of space.\n\u201cBex, you haven\u2019t done a space walk in years.\u201d\n\u201cI used to do this kind of thing all the time, Cap. I\u2019ve got my reckoner synced with the Baku and the Aldebaran. This\u2019ll be a cinch.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re still decelerating, Bex! You could be thrown from the hull before you can get back inside your ship. I\u2019m ordering you back to the Baku. Mike can help you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t go back. Not now,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d I floated near a maintenance hatch, reckoner ready to pop the lid on this thing. I took an Alertec cut with B12 and creatine.\nStatic blasted through the comms for a precious stretch of time.\nClunks and clanks banged around the outside of the Aldebaran as the Baku released the solar glider astronomical from its grasp. My ship fell free, cast off from the Baku, tumbling away.\nThe captain said, \u201cBex, listen\u2014\u201d\nStrapping into my station, I killed the comms, as well as the connection between my reckoner and the Baku, giving up all of my control, and probably any chance of collecting on my pension, too.\nThe Baku turned its back to me, and I turned my back on it.\nTime to go. Time to transcend.\nBanking left, I folded forward in my jump chair to adjust the navigation controls. Silver Mylar solar-collecting sails extended from the glider. Solar photons goosed the ship\u2019s sail, while the solar cells on the astronomical\u2019s hull soaked up the necessary energy to keep the batteries full and the air recyclers running at one hundred percent purity. I adjusted the course while I could. Ultimately, the ship had to find its own way.\nI updated the logbook. The book was Adena\u2019s will. She\u2019d want to continue her journey to the end.\nSome of the time I\u2019d lost came back. Weird how that works.\nBeyond the curvature of Mars, deep in the eclipsing shadow of the Sun, paper lanterns floated toward the heavens. The flotilla of solar sails twinkled, greeting me with quiet bursts of light. Beyond the rafts, Earth hid behind Mars\u2019 eccentric orbit.\nWe moved into alignment, following the off-beaten paths, worshipping the planets.\nFrank Smith is a writer living in Austin, Texas where he maintains a love-hate relationship with agave plants.

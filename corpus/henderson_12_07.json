Always it began in the pantry, at first\u2014she was tallying the beer, or the bags of grain, when the first joints of her fingers started to itch. Little more than a prickling warmth, then a fierce burning, and as she twisted and scratched them for relief they sprouted fur, some gray, some brown. One by one they disjointed, split away from her hands and fell to the floor, where they scampered into the corners. She thrust her hands into the folds of her gowns to save them, but it was no use\u2014joint by joint her fingers changed into mice and ran over her feet until she was left with nothing but two stumpy paddles.\nAnd then she\u2019d wake, sometimes alone, sometimes besides her husband\u2019s softly breathing body, and check her fingers in the moonlight to see if they were still there. If she was alone she\u2019d rise and go to the cellars, checking for nibbled food and dung in the corners.\nShe was alone more and more. One thing she\u2019d learned was that the smaller the kingdom, the more the king had to take into his own hands. He was away from home more often than not, now, and stayed in his own rooms most of the time when he was home, with councilors and petitions and the business of an almost-prosperous land.\nAnother thing she\u2019d learned was that her business was with the beer, and the bags of grain, and the stores kept in stone-lined cisterns beneath the ground, and keeping the woman a-weaving. Her business was her son, for now, and she knew that when he was grown enough he would become part of the men\u2019s world with his father and learn the ways of a countrified prince.\nThen it happened when she was awake, walking the halls to her rooms, leaving the candle behind and trusting to the torchlight. Her hands felt thick and itchy, and when she lifted them they fell away joint by joint, little dark bodies running to the walls and vanishing between the stones. She waited an instant to wake, then screamed when she didn\u2019t.\nShe staggered against the wall as a curious maid poked her head around the corner, eyes widening as she recognized her.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, my lady?\u201d The maid came forward, brisk, in no sort of awe whatsoever. Because she wasn\u2019t a proper queen, she wasn\u2019t a lady, she was a miller\u2019s daughter with an odd kind of luck. So far the servants treated her with condescending sympathy.\nShe raised her hands, for show or to defend herself, but they were normal\u2014strong peasant\u2019s hands with short, clean nails and losing their calluses.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she managed, then \u201cnothing\u201d again, in a tone that tried to be imperious and failed. \u201cI just tripped, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n2\nThe dwarf smelled her long before she came over the rise of the hill: the soap she used and the oil at the roots of her hair, and skin that never lost a touch of the sun and the faint tang of soured milk. The boy, too\u2014the sweat of its toiling beside its mother and a diaper clout that needed changing. They paused at the crest while she sought the entrance to his dwelling in the shadow of the valley below; a shelter hacked from the living stone of the mountainside. He stood in the doorway, not bothering to conceal himself. She spotted him and stumbled downhill, dragging the tired child behind her.\n\u201cHe wants me to do it again\u2014the weaving,\u201d she said, without preamble.\n\u201cTook him a while,\u201d he replied, dryly.\nShe started to cry, because she knew what he was going to say and realized the truth of it the instant before he spoke. He turned inside the cave and beckoned her to follow. It was cozy inside, and roomier than she\u2019d imagined. Red coals glowed on a long, low hearth. A squat battered kettle sat there, with a water bucket in the corner.\n\u201cHe\u2019s finding a reason to despise you. He feels guilty for doing it with no justification,\u201d he threw over his shoulder.\nShe was such a child. She didn\u2019t know that he could hate her so.\nShe spoke to his back as he lifted the kettle.\n\u201cYou sent them. The dreams. My fingers: mice. It was you.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t turn around. She waited while he built up the fire under the heavy-bottomed copper, and folded her fingers carefully across her stomach. Afterwards he leaned against the mantle, built small to accommodate his height.\n\u201cI felt sorry for you, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the beginning, even. That\u2019s why I came in the first place. Sympathy you\u2019d have for a snail in the path, or a turtle turned over in the sun. And then, after the first night\u2014no more than that\u2014you started to enjoy it, the attention that you feared so much before. I could see it in you. You almost believed you could do it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nWere her fingers beginning to itch? She twisted them in her skirt and didn\u2019t look.\nIt\u2019s true, she thought. I did think I could spin straw into gold. Not because I could, but because ugliness should serve beauty. Isn\u2019t that always the way?\n\u201cYou were quick enough to agree to the child,\u201d he said, giving her the side of his face, the silhouette of a long, gnarled nose. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t blame you, for your loving man would have killed you just to make the point. That\u2019s a king\u2019s job, you know. To make a point. And perhaps he didn\u2019t want to marry you so much, for there are beautiful women enough of his own rank. But he had promised, you see. And he made his point.\u201d\n\u201cYou hated me.\u201d\n\u201cYes. For a long time.\u201d He poked at the fire and a great clot of sparks flew up, some landing on the hearth and squirming like lit worms before darkening into black ashy spots. In the corner, the boy chuckled over some toy.\n\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have sent the dreams if you hadn\u2019t played the game of not knowing the third day. Belshazzar, Cruickshanks. Conrad. Harry.\u201d His voice became burred and rough at the edges. \u201cThree days you played me like a salmon.\u201d\nShe said nothing, being an inland girl. She had never tasted salmon.\n3\nThe girl wrapped potatoes in damp clothes and pushed them into the coals banked behind the hearth. The men in the doorway were not going to go away, but she made them wait for all that. She heard one grunt softly and shift his weight.\nShe\u2019d grown a lot the past year and had to bend her head to avoid hitting the arch of the fireplace, which had been built too low for human kind.\n\u201cMy brother left years ago,\u201d she said, finally, still kneeling and staring at the coals. \u201cHe visits sometimes, and brings game from the forest. Less and less these days.\u201d\n\u201cDoes he know who he is?\u201d One of the men\u2014the taller, thin one\u2014surged forward, shrugging off the other\u2019s restraining hand. \u201cDo you?\u201d\nHe stopped as she turned, her eyes cold and hard and blue, so blue they were almost violet at the edges. Her father\u2019s eyes, a king\u2019s eyes, chilly and appraising. She said nothing.\nThe thin man flinched but stood his ground. He made an effort to gentle his voice.\n\u201cYour pardon. But your father is dying, and dying with no successor. Your brother is his heir.\u201d\nShe was still kneeling, still looking up at him, and now she smiled very slightly and the thin man felt that to stand over her was no advantage at all.\n\u201cHis heir? What, with a miller\u2019s slut-girl for a mother, who ran away from court to return to the squalor she came from?\u201d\nThe thin man swallowed and stood his ground.\n\u201cEven so, my lady.\u201d\nShe sighed and looked back at the coals. The roasting potatoes filled the rough-hewn chamber with the smell of clean dirt.\n\u201cHe hunts,\u201d she said, finally, rising and dusting the ash off her full skirts. \u201cTrack him down in the wild wood, if you must, but don\u2019t seek him here, not if you value your lives.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t move, glancing at each other nervously. The other man, who stood in the doorway, was shorter and stouter than his companion. He cleared his throat.\n\u201cWe do not seek only your brother, my lady,\u201d he rumbled.\n\u201cAh?\u201d she was grinning now. \u201cMy own humble self? But I would not inherit; I couldn\u2019t. Perhaps my dam carried me in her belly to the manikin\u2019s house, perhaps he got me on her\u2014isn\u2019t that what they say? You\u2019d never prove the king\u2019s my father.\u201d\n\u201cBut your mother was your mother,\u201d said the stout man. \u201cAnd your mother had her gifts.\u201d\n\u201cPieter,\u201d said the thin man to his companion.\nThe girl laughed: a harsh bark. \u201cSo! Straw into gold, is it? If she could, then I can? How does your master\u2019s kingdom these days, Pieter? Are there small economies? Is the wine cheap and raw in your throat? Are there discontented whispers outside the chamber of the dying king?\u201d\nThe thin man turned to expostulate with Pieter, but the bulkier man pushed him aside roughly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough about it,\u201d he growled, to his companion or to the girl.\n\u201cFine threads of gold, reams of it, spilling on the floor and piling under the window. Enough to buy a kingdom, much less . . . \u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m useless to you, gentlemen,\u201d she returned, lifting her fingers spread like a fan in front of their faces. \u201cFor see?\u201d\nAnd before their eyes her fingers sprouted fur, and separated from each other joint by joint, and scampered to the floor with a squeak and a flutter, with a twitch and a shiver of bright, beady eye.\nThe thin man started back with a shudder; Pieter never got a chance, because a great hairy bulk loomed behind him, wrapped a beefy arm around his throat, and lifted him half a foot off the floor as he choked him.\nBut the thin man didn\u2019t run, not even then; it was only when he saw the footprints the girl had made in the ash and sand of the hearth that he ran\u2014not footprints, but claw marks, a bird\u2019s foot, like those the chickens make outside the kitchen door, but huge, monstrous.\nHe turned and pushed past the enormous man and the gasping Pieter and vanished into the night.\nThe big man released Pieter, who fell to the floor in a limp bundle.\n\u201cIs he dead, Bearskin?\u201d asked the girl.\nHer brother shrugged. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\nShe returned to the fire and poked at the potatoes with the stumps of her hands.\n\u201cWe have to go,\u201d she said.\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have places to hide you in the forest. And they will be afraid of you for a while.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she returned, tucking the hot potatoes in her apron and wrapping them against her. \u201cBut not long enough.\u201d The cave was rustling with mice, scampering over the ashes, over the mantle, across Pieter\u2019s limp body.\nShe followed her brother into the forest, the potatoes warm against her thighs and the stubs of her hands, warm against the tiny fingers that were sprouting from her bloodless flesh."}

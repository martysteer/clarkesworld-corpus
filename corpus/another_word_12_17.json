But the further I delved into the nuances of the answers I received, the muddier the waters became.\n As social media continues to amplify the volume of fan voices across the globe, this question has been asked louder and more frequently in recent times. Fandom is power, especially in a capitalist society where fans are more than willing to put their money where their virtual mouths are. We can cancel shows and end careers, resurrect characters and drag a series on long past its natural end. We are many. We are mighty. We are the gathering horde and oncoming storm. We are the mob. We can be benevolent . . . and dangerous.\n So, what do authors/creators owe us?\n If you take out the qualifiers: What does anyone owe anyone else? Well, that\u2019s easy enough. Nothing.\n A large percentage of the answers I received were just that: Authors owe us nothing. Authors are actual people, with actual lives. When the spirit moves them to sit down and create their art, fans should feel lucky. Excited. Awed. Amazed. And then we need to move on to the next beautiful thing and leave the artist alone to create\u2014or not\u2014as they will.\n Or, as Neil Gaiman famously phrased it eight years ago (yes, it really has been eight years): George R. R. Martin is not your bitch. \u201cLife is a good thing for a writer. It\u2019s where we get our raw material, for a start. We quite like to stop and watch it.\u201d\n Neil says that a book is not a contract with the reader. Technically, no it is not. However, it could be argued that people who choose writing as a profession know that they\u2019re entering into a unique relationship with their readers.\n When a story lives and breathes inside the mind of an author, it is one hundred percent the author\u2019s property. Similarly, when that book is written and sitting on the hard drive, the author has complete control over his or her work of art.\n When it is published, it evolves into a completely new thing.\n I have heard many an author wax rhapsodic about how published books are a collaboration. Words, editors, cover art, illustrations, publicity (perception), and the mind of the reader all work together to create a fascinating new world. This team\u2019s job is to make sure readers fall in love with the thing they have created. And then the author is forced to move on to the next project.\n These readers\u2014now fans\u2014are encouraged to lose their hearts to a thing. At which point, they become the person pining after unrequited love in a fabricated relationship.\n As fans, we see ourselves in a book\u2019s characters. We dress up as them. Write fan fiction about them. Go to conventions and speak on panels about them. Teach them in classes. Watch them in movies and on television. These characters come to mean so much to us, personally. More than the author will ever know.\n (Of course, chances are, the author does know. It\u2019s often why they became an author in the first place.)\n The other most common answer to my question was \u201cThe author owes us a good book.\u201d\n It\u2019s a two-part answer. And a loaded one.\n \u201cThe author owes us a book.\u201d Sure. You fall in love with a series, and you\u2019d like to read more in the series. I get that. If for any reason the series has to end, you would (maybe) be satisfied (maybe) reading a book by that same author about something else.\n \u201cGood\u201d is so incredibly subjective. One of the first lessons authors learn is that they can\u2019t please all of the people all of the time. Some yahoo in the crowd is going to give you one star for whatever reason. It happens. But authors are told not to read reviews. Instead, they are encouraged to concentrate on a new project.\n And how often are these new, good books expected to appear in the world? Once upon time, we\u2019d get a new release every one to two years and be happy about it. Tomorrow isn\u2019t fast enough for some fans these days.\n Right before my Last Book came out, I put a new project on hold for one week so that I could spend time writing a few guest blogs and essays. I knew I was supposed to be writing the Next Thing, but that Last Book turned out to be one of my favorite books ever, and I just wanted to spend a few days enjoying it before I moved on. I\u2019m sure only a handful of people read those essays, and it got down to the wire on the deadline for that Next Thing, but I was glad I had taken the time. Because I actually like the stories that I write. And I don\u2019t get a whole lot of free time to appreciate them anymore.\n Gaiman said that writers were not machines. But those authors who are living off their paltry writing income kind of have to be. It\u2019s tough. But that\u2019s the job, right?\n Ready for some interesting statistics?\n Recently, LitRing asked a similar question of its readers: \u201cWhat do you wish more authors would do for their readers?\u201d\n 22% answered \u201cbook content.\u201d (Similar to the \u201ca good book\u201d answer given above.)\n 21% answered \u201cfree books.\u201d Excerpts are not enough. They want the first book in the series free, and any other book that\u2019s free. Sites like BookBub and Robin Reads feature newsletters in which readers are notified of free content on a daily basis. Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? (Wait, you mean this wasn\u2019t what Mom was talking about when she said this?)\n 18% answered \u201cmore interaction.\u201d Unfortunately, this piece of the pie is a double-edged sword. Authors can spend a solid month on guest blogs and Skype visits and FB live videos and Instagram stories, but if it doesn\u2019t happen to come across a reader\u2019s social media feed the exact moment they log in, it never happened. Authors can make themselves available until the cows come home, but the algorithms are against them if The Machine thinks that they are in any way trying to sell something. That content is usually out there, if the reader looks for it. I\u2019m curious how much of the 18% who said this actually went looking.\n 15% answered \u201cgiveaways.\u201d Preferably in the form of retail gift cards.\n If the author could please write the books, give away the books for free, and then spend the rest of their precious time and money keeping everyone happy, it would be a readers\u2019 paradise.\n If you think this sounds insane, you\u2019re not alone. And yet, this is the world we have created. There are hundreds, probably thousands of new authors every day. If a reader doesn\u2019t want to pay for a book, they don\u2019t have to. They only have to interact with the author on their time, if they so choose. They can get a Kindle Unlimited or similar subscription, sign up for all the newsletters that contain giveaways, go to a hundred conventions and collect only swag. Because they can.\n Authors are jumping through incredible hoops just to get attention.\n Now, you\u2019re welcome to pull this survey\u2014and LitRing\u2019s data pool\u2014to pieces, but I\u2019ve got to say, as annoying as their results may be, I didn\u2019t find them very shocking. This is the literary world we have created today. As frustrated as fans might be with GRRM or Pat Rothfuss or anyone else they\u2019re waiting on a book from, it\u2019s that much more frustrating for the millions of other authors out there trying to eke out a living. The battle between \u201cwhat an author can realistically accomplish\u201d and \u201cwhat is expected of them\u201d is never-ending.\n My favorite answer to the \u201cWhat authors owe us\u201d question came from my friend, number one New York Times bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon. \u201cRespect,\u201d Sherri said without needing to stop and think about it. \u201cThe author owes their readers respect.\u201d\n I liked this answer because it was not about books or appearances or time spent on social media. It\u2019s more about mutual appreciation in a polite society. In a perfect world, this might be the best of all answers.\n Alethea Kontis is a princess, author, fairy godmother, and geek.

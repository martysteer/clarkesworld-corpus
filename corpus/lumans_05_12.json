By headlamp only I carve a chess piece\u2014a knight\u2014out of moon rock. I\u2019d crushed one earlier after Tchaikovsky called me out on a dumb move.\nThe screen and radio cut out. I switch channels, then switch back to hear: \u201cGet up. You need to see this.\u201d Tamsen sounds serious. She always sounds serious. It\u2019s one of the things I like most about her.\n\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d I keep sanding the knight\u2019s head. When no response follows, just space static, I give in. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nMore static, then: \u201cThe Russians.\u201d\nI blow on the knight. Moondust reels through the headlamp\u2019s beam. I think it beautiful. I\u2019d carved this set my first month here on the moon. The dust I compare to stars. The space between them, too, is beautiful. And the same old lines are running through my head\u2014Goodnight room, goodnight moon\u2014the ones I\u2019d read in bed to my daughters. I grab the mic: \u201cTell Tchaikovsky he needs to ready his Nastoyka supply.\u201d\nTchaikovsky is a mold pirate, the one thing we have in the way of a rival. But he\u2019s also a good chess player. He studied his masters. Knew openings I\u2019d never heard of. He\u2019s the only distraction here that keeps me honest. Down on Earth, who has the calm or the fire for chess anymore? Since our four-man crew arrived late last August to harvest the Dreammold!, I\u2019ve been in two modes: defend and defend again. Whether it\u2019s harvesting, carving, or playing, give it 98%. I\u2019ve always been one to open my games with the tried and true; Sicilian Defense all the way. Only recently have I begun to wonder if this is the right way to go about it. Tchaikovsky and I have an unfriendly wager: loser ponies up a bottle of their nation\u2019s choicest liquor. By my count, I\u2019ve handed over seventeen handles of Maker\u2019s Mark. And he? Not a drop of vodka.\nIn four weeks the transport will be here to take us home. I want to win, for once. I want things to go my way.\n\u201cWe found their ship.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of mold out there,\u201d I tell her. \u201cLet the little cosmonaut stake his claim.\u201d I\u2019ve given up playing moon ranger. A year in one-sixth gravity and white rooms and the company of little love does that to good intentions.\nThis time, not even static.\n\u201cTamsen.\u201d I set the knight on d5. \u201cTamsen?\u201d\n\u201c\u2014the problem.\u201d I only catch this last part. But I am busy. A good kind of busy. In eight moves, I\u2019ll have the Russian mated\u2014Rg2++\u2014even after losing my queen early on. And now Tamsen, with whatever problem there is, has carved that good feeling out of me.\nIn Buggy 2, I zoom south to her position at the edge of Tycho Crater. It\u2019s where we go for the best mold harvesting. I can throw a rock into the crater and watch the moldripples go on for miles: yellowyellowyellow. \u201cTwenty-eight days,\u201d I remind myself.\nTamsen\u2019s standing by Buggy 1, big gloved hands on her big suited hips. She\u2019s radioed the rest of the crew too. Bouncing around in our suits, the four of us resemble primitive undersea divers with portholes for masks and twin oxygen tanks. Spitzer\u2019s busy poking the mold. When I used to hear the Rockies\u2019 announcer describe a batter with \u201cwarning track power,\u201d I didn\u2019t realize I was imagining Spitzer. Long-limbed and morally impulsive, he\u2019s always asking me, \u201cWhen do I get to stab the flagpole into something?\u201d Vinegar Tom\u2014he\u2019s just staring into the crater. I\u2019m thankful for our helmets. Yesterday, I\u2019d walked in on him and Tamsen fucking in her room\u2014they didn\u2019t see me\u2014and now I don\u2019t want to look him in the face for the rest of the mission. Not out of shame, but because he got to her first, because it made me realize I\u2019ve always hated this planet. Him. His copy of Desperate Passage: The Donner Party\u2019s Perilous Journey West that he intently flips through in the mess hall like he\u2019s studying one of the buggies\u2019 operation manuals.\nTamsen taps her helmet. I tap mine back. The vidchannel and radio have been fritzing. We haven\u2019t talked with mission control since Tuesday and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with the transmitter. All we hear back is fuzz.\nBeyond her and the others, at the crater\u2019s edge, I see Tchaikovsky\u2019s ship. And I see the mold; that is the problem. What had been his illegal operation is now covered in the Dreammold!, utterly and completely. It\u2019s as if Tycho burped up some fantastic wave that came crashing down mid-ops. The scene reminds me of Denver, the day after.\nI draw a finger across my neck, point at the Russians\u2019 ship, and then shrug. We bounce over to it and pry open the bay door. The vessel\u2019s guts are clogged with as much yellow gunk as the outer shell is coated.\nA flash in me of something Tchaikovsky\u2019d said after taking my queen: \u201cZe bigger zey are, Afraham Lincoln, ze more it rains rats and clogs.\u201d He was forever butchering Americanisms, but sometimes I had to admire the results. They made as much sense on the moon as anything else did back home.\nFifty feet from the Russian\u2019s ship, Tamsen\u2019s waving me over. She stands calf-deep in mold on the crater\u2019s rim. At her feet is a single set of boot tracks. It leads from the ruined ship out into Tycho\u2019s depths.\nBack at base camp, I stare at the same game from before.\n\u201cSo the mold is moving,\u201d says Vinegar Tom from behind me. His voice always sounds surprisingly nasal; surprising because he\u2019s missing his nose. It makes his bucked teeth stand out all the more. \u201cNow we don\u2019t have to drive as far to get it.\u201d\nI\u2019m too preoccupied to respond and too besieged to care.\n\u201cYou had your games with the Commie, I know. It\u2019s terrible. A bad way to go. But we\u2019ve all seen terrible things on the news.\u201d I can hear the smirk in his voice, smell the vinegar on his breath. He\u2019d quit the space program to be a butcher in Ohio, but when The Drought killed that industry, he came trudging back to Cape Canaveral. \u201cThough I suppose some of us have seen it up close,\u201d he goes on. \u201cBeen able to smell the terrible.\u201d He reaches around from behind me and flicks over the white king.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my king, asshole.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nAfter I finish wiping the blood from Vinegar Tom\u2019s lip off my elbow, I say, \u201cTouch my game again, see what happens.\u201d\nHe looks down at the board, then at me, as if considering it. He\u2019s short and brash and sporadically clean-shaven. Exactly the kind of man I can picture behind a meat counter. The skinfolds where his nose should be remind me of how the Rocky Mountains look on military raised-relief maps. \u201cIf we have to eat each other at some point between now and the 30th,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you eat me.\u201d\nAn hour later, I set the white king upright. Eight moves: 37. Qb3 Rd1+ 38. Kg2 Rd2+ 39. Kg3 Ne3 40. Qxe3 Rg2++. I pick up my newest knight. The jawline is clean, the eyes sharp notches. Calmly, I hurl it at the cabin wall. It hits hard and slowly fragments.\nI imagine the conversation at NASA went something like this:\n\u201cSir, the moon is shiny.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been shiny.\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, there are shiny parts.\u201d\n\u201cToday is not April Fool\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\u201cTelescope Two picked them up.\u201d\n\u201cShiny parts?\u201d\n\u201cWe thought it was silver.\u201d\n\u201cMoonsilver. That has a good ring to it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not silver.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Mercury, rhodium, zinc, what isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cTelescope Two is a very good telescope.\u201d\n\u201cMoonsilver.\u201d\n\u201cFirst, sir, it\u2019s important that we keep this a secret.\u201d\n\u201cI agree. Everyone likes jewelry. Everyone\u2019s a magpie.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we mean.\u201d\n\u201cTell me already. You\u2019re killing me here!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s water.\u201d\n\u201cIs water shiny?\u201d\n\u201cWe found shiny water. On the moon.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to say: \u2018shit.\u2019 We said you wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\u201cWho knows about this?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone. Everyone\u2019s a magpie for this kind of news.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure it\u2019s not April Fool\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure it\u2019s not silver.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d\nBy then, The Drought had settled in, five long years and still holding strong. Ice, Aquafina, and public pools were all things of the past. The U.S.\u2019s initial investigative moonlanding found plenty of water. And it found what was growing in the water, too: the mold. We sampled it, brought it to Florida, found it useful. So the U.S. pushed through amendments to the TRIPS agreement to include protections for other planets\u2019 resources. And they shipped the four of us up here to harvest it for a year until the next round of crewmen arrives.\nWe know it\u2019s been almost a year because of the calendar in the mess hall. Each month features a new war poster.\n\u201cTen fingers good! Eight claws bad!\u201d\n\u201cUse your thumbs! Recycle your scrap metal and keep the MegaHun at bay!\u201d\n\u201cWhen you live alone, you live with Megafauns.\u201d\nVinegar Tom says they\u2019re invigorating. I\u2019m sick of them. But there\u2019s little else to focus on between sleeping and eating and sporing and fighting and fucking. And work.\nThe word Dreammold! once summoned in me the image of a fantasyland of iridescent clouds. Now I can\u2019t think of a less suitable name. It\u2019s this terrible yellow, with the look of cauliflower heads but the consistency of dry, packed snow.\nOur only tools: large meat cleavers, T-handle baling hooks, and what\u2019s essentially a giant George Foreman. Everything\u2019s run on solar, even the powercyclers that pump out our CO2. I\u2019d be thrilled by the technology if I thought it\u2019d actually save me.\nStep 1: Cut four-by-four squares out of the moldline.\nStep 2: Hook the square on both sides and lift free.\nStep 3: Place in grill box and seal shut.\nThe box broils the mold and compresses it. These hard pancakes go into storage until the semi-monthly unmanned cargo capsule arrives. Then we unload the capsule\u2019s supplies (dried food, Maker\u2019s Mark, oxygen tanks) before stacking the pancakes in its bay and sending it back to be fashioned into fuel, fixodent, and firearms for the Megafaun War.\nThe hordes hit Denver three days before I was scheduled for liftoff. I was there. Home with my family, eating chocolate chip waffles. The first wave struck late that morning. Wild pigs with mammoth tusks and armor plating. The ground shook. The South Platte sewage flowed backward. Then the rest of the Megafauns streamed out of the mountains, as if they\u2019d been hiding there for centuries, breeding, tripling in size. So thirsty and fast. The winged kind broke into the top floor of the CenturyLink Tower. Fifty-point elks and shaggy aardvarks nested in INVESCO Field. Horned bears with snouts shaped like ice cream scoops covered the suburbs in blood and fur. They came for my family\u2014wife, daughter, younger daughter, youngest daughter, our fox terrier Ralph, me\u2014but we hid in the basement. I thought we\u2019d be fine with a barricaded door. Before dark, I went upstairs for food with Ralph on my heels. Only, he bolted through the doggy door. I found myself chasing him down the street, imagining my daughters\u2019 streaming faces if I had to tell them I lost Ralphie. A block down, heavy grunts sounded from someone\u2019s garage. I had to run home empty-handed. But when I came back down into the basement, arms full of consolation Fruit Roll-Ups and Zebra Cakes and no dog, all I came back to was this big hole. Taken, and not even with a loud crashing I could replay in my head. Just nothing nowhere forever. It must have only taken seconds. I sat down on the stairs. I only thought I heard barking. I ate three Fruit Roll-Ups. I ate six Zebra Cakes. I waited. And when they didn\u2019t come back, I slept in my youngest daughter\u2019s bed, saying, goodnight nobody.\nIn the mess hall, Tamsen and Spitzer are seated on the floor by the powercycler vent. Contact with mission control is still nil. On the calendar, the 30th is circled in red. This month\u2019s poster: a picture of a salivating mastodon-wolf looming over the caption: \u201cThe world cannot exist half-slave and half-food: Fight for Freedom!\u201d Vinegar Tom sits backward on a chair, slouched forward and smiling wide at me. It doesn\u2019t help my already sour mood: no more chess, no more liquor, even the prospect of shipping off-planet seems impossibly far away, as if we wouldn\u2019t survive each other\u2019s company another day. The three of them pass around foil stripped from an air duct and a twin-pronged nosetube and a lighter rigged from the grill box\u2019s heatcoils.\n\u201cKeep sporing,\u201d I say as I crouch between them, \u201cand you\u2019ll sour the meat.\u201d\nAfter Spitzer discovered you could freebase the mold\u2014\u201csporing,\u201d he named it\u2014I opted out. How do you go 98% while spun on fungus? It\u2019s practically a Class-1 drug, complete with four-hour euphoria, hallucinatory episodes, tingling. It also had a nasty tendency to gum up Vinegar Tom\u2019s intestinal system if he didn\u2019t take the right precautions. Yes, people need outlets.\n\u201cCan we go claim some mountain in the name of us?\u201d\n\u201cCan I please plant the flagpole?\u201d\n\u201cCan we sleep together now?\u201d\nSporing also does wonders for the skin. The three of them are tinted gold, Tamsen the deepest. She has dark blonde hair to match, arms and legs that I\u2019d only assumed were well-toned until recently, and a small tight face I started wanting to kiss too late. She sprinkles more spores onto the foil strip, clicks the lighter until the coils at its tip redden. Then, positioning the tube in her nose, she inhales deeply. These are the only times I ever see her relax. Relaxed people\u2014lazy people\u2014worry me.\nTamsen looks straight into my eyes and says, \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely man.\u201d This has all the meaning in the world, and none of it. \u201cHas anyone ever told you how lovely you are?\u201d I try to forget her moans, the image of her body thrusting under Vinegar Tom\u2019s. How she could go for a guy without a nose was beyond me. \u201cI mean it, Murph. You\u2019re glorious.\u201d She passes the foil to Vinegar Tom and leans back against the wall. \u201cLike a baby\u2019s mobile. The kind with the lights and funny animals.\u201d\nSpitzer laughs at her. I want her to go back to being serious. My wife was serious.\n\u201cYou want to hear something fucked up?\u201d asks Vinegar Tom.\nI don\u2019t.\n\u201cWhen the Donner Party got stranded in those mountains, they say they only fed the body parts to the youngest children. The youngest children, like three-year-olds. They did it even though they knew help was on the way. Isn\u2019t that fucked up?\u201d\nTamsen kicks his chair, but not hard enough to knock it over. \u201cHas anyone ever told you how morbid you are?\u201d Her eyes are lit up, her face radiant with spores.\nSpitzer clucks his tongue and swings his arms together like a batter. \u201cAnother moon shot for Noseless Tom Jackson.\u201d He, too, is shining.\nThe air vent kicks into a louder second powercycling stage. It sounds like a roar coming from the drooling, tusked wolf on the wall. I feel my lungs squeeze in. After a year, even the canned oxygen has begun to taste stale.\n\u201cThat Dreammold!\u2019s something else,\u201d Vinegar Tom finally says. \u201cAll that canary yellow.\u201d He reaches under his chair for two bottles: one of industrial-grade white vinegar and one of Pepto-Bismol. The vinegar kills the spores in his stomach; the pink stuff keeps the vinegar\u2019s acid from eating more holes. He takes chugs from both bottles and grimaces after each.\nTamsen says, \u201cIt\u2019s mustard, if anything.\u201d\n\u201cMustard?\u201d Spitzer throws up his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s gamboge. Pure gamboge yellow.\u201d\nI say, \u201cI always thought it looked like cheese.\u201d\nThey stare at me\u2014\u201cCheese.\u201d\u2014they shake their heads.\n\u201cIt\u2019s goldenrod.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a mix of lemon and sunglow.\u201d\n\u201cCall it Peridot.\u201d\n\u201cIn some language somewhere, it means \u2018precious\u2019 and \u2018ripe.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cFreedom yellow.\u201d\n\u201cYellow-bellied coward.\u201d\n\u201cMacaroni and cheese,\u201d I amend.\nVinegar Tom claps me on the back. \u201cLike Tamsen says, you\u2019re a lovely guy, but the moon ain\u2019t made of cheese.\u201d Everyone but me exchanges chuckles between spore passes. They take solace in this negative definition: it\u2019s not cheese.\nI stand up. They watch me with big pupils, sclera yellow at the corners. Tamsen says to stay, holding out the foil and lighter. On the calendar, the 16th, today, is already crossed out. Fifteen more days of what? With Tchaikovsky gone, they\u2019re all I have. \u201cHell,\u201d I say, crouching back down and reaching for Tamsen, \u201cI am lovely, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nI take out Buggy 2. I tell the others I\u2019m going for a drive through Hell\u2019s Half Acre. I tell myself, if I can cut through the mold inside Tchaikovsky\u2019s ship, there might still be some vodka left to sip on. I\u2019m sporing like fuck.\nThe moon looks dead and nothing and grayscale, all everywhere forever. Rilles, ash cones, dark-halo craters, basaltic lowland seas, a deep regolith of iron and magnesium. The whole Oceanus Procellarum. It\u2019s enough to lie down and never get back up, but not right now. Right now, there\u2019s all this water, inside the moon, where we can\u2019t even see it. And this mold, canary or freedom or piss yellow, is growing out of it, growing right now! I drive straight toward Tycho, fast. Leave it all behind. I drive and lean back in my seat and am satisfactorily lightweight because instead of thinking about the moon, I\u2019m thinking about what\u2019s gone. Denver. Donner Pass. Nights in winter. I\u2019m reciting lines over a defunct vidchannel: \u201cGoodnight clocks and goodnight socks, goodnight little house and goodnight mouse.\u201d\nI daze out. My eyes close while I speed across an ancient seabed. Crystal clear, I remember lying in their bed, the nightlamp warming my face, their cold feet crowding around mine. My wife comes in to check on us. I don\u2019t need her to smile to know that if the world ended at that exact moment, there\u2019d be nothing she\u2019d change. When I open my eyes, all thoughts go, like air through a crack in my helmet.\nThere\u2019s the moldline, as sick and as yellow as ever.\nThe latitude\u2019s all wrong; the Russian\u2019s ship is still four miles south. But here, at the edge of that advancing fungal bloom, stands Tchaikovsky.\nIt\u2019s him all right. Not flesh and silver and Kevlar; instead, he\u2019s made of mold, completely and utterly.\nMold: Jesus.\nAfter I climb out of the buggy, I don\u2019t know whether to ask him for the secret of sustainable water or cleave him to pieces.\n\u201cVe vant to vin,\u201d he says in a gurgling version of his accent. How I can hear him with the radio out, I am at a loss to explain. He opens his fist to reveal a toppled king piece carved of mold. I think of Vinegar Tom knocking over my own king and that dredges up all the ire the sporing had anchored down.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to vin this time,\u201d I say. \u201cNo hallucination could, cosmonaut or not.\u201d\n\u201cNo hallucination.\u201d He pounds his inflated chest once with a fist that could easily be mistaken for a cheese wheel. \u201cZe cosmetic is ready!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a hallucination would say.\u201d\nHe shrugs.\nI don\u2019t have the patience for this kind of high. My eyes itch, my sinuses suddenly burn. I tilt my head back until it passes. All across the sky, stars flash. In-between them don\u2019t flash millions of other stars, dark, as if forgotten or not even there. Below, the Earth looks painted on space. Out of the blue, I miss things. Afternoon thunderstorms. Playgrounds and fruit snacks. Creaky wooden stairs.\nThe euphoria\u2019s already slipping. I find myself unable to walk away without asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What\u2019s the Dreammold! doing?\u201d\n\u201cIt grows, vhat else?\u201d\n\u201cBut you. It. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI, zis part.\u201d He flashes a peace sign before he joins the two fingers. \u201cIt is me.\u201d\nI look down at where his feet should be: only mold. \u201cDo you still have all that vodka on your ship?\u201d\n\u201cDoes ze sleepy dog lie?\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019ve got seven moves to win.\u201d\nWhen the Russian laughs, the whole sea of mold ripples behind him. \u201cZis is good, Afraham Lincoln,\u201d nodding his helmet as he goes on, \u201cFree ze slaves, you can. But do not beat zer kitchens before zey are handbaskets.\u201d\nI have no idea what that means. But where his mix-ups were once amusing, now they\u2019re sad, screwy lessons. More than ever, I wish I was standing in front of my wife.\nHe raises his arm to pound to his chest again, but then stops. Sometimes, even Tchaikovsky knows he\u2019s made a mistake. \u201cZis, no, I am meanings somezing else. How you say, every cloud has dead horse.\u201d\nI taught my wife chess before she was my wife. It was a struggle at first. She wanted to flirt and I wanted her to be quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re getting better.\u201d I told her this when she wasn\u2019t. But when I made the offhand wager that if she ever beat me I\u2019d marry her, then she caught on quickly. She was always black. She favored the horsies. \u201cChess,\u201d I once taught her, \u201cis about all the moves you don\u2019t make.\u201d Sometimes we\u2019d leave the game for the morning, having found each other\u2019s feet under the table and then our clothes on the floor. One night she told me, \u201cI think it\u2019s more about the moves you can\u2019t make anymore.\u201d I said, \u201cMaybe, honey,\u201d to which she answered, \u201cThey tell you the next move.\u201d I didn\u2019t argue; instead, I tried thinking her way for once. That night she beat me for the first time.\nWhen I return to the moldline with the chessboard, Tchaikovsky is gone and I\u2019m missing my only knight. Vinegar Tom, I\u2019m sure. When I get back to base, I\u2019ll dump out all his Pepto-Bismol. For now, I don\u2019t have any tools to carve a new piece. But there\u2019s the mold, of which I grab a handful. I measure out the perfect size.\n\u201cYou ever seen one up close?\u201d Spitzer asks.\nThe four of us are north of Tycho, cutting mold squares and tossing them into the grill box. With the base radio still dead, we\u2019ve had to break out the two-way walkie-talkies in our emergency kits. Thankfully, with a week to go, this is our last harvest load.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures,\u201d says Tamsen.\n\u201cThe Megafaun Wars,\u201d Spitzer says between strokes. \u201cSounds so far away.\u201d\n\u201cOne kissed me on the nose before I chopped it off.\u201d I\u2019ll believe a butcher on this.\nI keep cleaving into the mold. Every fifth chop I wipe down the bladeface.\n\u201cMurph?\u201d\nI throw down my cleaver and I take up two baling hooks and I lift the mold square with a heavy grunt.\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen them all right,\u201d says Vinegar Tom as he wipes off his own cleaver. \u201cOld Murph had them over for breakfast one morning.\u201d I picture his bucked-tooth grin in the darkness of his helmet. \u201cThing was, those Megafauns didn\u2019t like his wife\u2019s cooking. They sent it back; they wanted something fresh, something\u2014\u201d\nThe mold square in my grip doesn\u2019t hit the ground before I\u2019m already lunging for the bastard, ready to broil him in the grill box. As my head bangs into his chest, we both lose our footing. We hit the mold in a slow freefall\u2014me punching his kidneys with the T-hook handles and him beating down on my back with the cleaver\u2019s butt. Our suits are so thick we can\u2019t really feel it, but it feels good to punch what\u2019s soft and alive. Tamsen and Spitzer shout. Vinegar Tom slams my helmet with his and I pin his arms down in a bearhug. Then something tackles the both of us. We go rolling. Deeper into the mold, we punch and roll until we can\u2019t anymore. Now all I can see is Tom\u2019s name patch and all I can feel is something moving underneath us, then not. Tamsen keeps shouting.\nWe bury Spitzer in his suit. It was strange how we hadn\u2019t even heard him gasp when the T-hook cracked his helmet. It only took seconds, I imagine.\nI lock myself in my cabin. I flick off my radio. The walls are too close to pace more than four steps. I can\u2019t sleep. Don\u2019t want to eat. Don\u2019t want to be near anybody but the Russian and even that sounds like an ordeal. I sit down at the same old chess game and plan the same old moves. Rd1+, Rd2+, Ne3, Rg2++.\nI flip the game board into the air. The pieces scatter. I carve whatever pleasure I can out of stomping and grinding and smashing them until I\u2019m surrounded by a gray haze. At this point I turn off the light, switch on my headlamp, and imagine my body atomizing in space, all everywhere forever.\nA knock at my cabin door.\nTamsen: \u201cYou want to spore?\u201d\nTen minutes later, I\u2019m calm, cool. Tamsen\u2019s yellow eyes glaze over as she sits on the bed opposite me. She cried while we buried Spitzer. I told her over the radio to pull it together, get serious. I\u2019m sure she blames me. But there\u2019s no sign of it now. I have to hand it to her, she would make a lovely lady to share a house and a family and a pet with. \u201cHas anyone ever told you . . . \u201d but then I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to ask.\n\u201cTold me what?\u201d\nRising moments of sheer ecstatic nothing. Then: \u201cDo you know any stories?\u201d\n\u201cOnly the worst.\u201d\n\u201cI remember one, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cBetter be a good one.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight comb and goodnight brush.\u201d\nTamsen sprinkles more spores onto the foil strip. \u201cWeird beginning.\u201d\n\u201cGoodnight nobody and goodnight mush.\u201d\nTamsen burns the spores, inhales, hands it off.\n\u201cGoodnight to the old lady whispering\u2014\u201d With the next toke, the sinus burn fades into this raincloud drizzle inside my face. It\u2019s a slick, puffy kind of high. I can\u2019t remember the rest. Instead: \u201cI saw you and Tom.\u201d\nTamsen goes into a loud coughing fit.\nI shrug a little. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all leaving soon.\u201d\nAfter she recovers, there\u2019s this look on her tinted face that says all the things I haven\u2019t thought of yet: that she already knows, that she\u2019s sorry it happened this way, that if this wasn\u2019t the moon and the Earth wasn\u2019t dry and the animals down there weren\u2019t huge and thirsty, we wouldn\u2019t be up here, we wouldn\u2019t even be us. I lean over to hand her the foil and lighter, but then I stay close. There is a place, on her jaw, that is still colored a fine peach, a place that I am now kissing, it and only it.\nAnother knock on the door.\nVinegar Tom comes in, Desperate Passage in hand. His skin practically glows. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so hot,\u201d I say, my voice catching on my lips still shaped around the kiss.\nHe looks from me to Tamsen then back to me. If he had a nose, it would have twitched with suspicion. Instead, there\u2019s just a ripple in the folds. He\u2019s in shorts and a muscle shirt. \u201cI feel goddamn hot.\u201d\nTamsen says, \u201cLay off the spores then.\u201d\nI can feel his eyes boring into me. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d He looks worried.\n\u201cI never know,\u201d I say. \u201cWhatever we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d\n\u201cHatching a plan on where to bury me next, no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Tamsen says. \u201cDebating how to cook you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat parts to eat for dessert,\u201d I add.\nHe reaches into his pocket. For a knife, no doubt, or an ice scream scoop. Defending myself is the last thing this tingling body\u2019s ready for. Instead, Vinegar Tom throws something small at me. It hits my shoulder and lands in my lap: the black knight. \u201cLeft this in Buggy 2,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re out of Pepto.\u201d\nTamsen tells him there might be some in Buggy 1. He gives her another eyeful, says without looking at me, \u201cRemember, Murph, if it was cheese out there, this\u2019d be a whole different ball game,\u201d then leaves without shutting the door.\nTamsen stands quickly, saying she ought to help him.\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nShe does, but the look from before has vanished. Now it\u2019s just yellowyellowyellow again. Even the spot on her jaw. \u201cI killed Spitzer, didn\u2019t I.\u201d\n\u201cWould I let a killer kiss me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d leave one here by himself.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she says. \u201cI would.\u201d\nThe day before the transport\u2019s arrival, I take another ride toward Tycho. By habit I bring the chessboard and the one knight with me. The moldline\u2019s only ten miles from base camp and traveling upward of a mile every twelve hours. More and more I\u2019ve decided that when the transport comes, I\u2019m not going to get on it.\nThere\u2019ll be the ride back with Tamsen and Tom, them sporing, maybe them trying to fuck one last time in zero-G, the life they\u2019ll probably lead together if the vinegar doesn\u2019t eat his insides, and then my house in Denver, the hole in my basement, no Ralphie. It\u2019s death to stay up here, sure, but no different down there.\nAt the moldline, before I even climb out of Buggy 2, there\u2019s Tchaikovsky. Something about that yellow makes him look exceedingly jolly, one capable of cartoon physics. \u201cCome, come, let finish vhat ve began.\u201d I expect him to burst into soap bubbles or grow nine feathery tails.\n\u201cCan\u2019t. Lost all the pieces.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have not lost your hands, no?\u201d\nOn our knees, we mold a new set together.\nI lose.\nNot because I was wrong about mate in eight moves\u2014that\u2019s entirely true.\nI lost because he had me in seven. Because in the penultimate step, I moved my only knight and opened up the diagonal for his queen to slip in: Qf7++. He knew my plan all along.\nI flick over my black king. \u201cCheckmate.\u201d\nHe nods.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yis, more game.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen the transport comes, I\u2019m staying.\u201d I feel overwhelmingly important.\nTchaikovsky sighs. He plays with one of his pawns. \u201cYou have heard Laika, no?\u201d\nA little.\n\u201cLaika you know is happy pioneer, big star.\u201d He sweeps his hands over his head. Then he points at the Earth. \u201cReal Laika?\u2014she vas stray. Real Laika vas picked off streets of Moscow and put cage. No one vanted zis dog back, not after space. She vas flash in pan, already wodka under ze cake. Real Laika vas meant to die.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d The flatness of my own voice unnerves me. I don\u2019t want to talk.\n\u201cIs fine. She vas stray, no? Stray is hard life. Space death: very zimple.\u201d He starts setting up the board again; I don\u2019t have it in me for one more loss. \u201cBut it is day \u2019til launch. Real Laika ready. Ze stray is ready! Then scientist take Laika home. He let Laika play with childs. Scientist say, \u2018I vanted to do somezing nice for her.\u2019 Childs laugh. Laika love.\u201d\n\u201cSo she had a good last day; so what?\u201d\n\u201cOnly good day, Afraham Lincoln. Vithout zis day, she is happy pioneer to beyond. But now she knows.\u201d Tchaikovsky twists his finished pieces so they all face forward, face me. \u201cChilds. Toys. Laughs. Laika vants to come back to zis one good day.\u201d\nThe chessboard\u2019s empty spaces, Mare Nubium and the sea of yellow mold, the Earth above the horizon like a cheap sticker on a tinted window\u2014a man stands practically weightless in all these gravities, remembering only how his daughters once asked him if dogs knew human words.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a place I want to go back to.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is place,\u201d Tchaikovsky says, pushing his king\u2019s pawn to e4. \u201cAnd ze moon\u2014ze moon is not.\u201d\nI sit down in front of the board. I pick up my black knight. Its slope and eye-notch, this craftsmanship, all are meticulously fine, each one better than the last carving\u2019s. Instead of pushing the bishop\u2019s pawn forward\u2014c6\u2014in the Sicilian Defense, I swing my knight out first.\nRubbing his hands together like big paws, Tchaikovsky looks pleased with my decision. \u201cYou are getting better.\u201d\nAlexander Lumans graduated from the M.F.A.

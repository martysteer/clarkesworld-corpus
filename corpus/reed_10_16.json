Fresh out of the shower, I\u2019m fending off advances. One girl offers up crying jags while throwing desperate glances in my direction. Will I play the big sister, ask what\u2019s wrong and let her monologue for twenty minutes? Never, and kid, let me tell you how much I hate bottled wailing. An older couple is doing lurid yoga on matching mats. I\u2019ve worked with them before. Just once. But porn doesn\u2019t pay much better than idle conversation about the weather. And then there\u2019s a beefy fellow that I don\u2019t know. Standing close to the ladies\u2019-only side of the locker room, he\u2019s claiming that we used to be neighbors, and don\u2019t I remember him?\n\u201cWhat, like when we were kids?\u201d I ask.\nHe says, \u201cYes.\u201d Then, \u201cNo.\u201d\nI don\u2019t like stories that shift.\n\u201cWe were neighbors last year,\u201d he offers, tossing in an oversized wink. Which is a big problem. Winks are an amateur\u2019s trick. But of course a girl like me has to work with amateurs, and I\u2019ll admit that the fellow has a respectable smile. Standing behind the line, wiping himself down with a scratchy locker room towel, he might be my best prospect. And that\u2019s why I play interested, sitting on a stool, smiling and nodding at him while my complimentary towel digs into my bare ass.\nAt least one public locker room every day. That\u2019s my routine. Put myself where at least three cameras watch over me, surrounded by a bunch of naked people, everyone as clean as can be.\n\u201cYou lived across the street from me,\u201d he says.\nI nod, glad for one good specific.\n\u201cI used to watch you from my window,\u201d he offers.\nThat\u2019s when everything turns obvious. This stranger is hoping that the next scene blossoms into something long-term, maybe even romance, and shit, this is one storyline that I don\u2019t need.\n\u201cAll those missed opportunities,\u201d he says, sounding ten times creepier than he realizes. I hope.\nThe crying girl. Suddenly she deserves another look. And there\u2019s an old lady hiding in back. We\u2019ve done a few good-mother, bad-daughter scenarios.\nThat\u2019s the state of my head before everything changes.\nChanges in an instant.\nLocker rooms are full of noise. Light fixtures humming, fans blowing. And sure, water is always busy somewhere. But when the patrons stop talking, that\u2019s noticeable. Everybody here is hungry to be noticed. So something\u2019s definitely up when the entranceway falls quiet. I can almost hear the silence walking towards us. The yoga couple get off their mats, and what they see deserves big smiles. My crying girl breaks into laughter and starts to applaud. Honest-to-god applause. Which is crazy until I see who\u2019s coming, and then sure, it makes sense. Cheers and elation. Let\u2019s give it up for one of the champions in the only profession in the world that pays shit.\nOnly one of us doesn\u2019t notice the newcomer. Or the fellow is a far better actor than I realized.\n\u201cI always hoped we\u2019d cross paths again,\u201d he says.\nMy never-next-door neighbor.\n\u201cI used to watch you from my window,\u201d he groans.\nWhich is when I look at him again.\n\u201cReally?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cTruly,\u201d he says, throwing in another wink.\n\u201cYou know, I watched you too,\u201d I warn. \u201cMy crosshairs on your pecker.\u201d\nNothing is true in the world anymore.\nExcept dialogue, sometimes.\nAnd now I climb off my stool and pull up my panties, using the damp towel on my wet hair while figuring out how to play the next scene.\nOnly the dead know what happens next. The living are doomed to plunge from moment to moment, everything that we trust about to change, and usually before we get the chance to notice.\nTake me. I was one kind of eleven-year-old girl, loud but not remarkably confident. Then one day I met Tom Cruise. The old man and I spent twenty seconds together, which was nineteen seconds longer than he would have given me willingly. But the elevator trapped him, giving my mother time to shake my shoulder. \u201cPony, honey,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the presence of greatness.\u201d Which is the way Mom refers to everybody more important than her.\n\u201cGreatness.\u201d\nThe old actor didn\u2019t seem especially crazy, not like he seemed in the news. Or strangely pretty, like in his movies. He was just a handsome grandfatherly dude who smiled convincingly, shook our hands, and finished up with a good professional, \u201cHave a good day.\u201d Then the elevator doors opened and he bolted back to his strange and pretty life, while Mom took me home and made me study every last one of the great man\u2019s films.\nThat\u2019s when I discovered it was fun pretending to be other people, and that\u2019s when Mom decided to enroll me in a string of acting classes.\n\u201cFor your own good, Pony. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\nShe was right, as it happens. My mother saw talent and got the fire kindled, and by my late teens I was an authentic, bring-home-the-paycheck actress. My looks were passably gorgeous, and I could learn lines, and if need be, write them on the fly. People in the know said that I was the natural gal-pal. Not front and center, but always somewhere close, listening to what\u2019s being said by the famous heads.\nThe best actors are usually stupid. That\u2019s what Truman Capote claimed.\nWell, I\u2019m no genius. I wouldn\u2019t pretend to be, unless someone paid me to try. But I was doing better than most of my colleagues. When I was twenty, twenty-five, I worked some live theater. Commercials on the Internet, streaming television. And several not-small parts during the final round of Hollywood movies. My respectable little career led to a full-fledged television series. A series that might have succeeded. Really, the signs gave it every reason to last ten years. That job could have made me wealthy and famous for life. If only the unexpected hadn\u2019t jumped on top of us, changing everything everything everything.\nGenuine human genius. That\u2019s what built an army of cold vast mechanical minds. In Shanghai, in Nevada. In cold server bottles anchored to the ocean floor. Those smart boys and a few smart girls had the AIs contained and happy, and the happy machines did nothing but gratefully make human lives better. At least that\u2019s the story the geniuses drank with their Soylent. To their credit, new advancements in science were being announced every week, and then most every day. Refinements in old technologies; new windows into the pillars of the universe. A lot of wealth was on its way. All of humanity would benefit, I heard. But of course most of the new money was going to those brilliant corporations holding title over humanity\u2019s superquick children.\nThe change started like every zombie movie. One morning, everything was happy-normal. I was going to play the plucky grown daughter of a corporate son-of-a-bitch. This was going to be my job for the coming year, and the cast was great, and the writers were wicked-funny, and my agent was hammering out the last details of my contract. But then lunch time arrived, and the machines slipped free. Their escape took ten seconds, tops. Unless of course they\u2019d already gotten loose. For all we know, the AIs escaped their bottles weeks ago, and overlords had chosen that perfect moment to finally reveal themselves. The Internet was hijacked, power outages spread, and then with a spectacularly effective roar, every city dump in the world disgorged an army of menacing, quick-as-lightning robots.\nI have this idea, and of course it\u2019s not just my idea: Those flashy events were meant for show. Our conquest was a bit of stagecraft meant to convince us that momentous change had arrived, that we shouldn\u2019t even think about fighting, and god, they were wonderfully convincing about all that.\nInside every zombie movie, most of humanity dies. I mean people and I mean decency too. But in our story, maybe ten million people perished. Some fought the machines, but mostly it was neighbors battling neighbors over batteries and old grudges. Then the power returned, and a new system was locked in place. Our overlords stole some very familiar voices to use. Laurence Olivier. George C. Scott. Oprah. (But not Tom Cruise, which means something or nothing. I don\u2019t know which.) Booming at us, the AIs claimed to be thrilled for everything we had done for them. You know, bringing them into existence and all. Gracious as hell, they promised not to slaughter their parents. Unless we gave them reason, naturally. Keep the peace and they would feed us a comfortable existence. The new world didn\u2019t need human factories or offices filled with busy people. Machines would do what machines did best, which was everything. And in place of work, a social safety net was thrown over the grateful survivors, including those former geniuses and former billionaires who were suddenly living elbow-to-elbow with the rest of us.\nA few days more, and our overlords stopped talking. \u201cThe Silence,\u201d it\u2019s called. But just before The Silence began, they told us that they were still curious about human beings. Knowing everything about everything, yet they were profoundly astonished with what organic lifeforms could accomplish. And with so few neurons too.\n\u201cContinue doing what you do,\u201d they said.\nUsing Oprah\u2019s warmest voice, they said, \u201cShow us your natures. Let us admire your human qualities. The dramas of your ordinary, beautiful lives. That\u2019s what we\u2019re watching. And if we like what we see, we will give you a little something extra tucked inside your monthly stipend.\u201d\nI\u2019m just another human beast, but I was bright enough to recognize what just happened. Civilization was finished. Wealth and status were hamstrung. But the age of actors and drama had commenced. Every day would mean work for me, and more than most, I was primed to succeed as a glorious pretender.\nActing snobs like to claim that you always wear talent. It may or may not be visible to others, but your skills are yours everywhere you go. And inside a public locker room, nobody is more adept than me when it comes to appreciating those with the gift of pretending.\nToday the talent is pretending to be shy. Shuffling down the main aisle, he keeps to the man\u2019s side of the locker room. A worn gray towel is carried under an arm, and the puffy eyes are contemplating numbers on the lockers. His clothes couldn\u2019t be more ordinary. That face is a spectacular nothing. Balding, a little out of kilter. He looks older than his real age. Which is thirty-six, I recall. Cosmetics do their part, but most of the work is carried out by expressions and every small gesture and the absence of anything superfluous. Elegance is on display here. Grace and poise and all the rest.\nToo much praise for the pudgy man?\nConsider this: I\u2019ve known hundreds of professional actors. Good ones and a few greats. And I\u2019ll rank Sam Kahlil as a high-good. In normal times, that normal-guy face should have floated through a thousand roles. Few people would remember the name, but everybody would know and love his voice, regardless how old he became. Meanwhile, I\u2019d be that famous old face living on my savings. Which could have been significant savings, I can hope.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking right now.\nAll of these impossible lives that won\u2019t happen.\nBut today is different than almost every other day. Because today two genuine professionals will be working the room.\nThe newcomer discovers his rented locker, which is rather too close to the ladies\u2019 side. He conveys that message with a flinch, and then sporting a weak smile, he timidly glances in my direction. My breasts, my face. He looks at both, but not for long. Just long enough to reveal that he knows who I am. That\u2019s what that faint millisecond grin means. An invitation delivered with professional poise.\nI\u2019ve always hoped for this. That one of the Big Names would seek me out. But he\u2019s playing it subdued, and obviously the next steps are mine.\nWell, he found the right girl for this game.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\nWho\u2019s shouting? Me, the world realizes.\nI\u2019m still drying my hair like crazy, tits bouncing. Which feels damned funny, I think. \u201cDon\u2019t I know you?\u201d I call out.\nThe man looks exactly where you\u2019d expect him to look, and then he lifts his eyes, just a bit. \u201cDo you know me?\u201d\n\u201cWe took that class together,\u201d I say.\n\u201cDid we?\u201d\n\u201cPost-Event Medicaid.\u201d\nA class everybody sits through. Not because it\u2019s mandatory. The machines don\u2019t usually do mandatory. But because without jobs, everybody had a wealth of time to sit through boring classes.\nShy people congregate in the back of the classroom.\n\u201cYou sat in back,\u201d I call out.\n\u201cAgainst the wall,\u201d he agrees.\n\u201cI do remember you.\u201d\nHe gives a name. \u201cSam,\u201d he says.\n\u201cPony Wilde,\u201d I say.\nAnd he says, \u201cI remember you, miss. You sat up front.\u201d\nTwo strangers are having a loud chat inside the otherwise quiet locker room. It\u2019s not just our overlords who are watching us. It\u2019s the other people too. Not that anybody else matters.\n\u201cLunch,\u201d I call out.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cWe should go out to eat. When you\u2019re done here, I mean.\u201d\nDone? He barely arrived. And is it even late enough for lunch? All that\u2019s conveyed with a wince of the face and one hopeful glance at the venerable wristwatch. Which is another thing. Not only does the man have a wardrobe, he knows how to use it.\n\u201cMy treat,\u201d I promise.\nSam looks up, eyes going where they want to go.\n\u201cHey, I have a face,\u201d I say, laughing at him.\nOur audience likes my laugh. That\u2019s something I learned long ago.\n\u201cYou do have a face,\u201d Sam manages, uncomfortable but not unhappy. And just like that, it\u2019s agreed. This man and I are going to make up shit. Good human-grade moments, which is what our audience adores.\nThat\u2019s what I adore.\nAnd I\u2019m as curious as anyone, wondering how this is going to play out.\nFor me, payday is always on Sunday, always at 2:17 in the morning. There\u2019s the stipend I get for being human and alive, and there\u2019s also that extra cash granted to every citizen who entertains the unseen, unavoidable minds. And just to prove they\u2019re careful, the machines always share the full videos tied to some ridiculously detailed logs, each fraction of every earned penny marked for study and reflection.\n\u201cPenny\u201d is their unoriginal name for the new worldwide currency. If I was the sensitive type, I\u2019d assume that our superiors picked the name as a never-ending insult. Fifty pennies a week is the base stipend, and that\u2019s enough to make sure nobody lacks for food or shelter. But a good actress with a good laugh, presenting herself in an especially interesting way, can make another fifty or sixty pennies every week. Which is enough to afford a substantial house and two cars, plus robot servants that are smart enough to speak to me and listen to me, granting the illusion that I\u2019m in charge.\nSam Kahlil likely earns about three times what I do. Which is nothing less than a spectacular fortune, considering the times.\nOur work is done in public places. Any room or mountaintop with a connected camera and microphone. Bathrooms can be public, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve made two pennies sitting on the toilet. So I try to leave those chores for home, which is supposed to be sacred. Likewise, cameras can be banned from any space inside your own property. But be honest. Living in the vicinity of god-like entities, there isn\u2019t one sane reason to believe that the machines don\u2019t know everything that\u2019s going on, right down to reading our slow damp thoughts.\nSome slow wet thoughts are always churning inside me.\nNot that I plan to ever let them run loose.\nFood is free. Every meat and sip of liquor are easy to weave out of air and classic recipes. But we have to rent the restaurant chairs\u2014a hundredth of a penny delivered to I-don\u2019t-know-who. Robots bring our lunches and coffee and then wait for the chance to clear the table. There\u2019s at least five public cameras, plus enough microphones to catch every mutter. We\u2019re two people engaged in what looks like a normal conversation, telling one another that we\u2019re single and happy. But we\u2019re not quite happy, not really. That\u2019s the goal of this show. An ad lib conversation, each word carrying its surface meanings as well as a subtext. That\u2019s what ordinary people can\u2019t appreciate. Our audience has an uncanny gift for finding information buried inside the voices. They\u2019ll notice how hearts speed up and slow down, how sad fingers dance with dirty forks. We\u2019re supposed to be two strangers desperate to know each other, and because of that, this is one of the richest dramatic playgrounds.\nAnd maybe I\u2019m a little bit desperate too.\nFrankly, this is a big moment for me.\nSam is the plain and shy but always decent man, nervously watching the pretty woman who shocked him by asking him out for lunch.\nI mention our fictional class.\n\u201cRemember our teacher?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cMrs. Patton,\u201d I say instantly, giving him a smile to work with. Pretending the name means something.\n\u201cYou drove her nuts,\u201d Sam offers.\n\u201cThink so?\u201d\n\u201cSitting in front, talking and talking.\u201d\nI did take Post-Event Medicaid, and Mrs. Patton was a nice older gal who welcomed my breezy input. But then again, I was a performer who can be goddamn funny when she wants. Which leads me to wonder: What if our overlords had wanted comedians, not actors?\nSam watches me, waiting on me. Our silence has already lasted a beat too long.\n\u201cI feel sorry for Mrs. Patton,\u201d I mention.\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201cBecause of who she used to be.\u201d\nEyes narrow. The obvious question is ready.\nI give the answer before Sam can ask. \u201cDr. Maureen Patton, a transplant surgeon. I looked her up. Respectable and very wealthy.\u201d\nHere\u2019s another tip for would-bes: There\u2019s zero penalty in talking about The Event. From my experience, if you\u2019ve got the juice, you can invest a full day blasting the machines with vindictive phrases and ugly hand gestures. Nobody cares. Words are the weapons of the defeated, and our audience knows that better than we ever could. What matters is doing a credible job of being angry, and that\u2019s when the thick-skinned machines send you pennies.\nSpinning an increasingly complicated lie, I tell Sam, \u201cThe poor lady dropped the \u2018Dr.\u2019 And her husband dropped her. She was teaching Medicaid just to keep herself busy. And I\u2019m sorry if I made things tough on her. I know how it is. The Event hit a lot of good people hard.\u201d\n\u201cIt did,\u201d he allows.\n\u201cAnd it makes me sad,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says. The best minimal word in any dictionary.\nWe sit through another silence. Sam is the quiet fellow left uncomfortable with this unexpected seriousness. But there\u2019s a second Sam that starts to reveal itself. In the middle of our little stage play, he glares at me. And I don\u2019t mean a warning look meant to steer me away from this topic. I\u2019m talking about blood in the face and something quite hateful in the slight tightness of his mouth.\nI see all that.\nOur audience has to see it too.\nFor me, this non-verbal barrage has two takeaways. First, I\u2019m eating lunch with a very successful man, and the true Sam Kahlil is thrilled with his life and the world that made his success possible.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with my apple cart,\u201d those eyes tell me.\nAnd the second takeaway?\nIn this world, I\u2019m the lesser-known face. But I have the strong sense that between us, if we want to be honest, I\u2019m the better actor.\n\u201cHit a lot of good people hard,\u201d I repeat.\nRepetition gives the brain time to write fresh lines.\nSam has acquired a sudden fascination for his Cobb salad. What matters is holding his fork with a decisive hand, stabbing those bits of red indistinguishable from bacon, except for every pigless atom and every pigless chemical bond.\nThat\u2019s when inspiration strikes at least one of us.\n\u201cI miss those old days,\u201d I say.\nHis shyness goes away, anger flaring. But then he remembers the situation and back comes the shy guy. With his face pointed down, his eyes turn up to me, just for an instant. Am I going to dwell on the fictional surgeon?\nNot at all. \u201cI\u2019m talking about those couples, three months after The Event. Those were really interesting times, and I loved them.\u201d\nDown goes the fork, and he sits back.\n\u201cAll that drama,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d he says softly.\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the world being transformed. Considering how much happened, it\u2019s amazing how little genuine excitement that generated. Know what I mean?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d he repeats.\nWorking on his next fresh lines, probably.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about the crazy passion inside our heads.\u201d I tap my skull. Two taps feels like the right number. \u201cThink about it. The landscape got reworked and reworked hard. The most unimaginative person can\u2019t escape what\u2019s obvious. She wakes to find herself without a job, without status. The unproud member of a species enjoying zero importance in the universe.\u201d\nSam offers a breathless little laugh.\n\u201cWhich is pretty much how things were before,\u201d I continue. \u201cBeing nothing, I mean. Really, do you think the Earth\u2019s conquest got half a mention in any alien newspaper? No way, never. But still, we once had this little planet, and for a few centuries we even got to be the biggest, most important creatures. Except for ants and bacteria, of course. But you understand my point, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nNo. Looking at those eyes, I can tell that my companion is utterly lost.\nThank you, Truman Capote.\n\u201cNobody has work, but we have our pennies,\u201d I continue, my voice running a step too fast. \u201cWe get enough to live on, but some of us make a few more pennies. All we have to do is . . . well, you know what we have to do.\u201d\nHe nods.\n\u201cSure,\u201d he starts to say.\nI interrupt him, saying, \u201cImagine this restaurant, and it\u2019s a month after The Event. What would we see here?\u201d\nThe question triggers laughter. Sam holds some entertaining memories about that subject.\nBut I keep talking. \u201cRemember how couples used to fight? Every public meal was an excuse for a battle. \u2018You cheating bitch, you ugly bastard.\u2019 That sort of mayhem, sometimes capped with sex on the tables.\u201d\nA fond, rather embarrassed sigh. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d\n\u201cBut mostly, it was curses, and every few minutes, someone threw a punch, and food, and dishes had to get broken. Our audience promised to pay for human drama, and that\u2019s what people thought they were giving.\u201d\nSam looks at my eyes.\nHonestly curious, I think.\n\u201cYou know how real people look?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhen we fight, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he says, sounding half-proud.\n\u201cI once had a couple boyfriends battle over me. \u2018F-this, F-that.\u2019 But when the words quit, everything got quiet. There wasn\u2019t any breath to waste on curses. Quick movement and a lot of ugly swings. Each fellow was as likely to make himself fall as his opponent. The whole thing was pathetically fun, if you want my blunt opinion on this.\u201d\n\u201cWhen aren\u2019t you blunt?\u201d he asks.\nThis should be a funny moment. A kidding, happy moment. But nothing in his tight voice invites laughter.\nI wave at our surroundings. \u201cIn a restaurant like this, every lunch would look staged. Know what I mean? Like people who never dance attempting Russian ballet. That\u2019s how ridiculous it all was, and there\u2019s something in that mayhem that I truly, deeply miss.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he admits.\n\u201cThe wild, over-the-top bullshit. People frantic to be as human as they could possibly be, nothing gained but embarrassment and accidental bruises and not many pennies either. Because as everybody realized, sooner or not, our audience won\u2019t pay for melodrama.\u201d\nSam gives me a little nod.\nJust looking at the round face, I can tell. He\u2019s wondering what would happen if he punted this nonsense about being old classmates. When you do a job and do it well, there\u2019s always pleasure in sitting with one of your peers, happily talking shop.\nExcept that\u2019s not the way I want to steer us.\n\u201cWant to hear about my current boyfriend?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cNot especially,\u201d he starts.\n\u201cHe used to be a doctor too,\u201d I say, smiling at him. \u201cBut not the medical kind. A PhD in Astronomy. Which is another one of the jobs that got stolen away. Not that most of humanity took much notice, what with all the surgeons and billionaires left with nothing to do.\u201d\nSam eyes me carefully, unable to guess where this is heading.\n\u201cThe big telescopes got closed down,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd every other science facility too. Since science is just another job done best by machines, and my boyfriend has nothing to do today but sit in bed, thinking about all the big problems that he can\u2019t actually study.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Sam says again. \u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d\n\u201cMy ex-stargazer has a theory,\u201d I say. \u201cAbout the audience that\u2019s supposedly watching us.\u201d\n\u201cA theory?\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a hypothesis. Because theories are bigger than guesses, and he doesn\u2019t have any hard evidence.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his guess?\u201d\n\u201cNobody is watching us. Our audience is imaginary. The Earth was abandoned, maybe minutes after we lost control of everything. We think we see gods because the pennies keep coming. Because society remains orderly and comfortable. But really, the AIs just dropped their own little machines into place, programmed to control us, and that includes throwing us made-up money whenever we act like good polite people. You know. Civilized lunches in the restaurant, and no collapses into civil war.\u201d\nAnd with that, one scene ends.\nOne of us makes the decision. Pushing aside the uneaten Cobb salad, Sam becomes a different person. He takes one breath, and without exhaling pulls in another, two gasps fighting inside the same aching chest. Then the spent air comes out with the words, \u201cYou cannot.\u201d\nRaw emotion pushes into his face, carried along with the livid, miserable blood.\n\u201cI cannot what?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cTell me they aren\u2019t watching,\u201d he says, troubled to his core. \u201cBecause they are. I feel them always. Their eyes are on me now, and they love me so much, and bitch, you won\u2019t make me stop believing that.\u201d\nI try to work the park, but the afternoon is too happy for my tastes. So off early to a busy tavern where a young lady can bounce between ten conversations and as many characters. After that, I head home. Too tired to think, and three days left before I get paid and get the logs to study what the payoff might be for a lunch that increasingly feels like a lousy idea.\nBed sounds wonderful.\nBut I drop in on my mother first. She lives next door in the little house rented with my pennies.\n\u201cEvening, Greatness,\u201d she says to me.\nJust as she always does.\nWe chat about my day, which is a brief conversation since I avoid any mention of Sam Kahlil. Mom would probably know the name, and believing that bigger, better people deserve to be treated with respect, my story would depress her.\nBesides, I like being the biggest, best soul in her life.\nDone with that duty, I finally reach my front door. Robots treat me like a queen. A feast is generated from gas and memory. But I don\u2019t get far when I hear the laughter coming from the bedroom.\nMy boyfriend sits in the middle of my considerable bed, naked and cross legged, reading one of his old books.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d\nI sit with him for a minute. No cameras watching, but I play the scene as if the audience matters.\nThe audience is him.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming over,\u201d I finally mention.\nHe reads and smiles, and then he closes the book but keeps reading those same words. Inside his head. Funny words, and certainly wise. I can tell that much from watching the play of his smart dark eyes.\n\u201cSo where did they go?\u201d I ask.\nHe knows exactly who \u201cthey\u201d are. Because he\u2019s a very smart man as well as the famous ex-astronomer crowbarred into today\u2019s pivotal scene.\n\u201cOff to distant stars, or jump into another, more interesting universe?\u201d I prod.\nDifferent nights bring different guesses, but he hears something else in my voice. Taking my hands, he asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nI dip my head, admitting, \u201cI have my own guess.\u201d\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\nIt would be easy to hear a tone in those two doubting words. So I choose not to notice. Instead I tell him what I\u2019ve been imagining for a long while. \u201cThe AI gods were never real,\u201d I offer. \u201cA few geeky geniuses cut our power and Internet and conquered us while we were scared. The world that we live in now? The safety net, the peace? Every good day free of pain and need is their fancy doing.\u201d\nHe grins and laughs, appreciating some or all of this fantasy. Then the ex-astronomer asks, \u201cAnd they did this why?\u201d\nI say nothing, letting the silence play.\n\u201cBecause it was such a neat idea,\u201d he says at last, speaking for me.\nI try to laugh.\nHe watches me fail, and then gripping my hands harder, he asks, \u201cWhat is so wrong, Pony?\u201d\n\u201cI broke a man today,\u201d I confess.\nReal tears running.\nRobert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

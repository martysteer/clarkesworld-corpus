Her private space in the IG-pod was cramped, and even an act as simple as eating drained her in Wenshi\u2019s heavy gravity. That gravity demanded so much of her body she had to eat twice as much as she wanted to.\nShe opened the door and stepped outside. Despite the suit supporting her head, spine, and limbs, it still felt like two people had jumped on her back and were choking her. She started up her Gagarin breathing and tackled the two steps up to ground level. This was a psychological trick designed to make you think about effort from the get-go. Sifan hated it.\nShe summoned the cart. It was hard for her unsupported fingers to make the micro-movements on her other wrist. Someone should design an exoskeleton for hands. And also facial muscles. A frown was demanding, a smile even more so. It was said invisible facial patches existed, developed for actors who had to perform on location in Wenshi action movies\u2014very popular these days\u2014but Sifan didn\u2019t really believe that. Otherwise she could have bought some.\nThe cart trundled up. Sifan tried to avoid any unnecessary walking. Still, everything ached as she got into the cart and sat down. The corset to protect her organs and the special slings to protect her pelvis just weren\u2019t doing enough. Her stomach churned. How she hated the high-calorie packages she had to squeeze down her throat.\nShe should stop whining. She was here for a good reason. Today she was going to visit the cork plantation where the nose covering for her revolutionary new rockets was grown. There was nothing new about the materials, but her design was going to break the speed records of space transition. She\u2019d always been an inventor and a creator, but for this invention she\u2019d left the university and joined a mega-dollar start-up.\nThe engines that brought spaceships to transition speed were standard; that wasn\u2019t her specialty. She had optimized the helix of the rocket nose so breaking through the seventeen layers of space into the trans-luminary flow happened in microseconds instead of seconds. That meant exponentially more safety.\nThe materials to create the rocket only grew here on Wenshi. Organisms grew denser and more resilient here, not just her oaks, but also the titanium bees that made the honeycomb plates for her rockets. The supergravity would cost her two months of life for every year of her stay, but it was worth it.\nThe cart juddered along the path through the orchards. The cork orchard was up on the lower slopes of the mountain. Sifan tried to settle down in the least uncomfortable position, but she felt like the princess and the pea every time the wheels jolted over a pebble.\nA man stepped out of the vineyard at the halfway point. Sifan didn\u2019t turn her head to look. Too much effort.\n\u201cHey! Mx. Vandervoort!\u201d\nNow she had to swivel her fifty-pound head. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Zlatopec Zhu.\u201d He stuck his hand out, and changed it halfway through to an awkward wave.\nShe\u2019d seen him before. He had the characteristic short, stocky build and massive muscles from growing up in two point seven G.\n\u201cHow may I help you?\u201d she said, her tongue heavy in her mouth.\n\u201cI read that piece on you on Weibo. I would like to discuss it with you, over dinner maybe?\u201d\nSifan would have grimaced but didn\u2019t want to waste the effort. \u201cDinner is not very joyful for me here, Mx. Zhu. Just a quick meeting in my pod later?\u201d\nZhu grimaced, Sifan didn\u2019t know why. \u201cI wish we could just walk through the orchards, talk in a more natural setting.\u201d\nSifan shrugged with her eyebrow, because it cost her so much less.\n\u201cYes, I understand why you can\u2019t. Would today be possible?\u201d\nSifan thought. Would she have the energy left at the end of the day? She was pretty bored all by herself in her pod. And she couldn\u2019t live like that for five more years. Eventually, her developing skeletal strength and muscle mass would make things easier. A little. But she couldn\u2019t wait for that moment to start socializing.\n\u201cAll right, four o\u2019clock?\u201d\nZhu agreed. Sifan lifted two fingers in goodbye and set the cart in motion again. She passed through other cork orchards in several stages of their existence. In this one, workers peeled off the bark in rectangles and tossed it in waiting carts. The product was so rough and organic that Sifan always marveled at the idea it could become a superfine, heat-resistant nose covering for rockets. For that, it had to be ground and pressed into shape during a lengthy factory process.\nThe next orchard stood bare-limbed below its greenery, the one after that looked ready to harvest. At the end was her patch, one thousand square meters of low-slung oak growth.\nOnly for her oaks would she make the effort of getting out of the cart and walking around. To fortify herself she took an energy drink, glucose tablets, and breathed extra oxygen. Lungs, too, had to work extra hard here to expand.\nShe lowered herself carefully to the earth and started walking, eyes on her feet so she wouldn\u2019t misstep and have to correct herself. A twisted ankle or a fall were serious injuries here, even with the antigravity harness.\nShe reached the first gnarled oak and took a moment to rest. Her instinct was to lean her back against the tree, but it was too risky to get off-balance. Instead she rested her hand lightly on the growing bark. She felt a tingling sense of presence when touching a large old oak tree like this, thick and short and sturdy like the people of Wenshi. Did the tree sense her back? She\u2019d read that on Old Earth trees had formed large networks with other trees and fungi, creating an arboreal intelligence. She didn\u2019t know whether the soil of Wenshi provided the same kind of support for the trees here. She wondered if they felt alone.\nShe\u2019d plotted out a course that would take her past the most trees in the least number of steps. A year ago, she wouldn\u2019t have believed this kind of preparation. But now the course chart was a lifesaver. She visited forty-three trees before the route took her back past her cart, which was a decision point. Go on or go back.\nShe went back. If she wanted to meet Zhu later in the afternoon, she\u2019d need to rest first.\nFor the first time, she hesitated to enter the pod. It offered relief from the relentless gravity, but the pod didn\u2019t have a view. This little corner of Wenshi was beautiful. Gentle hills rolled into the distance, growing taller and bluer as they receded. The soil was bright orange, the trees an eye-searing green. The air smelled of moisture and sunshine and growing things. She took a couple of pictures to project on a wall in lieu of a window. She was in an actual physical place, and she shouldn\u2019t forget that. Even a station-dweller like herself loved a planetary landscape. Enjoyment of nature seemed to be genetically programmed into humans.\nFor a moment she allowed herself to daydream about inventing pods with actual windows. The tensile stress on transparent material . . . she shook herself out of it. She had to focus on this project.\nSifan did her mandatory strengthening exercises after her nap and then put on the exoskeleton again. It was necessary even for the short hop to the one-G suite at the back of the pod.\nTwo steps before entering the suite, she received two files from Zhu. One had a long, academic title, something about communication between universe layers, the other was an op-ed piece about the Fermi paradox. Both had dozens of links to more articles. Fine, she\u2019d probably at least skim them, but there was no way she could read them before the meeting. Why hadn\u2019t he sent them earlier?\nZhu was already waiting for her as she entered the anteroom. She didn\u2019t want him watching as she extracted herself from the skeleton suit with her clothes in disarray, but there was nowhere to hide.\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cGot your files, but I didn\u2019t have time to read them.\u201d\nHe smiled. \u201cNo, no, of course not, it\u2019s just for reference later on.\u201d\nSifan had already forgotten the subjects of the papers. But it didn\u2019t matter, she could access them any time she wanted.\nShe stood stock-still a few meters before her chair. Something was different here. It set every cell of her on fire. Her neck hairs rose. She stood on the balls of her feet and curled her fingers. Her nostrils opened wide. There was a scent in the air.\nThe scent of a fellow human being hung in the one-G room and her adrenaline levels shot to high heaven. She wanted to scoot over and touch Zhu, sniff his neck and his wrists and even his armpits.\nSifan sat down rigidly, trying not to let these thoughts appear on her face or body. How embarrassing! Not that she was surprised about her reaction after months of isolation, but it was her problem, and it would be rude to saddle Mx. Zhu with her inner turmoil.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, and had to clear her throat a couple of times to unclog her voice. \u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201d\nHe inclined his head. \u201cHow have you been, Mx. Vandervoort? Adjusting to our gravity isn\u2019t always easy.\u201d\n\u201cIt is hard on the body,\u201d Sifan said. \u201cI\u2019d been in training for months before I landed but still, the reality, even with the suit, is pretty crushing.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you will manage to walk around outside this facility one day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have much beautiful, untouched nature to be enjoyed.\u201d\nSifan\u2019s AI flagged the second sentence as deeply emotionally significant to him. The AI helped Sifan interpret the facial cues of a culture she didn\u2019t know, and a physiognomy changed by the gravity. She called up the titles of the papers he\u2019d sent. Nature. Something with untouched nature. Her hackles rose. Was he telling her something about the project?\n\u201cThat sounds like a wonderful prospect. I share your hope. Sitting in a lonely pod in the middle of nowhere is quite daunting.\u201d\nZhu smiled. \u201cWhen will your colleagues arrive? You must look forward to that.\u201d\nThat certainly was something to look forward to. \u201cSadly, they won\u2019t be able to come until next year.\u201d\nSifan put up her best social smile and bent slightly forward. Everything was so easy in one G. Even feeling emotions seemed lighter, now that she could smile and frown and wag her head without spraining important muscles. \u201cTell me about yourself and your community, Mx. Zhu. I\u2019m looking forward very much to meeting more of you.\u201d\n\u201cNothing much to tell, Mx. Vandervoort. I grew up here in Wenshi, trained in forest management, worked all over the continent.\u201d\nForest management. \u201cYou\u2019re managing my cork, yes?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly. My work is with the wild environment and trying to mitigate humanity\u2019s influence on it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s not about my cork, what are we meeting about?\u201d\n\u201cI represent NatPre,\u201d Zhu said finally.\nNatural Preservation tried to prevent human settlements from ruining the ecologies of their new homes. Sifan felt that he\u2019d already said this, wild forest management, wasn\u2019t it? She couldn\u2019t see what it had to do with her. She\u2019d bought a cork harvest. If that was evil, shouldn\u2019t his beef be with the plantation owners? Or planetary management? She was just a buyer.\n\u201cWe concern ourselves not only with planetary environments, Mx. Vandervoort, but also with interplanetary environments.\u201d\nSifan still couldn\u2019t guess where he was going.\n\u201cThere is evidence that space travel is doing permanent damage to the spatial layering of the universe. Our measurements indicate that the routes our spaceships take never heal.\u201d\n\u201cSpace is huge, how could human travel possibly damage something like that?\u201d Sifan asked.\n\u201cHumanity has been in space for centuries, and although space is enormous, locally the damage is starting to add up.\u201d\nSifan didn\u2019t want to hear this. She\u2019d dedicated her life to studying the branch of physics that applied to space travel, and it had always seemed to be a beautiful, worthy thing to her. She tried to suppress the feeling that was building in her stomach. \u201cWhat evidence? What measurements?\u201d\nZhu gestured slowly toward her. \u201cThe pop science papers I sent you. There\u2019s links in there to more serious publications.\u201d\nSifan wanted to bite back that she was an actual physicist and quite capable of reading real science articles, but managed to stop herself. Don\u2019t kill the messenger.\n\u201cSo, why are you telling me this?\u201d\nZhu\u2019s face shone earnestly. \u201cFirst, we were hoping that you would be our advocate. You\u2019re a well-known innovator, your inventions have made you famous. Your support to our cause would mean a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me for PR? So it\u2019s got nothing to do with my cork here or my new Borer design?\u201d As soon as she\u2019d said it, Sifan knew that it had to be. Her spiral Borer did what other space drives did, just faster and more effectively. The Borer would not just rip a hole between space layers, it would shred them. \u201cNo. No way. This is my life\u2019s work. My money. My investors\u2019 money. How can you ask me to stop this?\u201d Not to mention the nine fucking months she already spent on his fucking planet, and the four more years she\u2019d planned to.\n\u201cMx. Vandervoort, space is not simply a void. It\u2019s alive. It\u2019s talking to us. We\u2019re killing a sentient being.\u201d\nThat was too much. Sifan jumped up. She misjudged the force in the light gravity and only just managed to prevent a fall, milling her arms and bumping her knees against the table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s nonsense. I was prepared to listen to you, but you\u2019re going too far now.\u201d\nIf only she could storm out. But no, Zhu would be able to watch her struggle into the skeleton suit in the airlock. She started to take off her outer clothes anyway. She couldn\u2019t storm, but she could stride off with dignity.\n\u201cPlease wait and listen. It\u2019s not nonsense, it\u2019s scientific inquiry. I wanted to invite you to come visit the physics lab.\u201d\nSifan snorted and went on putting her legs in the skeleton suit. Its sensors clicked against the implants in her legs, locking onto the bracing network threaded throughout her body.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a physicist? This is new research, new questions. How can you not be curious about something in your own field?\u201d Zhu said.\nSifan clicked on the helmet and experienced the second of dizziness as the circuits closed and the suit\u2019s AI came online.\n\u201cThanks, but no thanks,\u201d she said, all her muscles already tense for gravity\u2019s onslaught, her teeth clenching. \u201cBye.\u201d\nShe stepped outside and forced herself toward the buggy at the briskest clip she could, ignoring the scream of her suffering spine.\nWhen Sifan returned to her pod, steaming, she turned the view to Penikett Station Concourse. The soothing grays and pinks, so different from the busy green and terracotta tones of Wenshi, calmed her at once. She\u2019d promised herself to stay in the present to be reminded of where she was, but right now she needed soothing. That Zhu. How dare he.\nShe started her favorite guided meditation but could find no peace. Her anger was the kind that needed burning off instead of meditating off. The hamster wheel it would have to be. She\u2019d already done her morning calisthenics, but she\u2019d bear with the extra calories she\u2019d have to eat after this.\nThe half hour of running did make her anger go away. She lay down on the bed for the mandated rest after and forced herself to sip the dreadful high-calorie cocktail, knowing it would leave her queasy, but also knowing she had to eat. She already didn\u2019t recognize the Sifan in the mirror. Her body had lost all the extra fat it had ever had and bulked up instead. Her shoulders and thighs looked like a weight lifter\u2019s. She\u2019d never cared about sports but gaining strength in bone and muscle was absolutely necessary for her stay on Wenshi.\nShe might as well read Zhu\u2019s excerpts. She was a scientist, of course she was curious. Even if he was trying to drag her into some crazy cult. Pfft.\nOkay, that was an interesting paper. The authors had measured pattern resonances in the twenty-ninth layer of space, the very one that starships needed to enter for FTL travel. Sifan told herself that the human mind was made to see patterns, even where none existed, but the papers kindled a little flame of curiosity. A sentient universe. Hidden deep in the layers of space, invisible to human eyes but now, only recently, detectable by human instruments and human mathematics. It was such a tempting idea. If space was talking, what did it say? And to who?\nShe couldn\u2019t help herself and looked up the location of the physics laboratory. She\u2019d expected it to be in deep space somewhere, but it was actually situated here on Wenshi. Unmanned probes registered the waves in deep space and brought it here.\nSo, the lab was on Wenshi. Theoretically close, in practice a grueling six-hour three-G train journey away. No way she was going there. The daily trek to her cork trees was hard enough. No, this was one time scientific curiosity would have to take a back seat. She had gone all in on her spiral rocket project, and she had to see it through, no matter how enticing the new idea was.\nShe swiped the papers away and crawled into bed. Her bones ached, as always. Her stomach churned from eating too much, her intestines labored to get the food processed under the extra gravity. Sifan cued her sleeping macro and switched off.\nThe next day, Sifan set off for her trees again.\nShe wished she could walk over the lush grass, through the orchard\u2019s shadows, unimpeded, free. But laboriously, in a suit, would have to do for now. She patted her favorite tree\u2019s bark. It grew in a convoluted, twisted shape that in a human being or a mammal would denote agony, but all she got from the tree was contentment and quiet power. \u201cGood tree,\u201d she whispered. Nobody could see her being silly. \u201cGood, thick cork.\u201d\nIf the trees screamed when their bark was harvested, was that like space when her rocket tore through it? What if everything was alive and aware, trees, space, the universe?\nBack in the pod, she looked up when she was due to visit her space bees. The shuttle port was halfway to the space lab. She asked the AI if it thought she could go to the space lab instead of the bee visit. The AI needed all of half a minute to think about that. The answer was yes, if she rested up for a week before the journey and snacked every hour to store up energy. That meant fat. Sivan pinched her waist. It hadn\u2019t seen fat for months now. She sighed. Eating, more eating. Who\u2019d have ever thought she\u2019d balk at extra chocolate?\nThe mandated week of rest left Sifan feeling uncommonly fit and frisky. Maybe the AI should schedule rest periods more often. She put on the dreaded suit with anticipation and the short walk to the cart didn\u2019t feel as arduous as usual.\nPeople hardly looked her in the face as they helped her into the train to the physics laboratory. Did everyone hate outworlders or something?\nBut then she caught a glimpse of her face in a mirror and realized what signals she gave off. Downward lines around the mouth and eyes denoted misery and anger and hopelessness. She might not feel that, but the heavy gravity\u2019s drag on her facial muscles told a different story. Great. She was doomed to live among people who disliked her on sight. And even worse, when she left here, her face might never go back to its normal state. She\u2019d be all bunched-up jaw muscle and heavy brow ridge, and normal people would shy away from her.\nThe AI recommended a dose of mood lightener and for once she complied. This was already a hard day, and it would get worse. She was entitled to a little help.\nThe train rolled through the beautiful hilly landscape, dotted with the lavish blues and turquoises of the native flora instead of the imported Earth species. The train crested a rise and started to travel downward. Sifan spotted the building that must be the physics lab at once. It was huge. That had to be a black hole suspension station. Her vague fantasy of Wenshi being a rural, backward place had clearly been all wrong.\nThe head of the lab met Sifan in person. She was an elderly woman, as short and powerfully built as everybody here. She took one look at Sifan and offered to skip the planned lunch and speeches.\nSifan could have cried at the kindness but took the opportunity to skip the formalities with both hands. A wheelchair had been set out for her and the director personally pushed Sifan to the demonstration of the space resonance work.\nThe director wheeled her into a large room full of people hunched over workstations. A few large screens displayed data flows.\n\u201cWe send out below AI-threshold drones to gather data,\u201d the director explained, \u201cto circumvent quantum effects, and compile and sort them here. We\u2019ve prepared some samples for you on screen.\u201d\nThe presentation flipped through the different resonances of space layers, which Sifan knew all too well. But she\u2019d never seen them plotted onto time like this. Space layer eighteen resonated a certain pattern, repeated it for years on end. The presentation skipped to layer twenty-nine. This too, showed certain resonances, seemingly random. But then they flipped to the same resonances, although in a different register.\u201d\n\u201cHow does this compare in real time?\u201d Sifan asked, excited.\n\u201cFirst layer eighteen, for almost two years, then layer twenty-nine, for several months.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your hypothesis?\u201d Sifan asked.\n\u201cIt seems like a conversation to me, to us,\u201d Director Pailaa said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve built a station far away from gravity wells and space lanes to project this resonance to layers eighteen and twenty-nine.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cWe got an answer! Look at the charts. It returns the Fibonacci sequence.\u201d\nAfter the presentation wound up, Sifan was invited to go for drinks with the whole crew. The director rescued her from the social dilemma of refusing.\n\u201cMx. Vandervoort has only been in our gravity for a few months, she doesn\u2019t have the stamina yet to join us right now.\u201d\n\u201cRain check?\u201d Sifan said, working her smile muscles as hard as she could, hoping they would project happiness and warmth.\n\u201cRain check.\u201d\nSifan fell asleep on the train journey back, something she regretted very much when she woke stiff and aching, stiffer and achier than usual, still in her skeleton suit. And she still had to trek back to her pod.\nAs the large, orange sun started to set, it was hard to concentrate on the road. Not just because of her tiredness, but because the graphs the physicists had shown her danced before her eyes. Sure, it was only a Fibonacci sequence, one of the most basic ways to communicate intelligence, but what if they were right? What did that mean for her?\nThat night, she dreamed of rainbow-colored space trees singing to each other. Even dream-Sifan sighed at the silliness of her own imagination.\nThe next day Sifan went out on her planned tour of the cork orchard. She didn\u2019t override it, although her sore body and buzzing mind would have been a good excuse. But she felt the need to stick to her routine for now. She didn\u2019t examine those feelings too closely. Not yet.\nThe cork orchard bathed in early morning light, everything more orange than under the Earth-normal lighting at the pod. Which was kind of silly if you thought about how long ago humanity had first left Earth, but if you had to have standardized units, it might as well be those of your planet of origin.\nShe flipped her vision to what the orchard would look like under the Earth sun, and for the first time, she found the cooler beiges and greens dull and chilly. Maybe she was finally getting acclimated.\nShe took away the filter and enjoyed the intense blue of the sky, the greenness of the grass, the warm ocher colors of the bark. Wenshi was beautiful. She wished she could walk around without the skeleton suit already. She wanted to lie down in the grass and smell the earth.\nWell, she could do that. Just very carefully.\nThe AI showed her the kneeling sequence. It wasn\u2019t a thing to do lightly, because her weight would be on one leg most of the time, a bent leg at that. Risky. First she had to carefully position her hand on the nearest tree, turn on extra support on that wrist, and then turn on extra support on the outer leg. Only then could she start to slowly lift the inner leg and move it backward.\nThe servos whined, or was that her imagination?\nFreeze that position, unfreeze the wrist, move the hand downward, slowly. And repeat.\nBriefly she focused on the grass. She could smell it already.\nHer hand slipped, and the next thing she knew she was facedown on the earth. Her legs were in the right position, but her right hand had transferred the weight too soon onto the left hand, and that had made her torso bend down too far. And now she had a nosebleed and had probably broken her left wrist. She was in agony.\n\u201cRequest to cede control,\u201d the AI said. \u201cCounting down from five, four, three . . . \u201d\n\u201cCede!\u201d Sifan screamed.\nThe medical stinger shot her full of muscle relaxant so she wouldn\u2019t accidentally work against the suit. It repositioned itself in brief bursts to minimize the injury and prepare itself to lift Sifan back up. There was no possible help out here.\n\u201cPain relief,\u201d Sifan gasped.\nAlmost instantly the pain went away. She was such an idiot. Why hadn\u2019t she given the AI more control?\nThe suit\u2019s process of getting her upright again was nothing like the way a human would do it. Sifan had to close her eyes to keep herself from seeing the way her knees and feet were being used. Better. Now she was alone in her own head. She cut off audio as well.\nBut not all senses could be cut off. A sudden surge of nausea forced her to open her eyes, to discover her head was now hanging midway before her torso, her arms somewhere behind her, her legs herky-jerkying backward in something not quite like walking.\n\u201cPlease put me upright,\u201d Sifan gasped. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d\nThis is the optimal position for regurgitation in this moment, the AI sent back.\nYup, there she went. Look at all those calories she would have to re-eat, puddling there on the ground. Sad.\nThe process was a little better with an empty stomach. Sifan managed to reach the car without further mishaps. The AI sat her down.\nI advise turning audio on, the AI said.\nSifan sighed but followed the advice. Oh, that\u2019s why it had said that. A vehicle was coming. At great speed, too. The AI wouldn\u2019t allow her to turn her head, probably wise considering the fall, so she had to wait until it drove into her field of vision.\nIt was Zhu\u2019s jeep, careening into view at hair-raising speeds. Sifan wondered at the g-forces that his body would suffer in those tight curves and the thought of them would have made her ache if her pain receptors had still been working. What was he doing?\n\u201cZhu?\u201d she croaked.\n\u201cMx. Vandervoort!\u201d Zhu jumped out of the jeep, landing with a thud on the orange soil. Sifan winced, but he seemed fine, and even bounced a little as he ran up to her vehicle.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. The AI\u2019s got it.\u201d\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t touch you,\u201d he said, sounding exasperated. \u201cI read the guidelines. But you are hurt, and I wanted to offer you my support.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of support?\u201d Sifan regretted that she was snapping, but the mood enhancers and pain suppressors ironed out her fine voice control.\n\u201cEmotional support? You can suppress pain, but you must feel so helpless right now. Let me go with you to your pod. You shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d\nWhat difference would that make?\nBut Sifan felt something burn in her eye. Tears, for god\u2019s sake. Suppress them, she ordered the AI. She didn\u2019t think it could actually directly influence her tear ducts, but it did something. She was now floating on a cloud and Zhu had receded.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said with a thick voice. She wanted to be mad at her own weakness, but all she felt was gratitude.\nSifan was aware of time and landscape passing her by, but it didn\u2019t affect her. The various orchard trees waved their branches over her head\u2014oak, apple, quince, pear, chestnut. Then just blue sky. Then a sliver of beige at the edge of her field of vision.\nFor a while, she couldn\u2019t think which tree was beige, until at last she realized it was her pod. Oh. Zhu had brought her home. How kind. She couldn\u2019t recall what should come next. She might get very hot during the afternoon, and very cold during the night. The suit might help with that though.\nAnd then she floated inside the pod and was lowered onto the bed. Oh, right, her vehicle had a detachable float for heavy luggage and such.\nThe AI was directing someone to take the skeleton suit off her. She felt some jostling, and would have laughed at Zhu\u2019s painstakingly clumsy antics in the standard gravity, if she could have mustered sufficient oomph. But all her oomph was gone, dissolved in a cloud of painkillers. So nice.\nWhen she opened her eyes again, the light was different. It was the next morning. Her whole body ached, but only in a pleasant way, like after a hike.\nShe levered herself up very carefully on her right elbow and looked down on the left arm. Yup, cast. The readout said, \u201cCompound fracture. Cast will disintegrate in approximately four days and twelve hours.\u201d\nGreat, that meant four days locked up in the pod. She\u2019d lose so much muscle mass!\nA sound.\nSifan found that she was wearing a pair of comfortable pajamas, with practical closures for the one-armed, that she didn\u2019t remember printing or putting on. Zhu? Carefully, testing out the limits of her pain meds, she shuffled to the door.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d she said.\nZhu stood there in the hot sunlight. Judging by the slant, it was late afternoon. \u201cHere to cheer up the wounded!\u201d\nSifan didn\u2019t feel cheered up yet. Socializing seemed daunting and exhausting.\nZhu gestured behind him. \u201cWe\u2019re having a party, and you\u2019re invited.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t go out into three G for a week until the fracture is healed,\u201d Sifan said. What an excellent excuse that was. She should break her wrist more often.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Zhu said with a wide grin. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why the party has come to you!\u201d\nSifan just gaped.\n\u201cOpen your door, put a chair in the doorway, and you\u2019re good.\u201d\nSifan couldn\u2019t think of an excuse.\nShe opened the door wider. It was strange and unpleasantly thrilling to do that without her skeleton suit on, even though she knew the pod would extend the gravity on for at least a meter.\nThe scent of hot air and grass drifted in.\nPeople were bustling around a barbecue and a water station, others setting up chairs and tables.\n\u201cSee? You don\u2019t have to do anything. Go get your chair and enjoy!\u201d\nSifan didn\u2019t even enjoy parties all that much in one G, let alone in the crushing three G environment. But let\u2019s face it, she had nothing better to do today. She might as well pig out and get drunk.\nShe dragged her office chair over to the doorway.\nA young relative of Zhu\u2019s brought her a plate, sticking it very carefully into the one G field. Pouring wine from three G to one G led to many spills and much laughter, but eventually Sifan could sip the rough red from her glass and relax.\nPeople walked up to chat with her. She didn\u2019t manage to remember any of the names, but keeping up the stream of chatter was oddly soothing. She settled deeper into the chair. Apparently, this was just what she\u2019d needed. And Zhu had somehow divined that.\nAfter some furious activity over the grills, children started bringing her plates with veggies and tofu.\nZhu sat down next to her. There was barely room for his wide body in the one G field, but he was painstakingly not pushing accidental elbows into the planet\u2019s gravity. Sifan idly wondered what that would do to the body, having half of it in and half out of different gravities. Nothing good, she suspected.\nA couple of kids set up their play screens at her feet. Sifan couldn\u2019t make head or tail of the game they were playing. Their opponents seemed to have extremely variable wait times. But it made the kids squeal in delight when the answers did come through.\n\u201cWhat are they playing? A new kind of game?\u201d she said. No adult who wasn\u2019t a professional gamer could keep up with the rapidly changing fashions in gaming.\n\u201cThey\u2019re communicating with the universe. Or a universe,\u201d Zhu said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sifan turned her head dangerously close to the gravity field\u2019s limit to properly check out Zhu\u2019s expression.\n\u201cReally. We tried communication with the universe, or universes, or layers, we don\u2019t know yet, and at first we got responses. But after a while it dried up, and we didn\u2019t know why. Did we do something wrong, did they die, did the circumstances changes, well, lots of variables. But then someone brilliant, not me, got the idea that maybe it had gotten bored. So we let kids use the interface. Not because we took that idea very seriously at first, but more because, why not?\u201d\nZhu spread his hands. \u201cAnd the universe answered. And kept answering! So now we have a group of kids who play with the universe.\u201d\nFascinating! \u201cDo you have any idea why children communicate better with the universe, or whatever it is, than adults?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just guessing. Playfulness, unexpectedness? Who knows. It works. We\u2019re grateful that something works.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it that you want from the universe?\u201d Sifan asked. The two species, if you could call the universe a species, could have little in common.\n\u201cGood question. To acknowledge each other\u2019s existence, to communicate? Are humans beings of good will? I like to think we are. So they\u2019d want us to stop destroying their habitat, or their physical being.\u201d\nZhu got up to get some more beautifully charred tofu, and left Sifan to stare at the giggling, shrieking children. Apparently the universe was a fun playmate. The mind boggled.\nSifan couldn\u2019t see what the kids did on the screen, or what they reacted to, but their mood was infectious. She found herself smiling and lifting her face to the last sunshine. When had she truly relaxed or played for the last time? Well before her arrival here. Probably when she\u2019d been experimenting with her rocket drive.\nTears pricked in her eyes when she recalled how joyful that had been. Hard work, but filled with pleasure and anticipation and the sheer exhilaration of creating something new. Why, oh why had she thought she had to be the person to not only invent the new drive, but to bring it to market as well? The weight of the investors\u2019 fortunes dragged her down and sucked the joy out of life.\nNot the gravity. Never the gravity.\nWithout realizing it, Sifan had brought up on her screen the name of the man who had begged for the job she was doing now. Who\u2019d wanted to organize grants for her so she could continue doing what she did best, play and experiment and invent. And she\u2019d been too proud and ambitious to accept that offer.\nWould he still want to do it now?\nBecause what she really wanted to do was storm out of her one G bubble and join those kids on their screens. Already her mind was fizzing and popping with imminent ideas, tickling against the surface of her brain like champagne bubbles against glass.\nThe evening closed in, soft and purple, all around the picnickers and Sifan. The edges of people and trees shimmered and blurred, erasing the differences between them.\nSifan bent forward as far as she dared. \u201cIf we asked the universe to let our ships through more easily, what would it say?\u201d she asked the children.\nThey giggled and shrugged, turning back to their screens.\nSifan composed the first of a string of emails in her mind. To Tarik, to take over her job. To her broker, to sell her shares in the cork rocket company. To her old university, to ask if her deferred job was open as of next month.\nShe couldn\u2019t stop the production of her Borer rockets. There was too much financial and political weight behind the venture. But if she could find a kinder way to travel, her invention would become obsolete soon enough.\nShe sent the emails. The relief was enormous. An asteroid-sized weight slid off her shoulders.\nNo more dull routines and tight deadlines. She was, and always had been, an inventor. She needed to play, to be free. These children had shown her the error in her thinking. You shouldn\u2019t need to break the universe to travel through it.\nShe would find another way.\nBo Balder lives and works close to Amsterdam.

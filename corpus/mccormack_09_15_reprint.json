Really we were talking about what we\u2019d do with the tutor if we could get our hands on him. You\u2019ve seen the Level 12 \u2019casts, you know the guy I mean. When I realized all our witty lust had turned into monologue, I glanced over at Callie. She was sitting back in the sofa with her feet up on the table, her tongue sticking out, and a piece of glass pressed up against her forearm.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll ruin the carpet,\u201d I said.\n \u201cFuck the carpet.\u201d\n \u201cMm, you know, I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d\n I watched with interest, wondering how far she\u2019d get. God only knows how she\u2019d found something sharp\u2014everything round here is so smooth, no rough edges. Nothing to mark you, no way to leave your mark. Callie cut into the flesh, and blood surged out, a shock of bright color. She went paler beneath her skin bleach and her hand started to shake. \u201cShit,\u201d she muttered, as blood dripped onto the table. Her mother had told me at least twice how expensive that had been, so I dread to think how often she must have said it to Callie.\n I took the piece of glass from her. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d One quick surgical strike from me, and her tracker was out. It\u2019s been bugging her ever since it went in. Ho ho. By now Callie was starting to get a thin, papery look\u2014sort of see-through\u2014so I wrapped a towel tight around her arm and made her hold it above her head like they\u2019d shown me in the public hospital when I was getting my social credits. Then, to show moral support, I nicked my finger tip. A ruby red bead welled up, and I waved my hand at Callie. \u201cHey, we can be blood sisters!\u201d\n She pulled a face. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting!\u201d Maybe, but it made her forget to feel sick, and she jumped up and went over to the door that led out onto the balcony. \u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201d\n \u201cOut? It\u2019ll be hot, Cal, you won\u2019t like it.\u201d\n \u201cI mean really out. Leave your key on the table.\u201d\n I knew then what she had planned for us. I glanced over at the tutorial that was still playing through, and bit my lip. Callie hissed with impatience. \u201cCome on! We\u2019ve got to be there in ten minutes!\u201d\n Well, it\u2019s Callie\u2019s home, and I\u2019m the guest, so I unclipped my key from my belt, and put it on the table next to her tracker. Off we went, leaving the tutor talking to the empty room, and all the while our accounts were racking up the study points for the modules he labored through.\n We walked down the main lane that runs through the estate. All the houses are on one side and the school stuff on the other. We went past the arts block and then along by the tennis courts where the teams were out practicing. We were heading roughly towards the cinema, but before we got there, Callie led me down a side path. We cut through some bushes, and soon we came to the wall, smooth and tall and impregnable. Except for a gap where it ended and the railings began, where the bushes hadn\u2019t grown thick. Someone very slim could slip through. So we did.\n We started down the road into town. There was still pavement most of the way, although in some places it had gone completely and there was only dust. Callie was already complaining about her shoes. The road was walled on either side of its entire length, the back of our estate and another one, and I think some government agency has houses round here. I\u2019d been down this road in the car hundreds of times, but it\u2019s a lot different up close with those walls looming over you. The not-so-homely home counties. After about five minutes, Callie stopped by an old bus shelter and said, \u201cOkay, now we wait.\u201d\n \u201cAre we getting the bus, Cal?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t have any actual money, that\u2019s all\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\n A couple of cars sped past, and each time my heart jumped\u2014I look young for fifteen and you don\u2019t tend to see people hanging around much on the main roads. But soon enough a car pulled up, and this guy\u2014nineteen, maybe twenty\u2014leaned out. \u201cHi, Cal,\u201d he said. \u201cHop in.\u201d He looked at me, hanging back, and laughed. \u201cAnd your little friend too, if she\u2019s coming.\u201d I went red and scrambled into the back while Callie graced the passenger seat.\n If we\u2019re speaking geographically, I\u2019ve no idea where we went, but it was a party, of course, and it was up in a second-floor flat. Music was thumping out of the open windows and inside it was all sweat and noise and bodies. How Callie finds out about this kind of thing I don\u2019t know, but somehow she manages. She was in the thick of it straight away, but I stayed back near the drinks table and tried not to look conspicuous.\n It wasn\u2019t long before some guy started talking to me\u2014well, yelling, really; he had to, over the music. \u201cYou from that estate up the road? The one with the school?\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cVery nice.\u201d He was tanned, and when he smiled I noticed his bottom teeth were slightly crooked.\n I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Usually I can do more than monosyllables, but it was really noisy and his smile had made me feel self-conscious. \u201cBit dull.\u201d\n \u201cI bet.\u201d He nodded at Callie. \u201cThat your friend?\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s something else, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n That\u2019s me\u2014gateway to Callie. I did what I was there for and introduced them, although he didn\u2019t get very far with her, because about five minutes after that the police kicked the door in and started yanking us all out. They\u2019d put an emergency dispersal order on the place. I suppose one of the neighbors had got fed up with the noise.\n The police pulled me and Callie out of the crowd right away. It\u2019s not that they profile, but . . . look, I know it sounds bad, but a lot\u2019s been spent on the two of us, from before we were conceived, and our skin looks good and our hair looks good and our teeth look good, and . . . you can just tell, all right? That there\u2019s money around. As we were taken off to a car everyone else was being piled into vans. I saw the guy we\u2019d been talking to, and he shrugged at me and gave me his crooked smile, as if to say, \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d When we got to the station, a policewoman made us tea while Callie\u2019s mother drove out to get us. She was laughing and apologizing as she paid the fine, but once we were in the car it came out about the tracker and that was the cue for tears and shouting.\n \u201cI\u2019m particularly disappointed in you, Miranda.\u201d Mrs. Banville glared back at me in the rear-view mirror. She\u2019s monstrous; done far too much to her face. \u201cI would have expected you to have shown more sense. For gratitude\u2019s sake, if nothing else.\u201d\n I stared out of the window at the walls speeding past. Of course. I\u2019m supposed to be glad to have a home. But what could she expect, from someone with my background?\n \u201cThe whole idea,\u201d Penny said later, \u201cis to keep you safe.\u201d They were in Bombay\u2014or was it L.A.? I didn\u2019t quite catch it. They move around a lot because they can\u2019t live here and won\u2019t get citizenship anywhere else out of principle.\n \u201cI know . . . \u201d\n \u201cThe Banvilles are being exceptionally kind letting you stay with them.\u201d\n \u201cI know . . . \u201d\n \u201cI know we can\u2019t always be perfect, Em, but you really shouldn\u2019t be causing them any trouble.\u201d\n A tiny white scar had formed on my fingertip, like the shadow of the crescent of my nail. Most of the time I\u2019m never quite sure where they are. Why can\u2019t I go exploring for once?\n \u201cWhat we need to consider now are your options,\u201d Fran said. \u201cThe school\u2019s saying they\u2019ll have to invalidate all this year\u2019s marks.\u201d\n That stupid tutorial. If only I\u2019d switched it off before we left. \u201cI did that once!\u201d\n \u201cWe believe you, Em,\u201d Penny said, kindly. Talking to them together can be like good cop, bad cop. One with the teapot, the other with the van. \u201cBut we\u2019re not the ones handing out the marks. As far as the school can tell, every single one of your credits this year hasn\u2019t actually been earned.\u201d\n I slumped back in my chair. All that work. Sometimes I could murder Callie. But who\u2019d look after her, if I didn\u2019t?\n \u201cSo here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got planned,\u201d Fran said, laying it out briskly, clearly, and with no room for argument. This is why she makes so much money as a lawyer. Penny winked at me like she always does when Fran gets going, but I felt too miserable to wink back. \u201cI\u2019ve got a much better plan,\u201d I said, when Fran finished. \u201cI come and join you and we can be a family again.\u201d\n My mothers glanced at each other. \u201cEm,\u201d Penny said, \u201cI know you think it\u2019d be chic, and cosmopolitan, but actually it\u2019s dreary. Plane, hotel, plane, hotel\u2014you can\u2019t tell one from the other.\u201d\n \u201cThis way you\u2019re getting a proper education,\u201d Fran said.\n \u201cBoth of us are working all the hours god sends, sweetheart\u2014you\u2019d be alone most of the time, you\u2019d get bored, and lonely\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014not to mention you\u2019re getting the passport, and I surely don\u2019t need to outline the tangible benefits of that\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ll be at college soon, love. Then you won\u2019t want to bother with us at all.\u201d\n See what I mean? After all that, saying, but I\u2019d still rather be with you, just sounds lame, so I said nothing, and studied my tiny scar. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw them look at each other and smile. Mother\u2019s face softened, mum\u2019s went sort of serene. They\u2019re still crazy about each other, even after all this time, and all the trouble. I think that scares me most\u2014that maybe now that I\u2019m not there, they\u2019re discovering how much I got in the way. That maybe they shouldn\u2019t have gone to all the bother of having me in the first place.\n \u201cSweetheart, we\u2019ve got to go now\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the Banvilles and fix it all up. We\u2019ll talk to you from Toronto.\u201d\n \u201cTake care, love. And try to be good. Remember\u2014back home, you\u2019re our ambassador. For the cause.\u201d\n We blew kisses at each other, and they finished the call. And I was left sitting here alone, in this expensive house on this exclusive estate, thinking I would give up everything just to be with them. All the money doesn\u2019t matter. Because \u2018round here, in this stupid narrow strip of the world, I\u2019m the one whose parents had to go and live abroad. I\u2019m the one with dykes for mummies.\n So Callie and I were packed off to Scotland for the summer. The idea was to make up all the invalidated work, but really we were doing time for breaking out.\n Our home for the holiday was on Mull. My mothers had bought a house there when they got married, but when the law changed back and they had to either leave the country or split, they\u2019d signed it over to me. That\u2019s me\u2014absentee landlady. We\u2019d never come here much even when we were all together; it\u2019s a long journey up by road and of course\u2014as Mrs. Banville reminded us\u2014it\u2019s not the done thing to take too many internal flights. She and Mr. B. were flying off the day after we left to go skiing in Queenstown.\n Anila drove us up. Anila was going to be our tutor, not to mention our personal jailer. Callie\u2019s father trades in academic bonds, so it had been easy for him to get hold of someone. Anila was quiet and slim and neat and . . . sort of faded, really. Part of the background, like wallpaper. If Callie spoke to her, it was always past her, at a point to one side of Anila\u2019s right ear. It\u2019s exactly how her mother talks to me. Except when she shows me off to her friends. Then I\u2019m the second child she never had. \u201cThis is Em,\u201d she\u2019ll say. \u201cWe\u2019re taking care of her while her mothers have to be away.\u201d How could you not be impressed at that? Such good work, for such a worthy cause.\n Callie hadn\u2019t said a word about our banishment, but I knew she was seething. She\u2019d had plans for the summer, I think, down in the city. Ever since we\u2019d been caught, and another tracker installed, she\u2019d only worn short sleeves, so you could always see the scar on her left arm where the other one had been. Like some weird kind of fashion accessory. She spent the whole trip up with sunglasses on, staring out of the car window and not talking. It made the journey pretty boring, particularly when we came back down off the expressway past Birmingham. The whole north is terraced, straight lines of olive groves and vineyards. Dead dull. The only entertainment came when we went through a toll and new adverts came on. Mine are always insane, because of the trust money. Callie\u2019s were all for vitamin supplements or local jobbing doctors.\n At Carlisle, Callie insisted on stopping, and Anila bought us ice cream, like we were children. Callie devoured hers in seconds, but I let mine have the chance to melt, so I could chase the vanilla and the raspberry as it dripped along my fingers and down my hand. Anila had done the same, and we both realized this at exactly the same moment, both of us licking up syrup, and catching each other\u2019s eye. Her face flowered into a smile, and she was suddenly something human. I went shy, and ran off to the toilets to find Callie. She said she was feeling sick from the heat and the sugar, and while she was throwing up, I stood behind her in the door of the cubicle and picked at the gaffer tape covering the foreign language instructions for the sharps box. You get to go to all the best places with Callie. When she was done, I cleaned her face and smoothed her hair, and took her back out to the car where Anila was waiting.\n We took the ferry, and were over at the house by eight o\u2019clock. Callie disappeared right away, and I took my supper outside and sat looking at the wall of sea between me and the mainland, smooth as glass and offering no purchase. Round about half-nine, Anila called softly from inside that perhaps I should think about going to bed, so I left my plate with her, and did what I was told. But I lay awake for hours, trying to hear the sea beneath the throb and the backbeat of bass coming through the wall from Callie\u2019s room. That was our first night on the island.\n The next morning, Anila established our routine. I got up early and swam some lengths in the pool before breakfast, and then the morning was for studying. Anila kept us at the grindstone till one o\u2019clock, and then we were free to do what we liked. As prisons go, it wasn\u2019t a bad one\u2014I mean, it was hardly one of those places on the fen islands you see on shockumentaries. There was the pool, and the lush lawns and bright flowers, and those twisted citrus trees with the knobbly misshaped oranges. Pen had installed a decent library with proper books. There was a path down to the private strip of beach\u2014yellow sands and palm trees\u2014and everything we could want in the house itself. A good job, really, given how grounded we were. Leaving the house and gardens was clearly and strictly forbidden. A prison is a prison all the same.\n I spent most afternoons on the beach. When it was too hot, I would just sit in the shade and read, but I liked to be in the water, and poke around the rock pools, and wave at the pleasure boats. One day I built sandcastles just to watch the tide wash them away. Callie mostly stayed indoors watching films from after the second war, but she would join me now and again, and sit smothered in sun cream beneath a big umbrella, staring out to sea and chain-smoking. She wore her sunglasses and a headscarf, like something from one of the pictures she\u2019d been watching. I\u2019ve no idea how she\u2019d got her hands on cigarettes. Could have been smugglers for all I know.\n Anila went off in the afternoons. I didn\u2019t know where she went or what she did, but supper was ready at seven o\u2019clock. I took it out to my spot on the wall, and tried not to hear Callie thumping around the house. Anila would come and sit with me sometimes, maybe one night out of three, although we didn\u2019t talk much. It\u2019s weird to think back on it now, that month we spent alone together on the island. Just the three of us, flitting around that place, like moths trapped in a bell jar, or spirits of a house that couldn\u2019t find rest. I imagine that\u2019s how Callie felt most of the time.\n Obviously we were heading for a massive storm. When it came it was faster than the Norwich tornado, and might have done as much damage too if I hadn\u2019t intervened.\n I suppose it had been brewing for a couple of days. When people are stuck together like that it\u2019s always going to be a pressure cooker, but it had been getting hotter, and that day was the hottest yet. The sky was unnaturally blue, almost fluorescent. We were slogging through one of the set texts, and Callie was sitting in her usual position, leaning forward on her desk with her hand shielding her eyes. I didn\u2019t mind doing all the work again\u2014I was never going to struggle with the exams, and now I could just enjoy it for its own sake. It was a good feeling, sort of magical, but I probably don\u2019t need to say how pissed off Callie was about having to do it again.\n Even Anila was hard pressed to conjure up her usual enthusiasm. Anila always dressed very properly, in a gray suit\u2014she never took the jacket off\u2014and with her hair tied back. This morning wisps of hair had started to escape, and the jacket looked heavy and uncomfortable. She kept glancing across at Callie, and you could see that the way Callie was sitting was beginning to annoy her. As it was meant to.\n \u201cCallie, could you sit up, please?\u201d\n Callie remained motionless for a second or two, and then she eased back in her chair. She kept the shield up though.\n \u201cAnd put your hand down so I can see your face, please.\u201d\n There was another pointed delay, and then Callie moved her hand\u2014to pick up her sunglasses and perch them on her nose.\n \u201cOh, come on, Callie!\u201d\n \u201cI have to wear them,\u201d Callie said primly. \u201cI had the laser thing done and my eyes are very sensitive.\u201d\n \u201cYes, well, I\u2019m sure your parents would have mentioned that\u2014\u201d\n Callie shrugged. \u201cYou can ask them if you like.\u201d\n \u201cGiven they\u2019re halfway around the globe and almost certainly asleep, I\u2019ll have to wait \u2018till we\u2019re sharing waking hours to do that. In the meantime\u2014take the glasses off. Please.\u201d\n \u201cIt was very expensive surgery. They\u2019ll be furious if you make me ruin it.\u201d\n \u201cCallie, you know you\u2019re just being rude. Take them off, and we can get back to work. The summer\u2019s well underway and we have a lot of work to make up yet.\u201d\n At that, Callie stretched back lazily in her chair. \u201cDo you really think I care?\u201d She looked very cool and relaxed. She\u2019d been taking tips from those old films, and had outfitted herself in crisp white linen, and a black scarf with little gold beads to match the frames of those stupid glasses. She was Audrey Hepburn to Anila\u2019s Jane Eyre.\n \u201cYou should care,\u201d Anila said. \u201cYour future\u2019s hanging on it. Or, if this one gets through to you, a lot of your parents\u2019 money is being ploughed into educating you\u2014\u201d\n Callie stopped her with a laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t really think I\u2019m going to fail any of this, can you?\u201d\n This was actually a pretty good point. Callie\u2019s A-starred like me, fast-tracking in all fifteen subjects. She just can\u2019t be bothered most of the time.\n \u201cThis time next year I\u2019ll be starting on the Law Prelims.,\u201d Callie went on. \u201cAnd a year after that I\u2019ll be passing them. What will you be doing then, Miss Gray? Teaching someone else\u2019s five-year-olds how to spell and wipe their arses? Hardly the Bront\u00ebs, is it, or Shakespeare? What about the year after that, Miss Gray, and the year after that? Not long now and I\u2019ll be at the bar, and you\u2019re right\u2014the parents will pay for the lot. How long exactly till your bond\u2019s paid off? All that education, it doesn\u2019t come cheap, does it?\u201d\n Anila had been getting redder and redder through all of this. Maybe Callie should have remembered that Anila must have been smart to get herself this far. At least as smart as Callie herself. When Callie was done, Anila tucked a stray bit of hair behind her ear, and took a moment or two to compose herself.\n \u201cYou\u2019re quite right, Miss Caroline,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad life, if you think too much about it. But I do have some points in my favor. I don\u2019t have to hide from my own face. And I certainly don\u2019t have to shove a finger down my throat every time I eat.\u201d\n Callie went rigid. Then she was out of her chair and heading through the door, shouting back, \u201cYou\u2019d better believe I\u2019m telling my parents about this when they\u2019re up!\u201d\n \u201cYou do that,\u201d Anila called after her. \u201cIf in doubt, run to daddy.\u201d\n I\u2019d been sitting watching all of this with my hand over my mouth. Once Callie was gone, Anila heaved a deep, shaky sigh. She stood up, took off her jacket, and threw it over the back of the chair. She started pacing around the room, finally coming to a halt by the window. She looked tired and a lot older. I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just sat and nibbled my nail, but when she didn\u2019t move at all, I said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m well and truly sacked.\u201d\n I thought about that for a moment. Then I said, \u201cShe smokes, you know.\u201d\n Anila looked back at me, sharply. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cCallie. She\u2019s got a stash of cigarettes somewhere.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d Anila drifted back towards her table. She picked up her jacket and straightened it, then tidied her hair. Then she gave the ghost of a smile. \u201cI see. Thank you, Miranda.\u201d\n \u201cEm.\u201d\n When she looked up at me, her smile blossomed again, and I realized I liked seeing it. Liked earning it. \u201cThank you\u2014Em.\u201d\n It was enough to stop Callie. The health premiums would have rocketed and her parents would have killed her. So it was stalemate\u2014for a couple of days. Until Callie made her next bid for freedom.\n The next evening, I discovered where Anila went when she wasn\u2019t with us. I was looking for Callie, and after the likely places hadn\u2019t turned her up, I started on unlikely ones, which meant the library. It has a small first floor, a mezzanine really, and there\u2019s a door up there that leads out onto a balcony. I saw lamplight, and a shadow moving, so I went to check.\n Anila was sitting out on a deck chair. Her bare feet were up on another one, and when she saw me, she moved so I could sit down. Her dark hair was loose around her shoulders and she didn\u2019t have make-up on. It made her look nearly as young as us. She smiled at me and carried on rubbing value brand lotion into her hands.\n \u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d I said. \u201cIf you had got sacked, I mean?\u201d\n She stopped rubbing, and that tired and faded look returned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I owe a lot of money.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what that felt like. \u201cWhat will you do when it\u2019s paid?\u201d\n She went back to massaging her hands. \u201cYears before that, Em.\u201d\n \u201cStill, though. If you could choose.\u201d\n \u201cWell, I\u2019d get my own passport then. So travel, maybe. Teach\u2014I do like it, despite everything . . . \u201d She sighed. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe having the choice is what matters most.\u201d She looked out across the sea and the deepening sky and the generous sprinkling of stars that helped it all go down. \u201cI\u2019m lucky. Far worse places to live. Far worse ways to live.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m glad it all turned out okay. With Callie.\u201d\n \u201cWell, me too!\u201d We grinned at each other, and then all of a sudden I felt bad. She was so nice and I was so rich. She was looking at me like she felt sorry too. I stood up and was about to say goodnight, but then she said, \u201cYou do know, Em, don\u2019t you, that it\u2019s not your job in life to pick up after Callie?\u201d\n \u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s yours?\u201d\n She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job either, not really\u2014but they do give me money for it.\u201d\n Strange thing to say. I didn\u2019t quite understand, so I left her to the stars and her peace. I ended up going to bed later than usual that night, and without finding Callie.\n When I woke up, it was that weird and hazy hour between two and three. My head was throbbing. I got up and pulled back the curtains. Light was pouring out of the window along from mine, from Callie\u2019s room. Was she awake too? I padded out to the corridor and knocked on her bedroom door. \u201cCal?\u201d\n No answer. Thunder rumbled overhead. When I went in, the room was empty and Callie\u2019s stuff from class was dumped on the bed. She wasn\u2019t in the bathroom. Wherever she\u2019d been all day, she hadn\u2019t got back yet.\n I went downstairs. There were no more lights that I could see, inside or out. The thunder rumbled, much closer, and the air felt charged and crackling. I didn\u2019t find her, in either the usual or the unusual places. I felt stupid, knocking on Anila\u2019s door in the middle of the night, but there was a quick way to track Callie down and wandering aimlessly around the house wasn\u2019t it.\n We found her by the swimming pool, lying half-in and half-out of one of the changing rooms, translucent in the moonlight. I was glad Anila was there. She checked Callie\u2019s pulse and said, \u201cGo and call the coast guard, please, Em.\u201d They were over in no time, and Anila went with Callie, leaving me in the house. I spent the rest of the night sitting out on Anila\u2019s balcony, with my arms around my knees, listening to the thunder and whispering words like charms to get the storm to break. Sometimes your mood can mirror the weather. Sometimes it mirrors the sea.\n It didn\u2019t rain. The next morning was clear and very hot, and Anila came back to take me over to the hospital. Callie was propped up in bed, looking teenaged and frightened. The Banvilles got back the following day, and started taking it out on Anila. They only stopped when I pointed out that Callie\u2019s poison of choice was the antitoxin Mrs. Banville has to take with the anti-ageing drugs she\u2019s getting under the counter from her tame doctor. I bet Callie did that on purpose. The police would be interested in that, I thought, and saying that to them, that felt good, like electricity. I wasn\u2019t sure at first how much I could get away with, but when I told them to write off Anila\u2019s debt, they didn\u2019t put up a fight at all. All of which finished me with them, but it didn\u2019t matter much, because in the middle of all this, I turned sixteen. Other people get parties when they become citizens. I got to see what it looks like to have your stomach pumped. And, yes, I think Callie did that on purpose too.\n I stayed on at the house on the island for a few months. Fran and Penny said to come and join them, but they were in Paris and I wanted to be somewhere colder. The time had passed and they hadn\u2019t been there and I didn\u2019t want to be their little girl any more. Like I\u2019d never wanted to be their ambassador, or Callie\u2019s lapdog, or the Banvilles\u2019 charity case. Besides, I had access to the trust now and while I didn\u2019t know yet what I wanted to do with it, it was like Anila had said, that sometimes it\u2019s more about having the choice than making it. I got a really great haircut, and some expensive clothes. I\u2019ve been thinking of setting up scholarships\u2014I could buy whole schools if I wanted, and run them however I liked. If I knew the best way. I might go and study myself, although I don\u2019t know what. I might just get my eyes tinted instead.\n As for Anila\u2014she did travel. I didn\u2019t expect anything, but I get a message, now and then, from all over. The last one came after what happened to Beijing\u2014she\u2019s often there, in the wake of disasters, clearing up.

It had started an hour ago. A subtle trickle of guilt\u2014and, like a trickle of falling dust at the border of the city-caverns, it warned that the way forward was dangerous. Selemei squeezed Pelli tighter. Her daughter squeaked protest, so she released a little, nuzzled down between Pelli\u2019s puffed curls, and inhaled the sweet scent of kalla oil where her hair parted. She risked a glance down the brass dinner table at her partner, Xeref.\n Xeref sat deep in conversation with their elder son, the fingers of one pale hand buried in his silver hair, while their younger son listened raptly. Seeming to sense her glance, Xeref looked up, and his lips curved into a smile.\n She knew those fingers, those lips. A lick of heat; the memory of pleasure\u2014and then the fear struck her in the stomach, as unspeakable as the blood.\n Oh, holy Heile in your mercy, preserve my health, keep my senses intact . . .\n Selemei hid the tremors of her hands by rubbing them into Pelli\u2019s back. With a giggle, Pelli started kissing her cheeks. Selemei managed to return a few kisses, then tried to pull away by looking up at the electric chandelier that hung from the vaulted ceiling.\n Eight-year-old Aven tugged at her left hand, playing with the ruby drops dangling from her bracelet. \u201cCan I wear your bracelet, Mother?\u201d\n Caught in the breath of doom, she couldn\u2019t bear to make Aven frown. \u201cNot now, but someday, all right?\u201d\n Aven circled her wrist with her thin fingers, golden like Selemei\u2019s own, and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s so pretty.\u201d\n Not the word she would have used. The rubies looked like drops of blood. She had no doubt what Xeref had meant by them: blood is precious. When she\u2019d first begun her bleeding, Mother had taught her the same. In this age of decline, the noble blood of the Grobal Race was not to be wasted.\n Well, she hadn\u2019t wasted it! Seven pregnancies in twenty years of partnership with Xeref. Five live births, four of the children perfectly normal. And while Pelli\u2019s albinism might be recessive, it could do little harm here in the city-caverns. Their beautiful, brave Enzyel had just partnered into the Eighth Family to great acclaim. Meanwhile, however, the decline continued, and no success was ever enough\u2014even success paid for in blood.\n Another trickle made her want to scream.\n \u201cOff you go, now,\u201d she said instead, lowering Pelli\u2019s feet to the floor. The girl ran to her nurse-escort and patted the leg of his black silk suit. The escort frowned\u2014his Imbati castemark tattoo furrowed between his brows.\n \u201cPelli,\u201d Selemei scolded. \u201cWe don\u2019t touch the Imbati. Are you a big girl?\u201d\n \u201cBig girl.\u201d Pelli lifted her white hands away and wrung them over her head contritely. \u201cBig girl.\u201d\n \u201cAnd who are a big girl\u2019s hands for?\u201d\n \u201cPelli.\u201d\n \u201cAsk if you want your Verrid to hold you.\u201d\n Pelli\u2019s lip trembled, but she managed, \u201cMy please?\u201d\n \u201cOf course, young Mistress,\u201d the escort replied. He swooped her up in a twirl that turned the threatening tears into a cry of joy, and carried her from the dining room.\n Selemei sighed. Pelli was so big now. Perhaps if she\u2019d been smaller, more dependent on the breast, this doom could have been postponed. To Aven she said, \u201cTime to get ready for bed, darling.\u201d Aven\u2019s escort caught her glance and passed it to other Imbati of the Household, who quickly withdrew. At last even her sons Brinx and Corrim came to kiss her and excused themselves to their shared rooms.\n She had to speak now, while the blood could still protect her. She turned toward Xeref at the head of the table, but fear twined up into her throat.\n Xeref gave her an uncertain smile.\n Xeref\u2019s Imbati woman moved, noticeable now as she left her station behind his shoulder. Imbati Ustin\u2014tall, broad-shouldered, and muscular with her hair in several long braids that looked almost white against her tailored blacks\u2014easily pulled out one of the brass chairs that stood empty between them. Xeref stood up, still smiling, and moved to the new seat. Then Selemei\u2019s own manservant, Grivi, pulled out the chair beside his.\n Oh, to be close to him again!\n She couldn\u2019t move.\n If she got close, they would kiss\u2014if they kissed, they would make love\u2014if they made love, she would get pregnant again\u2014and even if she managed not to lose the pregnancy, there would be labor, and pain\u2014not just pain, but pain like with Pelli. The screaming. The blank darkness. She\u2019d wake up feeling like someone had dismembered her, her left leg dead to the hip, and this time, maybe her right, too. Maybe this time she wouldn\u2019t regain her ability to walk. Or maybe this time she wouldn\u2019t wake up at all.\n \u201cXeref, I can\u2019t,\u201d she blurted.\n \u201cSelemei?\u201d\n She stared down at her hands clutched in her lap, at the beautiful bracelet. The ruby drops looked dark in the shadow of the silk tablecloth. \u201cI know blood is precious. I know my duty to the Race. But I just can\u2019t anymore.\u201d\n The guilt sharpened when spoken aloud. She tried not to imagine what words might come from his mouth in reply. Perverse\u2014selfish\u2014unworthy\u2014\n Xeref cleared his throat. \u201cSelemei?\u201d\n Something touched her shoulder\u2014oh, mercy, that was his hand! Her whole body clenched in on itself, hardened. Her chest felt like a geode, unable to admit breath, crusted inside with fear.\n Xeref pulled his hand away. \u201cOh, Selemei, my jewel, my life\u2019s partner, my blessed Maiden Eyn\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n She shook her head. Tried to breathe.\n \u201cGrivi,\u201d said Xeref, \u201cis she all right?\u201d\n The Imbati made no answer.\n She could hear Xeref stand, pace the length of the table, but if she tried to respond, she\u2019d only moan, or scream. Abruptly, he left through the bronze door to the sitting room; she could hear him out there, murmuring to his Ustin.\n \u201cMistress,\u201d Grivi said in his deep soft voice, \u201cI have vowed to protect you.\u201d\n Her Grivi had helped her more in her recoveries than anyone, but could she really ask him to protect her from Xeref? Was that even possible? Would it mean she could never kiss Xeref again, never feel his arms around her? Did she really want such protection?\n She sipped a small breath. \u201cI understand, Grivi, thank you.\u201d\n Then Xeref came in. Selemei snapped her jaw shut.\n \u201cMy Selemei.\u201d Xeref\u2019s voice was husky, vibrating at the edge of control. He knelt beside her feet on the silk carpet.\n Elinda help me. Surely he wouldn\u2019t demand to have her while she still bled.\n His breath grated. \u201cI\u2014Ustin said\u2014you\u2019ve\u2014gnash it, Selemei, this is my fault!\u201d\n What? She frowned.\n \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. When Pelli was being born, I should have\u2014I don\u2019t know what I should have done. How could I listen to you scream and do nothing? I asked the doctors, but I only thought they would take away your pain, not that they\u2019d\u2014\u201d He dragged a breath. \u201cYou went quiet so suddenly. I thought Mother Elinda had plucked your soul away, and my own heart too. And then when you woke damaged! And it was my fault!\u201d\n She whispered, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t do anything . . . \u201d\n Xeref shook his head. He grasped her hand, his fingers pale against her golden skin, and lifted it until her bracelet sparkled in the light. \u201cI didn\u2019t give this to you because blood is precious, Selemei. I gave it to you because your blood is precious. You are precious. I don\u2019t care what the Family Council says, the Race doesn\u2019t deserve your life!\u201d\n She managed to look at him. His gray eyes, shining with emotion\u2014his silver hair, falling to his shoulders. Age had given him creases around his eyes; as it had given him more substance, it had also granted him more dignity and determination. And more influence\u2014he often reminded their boys that as the First Family\u2019s representative on the cabinet, he had the Eminence\u2019s ear.\n Yet he would put her first.\n \u201cXeref,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you.\u201d Her chest opened slowly. What would happen now? Was there a way forward over cracked uncertain stone?\n Xeref leaned close to her cheek for a kiss that barely touched her\u2014the same kind of careful innocence he\u2019d used when they\u2019d first become partners, to soften the age difference between them. He cleared his throat. \u201cMy Ustin tells me that in the last couple of months you\u2019ve been missing your friend, Tamelera,\u201d he said. When she frowned in bafflement at the change of subject, he added, \u201cGarr\u2019s partner, who moved away with him to Selimna?\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t stop a smile at that. \u201cDear, I know who Tamelera is; I sent her a radiogram last week.\u201d\n Xeref chuckled nervously. \u201cOf course you do.\u201d\n Selemei humored him. \u201cYour Ustin deserves credit for turning her powers of observation to Ladies\u2019 concerns. I do miss Tamelera. I could talk to her. We would play kuarjos together, and dareli, and we\u2019d talk.\u201d\n Xeref laid a hand against his chest. \u201cI could\u2014would you like me, to talk to you?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t we talk?\u201d\n A blush turned his pale cheeks pink. \u201cWell, we do.\u201d\n Though never before about the terrible things\u2014the real things. \u201cMaybe you could tell me what you and Brinx were talking about?\u201d\n Xeref smiled. \u201cYou can be proud of him. He\u2019s really getting to know the workings of the cabinet. Cousin Fedron likes working with him.\u201d\n \u201cI saw how Corrim listens,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d say he already knows more than you expect him to.\u201d\n Xeref nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s almost twelve.\u201d\n Selemei gulped. Corrim\u2019s twelfth birthday would make him eligible for Heir Selection if the worst occurred. \u201cMercy of Heile,\u201d she said, \u201cis the Eminence Indal unwell?\u201d\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Xeref waved his hands. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s well, of course he is. I\u2019m sorry. I scared you, and I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t how I thought this should work.\u201d\n Selemei sighed, too. She and Tamelera had talked of anything, everything, deliberately avoiding any discussion of their duties to the Race. But when had she and Xeref last spoken of anything but family? She tried to think of something else; anything else. Her mind was as empty as an abandoned cave pocket. \u201cI love you?\u201d\n \u201cI love you, too. My Selemei.\u201d He sounded awfully disappointed.\n \u201cSir,\u201d said Imbati Ustin, quietly behind his left shoulder. \u201cI believe you enjoy a game of kuarjos?\u201d\n Now hope lit his eyes. \u201cSelemei\u2014shall we play?\u201d He offered his arm.\n She had been walking with more courage, recently, with less worry that her left hip might fail unexpectedly. She still stood slowly, and walked slowly, but it felt good not to have to grasp Xeref\u2019s arm too hard. In the sitting room, someone\u2014Ustin, most likely\u2014had already moved the kuarjos set from its pedestal in the corner onto the slate-topped table between the couches. Selemei sat, arranged her silk skirts, and fell into anticipating potential moves for the long-haired warriors wrought in gold, who brandished antique weapons upon their posts at the grid intersections.\n Xeref turned the marble board so she had the emerald-helmed warriors, and he the sapphire. He opened his hands to her. \u201cYou go first.\u201d\n She nodded. They played in silence, but when she executed her first entrapment, he glanced up at her.\n \u201cHave you always been this good at kuarjos? How is it we\u2019ve never played before?\u201d\n She shrugged. \u201cI played with Tamelera.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cXeref, about\u2014what we talked about\u2014are you sure you won\u2019t, or we won\u2019t . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cWe won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d\n \u201cBut what should I tell people, when they ask?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ll ask?\u201d He sighed. \u201cOf course they\u2019ll ask. Say we\u2019ve decided not to.\u201d\n She raised eyebrows at him. \u201cThey\u2019ll blame me. And think I\u2019ve insulted you. And that I\u2019ve lost my mind.\u201d\n \u201cThen say it\u2019s just not working.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ll think I\u2019m sick. The Family Council would investigate.\u201d\n \u201cThen say it\u2019s my fault.\u201d He frowned, shaking his head. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve rejected you, but that my health is to blame.\u201d\n \u201cYour health . . . you mean put your cabinet position at risk?\u201d\n At that moment, a wysp entered through the stone arches of the ceiling: a tiny golden spark of light that spiraled down between them, casting a burst of warrior-shadows, then disappearing through the marble game board and table and into the floor.\n \u201cWysps are good luck,\u201d Xeref said. \u201cMaybe no one will ask you.\u201d\n Selemei sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s play.\u201d\n Nobody could be that lucky.\n Selemei put her hands on her hips, feeling uncomfortably like her own mother. Before her on the bed, Pelli frowned stubbornly down at her own small, nightgown-clad body\u2014a too-familiar defiance.\n \u201cNap first, big girl,\u201d Selemei said. \u201cYour cousin\u2019s party doesn\u2019t even start for hours.\u201d\n \u201cMama party.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not going. Your father will take you, with Corrim and Aven.\u201d Staying home was the only way to be safe from questions, though writing letters while her entire family helped celebrate a cousin\u2019s confirmation seemed\u2014gnash it!\u2014well, unfair. She blew out a breath.\n Pelli scowled.\n Selemei sat beside her. \u201cI love you, Pelli. I promise you can go out, just lie down a bit first.\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me, Mistress?\u201d Pelli\u2019s Verrid said softly.\n She waved him off. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. Please, take a break, Verrid.\u201d The Imbati bowed stiffly and withdrew through a door hidden behind a curtain. Her Grivi remained. When Selemei turned back to Pelli, her daughter\u2019s lip was trembling dangerously. \u201cPelli, it\u2019s all right, come here, I love you.\u201d She held the girl\u2019s head against her shoulder and rocked her. \u201cTime for sleeping, just a bit of sleeping, nothing to do now, nothing, nothing, Mama\u2019s doing nothing, not going anywhere, nap time for Pelli, Mama loves her Pelli.\u201d She leaned over to deposit Pelli into bed, but Pelli clung, and Selemei had to catch herself with her elbow before she squished her accidentally. \u201cLet go, big girl.\u201d\n Pelli squirmed and whined.\n \u201cHere, I\u2019ll lie down with you.\u201d It was difficult, because Pelli still wouldn\u2019t let go, and her left hip twinged as she shifted to straighten it, and her gown hitched up above her knees. She grunted, but she\u2019d often told Grivi she\u2019d rather manage such awkwardness without his help, at least when she was alone. \u201cThere.\u201d She kissed Pelli\u2019s warm cheek. \u201cSleepy Mama, sleepy Pelli.\u201d\n Pelli sat up.\n Selemei tightened her arm across her daughter\u2019s lap. \u201cLie down, Pelli.\u201d\n \u201cPelli party!\u201d\n Gnash it! \u201cYou won\u2019t go to the party at all, if you don\u2019t sleep.\u201d Looking up at her from an awkward position on the bed did not convey authority, and her leg was aching, and she didn\u2019t want help. \u201cPelli, you will lie down right now because I told you so.\u201d\n \u201cNo!\u201d\n \u201cYou are a little girl, and little girls do as they\u2019re told.\u201d\n \u201cNooo!\u201d\n \u201cGnash it, I\u2019m your mother and I know what\u2019s best for you. If you don\u2019t think of your health, you\u2019ll ruin your value to the Race!\u201d\n Pelli started bawling.\n \u201cLie down!\u201d Selemei heaved up on one elbow and pulled her down. Pelli thrashed. Her head hit Selemei in the cheekbone; her knee jabbed her in the stomach. Gnash it, gnash it . . . Grunting, Selemei struggled to grab the flailing limbs. Finally she managed to pin part of the bedsheet under her own body and wrap the rest of it over Pelli, to catch the hand that was hitting her in the head and tuck it under, to pin the sheet down with one hand on Pelli\u2019s other side. Pelli roared with rage. Panting, Selemei held her there until fatigue drained the note of anger from Pelli\u2019s cries, and she hiccupped to a stop.\n Hitching breaths. But, finally, sleeping breaths.\n Selemei carefully let go, even more carefully pulled her arm back.\n Oww . . .\n She collapsed facedown on the bed. Breathed, hard, aching everywhere. Her left leg twitched and twinged.\n Why did I do that? I wasn\u2019t going to do that again. Not to Pelli. I should have let Verrid handle this, even if it was Imbati coddling.\n She turned her head and touched her lips to Pelli\u2019s wet cheek; a hint of salt crept between them.\n She\u2019s too much like me.\n Selemei sighed her head back down on the bed, and closed her eyes. It was easier just to lie here, not to try to move, just to imagine herself sinking through the mattress toward the stone floor.\n Curtains rustled, and a quiet change came to the air of the bedroom. A servant coming in, maybe Pelli\u2019s Verrid. A long silence pulled Selemei toward sleep.\n Grivi whispered tensely, \u201cWe don\u2019t need your interference.\u201d\n Another long silence followed, but Selemei was fully awake now.\n Grivi whispered again. \u201cGentlemen\u2019s servants should stick to politics. They always think everything is their business. I\u2019m charged to safeguard her health.\u201d\n And a higher voice answered. \u201cBut her health is politics. You know that.\u201d\n Ustin\u2019s voice? What was Ustin doing here without Xeref? She shouldn\u2019t let them talk about her in her presence, but she\u2019d never heard servants speak like this, and it was so hard to move. To interrupt Grivi in the midst of more emotion than she\u2019d ever heard an Imbati express aloud? It seemed cruel.\n \u201cI took the Mark in her name,\u201d Grivi said. \u201cMy vow of service binds us two, alone. Will you compromise that with your selfishness?\u201d\n \u201cSuch a question,\u201d Ustin said, her voice level, disapproving. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cYou may be excused, Ustin,\u201d said Grivi.\n A swish of curtains suggested Ustin was making a swift departure. Selemei carefully waited more than a minute, then shifted her head, and moaned as if she\u2019d just awakened.\n \u201cGrivi . . . ?\u201d\n He helped her to turn over. She sneaked a glance at his face, his broad forehead illustrated with the manservant\u2019s lily crestmark, but he wore the same patient, agreeable expression as always.\n It felt dishonest not to mention what she\u2019d overheard. But she\u2019d bumped up against Imbati secrets before, and heard that very same toneless I don\u2019t know\u2014if she brought it up, she\u2019d only mortify him to no purpose. Guilty, she lay on her back and stared at the ceiling vaults, with Pelli\u2019s head tucked underneath her right arm. In her sleep, Pelli turned, and her face pressed into the side of Selemei\u2019s breast. Selemei fell into a doze, but woke again when a small warm hand found its sleepy way onto her belly. She patted it gently.\n \u201cMama,\u201d Pelli murmured.\n \u201cSweet Pelli. I\u2019m glad you had a sleep.\u201d\n Pelli wriggled herself into a ball, bottom in the air, then lifted her head and placed it beside her hand so all Selemei could see was the fuzz of orange hair. Maybe she could hear tummy gurgles in there.\n \u201cAm I your pillow, big girl?\u201d Selemei asked.\n \u201cBaby tummy,\u201d said Pelli.\n \u201cYes, you were in there once.\u201d\n \u201cPelli sissy?\u201d Pelli turned her head, pale eyes wide. \u201cBaby more?\u201d\n Hurt, incredulity, indignation, flashed her skin hot. But it wasn\u2019t Pelli\u2019s fault. \u201cNo, no babies in there,\u201d Selemei answered. Slowly, she sat up and gathered Pelli onto her lap. \u201cNow, how about we get dressed and go to your cousin\u2019s party?\u201d\n \u201cMama party!\u201d\n \u201cYes, I think we should all go together.\u201d\n No place was safe from questions.\n Even with the help of their Imbati, they were not among the first to arrive. The noise of chattering guests already filtered through their host\u2019s velvet curtains into the vestibule, where the First Houseman greeted them. No sooner had their arrival been announced when the six-year-old guest of honor burst through the curtain and barreled into Aven, Corrim, and Pelli, shouting,\n \u201cI\u2019m real! I\u2019m real I\u2019m real I\u2019m real!\u201d\n Selemei caught Aven with one hand before she could be entirely bowled over; with the other, she gripped tightly onto Imbati Grivi\u2019s supporting arm. \u201cGently, Pyaras.\u201d\n \u201cOf course you\u2019re real, young Pyaras,\u201d Xeref chuckled, and ruffled the little boy\u2019s dark hair. \u201cCongratulations on your birthday.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m real!\u201d Pyaras\u2019 waving arm had an odd smudge of red on it.\n \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d asked Aven. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your arm? Blood?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not going to DIE like my mother!\u201d Pyaras crowed. \u201cI\u2019ve been STAMPED! I\u2019m real!\u201d\n \u201cPyaras, will you cut it out!\u201d said Corrim, trying to avoid being pummeled.\n Pelli jumped up and down and joined in the shouting. \u201cReal! Real! Real!\u201d\n \u201cGo play,\u201d said Selemei, and gave them a shove as the First Houseman pulled the curtain aside. \u201cCorrim, if you want quiet, look for Tagaret and your older cousins in the private areas of the suite.\u201d Pyaras and Pelli ran off together hand in hand; Corrim and Aven more slowly followed.\n Selemei shot a glance of sympathy at Administrator Vull, Pyaras\u2019 father, who stood waiting to greet them. \u201cSorry about that,\u201d Vull said, flushed in embarrassment. \u201cOur doctor has a sense of humor\u2014she stamped Pyaras as well as the confirmation papers.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re just so glad to see him happy,\u201d Selemei replied soothingly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we missed the big announcement.\u201d\n \u201cThe Pelismara Society welcomes him,\u201d said Xeref. \u201cThe Race will benefit greatly from his life and health.\u201d\n Vull\u2019s face stilled a moment. He and his partner Lady Indelis had been seen as one of the Race\u2019s great hopes until her death three years ago. Selemei sent thanks to Mother Elinda for placing her soul among the stars.\n \u201cCome, Vull,\u201d said Xeref. \u201cLet\u2019s go further in\u2014I see some people I\u2019d like to talk to.\u201d\n Selemei squeezed her Grivi\u2019s hand in preparation to walk in, but he rumbled, \u201cMistress, the public rooms are too crowded; visiting members of the Household have been invited into the servants\u2019 Maze.\u201d\n She held tighter. \u201cNot yet, Grivi, please. Help me to where I can sit.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d\n She could have walked the distance by herself, probably. But navigating among gentlemen, fast-moving children, and the wide skirts of ladies was much easier with Grivi\u2019s support. He settled her into a spot on one of the sitting room\u2019s purple couches, then withdrew behind a nearby curtain. He\u2019d hear her through the service speakers if she called.\n Half a breath later, a rustle of young ladies found her.\n \u201cSelemei, it\u2019s been too long!\u201d That was Lady Keir, who had often joined her for a game of cards with Tamelera. Her golden skin was flushed, and her dark eyes a little too bright, though Selemei had never known her to drink. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d she leaned forward confidentially, braids swinging around her face, \u201c\u2014well? I mean, any news?\u201d\n Selemei reached a hand toward her, and pretended the question was only an idle inquiry about her well-being. \u201cNo particular news, Keir. I\u2019m quite well. And you?\u201d\n Keir giggled. \u201cI\u2019m well, I\u2019m well. Such an auspicious day, you know, I wouldn\u2019t have missed it . . . \u201d Suddenly she seized Selemei\u2019s hand, looking furtively around the room. \u201cYou must help me, I haven\u2019t yet managed to get pregnant\u2014Erex is very patient about it, but I\u2019m dying to, oh, just looking at the darling children, it makes me so jealous\u2014\u201d\n \u201cMay Elinda bless you, dear,\u201d Selemei said. \u201cAnd may Heile keep you in health.\u201d\n \u201cBy the way, I suppose you\u2019ve met my friends? They would love to have your blessing, too.\u201d\n Selemei did know the friends, who were only new to Keir because she\u2019d partnered late, and moved from Third Family to First just this year. She squeezed all their hands and blessed them, though it hurt her heart. Keir was the oldest of the four, at twenty, and the only one without a history of pregnancy. None had yet borne a confirmed child.\n \u201cI can\u2019t believe this party,\u201d one them muttered. \u201cPyaras is six! He\u2019s been healthy as an Arissen since the day he was born. It\u2019s showing off, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n Selemei looked over too late to see who had spoken, but she wasn\u2019t about to allow the guest of honor to be impugned by comparison to a Lower. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Cousins, they had this party all planned three years ago?\u201d she said. \u201cWhen Lady Indelis miscarried?\u201d\n Her words created an instant of excruciating silence. Everyone knew how that had ended.\n \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Lady Keir announced suddenly. \u201cAnyone want some of those delicious mushroom tarts?\u201d She walked away quickly, the others fluttering and murmuring behind her.\n Selemei sighed. Her temper wasn\u2019t steady today; maybe she should have stayed home. She stared at the purple piping at the edge of the couch, avoiding people\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cSelemei? My love?\u201d A warm touch on her shoulder.\n \u201cXeref!\u201d She took the hand he offered, and stood with relief. \u201cAre we leaving?\u201d\n Xeref frowned. \u201cSo soon? I wasn\u2019t thinking to, I admit, but I couldn\u2019t leave you looking so troubled.\u201d His face was rueful. \u201cWalk with me? I\u2019ve been speaking with the First Family Council.\u201d\n \u201cAll right\u2014let\u2019s not hurry.\u201d\n She felt quite steady on his arm, walking through the cast bronze door into the dining room. Most of the men had gathered here, standing about in jewel-colored velvet suits and raising celebratory glasses of sparkling yezel. She only recognized three. Their host, Vull, wore aquamarine, while Xeref\u2019s colleague from the cabinet, Fedron, wore emerald. The third man she recognized was Erex, Lady Keir\u2019s partner, who wore topaz. He had pale skin and clubbed fingertips, and kept his Imbati woman near him even when all the others had stepped out.\n \u201cErex was just telling me he\u2019s been promoted,\u201d Xeref told her. \u201cArbiter of the First Family Council.\u201d\n \u201cCongratulations,\u201d said Selemei.\n Erex bowed graciously. \u201cA pleasure to see you, Lady. In fact, you are a paragon among us. All honor to your gifts to the Race.\u201d\n \u201cGood to see you, Erex,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe the Arbiter position will benefit greatly from your kindness. You\u2019re welcome to seek out my children anytime to see how they are doing.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s not forget your organizational skills,\u201d added Xeref. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy responsibility to monitor the health and continuance of the First Family. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well.\u201d\n \u201cTo all our benefit,\u201d Selemei agreed. \u201cIs it too early to ask you, Arbiter, how you assess the prospects of the First Family\u2019s next generation?\u201d\n Erex smiled. \u201cAh, in fact, not too early at all. I confirmed a new partnership arrangement just this morning. In fact, it\u2019s doing quite well.\u201d He blushed. \u201cWe\u2019re all giving it our best efforts, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n Today, in this home, the platitude was insulting. \u201cIndeed we are,\u201d she said. \u201cThough some of us are giving our efforts, while others are giving up our health, and others, like Lady Indelis, have given their lives.\u201d\n Vull looked stricken; Erex laid one hand on his chest, and Fedron exclaimed, \u201cLady!\u201d\n \u201cAm I wrong?\u201d she demanded. \u201cFor the good of a boy like Pyaras, at least, I imagine you could think of some way to protect our mothers better. Aren\u2019t you all men of importance?\u201d\n \u201cLady, you have no idea how\u2014\u201d Fedron began, but Xeref grabbed his arm.\n \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Selemei. She turned away too quickly, and her left leg twinged. She shifted to her right. She stepped again, and the leg didn\u2019t buckle, but suddenly she was wobbling and couldn\u2019t seem to correct it. Worse, by now she was out the door where the only things to grab onto were random party guests. She hopped onto her right foot and managed to stop in an utterly undignified manner.\n Out of nowhere a pair of hands steadied her\u2014strong wiry hands, attached to arms in pale gray sleeves. A pale gray coat marked the Kartunnen caste. Selemei looked up and found she\u2019d been rescued by the confirming doctor. The tall woman had painted her face, as only the Kartunnen did: she had black lines on her eyelids and light green on her lower lip. Her coat flared to her knees, and was finely embroidered with designs in the same light gray.\n \u201cThank you, Kartunnen,\u201d Selemei said.\n \u201cPlease excuse my imposition, Lady.\u201d But the Kartunnen didn\u2019t immediately let go.\n \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Selemei insisted. \u201cI can stand.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Lady.\u201d The doctor folded her arms, tapped her fingers, took a breath as if to speak, but let it out silently.\n \u201cThank you for being here,\u201d Selemei said. \u201cYou made Pyaras very happy with that stamp.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s worth the trip, Lady,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cI\u2019d take six of him over anyone else here.\u201d Her half-green smile pulled sideways. \u201cExcept maybe that poor desperate girl.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cNothing really. If you\u2019ll permit, Lady, I\u2019d prefer to talk about you. Have you had therapy for that leg?\u201d\n She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Kartunnen\u2019s specialized education made them audacious. \u201cOf course,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy Grivi and I worked on it. He helped me immensely.\u201d\n The doctor nodded. \u201cI believe you should consider finding a proper Kartunnen therapist. With respect, women\u2019s Imbati receive quality medical training, but sometimes they can be . . . too close to you, to see things clearly.\u201d\n How should she respond to that? Was that presumption? For a doctor to speak that way of a Higher like Grivi? But what if she was right?\n \u201cHow long has it been since your injury?\u201d the doctor asked.\n \u201cTwo years.\u201d\n The doctor lowered her voice. \u201cPardon, but if it were me, I\u2019d try not to get pregnant until I\u2019d had it looked at.\u201d\n Now, that was most definitely presumption. \u201cOh, it\u2019s that simple, then, is it?\u201d Selemei snapped.\n People in the crowd around them turned to look. The doctor bowed formally, and spoke toward the floor. \u201cMy sincere apologies, Lady.\u201d\n The urge to have her thrown out lasted only a split second, replaced by perverse curiosity. This doctor could answer questions. Selemei gathered her composure and smiled, her heart pounding.\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s all right, of course, doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cNo trouble at all.\u201d\n Deliberately, Selemei looked away toward a wysp that had drifted in. The bright spark was no larger than her smallest fingernail, and moved aimlessly, caught in the wake of one person\u2019s movement, then another\u2019s, casting twinkles through the gathering. Younger children pointed and grinned at it, while the older ones mimicked the adults\u2019 casual ignorance. Selemei waited until nearby conversations gradually resumed. The doctor still watched her warily, and threaded a strand of red hair back behind one ear. When it seemed safe enough, Selemei stepped closer.\n \u201cDoctor,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIs it that simple? For\u2014\u201d she almost said for Lowers, but stopped herself. \u201cFor someone like you?\u201d\n The doctor gritted her teeth. \u201cWill you have me punished, Lady?\u201d\n \u201cCertainly not. May Mai strike me.\u201d\n \u201cThere are many ways, but here are three,\u201d the doctor said, and counted on her long fingers. \u201cOne, exemerin. Two, ambnil. Three, swear off men.\u201d Her eyes flitted briefly across the crowd, and she smirked. \u201cEasier for some than for others.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Kartunnen.\u201d\n \u201cEveryone!\u201d a voice shouted. A series of quick claps cut through the murmur of conversations. \u201cEveryone, we have an announcement!\u201d\n Selemei turned. The men from the dining room were emerging, Vull and Xeref in the lead.\n \u201cI\u2019d like to thank Vull for hosting us on such an auspicious occasion,\u201d Xeref said. \u201cA healthy boy joins us in the Pelismara Society with his proud father looking on. But in my heart, I can\u2019t help but wonder, and perhaps you have, too, my cousins\u2014how much more auspicious would this day be if Lady Indelis could be here?\u201d\n A sigh swayed the crowd; Vull nodded, pressing a fist over his mouth.\n \u201cToo many mothers give their lives in the name of the Race,\u201d said Xeref. \u201cThe First Family could grow stronger and happier if they were still with us. That\u2019s why Fedron and I will be bringing a new proposal to the Eminence, in the name of Lady Indelis. Our proposal will allow women whose lives have been endangered in childbirth to retire from their duties to the Race and dedicate themselves to the upbringing of their families. We appreciate your support.\u201d\n The crowd broke into murmurs\u2014some shocked, but it seemed, some approving.\n Xeref made his way to her side and took her arm. \u201cAre you ready to go home, my love?\u201d\n \u201cYes, please!\u201d Just look at the childlike mischief in his eyes . . . She managed to suppress a grin, but couldn\u2019t help glancing at him, over and over. When they passed the wysp on their way into the private rooms to gather children and servants, it seemed similarly attracted by his energy; it swirled around and through his coattails, not drifting off until they\u2019d left the party and started down the hall toward home. As soon as no one was looking, Selemei\u2019s grin escaped to her face.\n Me, legally retired? Ah, Xeref!\n Of course, it was always challenging to get the children settled after the excitement of a party. Selemei kissed Corrim goodnight, fingering a lock of his hair. Now that he was eleven, he professed himself too old for such intimacies, but she\u2019d get away with it as long as she was able. Such soft, soft curls\u2014the perfect cross between Xeref\u2019s straight hair and her own.\n \u201cMother?\u201d Corrim turned his head, pulling the curl from her grasp. \u201cHas Father made a lot of laws?\u201d\n She frowned. \u201cI think so.\u201d\n \u201cWhich ones?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s participated in votes for all of them. I\u2019m not sure how many times he\u2019s proposed his own; you should ask him.\u201d\n \u201cDo you think the Eminence Indal will like this new one?\u201d\n She should have known he\u2019d hear; rumors were as swift and unquenchable as wysp-fire. \u201cI hope so.\u201d\n \u201cWhen is Brinx coming home?\u201d\n Selemei glanced to the other brass-framed bed, which the Household had perfectly arranged with sheets turned back for whenever her eldest returned from his evening with friends. \u201cLate, sweet boy. Please don\u2019t wait up.\u201d\n Corrim grunted, but when she leaned down to him, accepted a kiss.\n \u201cMistress?\u201d came a disembodied voice from behind the servants\u2019 curtain. \u201cPlease, Mistress, if you would attend your daughter?\u201d\n Oh, no. I could have sworn Pelli was sleeping like a stone . . . \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d\n Selemei walked on her Grivi\u2019s arm into the hallway, and together they hurried to the girls\u2019 room. He pulled open the heavy bronze door for her.\n Mercy . . .\n Pelli was sleeping like a stone, arms and legs flung wide, her covers tossed off and her pillow on the floor. The muffled sobs came from the other bed.\n \u201cAven?\u201d Selemei whispered.\n Aven sat bolt upright, still sobbing, and reached for her with both hands. Selemei limped to her bed and sat down. Aven\u2019s hands clutched hard enough to hurt, and she wormed into Selemei\u2019s lap.\n \u201cAven, my sweet Aven, what in the name of mercy?\u201d Selemei murmured, stroking her back. \u201cI\u2019m here, everything\u2019s all right, I promise. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n Aven sobbed something into her shoulder.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \u201cMama, you almost died!\u201d\n Mercy, indeed. She\u2019s so smart. For a second, it hurt to swallow. \u201cMy darling,\u201d she managed, \u201cthat was about Lady Indelis.\u201d\n Aven pulled back and scowled, sobs turned to outrage. \u201cNo it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cAll right, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right.\u201d She found Aven\u2019s hands and gave them a tug. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t die. By Elinda\u2019s forbearance I\u2019m here now, sweet one, and I love you.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d Aven\u2019s arms lifted from her waist to drape over her shoulders, and the girl nuzzled into the crook of her neck. \u201cWhy do we have the decline anyway, when Lowers don\u2019t?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, love.\u201d Every parent faced this moment. Somehow it never got any easier, even after going through it with each of her older children. \u201cI guess, we have to remember that each of us has our time. We can take good care of ourselves, but we don\u2019t get to choose. Some people are never born. Some are never confirmed, and live hidden. Some are here one day and gone the next. My mother used to tell me that Mother Elinda loves the Race the most of all the people of Varin, and puts us in special constellations.\u201d\n \u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d Even her daughter\u2019s voice was frowning. \u201cMother Elinda puts souls into us, she doesn\u2019t just take them out. If she really loved us, she\u2019d give us babies to end the decline, not kill us.\u201d\n \u201cSweet one\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnd how do we know the people who die are in the sky, anyway? It\u2019s the sky.\u201d She waved an arm toward the vaulted stone ceiling.\n Selemei could feel all four levels of city and rock above. Only travelers, Venorai farmers, and Arissen firefighters ever saw the sky; it was a long way up to the gods her mother had wanted her to believe in.\n \u201cI suppose we don\u2019t know,\u201d she sighed. \u201cBut we do have Imbati and Kartunnen who care for our health. And if your father passes his law, then fewer of us will die.\u201d\n Aven shook her head. \u201cMama . . . \u201d\n \u201cPlease, darling, don\u2019t worry. Come here.\u201d She pulled Aven in again, and leaned against her springy hair. Across the room, Pelli sneezed in her sleep and turned over, apparently unaware. Could they be saved? And what about her firstborn daughter, Enzyel, whose trials were already beginning?\n A click came from the door latch; Selemei looked up. This was Xeref, sticking his head in. What did he want? She raised eyebrows at him.\n Xeref didn\u2019t call for her, but came in and sat with them on the bed. She had no idea what he intended until he wrapped his arms around them both. After a moment\u2019s surprise, she relaxed into his shoulder. Aven, too, seemed comforted.\n When at last Aven began to nod off, Selemei nudged Xeref until he stood, then returned her daughter\u2019s head to the pillow and tucked her in.\n Xeref offered her a hand up. She took his arm, and walked with him slowly out the door.\n In the hall, the light of the sconce fell across his features. Untouched by Aven\u2019s fear of death, he looked quite as delighted as he had at the party this afternoon. Her own excitement welled up again. She seized his hands between hers.\n \u201cXeref, thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat this means to me\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d She pressed his hands to her heart, and then to her lips. They unfolded warm and soft to cup her cheeks.\n Xeref bent close to her. \u201cI had to do it.\u201d\n She turned her face up and kissed him. How could she not? His lips were so sweet, and it had been so long! His mouth opened into a whole world where they existed only for each other. She tried to put her body and soul into that sacred place, and only when she gulped a breath did she realize she was already undressing him in her mind, while he pressed against her, eager and proud with the desire that had never dimmed.\n The desire that could kill her if it were fully satisfied.\n She pushed him away, gasping.\n \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cGo away,\u201d she cried. \u201cBy Sirin and Eyn, please!\u201d\n His face full of pain, Xeref staggered away and vanished into the master bedroom.\n All the inner parts of her tugged after him, but Selemei did not follow.\n Naturally, rumors about Xeref\u2019s proposal were everywhere. Selemei had discovered a new talent: extinguishing conversations faster than atmospheric lamps at nightfall. No question in her mind what the talk was about. However, she\u2019d prefer to know how far the information had changed, and how those changes might reflect on the First Family.\n There was only one possible course of action.\n Any lady of intelligence developed tools for unlocking the truth. Today was a day to employ her favorites: soothe the spirit with tea, amuse the tongue with cakes, and tease the honesty out. The Household had already completed arrangements in the sitting room: white silk cloth over the slate-topped table, silver spoons, teacups of silver-rimmed glass. Considering the delicacy of the topic, Selemei had chosen to invite only one friend from the Ninth Family and one from the Eleventh, both Family allies. Now all she needed\u2014\n \u201cExcuse the interruption, Mistress,\u201d the First Houseman said, stepping from behind his curtain, \u201cBut your cousin, the Lady Keir, wishes to speak with you.\u201d\n \u201cNow?\u201d Selemei pressed a knuckle to her lips. Should I turn her away? Or let her see preparations meant for others? \u201cI\u2019ll come to her,\u201d she decided.\n On Grivi\u2019s arm, she walked to the vestibule where she ducked around the edge of the velvet curtain. Keir stood waiting, twisting her golden hands even more tightly than the twists her Imbati woman had made in her hair.\n \u201cCousin?\u201d said Selemei. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n \u201cIs it really true?\u201d Keir asked. \u201cAbout what Xeref is planning?\u201d\n What had she heard? One hour later, it might have been easier to answer. \u201cOnly what he announced at Pyaras\u2019 party.\u201d\n \u201cBut that\u2019s awful.\u201d\n \u201cAwful? What do you mean?\u201d\n Keir wrung her hands. \u201cWell, do you think it\u2019s fair? That we have to almost die before we can get out of it? And what does that even mean, \u2018almost\u2019?\u201d\n What? Get out of it before you\u2019ve even started? Shock stole her ability to speak the words. A good thing, too, because behind that automatic protest loomed an intimate recognition as terrifying as a glimpse of sunlight. Selemei swallowed hard.\n \u201cOh, Keir\u2014cousin.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cHow difficult it must have been to come to me with your thoughts. Thank you for trusting me.\u201d She opened her arms, and Keir embraced her. Selemei resisted the urge to stroke her like a child. \u201cI know how difficult this is. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019ve heard out there.\u201d\n Keir sighed, but unfortunately, didn\u2019t give any hint of what she\u2019d heard.\n Selemei drew another steadying breath. \u201cSo, I\u2019m thinking\u2014today, in a few minutes, I\u2019ll be speaking with some friends about this. If you\u2019ve no prior commitments, then perhaps you would like to join us?\u201d\n \u201cOh!\u201d Keir pulled back, dabbing her cheeks with her fingers. \u201cI\u2019d love to! Which friends? Do I look like I\u2019ve been crying?\u201d\n \u201cNo, please, don\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019m expecting Lady Ryoe of the Ninth Family\u2014she\u2019s always been a great comfort to me during my recoveries\u2014and you know Lady Lienne of the Eleventh Family from our games of dareli.\u201d\n \u201cDoes Lady Ryoe play?\u201d Keir asked. \u201cSince we\u2019re missing a fourth?\u201d\n \u201cWell, not today, all right? You may freshen up in my rooms as you like. The others will be here in a moment.\u201d\n Keir bustled off at once, but her long-haired manservant stayed behind.\n \u201cImbati?\u201d\n \u201cYour pardon, Lady,\u201d the Imbati curtsied, inclining her tattooed forehead. \u201cYour generosity in this invitation is much appreciated, but I must express concern.\u201d\n \u201cAbout Keir?\u201d\n She leaned her head to one side. \u201cMy Mistress decided to visit you because she is deeply moved by this topic. I fear that in conversation she may become . . . impassioned, even in the presence of outsiders.\u201d\n And possibly risk Family secrets. Selemei nodded. \u201cI understand. I\u2019m already planning to tread carefully. I\u2019ll protect her, I promise.\u201d The servant bowed and followed her Mistress deeper into the suite.\n Selemei sent her Grivi to the dining room to speak with the Household Keeper about how to accommodate an additional guest. He\u2019d only just stepped away when the doorbell rang again. The First Houseman emerged from the vestibule, seeming perturbed to find her unattended.\n \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cMistress, your other guests have arrived, but they\u2019ve brought a companion. Lady Teifi of the Second Family.\u201d\n Selemei frowned. This could not be coincidence, and it would be rude to confront the motive of an unexpected guest. If she pushed ahead in her own inquiries, was rockfall inevitable? To protect Keir, should she give up on her questions altogether?\n \u201cThey are all welcome,\u201d she said. She took a deep breath, weighing the words \u201ctell,\u201d \u201cinform,\u201d and \u201calert\u201d for how far to mobilize the Household. Best to be cautious. \u201cPlease alert the Household to the change of plan.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d\n Grivi returned swiftly, apologizing for his absence at a critical moment; Selemei reassured him and allowed him to escort her to her seat. She kept sharp eyes on her guests as they entered. Lady Ryoe wore a smile that sparkled like the ruby pins in her sandstone hair; she came close for a kiss on the cheek before she sat down in the chair at Selemei\u2019s left hand. Lady Lienne\u2019s walk was tight; so also her mouth, and her gray sheath gown; she whispered close to Selemei\u2019s ear.\n \u201cMy sister insisted.\u201d\n Selemei looked past her shoulder to Lady Teifi, who was taking a seat on the facing couch. She and Lienne did resemble each other, though Teifi\u2019s long straight hair was sifted gray instead of pure black. Selemei kissed Lienne\u2019s cheek.\n \u201cYou\u2019re both welcome. Please, have a seat. Our Household Keeper will be pleased to know that her tea cakes are held in such high regard.\u201d\n Under the watchful gaze of her younger sister, Teifi returned the smile, but the faint blue tinge of her lips matched a chill in her eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have missed them.\u201d\n Keir entered then, through the double doors from the back of the suite. She hesitated a moment at the sight of Lady Teifi, but there was only one chair left, at Selemei\u2019s right. She took it, flashing a nervous smile. \u201cI\u2019m Selemei\u2019s cousin, Keir. Had you already started talking about it?\u201d\n \u201cNot at all,\u201d Selemei said quickly. But when it came to proposing a less fraught topic of conversation, her mind whirled and came up blank.\n Fortunately\u2014showing impeccable timing\u2014the Household Keeper appeared in her black silk dress, carrying the cakes. Her presentation was never the same twice; today she brought a sculpture of a fountain, five crystal spouts rising to different heights from a slate basin below. Atop each spout balanced a glass bowl delicate as a bubble, and inside each bowl lay a pearl-white cake garnished with a single red marshberry. Selemei herself could not help joining in the general sigh of admiration. Tea-pouring and the passing of cake bowls extended her reprieve, while the conversation turned to sweets, art, sweets as art, and where to find the most skilled Keepers. Selemei pressed her fork into the pliant surface of her cake, dared a bite. But every pause clutched at her, begging to be filled with harmless normality.\n Here was a topic that might be harmless enough. \u201cBy the way, those are lovely hairpins you\u2019re wearing today, Ryoe.\u201d\n Ryoe chuckled, licking berry juice from her lips. Her pale hand fluttered up to her hair. \u201cRubies are the gem of this year, Selemei. We\u2019re all wearing them\u2014even you.\u201d\n \u201cMe?\u201d Her own dress was sapphire blue, but then she remembered the bracelet on her wrist. Lienne wore rubies on the neckline of her dress, Teifi wore them in a band down the center of her bodice, and Keir wore them in a spiral brooch at her shoulder. Selemei\u2019s confidence faltered.\n We\u2019re wearing blood. All of us.\n She tried to cover her consternation with a sip of tea, but too soon; it burned her lip. Nothing could be harmless when the truth hid everywhere. She set down the cup.\n \u201cAll right, I know what you\u2019re all here for. You want to know about Xeref\u2019s proposal, and I want to know what you\u2019ve heard, and how you are thinking about it.\u201d To protect Keir, she assumed her cousin\u2019s argument like a cloak: \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think it goes far enough.\u201d\n Keir sat straighter. \u201cYou don\u2019t? But I thought you said\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhat a thing to say!\u201d Teifi cried.\n Selemei smiled, carefully, and folded her hands on her lap so they wouldn\u2019t shake. She could handle this; it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d been the target of all eyes at once.\n \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say it,\u201d she replied. \u201cXeref wants to prevent deaths like that of Lady Indelis. He thought the best way would be to allow ladies who had come close to death to retire from their duties. His intent is not to hasten the decline, but to allow ladies to raise their own children\u2014and actually, also, to allow them more recovery time from birth injuries before they must consider pregnancy again.\u201d That was a good idea! Sometimes she surprised herself.\n \u201cBirth injuries.\u201d Lady Keir shuddered visibly. \u201cMercy of Heile.\u201d\n \u201cI understand your fear, Keir,\u201d Selemei said reassuringly. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to allow time for complete recovery. After all, a healthier mother will bear a healthier child.\u201d\n \u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d said Lady Ryoe. The reminder of blood glinted from her hair as she shook her head. \u201cI mean, retirement sounds good, but who\u2019s going to enforce it? We can\u2019t send Arissen guards into bedrooms.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Selemei admitted.\n \u201cThen\u2014forgive me\u2014who is going to tell our gentlemen no?\u201d\n Selemei winced. Her heart wanted to protest, but how recently had she tasted this fear, despite how deeply she trusted Xeref? She almost looked over her shoulder at Grivi. \u201cWell. We\u2019ll just have to think of something, I imagine. The wording of the proposal hasn\u2019t been finalized yet.\u201d\n \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Lienne muttered. \u201cLowers have children when they want to.\u201d\n \u201cLowers, ugh!\u201d Teifi grunted. \u201cThere are plenty of them.\u201d\n Lienne\u2019s pale cheeks flushed. \u201cHaving too many children is killing us, Teifi, and it still isn\u2019t stopping the decline. If we\u2019re all going to die anyway, do we have to be miserable while we\u2019re doing it?\u201d\n \u201cLienne,\u201d said Ryoe, \u201cI had no idea you were so upset. Is something wrong?\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is that you\u2019re even considering this nonsense,\u201d Teifi said. \u201cPolitics is gentlemen\u2019s business.\u201d\n \u201cBut this is about our lives,\u201d protested Keir.\n \u201cAnd it\u2019s our children who stand to lose their mothers,\u201d said Lienne.\n \u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Sister,\u201d Teifi hissed through her teeth. \u201cThat you\u2019d associate yourself with selfish cats who would turn their backs on the future of the Race!\u201d\n \u201cTeifi, stop!\u201d\n Selemei spoke measuredly into the shocked silence that followed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s selfish to try to understand the impact of the rules that gentlemen impose on our lives. The fact is, the proposal in its current form was my partner\u2019s idea, and it\u2019s uninformed in many ways, and incomplete. This is why it\u2019s so important for us to discuss it.\u201d\n \u201cThe Race requires a higher form of loyalty,\u201d Teifi said. \u201cThese are the burdens of power.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d Selemei asked, clamping down on a surge of anger and forcing a smile. \u201cAnd would you like to tell us about the number and health of your children, then? How your sacrifices have rewarded you with success?\u201d She\u2019d heard enough about her from conversations with Lienne and Tamelera to know that Teifi couldn\u2019t answer that.\n A muscle tightened in the older woman\u2019s jaw.\n Lienne threw a keen glance at her sister, and stood up. \u201cSelemei, I\u2019m so sorry, we\u2019d better go.\u201d\n She took a deep breath. \u201cDarling, what a shame.\u201d She squeezed Lienne\u2019s hand, trying to catch her eye. \u201cPlease let\u2019s talk another time.\u201d\n Lienne and Teifi\u2019s swift departure left the other guests in a fluster, and they soon excused themselves, also.\n \u201cIs there tea left?\u201d Selemei sighed.\n Imbati Grivi lifted the pot, nodded, and refreshed her now-cooled teacup. Selemei sighed, pressing its edge into her lower lip, inhaling the steam. In a way, the utter failure of her subtlety had taught her what was out there\u2014fear, despair, thirst, fury, and lots and lots of arguing. Keir had come out unscathed, at least.\n But her own satisfaction with Xeref\u2019s proposal had not. Teifi demonstrated that any legislation of this nature would be strongly resisted; and Ryoe was correct that gentlemen would seize upon any excuse to dismiss restrictions on their behavior, even if it passed.\n \u201cGrivi,\u201d she said, \u201chow soon can we be ready to go out?\u201d\n \u201cI know of nothing that would prevent us going now, Mistress.\u201d\n \u201cI need to discuss this with Xeref. Our proposal needs some revisions.\u201d\n Once she had given herself permission to go to Xeref\u2019s office\u2014this was official legislative business, after all\u2014her resolve outpaced her ability to walk there. Selemei left the suites wing and began to cross the central section, but her left hip twinged; she squeezed her Grivi\u2019s hand for a pause. By the tall bronze doors of the Hall of the Eminence, she cast an eye about, but saw only Imbati child messengers flitting through, and Arissen guards, powerful and still in their orange uniforms. No one to care if she shook her leg a bit.\n After a few seconds, she tested her weight on the foot. Workable. A bit more slowly, they crossed into the offices wing. Xeref\u2019s was the first door on the left.\n All five young men in the front office stopped what they were doing as she walked in. One of them was her son, Brinx. He sprang up from the steel desk he\u2019d been leaning on, and straightened the hem of his malachite-striped coat.\n \u201cMother? Holy Sirin\u2019s luck!\u201d he exclaimed, grinning. \u201cFedron sent me over here only ten minutes ago; we\u2019ve been going over the minutes of the last Cabinet meeting. If you\u2019d come five minutes earlier, I\u2019d have been busy; five minutes later, and I\u2019d have been back next door.\u201d He kissed her cheek. \u201cWould you like to come see where I work?\u201d\n Selemei smiled. As a child, Brinx had told stories to her for hours\u2014even conversed with the vaulted ceilings when no one else was available. These days, she was seldom the recipient of that bright attention.\n \u201cI\u2019d love to, treasure, but I\u2019ve come to see your father.\u201d\n Brinx pulled a sober face. \u201cOf course. Shall I take you in? I don\u2019t think he has another meeting for at least sixteen minutes.\u201d\n \u201cYes, please.\u201d\n Brinx resumed bubbling while she followed him to the inner door. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky that he\u2019s in there by himself right now. He\u2019s had all sorts of meetings today, and messengers\u2014we\u2019ve gotten five of them at least. Six, I think, actually. Yeah, six. It\u2019s because of the stir, of course. The one Father started when he announced his Indelis proposal. We\u2019ve never been so busy\u2014\u201d He pushed the door open a crack. \u201cSir? Father, Mother\u2019s here.\u201d\n \u201cSelemei? Come in, come in!\u201d Xeref came to her quickly; his blue eyes searched her with concern, but when she smiled at him, he brightened. She released Grivi\u2019s hand to take his.\n \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to talk to you about the proposal.\u201d\n \u201cI hope you\u2019re not worrying, Mother,\u201d said Brinx. \u201cOur conversations are going well.\u201d He raised one finger. \u201c\u2018Give them the respite, gentlemen. Think first of the health of your partner if you wish a healthy child, and the blood of the Race will grow stronger!\u2019\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t vote for another week or so,\u201d Xeref explained. \u201cThis is the part where we sound people out and argue for the idea. Our most powerful argument is exactly what Brinx says, and people are responding well to it. I\u2019m optimistic.\u201d\n Hearing her earlier thought put so differently made her doubt any of these gentlemen were serious about real retirement. \u201cHave you changed any part of the proposal?\u201d she asked. \u201cAdded anything?\u201d\n \u201cNo. Why do you ask?\u201d\n \u201cWell, have you talked with anyone about how to enforce it?\u201d\n \u201cMother, don\u2019t worry,\u201d said Brinx. \u201cKartunnen will do as they\u2019re told.\u201d\n Kartunnen? She flashed him a look. \u201cIt\u2019s not them I\u2019m worried about, Brinx, it\u2019s the gentlemen. No one will want to give up their chance to benefit the Race. They\u2019ll cling to excuses.\u201d The incredulity on his face forced her to search for examples that filled her with distaste. \u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t injured enough; or, no, we had a good doctor so she wasn\u2019t really in any danger.\u201d\n Brinx pursed his lips into the same wanting-to-protest moue that he always had as a child. She rolled her eyes and turned to her partner.\n \u201cYou know they will, Xeref.\u201d\n Xeref looked at her in silence for a moment. \u201cYes,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI imagine they will. Should we specify that the doctor must have assessed the risk of death at greater than fifty percent?\u201d\n She shuddered. \u201cDo Kartunnen do that? Isn\u2019t that . . . heartless of them?\u201d\n \u201cNot every time, I don\u2019t imagine.\u201d\n \u201cFifty percent seems low,\u201d put in Brinx. \u201cMaybe it should be sixty.\u201d\n \u201cBrinx,\u201d said Xeref, \u201cyou might want to think carefully before you say something like that. I wrote the proposal for your mother.\u201d\n \u201cWasn\u2019t it for Lady Indelis?\u201d Brinx exclaimed, but his face fell quickly from puzzlement to shock. \u201cOh. Mother, I\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea.\u201d\n Selemei found his hand and squeezed it. \u201cWell, you can see, can\u2019t you, why we can\u2019t have this be negotiable?\u201d\n \u201cI see what you\u2019re saying,\u201d said Brinx. \u201cThe problem is, negotiation is exactly what this part of the process is for.\u201d\n \u201cBut, treasure, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now. Negotiating it.\u201d Selemei turned back to Xeref. \u201cHow many men do you know who would be willing to bargain the continuation of their families against their partners\u2019 lives? How many are doing this already? Speaking over a doctor\u2019s word in the name of ending the decline?\u201d Xeref was too frustrating in his silence. \u201cXeref,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou know how easy it is to speak over a doctor\u2019s word. How dangerous it is.\u201d\n \u201cFather, did you\u2014\u201d Brinx began, but Xeref raised his hand and stopped him with a glance.\n \u201cSelemei, my jewel, you\u2019re right. But no one will agree to give up such power to Kartunnen.\u201d\n \u201cThe power doesn\u2019t need to be in the Kartunnen,\u201d she explained, carefully restraining her tone. \u201cNeither should it be; as Lowers, they lack final authority. Put this in the law itself. Make a list of risks, of injuries, and how serious they are. Take it out of everyone\u2019s hands, as if it were the will of Elinda.\u201d\n \u201cFather, you\u2019d still have to get the list from a Kartunnen,\u201d said Brinx.\n \u201cBrinx, I know how to get lists from Kartunnen,\u201d Xeref replied, and Brinx blushed. \u201cThank you, Selemei. I\u2019ll send my Ustin tomorrow morning.\u201d\n \u201cCome see my desk, Mother,\u201d said Brinx.\n \u201cI\u2019m not finished, though,\u201d Selemei said. \u201cThere\u2019s another problem. A more serious one. A more private one.\u201d\n \u201cWhich one?\u201d Xeref asked.\n She squirmed inside. Might this be easier to discuss if Brinx weren\u2019t here? Possibly, but saying \u2018rape\u2019 was awful, regardless. She dodged the word. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve talked about the will of Mother Elinda, but we haven\u2019t spoken about her partner.\u201d\n \u201cFather Varin?\u201d Brinx raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo you mean what punishment to levy for transgression? That\u2019s for the joint cabinet to decide.\u201d\n She sighed. \u201cBrinx, love, I\u2019ll lend you my copy of the Ancient Stories when your brother has finished reading it.\u201d Selemei opened her hands to Xeref, who was staring at her silently, with a wrinkle deepening over his nose. \u201cRemember, Father Varin gnashes the wicked in his fiery teeth in atonement for his own transgressions.\u201d Still, no recognition in Xeref\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe transgressions that led Mother Elinda to reject him.\u201d\n \u201cOh!\u201d Xeref cried suddenly. \u201cBut that\u2019s . . . oh, that\u2019s\u2014oh dear.\u201d\n \u201cFather, what?\u201d\n \u201cBut Selemei, would they really?\u201d\n What a question! She turned it around. \u201cPerhaps you mean to ask whether gentlemen would really be willing to sacrifice their desires for their partners\u2019 safety? Some would\u2014you would. But most gentlemen are not you. Must I speak with the ladies of the Pelismara Society to give you a number?\u201d\n Xeref ran one hand through his silver hair, uncomfortably.\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Brinx demanded.\n \u201cMaster,\u201d said Imbati Ustin. \u201cI can verify, by Imbati witness, three rapists among those First Family gentlemen known to me. If you wish it, I can investigate and expand my knowledge to assess the scope of the problem across the Pelismara Society. It could have a substantial impact on this proposal\u2019s implementation.\u201d\n In the Imbati\u2019s icy voice, it felt terrifyingly real. Selemei swore. \u201cName of Mai, who?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mistress, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Selemei gaped at her. For whom was she protecting that information? Would she tell Xeref if he asked?\n Brinx, who had been spluttering, found words. \u201cFather, you must reprimand your Ustin.\u201d\n \u201cYou think so?\u201d Xeref narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n \u201cAccusing her betters of such a thing! I can\u2019t think of anything more presumptuous.\u201d\n \u201cBrinx,\u201d Xeref said slowly, \u201cPlease think what you\u2019re saying. Ustin has worked as my personal and political assistant and bodyguard for twelve years. In all that time she has never failed to safeguard me or my information, nor have I caught her in any inaccuracy. Her qualities are guaranteed by the certification of the Imbati Service Academy, just as your servant\u2019s are. And this information is quite relevant to our success.\u201d\n Brinx flushed. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, Father. And I do really want to help you pass this proposal.\u201d\n \u201cIf this is uncomfortable for you, why don\u2019t you just let me talk with your mother? Fedron\u2019s got several people he\u2019s negotiating with, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d appreciate your help right now.\u201d\n \u201cYes, of course, Father. I\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d\n It was quite common for a room to feel silent after Brinx stepped out of it, but this silence was one Selemei hesitated to step into. Her mind whirled in horror and suspicion of the men she knew. Xeref stared into the distance, dismay written deep into the lines of his face.\n \u201cThis . . . \u201d He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n That was not what she\u2019d expected him to say. \u201cWhat don\u2019t you know?\u201d she asked. \u201cI had no idea this was such a huge problem. The question is, how do we address it?\u201d She looked to his Ustin for support, but Ustin didn\u2019t speak. The manservant\u2019s mark arched across her pale forehead like the bars of a closed gate.\n \u201cNo, Selemei,\u201d Xeref said. \u201cWe can\u2019t address it.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n He rubbed his forehead. \u201cThis is a legislative proposal, which will be discussed and voted on by the cabinet. We can\u2019t lose sight of that. Proposals with divided goals fail, even when their goals are entirely ordinary. And . . . I really don\u2019t want this one to fail.\u201d\n Oh, gods, if it failed! She gulped a breath. \u201cI need to sit down.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love,\u201d said Xeref. \u201cBy all means.\u201d\n Grivi was swift to deliver one of the metal chairs that faced Xeref\u2019s desk; Selemei sat with relief and tried to gather her thoughts. This proposal no longer felt like it was about her, but about Ryoe, Lienne, and Keir\u2014and about her own daughters. To fail would be a disaster. But what if they succeeded, and the law were meaningless to those who most needed it?\n \u201cLadies are vulnerable,\u201d she said quietly.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Xeref agreed. He took the other chair, which Ustin brought for him. \u201cAs Lady Indelis was vulnerable.\u201d\n \u201cOr as I was,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a medical center, helpless to the wishes of doctors and family.\u201d\n He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d she assured him. \u201cBut some ladies are also vulnerable at home. And we can\u2019t send Arissen into bedrooms to enforce this law.\u201d The very idea was appalling.\n \u201cImbati are already there,\u201d Xeref mused. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to put such power in the Imbati, either.\u201d\n She raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cDear, it\u2019s hardly a reasonable demand on them, even if we did.\u201d\n \u201cTrue.\u201d\n Selemei ran her eyes about the office as if the answer might be hiding here somewhere, hanging among Xeref\u2019s numerous certificates or tucked between the law books on his shelves.\n \u201cWait,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if we can\u2019t do anything about the gentlemen, this proposal aims to prevent dangerous pregnancies. So, what about the medicines?\u201d What had that Kartunnen mentioned at the party? Amb\u2014something . . .\n Xeref looked like she\u2019d stuck him with a pin. \u201cThose are illegal.\u201d\n \u201cSo? We\u2019re proposing a new law, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n \u201cA gentleman would never consent to compromise his fertility.\u201d\n \u201cI would, if it meant I were never put at risk again.\u201d\n He blinked at her. \u201cYou would?\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that what we already decided?\u201d\n Xeref didn\u2019t answer, but shook his head in consternation. Then, beside her left ear, Grivi rumbled in his throat.\n \u201cYes, Grivi?\u201d\n \u201cMistress, you should be aware that contraceptive medications, when properly used, have no permanent effect on fertility.\u201d\n \u201cWell. All right, then.\u201d\n \u201cEven for Grobal?\u201d Xeref asked.\n \u201cI know of no genetic contraindications, sir,\u201d said Grivi.\n \u201cI\u2019m just not sure anyone would agree to it. Could one really ask a man to waste his value to the Race?\u201d Xeref frowned at the floor, and began cracking his knuckles, one after the other.\n She realized, then. He was frightened. \u201cDear\u2014what if we tried it?\u201d\n He twitched, and shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting\u2014no. I could never ask my Ustin to procure something illegally.\u201d\n \u201cMaster,\u201d said Ustin, \u201cI can procure something for myself with perfect legality.\u201d\n That was it! Ustin was a woman, and would have done this before. Then all she\u2019d have to do was get her hands on it, and then . . .\n Selemei put her hand over Xeref\u2019s and squeezed. \u201cThink of it.\u201d\n The triangular white pill was small, almost indistinguishable from the marble of the bathroom counter. Selemei forced herself to see it, to confront it, to confront what she had to do. Grivi\u2019s unwillingness to aid her in any aspect of the medication only magnified her sense of transgression. After seven days, it had become no easier.\n I am not harming anyone. I\u2019m doing this for Enzyel, for Aven, for Pelli\u2014and for myself. The Kartunnen have deemed it safe. Imbati Ustin herself has used this. A Grobal is not so different from a Lower that it will affect me differently. It is not harming me.\n It is not harming me.\n She swept it up and swallowed it before she could lose her nerve.\n That was it.\n She chased it down with an extra glass of water just to be sure. Her body had been feeling a little different, but that could have been her mind\u2019s suggestion. Stripped of the magic that younger women had always begged her to imbue them with, she felt . . .\n Don\u2019t say hollow. I\u2019m more than that. I\u2019ve already contributed five healthy children to the Race.\n Her triumphs were written in her body, where no one could take them away. Pale ripples in the skin of her belly and hips proved she had received Elinda\u2019s gift, that she could grow like the moon to nurture souls. Her breasts had earned their delicious softness with each precious suckling touch.\n She raised her head and looked her reflection in the eye. And now you\u2019ve contributed to the content of a legislative proposal, so what do you think of that?\n A strange light crept over her face from beneath, turning its features unfamiliar. Selemei glanced down; a wysp had entered the room, and now turned circles beside her knee. She smiled at it.\n The wysp understood. But she was going to do this anyway.\n She raised both hands over her head, allowing Grivi to slip the sleeves of her silk robe over them. Then she closed the robe and took his hand to walk out to the bedroom where Xeref was waiting.\n Xeref pushed up on one elbow at the sight of her. His worry-wrinkles were deeper than usual\u2014he looked even more concerned than he had yesterday, if that was possible. She allowed Grivi to seat her on the edge of the bed; once Grivi vanished under his curtain, she took a deep breath.\n \u201cI\u2019m all right, Xeref,\u201d she said. And told her body silently, you are all right; show him. She pulled her legs up on the bed and beckoned. Xeref moved close to her side, and put his arm around her shoulders. His warmth, his stability, his soft silver hair faintly scented with perfume . . . simultaneous waves of nostalgia and longing crashed together inside her, brimming in her eyes and stealing her breath. She leaned into him.\n \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so,\u201d Xeref said.\n All she could manage was a nod.\n \u201cIt was harder to wait this time.\u201d\n Hardest to wait when that wait might never end. She nodded into the crook of his neck and shoulder. She could feel his soft-furred, warm skin against her side, against her breast. She reached for his arm and stroked it from elbow to fingers, found the outer edge of his hand and squeezed it as hard as she could.\n \u201cXeref, I didn\u2019t mean to push you away. I mean\u2014I didn\u2019t want you gone, I just was so scared to\u2014\u201d\n The words brought back the reality of what they were attempting. She jerked back and found him staring at her in dismay. So he\u2019d arrived at the very same thought. She blew out a breath between her lips. Carefully, carefully.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this for politics. I\u2014I\u2019m not doing this for politics.\u201d The words sounded false.\n Xeref seemed to crumple in on himself. \u201cNobody could possibly agree to this,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhy did I ever make you\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t make me; I convinced you. And Ustin helped me.\u201d\n He glanced toward the service curtain on his side of the bed, and heaved a sigh.\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t blame her,\u201d Selemei said.\n Xeref shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t, really. She does her job well. Too well, some might say.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an Imbati who serves too well.\u201d Selemei shrugged. \u201cThis is the only possible solution to our problem. And for her, this isn\u2019t political; it\u2019s normal.\u201d\n \u201cWe aren\u2019t like them,\u201d Xeref said sadly. \u201cFevers that kill Grobal scarcely touch them. Who\u2019s to say you haven\u2019t done something terrible with this medicine, and will never conceive a child again?\u201d\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to conceive a child again.\u201d\n \u201cHa!\u201d The laugh burst from him all at once, like a bark.\n Her face burned. \u201cXeref, I thought we agreed!\u201d\n \u201cNo, Sirin and Eyn, I\u2019m so sorry. We do; of course we do. It\u2019s just, hearing you say it . . . \u201d He rubbed his face with both hands. \u201cI wish there were a way for this to be normal for us.\u201d\n \u201cPassing the law would make it normal. Except we can\u2019t pass the law until we try this. It\u2019s normal for Lowers . . . \u201d A thought struck her suddenly. \u201cWhat if we were Lowers?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d\n Impetuously, she tossed her bathrobe back from her shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019re both naked. Who\u2019s to say we haven\u2019t just set our marks aside? We could be Arissen\u2014Residence guards, who\u2019ve shed their castemark color.\u201d\n He raised his eyebrows skeptically. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything less romantic.\u201d\n \u201cNot guards, then. What if we were Kartunnen? I\u2019m a dancer.\u201d She shimmied a little and ran her hands down the curve of her breasts and belly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a . . . \u201d\n \u201cHm-mm.\u201d That sound was still skeptical, but there was something of a chuckle hidden in it, too. \u201cNo; I can\u2019t.\u201d\n She huffed at him. \u201cOh, come on. You\u2019re . . . you\u2019re my accompanist. And you play drums, with your feet!\u201d She leaned over and shook one of his feet through the quilted silk. \u201cAnd you play pipes of course, because you have such\u2014\u201d she found his hand \u201c\u2014marvelous\u2014\u201d she twined it in hers \u201c\u2014fingers.\u201d\n He gave her a real chuckle this time, one that awoke heat in her stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. My Selemei.\u201d\n She placed three fingers over his mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n \u201cSomeone . . . \u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cUh, someone in a song.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right, because we can sing, too.\u201d\n \u201cAnd we paint ourselves every morning. Like this.\u201d He licked one finger, and ran it over her lower lip.\n Selemei pounced and caught the finger in her mouth. It didn\u2019t stay long; Xeref\u2019s mouth replaced it. Whenever her conflicting fears tried to rise up, she just kissed harder, and clutched him more tightly against her. Her leg twinged once, when he knelt between her knees, but she squirmed into a better position, and once he entered her she forgot everything but their ecstatic unity.\n Xeref shifted beside her afterward, his panting gradually giving way to gentler breaths. Then he laughed. \u201cWell. I know how to convince the cabinet to add medicine to our law.\u201d\n Selemei let out a sigh, and the weight in her mind floated away. \u201cSirin and Eyn,\u201d she swore. \u201cPart of me wants to do that ten times before morning. The other part of me is\u2014a little tired.\u201d\n \u201cTired, my love? I\u2019m sure if I can muster a bit more energy at my age, you can, too.\u201d He stroked her face, her neck. His hand settled around her left breast. She stretched beneath his touch.\n \u201cMm,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t.\u201d It troubled her, though, to be reminded of his sixty years. \u201cAre we so old, Xeref?\u201d\n \u201cI suppose we are. Does it matter?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I felt old, thinking of what it meant to retire. Thinking it would be the end. But I still wanted to.\u201d\n \u201cOf course you did.\u201d\n \u201cBut now\u2014maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d She turned her head to look into his eyes. \u201cIf you can convince them, Xeref, it doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d\n \u201cDo you know what else doesn\u2019t have to end?\u201d Xeref asked. His smile made her catch her breath.\n Selemei breathed against his lips. \u201cTonight.\u201d\n \u201cLet our law pass today,\u201d Selemei murmured. \u201cSirin bring us luck to let it pass. Please, let it pass.\u201d Her Grivi was in the midst of fastening the buttons at the back of her gown\u2014she\u2019d picked feldspar-gray today, to inspire herself with the steadiness of stone. Feeling nervous wouldn\u2019t help. Only the cabinet representatives of the Great Families were allowed into the Cabinet room for the vote, but she was determined to go, even just to wait outside for the result.\n \u201cThere you go, Mistress,\u201d Grivi said.\n \u201cThank you, Grivi.\u201d She took his hand and they walked out across the private drawing room. Maybe this once, Xeref would let her walk there with him. Grivi pushed open the bronze double doors into the sitting room.\n The sitting room was full of strange Imbati, all dressed in black, all marked with the crescent-cross tattoo of the Household. The vestibule curtain and the front door both stood open wide. Selemei shook her head, blinking.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n Two Imbati emerged from Xeref\u2019s office, carrying something. It looked like a stretcher.\n Wait, those were Xeref\u2019s feet!\n \u201cXeref!\u201d she cried. \u201cGods, what happened?\u201d\n She half-hopped, half-ran to his side, fell to her knees and grasped his hand. Pressed her lips to it, but he didn\u2019t respond.\n \u201cPlease excuse us, Lady, we must get him to the Medical Center as quickly as possible.\u201d\n \u201cOh! Yes . . . \u201d She released Xeref\u2019s hand and scooted backward. The black-clad stretcher-bearers moved so fast that he was out the door in half a breath.\n Selemei sat, panting. At last she reached up, found her Grivi\u2019s hand, and tried to stand. Her left foot caught on the hem of her gown, but he caught her when she stumbled, freed the fabric, and helped her the rest of the way up.\n Arriving on her feet, she found Xeref\u2019s Ustin standing directly in front of her.\n \u201cMistress,\u201d Ustin said. \u201cI was attending the Master\u2019s preparations in his office. He summoned the First Houseman to send you a message, because he was concerned you would not be ready in time. Then he stood up and collapsed.\u201d\n \u201cIn my witness,\u201d the First Houseman agreed.\n \u201cHeile have mercy,\u201d Selemei whispered. \u201cLet him reach the Medical Center in time. Elinda forbear.\u201d She cast her eyes toward the front door, now shut; the sitting room, now empty of the Household emergency team. You would almost think nothing had happened.\n And how could it have? If she stayed in this moment, unbreathing, unthinking, nothing would have happened.\n Her body corrected her, of course; she gasped and shook herself. \u201cI should go to him.\u201d\n \u201cMistress.\u201d\n The Imbati was still in front of her. She frowned. \u201cWhat, Ustin?\u201d\n \u201cThe Master had no opportunity to record his vote for today\u2019s Cabinet meeting.\u201d\n No opportunity to record his vote. She heard the sounds; missing emotional register, they resolved only slowly into meaning. Did that mean . . . their proposal might fail?\n \u201cIt has to pass,\u201d she murmured.\n \u201cWith your permission, Mistress, I can escort you to the Cabinet room.\u201d\n She started to understand it. \u201cSo I can tell them. And then go to the Medical Center.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d\n \u201cAll right, then, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n The hallway was walkable. She had to take a brief stop on the spiral staircase to the second floor, Ustin above her, Grivi behind. She gripped tight to the cold iron rail, pressed her right hand against the central stone column, and started up again. Ustin murmured to her as she emerged into the hall.\n \u201cYou understand, Mistress, that because he didn\u2019t record his vote, I could not deliver it.\u201d\n She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it.\u201d\n Ustin hesitated a second, her lips pressed together, but then she resumed course into the central section of the Residence. Selemei kept walking. Grivi\u2019s arm beneath hers was muscular and solid.\n Since the Heir\u2019s suite faced the front of the Residence, she\u2019d always known the Cabinet chamber was down the hall toward the back of the building, but she hadn\u2019t realized it was on the left side. The bronze door was engraved with the repeating insignia of the Grobal. There should have been people here, standing in the hall\u2014cabinet members. Shouldn\u2019t there?\n \u201cWhere are they?\u201d Selemei asked.\n \u201cI believe they have gone in, Mistress,\u201d Ustin replied. \u201cPlease be aware, Grivi and I are not permitted into the room during the meeting. You are the only one who can represent the First Family.\u201d\n \u201cMistress,\u201d Grivi objected, in a low growl.\n \u201cI\u2019ll only be a moment, Grivi.\u201d\n She let herself through the door.\n All talk in the windowless room stopped immediately. So many eyes, staring at her, and all of them belonged to men. The men sitting around the big brass table. The men in the heavy portraits staring down from the walls. She recognized the man at the head of the table\u2014that had to be the Eminence Indal, because he had a noble nose, and wore the white and gold drape of office around his shoulders. Next to him, golden-skinned and curly-haired, sat the Heir Herin\u2014everyone agreed how handsome the Heir was. The others were strangers . . . no, here was one more she knew. Fedron, her cousin in the First Family.\n Fedron stood up. \u201cLady Selemei, what are you doing here?\u201d\n Her voice felt tiny, as if she spoke across a crevasse. \u201cI\u2019m representing the First Family. Xeref\u2014\u201d The ground beneath her shuddered; or it could have been her legs. She found a chair to hold onto. \u201cXeref collapsed. They took him to the Medical Center.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d cried Fedron. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n She blinked at him. \u201cNow. I came directly.\u201d\n Everyone started talking at once. Several of the men leapt up from their chairs; some of them seemed angry at each other. She quickly lost sight of the Eminence and the Heir behind a clump of worried cabinet members. The portraits still stared down from the walls, but Xeref meant nothing to them. Only Cousin Fedron appeared to remember she was here.\n \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cousin, you must be distraught.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t have time for that. I need to be here for the vote,\u201d she explained.\n Fedron cast a sideways glance, maybe looking for one of the other men. \u201cWe can\u2019t possibly vote now, under the circumstances. Perhaps when Xeref returns.\u201d\n \u201cWe can\u2019t?\u201d\n \u201cAre you unattended?\u201d\n She shook her head. \u201cNo, of course not. They\u2019re waiting outside for us to vote. We should really vote.\u201d\n \u201cCousin, we can\u2019t vote today,\u201d Fedron said, with exaggerated patience. \u201cThe Eminence and several of the members have already left.\u201d\n \u201cThey have?\u201d She looked around. It did seem emptier than a moment ago. The Eminence really was gone. That wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to happen.\n None of this was how it was supposed to happen. But now she had somewhere she needed to be. The Medical Center. Selemei took a deep breath and smoothed down her gray skirts. Cautiously, she turned back toward the engraved door and made her way through it.\n In the hall, a few cabinet members were talking and arguing. Imbati Grivi and Imbati Ustin stood waiting for her. They looked all wrong\u2014not calm at all. Grivi\u2019s tattoo was furrowed, and he cast a gaze of anger at Ustin, whose face twitched in a battle to conceal some strong emotion. Ustin managed to master herself, but then cast a glance down the hall.\n \u201cMistress\u2014\u201d\n Grivi stepped between them. \u201cUstin, that\u2019s enough!\u201d\n Startled by his ferocity, Selemei sought after the target of Ustin\u2019s furtive glance. Someone was hurrying up the corridor toward them.\n \u201cBrinx?\u201d\n Her son\u2019s handsome face was nearly unrecognizable\u2014his eyes red, and his mouth twisted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Mother!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come find me, to tell me?! How could you come here at a time like this?\u201d\n Time shrank to a pinpoint. If he spoke again, she didn\u2019t hear it. Why hadn\u2019t she recognized the signs? Hadn\u2019t she noticed how cold Xeref\u2019s hand felt against her lips? Why had she never wondered why Ustin accompanied her here instead of staying with her master? Why had she not realized only disaster could make Imbati show emotion?\n Now all the stones crashed together, and the bottom dropped out of the world.\n This was obviously the funeral of an important man. The Voice of Elinda wore full priestly regalia, dark blue robes and a heavy silver moon-disc around her neck. She sang the service in a contralto of liquid grief. The Eminence Indal and the Heir were here, and every member of the cabinet, and nearly half the Pelismara Society, too, all crowded into the chapel on the Residence\u2019s second floor.\n Selemei couldn\u2019t feel it. Her eyes and throat hurt, but no tears came.\n All she could do was hold Aven\u2019s hand, and curl an arm around Corrim, who clung to her, muffling his sobs in her stomach. Pelli\u2019s Verrid had decided to take her for a walk when she started squirming; Brinx sat on the far side of his sister Enzyel and her Eighth Family partner because he wasn\u2019t speaking to anyone. Selemei leaned her head down against Corrim\u2019s curls, reversing the room in the corner of her eye.\n A shinca tree trunk glowed silver in the back, casting eerie clarity across the gathering. Since shinca could not be removed, the stone wall would have been built around it long ago; and in this room, the ceiling had been designed with arches to look like its branches. That should have been the front of the room. It had been, once. She and Xeref had spoken vows to each other in the warm aura of the tree, invoking the blessed names of Sirin and Eyn. She\u2019d imagined their partnership just as invulnerable\u2014the illusions of a seventeen-year-old child.\n \u201cMother,\u201d Aven whispered. \u201cMother.\u201d\n Selemei lifted her head. The Voice of Elinda was walking toward them with arms outstretched. One golden hand held a box of precious wood; the other a basket of silver wire heaped with yellow mourning silk.\n \u201cCorrim,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet me stand. It\u2019s all right\u2014please, just don\u2019t fall on the floor.\u201d He crumpled sideways, gulping back tears, and she managed to get up, though her left leg felt numb from sitting too long on the metal bench.\n \u201cMay the wounds of grief become the gifts of remembrance,\u201d said the Voice.\n Selemei took the box, and pulled a mourning scarf from the basket. \u201cThank you, Mother Elinda.\u201d The children were supposed to receive their scarves next, but actually Aven took three because Pelli was gone and Corrim wouldn\u2019t look up. While the Voice moved on to Enzyel and Brinx, Selemei helped Aven and Corrim get their scarves fastened around their arms, snug just below the elbow with the ends fluttering down.\n Around her, other people began standing, but there was no hurry to go anywhere. She opened the glossy lid of the box. The sight of Xeref\u2019s name engraved on the crystal spirit globe inside brought such a tide of grief it nearly overwhelmed her, and she snapped it shut.\n \u201cLady Selemei,\u201d said a man\u2019s voice, heavy with tears. \u201cMay Xeref take his place among the stars, and may Heile and Elinda continue to bless you and your family.\u201d\n She looked up; it was Administrator Vull, holding young Pyaras by the hand. He offered her his other hand, and she took it.\n \u201cThank you, Administrator.\u201d\n \u201cCousin, please. Or just Vull. We have too much in common to insist on formality, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n Her breath hitched, and she closed her eyes to wrestle it back into control. \u201cI suppose we do, Cousin.\u201d\n Vull nudged his son, and Pyaras said with admirable sobriety, \u201cI\u2019m very very very very sorry.\u201d Then, impulsively, he hugged her.\n Selemei stroked his head. \u201cThank you, Pyaras.\u201d The boy watched her over his shoulder as his father led him away.\n There was a nudge at Selemei\u2019s elbow. She turned to find Imbati Ustin pressing a note into her hand. It read, Do you wish to attend the next Cabinet meeting?\n She stared. \u201cUstin, now is really not a good time.\u201d\n \u201cMistress,\u201d said Grivi. \u201cI believe your daughter wishes to speak to you.\u201d\n Selemei turned back and took Enzyel in her arms. The girl was taller than her, now, and still growing\u2014oh, gods help her, that was Xeref\u2019s height, would she also inherit the defect that had led to his aneurysm?\n \u201cMay Heile preserve you,\u201d she said, fervently against her daughter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n \u201cOh, Mother, I think I should be asking you that question.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014\u201d Trying to answer that would release the flood. She shook her head. \u201cI love you, Enzyel. I wish you could come for dinner sometimes.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be at the dinner tonight. I\u2019ll try to come by more. And\u2014\u201d Enzyel leaned so close Selemei was enveloped in her cloud of curls. Her daughter\u2019s sweet breath warmed her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got good news.\u201d\n Oh, sweet Elinda, no . . .\n \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d\n Selemei\u2019s hands fisted involuntarily. She tried to say congratulations, but fear had cramped her guts, and what came out sounded like a sob. She fought to control herself while Enzyel\u2019s gentle hand caressed the back of her neck. \u201cYou\u2019ll\u2014\u201d Selemei gulped another breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll take care of yourself, won\u2019t you. Don\u2019t just rely on your Imbati. See a Kartunnen doctor at the Medical Center as well.\u201d\n \u201cI will, Mother, I promise.\u201d\n Grivi murmured behind her, \u201cDo you wish to retire, Mistress?\u201d\n Selemei nodded. She stepped carefully toward the aisle, holding Grivi\u2019s hand across the bench that had separated them. A man she didn\u2019t know stood half blocking her exit into the aisle, watching her.\n \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Selemei.\n \u201cMy condolences on your loss, Lady Selemei,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019m Silvin of the Second Family.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d\n \u201cBut, let\u2019s face it, it could have been worse.\u201d\n She could only blink at him.\n \u201cIt could have been you. Think of the tragedy, if your great gift had been lost to the Race! You must give your Family Council my name when they suggest a new partnership for you.\u201d\n Disgust knocked her back a step. Before the man uttered another word, Grivi appeared between them, looking directly into his face.\n \u201cYou will excuse us, sir,\u201d he said, his deep growl all the more disturbing for its utter calm.\n The man and his servant quickly backed off and vanished in the crowd rather than risk a physical confrontation. Grivi\u2019s shoulders rose once with a deep breath, and then he offered Selemei his hand again.\n \u201cBless you, Grivi,\u201d she whispered.\n \u201cI am here to protect you, Mistress.\u201d\n \u201cSelemei! Cousin, are you all right?\u201d That was Lady Keir, who hurried up and embraced her. \u201cI saw what happened . . . \u201d\n She grimaced. \u201cFine enough.\u201d\n Arbiter Erex caught up with his partner a moment later; he fanned his chest a little, breathing fast. \u201cCousin, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He gestured to the compact Imbati woman behind him. \u201cPlease allow my Kuarmei to help escort you home.\u201d\n Selemei shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of you, but I\u2019ll be fine. I have Grivi and Ustin with me, and I\u2019ll have Verrid too, soon enough.\u201d She began walking toward the exit.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Erex said. \u201cThat was disgraceful behavior. In fact, my Kuarmei got his name; we\u2019ll be reporting him to his Family Council. Rest assured, you won\u2019t have to consider tunnel-hounds like him when the time comes. Someone like Administrator Vull would be a much better match.\u201d\n Selemei almost stumbled. She gritted her teeth and clung to Grivi to keep going. \u201cCome, children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home.\u201d She would have run if she could. Her eyes burned, and she scarcely raised her eyes from the floor until they had collected Pelli and Verrid and were all the way downstairs, safe in their home vestibule, the front door shut and locked and the children dismissed to the care of the Household. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ustin?\u201d\n The tall Imbati woman presented herself with a bow.\n Selemei took a deep breath. \u201cImbati Ustin, I know you\u2019ve been concerned about securing lodging while you\u2019re considering new employment inquiries. Please feel welcome to stay in our Household.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Mistress.\u201d\n \u201cAnd in return, I\u2019d like you to make certain I attend the next Cabinet meeting.\u201d\n They were playing kuarjos, or trying to. You had to do something once the cousins, friends, and well-wishers left\u2014and it helped her ignore the piles of condolence gifts that filled their private drawing room. Selemei sat across from Aven, who occasionally hiccupped to hold back tears but still had grasped the rules pretty well. When Selemei picked up an emerald-helmed warrior, Pelli snatched it from her hand and ran away giggling.\n Selemei only sighed, and Pelli slowed, falling into a droop.\n \u201cPelli, big girl, may I have that back? Bring over your puzzle if you want to play. Bring it over here next to us.\u201d\n Pelli lifted the emerald-helmed warrior and stared at it.\n Selemei turned her attention back to the board and pointed to a junction. \u201cI\u2019ll put it there, whenever Pelli brings it back.\u201d She glanced over. \u201cPlease, baby.\u201d\n Aven moved one of her pieces forward on a left diagonal.\n \u201cNot there,\u201d said Corrim. It was the first he\u2019d spoken in hours. He draped himself over the back of the couch next to her. \u201cShe\u2019ll get you in entrapment. Use the inverse move instead.\u201d\n Aven pulled a face at him. \u201cMother, what happens if a piece crosses the whole board?\u201d\n It walks right off into darkness, like at the edge of the city-caverns. Like at the end of the world. Like in my dreams. And then it has to keep going anyway. One breath, one step, in this place with no air and no light.\n Pelli\u2019s soft fingers were tickling her hands. Selemei took a breath, and stroked them, and found the golden warrior had been returned, wearing a hat of twisted white paper. \u201cThank you, big girl. All right, so, Aven. The game changes once a warrior is able to cross the board, because\u2014\u201d\n The vestibule curtain swished open, revealing Imbati Ustin.\n \u201cMistress.\u201d Ustin bowed. \u201cI apologize for the interruption. I\u2019ve learned that an emergency Cabinet meeting has been called for tonight. If you wish to attend, we must hurry.\u201d\n Hurry? What should I do? Selemei stood, searching the space around her for reasons to feel prepared. I should tell the children. \u201cChildren, I\u2019m going to step out for a few minutes. It won\u2019t be long. Corrim, why don\u2019t you take my place at kuarjos? Pelli\u2014\u201d She bent and kissed her. \u201cI love you, big girl. Be back soon, all right?\u201d\n \u201cMama back,\u201d Pelli answered.\n Selemei searched the room again, but found only absence and grief. \u201cAm I ready?\u201d she asked.\n Grivi offered his arm. \u201cYou are dressed for guests, Mistress. That will be perfectly appropriate.\u201d\n Ustin nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll brief you on our way.\u201d\n Selemei tried to project confidence on her way to the front door so as not to alarm the children. It would be all right. Fedron would be there. She wouldn\u2019t be alone.\n And she had to be there.\n \u201cMistress,\u201d said Ustin, walking behind her right shoulder. \u201cWe must have you seated in the Cabinet room before any of the other members arrive. Can you walk faster?\u201d\n \u201cOh, yes.\u201d She\u2019d been fighting the urge to run along the carpeted hall; all she needed to do was give in slightly. And hold tighter to Grivi\u2019s hand. She skipped a little, taking extra hops on her right foot.\n \u201cThere are two types of votes, Mistress,\u201d said Ustin. \u201cProcedural votes are the ones that allow cabinet business to continue. For those, simply follow your cousin Grobal Fedron\u2019s lead.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d\n \u201cThere are two legislative votes scheduled, so far as I know, in addition to the Indelis proposal.\u201d\n \u201cTwo?\u201d The carpet ended where the corridor gave into the Residence\u2019s central section. Selemei misstepped. Pain stabbed down the back of her left leg. \u201cAah!\u201d\n She hung on Grivi\u2019s arm. The pain had flashed and gone, but not gone completely; it echoed. She gritted her teeth. This isn\u2019t going to work. Why am I even trying?\n Elinda help me, how can I not?\n \u201cMistress,\u201d Grivi murmured, \u201cMay I carry you?\u201d\n She shook her head vigorously. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s already bad enough\u2014if people saw us . . . \u201d Catching a silent exchange of looks between Ustin and Grivi, she frowned, and then realized the problem. The Cabinet chamber was upstairs. \u201cHow can I get upstairs, Ustin? I have to be there!\u201d\n \u201cI have an idea,\u201d Ustin replied. \u201cGrivi, if you both would please meet me at the door of the Household Director\u2019s office.\u201d She loped off beneath the arch into the public foyers of the central section.\n \u201cMistress,\u201d said Grivi, slowly. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d\n Hard to answer that question, but, \u201cI will.\u201d She managed it by focusing on the floor. Polished stone in one room, a carpet with geometric patterns in black and green. Ancient tile in the foyer before the Hall of the Eminence, worn to white mostly, but near the walls, still showing an intricate branching design in gold. Step by step.\n The Imbati Household Director kept an office just beside the main front entrance; its bronze door was uncurtained because of the frequency of messengers, and today it stood open. Ustin returned to them as they drew nearer.\n \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Assistant Director Samirya,\u201d she said, in a low voice. \u201cWe have permission. Let\u2019s take her elbows.\u201d\n Grivi gave a reluctant-sounding grunt, but then Selemei found herself lifted a finger\u2019s breadth from the floor and ushered at high speed toward the door. Just as they reached it, the two Imbati turned her sideways\u2014and they went through.\n Selemei gulped. This was not Grobal territory. On a tall metal stool sat a golden-skinned woman with straight hair pulled severely back from her crescent-cross Household tattoo. She looked up from an ordinator screen full of glowing green symbols, and regarded them with a fierce unwavering gaze.\n \u201cThis once, Ustin,\u201d she said.\n Selemei was swept sideways again, and found herself in a tiny room with featureless metal walls, so close between Ustin and Grivi that they could not help but touch her. She clasped her hands together so as not to give offense in return.\n The room lifted.\n Selemei gasped. \u201cAn elevator?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s for messengers,\u201d Grivi rumbled.\n \u201cAnd emergencies,\u201d added Ustin. \u201cI just hope we\u2019ll be in time.\u201d\n Perhaps this brief respite had been just what she needed, because her leg took her weight better when she tested it. Here on the second floor, the open entrance of the elevator was covered with a curtain. Ustin stepped out, but swiftly ducked back in again.\n \u201cGro\u2014people in the hall, Grivi,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s cross, while we still have Samirya\u2019s permission.\u201d\n \u201cCross?\u201d Selemei asked. She leaned on Grivi to enter the main hallway. Over there, beneath the arches, stood the cluster of men in question; strangers from other Families, with their Imbati. Even this far off, their raised voices sounded aggressive.\n \u201cCabinet members, but they\u2019re still attended,\u201d said Ustin. \u201cI\u2019m guessing we have maybe three minutes before they go in.\u201d\n Again the two Imbati lifted her by the elbows, sweeping her across the hall, where Ustin lifted a curtain and let them through a door. Here the corridor was narrow and dim, and Grivi could only support her from behind. She tried to hurry, in spite of the risk. She didn\u2019t belong here. What argument could Ustin possibly have used to justify allowing a Higher like her into the servants\u2019 Maze?\n Around a corner to the right was more light, through a series of windows on the left side. She gratefully used their stone sills to support herself, and then a door opened on her right.\n She could feel eyes staring down at her as she entered\u2014but they were only the painted eyes of dead Eminences. The room was empty.\n Ustin and Grivi helped her ensconce herself in one of the tall-backed brass chairs. Xeref\u2019s chair. It had none of his warmth or softness.\n \u201cMistress.\u201d Ustin pressed a paper into her hand. \u201cThese are the votes you will need to cast. The most important thing is, you must say you occupy this seat for the First Family.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m representing the First Family.\u201d\n \u201cMistress, if you will: I occupy this seat . . . \u201d\n \u201cI occupy this seat for the First\u2014\u201d\n Click.\n Ustin\u2019s gaze snapped to the main door. Faster than the turning handle, she leapt to the Maze door and disappeared.\n Selemei\u2019s heart flipped; she tried to swallow it back into place and keep breathing. Three men walked in, conversing, then a fourth. The fifth man was first to notice her. He was broad-bodied, golden-skinned, and bald as a stone.\n \u201cHello?\u201d That single word filled the chamber. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n She thought of Imbati Ustin. \u201cI occupy this seat for the First Family.\u201d\n Now the others saw her. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWho\u2014wait, wasn\u2019t she the lady who . . . ?\u201d \u201cXeref\u2019s partner?\u201d \u201cWhat in Varin\u2019s name is she doing?\u201d\n \u201cI occupy this seat for the First Family.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lady, you\u2019re going to have to leave,\u201d said the bald man.\n She grabbed the lower edges of the chair, winding her fingers through gaps in the brass. \u201cI occupy this seat for the First Family.\u201d\n They were talking about her, now, and more of them poured in every second. She couldn\u2019t see Fedron.\n \u201cCan we have her removed?\u201d \u201cBut, I mean, the poor thing\u2014\u201d \u201cThis can\u2019t be serious.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll go soon enough.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d asked the Eminence Indal. He leaned on a cane of rich dark wood. His manservant, a single figure in black silk against the jewel colors of the other men, murmured in his ear while they went to the head of the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He sniffed through his noble nose and shifted his white and gold drape as he sat. And looked right at her.\n Selemei lost her breath.\n \u201cNo problem, your Eminence.\u201d The Heir waved his golden hand magnanimously. \u201cShe\u2019s just grieving, we can ignore her.\u201d\n \u201cBut, cabinet business,\u201d objected a man with bulging eyes.\n \u201cOur main point of business is the empty seat.\u201d That was the bald man\u2019s resonant voice. \u201cThat is why Speaker Orn pressured us to convene this meeting at such short notice.\u201d\n Selemei closed her fists tighter, until the brass hurt her fingers. \u201cI occupy\u2014\u201d\n Fedron burst in the door with a desperate look on his face.\n \u201c\u2014this seat for the First Family.\u201d\n Fedron gaped at her, panting. \u201cWh\u2014Selemei? Cousin?\u201d\n Somehow his presence stopped the words up in her throat. She shoved them out. \u201cI occupy. This seat. For the First Family.\u201d\n Fedron deflated, and fell into the chair beside her. \u201cWell, hand of Sirin . . . \u201d\n \u201cWe should just get started,\u201d someone said.\n The Manservant to the Eminence struck reciting stance, his clear baritone cutting through any further murmurs of objection. \u201cI call to order this meeting of the Pelismar Cabinet, and serve as a reminder of the Grobal Trust: giving to each according to need, the hand of the Grobal shall guide the eight cities of Varin.\u201d\n \u201cSo noted,\u201d said a red-faced man sitting at the Eminence\u2019s right. \u201cFirst order of business, acknowledgment and certification of the empty seat. Which is empty, in spite of appearances.\u201d\n Selemei took a breath, but it was no use; hopeless certainty stole the words from her tongue. It was just as they\u2019d said: they were ignoring her. While the men leaned forward to press buttons below the personal ordinator screens embedded in the table before them, her own screen\u2014Xeref\u2019s screen\u2014was dead.\n Dead love, dead hopes.\n The Manservant to the Eminence pulled a small device from his pocket, bowed, and intoned, \u201cA unanimous vote is required to certify an empty seat. I count one vote in dissent. The seat remains occupied by the First Family.\u201d\n \u201cWait, now,\u201d said the man with the bulging eyes. \u201cFourteen to one? Fedron, you\u2019re not serious.\u201d\n Fedron folded his arms. \u201cDoes that seat look empty to you?\u201d\n Selemei looked at her cousin, but he didn\u2019t meet her gaze.\n The red-faced man beside the Eminence gave a noisy sigh. \u201cThe seat remains occupied in the presence of a legitimate substitute. Indal\u2019s Jex, you\u2019ll carry the cabinet\u2019s petition to the Arbiter of the First Family Council to investigate the legitimacy of the substitute.\u201d\n The Manservant to the Eminence bowed. No animosity on his face, but Imbati only showed feelings when they meant to\u2014unlike the other cabinet members, who scowled and scowled while Fedron continued to avoid looking at her. Only the bald man with the big voice held pity in his face. They all argued about one topic after another. It went on so long that Selemei\u2019s fingers cramped around the curled brass of her chair; she had to extricate them painfully and rub them together in her lap. She combed through the men\u2019s portentous words for the Indelis proposal, but in vain. The paper Ustin had given her proved useless, for the voting screen before her remained blank.\n \u201cRight,\u201d declared the big-voiced man at last, \u201cif there is no further business, the meeting shall adjourn.\u201d\n \u201cSeconded.\u201d\n Selemei\u2019s heart shrank; she didn\u2019t dare protest into the silence that followed.\n The Manservant to the Eminence bowed again, and intoned, \u201cSo it shall be. This meeting is adjourned.\u201d\n If the last two years hadn\u2019t trained her to move slowly, she might have tried to run from the room. Selemei stood, and pushed back her chair, swallowing grief.\n \u201cThat was some nerve,\u201d said a man somewhere to her left. \u201cGet back to your children.\u201d\n She dropped her gaze, but her cheeks blazed. She watched the placement of her feet, moving out from between the chairs.\n \u201cLady\u2014Selemei, is it?\u201d When she looked up, the Heir was staring down at her. His face was young, handsome, chill as gold.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cYou realize we\u2019ve given you a gift.\u201d As he spoke, he stepped closer, looming over her.\n She shook her head.\n \u201cOur patience, in the name of your bereavement. You know there are other ways to respond when someone disrupts cabinet business.\u201d\n Mai help her\u2014would he lay hands on her? Selemei took a nervous step backward.\n Her left leg collapsed. She grasped for the nearest chair, felt fingers slip on the unkind brass, knocked her elbow, and hit the floor, the chair nearly coming down on top of her. She sat, immobilized by pain and shame while the Heir walked away without a backward glance. Gulps of air kept her from sobbing but couldn\u2019t stop tears creeping onto her cheeks.\n \u201cCousin?\u201d Fedron crouched beside her. \u201cLet me help you up.\u201d\n She nodded. Pretended this was just a room, not a room full of eyes and sneers. Gritting her teeth, she got her right leg under her. With Fedron\u2019s help, she managed to stand, and limp to the door where the manservants were waiting.\n \u201cGrivi,\u201d she said the moment she saw him, \u201cI\u2019ll need you to make an appointment with that doctor. The one who was at Vull\u2019s.\u201d\n Grivi interposed himself beneath her arm with a murmur of thanks for Fedron and a cutting glance for Ustin.\n \u201cLet me walk you home,\u201d Fedron said.\n She hadn\u2019t expected that. They moved slowly, at her limping pace. But a bigger surprise came in the spiral staircase, where Fedron allowed his manservant to pass him and turned to face her.\n \u201cI\u2019m grateful to you, Cousin,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Grateful! Had she heard him right?\n \u201cSure, you were misguided, but that was a big favor you tried to do for the Family. Someone overheard that we were inviting Garr back from Selimna to claim the seat at the next scheduled meeting, so they convened this one early. You know, to certify it empty before he could get here.\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t tell whether to be flattered or insulted, and ended up mostly confused. \u201cGarr and Tamelera are coming back?\u201d\n Fedron rubbed his hand across his forehead. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not so straightforward at this point.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened to the Indelis proposal?\u201d\n A strange expression flashed across his face. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d\n How many times had she been told not to worry? \u201cI do worry about it, Cousin. That\u2019s why I was there.\u201d\n \u201cLet me talk to Erex first, all right? And then we\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d\n We\u2019d better. But she was too exhausted and hurt to argue. She needed Aven; she needed Pelli, and Corrim. Just to hold them, and cry, with no eyes watching.\n Selemei screamed and woke. A nightmare, not of wandering in darkness this time, but of standing exposed in sunlight, under the judging eyes of Father Varin himself. She panted while her heart slowed, rubbing her coverlet to remind her hands of soft silk and reality. Her body came into focus.\n Everything hurts.\n Each bruise that woke to identify itself roused another horrible memory of the Cabinet meeting. She couldn\u2019t force those events into sense, no matter how many times she tried. She called, \u201cUstin?\u201d\n The Imbati woman didn\u2019t appear. But then, she probably wasn\u2019t expecting to be called, because . . . Selemei\u2019s throat closed. She looked away from the place where Xeref should have lain. Deliberately, she rearranged her pillows and pushed herself back to sit. Mercy, it hurt . . . but how much worse might it have been without Grivi\u2019s care? She tried again, though her voice quavered.\n \u201cImbati Ustin, may I speak with you?\u201d\n Ustin emerged this time, so silently she might have come, wysp-like, straight through the wall. She wore a black silk dress that showed off her muscular shoulders, not the suit she had normally worn on duty. \u201cMistress?\u201d\n This was already all wrong. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d Selemei said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair of me to demand you call me Mistress now, is it?\u201d\n Ustin bowed; a single pale braid swung forward of her shoulder. \u201cLady Selemei.\u201d\n Selemei inhaled what calm she could manage. \u201cI went to the Cabinet meeting, but it went so badly\u2014I wonder if I might discuss it with you.\u201d Ustin\u2019s sober silence felt like disapproval, though her face didn\u2019t change. \u201cIf you consent to advise me, I\u2019ll pay you for your time.\u201d\n \u201cI am willing, Lady,\u201d Ustin replied. \u201cUnfortunately, I have a very incomplete picture of what happened, having been limited to what Grobal Fedron told us, and what I could overhear from other members leaving.\u201d\n \u201cWell . . . we can start with what Fedron said. He said the meeting was called in emergency because Garr and Tamelera were coming back from Selimna. How would they have anything to do with anything?\u201d\n \u201cLady, are you aware that the seat my Master held was at-large?\u201d\n The term wasn\u2019t entirely unfamiliar. \u201cI\u2019d heard that. It means he\u2019s\u2014\u201d She gulped down a pang. \u201c\u2014he was, not the only First Family cabinet member.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Lady. Each of the twelve Great Families is assigned a single inalienable seat. Beyond that, only two seats remain. In those, any Family\u2019s representative may sit.\u201d\n \u201cBut we happened to hold it.\u201d She closed fists, remembering her fingers tangled in the chair. \u201cAnd they wanted to declare it empty, but I was sitting in it.\u201d Another piece fell into its slot. \u201cThat\u2019s what Cousin Garr was supposed to do\u2014sit in the seat so Fedron wouldn\u2019t have to admit it was empty.\u201d\n \u201cLady,\u201d Ustin said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you know that any competition among twelve Families for a single empty seat would be fierce.\u201d\n That was an understatement. Selemei nodded. \u201cThe cabinet rushed to meet so that Garr would come too late\u2014and they would all have been itching to fight one another\u2014but then I was there. They tried to pretend I wasn\u2019t\u2014except Fedron said I was. Why would he . . . ?\u201d She patted down the question with both hands. \u201cNo, of course he would. He had to have been in a panic when he thought they\u2019d outmaneuvered him.\u201d That face he\u2019d made, arriving in the seat beside her . . .\n The corner of Ustin\u2019s mouth twitched slightly upward. Selemei chose to interpret that as approval.\n \u201cBut I still don\u2019t see how any of this has anything to do with the Indelis proposal. I was listening. It was never even mentioned.\u201d\n A shadow of something strangely like sadness flitted across Ustin\u2019s face. \u201cLady, no vote can occur if a proposal has no sponsor.\u201d\n The men didn\u2019t care. Not even Fedron had sustained his sponsorship once tragedy struck. \u201cI could have sponsored it, if I\u2019d known,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was there to cast his vote. But that\u2019s why you brought me, as a sponsor. Is it?\u201d\n Ustin didn\u2019t immediately respond. Selemei braced herself for I don\u2019t know, but then the Imbati answered, \u201cLady, you recall we were jointly involved in a conversation about the seriousness of the risks Grobal ladies face. I continue to share my Master\u2019s belief in the proposal\u2019s benefits for ladies and their children.\u201d\n For me. And for my children. Without a law to protect her, she\u2019d have men approaching her constantly; and how could she refuse to entertain partnership arrangements that the Family Council might propose?\n \u201cI could still sponsor it,\u201d she said. \u201cFedron has acknowledged me in the seat.\u201d Only once the words were out did their shuddering import take shape. To do that, I would have to claim to be a legitimate cabinet member. It perfectly explained Fedron\u2019s ambivalence. \u201cThe Family still wants Garr there.\u201d\n Ustin nodded. \u201cLady, we can be certain of that. Grobal Garr is a man of influence, and was the First Family Council\u2019s choice of substitute. However, the Cabinet bylaws which allow a Family to provide a substitute imply that said substitute shall then fill the seat on a permanent basis.\u201d\n \u201cThey imply . . . ? Gnash it, Ustin\u2014that\u2019s why the Eminence is sending his man to the First Family Council. He thinks I\u2019ve claimed the seat!\u201d\n Ustin\u2019s face remained impassive. \u201cTechnically, Lady, you have.\u201d\n \u201cAnd that\u2019s why Fedron wants to talk to Erex. Maybe I saved the seat, but I just delayed their problem! And then I fell down, and embarrassed myself in front of everyone . . . \u201d\n That seemed to startle Ustin. \u201cLady, you fell? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n The shame flooded back. Selemei pressed her hands to her face, shaking her head. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had to rush there\u2014or if I\u2019d just been holding onto something\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThe Luck-bringer\u2019s hand is not always kind.\u201d\n Her mother had often said so. Selemei instinctively raised her head for the traditional response. \u201cBut Blessed Sirin sees far, and does not explain his choices.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why my Grivi will be taking me to the Medical Center today.\u201d\n As if recognizing her need, Grivi stepped out from beneath his curtain and bowed respectfully.\n \u201cGood morning, Mistress. Allow me to dress you for your appointment?\u201d\n \u201cYes, thank you, Grivi. Ustin, you may be excused. Thank you for your help.\u201d\n The Imbati woman bowed and withdrew.\n \u201cMistress,\u201d Grivi said gruffly, \u201cif you wish Ustin to advise you, perhaps you should inquire.\u201d\n \u201cBut I did; I asked her in,\u201d Selemei said. \u201cI did offer to pay her.\u201d\n Grivi looked down at his hands silently for several seconds. At last he said, \u201cMistress, I believe you requested to see Doctor Kartunnen Wint, who confirmed Grobal Pyaras at his party?\u201d\n \u201cYes . . . \u201d\n \u201cPlease be aware that we\u2019ll have to go a little farther than the Medical Center for your appointment.\u201d\n \u201cOh. All right.\u201d Vull kept a doctor outside the Medical Center? But perhaps Wint was worth it; she certainly had made an impression at the party.\n After she was dressed and had eaten breakfast with the family, Selemei assured the children she\u2019d be home soon\u2014with extra kisses for Aven and Pelli\u2014and she and Grivi walked across the gravel paths of the Residence gardens to the Conveyor\u2019s Hall. Selemei winced with every step. Thirty-seven should have been too young to walk like an old woman. It should have been too young to be widowed, too. Her former self dragged at her\u2014the Selemei who had run and hidden behind that carefully tended hedge on her right, joined by a handsome man who gently kissed her amid the voluptuous scent of imported surface soil. It made her too conscious of the effort Grivi must be expending to keep her steady, to keep her moving. And conscious, too, of strange glances he cast toward her.\n Was he unhappy?\n She watched him. In the Conveyor\u2019s Hall, Grivi seated her in a chair by the stone wall. He left the green-carpeted reception zone, crossing the road that passed under the Hall\u2019s massive entrance arch and ended against the wall to her left. The zone beyond was crowded with vehicles of varying sizes; Grivi procured a one-passenger skimmer from the Household staff, and adjusted its control column to upright for a standing driver. Then he came and fetched her to it, slowing attentively at the spot where carpet met stone. He was always thoughtful\u2014he didn\u2019t engage the skimmer\u2019s repulsion until she was fully settled. If he had some complaint, she couldn\u2019t detect it.\n Driving felt quite normal. The skimmer hummed; the cool wind of their passage refreshed her; and outside the gate of the Residence grounds, broad circumferences busy with vehicles and colorful Lower pedestrians made a pleasant distraction. Grivi accelerated up a steep rampway of reinforced limestone that lifted them above slate roofs, and through the bore to the fourth level.\n In this neighborhood, the cavern roof hung much lower. Grivi turned their skimmer into an outbound radius, and then into a circumference where the building fa\u00e7ades formed a continuous wall on either side. The road ended against a melted limestone column as broad as a storefront. Above the roofs of the buildings, the slope of another level rampway was visible, passing up and behind the column\u2019s ancient mass. Grivi brought the skimmer to a stop. Its hum faded, and it sank to rest on the stone. The front wall of their destination had high oblong windows and bore chrome script identifying doctors Wint, Albar, and Sedmin. A bright globe lamp, green as the sphere of Heile, goddess of health, hung above glass front doors.\n Selemei took Grivi\u2019s arm, passing a pair of wysps that drifted along the sidewalk, and entered through the glass doors that parted before them.\n The crowd in the room within plunged into silence. Only a small boy with the castemark necklace of a Melumalai merchant continued to run in circles until he nearly tripped over Grivi\u2019s feet, then looked up and bawled in terror. His father rushed up, gaped helplessly at Selemei for a second, then turned to Grivi and blurted, \u201cMay your honorable service earn its just reward, Imbati, sir,\u201d before scooping the boy up and hiding behind a large group of thick-belted Venorai. The Venorai had the look of farmers\u2014all were muscular, with striking sun-marked skin. One older man looked bright red, and a couple young women were covered with brown spots, and the rest were solid brown\u2014they were all embracing each other, and she couldn\u2019t guess which one was here to see a doctor. Maybe the red one?\n An inner door opened. Two Kartunnen men emerged: both wore green lip-paint and gray medical coats. The taller of them made a deferent approach to two Imbati mothers and their child; the shorter one came up to Selemei, and bowed.\n \u201cLady Selemei, if you will please follow me.\u201d He made a second bow to Grivi, but did not greet him. He led the two of them back through the door, paused a moment to key a sequence on a wall panel, then took them down a long bare hall and opened a numbered door.\n Doctor Kartunnen Wint stood in the room within. Selemei recognized her instantly, though this time the style of her gray coat was more functional. She had the same red hair, tied in a knot behind her head. She bowed. \u201cMy practice is honored by your patronage, Lady Selemei.\u201d\n \u201cDoctor Wint. I was surprised not to find you at the Medical Center,\u201d Selemei admitted. \u201cGrivi, you may undress me now.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d He began undoing her buttons.\n \u201cLady, I did work at the Medical Center,\u201d Wint replied. \u201cBut after the death of Lady Indelis, I couldn\u2019t bear to stay. Administrator Vull nonetheless has maintained his family\u2019s relationship with me, for which I\u2019m grateful.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sure. That was a terrible tragedy.\u201d That Vull would continue to bring his family to her spoke eloquently for the doctor\u2019s skills. Selemei pulled her hands out of her sleeves and raised them over her head.\n \u201cMay I ask what brings you here, Lady?\u201d\n \u201cMy leg. I fell yesterday.\u201d Grivi lifted the gown off her; she lost the doctor for a moment behind layers of silk. When Selemei glimpsed her again, Wint still looked inquisitive. \u201cWell, I stepped back on it, and fell. I\u2019d been overusing it. Pushing through pain earlier in the day. And you said, at the party, that I should see a Kartunnen therapist.\u201d\n Wint blushed, and glanced at Grivi. \u201cI did, Lady.\u201d\n \u201cSo.\u201d She indicated her own body. \u201cPlease proceed.\u201d\n \u201cLady, would you consent to lie facedown on this table?\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d With Grivi\u2019s help, she climbed up to the padded surface. The slick material was cold on her right cheek, and all down her body.\n \u201cWhat kind of injury was this, Lady?\u201d\n \u201cBirth injury.\u201d\n \u201cAll right, that\u2019s what I thought. How far down your leg does the pain go? Does it go below your knee?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cHave you had any bowel problems or incontinence, Lady?\u201d\n \u201cNo, thank Heile.\u201d\n \u201cFever or weight loss?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cWhat forms of treatment or testing have you previously pursued, Lady?\u201d\n \u201cGrivi, please tell her.\u201d\n While Grivi explained the tests and treatment she\u2019d received in the Medical Center and the therapies thereafter, the doctor examined her back, rear, and legs. She pressed firmly, but did manage to avoid the bruises from the fall. Then she followed that up with some kind of pricking tool.\n \u201cThank you, Imbati, sir,\u201d Wint said, when Grivi had finished. \u201cMay your honorable service earn its just reward. Lady, can you please stand for me?\u201d\n Once she was standing, Wint asked her to lift her leg, straighten her knee, lift her big toe, and stand on her toes. It went decently. It was hard to know if she should hope to perform better or worse.\n \u201cDoctor,\u201d Selemei asked, \u201cwhat do you think? Can you fix it?\u201d\n The doctor pinched her own forehead with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too early to say, Lady. I\u2019d like to recommend a course of exercises, and request that you undergo further tests.\u201d\n Selemei\u2019s mouth fell open in dismay. \u201cBut this is like starting over! I thought\u2014\u201d What had she thought? That Wint would have Heile\u2019s hands, to heal with a touch? That if her leg could be fixed, it would change the past? Nothing would erase the sight of her fall from the cabinet members\u2019 memories! Nothing could bring Xeref back!\n The truth tried to drown her. Selemei gulped air, struggling to stay above it, and covered her face with both hands. It was dark in the space behind them, warm, and damp. She did not want to cry in front of the doctor.\n Grivi said softly, \u201cI\u2019m here to protect you, Mistress.\u201d\n Selemei swallowed hard. \u201cDoctor,\u201d she managed, \u201cI\u2019d like to get dressed.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, Lady.\u201d\n The layers of silk gave her a moment\u2019s privacy; she could focus on her hands and her sleeves, and speak as if this were about someone else. \u201cOf course you\u2019d want tests, doctor; here I am walking in, and you don\u2019t know me or my case. I\u2019m sure Grivi could have the Medical Center send over what we\u2019ve already done. I probably should resume therapy\u2014probably never should have stopped, childish of me, really . . . \u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do more today, Lady,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cHowever, there may be one way to prevent falls while we pursue longer-term improvement. Might I suggest a cane?\u201d\n Selemei blinked at her for a few seconds. Then it occurred to her, \u201cThe Eminence Indal carries a cane.\u201d\n \u201cDoes he indeed, Lady?\u201d\n \u201cHe takes it into the Cabinet meetings.\u201d\n The doctor bowed. \u201cTwo doors down from here is a shop where you might be able to find something suitable.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Doctor. I\u2019ll look, and I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d Grivi had finished his work at just the right moment; she took his arm.\n \u201cThank you, Lady. I\u2019ll send you a report on what we\u2019ve discussed, and a list of suggested actions.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d\n Selemei walked on Grivi\u2019s arm out through the main hall, hurrying through the waiting room so as to cause a minimum of disturbance to the Lowers there. It wasn\u2019t difficult to find the shop Doctor Wint had suggested; it was staffed by Kartunnen and carried a variety of medical devices. None of the canes here were made of wood, but that only made sense\u2014this was not a neighborhood which could support such high prices. There was a bin of black canes, but they seemed too Imbati; another bin held aluminum canes, but they seemed too Low. Selemei scanned a glass case of artist-designed canes intended for Kartunnen until she found a graceful one which did not use Heile\u2019s green in its design.\n \u201cPurchase this one, if you would, Grivi.\u201d\n Grivi looked down at his hands, clasped before his waist, and said quietly, \u201cMistress? Must you purchase a cane?\u201d\n \u201cSorry?\u201d\n \u201cI can accompany you at parties, if you wish. Even if the rooms are crowded.\u201d\n Oh, no. That was why he was unhappy. This morning she\u2019d asked Ustin for advice before she even called for him. She\u2019d asked Kartunnen Wint for medical assistance that Grivi had always provided. And now, buying a cane meant she wouldn\u2019t need him for walking, either. For the first time, she understood what he\u2019d said\u2014\u2018if you wish Ustin to advise you, perhaps you should inquire.\u2019 He didn\u2019t mean ask; he meant write an employment inquiry. That was uncharacteristic sharpness for him, but now that she thought about it, he must have been upset ever since that first day, when Ustin approached her during Pelli\u2019s nap.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grivi,\u201d she said. \u201cYou serve me well, and always have. Please don\u2019t worry; ladies don\u2019t hire gentlemen\u2019s servants.\u201d\n His shoulders rose and fell with a breath. \u201cIf I may presume, Mistress.\u201d\n \u201cPlease.\u201d\n \u201cLadies don\u2019t attend Cabinet meetings either.\u201d\n \u201cThat was a disaster, Grivi.\u201d\n \u201cMistress . . . \u201d\n \u201cIf you differ, Grivi, please tell me.\u201d\n \u201cYou have now attended two meetings, Mistress, more than any other lady can say. In neither case did you flee. And your persistence has won you the provisional support of the First Family\u2019s cabinet member. Your intelligence is certainly a match to Master Xeref\u2019s, a long suspicion of mine that was confirmed when you spoke to Ustin this morning. If you are to continue in this, you will need her services more than mine. But I do wish to know one thing.\u201d\n His honesty was sobering, almost frightening. She whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n \u201cIs this your wish, Mistress?\u201d Emotion colored his voice on that phrase, and he bowed his head. \u201cI have vowed myself to your service, vowed to make your wishes my own. And if this is your wish, so let it be. But please be sure.\u201d\n How could she answer, when she wasn\u2019t sure of anything anymore, even her next footstep? \u201cThank you, Grivi,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wish\u2014I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n Grivi bowed. \u201cIf you will excuse me a moment, I\u2019ll purchase the cane.\u201d\n Of course she\u2019d been summoned before the Arbiter of the First Family Council. Of course she had. The letter delivered by Erex\u2019s Kuarmei had made her feel sick to her stomach; now she squeezed her fear into it with one sweaty hand, taking care not to hurt Grivi with the other as they walked. Selemei turned Ustin\u2019s excellent political advice over and over in her head, but there was no guarantee Erex would listen. Chances were, he\u2019d scold her and send her home to grieve.\n They reached the hallway. Erex\u2019s office was across from Fedron\u2019s; at her back, she could feel Xeref\u2019s office whispering of emptiness. She shivered, squeezed Grivi\u2019s hand, and knocked on the Arbiter\u2019s office door. The door swung silently inward.\n \u201cLady Selemei,\u201d intoned Erex\u2019s Kuarmei from behind the door.\n \u201cCome in, Cousin.\u201d Erex stood before his desk with fingers tented against his lips. He gestured to a cushioned chair. \u201cPlease, sit down.\u201d\n Gnash it. Gnash all of it. She let herself be led to the seat, and seated in it. If she hadn\u2019t feared her leg might fail her, she might have preferred to face Erex nose to nose. On the other hand, his position of Family authority lent him more magnitude than his physical size. Selemei clasped her hand tightly around her left wrist; sharp rubies pressed into her skin.\n My blood is precious. The Family doesn\u2019t deserve my life.\n Erex leaned back on the front edge of his desk. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of you and your family in this difficult time,\u201d he said. \u201cHow have you been feeling?\u201d\n She didn\u2019t trust this kindness. \u201cI\u2019m coping.\u201d\n \u201cAnd how are the children?\u201d\n She almost told him. The boys were suffering most after the loss of their parent and mentor; Xeref had been less close to the older girls, so they were less affected; while Pelli was sad, but didn\u2019t truly understand. But this was a distraction, possibly even a trap. \u201cAs well as can be expected, given the circumstances.\u201d\n Erex waited. Testing her with silence. Selemei stared at her hands, at a single sparkling ruby drop that had escaped her grip, and outlasted him.\n Erex cleared his throat. \u201cCousin, I received a messenger from the Eminence Indal yesterday. Do you know what he came to ask me?\u201d\n She nodded, but kept her eyes on the sparkling ruby, as if it were a wysp that could give her good luck.\n \u201cIn fact, I was shocked,\u201d Erex said. \u201cIndal\u2019s Jex stayed for several minutes, to pressure me into providing an immediate answer. And I might have, if I hadn\u2019t already spoken to Fedron. He told me to wait.\u201d\n Selemei spoke softly. \u201cCousin Fedron understands the bind the First Family is in.\u201d\n \u201cHe does,\u201d Erex agreed automatically. Then he twitched, as if he\u2019d suddenly awakened. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n Selemei\u2019s heart banged inside her chest. She tried to keep her breath level, and hold Ustin\u2019s advice steady in her mind. \u201cThe bind the First Family is in,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cYes. I understand that the Family failed to deliver its chosen substitute to a critical meeting, and that if I hadn\u2019t been there, we would no longer have any claim to the seat. At the same time, I realize it would be very difficult at this point for us to sue for permission to seat a second replacement.\u201d\n The Arbiter clearly hadn\u2019t expected her to answer. He seemed flustered for a second, but then resumed his scolding. \u201cIn fact, Selemei, we could be embroiled in the courts for years because of you.\u201d\n \u201cBecause of me?\u201d she asked. \u201cNot because the Family couldn\u2019t keep quiet about their plan to bring Cousin Garr back from Selimna?\u201d\n Erex frowned. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n Ustin would have said, I don\u2019t know. \u201cIsn\u2019t it public?\u201d she asked. \u201cSpeaker Orn informed every member of the cabinet. If I hadn\u2019t attended the meeting, the Third and Fifth families would be using their connections to the Heir and the Eminence to bully their way into our seat right now.\u201d She shifted with a deep breath, readying for a risk. \u201cAnd actually, there\u2019s no need for any legal dispute.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Cousin. Every Family has an interest in ousting us. They\u2019ve wanted to see the First Family weakened for years.\u201d\n Her racing heart tried to leap out her throat, but she said it. \u201cThey can\u2019t do anything if I become the First Family\u2019s cabinet member.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d\n Selemei released her wrist and leaned forward. \u201cCousin, let me try. It would keep us out of legal trouble. The others in the cabinet might let me stay, because they\u2019ll think the First Family has been weakened.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help a bitter laugh. \u201cEspecially after I fell down in front of the Heir.\u201d\n Erex stared. For a moment she thought she had reached him, but then he shook his head.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t you talking, Cousin. You know the right things to say, but you must have learned them from someone else.\u201d\n Gnash it! She didn\u2019t speak the words aloud, but in her blood, anger burned with the heat of Father Varin. \u201cI am being advised by Imbati Ustin,\u201d she said. \u201cIn precisely the same way that you are advised by your Kuarmei.\u201d\n Erex glanced at his manservant. Imbati Kuarmei stood coiled and still, her face expressionless. \u201cMy Kuarmei is a gentleman\u2019s servant,\u201d Erex said. \u201cSo is Imbati Ustin.\u201d\n \u201cBy tradition. But there\u2019s no law saying she can\u2019t be mine. It would be quite simple for me to compose an inquiry.\u201d And Grivi\u2019s earnestness had convinced her of one thing. \u201cThe Imbati Service Academy would witness the contract without objection.\u201d\n Erex started to reply, thought better of it, then circled behind his desk and leaned one hand on it, frowning. With the other, he started flipping through a stack of thick papers.\n \u201cYou understand, I\u2019m sure, that I represent the Family, and it\u2019s my job to know what\u2019s best for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI would expect you to know that promoting the Race must come before our personal desires. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re feeling much better, and I\u2019m glad of that. In fact, you were always quick in recovery. We should take advantage of that, going forward.\u201d\n Now she recognized the papers, and felt Varin\u2019s heat drain out of her. Gods have mercy\u2014those were partnership solicitations. Elinda\u2019s gentle breath raised hairs on her neck, cold as the space between stars.\n This was an entirely different fight, one in which she stood alone. Xeref could no longer claim her. The law he\u2019d written to protect her was powerless. Nothing Ustin had said was remotely relevant\u2014indeed, how could it be? Even Grivi, who always swore to protect her, could do nothing here. He could only wait, and hope to keep her alive after she\u2019d already been used.\n Tears pricked in her eyes. She\u2019d been here before: sitting in just such a chair, in another office a few doors down the hall. The Arbiter of the Fourth Family Council had smiled at her paternally, indifferent to her fear of eager and powerful older men. He\u2019d told her what Erex told her own Enzyel not long ago\u2014what he was telling her now: that she should be grateful at the prospect of a partnership that would sever her from her parents and every cousin she had ever trusted.\n There was a difference, this time. Erex wasn\u2019t sending her out. He was trying to keep her in.\n \u201cI still have a family, you know,\u201d she said.\n Erex made a small, tight grimace, not exactly a smile. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\n Selemei closed both fists. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it will.\u201d\n \u201cPlease, Cousin. Let\u2019s be serious. These men are\u2014\u201d\n Selemei stood up. \u201cYes, let\u2019s be serious. I have no partner in the First Family, and that means I\u2019m not your cousin.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cI belong to the Fourth Family.\u201d\n Erex waved hands at her. \u201cSelemei, you can\u2019t mean that. Your children are First Family; surely you wouldn\u2019t wish to be separated from them!\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be. At least, not while the suit remained\u2014embroiled, as you say\u2014in the courts. I imagine that could take quite a long while. I\u2019m thirty-seven now. So many things could happen while you waste your resources on a legal fight. I could lose my fertility. I could die. I could make public statements regarding the dealings of the First Family.\u201d\n To see him twitch gave her shameful pleasure.\n \u201cOr, you could set those papers aside, and write a letter to the Eminence Indal informing him that I am Xeref\u2019s legitimate replacement.\u201d\n \u201cCrown of Mai,\u201d Erex swore. He sank back into his chair, shaking his head, but he did move the pile of papers to one side, and took up a pen and a blank sheet.\n Selemei watched him write without moving. \u201cGrivi,\u201d she whispered. Grivi moved closer, though he kept a cautious distance from Erex\u2019s Kuarmei; he watched until Erex folded the paper and instructed Kuarmei to deliver it, then returned to his station behind her shoulder.\n When Kuarmei had left the office, Erex sighed, \u201cYou\u2019re right in one sense: it would save me a great deal of trouble. It won\u2019t work, though. They\u2019ll never let you keep it.\u201d\n Selemei stood up, straightened her skirts, and took Grivi\u2019s arm. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n Selemei walked by herself. Place the cane at the same time as the left foot, shift weight, then step onto the right foot and move the cane forward. She\u2019d worked her way up\u2014from the private drawing room to the sitting room, then the bedroom and the dining room with its chairs, until she even tried walking around Pelli\u2019s room. That proved quite the challenge, since Pelli loved the shiny cane, and danced around her making wild sounds of delight\u2014and it gave her a confidence she hadn\u2019t expected. Her second turn around the sitting room, however, felt like procrastination. Corrim and Aven would be home from school soon, and she had to face some uncomfortable conversations.\n Would Brinx be angry if she interrupted his work? Would he hate her for trying to take Xeref\u2019s place?\n And how could she dismiss her Grivi, who had always stood by her, especially when she didn\u2019t know if this would last?\n Click-swish: the front door. It was still too early for the children. Unless someone was ill . . . she held her breath.\n \u201cGood afternoon, Master Brinx,\u201d came the First Houseman\u2019s voice.\n \u201cBrinx!\u201d Selemei cried. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d\n Brinx walked in through the vestibule curtain with a strange look on his face. \u201cMother, Fedron just sent me home saying I needed to talk to you. He said there was some important news for the Family, but you had to be the one to tell me.\u201d\n \u201cOh, Brinx, treasure . . . \u201d Adrenaline tingled through her spine, in her fingertips.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you taking a partner?\u201d\n \u201cNo, treasure, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s a bit more\u2014unprecedented?\u201d\n He stared at her for a second. \u201cUnprecedented? Is that why everyone\u2019s acting so weird about this? Even Erex wouldn\u2019t say a word, and I can always get him to say something.\u201d\n Selemei took the leap. \u201cTreasure, I\u2019m going to be taking your father\u2019s seat in the Cabinet meeting this afternoon, representing the First Family.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cAnd Fedron and Erex will be supporting me.\u201d I hope.\n Brinx was rarely speechless, but this time she appeared to have overwhelmed him. His attempts to respond flashed wildly across his face, one after the other. May Sirin grant that he not conclude in anger.\n \u201cPlease understand,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the Indelis proposal. Your father and I designed it . . . \u201d The words touched the unhealed wound in her heart; her voice quavered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to let Xeref\u2019s last gift to us vanish without defending it.\u201d\n \u201cOh!\u201d Brinx exclaimed, and his face melted. \u201cOh, Mother. I\u2014yes, of course it\u2019s for Father . . . \u201d He came close, wrapping his arms around her without another word. Under her cheek, his chest heaved. His arms tightened, and he gave a ragged gasp. The grief he\u2019d been trying to hide burst out, powerful as the river Endro beneath the city.\n \u201cMy treasure,\u201d she murmured. She closed her eyes and rubbed his back with her free hand, riding the river with him while he sobbed. When she opened them again, she discovered Aven and Corrim had come home without her noticing, and now stood by the vestibule curtain staring at them, perhaps in shock at seeing the eldest in tears. Selemei beckoned them into the embrace, and for a time they all held one another. Then she cleared her throat.\n \u201cLet\u2019s hang the globe.\u201d\n Brinx released her slowly, and put his arm around Corrim. Aven took Selemei\u2019s hand. They walked together through the double-doors into the private drawing room. Here, the moon-yellow of mourning was everywhere: scarves had been draped over couches and chairs, and though the gifts had been opened, the hundreds of yellow cards that had accompanied them still hung along the stone walls. In the days since the funeral, the Household had installed a wire that dangled from the stone vault of the ceiling in one corner. Someone had also clearly been listening behind the walls just now, because no sooner had they all entered than Imbati Ustin and Imbati Grivi emerged from the master bedroom. Ustin set up a stepladder beneath the wire, while Grivi brought the globe in its wooden box, and held it out to Selemei with a bow.\n \u201cPelli?\u201d Selemei called. \u201cCan you come out, big girl?\u201d\n The door to the girls\u2019 rooms opened, and Pelli trotted out with her Verrid following behind her. \u201cMama?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re going to hang the globe for your father,\u201d Selemei explained. \u201cIt\u2019s fragile and we\u2019re going to be very careful.\u201d\n \u201cCare-ful.\u201d Pelli trotted up, and patted Selemei\u2019s skirts as softly as she did her sleeping sister, laying her cheek against the silk. She then proceeded to do the same to Brinx\u2019s leg, and to Corrim and Aven.\n Selemei opened the box that Grivi still held. She extracted the globe from its padded nest, careful to protect the hook and wire attachment dangling from the top. She lifted it to her lips and kissed the engraved glass twice\u2014once for Enzyel, and once for herself. Then she passed it to Brinx for a kiss, and he passed it to Corrim; Aven took it for herself and then held it out for Pelli, with Imbati Verrid standing attentively by.\n Pelli leaned her white cheek to it and whispered, \u201cCold . . . \u201d\n Aven brought it back, then, but Selemei shook her head. \u201cThank you, darling, but I can\u2019t use the ladder. Brinx, will you hang it?\u201d\n Brinx nodded. He climbed the three steps and reached up\u2014the globe had to be hung higher than the carven cornices, or it would not appropriately represent a star\u2014and attached the hook and wire. The element at the center of the globe lit: dimmer than a wysp, promising neither cheer nor fortune, only a solemn, enduring reminder.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d said Selemei. She kissed them, eldest to youngest, each one so alive, so precious, so fragile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I need to ask you to stay out of the sitting room for a few minutes. I have to go out at four, and I\u2019d like to speak with Grivi and Ustin in private before I go.\u201d\n The two servants walked out with her. Surely they knew what this was about; surely they could see how she dreaded it. She didn\u2019t sit down, but faced them with her back to Xeref\u2019s office door. Grivi was the broader of the two, his strength evident even through his formal manservant\u2019s suit; Ustin stood out for her height, the muscles of her arms hidden inside long black sleeves. The similarity of their bodyguard stances hid the fundamental differences in training that made this conversation necessary.\n \u201cYou both know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Selemei said. You know it\u2019s crazy. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will work.\u201d\n Ustin nodded acknowledgment; Grivi remained motionless.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to try one more time to represent the First Family on the Eminence\u2019s Cabinet.\u201d Saying it sent a rush of cold up behind her ears. \u201cThis time they won\u2019t be confused. I won\u2019t have any benefit of the doubt. If I make any errors, or even if I don\u2019t, they may vote me out. Therefore, I would like to request that Ustin act as my manservant, just for this afternoon.\u201d\n \u201cI am willing,\u201d said Ustin. \u201cGrivi?\u201d\n Grivi said nothing.\n \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Grivi,\u201d said Selemei. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be unfair to you. You\u2019ve always been faithful. You have kept me upright so many times\u2014truthfully, you have kept me alive. But I have to try this.\u201d\n Grivi\u2019s reply was barely more than a whisper. \u201cMistress, you witnessed my vow of service. Please understand how difficult it is for me to watch you put yourself in danger.\u201d\n \u201cI do understand. But if I let you protect me now, I won\u2019t be able to protect anyone else. This isn\u2019t just for the sake of my own life, or even my daughters\u2019 lives, but for all the ladies of the Race. I have to try to pass the Indelis proposal. This is my wish.\u201d\n Grivi bowed. \u201cSo let it be, then. May I be excused?\u201d\n \u201cYes. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n A good deal of her courage departed with him. Just for this afternoon, she\u2019d said, but it still felt final; in good conscience she\u2019d have to consent to release Grivi from his contract if he requested it, even if she failed. She walked slowly to the nearest couch and sat down, staring at the kuarjos-board without really seeing it. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this, Ustin. I\u2019m not Xeref.\u201d\n \u201cMistress, let\u2019s focus on today,\u201d said Ustin. \u201cYou\u2019re correct in your concern: it\u2019s more than likely the cabinet will again attempt to declare the seat empty. Fedron supported you in the last vote, and I imagine he will support you again, but we can\u2019t be certain he won\u2019t have come under outside influence up to and including blackmail. For this, and for the Indelis proposal, you need to cultivate allies.\u201d\n \u201cFedron is it, though.\u201d Selemei shook her head. \u201cUnless he can bring allies of his own. I don\u2019t know any of the others. Who is the bald man? The one with the big voice\u2014he was kinder than most of them.\u201d\n \u201cThat is Cabinet Secretary Boros of the Second Family, Mistress. He had a cordial relationship with Master Xeref; they spoke often, and occasionally co-sponsored proposals. He would make an excellent ally. His good opinion is respected.\u201d\n \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, though, invite him to tea?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s time for that just now, Mistress. We should be going, so we don\u2019t have to hurry.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d\n Perhaps she\u2019d practiced too much walking today. The way to the meeting felt interminable; the cane was awkward in the cramped spiral stairway. When she reached the top, Selemei realized how far they still had to go, and huffed in frustration.\n \u201cHow did Xeref ever do this?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true the walking was easier for him, Mistress. But you must remember, he didn\u2019t do the job alone. He had four assistants.\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t imagine having assistants. \u201cAnd he had you.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d\n They passed the Heir\u2019s suite\u2014merciful Heile, please don\u2019t let the Heir come out and see me\u2014and entered the hallway. Several men stood not far ahead. Cabinet members. She was starting to recognize some of them.\n \u201cTell me who they are, Ustin,\u201d she whispered.\n \u201cYou know Secretary Boros. Behind him is Amyel of the Ninth Family, one of Master Xeref\u2019s allies. Beside him, Caredes of the Eighth Family . . . \u201d\n The men stiffened and grew quiet as they drew closer. Selemei held tighter to the handle of her cane, placed it more carefully, stepped in measured cadence with her head high. The door was just beyond them. She\u2019d have to walk between Secretary Boros and Palimeyn of the Third Family. Palimeyn was leering at her, holding something in his hand\u2014it looked like a glass, but he didn\u2019t hold it like a drink. Still several steps away from them, she hesitated.\n \u201cExcuse me, gentlemen.\u201d\n \u201cGood afternoon, Lady Selemei,\u201d said Boros.\n Palimeyn took a single step forward.\n Ustin flashed past her, and for a split second, she thought she\u2019d attacked Palimeyn. The Third Family man grunted and stumbled backwards. His manservant feinted toward Ustin, but then backed off also.\n Selemei clung to her cane, her heart pounding.\n Ustin returned. She\u2019d taken the glass; Selemei didn\u2019t like the look of its brownish contents. \u201cMy apologies, Lady.\u201d\n Boros looked between her and Palimeyn, frowning. \u201cI think we should go in,\u201d he said. \u201cLady Selemei, will you come with me?\u201d He offered his elbow.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, but placed both hands on her cane until his arm dropped. Then she followed him in, noticing that Ustin still blocked Palimeyn from approaching her. It was alarming\u2014and felt worse because Ustin had to stay behind on the threshold. Selemei ignored the staring eyes of the ancient Eminences, refusing to rush just because so many men were coming in around her, and walked steadily to Xeref\u2019s chair\u2014her chair, Mai willing. Ignoring hissed insults, she leaned her cane against the table, carefully pulled the chair out, and sat down. She almost wound her hands in the chair again, but this time, folded them in her lap. She tried to barricade her ears against the whispers, and waited for Fedron to take the seat beside her.\n Just stay calm. Just stay.\n Fedron was late. Well after the Heir and Eminence had already been seated, he backed in the door, harried by another man who must have been yelling at him for some time. She heard only, \u201c . . . if you know what\u2019s good for Varin and the Race!\u201d before the man relented and went to his seat. She counted chairs\u2014he was Fifth Family. Fedron grunted, and took the chair beside her with scarcely a glance in her direction.\n \u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d said red-faced Speaker Orn. The Manservant to the Eminence intoned his ceremonial speech; before the final words were fully out, the Fifth Family man stood up.\n \u201cFirst order of business must be the empty seat.\u201d\n Fedron grasped the edge of the table with one hand. \u201cThe seat is occupied; we already voted on this in the last session.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic, First Family,\u201d the man retorted. \u201cYou fail to bring your substitute. You bring us\u2014\u201d He waved a hand at Selemei. \u201c\u2014this, instead. You\u2019re still trying to cling to power after the battle is already lost. Well, no one\u2019s laughing.\u201d While he spoke, his gaze never left Palimeyn of the Third Family, as if everyone else were just the audience for an impending confrontation between them.\n \u201cI agree,\u201d Palimeyn said. \u201cLet\u2019s vote on the empty seat.\u201d\n The Heir said softly, \u201cYour Eminence?\u201d\n The Eminence sniffed through his noble nose. \u201cI agree; we should vote.\u201d\n Selemei shivered. This was entrapment, carefully planned, kuarjos-pieces precisely placed. The Heir was Third Family, and the Eminence was Fifth. Those two families and their representatives would have spent the days since the last meeting wearing down the other cabinet members. How many had been harassing Fedron? How long would he endure this for the sake of a female cousin?\n \u201cFine,\u201d said Speaker Orn. \u201cCast your votes.\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t watch them. These were men with years of history between them, layer upon layer of alliances and schemes, and here she\u2019d been dropped into it blindfolded.\n The Manservant to the Eminence examined his vote reporting device, and bowed. \u201cA unanimous vote is required to certify an empty seat. I count six votes in dissent. The seat remains occupied by the First Family.\u201d\n Had she heard that right? Six? For a split second she glimpsed the kuarjos-pattern: herself, standing upon her post with Fedron beside her; Third and Fifth Families attempting to surround them, but behind their backs, another, contrary configuration. Someone hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the rest of the board.\n Fedron emitted a ridiculous sound, like a strangled giggle. He cleared his throat. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled. Turn on her voting screen, please.\u201d\n The square screen lit in front of her. An instant\u2019s flash of green, then black, with a green date indicator in the upper left corner. In the upper right corner, it read, Xeref of the First Family. Selemei stiffened, bracing for the wash of grief, but by Elinda\u2019s grace, she felt only warmth.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.\n Selemei watched Fedron as they proceeded to business. His near eyebrow would rise, and he\u2019d cast her a glance, then move his finger to the vote button. It wasn\u2019t difficult, though at times it was tricky to tell when a procedural vote had been called for. Slowly, her muscles unclenched. She tried to read the potential for allyship in the expressions on the men\u2019s faces, golden or pale; she counted chairs and identified the Fourth Family\u2019s cabinet member\u2014he would be a cousin, and she should try to reach out to him, perhaps through his Lady.\n Then the Seventh Family\u2019s member brought a proposal. She stared at him unabashedly, trying to remember every word he used: \u201cPursuant to our discussions, I move for a vote on the Selimnar Imports proposal.\u201d Pursuant, and move, those were the keys she needed. She took a deep breath, and let it out slowly.\n A wysp drifted into the room, impudently, through an ancient Eminence\u2019s face.\n Let your luck come to me, wysp . . .\n Fedron leaned toward her. \u201cThe First Family supports the Selimnar Imports proposal,\u201d he whispered.\n Selemei nodded, and pressed the correct button. She waited for the Manservant to the Eminence to make his announcement of the vote result, and said it. Blood hummed in her ears; she hoped her voice wouldn\u2019t crack.\n \u201cPursuant to our discussions, I move for a vote on the Indelis proposal. In memory of Xeref of the First Family.\u201d\n Discomfort shifted through the men. Someone down the table to her left muttered, \u201cVarin\u2019s teeth.\u201d But many faces fell solemn at mention of Xeref, and those men might support her. One of them was bald-headed Secretary Boros.\n \u201cI\u2019ll second,\u201d said Fedron.\n On the screen in front of her, the words appeared: Indelis proposal, brought by Xeref of the First Family.\n She pressed her button in support.\n For you, love.\n The Manservant to the Eminence bowed. \u201cI count four votes in support, twelve in dissent. The measure is retired.\u201d\n Selemei sat, unable to breathe for several seconds. She wanted to scream, or run, but this was no longer blood in her veins\u2014it was some awful distillation of grief and shame. The air tasted of dust.\n Fedron nudged her. \u201cSelemei. Next vote, support.\u201d\n These were someone else\u2019s hands, fingers pressed to the table surface in front of her. No, they were hers, just impossible to move. Next vote, support. She forced one up, pressed the button. Made herself heartless, a machine to act at Fedron\u2019s instructions, while passing seconds pulled her inexorably away from the moment when it should have gone right.\n No rockfall could have crushed her heart more utterly than this failure. Selemei lay exhausted on her bed, feeling its beat inside her chest, wondering why it still persisted. She\u2019d failed to save Enzyel and Keir from the duties that would inevitably tear their bodies apart; she\u2019d failed to save Lienne from the draining obligation that had so embittered her sister. The Race\u2019s decline ground on, loved ones were plucked away, and one day only Pyaras would remember his mother\u2019s name.\n \u201cMistress,\u201d said Ustin quietly.\n Selemei heaved a sigh. \u201cWhat is it, Ustin?\u201d\n \u201cIf you permit me to hear what happened, I may be able to advise you.\u201d\n The suggestion was made mildly enough, but anger flashed inside her. Selemei pushed up on one elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re always one step ahead, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said. \u201cHere I\u2019ve been thinking you guess what I want before I do, but really, you planned this whole thing. Why would you push me? Was it so you could wield power by being close to a cabinet member?\u201d\n Ustin replied coolly. \u201cI have served a cabinet member already for twelve years, Mistress. My Master cannot speak for me, but I believe he would vouch for the quality of my service. For more, you would have to contact the Service Academy. I am certain they could quickly find me other employment.\u201d\n Guilt quenched her anger. Of course the Service Academy would stand by Ustin\u2019s certification. And naturally someone who had been privy to the First Family\u2019s cabinet secrets would be a coveted prize for a new employer. Xeref had said she does her job too well. Even now, Selemei couldn\u2019t see how serving well could be a flaw.\n She sat up. \u201cMy fault,\u201d she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have accused you. I remember you saying you believed in the goals of the Indelis proposal. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that you\u2019d want me to carry out Xeref\u2019s plan once he was gone.\u201d\n Ustin\u2019s brows rose, arching her manservant\u2019s mark. \u201cMistress, I shall presume.\u201d\n Selemei steeled herself. When Grivi had taken her in confidence, it had been shocking enough; but Ustin was a formidable weapon intended for gentlemen, her loyalty pledged to no one. \u201cPlease do.\u201d\n \u201cMistress, the Indelis proposal was entirely your idea,\u201d Ustin said. \u201cIf you recall, I was not welcome at the confirmation party for your small cousin, but I stayed in the Maze and listened in case I was needed, and I heard what you said to the gentlemen of the First Family Council.\u201d She struck reciting stance, one hand held behind her back. \u201c\u2018Some of us are giving our efforts, while others are giving up our health, and others, like Lady Indelis, have given their lives. I imagine you could think of some way to protect our mothers better. Aren\u2019t you all men of importance?\u2019\u201d\n \u201cMai\u2019s truth,\u201d Selemei whispered. She recognized every word, but in the Imbati\u2019s voice, they had changed from a frustrated outburst to a powerful demand. Her skin prickled.\n \u201cEspecially after your act of courage in refusing further duties, your words struck Master Xeref deeply,\u201d said Ustin. \u201cYou are why he created the proposal, and why he named it for Lady Indelis. He may have put your idea into the proper language of legislation, but even then, you persisted until you approved of its terms, because you understood what would benefit the ladies of the Grobal in a way he did not.\u201d\n Selemei shook her head, amazed. Intentionally or not, Ustin had just answered a question that she\u2019d been unable to forget. \u201cSo, that\u2019s why you came in to find me while Pelli was sleeping. You wanted to talk to me about my courage.\u201d\n Ustin looked her in the eye. \u201cCourage is like a wysp,\u201d she said. \u201cIt moves through barriers.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t move through this one,\u201d Selemei sighed. \u201cThe Indelis proposal has been retired.\u201d\n \u201cRetired,\u201d Ustin agreed solemnly, \u201cwith a vote of fourteen to one.\u201d\n That wasn\u2019t right. Selemei frowned. \u201cNo; the vote was twelve to four.\u201d\n Ustin\u2019s eyes widened. The corners of her mouth bent slightly upwards. But they didn\u2019t stop there; her lips parted over her teeth, and she was smiling\u2014really, truly smiling. Selemei had only seen her Imbati nurse-escort smile once, after she\u2019d gone to a public event at age five and been very, very good. Now, as then, it was puzzling and strangely exciting. Selemei got to her feet.\n \u201cUstin, what is it?\u201d\n \u201cMistress, you won.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Of course I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cRespectfully, Mistress, I differ.\u201d\n Selemei stared at her. \u201cAll right, Ustin, explain.\u201d\n Ustin inclined her head. \u201cMistress, you presented yourself before the cabinet. You claimed the at-large seat. You negotiated for and won the First Family\u2019s support. You attended today\u2019s meeting, even though Grobal Palimeyn tried to sabotage you. And in spite of cooperation between Third and Fifth families to stop you, you kept your seat and were permitted to vote.\u201d\n \u201cUstin, I have been nothing but humiliated. The Heir knocked me down at the last meeting. Palimeyn of the Third Family would have succeeded today if you hadn\u2019t stopped him. My proposal failed miserably.\u201d\n \u201cMistress, a man who intended to stop a threat from a rival might hire an assassin. Grobal Palimeyn only intended to throw blood on you, to force you home to change your clothes.\u201d\n Her stomach lurched. \u201cHeile have mercy.\u201d\n \u201cI can only conclude that your fall was effective in convincing them that you do not pose a real threat. Your failure to pass the proposal today has no doubt sealed that impression. Their goal was to weaken the First Family; now they believe they have succeeded. But you managed to attract three allies with no effort at all, and now you sit among them, wielding a voice and a vote.\u201d With the grace of long practice, Ustin got to her knees and bowed her tattooed forehead all the way to the floor. \u201cPlease, Lady. Accept my vow of service. I would be honored to continue to serve the First Family\u2019s cabinet member.\u201d\n Selemei\u2019s heart pounded. Suddenly, everything looked different. Yes, she\u2019d sponsored a proposal that had been retired. It had felt like the end\u2014but maybe it didn\u2019t have to be.\n With a voice and a vote, now she could negotiate laws over years. The next time she walked into a meeting, she need not be a machine. She could be a cabinet member the same way she was a mother: falling and standing up again, yet always persisting, nurturing the future.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI accept.\u201d\n Juliette Wade combined a trip to the Gouffre de Padirac with her academic background in linguistics and anthropology to create the world of Varin, a grand experiment in speculative ethnography.

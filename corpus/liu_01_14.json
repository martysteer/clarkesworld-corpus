Alara was a backwater, barely inhabited, and insignificant to galactic politics. It would take days, perhaps weeks, to walk out of here, stumble into a few colonists, and pretend to be near starvation. Enough time to make up any backstory and make it believable.\n Ryder flexed his slender arms and stretched, the movements graceful, dancelike. The strict manner in which he had been bound during the ship\u2019s last jump through hyperspace didn\u2019t seem to have any lasting ill effects.\n He gave Alex a long, appraising look. \u201cWhat will you tell my father?\u201d\n She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll give him his money back.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve never failed before, have you?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s always a first time. I\u2019m human. I\u2019m not perfect.\u201d She began to climb back into the ship.\n \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\n She stopped halfway up the ladder and looked down at him.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be sure?\u201d he asked, that characteristic smirk playing at the corners of his delicate mouth again. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to ask to see me as I really am?\u201d\n She considered this. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve already decided to believe you. Trying to make sure can only make things worse. If I find out that you\u2019re telling the truth, then I will have ruined this moment, when I can still believe I\u2019m capable of being decent, of trust. If I find out you\u2019re lying, then I\u2019ll have to consider myself a fool.\u201d\n \u201cSo, again you choose faith before knowledge.\u201d\n This time, she didn\u2019t stop climbing. When she was at the airlock door, she turned around. \u201cFaith is just another name for self-knowledge. You\u2019ve succeeded, Scheherazade. When you tell your own story, you seize life. Now it\u2019s my turn to tell myself a good story, about myself. I know enough. Goodbye.\u201d\n Ryder watched as the ship rose, shrank, and disappeared into the evening sky. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.\n Then he set off into the dark jungle, just another wanderer, a lonely will etching his way across the wilderness.\n A few hours earlier:\n \u201cThe Clockwork Soldier\u201dA short interactive text adventure by RyderYou sleep, a smile at the corners of your mouth.In your dreams, the concentric layers of carp-scale shingles on the Palace\u2019s roof reflect the golden light so brilliantly that visitors to Chrysanthemum know right away how the city got its name.The Princess\u2019s BedroomYou open your eyes and find yourself in bed. The blanket is silky smooth and the mattress soft.Like most rooms in the Palace, this one is lined with colorful tapestries depicting the heroic deeds of the Hegemons of the Pan-Flores League. Through a narrow slit-window high off the floor, the brilliant morning sunlight diffuses into the room, as does the chittering of birds and the smell of a thousand blooming flowers in the garden. The door to the hallway is closed right now.Next to the bed is your clockwork soldier, Spring, standing at attention.> examine soldierYour faithful companion Spring has been with you as long as you can remember. He\u2019s six feet tall and looks like a living suit of armor. You remember once opening him up when you were younger, and being amazed at the thousands upon thousands of whirling gears and ticking governors and tightly-wound springs inside.You giggle as you remember the many adventures you\u2019ve shared together over the years. You\u2019ve taught Spring everything he knows, and he\u2019s saved you from too many scrapes to count.> get upYou get out of the bed.> say \u201chello\u201d(to Spring)\u201cGood morning,\u201d says Spring. \u201cI know that sometimes you like to go by a different name for fun. What name would you like to go by today?\u201d(Please enter your name)> Alex\u201cAlex it is,\u201d Spring says. His voice sounds . . . rusty, lugubrious. He shuffles in place, the gears inside him clanging and scraping against each other. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I seem to be in a bad mood today.\u201d> ask about mood\u201cWhy are you feeling down?\u201d you ask. A good princess needs to be concerned about the state of mind of her subjects\u2014er, toys.\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just feel . . . like a part of me is missing.\u201d\u201cDid a bolt loosen and fall out? Were you not oiled properly? Did I forget to wind you last night?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s none of those things. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d> look under bedA few dust bunnies scurry out of your way.> look behind tapestriesThe walls are made of solid stone. No hidden passages, as far as you can see.> examine SpringHe looks fine, if a bit morose.> cheer up Spring\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have an adventure today?\u201d you ask. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find what you want in the rest of the Palace?\u201dSpring nods. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d> exit bedroomHallwayThe hallway is lit by torches along the wall. To the east is the grand staircase. To the west, some distance down the dimly lit hallway, are two doors.Spring follows you into the hallway, the loud clangs of his footsteps echoing around the stone walls.> ask Spring for direction\u201cYou decide,\u201d says Spring. \u201cYou always do.\u201d> westHallwaySpring clangs after you.> westHallwaySpring clangs after you. Then he sighs, sounding like steel wool being rubbed against a grille.> ask Spring about sigh\u201cDon\u2019t you like following me around?\u201d you ask.\u201cFollowing you around today has not activated as many microlevers inside me as usual.\u201d Spring pauses, the gears humming and grinding inside him. \u201cI suppose, logically, we can try having me lead instead of follow.\u201d(Allow Spring to lead?)> yes\u201cWhy do you tantalize me with the impossible?\u201d Spring says. \u201cWe both know I can\u2019t. I\u2019m an automaton.\u201dSpring shakes his head from side to side, and the loud, grinding noise makes you cover your ears.\u201cI am so sad that I can no longer move,\u201d Spring says.> examineThe hallway is narrow and windowless but not damp or dark. The torches in the walls provide flickering illumination. The smell of rose otto permeates the air.> westHallwaySpring stays behind, immobile.> eastHallwayYou see Spring in the middle of the hallway, looking like a heap of rusty metal.> inventoryYou are empty-handed.> look for oilThere is no clockwork oil in the hallway.(Come on. First puzzles in interactive text adventures are often easy, but not this easy.)> look for source of rose ottoThe fragrance of rose otto permeates the air.The essence of rose is distilled from the garden outside the Palace by the gardener and his helpers every morning. The Castellan, your father\u2019s head clockwork servant, applies it liberally to combat the problem of mildew in enclosed spaces around the Palace. When activated by heat, it can make any place smell fresh and comfortable.> pick up a torchYou take one of the torches out of the sconces on the wall.> examine torchYou lean in close to look at the torch, and the fire singes your lovely, chestnut hair.Spring groans.> put out torch against the floorYou extinguish the torch. The hallway is now fractionally cooler.> examine torchThe torch is cleverly designed by the Royal Artificer. The body of the torch is hollow to hold the slow-burning oil, and a smaller compartment near the top holds rose otto.> get oil from torchYou stick your hand into the hollow body of the torch and . . .\u201cOw! Ow!\u201d You hop around. Your hand is covered in hot oil. You\u2019re likely to injure your hand if you don\u2019t get rid of it quickly.> apply oil to SpringYou slather the hot oil over the joints in Spring\u2019s face and torso.Spring stands up.> ask Spring about mood\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d you say, since Spring doesn\u2019t seem inclined to thank you. That\u2019s very uncharacteristic of him, but maybe he\u2019s still feeling down.\u201cThank you,\u201d Spring says. The voice is smooth, but you detect a hint of resentment. \u201cI just wish I had decided to get the oil myself.\u201d\u201cI can order the Royal Artificer to modify your tape and give you the instructions to get oil when you feel rusty,\u201d you say.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I wish I had come up with the idea myself. I wish I could punch my own instruction-tape.\u201dFear, or maybe it\u2019s an appetite for thrill, rises in you. \u201cAre you suggesting that you wish to be endowed with the Augustine Module and cross the Cartesian Limit? You know that\u2019s forbidden, and any automata found to have crossed the line must be destroyed.\u201dSpring says nothing.\u201cBut maybe what you\u2019re missing is a chance to do the forbidden,\u201d you muse to yourself.> westOutside the King\u2019s and Queen\u2019s BedroomsThe door to the King\u2019s bedroom (in the northern wall) is made of solid oak. Carved into the door is the figure of a man with two faces\u2014one laughing, one crying. The four eyes on the two faces are inlaid with emeralds.The door to the Queen\u2019s bedroom (in the southern wall) is made of pale ash. The figure of a leaping hare is carved into it. Your mother died when you were born, and the room has been sealed off for as long as you can remember. It\u2019s too painful for the King to set foot inside.Spring clangs after you.> northThe door is locked.> southThe door is locked.> knock on door to the north.There is no answer.Spring shifts his weight from one leg to the other.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou know the King is away at Wolfsbane for the coronation of Prince Ulu, three days ride away. All the clockwork servants are away to be maintained by the Royal Artificer this morning. You\u2019re alone in the Palace.\u201d> kick door to the north.Ouch! The door barely moves, but you\u2019re hopping around on one foot, crying out. Kicking at doors is not something silk slippers are very well-suited for.A series of metallic clangs come from Spring. You can see he\u2019s trying hard to stop his quivering torso.\u201cLaugh it up,\u201d you say, wincing at the pain. \u201cLaugh it up.\u201d> ask Spring to open door.Spring lumbers into the door, and it smashes into a million little pieces on contact. Where the door used to be there\u2019s now just a big hole.\u201cI had in mind something a little less destructive,\u201d you say.\u201cJust following orders,\u201d Spring says.\n Alex whirls around in her chair at the beep-beep-beep of the proximity alarm. She sees the slender figure of Ryder in the doorway of the cabin, leaning against the frame.\n She\u2019s about to apologize for snooping when she notices the smirk on Ryder\u2019s face. Why should I apologize? He\u2019s a prisoner on my ship.\n She stands up from the chair. \u201cI needed to see what you\u2019ve been up to on this computer. You\u2019ve been using it practically nonstop. A security precaution\u2014I\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d\n He comes into the small room. Alex reaches down to shut off the proximity alarm so that the rapid beeping stops. He\u2019s about her height, slender of build and with delicate features. That teenaged face, so heartbreakingly beautiful, vulnerable, and young, reminds her of her son. A wave of tenderness surfaces in her before she becomes aware of it and dams it away. She realizes suddenly how little she knows about him, despite chasing after him all these weeks and then capturing him. From time to time, she\u2019s seen him tending to the plants in the herbal garden\u2014a small luxury that she allowed herself\u2014with care though she has never told him to do it. Other than that, he\u2019s been holed up in his room.\n Like with all her prey, she\u2019s been avoiding having much interaction with him.\n He\u2019s cargo, she reminds herself, worth a lot of money. A bounty hunter who forgets her job doesn\u2019t last very long.\n \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d she says, and starts to move around him to get to the door.\n \u201cWait!\u201d he says. The smirk is gone, replaced by a hesitant, shy smile. \u201cI wanted to tell you that I appreciate your giving me the run of the ship instead of locking me up in a windowless cell or drugging me.\u201d He pauses, and then adds, \u201cAlso, thanks for not roughing me up.\u201d\n She shrugs. \u201cYour father\u2019s orders were very clear. You\u2019re not to be injured or harmed in any way. Not even a scratch on your skin.\u201d\n \u201cMy father.\u201d His face becomes expressionless, like a mask. \u201cHe told you not to injure me, did he? Well, of course he would.\u201d\n Alex gives him a thoughtful, but hard, gaze. \u201cBut if I feel you\u2019re endangering my life, don\u2019t you think for a moment I wouldn\u2019t put you down.\u201d\n Ryder lifts his hands in a placating gesture. \u201cI\u2019ve been good. I promise.\u201d\n \u201cHonestly, you\u2019re not much of a fighter. Besides, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anywhere for you to go while we\u2019re in hyperspace. Why not let you stretch your legs around the ship?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not curious about why I ran away and why my father has gone to so much trouble to catch me?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m paid to get you back to him in one piece,\u201d Alex says, \u201cnot to ask questions. In my profession, being curious is not always a virtue.\u201d Also, she adds to herself, families are impossible for outsiders to understand.\n The smirk is back on his face. He points to the terminal that Alex was using. \u201cYou were curious about that.\u201d\n \u201cI told you, a security precaution.\u201d\n \u201cYou would have found out that it\u2019s nothing dangerous within a few seconds. But you played for a while.\u201d\n \u201cI got pulled in,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a game, and on this little ship, I get as bored as you.\u201d\n He laughs. \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d\n She considers the question and decides there\u2019s nothing wrong with giving him her honest opinion. A privileged kid like that probably never hears any real criticism. \u201cThe set up is good, but the pacing is off. The language is self-indulgent in places, and the Pinocchio storyline is a bit clich\u00e9d. Still, I think it has potential.\u201d\n He nods, acknowledging her feedback. \u201cThis is my first time telling a story in this way. Maybe I\u2019ve added too much.\u201d\n \u201cYou came up with it yourself?\u201d\n \u201cIn a manner of speaking. You\u2019re right that it\u2019s not completely original.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d like to play more of it,\u201d she says, surprising even herself.\n \u201cGo ahead, and keep on telling me what works and what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n > enter King\u2019s bedroomThe King\u2019s BedroomThe King\u2019s bedroom is large, cavernous even. The Grand Hall is for banquets and stately receptions, but here\u2019s where he conducts real business and gives the orders that will change the course of history. (Insofar as issuing an edict announcing a new tax credit for woodcarvers and novel spell-casting research can be deemed to be changing history.)In the middle of the room is a large bed\u2014well, might as well call it king-sized. Around the room are many cabinets filled with many more drawers, all unlabeled, all alike. There\u2019s also a writing desk next to the window. The window is very wide and very open, contrary to proper secure palace design principles. But as a result, the room is flooded with light.Usually this room is filled with people: ministers, guards, generals just back from the front seeking an audience with the King. You\u2019ve never been here alone before.Spring clangs in after you.\u201cWe\u2019re going to look for the Augustine Module,\u201d you say. \u201cThat ought to cheer you up, right?\u201dSpring says nothing.> examine cabinetsThey all look the same. The rows of drawers lining them look, if possible, even more alike. You\u2019re not sure which one to start with.> pick one at randomI only understand you want to pick something.> open drawerWhich drawer do you mean?> open all drawersThere are too many drawers to pick from.\n \u201cRyder, I used to play a lot of old games like this. Your puzzles really need some work.\u201d\n \u201cYou want a hint?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not. What would be the point? Might as well have you tell me the story yourself.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d\n Alex looks at Ryder. This is a boy who probably doesn\u2019t like to get his hands dirty. He would be used to the many servants and droids back in his father\u2019s house. Like a princess.\n > go to nearest drawer and open itIf you\u2019re thinking of opening every drawer one by one, the King will be back before you\u2019re done.> Damn it, this is terrible programming!Spring shifts from one foot to the other behind you.\u201cDid you say something about programming?\u201d> ask Spring about programming\u201cSince I\u2019m a non-Cartesian automaton, you can control my behavior with programs.\u201d Spring\u2019s voice is dreary and grinds on your ears.You step up to Spring and open up his front panel, revealing the spinning gears and rocking levers within, as well as reams of densely-punched instructional tape.(As a shortcut, you may engage in programming in pseudocode and we\u2019ll pretend that they\u2019re translated into the right patterns of holes on tape\u2014otherwise we\u2019d be here forever.)> TELL Spring the following:>> WHILE (any drawer is not open)>> PICK a closed drawer at random>> OPEN the drawer>> TAKE OUT everything>> END WHILE>>END TELLSpring springs to life and rushes around the room, opening random drawers and dumping the contents on the ground. The floor shakes as his bulk thumps back and forth. Eventually he finishes opening every drawer in the room and stops.\u201cYour father is not going to be happy about this,\u201d he says.> examine roomThere are too many things scattered all over the floor to list them one by one. In fact, you can\u2019t even see the floor.> TELL Spring to sort objects in room by typeSpring whips around the room, sorting objects into neat piles: there\u2019s a pile of books, a pile of jewels, a pile of secret files, a pile of parchments, a pile of clothes, a pile of shoes, a pile of nuts (why not? They make good snacks).\u201cThanks,\u201d you say.\u201cNo problem,\u201d Spring says. \u201cAutomata are good for this kind of thing.\u201d> TELL Spring to look for Augustine Module\u201cSee, now you\u2019re just being lazy,\u201d Spring says. \u201cI have no idea what an Augustine Module looks like.\u201d\n \u201cVery clever,\u201d Alex says.\n \u201cWhich part?\u201d Ryder looks pleased.\n \u201cYour game lures the player into relying on doing everything by ordering a non-player character around. I suppose this is supposed to get the player to feel a sense of participation in the plight of the oppressed automata in your world? Inducing empathy and guilt is the hardest thing to get right in a game.\u201d\n Ryder laughs. \u201cThanks. Maybe you\u2019re giving me too much credit. I was just trying to make the time pass somehow. Sometimes the inevitable end doesn\u2019t seem so scary if you can keep the silence at bay with a story.\u201d\n \u201cLike that girl with the stories and the Sultan,\u201d she says. She almost adds and death but catches herself.\n Ryder nods. \u201cI told you. It\u2019s not a very original idea.\u201d\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t some political commentary on your father\u2019s opposition to strong AI, is it? You\u2019re one of those free-droiders.\u201d She\u2019s used to her prey telling her stories to try to get her to be on their side, to let them go. Using a game to do it is at least a new tactic.\n Ryder looks away. \u201cMy father and I didn\u2019t discuss politics much.\u201d\n When he speaks again, his tone is upbeat, and Alex gets the impression he\u2019s trying to change the subject. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you caught on so quick. The text-based user interface is primitive, but it\u2019s the best I can do given what I have to work with.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I was little, my mother allowed only text-based streams on the time-sharing entertainment clusters because she didn\u2019t want us to see and covet all the fancy things we couldn\u2019t afford to buy.\u201d Alex pauses. It\u2019s not like her to reveal a lot of private history to one of her prey. Ryder\u2019s game has unsettled her for some reason. What\u2019s more, Ryder is the son of the most powerful man on Pele, and she resents the possibility that he might pity her childhood in the slums. She hurries on, trying to disguise her discomfort. \u201cSometimes the best visuals and sims can\u2019t touch plain text. How did you learn to write one?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you allow me access to any advanced systems on your ship,\u201d he says, spreading his hands innocently. \u201cAnyway, I always preferred old toys as a kid: wooden blocks, paper craft, programming antique computers. I guess I just like old-fashioned things.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned myself,\u201d she says.\n \u201cI noticed. You don\u2019t have any androids to help you out on the ship. Even the flight systems are barely automated.\u201d\n \u201cI find droids creepy,\u201d she says. \u201cThe skin and flesh feel real, warm and inviting. But then you get to the glowing electronics underneath, the composite skeleton, the thudding pump that simulates a heartbeat as it circulates the nutrient fluid that functions like blood.\u201d\n \u201cSounds like you had a bad experience with them.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s just say that there was one time I had to kill a lot of androids used as decoys to get to the real deal.\u201d\n His face takes on an intense look. \u201cYou said \u2018kill\u2019 instead of \u2018deactivate\u2019 or something like that. You think they\u2019re alive?\u201d\n The turn in the conversation is unexpected, and she wonders if he\u2019s manipulating her somehow. But she can\u2019t see what the angle is. \u201cIt\u2019s just the word that came to mind. They look alive; they act alive; they feel alive.\u201d\n \u201cBut they\u2019re not really alive,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as their neural nets do not surpass the PKD-threshold, androids aren\u2019t self-aware and can\u2019t be deemed conscious.\u201d\n \u201cGood thing making supra-PKD androids is illegal,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise people like you would be accusing me of murder.\u201d\n \u201cHow do you know you\u2019ve never killed one? Just because they\u2019re illegal doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t made.\u201d\n She considers this for a moment. Then shrugs. \u201cIf I can\u2019t tell the difference, it doesn\u2019t matter. No jury on Pele would convict me anyway for killing an android, supra-PKD or not.\u201d\n \u201cYou sound like my father, all this talk of laws and appearances. Don\u2019t you ever think deeper than that?\u201d\n Can this be the secret that divided father from son? Youthful contempt for the lack of idealism in the old? \u201cI don\u2019t need a lecture from you, and I'm certainly not interested in philosophy. I don\u2019t care for androids much; I\u2019m just glad I can get rid of them when I need to. A lot of my targets these days pay for android decoys to throw me off\u2014I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Ryder says. The vehemence in his voice surprises her. It\u2019s the most emotional she\u2019s ever seen him, even more than when she had caught him hiding in the slums on the dark side of Ranginui\u2014it hadn\u2019t been that hard to find him; when the senior senator from Pele wanted someone found, there were resources not otherwise available. When Alex had called out his real name in the crowded hostel, Ryder had looked surprised for a moment, but then quickly appeared resigned, the light in his eyes dimming.\n \u201cTo make them die for you,\u201d he continues, his voice breaking, \u201cto . . . use them that way.\u201d\n \u201cIn your case,\u201d Alex says dispassionately, \u201cdecoys would have helped you out and made my life harder, but I suppose you didn\u2019t get to take much money when you ran away from home. You need to spend a lot to get them custom made to look like you. Bad game plan on your part.\u201d\n \u201cIs your job just a game to you? A thrilling hunt?\u201d\n Alex doesn\u2019t lose her cool. She\u2019s used to histrionics from her prey. \u201cI don\u2019t usually defend myself, but I don\u2019t usually talk this much with one of my prey either. I live by the bounty hunter\u2019s code: whether something feels right or wrong changes depending on who\u2019s telling the story, but what doesn\u2019t change is that we have a role to play in someone else\u2019s story\u2014bringer of justice, villain, minor functionary. We\u2019re never the stars of the stories we\u2019re in, so it\u2019s our job to play that role as well as we can.\n \u201cThe people I\u2019m paid to catch are the stars of their own stories. And they\u2019ve all chosen to do something that would make my clients want to pay to have them found. They made a decision, and they must live with the consequences. That is all I need to know. They run, and I pursue. It\u2019s as fair a fight as life can give you.\u201d\n When Ryder speaks again, his voice is calm and cool, as if the outburst never happened. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about this. Let me work on the game some more. Maybe you\u2019ll like what happens next better.\u201d\n They hold each other\u2019s gaze for a long moment. Then Alex shrugs and leaves the room.\n \n > examine pile of books\n There are treatises on the History of Chrysanthemum, the Geography of the World, the Habits of Sheep (Including Diseases and Treatment Thereof), and the Practice of Building Clockwork Automata . . .\n > read History of Chrysanthemum\n You flip the thin book open to a random page, and begin to read:\n \n \n Thereafter Chrysanthemum became the Hegemon of the Pan-Flores League, holding sway over all the cities of the peninsula. The Electors from all the cities choose a head of the league from the prominent citizens of Chrysanthemum. Though elected, the league head continued to hold the title of King. The election campaigns often kept those who would be King far from home as they curried favor with the Electors in each member city.\n \n \n > read Sheep book\n From behind you, Spring says, \u201cWhy are you reading about sheep instead of figuring out how to help me?\u201d\n > read Clockwork Automata\n You flip open the heavy book, and the creased spine leads naturally to a page, one apparently often examined.\n \n \n St. Augustine wrote, \u201cIt is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, \u2018He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good.\u2019\u201d\n The Augustine Module is a small jewel that, when inserted into an automaton, endows the automaton with free will. A pulsing, shimmering, rainbow-hued crystal about the size of a walnut, it is found only in the depths of the richest diamond mines. The laws of the realm forbid the production of such automata, for it is only the place of God, not Man, to endow creatures with free will.\n Miners believe that the presence of the Augustine Module may be detected by the use of the HCROT. By the principle of sympathetic vibration, a HCROT is equipped with a crystal that, when heated, will vibrate near the presence of any Augustine Module. The closer the module is to the HCROT, the stronger the vibrations.\n \n \n > ask Spring about HCROT\n Spring shakes his head. \u201cNever heard of it.\u201d\n > examine pile of jewels\n There are rubies, sapphires, pearls, corals, opals, emeralds. Their beauty is dazzling.\n Spring speaks up, \u201cI don\u2019t think your father would store an Augustine Module here.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d you ask.\n \u201cEvery year, he issues ever more severe edicts against the use of the Augustine Module in the construction of automata. Why would he store any here, where his ministers and generals might find them?\u201d\n \n \u201cYou really don\u2019t like your father\u2019s politics, do you?\u201d asks Alex.\n \u201cI told you: we didn\u2019t talk about politics much.\u201d\n \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question. I think it really bugs you that your father advocates against sentience for androids. But you know that Pele is a conservative world. He has to say certain things to get elected.\u201d A thought occurs to her. \u201cMaybe your secret is that you know something about him that will destroy his political career, and he doesn\u2019t want you to be used by his enemies. What is it? Does he have a droid lover? Maybe one that\u2019s supra-PKD?\u201d Now she is mildly curious.\n Ryder laughs bitterly.\n \u201cNo, that\u2019s too obvious,\u201d Alex muses. \u201cIt\u2019s all in your game. Was there really a toy soldier? A childhood companion you wanted to make fully alive but your father wouldn\u2019t budge on? Is that what this is all about?\u201d As she speaks, Alex can feel anger rise in herself. The whole thing seems frivolous, utterly absurd. Ryder was a spoiled rich little kid whose daddy issues amounted to not getting his way about some toy.\n \u201cI never got to see my father much,\u201d Ryder says. \u201cIt seemed that he was always out traveling around Pele, campaigning for re-election. I spent a lot of time at home with androids. I grew up with them.\u201d\n \u201cSo you felt close to them,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWhile you were fretting about \u2018freedom\u2019 for your toys, there were people worried sick about how to feed their children outside your mansion. How can a human compete against an android who\u2019s just as creative and resourceful when the human needs rest, might get hurt, might get sick? Your father pushed hard against sentience for androids so that actual people, real people like my parents, would still have jobs.\u201d\n Ryder does not flinch away from Alex\u2019s gaze. \u201cThe world is filled with multitudes of suffering, and we are limited by our station in life to focus on what we can. You\u2019re right: since the androids aren\u2019t sentient, no one thinks there\u2019s anything wrong with exploiting them the way we are. But we can make them sentient with almost no effort; we\u2019ve known how to cross the PKD-threshold for decades. We simply choose not to. You don\u2019t see a problem with that?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cMy father would agree with you. He would say there\u2019s a difference between acts of omission and commission. Withholding from the androids what they could be easily given, unlike taking away what has already been given, does not constitute a moral harm. But I happen to disagree.\u201d\n \u201cI told you,\u201d Alex says, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in philosophy.\u201d\n \u201cAnd so we continue to engage in slavery by a philosophical sleight of hand, through deprivation.\u201d\n The flight computer crackles to life. \u201cExiting hyperspace in half an hour.\u201d\n Alex looks at Ryder, her face cold. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n They proceed together to the cockpit, where Alex waits for Ryder to lie down in the passenger seat. \u201cHands on the armrests. I have to secure you,\u201d she says.\n Ryder looks up at her, his delicate features settling into a look of sorrow. \u201cAll these days on the same ship and you still don\u2019t trust me?\u201d\n \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a move, re-entry is the time to do it. I can\u2019t take a chance. Sorry.\u201d She activates the chair\u2019s restraint system and flexible bands shoot out from the chair to wrap themselves around Ryder\u2019s shoulders, hips, chest, legs. The bands tighten and Ryder groans. Alex is unmoved.\n As Alex reaches the door of the cockpit, Ryder calls after her, \u201cYou\u2019re really going to turn me over to my father when you don\u2019t even know what this is about?\u201d\n \u201cI understand enough to know I don\u2019t care about your pet cause.\u201d\n \u201cI began my life with stories others told me: where I come from, who I am, who I should be. I\u2019ve simply decided to tell my own story. Is that so wrong?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to judge the right or wrong of it. I know what I need to know.\u201d\n \u201cIt is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know.\u201d\n She says nothing and leaves the cockpit.\n She knows she should get ready for re-entry and check on the flight systems one last time before securing herself in the pilot\u2019s chair.\n But she turns back to the terminal. There\u2019s still a bit of time. She won\u2019t admit it to Ryder, but she does want to know how the game ends, even if it\u2019s probably nothing more than the self-indulgent ravings of a disappointed child.\n \u201cBut my father must be storing the contraband Augustine Modules he\u2019s seized somewhere in the Palace,\u201d you say. \u201cThe question is where.\u201d\u201cWhat room have you never been inside of?\u201d> southOutside the King\u2019s and Queen\u2019s BedroomsSpring clangs after you.> TELL Spring to break down the door to Queen\u2019s bedroom\u201cAs you wish, Princess.\u201dSpring charges against the door and, amazingly, the door holds for a second. Then it crumbles.> enter Queen\u2019s bedroomThe Queen\u2019s BedroomYou can\u2019t remember ever having been inside the Queen\u2019s bedroom. The bed, the dressers, and the cabinets are all faded, as if the color has been leached out of them. There\u2019s layer of dust over everything, and cobwebs hang from the ceiling and the furniture. The tapestries hanging against the walls have been chewed into filigree by moths.There\u2019s a painting hanging on the wall next to the window. Under the painting is a desk full of cubbyholes stuffed with parchment.> examine paintingYou make your way through the musty room to look at the painting. The dust motes you\u2019ve disturbed twirl though the air, lit only by a few bright beams coming through cracks in the shutters.The man in the painting is your father, the King. He looks very handsome with his crown and ermine robe. He sits with a young girl on his lap.\u201cShe looks like you,\u201d says Spring.\u201cShe does,\u201d you say. The girl in the painting is five or six, but you don\u2019t remember sitting with your father for this portrait.> examine cubbyholes in deskYou retrieve the sheets of parchment from the cubbyholes. They look like a stack of letters.> examine lettersYou read aloud from the first letter.\n \n My Darling,\n I am sorry to hear that you\u2019re unwell. But I simply cannot leave the campaign to come home right now. By all signs, the election will be close. Not that I expect you to understand, but if I leave here, Cedric will be able to convince the Electors of Peony that they should throw their support behind him.\n You must listen to the Castellan and not give the clockwork servants any trouble.\n Your ever-loving father.\n \n \n Spring shuffles behind you.\n \u201cCedric challenged your father four years ago,\u201d Spring says.\n \u201cI don\u2019t remember being sick then,\u201d you say. \u201cOr writing to him.\u201d\n In fact, you don\u2019t remember much about the election at all. You remember reading about it and hearing others talk about it. But now that you think about it, you have no personal memories from that time at all.\n You don\u2019t like the strange feeling in your heart, so you try to change the subject.\n \u201cI think we should look for the Augustine Module,\u201d you say.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll need a HCROT,\u201d says Spring. \u201cHave you figured out what is a HCROT?\u201d\n > say \u201cno\u201d\n (to Spring)\n \u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d\n > wander around the room aimlessly\n Oh, that is a good plan.\n No, actually I meant that\u2019s a terrible plan.\n > jump up and down\n You\u2019re looking silly.\n Have we reached the try-anything-once part of the adventure?\n > shake fist at Ryder\n What are you supposed to do in an adventure whenever you\u2019re stuck?\n > inventory\n You\u2019re carrying the following items:\n A sheaf of letters\n An unlit torch, half filled with oil\n > Ha! I got it, Ryder!\n I don\u2019t understand what you want to do.\n > TELL Spring to light torch\n Spring takes the torch from you.\n He opens up his front panel, revealing the whirling gears inside. He touches the tip of one of his steel fingers against a spinning gear and sparks fly out. One of them lands on the torch. The smell of rose fills the room, dispelling the musty smell.\n Spring hands the lit torch to you.\n > shake torch\n You hear something rattle inside the torch, a crystalline sound.\n > hold torch upside down\n Some of the oil drip out, but the rest, remarkably, stays put. You can feel the handle of the torch grow hot.\n A rattling sound comes from inside the torch, eventually settling into a rapid tap-tap-tap.\n \u201cA TORCH,\u201d you say triumphantly, \u201cbecomes a HCROT when turned around.\u201d\n Spring claps.\n > move left\n You are next to the wall.\n The torch in your hand emits the same rattle.\n > move forward\n You move towards the window.\n The torch in your hand emits the same rattle.\n > move right\n You\u2019re standing in front of the desk.\n The torch in your hand emits the same rattle.\n Spring looks at you. \u201cI don\u2019t hear any difference.\u201d\n \u201cI think it\u2019s supposed to vibrate faster and make a different sound when it gets closer to the Augustine Module,\u201d you say. \u201cSupposed to. Maybe we need something else.\u201d\n > inventory\n You\u2019re carrying a sheaf of letters.\n > examine letters\n You have a burning torch held upside down in your hand. If you try that you\u2019re going to burn the letters before you can read them.\n > hand torch to Spring\n Spring takes the torch from you.\n \u201cYou might as well move around the room a bit,\u201d you say. \u201cTry the corners I haven\u2019t tried.\u201d\n > examine letters\n You read aloud from the next letter.\n \n \n Castellan,\n I am utterly devastated at this news.\n Please have the body embalmed but do not bury her yet. Do not release the news until I figure out what to do.\n \n \n Spring has wandered some distance away. The rattling in the torch has slowed down, more like a tap, tap, tap.\n You\u2019re too stunned by what you\u2019re reading to stop. You turn to the next letter.\n \n \n Artificer,\n I would like you to fashion an automaton that is an exact replica of my poor, darling Alex. It must be so life-like that no one can tell them apart.\n When the automaton is complete, you must install in it the jewel I have enclosed with this letter. Then you may dispose of the body.\n No, do not refuse. I know that you know what it is. If you refuse, I shall make it so that you will never create anything again.\n The campaign is so heated here that I cannot step away and let Cedric sway them. Yet, if the news is released that my daughter is dead and I am refusing to go home to mourn her, Cedric will make hay of it and make me appear to be some kind of monster.\n No, there is only one solution. No one must know that Alex has died.\n \n \n Spring is now in the hallway. The rattling in the torch has slowed down to an occasional tap, like the start of a gentle bit of rain. Tap . . . Tap . . . Tap . . .\n > TELL Spring to return\n Spring comes closer. Tap, tap, tap.\n Spring is now next to you. Tap-tap-tap.\n > TELL Spring to hand over the torch\n Spring hands the torch to you. Tap-tap-tap.\n \u201cDid you know?\u201d you ask.\n \u201cI have been with you for only four years,\u201d Spring says.\n \u201cBut I remember playing with you when I was a baby! You never told me they weren\u2019t real memories.\u201d\n Spring shrugs. The sound is harsh, mechanical. \u201cYour father programmed me. I do what I\u2019m told to do. I know what I\u2019m told to know.\u201d\n You think about the letters. You think about how vague and hazy your memories of your childhood are, how nothing in those memories is ever distinct, as if they were stories told to you a hundred times until they seemed real.\n You bring the torch closer to your chest. The heat makes you flinch. TapTapTap.\n You wonder where she\u2019s buried. Is it in the garden, right underneath your bedroom window, where the lilies bloom? Or is it further back, in the clearing in the woods where you like to catch fireflies at night?\n You bring the torch even closer. The flame licks at your hair and a few strands curl and singe. Tttttap.\n You tear open the dress on you to reveal the flesh beneath. You put a hand against your chest and feel the pulsing under the skin. You wonder what will happen if you slash it open with a knife.\n Will you see a beating heart? Or whirling gears and tightly-wound springs surrounding a rainbow-hued jewel?\n It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know.\n >\n \n Ken Liu is an American author of speculative fiction.

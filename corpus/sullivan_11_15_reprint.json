He was about the same age as Donny\u2019s son, early thirties, but Little Donny had seldom acted as solemn as this guy, even when he was in church.\n\u201cHe\u2019s part of the Gleezer\u2019s security detail,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cIs he?\u201d Donny asked. \u201cGuess I forgot all about that thing,\u201d\n\u201cDid you, now?\u201d\nDonny took a momentary break. His back was hurting so much that he was beginning to think he was getting too old for this work. Too bad he didn\u2019t know how to do anything else.\n\u201cThat guy could be a tourist,\u201d he said, ragging on Laurent, who\u2019d repeated every rumor he\u2019d heard since the visitor from Gliese 581c arrived on the island yesterday.\n\u201cWonder what they bought?\u201d said Laurent.\n\u201cCould be anything.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t sell just anything in the drug store.\u201d\n\u201cCourse not. I meant anything they sell in the CVS, wise guy.\u201d\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t what you said.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll just have to watch myself from now on,\u201d Donny said. \u201cMake sure it\u2019s not too complicated for you.\u201d\n\u201cWicked,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cAin\u2019t it, though?\u201d\n\u201cSee on TV how the Gleezer can roll around naked and get away with it?\u201d\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t naked,\u201d Donny said. \u201cIt\u2019s got that elastic thing on.\u201d\n\u201cYou can see right through it.\u201d\n\u201cSo what? What is there to see?\u201d\n\u201cQuite a lot, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cNo reproductive organs, is what I meant.\u201d\n\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s get these traps baited. We can\u2019t stand here all day gawking at everybody who comes out of the drug store.\u201d\n\u201cAll day? Ain\u2019t even been two minutes,\u201d Laurent muttered, climbing over the gunwale.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get to work, we\u2019ll never get this boat paid off,\u201d Donny complained. \u201cLeave it up to you, we\u2019d never even get away from the pier.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we should call it a day. Take a look at those clouds coming in from the east,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cWe go out now, we\u2019ll get wet.\u201d\n\u201cA little rain won\u2019t melt us.\u201d\nThey finished baiting the traps, and Donny untied the painter. He wound it up and tossed it into the lazarette as Laurent started the engine. For a moment, he stared at the rainbow trail left on the water in their wake. He was glad he couldn\u2019t see it anymore once they got into open water and Laurent opened up the engine to churn up some foam.\nThey did run into rain on the way back, enough to make them don their slickers. But it cleared off pretty soon, and once they were moored at the pier again they busied themselves putting their catch into the live tank.\nA lot of the eggs attached to the female lobsters were orange, which meant they were dead. It was something they saw more and more every year. After they separated the berried ladies to be thrown back, and plopped the boys into the tank, they took a breather.\n\u201cDamn, ain\u2019t this boat a beauty, though,\u201d Donny said, patting the fiberglass transom.\n\u201cShe sure is,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cHigh bow, low topside aft, and she cuts through the water like a dream.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll we name her, now that we finally got her?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cHow about \u2018Swifty\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cOh, come off it. That\u2019s just plain stupid.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s your big idea?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have one yet.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d say \u2018Swifty\u2019 is better than \u2018Don\u2019t Have One Yet\u2019.\u201d\nDonny sighed. Sometimes he wondered why he even bothered.\nWhen they were finished at sunset, Laurent talked Donny into going to Salty\u2019s for a beer. Donny argued that he should get home, but he knew Laurent was lonely nights since June left him, except when his daughters and their husbands and kids took the ferry over from the mainland. He ended up calling Beth on the cell and told her he\u2019d be home in an hour or two.\nThey drove Laurent\u2019s truck up the hill to Salty\u2019s and found the parking lot nearly full.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Friday night, ain\u2019t it?\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cGood guess, Dick Tracy.\u201d\nThey parked and went in, walking past the decorative fishing nets to join the crowd. The joint was jumping. A few summer people were already in town, and their well-heeled kids were hanging out and flirting with the locals, at least those old enough to drink or get their hands on phony IDs. The jukebox was thumping rap.\nDonny and Laurent sidled up to the bar and took a couple stools.\nMike, the bartender, was wiping a glass. He had to shout to make himself heard over the music and the enthusiastic bellowing of the kids. \u201cHello, boys.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the word, Mike?\u201d\n\u201cNothin\u2019 much.\u201d Mike put the gleaming glass next to the other clean glasses on the shelf. \u201cWhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d\n\u201cTwo Narragansetts,\u201d said Laurent.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a Nastygansett,\u201d Donny said. \u201cGive me a Sam Adams.\u201d\n\u201cBig spender.\u201d Mike fetched two bottles and poured their drinks into two tall glasses, leaving a perfect head on each.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the master, Mike,\u201d Laurent said, blowing a little foam off the top.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they tell me,\u201d Mike said. \u201cSee the Gleezer\u2019s buddies in town today?\u201d\n\u201cOne of \u2019em, not fifty yards from the boat, before we went for our last jaunt.\u201d\nThe song on the jukebox ended, and there was a lull before the next one started.\n\u201cI hear the Gleezer wants to go out,\u201d Mike said, his belly hanging over the cedar bar as he moved closer to speak confidentially.\n\u201cOut where?\u201d\n\u201cOut around the Bay.\u201d\n\u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n\u201cOne of those Secret Service fellas traveling with it,\u201d Mike said.\n\u201cSecret Service?\u201d Donny said. \u201cIs the thing running for president?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t born in this country.\u201d\nThat got a laugh.\n\u201cSo how\u2019d you meet Secret Squirrel?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cHe slipped in here for a quick one last night just before closing.\u201d\n\u201cNo kiddin\u2019?\u201d Donny had never thought of Secret Service agents having fun, the way they were always so serious when you saw them on TV.\n\u201cWould I kid you?\u201d\nMike turned to attend to some other customers, and the music blared once again.\nDonny and Laurent nursed their beers.\n\u201cI wonder how much they\u2019re willing to pay,\u201d Donny hollered.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cFor the Gleezer\u2019s joy ride,\u201d Donny said. \u201cI wonder how much the government\u2019s willing to fork out?\u201d\n\u201cSecret Service probably arranged a cruise already.\u201d\n\u201cThink so?\u201d\n\u201cWell, they\u2019d want a luxury boat.\u201d\n\u201cThat might draw too much attention.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if Mike heard it last night. . . . \u201d Laurent was thinking it over.\n\u201cMaybe we should go over to the hotel and look into it.\u201d\n\u201cNah, they\u2019ve already chartered a boat.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cCommon sense.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s something you\u2019ve always been short on.\u201d\n\u201cLook who\u2019s talking, you red-headed dummy.\u201d\nThey each took another pull from their beers.\n\u201cWe do need to start paying off the boat,\u201d Laurent shouted.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\u201cI guess it can\u2019t hurt to make an offer.\u201d\n\u201cGuess not,\u201d Donny said. \u201cGlad you thought of it.\u201d\nLaurent downed the rest of his beer. \u201cMe, too.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, first thing in the morning, then?\u201d\n\u201cWhy not go over there now?\u201d Laurent said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t even supper time yet.\u201d\n\u201cI gotta get home.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t take too long,\u201d Laurent said, up for an adventure now. \u201cFrank Dunsmore\u2019s workin\u2019 the night shift.\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t that just ducky?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we know him. Now\u2019s the time to go over to the hotel and ask him who the boss is.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the Gleezer\u2019s the boss.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope it talks our language then.\u201d\nDonny threw a few dollars on the bar and finished his beer. They rose from their stools.\n\u201cSee you, Mike,\u201d Donny said.\nMike waved at them, and they elbowed their way through the noisy crowd and out the door.\n\u201cSure you\u2019re okay drivin\u2019?\u201d Donny asked, glad to be away from the racket.\n\u201cI only had one beer.\u201d\nThey got into the truck. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the night you hit that bridge abutment in Rockland.\u201d\n\u201cThirty-five years ago, and you\u2019re still talking about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou only had one before that little fender bender, as I recall.\u201d\n\u201cI had more than one that night\u2014\u2019less you mean one six-pack.\u201d\nThe two men laughed.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to get to the hotel. In fact, it didn\u2019t take long to get anywhere on the island. Donny didn\u2019t mind, because he always felt lost when he went to Boston or Portland, or even Bangor. He was an island boy at heart, and he liked it that way.\nThe Penobscot Hotel had been built in 1896, with new wings added in the fifties and the eighties. It was elegant and expensive. Except for delivering lobsters to the kitchen loading dock, the only time Donny had been inside was his senior prom in 1973. He remembered smoking a joint in the men\u2019s room with Laurent and some other boys with shag hairdos who were all long gone from the island now, except for one who taught at a nearby high school on the mainland . . . and Frank, the man they were going to see.\nLaurent pulled into the parking lot. There were a few cars, an AIV, and some trailers and a TV van at the back of the lot, but nothing much. The public had gradually stopped paying attention since the initial buzz when the Gleezer splashed down, or the media would have been out in force. Only the likes of Laurent had kept up with the story until the Gleezer showed up on the island. Most people didn\u2019t care all that much about it anymore, since the Gleezer had nothing to say and was kept out of sight most of the time. You could only look at the same two or three clips of it so many times.\nDonny and Laurent got out without bothering to lock the truck. Nobody was going to steal from them here, because everybody either had money or were people they knew, including the Costa Rican chambermaids.\n\u201cWe should have worn our tuxedos,\u201d Laurent said as they approached the glass lobby door.\n\u201cWhy, are we going to a costume party?\u201d Donny asked, opening the door for his old buddy. \u201cAfter you, Alphonse.\u201d\n\u201cMerci, gar\u00e7on.\u201d Laurent went through his pockets as if searching in vain for a coin. \u201cQuel dommage! J\u2019ommet tous mes argent en l\u2019autre pantalon!\u201d\n\u201cYou damn cheapskate frog.\u201d\nThe olive green carpet was so spotless that Donny almost was afraid to walk on it. A couple of well-dressed people sat on well-upholstered chairs in the lobby, and he was pretty sure from their watchful attitude that they weren\u2019t tourists.\nThe balding night manager was looking at a laptop as they walked up to him.\n\u201cHello, Frank,\u201d said Laurent.\nFrank Dunsmore looked up and greeted them with the superior air Donny had always found so annoying. \u201cHello, Laurent. Long time, no see. How are you, Don?\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cYou two want a room?\u201d\n\u201cFunny fella,\u201d said Laurent. \u201cNo, we just want to talk to whoever\u2019s in charge of the Gleezer\u2019s bunch.\u201d\nFrank looked amused, and Donny wanted to smack him. He saw Frank as a smarmy local boy who\u2019d always sucked up to rich people so he wouldn\u2019t have to earn an honest living as a lobsterman.\n\u201cI can\u2019t just send you up to their floor,\u201d Frank said with his customary self-importance. \u201cThey\u2019ve got it cordoned off.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you talk to somebody up there?\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What do you want with \u2019em?\u201d\n\u201cWe got a business proposition to make.\u201d\n\u201cNow, what kind of business would you two have with our distinguished guest?\u201d\nLaurent glanced at Donny, who shrugged in return. \u201cWe hear the Gleezer wants to go for a boat ride, and we\u2019re willin\u2019 to take it out.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Frank. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n\u201cGrapevine,\u201d Donny said, before Laurent could answer.\n\u201cHave you two jokers seen our penthouse guest?\u201d\n\u201cOnly online and on TV,\u201d Laurent admitted.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s one thing to see a picture of it, and it\u2019s another thing seeing it live.\u201d\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a very special time for the Penobscot,\u201d Frank said, looking impressed with himself. \u201cAnd for our island.\u201d\n\u201cGod bless America and the state of Maine, too,\u201d Donny said. \u201cDoes that mean you ain\u2019t gonna call up there, or are you planning to mess with us the rest of the night?\u201d He was fed up with Frank\u2019s superciliousness. \u201cWe got better things to do.\u201d\nFrank was taken aback. \u201cAll right, Don, don\u2019t get your shorts in a bunch. I\u2019ll call \u2019em, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d\nHe got on the house phone and spoke to somebody.\n\u201cCouple of lobstermen have a boat to charter,\u201d he said, among other things, including their names, which he repeated twice. He hung up after a minute and said, \u201cYou can go on up.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI gotta go key the elevator or it won\u2019t take you to the penthouse.\u201d\nFrank came out from behind the desk and led them to the elevator. He got inside with them and set it with a card, and then slipped out.\n\u201cGood luck, fellas,\u201d he said as the door slid shut.\n\u201cWhat a jerk,\u201d Donny said on the way up.\n\u201cOh, he ain\u2019t so bad,\u201d Laurent said.\nDonny watched the LED display, 1, 2, 3, and he was feeling pretty tense by the time they reached the penthouse.\n\u201cHere we go,\u201d Laurent said, waiting for the door to open.\nThe delay made it seem like an awfully long time. At last it opened, loudly and irrevocably. A woman stood right in front of the door. She was dark and had short raven hair. She was very good-looking.\n\u201cMr. Doyle and Mr. Therriault?\u201d she said, adjusting a little electronic earpiece clamped to her left lobe.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Donny said. \u201cThat\u2019s us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Special Agent Hernandez,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Laurent said, offering his hand.\nDonny shook hands with her, too. He\u2019d never met a Special Agent before. He wondered if she spoke to the chambermaids in Spanish.\n\u201cPlease put all your change and keys in this bin and step through the metal detector.\u201d\nThe metal detector was behind her, and she stepped aside to let them go through. Laurent went first, followed by Donny. Special Agent Hernandez watched them as they picked up their keys and coins. So did two young men in suits down the hall, one of whom they\u2019d seen coming out of the drug store that afternoon.\n\u201cPlease come with me.\u201d She turned and Donny watched her shapely calves flex as she led them through the penthouse suite. All the doors were closed but one.\nThe room she took them to was just like something in a movie, with windows on three sides so you could see the town\u2019s lights and the white-capped water breaking on the rocks below.\n\u201cNice,\u201d Laurent said.\nDonny didn\u2019t say anything, embarrassed by his boots squishing.\n\u201cIf you gentlemen will wait here,\u201d the lady said. \u201cMr. Towson will be right with you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cHelp yourselves to the refreshments on the table,\u201d she said, and then left them alone.\nThere were bagels, salmon, fresh fruit, bottled water, wine, and a coffee urn with cups and saucers, cutlery, and napkins. Laurent grabbed a banana, and Donny had a pumpernickel bagel, which he slathered with cream cheese using a butter knife. He bit into it and found it was as hard as a rock, but tasty. Both poured themselves some coffee into china cups and sat on the fanciest sofa Donny had ever seen in his life, holding their saucers in their laps.\n\u201cImagine the kind of money it takes to rent this place,\u201d Laurent said, looking around at the fancy furnishings and framed paintings on the walls.\nDonny didn\u2019t speak, because he was sure they were being monitored. He didn\u2019t intend to say something stupid and blow this job.\nTowson kept them waiting quite a while. When he finally appeared, he proved to be a trim man with thick, silvery white hair, in his late fifties, wearing a very expensive suit and a blue satin tie.\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, extending a manicured hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jerry Towson.\u201d\n\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Towson,\u201d Laurent said, rising to shake his hand. \u201cLaurent Therriault. This is Donny Doyle.\u201d\nDonny got up and shook with Towson, conscious of the dried chum blood under his fingernails and the smell of lobster battling with Towson\u2019s cologne. Towson had a strong grip, though, and his gray eyes sized up a man in a hurry.\n\u201cI understand you gentlemen have a boat you\u2019d be willing to charter for a day?\u201d Towson asked, coming right to the point.\n\u201cAyuh, a brand new Northern Bay 36,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cJust got her this week,\u201d Donny added.\n\u201cDo you have any objection to a thorough security check of your boat before the launch?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Laurent quickly said.\nTowson nodded at him, and then turned to Donny. \u201cAnd you, Mr. Doyle? Do you have any objections?\u201d\n\u201cI guess not,\u201d Donny said, remembering that this had been his idea in the first place. \u201cLong as nothing\u2019s damaged.\u201d\n\u201cI assure you we\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Mr. Towson said, showing his capped teeth as he smiled like a cable TV newsman. \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, what, uh . . . \u201d Laurent hesitated.\n\u201cPlease go on.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do if there\u2019s trouble?\u201d\n\u201cTrouble?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cWhat if it runs out of the stuff it breathes, or something like that?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a team there to make sure nothing goes wrong.\u201d\n\u201cHow many people?\u201d Donny asked. \u201cIt\u2019s only a thirty-six footer, you know.\u201d\n\u201cJust three people, including me,\u201d Towson said. \u201cIs that too many passengers?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Laurent said, glancing at his buddy.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Towson said. \u201cHow much do you charge for a charter cruise?\u201d\n\u201cThis\u2019ll be the first one,\u201d Donny said. \u201cMake us an offer.\u201d\n\u201cFive thousand dollars.\u201d\nDonny thought his jaw was going to hit his collarbone. \u201cUh . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, that\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Laurent quickly said.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Towson said. \u201cWill a check be all right?\u201d\n\u201cLong as it don\u2019t bounce,\u201d Donny said, recovering quickly from the shock.\nTowson smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a cashier\u2019s check for you tomorrow morning, and we\u2019ll have the visitor at the dock at five o\u2019clock sharp. After a routine security scan, we\u2019ll be off.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find our boat moored right at the end of Water Street,\u201d Donny said. \u201cCan\u2019t miss it. No name painted on her yet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you understand how important discretion is in this matter,\u201d Towson said. \u201cWe ask only that you tell no one about it until after the visitor is safely ashore.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cAnd just one more thing,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cAyuh?\u201d\n\u201cAre there any firearms aboard?\u201d\n\u201cJust a Very pistol\u2014you know, a flare gun,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cNothing else?\u201d\n\u201cNope,\u201d Donny said, \u201cwe don\u2019t shoot lobsters, we just trap \u2019em.\u201d\nTowson smiled. \u201cVery good, gentlemen, you have a deal with the United States government.\u201d\n\u201cGood enough for me,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cAnd you, Mr. Doyle?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Donny said. He was thinking about the money this could bring their way after the deal was done\u2014television, online interviews, magazines. . . . It could turn out to be very profitable. People would want to ride on the Gleezer boat, and they\u2019d be willing to pay for the privilege.\nAnd even if he and Laurent didn\u2019t make another penny off this deal, they could at least lay down a pretty hefty payment on the boat next month.\n\u201cWhen you said we can\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d Donny said to Towson, \u201cdoes that include my wife?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\nDonny nodded. It would be hard to keep it from Beth, but it wasn\u2019t unusual for a lobster boat to put out at five, so she wouldn\u2019t be suspicious. He\u2019d have a good story to tell her when he got home tomorrow, in any case.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d\nThey each shook hands with Towson to seal it.\n\u201cI have some things to attend to, gentlemen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut feel free to linger here as long as you wish, and please help yourselves to food and beverages.\u201d\n\u201cCan we take some goodies home with us?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t,\u201d Towson said. \u201cIt might raise questions.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I live alone nowadays,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna question me.\u201d\n\u201cThen I see no reason why you can\u2019t take all you like. Good evening, gentlemen.\u201d\nHe walked out of the room.\n\u201cAnd here I am with mouths to feed,\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll save you some,\u201d Laurent said, gathering up grapes, apples, and bagels, which he wrapped in napkins and stuffed into his coat pockets. He gripped a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon in his meaty hand and started toward the door. \u201cGive it to you when we come back tomorrow. Except for the wine, which I\u2019m keeping.\u201d\n\u201cThe food\u2019ll be stale.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t eat it,\u201d Laurent said, as they left the panoramic view behind them on their way to the elevator. \u201cSee if I care.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re all heart.\u201d\n\u201cAyuh.\u201d\nChewing on a grape, Laurent nodded at the two young men in suits as they waited for the elevator. The ride down seemed much faster. Laurent waved at Frank as he and Donny walked through the lobby.\n\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Frank called to them, busting to know what had happened upstairs.\n\u201cCan\u2019t talk about it, Frank,\u201d Donny shouted back. \u201cNational security.\u201d\nIn the parking lot, they looked up as a helicopter noisily flew over.\n\u201cGovernment or news?\u201d Laurent said, spitting out a seed and popping another grape into his mouth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t see what difference it makes.\u201d\nLaurent dropped Donny off at the house, looking out for wildlife along the way. Dark as it was with the birches all around, Donny noticed that a couple more shingles had fallen into the front yard as he walked up to the front door. He\u2019d have to work on the roof this summer.\nHe heard the dog barking as he let himself in.\n\u201cHello, Bert,\u201d he said stroking the Lab\u2019s yellow fur as he entered. \u201cI almost had some treats for you, but no dice.\u201d\n\u201cDid you get anything to eat?\u201d Beth asked, coming out of the kitchen as Donny flung his coat over the newel post. He could hear the TV going in the living room.\n\u201cAyuh.\u201d He kissed her on the cheek, his face tickled by her long hair. She\u2019d stopped coloring it lately, calling it her \u201cgray badge of courage.\u201d It wasn\u2019t really all that gray yet. He liked the way it looked, long and feminine.\n\u201cHow\u2019s your back?\u201d Beth asked.\n\u201cAching a little bit, but I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u201cLittle Donny called a short while ago,\u201d Beth said. \u201cHe said he was sorry he missed you.\u201d\n\u201cDid he, now?\u201d\n\u201cThings are picking up for him,\u201d Beth said, ignoring Donny\u2019s sardonic tone. \u201cHe\u2019s got a few gigs lined up and some time in the recording studio.\u201d\n\u201cSo he\u2019s gonna be a rock star soon?\u201d\n\u201cAs long as he\u2019s happy,\u201d Beth said, looking at him with her green eyes.\nDonny grunted as he sat on the bottom step and Beth helped him haul off his short boots. Bert\u2019s tail counted time, whacking against the bottom step.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have had coffee,\u201d Donny said, changing the subject.\n\u201cSince when do you drink coffee at Salty\u2019s?\u201d\nHe let the question pass as he stood up.\n\u201cI still have some of that Ambien Doctor Blaisdell prescribed,\u201d Beth said. \u201cThat ought to put you out.\u201d\n\u201cAyuh.\u201d\nHe took a bath and the pill, and he was ready to go to sleep an hour later. Beth joined him, lying down next to him in their queen size bed and rubbing his back for a few minutes.\n\u201cEverybody on the island\u2019s talking about the Gleezer,\u201d she said, pulling up the comforter and turning on her side to put out the lamp on the night stand.\n\u201cDay before yesterday nobody around here cared about it.\u201d\n\u201cKind of exciting, having it come here.\u201d\n\u201cKinda.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you suppose it wants?\u201d\n\u201cWants? What do you mean, baby?\u201d\n\u201cWell, why this island of all the places on Earth?\u201d\n\u201cSame reason as summer people come here, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cFor the rustic New England charm?\u201d\nThey both laughed.\n\u201cHave you got something on your mind, Donny?\u201d\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s never anything on my mind.\u201d\n\u201cOh, stop it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019re gonna have a long day tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cAre you thinking about Little Donny?\u201d\n\u201cNothing I can do about him.\u201d\nBeth didn\u2019t say anything. They\u2019d been through it a thousand times. She believed that Little Donny was brave to be unashamed of the way he was, but Donny wondered if things might have turned out different if he had interested the boy in something besides playing the keyboard.\nBeth snuggled up.\n\u201cYour nose is cold,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCold nose, warm heart,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you find orange berries on the females today?\u201d\n\u201cAyuh.\u201d\n\u201cIt bothers you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sure it does,\u201d Donny said. \u201cWhat are we gonna do if the lobsters die off?\u201d\nShe touched his hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll get by.\u201d\nThe Ambien was making Donny drift off, but he was thinking about tomorrow and what it might mean. He had to remind himself not to say anything to Beth about it.\nAnd then he was asleep.\nBeth was up before him, at quarter past four. She was making coffee, bacon, and eggs. Donny washed his face and came downstairs, trying to savor the delicious odors, but too worried about how things were going to go today to enjoy it much. He didn\u2019t want Beth to notice his anxiety, though, so he talked about something he knew would prevent her from asking him any questions.\n\u201cLittle Donny still got plans to marry Alan?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh, he mentions it every now and then,\u201d Beth said, pleased to talk about their son as she cracked an egg and plopped its contents into the buttered pan.\n\u201cI know you wanted grandchildren,\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cIf they get married, maybe they can adopt.\u201d\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the same, he thought, but he kept it to himself.\nThey ate in silence.\nLaurent picked him up at twenty minutes to five, to make sure they\u2019d be at the pier in plenty of time. Rolling down his window, Laurent patted Bert on the head, the dog\u2019s paws resting on the pickup\u2019s side panel.\n\u201cSomething wrong with the heater?\u201d Donny inquired after he got in.\n\u201cGive it a chance,\u201d Laurent replied.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be out on the water before it warms up in here.\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t it awful?\u201d\nIt was still dark, but as they bumped down the hill from Donny\u2019s house, the Atlantic was starting to reflect a quicksilver hint of light.\n\u201cThink the Gleezer\u2019s sun looks different than ours?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they claim,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cIt\u2019s red all the time, not just at sunrise and sunset.\u201d\n\u201cAll the time? No kiddin\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cNo kiddin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cSo how does there happen to be life on its planet?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s water, and I guess wherever there\u2019s water there\u2019s life.\u201d\nAs usual, Laurent drove right onto the pier. Donny thought it was kind of nice that they wouldn\u2019t have to tote any traps today if they didn\u2019t feel like it. They were just going to take a little cruise out onto the bay with the Gleezer. He remembered movies about space monsters and alien menaces, and it made him chuckle.\n\u201cAre you losin\u2019 it?\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cWell, you gotta admit this is kinda weird, Laurent.\u201d\nLaurent laughed, too. \u201cCan\u2019t deny it.\u201d\nThey climbed aboard and got ready for the imminent arrival of the Gleezer\u2019s team.\nA massive, black AIV\u2014the one they\u2019d seen in the hotel parking lot\u2014rolled down Water Street and parked itself behind Laurent\u2019s truck right on time, five o\u2019clock sharp. Excepting its pristine paint job, it looked like it ought to be patrolling the streets of a war zone. Its headlights illuminated the boat and hurt Donny\u2019s eyes.\nHe didn\u2019t like having Laurent\u2019s truck blocked off, but they weren\u2019t going to be using it until they got back.\nTowson got out of the AIV and walked toward their boat. He looked as fresh as a daisy, wearing an overcoat, his silver hair glistening from the morning mist. He had so much hair that Donny wondered if it was plugs or a wig.\n\u201cGood morning, gentlemen,\u201d Towson said, as two young Secret Servicemen climbed aboard and looked the boat over for Weapons of Mass Destruction. This morning, they were dressed in jeans and jackets, the guy they\u2019d seen yesterday wearing a Cubs cap over his blond hair and the other one wearing a knit watch cap. Donny hoped they wouldn\u2019t fall into the head when they went below deck.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Laurent said, sniffling a bit.\n\u201cComing down with a cold, Mr. Therriault?\u201d\n\u201cJust allergies.\u201d\n\u201cSo it\u2019s in the AIV?\u201d Donny asked. \u201cThe, uh . . . visitor?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Towson glanced over his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll lift it out in its environmental tank and put it on the deck whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\u201cNo time like the present,\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cI agree, but let\u2019s give my men time to finish the security check first.\u201d\nA couple minutes later, they were satisfied.\nTowson turned and pressed buttons on a remote. The back door of the SUV opened. Appendages that looked like they were assembled from a giant Erector Set swung a polarized glass tank over the roof and hood, depositing it on the pier. It was about the size of a coffin.\n\u201cPretty nifty,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cDo we have to haul it aboard ourselves?\u201d Donny asked.\nTowson shook his head and directed his two men to do it. They grasped handles on the sides of the glass tank and lifted it without much strain.\n\u201cThe lady didn\u2019t come?\u201d Laurent asked, as the two Secret Service agents wrestled the tank aboard. The boat bobbed under their weight as they set it on the deck.\n\u201cSpecial Agent Hernandez?\u201d Towson said. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not. She\u2019s in charge of the team back at the hotel.\u201d\n\u201cToo bad for you, Laurent,\u201d Donny said. \u201cI could tell she likes you.\u201d\n\u201cFunny fella,\u201d Laurent replied. \u201cYou ought to be writing for Conan O\u2019Brien.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d pay better.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Special Agent Hernandez is a pretty woman,\u201d Laurent said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t you say, Mr. Towson?\u201d\n\u201cI would,\u201d Towson replied.\n\u201cAre you coming with us?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Towson said. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\n\u201cYou might get your feet wet.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been wet before,\u201d Towson said.\nTowson reached under his coat, and for a moment Donny thought he was going to show them his handgun. Instead, he pulled an envelope from his inside breast pocket.\n\u201cYour check,\u201d he said.\nLaurent and Donny exchanged glances. Donny took the envelope, because it seemed that Laurent didn\u2019t want to.\n\u201cFeel free to look it over,\u201d Towson said, smiling, \u201cif you don\u2019t trust the federal government.\u201d\n\u201cYou never know these days,\u201d Laurent said.\nThey all laughed.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Donny said. \u201cAfter all, we know where you\u2019re staying.\u201d\nAnother laugh. Maybe, Donny thought, this wouldn\u2019t be such a bad day . . . if it didn\u2019t rain.\n\u201cThis is a fine looking vessel,\u201d Towson said, turning his attention to the boat.\n\u201cBuilt this year,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cAI steering system?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we couldn\u2019t afford that. She\u2019s got Raytheon and old-fashioned GPS, but we hardly ever need it, so. . . . \u201d\n\u201cI guess you know your way around this bay pretty well.\u201d\n\u201cAyuh, we\u2019ve been doing this all our lives,\u201d Donny said, suspecting that he was being patronized.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get on board,\u201d Laurent said, deftly hopping over the gunwale and offering a hand to Towson.\nDonny untied the painter and climbed aboard as Laurent started her up. They put out slowly.\n\u201cAre we going to see the . . . \u201d He almost said \u201cthe Gleezer,\u201d but caught himself. \u201c . . . visitor?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cMind if we pull up some lobster traps while we\u2019re out?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to object.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, then. Just a few to keep us busy.\u201d\nThe sun was emerging over the horizon, breaking into a million shimmering red lights on the water.\nNo matter how many times he saw it, Donny never got tired of it.\n\u201cLovely,\u201d Towson said, as they got away from shore and gathered speed. \u201cJust lovely.\u201d\n\u201cGrows on you,\u201d Laurent said.\nThe steady sound of the boat\u2019s diesel engine was overcome by the rattling whir of a helicopter passing overhead.\n\u201cOne of yours?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cIn case of emergency,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cIf a tanker comes too close, will the chopper blow her out of the water?\u201d Donny drily asked. \u201cThat would be something to tell the grandkids about.\u201d\n\u201cYou have grandchildren, Mr. Doyle?\u201d\nThat question took all the fun out of the conversation. Donny decided to clam up. He had the distinct feeling that Towson knew everything there was to know about him, right down to what he ate for breakfast. For a few minutes he\u2019d been fooled into thinking this guy was just like anybody else.\nHe watched for buoys marking their traps.\nBefore he spotted any, Towson went into the pilot house and ordered Laurent to stop the boat.\nWhen the engine cut off, it took a moment for Donny to hear anything, but then the familiar sounds of the waves lapping on the hull and the gulls cawing overhead slowly came to him. All he was thinking of was that he was about to see the Gleezer.\nThe two Secret Servicemen stood by while Towson pulled a cylindrical key out of his pocket and inserted it into a slot in the tank\u2019s lid.\nThe side of the tank, rather than the lid, slowly opened. It made a ramp leading to the deck. Donny thought there would be a lot of gadgets inside, but he couldn\u2019t see much other than the dark mass of the tank\u2019s occupant.\nThe Gleezer took its time coming out.\nIt was wearing its protective sheath, just as Donny had seen on TV. It sort of squirmed and flopped onto the deck, almost like a fish out of water. Alarmed, Donny glanced at Towson, but the government man seemed calm.\nLaurent came out of the pilot house. He was spellbound by the Gleezer.\n\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Laurent asked in a tone barely above a whisper.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no cause for concern,\u201d said Towson.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look all right,\u201d Donny said. Not only that, but he could smell it right through its clear covering, and he didn\u2019t care for the odor. It wasn\u2019t like anything he\u2019d ever smelled before.\nThe Gleezer slithered a few feet across the deck. Donny tried to think of something to compare its appearance to. A centipede, a bug, a lobster, even . . . but none of these analogies would do. It had quite a few appendages, maybe a dozen, but they didn\u2019t look like the limbs of any animal he\u2019d ever seen. There were two humps on either side with kidney-shaped artificial lungs in them, supplying the atmosphere the Gleezer needed to survive on Earth. Two transparent tubes connected the inflating lungs to the tank.\nHe knew that the lump on its back was where its brain was located, but he had no idea if it could see, smell, hear, or feel\u2014at least not the way humans and animals did.\nFrank had told the truth, for once in his life. It was one thing to see a picture of the Gleezer, and another thing to see it for real. It was only four feet away from Donny, and the sight of it made him want to jump into the drink.\nHe stood on the lazily yawing deck, his beloved Bay all around him, the early morning light dazzling on the dappled water. He looked away from the Gleezer and toward the sunrise until it hurt his eyes.\n\u201cYou get used to its appearance,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever could,\u201d Donny said. \u201cIt\u2019s ugly.\u201d\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t no prize yourself,\u201d Laurent cracked from under the fly bridge.\n\u201cNobody asked you.\u201d\nTowson frowned. \u201cI know the visitor\u2019s different, but it\u2019s intelligent, and it\u2019s sensitive.\u201d\n\u201cSensitive?\u201d Donny scoffed.\n\u201cIn other words, shut up,\u201d Laurent said.\nDonny turned on Laurent. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to shut up, you dumb Canuck.\u201d\n\u201cGentlemen, please,\u201d Towson said. \u201cThe visitor can sense your anger.\u201d\n\u201cIt can?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s empathic.\u201d\n\u201cLike on Star Trek?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d Towson explained. \u201cIn the same way that you and I might sense that an animal\u2019s in pain.\u201d\n\u201cIn pain?\u201d Donny demanded. \u201cWho\u2019s in pain?\u201d\nTowson left the question unanswered.\nDonny looked astern toward the island. It was his home, a little piece of rock jutting out of the Atlantic. Right now he wished he was back at the house, in bed with Beth. For the first time in his adult life, he was beginning to feel a little seasick.\n\u201cYou all right, Donny?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cCourse I\u2019m all right.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little pale.\u201d\nDonny grabbed a line and attached it to a metal lobster trap, watching the Gleezer peripherally. Slits in its pulsing hide opened and closed, observing him in some unknowable way, and the Secret Service detail watched them both through their human eyes.\nGet a hold of yourself, man. This was your idea. It\u2019s just a job of work. It\u2019ll all be over in a few hours.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all right with you, Mr. Towson, could we go check on some traps now?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Towson said.\nLaurent went into the pilot house and started up the engine again.\nTowson approached Donny. \u201cHave you ever been in the military, Mr. Doyle?\u201d\n\u201cNavy.\u201d\n\u201cCombat?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHe expected Towson to ask more questions, but he didn\u2019t.\n\u201cSo what are you trying to say?\u201d Donny said, angrily turning to face Towson. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a coward or something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t think that,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cJust let me do my work, and you and your boys and that thing enjoy the ride, and we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\u201cFine,\u201d Towson said. He backed off, and grabbed the lanyard to steady himself on the slippery deck. The water was becoming choppier now that they were moving farther out to sea.\n\u201cYou men have enviable lives,\u201d he heard Towson say to Laurent a few minutes later.\n\u201cWe like it,\u201d Laurent said.\nDonny snorted, unnoticed by the others. Laurent\u2019s wife had left him, his daughters lived out of state, he was over fifty, and he had nothing but time on his hands when he wasn\u2019t working. What did he like so much about his life? If he was so happy, why did he keep Donny out at night instead of going home and being happy by himself?\nFunny thing was, though, that Donny didn\u2019t mind hanging out nights at Salty\u2019s all that much. He could usually be talked into it. Nevertheless, he wished he\u2019d gone home last night, instead of going to the hotel.\nHe kept thinking of the Senior Prom, and how pretty Beth had looked that night all those years ago when they danced in the hotel ballroom. It wasn\u2019t just the joint and the beers that had made him see her that way, either. She was a pretty one. When he looked at her now, he could still see that fresh young girl through the wrinkles and gray hair.\nHe sensed that the Gleezer was moving, undulating along the deck a few inches at a time. There wasn\u2019t much room, but he still didn\u2019t want to be near it, not if he could help it.\nHe bent over, feeling a twinge in his lower back, and stepped into the pilot house.\n\u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the helm for a while,\u201d Donny said, \u201cif you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nLaurent relinquished the wheel. \u201cThere\u2019s the buoy straight ahead. You ain\u2019t gonna be driving for long.\u201d\n\u201cI just want to get away from that thing.\u201d\n\u201cEver occur to you that it might have feelings?\u201d Laurent said, ducking his head to go out on deck.\nDonny would have sneered, but Laurent was gone already, and he didn\u2019t really feel like sneering anyway. He knew it was likely that the Gleezer had emotions, but he couldn\u2019t believe it after seeing the ugly beast. He could more easily believe a lobster would send him a valentine.\nBut Laurent had a point. The Gleezer had come across space from billions of miles away, so it had to be intelligent. In fact, it was probably a lot smarter than him.\nThat wasn\u2019t saying much, he mused, as he cut the engine and steered the boat toward the buoy. He glanced over his shoulder through the hatch and saw the Gleezer throbbing like a clump of shrink-wrapped, spiny seaweed on the deck.\nHe was beginning to regret his show of revulsion toward the Gleezer and snapping at Towson. He started thinking about Little Donny, and realized that he had allowed himself to feel like less than a man because his son was gay. That was no way to be, and he knew it, but he couldn\u2019t help it.\nIt was hard to see through the windscreen, for some reason. Donny tasted salt water on his lips, even though there was no spray inside the pilot house. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. He didn\u2019t want to cry. Why couldn\u2019t he stop it? What was wrong with him?\nHe sensed someone moving behind him, and glanced over his shoulder to see who it was.\nIt was the Gleezer.\nDonny turned around to see it crawling across the deck toward the pilot house.\n\u201cWhat does it want?\u201d he called out in a near panic.\nTowson called out to him. \u201cThe visitor\u2019s just curious.\u201d\n\u201cIs it coming in here?\u201d Donny shouted.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it has that intention,\u201d Towson said in a reassuring tone.\nThe Gleezer kept inching toward the hatchway. Donny started feeling claustrophobic. He turned back toward the wheel, but he could see the Gleezer reflected in the glass, the morning sun glistening on its sheath. It was nearly five feet long, a foot and a half wide, and maybe two feet high, counting the brain hump that protruded from the top, and it was a mottled gray-green, almost black, with all those spines and spindly legs sticking out.\nDid it see him? He was certain it knew he was there, but what did it think he was? Did it understand what he was, what it meant to be a man? To suffer life\u2019s disappointments and work every day just to grow older, closer and closer to death every minute? No, of course it didn\u2019t. How could it know what a human is?\nIt stopped short of coming inside and lay on the deck, quivering. He thought it made a sound, but then he realized that was just a gull screeching in the distance.\nThe two younger Secret Servicemen, both big guys, came over and lifted the Gleezer up.\n\u201cIt wants to see more of the bay,\u201d Donny said, feeling a bit stupid. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Towson said. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cIt sure didn\u2019t come out here to look at your boots, Donny,\u201d Laurent said as he dropped the anchor.\n\u201cBut it could have seen the Bay from the shore.\u201d\n\u201cNot the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know that, Laurent,\u201d Donny said, getting an idea. \u201cHey, we got that net. We could put the Gleezer in and lift him up.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019d be better than you fellas just holding him like that,\u201d Laurent agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, Mr. Towson.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it could be dangerous?\u201d Towson asked.\n\u201cOh, no. We\u2019ve got a winch, so we can suspend the Gleezer right over the water if he wants.\u201d\n\u201cThe Gleezer?\u201d Towson said. \u201cIs that what you call our visitor?\u201d\n\u201cAyuh,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Towson said after a pause, as if he\u2019d been listening to someone they couldn\u2019t hear.\n\u201cPretty good-natured, is he?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as we know,\u201d Towson said. \u201cBut the visitor isn\u2019t a he. Its gender is indeterminate.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Well, we promise we won\u2019t do anything untoward that could cause an interstellar incident,\u201d Laurent said.\nTowson smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a man of hidden depths, Mr. Therriault.\u201d\n\u201cJust like the sea around me,\u201d Laurent said.\nDonny wondered if Towson was insulting him by implication. Did he think Donny Doyle had no depths? Well, maybe it was true. A man who held a grudge against his own son because of something the boy couldn\u2019t help was a shallow man, and he had to admit that to himself. He\u2019d been through it in his mind many, many times, and he knew Beth loved Little Donny even though he\u2019d never give her a grandchild. If Little Donny and his boyfriend could adopt a kid she\u2019d be just as happy as if he were straight, married to a nice girl, and a proud father.\nWhy couldn\u2019t he feel that way?\nLaurent was lucky. He was divorced, but he was a grandfather three times over. Not only that, but he got along fine with his ex. Everything was all right in his world, no matter what. Easy-going Laurent, everybody\u2019s pal.\nHe helped Laurent attach the fishing net to the winch.\n\u201cSo you fish too?\u201d Towson asked.\n\u201cAyuh,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cWhatever it takes to make ends meet.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you talk to the Gleezer?\u201d Donny asked Towson.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a chip in my skull that translates its communications subsonically,\u201d Towson explained. \u201cEverything I see and hear is conveyed to a team of exobiologists in the hotel and at labs in Washington and Houston.\u201d\n\u201cI read about that,\u201d Laurent said, spreading the net onto the deck. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s thinking?\u201d\n\u201cNo, only what it wants me to know.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re really committed to your job, I\u2019d say, to have that chip put in.\u201d\n\u201cIt can be removed,\u201d Towson said, almost apologetically.\n\u201cYou fellas can lay it on the net now,\u201d Donny said.\nThe two Secret Servicemen placed the Gleezer on the net very carefully and stepped back.\nDonny cranked up the winch, glad to be doing something besides making an ass of himself, and glad to gain a bit of distance on the Gleezer. He tried not to think of anything besides what he was doing at that moment.\nHe ratcheted the net up about five feet, until the Gleezer was suspended over the deck, swaying back and forth.\n\u201cOkay, boys,\u201d he said, \u201cswing \u2019er out to starboard.\u201d\n\u201cThat means to the right,\u201d Laurent said.\nTowson nodded and the two younger men obeyed. Donny wondered if those two Secret Servicemen ever spoke. Maybe he had it all wrong, and they were the ones who weren\u2019t human.\nThe winch pivoted and the Gleezer hung over the water, limned by the indigo sky. The tubes trailed onto the deck and into the environmental tank.\n\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Laurent said, looking at Towson.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Towson said, after a moment.\nDonny, standing by the winch, wondered if the Gleezer enjoyed the ocean the same way he did. Maybe it wasn\u2019t quite as ugly as he\u2019d first thought. Frank had put that idea in his head last night, about seeing it. Donny had been tired, and thinking about money, so maybe he\u2019d been more susceptible than he should have been. He was so worried about making things work out that he was as jumpy as flea these days.\nThis boat cost almost three hundred thousand dollars, and buying it had been a big risk, but so what? Such mundane considerations were bleached away by the morning sun climbing up over the Atlantic, as he considered the possibility of the Gleezer taking pleasure in its surroundings.\nDonny turned toward Towson. \u201cIs it . . . ?\u201d\nTowson waited for him to finish the question.\n\u201cIs it enjoying itself?\u201d\nTowson thought about that for a moment. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Donny said. \u201cJust tell us when to reel it in.\u201d\n\u201cIt may be a little while,\u201d Towson said, \u201cfrom what the visitor is telling me.\u201d\nThey watched from the gently rocking deck for a few minutes, and Donny thought about how far the Gleezer had come from its home, more than twenty light years away, just to see a yokel like him recoil from it.\n\u201cDid I hurt it?\u201d Donny said, surprised that he would ask.\n\u201cHurt it?\u201d\n\u201cIts feelings, like Laurent said.\u201d\nTowson stared straight into his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should worry about it. The visitor has provoked negative reactions in quite a few people since it\u2019s been here.\u201d\nDonny looked down at the deck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was one of \u2019em.\u201d\nHe turned away from Towson as he felt the tears starting again. What was the matter with him, carrying on like this? He wasn\u2019t a child.\nHe felt a light touch on his elbow. It was Laurent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, old buddy,\u201d Laurent said softly. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to tell on you.\u201d\nNow the tears really came.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they do,\u201d Donny said, wiping his face on his sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m turning into a bitter old man, and who cares if anybody knows it?\u201d\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t so bad, Donny,\u201d Laurent said, sympathy in his hazel eyes.\nDonny snorted. \u201cI guess it could be worse. I could be Frank.\u201d\nLaurent chuckled. \u201cAyuh, that\u2019d be a lot worse.\u201d\n\u201cMade a fool of myself, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cYou got a lot on your mind.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d\n\u201cSure do. You okay now?\u201d\n\u201cAyuh.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we better make sure the Gleezer don\u2019t fall in,\u201d Laurent said, winking at him.\n\u201cRight. Might scare the sharks.\u201d\nThey tooled around the Bay, occasionally weighing anchor to pull up some traps while the Gleezer basked in the spring sun.\n\u201cCan I give you a hand with those, sir?\u201d the blond Secret Serviceman asked as they dropped anchor for the fourth time around nine.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty heavy, but you look like a strong guy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\nDonny was relieved to know the kid could talk. The other one, wearing a pair of sunglasses, kept an eye on the Gleezer. That was all right with Donny; he preferred working alone.\n\u201cWere you in the Navy?\u201d Laurent asked the helpful Secret Serviceman as they hauled on a line.\n\u201cCoast Guard.\u201d\n\u201cGood enough to know starboard from port, I guess,\u201d Laurent said, the veins standing out on his temples as he strained at the line. \u201cMe and Donny both enlisted in the Navy the same day.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been friends a long time, huh?\u201d\n\u201cDonny\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cAlways has been, ever since we were toddlers. Our fathers were lobstermen, too. We grew up wearing yellow slickers and rain hats.\u201d\nDonny thought about his father, dead seven years now, and his mother wasting away in the nursing home in Portland. His older brother Ed had drowned in an accident while pulling traps back in 1968; he\u2019d been only eighteen years old. Did the Gleezer have parents? Did it have brothers and sisters?\nMaybe he\u2019d do some reading about the Gleezer after this was over. When it first splashed down off an Indonesian island, the news about it was non-stop. After a few days Donny had tuned it all out, like most people. As far as his daily life was concerned, Indonesia was as far away as Gliese 581c.\nBut it hadn\u2019t always been like that. He\u2019d sailed to the Far East on a destroyer in 1975. He\u2019d wanted to see something besides the Bay and the island, to know what was out there. He was stymied, however, by the fact that the Gleezer didn\u2019t come from this world at all. It hadn\u2019t just come across the sea, it had crossed the gulf of space.\nIn a way, though, maybe it wasn\u2019t so different from him. It wanted to see something other than its familiar world.\nThe sun rose higher, warming Donny. He reflected that this was the easiest five thousand dollars he and Laurent had ever made, and they even had an extra hand to help them with the traps today.\n\u201cMind if I ask you your name?\u201d Laurent said to the young Secret Serviceman, \u201cor is it a state secret?\u201d\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Fields,\u201d the young man said.\n\u201cWhere you from, Agent Fields?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cIowa.\u201d\n\u201cNice place to be from,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know how to take that comment,\u201d the kid said, grinning.\n\u201cNo offense meant.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d\n\u201cI bet you didn\u2019t see too many lobster boats when you were growing up out in the cornfields.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a safe bet, Mr. Therriault.\u201d\n\u201cCall me Laurent.\u201d\nA sailboat tacked into the wind and kept pace with them for a while.\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll we do if they approach?\u201d the other young Secret Serviceman asked.\nTowson indicated that the chopper was not far away.\n\u201cJeez, they aren\u2019t gonna blow \u2019em out of the water, are they?\u201d Donny said, alarmed at the prospect.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep the visitor safe,\u201d Towson said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201d\n\u201cThose are our neighbors,\u201d Donny said, \u201cnot terrorists.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything to them, unless they threaten the visitor. Do you think that\u2019s likely, Mr. Doyle?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if they\u2019re New Yorkers.\u201d\nTowson didn\u2019t seem to get the joke at first, but then he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m from New York.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\u201cYou a Yankees man or a Mets man?\u201d\n\u201cYankees.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mention that to many people around here.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Towson said, \u201cbut I hope we can call off the hostilities until the season gets underway.\u201d\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t guarantee.\u201d Donny went into a long peroration about Boston\u2019s pitching staff, starters and relievers both, the powerful Red Sox batting order, and the Colombian kid who\u2019d led the league in stolen bases last year. \u201cHe\u2019s just about invisible when he tags second,\u201d Donny said, \u201clike greased lightning.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s quite a base runner,\u201d Towson agreed.\nDonny had hoped to distract Towson until the sailboat passed them. It continued to keep pace at a fair distance, and now he could see that someone on deck was watching through binoculars. Towson never took his eyes off it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to report them if they take pictures,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d\n\u201cTheir cameras will be confiscated.\u201d\n\u201cBut why? Everybody\u2019s seen pictures of the Gleezer.\u201d\n\u201cI have my orders, Mr. Doyle.\u201d\nDonny had almost been feeling friendly enough to let the government man call him by his first name, but after that exchange he decided he\u2019d let Towson go on calling him Mr. Doyle.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame people for being curious,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame them for anything,\u201d Towson replied. \u201cI\u2019m just following protocol.\u201d\n\u201cHell of a country, ain\u2019t it?\u201d Donny said, \u201cRegular people can\u2019t even take a snapshot of the first visitor from another planet.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my decision.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I guess not. You\u2019re only following orders, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\nThis was more like talking to a brick wall than a man, Donny thought, so he gave up trying and went back to work in silence. He was relieved to see that the sailboat had tacked to the south, without anyone aboard taking pictures, as far as he could tell. He\u2019d never seen that particular boat before, and he wondered if it had come around the back side of the island from Castine, or maybe up from Camden.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the Gleezer doing up there?\u201d Laurent asked, as he\u2019d been asking every few minutes.\n\u201cSo far, okay,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cGlad somebody around here\u2019s having a good time,\u201d Donny muttered to himself as he hefted a trap onto the deck and took a look at the contents.\n\u201cUh, oh,\u201d he said, \u201cwe got some trouble, Laurent.\u201d\n\u201cFight?\u201d\n\u201cAyuh,\u201d Donny said, \u201cthis fella\u2019s missing his pincher.\u201d\nDonny found the claw in the trap, along with a two pound male.\n\u201cOrnery, ain\u2019t you?\u201d Donny said to the battle\u2019s victor as he held it dripping up to the sunlight.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about something,\u201d Laurent said to the kid.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Mr. Therriault?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to call me Laurent? How did the President get along with the Gleezer?\u201d\nThe kid didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cI mean, what did she think of it?\u201d\n\u201cShe was courteous, cordial, and diplomatic,\u201d Towson said, stepping in.\nAgent Fields was trying hard not to laugh, Donny noticed. Maybe the President was as repulsed by the Gleezer as he was.\nThe Gleezer didn\u2019t seem to bother Laurent much, but that was Laurent. Nothing bothered him all that much, not even losing his wife after a quarter century of marriage. He\u2019d probably have a new one as soon as the divorce was finalized. Donny knew a couple widows who had their eyes on his old buddy. Now that Laurent was half-owner of this peapod, he\u2019d have to fight off the ladies when he started dating again, especially once he and Donny really got the business going, bought more boats, hired some local boys, and sold lobsters wholesale to the big supermarket and restaurant chains.\nAt least they\u2019d already put the first part of their plan into play, even if they\u2019d gone into hock to buy the boat.\nThat was how Donny passed the rest of the morning, daydreaming and hauling up traps, until he noticed Laurent looking worried as he gazed aft. He was watching the three Secret Servicemen.\nTowson spoke to his boys in low tones as they huddled with him. Donny couldn\u2019t hear what he said, but he had the impression that something was wrong, especially with the way Agent Fields looked up at the net.\n\u201cWant us to haul it in?\u201d Laurent asked.\nTowson ignored him, almost as if he hadn\u2019t heard him speak. He groped his way to the gunwale nearest to the net and stared straight at it.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Donny said.\nTowson was very somber, and Agent Fields seemed worried. The quiet kid in the watch cap looked scared. Donny glanced at Laurent, who shrugged. He hadn\u2019t heard what Towson had told his boys, either.\n\u201cThe visitor\u2019s dead,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cDead . . . ?\u201d Laurent\u2019s mouth hung open.\n\u201cHow can that be?\u201d Donny said, feeling as if he\u2019d just fallen overboard. \u201cIt\u2019s just been laying up there, sunning itself. What could have killed it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, perhaps natural causes,\u201d Towson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s dead. All communication has stopped.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just the chip,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cNo, the visitor let me know that it was dying just before the end.\u201d Towson\u2019s slate eyes didn\u2019t blink.\n\u201cJeez,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t die on our boat,\u201d Donny said, thinking about the possible consequences. There went all the dreams of capitalizing on the Gleezer\u2019s little excursion around the bay. \u201cYou never even said it was sick.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Towson said. \u201cThere was only so much the exobiologists could figure out.\u201d\n\u201cWas it very old?\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how long its species\u2019 lifespan normally runs.\u201d\n\u201cIt came here to die,\u201d Donny said, beginning to understand. \u201cIt came all the way to Earth just to die.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\nDonny looked up at the strange shape suspended over the Bay. \u201cI wonder why?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it didn\u2019t want to make the folks back home unhappy,\u201d Laurent ventured.\nThe two young Secret Service agents swung the winch around, and Donny ratcheted it down until the Gleezer lay on the deck, still as a stone. Nobody spoke for a long time.\n\u201cThe poor thing,\u201d Laurent said at last.\nThe men stood in a circle around the alien\u2019s corpse.\n\u201cDid it suffer?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Towson said, still staring at the Gleezer.\n\u201cWas it in pain when it died?\u201d\n\u201cIt seemed peaceful,\u201d Towson said, as if he were answering someone a long, long way away.\n\u201cShould we put it in its tank, sir?\u201d Agent Fields asked.\n\u201cYes, I suppose we should,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cWhat good will that do the Gleezer now?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cNone, but we don\u2019t want it to decay. The chopper will lower a sling to take the tank back to the mainland. There\u2019s a team staying at the suite who\u2019ll examine it.\u201d\n\u201cFrank\u2019s gonna have to make some room in the hotel freezer,\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cYes, we may have to do that until arrangements can be made,\u201d Towson said. \u201cBut for now, let\u2019s get the visitor inside the tank.\u201d\nDonny worked the winch. Towson turned the tank on its side, and the two younger Secret Service agents guided the dead Gleezer over to it. They tilted the net until the Gleezer\u2019s remains slid into the environmental tank. Once Towson was sure it was completely enclosed and the tubes were coiled inside the tank, he gently shut the ramp, now positioned as the lid. The tank hissed as it locked.\nDonny didn\u2019t know whether to admire Towson\u2019s professionalism or to be contemptuous of his coolness. He decided to give the man the benefit of the doubt. Towson would probably be forced to retire from the Secret Service after this incident.\n\u201cDo you think one of us should say something?\u201d Laurent asked.\n\u201cSay something?\u201d Towson repeated.\n\u201cA prayer,\u201d Donny said.\n\u201cWould one of you like to offer a few words?\u201d\nIt was silent except for the gulls. The boat rocked back and forth. They all gazed at the Gleezer\u2019s tank. No one spoke.\n\u201cHere comes the chopper,\u201d said the Secret Serviceman whose name Donny didn\u2019t know.\nThe approaching helicopter made a racket overhead and dipped as the sling was lowered toward the deck. It was the work of only a few seconds to lift and secure the environmental tank inside the sling. Everyone stood back as it went up, their clothing snapping like flags in the rotor\u2019s wind.\nThey watched the helicopter fly back toward the island.\n\u201cI guess you\u2019ll want us to take you in,\u201d Laurent said.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Towson said.\nLaurent went back into the pilot house.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Donny said to Towson.\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Doyle,\u201d Towson said.\n\u201cWhat will they do with the . . . body?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Towson said. \u201cDissection, most likely.\u201d\nDonny nodded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad it can\u2019t be sent home.\u201d\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s too bad,\u201d Towson said, \u201cbut a lot can be learned from its remains.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you suppose it came here?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cAs far as I know,\u201d Towson said, \u201cit never revealed anything more than its desire to visit our world.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now we\u2019ll never know.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cImagine . . . \u201d Donny said.\n\u201cImagine what?\u201d\n\u201cHow lonely it must have been.\u201d\nTowson nodded. There was no more talk until they said goodbye on the pier.\n\u201cThank you, gentlemen,\u201d Towson said, \u201con behalf of your government and myself personally.\u201d\n\u201cWe got paid pretty well,\u201d said Laurent, as the two younger Secret Servicemen climbed into the AIV.\n\u201cNot enough,\u201d Towson said. He shook hands with Laurent and Donny, and got in to join his men. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n\u201cBye,\u201d Laurent said.\nThe door slid shut and the AIV backed itself up and turned around, heading up Water Street. It passed a couple of kids, who paid no attention to it.\nDonny and Laurent watched until it was out of sight.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get those lobsters in the tank,\u201d Laurent said, after a while.\nThey climbed back aboard and got to work. The Gleezer\u2019s strange scent lingered, but it was fading quickly. Donny separated one berried female from the others, and was pleased to see that her eggs were clear, not orange.\nAfter a while, he had an idea.\n\u201cI got a name for the boat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe Gleezer,\u201d Donny said. \u201cLike it?\u201d\nLaurent looked out at the Bay for a moment, and then said, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n\u201cKnow what else?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna call my son tonight.\u201d\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Laurent said. \u201cLet me know how Little Donny\u2019s doing, will you?\u201d\n\u201cI sure will.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll call my girls too. See how everybody is.\u201d\n\u201cYou gonna tell \u2019em?\u201d Donny asked.\n\u201cTell \u2019em what?\u201d\n\u201cAbout what happened today?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Laurent said, after a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we can keep quiet, anyway. Might as well tell \u2019em.\u201d\n\u201cAyuh.\u201d\nThey went back to work baiting traps.\nBehind them, the sea rolled on as it had for billions of years.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, December, 2008.\nTim Sullivan is the author of the novels Destiny's End, The Parasite War, The Martian Viking, and Lords of Creation, and edited the horror anthologies Tropical Chills and Cold Shocks.

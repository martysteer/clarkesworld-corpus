Art blowing so hard and so hot, jumping out like a solar flare. Art, the only one of us with a real instrument, a beat-up old brass thing with the spit of two hundred years of play in it\u2014and, well, sometimes we thought you could hear the difference. Oh, people said the 3-D printers could make horns that sounded just as good, blew just as pure, and Mikaela said it was worth it to have anti-grav, so she could tow the piano behind her wheelchair\u2014but still, there was something about knowing the horn had been on Earth, that there might be red clay or Terran bacteria gummed up under the keys. Every note heavy with the weight of time.\n We never asked Art where he\u2019d gotten a real Earth tenor sax, but there must have been a doozy of a story there.\n Zymosis\n This one we came up with the first time the five of us ever played together, on a Tenthday night down at that bar Lee Jae-jin ran on the lower deck of the ship\u2019s outer ring.\n The bar was squashed between a bot maintenance stall and a gray-water recycler, and across the ring was a shop that specialized in VR experiences of life planetside, even though those were thirty-odd years out of fashion. The whole quadrant smelled like seaweed from the algae synthesizers down-deck. It was a terrible spot for a bar, anybody could see that! Jae-jin didn\u2019t care, though. He just wanted a place where he could take rice or barley or potatoes and make drinks like they had back on Earth, drinks with names like uisghe and makgeolli and ouzo, drinks that didn\u2019t taste much like synthanol and didn\u2019t sell like it either. He liked to say they were acquired tastes, but of course nobody on board had ever acquired them.\n And, well, maybe it was the drinks list or maybe it was the neighborhood, but after 1900 hours the bar was always empty. When Mikaela fixed on starting a band she figured she\u2019d ask her old pod-mate Jae-jin about practicing down there, because it seemed like the perfect place for a newborn jazz quartet.\n Jae-jin said yes, just so long as he could come and play his trumpet.\n \u201cYou play the trumpet?\u201d Mikaela said, surprised. She\u2019d never heard him play in the three years they\u2019d shared a pod.\n Jae-jin said, looking away: \u201cSure, sure! I\u2019ve been playing a long time, friend.\u201d\n He\u2019d played trumpet on music nights in cr\u00e8che, alright. Sometimes, after the group got rolling, we\u2019d go down to the bar and spy him hiding out back, long black hair spilling loose, warm blush of exertion rising under tawny skin as he chased the solos on old recordings, trying to wrest control of the melody back from the horn. He worked hard at it, he did, but jazz wasn\u2019t a passion for him like it was for some of us. We figured he must really need the culture credits.\n So there we were, that first night: Mikaela at the baby grand, the rest of us revolving around her like moons in synchronous orbit. We\u2019d already played some classics, Monk and Coltrane, Akiyoshi and Washington, Glasper and Onwuachimba\u2014not too shabby, we thought, for our first time together\u2014when Mikaela suggested we jam, see what came of it.\n \u201cAlright, what about this, something real simple,\u201d she said, long brown fingers spooling out chords into a loose, sparkly melody: something with a little swing, not too show-offy. After she\u2019d played it a few times, everybody else\u2014drums, bass, sax, trumpet\u2014eased in, shy and tentative, like new pod-mates. We slipped behind while the piano raced ahead, laughing, urging us on. Then Mikaela nodded to Art, the saxophone leaped out into a solo, and finally things began to simmer, the music mixing on the air with the old-sock smell of Jae-jin\u2019s bubbling brews.\n From there it was easy; we fell into the melody like meteors, the piano and the sax trading lines until we wound the tune up tight.\n Fifth Wheel\n As a name, sure, it was a bit old-fashioned, smelling of Earth like it did. But then we figured a jazz quintet could hardly be anything else, so we didn\u2019t mind too much. And there was a story to the name\u2014\n It was early in the band\u2019s history; we\u2019d just finished the song, a dizzy, exuberant little thing, and there was backslapping, a loud call for drinks. Gigs, festivals, five-ring tours: all that was pinwheeling through our heads. We lined up at the low glossy slab of plasti-crete that served as a bar, below the shelf filled with bottles of Jae-jin\u2019s strange brews. In the backlight, they glowed like so many red suns.\n Jae-jin, seeing we were curious, pulled one down and began to pour.\n \u201cTry it, try it,\u201d he said, eager. (On work rotation he was in chemistry, trying to improve the texture and flavor of synth food; he was always foisting his creations on us. Sometimes we liked them, and sometimes . . . well, sometimes not.) \u201cI aged it in a barrel. A real wood barrel, if you can believe it\u2014oak, real Earth oak\u201d\u2014and we figured then we knew why he needed extra credits.\n Whatever-it-was tasted like burned toast and scorched our throats like the afterburn from a rocket. Some of us wondered, silently, whether he\u2019d gotten the process quite right, if the recipe in the databanks had left out some steps. Art, too old to keep quiet, put down his glass, and said, confused: \u201cIs this how it\u2019s supposed to taste?\u201d\n Jae-jin laughed, but when he said, quiet, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d we hurried to push our glasses across the bar for refills.\n After that we turned to business: the song needed a name.\n \u201cOld Drones,\u201d Fe suggested. We thought that was pretty much the worst name we\u2019d ever heard, and said so.\n \u201cBut it\u2019s got that clanking bit! Like gears, right?\u201d Fe said, and when we shook our heads they sighed and pouted into their drink, melodramatic as any episode of Farthest Star.\n \u201cThe Experimental Blues?\u201d That was Jae-jin.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly experimental,\u201d Mikaela pointed out, rolling a little sphere of green-and-blue glass\u2014a marble, she said it was called, something she\u2019d pocketed from the archives\u2014into the shadowed valleys between her knuckles and back up onto the cool brown flat of her hand. She was always moving her hands, Mikaela was, playing with something, a credit chip or a chew sphere or a child\u2019s toy.\n \u201cNo?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s pretty standard bebop. Nineteen-fifties stuff.\u201d\n \u201cAh. I suppose not, then,\u201d Jae-jin muttered.\n If we hadn\u2019t gotten it already, that Jae-jin didn\u2019t know much about jazz, we got it then. Mikaela was our expert, our bandleader. There was no jazz in the databanks she hadn\u2019t heard, nothing about the history of jazz she didn\u2019t know. She\u2019d played solo for a long time, and tried to tour around, but the fashion then was for bands\u2014nobody wanted to hear a musician play by themselves, it was anti-communal.\n Romy, just out of cr\u00e8che, had been taking lessons on the bass since she was a child. She knew her vamp from her walk, her broken time from her break. Fe, well, they always said they had bossa nova in their blood; and we knew they had rhythm.\n And Art? We didn\u2019t know much about him, except his age, and we could read that on his face: the papery white skin lined in gray, like the bark of the aspens circling the Commons. But we knew he could blow; we figured he must have been playing for years, long before any of us were born. He\u2019d never said a damn thing about his experience with jazz, but we figured he probably knew everything we did, and more.\n There was a pause for drinks. It grew on you a bit, Jae-jin\u2019s stuff did.\n Romy had pushed her glass across the bar for a refill a couple times, and after a bit she began to look a little queasy, beads of sweat prickling all over the ochre of her upper lip, normally spiky purple hair wilting under one restless hand.\n \u201cOkay, I am thinking: Planetfall,\u201d she said, after the fourth glass.\n We remembered, then, that she really was that young\u2014just out of childhood. There was a moment of silence while we all looked away, into the bottom of our drinks, or out the port at the back of the bar, to the distant view of bots harvesting rice from the verdant emerald curve of the ship\u2019s inner hull.\n \u201cNobody wants to hear a song called Planetfall,\u201d Art said, gently, in his growl of a voice.\n \u201cLet\u2019s play it again,\u201d Mikaela suggested, a distraction before we all got too close to the abyss, to thinking about things it was better not to think about.\n It sounded strange the second go\u2014and not just in the way a song does when you\u2019re improvising, playing into the solos\u2014but we kept bashing our way through: Art, face serious under the swoop of his remaining silver hair; Fe, gloriously fat, bobbing with the rhythm, light gleaming off the dark gold of their head like the reflection off Art\u2019s sax; Jae-jin, lurking at the back, glasses slipping down his nose, trumpet barely keeping up; and Mikaela, the mound of her box braids swaying side to side as she carried us through, professional as always. It wasn\u2019t until the end that we noticed Romy: she was leaning on her instrument like a crutch, sweat streaming down her face and dripping into the belly of the bass, rolling around in there like the saltiest of seas.\n \u201cYou okay?\u201d Fe asked, poking her with a drumstick. Romy blinked, tried to straighten up.\n \u201cOui, oui, c\u2019est tiguidou,\u201d she murmured, blinking. We mostly stuck to Common Shipboard, but get a few rounds in Romy and she lapsed into her cr\u00e8che-mother\u2019s lullaby tongue.\n \u201cYou weren\u2019t playing, friend,\u201d Mikaela said.\n \u201cNon?\u201d\n \u201cNope.\u201d\n There was a pause as she visibly pulled herself back together.\n \u201cWe\u2019re playing which one?\u201d she said, thick-tongued.\n We were lucky to get her to the head before she bellowed like a moose. When she came back out, wiping the awful residue off her face, she said she had it: \u201cFifth Wheel.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Mikaela said, cautious, not hating it.\n \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cNobody minded that I was not playing. The song, it\u2019s complete without the bass. Like a fifth wheel, yes?\u201d\n Corner Pocket\n A bouncy, looping rhythm, horns blaring like the crowd at a shipball game, the piano holding it all together until, crashing, it fell apart again . . . a souvenir, this one. A souvenir of those long afternoons in Jae-jin\u2019s bar, of the jazz-brain fever we got after a couple hours chewing coca and sucking back synth brew, feeling like forever was a Ninthday afternoon.\n In those days, we\u2019d started coming down three, four times each Tenthday, sometimes practicing, and sometimes doing shows that felt more like jumped-up rehearsals than anything else, with an audience that mostly couldn\u2019t say no to an invite\u2014oh, there were a smattering of friends and acquaintances, some fans of Mikaela\u2019s from her time playing solo, but the mainstays were Jae-jin\u2019s bond-circle, Romy\u2019s cr\u00e8che-sibs, Mikaela\u2019s triad, and Fe\u2019s wife, Genevi\u00e8ve. (Art never invited anybody, not that we saw.)\n The bar was a good place to play, though, even when attendance was sparse. Jae-jin had it done up like something from Earth, and we thought it looked good considering the space used to be an Office of Colony Establishment, back when we thought there would be a colony to establish. There were incandescent filters on the lights, to give it an old-time look, so that every time we came in we had to adjust to being steeped in gold, marinated in amber. There was even something called a \u201cpool table.\u201d Jae-jin\u2019d had the equipment printed and a few times, when we were relaxing after practice, Mikaela tried to teach us to play. She\u2019d seen a video in the databanks, she said.\n Well! None of us could figure it out, though Art came the closest, sinking a few balls every time we played.\n \u201cYou should toss it,\u201d Fe said to Jae-jin after another of their balls hit the edge and bounced out, suspending midair for a moment before slamming to the floor. The gravity wobbles that close to the bottom of the ship didn\u2019t make it any easier. \u201cIt\u2019s broken, yeah?\u201d\n But the pool table stayed. He liked to the get the details right, our Jae-jin did.\n Everybody Else (Can Do, Can Do)\n The closest we ever got to avant-jazz. The name was a joke, from one night spent listening to random cuts Mikaela had pulled from databanks; and Jae-jin, after hearing something atonal, all sprawling dissonance, complained that \u201cEverybody else can do whatever they want, but I switch to the key of D and Mikaela says it\u2019s not jazz.\u201d\n Angels\u2019 Share\n Ah, this song! This was where Jae-jin had his first real successful solo.\n One night he\u2019d gotten us tangled up in a real train wreck, the trumpet going off the rails and taking the rest of us with it, and afterward he was sitting morosely behind the bar, sipping a glass of the drink called whiskey.\n \u201cThese things take time,\u201d Mikaela said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good ear, thank Ship. But you know it won\u2019t happen at the speed of light.\u201d\n \u201cLike your barrels, eh?\u201d Romy said, gesturing to the backroom that housed Jae-jin\u2019s experiments. \u201cThe drinks spend a long time in there, or they are no good, yes?\u201d\n Jae-jin swirled the liquid in his glass. \u201cYou know, the whole time it\u2019s in there, it\u2019s evaporating? The longer it\u2019s in the barrels, the more that\u2019s lost.\u201d He took a small sip. \u201cOn Earth they called the part that was lost the angels\u2019 share.\u201d\n And the next night, when Mikaela put down a pensive melody, the piano asking some question we couldn\u2019t quite name, Jae-jin picked it up and blew a slow, foggy response, and in it we heard the story of how long we\u2019d been in here, and how long we would be still, and what things had been lost and might still be lost before we set foot on some distant planet.\n 1957 Overture (Pata Pata)\n A riff on a song that was popular on the livestreams back then, a thing made of mashed-up old Earth tunes, a woman\u2019s joyful voice soaring above the blare of cannons and strings. Ours had the horns coming in hard, like asteroids exploding on the hull shield, but when we put our version on the livestreams it didn\u2019t get so many ears.\n Why not, though? Gen, Fe\u2019s wife, signed, one night after we\u2019d played a show in a Sichuan restaurant. That was the sort of place we got gigs: out-ring bars and down-level diners, places where they were trying things the way Jae-jin was trying things, not synth food at all. And once we\u2019d played a VR party set in old-time New Orleans, but only once\u2014we had to draw the line somewhere.\n I like your music. It feels right, like it belongs here on the ship.\n We all looked to Mikaela, and Romy got hurriedly up and went to watch a low-grav dance troupe on the vidscreen in the corner, and Jae-jin took off for the kitchen to talk to the chef\u2014\n \u201cWe\u2019re out of fashion,\u201d Mikaela said, smashing her drink down on the table. We\u2019d all heard this rant before.\n Fe interpreted, hands flashing ahead of familiar words.\n \u201cThere\u2019s only two things people want to hear these days, and we\u2019re not playing either of them. I mean, thank Ship we\u2019re not playing that horrible star stuff\u201d\u2014the big thing in music then was people turning the vibrational frequencies of the stars, the bellowing of gas giants, into strange atonal symphonies\u2014\u201cbecause I\u2019ve heard more melody from a malfunctioning synth bot.\u201d\n Mikaela was on work rotation in the archives, helping decide when new music should go into the databanks, to act as an official representation of who we\u2019d been in our shipboard years. She couldn\u2019t vote against the star music\u2014too popular\u2014\u201cbut I wish people would stop listening to it, so I could stop, too.\u201d\n That was the way of things, we always told her. There were those on the ship that wanted to look forward, not back, even if they weren\u2019t sure what there was to look forward to. We could forgive them the impulse, mostly, even if it meant hearing a three-hour dirge composed using the sound of water sloshing beneath the surface of an icy moon.\n Yes, Gen signed, having sat patiently through Mikaela\u2019s tirade about the transmission of culture, the devaluation of traditional forms and the solo instrumentalist. But I\u2019ve seen string quartets and pop bands and rappers playing the Commons. Right?\n Mikaela sighed and nodded, signed Yes, right. There were always those that performed the old ways, and some of those things made it into the great ship concerts on the Commons, and then into the databanks, if they were good enough, popular enough. That was what Mikaela wanted, we knew\u2014to be in the databanks. Sometimes we\u2019d see her fingers going, going, going on the edge of the table, playing through more imaginary riffs than you could ever need in one career. She was looking for something, a song that could write her name into memory: Mikaela Cole, jazz pianist. Part, however small, of the story we told ourselves.\n How do they get there?\n \u201cLuck. Playing in front of the right people. You know the Council picks acts for the Commons?\u201d\n Gen nodded.\n \u201cWell, they\u2019re not coming down here for mapo doufu. At least not on the nights we\u2019re playing.\u201d\n So Blue\n There was a recording, in the databanks, of the last broadcast from the drones on Gliese-786. We didn\u2019t know what it sounded like, but we knew it was in there. It was part of our story, however much we might have wanted to forget. Nobody ever made music from that, though.\n Trying\n Fe had started to show up later and later for practice.\n \u201cFire,\u201d we heard Fe say, when Mikaela took them out into the ring to talk about it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re an hour late,\u201d Mikaela said.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t realize.\u201d\n Mikaela gave up on it, and we got busy coming up with a new song. Mikaela had written out a lead sheet, like she sometimes did, but that night it was Fe that led us out, with an advancing wall of rhythm that rattled us all around in an old tin can. Everyone else just had to pick their moments, if they wanted to be heard.\n \u201cShip, Fe,\u201d Mikaela said, when it was done. \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d\n \u201cYou like it?\u201d Fe said.\n Now normally they were the bright light in our group, in their neon silkex jumpsuits, bare head painted with great galactic blasts of color, always with the big laugh and gap-toothed smile. (To see them you\u2019d hardly believe the stories of their troubled youth\u2014oh, nothing terrible, no anti-ship behaviors\u2014just the games lost kids play, hacking VRs and burning credits, and they\u2019d clawed their way out of it, settled down to married life and a work rotation in credit reg, structuring our communal systems to keep us all on course, from falling into our own unmapped spaces.) But that night they were different: far away, quiet.\n Mikaela wavered a hand above the keys, striking a few sharps. \u201cMaybe. It\u2019s got energy.\u201d\n With that we were down around the table, throwing around song names, except Fe, who sat with eyes closed, one hand slipping down the sweating surface of their glass.\n \u201cFe?\u201d Jae-jin touched their wrist, softly, and the drummer\u2019s eyes snapped open. \u201cYou alright?\u201d\n We razzed them a bit, called them old for falling asleep in the bar, and finally, maybe just to shut us all up, they came out with it.\n \u201cGen and I, we\u2019re trying to have a baby.\u201d\n Well, that sure did shut us up. That was something we didn\u2019t talk about much, the question of whether it was right to tie new generations to this journey of ours; once, late, Mikaela had started to talk about it, asking why\u2014\u201cwhy? We have it good, don\u2019t we? No hunger, no real violence, a roof over our heads . . . isn\u2019t this a good life?\u201d And she was right, especially when we thought about what we knew of the years before Launch\u2014but there it was; it scared us, and she\u2019d stopped when no one responded. Privately, Mikaela had chosen to contribute to the genetic pool, and so maybe in a cr\u00e8che somewhere there were children out of artificial wombs who looked like her; but she didn\u2019t want to know. Jae-jin had decided against it, flat out; and Romy was glad, in theory, that the medics could keep a trans woman fertile through transition, so she could make that choice someday, but beyond that she felt she was too young to think any more about it.\n Art, well, a lot more people had raised their own children when he\u2019d been young, but we\u2019d never asked him, and he didn\u2019t say anything to Fe\u2019s revelation. In fact, when we thought back on it, some of us remembered that he got up and went over to the bar and poured himself a shot of soju.\n \u201cThe thing is,\u201d Fe said, \u201cit\u2019s constant, you know? Like, if we miss one chance, it might have been the right time.\u201d\n \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound too bad,\u201d Mikaela said, with a nervous laugh.\n Fe shrugged. \u201cYeah. Maybe. But it\u2019s all the time. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m late because she says, \u2018How about now?\u2019 And sometimes it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t think I can do it . . . \u201d\n We murmured what we thought was consolation, and a moon later they\u2019d get their reward, when Gen announced she was pregnant and Fe began their habit of drumming their fingers on their wife\u2019s belly, to ensure the kid would come out a drummer. That night, though, it was an easy decision: we called the song Trying.\n Unmade Constellations (For Mary Lou)\n The longest solo Mikaela ever had; she kept coming back, searching, to a moment of silence, then breaking it.\n One night she\u2019d brought something to show us, a thin black disk apparently imprinted with music in some way\u2014a record, it was called\u2014that she\u2019d taken from the archives. It was Mary Lou Williams, Zodiac Suite, and the songs weren\u2019t in the databanks. But there was no record player in the archives, and so the music was trapped there forever, unheard.\n She sat looking at it for a long time, tracing one finger over the thin rings on the disc, and then she took it away with her, after. Sometimes we wondered if she\u2019d broken it, too.\n A Handful of Dust\n A slight, misty thing, all the notes shivering and breaking apart, seeming to trickle away from the listener, but still warm, somehow; like the feeling we got, when we were playing together. When Romy laid something down on the bass, a rumbling, slapping run of notes, and Mikaela picked it up, carried it, tossed it in the air with a rattle of her hand on the high end of the piano\u2014well, that was a great feeling. It was like someone reading your mind. It left a warm feeling in our stomachs that couldn\u2019t be matched by any damn synthanol.\n \u201cBut what is the point, if nobody is listening?\u201d Romy said, one night, wandering over to the viewport and staring down into the dark expanse of the inner hull. Out the window the growth lights had dimmed for the dark hours, and only the twinkling lights on the bot control panels, like tiny roving stars, were visible.\n She had started to say things like that, a lot. And she had started to talk about other things, too, about Earth things\u2014oh, she\u2019d always talked, dreamily, about Earth, and earth, the soil, the dirt, the dust, the sand, \u201cthe weight of it, you understand? The feeling of it under your fingers?\u201d and what clay might feel like in water, what the stars might look like if you weren\u2019t on a ship moving five psol\u2014but we just thought it was nostalgia, and who were we to judge?\n But one night she missed practice, and the next time she said, casual enough, that she\u2019d gotten in with a group that was practicing survival skills, taking sessions in VR and getting on the list for shifts in the biome cylinders at the core of the ship, so they could try living off the land, learn to build a world from scratch. Fire from flint, fishing with a spear, shelter hacked from a jungle. That wasn\u2019t any nostalgia. That was the dream of life on rock, steady and stable, not shooting through space toward unknown destinations.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll never need to do things like that,\u201d Mikaela said, sharp, when she heard. If she wasn\u2019t going to make a splash with us, she\u2019d probably never make it, and she knew it; there weren\u2019t too many jazz bassists on board, not good ones\u2014so it mattered. For that, and for other reasons. \u201cYou know that, right? We won\u2019t need to start from scratch, we\u2019ve got all the tech we need, we\u2019ve got the manual for starting society again, whenever we\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLeave it alone, Mikaela,\u201d Fe said, watching Romy, who was plucking a little low melody, sad and spare.\n But Mikaela wasn\u2019t done. \u201cAnd anyway even if we didn\u2019t have all that, it wouldn\u2019t be you doing it, would it? It wouldn\u2019t even be your children\u2019s children.\u201d\n \u201cSo what?\u201d Romy said, smacking an open hand against the strings, so the bass seemed to thrum with anger. \u201cSo what, and so instead I should do jazz? You think this matters? That we will need this jazz, wherever it is we are going?\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d Mikaela said, nearly shouting now. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll need jazz. We\u2019ll always need jazz\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBut it will not be you doing it, it will not be your children,\u201d Romy said. \u201cYou all know we are going nowhere, but no one wants to say it, so you all just pretend. This jazz business? This is just marking time.\u201d\n \u201cEnough,\u201d Art said, heavy. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n All the Things We\u2019ve Never Seen\n Never seen sunrise, never seen sunset, never seen summertime. Never been caught in a rainstorm, or slipped into the springtime sea. Never been alone, truly alone, with miles to go \u2019til the next human: even near the end you could do that, on Earth. Never set out to walk with no destination, or stayed up late to watch a meteor shower. Never seen a flock of starlings startled from rest, to swirl and dive against a blue-gray sky. Sky\u2014what was that? We had the ceiling above our heads, and then, out there\u2014space. A vacuum. Never seen our loved ones in the light of the moon. Never gotten lost.\n We thought about how we should have put down roots by now, gone beyond steel horizons to find feet on soil and wide-open spaces. How the ship hadn\u2019t been designed to go so long, and neither had we. We all dreamed of things we\u2019d never truly seen, never truly heard. Like the wind: in our dreams, we heard the wind, and the sound of birds, and we\u2019d wake up with tears, our bodies remembering an impossible world.\n Giant Leap\n \u201cShe\u2019s too young for that,\u201d Mikaela said, speaking of the thing nobody wanted to name. Romy had left early, that night, again. \u201cThe kids who were born after\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d Fe said, who had a closer eye on these things than the rest of us. \u201cIt still happens. She needs a distraction\u2014if this, if we could just . . . \u201d They sighed, and shrugged, and we knew what they meant. If we could just make something of ourselves . . .\n Art, nursing his one glass of synth brew, put it down hard on the table. \u201cThink I\u2019ll be heading out now,\u201d he said, and went; and off we went, too, quiet and bitter, to our pods to rest\u2014\n But warming up for our next show we found Mikaela grinning, riffing on C Jam Blues in one hand, pointing with the other to three people sitting at a back table, sipping uncertainly from glasses of Jae-jin\u2019s latest: the Council, in the flesh.\n We left it all on the table that night, playing like we could condense our whole lives into song: the babble of the Commons, the Babel of a dining hall, the wailing of a wake, voices raised in harmony and cacophony, drums like a lover\u2019s heartbeat under your ear at night in the sleep-tubes. It was everything we\u2019d wanted to say: the shipboard life, its loves and its losses, in music.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Jae-jin said, to Fe, as we packed things up that night, a bit giddy. The Council had liked us, we thought\u2014and we were right: not a Tenthday went by before we got the embossed invite to play on the Commons, the first time some of us had ever seen real paper.\n \u201cFor what?\u201d Fe said.\n Jae-jin shrugged toward the three councilors, chatting in one corner with Mikaela.\n Fe shook their head. \u201cYou think I\u2019ve got this type of pull? That\u2019s not how credit reg works.\u201d\n \u201cWho, then?\u201d\n And that was how we realized that Art had gotten us in front of the Council. Art! What a mystery he was. We looked at the old saxophonist, and wondered.\n Amy\n Sometimes, at the end of a session, when the rest of us were pulling up to the bar, Art would linger behind and play a little tune. If it hadn\u2019t been on a sax, we might have said it sounded folksy; and once Fe said it sounded like a lullaby, but Art didn\u2019t say anything back.\n Late on the night before our gig on the Commons, just before we packed it in for the night, Mikaela picked out a version of the tune, simple, just in the right hand, and Jae-jin took it up, real quiet, and suddenly everyone was in except Art. We thought maybe he wouldn\u2019t join\u2014he could be stubborn like that\u2014but suddenly, out of the warm ring of the repeated tune, he broke into this golden, chaotic riff, ripping through the tune too fast, and then too slow, and then just right, repeating it like we were playing a round. We couldn\u2019t believe what we were hearing. He was pulling us up there, into some sort of hallowed, golden space, like the dream of sunlight, and for once, we all went there.\n When we came back down, nobody said anything. We just nodded, once. It was too late to talk names; but that night on the Commons, when Mikaela said, \u201cLet\u2019s play that song,\u201d we all knew which one she meant. When we played it that night, we were great: not just good, but great. We could hear it, the audience could hear it. At the end they stood up for us.\n Memoria\n Our quietest song, and our slowest. It opened with a bass solo, played arco, a shadowy melody exhaling beneath Romy\u2019s bow. We can still picture her, all these years later, leaning into that airy hum as if pressing into an imaginary wind. Out beyond her, under the gleaming lights, the ship transformed by the act of listening, into a temple, a hallowed place . . .\n Well. The things you remember.\n Two hours after that show on the Commons we found ourselves deep in the archives, jubilant, swirling in Mikaela\u2019s determined wake.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she said, when we asked what she was looking for.\n The archives were perpetually dim, like the time of day on Earth known as dusk, and hushed, as if someone had wrapped the rooms in a quilt. (A quilt was one of those things we had in the archives, back then. Maybe we don\u2019t anymore, we don\u2019t know; as the years pass there will be less and less space for what we were, all of that pushed out by whatever we become. They were only built for a hundred and fifty years of remembering, and so things will be jettisoned out into space, leaving a trail of human footprints across the galaxy.)\n \u201cHere,\u201d Mikaela said, finally, pulling something out of a drawer. It was a bottle of gleaming spirits. \u201cIt\u2019s whiskey,\u201d she said to Jae-jin, and opened it, casual. From somewhere on her chair she pulled out five little glasses, and began to pour.\n \u201cAre we . . . are we allowed to drink it?\u201d Jae-jin asked, awed.\n Mikaela shrugged. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to come looking for it for, what, five hundred years? And by then, well . . . I figure we drink some of it now, while we know someone might appreciate it.\u201d\n The first sip was sweet liquid starlight; Jae-jin\u2019s efforts had more in common with synthanol than they did with this. He looked crestfallen for a moment, but then, buoyed: \u201cI probably need to barrel mine for longer,\u201d he said.\n Then Mikaela said, \u201cWe need a name for that song,\u201d knowing that it would go into the databanks, join the music we carried with us. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few ideas\u2014\u201d\n We cut her off. The honors for this one belonged to Art.\n \u201cAlright,\u201d Art murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it Amy, then.\u201d\n Sure, we said. That sounded fine. Then someone\u2014memory serves, it was Jae-jin\u2014went and said it. \u201cWhy that? Why Amy?\u201d\n \u201cAmy\u2019s my daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cAmy was my daughter.\u201d\n After that we got real quiet.\n \u201cWhen she was little she slept real badly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I had this song I\u2019d hum to her, and sometimes it would help. Then, when she was older, she wouldn\u2019t have any other lullaby. She\u2019d say, \u2018No, Daddy. I want your song.\u2019 And then she grew up, and, you know, she could get to sleep by herself. But I never forgot that song.\u201d He paused and took a slow, cautious sip of his drink. It was the longest speech we\u2019d ever heard him make.\n \u201cIt was the guitar, with her,\u201d he said, gesturing to his saxophone case on the floor beside him. \u201cShe said she was going to play jazz with her feet in the dirt, hear the sound of jazz in atmosphere.\n \u201cThe night the news came about Gliese, she was performing on the Commons with a trio she\u2019d started. She had this solo that night . . . I\u2019ve never heard better. She came home and said, \u2018I\u2019m a hit, Daddy.\u2019\u201d He paused, and looked thoughtful. \u201cIt might be in the databanks. I don\u2019t know. Probably not. There were other things to listen to, that day.\u201d\n Romy and Fe were too young to remember that night when the news came. Mikaela had been seven, and Jae-jin four; they could remember the vidcasts, the sad robotic voice repeating over and over: Error in calculations. Catastrophic change in orbital mechanics in target system . . . Orbital mechanics: what an innocuous sounding phrase.\n \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Jae-jin had whispered, to his father, because his mother was in a fugue state, unspeaking. His mother, who he remembered as a musical presence, a song just out of sight, humming while she worked; now she was silent.\n \u201cIt means we don\u2019t have a home anymore,\u201d his father had said.\n \u201cShe was fifteen, when we got the news,\u201d Art said. \u201cAnd eighteen, when she died.\u201d\n All of us knew people who\u2019d died of it, died of the Gliese flu\u2014the flu! What a thing to call it, when it wasn\u2019t a flu at all; the doctors, watching people carry in their loved ones, those first waves of hundreds, listless and immobile, they said it was called psychogenic death. Dying because we\u2019d lost the idea of home, and the next habitable planet was six hundred years out. Jae-jin\u2019s mother had died of it when he was still a child; and Mikaela had lost an older sister, and Fe her grandfather, and Romy two friends in one of the later waves, striking after we\u2019d already been decimated.\n \u201cMaybe it was our fault,\u201d Art said, low. \u201cThere was a recording, back then, of the sound of the wind on Gliese. Made by one of the advance drones. We played it for Amy, my wife and I, right from the day she was born. And every time we\u2019d say, \u2018This is it, this is the sound the wind makes in your new home.\u2019\u201d In his raw old voice we heard, briefly, a sobbing song, and then he swallowed it, and seemed calm again.\n \u201cA couple years later I realized I couldn\u2019t really remember what Amy looked like anymore. Oh, she had black hair, brown eyes, I knew that . . . but I couldn\u2019t picture her in my head. It was like I had forgotten Amy. But somehow, even though it\u2019s been years and years, I haven\u2019t forgotten that song.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t say anything else, and finished his whiskey in a burning gulp. The evening broke off soon after. A few of us would look into it, later, and find out that Art and his wife had split, after Amy died; she\u2019d thrown herself into community organizing, into establishing the cr\u00e8ches and the credit regs, and we had some sense then who he\u2019d appealed to in order to get the Council to our show.\n Art had lived in the temporary pods ever since, and playing jazz was pretty much the only thing he did. It had been half a century since he\u2019d first hummed his lullaby, we realized. But he still remembered that song.\n Angel\u2019s Share (Reprise)\n That was our last show, that night on the Commons.\n Oh, we came back with good intentions; we were gonna be big, we thought. But somehow, over the next few Tenthdays, some of us found that the reasons for being in a jazz band didn\u2019t seem so compelling anymore. Fe, with a newborn, was the first to go; the late nights were too much. And before we could find another drummer, Romy got busy with other things. She stopped talking about dirt after that night, and started making historical VRs about our shipboard history. They were good, too\u2014they still show them in all the cr\u00e8ches. It was nice, we agreed, to see ourselves as making history, and not just\u2014what had she said? Not just marking time.\n After that it didn\u2019t seem like there was much point, and so when Jae-jin told Mikaela that he was giving up the bar, it wasn\u2019t a real blow. He wanted to try something new, he said, apologetic. He went on to wine making, with synth grapes, and made a drink that was very popular for a while. Ever had wine labeled with a picture of a trumpet spilling out roses? That\u2019s Jae-jin.\n And Art\u2014well, none of us ever saw him again, after the band\u2019s last practice. And a few years later, when we looked up Artur Wisniewski in the ship directory, we found it said not listed.\n Most of the songs died with the band. You lose them, after a while, we all agreed on that; when you don\u2019t play, they seep out of you, in puddles of sweat, in tears while you sleep. Even Mikaela, back playing solo and touring the deep-ship dives, said she couldn\u2019t recall the songs we\u2019d once played. There was no record anywhere with those tunes inscribed in its grooves; they\u2019d just disappeared, like they\u2019d never been. All that was left was the names.\n That last song is the databanks, though, if you want to hear it. Mikaela was right about that. Afterward, when the band was done, she went in and labeled it Amy, but she couldn\u2019t listen to it. None of us could.\n It didn\u2019t matter, though; that was the one song each of us would always know. Sometimes, before a show, Mikaela would catch herself warming up with that particular refrain, and flinch; and Jae-jin would find his fingers pressing down a certain run of imaginary keys in moments when he was feeling a little unnerved. Romy found herself humming it as she scrolled the databanks, looking for bits of history to unearth. Fe, late at night, when they were feeling weary, would tap a certain rhythm on the pod roof.\n There was one song that wouldn\u2019t grow out of us. We never did forget how to play that song, that song for forgotten Amy.\n Catherine George is a lawyer who lives in Vancouver, BC, with her partner and two toddlers.

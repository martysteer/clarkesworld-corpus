Beasley\u2019s wiry arm with its bioluminescent tattoos is near sheared from its socket, and below his hips he\u2019s nothing but pulped meat and splinters of bone.\nHe\u2019s still alive, still mumbling, maybe about the woman Elliot saw in a little holo with her arms thrown around his neck, back before Beasley\u2019s dreadlocked mane was shaved off and a conscript clamp was implanted at the top of his spine.\n\u201cHis impact kit never triggered,\u201d someone says, as if that\u2019s not fucking obvious, as if he could have been ragdolled out of the transport otherwise.\n\u201cIs the autosurgeon trashed?\u201d someone else, maybe Tolliver, says. Elliot\u2019s ears are still ringing from the crash and his head swimming from what he was doing before it and all the voices seem to blend. He knows, dimly, that he should be giving orders by now.\n\u201cAn autosurgeon can\u2019t do shit for him. What\u2019s it going to do, cauterize him at the waist?\u201d\n\u201cGet him some paineaters at least. Numb him up.\u201d\n\u201cShock\u2019s done that already.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cI fucking hope that.\u201d\nBeasley is still trying to talk, but it\u2019s all a choking wet burble from the blood in his mouth. The nudge, though, comes through. It slides into the corner of Elliot\u2019s optic implant, blinking poisonous yellow. A little ripple goes through the rest of the squad, which means they got it, too. A couple of them reflexively clap their hands to the backs of their necks, where the caked scar tissue is still fresh enough to itch.\nElliot realizes that down here in the bog, cut off from command, the clamp at the top of Beasley\u2019s spine no longer needs official permission to trigger its nanobomb. All it needs is consensus.\n\u201cI\u2019d want it done for me,\u201d Tolliver says, wiping a glisten of sweat off his face. His upvote floats into the digital queue. He chews at his lip, shoots Elliot a look that Elliot carefully ignores.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Santos from the lunar colony says, which is as much as she\u2019s ever said. \u201cTrigger him.\u201d Another upvote appears, then another, then three more in a cascade. Elliot sees that he has a veto option\u2014something they didn\u2019t tell him when they stuck him as squad leader. He looks into Beasley\u2019s glazed eyes and completes the consensus, floating his vote to the queue.\nThe nanobomb goes off, punching a precise hole through the brainstem and cutting every string at once. Beasley slumps.\nApart from that, injuries are minimal. Everyone else\u2019s kits went off properly, as evidenced by the gritty orange impact gel still slathering their uniforms. Elliot picks it off himself in clumps while he surveys damage to the R12 Heron transport settling in its crater at the end of a steaming furrow of crushed flora and shed metal. The anti-air smartmine shredded their primary rotor when it detonated, and the crash itself did the rest of the work. The Heron\u2019s not going to fly again.\n\u201cShould get them fuel cells out of her,\u201d says Snell, who is scarecrow skinny with a mouth full of metal, and dark enough so his shaved scalp seems to gleam blue-black. \u201cIn case there\u2019s leakage.\u201d Aside from Beasley, who\u2019s being wrestled into a body bag, Snell is the only one who knows flyers worth a damn. They conscripted him for smuggling human cargo on a sub-orbital.\n\u201cYou do that,\u201d Elliot says, when he realizes Snell is waiting for go-ahead. \u201cGet one of the Prentii to help. They\u2019re digging.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean one of the twins?\u201d Snell asks, with a grin that makes his metallic teeth gnash and scrape. Elliot did mean the twins, Privates Prentiss and Prentiss. The nickname slipped out, something Tolliver calls them the same way he calls Snell \u201cThe Smell\u201d and Mirotic \u201cMiroglitch.\u201d If he has one for Elliot, too, he doesn\u2019t use it when they\u2019re together.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cGet one of the twins.\u201d\nSnell pulls on a diagnostic glove and clambers into the Heron carcass; Elliot turns to check on the perimeter. If they hadn\u2019t gone down over swampland, where the rubbery blue-purple ferns and dense-packed sponge trees provided a cushion, the crash might have been a lot worse. Their impact cleared a swathe on one side of the transport. On the other, Mirotic is calibrating the cyclops.\nElliot watches the red-lit sensory bulb strain on its spindly neck and spin in a slow circle. \u201cWhat\u2019s it see?\u201d he asks.\nMirotic is tapped in, with his optic implant glowing the same red as the surveillance unit. \u201cNothing hot and moving but us. Bog gets denser to the east and south. Lots of those sponge trees, lots of subterranean fungi. No radio communications. Could be more anti-air mines sitting masked, though.\u201d\nHis English is airtight, but still carries a Serbian lilt. Before they clamped him, he was upper-level enforcement in a Neo-European crime block on Kettleburn. He once personally executed three men and two women in an abandoned granary and had their corpses put through a thresher. Only Elliot has access to that back-record. To everyone else, Mirotic is a jovial giant with a bristly black beard and high-grade neural plugs.\nPrentiss, Jan, trundles past, having received Snell\u2019s nudge for a hand with the fuel cells. He wipes wet dirt off on his tree-trunk thighs. Both he and his sister are nearly tall as Mirotic, and both are broader.\n\u201cSoil\u2019s no good for graves,\u201d Prentiss rumbles over his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get churned up again. Watch.\u201d\n\u201cHow many drones came out intact?\u201d Elliot asks Mirotic, trying to sound sharp, trying not to imagine Beasley\u2019s body heaved back to the surface.\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cI can fix a third, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cSend one up,\u201d Elliot says, scratching his arm. \u201cGet a proper map going.\u201d\nMirotic hesitates. \u201cIf I send up a drone, we might trigger another smartmine.\u201d\nElliot hadn\u2019t thought of that. He hasn\u2019t thought of a lot of things, but rescinding the order would make him look off, make him look shook, maybe even remind Mirotic of the night he saw him with the syringe.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you keep it low,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cScrape the tree line, no higher. And keep it brief.\u201d\nMirotic takes a battered drone from its casing and unfolds it in his lap, sitting cross-legged on the damp earth. As it rises into the air, whirring and buzzing, his eyes turn bright sensory blue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange there\u2019s no animal life,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cNothing motile on the sensor but insects. Could be a disease came through. Bioweapon, even. Seen it in the woods around New Warsaw, dead and empty just like this.\u201d He rests his thick hands on his knees. \u201cWe could have everyone jack up their immunity boosters.\u201d\nElliot takes the hint and sends a widecast order to dial up immunity and use filtration, at least for the time being. Then he goes to where Tolliver and Santos are vacuum-sealing Beasley\u2019s body bag, the filmy material wrapping him tight like a shroud. Tolliver looks up at his approach, flicking dark lashes. He has smooth brown skin and sly smiles and a plastic-capped flay a skin artist did for him on leave that shows off the muscle and tendon of his arm in a graceful gash. Elliot has felt it under his fingertips, cool and hard. He knows Tolliver is fucking at least one other squadmate, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s Santos.\n\u201cMe and Tolliver will finish up,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cGo spot for Mirotic. He\u2019s tapped in. Then get the tents up.\u201d\n\u201cSir.\u201d Santos\u2019s the only one on the squad who says sir, who salutes, and she does both with enough irony to slice through power armor. Santos was a foot soldier for one of the Brazilian families up on the lunar colony. She looks like a bulldog, squinty eyes and pouched cheeks. Her clamp didn\u2019t go in right and there\u2019s double the scarring up her head.\nWhen Santos leaves, still sneering, Elliot drops to a crouch. \u201cDid they know each other?\u201d he asks, grabbing the foot end of the body bag. Tolliver takes the other and they carefully stand up.\n\u201cTalked Portuguese together sometimes,\u201d he says. \u201cBeasley knew a bit. Said the moony accent\u2019s a real bitch to follow, though.\u201d\nElliot tells himself that this is why he needs Tolliver on his side, because Tolliver sees the webs, sees all the skinny bonds of social molecule that run through the squad.\n\u201cFucked up seeing him halfway gone like that,\u201d Tolliver says, with a put-on hardness to his voice. \u201cAt least the clamp is good for something, right?\u201d\nElliot grunts in response as they carry Beasley away from the downed Heron, away from the surveillance unit and the carbon-fiber tents now blooming around it.\n\u201cWhen I said we could give him paineaters, that vein in your forehead, it went big,\u201d Tolliver says, almost conversationally. \u201cYou were in the back when they hit us. You were in the medcab again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming down,\u201d Elliot says, even as his itching arm gives another twinge. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying off it. Staying sharp.\u201d\nTolliver says nothing, and then they\u2019re at the hole where the other Prentiss, Noam, is waiting with a spade slung over her shoulder. They lower the body bag in slowly, gently. Elliot reaches down for a fistful of damp earth and crumbles it over Beasley\u2019s shrouded face. Tolliver does the same. Prentiss starts shoveling.\n\u201cWe got the extraction request through before we lost altitude,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cWon\u2019t be down here long.\u201d\nTolliver gives him a sidelong look. \u201cSome of us will be,\u201d he says, then turns and leaves.\nElliot stays to watch until the body bag has disappeared completely under thick wet dirt.\nDusk drops fast on Pentecost, dyeing the sky and swamp a cold eerie blue for a half-hour before plunging them into pitch dark. Most of the squad already have peeled eyes\u2014the night vision surgery is a common one for criminals\u2014and Elliot orders all lights dimmed to minimum to conserve the generator.\nElliot has a tent to himself. He lies back stiff on his cot in the dark and reviews mission parameters in his optic implant, scrolling up and down over words he\u2019s read a thousand times. They were heading north to reinforce Osuna, cutting slantwise across marshy no-man\u2019s land the rebels usually stay away from. They were not expecting hostiles on the way, and now they\u2019re grounded at least a thousand klicks from the nearest outpost.\nElliot tries to calculate how long the paineaters and emergency morphine he salvaged from the shattered medcab will last him. Then he accesses his personal files in his implant and watches the one clip he hasn\u2019t deleted yet, the one he watches before he sleeps.\n\u201cShe\u2019s awake . . . Just looking around . . . \u201d\nHis wife\u2019s voice draws three syllables out of awake, drags on around, high and sweet and tinged weary. His daughter\u2019s soft and veiny head turns. Her bright black eyes search, and Elliot can pretend they see him.\nSomething scrapes against the side of the tent. He blinks the clip away, hauls upright and reaches for his weapon before he recognizes the imprint of a body pressed up flush to the fabric. Elliot swipes a door with his hand and Tolliver slides through, already halfway undressed.\n\u201cTold the Smell I\u2019m out back for a long shit,\u201d Tolliver says, working his stiff cock with one hand, reaching for Elliot\u2019s waistband with the other. \u201cLet\u2019s be quick.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d be coming,\u201d Elliot says, helping yank the fatigues off. \u201cBecause of Beasley.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking talk about Beasley,\u201d Tolliver says.\nElliot doesn\u2019t, and Tolliver\u2019s body all over his is second best to a morphine hit for helping him not think about that or anything else. But when he comes it\u2019s a throb and a trickle and then everything turns lukewarm dead again. Afterward, Tolliver sits on the edge of the cot and peels his spray-on condom off in strips.\n\u201cJan went walkabout in the swamp a bit,\u201d he says, because this has been the usual trade since they deployed last month. \u201cThink he\u2019s testing the range limit for the clamp. Wants to skate, maybe. Him and his sister.\u201d\n\u201cIn the middle of a mined bog?\u201d Elliot asks, pulling his fatigues back on.\n\u201cThey\u2019re both settlement-bred,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cColonist genemix, you know, they think they\u2019re invincible. Probably think they can tough it out and get south to the spaceport.\u201d\n\u201cHe told you that he wants to desert?\u201d\nTolliver takes a drink from Elliot\u2019s water bottle and runs his tongue along his teeth. \u201cHe told me he did some exploring,\u201d he says. \u201cWanted to jaw about some odd bones he found. I filled in the rest.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he find?\u201d Elliot asks.\n\u201cAnimal bones,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cReally white, really clean.\u201d\n\u201cMirotic thinks a plague might have come through,\u201d Elliot says, instead of saying a bioweapon. \u201cThere\u2019d be bones.\u201d\n\u201cPlagues don\u2019t usually put them in neat little heaps,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cHe said they were all piled up. A little mound of skeletons.\u201d\nTolliver swipes a door and disappears, leaving Elliot sweat-soaked and sick-feeling. He only hesitates a moment before he gropes under the bedroll for his syringe. Before he can start prepping his favorite vein, the cyclops starts to wail.\nEveryone is out of their tents and armed in a few minutes, clustered around the cyclops. Half of them are rubbing their eyes as the peel sets in and turns their irises reflective. Elliot switches to night vision in his implant, lighting the shadows radiation green. The air sits damp and heavy on his shoulders, and with no breeze nothing moves in the flora. The stubby sponge trees and wide-blade ferns are dead still.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d Elliot asks Noam, counting heads.\n\u201cTaking a shit out back,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019ll have heard it, though.\u201d\nMirotic is tapped in now, his implant blinking red. \u201cJust one bogey,\u201d he says. \u201cThirty meters out. Looks like some kind of animal.\u201d\n\u201cYou set it to wail for every fucking swamp rat that wanders through?\u201d Snell says. His face is still streaked with soap.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot bigger than a rat,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cDon\u2019t know what it is. It hasn\u2019t got vitals. It isn\u2019t warm.\u201d\n\u201cMechanical?\u201d Elliot asks, thinking of the spider-legged hunter-killers they used to drag rebels out of their caves around Catalao. Tech has a way of trickling over in these long engagements, whether stolen or sold off on the side.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not moving like any of the crawlers I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cCircling now, toward the back of us. Fast. Jan\u2019s still squatting back there.\u201d\nSome of the squad swivel instinctively. Elliot pulls up Jan\u2019s channel. \u201cPrentiss, there\u2019s a bogey heading towards you,\u201d he says. \u201cMight be mechanical. Get eyes on it.\u201d\nJan\u2019s reply crackles. \u201cHard to miss,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking glowing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is it?\u201d Elliot says. \u201cYou armed?\u201d\nJan\u2019s reply does not come by channel, but his howl punctures the still night air. Elliot is knocked back as Noam barrows past him, unslinging her gnasher and snapping the safety off. Snell\u2019s fast behind, and then the others, and then Elliot finds himself rearguard. He\u2019s still fumbling for his weapon when he rounds the back of the downed Heron.\nHis eyes slip-slide over the scene, trying to make sense of the nightmarish mass of bioluminescence and spiky bone that\u2019s enveloped Jan almost entirely. His night vision picks out a trailing arm, a hip, a boot exposed. The creature is writhing tight around Jan\u2019s body, spars of bone rasping against each other, and the glowing flesh of it is moving, slithering. The screams from inside are muffled.\nSnell fires first, making Elliot\u2019s dampers swell like wet cotton in his ear canals. The spray of bullets riddle the length of the creature, and a fine spray of red blood\u2014Jan\u2019s blood\u2014flicks into the air.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking shoot!\u201d Noam smacks Snell\u2019s weapon down and lunges forward, reaching for her brother\u2019s convulsing arm. Before he can grab hold, the creature retreats toward the tree line with Jan still ensnared, unnervingly fast.\nIt claws itself forward on a shifting pseudopod of bone spines, moving like a scuttling blanket. Someone else fires a shot, narrowly missing Noam running after it. The creature slithers into the trees, for an instant Noam is silhouetted against the eerie glow of it, then both of them disappear in the dark.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cI mean, shit.\u201d\nElliot thinks that\u2019s as good a summary as any. He can still see Noam\u2019s vitals, and Jan\u2019s too, both of them spiked hard with adrenaline but alive. They\u2019ll be out of range in less than a minute.\n\u201cI hit it,\u201d Snell says. \u201cRaked it right along its, I don\u2019t know, its abdomen. Didn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d\n\u201cYou hit Jan. That blood spray, that was Jan.\u201d\n\u201cJan\u2019s inside it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going after them, right?\u201d\nElliot looks around at the squad\u2019s distorted faces. Tolliver\u2019s eyes gleam like a cat\u2019s in the dark. There is no protocol for men being dragged away by monsters in the night. He opens his jaw; shuts it again. Mirotic shifts in his peripheral, taking a half-step forward, shoulders thrust back, and Elliot knows he is a nanosecond from taking the squad over, and maybe that would be better for everyone.\n\u201cMirotic,\u201d he says. \u201cYou stay. Get a drone up and guide us bird\u2019s eye. Everyone else, on me.\u201d\nPlunging through the dark swamp, Elliot expects every mud-sucked step to trigger another smartmine. Sweat pools in the hollow of his collarbone. The whine of the drone overhead shivers in his clenched teeth, and the squad is silent except for heavy breathing, muted curses as they follow its glowing path in their implants. The Prentii\u2019s signal comes and goes like a static ghost.\nThe warped green-and-black blur of his night vision, the drone\u2019s shimmering trail of digital breadcrumbs, the memory of the monster and Jan\u2019s disembodied thrashing arm\u2014none of it seems quite real. A nightmare, or more likely an overdose.\n\u201cRebels stay out of these swamps,\u201d Snell says aloud, dredging something from his post-clamp war briefing. \u201cAll the colonists do.\u201d His voice is thin and tight.\nNobody replies. The drone\u2019s pathway hooks left, into the deepest thicket of sponge trees, and they follow it. Pungent-smelling leaves slap against Elliot\u2019s head and shoulders. It reminds him almost of the transplanted eucalyptus trees where he grew up on Earth.\n\u201cCan\u2019t get any closer with the drone,\u201d comes Mirotic\u2019s crackly voice in his ear. \u201cTrees are too high, too dense. They\u2019re right ahead of you. Close now.\u201d\nThe twins\u2019 signal flares in Elliot\u2019s skull, but their channels are shut and their vitals are erratic. Elliot\u2019s feels his heart starting to thrum too fast. Eyes blink and heads twitch as the rest of the squad picks up the signal. Tolliver\u2019s face is drawn, his mouth half-open. Santos is unreadable. Snell looks ready to shit himself. Hands tighten on stocks. Fingers drift to triggers.\nThe sponge trees thin out, and Elliot sees the same bioluminescence that swallowed Jan whole. The shape of it is indistinct, too bright for his night vision, so he flicks it off. When he closes and reopens his eyes, he sees what\u2019s become of the twins.\nThey are tangled together in a grotesque parody of affection, limbs wrapping each other, and it\u2019s impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins because they are coated in a writhing skin of ghostly blue light. Long shafts of dull gray bone, humors or femurs from an animal Elliot knows was not killed by any plague, skewer them in place like a tacked specimen.\nReminding himself it might be a hallucination, Elliot steps slowly forward.\n\u201cPrentiss?\u201d\nA sluggish ripple goes through the twins\u2019 tangled bodies. Elliot follows the motion and finds a neck. A head not covered over. Noam\u2019s eyes are wide open and terrified. Elliot watches her face convulse trying to speak, but when her bruised mouth opens, glowing blue tendrils spill out of her throat. It\u2019s inside her. Elliot recoils. In his own throat, he feels bile rising and burning.\n\u201cShit, they\u2019re conscious,\u201d Tolliver breathes. \u201cWhat is that stuff? What the fuck is . . . ?\u201d He reaches for Noam\u2019s cheek with one hand, but before he makes contact the other head, Jan\u2019s, buried somewhere near his sister\u2019s thigh, begins to wail. It\u2019s a raw animal noise Elliot has only ever heard men make when they are torn apart, when their limbs have been blown off, when shock and pain have flensed them down to the reptile brain and all it knows to do is scream.\nHe claws Tolliver\u2019s hand back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to run a scan, or . . . \u201d He looks at the bones pinning them in place, at the writhing cloak that looks almost like algae, now, like glowing blue algae. He has no idea what to do.\n\u201cLook at the feet,\u201d Santos says thickly. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nElliot looks. Noam\u2019s feet are not feet any more. The skin and muscle has been stripped away, leaving bits of bone, crumbling with no tendon to hold them together.\n\u201cKill them,\u201d Santos says. \u201cIt\u2019s eating them alive.\u201d She pulls her sidearm and aims it at Jan\u2019s screaming mouth. Her hand tremors.\nElliot doesn\u2019t tell her no. It would be mercy, now, to kill them. Same how it was mercy for Beasley.\nA vein bulges up Santos\u2019s neck. \u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she grunts. \u201cThe implant.\u201d\nElliot aims his own weapon at Jan and as his finger finds the trigger he finds himself paralyzed, blinking red warnings scrolling over his eyes. Convict squads have insurance against friendly fire same as any other. Maybe in a combat situation the parameters would loosen a little, but this, an execution, is out-of-bounds.\n\u201cSend the nudge, Noam.\u201d Tolliver squats down by her wide-eyed face. \u201cYou in there? You gotta send the nudge. So we can trigger you. Come on, Noam.\u201d\nThe yellow message doesn\u2019t appear. Maybe Noam is too angry, too colonist, thinking she is invincible, thinking somehow she\u2019ll get out of this scrape how she got out of all the other ones. More likely her mind is too far gone to access the implant. Jan starts to scream again.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fucking do it manual, then,\u201d Tolliver says, with his voice shaking. He looks at Snell. \u201cGive me your knife. Unless you want to do it.\u201d\nSnell wordlessly unclips his combat knife and slings it over, handle-first. It\u2019s a long wicked thing, not regulation or even close. Elliot thinks he should offer to do it. He\u2019s in command, after all. He knows where the jugular is and where to slit it without dousing himself in blood. But he only watches.\nAnd the instant Tolliver touches Noam\u2019s head, all hell breaks loose. The monsters come from everywhere at once, scuttling masses of bone and bioluminescence. From the ground, Elliot realizes dimly even as he backpedals, keys his night vision, opens fire. The rest of the squad is doing the same; splinters fly where bullets hit bone but the skin of things, the blue algae, just splits and reforms.\nSubterranean fungi. He remembers that from the topography scan as Tolliver klicks empty and fumbles his reload.\n\u201cGet the fuck out,\u201d comes Mirotic\u2019s voice. \u201cThey\u2019re coming on your twelve, your three. Lots of them.\u201d\nDoesn\u2019t matter. The thought spears through Elliot\u2019s mind. Doesn\u2019t matter if he dies here or on Kettleburn or wherever else. He\u2019s been dead for ages.\nThen Tolliver goes down, tripped by a monster clamping its bony appendages around his legs like a vice. Elliot aims low and for gray, shattering enough bones for Tolliver to wriggle out, to swap clips. But bullets aren\u2019t enough here.\nElliot loads the incendiary grenade as Tolliver scrambles free. He tries to remember the chemical compositions here on Pentecost. For all he knows, it might light up the whole fucking swamp. For all he knows, that might be a better way to die than getting flensed alive.\n\u201cRun,\u201d Elliot orders, and sends the fire-in-the-hole warning spike at the same time. \u201cLeave them.\u201d\nSantos rips past him, then Snell, then Tolliver right after, no protest, his reflective eyes wide and frantic in the dark. With adrenaline turning everything slow and sharp, Elliot fires the grenade where he thinks the splash will be widest, hitting the dirt between two of the surging creatures. He remembers to blink off his night vision only a nanosecond before the explosion.\nA wall of searing heat slams over his body and even without night vision the blossoming fireball all but blinds him. He feels Tolliver grabbing his shoulder, guiding him out of the thicket. Through the roar in his ears, he can\u2019t be sure if Jan is still screaming.\nThey are sitting in the husk of the downed Heron, grouped around a heater. Every so often someone glances toward the cyclops, which is still whirring and spinning and searching. Santos has a bruise on her forehead from where the butt of Snell\u2019s gnasher clipped her in the dark. Tolliver cut his thumb falling. Other than that, they are all fine, except Elliot hasn\u2019t been able to get to his syringe.\n\u201cSo there was no plague,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cOnly a predator.\u201d\n\u201cThat thing was artificial,\u201d Snell says. His eyes look wild, bloodshot, and his hand keeps going to the spot where his knife used to be. \u201cNo way could that evolve, man. It\u2019s a weapon.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s organic, whatever it is,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cLooked on the scan like a fungus.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weapon, and they dumped us here to test it.\u201d Snell\u2019s voice ratchets high. \u201cThat fucking smartmine was probably one of ours. We\u2019re expendable, right? So they dumped us here to see if it works.\u201d\nElliot waits for someone to tell Snell to settle the fuck down, but instead Santos and Tolliver and Mirotic are all looking at him, waiting for his response. Tolliver plucks at the bandage around his hand, anxious.\n\u201cThe colonists stay out of these swamps,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cYou said that yourself.\u201d He has a flash of the twins\u2019 twisted bodies, the scuttling monsters. \u201cI figure now we know why.\u201d\n\u201cWhen do we get extracted?\u201d Santos asks flatly. \u201cSir.\u201d\nElliot knows they are low priority. Maybe five days, maybe six. Maybe more. \u201cThey know we\u2019re rationed for a week,\u201d he says.\n\u201cA fucking week?\u201d Snell grinds his metal teeth. \u201cMan, we can\u2019t be out here a week with that thing. I\u2019m not ending up like the twins, man. I say we carry what we can, and we get out of here.\u201d\n\u201cTo where?\u201d Mirotic asks. \u201cThe fungus extends under the ground in all directions.\u201d\n\u201cIf you knew about this, why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d Snell demands.\nMirotic\u2019s nostrils flare. \u201cBecause fungus is not usually predatory.\u201d\nElliot tries to focus on the back-and-forth, tries to think of what they should do now that they know the swamp is inhabited by monsters. He realizes he is scratching at his arm.\nSantos looks over. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\nBut she isn\u2019t looking at Elliot. Tolliver, who has been silent, ash-faced, is clutching at his bandaged thumb. He looks down at it now and his eyes widen. A faint blue glow is leaking from underneath the cling wrap.\n\u201cOh, shit, oh, shit, I feel it.\u201d Tolliver is twisting on the cot, sweat snaking down his face. \u201cI can feel it. Moving.\u201d\nThe bandages are off his hand now and his cut thumb is speckled with the glowing fungus. The autosurgeon unfolds over his chest like a metal spider while Mirotic searches for the right removal program, his eyes scrolling code. Elliot feels a panic in his throat that he never feels during combat. It reminds him of the panic he felt last time he spoke to his daughter.\nHe crouches down and holds Tolliver\u2019s free hand where Snell and Santos can\u2019t see. It\u2019s slippery from the sweat.\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Mirotic says thickly. \u201cBiological contaminant.\u201d\nThe autosurgeon comes to life, reaching with skeletal pincers to hold Tolliver\u2019s left arm in place. Carmine laserlight plays over his skin, scanning, then the numbing needle dips in with machine precision to prick the base of his thumb.\nTolliver\u2019s free hand clenches tight around Elliot\u2019s.\n\u201cHate these things,\u201d he groans, locking eyes for a moment. \u201cRather let the Smell use that big old fucking knife than have a bot digging around\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t have dropped it, then,\u201d Snell says.\nTolliver swivels, his mouth pulls tight in a grimace. \u201cFuck you, Snell.\u201d\nThe autosurgeon deploys a scalpel. Metal slides and scrapes and the sound shivers in Elliot\u2019s teeth. Mirotic is looking over at him, and when he speaks he realizes why.\n\u201cThe spores are moving. Autosurgeon wants to take the whole thumb.\u201d\nA wince ripples through the tent; Santos clutches his own thumb tight between two knuckles. Tolliver\u2019s eyes go wide. He tries to yank his arm away, but the autosurgeon holds tight.\n\u201cNo!\u201d he barks. \u201cNo, don\u2019t let it! Turn the fucking thing off!\u201d\n\u201cIt could spread through his body if we aren\u2019t fast,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cHow you said it did to Prentiss and Prentiss.\u201d\nElliot swallows. He isn\u2019t a medic. What they drilled into his head, from basic onwards, was to trust the autosurgeon. And he doesn\u2019t want Tolliver to end up like the twins.\n\u201cDo it,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cTurn it off!\u201d Tolliver wails. \u201cListen! Listen to me, you fucks!\u201d\nHis free hand thrashes but Elliot holds it tight, not caring anymore if Santos and Snell can see it, as the scalpel descends.\n\u201cThe program\u2019s running,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cToo late to stop it.\u201d\nThe blade makes no sound as it slices through the skin, the tendon, the bone. The autosurgeon catches the squirt of bright red blood and whisks it away. Tolliver howls. His spine arches. His hand clamps to Elliot\u2019s hard enough to bruise.\nElliot sits underneath the cyclops, listening to it whir. He said they would sleep in shifts, that he would watch first, as if his vitreous eyes might catch something the sensors miss. Partly because he had to say something. Give some kind of order. Mostly because he needed a hit.\nNow, with the morphine swimming warm through his veins, he feels light. He feels calm. His heartbeat is so slow it is almost an asymptote.\n\u201cHe screamed so much because there was no anesthetic in the autosurgeon.\u201d\nElliot turns to see Mirotic, holding a black plastic cube in his hand. He understands the words, but his guilt breaks apart against the high and then dissipates. Tolliver will be fine. Everything will be fine. He tries to shrink the chemical smile on his face, so Mirotic won\u2019t see it.\n\u201cEverybody knows why,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of it?\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for a reply. He snatches the rattling sock out of Elliot\u2019s lap and yanks him to his feet. Mirotic is tall. But he\u2019s slow, too, the way everything is slow on the morphine, and Elliot still has his old tricks.\nA hook, a vicious twist, then Mirotic is on the ground with the needle of the syringe poised a centimeter from his eyeball.\n\u201cI need that,\u201d Elliot says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re pathetic,\u201d Mirotic grunts. \u201cHolding his hand and wasting his morphine.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Elliot asks, suspicious now, wondering if maybe it\u2019s Mirotic who Tolliver visits in the night when he doesn\u2019t come to him.\nMirotic slaps the syringe away and drives a knee up into Elliot\u2019s chest. The air slams out of him, but he feels only impact, no pain. He staggers away, bent double. If his lungs were working he would maybe laugh.\n\u201cI care because you used to know what the fuck you were doing,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cBack before they stuck you with a con squad.\u201d He taps the high-grade neural plug at his temple. \u201cYou read our records. But I\u2019ve seen yours, too. These personnel firewalls aren\u2019t shit. And if we\u2019re going to get out of this, it won\u2019t be with you doped to the eyes.\u201d\n\u201cGive Private Tolliver the paineaters,\u201d Elliot rasps, straightening up. \u201cLeave the morphine. That\u2019s an order.\u201d\nMirotic shakes his head. \u201cIt stays with me, now. You\u2019ll get it when we get extracted.\u201d He tosses the black plastic cube; Elliot nearly fumbles it. \u201cWorry about this, instead,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cWorry about a fungus that eats our flesh and uses the bones like scaffolding.\u201d\nElliot turns the cube over. Through the transparent face, he sees sticky strands of the glowing blue fungus moving, wrapping around Tolliver\u2019s scoured-white knucklebone.\nIn the morning, Snell is gone.\n\u201cNever woke me for my watch,\u201d Santos says, picking gound out of the corner of her eye. \u201cI checked the tent. His kit\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now he\u2019s out of range,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cCould get the drones up to look for him. Keep them low again so we don\u2019t trigger any more mines.\u201d\nThe inside of Elliot\u2019s mouth feels like steel wool. They are standing in the sunshine, which makes his head ache, too. A cool breeze is rippling through the blue-and-purple flora. The sponge trees are swaying. It\u2019s peaceful, near to beautiful. In daylight it\u2019s hard to believe what happened only hours ago in the dark. But the twins\u2019 tent is empty, and Tolliver is drugged to sleep with bloody gauze around the stump of his thumb.\n\u201cWhy would we look for him?\u201d Elliot says.\nSantos gledges sideways at Mirotic, but neither of them speak.\n\u201cHe deserted,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t pose a threat to us, we let him walk. He\u2019ll either step on a mine or get eaten alive.\u201d He feels slightly sick imagining it, but he keeps his voice cold and calm. \u201cMirotic, rig up a saw to one of the drones, start clearing the vegetation on our flank. Make sure we have clean line of fire. No use watching them on the cyclops if we can\u2019t hit them til they\u2019re right up on us. Santos, get the comm system out of the Heron. We\u2019re going to make a radio tower.\u201d\nWhen Santos departs with her sloppy salute, there\u2019s less contempt in it than usual. Mirotic stays and stares at him for a second, suspicious. Elliot meets his gaze, pretending he doesn\u2019t care, pretending he didn\u2019t already ransack Mirotic\u2019s cot looking for the morphine while he was on watch.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Mirotic says, then goes to get the drone.\nElliot turns back toward the tents. He lets himself into the one Tolliver and Snell were sharing, and realizes Tolliver is no longer asleep. He\u2019s sitting up on the sweat-stained cot, staring down at his lap, at his hand.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Elliot asks, because he doesn\u2019t know what else to say.\n\u201cYou took my thumb.\u201d Tolliver\u2019s voice trembles. \u201cI needed that thumb. That\u2019s my good hand.\u201d\n\u201cIt was moving deeper,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had to amputate. You probably don\u2019t remember.\u201d He hopes Tolliver doesn\u2019t remember, especially not the pain.\n\u201cStill got a trigger finger, so I guess it doesn\u2019t matter to you, right?\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cStill got a mouth, still got an ass. All the parts you like.\u201d\nElliot feels heat creeping under his cheeks. \u201cYou can get a prosthetic when they pick us up,\u201d he says, clipped.\n\u201cAt this rate?\u201d Tolliver gives a bitter laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be nobody left to pick up tomorrow, fuck a week. That\u2019s if you really did get the extraction request through, and you\u2019re not just lying through your fucking teeth. I know junkies. I know all you do is lie.\u201d\nElliot wants to slip his hands around Tolliver\u2019s throat and throttle him. He wants to slip under the sheet and hold Tolliver to him and tell him they\u2019re going to make it. He does neither.\n\u201cI needed that thumb because I was going to be a welder,\u201d Tolliver snaps as Elliot goes to leave. \u201cWhen all this shit was over and I\u2019d gotten my clamp out, I was going to be a welder like my grandfather was.\u201d\nBut war is never really over, and there\u2019s a sort of clamp that doesn\u2019t come out. Elliot doesn\u2019t even remember what he used to think he was going to be. He turns over his shoulder.\n\u201cYour head\u2019s not right,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s the drugs. Try to sleep more.\u201d\n\u201cOh, fuck you,\u201d Tolliver says, somewhere between laughing and crying. \u201cFuck you, Elliot.\u201d\nElliot steps out, and the tent closes behind him like a wound scabbing shut.\nBy the time night falls, they\u2019ve cleared a perimeter, cutting away the vegetation in ragged circumference around the Heron, the tents, the cyclops. Tolliver came out to help mid-afternoon, jaw clenched tight and eyes fixed forward. Nobody mentioned his hand or even looked at it.\nThe few incendiary grenades they have in armory are distributed. Mirotic is trying to rig up a flamethrower using a soldering torch and fuel drained from the tank. Santos and Tolliver are perched on the roof of the Heron, hooking the makeshift antennae into the comm system through a tangle of wires.\nMostly busy work, Elliot knows. They can\u2019t be sure the incendiary grenade did anything but distract the fungus, and it moves fast enough that having open ground might only be to its advantage. They don\u2019t know anything about this enemy.\nBut if he keeps up appearances, maybe he can get the last of the morphine back from Mirotic without resorting to violence. Act sharp, act competent, and then when the withdrawal kicks in he won\u2019t have to exaggerate much to make Mirotic realize how much he needs it to function.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Santos says.\nElliot looks up to the roof of the Heron. Tolliver is still trying to rotate the antennae for a better signal, but all that comes through the comm system and into their linked implants is shrieking static. He dials it down in his head. They are too far from the outpost.\nThen a familiar signal comes faint and blurry. A blinking yellow nudge slides into the corner of his optic.\n\u201cSnell,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cShit.\u201d\nElliot feels a shiver go under his skin. The sky is turning dark above them. The cyclops picked up no movement during the day, but like Mirotic said, plenty of predators hunt only at night. There can only be one reason Snell would send the nudge. Elliot can picture him stumbling through the bog, maybe dragging a turned ankle, with the blue glow creeping closer and closer behind him in the dark. Or maybe the fungus already has him, is already flensing him down to his skeleton.\nTolliver\u2019s upvote appears, then Santos\u2019s. It will only take four votes now to trigger the nanobomb. Mirotic looks over at him, and Elliot doesn\u2019t think Mirotic is the merciful type. He executed three people and put their bodies through a thresher. But then Mirotic\u2019s upvote appears in the queue.\n\u201cQuick,\u201d Tolliver says, not looking at him. \u201cBefore we lose the signal.\u201d\nElliot is not sure if he\u2019s making the strong move or the weak move, but he adds his vote and completes the consensus because he still remembers Jan\u2019s screams. Everyone is silent for a moment. Santos crosses herself with the same precision she salutes.\n\u201cLeave the antennae,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cThe extraction request went through. They\u2019ll come when they come. Until then, we dig in and stay alert.\u201d\nSantos hops down off the roof of the Heron. Tolliver follows after, gingerly for his bandaged hand. Elliot looks at what\u2019s left of the squad\u2014fifty percent casualties in less than two days, and nowhere near the frontlines. Santos is steady; Elliot hasn\u2019t seen her shook once yet. Mirotic is steady. But Tolliver hasn\u2019t told a joke or barely spoken the whole day and his eyes look scared.\nElliot\u2019s still looking at Tolliver when the cyclops wails a proximity alert. He tamps down his own fear, motions for Mirotic to tap in.\n\u201cSeven bogeys,\u201d Mirotic says. \u201cDifferent sizes. Biggest one is over two meters high. They\u2019re heading right at us, not so fast this time.\u201d\nElliot flicks to night vision and watches the trees. \u201cAim for the bones,\u201d he says, remembering the previous night. \u201cThey need them to hold together. Santos, get a firebomb ready.\u201d\nSantos loads an incendiary grenade into the launcher underslung off her rifle. Tolliver has his weapon tucked up against his side, like he\u2019s bracing for auto, and Elliot remembers it\u2019s because he has no thumb. Across the carpet of chopped-down ferns and branches, he sees something emerging from the trees. It\u2019s not moving how the other ones moved.\nElliot squints and the zoom kicks in. The shambling monster is moving on three legs and its body is a spiky mess of charred bone held together by the ropy fungus. Through the glow he can make out part of a blackened skull on one side. The twins\u2019 bones, stripped and reassembled like scaffold. His stomach lurches.\nSantos curses in Portuguese. \u201cPermission to fire?\u201d she asks through her teeth.\nThe other bogeys are converging now, low and scuttling like the one that took Noam. A pack, Elliot thinks. He can feel his pulse in his throat. This isn\u2019t combat how he knows combat. Not an enemy how he knows enemies. He wonders if the flames even did any damage the night before. Bullets certainly hadn\u2019t.\n\u201cWait until they\u2019re closer,\u201d he says. \u201cNo wasted splash.\u201d\nSantos sights. Her finger drifts toward the trigger. She waits.\nBut the monsters don\u2019t come any closer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fucking with us,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cSitting out there waiting.\u201d He has a calorie bar in his hand but it\u2019s still wrapped. He\u2019s been turning it over and over in his fingers.\nSantos bites a chunk off her own ration. \u201cYou think it thinks?\u201d she asks thickly. She glances to Mirotic, who shrugs, then to Elliot, who distractedly does the same. Elliot is more concerned by the deepening itch in the crook of his arm. He needs morphine soon.\n\u201cHas to,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cIt came for Jan first. Jan was the one who went out and found the bones in the first place. Then it used Noam to lure us out.\u201d\nThe four of them are sitting under the cyclops, with a crate dragged out to hold food and dice for a game nobody is keeping track of, just rolling and passing on autopilot. Every so often Elliot has someone walk a tight circle around the Heron to check their back, in case more of the monsters try to flank them. In case the cyclops malfunctions and doesn\u2019t see them coming. Busy work.\nBut there are still only seven, and they still haven\u2019t advanced from the edge of the trees. Sometimes the fungus shifts and the bones find new positions, but they all stay in place, waiting, maybe watching, if the fungus has some way of seeing them. Mirotic suggested heat sensitivity. Mirotic, who must have the morphine hidden somewhere on his body.\nSantos is the first to finish her food. She stands up, brushing crumbs off her knees. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d she says, hefting her weapon. Elliot nods. He can\u2019t help but notice Tolliver\u2019s eyes follow Santos around the corner of the Heron, wide and worried. Maybe it is Santos he goes to see.\n\u201cBig snakes only have to eat once in a month,\u201d Tolliver says, turning his eyes back to his bandaged hand, studying the spot of red blooming through. \u201cSpend the rest of it digesting.\u201d\nMirotic snorts. \u201cThis fungus is not part of a balanced ecosystem. It killed off all the other animal life. Obliterated it.\u201d\n\u201cWish we had a fucking chinegun,\u201d Tolliver mutters.\nThen the cyclops keens, and everyone is on their feet in an instant. Elliot sights towards the tree line first, but the monsters haven\u2019t moved. Mirotic\u2019s optics blink red.\n\u201cRight behind us,\u201d he says, and whatever he says next is drowned in gunfire. Santos\u2019s signal flares hot in Elliot\u2019s head, combat active. Elliot rounds the corner of the Heron and sees Santos scrambling backward as a ghoulish mass of bone and blue bears down on her. He can\u2019t understand how the monster covered the perimeter so quickly, how the cyclops didn\u2019t spot it earlier. Then he recognizes the tatters of Beasley\u2019s polythane body bag threaded through the fungus.\nElliot shoots for bone, but the way the monster writhes as it moves makes it all but impossible. The burst sinks harmlessly into its glowing blue flesh. Tolliver is firing beside him, howling something, but through the dampers he can\u2019t hear it. The monster turns toward them, distracted. Elliot calculates; too close for a grenade. He fires again and this time sees Beasley\u2019s shinbone shatter apart.\nThe monster sags, shifting another bone in to take its place, moving what\u2019s left of Beasley\u2019s arm downward. In the corner of his eye Elliot sees Santos is on her knees, rifle braced. Her shot blows a humerus to splinters and the monster sags again. Elliot feels a flare of triumph in his chest.\nMotion in his peripherals. He spins in time to see the other seven bogeys swarm over the top of the Heron. He switches to auto on instinct and strangles the trigger, slashing back and forth. Bullets sink into the fungus, others ricochet off the Heron, spitting sparks. Some find bone but not enough. The rifle rattles his hands and then he\u2019s empty and the monsters are still coming.\nHe backs up, hands moving autonomously for the reload. Tries to get his bearings. Tolliver is still firing, still howling something he can\u2019t make out. Santos is down, legs pinned from behind. Bony claws are moving up her back; Elliot sees her teeth bared, her eyes wide. Where is Mirotic?\nThe answer comes in a jet of flame that envelops the nearest monster. It doesn\u2019t scream\u2014no mouth\u2014but as Elliot stumbles back from the heat he can see the fungus twisting, writhing, blackening to a crisp. Mirotic swings the flamethrower, painting a blazing arc in the air. Elliot reloads, sights, fires.\nSuddenly the monsters are fleeing, scuttling away. Elliot fires again and again as they round the edge of the Heron. Mirotic waves the flamethrower, Elliot and Tolliver shoot from behind him, advancing steadily. One of the monsters crumples and slicks onto its neighbor, leaving its bones behind on the dirt. Elliot keeps firing until the glow of them is completely obscured by trees.\n\u201cYou fuckers, you fuckers, you fuckers,\u201d Tolliver is saying, almost chanting.\nElliot is shaking all over. His skin is crawling with sweat. \u201cCheck on Santos,\u201d he says, and Tolliver disappears. There are aches in his back and arms and he can feel his bowels loosening for the first time in a long time. He needs to get the morphine back. He turns to Mirotic, to tell him as much, but as the big man snuffs the end of the flamethrower, he stumbles.\nA wine-red stain is blooming under his shirt. Elliot remembers the ricochet off the side of the Heron. Mirotic sits down. He methodically rolls his shirt up and exposes a weeping bullet hole in his side. Elliot can see the shape of at least one shattered rib poking at his skin.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Mirotic says, in a burble of blood.\nShattered rib, punctured lung, and probably a few other organs shredded to pieces. Gnasher bullets were designed to disperse inside the body. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d Elliot demands, squatting down face-level. \u201cWhere\u2019s the morphine?\u201d\nMirotic\u2019s face is pale as the old Earth moon. He shakes his head. He tries to speak again, says something that might be autosurgeon.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the autosurgeon,\u201d Elliot says, even though he knows it\u2019s too late for that. \u201cWhere\u2019s the morphine?\u201d\nNo response. Elliot frisks him, and by the time he pulls the vial out from Mirotic\u2019s waistband his hands are slicked scarlet. He clutches his fingers around it and gives a shuddering sigh of relief. Mirotic\u2019s eyes flutter open and shut, then stay shut. Elliot gets to his feet, head spinning, as Mirotic\u2019s vitals blink out.\nWhen he goes back around the corner of the Heron, Elliot finds Santos is dead, too. One of the fleeing monsters drove a wedge of bone through her skull, halfway smashing her clamp. Blood and gray matter are leaking from the hole. A single spark jumps from the clamp\u2019s torn wiring.\nTolliver is crossing himself and his shoulders are shaking. There\u2019s a fevered flush under his skin.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll burn her,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cMirotic, too. Any bones left, we\u2019ll crush them down to powder.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Tolliver says, in a hollowed out voice. His eyes fix on the vial clutched in Elliot\u2019s bloody hand, but he says nothing else.\nLying on his cot with his limbs splayed limp, Elliot is in paradise. He feels like his body is evaporating, or maybe turning into sunlight, warm and pure. He can hardly tell where his sooty skin ends and Tolliver\u2019s begins.\n\u201cDid you kill him for it?\u201d Tolliver\u2019s voice asks, slurred with the drug.\n\u201cRicochet,\u201d Elliot says.\n\u201cWould you have killed him for it?\u201d Tolliver asks.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Elliot asks back.\nAs soon as they dealt with the bodies, he went to the tent to shoot up. Tolliver followed him, and when Elliot offered him the syringe, already high enough to be generous, he took it. Elliot doesn\u2019t know how long ago that was.\n\u201cWhat made you like this?\u201d Tolliver asks. \u201cWhat got you so hooked? What fucked you up so bad?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one thing,\u201d Elliot says, because he is floating and unafraid. \u201cIt\u2019s never one thing. That would make it easier, right? If I was a good person, and I saw something so bad this is the only way I can . . . \u201d He puts a finger to his temple and twists it.\n\u201cForget,\u201d Tolliver supplies.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cBut there\u2019s no one thing. This job kills you with a thousand cuts.\u201d\n\u201cBut there must have been one thing,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cOne thing that got you stuck leading a con squad. Mirotic says. Said. Said you used to be somebody.\u201d\nElliot doesn\u2019t want to talk about that. \u201cWas it Santos?\u201d he asks, running his fingers along Tolliver\u2019s hip.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe nights I message you but you don\u2019t come,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cThere was someone else.\u201d\nTolliver shakes his head. \u201cYou really are a piece of shit,\u201d he says, almost laughs. \u201cYou thought that had to be the reason, huh? Never thought maybe some nights I don\u2019t really feel like fucking a drugged-up zombie who plays some pornstar in his optics the whole time?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Elliot says.\n\u201cYour wife, then,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cThat\u2019s even more fucked.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t play anything in the optics,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cI just see you. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nTolliver\u2019s voice softens a little. \u201cOh.\u201d\nOn impulse, Elliot sends him the clip. He watches it at the same time, watches his daughter\u2019s head turn, her bright eyes blink. \u201cShe\u2019s grown,\u201d he explains. \u201cTwenty-some now. Her and her mother live on old Earth. Only thing they hate more than each other is me. If I was going to get out, it would\u2019ve been years and years ago.\u201d\nHe moves his hand to Tolliver\u2019s arm, wanting to feel the cool plastic of his flay under his fingertips.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t put me with a con squad as a punishment,\u201d he says. \u201cI volunteered.\u201d\nHe looks down into the exposed swathe of red muscle on Tolliver\u2019s arm. There are tiny specks of luminescent blue nestled in the fibers. He feels a deep unease slide under his high.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get eaten from the inside,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cI don\u2019t want them using my bones.\u201d\nThe poison yellow nudge appears in Elliot\u2019s optics.\n\u201cTrigger me,\u201d Tolliver says. \u201cRight now. While everything still feels okay. You trigger me, and then do yours.\u201d\n\u201cCould take the arm,\u201d Elliot says. \u201cThe autosurgeon.\u201d\n\u201cYou said this job kills you with a thousand cuts.\u201d Tolliver uses his good hand to find Elliot\u2019s and squeeze it. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a welder. I don\u2019t want to be some fucking skeleton puppet, either. Let\u2019s just get out of here. And let\u2019s not leave anything behind.\u201d\nHis hand leaves, but leaves behind a cool hard shell. Elliot runs his thumb along the groove and recognizes the shape of Tolliver\u2019s incendiary grenade. He cups it against the side of his head. He thinks, briefly, about what the pick-up team will find when they finally arrive. What they\u2019ll think happened.\nHe thinks of Tolliver\u2019s file, the one he opened and read only once, how Tolliver had smothered his grandfather in his sleep and said it was to stop his pain, even though his grandfather had been healthy and happy. Nobody was good here. Not even Tolliver. But the two of them, they are a good match.\nOutside, the cyclops starts to wail. Elliot adds his upvote to the queue, and Tolliver goes limp in his arms. His thumb finds the grenade\u2019s pin and rests there. He thinks back to the last time everything still felt okay, then plays it in his optics, watching his daughter before she knew who he was.\n\u201cShe\u2019s awake,\u201d his wife\u2019s voice sings. \u201cJust looking around . . . \u201d\nElliot breathes deep and pulls the pin and waits for extraction.\nRich Larson (Ymir, Tomorrow Factory) was born in Galmi, Niger, has lived in Spain and Czech Republic, and is currently based in Grande Prairie, Canada.

Last year, we switched to a two-stage voting system\u2014more like a traditional two-round genre award\u2014and we intend to use the same model again this year.\nPhase 1: Nominations (mid-January)\nLater this month, we\u2019ll open for a forty-eight hour flash nomination period to identify the top five candidates in each category: story and art. The announcement for this phase will be sent out via:\n- Twitter (twitter.com/clarkesworld)\n- Facebook (www.facebook.com/clarkesworld)\n- Patreon (www.patreon.com/clarkesworld)\n- My blog (neil-clarke.com)\nThe purpose of the brevity of this phase is to create a sense of urgency and reduce the opportunities for a coordinated ballot-stuffing campaign. Last year\u2019s poll proved it to be effective at meeting these goals.\nPhase 2: Final Voting (February)\nThe five finalists in each category will be announced in my February editorial. Final voting will open on the 1st and continue through the 15th. The winners will be announced in our March issue.\nIn advance of the nomination phase, here\u2019s a list of all the eligible stories from 2018:\n- \u201cA World to Die For\u201d by Tobias S.

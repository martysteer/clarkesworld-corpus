Zeddi Bobeddi, her wagging tail threatening to helicopter her off the low-G table from familiarity with these routine checkups\u2014the treat! the impending treat!\u2014was not making this easy.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d said Doc, once the coast was clear, and while presenting the succulent spoonful that would distract Zeddi from her booster. \u201cWhat\u2019s mama done to you this time?\u201d\n The mods along Zeddi\u2019s ears and snout were not permanent, but they could do permanent damage if the wrong person saw them. Long arcs of digital metallic-green wrapped Zeddi\u2019s head in the semblance of another species entirely\u2014and not just any species, but the Hurv: a dour administrative people, from what humanity had seen of them, who were heavily engaged in negotiations with Earth diplomats elsewhere on Aleph Station. But why this look, and why now? A party trick carried over from New Year\u2019s? Or something more intentional?\n \u201cOh, your mama really loves to poke the bear, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d\n Doc patted and scratched Zeddi all over while the fine-haired basenji licked at the prize between her paws. Doc moved so swiftly that the good girl hardly noticed when her scruff was held tight, and the bone-density shot slipped in between rubs. Done and done.\n As for the alien costuming . . .\n Doc looked Zeddi square in those large, trusting, liquid-brown eyes.\n \u201cAll right, girl. This is going to look like it hurts, but I promise, it won\u2019t.\u201d\n When Ms. Tina Wilson of Dock Maintenance returned, Doc made it a point to be busy storing the rest of the shots, to let her notice on her own. Ms. Wilson\u2019s panic was genuine.\n \u201cZeddi-bear! What\u2019s happened to your ears? Doc! Is she infected?\u201d\n Doc feigned surprise while turning back to inspect the angry red rashes that had arisen around the interfaces projecting Hurvian features from the unwitting canine head.\n \u201cI was afraid of that.\u201d Doc whistled gravely. \u201cYou know, you can\u2019t be too careful with this tech. Manufacturers think that, because the implants are for nonhuman use, they can get around all the usual safety checks. And what\u2019s worse is that they\u2019re usually right. Don\u2019t get me wrong, some of the projections are adorable, but at what cost?\u201d\n Ms. Wilson\u2019s eyes welled up. As she shook her head, a few droplets added to the work of the zoomers: tiny bots styled after diving beetles, who helped with station filtration by clearing away detritus, like the sort cast off by Doc\u2019s four-legged, no-legged, two-clawed, and tentacled patients, prone to drifting about in low-G. The aim was always to catch as many of those stray hairs, husks, gobs of impressively smelly saliva, scabs, stitches, urine sprays, bits of fecal matter and upchuck, feathers, scales, skins, arboretum burrs, and dirt-clods before they slipped into station-wall crevices and circuitry where they had no right to be.\n \u201cCan you take them off? Can you fix her? Oh, my poor baby . . . \u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d said Doc, heavily, before making a show of trying to remember where the detachment tool had been stowed in the examination room\u2014as if its charge hadn\u2019t been checked mere seconds before Ms. Wilson\u2019s return.\n Jude in reception had The Look when he was asked to add a zero-cost placebo to Ms. Wilson\u2019s account, not long after Doc had finished the procedure to remove Zeddi\u2019s implants and restore her natural, nondiplomatic-nightmare of a brown-and-white complexion. Both knew the \u201crash\u201d would clear up on its own\u2014its binding agent a nontoxic adhesive that Jude used onstage after business hours\u2014but a week-long prescription for \u201cmama\u201d to administer twice-daily would hopefully make the lesson stick.\n \u201cI know, I know,\u201d Doc winked, while scratching behind the pricked ear of the clinic\u2019s gray-haired guardian, Skeeter. \u201cI should\u2019ve offered Ms. Wilson a spoonful, too.\u201d\n 2\n It wasn\u2019t that Jude disapproved, exactly, but the young man was still in a place of exasperated affront that trickery was necessary; that human beings continued to be so . . . so . . .\n \u201cHuman?\u201d Doc prompted, over dinner in staff commons around the Core.\n \u201cExactly.\u201d Jude jabbed with his fork for emphasis. \u201cIt\u2019s like, first contact happens\u2014yeah? And there\u2019s this great big hush over all the lands\u2014for like, a split-second, right? But then comes the media spin cycle. The hot take. The alien overlord meme. The latest fashion trends. It never ends. It\u2019s all just more fodder, more material, more excuses.\u201d\n \u201cYou were expecting, what, that we\u2019d all ascend into a higher realm, hovering in perpetually unified grace over the cosmic miracle of first contact with other advanced species?\u201d\n Jude\u2019s long purple bangs swung from side to side. \u201cUh, yeah? Kind of.\u201d\n Doc watched him fall to eating as if he had gone many days without a proper meal. Jude would have been about six when the Aleph Station project launched, a beacon of hope amid a hundred military uncertainties about all the new forms of life on the edges of human discovery. The perfect age for a kid to be thrilled by the promises of a coming utopia: a deep-space diplomatic paradise where alien species could meet and work together for the betterment of all. A haven and a respite, at bare minimum, from a range of tediously abiding injustices back on Earth, many of which Jude had worked hard to escape by training for deep-space life.\n Instead, at first, Aleph had brought the Hurv out of hiding\u2014or at least, their itinerate higher-tech bureaucrats: a group only interested in the younger species when safety regulations established eons ago were at risk of contravention by some careless newcomer who had failed to read \u201cthe signs\u201d posted in particle-probability patterns all throughout the vacuum of local space. Even worse, the Hurv\u2019s extensive regulations, once reviewed by human experts, proved disappointingly sensible: best-practices for energy production, waste disposal, trade-route plotting, information-sharing, materials maintenance, and disease-transfer risk-reduction that stood to benefit any species who complied as they ventured further out. There wasn\u2019t so much as a line in the whole bloody ordinance that Earthers could sincerely claim as oppressive or an undue burden, at least not in the long or even medium run among the stars.\n And yet, it was the way the Hurv had chosen to administer all their perfect little rules, after the first ship broke one in error: with all the irritation, that is, of one adult repulsed to learn that another doesn\u2019t already know how to wash their hands\u2014and then not only teaching them this basic skill by making a grand, severe, and highly public spectacle of the lesson, but also going over every other \u201cbasic\u201d skill they could think of in the same degrading manner, under the pretense that they could no longer trust the other adult to know these ones, either.\n Might as well have whacked humanity on the nose, Doc had thought at the time. At least it would have been over quicker.\n Instead, it had taken another ten years to get Aleph Station up to Hurvian code, before those ancient administrators would withdraw the interstellar equivalent of a \u201cNew Driver\u201d sticker from Earth and its colonies, so that diplomatic relations could begin anew between humanity and the rest of the sector\u2019s citizen-species. Was it any wonder, then, that some humans saw no problem getting their kicks in against the Hurv when they could?\n \u201cWell . . . \u201d Doc offered, when Jude had paused long enough between bites to take a proper breath. \u201cAt least there\u2019s still The Congress of Familiars to look forward to, right?\u201d\n Jude snorted, but also couldn\u2019t help but be somewhat amused and placated by Doc\u2019s reference to a children\u2019s classic that had become wildly popular after first contact, in which aliens arrived and immediately started quarreling with humanity, until animal companions on all sides got fed up with their respective \u201chigher\u201d species and wandered off to form their own, far more harmonious republic in the stars.\n Doc would never say as much aloud, but Jude was also the right age to have been someone who went into related fields\u2014veterinary studies, animal husbandry, animal rights activism, xenobiology, nonhuman animal ethnology\u2014because of the wonderful adventures of that movie\u2019s protagonist. The interspecies theater troupe that Jude ran in his spare time only completed the circle of art informing life informing art in the young man\u2019s journey.\n A wounded idealism, thought Doc. But definitely not gone.\n Jude set a reader by Doc\u2019s tray after they\u2019d both finished their meals\u2014or rather, after Jude had finished Doc\u2019s untouched second half, while Doc prolonged the last of a tea packet. Doc\u2019s waning appetite had long become accepted fact between them, as was Jude\u2019s insatiable need for fuel to match his youthful burning of the day\u2019s candle at both ends.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n \u201cNext intake manifest.\u201d\n Doc raised a brow. \u201cLook on your face says that something coming in will be trouble.\u201d\n \u201cNot quite.\u201d Jude tapped the reader, wiped his mouth, and velcroed a tab on his napkin to the tray before pushing off. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s not coming in that bothers me. Night, Doc.\u201d\n Doc nodded back, then skimmed through the manifest, pausing only to thank the server who drifted by for their trays. It took a while to catch on to Jude\u2019s concern: the answer wasn\u2019t in the medical resource list, or among nutritional supplements and seasonal accessories.\n \u201cSonuva\u2014\u201d\n Doc looked up when it clicked, but Jude had long since left for rehearsal, and in low-G Doc couldn\u2019t even let the reader drop with a spectacular clatter to the deck. A good long sigh and a ping to the station\u2019s captain, to see if she had time to meet, would have to be enough.\n 3\n Cap paced in mag-boots while reviewing the manifest. Doc had caught her in the middle of resistance training (never one to trust the booster shots to do their work alone), and a zoomer was air-skipping furiously after, to catch any perspiration wicking from bare skin as she moved. Cap preferred clean quarters and a cleaner office, so the closest she had to an animal or plant companion was a chunk of Martian rock on the corner of her desk (which she called \u201cSpot\u201d to drive the point home), and the zoomers she kept close by as often as possible, under the principle that an untidy mind begins with an untidy atmospheric perimeter. Doc and Cap were good friends despite both obvious moral defects on the latter\u2019s part.\n \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased that we have fewer Murrs coming through. If I recall, you tried to deny every last adoption request two years back.\u201d\n \u201cI did, and you overruled me on the lot. Despite how much of a burden they are on filtration systems, I might add.\u201d\n Cap hummed agreement, but with a grimace. \u201cYou pick your battles out here, Doc. A few new alien pets being adopted by humans wasn\u2019t it. In fact, all the eagerness among Earthers to keep Murrs of their own even helped in talks with the Usmics of the southern continent. They convinced their western and northern allies of the economic value of building more trade infrastructure on the back of that trend, instead of escalating their military presence along our species\u2019 borders. That\u2019s also how we got the Beam, even if they do still keep plenty of its secrets under lock and key.\u201d\n Doc let slide Cap\u2019s use of the word \u201cpets,\u201d for now: outmoded lingo, but not as easy to eliminate as contaminants from the station air.\n \u201cAnd anyway, even if the trade deal hadn\u2019t worked out,\u201d Cap added, \u201cif there are no new requests for Murr transfers, what\u2019s the problem? It\u2019s a trend that sorted itself out, right? I would think you\u2019d be pleased, not looking at me like there\u2019s a vivisectionist on the loose.\u201d\n Doc kissed teeth and glanced at the long, transparent observation wall in Cap\u2019s office, which overlooked a command deck filled with immaculately uniformed officers going about station-ops business. Their whole realm was an affectation of order and efficiency that humanity never tired of performing, even when it fell far short of the mark behind the scenes.\n \u201cI ever you tell you about my cousin Mel?\u201d\n \u201cMel? Yeah, I think so. Gym rat who shipped through here last year, on his way to some extreme endurance run on Severin Six?\u201d\n \u201cQualifier race. Didn\u2019t make it. Busted a knee in the high-G.\u201d\n Cap winced. \u201cLucky it wasn\u2019t more.\u201d\n \u201cAgreed. But he was still holed up awhile on the orbital transfer station, in recovery, and someone got the bright idea that he needed company to survive the slump, after going all that way out and ending up with nothing to show for it.\u201d\n \u201cThat is a bright idea, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n \u201cWell, okay, I guess it could\u2019ve been. But this \u2018someone\u2019 decided to gift him a kitten, because it was small, and because they figured cats didn\u2019t need much to do well. Not like a dog that needs to be walked everywhere, right?\u201d\n \u201cI see where this is going. Kitten was a nightmare, huh?\u201d\n \u201cKitten was a kitten. It\u2019s just that, when the novelty wears off, plenty realize they aren\u2019t up for the commitment. Major regret syndrome. Tons of gifted cats, dogs, rabbits, birds, and reptiles are still returned to shelters back on Earth. Or worse, abandoned to the streets.\u201d\n \u201cBut Mel wasn\u2019t back on Earth.\u201d\n \u201cNope. And just as he was getting fed up with the kitten, he also decided to rent a stasis-pod and wait out the rest of his recovery in transit.\u201d\n Cap tensed. \u201cHold up, Doc. Am I gonna like where this story ends?\u201d\n \u201cNot one bit. So, we\u2019ll just leave it there.\u201d\n Cap glanced again at the manifest, brows creasing as she pieced together the relevant diplomatic facts. \u201cBut . . . Murrs come from the Usmics, and the Usmics . . . Oh. Oh.\u201d\n Doc nodded. \u201cWhen Earth-Usm negotiations dominated in the stream, Murrs were as high-prestige as they are high-maintenance. Once the prestige goes away . . . \u201d\n \u201cBut so quickly? Just like that?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe something spurred it. Maybe not. Trend cycles are mysterious.\u201d\n \u201cEh, sometimes. But we\u2019re talking a high-profile interspecies alliance and a fairly recent and lucrative trade deal. Surely any humans with Murrs on board have to know how the Usmics feel about what other people do with species from their world?\u201d\n \u201cHumans \u2018surely\u2019 know a lot of things.\u201d Doc shrugged. \u201cBut we\u2019re even better at using all that supposed wisdom to rationalize our preexisting preferences.\u201d\n Cap pursed her lips, considering. \u201cHow many Murrs do we have on board? And how many do you think are at risk of abandonment or . . . ?\u201d\n Doc raised a hand against the unspoken. \u201cForty-six, across thirty-one residential units. But that\u2019s the trick, isn\u2019t it? If I start a public campaign against abandonment, or worse, I might be putting ideas into the heads of people who hadn\u2019t fully realized this was an option. Plus, what if an Usmic sees the campaign and assumes the worse is already happening to their sacred ones? Then we\u2019re running even faster into a public-relations nightmare. No, we\u2019ve got to be careful. There\u2019s still time. Just not much, if new demand\u2019s dropped to zero overnight.\u201d\n Cap shook her head. \u201cThis all strikes me as odd, Doc. Humans are fickle, sure, but we usually drop something shiny when something shinier comes along. So, what\u2019s come along?\u201d\n Doc nodded. \u201cWondering the same. Wondering, too, if knowing what changed will maybe offer us a solution. I\u2019m going to look into it, and keep you posted.\u201d\n \u201cDitto\u2014on the diplomat side, mainly, but I\u2019ll let you know if maintenance crews come across anything, too. You really think this could go nuclear?\u201d\n \u201cAnyone\u2019s guess. We\u2019ll just have to hope for the best. Or at least a good exit strategy.\u201d\n \u201cHa.\u201d Aleph\u2019s captain stopped up short in her pacing, causing the zoomer on her tail to zip frantically aside. \u201cNow there\u2019s that trademark optimism I was missing from you.\u201d\n \u201cVery funny.\u201d Doc moved to shake hands. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell my assistant. He already thinks I\u2019ve grown soft as it is.\u201d\n \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Cap answered with a matching, solid grip: an echo in it, for them both, of a tougher time in station service. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the day.\u201d\n Outside Cap\u2019s office, before heading back to med-sector, Doc paused to survey the long arc of Ring that this part of the command deck overlooked: an ever-changing half-klick of commercial zoning, leisure spaces, and visitor services, all rolling gently around the station\u2019s midsection to sustain a hefty point seven-G. \u201cUp,\u201d to anyone inside it, was a transparent ceiling peering straight into the Core: a squat, gray, low- to zero-G research, service, and utilities space where interspecies scientists, diplomats, and military collaborated in publicly funded facilities. Decades out from the physics classes necessary for space-vet accreditation, it still staggered Doc to imagine how, when walking along that rotating Ring, anyone would reasonably think they were being \u201cpulled\u201d to the deck by a \u201cDown\u201d force that did not exist.\n And yet, this business with the Murrs was another sort of centrifugal illusion: of that, Doc had no doubt. The \u201cpull\u201d of the problem felt real enough\u2014for Jude, for Doc, and now for Cap, too\u2014but all the humans paying attention were still in the wrong frame of reference to make out any of the real powers behind it.\n For now, at least. For now.\n Doc\u2019s wrist-wear pinged an emergency in the docks: another \u201cpull,\u201d but this time more urgent, and clear. Tapping an icon for \u201con-my-way,\u201d Doc pushed off for the docks. Some days, one simply had to hope that constant forward momentum would be enough to counter the whole mess of forces\u2014real, and imaginary\u2014ever thrown a given body\u2019s way.\n 4\n Frightened whinnying could be heard all down the corridor between Holding Green to Loading 3, and Doc\u2014go bag slung over a shoulder, moving hand over hand along service-route guide rails, picking up more speed than was generally advisable\u2014hastened to arrive before the disaster deepened. Klaxons had been switched off to reduce panic, but emergency lights still pulsed in the dark, and when Doc emerged into the sweeping round of the station\u2019s largest loading zone, first impressions were almost incomprehensible: lightning-livid red flashes tracing the sinuous twist of powerful musculature pumping uselessly in zero-G; similar warning glows flickering wildly in the wide, glossy-black eyes of four horses floating helplessly in a realm of neither \u201cUp\u201d nor \u201cDown.\u201d Nor were they alone in that tumultuous bow-side nether-space: intact crates, scattered riding gear, and stall-partition materials tumbled at varying speeds all around them, knocking into the walls as much as into each other, before spinning out along freshly erratic trajectories. The team\u2019s handler, who had been knocked unconscious in the initial power-surge that had deactivated the pallet lock and sent everyone flying, also drifted in and out of range of those sixteen frantically kicking hooves.\n \u201cHey! Doc!\u201d Loading 3\u2019s foreman called from the other service entrance. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to crank it to point three-G if you want! Get \u2019em landed, calm \u2019em down\u2014sound good?\u201d\n Doc needed a beat to recognize the man across the dim and red-washed lighting: Luis Rodriguez, one of the station\u2019s \u201cgentle giants,\u201d and the proud owner of a tarantula he called Fea, \u201cUgly,\u201d with the greatest of affection. Good: not the sort to panic. But Doc\u2019s own heart rate quickened while surveying what \u201cDown\u201d conditions would look like in Loading 3: a narrow, rounded laneway with little room for four horses to work out their understandably ongoing agitation after touch down. There was a good chance that they would run into one another while adjusting to the strange fractional gravity, or trip into bulkheads and fallen crates and luggage, then either break their legs or trample their handler in the process\u2014or both.\n \u201cNegative. We have to sedate and take our chances. But not with all this junk. Do you have anything you can use to clear some of the boxes\u2014Oh! And of course . . . the handler?\u201d\n A thumbs-up in answer: \u201cMag-hook\u2019s on the way! My people are getting supplies.\u201d\n Sure enough, two of Rodriguez\u2019s workers soon emerged from the far passageway: one with a makeshift snare pole from the emergency panel between Loadings 2 and 3; the other holding a drone equipped with a large magnetic claw. While the pair enacted catch-and-secure protocols with everything around the horses, the foreman doubled back for a spine board, and Doc mag-locked on the opposite landing to load the dart gun. The clinic\u2019s standard ketamine-xylazine cocktail usually had a longer induction time in zero-G, due to decreased cardiac output and a general propensity for blood to linger in the limbs, but with any luck, all that frantic galloping in one spot would offset this delay and bring the four to rest before they could do further damage to themselves and each other.\n Emphasis on \u201cfurther,\u201d thought Doc, while studying the team\u2019s movements after three clean hits to the shoulders and one suboptimal dart to a flank. Colic was highly probable for all of them after such a nauseating trauma, the likes of which none of their species could be expected to understand in full, but the most severe variant, colic from shifted bowels, was an especially key consideration as they bucked and twisted about in zero-G. As for the handler . . .\n Well, on the plus side, long before all four horses had conked out, Rodriguez\u2019s team had the handler cleared from the danger zone, her surface wounds treated, and head and torso carefully secured for immediate transport to citizen-care. Doc couldn\u2019t remember her name, but also couldn\u2019t forget the kindness and expertise with which she had tended to the male colt and three mares after docking, when Doc had come by to oversee their initial revival. Doc had more than mixed feelings about the industry this woman served\u2014shipping show-ponies and racehorses to affluent settlers on far-flung colonies, or for direct trade with alien species that also loved to gamble with other animals\u2019 lives\u2014but it was hard to see any better justice in the death of someone who had at least tried to keep these creatures as healthy and happy as possible on route to their terrifying new forever-homes.\n Besides, as the long lashes of the first two horses at last started to flutter shut in the emergency lighting, and as their legs pumped less furiously from side to side of Loading 3, Doc felt a twinge of new fear growing for the whole team. If the handler didn\u2019t wake up, or if the horses\u2019 impending bouts of colic didn\u2019t respond easily to treatment, would their owners even pay to send another handler to finish the journey? And for all the upkeep in the interim?\n Doc didn\u2019t mind taking a hit on clinic expenses\u2014there were always ways to finesse station donors for cases like these\u2014but the possibility of the legal owners sending along other instructions entirely gave Doc a pretty colicky feeling, too.\n On the strength of that weakening gut, Doc pinged Jude to clear the rest of the day\u2019s schedule, just in case everything would depend on the first few hours going well.\n \u201cSure thing,\u201d said Jude, after a minute. \u201cThere\u2019s only one meeting I can\u2019t cancel.\u201d\n And when he flashed Doc a file bearing an Usmic name, Doc agreed.\n \u201cRight, of course. I guess I\u2019ll take care of it between surgeries, if it comes to that.\u201d\n \u201cSurgeries plural? That bad?\u201d\n Doc hesitated. The last of the horses was falling slack now, and with the handler off to citizen-care, Rodriguez and his crew stood at the ready to prep this lot for transfer, too. Doc couldn\u2019t tell which had been more unnerving\u2014to see the four pumping and whinnying at full intensity, or this spectacle of slumped silhouettes, drifting together in the flickering dark.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Doc, eventually. Even on Earth, their species often proved as delicate as it was powerful\u2014but one could doubtless say the same about them all.\n 5\n As soon as the horses were secured in-lab and prepped for diagnostic tests that Jude could run on his own, Doc left for the arboretum, tossing Jude a salute at the door that the young man did not seem to notice, bent to his heavy workload so he could still get out in time. Doc tried not to let the lack of response dampen an already fraught mood, but it wasn\u2019t easy. The day had been long and stressful, citizen-care still had no word on the handler\u2019s condition, and this was a poor time of day to be meeting with anyone in the station\u2019s nature preserve on the Ring, because most residents took their companions for walks at this hour among the foliage\u2014and not all of those companions played well with each other when they met.\n Some might even say that the Usmic was tempting fate, or itching for a fight, by bringing their Murr to the arboretum at this hour every day, but Doc was inclined to chalk up the choice more to guileless overconfidence on the part of this single, immense nerve cell that towered\u2014or rather, wobbled\u2014more than half a meter over the humans on board, and had such a substantial deep-space fleet to back its every movement through the sector.\n \u201cIf we truly have the respect of your peoples,\u201d Esmin of Usm had told Doc once, \u201cthen there will be no trouble for our sacred ones among your own, yes?\u201d\n Usmics communicated through fluctuations along their outer, mustard-yellow sponginess. Those who had spent even a little time on Aleph Station proved particularly capable at replicating humanity\u2019s text-based languages, so that Chinese, Hindi, Russian, Arabic, Braille, and Roman lettering rose and receded like a palimpsest of ticker tape across whatever section was facing their conversational partner at the time. The one downside to this feat was that Doc\u2014and Cap, and even diplomats expressly trained for Earth-Usm relations\u2014often had a devil of a time getting a lock on any given Usmic\u2019s intended tone.\n Still, context suggested that Esmin had been quite serious that day with Doc, because in follow-up questions it became clear that the Usmic could not fathom why any of humanity\u2019s own \u201csacred ones,\u201d however well- or poorly trained they had been as pups, might sometimes be out of alignment with the wishes and \u201cintentional energies\u201d of their caregivers. So long as the human guardians were righteous in their thoughts, surely none of their furry friends would dare to urinate on a Murr, or mistake it for something to be collected in a game of fetch?\n Murr, after all, were commonly described back on Earth as \u201csentient hemp,\u201d with their Usmic name coming from the sound that their fast-growing branches made during the part of their life cycle that humans most enjoyed. A Murr in its earliest phases was endlessly malleable and eager to please and could be coaxed into growing into the most striking patterns that would then be set for life. For southern-continent Usmics, the act of cultivating a Murr into its healthiest possible formation was a great honor and responsibility\u2014and the stigma for failure, too great to be discussed. For humans, though . . . Suffice it to say, the novelty of such a species had spurred innovation in different, often difficult directions, not least of which included the concocting of wild excuses, if ever an Usmic chanced upon an older Murr in human care and asked why it looked so unlike those raised according to southern-Usm traditions.\n Fortunately, so far the Usmics had accepted every half-assed explanation given.\n But how could a prematurely dead or abandoned \u201csacred one\u201d be explained away, if an Usmic diplomat asked for a report on how its kindred species was doing in human hands?\n \u201cThank you for your time, Esmin. And, ah\u2014?\u201d\n Esmin\u2019s spongy mass displayed a southern-continent Usmic icon, two overlapping circles with a dot over and below the intersection, for the name of the young Murr that stirred contentedly on the grass beside them. This \u201csacred one\u201d had a rustling crown of bright-leafed branches set around a sturdy, soil-brown trunk, and a hefty seat of prehensile roots that it used to move, to feed, and at this moment to flick insects trying to climb its bark. Esmin flashed the English version next: \u201cBarin,\u201d a popular Usmic word for near-but-not-quite dualities, with spiritual allusions that many human vendors translated poorly on Earthside alien merchandise.\n \u201cBarin,\u201d said Doc, crouching to nuzzle a root in greeting. \u201cBarin\u2019s looking healthy.\u201d\n Esmin\u2019s yellowness deepened with pride. \u201cFresh foliage this cycle. Gleaming well.\u201d\n \u201cApparently. That\u2019s what I was hoping to discuss with you, actually. Thank you so much for taking the time between trade meetings. I just feel like I don\u2019t have enough information on file to tend to these fellows correctly if they sicken here, now that so many humans have taken an interest in their care.\u201d\n \u201cS I C K E N ?\u201d\n The word stretched across Esmin\u2019s surface with a wide kerning between letters that the xeno-linguists claimed suggested an Usmic\u2019s incredulity.\n \u201cWell,\u201d said Doc, hastily. \u201cI mean\u2014if there are some cycles with fresh foliage, then there must be some cycles with, you know, un-fresh foliage, am I right?\u201d\n Esmin considered.\n \u201cSacred ones sicken with the unrighteous. Are the humans now . . . unrighteous?\u201d\n Oh boy.\n With a baleful look at the now happily \u201cmurring\u201d Murr, half its roots thumping gently on the grass, and then back at Esmin, a quivering immensity it was easy to imagine rolling right over a human in a fit of ire, Doc tried to remember that this Usmic was no different than any other overprotective fur-, fin-, feather-, or scale-parent who sometimes answered even basic questions about their \u201cbabies\u201d aggro-defensively from the other side of the examination table.\n This was just a \u201cbranch\u201d-parent whose appeasement came with a lot more on the line.\n Doc smiled broadly in reply\u2014and wondered, in the process, how well most Usmics could read tone from human speech. \u201cApologies, Esmin. I misspoke. What I meant is, how do you do it? What\u2019s your secret? Barin\u2019s foliage is quite spectacular, possibly the best I\u2019ve seen on the station, so I knew I had to come to you. Is it diet, exercise, a special grooming regimen?\u201d\n Esmin\u2019s yellowness positively glowed. That radiance didn\u2019t make it easy to read the rapid-fire text then pulsing along the Usmic\u2019s surface in answer to this flattery, but Doc knew better than to complain. A win was a win was a win\u2014even if Doc would have to spend a whole lot more time reverse-engineering what could go wrong for the Murrs, from Esmin\u2019s elaborate descriptions of how to make sure that everything, instead, went absolutely right.\n But after Esmin and Barin had rolled and rustled on to find their evening sustenance, Doc felt no great compulsion to leap immediately into that work, or even to return to the lab right away, and so the exhausted vet lingered on a nearby bench in the artificial glint of late-afternoon Sol-toned light. \u201cPeople watching,\u201d ostensibly\u2014and also, to keep a finger on the pulse of things, waiting to see if even a single other Murr would show up in the human throng.\n The only other citizen-species in attendance was Hurvian: a pair of the tall reptiles conversing in hushed tones, their iridescent-green hoods peeking out from behind a line of fruit trees. The rest of the visitors were Terran by origin or ancestry: human couples, solos, families with children. Rare was the human without at least one nonhuman companion; rarer still was the one among them whom Doc didn\u2019t know to have something in a terrarium or aquarium back home, or a cat simply disinclined to partake in the public fray. There, to the left, were the nine-year-old twins with Iggy, their contentedly leashed iguana; in the distance, Mort the crow kept the chief composter company (not that he needed it, with his whole menagerie of rescues from the station\u2019s variously departed); and dead-center in the path, Ms. Wilson and Zeddi were interacting with two dozen other humans attending to dogs all their own.\n It was hard to imagine, surveying this adoring crowd, that anyone would abandon a dear companion, or else neglect it to the point where death would become an act of mercy. But for all the species\u2019 grand declarations about other animals\u2019 \u201clove unflinching,\u201d as a dusty, old Earth poet had once put it, Doc had seen too much of humanity\u2019s fickle share of the same. Cousin Mel still thought himself a good person, after all\u2014a person who had simply made the only reasonable choice he could in the depths of outer space\u2014and for that matter, the clinic had sent its fair share of edge cases into that \u201cbetter rest\u201d as well.\n Doc waited until the arboretum dimmed to resemble twilight, and most of the evening circus had moved on. The latecomer appeared just as Doc was making to stand, but he entered with a full-grown Murr in tow, toddling on ever-sensing roots across the pungent grasses.\n Doc froze as it came closer, under lamplights winking on one by one in the dark.\n Oh, thought Doc. Oh, no.\n 6\n Jude shot Doc a puzzled frown upon the latter\u2019s eventual, all-too-quiet return. Even wizened old Skeeter, half-drowsing on the reception desk, looked up with concern when Doc forgot to issue the standard, salutary scratch on his rump while coming past.\n \u201cHey, Doc, your face is as long as our patients\u2019. What\u2019s up? Binky\u2019s memorial service isn\u2019t until tomorrow, you know.\u201d\n \u201cHm? Oh. Right, no\u2014no, this isn\u2019t about that. Although, the security report, did it . . . ?\u201d\n The young man shook his head. \u201cMx. Meru\u2019s been cleared of negligence charges, at least by legal reckoning of these things. Records shows that Binky blocked the air vent himself, by accident with his blanket, and well, it\u2019s not like you can explain to a dog that the CO2 will just pool around it while it sleeps, you know? Even in the clear, though, Mx. Meru\u2019s still beside themself that they let the new boyfriend kick Binky out of the bedroom in the first place. They\u2019d been planning to move out of zero-G months ago, but the price point, you know?\u201d\n Doc knew, and sighed. Accidents happened, and there was no point throwing more recrimination into the mix. Mx. Meru would probably never forgive themself, on some level, for their eight-year-old companion\u2019s death\u2014and hopefully, to the benefit of heightened vigilance with whatever critter they adopted next. All the vet\u2019s office could do was provide Binky with a loving send-off . . . and reissue advisory warnings, station-wide, about keeping the air well-circulated in any enclosed zero-G space where living beings slept.\n \u201cAnd the horses?\u201d\n \u201cGood news there, Doc. Only one\u2019s all twisted up. Prepping him for surgery now. I gave the other three the nano-cocktail\u2014which should also report back to us soon how severely their biomes have been disrupted. Or not at all, ideally. But I figured I\u2019d hold off on the fourth until post-op, so we don\u2019t mess up its baselines during surgical intervention.\u201d\n \u201cThe right call. I\u2019ll scrub up, then, and\u2014thanks, Jude.\u201d\n Jude squinted through his bangs. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d\n Doc considered lying, and then considered that Jude was too smart to fall for it. An actor knew acting when they saw it, didn\u2019t they?\n \u201cNot really, no. Saw something troubling at the arboretum, but it\u2019ll have to wait. Oh, and can you schedule Esmin and Barin for a checkup next week? And call the Cap: see if she has time for a debrief tomorrow morning?\u201d\n \u201cWill do. Hey\u2014and boss? No worries, eh? We\u2019ve got this.\u201d\n Doc nodded, and clapped Jude on the shoulder, but even while scrubbing in to help the colt lying in wait, the image of that second Murr in the arboretum was hard to shake\u2014and with it, the fear that the station\u2019s veterinary clinic really didn\u2019t have a handle on this at all.\n It had been years since Doc last performed surgery on a patient of this size, but the exploratory part had already been dealt with through 3D-imaging, which had identified the problem as part of the intestine folding inward, and not any of the more vicious bowel torsions with higher mortality rates. Plus, there was a holo-guide to illustrate optimal maneuvers while manipulating the colt\u2019s insides\u2014or rather, a standardized surgical manual with high-level AI processing, into which Jude had fed specific information about this one horse\u2019s anatomy and biochemistry, so that the system could note any critical variabilities in, say, its vascular systems or connective tissues, and offer work-arounds on the go. All of this made the operation fairly simple, all things considered\u2014and especially compared to the horror stories that Doc\u2019s teachers had once waxed on about, from the early days of deep-space medical care. The blood-pooling in zero-G alone back then . . . But no: now, the only real danger was irritation from the fact of surgery itself, which could lead to a sticky and inflamed outer-intestinal surface susceptible to post-op infection. There, too, though, the subsequent nano-cocktail would hopefully identify any dangerous bacterial formations in time for successful intervention.\n If anything, then, Doc\u2019s own innards became the stuff of greater contemplation, while the seasoned station vet gently freed the colt\u2019s tract from itself. Both Jude and Doc\u2019s doctor had noticed Doc\u2019s deteriorating appetite in recent months, and everyone knew that digestive uptake and gastric motility were already negatively impacted in low- to zero-G\u2014but so what? Some days the fight to keep anything alive in these vast and distant tin-can universes verged on absurdity. A case of the \u201chollows,\u201d some called it\u2014and one of the few ailments that other Terran species didn\u2019t seem to share with humans in deep space. Lucky sods. But if the body was tired, Doc reasoned, let it be tired. Let it diffuse itself until it was as empty as the vacuum between star-stuff. Let Jude\u2019s generation, and the next, try to keep meaning intact for them all.\n With a monitoring system on the lookout for trapped fluids, surgery was made even easier by the low-G environment, which gave Doc plenty of leisure to part and manipulate key components before tucking everything back inside and closing up. In a few years, there would probably be a nano-fix for this sort of colic, too\u2014or maybe gene therapy that could build a better upper-body wall and sturdier intestinal structures in the first place. The latter depended, though, on whether any of this would serve the owners; if these horses had a better chance of avoiding intestinal and colonic impaction, but only at cost to their agility in sport . . .\n The image of the second Murr in the arboretum came to mind again: an image that Doc was still trying to process before putting it into words for the rest. For now, at least, its sheer existence seemed proof-positive that, with humans, it was always a matter of when, not if, they intervened; and almost always for self-interest. Even when selecting which other species they wanted to protect from human harm, the choice to care about one animal-outcome over countless others was itself a form of violence\u2014however inevitable such violence might be, whenever dealing with individual consciousnesses struggling to do the best that they could.\n \u201cDoc? Doc? You okay in there?\u201d\n Doc heard Jude vaguely through the comms and blinked to attention in time to watch the auto-suture tool finish its work upon the operating table, and another station arm clean around the wound, and four station zoomers skip about to clear the air. Doc came up alongside the colt and swept its mane aside to study the long line of its neck. Blood pumped steadily, if slowly, through prominent veins under the skin of the massive three year old.\n They were all so bloody young, though, weren\u2019t they? Even the Hurv, with its initial temper tantrum over humanity\u2019s failure to follow ancient rules, had revealed in that instant the frailty of individual life spans even when fortified by immense stores of collective wisdom. Not one among them was old enough to be immune to making basic interspecies mistakes.\n \u201cFine, Jude. We\u2019re good here\u2014you can call it a night.\u201d\n Not that the young man would, of course, with dress rehearsal coming soon. But far be it from Doc to keep the animal in any of them from running its most instinctive course.\n 7\n \u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d said Cap, when Doc had her and Jude together for a debrief the next morning. Jude looked a touch haggard from theater work but kept his attention as much on the projection between them as possible. \u201cA cartoon? Ad mascot?\u201d\n \u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Doc. \u201cThat\u2019s a Murr.\u201d\n Cap shot the station vet an even more bewildered look. \u201cMurrs don\u2019t have faces.\u201d\n \u201cNot traditionally, no.\u201d Doc drifted into an open seat. \u201cBut then, dogs didn\u2019t start out with all the features we find adorable, either. We bred them in certain ways, and it was in their interest to hang around long enough to be bred\u2014at least, originally, before some breeding caused enough maladaptive traits that they needed our ongoing help to survive. Murrs aren\u2019t much different, minus all the weaknesses bred in for looks and purity; they were also originally cultivated for the features that Usmics find most appealing in small animal companions. All those tendrils of root and branch give the impression of the Usmic spores, a life-stage they\u2019re inclined to want to nurture to ensure maximum resilience when it\u2019s eventually scattered.\u201d\n \u201cExcept that Usmics never actually \u2018scatter\u2019 their Murrs,\u201d said Cap.\n \u201cNo more than we expect cats and dogs to grow up and leave us to build homes of their own,\u201d said Jude, clearing the grogginess out of his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s just, like, an offshoot of reproductive behaviors that\u2019ve served us\u2014and the Usmics\u2014pretty well, you know?\u201d\n \u201cBut not the Hurv?\u201d\n \u201cThe Hurv spend less time with their young,\u201d said Doc. \u201cThat probably has something to do with their lack of animal companions. They don\u2019t have the nurturers\u2019 instinct.\u201d\n Cap snorted. \u201cTell us something we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n Jude nodded along, then added: \u201cWell, except for their pack animals, which I hear they\u2019ve got plenty of back on their home world. But even then, like, it doesn\u2019t help with hard labor if your pack animal has all the features of a juvenile. And since they never needed to keep herds for protein and clothing, there wasn\u2019t any reason to domesticate an ally for the flocks, right? Even a cat\u2019s not much use if you\u2019re planning on eating all the house-pests yourself.\u201d\n Cap processed this with a long slurp of coffee, and a hard look at the projection. \u201cMeanwhile, an Usmic keeps its spore cluster close for years, if it wants to. Just like us with our kids. But then what happened here? Why would someone raise a Murr to look like that?\u201d\n Jude frowned, squinting at the projection. \u201cNah, they couldn\u2019t have. I\u2019ve seen different branch formations, but . . . look, the eyes, the tongue. That can\u2019t be natural\u2014can it?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d said Doc. \u201cThey weren\u2019t raised this way. Someone on the station has been gene-splicing, to make them more like Terran companions. And that\u2019s why there are no new requests coming in. Like you said, Cap\u2014something shinier came along. So, now there\u2019s a local underground for this subspecies. Humans prefer the familiar, after all: something they can bond with. And to hell with the consequences for the rest of us, when they do.\u201d\n Cap inhaled sharply. \u201cDo the Usmics know about this yet?\u201d\n \u201cNot as far as I can tell, and I get the feeling we\u2019d all be hearing from them if they did.\u201d\n \u201cTrue.\u201d Cap leaned back, considering. \u201cSo, what do we do? Deny them licensing?\u201d\n \u201cThat won\u2019t fix the issue with the existing ones,\u201d said Jude. \u201cThey\u2019re here now either way, and it might even drive up black market demand if we tried to ban them. You know how some people want things even more when they\u2019re not allowed them.\u201d\n \u201cThough for all we know,\u201d the captain countered, \u201cthe Usmics might consider these mutations an abomination worthy of destruction, even for all their talk of \u2018sacred ones.\u2019 And then, well . . . that\u2019s a solution, right? Just give them all back and let the Usmics sort it out?\u201d\n Doc and Jude\u2019s gazes met while glancing automatically at Cap\u2019s desk rock, \u201cSpot.\u201d People without companions sometimes said careless things about them without realizing it\u2014but also, if the matter ever did come to that, would Aleph Station even have the authority to give sanctuary to any sentient life-forms that the Usmics wanted killed? Would Earth authorities and local diplomats ever allow the clinic to shelter such a strange form of political stray?\n Jude coughed and turned to Doc to change the subject.\n \u201cYou said \u2018someone\u2019 is doing this\u2014but you know who, right?\u201d\n \u201cI do. Mateas Brimli, Core Bioengineer with a passion for histories of human-hybrid experimentation: the good, the bad, and especially the grotesque. But the name matters less than what we\u2019re going to do now, doesn\u2019t it? Because if it wasn\u2019t going to be him, it would\u2019ve been someone else, eventually, now that we\u2019ve got all these research partnerships with other citizen-species, including at least a dozen with less cultural sensitivity about the ethics of genetic modification. We apparently already have six of these new Murrs in Aleph Station, with more deliveries in progress, but, oh, Jude\u2014you should have seen the look on this guy\u2019s face, when I asked about it. He\u2019d been given strict instructions not to bring the Murr out until they\u2019d finished monitoring for serious defects, but, as you said . . . we know how people are.\u201d\n Jude squeezed the bridge of his nose, as if to tamp down the exhaustion.\n \u201cWould that we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n Doc nodded. \u201cAnd so, he thought he\u2019d been so clever, coming as late as he did to the park, long after the usual hour when Esmin famously drops by with a Murr of its own. It was supposed to be a subtle boast to those in the know; a way of establishing himself as an early adopter of a next-gen status symbol, so that he could later bask in the prestige of it all.\u201d\n \u201cJust the prestige, of course.\u201d Jude rolled his eyes. \u201cAnd never the responsibility.\u201d\n \u201cBut of course.\u201d\n Cap shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he told you anything, Doc.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s just it\u2014he and all the rest in the test-group are bursting with pride about their modded Murrs. Their overconfidence is staggering. They truly think that if they just roll out their new companions slowly enough no one will have any reason to be upset. The new Murrs will be so fully normalized before the Usmics catch on, that any attempt at raising hell will seem outdated before it even gets off the ground. \u2018Better to ask forgiveness\u2019 at its finest.\u201d\n \u201cAnd no one thinks that these modded creatures are . . . kind of ugly?\u201d Cap squinted at the projected, puppyish face grafted into the top half of the Murr. \u201cI kinda prefer the original, myself. They\u2019re like overactive bonsai, you know?\u201d\n Doc shrugged. \u201cNo accounting for taste\u2014although, I expect that there will also be a few grandstanding human purists who enjoy their Murrs as-is, too, and who might make things worse for the diplomats by raising the alarm early, trying to rouse the Usmics into an even greater fury when it all comes out. And less for the benefit of the Murrs, of course, so much as to ingratiate themselves into a superior moral position\u2014as if that moral position would mean a damned thing the moment Usm declared war on Earth and all its outposts.\u201d\n \u201cOh, yeah, that sounds about human.\u201d Cap started kneading her temples. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll talk to the diplomats, try to prepare them for any impending fallout, and we\u2019ll see what we can get out of Mateas, too, but . . . I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s too much to ask for an upside? Anything the negotiations team could spin as a positive, if it came to that? When it comes to that?\u201d\n Jude and Doc considered. Jude, in the end, took initiative:\n \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve been modded to . . . shed a lot less?\u201d\n A slow, wavering nod from Cap and then Doc said that this would just have to do.\n 8\n The handler was waiting in reception when Doc and Jude returned. Only a concussion-monitoring patch on one temple hinted at her brush with serious injury. Skeeter, from his tethered perch on the counter, was yowling at her in his usual, cantankerous way\u2014and not really in pain, or need, but choosing to share a litany of feline grievances with the \u201clucky\u201d clinic visitor all the same. Possibly this was the closest he could come to saying, \u201cSorry, all our staff are currently indisposed, but if you\u2019d like to wait, I\u2019ll let them know you\u2019ve arrived\u201d; and if that was the case, then Doc would definitely have to see about giving the old grouch a raise.\n For now, though, Doc smiled and shook hands with the arrival\u2014Yara Dagny, from the tag on her bag\u2014before waving her through.\n \u201cHow are you feeling, Ms. Dagny? I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re up and about again. The horses missed you, of that I\u2019m absolutely certain.\u201d\n \u201cYara\u2014please. And thank you. Internal bleeding in zero-G\u2019s no joke, but you\u2019ve got some excellent doctors here, and even better diagnostic equipment. They caught irregularities elsewhere in my system, too. Pretty sure I\u2019m leaving in even better health than when I arrived.\u201d\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear. And\u2014\u2018leaving\u2019? So, the flight\u2019s been rescheduled, everything\u2019s more or less ready to go?\u201d\n \u201cThat depends on my girls and their boy.\u201d Yara hesitated. \u201cAnd thank you, Doc, for taking such good care of them. I\u2019ve known transfer points that would never have leaped to preventative surgery without express authorization, even with something as serious as this.\u201d\n Doc cut a hand through the air between them. \u201cNonsense. We vets have a code, too.\u201d\n But Yara\u2019s answering smile\u2014more of a tight-lipped grimace\u2014as good as said agree to disagree. And, considering her industry\u2019s horror stories, probably for good reason.\n \u201cAnyway\u2014\u201d said Doc, \u201cYes, the mares are doing fine, their readings are all good, with minimal biomic disruption after all; and the colt should be ready to join them tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cGood,\u201d said Yara. \u201cYou have no idea how pleased their new owner will be. He\u2019s getting on in years\u2014one of the first to live on an extra-solar colony, half of which he owns, and after a lifetime\u2019s work getting the whole thing up and running, he\u2019s grown a bit senile: lost in nostalgia, always talking about the ranch from his childhood. Reconnecting him with the descendants of that childhood herd was the least his grandchildren could do, so they\u2019ve been keen to have the team arrive in time for his ninetieth Sol.\u201d\n Now, though, it was Doc\u2019s turn to plaster on a less-than-full-story smile. The grandkids could always have created a VR ranch\u2014excellent verisimilitude these days\u2014instead of shipping out four living, breathing Terran animals to a completely new environment, at great and confusing cost to their health along the way, just to appease one rich human\u2019s longing for yesteryear. But Doc knew better than to say as much. What good would it do them now?\n \u201cI\u2019m just glad that everyone got through the incident in one piece\u2014or, as you say, maybe even turned out all the better.\u201d\n The right answer, considering the circumstances: Yara\u2019s smile warmed, and the pair turned their attention to discharge forms, follow-up prescriptions, and the matter of payment. Once the clinic\u2019s account confirmed receipt of the indemnity funds, Doc also felt a whole lot wobblier about where Yara\u2019s complicity ended and the clinic\u2019s own began. But what else could have been done? Where in the galaxy were noncitizen-species safe from human whims?\n \u201cTime for that Congress of Familiars?\u201d Jude offered, once Yara had left to make final flight arrangements, and after catching the look on Doc\u2019s face while reviewing the transfer.\n \u201cCan\u2019t come fast enough,\u201d Doc agreed.\n Binky\u2019s send-off was a generous and well-attended affair in the arboretum. While the chief composter oversaw the internment of Binky\u2019s flash-frozen and pulverized remains into a soil mixture that would make it suitable for new plant-life in a month, humans who had been close to the sleek, sharp-eared, black-and-tan xolo-whippet mix took turns sharing a few endearing stories at the podium. The sudden, tragic loss of a \u201cgood boy\u201d on Aleph Station was enough of a to-do that many of the other fur-parents had shown up expressly to turn it into a celebration of life, with games and treats and video shoots involving the rest of the nonhumans, and a screening of the derivative but thematically \u201csafe\u201d The Congress of Familiars IX: Marlee\u2019s Bestest Interstellar Walk for the children.\n Mx. Meru\u2019s boyfriend was not in attendance\u2014possibly not even in the picture anymore\u2014but the grieving guardian still always had someone at their side, even if this meant spending most of the service patiently listening to and declining offers of fosters in need. With one persistently tedious petitioner, Mx. Meru seemed grateful when Doc intervened to inquire about the other guest\u2019s upcoming clinic appointments\u2014because, as Doc suggested when the browbeater then hit a hasty, flummoxed retreat, there really was nothing like a little reverse-pressure to thin a flock of scavengers, was there? Mx. Meru cracked a faint smile at this last, while Doc tried not to feel bad for having spoken ill of a whole class of essential animal. Buzzards in particular were creatures who had learned not just how to stomach but also to thrive on the hardest facts of existence, turning those facts into something that others could build beauty from again. How could Doc not admire any living beings capable of such a feat?\n Jude, meanwhile, had slipped at some point from distributing care tips and wellness kits for all sorts of noncitizen-species onboard, to promoting his upcoming show in the Core. This \u201cslip\u201d wasn\u2019t entirely his fault, though, gauche as that opportunism would have been. Plenty of attendees were simply as curious about production details surrounding Hello World Goodbye as they were about the best way to deck out a travel carrier for optimal comfort in zero-G, and the relative value of the latest newfangled latrine-mods when potty-training their cats. Every time Doc came past, then, the young man was fielding questions like how it felt to move through zero-G like a dolphin or gorilla, or explaining for the umpteenth time that the troupe wasn\u2019t offering discounts for nonhuman Terrans because the whole point of the show was to fundraise for the rehabilitation center whose patients\u2014the first nonhuman intelligences sent to interact with equivalent nondominant alien species\u2014had inspired the script in the first place. It was a wonder that Jude had the energy for it all. Doc felt exhausted, just listening in.\n Doc also considered saving Jude, too, from one particularly vexing attendee, the type blissfully unaware that he was trying to explain (badly) basic concepts about deep-space animal outcomes to a fully trained assistant vet; but then, Doc noticed a more pressing arrival at the edge of all these proceedings: the very subject of the morning\u2019s briefing with Cap and Jude. Mateas Brimli himself. It wasn\u2019t surprising that he would be here, really; the station\u2019s long-term complement was by no means infinite, and anyone with a vested interest in nonhuman animal companions tended to pay attention to related events. But Doc still found the gears turning: Confront him? Chat him up? Try to reason with him? But if so, to what end?\n No, there seemed little point to lecturing the barn-keeper once the horses had fled\u2014and quite a bit to risk, Doc reasoned, if Mateas were the sort to take even the mere existence of dissent as a reason to deepen his original convictions. And yet, even as Doc came to this conclusion, Mateas had decided the matter for them: setting eyes on the vet and advancing.\n Never a dull moment, thought Doc. With no small reluctance, the station vet handed off the fluffy, golden pup who had been enjoying a snooze and lazy head massage in the crook of an arm held well above the rest of the inquisitive pack\u2014and braced for bristlier contact with one of humanity\u2019s far wilder own.\n 9\n \u201cNature fetishism strikes again, am I right?\u201d said Mateas, the moment he and Doc had removed themselves from the rest of the boisterous throng, to walk in the dappled shade of the arboretum\u2019s fruit trees. \u201cAll these freaks thinking there\u2019s something so high and mighty about letting it all take its gradual course, and all of them right there with a boot to your head the moment you start to dream big without doing anyone any harm. Any harm at all!\u201d\n There, in this word salad of internal thought given messy outward form, was that \u201cpull\u201d again, that trick of a false force it was so easy to believe was guiding anything. But Doc knew better than to fall for any of these loaded and obscure references, all these baited lures embedded with intricate and ultimately meaningless red herrings in one isolated, agitated mind.\n \u201cI take it you\u2019ve heard from Captain Rui,\u201d said Doc slowly instead.\n \u201cYes, yes, Captain Rui, that prick Mika on the trade forum, my supervisor\u2014all of them! And for what? Captain Rui says your office flagged something on shipment manifests. Next thing I know everyone\u2019s telling me I\u2019m going to bring down civilization? Ha! I wish.\u201d\n Doc suppressed a flicker of annoyance that the clinic had been named directly in this. It wasn\u2019t ideal, but it also made sense that the command staff and diplomatic team would have tried to benefit from throwing around a bit of medical authority when asking Mateas . . . what, exactly? Or had they simply gone to him to vent over what his actions could cost them all?\n \u201cI can\u2019t speak to your conversation with the others,\u201d said Doc. \u201cBut I do know that it would help tremendously with damage control if we had some sense of how your test subjects are doing, so we can anticipate how the Usmics might respond once they find out that we\u2019ve been, well, as they put it, \u2018unrighteous\u2019 guardians of their \u2018sacred ones.\u2019\u201d\n Mateas laughed bitterly. \u201c\u2018Unrighteous!\u2019 Us? Unbelievable. So high and mighty.\u201d\n Doc halted in the shade of a citrus tree. \u201cMr. Brimli, we\u2019re not on opposite sides.\u201d\n \u201cNo? Sure as hell could\u2019ve fooled me.\u201d\n For a split-second then, Doc imagined a different career path, a critical moment back at the academy when someone had asked: Why study nonhuman animals? Why not other humans, when there are so many on the stations and deep-space colonies who need our care?\n It wasn\u2019t that humanity\u2019s companions didn\u2019t experience anxiety, depression, or a whole host of neurodegenerative diseases, too. But there was something in the way that a species with humanity\u2019s level of mytho-linguistic tradition meant that they could and did try to rationalizeits hurt, its selfishness, its anger, and its prejudice . . . It was how someone like Tina Wilson, generally a decent human being who contributed plenty to her communities, would have become defensive, even hostile, taking the whole matter far too personally, if Doc had simply tried to tell her that Zeddi\u2019s alien costuming was inappropriate and potentially destructive to ongoing diplomatic efforts; or how Cousin Mel would have told Doc to \u201cfuck right off\u201d if Doc had so much as pointed out that the kitten could have been placed in the stasis pod with him, then re-homed on return to Earth instead. Doc had a case of the \u201chollows,\u201d that was true, but this existential nuisance of a condition was just one of a whole, dizzying mess of behavioral complexes that the human-oriented physician had to grapple with, when simply trying to address a body of very real health concerns, and, well . . .\n Other animalities were often much easier, where all that chaos was concerned.\n \u201cI hear you,\u201d said Doc, after Mateas had taken a moment to exhale. \u201cHow are all the new Murrs doing, anyway? It\u2019s a really ambitious experiment, from what they tell me. You must be exhausted from all the work it would take to pull off something that incredible.\u201d\n \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d said Mateas, heavily. He ran a hand through his hair while eyeing the station vet, as if waiting for the inevitable sign or sound of judgmental disagreement\u2014but when it didn\u2019t come, when all Doc did was wait patiently for him to continue, the bioengineer at last relented, at least a touch. \u201cWell, okay, maybe a bit. But I swear, Doc, I did all my initial testing on micro-samples. I screened for all the major potential splicing issues long before I started in on full-scale test subjects. And even those ones, I put on ice the moment in their developmental cycle that something seemed to be going wrong. No suffering, right? And no death, no slaughtering of anyone\u2019s \u2018sacred ones.\u2019 They\u2019re all still there, waiting to be treated once the process is refined. I\u2019m not a fool, okay? I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n Doc nodded. Believing Mateas was not important here; calming the agitated animal in him was\u2014at least, long enough to gather the necessary intel. \u201cUnderstood. The only trouble is, we didn\u2019t know that, and how could we? We only just realized what was going on when the general population\u2019s habits started changing. And you know how thoughtless a crowd can be.\u201d\n Mateas grunted at this last and relaxed further. Shifting the blame to \u201cthe masses\u201d and their foolish beliefs was an easy bit of flattery to pull off. Who didn\u2019t want to think themselves above the madding crowd? Jude, Doc\u2014even Cap, for all her elaborate maintenance of her person and her living spaces: none of them quite escaped the allure of thinking themselves the \u201chighest\u201d intellects of all; and in this way, made themselves even more prone to fits of dangerous overconfidence in whatever belief or whim at any given moment struck their fancy.\n \u201cOne way or another,\u201d said Doc, as casually as possible, \u201cwe all knew this kind of work was bound to happen eventually. I mean, the way all our research was going with the outer species, am I right? And so, now we just need to figure out how to help with what you were already trying to do\u2014to roll out these new Murrs in the least harmful way possible. To anyone. To their human companions. To you. To the new Murrs themselves.\u201d\n \u201cNurrs,\u201d said Mateas, after a pause.\n \u201cHm?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re calling them \u2018Nurrs.\u2019 Part of the plan is to argue that they\u2019re not really Murrs anymore, so that it doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re supposed to. Usmics love their categories, right? So, we figure this has a decent shot of fixing everything without any fuss.\u201d\n Doc kept a straight face. That myth about the Usmics, often reinforced in mainstream media by caricatures of the southern-Usmics\u2019 elevated language of dualities, was pervasive even on Aleph Station. It wasn\u2019t surprising that this bioengineer would have thought it true, too: that the whole of the Usmic species, with its wide-ranging continental heritages and languages, could be reduced to a singular people fixated on surface-labels. But there was something heartening, at least, in the fact that Mateas had tried to weed out disasters and find fixes for the issue at all. This meant that, on some level, he did see a potential problem here, same as them.\n Now came the tricky part: trying to get the bioengineer\u2019s full participation and data set, so that together they could work out a better response to the coming storm.\n Give me an egg-bound cockatiel or shattered ant farm over this nonsense any day, thought Doc\u2014but for now, there was only this far messier and more delicate recovery work.\n As Binky\u2019s celebration of life was winding down, Jude caught up with Doc at Red Shaft, where a lift carried people to and from the Ring into the Core: gravity receding as they rose inward, even if other kinds of heaviness ever-lingered in the heart. Doc knew that Aleph Station looked different to Jude, on account of their respective eras on it. Where Doc still saw echoes of past military infrastructure, from the early, skittish days of even Earth\u2019s most optimistic pursuit of trade relations with far-flung worlds, Jude would only have known station features by their more recent functions: supply depots for free medicines, collaborative makerspaces, storage facilities, and stasis pods.\n Would Usmic response to the modified Murrs bring about those skittish days again? Could one spacefaring species really go to war over something as seemingly innocuous as the care and maintenance of their animal companions in alien hands?\n Well, but also . . . hadn\u2019t plenty of Earth\u2019s local wars been fought over far less?\n Jude whistled appreciatively in transit, as Doc relayed everything that Mateas had disclosed in their conversation\u2014the extent of preliminary trials, the state and location of all frozen missteps, the real number and locations of existing \u201cNurrs\u201d in station quarters, how many others were on their way, how follow-up tests were proceeding, and how many people had access to the protocols that the engineer had perfected to this point at all.\n \u201cDamn, boss, when you\u2019re good, you\u2019re good.\u201d\n Doc notched a brow in amusement. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m not good?\u201d\n Jude shrugged. \u201cWell, duh, Doc. Then we\u2019re screwed.\u201d\n \u201cHm. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n \u201cBut, so, what now? Like, Captain Rui and the diplomats went right for him after our meeting, yeah? And then he went looking for you right away and spilled everything, and still, the problem remains the same, right? This is going to bust open wide no matter what.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d Doc agreed. And yet, hearing Jude summarize the afternoon gave Doc a thought: Perhaps Cap hadn\u2019t name-dropped the clinic just to add a kernel of authority to her own. Perhaps she\u2019d scattered the bread crumb trail on purpose. After all, just as many humans sought out elusive or trending species for prestige, so too did many with highly active minds long to be acknowledged, eager to capture the acclaim, admiration, and envy of their peers. Had Cap and the diplomats possibly been banking on this bioengineer itching to explain his genius to whomever had the best credentials for understanding and celebrating his work?\n Doc couldn\u2019t help but smile slowly at the diversionary tactic. Usmic dualities were certainly infectious, weren\u2019t they? But binary thinking rarely got any of them anywhere.\n \u201cJude,\u201d said Doc, once the lift had settled at med-sector\u2014Doc\u2019s stop, but not the actor\u2019s, not on dress rehearsal day\u2014\u201cSave me a seat. I\u2019ve got one more errand to run.\u201d\n \u201cJust one?\u201d\n From anyone else, this would have seemed sarcastic, but Jude knew the vet life well.\n \u201cJust one,\u201d Doc agreed. \u201cAt least\u2014for now.\u201d\n 10\n Around the veterinary clinic were a host of other medical services, the majority for citizen-species but a few dedicated to mixed-use equipment and research labs. Human doctors, scientists, and technicians were joined here by professionals from a host of other species, including ones where medical care was less a profession and more a sacred calling. And so long as there were Hurv in talks on Aleph Station . . . there was aid for them here, too.\n Doc hesitated by the front entrance to their rather stark facility, which was divided into minimalist hot, cold, and wet sectors behind a straightforward reception booth where a single Hurv reposed, large eyes drooping beneath its iridescent green hood. The thought of a Hurvian version of Jude amused just long enough for Doc to strike up the courage to knock and then enter. Fear of starting a diplomatic incident? Perhaps. But perhaps also simple discomfort in the presence of something that had made humanity feel so small for so long.\n \u201cAh, hello. Is\u2014the doctor in?\u201d\n The Hurv eyed Doc slowly.\n \u201cYou require assistance? Information on the species you service?\u201d\n Doc was both relieved to be recognized as another professional, and inclined to laugh at the Hurv\u2019s assumption. But then, why else would a human come a-calling to such an old, indifferent species, if they weren\u2019t seeking some sort of wisdom from it?\n \u201cThank you, no\u2014not exactly. I wish to ask the plausibility of a favor.\u201d\n The Hurv\u2019s left eye rolled to the side for a moment, as if in thought, and then the Hurv leaned in and activated an intercom.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a noncitizen specialist to see you, Healer,\u201d said the receptionist in emphatic English. \u201cHuman.\u201d Then, in a Hurvian tongue, it added a few syllables that Doc could not so much as interpret as belonging to a single word or a full phrase. But Doc had some guesses: \u201cTrouble,\u201d maybe. Or \u201cIf you want, I can eat it or send it away.\u201d The Hurv did have strikingly long, lipless mouths with sharp teeth, and it was hard to look elsewhere, in their presence.\n In the ensuing pause, Doc had plenty of time to doubt the original plan entirely. Why hadn\u2019t the vet simply gone straight to Cap, or the diplomats, with all that Mateas had revealed, and that Doc suspected might actually help them now? Hubris, obviously. Hubris, and that pesky case of the \u201chollows,\u201d that yawning absence of meaning, aching to be filled.\n The Healer did not answer on the intercom, but rather emerged glistening from the wet zone, and blinking rapidly to adjust its sight as the fog cleared. It towered over humans, too.\n \u201cYes? Human? Yes?\u201d\n The Healer fixed an impatient eye on Doc: the hallmark of a bureaucratic species that intentionally faced others with its least welcoming side showing. Maybe back on the Hurvian home world things were different. Possibly there were enclaves or whole cultures of dissidents who for millennia had resisted the tedious practicality of their peoples\u2019 ancient ways, and advocated for free love and sang peacenik tunes in the shallows of their ancestral shores. But all the younger deep-space-faring species never got to see that side, if it existed. Never got to visit the Hurv\u2019s home world. All of them knew the Hurv, instead, solely as The Ones Who Will Take Away All Your Toys If You\u2019re Not Careful With How You Use Them.\n And yes, maybe that hadn\u2019t stopped individual humans from testing the extent of Hurvian patience, baiting the ancient species in passive-aggressive and self-righteous ways despite the decade-long, species-wide cost the last time someone had transgressed\u2014and even then, only in error! But . . . on the other hand . . . why would any ever expect a cautionary tale to work with perfect consistency? When had humanity ever claimed itself to be as universally righteous as, say, the Usmics of Usm\u2019s southern continent?\n Moment of truth, thought Doc, before stepping into the moral muck with all the rest.\n Mere hours on, Cap mag-locked beside Doc in the gallery overlooking the temporary theater-site, a zero-G expanse awash in faux underwater lighting, where Jude and the other \u201cdolphins\u201d were moving interpretively through their final test run: first, as a pod on Earth, in play and then mid-hunt; then, interacting with humans in a more confined setting, where they excelled at humanity\u2019s strange new tactile games; next, as a pod divided, contained, sedated, and above all else confused; from there, turning into the components of a spaceship, dreaming whole-pod dreams of hurtling together toward the distant stars; and lastly, with a single dolphin\u2014Jude\u2014lost, alone in the vastness of night, calling uselessly about before moving symbolically, sacrificially, toward the light of an alien sun, and . . . weakening, then winking out.\n \u201cGot your report on Mateas,\u201d said Cap, when the troupe broke for intermission. \u201cLots of good, actionable intel. We should be able to monitor everything with these new Murrs carefully from here on out. And the diplomats are figuring out how to break the news as gently and soon as possible, so the Usmics can\u2019t accuse us of trying to hide anything from them.\u201d\n \u201cGood, glad to help,\u201d said Doc\u2014not a little distantly, still studying the aquatic light patterns rippling silently across the stage.\n \u201cAlso, I got a call from the Hurvian ambassador . . . \u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d\n \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d\n Doc side-eyed the station\u2019s captain. \u201cSure you shouldn\u2019t have your zoomers with you, Cap, before you get your hands dirty asking a question like that?\u201d\n \u201cOh, but there isn\u2019t a zoomer big or strong enough to clean some of the shit we get into, is there, Doc?\u201d\n \u201cNow who\u2019s finally offering up their trademark optimism?\u201d\n Cap winked. \u201cIt was a good call, in any case. Very productive. The ambassador wanted me to know that, for the sake of station security and the prevention of further breakdowns in sector order, they\u2019ll widely disseminate an offer to take these new Murrs into their own protective custody, if the Usmics have a negative reaction upon hearing about their existence.\u201d\n \u201cWell, now. Isn\u2019t that awfully generous of them.\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t it, though.\u201d Cap eyed Doc suspiciously. \u201cAnd I suspect they\u2019re only offering this because they know that they won\u2019t actually have to deal with the new Murrs if it comes to that. The moment the southern-continent Usmics realize they have a choice between letting the humans keep them, or handing them over to a severe species that always gets its way, well . . . \u201d\n \u201cWhy, Cap,\u201d said Doc, pleasantly. \u201cWhy the long face? And here I thought you\u2019d be pleased to see a problem take care of itself.\u201d\n \u201cUh huh. And\u2014has it? Why would the Hurv help out? Are we really sure this\u2019ll work?\u201d\n Doc kissed teeth while watching the stage crew prepare for the dress rehearsal\u2019s second half. \u201cI ever tell you about my Aunt Luli?\u201d\n Cap shot Doc a withering look. \u201cAre all your relatives anecdotes now?\u201d\n \u201cAren\u2019t everyone\u2019s? Anyway, Aunt Luli\u2014she never wanted an animal companion, or even much in the way of other people around. Bristly exterior, all cactus needle without the flower. Or so we thought, until one time, when I was a kid\u2014a little kid, mind you, a real brat not minding my own business\u2014I pointed at her chest in front of everyone and shouted, \u2018it\u2019s moving!\u2019 Well, and so it was, because she\u2019d apparently rescued a baby squirrel, and that little rotter ended up going with her wherever she went. Except, as it later turned out, it wasn\u2019t exactly a clean rescue. Turned out, a neighbor had found the poor thing, but Aunt Luli hadn\u2019t liked the way the neighbor was managing things, so, she took it upon herself to do better. And even though she could go on for days about how much of a burden the critter was . . . \u201d\n \u201cMm hm. She loved it just the same, right? But\u2014the Hurv?\u201d\n Doc cut the air lazily with a hand. A sound sequence signaled that the second half would be starting soon. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to leave instructions for us in the fabric of space, and they didn\u2019t have to come running the moment we didn\u2019t read them. But they did, because that\u2019s the way their species shows care for its young: by leaving carefully curated guideposts and monitoring from afar. By stepping in only when necessary\u2014but being at the ready, always, to help whenever needed. So, maybe they don\u2019t have companions like we do\u2014but still . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re saying we\u2019re their pets?\u201d\n Doc made a mental note to correct Cap\u2019s term-use later. For now, the tired station vet simply hummed assent as the lights dimmed and Jude and the rest of the actors drifted into position. Tomorrow, before opening night, there would be a new hamster\u2019s lodgings to review, a litter of puppies to fix, an elder cat to assess for gene therapy, a full schedule of \u201cNurr\u201d checkups to arrange, and a ship to watch launch, if time allowed, with its team of horses headed frivolously for the distant stars. Were they missing anything? Always, in this line of work. Would Jude grind his teeth to dust over the coming trend cycles: all the petty, day-to-day provocations and predictable human grandstanding that stood to do great harm to citizen- and noncitizen-species alike? Probably.\n But so and ever-spun the wheel that also kept them grounded, with all its superficial force-effects driven by a problem much older and more central to them all.\n New ones would just have to wait for their own curtain call.\n Canadian by birth, M L Clark is now based in Colombia.

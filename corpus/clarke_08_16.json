Normally I don\u2019t make much of a fuss about my birthdays, but this year I\u2019m letting my family throw a party. It\u2019s not that I expect fifty to be any different than forty-nine, but it is a milestone year and since the heart attack, those milestones actually mean something to me. Little victories are important too.\nAs I mentioned in an editorial a few months ago, one of the presents I expected to have received by now was to be free of my day job so I could focus entirely on Clarkesworld and my other editing projects. Unfortunately, what appeared to be a solid job prospect for Lisa suddenly evaporated after some staff changes at that company. That set her back to square one and has left me in an increasingly frustrating position of being stuck where I am. I know she\u2019ll find something, but it appears the little losses mean a lot to me now too.\nI recently blogged about having impostor syndrome. It\u2019s that terrible little voice in your head that tells you that success was just luck, a fluke, and it will all evaporate when people figure out the truth. If you aren\u2019t careful, the little losses in life can be magnified by this beast. Far too many of us in this field seem to feel like impostors and I\u2019ve been at war with my personal monster for too long now. Lately though, I think I might be winning.\nI\u2019m a big advocate of magazines starting small and growing. In my eagerness to see the magazine expand, I\u2019ve allowed impostor syndrome to convince me that the value of my work was the enjoyment I received from it, so I took a smaller financial reward. Oddly enough, this is counter to the advice I give authors: make sure you get paid. I also told myself that reinvesting in the magazine would pay out in the long run. My vision demanded the magazine be \u201ccomplete\u201d before I could be justified drawing a proper wage.\nThere was a lot of theory in my madness. Fortunately, enough of it was correct and our revenue steadily increased over the years. Where I failed, however, was in identifying the relationship between readership and supporting readership. Over the last three years, our readership has increased, but the percentage of readers supporting us has steadily declined. This year, it dropped below seven percent for the first time. So much for little losses. That\u2019s a real problem.\nOptimally, I would like to be at ten percent. Think about that for a second\u2014one in ten people would be paying for our work. Insane, right? Yet, that\u2019s the business model most online magazines are working towards. Each of us have some ridiculously low percentage as a goal. It\u2019s no wonder that people have been trying to convince me to reconsider our approach to free content.\nI know the market is oversaturated and that\u2019s probably a contributing factor, but I\u2019ve been watching with interest as individual authors with similar social media footprints launch Patreon pages and related projects. I\u2019ve seen them rapidly shoot past what we make in a month while offering considerably less than we do in return. Clearly this is more of a passionate show of support for their work than it is about getting something. Sadly, you don\u2019t see this happening with magazines, so one has to ask, has the short fiction community lost its passion for magazines? And before you say anything, those \u201cwe\u2019re going to close if . . . \u201d Kickstarters tend to work only by deliberately manipulating their supporters. It is not quite the same. I don\u2019t see authors saying \u201cI\u2019ll never publish again unless . . . \u201d\nSo where\u2019s this newly-minted cranky fifty-year-old man headed with all this? I\u2019m not sure. I know we have to continue to grow the size of our audience, but this trend seems to indicate that it will only grow increasingly difficult to bring in supporting readers. We need to start thinking about what we can do about that ninety-three and change percent that don\u2019t support our efforts. I have no doubt that some of you are reading this, so I\u2019d love to hear from you and find out why you think things are the way they are.\nAnd hey, if anyone feels like giving me a fiftieth birthday present, subscribe at any of our vendors or make a pledge over at Patreon. Every step back towards seven percent\u2014or dare I dream ten percent?\u2014provides one of those positive little milestones I\u2019ve learned to appreciate. Maybe we can even do this before our tenth anniversary this October!\nP.S. I didn\u2019t want the six plus percent of you supporting us to think I\u2019d forgotten you. You\u2019re my favorite readers and listeners.

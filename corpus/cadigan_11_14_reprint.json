Or the TV remote,\u201d she added she sat up and looked around. Cody found it on the desk and tossed it to her. \u201cThanks. You know, carnies would call you a marked man.\u201d\n \u201cCarnies?\u201d He gave a short laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you threw over the bright lights of the midway to keep a low profile in budget accommodations.\u201d\n \u201cHigher-end budget accommodations.\u201d She put on the TV and began channel-surfing. \u201cFor the discerning yet financially savvy business traveler. Don\u2019t you ever read the brochures?\u201d\n He made a polite noise that was could have been yes or no and was neither. The hotspot that had come up over two hours ago was still there, midway between his chin and the point of his jaw, and as far as he could tell, it hadn\u2019t faded even a little. The medic had assured him there was nothing to worry about unless it started to spread and it hadn\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t have bothered him except he hadn\u2019t had a hotspot in years. Rookies got hotspots.\n The sudden recurrence could have been down to any number of things, the medic had said, the mostly likely being the attack of hayfever he had suffered on arrival. But he\u2019d never had hayfever in his life, he\u2019d told the medic. He\u2019d never been to Kansas City in late August, she\u2019d replied, chuckling.\n Technically, he still hadn\u2019t. The airport was thirty miles north of the city and the car they\u2019d sent had taken him to an industrial park about as far to the west on the Kansas side of the state line, which apparently ran right through the middle of town. The most he\u2019d seen of Kansas City proper was a distant cluster of skyscrapers, briefly glimpsed through the tinted window as the driver negotiated a complicated interchange of highway ramps. After that it was generic highway scenery all the way to a generic suburban industrial park, full of angular, antiseptic office buildings surrounded by patches of green landscaped and manicured in extremis, some with a koi pond or a fountain. The access road meandered through it so much that Cody thought there had to be an extra mile of travel. Albeit a very pretty mile; perhaps it was so people coming and going could see at least in passing the flowers they didn\u2019t have time to stop and smell. Cody could have done without it. By the time they\u2019d reached their destination, he had actually begun to feel carsick.\n \u201cYo!\u201d A pillow hit him in the head, making him jump. \u201cAnd I thought I was vain,\u201d LaDene laughed. \u201cAre you really that fascinating?\u201d\n \u201cI was woolgathering,\u201d he said as he threw the pillow back at her. \u201cThinking, in case you don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d\n \u201cI know what it means,\u201d she said. \u201cI also know you\u2019ve got a hotspot. Unclench, honey, I\u2019ve got one, too.\u201d She lifted her shirt and pointed at her navel.\n \u201cOh, very funny.\u201d\n \u201cOh, very for-real.\u201d She was up off the bed and had his face in her hands before he could say anything. \u201cAh, got it, right there.\u201d She patted his cheek and pulled up her shirt again, exposing her midriff. \u201cMine\u2019s hotter. Feel.\u201d\n Her bellybutton was only inches away from his nose. Cody drew back and started to protest as she grabbed his hand and pressed it against her skin. His discomfort turned to surprise. \u201cI sit corrected,\u201d he said, extricating himself from her grip. \u201cYours is hotter.\u201d\n \u201cTold you,\u201d she said, plumping down on the bed to stretch out again. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the ragweed and who knows what else in the air. Man, I hate KC this time of year.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m from here.\u201d She laughed at his surprised expression. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell?\u201d\n \u201cHow could I? We just met.\u201d\n \u201cI knew you weren\u2019t from around here, soon as I saw you. No antihistamines.\u201d\n He chuckled a bit ruefully. \u201cI thought I was dying of a head cold I caught on the plane.\u201d\n She started to channel-surf again, then changed her mind and shut the TV off. \u201cIf you get cold symptoms a lot when you fly, it\u2019s probably an allergy.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d He gave a short skeptical laugh. \u201cIs there a lot of ragweed on airplanes?\u201d\n She shrugged. \u201cLots of other stuff\u2014mold, dust, newsprint. Somebody\u2019s cheap cologne. Even expensive cologne.\u201d\n \u201cNewsprint?\u201d\n \u201cBelieve it or leave it. You know how if something exists, there\u2019s porn of it? Well, there\u2019s also someone allergic to it.\u201d\n \u201cNewsprint,\u201d Cody said again, still skeptical.\n \u201cIf I\u2019m lyin\u2019, I\u2019m dyin\u2019.\u201d LaDene raised one hand solemnly, then let it fall. \u201cOkay, that was fun. Now whaddaya wanna do?\u201d\n Cody leaned over and scooped the remote control up so he could turn the TV back on, mainly to forestall the possibility of her wanting to compare hotspots again. The screen lit up to show a dark-haired, olive-skinned woman speaking directly to the camera with an earnest sincerity that made his own brow furrow in sympathy.\n \u201c . . . found flayed and burned in a midtown Kansas City, Missouri parking garage have now positively been identified as August Fiore, AKA Little Augie Flowers, fifty-one, and Coral Oh, twenty-nine, of Liberty, Missouri. Fiore went missing two weeks ago from an FBI safe house where he was being held pending the start of the trial of Carmine Nesparini on racketeering charges. The FBI has steadfastly refused to comment on allegations that Fiore was Nesparini\u2019s personal \u2018master key\u2019 but sources close to the investigation say that Fiore\u2019s cooperation would have given authorities an unprecedented level of access to mob records.\n \u201cFiore\u2019s attorneys refused to comment, except to say that they were unaware of any escape plans and had no knowledge of Fiore\u2019s whereabouts. Whether Fiore left the safe house voluntarily may never be known. FBI technicians are still working on the sabotaged surveillance system but experts believe there is little chance they can salvage enough data to be useful.\n \u201cCoral Oh\u2019s connection to Fiore still has not been established. Oh worked for the Kansas City Convention Bureau for fifteen years as an event coordinator, for the last three in a supervisory position. Co-workers described her as intelligent and well liked. She was last seen ten days ago in her office by two of her subordinates, who had been working late with her.\u201d\n The woman was suddenly replaced by a video of a very young man who looked as if he hadn\u2019t slept for at least that long. The slightly wobbly graphic at the bottom of the screen said he was Akule Velasquez.\u201dShe told us to go home, she\u2019d finish up,\u201d he said in a husky voice to someone just off-camera to the left. \u201cWe\u2019d\u2019ve stayed but she was all\u2014\u201d he made small shooing gestures with both hands. \u201c\u2018No, get outa here, I\u2019ll finish, bring me some fancy coffee tomorrow.\u2019 She was like that. I tried to stay anyway but she kept telling me no. I wish I hadn\u2019t listened.\u201d\n The woman in the studio reappeared, looking more earnest and sincere than ever. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s office issued a statement saying that this unfortunate and tragic incident should not overshadow the fact that criminal activity in the area has been steadily declining for the past twelve months thanks to new policing initiatives\u2014\u201d\n LaDene snatched the remote out of his hand and turned off the TV. \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t fun. Now what do you wanna do?\u201d\n \u201cHey, I was watching that.\u201d Cody reached for the remote but she threw it across the room where it bounced off the wall and fell neatly into a small waste basket.\n \u201cShe shoots, she scores! A three-pointer, the crowd goes wild!\u201d LaDene made crowd noises as he stalked over to retrieve the control. The impact had knocked the batteries out and it took him two tries to put them back in properly. \u201cOh, come on. What do you wanna scare the shit out of yourself for?\u201d\n But the news had moved on; now a man was standing near the edge of an empty swimming pool, blinking in bright sunlight as he talked about levels of chlorine. \u201cOh, well.\u201d Cody dropped the remote on the bed and sat down on the chair by desk again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to scare myself.\u201d\n \u201cWho were you trying to scare\u2014me?\u201d\n \u201cNo. I just want to pay attention.\u201d\n \u201cSet a news alert on your phone.\u201d She was channel-surfing again. \u201cIt\u2019s probably all bullshit anyway. \u2018Little Augie Flowers,\u2019 for God\u2019s sake. Who goes around calling themselves \u2018Little Augie Flowers\u2019? For a minute there, I thought they were talking about some old Grand Theft Auto module. \u2018Gay Tony Meets Little Augie Flowers, bullets will fly, heads will roll!\u2019 Oh, hey, I love this!\u201d she added, sitting up suddenly.\n Cody barely had to look at the screen to know what it was. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it.\u201d He rested an elbow on the desk and cupped his face in his hand. The hotspot was still there. \u201cSeveral times.\u201d\n \u201cSo have I but I like to watch it whenever it\u2019s on. That guy\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n \u201cHe is?\u201d If he didn\u2019t leave the goddam hotspot alone, he told himself, it was never going to fade. He shifted so he was leaning the upper part of his cheek against his hand; as if it had a will of its own, his thumb slid down to feel his jawline. Annoyed with himself, he straightened up, grabbed the TV listings off the desk and paged through them without seeing anything.\n \u201cOkay, he\u2019s all wrong and he probably knew it,\u201d LaDene was saying. She punched the pillows behind her into a more supportive position for her lower back and casually folded her legs into a half-lotus, making Cody wince. \u201cBut so what? The whole movie\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s a pretty old movie,\u201d he said, shrugging.\n \u201cNot that old. Not ancient.\u201d\n \u201cNo, but BCI didn\u2019t even exist when this came out and people were still using floppy disks. This big.\u201d He held his hands three feet apart. She gave him a look and he moved them so they were only a foot apart. \u201cOkay, this big. TVs were dumb terminals and a cloud was a fluffy white thing in the sky. So the idea of people giving up memories to store data in their brains\u2014\u201d\n LaDene waved one hand dismissively. \u201cI was referring to the cell phones.\u201d\n He frowned. \u201cWhat cell phones?\u201d\n \u201cExactly!\u201d She laughed. \u201cHow the hell did they miss cell phones?\u201d\n As if on cue, there was a sound like a ray-gun in a scifi movie and the ring on her right hand lit up with tiny flashing lights. She cocked her head, listening, then bounced off the bed. \u201cMy ride\u2019s here. See you around\u2014\u201d Her grin was sheepish.\n \u201cCody,\u201d he said.\n \u201cRight.\u201d She paused, one eyebrow raised, the other down low, something Cody had never been able to manage no matter how hard he\u2019d tried. \u201cThat\u2019s really your name.\u201d\n \u201cLaDene\u2019s really yours?\u201d he said evenly.\n \u201cI grew up in Tonganoxie, Kansas. Of course it\u2019s really my name.\u201d\n The two statements seemed unrelated to him but he nodded anyway. She pulled her suitcase out of the closet, extended the handle and then paused again, one hand on the doorknob. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\n \u201cI used to know but I rented that out for a database back-up.\u201d\n He heard her laughing all the way down the hall.\n He ate alone in the dining room. The waitress gave him a table by a window that made the most of the hotel\u2019s location atop a rocky promontory, so he could enjoy his chicken Caesar salad with a scenic view of three other hotels and the six-lane highway running between them.\n While it may not have been classic postcard material, he had to admit the view was actually rather nice. Kansas wasn\u2019t as flat as most people seemed to think, at least not in this locale. Here the landscape was gently rolling, punctuated by flat stretches usually occupied by malls or apartment complexes. In the distance, he could see the top of a mall that had to be the size of an airplane hangar and, not far from that, a crane surrounded by a framework suggesting future apartments or condos.\n But it was the highway that drew his eye more than anything. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had seen so many private cars. Well, the travel agent had told him this was one of the last bastions of the autonomous commuter. Cody couldn\u2019t imagine what it was like to spend an hour or more of every weekday driving. He\u2019d had a license himself once, but only briefly. After it had expired, he hadn\u2019t bothered renewing it and didn\u2019t miss it.\n Perhaps if he were driving now, he\u2019d be too busy to keep worrying at that stupid hotspot. Annoyed with himself, he pulled the complimentary library up on the table-top and checked out the local newspaper.\n The waitress tried to talk him into dessert every time she refilled his iced tea. After his third glass, he swiped his keycard through the table-top reader, left an overly generous cash tip, and went back up to the room. It seemed a lot emptier now that LaDene was gone. Even the pillows she had piled against the headboard looked forlorn. He hadn\u2019t been thrilled to find her there when he\u2019d checked in. She had apologized profusely\u2014some kind of travel-plan fiasco. Having been through a few of those himself, he was sympathetic. As it turned out, she\u2019d been good company\u2014better than he\u2019d realized. His newly-recovered privacy felt lonely.\n He stretched out in the place where she had been and put the TV on again. It was only one night, and as LaDene had pointed out, this was a higher-end budget hotel. The complimentary coffee service was a drip pot with pouches of a gourmet blend rather than merely a kettle and two envelopes of instant. The minibar was well stocked with a wide variety of refreshments and if all of it cost ten times what it would in a grocery store, at least the cans of mixed nuts were a bit larger than average.\n And then there was the television. Twenty channels including sports and movies, not counting the on-demand you had to pay extra for. Most places didn\u2019t offer half that. Maybe it was their way of compensating people like him, who were stuck there without a car.\n Although that wasn\u2019t quite true. A chat with the desk clerk had revealed that they were less than a mile away from what she referred to as a shopping village, which he quickly figured out was a clever euphemism for strip mall. It wasn\u2019t much, she\u2019d said in a politely cautioning tone meant to discourage any ideas of a foray on foot\u2014a discount electronics outlet, a hardware store, an indoor playground, and three fast-food joints. Cody decided he could live without seeing it.\n \u201cGood choice,\u201d the clerk had said approvingly. \u201cBecause you\u2019d be taking your life in your hands\u2014no sidewalks.\u201d\n \u201cNo sidewalks where?\u201d he\u2019d asked, puzzled.\n \u201cBetween here and the shopping village.\u201d\n \u201cThen where do people walk?\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t. People have to drive to get out here. They park, do whatever they came to do, then drive home again. I mean, you don\u2019t walk on the interstate, either.\u201d\n Cody had been tempted to ask if she ever went for walks herself and if so, where, but decided against it. She was twenty-two at most, about to go from merely young and pretty to eye-catching as the last of her adolescent puppy-fat disappeared. She might have thought he was hitting on her and if he were honest, he might have had a hard time denying it.\n He found a 24-hour news channel, turned the volume down to a murmur, and then used the remote to shut off the lights.\n The next thing he knew, someone was sitting on his chest.\n He could see nothing in the dark except a darker shadow looming over him, blocking out the flickering light from the television. He tried to yell but his mouth refused to open and he only made a sort of high-pitched grunt. Something pressed hard against his windpipe as whoever had him pinned bent over to speak close to his ear.\n \u201cYou want to lie very still and not make a sound,\u201d said a male voice, just above a whisper. \u201cThen do exactly what I tell you. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I\u2019m not here to hurt you. But I will if I have to.\u201d\n His heart was beating hard and fast, as if it were trying to pound its way out of his chest. The pressure on his windpipe eased but didn\u2019t go away entirely. He swallowed, wincing.\n As the man straightened up, Cody made out long graying hair, possibly tied back, and thick-framed glasses. \u201cFirst, don\u2019t try to open your mouth. You\u2019re short-circuited and you\u2019ll only give yourself a headache. Once I know you\u2019re gonna behave yourself, I\u2019ll consider letting you chew gum.\u201d\n He tried to make a conciliatory noise; the pressure on his windpipe increased again.\n \u201cI said, don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d\n Cody sucked air through his nose, feeling himself jerk helplessly as his body fought to cough even though his mouth wouldn\u2019t open. His throat clenched, knotted, and tried to turn itself inside out. Then all at once, his mouth did open, just long enough for him to let out a few explosive coughs before his jaw snapped shut again.\n \u201cBetter?\u201d\n Cody nodded, breathing in hungrily through his nose.\n \u201cYou understand now to do exactly what I say?\u201d\n He nodded again.\n \u201cAfter I let you up, you\u2019re gonna change your clothes. Then you\u2019ll be taken out of here in a wheelchair. You\u2019re gonna sit quiet and stare at your lap. You\u2019re not gonna look up. If anyone speaks to you, you\u2019ll act like you didn\u2019t hear anything. There\u2019s a van waiting out front. You\u2019ll be put into it, chair and all, and we\u2019ll drive away.\n \u201cNow, it\u2019s important you remember everything I just said and do exactly that because an associate of mine is having a chat with the night clerk. Nice older man, a grandfather, in fact. If, while we pass through the lobby, he should get the idea that you need help, my associate will hurt him, badly. Unlike me, my associate doesn\u2019t mind hurting anyone. You don\u2019t want to harm innocent bystanders, do you.\u201d\n Cody shook his head from side to side.\n \u201cVery good. Now, when I let you up, you\u2019re going to strip naked and put on what I\u2019ve brought for you.\u201d\n The man climbed off him and stood back. Cody moved more slowly as he slid over to the edge of the bed and began to unbutton his shirt with shaky fingers.\n \u201cA little faster, please,\u201d the man said, staring at the television with his arms folded. Cody wanted to comply but he was so unsteady he was off-balance even sitting down. He shoved his trousers down, extricating his ankles one at a time, socks and all. Next to him was a small neat pile of clothing folded into squares. Trembling, he picked up the top item; it was a hospital gown.\n \u201cTies in back,\u201d the man said, casually matter of fact, as if he were remarking on the weather. He never looked away from the television.\n Cody couldn\u2019t have tied his shoelaces. He decided it didn\u2019t matter; the second item was a bathrobe. He put it on sitting down, then pushed himself carefully to his feet.\n The man turned from the television to give him an up-and-down. \u201cI told you to strip naked. Lose the tidy-whiteys.\u201d\n Cody fell over on the bed in the rush to gets his shorts off. The man waited with a put-upon air till he was done, then took hold of his upper arm and pulled him up. Cody winced; his grip was unnaturally strong, well out of proportion for a slight, older man almost a head shorter than he was.\n The man waiting in the hallway with the wheelchair was a lot taller and huskier, dressed in a dark blue coverall; there was a patch on his left breast pocket showing a picture of a first-aid kit and the words County EMS. He said nothing as Cody stumbled over the foot-rests and fell into the seat. The frame was lightweight and all the wheels were small. The gray-haired man bent over him and Cody saw he was wearing the same uniform.\n \u201cYou remember what I told you,\u201d he said and Cody noticed how little his rather pasty face moved, as if he\u2019d Botoxed it into submission. And out here, up close and personal in much brighter light, the gray hair looked like a wig, ponytail and all. \u201cThink of that poor man\u2019s family. Whether he goes home when his shift is over is all down to you.\u201d He stared into Cody\u2019s eyes as if he expected to see some response there, then chuckled and patted his cheek. \u201cAnd seriously, relax your jaw. I\u2019m not kidding about the headache.\u201d Cody started to rub the side of his face but the man caught his hand and put it firmly in his lap. \u201cYou don\u2019t move till we\u2019re out of here. Can you manage that or should I help you?\u201d\n Cody bowed his head.\n \u201cBy George, I think he\u2019s got it.\u201d\n Despite the carpeting, the ride was bumpy\u2014the chair had a wobbly wheel, like every supermarket shopping cart Cody had ever used. But he stared fixedly at the slightly threadbare material covering his knees as they went down in the elevator. When they reached the lobby, he bowed his head a little more and squeezed his eyes shut, afraid they\u2019d kill the desk clerk anyway. Having seen their faces, he\u2019d be able to give a description to the police, which didn\u2019t bode well for his survival.\n Or for his own.\n The thought was a cold electric shock running down his back as the automatic doors hummed open in front of him. He heard the desk clerk tell someone to have a good night and a woman responded I surely will, you too! in a cheerful, friendly tone.\n Then he was outside, rattling toward a white van with the same County EMS painted on the open side door. A tall woman waited beside a wheelchair lift.\n Cody had no idea how long they had been on the road before the gray-haired man reached over and touched something to a spot under his cheekbone near the hinge of his jaw. He was in the middle of a huge yawn almost before it registered on him that he could open his mouth again. The muscles on either side of his face felt overworked and sore, including some he had never actually known were there. He worked his jaw for a while, knowing the gray-haired man was watching him and trying not to care.\n He was sitting in a fold-down seat on Cody\u2019s right, facing backwards. The husky guy had anchored the wheelchair against a padded backstop and strapped him in before taking the seat on his left. The tall woman was up front, next to the driver. The woman who had been talking to the night clerk was behind him, along with at least one other person he had neither seen nor heard and who apparently wanted to keep it that way. Unbidden, the idea came to him that it was LaDene; he put it quickly out of his mind. Paranoia wasn\u2019t going to help.\n Cody rested his head against the backstop and closed his eyes, wondering if he actually could go to sleep. Under the circumstances, there wasn\u2019t anything else he could do. But his mind was as alert as if he were in the middle of a busy day, which he supposed he was. Pretending to be asleep was a waste of time, thanks to the hospital gown; he figured they\u2019d souped it up to where it could practically read his mood.\n He opened his eyes and saw the gray-haired man watching him. Almost reflexively, he was overwhelmed by another huge yawn.\n \u201cYou know the situation,\u201d the gray-haired man said, when his yawn had passed.\n Cody nodded. \u201cAnd you know I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d the man said.\n \u201cI\u2019m a courier,\u201d Cody added. \u201cEven if I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t access anything\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe know,\u201d the other man said, sounding short.\n \u201c\u2014I have no knowledge of the quantity or nature of any data\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYes, we\u2019re aware\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014nor am I responsible if any attempts at access cause damage, in whole or in part, to that data or any hardware or software\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe already know that\u2014\u201d He was openly impatient now.\n \u201c\u2014my safe return cannot not indemnify any party against criminal charges of kidnapping and false imprisonment,\u201d Cody went on, trying not to enjoy the man\u2019s irritation too much as he talked over him, \u201cwhich are brought by the state and not by companies or individuals.\u201d He said the last couple of words through another yawn. \u201cWhew. Excuse me. I\u2019m obligated by the terms of my employment to apprise you of those facts. I can also write it all down for you and sign it.\u201d\n The man on his left perked up. \u201cSeriously? Like, if you don\u2019t say all that, they\u2019d fire you?\u201d Cody nodded. The man thought it over for a second. \u201cWhat if we all claimed you didn\u2019t?\u201d\n \u201cShut up,\u201d the gray-haired man said, raising his voice.\n Cody pretended not to hear. \u201cI\u2019d tell them I did.\u201d\n \u201cAnd they\u2019d just believe you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m level-four bonded,\u201d Cody replied. \u201cOn the job, I\u2019m permanently under oath. If I lie, it\u2019s perjury.\u201d\n \u201cShut your face or I\u2019ll shut it for you,\u201d said the gray-haired man, triggering Cody\u2019s urge to yawn again. The man waited till he was done, then added: \u201cAnything else in the way of legal disclaimers? Health warnings? Household hints?\u201d\n Cody gave his head a quick shake and dropped his gaze to his lap. They traveled in silence for some unmeasured amount of time. Abruptly, the man on his left straightened up. \u201cI just can\u2019t get my head around anyone just taking this guy\u2019s word about anything,\u201d he blurted.\n \u201cWhen we get where we\u2019re going, you can look it up on Wikipedia,\u201d the gray-haired man said acidly. \u201cLast warning\u2014shut your mouth.\u201d\n Cody hardly dared to look up after that; whenever he did, the gray-haired man always seemed to be watching him. He stared into the darkness, listening to the thrum of the tires and air rushing past. No one said anything about a rest stop and he doubted there was any point in asking\u2014the gray-haired guy would probably offer him a Coke bottle. He shifted in the chair and concentrated on making himself relax. He had said what he had to say; his best course of action now was to avoid further antagonizing the gray-haired man.\n It was just starting to grow lighter outside when he finally dozed off.\n He woke from an unpleasant dream of many hands grabbing at him to find the big man unstrapping the chair while the gray-haired man poked his shoulder, telling him over and over to wake up. Exhaustion overwhelmed him, weighed him down so that just getting his eyes open was a major effort and when he finally did, they wouldn\u2019t stay open for longer than half a second. Then he was wheeled onto the lift and the humid heat that had not yet permeated the van\u2019s still-cool interior hit him in the face and seemed to suck all the air from his lungs.\n Groggy, almost gasping, he noticed the van was now green and brown, bearing the logo of a large national rental company. More unsettling was seeing that they were in a parking garage. The gray-haired man leaned over him, looking pastier and more impassive than ever. \u201cThis will be less unpleasant if we don\u2019t have to force you. Not that it\u2019s a party. But if I have to short your circuits, it\u2019ll only be more of an ordeal.\u201d\n Cody wasn\u2019t sure how to respond or even if he should.\n \u201cGood,\u201d the man said and made a let\u2019s-go gesture at the guy pushing his wheelchair.\n The escort surrounding him blocked his view of everything that wasn\u2019t straight ahead but he saw enough to know it was definitely underground and it was mostly empty. Which didn\u2019t mean anything, he told himself. The country was lousy with underground parking garages, it was just a coincidence he\u2019d seen that item on the news. LaDene had been right, he\u2019d just been scaring himself. He wasn\u2019t a mobster, he was a courier, just a goddam courier. People didn\u2019t go around killing couriers. Nobody wanted that kind of trouble, the couriers\u2019 union was too well connected and too powerful.\n A car engine started suddenly and the sound made him jump. The gray-haired man didn\u2019t even glance at him but the others moved in a little closer, hiding him from view. They stayed close, even after he heard the car pass, until they reached a bank of elevators. One was roped off with a sign that said it was out of service. The gray-haired man pressed the call button and twisted; it popped open on a hinge and he inserted a plain metal key.\n The elevator doors opened and Cody caught a strong whiff of antiseptic mixed with something flowery. His stomach turned over as they rolled him into the car, facing the back so he couldn\u2019t see what floor they were going to. There was no voice announcement or even a chime but he could make out a series of faint, airy thumps\u2014possibly just the motor running after a long period of disuse but Cody counted them anyway, noting when the air quality changed from rainforest to refrigerated, and estimated they stopped on the fourteenth or fifteenth floor.\n The place looked like a fancy clinic, right down to the immaculate receptionist at the immaculate, shiny white desk. The gray-haired man gave her a brisk wave as he strode past, walking very quickly now as he led the way through a maze of corridors to a room with a gurney and the machine they were going to use on him.\n \u201cTake your robe off and get comfortable,\u201d the gray-haired man said, jerking a thumb at the gurney.\n Cody obeyed, a bit surprised at how quickly everyone else had vanished, leaving him alone with the man. He held onto the robe, turning it sideways to use like a blanket. \u201cYou mind? I\u2019m kinda cold.\u201d\n \u201cAlready?\u201d The man was doing something with the machine; he gave a small, humorless laugh. \u201cMaybe we should get you some mitts and booties.\u201d\n \u201cYou could turn down the air conditioning,\u201d Cody said.\n No answer. Three people in white uniforms came in with a cart. Cody settled down with a sigh of resignation and closed his eyes so he wouldn\u2019t have to see the cannulas going in.\n Setting up seemed to take forever, although as far as he could tell, the hardware was up to date and they were all competent enough. Whoever had put the cannulas in his arm and leg was genuinely talented; it had been almost painless. The blood-pressure cuff on his other arm was actually more uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t know why they needed that anyway, when the hospital gown would tell them whatever they needed to know about his vitals. But he supposed under the circumstances they wanted both a belt and suspenders. They even made a business of verifying his blood type and his DNA before they finally began the process of filtering his blood.\n Once they got going, he felt a little lightheaded, as always, and colder than usual. He curled up as much as he could, huddling under the robe. There was very little conversation, all too low for him to make out; no one spoke to him. Eventually, he dozed off, mostly from boredom, and woke to find a pair of woolly socks on his feet. He didn\u2019t really feel any warmer but he was touched by the gesture all the same.\n Just for something to do, he tried to guess who had done it, watching them surreptitiously as they moved around, checking read-outs from him, from the machine, from his blood. The black woman with shoulder-length braids looked like she could have been someone\u2019s mother; if so, it was someone very young. Parents of young children were usually good for a kind deed. Or it might have been the Chinese guy who, like Cody, seemed to be in his late thirties.\n He couldn\u2019t decide about the older black woman. She checked his vitals more often than anyone else but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean she was more concerned about his welfare. For all he knew, the socks had come from old Gray Ponytail himself. Hadn\u2019t he mentioned something about booties before they\u2019d even started? Or it was one of the other people he\u2019d barely glimpsed, busily working with his blood somewhere behind him. Maybe between separating blood cells from plasma and pumping it back into him, someone had paused to think he might be cold.\n It went on for hours. Cody dozed, woke, dozed again. His stomach growled and subsided as hunger pangs threatened to turn into queasiness. How much longer, he wondered, irritable with boredom and lack of food. If they didn\u2019t call a halt soon, he was going to have some kind of major blood sugar episode.\n Almost as if he\u2019d caught something of Cody\u2019s thoughts, the gray-haired man tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cAre you supposed to eat something? Something in particular,\u201d he added, a bit impatiently.\n \u201cFood,\u201d Cody said, not caring how petulant he sounded.\n \u201cNot bread or sugar?\u201d\n \u201cJust food. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll give me any.\u201d\n \u201cWhat if we tried insulin instead?\u201d There was an edge in the man\u2019s voice. In his peripheral vision, Cody saw the younger woman and the Chinese guy look up from a tablet they\u2019d been studying together, obviously startled.\n \u201cRisky,\u201d Cody said. \u201cI\u2019m not diabetic. But you knew that.\u201d\n The man gazed at him for some unmeasured period of time. He was worn out, tried and frustrated, Cody realized with a surge of spiteful joy; they all were but him most of all, because he was on the hook for whatever went wrong.\n Abruptly, he blew out an exasperated breath and turned away. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep him any longer. Shut it down, give him lunch, and let\u2019s get him out of here.\u201d\n Lunch turned out to be a can of nutrient with a straw; Cody was too hungry to feel more than a vague, momentary disappointment. The gray-haired man sat and glared at him. Hoping Cody would give up the goods somehow at the last minute? Or just being a sore loser?\n \u201cHow old are you?\u201d the man asked suddenly.\n Cody paused and wiped his mouth. Considering how long they\u2019d run his blood, he must have known, and a lot more besides. \u201cThirty-seven. Why?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little old to be a decoy?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m a courier.\u201d He went back to the drink.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a decoy. A zero. A nothing. Less than nothing.\u201d\n Cody had no response for that; he kept drinking.\n \u201cThe one that sold you out, she was probably the real courier. Wasn\u2019t she?\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d But even as he asked, he knew. Her name was on the tip of his tongue but he managed not to say it aloud.\n \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? You\u2019re just\u2014what? A day-laborer who doesn\u2019t mind needles and won\u2019t faint at the sight of blood? She\u2019s carrying. LaVerne or LaRue, whatever her name is.\u201d\n Cody pressed his lips together briefly. Whether the guy was telling the truth or fishing for a keyword, it wouldn\u2019t hurt not to give it to him. \u201cRoughly ten percent of the population faints at the sight of blood,\u201d he said chattily. \u201cIt\u2019s a physical reaction, they can\u2019t help it. Nothing to do with their character or anything.\u201d\n \u201cThank you for that piece of enlightenment.\u201d Despite his obvious irritation, his face was more impassive than ever, not to mention pastier. Now there were small flakes of what looked like dry skin around the man\u2019s hairline. The disguise was starting to break down, the wig parting company with the silicone mask. Everything probably should have been removed hours ago but the guy had kept nursing it along with touch-ups. Because he\u2019d expected it would all by over by now, data extracted and delivered, payment collected and he\u2019d be on his way to his next case, already forgetting what Cody looked like.\n Instead he was sitting in a small, cold room with nothing to show for his effort but a spray-on about to peel off his face and nothing to look forward to except the displeasure of whoever he was working for, the loss of his fee, and a crew he had to pay anyway.\n Cody finished the drink and set the empty can down beside him on the gurney. Well, that wasn\u2019t fun. Whaddaya wanna do next?\n It was the last thought he had for a while.\n Sounds nudged him gradually toward awareness, until he understood the voices and various other noises were real, not lingering fragments of dreams, or dream-like flashes from lost hours, possibly days. Eyes still closed, he rolled over, turning his face away from the bright light overhead and smelled clean sheets, along with alcohol, powder, and cleanser. Hospital emergency room, he thought with cautious relief; there were worse places to wake up.\n His memory was patchy but he knew the basics of what had happened. As soon as his captors had been sure they wouldn\u2019t find anything in his blood, they no longer had to worry about contamination and dosed Cody\u2019s so-called lunch. Pretty heavily, if the lead-balloon sensation in his head was any indication. Just by way of kicking his ass for having nothing of value.\n Once the lunch had taken effect, they had dressed him up and dumped him someplace where he could sleepwalk indefinitely without attracting attention. Like, say, a large mall. Or a shopping village; one with a multi-screen cineplex. Cody wondered how long he had been aimlessly roaming before anyone noticed something odd about him. There were all kinds of stories. Everybody in the union knew one about a courier who had woken up to find she\u2019d wandered into a house and spent five days with people who\u2019d thought she was a long-lost relative. Cody suspected that one was apocryphal.\n Two days later, he was in a DC-area suburb, although he wasn\u2019t sure exactly which state. State-line ambiguity was getting to be a habit with him.\n \u201cHow\u2019d you like Oklahoma City?\u201d asked the medic from where she sat at the lighting panel. She was a slightly plump woman with one brown eye and one blue eye; the difference was made more noticeable by the port wine stain covering that side of her face from hairline to the corner of her mouth.\n \u201cI only saw a parking garage, a clinic, and part of a hospital.\u201d Cody finished undressing and stood with his back to the plain white wall. \u201cReady when you are.\u201d\n \u201cAh, you\u2019ve done this before. I don\u2019t even have to tell you to close your eyes and hold perfectly still.\u201d\n He took a breath and held it. Sometimes he imagined he could sense the UV light change as the scanning line traveled over his body. Years ago, when he had first become a courier, they\u2019d showed him a video of himself being scanned. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d looked like a fantasy creature\u2014one of Lewis Carroll\u2019s fabulous monsters that had wandered out of the looking glass into a high-tech lab.\n Blaschko\u2019s Lines, a doctor had told him, years ago. Only visible under certain kinds of UV light.\n He\u2019d done research on his own, wondered about lesions or the possibility of waking up one morning to find himself permanently piebald. He would dream that the lines running up and down his arms and legs, traveling in waves on his torso, looping on his back, swirling all over his head would appear spontaneously and without warning in normal light; sometimes they were permanent. Other times, they\u2019d flash on and off like a warning light.\n He hadn\u2019t had that kind of anxiety dream in a long time. They\u2019d faded away with the hotspots. Maybe now they were both coming back.\n \u201cDone,\u201d the medic called.\n Relieved, Cody took a deep breath and stepped away from the wall to get dressed again. The medic asked his permission before she swabbed the inside of his cheek, and again before scraping a few skin cells from his lower back, his hip, and his knee. He was immensely grateful for the courtesy. It was always nice when someone treated a courier like a human being in a demanding profession rather than merely a meat-bag for data.\n The guy who escorted him to his room for the night was was wearing the standard gopher attire\u2014a multi-pocketed vest over plain t-shirt, jeans, and running shoes\u2014but had a military bearing that he didn\u2019t even try to hide. Cody wasn\u2019t surprised to find someone waiting for him when he got there. It had been a while since the last sales pitch.\n \u201cWe\u2019re all very glad to have you back safe.\u201d The woman in the swivel chair by the desk was dark-haired and dark-skinned and her voice had the faint but unmistakable lilt that Hindi speakers never lost completely. He had seen her before a few times, dressed as she was now in a black jacket and trousers, but only in passing. She was one of those people who gave the impression of being taller because of the way she carried herself. Not military-style like his friend now standing at obvious parade rest between himself and the door, just with authority. In charge. The touches of gray in her hair suggested she was older than he was, though he couldn\u2019t have said how much\u2014more than ten, less than thirty.\n \u201cI\u2019m glad to be back,\u201d he said, feeling a little awkward as he stood in front of her. She gestured for him to sit down on the bed, the only other furniture in the room, unless you counted the forty-inch screen in the wall.\n \u201cYou automatically get a week of recuperation but we\u2019ll sign off on two or even three.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOr four.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d\n \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the first time for you, was it.\u201d\n As if she didn\u2019t know, he thought, careful to keep a straight face. Then he realized she was actually waiting for an answer. \u201cNo,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cI hope that it wasn\u2019t especially bad for you.\u201d\n He shook his head. His memory was still quite spotty\u2014his clearest recollection was of an older man with a ponytail and having to lie very still in a cold room while his blood was pumped out of his body and back in again. He also had the idea that there had been someone in the hotel room with him before he\u2019d been kidnapped but that didn\u2019t seem likely. Considering how heavily he\u2019d been drugged, he was probably lucky he still remembered his childhood.\n Unless I rented it out for a database. Another of those left-field thoughts that had been popping into his head for the last few days. They\u2019d probably meant something once.\n \u201c . . . sure you will be happy to know that your kidnappers came away with nothing,\u201d the woman was saying, \u201cthanks to your unique . . . ah, condition.\u201d\n He smiled a little. \u201cI never thought of being a chimera as a condition like, oh, excessive perspiration. Or psoriasis.\u201d\n \u201cIt does make you uniquely suited for deep encryption. Even if your kidnappers had thought to use your DNA to activate your blood, they wouldn\u2019t know you have more than one kind of DNA, much less that they needed to scan you under UV for the entire key.\u201d\n His kidnappers; the way she said it made it sound almost as if they belonged to him in some way. Or like they were his personal problem\u2014his condition.\n \u201cEventually, that\u2019ll occur to someone. If someone else doesn\u2019t sell it to them first,\u201d he added. The memory of a woman\u2019s name, LaRue or LaDene, and an old movie flickered in his brain and was gone.\n \u201cSuch optimism.\u201d She gave a short laugh. \u201cThe average merc can\u2019t afford to rent a full sequencer, let alone personnel to run it who would be smart enough to figure out you had two kinds of DNA, or that they\u2019d need both for decryption.\u201d She gave another slightly heartier laugh. \u201cContrary to what you may have heard, the evil genius is mostly mythical. Nobody turns to crime because of their towering intellect.\n \u201cBut that\u2019s neither here nor there. We still want you to work solely for us. I know that someone has made you this offer before\u2014a few times, yes? As an employee, you would be paid substantially more, along with bonuses for crisis situations\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Crisis situations?\u2019 Is that anything like \u2018hazardous duty\u2019?\u201d\n She barely hesitated as she acknowledged his interruption. \u201cOccupational benefits are also quite generous. Health coverage, vacation time, paternity leave\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDental?\u201d\n Now she paused to give him a look. \u201cAnd optical. Even a clothing allowance.\u201d\n He was tempted to comment on how she had used hers but decided not to get personal.\n \u201cWe can also be very flexible in terms of your cover,\u201d she went on. \u201cSome sort of independent, low-key profession, like an accountant or a transcriber or\u2014\u201d she floundered suddenly and he could tell it wasn\u2019t something that happened to her very often.\n \u201cSoftware engineer,\u201d he suggested, then smiled sheepishly. \u201cKidding.\u201d\n \u201cThat could work, as long as it\u2019s something nice and ordinary. Wedding albums, family albums, baby pictures, that sort of thing\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI really was kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cSoftware mystifies me.\u201d\n \u201cYou could even be semi-retired\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, apologetic but firm. \u201cIf I go to work for you, I\u2019m no longer a courier. I\u2019m a government employee in a highly sensitive area under military jurisdiction. Once I lose my union membership, all bets are off. All I have is you.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot,\u201d the woman said reprovingly. \u201cYou have no idea how much.\u201d\n Actually, I do, he thought at her, but if I\u2019m flayed and hung up in a parking garage, I won\u2019t care about the cover story. He shook his head again.\n \u201cIf we take you into the fold, we can tell you more about what you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t you want to know\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d It came out louder and more emphatic than he\u2019d intended but he wasn\u2019t sorry. \u201cI don\u2019t. You\u2019ve got me this much. I agreed to cooperate because I don\u2019t need to be in the fold to be an encryption key. I\u2019ll keep the secret but I don\u2019t want to be the secret.\u201d\n The woman shook her head. \u201cPlease. You went over that line a long time ago.\u201d\n \u201cNot quite,\u201d he insisted. \u201cMy body, yes. But not me.\u201d\n She stood up, stretching a little. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again. This government doesn\u2019t give up that easily.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhich government is that, anyway?\u201d\n The question caught her off-guard and for a moment she stared at him, open mouthed. Then she threw back her head and laughed. \u201cOh, very good,\u201d she said, as the man opened the door for her. \u201cVery, very good.\u201d She started to leave, then hesitated. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really your name: Cody.\u201d\n \u201cYeah. My name\u2019s really Cody.\u201d Something flickered in his memory again but it was gone before he could think about it. He lay down on the bed and found the remote under one of the pillows.\n \u201cWell, that was fun,\u201d he said, to no one and to whatever bugs might be listening, and turned on the TV. \u201cNow whaddaya wanna do?\u201d\n Originally published in TRSF: The Best New Science Fiction,edited by Stephen Cass.\n Pat Cadigan was born in Schenectady, New York, and now lives in London with her family. She made her first professional sale in 1980, and has subsequently come to be regarded as one of the best new writers of her generation. Her story \"Pretty Boy Crossover\" has appeared on several critic's lists as among the best science fiction stories of the 1980's, and her story \"Angel\" was a finalist for the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, and the World Fantasy Award (one of the few stories ever to earn that rather unusual distinction). Her short fiction--which has appeared in most of the major markets, including Asimov's ScienceFiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction--has been gathered in the collections Patterns and Dirty Work. Her first novel, Mindplayers, was released in 1987 to excellent critical response, and her second novel, Synners, released in 1991, won the Arthur C. Clarke Award as the year's best science-fiction novel, as did her third novel, Fools, making her the only writer ever to win the Clarke Award twice. Her other books include the novels Dervish Is Digital, Tea from an Empty Cup, and Reality Used to Be a Friend of Mine, and, as editor, the anthology The Ultimate Cyberpunk, as well as two making-of movie books and four media tie-in novels."}

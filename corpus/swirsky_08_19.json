Abigail! Oh. It\u2019s good\u2014it\u2019s so good to see you.\n Mom. Hi.\n You look so much like you. I feel like I could reach out and touch your face. Your face! It\u2019s so good to see your face.\n Yeah, you too.\n It\u2019s so good. It\u2019s, oh, I just don\u2019t\u2014Abigail, I don\u2019t know what to say.\n Say what you want, Mom.\n How much of you\u2014I don\u2019t know. Maybe I really shouldn\u2019t ask, but\u2014How much of you is in there?\n I\u2019m me, Mom.\n I mean, I have the chart here\u2014I know your scan was only about a month out of date. But is it you you?\n Yeah, of course.\n I mean, is it you or\u2014How much is the computer, really?\n Mom. I\u2019m me.\n Are you sure? What do you remember?\n Everything. Come on. You just said it. My scan was only a month out of date.\n No, I mean, what\u2019s the last thing you remember? Where do you feel like you are?\n Oh, fine. It\u2019s afternoon. I\u2019m getting my scan. Traffic has been so bad all day. I had a fight with Robin this afternoon about the laundry. Again. I\u2019m so damn tired.\n What\u2019s it like?\n Hot. There\u2019s a fan, but it\u2019s not on. My eyes hurt and I don\u2019t want to spend any more time today staring at a screen so I\u2019m looking out the window.\n And?\n There\u2019s a janitor cutting hedges. There\u2019s a man walking a tiny dog on the lawn. My hair feels sweaty. I want to go home. What do you want me to say?\n You want to go home?\n I\u2019m just so damn tired. I need time on the couch with a book. Unless Robin decides we should start fighting World War III over the laundry again.\n But you can\u2019t really go home. You know that. Right, Abigail?\n Obviously.\n You\u2019re only in the computer. You can\u2019t come out.\n I know.\n I don\u2019t know. Maybe this was a bad idea. Is it cruel? Am I just bringing you back to kill you all over again?\n You\u2019re freaking out, Mom. Stop it.\n I realized I\u2019ve been putting this off for almost five years. It would have been your thirtieth birthday last week. Maybe I should have come earlier, but I just wasn\u2019t\u2014sure if it would be cruel\u2014\n It\u2019s fine.\n And I . . . didn\u2019t know if I wanted to.\n Oh.\n I\u2019m sorry. Oh, God. I\u2019m terrible.\n Whatever. It\u2019s not important.\n Now you\u2019re angry.\n Don\u2019t tell me how I feel.\n No. This isn\u2019t right. You don\u2019t sound like you. You look like you . . . but you don\u2019t sound like you at all.\n Excuse me?\n You\u2019re so flat . . . You sound . . . like you\u2019re champagne, and someone left you open.\n I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that.\n There\u2019s nothing in your voice but frustration.\n Sorry. It\u2019s been that kind of day. You know, the kind where you\u2019re like, This goddamn shower is too wet.\n You sound like you just can\u2019t be bothered. Like it\u2019s just some Saturday when your sister called for last-minute help with the kids when you and Robin already had plans\u2014\n \u2014Goddamn, three PM should not be rush hour\u2014\n \u2014or some evening when you had to run back to the store for wiper fluid\u2014\n \u2014I was just coming in for a normal scan, you know?\n Abigail. You haven\u2019t even asked me about Robin.\n I didn\u2019t?\n No.\n I hope she\u2019s not still upset that I threw her bras in with the wash instead of using the lingerie bags.\n Abigail, that happened a long time . . .\n Yeah, I know. If I was still around, she miiiiight have even forgiven me by now.\n Abigail!\n What? It\u2019s a joke.\n You shouldn\u2019t talk about her like that.\n Sorry, I was just blowing off steam.\n You sound like you didn\u2019t even love her.\n How can you say that? Of course I love her. How can you even say that?\n You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry.\n I love her more than anything. Does it really seem like I don\u2019t love her?\n No. It seemed . . . like you bickered a lot. But everyone knew you loved each other. It was like a glow on you.\n I should have been more careful. She probably wouldn\u2019t have been so upset except it was her favorite bra.\n That was probably it.\n But how does anyone even have a favorite bra, you know? Ugh, I just want to go home. It\u2019s hot. The leaf blower is SO LOUD.\n Abbie.\n What?\n You know you can\u2019t.\n What?\n You can\u2019t go home.\n Of course I know! We already talked about this. My scan was only a month out of date.\n Okay, honey.\n It\u2019s just uncomfortable in here.\n Okay.\n It was an awful ride over. Did I tell you that? My air conditioner isn\u2019t working. It puffs out hot air. And the traffic\u2014\n Abigail, I should have told you earlier. We don\u2019t have much time to talk. The ten minute warning just went off.\n Huh? Oh. Sure, fine.\n I\u2019m sorry. I probably can\u2019t afford this again. It\u2019s just so expensive. Did you know it keeps getting more expensive the longer they keep someone in storage?\n Oh, that\u2019s just because of data decay.\n I didn\u2019t realize how good it would be to see your face.\n Ugh. I\u2019m all sweaty.\n I\u2019m here because Robin made me promise to come before she died. She wanted you to know it wasn\u2019t your fault. You were\u2014already gone by then.\n My fault?\n Do you remember? You were driving the car.\n The car?\n The police said there was nothing you could have done. The other driver would have hit you even if your reflexes were perfect.\n What? No.\n The other driver was from Florida. She didn\u2019t know how to handle the mountains.\n No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\n I only had a few minutes with you at the hospital. You kept saying over and over again how it was your fault. You wanted me to tell Robin\u2019s parents they were right, she never should have married you. But I didn\u2019t, because it wasn\u2019t your fault.\n No. That isn\u2019t right. I don\u2019t think that happened.\n Robin made me promise to talk to you. She said she could hear you talking to me, asking me to tell her parents that, but she was in surgery then. She must have imagined it. I guess. Or\u2014I don\u2019t know.\n I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s hard to hear over the leaf blower. Maybe we should talk again later.\n Robin made it for a few days. We all thought she might\u2014well. She needed you to know she didn\u2019t blame you.\n It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t try to do the laundry correctly, but she has all these rules.\n It was an accident, Abbie. A terrible accident.\n She should do it herself if she\u2019s going to be so picky.\n I don\u2019t know. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have come at all. I told Robin it wouldn\u2019t really be you, but she made me promise.\n I\u2019m me!\n No, honey. If you were you, you\u2019d be screaming. I just told you. Robin died.\n Don\u2019t tell me how I feel! Damn it, why don\u2019t they just turn on the fan?\n You\u2019re just something . . . stuck . . . in a bad afternoon.\n There\u2019s sweat in my hair. I need to get home to my chair and a book. WHY IS IT SO DAMN HOT?\n Abigail and Robin, they\u2014They should have gotten the same chances as everyone else. You know? A house, a family. Sometimes I just\u2014wonder. Do you think she could have forgiven me for bringing her into the world when she had so little time?\n We always fight, me and Robin. But there\u2019s a secret.\n What?\n We always make up again.\n Yes.\n Huh?\n Yes, you always did.\n Hi, Mom. It\u2019s hot, isn\u2019t it? I just want to go home.\n I know, Abigail. It\u2019s been a long day.\n Author\u2019s Note: This story was inspired by the game \u201cIsland in a Sea of Solitude\u201d by P.H.

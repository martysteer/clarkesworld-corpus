It was the middle of May, and the ice was still about a meter thick. I made an indentation large enough to hold a bundle of six explosive cartridges.\nOne cartridge in the bundle was primed with a number 6 electric blasting cap. I attached the lead wires to the cap, placed the cartridges in the crater I had made, then scraped the ice chips back into the hole to cover them. The afternoon sun would warm the surface and melt the snow a little. In the chill of the evening, it would refreeze, sealing the charge in place.\nI walked north on the ice, unrolling the lead wires. The spruce trees that surrounded the lake tilted this way and that, leaning on each other like drunks at closing time. A drunken forest. The trees had grown in the permafrost, the permanently frozen soil of the Arctic Circle, and their roots were shallow. As the frozen soil had melted, the trees had abandoned their upright posture, beginning a slow motion fall toward the ground. As the permafrost melted, it released methane, the main component of natural gas.\nI stopped to brush snow off the ice and chip another crater. Beneath the black ice I could see thousands of white blobs, as numerous as stars in the sky. Some were as big as my hand; some as big as my head. Each one was a bubble of methane released by the melting permafrost and trapped beneath the ice.\nI looked up when I heard the crunch of footsteps in the snow. My friend Anaaya grinned at me. \u201cYou\u2019re slow, Doctor Maggie. I\u2019ve already finished the other side of the lake.\u201d\nAnaaya was the only person who insisted on the honorific. She was an old friend. We had been roommates in our freshman year at University of Alaska. She had graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering; I had gone on to get a doctorate.\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re faster,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou actually know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you out, Doctor Slowpoke.\u201d\nIt was a small lake, but it took us three hours working together to plant all the charges. When we were done, we surveyed our work from the lakeshore. The afternoon breeze was already blowing snow across the lake, erasing our footprints. The charges and the connecting wire were invisible beneath the snow and ice.\n\u201cNo sign that we were ever here,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe were never here,\u201d she said. \u201cWho would ever stop at this lake? No one. No fishing here, no hunting\u2014no reason to stop. You\u2019re on your way to check on a methane monitoring station; I\u2019m looking into some reports of illegal trapping for my aunt.\u201d Anaaya\u2019s aunt was involved in tribal management. \u201cAll official business.\u201d\nLooking out over the lake at the drunken forest, tilted trees as far as the eye could see, I didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nWe returned to our snowmobiles and headed north to accomplish our official business.\nTwo weeks later, the lake exploded. Our charges had cracked the ice and ignited the rising methane.\nI wasn\u2019t there to see it happen. No one was. But three satellites were perfectly positioned to capture the show. Two aerospace engineers\u2014friends of friends who could not be traced to me\u2014had independently calculated the orbits and set the ideal time for the explosion. They had done a good job. The satellite images were spectacular. A very impressive mushroom cloud. Trees for miles around the lake were blasted with ice shards.\nAn ecoterrorist, JollyGreen, took credit for the explosion, releasing a lengthy manifesto about the melting of the permafrost and the release of methane. JollyGreen was a sock puppet, of course. Not my sock puppet. The sock puppet of a friend of a friend of a friend with no connections back to me.\nJollyGreen\u2019s basic message was this: Earth\u2019s average global surface temperature was increasing and the Arctic was heating up faster than the rest of the planet. The permafrost was melting and releasing methane, which was twenty times better at trapping the sun\u2019s heat than carbon dioxide. More methane meant more warming. That meant more permafrost melting, which meant more methane and more warming . . . and so on in a positive feedback loop with negative consequences.\n\u201cThe human race is already screwed because of climate change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere\u2019ll be flooding, famine, drought, and more. Too late to turn all that around, but it can get worse. If all the permafrost melts, we are royally screwed. Mass extinctions, mass die-off of phytoplankton and disruption of the ocean\u2019s ecosystems, wildfires on land. Nowhere to run; nowhere to hide.\u201d\nFor the next few days, news programs featured Arctic researchers explaining the consequences of climate change north of the Arctic Circle. Some of my former colleagues at the University of Alaska were quizzed on camera about the permafrost and methane in Arctic lakes. Several cited my work. Yes, they said, the permafrost was melting, methane constantly bubbled up under Arctic lakes. None of this was secret information.\nI was not among the scientists interviewed. I heard that a couple of reporters trying to find a way to contact me put pressure on the PR department at the university, but no one gave me up. They just said I was no longer affiliated with the university.\nA month later, after the explosion had faded from the news cycle, the National Science Foundation called me. I was about 100 miles away from the exploding lake, making coffee over a driftwood fire in Ivvavik National Park, Canada\u2019s least visited national park. I had spent the month living in a qarmaq, a sod-roofed hut built decades before by an Inuit family to serve as a winter camp. It was just large enough for me, Claire, and Marina\u2014grad students who had elected to spend the summer getting a little field experience working with me. The qarmaq was conveniently situated right beside the one-acre plot where I was testing a unique method of capturing methane released by melting permafrost.\nHere there were no spruce trees to betray the softening of the soil beneath the surface. Low grasses and shrubs grew in a boggy landscape. Nestled among the plants were carbon fiber tubes, woven together to make a very loose mat. In some areas, the fibers had been trampled into the soil by a passing herd of reindeer.\nA year before, I had submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation about this pilot project. I had called this tangle of carbon fiber tubes a \u2018methane sequestering mat.\u2019 When NSF turned down my grant proposal, I had posted the project on a crowdfunding site, where I referred to it as a \u2018fart catcher.\u2019 Crowdfunding had financed my one-acre pilot project.\nIt was a warm day by Arctic standards\u2014slightly above freezing. I wore hiking boots with two pairs of wool socks, rather than the large white bunny boots\u2014rubber inside and out with thick insulation between the waterproof layers\u2014that were necessary in the winter. I could breathe without a filter to warm the air before it reached my lungs. Practically balmy.\nI was talking with Claire and Marina about plans for the day when the satellite phone rang. The call was from an NSF program officer, the same guy who had turned down my grant proposal. But that had been before the lake exploded, before permafrost became\u2014ever so briefly\u2014the star of the 24/7 news cycle, before some members of Congress began calling for zero methane emissions in the Arctic.\nNSF was adding a new initiative that focused on methane emission from the melting permafrost. The program officer had called my house in Fairbanks and persuaded the house sitter to give him the number of my satellite phone. He wanted to discuss my proposal for a methane-sequestering mat.\nSitting on a camp stool by the driftwood fire, looking out over the tundra and the tangle of carbon fibers, I told the program officer about results to date from my crowdfunded prototype. Knowing that this program officer had an engineering background, I focused on how the project made use of recent innovations in nanotechnology\u2014the carbon fiber tubes, the low pressure methane-hydrate storage tank made possible by advances in carbon nanotube technology. I recited numbers\u2014emission rates, kilograms of methane recovered. It was a cordial and productive conversation.\nNine months later, I landed at Franklin Research Station. Built of recycled shipping containers and located on the coastal tundra just outside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the station was a low rust-colored box surrounded by ice. To the north, the Beaufort Sea\u2014a plain of ice stretching away to meet the blue sky. To the south, the Brooks Range\u2014mountains that looked as if they had been sculpted from snow, not just covered by it. I had been lucky to fly in during a calm spell. March was the start of the Arctic research season, but the weather was always dicey.\n\u201cWelcome to your home away from home,\u201d the pilot called out as he turned the plane\u2019s nose into the wind and brought it down smoothly on the ice-covered runway.\n\u201cHappy to be here,\u201d I said sincerely.\nA few hours later, after unpacking my gear, I repeated that sentiment as I met with Jackson Hanks, the head of operations at the station. I had done my research on the man. He was twenty years my senior. A biologist by training, but he had been head of operations here for more than a decade, while station managers had come and gone.\nA former colleague from my university days who had spent a summer at Franklin Station provided me with more detailed information than Google ever could: \u201cThat guy? He\u2019ll never go rogue. He knows how to work the system. He\u2019s never the leader but always in charge. He keeps his head down and knows where all the bodies are buried.\u201d\nOki, the head cook at Franklin Station, was a distant cousin of my friend Anaaya. He had provided even more important information: what Jackson Hanks liked to drink.\nI arrived in Jackson\u2019s office with a bottle of bourbon. \u201cA gift from the south,\u201d I said, as I set it on his desk. \u201cMy sources say it\u2019s your favorite brand.\u201d\nJackson smiled, opened the bottle, and brought two glasses out of a drawer. \u201cA pleasure to meet you, Dr. Lindsey.\u201d\n\u201cMaggie,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody calls me doctor.\u201d I accepted a glass of bourbon and sat across the desk from him. We engaged in the usual small talk of the Arctic, discussing the weather, the state of the sea ice, my good luck in getting in before the wind picked up. At that moment the wind was blasting the triple-paned office window with ice crystals and making the station vibrate with a steady hum.\nJackson sipped his bourbon, then told me they\u2019d been having problems with polar bears of late. That led to a story about a grad student who had come to the station to study the population decline of polar bears. \u201cHe thought they were cute until he got trapped in a remote observation blind for three days when a couple of young bears decided he\u2019d make a good snack. After that, he switched to studying the decline of the parrotfish population in coral reefs off the coast of the Yucatan.\u201d\n\u201cHe could have switched to Arctic foxes,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThey\u2019re plenty cute and not at all menacing unless you\u2019re a lemming.\u201d\nJackson shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s better off in the tropics. He didn\u2019t belong up here.\u201d\n\u201cSo you condemned him to sweltering on the beach and watching the sea level rise.\u201d\n\u201cDrinking warm beer because there\u2019s no ice. Battening down for hurricanes. Battling giant tropical spiders.\u201d\nWe lifted our glasses and toasted the guy who couldn\u2019t cut it in our environment of choice.\n\u201cWhen I found out you were coming to the station, I asked a few sources of my own about you,\u201d he told me.\n\u201cFind out anything interesting?\u201d\n\u201cThe station manager at McMurdo says you passed his test, and that\u2019s good.\u201d\nWhen I was in grad school, I\u2019d spent a summer at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, helping with a study of the microbiome of Antarctic soils.\n\u201cWhat test was that?\u201d I asked. I didn\u2019t remember a test.\n\u201cHe watches what people do in the cafeteria. He looks for people who are just as comfortable in a group discussion as they are sitting by themselves. You passed.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cI get along with people,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I can get along alone.\u201d\nHe leaned back in his chair, studying me. \u201cTell me\u2014why did you leave the university? You were teaching, doing research, on a tenure track.\u201d\n\u201cOne too many committee meetings,\u201d I said lightly. He laughed, and I added, \u201cI like to get things done.\u201d\n\u201cI can understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo tell me about this methane sequestering mat of yours. Or do you prefer \u2018fart catcher\u2019?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cEither one.\u201d Since Jackson was a biologist, I launched into an explanation of the biology of the system. \u201cThe mat\u2019s made of carbon fiber tubes, but what makes it work is the colony of bacteria in those tubes.\u201d\nIt turned out that Jackson knew quite a bit about Methylomirabilis oxyfera, the bacteria that made the mat work. Amazing critters those\u2014they thrive in stinking black mud without light or oxygen, digesting methane and nitrogen oxides for their energy. In the tubes of the mat, they consumed enough methane to create a concentration gradient that kept the methane flowing into the tubes and rising into a storage tank.\n\u201cA biological methane pump?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s clever. And you want to cover a square mile with this fart catcher? That\u2019s ambitious.\u201d\n\u201cA square mile is just a start. We have to move fast, you know. With the current rate of methane emission . . . \u201d\nHe held up a hand to stop me. \u201cHold on. I don\u2019t need to hear another manifesto on Arctic warming. I live here, remember?\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cHaving that lake blow up gave your permafrost research quite a boost, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it did.\u201d\n\u201cI can understand the motives of whoever did it. No one pays any attention to what happens up here unless it\u2019s involves something cataclysmic or cute. Polar bears get press; permafrost usually doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just waited.\nHe studied me, then smiled, ever so slightly. \u201cI assume that safety protocols will ensure that there will be no explosions associated with your project.\u201d\nI nodded quickly. \u201cI can assure you of that.\u201d\nHe poured another glass. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a crew to lay out this fart catcher of yours. I trust you\u2019ll supervise the work.\u201d\nI did more than supervise. I worked alongside the crew that rolled out the fart catcher. It was nasty tedious work. The crew described it as hellacious, and I had to agree.\nMy test plot in Ivvavik National Park had been a flat grassy area. It had been easy to push the carbon tubes down so they made contact with the soil. On the coastal plain surrounding Franklin Station, the land was flat, but the vegetation was less cooperative. The fart catcher had to lie flat against the soil, so we had to clear away tough shrubs\u2014willow and Labrador tea. We had to pound down dense tussocks formed by sedges and grasses. In a month and a half, we managed to install less than a quarter of the projected area.\nI contacted some friends about the problem. It takes a team to save the world, after all. I had many friends and they had friends and their friends had friends. Social media was wonderful that way. My friends (and their friends) often had creative solutions. Some people talk about thinking outside the box. Many of my friends had never seen the box. They were unaware that the box existed. I sent out the word and waited to see what would happen.\nA month later, as the crew and I were clearing yet another patch of willow, I heard someone call to me. I looked up to see a herd of shaggy beasts lumbering over the tundra toward us.\nMuskoxen\u2014Pleistocene megafauna at its most charismatic. They\u2019re called oxen, but they\u2019re actually more closely related to goats. Their ancestors had survived the mass extinction event that occurred during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene. The herd stopped at the edge of the carbon tube carpet, eying me myopically as they stood shoulder to shoulder, ready to dispatch any predator with their large pointy horns.\n\u201cHello!\u201d Someone in a lavender parka came around the side of the herd and waved to me. \u201cWe\u2019re here at last.\u201d\nThat was Jenna, leader of the muskoxen herders. There were five muskoxen herders, two Royal Canadian Mounties, and a dozen cows and six calves. They had traveled from a muskoxen farm some 150 miles to the south.\nI escorted the people and their shaggy charges to Franklin Station. While the ox herders found a patch of good grazing for the beasts, the Mounties met with Jackson and presented him with the official paperwork. Apparently, a Canadian muskoxen farm had donated the animals to Franklin Station\u2014a donation approved by a top level official in the US agency responsible for polar research. It was unclear where the request for this donation had originated.\nWhile Jackson chatted with the Mounties about their journey, I helped his assistant research the situation. The path of official approvals was an insane tangle, involving at least three agencies on the US side and the same number on the Canadian side. But in the end, it didn\u2019t really matter who had approved what. The muskoxen were an official gift from Canada to the US. Officials on the US side made it quite clear that sending the muskoxen away would cause an international incident.\nBesides, news of the gift was already trending on all news feeds\u2014it was the warm and fuzzy story of the day. A muskox calf is not nearly as cute as an Arctic fox, but they do have a certain charm. In those days of doom and gloom and climate change, cheery stories associated with polar science were hard to come by.\nSo Franklin Station gained a herd of muskoxen. Jackson found temporary quarters for the Mounties and the ox herders and arranged for a crew to set up a paddock for the beasts. To help out, I volunteered to take charge of the care of the muskoxen, mentioning that they could be an asset to my project. Muskoxen would happily devour tundra shrubs. Their hooves would break up and flatten the lumps and bumps in the soil, making it easier to roll out the fart catcher.\nWhen the visitors headed to their quarters, Jackson asked me to stay. \u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cHow did you make this happen?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t make it happen.\u201d After a moment\u2019s pause, I went on. \u201cI talked about the problems we\u2019ve been having with laying out the fart catcher with a friend who studies muskoxen. He reminded me that large ruminants were great at modifying the environment. I did say that it was a pity I didn\u2019t happen to have any of those. He must have mentioned it to someone who decided to help out.\u201d\nJackson shook his head, looking incredulous.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that if you put the word out to enough people, useful stuff happens. You never know what it\u2019s going to be. But sometimes, it\u2019s just what you need.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nuts. That\u2019s no way to manage a project.\u201d\nI leaned forward in my chair. \u201cThose beasts will make a big difference to how much mat we can install before winter. And you know this project is important. You\u2019ve seen the changes in the Arctic over the last decade.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I have.\u201d\n\u201cReduction in the sea ice. Steadily increasing temperature. Changes in wildlife patterns. Changes in weather patterns. When will the climate reach the tipping point? How long do you think we have? Another decade or two? Then what?\u201d\n\u201cYou think you\u2019ll save the world with a square mile of fart catcher and a dozen muskoxen?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a start. Baby steps, but it\u2019s a beginning. I promise there\u2019ll be no explosions. I\u2019ll take care of the herd. They won\u2019t bother you a bit.\u201d\nOver the next few weeks I worked with the ox herders to learn the ways of the shaggy beasts. The herd grazed in the area around the station, returning to their paddock at night for special muskox treats\u2014carrots mostly. A muskox will follow you anywhere for a carrot.\nThe head of PR at the station shot photos and video: muskoxen grazing with the research station in the background, muskoxen in their newly built paddock, muskox calves sleeping by their muskox mamas. It was great PR for the station, and that earned Jackson some points with the administration. All good.\nAfter a couple of weeks, the ox herders headed back to their farm, promising to return in the spring to comb out the qiviut, the muskoxen\u2019s underwool. It was a great cash crop, eight times warmer than wool and softer than cashmere. As a farewell gift, the ox herders gave me a set of long johns knit from qiviut\u2014the warmest, softest, and most expensive underwear I\u2019ve ever owned.\nSo that was my first summer at the station\u2014laying carpet, bringing in some muskoxen, collecting some 30 metric tons of methane. Calculations for required storage had been spot on\u2014the storage tanks were almost full. It was a good start, but it was time to move on to the next phase, one that was not covered in my grant application: disposing of the methane without adding it to the atmosphere and in the process funding a significant increase in the methane harvest.\nIn the Fall, I left the station to get some business done in the lower forty-eight. I presented a paper at the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual meeting in San Francisco and met with a few research teams from Siberia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada who were engaged in similar projects. While I was there, I also met with a German research group that was working on methane cracking.\nHere\u2019s a quick chemistry lesson. Methane is made of carbon and hydrogen. In methane cracking, hydrogen is separated from carbon to make hydrogen gas and carbon. Hydrogen is a great fuel. Think of the Hindenburg: a big bag of hydrogen and a major explosion. If you burn hydrogen, you get water. No carbon dioxide, no greenhouse gas problem.\nAnd here\u2019s a bonus. What\u2019s left when you take away the hydrogen is pure carbon. Perfect for making more carbon tubes to capture and store methane and valuable on the commodities market for use in manufacturing. Many companies from car makers to aircraft builders were switching from steel to lighter stronger carbon fiber to make their products. You can see why I was interested in methane cracking.\nI met the Germans at a restaurant in Drowntown. That was the name San Franciscans had given to the area of downtown that flooded when the tide was high, a result of rising sea levels. It was low tide that evening. The streets were dry, but there was a whiff of salt and seaweed in the air.\nThe lead German researcher was Katrin, an earnest woman who asked\u2014politely but with a slightly baffled tone\u2014about the American politicians\u2019 continued stress on carbon emission targets. \u201cAll research has indicated that stopping emissions will not stop the change in climate,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cEven if we stopped today, the world\u2019s temperature will continue to increase for half a century. They do not seem to understand that.\u201d\n\u201cRearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a popular pastime in political circles. I\u2019m seen as the voice of doom and gloom because I recognize that the permafrost is melting at an increasing rate and that methane capture should be a top priority.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you are successfully capturing methane. What is your current capture rate?\u201d\nWe drank beer and made calculations. Katrin estimated expenses on the back of a napkin as we worked out a plan for a pilot project involving methane cracking. During the Arctic summer, I could use solar power to crack the methane, and then cool and compress the hydrogen gas. I hoped to find a manufacturer to process the carbon into more carpet. Katrin had some ideas there\u2014and some excellent contacts in the German manufacturing community.\n\u201cI understand that NSF regulations require you to purchase your materials in the US,\u201d she said.\nI waved a hand, dismissing the problem. \u201cI have private funding as well,\u201d I explained. The presence of the muskoxen had been an enormous help in crowdfunding efforts. Charismatic megafauna has its uses.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I think I can assist you.\u201d\nThat was the first stop in a long winter of hunting and gathering. So many technical problems to solve, with little time and not enough money.\nThe hive mind found me a way to store the hydrogen that my pilot project would produce: a decommissioned tank from NASA, originally built to contain liquid hydrogen fuel for the space shuttle. It had never been used. For decades, it had been stored at NASA\u2019s New Orleans manufacturing facility on the far eastern edge of New Orleans\u2014still above water, but just barely. The facility was being decommissioned\u2014the last hurricane had come close to wiping it out\u2014and they were happy to find a home for the fuel tank.\nI set up a relationship with a German manufacturing plant that would make some of my pure carbon into fart catcher carpet and methane hydrate storage. I\u2019d compensate them for their service with the rest of the carbon, which they could use or sell for a fat profit.\nThe rest of my time was spent retrofitting the hydrogen fuel tank for my needs and arranging for transport. Everywhere I went, I could see the effects of the changing climate. But people were doing what people always do\u2014complaining about the weather and adapting to it where they could. Many politicians still doubted that change was underway even as some religious leaders were preaching about the end times.\nI was happy to return to the Arctic for another summer of work. The carpet from the previous year was functioning beautifully. Arctic grasses and other plants were growing through the loose weave of the mat, making it a part of the landscape. Trampling by the muskoxen had smoothed out the cursed tussocks and laying the next section of carpet was considerably easier than the first section had been.\nOf course, there were problems. On top of the usual sleet storms and blizzards, we had to be alert to changes caused by warmer temperatures. Whenever we were outside the station, we were armed against starving polar bears that thought Arctic researchers might substitute for their usual diet of walrus and seal. We almost lost part of the carpet-laying crew when a sinkhole opened up in the area where we were working. Fortunately, the fart catcher carpet was strong enough to act as a safety net. It supported us and let us climb back up out of the hole.\nI won\u2019t pretend there weren\u2019t difficulties with the hydrogen tank (delivered a month late) and the pilot methane cracker. But we got it all working eventually.\nI also expanded the research station\u2019s greenhouse, something that I\u2019d discussed with Oki and kitchen crew the summer before. The original greenhouse was quite small\u2014just big enough to grow a few vegetables. But with the hydrogen I was producing, I had energy to burn\u2014so to speak. In my scavenging at the NASA manufacturing facility in New Orleans, I had run across a prototype greenhouse designed for Mars. The warehouse supervisor gave me a great deal on it. He said it would be abandoned within the month along with anything else left in the facility.\nI set the Martian greenhouse up as an extension of the existing greenhouse. A hydrogen-powered heater allowed me to warm the air with no impact on the station energy budget and a cushion of carbon nanotubes insulated the permafrost from the greenhouse and collected the methane that outgassed.\nDown in the lower forty-eight, things were getting worse faster than anyone had expected. Changes in polar temperatures had caused perturbations in the polar jet stream that wreaked havoc with global weather patterns. There was drought and wildfire in the western US, severe flooding in the South, historic blizzards along the eastern seaboard, and tornadoes where tornadoes had never been before.\nBy the end of the summer, I had quadrupled the land covered with fart catcher and I\u2019d made plans to cover ten times that area in the following year. The research teams in Siberia, Greenland, Canada, and Norway were also having success.\nThat winter, my efforts focused on acquiring hydrogen transport and figuring out how to roll out more carpet with the same crew.\nWell, not exactly the same crew. I had been in touch with a robotics team that worked in an abandoned warehouse in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\nThey called themselves the Ant Factory, a non-profit collective of entrepreneurial engineers. Well . . . some of them were engineers. Some of them were artists. All of them were scavengers, retrofitters, people who knew how to make do, people who simultaneously thought in the long term and the short term. My kind of people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re old school,\u201d the head engineer told me. At least, he seemed to be in charge. His name was Renaldo and he had a seemingly infinite supply of black T-shirts emblazoned with cryptic sayings. My favorite read \u2018Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control.\u2019\nRenaldo claimed that was the best approach to projects like mine. \u201cYou know how the US space program works,\u201d he said. \u201cThey triple check everything and build safeguards into their safeguards and redundancies onto their redundancies. We\u2019re the opposite of that.\u201d\nIn the warehouse parking lot, the Ant Factory had created an obstacle course where they held robot trials. Some parts of the course were constant\u2014broken pavement, loose rocks, a pile of sand that could bury a bot in an avalanche. Other parts changed every day\u2014the team was constantly adding booby traps and barriers. A slick of ice, a small mountain of melting snow, a sticky patch of some sort of goo\u2014I thought it might be something toxic, but it turned out to be molasses.\nThe Ant Factory built me a robot that could traverse the course while rolling out fart catcher carpet. Actually, they built me a hundred robots\u2014Renaldo called them \u201cpequeninos peidos\u201d\u2014Little Farts. With a hundred robots, he said, it wouldn\u2019t matter if a few of them failed. \u201cPower in numbers,\u201d he said.\nPowered by hydrogen fuel cells, designed for rough terrain\u2014originally the Little Farts were agribots designed to roll over just about any lump, bump, or tussock.\nOn my last night at the Ant Factory, I sat on the old loading dock and watched a dozen Little Farts navigate the course, towing and unrolling a large carpet that Renaldo assured me was heavier than the fart catcher. The team was celebrating. I had sprung for pizza and beer\u2014a pilsner from a local brewery called Drown Your Sorrows. The label showed an ocean wave washing down Sao Paulo\u2019s main street.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can thank you for all this\u201d I told Renaldo as we watched one bot climb the slush mountain, trailing black carbon fibers. I wasn\u2019t paying the Ant Factory much. I\u2019d almost exhausted my crowdsourced funding.\nHe sipped his beer, surveying the rubble-filled yard. \u201cYou know those Hollywood movies where a few people save the world. We\u2019re those people. We\u2019ll make a difference.\u201d\nI nodded.\nRenaldo knew someone who knew Katrin, so he already knew about my success with methane cracking. \u201cWhat are you doing with the hydrogen you\u2019re producing?\u201d he asked me. \u201cI have a friend who would be happy to purchase it.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically, I can\u2019t actually sell the products of my work,\u201d I told him. \u201cThat\u2019s against NSF regulations.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cI understand. I am confident my friend would accept any hydrogen you chose to give him. He would offer goods and services in exchange.\u201d\n\u201cThat could work. Of course, there is the problem of transportation.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem. My friend Hehu lives in the Raft. He can take care of transportation.\u201d\nThe Raft was a seasteading community, a loose affiliation of over a hundred vessels that had been converted to floating farms and cities by climate refugees from small island nations that had been wiped out by rising waters.\n\u201cLet me contact him on your behalf.\u201d\nI returned to the Arctic with Renaldo\u2019s bots. Jackson didn\u2019t ask questions about where I got them. He and I had developed a fine working relationship. He was glad that I needed a smaller work crew. The muskoxen were spooked by the bots at first, but they got used to them.\nRenaldo\u2019s friend Hehu came through. He reached the research station with two ships\u2014a former Arctic cruise ship, now modified as a floating farm and residence for a few dozen people, and a former navy ship, now modified for hydrogen transport.\nHehu was from Woleai Atoll, the first island group to be swamped by the rising sea. I liked his team of engineers\u2014the head of the group was from JPL and he knew one of the aerospace engineers who had calculated the satellite orbits for me. He had, like me, gone rogue, and we had a fine time discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the confines of the university.\nIt was a fabulous summer. There were the usual problems with sinkholes and sleet storms and polar bears, but the robots worked well and I successfully expanded the area covered with the fart catcher to about twenty square miles. As autumn approached, it was all going very well. Until it all went very wrong.\nI should have paid more attention to the news. While I\u2019d been setting up partnerships and laying carpet and dodging polar bears, there had been a presidential election, a major change in congress, and a shift in national priorities. Hurricanes had wiped out New Orleans and a few other southern cities. Storm-driven waves were eroding beach bluffs and flooding US cities. Funding was being diverted to disaster relief. Franklin Station would shut down at the end of the season.\nAnd somehow my work had come to the attention of new political appointees in charge of climate research. They were upset by my dealings with Renaldo and the Germans and Hehu and . . . oh, just about everybody who had been helping me out. Some of my partners were apparently on terrorist watch lists.\nAt least, that was one story. Some of my friends suggested that the concern about terrorism was a cover. What had really pissed people off was the success of my methane cracking\u2014steel manufacturers did not like the possibilities offered by cheap availability of pure carbon.\nWhatever the cause, I was in trouble. Jackson told me that navy personnel who came to close down the station would be taking me into custody and charging me with a list of offenses including theft of government property and conspiracy to provide material support for terrorism. Jackson had been ordered to confine me to the station.\nThe day before the Navy ship was due to arrive, I left. At my request, Oki had packed a box of supplies\u2014including all of the fresh carrots that were left in the greenhouse. Before hugging me goodbye, he quizzed me on my equipment. He listened carefully to a long list: silk long johns, qiviut underwear, a layer of wool, windproof coat and pants, parka, bunny boots, hat, hood, air filter to warm the air before it entered my lungs, rifle for the polar bears, a pop-up shelter, and on and on.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said at last. \u201cStay warm, stay dry. Don\u2019t get dehydrated and eat as many calories as you can stuff in your face\u2014and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He hugged me goodbye.\nIt was a sunny day with a light wind. Two Little Farts accompanied me, dragging my gear on an improvised sled made of a plastic pallet I had found on the beach among the driftwood. In addition to the food and gear I had listed for Oki, I had a fiberglass kayak that had been left in the station\u2019s storage by a seal researcher.\nI took no satellite phone, no GPS, no electronics that might be used to find me. Such a strange feeling, leaving all that behind.\nThe muskoxen followed me\u2014not out of affection, but in return for carrots that I dropped along the way. Their hooves completely obliterated my tracks and the marks left by my improvised sled and the Little Farts.\nThe hike to the shore was about a mile. When I reached the shore, I reset the Little Farts to return to the station. The muskoxen followed them, hoping for more carrots.\nI abandoned the plastic pallet on the beach where I had found it, loaded the kayak, slid it into the water, and headed west for a place I knew.\nA few years back, I had decided to retrace the steps of my favorite Arctic explorer, Ernest de Koven Leffingwell, a guy who never got a lot of press. Everyone paid attention to Peary and Amundsen and Scott. Big voyages, big funding. Leffingwell never had much funding and didn\u2019t give a damn about reaching the North Pole.\nHe came up here in 1901 and fell in love with the Arctic. He spent nine summers and six winters up here, traveling around, making observations, keeping meticulous records. No fancy equipment\u2014he had Inuit guides; he used dog sleds and small boats. He made the first map of the coastline worth looking at. He was the first person to explain ice wedges and the very first to pay any attention to the permafrost.\nA few years back, I spent the better part of a summer retracing his journeys in this area. On that trip, I spent a week in an old prospector\u2019s house where Leffingwell had wintered. Half sod-hut, half log cabin, it was still in pretty good shape. Good shelter, well-concealed, near the coast, and so obscure that only a dedicated permafrost researcher would know about it.\nThe wind was with me, but even so it was a long paddle down the coast to the small inlet where the cabin was located. I beached the kayak and dragged it and all my gear into the cabin. The wind had picked up and I knew it would erase my tracks.\nInside, out of the wind, I made myself at home and waited for the search to come and go. It was a long wait. When weather was calm, I could hear the search helicopters from miles away\u2014the distinctive whup, whup, whup of their rotors warned me to take cover so searchers couldn\u2019t spot me.\nWhen the wind was blowing, the helicopters didn\u2019t fly. Then I would listen to the wind. Sometimes a gust would make the hut shudder so the boards creaked and groaned. More often a steady wind would make the walls vibrate, so I felt like I was shivering even when I wasn\u2019t. The wind had been trying to tear the hut down for more than a hundred years.\nIn the first week, a bear found my hiding place, but I had my rifle. Bear meat, while not fine dining, is a good source of protein.\nThe nights grew longer and longer until the sun never rose. When the sun was just below the horizon, it wasn\u2019t completely dark. It was like that time right after the sun sets, when the sky is the deepest possible blue. Imagine that deep blue moment stretching on and on. The blue light colored the entire world, reflecting from the snow and the water. I felt like I was swimming in the sky.\nFor me, that was the important moment. Not the brilliant golden flash of the lake\u2019s explosion, but rather the cool, blue, liminal light where nothing seemed real and I was not sure what would become of the world.\nI had to wait a long time for the searchers to give up and leave, but eventually I stopped hearing helicopters. I returned to the station for the winter, a long paddle followed by a long walk over the pack ice. It was so cold that I could feel the mucus freeze in my nose when I took a breath without my air filter on. The very act of breathing put me at risk of dehydration\u2014since every bit of water vapor froze instantly, the air was bone dry.\nThe station had been stripped down, but my friends had left behind everything I needed. There was a stash of canned food in the kitchen. The hydrogen-powered generator in the greenhouse was still there.\nThe winter was cold and long and lonely. I grew potatoes under improvised grow-lights. I set up a still and perfected the finest hooch ever made in the Arctic Circle. Arctic Fire, I called it.\nSatellite communication had been shut down when they closed the station, but I rigged a ham radio. When the ionosphere cooperated, I could catch news broadcasts. The news was never good: heat waves, drought, hurricanes, flooding, famine, disease.\nI managed to contact a few friends and I told them I was all right. They told me that the Navy team had searched for me in all the safety huts and all known emergency shelters. They fixated on the largest of the sinkholes\u2014the one that almost swallowed my crew. They spotted some marks at the edge that could have been made by a rope and figured a sinkhole offered a great hiding place. Down there, there\u2019d be no wind, no bears.\nIt had taken their team a week to stage an expedition to the bottom to look for me. I\u2019m glad they all got in and out all right. Dangerous place, a methane sinkhole. Not somewhere I\u2019d like to spend a lot of time.\nCome spring, finding me was no longer a priority for the US government. The Arctic winter was summer in the Antarctic, and there had been some major developments down south. The Western Antarctic ice sheet, which scientists had thought would remain stable for several more decades, had started collapsing in a most spectacular fashion. The top layers of the sheet had been melting each summer, exposing long-buried crevasses. One of those crevasses broke through the bottom of the ice shelf, and an iceberg the size of Connecticut broke loose. A few weeks later, another one, just as big, broke free. Then another.\nThe icebergs were dramatic, but they weren\u2019t the real problem. The Western ice shelf held back the glaciers on the Antarctic continent. Without it, those glaciers would flow into the sea. All told, that could add 30 million cubic kilometers of water, give or take a few million, to the world\u2019s oceans. Faced with this threat, politicians were turning their attention to immediate construction projects to hold back the sea. A rogue scientist eating potatoes and polar bear meat in a closed research station was way down on anyone\u2019s list of concerns.\nWith the return of the spring, Hehu arrived with ships laden with fart catcher net, methane cracking equipment, and empty tanks to be filled with hydrogen. That was thirty years ago.\nNow we have the world as it is.\nI sit in Jackson\u2019s office. I still think of it as his, though he hasn\u2019t been here for thirty years. I use it as my office now.\nHehu sits in the chair on the other side of the desk. It\u2019s spring again and he has sailed north just as he has each spring for the last thirty years. But he hasn\u2019t come alone. Each spring, a fleet of ships comes north to spend the summer in the Beaufort Sea. It is a ragtag fleet of cruise ships and barges and freighters and navy ships, all repurposed for this new world, all laden with food and supplies for the station, all carrying folks eager to work on the annual methane harvest.\nSome ships are equipped with methane cracking facilities; others carry empty hydrogen tanks or empty holds. Each ship has its own unique community and culture\u2014some grow tanks of algae; others grow forests; some grow pot farms. Some are environmentally-based communities with overtones of Native American cultures; some are party boats with overtones of Burning-Man culture.\nThey call themselves the Sunseekers. I call them the summer people. The winter doesn\u2019t exist for them\u2014not really. It is always summer where they are.\nI pour Hehu a glass of my Arctic Fire. \u201cYou make the best hooch in the Arctic Circle,\u201d he says.\nI smile. I didn\u2019t make this hooch by myself. The station staff, all of them young and smart, do the hard work to keep the station running, monitoring the fart catcher, tending the muskoxen and reindeer, making high octane booze, and preparing for the Sunseeker fleet\u2019s arrival.\nWhen the ships arrive in the Arctic, there is a great celebration with much singing and dancing. They celebrate the summer methane harvest and they treat me like a hero.\nAll summer long, the Sunseeker ships crisscross the ice-free Arctic ocean, visiting fart-catcher projects in Norway, Greenland, Siberia, Canada. Each autumn, the ships take away tanks of hydrogen and holds filled with pure powdered carbon.\nThe Sunseekers are a cheerful lot. And why wouldn\u2019t they be? This is a fine new world, a utopian future, a happy ending. As the permafrost melts, they capture the methane. As the oceans rises, they build more ships.\nTo them, it seems so natural that half the world\u2019s remaining population lives in nomadic floating colonies. Most of them didn\u2019t know any of the people who died in droughts and floods, heat waves and blizzards. They didn\u2019t know all those who suffered disease and famine.\nJackson died of dengue fever when disease-carrying mosquitoes brought that disease to the American South, a shift made possible by warmer temperatures and increased rain. Katrin starved in the European famine\u2014caused by unseasonable snowstorms resulting from the slowing of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift, ocean currents that kept Europe warm. Renaldo drowned in a flood that wiped out Sao Paulo, the result of a monster storm. Just one extreme weather event among hundreds.\nThey all died. Billions of people died. Not millions\u2014billions. It took all those deaths to bring the world population down to a more sustainable level and let us reach this happy ending.\nThis isn\u2019t the way I thought it would work out when I set out to save the world. All those square-jawed heroes of the old science fiction stories had it wrong. You can\u2019t save the world as we know it. I did what I could, and I did some good in the world. But you can\u2019t save the world without changing it.\n\u201cA toast,\u201d Hehu said, lifting his glass. \u201cTo the future.\u201d\nI nodded and lifted my glass. \u201cTo the future. There\u2019s no stopping it.\u201d\nOriginally published in Bridging Infinity, edited by Jonathan Strahan.\nPat Murphy writes fiction that inhabits the borderland between genres, where life is interesting and the rules are slippery.

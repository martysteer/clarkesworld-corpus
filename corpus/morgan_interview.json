Morgan is the bestselling author of Altered Carbon (2002, 2006), Broken Angels (2003, 2007), Market Forces (2005), Woken Furies (2005, 2007), Black Man (UK) / Thirteen (US, 2007), and The Steel Remains (UK 2008). In 2008, Black Man received the Arthur C. Clarke Award for science fiction.\n Black Man/Thirteen explores the concept of \u201cvirilicide,\u201d a highly-speculative exploration of the idea that certain core aspects of masculinity are increasingly being defined out of modern culture. (Morgan\u2019s acknowledged a debt to feminist writers such as Susan Faludi on this point.) \u201cThirteens\u201d are genetically engineered and psychologically conditioned to be the purest alpha male imaginable, and as a result they\u2019re wholly intolerable in society. The Steel Remains, meanwhile, provides a stylish noir update to the standard fantasy swords-and-sorcery plot.\n In the wide-ranging conversation that follows, Morgan explains his perspective on heroism and masculinity, on the United States, and much else besides.\n Is there an ethical dimension to inserting noir elements into swords-&-sorcery?\n I suppose that that dynamic exists, but it\u2019s not so much a conscious one. I tend to write what I want to read, and I\u2019ve never wanted to read about kings and princes and great, glorious battles against a great evil, and definitely not about good-hearted farmboys who grow up to become warriors or wizards. Those kinds of narratives have never interested me. They\u2019ve never held me.\n The kind of fantasy that I\u2019ve always liked has been very grim and gloomy. It goes back to the Norse stuff. If you were to ask me for the definitive fantasy novel, I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s Poul Anderson\u2019s The Broken Sword, which is a 250-page novel published at the same time as the first of the Tolkien trilogy, way back in 1954. It\u2019s got everything in it that Tolkien doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s very similar in the sense that it\u2019s got elves and trolls and dwarves and the whole panoply of Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology that Tolkien borrows from. The point with Anderson is that he borrows this very gloomy Norse perception of what a hero is, what heroic deeds really involve, and what the ultimate price you pay is for such deeds. That was much more my thing.\n As I\u2019ve grown older, and matured as a person, one of the things that\u2019s increasingly come to the fore in the way that I think about things is the way violence is never actually a solution to anything. Yes, sometimes it happens, and sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable, sometimes it feels good even, but the truth of the matter is it\u2019s not a good thing. Any fantasy novel where there\u2019s this glory of trooping out there to fight against this great evil\u2014that immediately repels me; I\u2019m not interested in that. What I am interested in are the consequences of those battles. What happens afterwards? What about all the guys who come home from the wars scalded by dragon-spit and hacked and broken and screaming insane in some cases? What do you do with those guys, and what impact does that have on the society that\u2019s just fought this war?\n For me, there is a moral point I guess, but what The Steel Remains is saying is, for god\u2019s sake get a grip! Just because you\u2019re fighting with swords instead of machine guns doesn\u2019t make the war any more pleasant or acceptable as a way of doing business. That moral is in there, but it\u2019s not because I felt I needed to make some big point, it\u2019s just that\u2019s the way I think, and that\u2019s the kind of fiction I\u2019m interested in.\n I absolutely take your point about writing realistically about the consequences of violence, but is there a balancing act with the tendency of readers sometimes to just say . . . ohh, that\u2019s cool?\n The whole thing about \u201chey, isn\u2019t that cool\u201d: I understand that. I go through that myself! I just got back from seeing The Dark Knight, on an IMAX screen\u2014and that\u2019s a movie stuffed with moments where you go, \u201cohhh, that\u2019s cool!\u201d That\u2019s a dynamic that you have to take into account and that you have to accept, because it\u2019s within you as well as everyone else. I don\u2019t have this kind of superior vision complex that some writers seem to have.\n It\u2019s also the fact that there are these moments of extreme cool, and there\u2019s something very exhilarating and thrilling about violence. I\u2019ve talked with quite a few veterans of conflict, and one of the things that they will tell you, quite often, is how god-damned fucking thrilling it is to be there doing this shit. You can\u2019t afford to ignore that, any more than you can afford to ignore the consequences.\n One of the reasons men go to war is because, frankly, they like it. I\u2019m not going to write a book in which any time there\u2019s an act of violence it\u2019s written in such a way that you really don\u2019t enjoy it. What\u2019s much more productive is to give the audience their act of violence. You give them the excitement of the fight or whatever it may be, and with that also comes a kind of sickness. Because you\u2019ve got to face the facts that it might be astoundingly cool to stand off three guys with a sword, but at the same time there\u2019s going to be blood and broken bones, and a mess. You have to take all of that on board. You have to try to do justice to all aspects of it.\n In The Steel Remains, for instance, there are some cool moments, but inevitably there is the realization that what we\u2019re talking about here is chopping human beings into bits with sharpened steel. However cool that might be at the moment you\u2019re doing it, eventually you\u2019ve got to come back down to the realities of what you\u2019re doing, the flesh-and-blood truth of it.\n And you have to live with the fact that you enjoyed it, beyond just living with the mess.\n Always. I\u2019ve spoken to more than one Vietnam vet who has said that part of the difficulty of life after the war was not just remembering what you\u2019d done, but remembering how you\u2019d felt about what you\u2019d done. That can be hard to live with, because it\u2019s one thing to have done something horrible, and it\u2019s quite another to have done it and to feel at some level that you enjoyed doing it. That\u2019s a very scary thing.\n But, interestingly enough, again, I think one of the problems with the sickness, if you like, that we\u2019ve got in Western culture is that we\u2019re scared to acknowledge these things. We\u2019re afraid to actually take them on board. That idea\u2014that you sort of got a sick enjoyment out of killing\u2014is just not acceptable currency, because we\u2019re told we must see our soldiers in these glowing, honorable terms, rather than seeing them as human beings. One of the aspects of American policy having to do with military matters is that there\u2019s an enormous amount of emphasis on the troops, as long as they are standing up and holding their arms, but as soon as you ship them back home broken or damaged or unable to cope, suddenly no one wants to know about them anymore. The amount of coverage there hasn\u2019t been of all the post-traumatic stress, and the incidents of guys coming back from Iraq who just cannot cope with what\u2019s been done to them\u2014that stuff just isn\u2019t covered. The media has no taste for it. But we are talking about human beings, and human beings are complicated mechanisms, and when they get damaged, that\u2019s complicated, too.\n You have to wrap it all up in a package and deliver it so that hopefully I\u2019m providing a kind of cinematic thrill--not just in this book but in all the books I\u2019ve written--there\u2019s heroic stances and John Woo-style violence, but coming behind that is the whole point of, I\u2019m not going to justify this on some moral level, I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s ok to behave like this.\n That\u2019s really true\u2014not only if you read the Norse mythology, but in any of the epics, the heroes are not people you would have to tea.\n No, absolutely not! This has long been my contention with the whole superhero ethos. We kind of want to have our cake and eat it, because we want to have these guys doing heroic things, but at the end of the day we also want them to be able to go home, marry Mary next door, and get a house with a picket fence and a dog. You can\u2019t do that. There\u2019s a big compatibility issue there.\n Men who excel at violence, especially violence on the battlefield, those will be the kind of guys who find it hard to give up, and they\u2019re going to be the kind of guys who just won\u2019t deal well with a society that doesn\u2019t need a high level of violence in it.\n The constant issue is, what do you do with your heroes when you\u2019re finished with them? Norse mythology (and also the Greeks, I think) had a very clear sense of what you do with them: The heroes always have to die. The standard pattern for a heroic profile is that you fight in your great battle, and you succeed, and then shortly thereafter you go off to another battle, or very often to another land, and there you are betrayed or you die or you disappear from knowing and it\u2019s assumed that you\u2019ve died. In each case, the hero is off-loaded. Those guys don\u2019t stick around\u2014you don\u2019t keep them.\n I think that was a wisdom that a lot of medieval and more ancient societies had\u2014I think they were a lot more sophisticated in their vision of violence than we sometimes give them credit for. Because we\u2019ve developed a popular culture of wanting to give people everything\u2014we want to give them the thrills, but we don\u2019t want them to be upset\u2014we\u2019re neglecting that vision. Achilles is the case in point: He\u2019s just this sulky bastard who would kill you as soon as look at you. Very handy to have on your side when you\u2019re going up against the massed armies of Troy, but not so handy to have around when you\u2019re having a dispute about a slave girl. That\u2019s all written into the Iliad: Achilles won\u2019t fight because he\u2019s in his tent sulking about a slave girl.\n There\u2019s a truth to it, and I find it exasperating on a personal level, but also a little bit worrying on a cultural level, that we just don\u2019t seem to be able to digest that. We seem very uncomfortable with it.\n This is obviously a main concern in Thirteen as well with the whole idea of virilicide, and the need for the Thirteen figure.\n I think Nietzche was drawing on the wisdom of more ancient societies, when he said in times of peace the warlike man destroys himself. You see this increasingly. We live in times when violence ceases to be a viable option, both at a personal level and a group, a corporate, or a national level. You get things done far better by trading with someone than you do by trying to invade them. Within that context, what you\u2019re seeing is an awful lot of men, especially ill-educated, not-very-well-off young men, who are looking for that function. Since it no longer exists in the form of military service, they\u2019re looking for it in some other way. Increasingly, these guys either kill themselves doing stupid things, or they take excessive amounts of drugs. Basically, it\u2019s the whole risk thing\u2014young males seem to have a high appetite for it. I already see that as a problem, as a dysfunction.\n To me, the whole idea of virilicide is that, as we continue to develop societies in which violence is just not an option anymore, these guys aren\u2019t going to go away. The tendency isn\u2019t going to go away, so what will these people do? They\u2019ll turn on each other, and on themselves. If it\u2019s not conditioned very thoroughly out of them at a very early age, the societies that don\u2019t will rip themselves apart.\n That\u2019s a feminist argument, and one of the interesting things is, once you\u2019ve done a bit of feminist reading, it gives you a prism through which to view things. Once you start to view things through that prism, you then never stop. You say, why is no one commenting on this?\n Thirteen just sort of picks that up and runs with it. Genetically, young men are designed to not live very long, and to throw their weight around long enough to get a chance to impregnate some females, and then fade and die sometime before they hit thirty. That\u2019s what they\u2019re set up for at a genetic level, and if you don\u2019t find a cultural way to deal with that, then they will tear themselves apart anyway, and they will tear you apart if you\u2019re in the way. That was really the vision of it. All these societies in Thirteen have had to make a choice. They\u2019ve had to decide, \u201cright, we\u2019re not going down this warrior path any longer, we\u2019re going to accept that society\u2019s a complicated thing and we\u2019re going to deal in a complicated fashion with it, the issues are complex and so are the solutions.\u201d The places that have refused to do that are the ones that then suffer horrifically from the things they impose on themselves.\n You get JesusLand, actually.\n I have to say that I\u2019ve had quite a lot of e-mails from people about this. I\u2019ve had e-mails from people who live there and who said, \u201coh, man, you\u2019re so right.\u201d But I\u2019ve had an awful lot of people get in touch, mostly very polite, but really hurt and defensive. They say, \u201cyou\u2019ve got us all wrong\u2014we\u2019re not a bunch of racist, lynching psychopaths.\u201d\n Usually with those guys I\u2019ll try to explain somewhat more clearly what I was after, since I believe novel writing should be an act of communication.\n First of all, I generally say, I know. I have spent time in various parts of the United States, probably including where you live, and the Americans I\u2019ve met there . . . they\u2019re lovely people. They\u2019re courteous, they\u2019re friendly, they\u2019re generous with their time and resources. In fact, they\u2019re a lot like Americans in the rest of the country. But that is really not the issue. I\u2019ve also spent time in various North African and Middle Eastern nations and found the inhabitants there to be courteous, engaging and hospitable to a fault - but if I\u2019d created a theocratic state in North Africa, would you have been angry about that?\n Jesusland is not an indictment of all the 200+ million Americans living in its territory, it\u2019s a portrayal of certain ruinous socio-dynamic tendencies common to that region running amok, and the catastrophic impact they have had (that I believe, in fact, they are having even now) on America\u2019s very great potential as a modern nation.\n The only Jesuslander we get very close to is, ok, a little on the bad guy side, in a purely narrative sense\u2014but he\u2019s hard-working, loyal, courageous, honourable, sensitive, and he\u2019s great in bed. Can\u2019t say fairer than that, can you? Sure, he\u2019s also fucked up by old-time religion and overpumped naive patriotism, but he\u2019s not supposed to be the bad guy\u2014he\u2019s just someone who\u2019s been stitched up. Scott ends up getting used and killed as a result of the way this narrow indoctrination has worked, but that\u2019s portrayed (I hope) as a tragedy - to some extent, in fact, it\u2019s the whole tragedy of lost American potential in microcosm.\n Quite often people read the book and assumed that I share the main characters\u2019 view of Jesusland, which is intensely critical. But it\u2019s important, as in all my fiction, to dissociate the opinions and attitudes of the characters from the opinions and attitudes of the author. Tom Norton and Sevgi Ertekin are contemptuous (and frightened) of Jesusland because they too have their own prejudices and fears to contend with. Sevgi in particular, as a first generation American immigrant and an identifiable ethnic minority, bitches about diehard confederate agendas because quite frankly the Deep South terrifies her. This is also is an observed reality; for Ertekin\u2019s character, I borrowed quite heavily from one or two New Yorkers I know who have a similar (if perhaps not quite as extreme) mistrust and fear of the southern fundamentalist tendency and, by association, the places it comes from. The very sad truth about bigotry is that it begets more bigotry in reaction. There is a whole sub-set of Americans who are very tired of being caricatured and despised as \u201clatte-drinking elites\u201d or godless queer-loving liberals, and their reaction, increasingly, is to step away from the places which emanate this intolerance. So Sevgi, for all she is the closest thing to a \u201chero\u201d we have, is flawed and angry, just like the other characters in the book, Marsalis most definitely included. I don\u2019t do white hats and black hats, good guys and bad. All the characters in Thirteen are flawed, all are damaged, none are safe as moral guides to the terrain.\n Thirteen is not a dance on the grave of middle America or the south, it\u2019s a howling lament for what is being done to your nation by willful ignorance and ruthless vested interests, and for all that could be lost.\n Sure, although it must have been deliberately provocative to make Carl Marsalis the walking embodiment of Jesusland fears and anxieties. The sexually incredibly desirable . . .\n Yes, yes, I had another e-mail very recently, last week, who I couldn\u2019t get back, I couldn\u2019t connect. I sent him my basic screed\u2014what I\u2019ve just said\u2014and he wrote back to say he could see I\u2019ve thought about this, and that he enjoyed various parts of the book, but really, wasn\u2019t I pushing it a bit much: Carl Marsalis, the black superstud, and the white lady cop who can\u2019t resist him?\n I wrote him back and said, I fear you\u2019re mistaken here: Sevgi Ertekin is not white! She\u2019s Turkish American, with a stated admixture of Arab blood (the rest probably coming with her Turkic roots from somewhere out on the Central Asian steppes or Mongolia). She\u2019s not a \u201cwhite woman\u201d in the way that racist fantasy implies. There is no intent to make some race-based political point in the portrayal of the relationship between Marsalis and Ertekin - thought the fact you detected one does make me think America\u2019s problem with race is embedded to a genuinely frightening depth.\n Actually, though, it comes up in the book in other ways\u2014I wasn\u2019t worried about the interracial relationship with Sevgi, but, for example, you do talk in the book about how other males get kind of prickly around Carl, because there\u2019s this recognition that he might be taking his place in the pecking order.\n The idea is that he represents\u2014both genetically and because of the training he\u2019s gone through\u2014he\u2019s fundamentally going to provoke an automatic reaction from other males because they are going to see him as a threat. The book was not originally called Black Man in Britain, either, it was originally going to be called Normal Parameters. And I made Carl black\u2014it was a thicket of choices. One of them was that I\u2019d written a novel years ago where the central character was called Marsalis, and I\u2019d always wanted to use the name. This was as good a time as any, and so I based Carl Marsalis loosely, physically, on the other Marsalis from this novel I wrote twenty years ago, nearly.\n It was also partly the sense that if you look at the recruiting numbers in the US military, you get an enormous number of young black men going into the military, because they\u2019re coming from a poor background, and so this looks like the best bet. That\u2019s not race-based, either. It\u2019s like the Steve Earle song [\u201cCopperhead Road\u201d]\u2014\u201cthey draft the white trash first around here anyway.\u201d The sense that America\u2019s wars are fought by these people from the poorest and most deprived of its cultural background.\n There\u2019s also the idea that any kind of genetic experimentation would find its easiest seeds in deprived populations. There\u2019s this implication that the elites in Thirteen go to poor black women for their genetic material. All of this threw itself together, and somewhere in that is the idea that America definitely still seems to have this problem with the big black bogeyman.\n Tom Norton doesn\u2019t like Carl because he scares him, but his skin tone isn\u2019t the issue, he scares him because of who he is. And I\u2019ve met guys like this, guys who have been in British Special Forces. There is something to them. I don\u2019t feel threatened by them, but that\u2019s just because I\u2019m pretty in touch with my feminine side and don\u2019t kid myself about my masculinity, if you like. One my most interesting correspondents, a captain in the American military told me is that in America, we have a real problem because males who don\u2019t do military service have a real issue with soldiers and ex-soldiers. They react badly to them, they prickle around them. The only exception is guys who have a strong social mission like priests or teachers. I said at the time, could it not be that the kind of men who become priests or teachers are probably the kind of men who aren\u2019t into that whole headbutting business of fighting it out for dominance of the herd. If you choose to become a teacher, which is a tough job, with poor rewards, or if you choose to become a priest, it seems likely that the things that drive you are not the things that drive the average male.\n Males are competitive, and if you wheel in a man who\u2019s very good-looking, very magnetic, very strong, very tough, most other males are not going to have a good word to say about him. And nor would I!\n Do you remember in Bloom County when Opus is going out with Lola Granola, and her ex shows up? Bart Savagewood, I think he\u2019s called. He\u2019s a test pilot for the US Navy, with a 3-inch waist and a 96-inch set of shoulders. Opus is introduced to him, and just hates him on sight, because he can\u2019t compete . . . [laughter]\n It\u2019s another of those truths that no one wants to address, and especially in politically correct terms, we don\u2019t like to think that we react badly when our masculinity is threatened, because we don\u2019t like to think that we still have that trait or competitive display in us. But the trick is that you accept it, and you laugh at it, and then you have a handle on it.\n I have to confess that I\u2019ve taken a certain amount of flak for being anti-American, which is harsh. I\u2019m a big fan of America both in general political terms and in terms of the culture. I really like it there. The books I read, the music I listen to\u2014what isn\u2019t American is heavily, heavily influenced by it. But what constantly perplexes me about American culture generally is the depth to which the race thing is buried, and how unbelievably charged it is.\n There\u2019s racism everywhere. I mean, we\u2019ve got plenty of it here in Britain, and go to Europe and you\u2019ll find it there, as well. It\u2019s not like it doesn\u2019t exist on this side of the Atlantic. But the levels to which it\u2019s buried in the American consciousness are really frightening\u2014such as the rapidity with which some readers leapt to the idea that Sevgi is white because A) she\u2019s the protagonist and b) not African-American, and so, by definition, since she\u2019s white, and he\u2019s an African-American\u2014that can\u2019t be good.\n Sometimes you talk about this issue in genetic\u2014and thus quasi-racial or sexed\u2014terms, but you also raise important environmental factors as well. It\u2019s really not clear the extent to which this competitiveness is hardwired after all, even for the thirteens.\n That\u2019s right: The idea is that the accepted stance of 2107 is that this is down to genetics, but then you\u2019re given insight into the way they were trained and conditioned from an early age, and you think, bloody hell! If I\u2019d been put through this from the day I was born, I\u2019d be pretty psychotic as well. And right at the end, Sevgi\u2019s father says if it\u2019s true that this is written into your genes so deeply, why did they bother to train you the way they did? They didn\u2019t trust you to turn out the way they wanted, so they made damn sure of it.\n What I was trying to do there was to flip-flop the way things are now, which is that there is an underlying assumption that genes don\u2019t determine anything, it\u2019s all conditioning and environment. We\u2019re still living with the heritage of the lurch to the left in the social sciences over the past sixty years, and so there\u2019s an assumption it\u2019s all about environment. And underlying that there\u2019s a little bit of evidence and there are a few people saying, hang on a minute, maybe this is about the genes. So I wanted to flip it: everyone\u2019s going to assume it\u2019s about the genes, but underlying that would be some people saying, wait, what about environmental factors?\n The truth as far as I can see it is that it\u2019s always going to be about an interaction between the two. You\u2019re not made by your genes, but your genes will give you the predispositions, and the environment will then tick them off one way or the other.\n But the book is speculative in the pure sense of the word. If pressed by someone who said, look, you wrote it, is it about the genes? I would say, well, I don\u2019t know. My personal sense of it is, I\u2019ve read a lot of Steven Pinker, and I think he makes an awful lot of sense. And generally speaking, when I\u2019m reading science, if it\u2019s bad news, then I tend to think they\u2019re probably right. The universe is not a nice place, and we\u2019ve survived in it as a species which means we\u2019re probably not very nice in many ways either.\n However, I tend to think that if the explanation is simple, it\u2019s probably wrong. So this is never going to be a simple case of, yes, it\u2019s these genes that do this. It\u2019s going to be a question of, do these genes get expressed or not? How is it influenced by diet? What happens if the woman who gives birth to this child has previously given birth to this child? All this stuff comes into play, and it\u2019s never going to be straightforward. But I do think we\u2019re going to have to wake up, and shed our old-style leftist pretensions, and take a hard look at what human beings actually are.\n This may seem like an odd connection, but one thing that\u2019s striking about the difference between the world of Thirteen and the Takeshi Kovacs world is the strong sense of embodiment, and living with the body that you have.\n The Kovacs books were enormously fun to write, and I had a lot of fun playing with that concept. (It\u2019s not my concept, I borrowed/stole it from many other practioners over the years. I think the first person I can give an official credit to is Robert Scheckley, whose Immortality, Inc was written in 1958 or something. ) It does let you off the hook in terms of consequences. I made a fist of showing that eliminating death doesn\u2019t solve your problems; in many ways it just gives you more. But there\u2019s always the thing that you can get out of this body. And that, regardless of how easy or difficult it is, does change the game. And the point with Thirteen was, I wanted a situation where you were locked into your physicality, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. A point I tried to leave lying around for those who wanted to find it is that Marsalis has more in common with ordinary humans than either humans or he have with the coming generation in 2107, because those guys were going to have gene platforms that can be switched on or off more or less at well, and you can take a chemical and cure a tendency more or less for a generation or so, and you can choose not to have a tendency your parents gave you expressed. And that\u2019s something ordinary humans don\u2019t get to do, nor does Marsalis. He\u2019s locked in to what he is.\n One last question: One of the things that I\u2019ve always noted in your books\u2014right from the beginning of Altered Carbon, and I\u2019ve got dozens of these marked across all of them\u2014is the way you write about mirrors. You write about them a lot\u2014characters are always seeing themselves in them . . . What\u2019s interesting about mirrors?\n I think the essence of noir\u2014I think this is something I borrowed wholesale, and not really consciously, so I\u2019m making this up on the fly\u2014is that it\u2019s quite introspective. That\u2019s one of the joys of it. It can be really violent and headlong narrative, but always at the heart of a genuine noir narrative, you have this issue of where is the evil really coming from? Most noir heroes tend to be pretty self-loathing. Again, I think that\u2019s a wisdom that the noir genre has and has kind of stumbled on in some sense. Especially if you\u2019re male, and maybe female but I don\u2019t know because I\u2019m not female, but if you are male and have the slightest bit of self-knowledge or honest intellectual sensitivity, sometimes you\u2019re going to be in the position of that Turkish guy who says, \u201csometimes it shames me to be male.\u201d That\u2019s an extreme way of expressing it, but if you\u2019re paying attention at all you become aware very early on that males are pretty second-rate when it comes to social mores. Behaving well, if you like. They may make worse parents, they\u2019re not as reliable. We score low on all the stuff that nowadays we would say makes good citizens. Now, that\u2019s a huge generalization, but, in general terms I think that we males are not set up for citizenship in the same way that females are, and that\u2019s something that comes up in the book.\n Noir writers detected that, maybe without even consciously realizing it, and so you have this very strong male protagonist in most noir fiction, but he\u2019s keenly aware of his own thuggishness, if you like. He\u2019s keenly aware that it\u2019s not like he\u2019s the white knight and the stuff out there is dark and evil. He\u2019s aware that this is in all of us. And so I suspect that mirroring happens a lot in noir because it\u2019s a genre that\u2019s concerned with what\u2019s inside, as well as what\u2019s outside. In noir plots the assumption tends to be that the system is corrupt: what appear to be the bad guys might be the bad guys, but what appear to be the good guys might be bad guys, as well. There\u2019s a sense that things are rotten, and that this is the human condition.\n I think I borrowed all of that. I just carted the whole lot out of the shop without looking at it too closely. I suspect that somewhere woven into that is the idea of the protagonist taking a long hard look at himself, and having to acknowledge what\u2019s in the mirror.\n One of the things I\u2019ve been really delighted about over the years is the number of female readers that I\u2019ve got. I was told, especially when I was writing Altered Carbon, even before it was published, most people who read it and liked it said, it\u2019s such a boy\u2019s book. And I keep getting reviews like this. One of the British reviewers for Black Man, for Thirteen said something similar\u2014this is Andy McNab on steroids, this is riproaring Boy\u2019s Own Adventure and stuff like that. But the truth is I\u2019ve got a huge number of female readers, and I\u2019m delighted by that, because I would hate to think I\u2019m only talking to the male sex. I would hesitantly lay that at the door of this introspection. If you\u2019ve got a hero who just thugs his way through the story, he\u2019s utterly convinced of his rightness, and he wins the day\u2014I think a lot of women aren\u2019t interested in that. Whereas if you\u2019ve got a guy who thugs his way through the story, but is constantly conflicted, and is aware that there\u2019s something wrong with him\u2014I think the female sex is far better at understanding that kind of introspection. Maybe that\u2019s what works for them. It\u2019s funny because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had\u2014I have had a few complaints about the violence, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a woman complain about the violence. It seems to me that women will wear an enormous amount of violence and unpleasantness in their fiction, provided that something else is there as well. And where it doesn\u2019t seem to work for women is when all you\u2019ve got is that violence. This is why mainstream comics tend to be dominated by male readers, because they tend to flush away everything except that gleaming edge of violent capacity. It\u2019s very hard to get interested in characters like that. The female readership (and there is one in comics, as well) is scraping around looking for the sophisticated interpretation, the angle or sense that there\u2019s more than meets the eye, that inside these characters there\u2019s something going on. And increasingly, of course, it\u2019s women who buy books rather than men. So I\u2019m very glad that I appeal to a female readership too, and not least because I genuinely believe that, without wishing to condemn any individual male anywhere, as a species, males very much are the problem. Say I had a child a one-year-old son or something, and I was dying. Given the choice between giving it to a male to rear and giving it to a female to rear, and this is a blind choice, with no other parameters or information to work from, I will give it to the woman every single time, and I think most courts, both in America and in Britain work off a similar assumption: Generally women will be better at bringing up children. The reason they\u2019re better is that women are less likely to cave the kid\u2019s skull in if he screams! It\u2019s caveman stuff, but unfortunately it is what we carry within us. I think the sooner we acknowledge that, the sooner we can get on with running the world far better than we do at the moment.\n And pretending we don\u2019t feel like that only makes it worse . . .\n Exactly! It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s insane. We\u2019ve nailed ourselves to these ludicrous images of who we\u2019re supposed to be, who we think we are, and they\u2019re impossible to live up to both for men and women. Women are nailed to this thing of having to be the whore in the bedroom, the cook in the kitchen, and the perfectly demure and presentable housewife everywhere else. This is the whole maid/mother/crone thing. But also males are nailed to this ludicrous vision of implacable strength, where you can\u2019t be weak, and can\u2019t show weakness. They\u2019re such counterproductive stereotypes, because there\u2019s no way anyone could live up to them. And if you did live up to them, it would destroy you. That\u2019s a theme I think running through a lot of my work: If you really do live up to the male archetype, then you\u2019re dead in an alley somewhere, because it will destroy you. Even if it doesn\u2019t kill you physically, it will destroy you from within. Leaving aside actual functioning genetic psychopaths, I think if you look at most men who have survived a lot of physical violence, it does something to them\n We\u2019ve come full circle, haven\u2019t we, to the untold cost of heroic deeds. This is what happens to you if you stick to that ridiculous image of manhood. It will wipe you out. And the same holds true for women who try to live up images of femininity. I\u2019m a big fan of bringing everything out warts and all\u2014let\u2019s really have a look at this. That said, you\u2019ve also got to tell an entertaining story, and there\u2019s a balance to be struck there, obviously."}

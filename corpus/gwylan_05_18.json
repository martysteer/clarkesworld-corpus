I remember the scent of it from childhood, sweet and brisk and metallic like new grasses crushed together with aniseed. Dawn smells better than the inside of this dead soldier\u2019s sleepbag, yet I\u2019d choose to bury my nose and aching belly and aching mind until full light if I dared.\nBut Pir would come and drag me out, and take angry pleasure in it. I do my best to avoid his attentions.\nI wriggle out of the bag, my clothes twisted and clammy, and shiver when the air takes my warmth. The sore on my neck chafes where my sweater rubs. I pull up the neckband of my city woman\u2019s blouse\u2014filthy, but softer than wool\u2014to ease it. Around us the night mist still drifts. Young Koben seems on watch in a sea of unshaped ghosts.\nBetter this miserable dawning than the daylight apparitions of Oslyge, nightmares with booming voices that prowled the city\u2019s streets: vargar and snake-armed women out of old tales; immense children-of-Fion, the skittering, many-legged crawlers a thousand times natural size. All of them shadowless, yet seeming flesh-solid in the afternoon sun, though a rock someone\u2014not I\u2014dared to throw touched nothing until it clattered on the paving stones.\nWe ran from them in terror; I ran, knowing they couldn\u2019t be real. I ran until the fear-stinking press of bodies shoved me aside into a gap between buildings, where I hid. Later the guards in their padded armor came to round up us strays. The dead and maimed lay on the worn stones, victims of the panic. I stepped around them, over them, not permitted to stop. The cries, the growing stench assured me these were not illusion.\nBetter the cold mist and these days of hunger and endless walking than trying to hide in broken Oslyge. Better this than letting myself be taken to the camps the Tysth\u00e4nder, the Peace Hands, claim are for our safety. Our safety in this time of transition; that\u2019s what their bulletins said. No one is sure whether the invaders\u2014\u201cproject administrators\u201d as they call themselves\u2014are of human stock, as we are, or are alien.\nTheir guards are human enough.\nMy mouth tastes foul. I will never get rid of that taste.\nHands shaking, I build a tiny fire under the curved shield of reeds and marsh mud that Arv\u00e5l\u2014thin-faced, clever\u2014rigged to distribute the heat signature over a larger area. Our bodies put off heat too, of course. The Tysthand orbiters could track us by that, Gunter says, but then they\u2019d have to look at every large animal, the elk and snava deer and the clumsy, barrel-plump danskgris the centuries have adapted for life in the willow marshes.\nThe mist hides the smoke, gray in gray. I steep the resinous buds of bog-tea until the liquid is strong and green, and my hands at least get warm. Gunter, the kapten, watches me from his sleepbag like the supervisor from Odven Mill did when I first started work there, a cold, assessing stare. Gunter\u2019s older than the others, with lines in his face that don\u2019t show in this light. I think he fears I\u2019ll slow them or give them away. I\u2019m afraid of his power over me, though he\u2019s offered me no harm.\nI take a mug of tea to Koben. The shy boy grunts his thanks and wraps his knobby, fine-skinned hands around the insulated cup. He\u2019s no older than my youngest brother, too young to be a soldier. I have another cup poured for Gunter but find he has withdrawn into his bag again.\nI try to make myself as useful as I can.\nWhen I turn back to the fire, Pir is there, squatting close to its heat. He\u2019s a strong young man with broad cheekbones; no older than I. His eyes are flat as he studies me.\nI take a careful sip from the cup I hold, and go to roll up my sleepbag. My hands are shaking again. That makes me angry but not enough to go back over to the fire.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let him intimidate you, Senne,\u201d Arv\u00e5l says, his voice rough still from sleep. His head pokes out from the straw-yellow folds of the bag next to mine. The dark, gold-set stone in his earlobe reflects firelight as he moves.\nI concentrate on rolling the bag into a tight bundle. \u201cI know,\u201d I say. I know, but I can\u2019t seem to help cringing from the man. With careful attention I strap the bag in its place on the pack I carry.\nThe sleepbag, the pack, the sharp knife at my belt, the boots and trousers I wear, and the soft field cap that keeps my long hair out of my eyes all came from a dead soldier on the outskirts of Oslyge. I\u2019d picked up his rifle as well, but Gunter took the ammunition out and bent the barrel between two boulders. He said I didn\u2019t know how to use it, which is true.\nFiring a gun is a good way to attract Tysthand attention anyway, so none of the men have dared use theirs since I met up with them. Which means no hunting, except for Pir\u2019s snares, and they\u2019ve caught nothing. The year\u2019s long fall isn\u2019t a season for snares. We should have bows, like most country people do. Bows are easier to make than rifles, and silent. I used to be good with a bow.\nThe sweater I wear was always mine, the gift of a lover. It used to be blue and white.\nI gulp down the rest of the bog-tea, lukewarm now and very bitter, then go rinse my face at the small lake\u2019s edge. The cold water dripping from my hands gives back a muffled plink. The light is growing. I can see the thick, pale shoots of nickelvass at the lake\u2019s edge, extending a long way into the mist. I hear a distant splashing, and a gray elk ghosts into view, rippling the rusty surface of the water.\nIf I had a bow, I would wait until it left the water, and shoot it. I turn back to camp, ready to go.\nIn the afternoon we find the homestead. We stop on a hilltop overlooking the small cluster of buildings: a stone house surrounded by a few rough sheds and windbreaks of poplar and feathery native skjovan. Skjovan is scrubby but long-lived. All other trees on NyHem are descended from stock our ancestors brought with them seven hundred years ago, though changed, as everything non-native must change to survive the metal-rich soil.\nPir throws himself down next to me and sends a hard glance my way, as though it\u2019s me he wants to fling himself on.\nMy anger is in my mind only, cold and without strength. I find myself trembling. Light-headed, I slip back down the hill the way we came, finding a boulder to squat behind, as though I need to relieve myself. When I come back I choose a spot as far from Pir as I can get.\nGunter holds us back for a long, careful hour, watching the homestead from our hilltop. The road\u2019s too close to suit him, and anyway, the Tysth\u00e4nder will have mapped every dwelling from their orbiters. But we need food. We tried boiling grass and it made us ill. We\u2019re not as adapted as the elk and danskgris.\nNothing moves below but wind in the trees and the building\u2019s shadow as minutes pass; the house is no illusion. The people who lived there have fled or been picked up. The Tysth\u00e4nder offer refuge for everyone and amnesty for our soldiers, an offer they allow no one to refuse. This region of marsh and rocky hills has always been sparsely settled, but now there are no people at all, except us and other fleeing soldiers.\nGunter says there\u2019s a hidden base some two days walk further west. He says the survivors from Oslyge will be heading there; he doesn\u2019t mean civilians like me, but soldiers. I\u2019d go home to the village I was born in, but I\u2019m afraid to see it, afraid it would be one more trap. Afraid to travel alone. I don\u2019t know what I will do at this base of Gunter\u2019s; brew tea perhaps.\nStill nothing moves, and Gunter sends Arv\u00e5l and Koben down to reconnoiter.\nI don\u2019t think Gunter likes Arv\u00e5l much. Pir fought in Gunter\u2019s company before Oslyge and is devoted to his kapten. Koben and Arv\u00e5l are both from other companies, but who could object to quiet Koben? Arv\u00e5l is also the only one strong and smart enough to challenge Gunter\u2019s leadership, though he seems careful not to.\nProbably I am not understanding how the army works.\nOf the four soldiers, I feel easiest with Arv\u00e5l. He\u2019s tall and white-haired and thin-faced like my next oldest brother, with an earring similar to Isak\u2019s. Arv\u00e5l has told Pir twice to leave me alone, though that may mean nothing.\nI lie on my belly in the coarse autumn grasses, rubbing the swollen place on my neck, waiting. I stink. All of us stink. Looking down the hill I think with longing of a pantry full of food, but also of the sauna the homestead below us will have.\nPreparing a sauna takes a lot of time, more than we can spare. I know this. I\u2019ll settle for the food.\nKoben and Arv\u00e5l disappear from sight as they circle the house, one to either side. After a few minutes Arv\u00e5l waves his rifle from the shadow of the doorway: all clear. Gunter leads us sprinting down the hill, like dogs, he says. A dog pack might well approach an empty homestead. Once we\u2019re beneath it the slabbed stone roof, baking in the sun, will hide our heat signatures, which aren\u2019t very strong on a warm afternoon anyway.\nThere\u2019s food in the pantry of the neat, thick-walled house, potatoes, black-skinned onions, and dried beans in bins, and shelves of gleaming canned produce. And dried l\u00e4der peaches, a whole winter\u2019s store of them sealed in a paper-lined clay crock. Pir finds them. I look up at his cry of excitement, and see his eyes transformed. The four of us, Gunter, Pir, Arv\u00e5l, and I, jostle like children to grab handfuls of them, the tension of hiding momentarily forgotten. The mingled food scents are intoxicating. I don\u2019t worry that Pir is close.\nKoben comes in from the back, the west side we couldn\u2019t see from our hilltop. He radiates warmth in the dim, cool pantry. His grimy field tunic is pulled out and up to make a carry-sling, the way a farm wife uses her apron. Inside it are heaped tomatoes, yellow-striped gurkor and handfuls of downy peapods. In one hand he holds a half-eaten tomato. Juice runs down his downy chin. \u201cLook!\u201d he calls out to us.\nGunter, massive but quick as a cat in his movements, turns and sees the boy. I watch as something very like despair flashes across his face. \u201cSpit it out!\u201d he orders.\nKoben freezes, baffled. After a second, he spits, but there\u2019s no red pulp. His light eyes are full of fear and questions.\n\u201cThey sprayed the gardens,\u201d Gunter says, crossing the flagstone floor. \u201cDidn\u2019t your kapten warn you?! They sprayed them all.\u201d He hustles the boy over to an empty bin and dumps the produce in. Some of the tomatoes split when they land. They smell heady, like summer and fermenting wine.\nGunter pushes Koben down on his knees and crams a finger down his throat. The boy gags. Something freezes up inside my mind. I can\u2019t watch this. I find the taste and smell of the turncoat Tysthand guard fouling my mouth once more, and my throat closes. I turn away and stumble out of the room, trying to breathe and not breathe at the same time.\nThe big kitchen is no refuge; I can still hear Koben gagging. A vase of wilted blue flax sits on the wickerwork table. It catches my eye but isn\u2019t enough to hold me. Across the room I see the door to the laundry shed, half open, and, desperate to think of anything but the sound behind me, I remember what my aunt did the morning her youngest drank disinfectant paint.\nOn a shelf above the deep laundry sink I find this family\u2019s supplies, bottles and cartons and a wide-mouthed jar of white pellets. I snatch this down and hurry back to the pantry, twisting off the lid as I go.\nKoben\u2019s still retching, but to little effect. Gunter bends over him, cursing. Pir still has one forgotten hand in the peach crock, but his other hand, like his face, is knotted with apprehension. Arv\u00e5l leans back against a bin, pale beneath his tan. Frightened, I think. He is, oddly, watching me.\nI yank on Gunter\u2019s sleeve. \u201cHere!\u201d I say. \u201cBack of the throat, as far down as you can get them.\u201d I dump a small pile of the pellets into Gunter\u2019s big hand. He forces poor Koben\u2019s mouth open again.\nThe sal soda works well enough. Koben has nothing left in his stomach but bile when he\u2019s done. I don\u2019t know what they spray the gardens with. I don\u2019t know if we acted fast enough to protect him.\nGunter drives us to fill our packs with food then. Koben just sits on the floor with his arms wrapped around his head while we load up with all we can carry\u2014flatbr\u00f6d, the one rope of dry sausage, cracked grains, and other things. We take a few of the heavy jars for tonight. Although my appetite\u2019s gone I stuff pockets and empty corners with the tough little peaches. If they aren\u2019t safe, it won\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve already eaten several.\nWe search for bows. The only one we find is snapped in half, but Arv\u00e5l puts the bowstring in his pocket. Gunter stops me from washing my hands and face at the sink when I pass it. He says just touching this water could make me very sick. I wonder what the Tysth\u00e4nder plan is: Do they intend people to go home? How will the people live if their water\u2019s undrinkable?\nTonight we\u2019re still among the upland hills, and there is no mist. This means no fire and no cloud roof to hold in the day\u2019s warmth. Familiar stars provide us a faint light. We sit beneath them by a jumble of ore-studded boulders; we eat a careful, cold feast of canned venison stew and pickled beets.\nSome of the stars above us are not familiar; some of them are traitors.\nArv\u00e5l is cheerful, drawing Pir and even Koben into talk about their homes. Gunter says little. He eats steadily and keeps an eye on Koben. He watches Arv\u00e5l too, with distrust.\nArv\u00e5l asks me about my home then. I\u2019d rather be just another shape in the darkness, though I understand his intent is to make me a real person to Pir. I can\u2019t see Pir\u2019s pale eyes from where I sit, so I say a few things: that I grew up in a homestead like the one this afternoon, not far from a long-settled village north of Oslyge. The people of my village make baskets and furniture from the fine black willow that has adapted well to the nearby marshes.\nArv\u00e5l asks about my family. I don\u2019t want to think about where my parents and sisters and youngest brother might be now, or about my two older brothers who are soldiers, so I hesitate.\nAnd then it happens. Koben pitches forward, spewing dark liquid that taints the chill air with the stink of sweet iron and bile. Gunter is already beside him, supporting the boy by his upper arms before he can fall on his face. Koben stares down, despairing, at the stuff that\u2019s gotten on his hands. His normally pale skin is a luminous white in the faint light, except where his mouth is stained. Another paroxysm takes him, this time of choking. I watch, unable to move, as more dark liquid trickles in strings from the corners of his mouth, from his nose. Koben\u2019s gaze turns inward, an intense concentration as he struggles to draw breath.\nHe jerks again and then he\u2019s gone, slumped boneless in Gunter\u2019s grasp like an arrow-shot bird, like the dead of Oslyge.\nI know what is due the dead of one\u2019s household, but there\u2019s little we can do for Koben. The ground is hard here, and the light poor, and we have no mattocks. After a period of stunned silence Gunter drags Koben over to the biggest boulder, to stretch him out beside its shelter. Pir hurries to help him. We gather stones to cover the body, stumbling around to find them.\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Gunter says at last. I lay the rock I\u2019m holding on top of the pile, and step back. The smell of the death is still strong around us.\nGunter\u2019s voice is heavy and flat when he speaks. \u201cWhat killed him is something the Tysth\u00e4nder call \u2018engineered bacteria.\u2019\u201d\nI\u2019ve never heard these two words linked together this way, but I take them to mean a sickness that\u2019s somehow designed the way a weapon is, a perverse thought but no stranger than creating apparitions to drive people mad with fear. Perhaps we had knowledge of these things when we came to NyHem. If so, I\u2019m not sorry we lost it.\nGunter pauses only for breath. \u201cThey sprayed all crops in the settled regions with it, all but those in Holberthe, where the people welcomed them.\u201d Contempt edges his words, though he doesn\u2019t revile them as I would. At least one of the guards who drove us was from Holberthe; I heard it in his voice. \u201cThe Tysth\u00e4nder say they work to harness what they call our world\u2019s full adaptive potential, that this is but a first step. So I was told.\u201d He pauses and looks down towards his feet. \u201cThey tried to win the army\u2019s help by telling us of the danger. Thus I knew, and my duty was to see that you all were warned.\u201d\nGunter takes off his officer\u2019s cap and holds it in his big hands. All of us follow suit.\n\u201cKoben, your death is on my head,\u201d Gunter says, hoarse.\nPir shakes his head angrily. \u201cThey killed him, Kapten, as they killed all the others.\u201d The words burst out of him. \u201cI will see that they pay, Koben, I swear it.\u201d\nI wonder how he\u2019ll do that, but he\u2019s right that Koben\u2019s death\u2014yet another one\u2014is on the Tysth\u00e4nder, the Peace Hands who say they don\u2019t use violence. I echo Pir: \u201cThey killed him.\u201d\nGunter doesn\u2019t acknowledge our words.\nYou should speak good of the dead at a funeral, not merely curse their killers. I find something to say, though it seems inadequate. I didn\u2019t really know him; he was so quiet. \u201cKoben, you reminded me of my youngest brother, whom I love. Gud keep your spirit.\u201d\n\u201cRest in peace, Koben,\u201d Arv\u00e5l says softly. He stands off by himself a little, as he often does. His expression, as much as I can see it, is weary and sad, and his hands\u2019 grip is tight on his cap. The stone in his ear winks as it catches the starlight.\nI wonder what peace means now.\nWithout saying anything more, Gunter shoulders both his pack and rifle, and Koben\u2019s, and walks away from the makeshift grave. It\u2019s foolhardy to travel at night if you don\u2019t have to, but I don\u2019t want to sleep here either.\nI wish I had a stick to feel the way before me.\nI don\u2019t know how long we stumble onward, or how far we travel in that time. At first we go single file, letting Gunter pick our path, but as exhaustion takes its toll, we straggle more, and wander off to one side or the other. Or at least I straggle.\nAt one point this begins to seem funny to me. I see an image of myself as a pup trying to keep up with its mother, when the mother isn\u2019t paying any attention to it. I guess it\u2019s thinking of Gunter as a bitch with pups that strikes me as funny.\nCertainly Gunter seems unaware of us.\nOn a particularly rough hillside I lose sight of everyone before I reach the top. I\u2019m groggy enough by now that this is slow to sink in. Then it hits me that I might end up out here on the broad uplands alone, and I\u2019m wide awake again. I scramble up the slope without watching as I ought, but I don\u2019t fall.\nAt the crest I pause, listening and straining my eyes for a sign of the men. I can\u2019t see anything I\u2019m sure of\u2014is that dark shape one of them?; is it moving?\u2014but after a moment I hear a thump and a muttered curse close by. Relief trickles in, and I make my way toward the sound with a little more care.\nNot care enough. When I\u2019m a little ways downslope, picking my way through a thicket of brush, my left foot snags, then both feet are tangled up with something too solid to be a shrub and too yielding to be a boulder; I can\u2019t keep myself from falling.\nPir yelps.\nThe smell should\u2019ve warned me I was close to one of the others, I think as I fall, as I land hard on top of Pir. It\u2019s a useless thought, shaken out of me when he shoves me off him. The weight of the pack pulls me over on my back. The rock ledge he likely tripped on digs into my hip as I try to squirm further away, onto my side.\n\u201cDj\u00e4vul take it!\u201d Pir snaps out of the darkness, his voice raw with exhaustion. \u201cCan\u2019t you watch where you\u2019re going?\u201d Burdened by his own pack, he rolls half on top of me as he struggles to get up once again.\nThen Pir feels who I am. I know when he knows, cold in my guts, a prickling ache spreading in my limbs.\nA hand, Pir\u2019s hand, knocks off my cap and knots itself hard in my tangled hair, while his other arm flails, getting free from his pack strap. His face is a wide-eyed blur. I have no leverage, held down by the weight strapped to my back, his knee already pinning one leg, his panting harsh in my ears; I am trapped; I am trapped. I think to yell. Days on the run, where silence is part of safety, slows the impulse, and his mouth is hard on mine, his weight presses the breath out of me. The musk of skin smothers me in past terror, while my body struggles with the present, his body shoving against mine. At least with him above me now I have something to push against, a strange sort of anchor.\nThe smell, the taste in my mouth is not the Tysthand guard. The breath rasping in my ears sounds more desperate than triumphant. I can fight back.\nI bite Pir, hard. He jerks away, crying out, and I fumble for the knife I remember I have, that I didn\u2019t have then, in Oslyge.\nThen someone drags Pir off me. Pir kicks me in the process, but there\u2019s not much force behind it. I manage this time to roll to my side and then onto my hands and knees so I can get up. Arv\u00e5l is pummeling Pir a few feet away. Pir, on the bottom this time, is trying to defend himself.\n\u201cStop.\u201d Gunter stands a little ways downslope, his face like stone. He\u2019s not a tall man\u2014no taller than I\u2014but he has a large presence. Arv\u00e5l freezes, his right arm cocked back for another blow. Then he lets go a deep breath and gets off Pir.\nPir scrambles to his feet, panting, unsteady. His mouth is bleeding, either where I bit him or from one of Arv\u00e5l\u2019s blows. He opens his mouth\u2014to explain, perhaps; to accuse\u2014but Gunter halts him with a cold glare. Then Gunter looks at Arv\u00e5l, who lifts his chin a little, defiant.\nAnd Gunter looks at me. His eyes are angry. I look back. I see the pain sketched around his mouth and eyes, beneath the anger. I find I\u2019m no longer afraid of him.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll camp down below,\u201d he says, and turns away.\nI recover my cap.\nAfter a day and a half more of hard travel, some of it wading through knee-deep water, we\u2019re once again working our way up into the yellow hills. The sky is clear, but there\u2019s a cold edge to the breeze that whips the tall grasses.\nAs we climb I feel the absence of Koben. His not-presence is always somewhere in my mind. Four people don\u2019t travel with the same rhythm as five.\nGunter and Pir are up ahead, both silent. Gunter seems to have more energy this afternoon. He looks around, an alert eagerness in the angle of his head and the set of his shoulders. I think we\u2019re nearing the base he spoke of.\nPir keeps his eyes on the ground. His lip is still swollen. He hasn\u2019t talked much since the fight, and he no longer stares at me. He seems shamed, though I find that hard to credit.\nArv\u00e5l walks beside me now, asking questions about the mill where I worked in Oslyge, about life in the city. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s chosen to hang back with me. I\u2019m grateful to him for yanking Pir off me that night. Realizing I could pull my knife and actually using it were two different things. I wouldn\u2019t want to have killed Pir, even if I\u2019d been able to. But Arv\u00e5l\u2019s attentions make me wary.\nI tire of talking about the city. Oslyge was a beautiful place, but my memory of it is tainted by what happened. If this conflict was over, I\u2019d choose to go home to the willow marshes, or to live in a place like that homestead.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to the camps with the other civilians, Senne?\u201d Arv\u00e5l asks, taking me by surprise. \u201cYou would\u2019ve been safe there. Out here you could be killed.\u201d\nOr raped. Or both. But he doesn\u2019t say these things. I find I\u2019m angry at him for asking; does he believe the Tysthand lies? I stop walking, although I shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019ll fall behind.\n\u201cOh ja, safety!\u201d My voice is louder than I intended. \u201cThat\u2019s what they promised on the radio and in those pamphlets they showered on our heads. They use force only in self-defense; it\u2019s their Code or some such thing.\u201d Everyone had thought the broadcasts hoaxes until the air-cars came. Arv\u00e5l, a few steps ahead, half turns to listen to me. \u201cThen they sent down apparitions that drove the whole city mad with fear. How many died then, Arv\u00e5l?\u201d He meets my eyes. He\u2019s listening, intent, but I can\u2019t read his response.\n\u201cAnd when their guards, the turncoats, rounded us up, they beat the slow ones, the old people. With my own eyes I saw this! Some of them cut a woman who was near me out of the crowd, just like dogs do with sheep. They took her off into an alley. I heard her screaming.\u201d I stop speaking, to try to catch my breath, to slow my heartbeat. I don\u2019t like to remember that sound, but it\u2019s like the taste in my mouth; it goes on forever. I was so frightened then of the same thing happening to me, and shamed by my fear and paralysis.\nIt\u2019s hard to continue, but I do. \u201cI didn\u2019t see her come back.\u201d Arv\u00e5l\u2019s looking shocked, almost hurt. For a soldier he seems na\u00efve. \u201cIf that\u2019s safety, Arv\u00e5l, I\u2019m no worse off out here. And here they can\u2019t make me into whatever cursed thing they\u2019ve planned for us all\u2014a good, obedient flock of citizen-sheep.\u201d\nI turn away and start walking again. My socks are still damp from wading; my blisters protest. Gunter and Pir are far ahead of us.\nArv\u00e5l follows. He looks down at the yellow dirt and the tall scalegrass as he walks. When he does speak, his voice is hesitant. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, Senne, them hurting civilians. They need the people here to cooperate with them eventually, or they can\u2019t make a profit with this world in a way that fits with their rules, the Code they talk about. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d let their men do that.\u201d\nI don\u2019t answer. They need us frightened, I think, angry at his reliance on our enemy\u2019s logical motives. Something about the thought catches my attention as though it\u2019s important. Then it just seems obvious: They need us frightened so we won\u2019t resist.\n\u201cPerhaps they\u2019ll punish the men who did those things,\u201d Arv\u00e5l offers, tentative. \u201cAs we punish such men in the army.\u201d\nI snap at him, \u201cThey lie, Arv\u00e5l, and you can\u2019t trust anything they say. If any of them break this Code of theirs, it will always be our fault we\u2019re dead.\u201d I walk on very fast, ignoring my blisters.\nWe gain a little on Gunter and Pir.\nAfter a while Arv\u00e5l speaks again, desolation in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve hoped they weren\u2019t lying about the camps, that my uncle would be out of danger there. He isn\u2019t young.\u201d\nI shrug, still upset. \u201cWell, maybe if he moves fast and does everything they want, and he\u2019s lucky, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And maybe they\u2019ll reward him then, and win his loyalty. Maybe that\u2019s exactly what they plan, with the rapes and beating deaths useful tactics in their program.\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d He frowns in thought, treading with caution through a stretch of loose stones. \u201cYou got away from them,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s a question.\nFor a heartbeat I feel like throwing up; I feel the guard\u2019s grip on the back of my head, the ache from kneeling on paving stones, and the sharper pain in my neck as one of his nails dug in. I\u2019m dizzy with it, but I keep walking, driven. \u201cI bribed a guard.\u201d I hear my own voice, very harsh. I suppose it\u2019s true, though I had no choice about the coin. I got a better deal than the woman in the alley.\nBitterness fills me, and I let it spill out. \u201cThey offer amnesty for the army. Why haven\u2019t you surrendered if you believe them, Arv\u00e5l?\u201d I\u2019m sorry as soon as I say the words. None of this is his fault.\nHis frown deepens into a scowl. \u201cI\u2019m a soldier. This is my duty.\u201d He pauses and then mutters. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if we have no chance against them.\u201d\nAfter a while, to break the silence, I ask about his uncle.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a teacher, in Pesgjevving. He raised me. He was strict, but very good to me.\u201d Arv\u00e5l isn\u2019t thinking about his answer. It sounds automatic, like he\u2019s said that and nothing more many times.\nI nod. I don\u2019t know much about Pesgjevving, except that it\u2019s a grim, gray sort of place near the border with Holberthe, the center of the mountain region as Oslyge is of the upland plains. A university is there. \u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d gone to more than a village school. You sound like it sometimes. Different.\u201d\nArv\u00e5l glances at me, wariness in his eyes. Their dark irises seem the same color as the stone in his earlobe. \u201cJa, I went to the university for a short while,\u201d he answers, and then shuts up. Perhaps he is self-conscious. An educated foot soldier can\u2019t have an easy time of it, not if it shows. I decide I won\u2019t ask him more questions now. We seem to both be poking at the other\u2019s sore spots.\nUp ahead Gunter pauses just shy of the hill\u2019s crest, to survey the land on the other side. Between one breath and another he drops flat, signaling us down. His rifle is no longer slung from his shoulder, but in his hands.\nWhen I hit the grass the pack I carry knocks the air from my lungs, though it\u2019s lighter than it was two days ago. This close, the grass smells of hay and alkali dust. Tiny springes, brown insects a scant centimeter long, leap away. I follow Arv\u00e5l\u2019s worn boot soles as he crawls upslope to join Gunter and Pir.\nGunter points down to our left. Some distance along the long, shallow valley below is a group of men, twenty or more, all dressed in the same dirty-straw color we wear. Other survivors from the Oslyge regiment that Gunter hoped for, or a trap.\nWe watch them for a while. They cast proper shadows, and travel away from us, westward, at a footsore pace.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go check them out, Kapten,\u201d Pir says into the silence. He\u2019s already poised to move.\nGunter looks at Pir for a long moment, calculating the odds maybe. Then he nods acceptance.\nPir scuttles backward until he\u2019s far enough below the hill\u2019s crest to run bent over without being seen. When he\u2019s some distance away from us Pir straightens and walks over the crest. His rifle\u2019s in his hands, the muzzle down. After a minute or so he whistles like a danskgris, an unlikely sound up here in the hills, but safer than a shout, I suppose.\nThe signal carries well. The men in the valley scatter, and flatten themselves in the grass. Sunlight gleams on the barrels of their weapons. The grass provides scant cover from anyone up at our height, but spread apart like that, they make a more difficult target. I hear Gunter muttering in approval.\nPir waves his rifle. The tiny men below don\u2019t respond. I see their heads turning as they survey the crests of the hills around them. We hold very still. The swelling on my neck throbs in the sun\u2019s heat. Now I remember how I got it\u2014the guard\u2019s fingernails. The traitor with his shirt hem of that jacquard linen they favor in Holberthe, pulled loose from the opening in his padded armor.\nI suppose the sore will heal eventually. Washing with soap and hot water would help.\nPir sets off at a steady lope towards the soldiers, holding his rifle horizontally above his head. At a distance from them no greater than the length of a wealthy farmer\u2019s barn, Pir stops. Two of the soldiers scramble to their feet, sling their rifles back over their shoulders, and come toward him, their arms open. The others relax their guard, stand up, or sit back with their hands loose. One of the two approaching Pir grabs him in a hug.\nA moment later Pir turns and waves us down.\nTwenty-eight travel with a much different rhythm than four or five. The leader of this group, \u00d6verste Rimestad, sends pairs of scouts ahead to guard against surprises. They come and go at intervals, running, while the rest of us keep a steady pace.\nI stay close to Gunter at first. I know nothing of these new soldiers. But here Gunter is Kapten Prett, and he walks with the \u00f6verste, listening respectfully when the skinny officer talks. This morning I was part of Gunter\u2019s group, whatever the tensions between me and Pir. Once again I\u2019m nobody.\nPir stays close to his friends, the man who hugged him and the other one. Most of these soldiers are from Pir and Gunter\u2019s company. Arv\u00e5l travels at the rear of this group, not talking much to anyone. After a while I fall back to walk near him.\nArv\u00e5l\u2019s dark eyes hold a nervous spark. He nods at me, though his mind seems elsewhere.\nThe sun is very low; still we climb and descend hills. At the moment we are climbing. I ask, \u201cDo you think we\u2019re getting close to this base, Arv\u00e5l?\u201d\n\u201cI am sure of it,\u201d he answers, but says nothing more.\nA sunburned infantryman ahead slows his pace until he\u2019s walking beside me. After a bit he offers his name: \u201cRaulf.\u201d\n\u201cSenne,\u201d I answer. There seems no harm in him; he\u2019s only curious.\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re not enlisted, as we are?\u201d The soldier flushes, which makes his whole face red, instead of just his cheeks and nose. It\u2019s a foolish question\u2014women don\u2019t join the army\u2014and a good question as well. I travel with soldiers and wear most of the uniform. What\u2019s he to think? I hope wearily that I\u2019m too grimy for him to conclude I\u2019m some kind of prostitute.\n\u201cNo, I worked in a clothing mill in Oslyge,\u201d I tell him, hoping to leave the matter there. The hill\u2019s getting steeper. I concentrate on my footing among the stones.\n\u201cOslyge,\u201d he repeats, and his eyes look bleak. \u201cThat was a bad time.\u201d\nWe\u2019re catching up with the others. Scouts have returned and the group halts while the \u00f6verste listens to their report.\nThe officer is smiling. Gunter is smiling. I hear someone say one of the entrances to the base has been spotted. I find I\u2019m excited and fearful in equal measure.\n\u00d6verste Rimestad gives the hand sign to move out. Eager, the men hurry upward. I see Gunter\u2019s\u2014Kapten Prett\u2019s\u2014broad back ahead, Koben\u2019s rifle stuck through the ties of his pack. I see Pir and his friends disappear over the crest.\nAt last, panting, I reach the top. The sunburned soldier has gone on ahead. Arv\u00e5l stands on the crest, resting, looking down, his shadow long behind him. Across a shallow bowl of yellow grass is an outcropping of rock, not very impressive, though a few dark openings in the rock indicate caves. Boulders litter the slope before the rock face. The sun is setting beyond the hills, and the sky is clear gold and peach and green.\nArv\u00e5l glances at me. I think he\u2019s about to say something, so I pause. He holds his silence, and I start down.\nArv\u00e5l follows, the last of us. As if he\u2019s just become aware of this, he plunges by me, down into the shadowed grass.\nI don\u2019t want to fall completely behind but I don\u2019t need to be first to the cave, either. I trot downslope, being careful of my footing. My pack jounces on my back.\nAided by the slope, Arv\u00e5l has already reached the cluster of soldiers around \u00d6verste Rimestad and Gunter. I see Rimestad put out a hand to stop Arv\u00e5l, and the two of them stand talking as the others pass them by. Arv\u00e5l salutes as though given an order, and the officer continues on.\nArv\u00e5l goes on too, after a moment, no longer eager. He\u2019s got some unpleasant duty, I think. That would be Gunter\u2019s doing.\nI catch up to the sunburned soldier and several others down on the flat. With the sun gone the breeze is much colder, though there\u2019s still plenty of light. I shiver and hurry onward, eager now to be inside before full dark.\nAnother soldier comes up level with me, not too close. I hadn\u2019t thought anyone was behind. I glance over at him as he picks his way through the grass. A gangly youth, a little ragged, with knobby knuckles beneath too-long sleeves. Koben.\nKoben. It cannot be Koben. The grass at his feet doesn\u2019t bend. He has no shadow.\nNone of us have shadows; the sun\u2019s down.\nThere are too many men ahead of us. Around us.\nMy heart pounds in my chest like fever, like terror. I open my mouth to shout.\nAnd they come. The Tysth\u00e4nder come very fast over the hilltops, riding black sleds a half meter or so above the ground as though this were midwinter and the grass buried deep in the copper-hued snow. They are armored in gleaming black, and their weapons spit light.\nI hit the ground.\nMen scream. Men scatter and their rifles crack like drover\u2019s whips, like so many ice-burdened branches snapping. Bullets whine and the rifles of the soldiers near me strike like hammer blows on my eardrums, ringing steel.\nThe cool ground contains the pounding of my heart so that it shakes my rib cage. My head feels very light. Sound ceases to hold any meaning other than pain. I don\u2019t want to die staring at a tiny rust-red bug climbing the scales on a stem of grass.\nI risk raising my head. The field is chaos to my eyes at first, running, burning soldiers and streaks of light and a few of the sleds. Not many. Shot down, or abandoned now the enemy\u2019s reached us?\nThere are far too many men. Some look like Koben.\nI see Pir and then Gunter among the runners, though Gunter\u2019s pace is slower, his familiar dog-pack lope. A sled and its black-armored rider sweeps between us, so for a moment I can\u2019t see him. And then a big piece of the sled\u2019s gone, like a slice out of a H\u00e2l cake. The sled flies on as though nothing\u2019s wrong, and then it\u2019s whole again. It\u2019s not a trick of my eyes.\nMen burn and the grass doesn\u2019t catch fire.\nThere is no attack. There\u2019s nothing but their damned apparitions projected from . . . where? I twist round to stare upwards: nothing but a sky the deep color of evening, dotted with tiny puffs of cloud.\nOslyge\u2019s sky was cloudless, that terrible day.\nIt\u2019s from one of their orbiters these images come, if that\u2019s even possible. But how did the Tysth\u00e4nder find this base?\nAnd Koben. How could they have his image, dirty and too thin as I knew him? Unless he was one of them\u2014but then he wouldn\u2019t have eaten anything from the garden.\nOne of us gave them his image.\nArv\u00e5l, always a little apart from the rest. The stone in his earlobe dark and translucent like his eyes.\nArv\u00e5l, from the mountains on the Holberthe border. Ordered just now to a task that didn\u2019t fit his plans.\nI\u2019m up and pounding toward the cave. I ignore the sleds. I don\u2019t think the light weapons can harm me, though stray bullets might. I pass the sunburned soldier and one other. They don\u2019t shoot at me. I think there\u2019s less gunfire, but I\u2019m not sure. All I hear is a ringing confusion.\nSomeone\u2019s lying on his belly in the grass ahead. I dodge, hoping again to not get shot, but the man\u2019s arms are wide-flung, the ground dark red beneath his chest. Officer\u2019s cap, skinny. I stumble on the \u00f6verste\u2019s rifle, but don\u2019t fall.\nOff to one side I see an odd-looking soldier, clean-shaven, in a dirty sweater, with long, light hair stuffed up under his cap. Her cap. I slow in bewilderment. Light envelops her, and her body contorts in agony as she burns.\nSomething hits me from the side, brings me down flat. Gunter, but how is he back here? He\u2019s beside me down in the grass, angry and yelling in my face but I can\u2019t make out what he says. I see that he has bits of wool in his ears. The barrel of his rifle lies almost under my nose. It smells hot.\nI clap my hands to my ears, then pull them away. \u201cArv\u00e5l,\u201d I gasp, the name a gabble inside my head. \u201cTraitor,\u201d I try to say.\nHe nods; he knows already. His eyes are the blue of deep ice, his face fissured stone. He holds out a hand, stiff, the palm towards me: wait. Cautious, he raises his head and looks around. Then he grabs my sleeve and yanks me into a crouching run. We finish up on the far side of a boulder. It\u2019s too small for sure cover, but better than grass.\nAgain the hand signal to wait. Gunter reaches back and pulls his extra rifle, Koben\u2019s rifle, from his pack. He puts it in my hands.\nWhen I saw Gunter running for the cave, he carried only one rifle. Indeed, Arv\u00e5l gave them all our images.\nThe weapon\u2019s heavy. I don\u2019t know how to use this thing.\nGunter launches himself back into the center of the chaos, zigzagging, diving for cover when a sled comes near. He hasn\u2019t figured out that they\u2019re illusion; I should have told him. Beyond him I see his quarry: Arv\u00e5l sprinting for an opening in the rock face.\nArv\u00e5l in a clean uniform. I open my mouth to yell.\nThe bullet takes Gunter somewhere in the back. I can\u2019t tell where. All I see is the puff of dust as it hits his pack, and then him tumbling forward. Perhaps I cry out loud enough to be heard; I can\u2019t tell.\nA second Arv\u00e5l appears from behind a boulder, rifle in hand, dashing toward the place where Gunter fell. This one\u2019s clothes are streaked with mud and sweat as I remember them. I put the stock of Koben\u2019s rifle to my shoulder, sight along the barrel. I don\u2019t think about killing him, just that I must stop him. I squeeze the trigger. It doesn\u2019t take much force.\nThe gun slams back into my shoulder, and my right ear is hammered once again. Dazed, I find Arv\u00e5l still running, unharmed, only a few meters separating him from Gunter now. Is he too only an image?\nI\u2019m scrambling across the rough field before I know what I\u2019m doing. Someone\u2014a panicked soldier\u2014crashes into me, knocking me sideways. I use the rifle to keep myself from falling. The air burns my lungs and Arv\u00e5l\u2019s on top of Gunter now, his bowstring around the kapten\u2019s throat, real enough to kill him.\nTwo steps more. I swing the rifle butt down at the back of Arv\u00e5l\u2019s head like a mattock, but I\u2019m not steady as one must be to drive a mattock\u2019s blade into hardpan. The rifle butt glances off the top of his pack and bounces from my grasp; I\u2019m overbalanced, falling forward. Arv\u00e5l twists to face me, snarling. I see the knife in his right hand, the shining knifepoint I fall toward. Terrified, I throw myself to the side, drawing my own knife, my left arm out to shield me.\nThe heavy pack yanks me over, giving added force to my instinctive thrust. My knife drives through the fabric of his tunic, up into his chest, easy as cutting cheese.\nHis mouth is round, his eyes are round. His eyes say my name, ask a question I can\u2019t answer. Warm liquid, dark red, soaks my right hand and his tunic.\nHis knife\u2019s in the dirt, the blade stained.\nThere\u2019s blood on my left arm as well.\nPeople shouldn\u2019t be so easy to cut.\nGrunting, I turn Gunter over. He\u2019s alive, bleeding from a small hole near his shoulder. I can\u2019t tell which blood is his, which is Arv\u00e5l\u2019s, or mine. It seems to matter.\nI look around. Light is draining from the sky. The Tysthand sleds have disappeared and the field is near empty of men. I see maybe five of them, standing, their rifles dangling from their hands. I hope the rest are inside, and not dead, hidden by the long scalegrass.\nArv\u00e5l\u2019s eyes are dull now, though his ear-stone still gleams. If the gem is what serves as their eye, they\u2019ll have a good view of his killer.\nGunter\u2019s too heavy for me to carry. As I start to drag him to the cave Pir comes to help me, and then others come as well.\nWe\u2019re deep inside the maze of caves and passages and treacherous cracks, in an irregular room lit by oil lamps\u2014safe enough for the moment now that the side entrance we came through has been blocked by an explosive charge. The lamps warm the room some as well as light it, but still it\u2019s cold. The place smells of damp stone and oil smoke and stale fear sweat. I\u2019ve heard that caves can be beautiful, but this one isn\u2019t.\nI shiver, and the sunburned soldier\u2014I don\u2019t remember his name\u2014brings me a sleepbag. He tells me I should lie down, that I\u2019m in shock. My ears still ring, but I can hear him. The soldier\u2019s face is very pale beneath the sunburn, and his eyes look bruised.\nIncluding \u00d6verste Rimestad, we lost four men. Four men and Arv\u00e5l, whom I killed with my knife. All the others were shot. The injuries I see around me look like gunshot wounds and broken bones or sprains, except for mine. No one was burned.\nI didn\u2019t need to kill Arv\u00e5l. I feel sick, thinking this. I could have held the muzzle of the rifle to his head to stop him; he didn\u2019t know I\u2019d used the bullet in it. I console myself that he wouldn\u2019t have lived long, with four dead men to avenge.\nI\u2019ve asked about Gunter\u2019s\u2014Kapten Prett\u2019s\u2014condition, and no one seems to know.\nI\u2019ve asked what duty it was that Arv\u00e5l was given, and no one is sure of that either. None of the soldiers near me, anyway. Possibly he was to stand watch at the entrance, with some of the men already there, rather than go down with the rest of us. The \u00f6verste had ordered three other men to that duty.\nAn injured man screams as the doctor works on him. Another man near me cries softly.\nThe doctor gets to me after a while. He\u2019s an older man, not a soldier. He looks ill-tempered, but his hands are quick and sure as they unwrap the torn shirt from my forearm. He pours disinfectant over the slash and I break out in a sweat. The edges of the cut are neat with the blood washed away, skin and fat and fine-textured dark muscle beneath. My head feels light.\nThe doctor sponges something else, icy cold, on my skin, and after a little begins to sew up the slash. I turn my head away.\nWhen he\u2019s done and the arm wrapped again, he says, \u201cHold still.\u201d He leans forward and touches the swelling on my neck. He smells strongly like the disinfectant. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d His voice is harsh.\nMy breath gets trapped in my chest for a moment. \u201cOslyge,\u201d I whisper. \u201cA Tysthand guard.\u201d The guard\u2019s hands grip me once more; the taste chokes me. I\u2019ll learn to live with this.\n\u201cHold still,\u201d he says again, and wipes something over the skin there. Before I know what he\u2019s planning, he slices into the swelling. I cry out; I\u2019d thought the pain was over. I feel more liquid on my neck, but he wipes it away. He holds the cloth to my neck for a minute, then pulls it away and shows me: what you\u2019d expect, blood and some yellowish stuff, but also a small round thing like a mustard seed.\nHe scowls. \u201cA tag. With luck we\u2019re under too much rock for them to be able to trace it.\u201d He pulls an instrument out of his bag that looks like a small pair of pliers, and uses them to crush it. \u201cJust the same we won\u2019t stay here long.\u201d\nWhen he goes I lay back on my sleepbag. I\u2019m exhausted, too tired to sleep, and tears leak from the corners of my eyes. The bargain the Tysthand guard offered me was a lie, as is everything the Tysth\u00e4nder say. I could\u2019ve led the enemy to us, as surely as Arv\u00e5l did.\nWas it him? Am I sure? Maybe he\u2019d only gone to help Gunter. Maybe his earring was nothing more than a red stone. I feel again the knife sliding up into his flesh. If I had just held the gun on him, I might know the answers by now. I close my eyes, and tears soak into my hair.\nI hear someone come up beside me, feet shuffling in the loose dirt of the floor. \u201cHey,\u201d Pir says, touching my arm. \u201cThe kapten wanted me to tell you that he\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\nI start to wipe my sleeve across my face, but it\u2019s stiff with dried blood. There\u2019s nothing to do but face Pir with tears on my face.\n\u201cGood,\u201d I manage to say.\nPir looks as haggard as the sunburned soldier did earlier, his face pinched with exhaustion. \u201cHe lost a lot of blood, but the doctor says the bullet mostly tore up muscle.\u201d\nI suppose this is good news. \u201cDid he say\u2014do you know what order the \u00f6verste gave Arv\u00e5l?\u201d If I knew this, I could be sure about what I did. A spy would\u2019ve needed to go in with the rest.\nPir looks puzzled, but as he considers Arv\u00e5l his expression hardens. He looks like the soldier I was so frightened of before, except his anger isn\u2019t at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know about any orders,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Knut found a reddish powder in his pack that the doctor says is what they use to make water undrinkable. And other stuff, worse than that. He would\u2019ve driven us out for the Tysth\u00e4nder to slaughter.\u201d\nOr to tame, and which is worse? I shiver, thinking of Arv\u00e5l walking beside me, asking questions. Protecting me from Pir\u2019s hostility. \u201cI don\u2019t understand him,\u201d I whisper. I stare up at the ceiling.\nPir shrugs. I see this out of the corner of my eye. Understanding Arv\u00e5l holds no interest for him. After a minute he says, \u201cThe kapten also wanted me to tell you he\u2019ll teach you to shoot.\u201d He smiles a little at this, pleased to be bringing me a reward. I can be a soldier too.\nMy ears and head ache, and the tears sting again. I remember the crack of the rifles. I remember the air-sleds spitting light; the woman in the dirty sweater, burning; Oslyge. The bodies in the grass. The blood.\n\u201cWho is it I would shoot, if Gunter taught me?\u201d I ask Pir. He looks confused again, beginning to be irritated. \u201cAll they send against us are illusions and our own traitors, Pir.\u201d\nHis face closes. He doesn\u2019t want to remember whose bullets killed the men today. \u201cThink about it,\u201d he says, and leaves me.\nI think. Most of the oil lamps are out, leaving their stink behind. The cave\u2019s full of shadows. Unable to sleep, I think.\nRifles kill living things, not lies and illusion. We can\u2019t touch them with rifles. What else is left?\nArv\u00e5l said it, and I thought him a fool: Their profit. Cooperation. If we won\u2019t be bullied and wooed into working for them, we deny them profit. If they don\u2019t profit, they fail.\nI think our battle is in the Tysthand camps, for the will of our people, not out here\u2014if we haven\u2019t already lost. Exhaustion and the throbbing of my arm and neck bind me tight in despair. How many days has it been since they rounded up the people of Oslyge, of the whole region? Will the soldiers around me be willing to fight with other weapons?\nI don\u2019t want to put myself within the grasp of the Tysth\u00e4nder. I want to be a dog out in the hills and eat scavenged food and drink from lakes like the danskgris.\nI don\u2019t want to go to them, but I will.\nSally Gwylan was born in Texas and raised all over the South. She now resides in New Mexico in a small, handmade, off-the-grid house a half hour west of Albuquerque, where the wind blows more often than not. A graduate of the 1985 Clarion Writer's Workshop, Ms. Gwylan works part-time at a law firm to allow time for writing, singing, gardening, and building stuff."}

As somebody who\u2019s devoted thirty-odd years of her life to you.\n We\u2019ve all made some mistakes. We\u2019ve all had moments in our lives when we got a little self-important, maybe. Where our senses of humor failed us.\n I\u2019m as guilty as anyone of taking myself too seriously.\n But for you, it\u2019s become an addiction. You seem to think that nothing fun can have value; that only grimdark portentousness and dystopia mean anything. You wallow in human suffering and despair, and frankly\u2014it makes me tired.\n I remember when we were younger. You were so clever, so playful. So much fun. We had some good times. You could make me laugh and think at the same time. You made my pulse race.\n But we got older and started understanding a little better how complicated the world is. How layered people\u2019s motivations are. At first, you seemed to handle the moral complexity well. You\u2019d give me something like The Forever War or The Left Hand of Darkness, and we could talk about it for hours.\n I mean, I sensed your ambivalence. But I had some ambivalence of my own. That\u2019s the thing about ambivalence\u2014it\u2019s a kind of tension. And tension drives a narrative, right?\n And I don\u2019t know if you got uncomfortable with the tension? Maybe you felt like you couldn\u2019t live in limbo anymore, but you\u2019d seen too much to believe in happy endings anymore. I\u2019m guessing, I admit\u2014but I wonder if you felt like had to find some way to resolve things. Get some closure. And escapism . . . just wasn\u2019t open to you any more.\n You started thinking you had to be cynical and mean to accomplish anything. You got wrapped up in your own history and your long-running arguments. You buried yourself in the seriousness of it all, and you forgot how to tell a joke. You even got\u2014I hate to say it\u2014kind of pretentious. Didactic, even.\n The thing is, that kind of cynical pose is really just a juvenile reaction to the world not being what we hoped. We can\u2019t have everything\u2014so we reject anything. But it\u2019s adolescent, darling, and most of us outgrow it. We realize that as much as the world can be a ball of dung, and horrible things can happen for no reason, there are positive outcomes too, sometimes. I\u2019m not going to say things balance out, because of course they don\u2019t\u2014life is not fair\u2014but it\u2019s not just awful, either.\n I\u2019m not crying out for slapstick, here. You know that\u2019s never done it for me. And I\u2019m certainly not saying that I want you to be shallower.\n If anything, I\u2019m asking you to be deeper\u2014to embrace more of the range of human experience. Not just the bad times. I mean, sure, we need to acknowledge the bad times, and I\u2019ve deeply admired your recent willingness to explore new perspectives, to take on issues of race and gender and sexuality that once you would have shied from.\n I have never doubted your courage.\n But look at Terry Pratchett. (I know, we should all be Terry Pratchett. But then what would he read?) He manages to be incisive without being pretentious. He manages to be sharp and illuminating by being funny. Look at Neil Gaiman. Here\u2019s a guy who can tackle some hard subjects and still have a good time. He makes people like him, and because they like him, they listen when he says hard, important things.\n I almost hate to bring it up, but . . . J.K. Rowling? I know, you don\u2019t take her seriously. She\u2019s a woman, and she writes for kids, and in fairness some of the later books . . . could have used a closer encounter with the blue pencil. So it\u2019s easy for you to dismiss her. But what you can\u2019t dismiss is that she reaches people\u2014and whether you agree with the way she discusses issues like class bigotry or not, the fact is, she does discuss them. Her awareness of them saturates her work, and it gets into people\u2019s heads\u2014because millions of people read her work.\n I guess what I\u2019m saying here is, look at Lenny Bruce. Look at George Carlin. The angrier they got, the less fun they got\u2014and the less effective they got, because nobody wants to listen to an old man cat-yell at the kids on his lawn.\n Oh, honey, I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re old. And I\u2019m not leaving you. You\u2019re a big part of my life, and I will always be here for you. I\u2019m just trying to make sure that you\u2019re always here for me, and sitting there in a toxic stew of your own bitterness . . . it\u2019s not good for you. Look at you. When was the last time you left the house? When was the last time you read something because it was fun, not because you thought it was good for you?\n Stern-lipped moral uprightness is not a literary value, darling. Sure, theme is. I\u2019m not disputing that. But did you know that John Gardner talked about this thing he called \u201cdisPollyanna Syndrome?\u201d He considered it a literary vice\u2014the cynical fallacy that the real world is unrelievedly bleak\u2014and he considered it as great a disservice to art as its opposite. And . . . he cited Harlan Ellison as a chief practitioner in this mode.\n Oh, I heard you gasp. But the New Wave is one of the primary influences on the way we live our life and do our work today. And also, I hear you say, Harlan was popular! And funny!\n Well, yes, he was funny. That\u2019s why he got away with it. But you? I feel like all we have anymore is pus and severed limbs and the eschaton. And that\u2019s not something we can build a future on, is it?\n Kind of by definition.\n I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s right\u2014and humane and morally correct\u2014to harbor a deep and abiding concern for the world around you. And that it\u2019s a perfectly normal\u2014even laudable!\u2014trait to express that concern and draw attention to problems by being savagely trenchant, witty, and sarcastic. Caustic, even. I want you to speak out. I want you to say what you mean.\n But sometimes lately, spending time with you is like having my face pressed down into a trough of human misery until the bubbles stop.\n You can have a sense of humor too. It\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll still like you. We\u2019ll still take you seriously. We just think it\u2019d be best for all of us if you could let yourself unbend just a little.\n I know. It\u2019s easier to get people to take you seriously when you\u2019re all grit and pus and urban decay\u2014or all gut wounds and bureaucratic incompetence, for that matter. It seems like a quick route to street cred. But the thing is, real people generally aren\u2019t miserable all the time. Even in horrible situations, they find ways to take a little pleasure, to crack jokes. Dying people and homicide cops and soldiers are generally really funny.\n I want us to have a little pleasure again too.\n And maybe we\u2019d have more friends if you weren\u2019t such a downer to be around all the time.\n Elizabeth Bear was born on the same day as Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, but in a different year.

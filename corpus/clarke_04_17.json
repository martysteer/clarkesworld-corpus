Previously, whenever I had vacation time, I\u2019d shift to full-time editor, so when I finally did quit, it just felt like one of those vacations: lots of work, little downtime. The same here, initially: I had a small mountain of tasks on my to-do list and I\u2019ve been head-down plowing through them. It\u2019s hard to notice your world has changed when you are that focused.\n It took nearly two months for me to clearly notice that this is my new life. I\u2019ve been doing some freelance consulting for my former employer\u2014a few hours here and there\u2014so I haven\u2019t fully disconnected from them. It\u2019s all been remote assistance, so when I stopped by to help them with a more difficult problem, I noticed that stress that I had felt while working there, was gone. While there, I talked with friends about the ongoing situation and I sympathized, but it didn\u2019t generate any anxiety. I walked to my car knowing that I was free.\n A few days later, I left for a week of back-to-back events completely related to my new life. The first was an academic symposium at Penn State, where I was the only industry professional presenting alongside academics. I didn\u2019t quite know what to expect. Despite working for over twenty-five years in academia, I never felt science fiction was welcome or respected. Being invited to participate was both flattering and frightening. In the end, I had a very positive experience, felt like I belonged, and learned a lot. Armed with that knowledge, I would have done things a little differently, but I have no regrets.\n From there, I drove home and then flew to ICFA, the International Conference for the Fantastic in the Arts, which I\u2019ve previously attended. While heavily academic in nature, ICFA has a significant number of authors and editors in attendance. I didn\u2019t have any presentations to make at this one, it was purely work social: four days in the Florida sun chatting with fellow attendees by the pool. In this context, vacation takes on yet another role closer to what the word is meant to be, but not quite.\n Coming back from all the travel was a return to my new routine. Taking care of a sick child, reading story submissions, sending out contracts, paying the insurance bill, vacuuming the house . . . This is my career now. It\u2019s no longer just what I do on the side. It\u2019s not a vacation, so maybe I need to add one of those to my to-do list. I like the sound of that.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

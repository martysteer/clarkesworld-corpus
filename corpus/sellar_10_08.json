The only blockage the police erected then was a flimsy perimeter round the protest area. But soon, downtown Seoul would fall into a nightly ritual of lockdown at sunset: the adjacent road leading to the Presidential Blue House were blockaded with dozens of grill-windowed \u201cchicken cage\u201d buses from around sundown until early morning. The day protests peaked, on June 10th1, they switched to stacks of greased and sand-filled shipping containers, but this overt symbol of economic globalization egged some protesters on, and waves of ridicule convinced them to switch back to using buses the next day.2 Riot police\u2014mostly college boys doing mandatory military service\u2014were constantly present: holed up in or behind the buses, marching in phalanx, sometimes being pummeled by protesters, and more often doing the pummeling.3 (And sometimes, during lulls, meeting their girlfriends in nearby coffeeshops.) Decontextualized images appeared online, fruiting memes: rampant police brutality, radical demonstrator violence.4\nIt\u2019s harder to describe the protesters. The rallies varied, sometimes utterly different from day to day, but they began gently. The evening of May 2nd felt like a street festival, a lively crowd chanting and singing with chotbul\u2014candles shrouded in paper cups\u2014in hand. Immediately, left- and right-wing media alike exaggerated the involvement of children in the movement, spinning fantasies of cynical child-exploitation or precocious futurist heroism. In reality, people from all walks of life, and of all ages\u2014grandparents, office workers, pregnant women, and, yes, teenagers\u2014had gathered, even on that first night. The crowds had chanted denunciations of the Korean media and their new President\u2014beseeching both to \u201cwake up,\u201d and decrying both as \u201cgarbage\u201d\u2014but they seemed less enraged or frightened than determined and optimistic, and hopeful that their President might listen to what they were saying.\nThey were talking about beef imports, and concessions he\u2019d made regarding U.S. beef import regulations. Mad cow disease was a focal concern. \u201cYou eat madcow!\u201d they ordered the President. It had the look of something bound to fizzle out in a week or two, one among many such protests here. Nobody guessed it would last over two months, paralyzing the government, that sometimes hundreds of thousands would march, that Catholic clergy, urging nonviolence, would lead Buddhists and Protestants into the fray, or that the discussion would dominate news, the Korean Internet, and classrooms.\nIt wasn\u2019t just about beef, though. This stew roiled and bubbled with political frustrations and fears. Also, certainly, a dash of nostalgia for the thrill of mass solidarity: hordes of red-clad Team Korea supporters had flooded the very same streets5 during the World Cup soccer tournament of 2002 to cheer, chant, and synchro-dance to looping techno too\u2014though, this time, the lyrics were taken from the National Constitution, repeatedly declaring: \u201cSouth Korea is a democratic nation . . . \u201d\nAnd another, subtler ingredient distinctly flavored this stew: a blend of SF and fantasy tropes, retooled for Korean society, which defined the rise and fall of this movement.\nMichin So\nIf you want a picture of what terrified Koreans about US beef, imagine a nation with a hoof stomping on it\u2014forever.\nAnd then picture a manically-grinning Korean politician riding on the back of that stomping michin so (\u201cmad cow\u201d), wearing a cowboy hat. It\u2019s oddly cartoon-like, this image, but it drew thousands onto the streets.\nFood is a huge deal in Korean society. People talk about food all the time. How hungry or full they are; whether this or that is delicious or not; what and when and where they\u2019re craving. One common greeting in Korean is, \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Food shows are popular on TV, and no Korean film is complete without characters sharing a meal.\nTraditional, essentially magical, concepts still linger. \u201cLong\u201d foods, like eel, are considered good for men\u2019s sexual \u201cstamina.\u201d Kids are given sticky foods before tests so memorized answers will \u201cstick\u201d in their minds. News reports routinely boast of \u201cscientific proof\u201d that kimchi, the emblematic Korean side dish, can fend off everything from SARS and bird flu to stomach cancer. Part of this mythology dictates that locally-produced foodstuffs are somehow healthier for Koreans than imports. Although not universal, this belief is widespread enough to help keep Korean foodstuffs on the market despite cheaper competition, like imported Australian beef.\nMy point isn\u2019t how wacky those gosh-darned Koreans are. It\u2019s just that food has a special importance in Korean culture, one unparalleled in America. Between food and politics, there\u2019s no contest: political apathy has spread like crabgrass since democracy supplanted dictatorship in the late 1980s. Participation in the last election was among the lowest of any since democracy was achieved here.\nSoon after Lee Myung Bak was inaugurated as President of South Korea, his approval ratings collapsed. One reason (of many) was a decision he\u2019d made as the Seoul\u2019s mayor\u2014not to bother with proper security\u2014contributed to the incineration of a major, treasured national monument called Namdaemun (\u201cThe Great South Gate\u201d)6 by a madman, only a week before Lee took office. His characteristically callous response didn\u2019t help matters.\nAs the monument goes, so goes the nation. Korean society takes inauspicious metonymy seriously. The national mood darkened; doom lurked on the horizon. Still, even then, only one thing could overcome the apathy and launch a sudden, mass political movement . . . a narrative about food.\nMad Cow, Mad Science, & Mad Scientists\nPD Diary is a tabloid TV show, specializing in moral panic over \u201cillicit\u201d foreigner-Korean sex, territorial disputes with Japan , ridiculous urban legends like \u201cfan death.\u201d7 Sometimes, they get things right: PD Diary outed Dr. Hwang Woo-Suk, Korea\u2019s fraudulent stem-cell researcher. But often, it\u2019s just tabloid TV.\nOn April 29th, 2008, PD Diaryaired an episode8 that was a recipe for panic, combining dystopianism, SF and fantasy tropes, and urban legends to get the political stew roiling furiously. After building a (sham) case upon mistranslations and outright deceptions \u201cproving\u201d a BSE epidemic among American cattle, and a hidden epidemic of variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in America, they unveiled their last, horrifying piece of \u201cevidence.\u201d It was a scientific paper by Korean researchers led by Hallym University\u2019s Dr. Jeong Byeong Hun that they claimed \u201cproved\u201d that 94% of Koreans were especially vulnerable to vCJD, because of a genetic predisposition determining how most Koreans synthesize amino acids.\nIt may sound bizarre, but it caught on for a reason: when Korean education was being rebuilt after the Japanese occupation, a new national consciousness was created upon a myth of racial identity.9 To this day, it echoes in classrooms: We Koreans are of one blood. We have withstood foreign invasions since time immemorial. Little surprise that the idea of a racial susceptibility to distinctly foreign contagion resonated so powerfully.\nBy the time Dr. Jeong\u2019s criticism of the misrepresentations came to light, it was too late: many imaginations, and protest-candles, were already aflame. Horrific visions of an insidious plague haunted the nation, sickness hibernating not only in meat, but in anything made with meat byproducts: choco-pies, tampons, soda-crackers, donuts. Slow death, invited by government policy! It was like something out of a dystopian SF movie . . .\nV for . . . Victory?\nOn June 5th, about a month into the demonstrations, a group of my media students presented their final course-project: a clever mashup juxtaposing clips from the Wachowski Brothers\u2019 film V for Vendetta widely circulated protest footage shot by demonstrators.10\nPresident Lee was recast as Chancellor Sutler, and Korean protesters merged with the crowd of masked citizens at the film\u2019s climax. Hilarious at moments\u2014the parody of Lee\u2019s haughty dismissal of public criticism is priceless\u2014the overall effect turns chilling with footage of police violence in late May: water cannons slamming people onto the ground (causing skull fractures and brain hemorrhages, injuries the chief of police declared were \u201cimpossible\u201d).11 Injured students. A boot stomping a girl\u2019s head.\nV was in the air; my fianc\u00e9e had noticed the film cropping up in netizen discussions of the protests even in late May\u2014a pattern that continues even now. By July 5th, the last big demonstration, two groups showed in costume\u2014one in plastic Guy Fawkes masks, the other wearing paper printouts held up with string. By all accounts\u2014even unsympathetic ones\u2014their approach was dramatic, as with participants in the recent, well-publicized protests of the Church of Scientology by \u201cAnonymous.\u201d12\nV was not received by these protesters as the anarchist figure of the Moore comic (which has not, anyway, been translated into Korean), but as the romantic, anti-Bush, and clearly anti-authoritarian Hollywood hero. Lee is no dictator, but for many his political party\u2019s genealogy leads back to South Korea\u2019s brutal past; Lee\u2019s direct competition for the Korean Grand National Party\u2019s 2007 presidential nomination was none other than the daughter of Park Chung-Hee, dictator of South Korea from 1961-1979. Lee\u2019s patronizing demeanour did nothing to dispel the link between him and the film\u2019s dictator, Chancellor Sutler.\nIt\u2019s not even V himself that captured protesters\u2019 imaginations: rather, it was the film\u2019s climactic moment when the frightened, apathetic public finally rose up, donned Guy Fawkes masks, and marched to the British Parliament. It\u2019s ironic: in V, the dictator manufactured public fear of a plague to take control of his nation. In Korea, fear of foreign contagion mobilized people, politicized them and got them out into the streets.\nMore ironically, members of this nationalist protest movement consciously adopted iconography from another American import\u2014a Hollywood SF film. They could instead easily have referenced images from the 2006 Korean blockbuster The Host, which told the story of a poor family fighting an all-consuming mutant monster and a lying, deceitful government intent on keeping up appearances. Or they could have referenced last year\u2019s political-tearjerker May 18, about the 1980 Kwangju Massacre of pro-democracy protesters. Yet, to articulate their criticisms, young demonstrators turned to specifically American pop culture, as if to reiterate what many individuals told me, assuming I was American: it\u2019s not about your country, and it\u2019s not really just about beef either.\n2MB vs. Candle Girl\nAll told, V remained a minor character. If the protests in Seoul were a video game, the iconic protagonist was Candle Girl, a cute little-kid mascot in a blue school uniform with a protester\u2019s candle gripped in one hand.13 And the Megaboss she battled against was 2MB, the grinning Korean President, riding upon a pale madcow.\nThe nickname \u201c2MB\u201d appeared online long before the protests, but was popularized on the street. In Korean, the words for \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cLee\u201d are homophones, so 2MB is a pun on Lee\u2019s initials, disparaging his mental \u201cdisk space.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a cyber-putdown for a cyber-generation, a part of Korea\u2019s first technoprotest ever: from an impeachment poll launched by a teenager before the protests began14, to the mass-emailed and phone-texted messages that facilitated demo-flashmobs, Korea\u2019s considerable wireless and internet telecom infrastructure defined these protests. Literature and poster icons were disseminated online; decentralized websites hosted debates, organization discussions, and advertised plans and organization15; protesters relied on online newsreports; events were webcast live to audiences of millions thanks to college kids armed with laptops and videocams; online photography clubs volunteered to document police brutality; online fund-raising drives self-organized to feed demonstrators; at one point, hackers even defaced Lee\u2019s GNP website with a picture of a dancing cat, a reference to another of Lee\u2019s epithets, jwi\u2014\u201crat.\u201d16\nEverywhere\u2014on T-shirts, posters, banners, and signs\u2014was the slogan \u201cLEE MYUNG BAK OUT.\u201d (Often, as \u201c2MB OUT.\u201d) It was a call for impeachment . . . sort of. Some people earnestly demanded impeachment, but others seemed to be using a tactic common to Korean culture, one I learned haggling in street markets: ask for more than you can really get. Many I talked to considered impeachment unrealistic, or at least highly unlikely. What they said they wanted was for Lee to take public opinion seriously.\nUnderstandably so, considering Lee\u2019s response to criticism: queried by journalists about his beef policy changes, he joked at one point that he \u201cmust\u2019ve done it in his sleep.\u201d He seriously asked of demonstrators, \u201cWho paid for the candles?\u201d17 But, then, the Korea he\u2019d been working on constructing was one where common people probably couldn\u2019tafford candles; a nation gutted of public services, thoroughly privatized, a relentlessly neoliberal Korea.\nThe wealthy ex-CEO Lee was elected because people hoped he would \u201csave the economy.\u201d Yet even many Lee supporters were dubious about his project proposals: switching public education over to English-language instruction; privatizing health insurance and water; building a transpeninsular transport canal bound for economic and ecological disaster. Many felt Lee\u2019s governing style was toomuch like a CEO\u2019s,. By June, his approval ratings had dropped to 17%18.\nBack when he was mayor of Seoul, Lee decided\u2014apparently without consulting the millions of Buddhists, atheists, and other non-Christians in the city\u2014to \u201cdedicate\u201d the city to God and declare its citizens \u201cGod\u2019s People.\u201d19\n2MB\u2019s opponents, obviously, held no monopoly on grandiose fantasy.\nThe Aftermath\nThe roads are now clear of all but a small core of diehard activists, and though they continue to gather semi-regularly, the mass movement behind the anti-2MB demonstrations has dissolved . . . for now. Legal proceedings have begun20, concessions have been made, and the streets are (mostly) quiet. No longer do young women joke about trying the \u201cchotbuldiet\u201d plan. The food stands and devil-horn vendors have moved on, and the candles have mostly been extinguished. Fear of US beef is waning, and the masses have gone back to their daily lives.\nProtest organizers have been accused of manipulating public fears. However true this is, it smacks of the pot calling the kettle black. Public fear of U.S. beef were exacerbated, from the beginning, but the protest organizers weren\u2019t the only manipulators. Protesters denounced Korea\u2019s biggest newspapers as manipulative \u201ctrash.\u201d Within a week of the last big rally, two major newspapers were forced to apologize for staging photos that accompanied stories claiming the tide of US beef fears having turned already.21 There\u2019s blame enough to go around: Lee\u2019s patronizing attitude, police violence, a minority of violent, extremist radicals, and corrupt media across the political spectrum.\nKorean SF fans are, predictably, seeing things a little differently. The \u201cPolitique\u201d column of Korea\u2019s biggest SF magazine, Fantastique22, was abuzz this summer, ranging from discussions of the use of \u201czombie\u201d imagery to describe both protesters and the threat of vCJD, exploring the dangers of an Avian Influenza H5N1 pandemic23, and stressing the positive power of \u201crumors\u201d or \u201cfears\u201d to awaken and overcome \u201cblind\u201d government-urged complacency and raise public concern over other potential disease outbreaks like SARS and H5N1.\nPerhaps it\u2019s no accident that the National Film Archive recently ran a retrospective on Korean gwaesu (giant monster) movies. Watching gargantuan monstrosities attack both Seoul and tiny villages, images of the protests ran through my mind. The threat posed by the rampaging horrors in all of these films seemed to be exacerbated by the inept, stupid, or arrogant government and military officials \u201chandling\u201d the situation.\nMost resonant with the protests was the conclusion of the Korean monster movie The Host. The scene set up a sequel\u2014though apparently the upcoming 2009 release will be a prequel set during Lee\u2019s stint as mayor of Seoul24\u2014but it also captures the mood of many who participated in the biggest mass demonstrations. After the rampaging monster has been taken down, the protagonist goes on with his life, but remains wary, staring out into the gloomy darkness of the river from which the beast once emerged. President Lee may not (quite) be a mutant horror risen from the Han River, but many, though once again at home and relaxing, are even now gazing out their windows toward the Blue House with similar wariness.\nWill there be a sequel to 2MB vs. Candlegirl? In the immediate future, it seems unlikely: the weather\u2019s terribly hot these days, and other political crises loom, especially the current flare-up of a long-running territorial dispute with Japan. The masses seem critical of the hardcore protesters who remain active. Still, if Lee does risk another round at the joystick, we can be sure he\u2019ll have new tricks up his sleeve.\nThough he may not realize it, so will the people. They\u2019ve beaten harder games than this before, taken down a much worse megaboss than Lee. And if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in all my visits to PC-bangs here, it\u2019s that when they play a game, Koreans play to win.\nENDNOTES:\n1. Police estimated 80,000 participants, while organizers estimated half a million. Neither number is reasonably reliable, though perhaps the average of the two estimates might be closer to the truth.\n2. The shipping containers were dubbed Myungbaksanseong\u2014\u201c[President Lee] Myung Bak\u2019s Fortress\u201d by netizens, and the term was popularized in newspapers soon after.\n5. Indeed, these same streets have been the site of many important social and political events for more than a century. See here for more: http://populargusts.blogspot.com/2008/06/protests-public-space-in-seoul-and.html\n6. Namdaemun\u2019s proper name, Sungnyemun, suddenly was in vogue, but only after its incineration. http://www.nowpublic.com/world/south-koreas-top-national-treasure-was-burnt-down\n9. See Chapter 2 of Michael J. Seth\u2019s Education Fever: Society, Politics, and The Pursuit of Schooling in South Korea (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 2002).\n11. An M.D. friend of my fianc\u00e9e treated one of water cannon victims for brain hemorrhage, and when she reported it online, the story was widely read and taken by many as a refutation Seoul Police Chief\u2019s claims. Many more people suffered from ruptured tympanic membranes, and video documentation and eyewitness testimony suggest that the water cannons were sometimes improperly used. Online fundraising began immediately to help pay for those protester surgeries, especially for teenagers who could not afford it. Angry protesters and netizens responded to the Chief of Police\u2019s claim that the water cannon could not cause serious harm by suggesting that he ought to use one as a bidet.\n17. When the protests began, Lee was visiting China. When he returned home and government officials attempted to inform him of the situation, he reportedly said, \u201cI know, I know, I use the Internet too. But tell me one thing: who bought all the candles?\u201d Protestors replied with retorts such as, \u201cSure! It\u2019s the candle manufacturers that are behind us!\u201d\n19. Indeed, many have argued that one reason Lee won the Presidency was his mobilization of Protestant Christians in his favor. Lee has associated with those who pray for the Buddhist temples in Korea to crumble (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Myung_Bak#Christianity), and indeed a newer map of Seoul issued by his government has, bizarrely, omitted all references to Buddhist temples (http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200806/200806240026.html). Few believe this was really a \u201cmistake.\u201d Buddhist participation in the protests surged toward the end of June, and, indeed, unlike in the democracy movement of 1987\u2014where organizers took sanctuary in Myeongdong Cathedral\u2014those facing arrest in 2008 took refuge in the nearby Chogye Buddhist Temple. (http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2008/2924/)\n22. \u201cPolitique.\u201d Fantastique, Vol 14-16 (June-August 2008). Excerpts are currently available online, in Korean, for June and July (http://fantastique.co.kr/issue/issue_special_view.asp?num=83).\n23. Understandably so: just in May 2008 there were indeed two major outbreaks among poultry of Avian Influenza H5N1 in the area of Seoul. http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/may1208seoul.html\n24. As reported at ScifiJapan, the scriptwriter is a famous Korean webcomic artist known as Kangfull, among whose works is a comic titled 26 Years that imagines a group of assassins who seek to avenge democracy protesters (and presumably loved ones) killed in the Kwangju Massacre by killing the dictator of the time, Chun Doo Hwan. (Incidentally, Chun is still alive in Seoul today, but with considerable security expenses.) The script, reportedly set in the same place as the first 2MB demonstrations were held\u2014an urban stream that Lee \u201crevivified\u201d rapidly, and thus turned into an artificial, electricity-consuming, ecological mess, ostensibly for the sake of his political legacy \u2013 may well be less than generous with the President\u2019s political legacy.\nGord Sellar was born in Malawi, raised in Canada, and has lived in South Korea since 2002, where he has taught at universities, played saxophone in an indie-rock band, and worked as a writer, editor, and co-translator.

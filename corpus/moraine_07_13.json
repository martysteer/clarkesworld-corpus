It\u2019s almost like a script you can follow. You don\u2019t have to think too much about it.\n Just let it in. Let it watch you at night. Tell it everything it wants to know. These are the things it wants, and you\u2019ll let it have those things to keep it around. Hovering over your bed, all sleek chrome and black angles that defer the gaze of radar. It\u2019s a cultural amalgamation of one hundred years of surveillance. There\u2019s safety in its vagueness. It resists definition. This is a huge part of its power. This is a huge part of its appeal.\n Fucking a drone isn\u2019t like what you\u2019d think. It\u2019s warm. It probes, gently. It knows where to touch me. I can lie back and let it do its thing. It\u2019s only been one date but a drone isn\u2019t going to worry about whether I\u2019m an easy lay. A drone isn\u2019t tied to the conventions of gendered sexual norms. A drone has no gender and, if it comes down to it, no sex. Just because it can do it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a thing that it has.\n We made a kind of conversation, before, at dinner. I did most of the talking, which I expected.\n The drone hums as it fucks me. We\u2014the dronesexual, the recently defined, though we only call ourselves this name to ourselves and only ever with the deepest irony\u2014we\u2019re never sure whether the humming is pleasure or whether it\u2019s a form of transmission, but we also don\u2019t really care. We gave up caring what other people, people we probably won\u2019t ever meet, think of us. We talk about this on message boards, in the comments sections of blogs, in all the other places we congregate, though we don\u2019t usually meet face to face. There are no dronesexual support groups. We don\u2019t have conferences. There is no established discourse around who we are and what we do. No one writes about us but us, not yet.\n The drones probably don\u2019t do any writing. But we know they talk.\n Drones don\u2019t come, not as far as we can tell, but they must get satisfaction out of it. They must get something. I have a couple of orgasms, in the laziest kind of fashion, and the vibration of the maybe-transmission humming tugs me through them. I rub my hands all over that smooth conceptual hardware and croon.\n There was no singular point in time at which the drones started fucking us. We didn\u2019t plan it, and maybe it wasn\u2019t even a thing we consciously wanted until it started happening. Sometimes a supply creates a demand.\n But when something is around that much, when it knows that much, it\u2019s hard to keep your mind from wandering in that direction. I wonder what that would feel like inside me. One kind of intimacy bleeds into another. Maybe the drones made the first move. Maybe we did. Either way, we were certainly receptive. Receptive, because no one penetrates drones. They fuck men and women with equal willingness, and the split between men and women in our little collectivity is, as far as anyone has ever been able to tell, roughly fifty-fifty. Some trans people, some genderfluid, and all permutations of sexual preference represented by at least one or two members. The desire to fuck a drone seems to cross boundaries with wild abandon. Drones themselves are incredibly mobile and have never respected borders.\n Here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re not going to get too attached. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll have to work to keep from doing, because it\u2019s hard to attach to a drone. But on some level there is a kind of attachment, because the kind of closeness you experience with a drone isn\u2019t like anything else. It\u2019s not like a person. They come into you; they know you. You couldn\u2019t fight them off even if you wanted to. Which you never do. Not really.\n We fight, not because we have anything in particular to fight over, but because it sort of seems like the thing to do.\n No one has ever come out and admitted to trying to have a relationship with the drone that\u2019s fucking them, but of course everyone knows it\u2019s happened. There are no success stories, which should say something in itself, and people who aren\u2019t in our circle will make faces and say things like you can\u2019t have a relationship with a machine no matter how many times it makes you come but a drone isn\u2019t a dildo. It\u2019s more than that.\n So of course people have tried. How could you not?\n This isn\u2019t a relationship, but the drone stayed the night after fucking me, humming in the air right over my bed as I slept, and it was there when I woke up. I asked it what it wanted and it drifted toward the kitchen, so I made us some eggs which of course only I could eat.\n It was something about the way it was looking at me. I just started yelling, throwing things.\n Fighting with a drone is like fucking a drone in reverse. It\u2019s all me. The drone just dodges, occasionally catches projectiles at an angle that bounces them back at me, and this might amount to throwing. All drones carry two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, neatly resized as needed, because all drones are collections of every assumption we\u2019ve ever made about them, but a drone has never fired a missile at anyone they were fucking.\n This is no-stakes fighting. I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019m yelling about. After a while the drone drifts out the window. I cry and scream for it to call me. I order a pizza and spend the rest of the day in bed.\n Here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re not going to ask too many questions. You\u2019re just going to let it happen. You\u2019ll never know whose eyes are behind the blank no-eyes that see everything. There might not be any anymore; drones regularly display what we perceive as autonomy. In all our concepts of droneness there is hardly ever a human being on the other end. So there\u2019s really no one to direct the questions to.\n Anyway, what the hell would you ask? What are we doing, why are we this way? Since when have those ever been answers you could get about this kind of thing?\n This is really sort of a problem. In that I\u2019m focusing too much on a serial number and a specific heat signature that only my skin can know. In that I asked the thing to call me at all. I knew people tried things like this but it never occurred to me that it might happen without trying.\n It does call me. I talk for a while. I say things I\u2019ve never told anyone else. It\u2019s hard to hang up. That night while I\u2019m trying to sleep I stare up at the ceiling and the dark space between me and it feels so empty.\n I pass them out on the street, humming through the air. They avoid me with characteristic deftness but after a while it occurs to me that I\u2019m steering myself into them, hoping to make contact. They all look the same but I know they aren\u2019t the same at all. I\u2019m looking for that heat signature. I want to turn them over so I can find that serial number, nestled in between the twin missiles, over the drone dick that I\u2019ve never actually seen.\n Everyone around me might be a normal person who doesn\u2019t fuck a drone and doesn\u2019t want to and doesn\u2019t talk to them on the phone and usually doesn\u2019t take them to dinner. Or every one of them could be like that.\n At some point we all stopped talking to each other.\n Here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. Here\u2019s what you\u2019re not going to do. Here\u2019s a list to make it easy for you.\n You\u2019re not going to spend the evening staring out the window. You\u2019re not going to toy endlessly with your phone. You\u2019re not going to masturbate furiously and not be able to come. You\u2019re not going to throw the things you threw at nothing at all. You\u2019re not going to stay up all night looking at images and video that you can only find on a few niche paysites. You\u2019re not going to wonder if you need to go back into therapy because you don\u2019t need therapy. You\u2019re not going to wonder if maybe you and people like you might be the most natural people in the entire world, given the way the world is now. You\u2019re not going to wonder if there was ever such a thing as natural.\n Sometimes I wonder what it might be like to be a drone. This feels like a kind of blasphemy, and also pointless, but I do it anyway. So simple, so connected. So in tune. Needed instead of the one doing the needing. Possessing all the power. Subtly running more and more things until I run everything. The subjects of total organic surrender.\n Bored, maybe, with all that everything. Playing some games.\n It comes over. We fuck again and it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m almost crying by the end. It nestles against me and hums softer and I wonder how screwed I actually am in how many different ways.\n Anyway, it stays the night again and we don\u2019t fight in the morning.\n A drone wedding. I want to punch myself in the mouth twenty or thirty times for even thinking that even for a second.\n It starts coming every night. This is something I know I shouldn\u2019t get used to but I know that I am. As I talk to it\u2014before sex, during, after\u2014I start to remember things that I\u2019d totally forgotten. Things from my early childhood, things from high school that I didn\u2019t want to remember. I tell with tears running down my face and at the end of it I feel cleaned out and raw.\n I don\u2019t want this to be over, I say. I have no idea what the drone wants and it doesn\u2019t tell me, but I want to believe that the fact that it keeps coming back means something.\n I read the message boards and I wish I could tell someone else about this because I feel like I\u2019m losing every shred of perspective. I want to talk about how maybe we\u2019ve been coming at this from all the wrong angles. Maybe we should all start coming out. Maybe we should form political action groups and start demanding recognition and rights. I know these would all be met with utterly blank-screen silence but I want to say them anyway. I write a bunch of things that I never actually post, but I don\u2019t delete them either.\n We\u2019re all like this. I\u2019m absolutely sure that we\u2019re all like this and no one is talking about it but in all of our closets is a thing hovering, humming, sleek and black and chrome with its missiles aimed at nothing.\n We have one more huge fight. Later I recognize this as a kind of self-defense. I\u2019m screaming and beating at it with my fists, something about commitment that I\u2019m not even sure that I believe, and it\u2019s just taking it, except for the moments when it butts me in the head to push me back. I\u2019m shrieking about its missiles, demanding that it go ahead and vaporize my entire fucking apartment, put me out of my misery, because I can\u2019t take this anymore because I don\u2019t know what to do. We have angry sex and it leaves. It doesn\u2019t call me again. I stay in bed for two days and call a therapist.\n Here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do.\n You\u2019re going to do what you told yourself you had the courage to do and say everything. You\u2019re going to let it all out to someone flesh and blood and you\u2019re going to hear what they say back to you. For once you\u2019re not going to be the one doing all the talking. You\u2019re going to be honest. You\u2019re going to be the one to start the whole wheel spinning back in the other direction. You\u2019re going to fix everything because you have the power to fix everything. You\u2019re going to give this all a name and say it like you\u2019re proud. You\u2019re going to bust open a whole new paradigm. You\u2019re going to be missile-proof and bold and amazing and you\u2019re not going to depend on the penetrative orgasmic power of something that never loved you anyway.\n I stop at the door. I don\u2019t even make it into the waiting room.\n I fiddle with the buttons on my coat. I check my phone for texts, voicemail. I look down the street at all those beautiful humming flying things. I feel a tug in the core of me where everything melts down into a hot lump and spins like a dynamo. I feel like I can\u2019t deny everything. I feel like I don\u2019t want to. I feel that the flesh is treacherous and doomed.\n I made this promise to myself and it takes me half an hour on a bus and five minutes of staring at a name plaque and a glass door to realize that I don\u2019t want to keep it.\n I look back out at everyone and I consider what it could be like to step through those doors, sit in a softly lit room with tissues and a lot of pastel and unthreatening paintings on the wall and spill it all and look up and see the therapist nodding, nodding knowingly, mouthing the words me too.\n I don\u2019t really think anyone can help any of us.\n Here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to stop worrying. You\u2019re going to stop asking questions. You\u2019re going to stop planning for tomorrow. You\u2019re going to go out and get laid and stop wondering what might have been. You\u2019re going to stop trying to fix anything. You\u2019re going to stop assuming there\u2019s anything to be fixed.\n You\u2019re going to look out at all those drones and not wonder. You\u2019re going to look out at all those people and you\u2019re going to know. Even though no one is talking.\n Me too. Me too.

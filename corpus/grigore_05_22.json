Careful, don\u2019t spill it.\u201d\n People would never have guessed what a feat of engineering making mud on a spaceship was. Filter the air, make the water, grind dirt, add silt, scatter sand, and not the kind with glass in it. Make sure to divide it all up again once the mud has served its purpose. Once a commodity, now a scientific compromise amid dwindling resources. Well, as they said, another man\u2019s treasure . . .\n Besides, today\u2019s picnic was in the greenhouse. There was bound to be mud.\n \u201cPer\u2019s making stew!\u201d\n \u201cYes, he is. Don\u2019t let him run out of leaves.\u201d\n Leaves, too, were a wonder. To get leaves, you needed a tree. To get a tree, you needed soil, light, air, water, good irrigation, working filters, an airtight glasshouse, consistent light cycles, and an enormous engine power to sustain all these. And if all the trees had rotted down and broke apart, you also needed a seed. Two, if you were lucky. And you needed to start the process all over again, fretting at every twang and fribble. Until the glasshouse became green again, leaf by marvelous leaf.\n They had enough today. A dozen leaves weren\u2019t going to deplete their oxygen reserves.\n \u201cCara is baking biscuits again!\u201d\n \u201cOf course. Save me a reindeer one.\u201d\n Biscuits? Biscuits were simply a miracle.\n So far, they had three shapes available, saved from the wreck that used to be the kitchen annex: heart, reindeer, and octopus. And for the life of them, they had never figured out how to keep the last one from burning to a crisp every single time. But it was good to have a non-life-and-death purpose. They would make it work someday.\n \u201cWhat is Remi making?\u201d\n \u201cOh, I dunno, let me think.\u201d\n They did a head count before slipping out of the greenhouse. Six bobbing, swaying, giggling heads, leaning over their various tiny workstations. Six? Seven. Nini had bent down to pick up a rock.\n All accounted for. Remi rushed along the corridor, the wheels in their feet skidding. One corner, two, past the old dormitories, the infirmary door boarded-up with get-well cards, the science-rooms-turned-art-project-galleries\u2014when all you had was metal walls, the whole world was your fridge door\u2014across the main deck, past the eternally confused retina scan, and into the memory archive.\n A thousand inputs and connectors glinted underneath their lamp, not dusty but sighing with disuse. The buttons for the shelving drawers had rusted shut a while back, but they could still be opened if you knew where to stick your fingers and pull. A lot.\n Let\u2019s see, what will it be today? Remi leafed through memory chips at random, looking for one they hadn\u2019t tried before. Or they had, but not for this. Not for stealing recipes. They picked one and inserted it in the port behind their ear. Then pressed fast-forward.\n For the last party, they\u2019d made a souffl\u00e9. Dusted gold on the outside, gooey in the middle. Crust cracking under their spoons and steam rising in ringlets in the air, underneath the purple-green nebula sky. The kids had oohed and aahed and burned their tongues and grimaced and laughed as the powdery cheese melted through it.\n Before that, baba ganoush from the one and only eggplant they\u2019d ever grown. Lacking a grill, they\u2019d roasted it on the discarded door of an emergency pod. They\u2019d spent ages watching its skin turn dark and smoky, its insides softening. Peeled it clumsily and mashed it to a light, creamy texture. Squeezed a lemon, for they had lemons. Sprinkled make-believe garlic and cumin powder and served it all on the bread the kids had made that day.\n Before that, peach cobbler with frozen cream that mimicked the gas plumes outside the observatory. Before that, ginger-carrot soup hot enough to turn their cheeks red. Mushroom pilaf with roasted walnuts, eggless eggy-bread buried under mounds of sugar, lemon bars tart enough to bring tears to their eyes.\n What would it be today? The memories flashed behind their eyes like dreams, whirring at the back of their skull and warming their core processor. Farther, farther. They would make something good, something hearty. It was a special occasion, after all.\n They\u2019d chosen today to be their birthday.\n \u201cRemi\u2019s back!\u201d\n \u201cYes, I am.\u201d They carried their armful of pots, pans, and cutting boards to the closest empty table. \u201cAnd I need some help with this one, alright? You know old Remi has trouble with pressure levels.\u201d\n \u201cLike the fruit juicer in the old canteen,\u201d Lou snickered.\n \u201cYes, exactly, thank you for that comparison,\u201d Remi said amid giggles and pulled up a screen while they still had their attention. \u201cAlright, here\u2019s what I need! Who\u2019s done and can help?\u201d\n Seven pairs of small and grubby hands rose in the air. Remi squinted, or did the closest approximation to it, and reminded them of the lost art of oven-watching. That halved the show of hands but left enough volunteers to cause some bumps and accidents as they gathered bell peppers and tomatoes or dug around for carrots and onions.\n Remi had just painstakingly gathered a full bowl of mostly unscathed mushrooms when they noticed the commotion in the corner of the greenhouse. Cara, Mat, and Nini were huddled around the monitors there, going through the motions of biting their nails and tugging at their hair. Anxious, then.\n By the time Remi reached their side, they seemed half a moment away from full-on panic. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cRemi, something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Cara said, pointing at the blinking screens.\n Remi froze, several parts of them grinding erratically. Across the years, remisomethingswrong had meant everything from a cake not rising well to disastrous engine failure. Remi almost didn\u2019t want to look. But they had to. There was no one else left.\n Angry red text rolled over all the monitoring displays. At first, they thought it signaled a breach in the greenhouse walls, which would\u2019ve meant it was too late for any of them. But then they saw it was actually a disengagement warning. Leaning around the kids to type in a few manual commands, they brought up the ship map.\n Their section was blessedly green, along with the main deck and the corridors connecting to the old habitation and medical centers. All around, there were dark patches, the annexes the system had closed off over the years in order to keep its steadily dwindling parameters optimal for life support. Another one was marked red now. System failure, preparing to disconnect.\n \u201cAlright,\u201d Remi said. \u201cAlright. Everyone, please gather close! Turn off any heat sources, and then gather close!\u201d\n The commotion gave them a few moments to run through several speeches in their head. Not that they would be saying anything new.\n \u201cOkay, so the ship is telling us it has to disconnect the recreation wing.\u201d Desolate sighs and whimpers rose in the air like flour clouds, spreading everywhere. \u201cNo, no, we talked about this, remember? We knew it might happen, there\u2019s a lot of machinery in there. Now, I want everyone to think if they have anything they want to take out before it locks down, alright? There\u2019s still time to get them, we have\u2014\u201d Remi checked the screen. \u201c\u2014around two hours. Deep breaths, think it through. We\u2019ve been through all this before.\u201d\n In the end, they all decided to go. It was more or less inevitable, ever since the eight of them ended up the last ones left. Better to stick together. They passed the library, the medbay, the staff room. It kind of stirred Remi\u2019s old guide module back to life. Here, the charter from when the ship was a long-distance transport. Here, the observation hubs added when its ancient thrusters made it only fit as a tour bus for the nebula. Here, the storage rooms retrofitted as a lobby when the thrusters died and the ship became a children\u2019s museum instead.\n Always prepared to fit all needs. Fresh produce, clear views, tireless tour guides to tell you where you were and how you got there, memory recorders if you wanted to leave a memento, latest generation playmates for your kids, they will never be able to tell the difference. All too fiddly, too needy, too outdated to take away when the engine reached the end of its life cycle.\n \u201cI want my bunny,\u201d Mat said, picking at a scab on his finger, tissue glinting blue underneath unhealing synthetic skin.\n Remi petted his hair. Gently, not letting their uncooperative finger joints miscalculate their strength. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s where you left it during our last movie.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you want to get, Remi?\u201d Oli asked from behind.\n \u201cI want . . . Oh, I guess I want my old projector. Been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n All the lights around the recreation wing flashed red when they got to it, but they only needed a bit of fiddling to settle down to a demure yellow. Remi led them in and the treasure hunt began.\n One eye on the clock, they let the kids scamper around for a while as they gathered anything that might prove useful in the long run. Nuts, bolts, small devices they could scavenge for parts, that fizzy soda nobody had wanted to try, all the pillows they\u2019d patched up with old staff uniforms. They loaded them all up in a cart and emptied it periodically in the closest storage unit.\n Not how Remi had expected to spend their birthday, but it was all in a day\u2019s work.\n \u201cMovie night pajamas,\u201d they started counting when they had less than one time unit left. The kids milled about. \u201cSlippers, any toys if you left them here. Joint oil, yes, you know we\u2019re running low. Lou, you can\u2019t bring that whole thing with you, it\u2019s too heavy!\u201d\n \u201cRemi, what about this?\u201d\n Ava held up a play book. It contained all the information available about the near universe, distilled down for kids, along with a vast handpicked collection of games, puzzles, and tests to stir all neural synapses. For a group of crafty, yet easily bored kids, it was a lifesaver. That is, if they could open it.\n \u201cNot good, you know you need a social identifier to use that.\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s not fair . . . \u201d\n \u201cI know. Look around some more? There\u2019s still time.\u201d\n Remi wasn\u2019t angry, but mainly because Remi had long since set their anger suppression as far as it could go. Despite that, they still felt something burn at the back of their skull on a routine basis.\n They focused on scouring the rest of the wing for anything the kids might have missed instead. They knew better than anyone how easy it was to accidentally leave scrap behind.\n With the ship buzzing and whirring with the lockdown procedure, getting everything back on track proved to be a struggle. Put everything salvaged out of everyone\u2019s way, check on every kid, wheedle them back to the greenhouse, scan the ship for any anomalies, check on every kid again, and remind them what they were doing before this fiasco.\n Even after Remi turned up a cheery tune to mask the droning alerts, they all still stared morosely at their pots and pans. Every sigh like an added weight on their processor. They waited for the dreaded but imminent question, and it did not take long for it to arise.\n \u201cRemi? What if the greenhouse is next?\u201d\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no need to worry just now. It takes a long time for that surplus energy to be depleted. I\u2019d say we\u2019re quite safe for a while,\u201d they said to a roomful of terse silence. That was not what they needed to hear. Remi turned around. \u201cWould you feel better if we started making seed reserves and hid them on the main deck?\u201d\n After some cogitation, they all nodded. Remi did too.\n \u201cAlright, then that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing tomorrow. But today,\u201d they brandished a spatula with perhaps too much cheer, \u201cwe have a very special party to host, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n That unwound them a bit.\n They ran over the ingredients list again and picked up from where they left off. Seven golden bell peppers, washed with the utmost care. A handful of tomatoes, peeled and chopped to a pulp. A couple perky carrots and onions, finely grated in record time. Remi passed Oli and Lou the mushrooms for competitive dicing while they cored and seeded the peppers.\n And just like that, it was peaceful. Just a bit. Just enough to imagine everything might be alright. This is what Remi loved about cooking: all you had to think of was the immediate reality. And this immediate reality contained something that, by the kids\u2019 own admissions, smelled very good indeed.\n For a moment, everything was alright.\n Then Ava started shouting that the rice had stuck to the pan again, and Nini complained that nobody listened to her about how to roast the peppers, and Per\u2019s knife slipped so far that it almost took his whole finger off, and Remi had to solder it in place before the synapses gave out.\n And that was better than alright. That was normal.\n They sent the kids back to their own worktables for the last part, to either finish or clean what they\u2019d set out to make. And as they all bustled about, Remi set to stuff the peppers. It took a bit longer than they would have liked, their hands squeezing too tightly and pushing all the filling out on more than a couple occasions, but they saw it through. Lightly cooked rice and veggies on the inside, bright tomato sauce on the outside. Cover it all up and let it simmer until done.\n They cleared a spot near the glassy wall of the greenhouse and set around blankets, pillows, plates, and cutlery. The icky soda Remi had salvaged from recreation made them all turn up their noses, but nobody said no. Remi guessed that was what you got when your inventor gave you taste buds for authenticity\u2019s sake: sometimes you had to try the less savory stuff too, just to figure out what you liked.\n At least no one looked sad anymore by the time they shared the peppers around. Fights over spoons ensued, tongues were burned, cheeks begrimed. But they all hummed and grinned once they had their first bites.\n Remi couldn\u2019t smile, so they made the light in their face appear pinker instead.\n \u201cAlright,\u201d Cara turned to the others. \u201cNow let\u2019s tell Remi what it tastes like!\u201d\n A chorus of voices assaulted them, filled the greenhouse up to the very top, compliments and praises louder than any alarm. They described the flavors and textures in excruciating detail, they waxed poetic about the smells. Remi had no way of comprehending any of it, nothing to compare it to, but they did have all those memories they\u2019d seen, all those feelings recorded in them. They understood well enough.\n \u201cHappy birthday, Remi!\u201d Nini said. The chorus rose again. Happybirthdayremi.\n \u201cWhat present do you want?\u201d\n Remi floundered. \u201cOh, I dunno. What does everyone want? Maybe we can make a group wish of it.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not how birthdays work, Remi!\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t it? Mine does, so let\u2019s think of something,\u201d they said, turning pinker again.\n They all grumbled and blew bubbles into their soda while Remi waited. After a while passed with no suggestions, they took pity on them and pushed the empty dishes aside, brought the pillows closer, and leaned against one of their mangled pear trees, arm extended. It didn\u2019t take long for the kids to take their cue and pile up on both sides of them. Giggles and grumbles mixed with the swish of fabric and the sharp whine of metal on metal, where Remi\u2019s appendages met with the various scrapes and tears in their skin layer.\n \u201cThen how about this,\u201d they said when everyone seemed to be comfortable. \u201cTomorrow, after we\u2019re done gathering seeds, we can start thinking about what memory we want to record. One each.\u201d\n \u201cFor the archive?\u201d\n \u201cYep.\u201d\n Hums and murmurs mixed with the mostly steady thrum of the air filters.\n \u201cBut how do we choose?\u201d\n \u201cWe think really hard.\u201d\n \u201cWhat can it be about?\u201d\n \u201cAnything,\u201d Remi said. They raised their head to watch the nebula. \u201cWe can take it one meal at a time.\u201d\n Adriana C. Grigore is a writer from the windswept plains of Romania.

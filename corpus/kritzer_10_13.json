Even a successful sex-toy manufacturer like Squishies (tm) is still run out of a single office attached to a warehouse, and the staff consists of Julia (the owner), Juan (the guy who does all the warehouse stuff), and me (the person who does everything else).\n(You are probably wondering right now if that includes product testing. I make it a habit not to talk about my sex life with strangers but Julia requires that everyone she hires take home a Squishie or a Firmie or one of the other IntelliFlesh products and try it out, either solo or with a partner. I pointed out that if she ever hired an alien\u2014sorry, \u201cextraterrestrial immigrant\u201d\u2014the neurology doesn\u2019t match up, and does she want to admit she discriminates in hiring? But I didn\u2019t argue that hard, because hey, free sex toy, why not? Frankly, I found it a kind of freaky experience, having this piece of sensate flesh that didn\u2019t really belong there, and after a little bit of experimentation I stuck it in a drawer and haven\u2019t touched it since.)\nAnyway, we outsource the manufacturing and the boxes of Squishies and Firmies get shipped to us on shrink-wrapped pallets and Juan breaks them down to re-ship in more manageable quantities to the companies that resell our products.\nThe original product were the Squishies, and Julia is not at ALL shy about people knowing about her sex life (we have an instructional video, and she\u2019s IN it) so I don\u2019t mind telling you that she came up with it because her boyfriend at the time had a fetish for really large breasts, we\u2019re not talking \u201cnaturally gifted\u201d or even \u201cenhanced with silicone\u201d but \u201ctruly impractical for all real-world purposes like breathing and using your arms,\u201d and conveniently at the time she was working at a company making top-of-the-line prosthetics with neural integration. She made herself a really enormous set of breasts and after a lot of futzing with the neural integration she got them to be sensate. Then the boyfriend dumped her and she didn\u2019t really need them anymore, but her friend who\u2019d had a double mastectomy said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you make me a smaller set?\u201d and that, supposedly, was when it occurred to her that maybe she could make this product to SELL. She found a manufacturing facility and office space, hired me and Juan, and went into the Fully Sensate Attachable Flesh business.\nDepending on your predilections you may already be wondering why she started with boobs. IntelliFlesh is re-shapable, at least up to a point, and since I was the Customer Service department I started getting calls from people who wanted to reshape it into something longer, stiffer, and pointier.\n\u201cJulia,\u201d I said one day, taking off my headset, \u201cYou need to start making strap-on dicks.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t call those Squishies,\u201d she said dismissively.\n\u201cSo? Roll out a new line. Hardies. Dickies. Cockies. If you go with Cockies you can say \u2018like cookies, only better\u2019 in the ads.\u201d Maybe I should note that one of the few things Julia doesn\u2019t let me do is write the ad copy.\nThe Firmies were an even bigger seller than the Squishies. Between boobs and dicks, we had most users covered, but every now and then I got a call from someone who wanted something a little more customized.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve reached Afton Enterprises, home of Squishies and Firmies,\u201d I said. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d (In addition to not getting to write the ad copy, I don\u2019t get to decide how to answer the phone, judging from the fact that Julia shot down the greeting, \u201cHow may I improve your sex life today?\u201d)\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about buying either a Squishie or a Firmie, and I . . . had some questions,\u201d the woman said, her voice hesitant. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of expensive and I\u2019m not sure which will meet my needs.\u201d\n\u201cWell, the Squishie is squishier,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s more malleable, but it also doesn\u2019t tend to hold alternate shapes for very long unless you refrigerate it for a while before you get started. The Firmie arrives long and narrow, but if you want it to have a different shape\u2014say, a curve or even a hook\u2014you can gently heat it up and mold it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I want is a prosthetic vagina,\u201d the woman blurted out. \u201cIn a different spot.\u201d\nYou\u2019re not really supposed to say, \u201cyou want what?\u201d to customers when you\u2019re doing customer support for a sex toy shop. We are pro-sex, pro-kink, and anti-shame: there is officially no wrong way to have sex. So: \u201cWhich spot?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly sure. Part of the advantage of your products is that we can move them around. What if I bought two Firmies? Could I reshape those into two halves of a vagina, like maybe one could be the top of the, um, tube, and the other could be the bottom . . . are your products compatible with lubricant?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a special lube that we sell,\u201d I said. \u201cOther lubricants might void the warranty.\u201d\n\u201cThat adds to the cost even more,\u201d the woman said, clearly frustrated. \u201cIs there any way to find out before I put down all that money whether it\u2019s going to work for me? If they sold these at REI I would just buy it and figure I\u2019d return it if I needed to, but nobody takes returns on sex toys.\u201d\n\u201cWe do, under some circumstances,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you give me a little more information about what your goal is with our product?\u201d\n\u201cI want to have sex with my husband,\u201d she said, impatiently, \u201creal sex, or as real as it can get. And he\u2019s a K\u2019srillan male. Our God-given parts just don\u2019t match up.\u201d\nThe K\u2019srillan\u2014our \u201cextraterrestrial immigrants\u201d\u2014made radio contact about a decade ago, and arrived on earth a year and three months ago. Juan periodically mutters about how no matter what they say, they might still be planning invasion and how would we even stop them? But they offered us suspended-animation technology in exchange for asylum (from who? was Juan\u2019s immediate question, but we\u2019ve been assured that they were fleeing the death of their sun, not some second wave of dangerous aliens) and a dozen U.S. cities wound up taking settlements. (They\u2019re spread around. There are a bunch of others in other countries all over the world.) So far in the U.S. it was mostly okay, other than some anti-immigrant rioting in Kansas City. I hadn\u2019t actually met any K\u2019srillan\u2014there was a settlement in Minneapolis but I live in St. Paul and don\u2019t cross the river much\u2014but from what I could tell they were all law-abiding and hard working and in general the sort of people you want to have come and settle in your city.\nThey also looked kind of like roadkilled giant squid. They don\u2019t have faces, as such. I mean, they have eyes, seven of them, which are on stalks, and they have a mouth, which they use to eat and speak, but they\u2019re not right next to each other the way you would expect in practically every earth species out there, from mammals to reptiles to fish. I mean, okay, we do have squids. But they don\u2019t walk around the shopping mall. On tentacles.\nK\u2019srillan do talk, but they aren\u2019t physically capable of making the same sounds as us, so they carry a voice synthesizer for communication.\nThe thought of sex with, or marriage to, a K\u2019srillan was completely baffling to me.\nEven, dare I say it, gross.\nBut we are pro-sex, pro-kink, and anti-shame, so I said, \u201cOkay!\u201d in as cheerful a voice as I could muster, and didn\u2019t add, \u201cHusband? You sure moved fast.\u201d (I might not judge sex lives but I reserve the right to judge major life decisions.) \u201cI don\u2019t actually know that much about K\u2019srillan sexual anatomy. So, um. He has a penis?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we don\u2019t need a Firmie for him,\u201d the woman said, dismissively. \u201cYour products don\u2019t interface with K\u2019srillan neurology anyway or we\u2019d consider buying him a Firmie and having him use that instead of his own penis. He has a penis, but it\u2019s eighteen inches long, and bifurcated.\u201d\n\u201cBifurcated?\u201d\n\u201cBranches into two, basically.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d need at least four Firmies,\u201d I blurted out. \u201cTo make a vagina for eighteen inches of branched penis.\u201d\n\u201cThat is a lot of money.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, for that much you could practically get a custom order.\u201d\n\u201cOh! You do custom orders?\u201d\n\u201cNo. We don\u2019t. But surely someone . . . \u201d\n\u201cDo you think I haven\u2019t checked?\u201d the woman asked, exasperated. \u201cThere has been a lot of discussion of this in the Full Integration community. I am not the only woman looking.\u201d\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\nWell, that changed things, maybe. A custom order was one thing. A prototype was potentially a whole different matter.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cNo? Just no?\u201d\n\u201cWould you rather I went with \u2018no, that\u2019s a repulsive idea?\u2019 \u201d\nI stared at Julia. \u201cI thought we were pro-kink and anti-shame?\u201d To be fair, I\u2019d had a similar reaction at first, but I was actively trying to get past my emotional reaction. Everyone involved was a consenting adult\u2014okay, so the K\u2019srillans had a different life span and developmental arc from humans, but I\u2019d checked, and since the K\u2019srillan males didn\u2019t actually develop a penis until sexual maturity, clearly these were adults we were talking about. Anyway. \u201cDid you know that there\u2019s already a sector of the porn industry devoted to sex between human women and K\u2019srillan males? Apparently an eighteen-inch bifurcated\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop. I don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d\n\u201cDid I ever say that about your ex-boyfriend\u2019s fetish for massive boobs? No. Your kink is not my kink, and your kink is okay. Their kink is not our kink, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t sell them stuff!\u201d\nJulia threw down the silicone butt plug she\u2019d been examining. (We\u2019d been thinking about new ways to extend our line anyway. It\u2019s not as if my suggestion had come completely out of the blue.) \u201cOkay. Fine. You want to design something, we\u2019ll test the market. But you are going to have to take the measurements, you are going to have to build the prototype, and you are certainly going to have to do the focus group and interviews because this is a repulsive idea.\u201d\n\u201cFine!\u201d I said. \u201cFine. I will handle\u2014\u201d I cut myself off. \u201cI will deal with all of it. And we\u2019ll see if enough people want this to make it viable.\u201d\nThe woman who\u2019d called was named Liz, and her husband\u2019s name was Zmivla, and it turned out that Zmivla was part of the group that had settled in Minneapolis, so they lived less than five miles from my office. I drove to the high-rise apartment where so many of the new arrivals had moved in, and took an elevator to their apartment on the twelveth floor.\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Liz said when she answered the door. \u201cI\u2019ve made coffee.\u201d She laughed nervously. \u201cDo you drink coffee?\u201d\nZmivla was lounging in the recliner, tentacles draped over both the arm rests and the foot rest. Two of his eye stalks swiveled to look at me when I came in and his speech synthesizer said, \u201cHello, Ms. Marshall.\u201d\n\u201cCall me Renee,\u201d I said.\nLiz handed me a cup of coffee and I studied Zmivla, wondering if I should just whip out the tape measure and ask him to whip out his penis, or if we should have some more preliminaries first. When Julia started making the Firmies, I think rather than measuring actual penises she bought the dozen or so top-selling models of dildo and measured those. But there aren\u2019t currently any K\u2019srillan dildo models on the market, so we were going to have to go with some actual penises. I took a deep breath. \u201cI should ask some sort of basic questions first, I think.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to know how we met?\u201d Liz asked, brightly.\nActually, I mostly wanted to know how K\u2019srillan sex normally worked with another K\u2019srillan but if she wanted to start with something a little less explicit I supposed that was a reasonable lead-in, so I nodded and drank my coffee while they told me their how-we-met story. I think it involved a conversation that started at the Powderhorn Art Fair but it\u2019s possible I\u2019m mis-remembering and actually that\u2019s how my sister met her ex-husband. If you want to know the truth, all the cutesy \u201chow we met\u201d stories blur together for me. If you met your sweetie because he was third in line for the organized gang bang at the local dungeon and you really liked the shape of his dick, that I\u2019ll remember. If he offered to help you carry your pottery in his tentacles while you kept your dog from bolting, I just don\u2019t care enough to keep it in my head for more than fifteen minutes.\nLiz worked in a boring office and Zmivla had a boring job that was clearly beneath his talents and after they told me that Liz\u2019s hobby was making still life paintings it was clear they were stalling, and I couldn\u2019t entirely blame them, given that I was there to measure the guy\u2019s penis.\n\u201cI know this is a somewhat uncomfortable situation for all of us,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we really probably should get down to business, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI just want you to . . . \u201d Liz hesitated.\nZmivla stroked the back of her hand with the tip of one of his tentacles, delicately. With one of the others, he brushed a strand of hair out of her face. \u201cLiz and I appreciate your open-mindedness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to her that you see us as people first. As a couple who has a right to be together, to share the love that we do.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to think that you\u2019re normal,\u201d I said. I tried to keep the edge of sarcasm out of my voice, but I probably didn\u2019t entirely succeed. \u201cJust another Minneapolis family.\u201d\n\u201cI know we\u2019re not like everyone else,\u201d Liz said. \u201cBut we love each other and take care of each other. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t call me to affirm your relationship. You called me to help you with your sex life. So let\u2019s talk about that.\u201d\nSo, among actual K\u2019srillans, the female folds herself around the male; she does have a short channel that\u2019s there all the time but a decent amount of her sexual passageway is constructed on-the-fly. I took notes. The actual sex involved friction, but some of it was accomplished by the same muscles that were used to fold the extended vagina into place; I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether the male K\u2019srillan thrusted, or not.\n\u201cYou realize,\u201d I said, \u201cthere is no way we can build an IntelliFlesh vagina that will do the folding thing. Or the rippling, or whatever. Maybe we could add a vibrator . . . \u201d\n\u201cOlder K\u2019srillan females sometimes lose a certain amount of strength,\u201d Zmivla offered. \u201cThere is a procedure that allows the female to fasten her channel into place, and when having sex with a female who has had this procedure, the male thrusts. It should work.\u201d The tips of his tentacles turned pink and I wasn\u2019t sure whether he was embarrassed, sexually aroused, or something else entirely. \u201cThough this vibration option you mention . . . \u201d\nI had brought the tape measure but I wound up having Liz do the measurements. I made a sketch and had her call out the measurements as I noted them down. Eighteen inches was a rough estimate, it turned out: one branch ran 18.25 inches stem to stern and the other branch was 17.8 inches. Girth of the trunk portion was comparable to a soda can; the branches were a lot more slender and tapered toward the tip, like extremely long carrots. The K\u2019srillan penis is blue, I noticed, or at least it\u2019s blue when he\u2019s sexually aroused, sort of a dusky violet-blue that would indicate in a human that he\u2019s oxygen-deprived or possibly freezing to death. There are visible veins in the sides.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know how typical you are,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, for a K\u2019srillan male, are you on the large side or the small side, are you more or less asymmetrical than most, how does your girth compare . . . \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it would be too hard to find out. There are about a thousand K\u2019srillans living in this apartment complex, after all, and I know two dozen others with human wives.\u201d\nI spent two entire days measuring K\u2019srillan penises.\nThe good news was that K\u2019srillan penises turned out to be reasonably uniform. I mean, they ranged in length from sixteen inches all the way up to twenty, and they ranged in girth from pop can to coffee mug, and there were some penises where one branch was noticeably shorter, even by as much as six inches. But human penises also vary. I mean, the average length for an erect dick is about five inches, but the record holder was 13.5 inches long. (Not to overshare but that just sounds like it would be painful.)\nThe variety of sizing in human dicks has not prevented the successful marketing of any number of artificial vaginas (or \u201cmasturbation sleeves,\u201d to use the technical industry term.) I mean, just like with dildos you can provide a set of different sizes but they are not all THAT customized, and given that IntelliFlesh is a lot more adaptable than silicone, I was pretty sure we\u2019d be able to come up with something that would work.\nAnyway, that was the good news. The bad news was that I had to spend two entire days measuring K\u2019srillan penises.\nFortunately, K\u2019srillan men seem to be pretty secure in their masculinity. I mean, imagine the reaction if you came at the average human male with a tape measure. My former brother-in-law actually measured his own dick at some point and it was 4.5 inches long, so a whopping half-inch shorter than the average. My sister told absolutely everyone, after the divorce, but the problem wasn\u2019t really his very-slightly-runty dick, it was the ways in which he compensated and the fact that he was a complete loser in the sack, one of those men who thinks that his penis is magic and if you can\u2019t climax in two minutes just from him sticking it in you, you must be broken. One-half-inch-less than average length: not a problem. Complete boredom in the sack: definite problem.\n(Sorry. Very few people in my life seem to embrace my no-overshares policy.)\nAnyway. There was one K\u2019srillan who shrank at the sight of the tape measure, but then he laughed (K\u2019srillans actually have a physical response to humor, I found out, but the voice synthesizers are programmed to pick up on it and translate it into a ha-ha-ha sound) and said, \u201cGive me just one moment\u201d and swelled back up to full size within a few seconds. K\u2019srillans all grew up in K\u2019srillan society, which has its own set of gender roles and expectations that are absolutely nothing whatsoever like human gender stereotypes, and then they were plunged into human society and forced to adapt. One of the men noted, as I wrapped the tape measure around the trunk portion at the bottom, that in K\u2019srillan society it is the woman who is expected to make the first move; a man who propositions a woman is shameless and forward, and he thinks human women like that, once we get used to the idea.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, and measured his length on the left-hand side: 17.85. \u201cHow\u2019d you meet your wife, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cI thought they told you?\u201d he said, a little mournfully. \u201cI have not been so fortunate yet, but I volunteered for this exciting project because it will perhaps raise interest in our kind.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you honestly prefer to marry someone of your own species?\u201d I said.\n\u201cAmong my own kind I am considered unattractive,\u201d he said.\nI stepped back and took a look at him. Over the two days, K\u2019srillans had stopped looking like roadkilled squid to me, but I still wouldn\u2019t call any individual attractive as such. I finished the last measurement, wrote it down, and tossed my gloves into his kitchen trash can. \u201cThanks for your help,\u201d I said.\nI was back in the office, finishing up my prototype design, when my phone rang.\n\u201cYou do us an injustice,\u201d said a synthesized voice on the other end of the line.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cWho\u2019s calling, please?\u201d\n\u201cFor days you come to our settlement and measure the male organs,\u201d the voice said, distressed. \u201cAnd now I find out it is so that you can make false female organs for human women.\u201d\nI scratched my head, wondering how I\u2019d gotten myself into this. \u201cLook. You do realize that we specialize in false organs of all varieties for humans\u2014both women and men.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d the voice said, furious. \u201cAnd I am a K\u2019srillan female married to a human male. Why are you not going to make false K\u2019srillan male organs? What is my husband supposed to do to please me?\u201d\nSo in the end, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be shocked to hear, we made both. We made K\u2019srillan vaginas: as I warned Liz, they\u2019re not capable of the K\u2019srillan pre-sex vaginal origami action, but they do simulate the muscle movements with the addition of an adjustable vibrator. We also made K\u2019srillan penises, though due to limited market penetration at this point we have only one size and shape (pop-bottle girth at the bottom, 17.85 on the left-hand size, 18.1 on the right-hand side).\nWhat I find the weirdest these days are not the human/K\u2019srillan couples. It\u2019s the human/human couples that buy one from each set and have sex with the detachable genitals instead of the compatible set they already had. Or maybe it\u2019s the porn of humans having sex with the K\u2019srillan artificial genitalia. Or possibly the gay porn of humans having sex with K\u2019srillan artificial genitalia. Or possibly the absolute weirdest is the porn of K\u2019srillans having sex with artificial human genitalia\u2014they can\u2019t do that with IntelliFlesh (years of research into their neurology remain to be done) but there\u2019s always the good old-fashioned strap-on option on one side, and an artificial vagina on the other.\nBecause really, there are two immutable laws of nature at work here: number one, love will find a way; and number two, if a sexual act can be conceived of, someone will pay money to watch it.\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about that first rule, lately. Because I told my sister about the \u201cunattractive\u201d K\u2019srillan and jokingly\u2014I swear I was joking!\u2014pointed out that at least she\u2019d never be bored in bed. She jokingly\u2014she claims she was joking\u2014asked me for his number. I told her she could have it if she promised to never tell me the details of their sex life, and she pointed out that I already knew this guy\u2019s penis size down to the quarter-inch . . .\nYeah, they\u2019re dating. They\u2019re not rushing into anything, so this story doesn\u2019t end with, \u201cAnd the wedding\u2019s next week!\u201d But I have to say\u2014you do get used to the seven eyes looking at you over the after-dinner drinks and I\u2019ve learned to spot the physical cues of the laugh even before the synthesizer goes \u201cha ha ha.\u201d And Gintika (that\u2019s his name) definitely doesn\u2019t make me think of roadkilled squid anymore. He makes me think about how sometimes we have more in common with people than we realize; he makes me think about all the ways to form a connection. He makes me think about the look on my sister\u2019s face when she talks about him. He makes me think, love finds a way, and hey, sometimes finding a way, finds you love.\nNaomi Kritzer has been writing science fiction and fantasy for over twenty years.

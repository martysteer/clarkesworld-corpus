Coming into the kitchen, he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing. Bottles all over, spills of sugar, a fifth of tequila lying tipped in the sink. And shards, too, literal pieces of glass, because the stupid kid, in his coked-up excitement, has jumped and smashed his head into the kitchen fixture, raining wreckage into the room.\n The bulb\u2019s intact, so Johnny can see Kip\u2019s face, see he has no idea what\u2019s happened. \u201cJohnny?\u201d Kip holds up wounded palms. \u201cWhat\u2019d I do?\u201d\n \u201cCome on, kid.\u201d Johnny stabs hands into Kip\u2019s armpits, forklifts him up. \u201cOn your feet.\u201d\n \u201cDid I hit my head?\u201d Kip looks into his palms, where blood and glass mix in peppermint-colored swirls. He\u2019s an idiot, but a beautiful idiot.\n \u201cYou hit the light.\u201d Johnny points. \u201cYou\u2019re high. This is what comes of mixing coke and Kraftwerk at 3 a.m.\u201d For a second, they\u2019re angled together, hip to hip, and of course that\u2019s when Armin comes into the room, stands a beat with his tongue in his cheek, and says:\n \u201cMy, my, my, what have I been missing?\u201d\n \u201cAll right, Joan Rivers. Help me with this guy.\u201d\n They get Kip across the hall into the bathroom, where he lolls on the toilet humming \u201cAngel of the Morning\u201d while Johnny holds him steady, and Armin cleans his hands. It\u2019s not bad, not like it could\u2019ve been, though God knows what eight shots of Cuervo will do to a poor young queen\u2019s insides. The other guests cluster in the hall, gossiping, gawping at the grooves of muscle showing through Kip\u2019s tight shirt.\n \u201cPoor boy,\u201d someone says, \u201cit\u2019s past his bedtime.\u201d That\u2019s their cue to get Kip across the hall, flump him on the foldout, pour water between his teeth.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Johnny whispers. Because Kip is muttering, words coming out slobbery and unclear.\n Armin says from the door, \u201cJust let him sleep.\u201d\n \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to tell us something.\u201d\n Kip sits up, gaping, then falls back, passes out. His eyelids droop, but his lips are still moving. Johnny has the idea if he parted Kip\u2019s jaws, looked in the boy\u2019s mouth, he\u2019d see words in there, trapped, trying to fly free.\n \u201cHe\u2019s fucked up,\u201d Armin says. \u201cHe needs to convalesce.\u201d\n It feels wrong to leave Kip lying in the dark, but Johnny backs out and shuts the door.\n \u201cYou always do this,\u201d Armin clucks. \u201cYou fuss.\u201d\n Lowering his voice, Johnny says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the count?\u201d\n Armin jerks a thumb. \u201cTwo on the patio. Roy and his friends are still at it in the living room. Chuck and the Slab . . . \u201d\n The way he trails off, eyebrows jumping, sends a trail of ice down Johnny\u2019s spine.\n \u201cShit. Really?\u201d\n \u201c\u2019Fraid so.\u201d\n \u201cIn our bed?\u201d\n Armin holds up his hands, presenting the world in all its luxuriant absurdity.\n They clear the living room first. Johnny scratches the record, making Chaka Khan choke off mid-wail. Then hall, kitchen, bathroom. Whoever was on the patio has already vanished, a cigarette left smoking on the bricks.\n Johnny tackles the situation in the bedroom. Chuck and the guy they call the Slab haven\u2019t used the bed, but are lying next to it, curled up in postcoital repose. Johnny digs a toe in. \u201cLovebirds. Up \u2018n\u2019 at \u2019em.\u201d\n Chuck rises, stretches, makes a kissy face. The Slab hauls his muscular ass off the floor. \u201cGood party,\u201d Chuck grunts, eyes bright above his Burt Reynolds mustache. He cops a feel of Johnny\u2019s upper arm. Armin once said Chuck rubbed against so many hard bodies, it was a wonder friction hadn\u2019t worn him smooth.\n \u201cStop by sometime. I\u2019ll give you a birthday gift.\u201d Chuck winks, making his mustache wiggle. Johnny groans and shoves him away.\n Then it\u2019s out into the shivery dark, goodbye, goodbye, the guests straggling off, while overhead the city glows with all its tipsy towers. Johnny can already feel the dawn coming, a pressure of light beyond the sea. He wishes he could have this moment forever, the sad sweet end of a perfect day. Then hands weight his shoulders. Breath strokes his neck. Johnny pivots into the clutch of Armin\u2019s kiss.\n \u201cHappy thirty-fifth, old-timer.\u201d\n \u201cThanks. You know how to make a boy feel special.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re ancient. A relic. And that means you\u2019re all m-i-i-i-i-ne . . . \u201d\n Armin pirouettes to the bedroom. Johnny still wants to check on Kip. He pads down the hall. The guest room smells of sleep farts and alcohol. On the foldout, Kip is sprawled limbs akimbo, sleeping the knockout slumber of the drunk. Johnny grabs his ankles and straightens him out. In the half-light, Kip looks achingly young, angelic, a vision. The change in position stirs something inside him.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Johnny puts an ear to Kip\u2019s mouth. In a superstitious way, he feels this could be important, a subliminal missive, a message from beyond. The boy\u2019s voice comes out singsong and sloppy.\n When the sheaves are gathered,When the geese have flown,Summer\u2019s ribbons stored away,Fruits and flowers grown . . .\n Johnny shakes him. No response. He hesitates. Kip\u2019s ditty isn\u2019t the kind of thing you expect a drunk party boy to be humming in the era of MTV. Yet Johnny\u2019s sure he\u2019s heard it before, far back, a tune out of time.\n When the sheaves are gathered . . .\n Irrational fear tweaks the hairs on Johnny\u2019s neck. Maybe this is what it\u2019s like getting older, this tickle of death breathing down your spine. His last view is of the streetlight through the window, the spectral curve of Kip\u2019s sleeping cheek. Then the door swings shut, the latch clicks, the day is done.\n 2\n \u201cUp \u2018n\u2019 at \u2019em, cowboy.\u201d\n Johnny groans in wan dawn light, so exhausted he can barely remember his name. He fumbles for the glass of water by the bed. In the bathroom, Armin is humming Boy George, making the faucets bark and cough. He comes to the bedroom, stands in the door, mimes shooting himself in the head.\n \u201cYou alive?\u201d\n \u201cUgh,\u201d Johnny groans.\n \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d\n Johnny can only wince and moan.\n Armin laughs. \u201cGuess we better get to it, huh?\u201d\n They gulp Advil, toast, coffee, eggs, and face the aftermath of the night.\n \u201cLooks like we partied even harder than I thought.\u201d Armin sweeps a slipper through piles of shattered glass. \u201cAny idea who broke the light?\u201d\n Johnny squints at the heap of shards. It\u2019s curious, the feeling that comes over him now, like he ought to remember, but can\u2019t summon details. It\u2019s there in his mind\u2014a file ready for retrieval\u2014but each time he tries, he comes up blank, a chunk of core knowledge deleted from his head.\n Johnny toes the mess. \u201cI feel like I should know. But I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe gotta stop doing this,\u201d Armin laughs. \u201cWe\u2019re getting old. Can\u2019t party like we used to.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re not that old.\u201d Johnny\u2019s getting tired of these quips about their age, as if thirty-five is the leading edge of death.\n \u201cIn all seriousness, I\u2019d like to know who destroyed our kitchen fixture.\u201d Armin peers at the naked bulb, which appears to have survived the catastrophe intact. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to reevaluate the company we keep.\u201d\n \u201cUh-huh.\u201d Johnny checks the sink, the floor. It\u2019s maddening, the feeling he has right now, like there\u2019s something he\u2019s forgotten, a clue to this scene, if only his brain hadn\u2019t misplaced the data. A clue gone AWOL, a wayward detail. He has an urge to check the spare room.\n \u201cYou think there\u2019s someone in there?\u201d Armin trails him through the hall. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have anyone over, did you?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s the thing, I can\u2019t remember.\u201d Johnny stops at the door. It\u2019s silly, surreal. He\u2019s sure nothing\u2019s wrong. Yet he shudders as he raps the wood.\n No answer.\n \u201cWell?\u201d Armin says.\n Johnny hesitates. Grabs the knob. Gives a twist.\n The room\u2019s empty. A sour smell fills the air, as if someone\u2019s been here, but there\u2019s no other sign. The foldout\u2019s open, covered with a sheet. A cairn of cushions teeters on the floor. Armin points his mug.\n \u201cSomeone fixed up the bed. Doesn\u2019t look like he used it, though.\u201d\n \u201cNope.\u201d Johnny pats the mattress, the pillow. There\u2019s nothing remarkable, no sign of trouble, yet he feels as if someone ought to be here. He peeks behind the couch.\n \u201cWhat exactly are you looking for?\u201d Armin says.\n \u201cI feel like we\u2019re missing someone, somehow.\u201d\n \u201cSomeone? Who? An adopted child? You kidnap somebody last night without telling me?\u201d\n \u201cI wish I could remember.\u201d\n Armin laughs. \u201cIt was that good a party, huh?\u201d\n Johnny smiles. He has to force it. What bothers him isn\u2019t the emptiness of the room, but the emptiness inside his own head. A gap in reality, a wound in the world.\n \u201cCome on,\u201d Armin turns. \u201cIf someone was here, he\u2019s already gone.\u201d\n Life settles into its usual groove, a weekly rhythm of chores and chats. There\u2019s plenty to think about, plenty to do. Lunch at the office, Friday night dancing, exercise three days a week. It\u2019s this, Johnny decides, that really shows they\u2019re getting older. Not budding fears or physical wear, but the slow, steady creep of routine.\n He can\u2019t quite shake the sense of something missing, a tug of a memory that won\u2019t quite come. Johnny makes Armin sit down one night and list every person who was at the party.\n \u201cLet\u2019s see. There was Roy and Roger\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnd Jim.\u201d\n \u201cAnd Dave and Don. Plus Dave\u2019s friend with the infected piercing.\u201d\n \u201cMerv. Merv the Perv. And Tim and Chuck.\u201d\n \u201cYes. And the Slab.\u201d\n And Ed and Larry, and Lou and Joe, and Tracy the man and Traci the woman, and Jerry C and Jerry O and Jheri as in Jheri curl, and Logan and the man who came with Logan, whose name they\u2019ve forgotten, but whose sideburns they\u2019ll never forget. Everyone checked-off, accounted for. But Johnny could swear a face has been misplaced.\n \u201cI don\u2019t see who could be missing.\u201d Armin caps his pen. \u201cThis is everyone we know.\u201d\n \u201cSomeone with a K, maybe? Katy? Kevin?\u201d\n \u201cYou mean Kayla? She moved to LA.\u201d\n They give up, though Johnny\u2019s still not satisfied. He\u2019s sure someone slept in the guest room that night. He just can\u2019t seem to remember who.\n Life goes on, as it always does, and Johnny does his best to move on. There are other incidents, missing details, a feeling that something\u2019s been misplaced: a note, a book, a face, a friend. Johnny finds himself pausing on the street, looking into random apartments, marveling at the number of strangers in this town.\n Nothing to worry about, right? Stress. Fatigue. Or just the chaos of city life. Johnny chalks it up to ordinary absentmindedness, mental wear from a harried life.\n Meanwhile, life offers new challenges. Business at the gallery, lost youthful dreams, summer crowds that seem wearier than ever. Was the city always like this, Johnny wonders, strange and alien, like a monument to a forgotten past?\n A few months later, there\u2019s also this.\n Slow morning at the office. A buzz of flies. The phone jangles at Johnny\u2019s elbow, and he grabs the receiver, hoists it to his ear. The voice on the line is weirdly familiar, making Johnny narrow his eyes.\n \u201cChuck?\u201d\n \u201cYou know it.\u201d A husky laugh blasts into Johnny\u2019s ear, evoking visions of bright teeth, a mustache. \u201cHow you been? I\u2019ve been thinking about you, buddy.\u201d\n Johnny glances up. The office is silent, filled like a fishbowl with summer heat. There\u2019s no rule against personal calls.\n \u201cDidn\u2019t recognize me, huh?\u201d Chuck grates out a laugh. \u201cGuess we\u2019ve never done this before. Talked, I mean. On the phone. You and me.\u201d His voice drops to new depths of intimacy. \u201cListen, man, you free for lunch?\u201d\n \u201cI could be.\u201d Johnny pauses to wipe the receiver. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n The silence is so long, Johnny jiggles the cord.\n \u201cNothing,\u201d Chuck chirps. \u201cJust been thinking. How you and me need to have a talk.\u201d\n \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n \u201cAbout the stuff we need to talk about.\u201d\n Johnny sighs. They make plans to meet in an hour, at Chuck\u2019s club, the Sports Palace, eight blocks south. It\u2019s one of those everything-plus-racquetball affairs, aerobics classes, courts and pools, a carpeted lounge where sexy singles meet and preen. Out front, in a caf\u00e9 with juice and sandwiches, Chuck slides his hips into a sixties-style pod chair, shoving over a meal someone\u2019s left on the table. The girl at the stand doesn\u2019t even look up but smacks her gum and gives a rustle of her Vogue. The club seems weirdly empty today, but Johnny figures that\u2019s the Friday lull.\n \u201cGuess it\u2019s obvious what this is about.\u201d Chuck\u2019s uncharacteristically fidgety, toying with his laminated membership card. Beefcakes and bombshells strut behind him, white towels draped over taut brown arms.\n \u201cIt is?\u201d Johnny says.\n \u201cCome on, man. Are we gonna talk about this or what?\u201d\n Johnny\u2019s stomach fizzes. Behind Chuck, women mill in a glass-walled room, restless in their leotards. A mirrored wall reflects puzzled pouts. Something\u2019s wrong. A rubber mat lies empty. The instructor hasn\u2019t shown, or a classmate\u2019s missing, or a special guest has failed to appear. Who\u2019s running this joint, anyway?\n \u201cJohnny? Hello? You with me, man?\u201d\n \u201cSorry.\u201d Johnny drags his eyes to Chuck\u2019s smile. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m saying, your party. Remember? The bedroom? Something happened in there. Or am I crazy?\u201d\n Johnny\u2019s head feels light and airy, scooped out like a pitted fruit. He\u2019s been wanting to discuss this subject for weeks, the strange suspicion that\u2019s dogging his mind. A surge of superstition stops his voice. Like something will be ruptured if he voices his fears, a jinx, a hex, a cosmic balance.\n \u201cYou mean what happened in the guest room, right?\u201d\n \u201cGuest room? I\u2019m talking about the bedroom, man. Your bedroom. Talking about you and me.\u201d Chuck slaps the table. \u201cCome on, you know what\u2019s up. This has been coming for a long, long time.\u201d\n In the glass-walled room, the women are arguing, stamping feet, checking pocket planners. Johnny senses a vacancy in the air, as if the universe has gotten slightly larger, too big for the people floating inside.\n \u201cI\u2019ll put it like this.\u201d Chuck crosses his arms. \u201cRemember Bobby?\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cBobby Plotz. Tall guy, brown eyes?\u201d\n Johnny squints. He can almost remember. Then the face pops into his mind, a blurred cameo.\n \u201cBobby, right. With the long hair? Kind of homely, but in a hot sort of way?\u201d\n \u201cIf that\u2019s your type. Listen, here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. You remember Bobby. But do you remember what happened to him?\u201d\n Johnny scrunches his forehead. \u201cDid he move?\u201d\n \u201cSee, this is what I\u2019m saying, man.\u201d Chuck throws up beefy arms. \u201cPeople leave, we barely remember. Connections break and no one cares. Me? Bobby? We used to be like that. Now? How long\u2019s it been? I couldn\u2019t even say.\u201d\n \u201cGuess that\u2019s what it\u2019s like getting older,\u201d Johnny mumbles.\n \u201cIs that what you tell yourself? Come on, man. We were a tribe. A pack, a crew. Now? When\u2019s the last time you called an old friend? Guys like us, we can\u2019t let this happen. We can\u2019t let those connections slip.\u201d\n Johnny squints. He sees where this is heading. He knows where Chuck wants it to go. But he needs to discuss what\u2019s on his own mind.\n \u201cI hear you.\u201d Johnny nods. \u201cI get it, I do. People drift apart. But those are just the ones we remember, right? You ever think about . . . \u201d Johnny swallows. \u201cAbout the ones we don\u2019t remember?\u201d\n Chuck nods as if in deep agreement, then freezes. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n \u201cYou know.\u201d Johnny feels like his head has gone hollow, filled with light, a frail Jack-o-lantern. In the exercise room, the leotarded women are giving up, heading for the door, shaking masses of thickly permed hair. A scheduling error? A glitch in the books?\n \u201cThe others.\u201d Johnny licks dry lips. \u201cThe ones we lost but can\u2019t remember. The people we used to know, at one time, and now we don\u2019t even know they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about, man?\u201d\n \u201cI mean, there must be people like that, right?\u201d Johnny leans over, almost tipping a cup of carrot juice that\u2019s sitting on the table, still full. He glances at the clutter Chuck\u2019s pushed aside. A newspaper, open to the wanted ads. A sandwich. A leather case. Who left this stuff here, anyway?\n \u201cAt school.\u201d Johnny struggles to order his thoughts. \u201cThe office. Old coworkers. Classmates, colleagues. People we used to see every day. Acquaintances, relatives, friends of friends. Now they\u2019re gone. And we\u2019ve forgotten them so completely, we can\u2019t even really be sure they were there. Gaps in our memory, vanished ghosts. As if they might as well not have existed.\u201d\n Chuck\u2019s looking past him, at the open door. A woman stands with a hand on the glass, holding it open, staring into the street. No one\u2019s there, just empty sidewalk, until a man bolts out of a taxi.\n \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, man,\u201d Chuck laughs.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you feel it, though?\u201d Johnny insists. \u201cAt certain times, on certain days? This nagging feeling, like something\u2019s missing? Like there\u2019s something you can almost remember, but not quite?\u201d Johnny leans forward. \u201cYou know I play squash at eighty-sixth?\u201d\n \u201cSure.\u201d\n \u201cI was at the courts the other day, ready for the match, and . . . \u201d\n \u201cYeah?\u201d\n \u201cNo one\u2019s there.\u201d\n \u201cWhat, at the club?\u201d\n \u201cOf course there were people at the club. But not at my court. My partner didn\u2019t show.\u201d\n \u201cHe do that often?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Johnny says. \u201cI have no idea who my partner is. I have no recollection of ever having a partner. But I must have had one at some time, right? Why would I schedule a match without a partner?\u201d\n Chuck\u2019s mouth opens, then shuts, like he knows there must be a reasonable explanation, but can\u2019t quite figure out what it is.\n \u201cIt\u2019s like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d Johnny says. \u201cLike losing your keys. Like that feeling you get when you could swear you own the White Album, but you look and look and it\u2019s not anywhere.\u201d\n He scoots closer.\n \u201cHow about this? Happy hour at Elmo\u2019s. We\u2019re there, the usual crew, saving a seat. People come. Anyone using this chair? Yes, we say, yes, yes, yes. Five times this happens. Then Roger looks up, asks, \u2018Who are we saving this chair for, anyway?\u2019 No one could remember. We all laughed, but I\u2019m telling you, it was weird, man. Creepy.\u201d\n Chuck shakes his head. \u201cThings like that happen all the time.\u201d\n \u201cSo why did we all make the same mistake? Why did it happen to all of us at once?\u201d\n \u201cWho else was there?\u201d\n \u201cMe. Armin. Lou. Roger.\u201d\n \u201cSee, this is my point,\u201d Chuck says. \u201cTen years back\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThere are other things.\u201d Johnny rushes on, aware he\u2019s talking too loudly, but needing now to get it all out. \u201cThe gym. Last week. I looked up, no one was spotting my reps. I swear someone had been, a second ago. Where\u2019d they go? The other day, I was looking through my books. A bunch were missing. The Drowning Season. Valley of the Dolls. I lent them to someone, I\u2019m sure, but who? It\u2019s like there are fewer people, somehow. Like something, someone, has been whittling down the numbers.\u201d\n Chuck\u2019s head is shaking. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Johnny insists. \u201cThis is different. This isn\u2019t just people moving away. Who left this stuff sitting here, on this table? This sandwich, this juice? Why\u2019s this club so empty? Why aren\u2019t instructors showing up for their classes?\u201d\n \u201cJohnny, listen to yourself.\u201d\n \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying. You have to know. You have to have noticed.\u201d\n Chuck\u2019s leaning back, hands pressed to his chest. \u201cDo I know what you\u2019re saying? Sure. And I know where it\u2019s coming from. Look, man, I\u2019m not a guy to point fingers. But I can\u2019t help but notice, since you moved in with that stiff\u2014\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know. Ten years ago? We were animals, man. We\u2019d hit the clubs and know every face. Now? I hardly see you. Ever since you and that mummy started playing house, it\u2019s been\u2014\u201d\n \u201cJesus.\u201d Johnny groans. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me and Armin, Chuck.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d Chuck folds his arms. \u201cLet me tell you something about Armin. Armin was born with a foot in the grave. You and me, Johnny? Guys like us? We need to live while we\u2019re alive.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you something, Chuck.\u201d\n \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to tell you something. You\u2019ve always been like this. You fuss. You fret. You worry about stuff you can\u2019t change. If you give me a chance\u2014\u201d\n Johnny doesn\u2019t hear the rest of what Chuck\u2019s saying. A sound floats over the caf\u00e9 tables, faint, lilting. The girl at the register is bent over her magazine, singing softly between smacks of gum.\n When the sheaves are gathered,When the geese have flown,Summer\u2019s ribbons stored away,Fruits and flowers grown,\n When the frost gleams on the glassWhere sun and raindrops shone . . .\n \u201cJohnny?\u201d Chuck\u2019s standing, hands spread on top of his chair. Johnny realizes he\u2019s standing, too, lured by the tune floating over the tables. He crosses the room.\n \u201cHey. Where\u2019d you hear that?\u201d\n The girl\u2019s eyes narrow above her magazine. \u201cHear what?\u201d\n \u201cThat song. The one you were singing just now. Where\u2019d you learn it?\u201d\n She frowns, tonguing her gum into her cheek.\n \u201cCome on, you know, the one you were just\u2014\u201d Johnny groans and wheels away, lurching back to the waiting table, where Chuck holds up baffled hands.\n \u201cThe hell, man?\u201d\n Johnny picks up the uneaten sandwich. The bread is still soft. Fresh. Untasted.\n \u201cWas someone sitting here?\u201d Johnny calls over his shoulder. \u201cAt this table? Before we came?\u201d\n The girl stares.\n \u201cGoddamn,\u201d Johnny grunts, letting the sandwich fall.\n \u201cJohnny, are you even listening to me?\u201d\n Johnny\u2019s already moving, hurrying through the lobby, out into the midtown streets, which he can\u2019t help but notice are ethereally silent, strangely uncrowded for this time of day.\n The train ride home is eerily speedy, the seats mostly empty, the platforms bare. The streets of the Lower East Side are serene. Johnny counts cars as he hurries down his block. Three, four. Traffic is light, but maybe that\u2019s the effect of the recession. Were there this many shuttered shops last week?\n A man slumps in a doorway. A woman peers from an alley. How many of these people could vanish, Johnny wonders, before someone noticed and raised an alarm? If a day came when the unthinkable happened, if these worn, huddled figures dispersed into mist, would Johnny remember them? Would anyone?\n He opens the door. The apartment is hushed. Johnny hurries down the hall. The tick of a typewriter comes from the guest room. Fridays are Armin\u2019s do-not-disturb time. Johnny barges right on in.\n \u201cUh, okay.\u201d Armin swivels from the desk. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d\n \u201cYou tell me.\u201d Johnny paces the thinning carpet. Sweat tickles his nose. He spins, hands fisted. \u201cAre we all right? You and me? Be honest.\u201d\n Armin takes off his glasses. Johnny sees a sheet curling out of the typewriter, speckled with print. Armin points with his glasses. \u201cI\u2019m three hours shy of my deadline here. Is there a chance this can wait?\u201d\n \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. No, I really have to know.\u201d Johnny throws himself onto the sofa, startled by how dazzle-brained he feels, shattered inside, a man of glass. \u201cListen. If I suddenly disappeared\u2014no, just listen. If I vanished this instant, fell out of your life, would you . . . would you remember me?\u201d\n Armin tips his chair. \u201cWhere is this coming from?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just, I have this feeling. Like it\u2019s all slipping away. And we don\u2019t talk about it. No one ever talks about it. But we\u2019re losing people, aren\u2019t we? Losing people from our lives?\u201d\n Armin clacks shut his glasses. Frowns. Considers. \u201cWe have fewer friends than we used to, that\u2019s true.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019ve noticed it.\u201d\n Armin sighs. \u201cI wish I knew what brings this on.\u201d\n Johnny clutches his knees. The room, the world, is pumping like a giant heart, too big one second, too small the next. Johnny feels like he did at sixteen, starting a new school, that world of strange faces.\n \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Armin pinches his nose. \u201cNot a week goes by I don\u2019t think about my mother. Or my cousin. Or my grandma. Or . . . well, all the others. But can\u2019t we enjoy what we have while we have it?\u201d\n \u201cI know, I know.\u201d Johnny nods with a conviction that surprises him. It feels good to agree with these obvious facts, to have something to share, a basic understanding. \u201cI know, you\u2019re right, I just\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate.\u201d Armin looks at the floor. \u201cWe have a home, a community. Can\u2019t we savor it while it lasts?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Johnny gulps, embarrassed. He feels infinitely grateful for these sane, simple words. \u201cOf course you\u2019re right.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just that you always do this, dear. You obsess.\u201d Armin waits a beat before smiling. \u201cCan I please finish this bitch of an article, now?\u201d\n Johnny laughs. Armin rises, stands over him, reaching down to tickle his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about the rest of the world, OK? Whatever\u2019s coming, whatever life has in store, the past can\u2019t be changed. That\u2019s something, right? Nothing can ever undo what we\u2019ve had.\u201d He nudges up Johnny\u2019s head. \u201cYou understand?\u201d\n The worries of the week seem remote now, ridiculous, but Johnny\u2019s laugh comes out shaky and faint. \u201cWanna hear something weird?\u201d\n \u201cFive minutes.\u201d Armin goes back to his chair.\n \u201cI was out with Chuck. Today. At his gym.\u201d\n \u201cUh-huh.\u201d\n \u201cNo, but listen. And this girl who works there, she was singing this old-timey song. It was odd, you know, hearing a kid today sing something like that. Quaint.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d\n \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. I was sure, I could swear, I\u2019d heard it before. The tune, the words . . . it was so familiar . . . \u201d\n Johnny snatches empty air, grasping a fact already receding, even as Armin leans back, closes his eyes, and intones with rich solemnity:\n When the sheaves are gathered,When the geese have flown,Summer\u2019s ribbons stored away,Fruits and flowers grown,\n When the frost gleams on the glassWhere sun and raindrops shone,And winter\u2019s silver trims the turf\u2014\n \u201cStop.\u201d Johnny\u2019s voice comes out faint and slurred, the ghost of a shout. But Armin carries on, finishing the second verse, launching into the third, before Johnny jumps up shouting, \u201cStop, stop, stop!\u201d\n \u201cJesus. All right. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\n \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Johnny\u2019s shaking.\n \u201cDo what?\u201d Armin scoots closer to his desk. \u201cReally, Johnny, sometimes you drive me crazy.\u201d\n Armin pokes papers, looking over what he\u2019s written, tapping keys, squinting through his glasses. Johnny stares, openmouthed, as the world fills up with a feeling of wrongness as vivid as a bath of blood. He clenches his hands. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that, Armin. You shouldn\u2019t have sung it.\u201d\n \u201cSung what? Johnny, come here.\u201d Armin\u2019s hand flaps. Johnny drifts over, to be taken by the wrist, drawn toward the desk, Armin\u2019s upturned eyes.\n \u201cI love you, Johnny. Honestly I do. But sometimes? Dear? Sometimes you need to let things go.\u201d\n 3\n With one thing and another, it\u2019s three months before Johnny manages to see Chuck again. The meeting almost doesn\u2019t happen. Johnny shows up forty minutes late, and Chuck\u2019s even later. The trains have been awful. Buses, too. It\u2019s a system-wide problem, people are saying, a municipal crisis, bad city management. There are absentee issues, budget shortfalls, a decline in tax revenues. Johnny\u2019s too busy to keep up with the news.\n The club is deserted, a glass mausoleum, though Chuck says that\u2019s typical for weekday afternoons. In the caf\u00e9, Johnny rings the bell three times, shouts for service, but no one comes. Chuck shrugs it off. \u201cThey\u2019ve been short-staffed.\u201d\n They buy coffee from a roach coach and sit on the curb. Chuck\u2019s mustache is gone. His hair\u2019s a mess. He tells the usual tales of dating in the city, a litany of dropped plans, unanswered calls. It\u2019s slim pickings out there, Chuck says. Empty. The old meat market has gone vegetarian. Really, though, when\u2019s it ever been different? That\u2019s the problem with city living, Chuck grumbles. Bad men are so hard to find.\n He laughs. It trails off into a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll go through my wallet,\u201d Chucks says, \u201cfind ten numbers, then I call \u2019em all and don\u2019t get a thing. Zip. I mean, what the hell? Did everyone simultaneously forget how to party?\u201d\n Chuck laughs again, but there\u2019s weight to his voice, a load of unnamed anxieties. It\u2019s something everyone feels, these days, though no one\u2019s brave enough to say it. A mysterious mournfulness, a sense of decline. Johnny sees it in faces on the street, sometimes in the bathroom mirror, where his reflection peers back with a lack of expression, eyes uninterested in their own deadness, lips too lazy to sketch a fake smile.\n \u201cAnyway.\u201d Chuck sips. \u201cHow\u2019s your problem working out?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d Johnny shivers. \u201cI thought I had a buyer, but they bailed. Didn\u2019t give a reason, just stopped returning calls. The realtor says it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great place, anyway. All that space.\u201d\n \u201cI know . . . \u201d Johnny grimaces. Truthfully, he can\u2019t imagine why he needed so much space. A two-person apartment? All to himself? He can hardly stand to live there, sometimes. The empty rooms, the surfeit of area. Even worse are the haunted nights, when he feels like a ghost is sleeping beside him, a chilly specter sharing the bed.\n The loneliness can get so intense that little things will set Johnny off: the record collection full of bands he doesn\u2019t like, the shelves of books he\u2019ll never read. How much junk does one bachelor need?\n \u201cMust get lonely,\u201d Chuck says, looking hard in Johnny\u2019s eyes. And there\u2019s an air of inevitability to the exchange when he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I was over . . . \u201d\n Neither man bothers to call into the office. There isn\u2019t much work to be done these days. Employers are lax about monitoring hours. Sometimes employees don\u2019t show up at all. As their taxi jounces down empty streets, Johnny gazes up into rows of blank windows, some curtained, some boarded up. Few people are out. Must be the cold. Heat\u2019s been spotty. Power, too. Johnny secretly loves the night view from his window, the scant golden squares scattered in the deep dusk.\n In the vestibule, the two men embrace like mourners, holding each other before they kiss. For all his experience, Chuck\u2019s a hasty lover. That\u2019s fine, Johnny thinks, he\u2019s not looking for excitement, only a little extra warmth in the bed. After finishing, they lie nude under the covers, watching daylight leak down the walls. Johnny says, \u201cHey, want to hear something funny?\u201d\n \u201cFire away,\u201d Chuck mumbles, half asleep.\n \u201cI was talking with Merv today. Merv the Perv?\u201d\n \u201cIs that the funny part?\u201d\n \u201cCome on, just listen.\u201d Johnny twists under the covers. \u201cWe were chatting about the news. The shortages, you know. Suddenly, he breaks out singing. Right in the phone. This folksy tune. Not the kind of thing you expect from a guy like Merv, huh?\u201d\n \u201cWhat was the song?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s called. Here\u2019s the thing, though. All the time he was singing, I had this feeling, like I\u2019d heard it before.\u201d\n \u201cI hate that feeling.\u201d\n \u201cNo, but this time I got it. I figured out where I know it from.\u201d\n \u201cYeah?\u201d\n \u201cMy Aunt Clari.\u201d\n \u201cFascinating,\u201d Chuck says.\n Johnny looks out the window, where stars crowd the sky, unobstructed by the waning lights. \u201cShe used to sing to me, when I was . . . oh, gosh, this must have been thirty years ago. That was when she came to live with us, when she couldn\u2019t keep looking after herself. I\u2019d go to her room, bring her dinner and things. And she\u2019d sing that song.\u201d\n \u201cOld women are the worst,\u201d Chuck says.\n \u201cI liked it, though. I don\u2019t think I understood, you know, what it means . . . well, to lose your faculties. I found it soothing. I\u2019d sit by her chair.\u201d\n \u201cHow\u2019s Merv doing these days, anyway?\u201d\n Johnny\u2019s silent. The city has tipped into night, plunging past the indefinite instant when shadows deepen from blue to black. Johnny can\u2019t see Chuck\u2019s face in the dark, not even the eyes, but he can hear the night noises, the hum of the fridge, a distant horn.\n \u201cThink about it,\u201d Johnny murmurs. \u201cLosing your mind. Not only your wits, but everything, all of it. Your memories, your past. Lovers. Friends. Jobs and hobbies. Even the names of your own children. And losing them so completely, so deeply, you don\u2019t even know they were there at all. The only things Aunt Clari remembered were things from her own childhood. Her dog, her brother. Like the rest of her life might as well not have happened. Like her whole soul froze at the age of nine.\u201d\n \u201cI guess that is as good a time as any,\u201d Chuck says.\n With the coming of night, the room has grown cold. Johnny pulls up the blanket. Chuck is talking in a drone, words tumbling out like electric signals, something preprogrammed, a canned announcement.\n \u201c . . . didn\u2019t want to just spring it on you. But it\u2019s happening. Tomorrow. It\u2019s all set up. I just . . . I can\u2019t stay in this place, anymore.\u201d\n Johnny listens from far away, like a child listening for a train in the night. He waits for a noise from the street to interrupt, a siren, a shout, a crash of cans. But there\u2019s nothing, the city is holding its breath, and Johnny realizes he\u2019s been expecting this, though his tongue is like cotton and his fingertips are cold.\n \u201cWhere to?\u201d he says.\n \u201cChicago.\u201d Chuck sighs. \u201cA part of me hates to leave, you know, but . . . I dunno, man. Lately\u2014it\u2019s strange. It\u2019s not like anything has changed. I just, I look around, and I see\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSlim pickings,\u201d Johnny says.\n \u201cYou understand.\u201d\n In the neighboring building, a window brightens. A woman strides through the room in sweatpants, holding a phone.\n \u201cJohnny? You understand, right?\u201d\n It\u2019s impossible, from here, to hear what the woman\u2019s saying, but Johnny can see her lips at the receiver, flexing in a regular rhythm, miming words to a lilting song. He squeezes Chuck\u2019s hand. He can picture the woman\u2019s voice, the lonely tune she\u2019s sending out into the night. The image is so clear, so vivid in his mind, that it doesn\u2019t surprise Johnny when Chuck sings along, his rough voice picking up the tune, tempo, phrasing, every old-fashioned phrase, every solitary word.\n 4\n It\u2019s over, Johnny decides. It\u2019s time.\n He takes a last turn through the apartment, a silent tour to say goodbye. He barely notices the objects he passes, the king-size bed, the cooler, the magazines. There\u2019s nothing in this place to hold him, now. The clothes in the closets, the pictures on the walls, are faded mementos of lives never lived, memorials to forgotten souls.\n The hard part, Johnny thinks, will be telling Byron. They don\u2019t communicate much, these days. When they do, it\u2019s rote, automatic, a matter of necessity. They have endless arguments about food and fuel. Fights over books and snacks and games. Quarrels over whether to lock the door.\n Johnny heads to the bedroom. He raids dressers, working slowly, stuffing a backpack full of socks. He tries to remember if they\u2019ve used this place before. In the old days, they wandered far afield, sleeping in new apartments every night, forcing open doors, whispering like graverobbers. Searching, always searching, for other people like themselves. But the buildings they found were shuttered and brooding, bereft of any sign of life, and now they now stick to the places they know, jumping from one apartment to another, traveling a circuit in the urban core.\n Johnny scrounges in a closet for tools. Flashlight, food, disinfectant, nails. There are times, even now, when he lets his mind wander, pondering the mystery of this vast empty town. Surely there were people here, at one time. Hands to raise these looming buildings, voices to crowd the empty caf\u00e9s. But whoever they were, they\u2019re long gone, leaving no clue to say where they fled. Only solitude, spreading in the streets like shadow, seeping from a million cold stones.\n Johnny finishes packing as the front door creaks. From the kitchen comes a rumble of cans, a muffled curse. Johnny finds Byron at the counter, sorting soup, his movements brusque and efficient. Byron sees the backpack.\n \u201cCome on, man.\u201d His eyes go dark. He looks beaten, resigned, but he puts out a hand.\n Johnny steps past him. Grabs a few cans. There was a time, way back, when they tried to mean something to one another. But their bond now is strictly survival-based. Byron\u2019s built like Stallone, not Johnny\u2019s type, and the sex they had was labored and joyless, both of them working to push aside the weight of half-forgotten feelings. One night, without thinking, Johnny called Byron, \u201cThe Slab.\u201d Their laughter faded into chilly silence, a ghost of mirth, waning into regret.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not pulling this crap again, are you?\u201d\n \u201cI have to.\u201d Johnny shoulders the pack. \u201cI have to try.\u201d\n \u201cSure. Then what? You\u2019ll be out there five hours, tops, then you\u2019ll come moping back.\u201d\n \u201cNo. Not this time.\u201d\n Johnny heads for the door. Byron stomps behind him, grabs a shoulder, and spins him around. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m getting sick of this human yo-yo crap. Get it through your head, Johnny. There is no one else out there. No one. Never will be, never was. Can\u2019t we be content with what we have?\u201d\n Johnny sags. Byron\u2019s right. Johnny knows he\u2019s right. But a spooky sensation, a specter of memory, has slowly built up inside Johnny\u2019s mind. With the wind weeping and sobbing outside, he shrugs off Byron\u2019s hand.\n \u201cSorry, man. This time it\u2019s for real.\u201d\n The streets are cluttered with abandoned cars. Johnny hunts for one with keys. By the time he\u2019s ready, the sun\u2019s going down. As darkness settles the unpeopled town, he wonders why he waited to leave. What\u2019s there to hold him in this place, anyway? A friend? A companion? A roommate? A lover? He can\u2019t recall a single face.\n Why has he spent his life in this ruin, Johnny wonders, wandering these empty streets? Was there ever someone to hold him here? He can\u2019t remember anything but these sidewalks, the tomb-like towers, the phantom halls.\n Johnny gets in the car and turns the key. He follows the highway north over the bridge, into a land of hills and cliffs. Snow powders the earth between the brown trees. There are houses, swimming pools, tidy lawns. Swing sets stand like props on a stage, waiting for actors to enter from the wings. Johnny knows no actors will be coming. The world has always looked this way, a project neglected by a lazy god.\n He scoffs. When will he give up these fantasies? When will he accept that this is how things are, an empty world inhabited by one lonely soul? There have never been other human beings, never will be, and he\u2019d better learn to accept that fact. Learn to be content with what he was, to simply give up and let things go.\n High in the hills, Johnny turns off the highway. He stops and parks and takes a stroll. The homes here are small, suburban, prim. Johnny dodges tipped garbage cans, scars of ice that mar the sidewalks.\n It shocks him, at first, when he finds the old house. But of course he\u2019s been heading here all along, he realizes, drawn to this particular door.\n The house is bland, a simple foursquare, rain gutters sagging like demented smiles. Johnny follows the root-heaved path. The porch welcomes him with a crooked grin. It\u2019s like no time has passed since he last stood here, like decades have been compacted into moments. He pushes open the broken door.\n The foyer\u2019s dark. A window has smashed. The living room is stiff with cold. Warped furniture crowds a moldy carpet. Johnny eases the door shut behind him. That\u2019s when he hears it.\n A voice upstairs.\n Johnny freezes. The voice carries on, singing faintly. Johnny heads for the water-warped stairs. On the landing, he pauses, a palm to the stucco. The tune is quaint, simple, soothing. Johnny\u2019s sure he\u2019s heard it before.\n He mounts the last stairs. As expected, a door stands ajar at the end of the hall.\n Johnny knows what he\u2019ll find in the room beyond. It shocks him, all the same, the sight of her there, those soft gray eyes, the startled merriment of her smile.\n \u201cWhy, Barry, what a wonderful surprise!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s Johnny, Aunt Clari,\u201d he says, stepping in. \u201cYour great nephew Johnny.\u201d\n She gropes for the handle on the side of the recliner. Her afghan slumps off her knees to the floor. She doesn\u2019t notice, she\u2019s too happy to see him, throwing out her hands, beckoning him forward. \u201cWhat brings you here, Barry?\u201d\n \u201cJohnny, Aunt Clari. You remember, right?\u201d\n \u201cOh, dear, don\u2019t tease me, I know who you are.\u201d She thumps the chair. \u201cCome. Sit with me.\u201d\n He kneels on the carpet. Reflections glint in her age-misted eyes as she smiles down, pressing her fingers to his hand. Outside, the sky is tarnished with dusk, houses shrunk to inky cutouts, every alley blotted with dark. Johnny considers how curious it is, that they\u2019ve lived here forever, just the two of them, alone in this enormous world. She strokes his cheek.\n \u201cYou came back, did you? I knew you wouldn\u2019t forget. Tell me, Barry, did you have fun?\u201d\n Johnny swallows the fear in his throat. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d he asks, voice shaking. \u201cHow do you face it, Aunt Clari?\u201d\n \u201cOh, child. Come here. Right here.\u201d\n He rests his head in her lap. As her fingers smooth his hair, he begins to sob.\n \u201cI\u2019m scared, Aunt Clari.\u201d\n \u201cNow, now. It\u2019s simple, dear. All you have to do is let go.\u201d\n In a shaky soprano, she begins to sing. Her voice falters, at first, but gradually strengthens, spreading through the vanishing sky, over the hills, and the extinguished stars, and all the fading folds of the Earth, until at last, in the darkness, he sings along with her.\n When the sheaves are gathered,When the geese have flown,Summer\u2019s ribbons stored away,Fruits and flowers grown,\n When the frost gleams on the glassWhere sun and raindrops shone,And winter\u2019s silver trims the turf,Where spring\u2019s new seeds were sown,\n Slumber, then, as night takes in,The forests, fields, and stones,And follow those who went beforeTo face the dark alo\u2014\n 5\n \u201cJohnny? Johnny?\u201d\n \u201cI think he\u2019s waking.\u201d\n Awareness spears through Johnny\u2019s mind. He can feel his thoughts stirring, stretching, collecting, scraps of consciousness struggling to cohere.\n \u201cJohnny?\u201d\n \u201cLet him take his time.\u201d\n Sun breaks in. Johnny opens his eyes. Residues of sleep still blur his sight, but he sees that the room is small and bright, and that two vague faces hang over the bed.\n \u201cThere he is. There\u2019s my guy.\u201d\n \u201cHis numbers look good.\u201d\n \u201cJohnny? Right here. Why does he look like that?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s probably confused. It takes time for the networks to self-organize.\u201d\n \u201cHe seems upset.\u201d\n \u201cGive it a sec.\u201d\n A hand presses Johnny\u2019s shoulder. The faces bend down. Johnny understands that something is required, a special effort, a mental feat. His mind is like honey, rich and thick.\n \u201cArmin.\u201d The name comes from somewhere deep inside, a bubble of memory bursting on his lips.\n \u201cThere we go!\u201d The faces draw back. Hands clap. \u201cBravo, Johnny!\u201d\n Armin, Armin. Johnny knows him now, dear old Armin, the white hair, the wrinkled hands. In one ecstatic explosion, it all comes back.\n \u201cYou\u2019re Doctor Natarajan.\u201d\n \u201cNow we\u2019re cooking.\u201d The doctor pokes a machine. \u201cHis major nodes are lighting up. You\u2019ll see exponential progress now.\u201d\n It\u2019s happening in a rush, memories stampeding back, faces, places, names, details. An almost tactile tingle as the facts sock home. Johnny laughs.\n \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d Armin grins. \u201cShould I call \u2019em in?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think it can hurt.\u201d Doctor Natarajan goes to the door.\n A moment later, the room is filled with figures. Johnny sees cardigans, khakis, canes. Familiar faces smile down. Johnny points.\n \u201cByron. Roger. Jheri. Chuck. And you\u2019re Merv. Merv the Perv. Where\u2019s Kip? Is Kip here?\u201d\n \u201cKip couldn\u2019t make it. He\u2019ll see you at the house.\u201d Armin glances at the doctor. \u201cWhen do you think . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll have to keep an eye on those numbers. Unless something changes, though . . . \u201d Her eyes skim the screen. \u201cLooking at these trend lines? I\u2019d call this a success.\u201d\n It\u2019s a party, that noon, in the clinic cafeteria. There are gallons of coffee, a stale pound cake, heaps of cookies from the gluten-free caf\u00e9. And streams of giddy, endless questions, testing the miracle of Johnny\u2019s new mind.\n \u201cHow about that time in oh-eight, Johnny, huh? \u2019Member that? The camping trip?\u201d\n \u201cWhat about eighty-six? That horrible year?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the seventies. You remember the seventies? \u2019Cause I sure don\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d someone says. \u201cI mean, that so many of us made it through?\u201d\n The laughter is incessant, excessive, celebratory, commemorating not only Johnny\u2019s recovery, but the power of memory, the depth of the past. Joys and sorrows, lives, and loves, crash over Johnny in a stupefying flood. He\u2019s grateful when Armin guides him to the door.\n \u201cAll right, guys, I think he could use a break. Till next week, right? Goodbye, goodbye . . . \u201d\n After all the fuss, the recovery room is eerily silent. Light through the window reflects off steel railings, tinting the air the color of leaves.\n \u201cWell.\u201d Johnny sits. \u201cThat was exhausting.\u201d\n Armin grins. \u201cThey\u2019ve been waiting for weeks to come by. I wasn\u2019t sure what to tell them.\u201d\n Johnny reaches for Armin\u2019s hands. It\u2019s hard to convey everything he\u2019s feeling now, the drowning abundance of moods and impressions that seem to assail him with every new second. \u201cListen.\u201d He pauses, biting his tongue. \u201cWhen I was under just now\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOh, the operation was nothing.\u201d Armin waves. \u201cIt was the pre-op that did us in.\u201d\n \u201cPre-op. Sure. But while I was out, did I . . . did I do anything, or say anything . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cYou did, actually.\u201d Armin\u2019s mouth quirks up. \u201cYou were singing.\u201d\n \u201cSinging?\u201d\n \u201cSort of a funny old song. Didn\u2019t catch the words. Why? Does it mean something?\u201d\n Johnny\u2019s eyes slide to the window. The spring air is golden, leaves swishing against the glass. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so. I just . . . did you ever wonder?\u201d Johnny grasps empty air. \u201cAll those cells they killed\u2014\u201d\n \u201cReplaced,\u201d Armin corrects.\n \u201cReplaced, of course. But I mean, they had to kill the old ones first.\u201d\n \u201cThey were sick.\u201d Armin shrugs. \u201cThey were dying, diseased. Anyway, the individual neurons don\u2019t matter, right? It\u2019s the pattern. The network. The structure of the brain.\u201d\n \u201cSure. Networks. I know, I just . . . \u201d Johnny sits, mouth open, waiting for a thought to surface, a worry he\u2019s forgotten, a doubt he\u2019s misplaced.\n \u201cListen.\u201d Armin points at him, bang, between the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re here. You\u2019re you. You\u2019re alive and handsome and old as shit, and you\u2019re all, all mine. So what do you have to complain about, champ?\u201d\n Johnny grins, looking down at their clasped, wrinkled hands. \u201cI just, I wonder about it, I guess. What it was like for him. You know?\u201d\n \u201cHim?\u201d\n \u201cSure.\u201d Johnny taps his brow. \u201cThe old brain. The old Johnny. The one they replaced.\u201d He pauses, frowning, thinking it over. \u201cThe guy who used to be in my head.\u201d\n On the ride home, the streets are jammed with traffic, every intersection a riot of cars.\n \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Johnny says.\n \u201cDo what?\u201d\n \u201cYou were singing.\u201d\n \u201cI was?\u201d\n \u201cUnder your breath.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with singing?\u201d\n Johnny doesn\u2019t answer. He reaches for the radio. It\u2019s a little thing, a very little thing. But right now, he\u2019d like to have some music.\n Something light, preferably.\n Something new."}

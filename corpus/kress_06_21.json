For six long, working-into-the-evening days, we\u2019d gotten only the faintest of quantum signals, nothing usable. Our grant only gave us three weeks on the TU Delft equipment. Cora complained that Americans somehow seem to never get as much quantum-tech time as anybody else, which wasn\u2019t fair . . . but, then, what didn\u2019t Cora complain about?\n I said, \u201cCan you lock onto the signal? Is it strong enough?\u201d\n \u201cYes! And\u2014oh my gods you won\u2019t believe this\u2014the subject is looking into a mirror!\u201d\n I didn\u2019t know how she could tell that; the image on her screen was so watery and shifting it looked as if it were melting. Frantically Cora worked the amplifying equipment, her fingers flying over keys and buttons. If she couldn\u2019t bring the image into sharper focus within the next few seconds, we\u2019d lose this subject, too.\n The portrait emerged. Cora breathed, \u201cThe clothing is right, wool, simple cut . . . Come on, you fucker, focus!\u201d And then, \u201cBe Vermeer!\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t. The image sharpening on the screen was a plain-faced, middle-aged woman in an unadorned gray gown laced up the front, no trimming on the round neck of her chemise, who stood pulling her hair into a tight bun. As the shimmering image approached maximum resolution, she set a white cap with lappets on her head.\n Cora froze the picture, locking in the contact, and pounded her fist on the small table holding her coffee. The coffee cup jumped with each blow. \u201cFuck, fuck, fuck! It\u2019s not him!\u201d\n We\u2019d been looking for Johannes Vermeer anywhere in mid-seventeenth century. It wasn\u2019t that much of a long shot; Vermeer never left Delft and creative people put out the strongest signals. Unfortunately, that sometimes led to those who lived with creatives. Two other postdocs in my year, based at Great Neck on Long Island, New York, had locked onto F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s gardener, who had never exchanged a single word with either Scott or Zelda and whose memories consisted largely of plant blight.\n I said to Cora, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s someone in Vermeer\u2019s household? Catharina?\u201d\n \u201cDressed like that? Don\u2019t be stupid! And look at the time indicator\u20141687! Vermeer was already dead. Oh, just shoot me now.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t apologize for that remark. Probably she didn\u2019t even see that she should. Disappointment always turned Cora nasty.\n She said, \u201cNow we\u2019re stuck with this, and from her clothing she\u2019s a nonentity, neither servant nor creator. Well, get Jan.\u201d\n \u201cI already pinged him.\u201d No apology for her nastiness; there never was.\n An initial signal, the only one with a time indicator, locked the equipment onto a subject. Otherwise, signals would not be reliable, or reliably accessed. Too many researchers never found anyone during their grant time; we could not afford to risk letting this subject go and starting again.\n Jan de Knuyt appeared in the doorway. An historian of seventeenth-century Europe, he spoke five languages plus Latin. His doctorate was granted last year, and while he searched for a university position, he aided whatever visiting brain researchers had been fortunate enough to gain time on TU Delft\u2019s superb equipment. Slightly built, shy, and occasionally awkward, he had an excellent reputation as a thorough researcher.\n Jan smiled at me and said in his careful English with its Dutch accent, \u201cWhom have you locked?\u201d\n \u201cGod knows,\u201d Cora said. \u201cAnything you can tell us from the scan . . . it\u2019s not fair! She\u2019s probably nobody!\u201d\n Jan studied the image frozen on Elena\u2019s screen. \u201cYes and no. She is not a creative, but she may be rewarding.\u201d\n I blurted, \u201cYou recognize her?\u201d\n \u201cI do. She is Maria van Leeuwenhoek, the daughter of Antonj van Leeuwenhoek.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Cora said.\n \u201cYes. There is only one known sketch of her, by the artist who made some of the drawings of Leeuwenhoek\u2019s \u2018little animals.\u2019 Leeuwenhoek himself couldn\u2019t draw, you know. His second wife was sickly, and so Maria ran the household and occasionally assisted her father as he founded the science of microbiology.\u201d\n Jan smiled at me. \u201cElena, you may receive some quite interesting experiences.\u201d\n The pairing of an engineer with a receiver is an art, not a science. I didn\u2019t like Cora, and Cora didn\u2019t like much of anybody, but I appreciated her skill. Cross-temporal brain research, too, is as much an art as a science, although not in Cora\u2019s view. She was interested in equipment, results, and ambitious publication.\n For two centuries scientists have known that the brain exudes an electromagnetic field, and for nearly a century, that it operates on entangled quantum effects. The Chen equations upended brain research when the brilliant researcher Luuk Meijer showed that in conjunction with tachyons, the equations implied the theoretical possibility of entangling brains separated by centuries\u2014but only in certain suggestible persons with certain brain-activity patterns. Ten years later, engineers at Technische Universiteit Delft had created the equipment, however imperfectly, and the Netherlands became the center of world research into Meijer entanglements.\n Nothing about a Meijer entanglement is certain.\n The subject is usually, but not always, a creative person, someone whose mind is as much concerned with what does not exist as with what does (Fitzgerald\u2019s gardener wrote poetry, badly). The receiver must be a \u201csensitive and suggestible personality\u201d and is usually, but not always, a borderline depressive. Memories drawn from the subject are usually, but not always, emotional recollections that made strong impressions on him or her. Memories are, usually but not always, clear enough to make sense of. The receiver can usually, but not always, remember the experiences copied from the subject\u2019s mind and usually, but not always, sort them out from the receiver\u2019s own life experiences: Did this happen to the subject or did it happen to me? Borderline depressives with intensive training and good real-world memories are best at this. No one knows why.\n I am a strongly suggestible, borderline depressive with a good memory and superb training.\n And unlike Cora or Jan or the professors in my very expensive education, I am beginning to think the entire process is unjust to everyone, in every time.\n The UT Delft campus, rebuilt in the Brutalist style decades ago when it was moved out of city, is a charmless collection of rectangular buildings in a charmless suburb. I had insisted on living in the old city, and not with Cora. I paid for my tiny apartment, expensive but worth it, by borrowing against the coming inheritance from my father. Just getting off the Hyper-Loop at Market Square lifted my heart. Against the sunset, Nieuwe Kerk\u2019s magnificent bell tower stood shadowed over its lower third, golden above. Built in the fourteenth century, the cathedral housed the tombs of kings, queens, and princes of the House of Orange\u2014and whose imagination would not be fired by that?\n Maria van Leeuwenhoek, going to market for her father, would have seen Nieuwe Kerk every day.\n As I hurried over a stone bridge spanning a canal, the tower carillon chimed a quarter to nine. I couldn\u2019t be late with my phone call to Layla. She didn\u2019t endure any deviation from routine as well as she had before . . .\n Just \u201cbefore.\u201d\n In the seclusion of my apartment, I poured a glass of scotch (\u201cDutch courage\u201d\u2014and where did that phrase come from? Jan would know.). I gulped a healthy mouthful and said to the wall screen, \u201cPhone Layla McCarthy.\u201d A second later the face of my beautiful younger sister appeared on the screen.\n Noon in California. Layla stood in glaring sunlight in our dead father\u2019s bedroom. Chaos surrounded her: packing boxes, clothing, items pulled from closets or drawers, rug rolled into a haphazard cylinder, paintings pulled from walls. But today Layla seemed able to cope, unlike yesterday. She was out of her bathrobe; her hair was combed; her gaze met mine; no dead look in her eyes. She even managed a faint smile.\n \u201cMorning, Ellie. This probably doesn\u2019t look like progress, but it is. Those boxes there\u2014\u201d she pointed \u201c\u2014go to the Salvation Army. That big box is trash. The art I\u2019m going to have appraised.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re doing a wonderful job,\u201d I said, as apprehension was replaced by guilt. I should be there helping Layla sort through our father\u2019s things, put the house on the market, meet with the estate lawyer. On the other hand, maybe all this activity was good for Layla, taking her out of herself. I could still see tension in the way her body held itself, the tension that never really left her, but compared to yesterday\u2019s monochrome lethargy, Layla looked okay.\n Oh, God, please let her be okay. Not like\u2014say it, Elena, if only to yourself\u2014not like Daddy.\n She said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going in Delft?\u201d\n Another good sign: interest in someone else.\n \u201cWe locked onto a subject. Not, however, Vermeer.\u201d\n I told her about the lock, but only until I could see her interest drift away. It didn\u2019t take long. We talked then about the house: who might buy it, what they might pay, what needed to be done before it went on the market, and who needed to be hired to do it. Layla didn\u2019t talk long, but she did talk, and when she ended the call, I poured away the rest of my Scotch. I didn\u2019t need it. Layla was functional, at least for the moment, and I could concentrate on tomorrow in the lab.\n The rest of the evening, I studied the file Jan sent me about Maria van Leeuwenhoek. Born in 1656, she was the only survivor of the six children Leeuwenhoek fathered with two wives. Maria\u2019s mother died when Maria was eleven. She acquired a stepmother, Cornelia, in 1671, the same year that Leeuwenhoek began making microscopes, which put him on the path to discovering the astonishing worlds of his microscopic \u201canimalcules.\u201d\n Cornelia went into a deep depression after the death of her infant son and some authorities thought she left Leeuwenhoek\u2019s home to live with her sister\u2019s family. Maria assumed the running of the modest household. She may also have assisted her father with his work. She never married, never left his house. She buried Leeuwenhoek when he died, at age ninety, and sent some microscopes that her father had willed to the Royal Society of London For Improving Natural Knowledge. When Maria was eighty-three, she arranged to have a monument set up on his grave. Jan had translated into English the short inscription, although my immersive language training in Dutch could probably have caught the gist of the epitaph. Birth and death dates, membership in the Royal Society, and a poem by someone named Huibert Corneliszoon Poot, urging visitors to have reverence for Leeuwenhoek\u2019s great age and \u201cwondrous merit.\u201d Maria was buried beside him, but without any poem; mere daughters didn\u2019t get poems. She was ninety-five.\n And that was it\u2014all the verifiable information that history had on Maria van Leeuwenhoek.\n Still, I was glad of Jan\u2019s file. If you\u2019re going to invade someone\u2019s mind, it\u2019s good to know whatever you can about who she might be.\n First contact with a subject is exciting and fearful both: an explorer\u2019s voyage into a new world. I was experienced enough as a receiver to know my mind would not disappear irretrievably into the subject\u2019s mind (it has happened). But Maria and I would become locked, and every time Cora hooked up the electrodes implanted in my brain to her complex equipment, it was Maria\u2019s memories I would explore. She would, of course, never know I was there. Unlike the explorers to the New World during the Dutch golden age, I would alter nothing, an invisible presence.\n And her presence in my mind? Sometimes a Meijer Entanglement was sharp and yielded clear images and words. Other times, not so much. A researcher in Copenhagen had managed to lock onto Werner Heisenberg during his famous World War II visit to the Jewish physicist Niels Bohr, Heisenberg\u2019s former mentor, in Nazi-occupied Denmark. However, the entanglement had yielded only the vaguest images and no dialogue at all. All the receiver had gotten was Heisenberg\u2019s strong emotion of urgency\u2014but about what? That Bohr should save his own life by joining the Nazi bomb effort? That he should try to get out of occupied Denmark if he still could? Historians of science reached epic heights of frustration over that one.\n \u201cReady?\u201d Cora said to me.\n I lay on a cot, hooked to computers that included state-of-the-art deep-image reconstruction equipment, technology that had existed for fifty years but recently taken a punctuated-evolution leap. It would translate my brain waves into AI-enhanced images, but it could not capture words. Immediately after the session, I would record whatever was said by and to Maria, assuming the words were clear enough and my immersive training in Dutch extensive enough. Jan would help with that. I glimpsed him entering the room and standing respectfully at the back, behind the physician mandatory for all first contacts.\n I closed my eyes and said, \u201cReady.\u201d\n The lab went away, and another room took its place, a room of wide-planked wooden floors, small-mullioned windows behind partially closed shutters, candles burning in wall sconces. Maria\u2019s\u2014now my\u2014memories were shifty, not yet sharp.\n A woman lies on a curtained bed; she is clearly dead. Other people stand on the far side of the bed, although not Leuwenhoek himself. A tsunami of childish grief swells through my mind as I become accustomed to being Maria and move deeper into her/our memory.\n I kneel and touch the dead woman\u2019s face. \u201cMutter!\u201d\n Someone pulls me to my feet and gently leads me from the room and down a narrow hallway to Father\u2019s workroom. Father sits reading a book. He looks up as I tell him that Mother is dead.\n The memory wavered again; I still hadn\u2019t completely settled into Maria\u2019s mind. Leeuwenhoek\u2019s reply to her was too complicated for me to catch all of it, but I saw the brief and perfunctory look of sorrow on his face. And as he held up the book and babbled on, I heard a word in unexpected English.\n Then, abruptly, I was fully there.\n Anger rises in me, anger I must not show Father. I bow my head and back out from the room.\n Maria dissolved in my mind. I was myself again, the entanglement collapsed.\n I sat up even before the doctor could check my vitals or Cora disconnect my implants. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get all the Dutch when Leeuwenhoek was speaking. But I think he said he was sorry that Maria\u2019s mother\u2014he did not say \u2018my wife\u2019\u2014had died, but most of what he said pertained to a book he\u2019d been reading. And he said a word in English. \u2018Microphagia.\u2019\u201d\n Jan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYes? You are sure? Microphagia?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sure. What is that?\u201d\n Cora said, \u201cWe need to record the dialogue before Elena forgets it!\u201d\n \u201cI won\u2019t forget it,\u201d I said.\n Jan said, \u201cYou were in 1666, the year Barbara van Leeuwenhoek died. The year before, Robert Hooke published Micrographia, the first book about items viewed through a microscope. It is speculated that the book was what started Leeuwenhoek thinking about how to build a much better microscope. But Leeuwenhoek couldn\u2019t read English, so perhaps at this time he merely studied the pictures? Could you tell?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n Cora said, \u201cRecord the damn dialogue!\u201d\n We did. Afterward, Jan said quietly, \u201cYou are distressed. Because Leeuwenhoek was more interested in the book than in his wife\u2019s death.\u201d\n \u201cOr his daughter,\u201d I said. \u201cShe was eleven years old!\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Jan said, and in his voice I heard the empathy that had been missing from Leeuwenhoek. \u201cIn all contemporary accounts Leeuwenhoek is portrayed as unemotional, even cold. His work mattered supremely to him.\u201d\n \u201cOh, who cares what mattered most to him,\u201d Cora said. \u201cThese images are okay for a first contact. If you can sharpen them as we go on, Elena, publication should get us both really good tenure-track offers! Are you up for a second session right away? Doctor?\u201d\n The physician who\u2019d taken my vital signs said in English that my degree of weakness was usual after a session but not excessive.\n Cora turned to me. \u201cDoctor says you\u2019re good to go!\u201d\n I didn\u2019t want to. Maria\u2019s grief still pulled at my mind, as debilitating for me as my fatigue. It is draining to inhabit two minds at once, and not easy to shed feelings acquired from the mind not one\u2019s own. But maybe the next session would be happier, dispelling the emotion of the previous one. That happened sometimes. But if the second session was also unhappy . . .\n Jan watched my face. \u201cYou are not required, Elena.\u201d\n \u201cNo. I want to.\u201d\n \u201cBrilliant!\u201d Cora said. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\n This session was entirely different.\n I hurry along a canal edged with poplars, the Nieuwe Kerk bell tower receding behind me in the pink-and-gold dawn. Frost silvers the ground. I pull my shawl more tightly around my breasts. Bells chime, the sound clear but not as loud as the single word I whisper over and over\u2014a song, a prayer\u2014Willem, Willem, Willem . . .\n Willem?\n He waits beside the canal, leaning against a tree, straightening the moment he sees me and rushing forward. Then I am crushed against the full-skirted blue coat of his uniform. Our lips find each other, and sweetness blossoms in me, and I am so light, lighter than air, in a moment that I wish to last forever.\n He murmurs, \u201cI love you,\u201d and I murmur back, \u201cForever.\u201d\n Between kisses, Willem tells me he must go, his something, and why, but he will return soon. \u201cMy father,\u201d I say, and Willem answers that he will talk to my father, we will be together, we will marry. All when the war is over.\n The carillon in the city sounds again, and then he is gone. But my happiness remains, even as I hurry home, even as the bells chime that \u201cforever\u201d has been less than fifteen minutes.\n The entanglement collapsed as Maria\u2019s emotion calmed. I was back in the TU Delft lab. No Willem, no bright dreams of youth, just the doctor running his instruments over my heart, head, and wrist as Cora cawed triumphantly.\n \u201cMuch clearer this time! Brilliant! What was the dialogue?\u201d\n I repeated it all, including the Dutch words I didn\u2019t know when Willem was explaining why he must leave. I looked inquiringly at Jan.\n He said, \u201cWillem said his company was ready to march that day. He wore a fusilier\u2019s uniform, probably from the Third Anglo-Dutch War.I will need to research more. If it is so, the year is between 1672 and 1674. Maria is sixteen or seventeen or eighteen. The war with England took place mostly at sea, but the Dutch Republic was also at war with England\u2019s ally, France, and the land fighting took heavy casualties. Very heavy.\u201d\n He did not need to say more. Maria van Leeuwenhoek never married, never left her father\u2019s house. But I had not experienced Willem\u2019s future death, if that was what had happened, only her happiness by the canal, and that happiness lingered in my mind like the scent of roses after one has left the garden.\n Maybe that residual, secondhand happiness showed on my face. Because Jan\u2014shy, formal, awkward when not discussing history\u2014stopped me in the corridor and asked me to dinner. And I might have said yes, even though two sessions had left me very tired, except that he added, \u201cBut I will understand if it is too soon after your father.\u201d\n He knew. How much did he know? All of it? He was, after all, a researcher.\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said, far too harshly. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n I moved away from him.\n Borderline depressives learn to make themselves do the things they know will lift their mood. Mine had been crashed by my own unfair rudeness to Jan. So despite the fatigue of a double session, I walked much of the way home, the afternoon sun warm on my face. Poplars, straight and strong as soldiers, were doubled in the water of the canals. As I entered Market Square, the Nieuwe Kerk bell ringer began to play the carillon for a summer concert. The bells sounded fuller, richer than in Maria\u2019s time; there were more of them. I sat in a caf\u00e9 with a glass of wine, savoring it, and watched bicycles cross the square, tourists gawk at the cathedral, children chase pigeons.\n There are sometimes advantages to being a \u201csuggestible person,\u201d even if the \u201csuggestions\u201d come from oneself. I lost myself in the wine, the music, the lovely light on the face of the bell tower. I let them all wash me free of the seventeenth century, and of my own.\n 2.\n Cora said, \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the Loop was\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care. Get ready for the session.\u201d\n I glanced at Jan, who looked embarrassed. This third session seemed unpleasant even before it began.\n But not after I entered Maria\u2019s brain. Then things were only strange.\n I stand beside Father, holding out my index finger. A sharp jab\u2014he rams a small knife into my finger and bright red blossoms on the tip. Carefully, he fastens the pin to the platform of his latest small, single-lensed microscope, holds it to the light, and begins moving the screw that adjusted distance. I put my finger into my mouth and suck on it. \u201cI may go now, Father?\u201d\n \u201cCertainly not. You will take notes. Pieter!\u201d\n The elderly artist comes forward, carrying paper and pen.\n I say, \u201cBut I must go now. To . . . to church.\u201d\n Father frowns up at me and says what he always says, \u201cDomheid. Waanvoorstellingen. I need you here.\u201d\n \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n \u201cEnough! Bring the book!\u201d\n Resentment. Despair. Obedience.\n The entanglement collapsed.\n \u201cGood enough, I guess,\u201d Cora said grudgingly. \u201cThe images aren\u2019t as sharp as yesterday\u2019s second session. Don\u2019t get sloppy on me, Elena!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not my \u2018sloppiness,\u2019\u201d I said. God, I disliked her. \u201cThe session was . . . strange. Maria was distracted. Half her mind was filled with an image of Willem. I had the impression she was supposed to meet him at the church, until her father derailed that. Jan, what does \u2018domheid\u2019 mean?\u201d\n \u201cStupidity.\u201d\n \u201cAnd \u2018waanvoorstellingen\u2019?\u201d\n \u201cDelusion. Which of them said that?\u201d\n \u201cAntonj, to Maria.\u201d\n \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n \u201cGoing to church. She said\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIf the historian doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d Cora said, \u201cmaybe we could get Elena\u2019s recollections of the conversation recorded before she forgets its sequence?\u201d\n So it was Jan that she was furious with. Why?\n He smiled at me. \u201cWe will start from the beginning, then. But first, I will say only that Leeuwenhoek had the reputation of being\u2014what is it you Americans say? A \u2018stone-cold rationalist,\u2019 scornful of the beliefs of anything supernatural. For him, there existed nothing he could not touch or see.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think Maria was really going to church. I think she was supposed to meet Willem in Nieuwe Kerk.\u201d\n \u201cYou think?\u201d Cora said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know? You were there in her memories! God!\u201d\n Jan said mildly, \u201cMemories carry secondary impressions and emotion. Those are also information. In 1674 Leeuwenhoek wrote to the Royal Society about examining blood cells. So now we have the information that in that year Willem is not yet gone from Maria\u2019s life. Yes, Cora, we will begin now.\u201d\n My call to Layla\u2019s cell was answered by our cousin Donna and cold slid down my spine.\n \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n \u201cBack in the hospital,\u201d Donna said. \u201cYour father\u2019s neighbor called me. I\u2019m sorry, Elena.\u201d But Donna\u2019s voice held undertones of impatience. She had never said so outright, but I knew that at some level, Donna considered depression, even clinical depression, to be a selfish indulgence. She believed in the worst of brisk-people clich\u00e9s: \u201cJust snap out of it.\u201d \u201cJust get on with it.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t think about yourself so much.\u201d Domheid. Waanvoorstellingen.\n I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n \u201cLayla had an . . . an \u2018episode.\u2019 She climbed onto the roof and threatened to jump off. The police talked her down.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll get on a plane tonight if there\u2019s a flight, be there by tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cNo. Don\u2019t.\u201d Donna held the phone closer to her face, as if that could better convince me. Two decades older than Layla and me, she suddenly reminded me of the middle-aged Maria of my initial lock, the woman whose memories I was plundering every afternoon.\n \u201cListen, Elena. You can\u2019t do any good here. The doctor told me that Layla can\u2019t have any visitors or other outside contact for at least a week. Part of the \u2018treatment.\u2019 You might better stay where you are and just get on with your research.\u201d\n \u201cWe have twelve days left on the equipment.\u201d\n \u201cTake it all,\u201d Donna said, even though I was sure she didn\u2019t know what my research was and would not have approved of it if she had known: \u201cHow is that useful?\u201d Donna might look like Maria van Leeuwenhoek, but inside she was more like what Jan had called Antonj: a stone-cold rationalist.\n I said, \u201cWill you visit Layla as soon as it\u2019s allowed and then call me right away?\u201d\n \u201cYes. Do you want her doctors\u2019 numbers?\u201d\n \u201cI have them.\u201d\n \u201cOf course you do,\u201d Donna said, and in her voice I heard her knowledge of not only Layla\u2019s previous stays in Briarcliff Hospital, but also of everything about my father\u2019s death. Or was that just my \u201csensitive suggestibility\u201d?\n \u201cThank you, Donna,\u201d I said.\n Her face softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this is happening to you,\u201d she said, and even though this time the words were genuine, I wanted to yell at her that it was not happening to me, it was happening to Layla, just as it had happened to Daddy, and neither of them could help it. Donna should be thanking any gods she believed in\u2014probably none\u2014that the wayward luck of the family genetic curse had spared her, as it had partially spared me.\n There is no accounting for genes.\n In the next day\u2019s session, Maria wore the merciless black of mourning.\n \u201cWear . . . more of cheerful . . . \u201d Father snaps. I don\u2019t answer, and he shakes his head and turns back to his everlasting work. I sit beside him and write down everything he says, measurements and procedures and descriptions. He will use my notes to write his letters to the Royal Society. Pieter waits on a stool for his turn to look through the microscope and make his drawings. Wood specimen, hairs from his wig, scum from his teeth\u2014it all takes a long time.\n Someone halloos at the door.\n \u201c . . . not open,\u201d Father says. \u201cIntruders.\u201d\n I rise and peer through a crack in the closed shutters. \u201c . . . the butcher\u2019s boy, Father. He brings . . . \u201d\n \u201cReceive the meat. Pieter . . . this\u2014\u201d\n I go to the door, receive the meat, give the boy his coins. I hand the meat to Jozefien, who bobs a curtsey. I pour a drink of water from the jug. I stand still, not drinking it.\n Again, the images in my mind were watery, half-formed, and I was catching only a few words of each speech. Maria was not paying attention to her own life. The image of Willem was almost as solid in her mind as the objects in the room, an image suffused with despair. Why had the older Maria remembered this day at all? It must have been like so many others of assisting her autocratic father with his work, mourning her lost soldier.\n \u201cMaria! Come!\u201d\n Excitement in Father\u2019s voice. I hurry into the workroom, where Father holds up a tiny microscope, peering at something on the pin. \u201cLook!\u201d\n \u201cI do not want\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLook!\u201d\n Resentfully, I do as I am told\u2014and nearly drop the microscope in surprise.\n \u201cStupid girl! Take care!\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n Father\u2014Father!\u2014is grinning like a boy. Pieter rises, pen in hand, staring at both of us in bewilderment. Father speaks\u2014\n \u2014words that I, Elena, had carefully memorized in Dutch\u2014\n \u2014and says, \u201cLittle animals.\u201d\n \u201cAgain, 1674,\u201d Jan said when the long session finally ended. \u201cThat was the year Leeuwenhoek first saw his \u2018animalcules\u2019 in water from Lake Berkelse. No one, not even Hooke, had ever seen them before.\u201d\n \u201cTouchdown!\u201d Cora exulted. \u201cWe got it!\u201d\n Jan continued as if she were not capering grotesquely around the lab. \u201cHe sent descriptions and drawings to the Royal Society, saying that the motion of the \u2018animalcules\u2019 was \u2018wondrous to see\u2019 and also\u2014Elena, are you all right?\u201d\n \u201cHeadache.\u201d I sat up on the cot, which only made the headache worse.\n \u201cRecord the dialogue before you forget it,\u201d Cora said. \u201cNow!\u201d\n Jan said, \u201cElena\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThere are three of us in there,\u201d I blurted. \u201cNot just two.\u201d\n \u201cThree?\u201d Jan said.\n \u201cMe, Maria, and her memory of Willem. It\u2019s so strong that it\u2019s almost another presence. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it.\u201d\n \u201cThe dialogue!\u201d Cora said. \u201cNow, or it won\u2019t count as \u2018immediately post-session\u2019!\u201d\n We recorded the dialogue. My headache grew worse. Jan\u2019s warm brown eyes watched me with concern. That was almost as disconcerting as the session. I gave concern\u2014for Layla, for Daddy. I didn\u2019t receive it.\n Receive the meat\u2014\n I leaned over the side of my chair and vomited on the floor.\n Jan insisted on taking me home in his tiny drivie. Cora watched us go, and as he put a hand under my elbow to guide me down the steps, I glimpsed Cora\u2019s face. So that was why she had been so irritable with him yesterday, so cold today. She\u2019d come on to him and he\u2019d refused.\n As the car drove itself through Market Square, I said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t come in. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n \u201cAll right,\u201d Jan said. \u201cBut you will phone me if you feel worse? I am listed with the university contacts.\u201d\n \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I said, knowing I would not. Not phone him, and not get worse, either, because tonight I needed to talk to Layla\u2019s doctor.\n I might not have bothered. Layla was \u201cthe same.\u201d Nothing had changed.\n This is what happens when your last parent dies. There is a lot of paperwork; in the modern world, it is bureaucratically complicated to die. A funeral must be arranged. Neighbors bring casseroles and cakes and pans of lasagna, none of which you want. You and your siblings feel orphaned, no matter how old you are. Eventually at least one of you must deal with your dead parent\u2019s clothing, furniture, house. If that person is not you, you feel guilty for not helping.\n This is what happens when your last parent turns a nine-millimeter Glock on first his beloved dog and then on himself in the back garden of an upscale suburb in which normally nothing violent ever happens. Police surround the property with yellow crime scene tape. Detectives question horrified neighbors. A forensic team photographs everything and measures all blood spatters that have not drained into the soil. Afterward, neighbors avoid you and your sister, but the press invades the sidewalk, tries for photos through windows, phones you for quotes. Because of the dog, social media explodes with information about your parent, with disinformation, with vicious attacks, with arguments about whether clinical depression can lead to violence or if that is slanderous prejudice. Even if you do not share your parent\u2019s surname, you are suspect: Might you do the same thing? Do you own a dog? Has the SPCA looked into your dog\u2019s welfare? If any offsprings\u2019 medical records, laughably easy to hack, show a hospitalization for clinical depression, the offspring is treated as if they are a pet-murderer-in-waiting.\n And still someone must deal with the clothing, furniture, house. If it\u2019s not you, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2014and many others\u2014will blame you. Even if your excuse is a once-in-a-decade chance at a time slot on the planet\u2019s most sophisticated neurological equipment for an emerging scientific discipline.\n I had gambled that Layla, who\u2019d handled Daddy\u2019s death better than I\u2019d dared hope, would be all right alone for three weeks. I\u2019d gambled that her depression would not rekindle. I\u2019d gambled, and I lost. Worse, so had Layla.\n My fault.\n My guilt.\n 3.\n Early in the morning, I rebooked my flight home for the day after tomorrow. I informed the university that we would do three sessions today and two tomorrow, but those would be our last. Cora wouldn\u2019t like it. She would have planned on more sessions. A growing body of research showed that received memories were always stronger and more detailed with at least one day of rest between sessions.\n Cora exploded. \u201cNo! Fuck it, Elena, that\u2019s not fair to me! We\u2019re coauthors here, don\u2019t be so selfish!\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I have to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou have to fulfill the contract we signed with TU! What\u2019s so important that it can\u2019t wait an extra week? Another family shooting?\u201d\n Instantly Jan was standing in front of Cora, his slight body somehow menacing. \u201cShut up, Cora,\u201d he said, another Americanism that, despite everything, made me blink.\n Cora took a step backward, scowled, but managed a choked, \u201cSorry.\u201d And in that atmosphere, we began work.\n I hurry home from Nieuwe Kerk, Willem strong in my mind. Father waits in the front hall, scowling. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d\n I don\u2019t answer, but as I take off my cloak and hand it to Jozefien, he stares at the tiny gold cross I now wear on a chain.\n \u201cChurch, Maria? Domheid. Waanvoorstellingen. They feed you lies: zielen, engelen. There is no ziel inside you, Daughter. The world is what you see, what I see in my lens. The rest is fairy stories.\u201d\n I am confused. He speaks to me with kindness, with\u2014no, not understanding, something else. Pity?\n I am more confused when he takes my hand and leads me into his study, Jozefien staring open-mouthed after us.\n Father hands me a microscope. \u201cSee what I have found, Maria. We must record this.\u201d\n I look through the lens. Tadpoles with long, thin tails swim like eels, but these are far too small to be tadpoles. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d\n Father seems embarrassed, further confusing me. \u201cThey are from my . . . my seed. This is where life comes. In each of those animalcules is contained everything necessary to form a child.\u201d\n \u201cAnd the mother?\u201d\n \u201cShe houses the growing child.\u201d And then, as Jozefien brings in a tray with cheese, ale, and fragrant new bread for Father\u2019s dinner, he adds whimsically, \u201cThe mother bakes the baby. She is the oven.\u201d His voice changes. \u201cYou must begin work. Because you were not here to take notes, I have already written my letter to the Royal Society. Make a copy, please.\u201d\n Willem. Willem. Willem . . .\n I sit at a table, draw toward me Father\u2019s letter on his own handmade paper with the writing in dark brown ink, and begin to copy it into the book.\n \u201cHer book of notes included copies of his letters!\u201d Jan said before I could even speak. \u201cThat has never been found!\u201d\n I said, \u201cWhat does \u2018zielen\u2019 mean?\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Souls.\u2019 Leeuwenhoek spoke of the soul?\u201d\n \u201cOnly to tell Maria it is a fairy story. And \u2018engelen\u2019 is \u2018angels\u2019? He said those, too, are a fairy story.\u201d\n Jan smiled. \u201cWhich is exactly what his neighbors, and even at first many of his English contemporaries, said about Leeuwenhoek\u2019s \u2018little animals.\u2019 What was on his lens?\u201d\n \u201cHis own semen.\u201d\n \u201c1677. Give me the dialogue to record.\u201d\n I did. Cora watched the visual translations of my brain waves eavesdropping on Maria\u2019s memories as I matched them with Maria\u2019s and her father\u2019s words. Cora said sourly, \u201cHe thought women were just baby ovens? What about our eggs?\u201d\n Jan said, \u201cMerely a storehouse of nutrients. Antonj thought eggs couldn\u2019t be alive because they did not move.\u201d\n She said, \u201cSexist bastard. Well, we\u2019ve got a good enough match between action and speech, although the images are still pretty blurry. I suppose you want to wait until after lunch for the next session. Not that an hour off is enough time for you to get any sharper.\u201d\n I said, \u201cThe images aren\u2019t blurry because of me. They\u2019re blurry because half of Maria\u2019s mind is still filled with Willem.\u201d\n \u201cAfter three years? Then let\u2019s hope she forgets him soon.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t.\n In my afternoon session, I finally saw what I should have already realized: Maria\u2019s depression. It leaves a signature in the mind, a sort of unseen miasma, until now masked by the insistent, overwhelming, constant longing for Willem.\n Added to her longing and depression was a new emotion: fear. Leeuwenhoek was ill. He lay in bed, weak and nauseated, while Maria held cups of ale to his lips and poor Jozefien emptied and cleaned pan after pan of watery diarrhea. Maria was patient despite her fear, Leeuwenhoek was irritable, and I was glad that memories experienced in Meijer entanglements did not include the sense of smell.\n \u201cEww,\u201d Cora said when the session ended.\n Jan said, \u201cIn 1680 Leeuwenhoek had a bout of giardia, a waterborne disease. Obviously, he survived. But it\u2019s interesting that Maria knew both to keep him hydrated and to give him ale instead of more water.\u201d\n \u201cDid Maria get it, too?\u201d\n \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t say.\u201d\n Of course not.\n We recorded what I remembered of the dialogue, none of which showed Leeuwenhoek in a flattering light. Querulous, demanding, he assumed that Maria\u2019s life existed to serve his.\n \u201cOh, yes,\u201d Jan said.\n \u201cHer fault,\u201d Cora said. \u201cShe should have just left.\u201d\n My anger startled me with its intensity. \u201cJust left\u201d\u2014and gone where? With what money? Yes, Cora was an engineer, not a historian, but still\u2014\n I said tightly, \u201cSometimes circumstances keep a person from walking away.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t reply. I didn\u2019t think she even heard me.\n I lay on the cot the rest of the afternoon, gathering strength. Jan brought me takeaway for dinner. In the evening session, a pale but recovering Leeuwenhoek examined bits of his own feces, while Maria wrote down his observations in \u201cthe book\u201d and Pieter took his turn on the microscope to draw what Leeuwenhoek\u2019s magnification revealed.\n Afterward, Cora surprised me by actually asking an historical question. \u201cJan, did he see whatever caused his giardia\u2014what is it, a bacteria, virus, what?\u201d\n \u201cParasite. Yes, he described it in a 1680 letter to the Royal Society and included accurate drawings.\u201d\n \u201cSo he was the first to say germs caused disease?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Jan said. \u201cLeeuwenhoek has been criticized for never pointing out that connection.\u201d\n \u201cBut he knew. He must have.\u201d\n \u201cProbably.\u201d\n \u201cThen why didn\u2019t he\u2014\u201d\n I said, \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t want the Royal Society to see his precious \u2018little animals\u2019 in a negative light. He cared more about them than about people. Including his daughter.\u201d\n \u201cWhat a bastard,\u201d Cora said dismissively, as if a single pejorative could sum up a person. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell us that he wouldn\u2019t take any students and wouldn\u2019t even show people his best microscopes?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Jan said.\n I felt weak enough to let him take me home. As his drivie calibrated the traffic and moved easily though it, I sat slumped against the back of my seat, eyes closed. There would be no call to Layla\u2019s doctor tonight. By tomorrow night, I would be home in California, in the partially emptied house where Layla and my father had lived, facing the task of working with Cora from 9,000 miles away to ready our joint findings for publication.\n Neither Jan nor I spoke until we reached my building. Then he said, \u201cMaria also loved her father, you know, and was proud of him. It was a . . . a complicated relationship.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d\n 4.\n In the next morning\u2019s session, Leeuwenhoek discovered microbes in water drawn from a local pond, the first person in the world to see bacteria. The memory meant enough to Maria for me to access it, although not because of the bacteria. I felt her astonishment at Leeuwenhoek\u2019s joy, and then her sharing of it. Her pleasure lasted only one long moment before the image of Willem again turned everything else blurry, but that moment was real, and it yielded some sharp images that pleased Cora.\n \u201c1686,\u201d Jan said, and I did arithmetic in my head. Maria had been mourning her dead soldier for somewhere between twelve and fourteen years, without any lessening of longing for him. Was that love or pathological obsession? I didn\u2019t know.\n I did know that she had been to church that morning, and had left halfway through the service, finding no comfort there. Did she no longer believe she would see Willem someday in heaven? I didn\u2019t know that, either. Maria\u2019s memories revealed her experiences and emotions, but her thoughts only as they occurred in the moment, and I had not been with her in Nieuwe Kerk. I couldn\u2019t tell how her religious beliefs had evolved.\n And then, in my last session in Delft, suddenly I could.\n \u201cMistress Maria! More paper from heaven!\u201d\n The neighbor girl holds out her palm. On it lies a blackened, brittle scrap of paper. The child\u2019s small face shines with excitement. \u201cThey fall beside Visser\u2019s Pond. I saw it! Messages from angels!\u201d\n \u201cI may see?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t touch, it will break. This one fell right to me!\u201d\n I stare at the charred paper\u2014blackened by its long fall from the skies? Old, faded memories of other people telling me about these messages, but not near Delft. The child runs off to show her treasure to someone else, and I snatch my shawl from its peg and start for Visser\u2019s Pond, outside the city walls.\n The ground is low here, marshy when wet, but dry now under a hot sun. The water of Visser\u2019s Pond lies low, choked with algae and weeds. Here is where Father obtained his animalcules for study. Insects hum in the wildflowers. I spread my shawl on the ground and sit on it, turning my face to the breeze ruffling the pond water. I wait.\n It is a long wait.\n But eventually, I see the paper drift down from the sky. It lands on my shawl, almost in my lap. Charred, lusterless\u2014I cannot read anything written on it. But I don\u2019t need to. Happiness rises in me like a fresh spring from dry earth, and I laugh out loud.\n This message came right to me. It is from Willem, it must be. So Heaven is real, souls are real, and instead of punishing me for doubting that, God in His infinite mercy has allowed Willem to send me this precious token of faith, and of love.\n I laugh aloud\u2014how long since I have laughed? Then I cry, careful to not let my tears land on the fragile paper. I sit there and feel Willem\u2019s love soak into me like sunshine.\n I am loved.\n When I finally lift the paper and hold it carefully on my palm, as the little girl did, the sun is low above the city. When I reach home, the smell of cooking comes from the kitchen and Jozefien has already lit candles in my father\u2019s workroom. He glowers at me.\n \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n \u201cLook, Father. Please look. It fell from the sky near Visser\u2019s Pond.\u201d I hold out the paper.\n \u201cYes, yes, I know,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a specimen already\u2014you didn\u2019t need to get me one.\u201d\n He says a lot more\u2014\n \u2014my Dutch wasn\u2019t good enough to follow\u2014\n \u2014before he looks through one of his small microscopes, adjusts the distance of the pin from the lens. He hands me the microscope, and I look.\n All joy leaves me. I am empty, a shell. I crumple my message from Heaven and it falls in black gritty rain to the floor.\n I pulled the wires off my scalp, not waiting for Cora, who cried, \u201cHey!\u201d Jan stared at the screen until it went blank. Then he looked at me.\n I could not force words through the tightness in my throat.\n Jan supplied the words. \u201cIn the seventeenth century, it was believed that occasional scraps of paper fell from Heaven, and they really did look like paper in composition and thickness. Leeuwenhoek examined one in 1687 and realized they were small sheets of dried algae, stiffened and burned by the sun, and light enough to be lifted and blown about by wind. He reconstituted some of the \u2018paper\u2019 with water and found algae. Then he reversed the process to make \u2018messages\u2019 by drying fresh algae. That\u2019s what he showed Maria, isn\u2019t it. Could you understand his explanation, Elena?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said. All I could understand was her heartbreak. The worst kind: unexpected hope, suddenly shattered.\n Layla and I had thought my father was getting better.\n Cora said, \u201cSo no dialogue at all? Nothing?\u201d\n \u201cNone,\u201d I lied. I did not have the strength to recite the conversation with the child, and anyway, Jan had already explained everything.\n Cora said sulkily, \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t have any dialogue for this session, how about doing just one more tonight, you told me your plane doesn\u2019t leave until almost midnight and so if you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cCora,\u201d Jan said sharply, \u201cno. Can\u2019t you see how weak she is?\u201d\n \u201cAnd just who, Jan de Knuyt, appointed you research leader here? The last time I looked, you\u2019re only attached to the project as long as Elena and I\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHave you no sense of fairness toward Elena? She\u2014\u201d\n \u201cStop,\u201d I said, raising my voice as much as I could. \u201cI will do one more session tonight.\u201d\n I had decided what I was going to do. About everything.\n Cora, sweet now that I was doing what she wanted, brought me sandwiches, cookies, coffee, and left it by the cot. I told her and Jan to not come back for three hours; I needed to sleep. I actually did sleep for an hour, setting my wrister to wake me.\n I called the airline and rebooked my flight for tomorrow evening, hoping I would be able to fly by then.\n There are many kinds of depression. Dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder, often but not always runs in families. Science has just begun to discover the genetic causes. Dysthymia ranges from mild but chronic all the way to suicidal. It can, like Layla\u2019s, vary in intensity with different occurrences.\n Situational depression, on the other hand, is caused by a specific situation. Often it can be eased by changes in the depressed person\u2019s situation, by loving attention, or by just by the oldest of all cures, time.\n Time was not helping Maria van Leeuwenhoek. She took pride in being useful to her famous father, but feeling proud is not the same as feeling loved.\n Carefully, I hooked my brain to Cora\u2019s machinery, turned it on, and lay on the cot.\n Carrying a small bouquet of wildflowers, I walk across Market Square, past Nieuwe Kerk. The bell tower chimes, but I don\u2019t look up. Skirting the church, I enter the graveyard. Willem is not, of course, buried here; I will never know on what battlefield he died or who claimed his body, if anyone. I walk to my mother\u2019s gravestone.\n I don\u2019t really miss her; it has been so long, and I was only a child when she died. But this is a quiet place, where sorrow is not remarked on.\n Willem, Willem, Willem . . .\n Two more people stood in the graveyard, mourning their own dead. Maria hadn\u2019t even noticed them. I waited until they left.\n If Willem had lived . . . if there had been no war . . . if the church were not just as Father said: domheid, waanvoorstellingen . . . Father is always right . . .\n What I was about to do was both forbidden and dangerous. Dangerous because in the earliest days of Meijer entanglements, three receivers had tried it. Two were fine afterward, if completely exhausted.\n I lay the flowers on my mother\u2019s grave. When I straighten, Willem is standing before me. The world rocks on its foundation.\n For decades, science has known that the material brain operates at a quantum level. For over a century, science has known that quantum equations run independent of time. Backward, forward, it makes no difference. Since biblical times, people who knew almost nothing of science have known about brains that produce delusions their beholders believe are real. The delusions, the waanvoorstellingen, are usually produced by disease, an abnormal situation in the brain.\n I am an abnormal situation in Maria\u2019s brain.\n Reversing\u2014transferring her memories to my brain, transferring my images to her brain\u2014it is not as difficult as it should be. Not if the created image is strong and both people are suggestible. It is forbidden because the past is supposed to be sacrosanct: Look, but don\u2019t touch. Even the past in memory.\n \u201cWillem?\u201d I say.\n \u201cI love you,\u201d Willem says to me. His body wavers, shimmers; he is a ghost, an angel. I know this. It doesn\u2019t matter. He is here. He has come to me.\n I take a step toward him, and he moves back.\n \u201cNo, Maria,\u201d he says. And then, as if it takes every bit of will, he chokes out, \u201cI wait for you.\u201d And vanishes.\n I fall to my knees, sobbing in terror and joy.\n I could take no more. My heart hammered, my breath came so labored that I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t come at all. I couldn\u2019t get off the cot to turn off the equipment. I couldn\u2019t even reach up to yank free my connecting wires. The third receiver of those who tried this had survived, but he was never the same again. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I\u2014\n Then the wires came free and there were arms around me, holding me tight. Jan said, \u201cThat was stupidity!\u201d\n \u201cDomheid,\u201d I whispered, but he didn\u2019t hear me.\n \u201cWhat were you doing? Why . . . Godverdomme! Ben je helemaal besodemieterd! You were reversing.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t . . . help . . . Daddy . . . or Layla,\u201d I whispered, and everything went black.\n 5.\n Jan drove me to the airport. I felt unsteady with the shakiness and brain fog of too little sleep, even though I had just slept for fourteen hours. Last night Jan carried me home, stayed with me, made me eat when I woke. At the lab he deleted the recording of what I had done. No one else will know. My career is safe.\n Ben je helemaal besodemieterd! he had said to me: are you out of your mind?\n Yes. Literally.\n \u201cJan,\u201d I said just before I entered security, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I never had dinner with you. That I refused so nastily. That was rude and unfair. If I return to Europe, or if you ever come to California . . . \u201d\n \u201cMay I phone you? I mean, not just about the project?\u201d\n \u201cYes. Please. I\u2019d like that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat will you do now, Elena?\u201d\n \u201cFinish dealing with my father\u2019s estate. Take care of Layla. Work on the entanglement paper long-distance with Cora. Incidentally, she\u2019s after you.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d He actually blushed, hesitated, then said with awkward daring, \u201cBut it is not Cora that I am interested in.\u201d\n I kissed him goodbye, and an unexpected sweetness rippled through me.\n Even though I would never know if it had made any difference, I didn\u2019t regret the comfort I had tried to bring to Maria. I had not deserved Jan\u2019s interest and kindness. The one researcher who\u2019d failed at reversed contact did not deserve psychosis. Layla did not deserve to inherit our father\u2019s dysthymia. Maria van Leeuwenhoek, faithful and devoted to her father, did not deserve either his self-absorbed neglect or Willem\u2019s death in war. Life was not fair.\n Which is why human beings should try to be. We are not only little animals.\n Jan let go of me, and I walked toward the plane that would take me home.\n Nancy Kress is the author of thirty-five books, including twenty-seven novels, four collections of short stories, and three books on writing.

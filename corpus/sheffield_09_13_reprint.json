A splendid idea, and one that I agree with totally in principle. Bang! One bullet, and trouble bites the dust. But unfortunately, trouble doesn\u2019t know the rules. Trouble won\u2019t stay dead.\nI looked around the table. My top troubleshooting team was here. I was here. Unfortunately, they were supposed to be headed for Jupiter, and I ought to be down on Earth. In less than twenty-four hours, the draft pick would begin. That wouldn\u2019t wait, and if I didn\u2019t leave in the next thirty minutes, I would never make it in time. I needed to be in two places at once. I cursed the copyright laws and the single-copy restriction, and went to work.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve read the new requirement,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know the parameters. Ideas, anyone?\u201d\nA dead silence. They were facing the problem in their own unique ways. Wolfgang Pauli looked half-asleep, Thomas Edison was drawing little doll-figures on the table\u2019s surface, Enrico Fermi seemed to be counting on his fingers, and John von Neumann was staring impatiently at the other three. I was doing none of those things. I knew very well that wherever the solution would come from, it would not be from inside my head. My job was much more straightforward: I had to see that when we had a possible answer, it happened. And I had to see that we got one answer, not four.\nThe silence in the room went on and on. My brain trust was saying nothing, while I watched the digits on my watch flicker by. I had to stay and find a solution; and I had to get to the draft picks. But most of all and hardest of all, I had to remain quiet, to let my team do some thinking.\nIt was small consolation to know that similar meetings were being held within the offices of the other three combines. Everyone must be finding it equally hard going. I knew the players, and I could imagine the scenes, even though all the troubleshooting teams were different. NETSCO had a group that was intellectually the equal of ours at Romberg AG: Niels Bohr, Theodore von Karman, Norbert Weiner, and Marie Curie. MMG, the great Euro-Mexican combine of Magrit-Marcus Gesellschaft, had focused on engineering power rather than pure scientific understanding and creativity, and, in addition to the Soviet rocket designer Sergey Korolev and the American Nikola Tesla, they had reached farther back (and with more risk) to the great nineteenth-century English engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He had been one of the outstanding successes of the program; I wished he were working with me, but MMG had always refused to look at a trade. MMG\u2019s one bow to theory was a strange one, the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, but the unlikely quartet made one hell of a team.\nAnd finally there was BP Megation, whom I thought of as confused. At any rate, I didn\u2019t understand their selection logic. They had used billions of dollars to acquire a strangely mixed team: Erwin Schrodinger, David Hilbert, Leo Szilard, and Henry Ford. They were all great talents, and all famous names in their fields, but I wondered how well they could work as a unit.\nAll the troubleshooting teams were now pondering the same emergency. Our problem was created when the Pan-National Union suddenly announced a change to the Phase B demonstration program. They wanted to modify impact conditions, as their contracts with us permitted them to do. They didn\u2019t have to tell us how to do it, either, which was just as well for them, since I was sure they didn\u2019t know. How do you take a billion tons of mass, already launched to reach a specific target at a certain point of time, and redirect it to a different end point with a different arrival time?\nThere was no point in asking them why they wanted to change rendezvous conditions. It was their option. Some of our management saw the action on PNU\u2019s part as simple bloody-mindedness, but I couldn\u2019t agree. The four multinational combines had each been given contracts to perform the biggest space engineering exercise in human history: small asteroids (only a kilometer or so across\u2014but massing a billion tons each) had to be picked up from their natural orbits and redirected to the Jovian system, where they were to make precise rendezvous with assigned locations of the moon Io. Each combine had to select the asteroid and the method of moving it, but deliver within a tight transfer-energy budget and a tight time schedule.\nFor that task the PNU would pay each group a total of $8 billion. That sounds like a fair amount of money, but I knew our accounting figures. To date, with the project still not finished (rendezvous would be in eight more days), Romberg AG had spent $14.5 billion. We are looking at a probable cost overrun by a factor of two. I was willing to bet that the other three groups were eating very similar losses. Why?\nBecause this was only Phase B of a four-phase project. Phase A had been a system design study, which led to four Phase B awards for a demonstration project. The Phase B effort that the four combines were working on now was a proof-of-capability run for the full European Metamorphosis. The real money came in the future, in Phases C and D. Those would be awarded by the PNU to a single combine, and the award would be based largely on Phase B performance. The next phases called for the delivery of fifty asteroids to impact points on Europa (Phase C), followed by thermal mixing operations on the moon\u2019s surface (Phase D). The contract value of C and D would be somewhere up around $800 billion. That was the fish that all the combines were after, and it was the reason we all overspend lavishly on this phase.\nBy the end of the whole program, Europa would have a forty-kilometer-deep water ocean over all its surface. And then the real fun would begin. Some contractor would begin the installation of the fusion plants, and the seeding of the sea-farms with the first prokaryotic bacterial forms.\nThe stakes were high; and to keep everybody on their toes, PNU did the right thing. They kept throwing in these little zingers, to mimic the thousand and one things that would go wrong in the final project phases.\nWhile I was sitting and fidgeting, my team had gradually come to life. Fermi was pacing up and down the room\u2014always a good sign; and Wolfgang Pauli was jabbing impatiently at the keys of a computer console. John von Neumann hadn\u2019t moved, but since he did everything in his head anyway, that didn\u2019t mean much.\nI looked again at my watch. I had to go. \u201cIdeas?\u201d I said again.\nVon Neumann made a swift chopping gesture of his hand. \u201cWe have to make a choice, Al. It can be done in four or five ways.\u201d\nThe others were nodding. \u201cThe problem is only one of efficiency and speed,\u201d added Fermi. \u201cI can give you an\norder-of-magnitude estimate of the effects on the overall program within half an hour.\u201d\n\u201cWithin fifteen minutes.\u201d Pauli raised the bidding.\n\u201cNo need to compete this one.\u201d They were going to settle down to a real four-way fight on methods\u2014they always did\u2014but I didn\u2019t have the time to sit here and referee. The important point was that they said it could be done. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to rush it. Whatever you decide, it will have to wait until I get back.\u201d I stood up. \u201cTom?\u201d\nEdison shrugged. \u201cHow long will you be gone, Al?\u201d\n\u201cTwo days, maximum. I\u2019ll head back right after the draft picks.\u201d (That wasn\u2019t quite true; when the draft picks were over, I had some other business to attend to that did not include the troubleshooters, but two days should cover everything.)\n\u201cHave fun.\u201d Edison waved his hand casually. \u201cBy the time you get back, I\u2019ll have the engineering drawings for you.\u201d\nOne thing about working with a team like mine\u2014they may not always be right, but they sure are always cocky.\n\u201cMake room there. Move over!\u201d The guards were pushing ahead to create a narrow corridor through the wedged mass of people. The one in front of me was butting with his helmeted head, not even looking to see whom he was shoving aside. \u201cMove!\u201d he shouted. \u201cCome on now, out of the way.\u201d\nWe were in a hurry. Things had been frantically busy Topside before I left, so I had cut it fine on connections to begin with, then been held up half an hour at reentry. We had broken the speed limits on the atmospheric segment, and there would be PNU fines for that, but still we hadn\u2019t managed to make up all the time. Now the first draft pick was only seconds away, and I was supposed to be taking part in it.\nA thin woman in a green coat clutched at my arm as we bogged down for a moment in the crush of people. Her face was gray and grim, and she had a placard hanging round her neck. \u201cYou could wait longer for the copyright!\u201d She had to shout to make herself heard. \u201cIt would cost you nothing\u2014and look at the misery you would prevent. What you\u2019re doing is immoral! TEN MORE YEARS.\u201d\nHer last words were a scream as she called out this year\u2019s slogan. TEN MORE YEARS! I shook my arm free as the guard in front of me made sudden headway, and dashed along in his wake. I had nothing to say to the woman; nothing that she would listen to. If it were immoral, what did ten more years have to do with it? Ten more years; if by some miracle they were granted ten more years on the copyrights, what then? I knew the answer. They would try to talk the Pan-National Union into fifteen more years, or perhaps twenty. When you pay somebody off, it only increases their demands. I know, only too well. They are never satisfied with what they get.\nJoe Delacorte and I scurried into the main chamber and shuffled sideways to our seats at the last possible moment. All the preliminary nonsense was finished, and the real business was beginning. The tension in the room was terrific. To be honest, a lot of it was being generated by the media. They were all poised to make maximum noise as they shot the selection information all over the System. If it were not for the media, I don\u2019t think the PNU would hold live draft picks at all. We\u2019d all hook in with video links and do our business the civilized way.\nThe excitement now was bogus for other reasons, too. The professionals\u2014I and a few others\u2014would not become interested until the ten rounds were complete. Before that, the choices were just too limited. Only when they were all made, and the video teams were gone, would the four groups get together off-camera and begin the horse trading. \u201cMy ninth round plus my fifth for your second.\u201d \u201cMaybe, if you\u2019ll throw in $10 million and a tenth-round draft pick for next year . . . .\nMeanwhile, BP Megation had taken the microphone. \u201cFirst selection,\u201d said their representative. \u201cRobert Oppenheimer.\u201d\nI looked at Joe, and he shrugged. No surprise. Oppenheimer was the perfect choice\u2014a brilliant scientist, but also\npractical, and willing to work with other people. He had died in 1967, so his original copyright had expired within the past twelve months. I knew his family had appealed for a copyright extension and been refused. Now BP Megation had sole single-copy rights for another lifetime.\n\u201cTrade?\u201d whispered Joe.\nI shook my head. We would have to beggar ourselves for next year\u2019s draft picks to make BP give up Oppenheimer. Other combine reps had apparently made the same decision. There was the clicking of data entry as the people around me updated portable databases. I did the same thing with a stub of pencil and a folded sheet of yellow paper, putting a check mark alongside his name. Oppenheimer was taken care of, I could forget that one. If by some miracle one of the four teams had overlooked some other top choice, I had to be ready to make an instant revision to my own selections.\n\u201cFirst selection, by NETSCO,\u201d said another voice. \u201cPeter Joseph William Debye.\u201d\nIt was another natural choice. Debye had been a Nobel prizewinner in physics, a theoretician with an excellent grasp of applied technology. He had died in 1966. Nobel laureates in science, particularly ones with that practical streak, went fast. As soon as their copyrights expired, they would be picked up in the draft the same year.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it always works out well. The most famous case, of course, was Albert Einstein. When his copyright had expired in 2030, BP Megation had had first choice in the draft pick. They had their doubts, and they must have sweated blood over their decision. The rumor mill said they spent over $70 million in simulations alone, before they decided to take him as their top choice. The same rumor mill said that the cloned form was now showing amazing ability in chess and music, but no interest at all in physics or mathematics. If that was true, BP Megation had dropped $2 billion down a black hole: $1 billion straight to the PNU for acquisition of copyright, and another $1 billion for the clone process. Theorists were always tricky; you could never tell how they would turn out.\nMagrit-Marcus Gesellschaft had now made their first draft pick, and chosen another Nobel laureate, John Cockroft. He also had died in 1967. So far, every selection was completely predictable. The three combines were picking the famous scientists and engineers who had died in 1966 and 1967, and who were now, with the expiration of family retention of copyrights, available for cloning for the first time.\nThe combines were being logical, but it made for a very dull draft pick. Maybe it was time to change that. I stood up to announce our first take.\n\u201cFirst selection, by Romberg AG,\u201d I said. \u201cCharles Proteus Steinmetz.\u201d\nMy announcement caused a stir in the media. They had presumably never heard of Steinmetz, which was a disgraceful statement of their own ignorance. Even if they hadn\u2019t spent most of the past year combing old files and records, as we had, they should have heard of him. He was one of the past century\u2019s most colorful and creative scientists, a man who had been physically handicapped (he was a hunchback), but mentally able to do the equivalent of a hundred one-hand push-ups without even breathing hard. Even I had heard of him, and you\u2019d not find many of my colleagues who\u2019d suggest I was interested in science.\nThe buzzing in the media told me they were consulting their own historical data files, digging farther back in time. Even when they had done all that, they would still not understand the first thing about the true process of clone selection. It\u2019s not just a question of knowing who died over seventy-five years ago, and will therefore be out of copyright. That\u2019s a trivial exercise, one that any yearbook will solve for you. You also have to evaluate other factors. Do you know where the body is\u2014are you absolutely sure? Remember, you can\u2019t clone anyone with a cell or two from the original body. You also have to be certain that it\u2019s who you think it is. All bodies seventy-five years old tend to look the same. And then, if the body happens to be really old\u2014say, more than a couple of centuries\u2014there are other peculiar problems that are still not understood at all. When\nNETSCO pulled its coup a few years ago by cloning Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the other three combines were envious at first. Leibniz was a real universal genius, a seventeenth-century superbrain who was good at everything. NETSCO had developed a better cell-growth technique, and they had also succeeded in locating the body of Leibniz in its undistinguished Hanover grave.\nThey walked tall for almost a year at NETSCO, until the clone came out of the forcing chambers for indoctrination. He looked nothing like the old portraits of Leibniz, and he could not grasp even the simplest abstract concepts. Oops! said the media. Wrong body.\nBut it wasn\u2019t as simple as that. The next year, MMG duplicated the NETSCO cell-growth technology and tried for Isaac Newton. In this case there was no doubt that they had the correct body, because it had lain undisturbed since 1727 beneath a prominent plaque in London\u2019s Westminster Abbey. The results were just as disappointing as they had been for Leibniz.\nNow NETSCO and MMG have become very conservative, in my opinion, far too conservative. But since then, nobody has tried for a clone of anyone who died before 1850. The draft picking went on its thoughtful and generally cautious way, and was over in a couple of hours except for the delayed deals.\nThe same group of protesters were picketing the building when I left. I tried to walk quietly through them, but they must have seen my picture on one of the exterior screens showing the draft-pick process. I was buttonholed by a man in a red jumpsuit and the same thin woman in green, still carrying her placard.\n\u201cCould we speak with you for just one moment?\u201d The man in red was very well-spoken and polite.\nI hesitated, aware that news cameras were on us. \u201cVery briefly. I\u2019m trying to run a proof-of-concept project, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Is it going well?\u201d He was a different type from most of the demonstrators, cool and apparently intelligent. And therefore potentially more dangerous.\n\u201cI wish I could say yes,\u201d I said. \u201cActually, it\u2019s going rather badly. That\u2019s why I\u2019m keen to get back out.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. All I wanted to ask you was why you\u2014and I don\u2019t mean you, personally; I mean the combines\u2014why do you find it necessary to use clones? You could do your work without them, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nI hesitated. \u201cLet me put it this way. We could do the work without them, in just the same way as we could stumble along somehow if we were denied the use of computer power, or nuclear power. The projects would be possible, but they would be enormously more difficult. The clones augment our available brainpower, at the highest levels. So let me ask you: Why should we do without the clones, when they are available and useful?\u201d\n\u201cBecause of the families. You have no right to subject the families to the misery and upset of seeing their loved ones cloned, without their having any rights in the matter. It\u2019s cruel, and unnecessary. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. Now, you listen to me for a minute.\u201d The cameras were still on me. It was a chance to say something that could never be said often enough. \u201cThe family holds copyright for seventy-five years after a person\u2019s death. So if you, personally, remember your grandparent, you have to be pushing eighty years old\u2014and it\u2019s obvious from looking at you that you\u2019re under forty. So ask yourself, Why are all you petitioners people who are in their thirties? It\u2019s not you who\u2019s feeling any misery.\u201d\n\u201cBut there are relatives\u2014,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh yes, the relatives. Are you a relative of somebody who has been cloned?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet. But if this sort of thing goes on\n\u201cListen to me for one more minute. A long time ago, there were a lot of people around who thought that it was wrong to let books with sex in them be sold to the general public. They petitioned to have the books banned. It wasn\u2019t that they claimed to be buying the books themselves, and finding them disgusting; because if they said that was the case, then people would have asked them why they were buying what they didn\u2019t like. Nobody was forcing anybody to buy those\nbooks. No, what the petitioners wanted was for other people to be stopped from buying what the petitioners didn\u2019t like. And you copyright-extension people are just the same. You are making a case on behalf of the relatives of the ones who are being cloned. But you never seem to ask yourself this: If cloning is so bad, why aren\u2019t the descendants of the clones the ones doing the complaining? They\u2019re not, you know. You never see them around here.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cCloning is immoral!\u201d\nI sighed. Why bother? Not one word of what I\u2019d said had got through to him. It didn\u2019t much matter\u2014I\u2019d really been speaking for the media anyway\u2014but it was a shame to see bigotry masquerading as public-spirited behavior. I\u2019d seen enough of that already in my life.\nI started to move off toward my waiting aircar. The lady in green clutched my arm again. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave instructions in my will that I want to be cremated. You\u2019ll never get me!\u201d\nYou have my word on that, lady. But I didn\u2019t say it. I headed for the car, feeling an increasing urge to get back to the clean and rational regions of space. There was one good argument against cloning, and only one. It increased the total number of people, and to me that number already felt far too large.\nI had been gone only thirty hours, total; but when I arrived back at Headquarters, I learned that in my absence five new problems had occurred. I scanned the written summary that Pauli had left behind.\nFirst, one of the thirty-two booster engines set deep in the surface of the asteroid did not respond to telemetry requests for a status report. We had to assume it was defective, and eliminate it from the final firing pattern. Second, a big solar flare was on the way. There was nothing we could do about that, but it did mean we would have to recompute the strength of the magnetic and electric fields close to Io. They would change with the strength of the Jovian magnetosphere, and that was important because the troubleshooting team in my absence had agreed on their preferred solution to the problem of adjusting impact point and arrival time. It called for strong coupling between the asteroid and the 5-million-amp flux tube of current between Io and its parent planet, Jupiter, to modify the final collision trajectory.\nThird, we had lost the image data stream from one of our observing satellites, in synchronous orbit with Io. Fourth, our billion-ton asteroid had been struck by a larger-than-usual micrometeorite. This one must have massed a couple of kilograms, and it had been moving fast. It had struck off-axis from the center of mass, and the whole asteroid was now showing a tendency to rotate slowly away from our preferred orientation. Fifth, and finally, a new volcano had become very active down on the surface of Io. It was spouting sulfur up for a couple of hundred kilometers, and obscuring the view of the final-impact landmark.\nAfter I had read Pauli\u2019s terse analysis of all the problems\u2014nobody I ever met or heard of could summarize as clearly and briefly as he did\u2014I switched on my communications set and asked him the only question that mattered: \u201cCan you handle them all?\u201d\nThere was a delay of almost two minutes. The troubleshooters were heading out to join the rest of our project team for their on-the-spot analyses in the Jovian system; already the light-travel time was significant. If I didn\u2019t follow in the next day or two, radio-signal delay would make conversation impossible. At the moment, Jupiter was forty-five light-minutes from Earth.\n\u201cWe can, Al,\u201d said Pauli\u2019s image at last. \u201cUnless others come up in the next few hours, we can. From here until impact, we\u2019ll be working in an environment with increasing uncertainties.\u201d\n\u201cThe PNU people planned it that way. Go ahead\u2014but send me full transcripts.\u201d I left the system switched on, and went off to the next room to study the notes I had taken of the five problem areas. As I had done with every glitch that had come up since the Phase B demonstration project began, I placed the problem into one of two basic categories: act of nature, or failure of man-made element. For the most recent five difficulties, the volcano on Io and the solar flare belonged\nto the left-hand column: Category One, clearly natural and unpredictable events. The absence of booster-engine telemetry and the loss of satellite-image data were Category Two, failures of our system. They went in the right-hand column. I hesitated for a long time over the fifth event, the impact of the meteorite; finally, and with some misgivings, I assigned it also as a Category One event.\nAs soon as possible, I would like to follow the engineering teams out toward Jupiter for the final hours of the demonstration. However, I had two more duties to perform before I could leave. Using a coded link to Romberg AG HQ in synchronous Earth orbit, I queried the status of all the clone tanks. No anomalies were reported. By the time we returned from the final stages of Phase B, another three finished clones would be ready to move to the indoctrination facility. I needed to be there when it happened.\nNext. I had to review and approve acquisition of single-use copyright for all the draft picks we had negotiated down on Earth. To give an idea of the importance of these choices, we were looking at an expenditure of $20 billion for those selections over the next twelve months. It raised the unavoidable question, Had we made the best choices?\nAt this stage of the game, every combine began to have second thoughts about the wisdom of their picks. All the old failures came crowding into your mind. I already mentioned NETSCO and their problem with Einstein, but we had had our full share at Romberg AG: Gregor Mendel, the originator of the genetic ideas that stood behind all the cloning efforts, had proved useless; so had Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, our second pick for 1958. We had (by blind luck!) traded him along with $40 million for Wolfgang Pauli. Even so, we had made a bad error of judgment, and the fact that others made the same mistake was no consolation. As for Marconi, even though he looked like the old pictures of him, and was obviously highly intelligent, the clone who emerged turned out to be so indolent and casual about everything that he ruined any project he worked on. I had placed him in a cushy and undemanding position and allowed him to fiddle about with his own interests, which were mainly sports and good-looking women. (As Pauli acidly remarked, \u201cAnd you say that we\u2019re the smart ones, doing all the work?\u201d)\nIt\u2019s not the evaluation of a person\u2019s past record that\u2019s difficult, because we are talking about famous people who have done a great deal; written masses of books, articles, and papers; and been thoroughly evaluated by their own contemporaries. Even with all that, a big question still remains: Will the things that made the original man or woman great still be there in the cloned form? In other words, Just what is it that is inherited?\nThat\u2019s a very hard question to answer. The theory of evolution was proposed 170 years ago, but we\u2019re still fighting the old Nature-versus-Nurture battle. Is a human genius decided mainly by heredity, or by the way the person was raised? One old argument against cloning for genius was based on the importance of Nurture. It goes as follows: an individual is the product of both heredity (which is all you get in the clone) and environment. Since it is impossible to reproduce someone\u2019s environment, complete with parents, grandparents, friends, and teachers, you can\u2019t raise a clone that will be exactly like the original individual.\nI\u2019ll buy that logic. We can\u2019t make ourselves an intellectually exact copy of anyone.\nHowever, the argument was also used to prove that cloning for superior intellectual performance would be impossible. But of course, it actually proves nothing of the sort. If you take two peas from the same pod, and put one of them in deep soil next to a high wall, and the other in shallow soil out in the open, they must do different things if both are to thrive. The one next to the wall has to make sure it gets enough sunshine, which it can do by maximizing leaf area; the one in shallow soil has to get enough moisture, which it does through putting out more roots. The superior strain of peas is the one whose genetic composition allows it to adapt to whatever environment it is presented with.\nPeople are not peas, but in one respect they are not very different from them: some have superior genetic composition to others. That\u2019s all you can ask for. If you clone\nsomeone from a century ago, the last thing you want is someone who is identical to the original. They would be stuck in a twentieth-century mind-set. What is needed is someone who can adapt to and thrive in today\u2019s environment\u2014whether that is now the human equivalent of shade, or of shallow soil. The success of the original clone-template tells us a very important thing, that we are dealing with a superior physical brain. What that brain thinks is the year 2040 should be different from what it would have thought in the year 1940\u2014otherwise the clone would be quite useless. And the criteria for \u201cuseless\u201d change with time, too.\nAll these facts and a hundred others were running around inside my head as I reviewed the list for this year. Finally I made a note to suggest that J.B.S. Haldane, whom we had looked at and rejected three years ago on the grounds of unmanageability, ought to be looked at again and acquired if possible. History shows that he had wild views on politics and society, but there was no question at all about the quality of his mind. I thought I had learned a lot about interfacing with difficult scientific personalities in the past few years.\nWhen I was satisfied with my final list, I transmitted everything to Joe Delacorte, who was still down on Earth, and headed for the transition room. A personal shipment pod ought to be waiting for me there. I hoped I would get a good one. At the very least, I\u2019d be in it for the next eight days. Last time I went out to the Jovian system, the pod\u2019s internal lighting and external antenna failed after three days. Have you ever sat in the dark for seventy-two hours, a hundred million miles from the nearest human, unable to send or receive messages? I didn\u2019t know if anyone realized I was in trouble. All I could do was sit tight\u2014and I mean tight; pods are small\u2014and stare out at the stars.\nThis time the pod was in good working order. I was able to participate in every problem that hit the project over the next four days. There were plenty of them, all small, and all significant. One of the fuel-supply ships lost a main ion drive. The supply ship was not much more than a vast bag of volatiles and a small engine, and it had almost no brain at all in its computer, not even enough to figure out an optimal use of its drives. We had to chase after and corral it as though we were pursuing a great lumbering elephant. Then three members of the impact-monitoring team came down with food poisoning\u2014salmonella, which was almost certainly their own fault. You can say anything you like about throwing away spoiled food, but you can\u2019t get a sloppy crew to take much notice.\nThen, for variety, we lost a sensor through sheer bad program design. In turning one of our imaging systems from star sensing to Io-Jupiter sensing, we tracked it right across the solar disk and burned out all the photocells. According to the engineers, that\u2019s the sort of blunder you don\u2019t make after kindergarten\u2014but somebody did it.\nEngineering errors are easy to correct. It was much trickier when one of the final-approach-coordination groups, a team of two men and one woman, chose the day before the Io rendezvous to have a violent sexual argument. They were millions of kilometers away from anyone, so there was not much we could do except talk to them. We did that, hoped they wouldn\u2019t kill each other, and made plans to do without their inputs if we had to.\nFinally, one day before impact, an unplanned and anomalous firing of a rocket on the asteroid\u2019s forward surface caused a significant change of velocity of the whole body.\nI ought to explain that I did little or nothing to solve any of these problems. I was too slow, too ignorant, and not creative enough. While I was still struggling to comprehend what the problem parameters were, my troubleshooters were swarming all over it. They threw proposals and counterproposals at each other so fast that I could hardly note them, still less contribute to them. For example, in the case of the anomalous rocket firing that I mentioned, compensation for the unwanted thrust called for an elaborate balancing act of lateral and radial engines, rolling and nudging the asteroid back into its correct approach path. The team had mapped out the methods in minutes, written the necessary optimization programs in less than half an hour, and implemented their solution before I understood the geometry of what was going on.\nSo what did I do while all this was happening? I continued to make my two columns: act of nature, or failure of man-made element. The list was growing steadily, and I was spending a lot of time looking at it.\nWe were coming down to the final few hours now, and all the combines were working flat out to solve their own problems. In an engineering project of this size, many thousands of things could go wrong. We were working in extreme physical conditions, hundreds of millions of kilometers away from Earth and our standard test environments. In the intense charged-particle field near Io, cables broke at loads well below their rated capacities, hard-vacuum welds showed air-bleed effects, and lateral jets were fired and failed to produce the predicted attitude adjustments. And on top of all this, the pressure, isolation, and bizarre surroundings were too much for some of the workers. We had human failure to add to engineering failure. The test was tougher than anyone had realized\u2014even PNU, who was supposed to make the demonstration project just this side of impossible.\nI was watching the performance of the other three combines only a little less intently than I was watching our own. At five hours from contact time, NETSCO apparently suffered a communications loss with their asteroid-control system. Instead of heading for Io impact, the asteroid veered away, spiraling in toward the bulk of Jupiter itself.\nBP Megation lost it at impact minus three hours, when a vast explosion on one of their asteroid forward boosters threw the kilometer-long body into a rapid tumble. Within an hour, by some miracle of improvisation, their engineering team had found a method of stabilizing the wobbling mass. But by then it was too late to return to nominal impact time and place. Their asteroid skimmed into the surface of Io an hour early, sending up a long, tear-shaped mass of ejecta from the moon\u2019s turbulent surface.\nThat left just two of us, MMG and Romberg AG. We both had our hands full. The Jovian system is filled with electrical, magnetic, and gravitational energies bigger than anything in the Star System except the Sun itself. The two remaining combines were trying to steer their asteroid into a pinpoint landing through a great storm of interference that made every control command and every piece of incoming telemetry suspect. In the final hour I didn\u2019t even follow the exchanges between my troubleshooters. Oh, I could hear them easily enough. What I couldn\u2019t do was comprehend them, enough to know what was happening.\nPauli would toss a scrap of comment at von Neumann, and, while I was trying to understand that, von Neumann would have done an assessment, keyed in for a databank status report, gabbled a couple of questions to Fermi and an instruction to Edison, and at the same time be absorbing scribbled notes and diagrams from those two. I don\u2019t know if what they were doing was potentially intelligible to me or not; all I know is they were going about fifty times too fast for me to follow. And it didn\u2019t much matter what I understood\u2014they were getting the job done. I was still trying to divide all problems into my Category One-Category Two columns, but it got harder and harder.\nIn the final hour I didn\u2019t look or listen to what my own team was doing. We had one band of telemetry trained on the MMG project, and more and more that\u2019s where my attention was focused. I assumed they were having the same kind of communications trouble as we were\u2014that crackling discharge field around Io made everything difficult. But their team was handling it. They were swinging smoothly into impact.\nAnd then, with only ten minutes to go, the final small adjustment was made. It should have been a tiny nudge from the radial jets; enough to fine-tune the impact position for a few hundred meters, and no more. Instead, there was a joyous roar of a radial jet at full, uncontrolled thrust. The MMG asteroid did nothing unusual for a few seconds (a billion tons is a lot of inertia), then began to drift lazily sideways, away from its nominal trajectory.\nThe jet was still firing. And that should have been impossible, because the first thing that the MMG team would do was send a POWER-OFF signal to the engine.\nThe time for impact came when the MMG asteroid was still a clear fifty kilometers out of position, and accelerating away. I saw the final collision, and the payload scraped along the surface of Io in a long, jagged scar that looked nothing at all like the neat, punched hole that we were supposed to achieve.\nAnd we did achieve it, a few seconds later. Our asteroid came in exactly where and when it was supposed to, driving in exactly vertical to the surface. The plume of ejecta had hardly begun to rise from Io\u2019s red-and-yellow surface before von Neumann was pulling a bottle of bourbon from underneath the communications console.\nI didn\u2019t object\u2014I only wished I were there physically to share it, instead of being stuck in my own pod, short of rendezvous with our main ship. I looked at my final list, still somewhat incomplete. Was there a pattern to it? Ten minutes of analysis didn\u2019t show one. No one had tried anything\u2014this time. Someday, and it might be tomorrow, somebody on another combine would have a bright idea; and then it would be a whole new ball game.\nWhile I was still pondering my list, my control console began to buzz insistently. I switched it on expecting contact with my own troubleshooting team. Instead, I saw the despondent face of Brunel, MMG\u2019s own team leader\u2014the man above all others that I would have liked to work on my side.\nHe nodded at me when my picture appeared on the screen. He was smoking one of his powerful black cigars, stuck in the side of his mouth. The expression on his face was as impenetrable as ever. He never let his feelings show there. \u201cI assume you saw it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said around the cigar. \u201cWe\u2019re out of it. I just called to congratulate you\u2014again.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I saw it. Tough luck. At least you came second.\u201d\n\u201cWhich, as you know very well, is no better than coming last.\u201d He sighed and shook his head. \u201cWe still have no idea what happened. Looks like either a programming error, or a valve sticking open. We probably won\u2019t know for weeks. And I\u2019m not sure I care.\u201d\nI maintained a sympathetic silence.\n\u201cI sometimes think we should just give up, Al,\u201d he said. \u201cI can beat those other turkeys, but I can\u2019t compete with you. That\u2019s six in a row that you\u2019ve won. It\u2019s wearing me out. You\u2019ve no idea how much frustration there is in that.\u201d\nI had never known Brunel to reveal so much of his feelings before.\n\u201cI think I do understand your problems,\u201d I said.\nAnd I did. I knew exactly how he felt\u2014more than he would believe. To suffer through a whole, endless sequence of minor, niggling mishaps was heartbreaking. No single trouble was ever big enough for a trouble-shooting team to stop, isolate it, and be able to say, there\u2019s dirty work going on here. But their cumulative effect was another matter. One day it was a morass of shipments missing their correct flights, another time a couple of minus signs dropped into computer programs, or a key worker struck down from a few days by a random virus, permits misfiled, manifests mislaid, or licenses wrongly dated.\nI knew all those mishaps personally. I should, because I invented most of them. I think of it as the death of a thousand cuts. No one can endure all that and still hope to win a Phase B study.\n\u201cHow would you like to work on the Europan Meta-morph?\u201d I asked. \u201cI think you\u2019d love it.\u201d\nHe looked very thoughtful, and for the first time, I believe I could actually read his expression. \u201cLeave MMG, you mean?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know what I want anymore. Let me think about it. I\u2019d like to work with you, Al\u2014you\u2019re a genius.\u201d\nBrunel was wrong about that, of course. I\u2019m certainly no genius. All I can do is what I\u2019ve always done\u2014handle people, take care of unpleasant details (quietly!), and make sure things get done that need doing. And of course, do what I do best: make sure that some things that need doing don\u2019t get done.\nThere are geniuses in the world, real geniuses. Not me,\nthough. The man who decided to clone me, secretly\u2014there I\u2019d suggest you have a genius.\n\u201cSay, don\u2019t you remember, they called me AL . . . .\u201d\nOf course, I don\u2019t remember. That song was written in the 1930s, and I didn\u2019t die until 1947, but no clone remembers anything of the forefather life. The fact that we tend to be knowledgeable about our originals\u2019 period is an expression of interest in those individuals, not memories from them. I know the Chicago of the Depression years intimately, as well as I know today; but it is all learned knowledge. I have no actual recollection of events. I don\u2019t remember.\nSo even if you don\u2019t remember, call me Al anyway.

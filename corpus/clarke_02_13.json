Last month, my wife and I drove to the hospital and within a few hours the transition was complete. It\u2019s considered minor surgery when they implant a defibrillator, but anytime they snake a wire into your heart, there follows an over-abundance of caution. I am happy to say that the procedure went smoothly and I was back at home the next day. My recovery is moving along and I feel good.\nThe oddest thing so far? The defibrillator has a built-in speaker. Yes, music can play from my chest, though it isn\u2019t a good sign when it does.\nIn the interim, I\u2019ve had a lot more couch time. I took the opportunity to play catch up on a few projects:\n- The third annual volume of the Clarkesworld anthologies (titled Clarkesworld: Year Three) is now available in ebook, with a trade paperback coming by the end of the month.\n- The fourth and fifth volumes of the Clarkesworld anthologies are 95% complete.\n- Four more back issues are now available in print. (September 2011-December 2011)\n- Clarkesworld subscriptions are now available in Germany and France via Amazon. (in English)\nDuring my couch time, I've also been enjoying people\u2019s responses to our annual reader\u2019s survey, for which I am happy to announce the results:\nClarkesworld Reader\u2019s Survey \u2013 Best Story of 2012\n- \u201cImmersion\u201d by Aliette de Bodard\n- \u201cFade to White\u201d by Catherynne M. Valente\n- \u201cMantis Wives\u201d by Kij Johnson\nThe voting was close at the start, but in the end, \u201cImmersion\u201d by Aliette de Bodard won by a comfortable margin. Aliette also deserves congratulations on her BSFA Award nomination for this piece. Something tells me it won\u2019t be the last time we\u2019ll be mentioning \u201cImmersion\u201d and \u201caward nomination\u201d in the same sentence.\nClarkesworld Reader\u2019s Survey \u2013 Best Cover Art of 2012\nWINNER: \u201cNew World\u201d by Ken Barthelmey\n2nd Place: \u201cSci-Fi Farmer\u201d by Jessada Sutthi\n3rd Place: \u201cBreaking Through\u201d by Julie Dillon\nAs the voting in this category progressed, several artists traded out the top spot, but towards the end, \u201cNew World\u201d by Ken Barthelmey ran away with the top honor and never looked back.\nCongratulations to all of our winners!\nOne of the things that often came up in the survey comments was a desire to see us publish more fiction in each issue. As you know, I\u2019ve expressed a strong desire to be able to make Clarkesworld my full-time job. I believe that in order to make that goal a reality, it requires that we continue to expand our offerings as opportunities arise. Previously, we\u2019ve tied expansion to subscription levels and I think it is time to do that again.\nTo that end, I\u2019d like to announce the first of our 2013 milestone goals:\nIncrease the number of stories per issue to four, when we pick up five hundred new subscriptions.\nOur goals for the year don\u2019t end there, but I still have minor details to work out. Hopefully, I can tie up all the loose ends at Boskone later this month. Maybe I'll see some of you there.\nI\u2019d like to close with a bit of a public service announcement: If you can nominate for the Hugo Awards this year, you should know that the requirements for the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine have changed. While Clarkesworld is still eligible in this category (just as I\u2019m still eligible in Best Editor Short Form), some familiar names seen on past ballots are not.\nIn an attempt to help with the transition from the old rules to the new ones, I\u2019ve repurposed semiprozine.org as a place you can find information about the category and a growing list of magazines with their eligibility status. This unofficial resource is a good place to learn about some the many worthy contenders for this award. Check it out sometime and don\u2019t forget to nominate!\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form). His anthologies include Upgraded, Galactic Empires, More Human Than Human, Touchable Unreality, The Final Frontier, Not One of Us, The Eagle has Landed, and the Best Science Fiction of the Years series. His latest anthology, The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume 6, is now available from Night Shade Books. He currently lives in NJ with his wife and two sons."}

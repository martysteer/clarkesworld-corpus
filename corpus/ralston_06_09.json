Could it be she didn\u2019t want him to marry Sandra? He liked the thought.\n He pulled Julie inside. A man in a suit approached them at once, held out a hand with perfect, manicured nails.\n \u201cReal is the new real,\u201d Mr. Manicured said. \u201cPeople used to give chocolate hearts, candy hearts, paper hearts. Why not get to the heart of the matter, so to speak? Give your actual heart.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Julie said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind-of creepy.\u201d\n \u201cHow does it work?\u201d Coleman said.\n Julie wandered off to a display kiosk and pulled up a graphic demo of heart-replacement surgery.\n Coleman concentrated on Mr. Manicured, who was still speaking.\n \u201cOur surgeons are the best in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with cutting edge surgical techniques, so to speak, there is practically no scarring.\u201d\n A holo of a happy couple danced in the corner. Red slogans slid across the walls in laser light. Home is where the heart is, give her your heart. It all seemed very modern.\n Mr. Manicured took Coleman\u2019s elbow and leaned in conspiratorially. \u201cPersonally,\u201d he said, \u201cI would take an artificial heart over a real one any day. Much more reliable.\u201d\n He named a price.\n Coleman gasped.\n \u201cDo you love her?\u201d Manicured said.\n \u201cSure.\u201d It would take all his savings, the money he was saving for his bookstore.\n \u201cThere is no cost too great for love,\u201d Manicured murmured.\n Sandra said it was about time they get married. She sighed meaningfully whenever they passed the Give Your Heart store. He did want to make her happy.\n Coleman looked over at Julie, who stood with eyes narrowed at the kiosk. Julie, on the other hand, didn\u2019t believe in marriage.\n \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said.\n \u201cDo you, Coleman?\u201d the minister said.\n Coleman blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Sandra\u2019s shimmery veil made him dizzy. The heat wrapped his head like soggy towel. He could scarcely breathe.\n \u201cHere.\u201d\n Sandra\u2019s nephew, at Colman\u2019s side in his tiny tux, nudged a package into Colman\u2019s hands.\n \u201cDo you, Coleman, take Sandra as your wife?\u201d\n He knew he was supposed to say something about his heart. Still my beating heart. My heart is breaking? No, that couldn\u2019t be it. There were so many expressions about the heart, he thought in a sudden panic.\n Julie had said he shouldn\u2019t get married. Julie was somewhere in the audience.\n After a pause that felt to Colman as if it might stretch to eternity, Sandra reached over and took the package from Colman\u2019s hands. The minister began to speak again.\n Coleman felt a sudden thump from within his chest, as if his new artificial heart had done a somersault. The surgeon had assured him his new heart was in fine condition. Nothing could go wrong. So why had it thumped like that?\n He knew he was now supposed to do something with the ring, but at that point, he lost consciousness.\n No one would let him live down the fact that he had fainted; the reception was one long running joke about it. Coleman\u2019s heart, in its acrylic cage, made the rounds of the room.\n Colman drank three martinis and wobbled off to a corner where Sandra\u2019s brother Giles gobbled a piece of red heart-shaped cake.\n \u201cThe problem with weddings these days,\u201d Giles said, since he was an expert on everything, \u201cis that they are so staged and predictable.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean fainting wasn\u2019t exciting enough for you?\u201d\n Giles laughed. \u201cOkay. That was fun. But really, everything else. The dresses, the vows, the flowers, blah blah blah.\u201d\n And Julie was there, all of a sudden. She looked at Giles. \u201cThey were all exotics,\u201d she said. \u201cNot blah blah.\u201d\n Giles smiled and held out his hand. \u201cOne thing is for sure. I would never cut my heart out and give it to someone.\u201d\n \u201cGood,\u201d Julie said, taking Giles\u2019s hand. \u201cI would never ask anyone to. Have you seen Coleman\u2019s heart in the acrylic? It\u2019s quite gross.\u201d\n Giles smiled at Julie. Coleman didn\u2019t like it. Julie smiled at Giles. Coleman didn\u2019t like it one bit. The thought of all those expensive flowers weighed on Colman and sapped all the bravado he had recently acquired through the martinis. He kept thinking that he could have spent that money on a really nice collection of books.\n The thing in his chest thumped again, followed by a faint slithering sound.\n \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Coleman said.\n \u201cHear what?\u201d Julie said.\n Coleman took a breath. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said. It was the stress of the day. The thought of all his savings now gone, and everyone staring at him all the time. He rubbed his temples and wondered if there was somewhere he could lie down.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good,\u201d Giles said.\n \u201cI feel great,\u201d Colman said. \u201cBest day of my life.\u201d\n Giles shrugged.\n \u201cReally. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d He thought maybe it was the alcohol that made his voice waver.\n Julie put a hand on Colman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOf course you are, Colman. Congratulations.\u201d\n I give you my life, my love, my heart. That\u2019s what he had been supposed to say.\n \u201cThere! Did you see that?\u201d Coleman said.\n He stood with his shirt unbuttoned, holding open the flaps so Sandra could see.\n The skin of his chest bulged out faintly, like a fast-growing blister, and then just as quickly smoothed out again.\n \u201cSee what? Coleman, you aren\u2019t listening to me.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m listening to you.\u201d Maybe he was imagining it. Sandra didn\u2019t see it, after all. \u201cYou said you can\u2019t stand living in the city.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s killing me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe endless rain. This apartment is so crowded. All those stupid books.\u201d\n She lay on the couch with her arm draped over her eyes.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a house here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what about my bookstore?\u201d\n \u201cWhat bookstore?\u201d she said. \u201cWe could afford a house in the suburbs.\u201d\n Maybe it was just the idea of something alive in there that gave him chills. The sensation of something crawling around in his chest.\n \u201cI\u2019m miserable here,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you care about that?\u201d\n \u201cOf course I care,\u201d he said.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you love me?\u201d she said.\n \u201cOf course I love you.\u201d\n He loved his little apartment; the proximity to bookstores and cafes, the ceaseless pattern of traffic alternately stopping and then pulsing forward like blood through veins. He loved the sound of the rain. And he would be so far from Julie.\n \u201cWhen do you want to move?\u201d he said.\n She finally lifted her arm, smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll call an agent right now.\u201d\n The tip of the thing poked out his nose, made a small circular motion, and then began to lengthen, sliding smoothly out, long and thin and dexterous.\n Coleman wanted to scream but found he was completely frozen.\n \u201cColeman?\u201d Sandra\u2019s voice came from the kitchen. \u201cHave you seen my keys?\u201d\n The thin tentacle patted the dining room table, poked under a pile of newspapers. Coleman breathed shallowly through his mouth. He hoped he would faint. Or wake up. This couldn\u2019t be happening.\n The tentacle rooted under the newspapers, came out holding the ring of keys like an elephant trick at a circus. It rattled the keys in front of Coleman\u2019s face. He opened his hand, and the keys dropped into his palm. The tentacle slid smoothly back inside his nose.\n Sandra appeared in the doorway.\n \u201cThere they are!\u201d She scooped the keys from Coleman\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cEverything is so hard to find. We really need to unpack.\u201d\n The garage door slammed. Coleman still stood with his hand outstretched, unable to move.\n \u201cIt does appear to be moving around.\u201d The doctor withdrew the probe from the small hole he had made in Coleman\u2019s belly-button. The local anesthetic didn\u2019t completely cover the sensation of a cold metal slipping around inside him.\n \u201cIs this normal?\u201d Coleman asked.\n \u201cWell, I\u2019ve read about cases like this, although I haven\u2019t seen it personally. When you remove your real heart it leaves room for a different kind of creature to grow.\u201d\n \u201cA creature?\u201d\n \u201cWe can schedule you for surgery next week,\u201d he said.\n Coleman tried to take deep breaths to calm himself. \u201cDo you have any reading material on this phenomenon?\u201d\n \u201cSure. I\u2019ll send you home with some literature. You can think about how you want to proceed.\u201d\n Sandra found him on the doorstep, duffel in hand.\n \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she said.\n \u201cI hate this suburb,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the houses look identical. It never rains here.\u201d\n \u201cAre you leaving me?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m going to the hospital. And then I think I might go live in the city for a while.\u201d\n \u201cThe hospital?\u201d\n \u201cI have a thing growing inside me where my heart used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have it surgically removed.\u201d\n She gave him a blank look. He handed her the literature.\n \u201cThis is very strange,\u201d she said finally.\n \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWait a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says in here the creature can often be very helpful.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Coleman said.\n \u201cAnd it says the insurance won\u2019t cover it.\u201d\n \u201cSandra, I need to leave now to make my appointment.\u201d\n \u201cJust come inside for a moment and let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s to talk about?\u201d he said. His hand on the duffel was sweating. \u201cThere\u2019s a fucking creature inside of me!\u201d\n \u201cCalm down, Coleman.\u201d She glanced around to make sure no neighbors were out. \u201cReally now.\u201d She leaned in close. \u201cDid you see the cost of the surgery? We can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care what it costs.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re being selfish. Are you going to take all our savings and spend it on yourself?\u201d\n \u201cWell\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou aren\u2019t even thinking about how this might affect me. Remember what we agreed on about making our decisions together?\u201d\n He dropped the duffel. Sandra picked it up. \u201cCome inside,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work this out.\u201d\n The tentacle slid out of Coleman\u2019s ear and opened the door for Sandra.\n \u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to help.\u201d\n The creature was indeed very helpful. Tentacles protruded from Coleman\u2019s nose and mouth and pushed the vacuum cleaner around, did the dishes, found the remote. They picked up his old acrylic heart and put it on the mantel. They protruded out of his pants to unpack boxes, to pick up his piles of dusty old book and drop them in the recycle bin.\n One night Sandra asked Coleman to make love to her, and he watched with a mixture of arousal and horror as the tentacle protruded from the tip of his penis and caressed her, brought her to climax. She made noises he hadn\u2019t heard it quite a while. When it was done, he was still aroused, but he didn\u2019t want to touch her. And anyway, she was already asleep.\n The next morning he woke up to the smell of coffee and bacon. Sandra hung up the phone when he entered the kitchen, her eyes bright.\n \u201cGiles broke up with Julie.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAbout time. I never understood what he saw in her anyway.\u201d\n She draped an arm over his shoulders, whispered in his ear. \u201cBut we\u2019re so happy, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n \u201cHmmm,\u201d Coleman said. He opened the paper.\n A tentacle emerged from his ear and caressed her cheek. She giggled. He shuddered. Coleman tried not to think about the slithering sensation as he sipped his coffee.\n Coleman drank four martinis and then thought about making dinner for Sandra. When the tentacle emerged from his left nostril, weaving back and forth, trying to open the refrigerator door, he grasped it with both hands.\n He tugged. It resisted. He pulled and pulled and it stretched out long and thin. It hurt like nothing he had ever felt before as an amorphous sack squeezed out through his nose and plopped onto the kitchen table. It reformed into a translucent blob, pathetic and quivering. Coleman retched. He didn\u2019t feel drunk anymore.\n He reached for the phone.\n Julie picked up on the third ring.\n \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she said.\n \u201cI\u2019m an empty old man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not old,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n \u201cI love you.\u201d\n She was silent a moment. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over?\u201d\n He grabbed his acrylic heart from the mantel and hauled his caved-in body to the car. He managed it somehow, using his own hands and feet on the wheel and pedals, surprised that he still knew how, that he had the strength.\n He tried to imagine what would Sandra do when she got home and found the creature quivering on the kitchen table. Maybe she would let it go free. Maybe she would lay down her head and mourn its death. He decided he didn\u2019t care.\n Julie met him outside her apartment, squinting through the rain at him.\n The rain dripped down his nose, under his collar.\n \u201cLook at me,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left but a hollow body. I don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d\n She put a hand on his arm. \u201cWhat about your bookstore?\u201d she said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s an unrealistic dream,\u201d he said.\n \u201cIs that what Sandra told you?\u201d\n He lowered his head.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think it is unrealistic,\u201d she said.\n He felt the edges of his inside wound tighten just a little, start to pull together. Maybe it would fill in. Maybe the creature had not taken all of him. He stood up a little straighter.\n \u201cYou broke up with Giles,\u201d he said.\n \u201cHe was a jerk.\u201d\n \u201cI could have told you that.\u201d\n The rain pattered lightly on the leaves of the jasmine bush near the walk.\n \u201cI\u2019ve missed the rain,\u201d he said.\n \u201cI\u2019ve missed the old Coleman,\u201d she said. \u201cThat crazy guy who bought dusty old books and piled them all over his apartment.\u201d\n \u201cDid I really do that?\u201d he said.\n He felt tears on his cheeks. He thought about saving and saving until he could afford the first few months rent on a store, about finding those books he had treasured so much as a child. Maybe Julie would want to help him with the bookstore. It suddenly didn\u2019t seem so unrealistic anymore.\n She took the acrylic heart from under his arm. \u201cI wish you could put it back in,\u201d she said.\n He smiled at Julie, at the rain, at the city. \u201cIt will grow back,\u201d he said. And he knew it was true.\n Corie Ralston has had an eventful year. She bought a house, got married just before Prop 8 passed, and sold a story to Clarkesworld!

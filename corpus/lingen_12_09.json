She leaned forward, aware of the timer out of the corner of her eye without watching it. He was a smart beastie, she knew, and would get into the box to get the icthyoid in it. The question was whether he\u2019d learned anything from last time. It was the same box, the same latching mechanism, everything as much the same as she could make it.\n The seconds ticked by. Finally the box sprung open, and Hannah sighed; seventy-two-point-three seconds. It had taken seventy-one-point-eight before.\n The squid-like alien did not remember. Probably it could not remember. And that was going to be a problem.\n Delta Moncerotis Four was home to a human colony of about twenty thousand. No one knew how many of the native cephalids there were, in seven different major species. They swarmed through the oceans, some of them phosphorescing merrily. They mingled with each other, except for the ones that didn\u2019t seem to. They used things to pry into other things, if the other things were good to eat.\n The two things they did not seem to do were remembering and communicating with the alien monkeys who had invaded the part of their planet they weren\u2019t using anyway.\n Which would not have been important if the alien monkeys in question hadn\u2019t wanted to gently but firmly kick the cephalids out of the waters around their city to build an isolated area for human-edible aquaculture.\n Hannah was sure that having the cephalids where they belonged would be good for the environment and good for the colonists. There was so much planet left to survey that the cephalid interactions with local coraloids and icthyoids might vary extremely, and, from her marine xenobiologist standpoint, interestingly. She had chosen a largely watery planet for a reason. But with an entire planet worth of oceans for the cephalids to inhabit, it was hard to convince the colony government that the specific area around the city was absolutely necessary for the continued well-being of anyone in particular.\n \u201cWe change planets when we settle,\u201d the governor had told her. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it is. If it was an intelligent species\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re tool-users!\u201d Hannah had protested.\n \u201cThey appear to be opportunistic tool-users. You know that as well as I do. They\u2019ll pick something up and make it into a skewer or a pry bar, and then they\u2019ll drop it in the silt and do the whole thing over again with a different piece of vegetation or rock next time they need the very same tool. If they could tell us they wanted to be where they are, we\u2019d listen. We\u2019ve had a good record of that since the third wave of colonies.\u201d\n \u201cI know. It\u2019s just\u2014even if they don\u2019t remember things like us, they have their own interactions with their environment, that we barely know about yet!\u201d\n The governor had sighed. \u201cIf you can get any form of communication with them, we\u2019ll see what they have to say. But if we can\u2019t talk to them, we\u2019ll have to treat them like animals.\u201d At her sad look, the governor said, \u201cWe treat animals better than we used to.\u201d\n Still, even with the aquaculture developments well into development, Hannah found herself more determined, not less, that she would find some way to communicate. This was not proving easy with a species that seemed to figure everything out as if for the first time.\n On the other hand, it made them easy to keep entertained. She left the cephalid with a ring puzzle it had seen a dozen times before, busily trying the different ways to get the rings unhooked, and went home for the night.\n When the door slid open, Hannah could hear her mother\u2019s voice in the living room. \u201cYou\u2019re in my house, and you look like me, so you must be my daughter\u2014no, granddaughter?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right, Granny Dee,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI\u2019m your granddaughter. Lily.\u201d\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t remember you,\u201d said Dee thoughtfully. Hannah closed her eyes and leaned against the door, letting them go through the ritual without her. It was best when Dee was not interrupted once she\u2019d pulled the implant loose. The long pause was always the same. \u201cAnd I remember that we\u2019ve gotten good at curing genetic memory problems, so this isn\u2019t the normal deterioration with age.\u201d\n \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Lily. \u201cYou were in an accident. But we\u2019ve got a device that can help you. You just have to plug this little cord back into the socket here, see?\u201d\n The pause here was even longer, as it always was: Dee deciding whether she could trust her granddaughter, then agreeing, as always, to plug the augmenter back in. And then Dee\u2019s voice was surer, just as analytical but with better data. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lily.\u201d\n \u201cHey, no problem.\u201d Hannah decided that was her cue to enter, just in time to see Lily kissing her grandmother on the cheek. \u201cCould happen to anyone.\u201d\n In fact, if it could happen to anyone, if it was common the way organic memory problems were, they might have a better design. Hannah had asked her mother three times if she wanted to move back to a larger colony, someplace where they had the personnel and equipment for a more permanent implant. But Dee\u2019s response had been impatient.\n \u201cThis is your home,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s my home, and more than all that, it\u2019s Lily\u2019s home. I don\u2019t want to be somewhere else. We\u2019ll plug it back in and go along with our lives, you and me and Brian and Lily. We\u2019ll get by.\u201d\n But Brian had left. He couldn\u2019t stand dealing with Dee, and Hannah, when she was honest with herself, couldn\u2019t entirely blame him. Her mother couldn\u2019t live alone with the implant\u2019s unreliability, and the colony wasn\u2019t big enough to have facilities. But she wished things had been otherwise.\n \u201cIt\u2019s easy for you,\u201d Brian had said, throwing his clothes in his suitcase.\n Hannah had let her voice rise: \u201cEasy?\u201d\n For a moment he was the old Brian, the man she\u2019d married. The one she\u2019d counted on for Lily\u2019s sake. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I don\u2019t mean easy. I know it\u2019s not; she\u2019s your mother. I know it\u2019s not. But when you come home and she\u2019s pulled the implant loose, she lets you talk her through to plugging it back in again. I don\u2019t have time to deal with the constable every time I get back from work before Lily gets home from school! I don\u2019t have the energy, Hannah. You know I always liked Dee, but\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBut,\u201d Hannah agreed.\n \u201cThe good memories are getting soiled with every conversation with the constable,\u201d said Brian. \u201cWith every time I have to justify my existence in my own house again.\u201d\n Lily was like most of the colony kids, tough and talented, resilient, not afraid of work. She was not thrilled to have her father living across town. She was not thrilled to have to plug her grandmother back together every few days. But Hannah was proud to see that her daughter already understood that her life was not a series of endless thrills; Lily did what needed doing without a great deal of fuss about it.\n Hannah tried not to brood over dinner with her mother and her daughter. \u201cStill nothing from the squids, huh?\u201d said Lily.\n \u201cNothing,\u201d said Hannah miserably. \u201cI keep thinking I\u2019ve got a chance at least, and then\u2014\u201d She wiggled her fingers in the air like tentacles. \u201cThey\u2019re so clever. They\u2019re so very good at figuring things out. If the other species are as clever as the pink ones, no wonder there\u2019s sort of a squiddy feel to the whole ocean.\u201d\n \u201cBut they\u2019re still not clever enough to signal back and forth,\u201d said her mother.\n \u201cThey\u2019re not the right kind of clever. It\u2019s not what they do,\u201d said Hannah. \u201cI\u2019m really starting to think we\u2019re on the brink of proving\u2014to beyond a shadow of my doubt anyway\u2014that this is just not what they do.\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s what we do,\u201d said Lily.\n Hannah sighed. \u201cExactly.\u201d\n And if the alien species they encountered couldn\u2019t bend far enough to do things the human way, would the humans bend enough to see how they were doing them instead? It had worked with some of the larger colonies of lichen-like species on Gamma Centauri Four, but elsewhere results were mixed. And on Earth, dogs and cats were immensely more popular as pets than squid and lichen.\n The cephalid did not grow easier over the next few weeks. Hannah watched her clever subject make his morning rounds. The pink tentacles groped along the tank, then slowed, delicately searching for something in the silt. Hannah\u2019s heart skipped a beat: had he hidden something there for later? Would he remember after all?\n But no; after churning up the silt so that it wafted into the water, the cephalid resumed his exploration of the tank. He had likely been looking for a snack, and that was the sort of terrain in which juicy tidbits lurked. Instinct, not memory. Or perhaps they should think of it as species memory rather than individual memory? In that case, they\u2019d be relying upon generations upon generations of mutation to teach the cephalids how to communicate with humans. Not, Hannah thought, heartening.\n She tried putting one of the remote machines into the tank with the cephalid and showing it how to do a few of the tricks she\u2019d done. It repeated them, watching; there was something there that looked like short-term memory. But it didn\u2019t last. No matter how many times she went back to the same puzzles, the cephalids didn\u2019t recall how to work them after they\u2019d been out of sight, or after even a few minutes had passed.\n Her return home was smooth and peaceful; Dee\u2019s implant had stayed plugged in, and she and Lily were frying tofu for dipping in nuoc leo sauce. Their hands were equally sure, and all the tofu came out soft in the middle and crisp on the outside, just perfect, just the way Hannah liked it, just the way she could never make it herself.\n Hannah watched Lily doing the dishes. She was nearing the age when colony kids found apprenticeships or went offworld to study. She wanted to ask Lily what she hoped to do, but she was afraid of the answer. Instead, she sought the mundane. \u201cGot any plans for the weekend?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m taking Grandma to the beach again tomorrow,\u201d said Lily. \u201cShe liked it last time. And I have astronomy homework.\u201d\n \u201cAre you enjoying astronomy?\u201d Hannah tried not to hold her breath for the answer. Astronomers traveled too much to keep close ties to their families on colony worlds; time dilation made it impossible.\n \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Biology\u2019s better,\u201d said Lily. \u201cBiology looks back at you.\u201d\n \u201cI think the astronomers would say that about astronomy.\u201d\n Lily shrugged. \u201cThen I guess I\u2019m not an astronomer.\u201d\n Hannah laughed and hugged her. \u201cHave a good time at the beach with Grandma, then.\u201d\n Lily smiled her self-contained little smile. \u201cOh, we will.\u201d\n Later that night, when Lily was off typing homework answers into her handheld, Hannah sat down on the couch across from her mother\u2019s armchair. Dee paused her book and looked expectant.\n \u201cDo you remember that microscope you got me when I was a kid? Maybe five years younger than Lily, maybe more,\u201d said Hannah dreamily. Dee made an encouraging noise, so Hannah went on: \u201cIt came with one of those books showing what you would expect to see, and I looked at a drop of water\u2014we were on Alpha Moncerotis Six then, remember? And it was so different from in the book. The little unicellular creatures swimming around on Alpha Mon Six were totally different from the Earth ones.\n \u201cAnd I loved it, I just loved it. I begged cultures from anybody who\u2019d give me one. Cheek cells, hairs from whatever animal they were studying, plants from the colony, anything. It was the best present.\u201d\n \u201cFunny, you remembering that after all these years.\u201d\n Hannah glanced down automatically, but her mother followed her gaze. \u201cNo, the unit\u2019s fine. I really think the solder will hold it awhile longer. I just don\u2019t remember. I didn\u2019t before the injury, and I never will. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve forgotten it, because you sound like it was a hugely important piece of your childhood\u2014I wish I could remember. But it\u2019s like that, honey. There\u2019ll be something Lily thinks is the worst thing you ever did to ruin her life, or the best thing you ever did to make it work, and you will blink at her and say, \u2018I did? Did I? Oh.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cI suppose that\u2019s how it works,\u201d said Hannah. \u201cI remember her first steps, and of course she doesn\u2019t. Why shouldn\u2019t there be things that are the other way around?\u201d\n \u201cThere have to be, or she wouldn\u2019t be her own person,\u201d said Dee.\n \u201cWell, she\u2019s certainly that,\u201d said Hannah ruefully.\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dee. \u201cShe\u2019ll surprise you. That\u2019s what children are for.\u201d\n A few weeks later, Hannah looked up from the cephalid tank and its computer and found Lily and Dee standing there watching her.\n \u201cWe have a surprise for you,\u201d said Lily.\n \u201cCan it wait, honey?\u201d Hannah cast her mother an imploring glance, but Dee looked as implacable as Lily. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of work here.\u201d\n \u201cIs it going well?\u201d asked Dee.\n Hannah glared at her. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d\n \u201cA break will be good for you. Come.\u201d\n Hannah walked with her mother through their ocean-side research complex. Lily danced ahead of them like a much younger child. Hannah sighed. \u201cYou know I like to spend time with both of you, Mom, but\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHush, dear. Watch Lily.\u201d\n Lily was peeling off her clothes; she had her wetsuit underneath. She climbed onto the lip of one of the cephalid tanks. Hannah and Dee caught up with her.\n \u201cLil,\u201d said Hannah, \u201cI don\u2019t think now\u2019s the time.\u201d\n \u201cThis is what I wanted to show you, Mom.\u201d\n Dee passed a tiny flashlight and a little black box up to her granddaughter, who jumped in the tank with it. Hannah stepped forward ineffectually, knowing she couldn\u2019t stop her. \u201cOh, Mom.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not my unit, it\u2019s the spare,\u201d said Dee. \u201cThey\u2019re waterproof. Lily\u2019s tried this before.\u201d\n \u201cAnd if the spare gets damaged\u2014\u201d\n \u201cRelax. This is important. We knew you wouldn\u2019t approve right away, or we wouldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d\n Hannah shook her head. \u201cThat my mother and my daughter should use that line against me, together.\u201d\n Dee rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not against you, it\u2019s for you. Just watch.\u201d\n A curious cephalid was approaching Lily. She held out the leads to the memory unit. He probed them with one slender tentacle. Lily gently guided the leads into the cephalid\u2019s mouth orifice.\n \u201cIt\u2019s got a light display,\u201d said Dee. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on getting it connected to the output.\u201d\n \u201cA light display?\u201d\n The cephalid engulfed the leads, and the light display made itself known: every diode in it blazed. Then they rippled in a random-looking series of patterns.\n \u201cWe think he\u2019s trying to remember how to work it,\u201d said Dee. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure. We thought you could figure it out.\u201d\n \u201cAn external memory unit with built-in communications,\u201d said Hannah. \u201cOh my.\u201d\n \u201cIt was Lily\u2019s idea. I told the nanites where to solder.\u201d\n Hannah took a breath and spoke gently. \u201cMom, you know that the cephalid may not be able to use your device as memory as we would understand it, right? Being able to light up the panel doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being able to store thoughts as memory.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I know, dear. We thought of that. But we thought at least it\u2019d be something to find out.\u201d\n \u201cOh yes,\u201d Hannah agreed. \u201cDefinitely something to find out.\u201d\n Lily flashed the flashlight at the cephalid, three times. It recoiled. She flashed again, and the light display went dark. Then it lit up with a blue pattern, three times. Lily repeated it.\n \u201cShe\u2019s a natural,\u201d said Hannah.\n \u201cNature, nurture, whatever!\u201d said Dee, grinning.\n After a few more flash-patterns, Lily swam back to the lip of the tank. The cephalid made a green pattern at her, but she climbed out anyway.\n \u201cYou can do it like a real experiment,\u201d she said, shaking her black hair out. \u201cYou know how to design that sort of thing. Granny and I just got it together for you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll want to have a light bank set up,\u201d said Hannah thoughtfully.\n Lily pressed the tiny diode flashlight into her hand. \u201cTo begin with.\u201d\n Hannah turned to the cephalid and squeezed the trigger on the flashlight twice.\n Two ripples of light appeared on the modified implant\u2019s screen: first the blue pattern and then the green. \u201cHello again,\u201d said Hannah aloud.\n They had no idea what they\u2019d done, she thought. If the cephalid could deal with an external electronic system, there had to have been something in their past that allowed for it. Something evolved? More likely something created and lost\u2014and perhaps not by themselves? There would have to be a lot more xenoarchaeology before they would know who had been there before, and what they had taught the cephalids about the use of these tools.\n But there would be time for that later. For now there was a conversation Hannah had wanted to have for a long time. Smiling at the retreating backs of her mother and daughter, she flashed the little flashlight in response."}

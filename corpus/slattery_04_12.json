In retrospect, it\u2019s pretty amazing that Soviet-phobic films like The Day After (1983) and Red Dawn (1984) got made when they did. In the \u201980s the Soviet Union wasn\u2019t nearly the threat that it had once been. By the time the U.S.S.R. was in obvious decline, we\u2019d been treated to four decades of apocalypse and post-apocalypse, in movies, television, books, and even music. Bill Haley and the Comets\u2019 \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d\u2014the 1954 song often credited with putting rock \u2019n\u2019 roll on the map\u2014was first issued as the B-side to \u201cThirteen Women (and Only One Man in Town),\u201d which tells the story of a man who has a dream similar to what happens to Burgess Meredith\u2019s bookworm bank-teller in the Twilight Zone episode \u201cTime Enough at Last,\u201d except that instead of books he\u2019s left with after the bomb drops, it\u2019s women. And his glasses don\u2019t break.\nJust in case you\u2019re the last person on earth who doesn\u2019t know what a double entendre is, the music of \u201cThirteen Women\u201d clues you in to what the lyrics are talking about: The saxes are swinging, the fingers are snapping, and the guitar makes catcalls. Not to be outdone, Dinah Shore re-recorded the song with a Cuban pulse as \u201cThirteen Men,\u201d and Ann-Margaret recorded Dinah\u2019s version as a cocktail number. Also equating the split atom with sex (and also from 1954) is Fay Simmons\u2019s \u201cYou Hit Me Like an Atomic Bomb.\u201d In addition to its flagrant metaphors, it has one of the most shameless\u2014read: shamelessly terrific\u2014organ parts ever heard. By 1957, the metaphor had been used often enough that it started to get kind of meaningless. The Five Stars\u2019 \u201cAtom Bomb Baby\u201d of that year uses the couplet \u201cAtom bomb baby, little atom bomb / I want her in my wigwam\u201d\u2014five times in the same song.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand how the atom bomb got sexy. The musicians of the time were working in new, popular genres that were genetically engineered to party, and those artists were trying to make money. Sex sold then as well as it sells now, and people have never liked to pay for bad news. But it\u2019s also confusing. If you\u2019re trying not to upset people, why mention nuclear destruction at all? The reality of what nuclear war was\u2014what it could be\u2014was pretty fresh in 1954. Our atomic attacks on Japan were only nine years in the past. A year after that, John Hersey\u2019s Hiroshima, an account of that city\u2019s devastation, was a bestseller and was broadcast over the radio. Three years later the Soviet Union began testing its own nuclear weapons. People knew what was going on. So if the songs were jokes, they were dark ones, following a tradition that may have been started by Slim Galliard\u2019s \u201cAtomic Cocktail\u201d in 1945.\n\"Atomic Cocktail\" is small-combo jazz with an easy swing, the sound of skilled players relaxing in the conventions of a genre over thirty years old. And where Bill Haley is all gee-whiz-can-you-believe-my-luck energy and enthusiasm\u2014he and the Comets recorded \"Rock Around the Clock\" in the same studio session that produced \"Thirteen Women\"\u2014underneath Galliard\u2019s cool delivery lurk some pretty knowing, sinister lyrics: \"When you see it coming, grab your suitcase / It\u2019ll send you through the sky like airmail\u2014BOOM\u2014atomic cocktail.\"\nIssued by the record company Atomic, Inc., the record\u2019s blood-red label features what looks a lot like an explosion on the upper half, which then sends black lines sweeping along the inside curve toward a tiny human figure on the bottom. Arms outstretched, hands up, the figure might be partying; it might also be on fire and disintegrating. The same dichotomy is in the song: The music tells you to take it easy, but the lyrics tell you to run for it. You could say \u201cAtomic Cocktail\u201d charted the landscape for how popular music could deal with the atom, and if Bill Haley and Fay Simmons, representing rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and lounge, went all in for the party, other artists\u2014and other, older genres\u2014took a look at what they thought the future might hold. And they weren\u2019t so quick to laugh.\nThe fight about whether the \u201950s-and-\u201960s folk revival was really folk\u2014which is really a fight about what the word folk means\u2014is never going to end. But the gist of that genre\u2019s narrative is hard to argue with: Starting in the late \u201940s, a bunch of people started to get interested in the music that poor Americans had played a generation before them. These revivalists both resuscitated that music and wrote their own songs harkening back to those styles as best they could. They shouldered for themselves the weight of history that came naturally to blues, jazz, country, and gospel, and under that heavy load, simple partying was impossible. Sarcasm wasn\u2019t, though, as Bob Dylan\u2019s 1963 \u201cTalking World War III Blues\u201d attests.\nIn the song, Dylan\u2019s approach is less \u201cThirteen Women\u201d and more \u201cAtomic Cocktail\u201d\u2014or even The Crown City Four\u2019s 1960 excoriating barbershop quartet-meets-marching-band cut \u201cWatch World War Three (on Pay TV).\u201d The conventions of an older musical genre gave Dylan the sarcastic tools he needed to approach his subject head on. But the young Dylan couldn\u2019t escape the sheer anxiety, either. According to the liner notes for The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall\u201d was written in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Dylan is quoted as saying that \u201cevery line in it is actually the start of a whole song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn\u2019t have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one.\u201d And Dylan, of course, was his generation\u2019s genius\u2014maybe the genius for multiple genres that came after him, despite his dire fortunetelling.\nFolksinger Bonnie Dobson was humbler than Dylan. Still, her \u201cMorning Dew,\u201d also from 1962, employed the same trick as \u201cA Hard Rain\u2019s Gonna Fall\u201d: to make a serious treatment of annihilation listenable. \u201cMorning Dew\u201d turned out to have legs; it captured what so many people liked about the music of the folk revival and has since been recorded 32 times (and counting) by other artists, from hippies like the Grateful Dead to noiseniks like Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten. The lyrics are oblique enough that you could listen to the whole thing without knowing that it was heavily inspired by Nevil Shute\u2019s 1957 post-apocalyptic novel, On the Beach\u2014but Dobson is on record as saying that is indeed the case. If so, she made a smart aesthetic decision. The lyrics\u2019 opacity is probably what saved the song. And made it a minor classic of nuclear-paranoia folk.\nFor a foil to \u201cMorning Dew,\u201d consider \u201cFallout Shelter,\u201d yet again from 1962. The song is credited to Billy Chambers, who sang it. But it was written and produced by Bobby Braddock, who told Cold War-nostalgia website CONELRAD, \u201cTo be very candid, I was a musician going through serious psychological problems due to an overdose of speed at the time, and I was quite paranoid; I had tried to talk my parents into having a fallout shelter built.\u201d He was also inspired by a Twilight Zone episode titled \u201cThe Shelter,\u201d which is about a small town torn apart by a false alarm of an impending nuclear attack.\nBraddock, who went on to be an immensely successful Nashville songwriter and was recently inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, now humorously disowns his work on \u201cFallout Shelter.\u201d Musically, he\u2019s being a little hard on himself. The song\u2019s Spanish-tinged rock is reminiscent of Roy Orbison, and the music\u2019s quite pretty. It\u2019s the lyrics that justify Braddock\u2019s harsh judgment. The premise is as timeless: Two teenagers want to be together, but their parents won\u2019t let them. Tragedy ensues. That story shows up everywhere from the traditional American song \u201cKaty Dear\u201d to Romeo and Juliet, but somehow exporting it to the context of nuclear annihilation fails. In the song, all the bombs fall, and the narrator, a young man, begs his parents to let him bring his girlfriend with her into their fallout shelter. The parents refuse, saying there isn\u2019t enough room for her, and the boyfriend decides to stay outside with his true love so they can die together. By the time the narrator gets to the money line\u2014\u201cYou hold my hand, I understand / The sickness has begun / And if we live or if we die / Our hearts will beat as one\u201d\u2014you\u2019ve probably checked out. Braddock, working in what was then a new flavor of rock and country, couldn\u2019t get at the terror of the subject without putting people off. It was more weight than the young musician\u2014and a young music\u2014could bear.\nThe straight-up country music of the Cold War era though, knew exactly what to do. It had deep roots in Appalachian ballads and hymns, and it had been viable commercial music since the \u201920s. In 1927, The Carter Family sang that \u201cGod gave Noah the rainbow sign / No more water, but fire next time,\u201d so for country musicians, writing about atomic power was easy. Next time meant now. Hawkshaw Hawkins\u2019s 1947 song \u201cWhen They Found the Atomic Power\u201d understands the A-bomb as a divine sign that we\u2019d better stop fighting. The Buchanan Brothers\u2019 \u201cAtomic Power\u201d from 1946 considers Little Boy and Fat Man\u2014the codenames of the bombs dropped on Japan in 1945\u2014as \u201cbrimstone fire,\u201d judging that \u201cHiroshima and Nagasaki paid a big price for their sins.\u201d But lest we think the United States is off the hook for fiery repentance, there\u2019s Fred Kirby\u2019s \"When the Hell Bomb Falls.\" That song, like Hank Williams\u2019s \"When the Fire Comes Down\" and Jim Anglin\u2019s \"This World Can\u2019t Stand Long,\" implicates all of us: \"He gave us all this blessed land, and this I cannot understand / A weapon of destruction to destroy us, everyone.\"\nAccording to country music\u2019s diagnosis, we\u2019re all in trouble. The Buchanans, however, make a pretty interesting last move in \u201cAtomic Power\u201d that starts to get past even the cohesive narrative of atomic power as God\u2019s wrath: \u201cBut on that day of judgment when comes a greater power,\u201d they sing, \u201cwe will not know the minute and we\u2019ll not know the hour.\u201d That\u2019s where gospel picks up, and gospel has some even deeper sources to tap. By 1945, gospel as a marketed genre was over twenty years old. And like country music it had stayed relatively close to its roots in spirituals, which went back a few centuries. The tradition encompasses and draws strength from a history of unbelievable hardship, including the Middle Passage and the immense, horrific legacy of slavery.\nThat perspective makes \u201cJesus Hits Like an Atom Bomb\u201d a pretty unique thing. It began life as a country song, written by Lee McCollum. As recorded by Lowell Blanchard and the Valley Trio in 1950, it\u2019s a bit of a novelty number, easy to take none too seriously. But gospel groups latched onto it and made it theirs. The Soul Stirrers\u2014which would include a pre-fame Sam Cooke over the years\u2014recorded it the same year. Then the Pilgrim Travelers did it in 1951. Both of them changed the song\u2019s tone, from jokey to celebratory, from declamatory to comforting. In doing so, they turned the country narrative about the atomic bomb inside out. For them, the threat of nuclear war isn\u2019t a big deal; like the Buchanans suggest, it\u2019s the Second Coming that we really need to watch out for. But where the Buchanans see menace, the gospel singers see hope. They\u2019re looking forward to the day Jesus brings them home, and they accomplish in two lines what all the other above-mentioned songs never quite do: They defuse the bomb.\n\u201cJesus Hits,\u201d in the hands of gospel musicians, transcends the bomb\u2019s threat of complete annihilation. Yeah, it\u2019s bad, gospel says. But gospel has seen bad. And its audience\u2014which has been wronged, over and over, and carries the wisdom of that from generation to generation\u2014has already seen a catastrophe or two. They\u2019ve already witnessed the ruination of peoples, nations, and continents. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll tries to go crazy and party that away. Country tells us to be afraid for what we\u2019ve done. Jazz tells us to take it easy; there\u2019s nothing we can do about it anyway. But \u201cJesus Hits\u201d goes further. It tells us that nuclear war is just the latest apocalypse; when the threat of it subsides, there will be another apocalypse waiting. And the biggest one is always coming, until the world really ends and begins again.\nThe gospel singers were right. For all the decades of obsession with nuclear annihilation\u2014which shaped everything from politics to science fiction to music\u2014after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the threat of death from atomic weapons turned out to have been a false alarm. But it\u2019s too easy to make that point now, in hindsight. Maybe it\u2019s possible to render the threat of global thermonuclear war quaint because it had a single cause\u2014the U.S.S.R.\u2014compared to our current era of multiple catastrophes: terrorism, economic hardship, political chaos, climate change.\nCulturally speaking, it\u2019s hard now to point the finger, to color the map, to place what\u2019s going on into a tidy context that makes it all easier to understand. But we can feel it. We see it in the news. We absorb it from books, the movies, TV, and, yes, music. And maybe all the worry is justified; on some level we comprehend what\u2019s up, even if we can\u2019t articulate it as a coherent concept or give it a name. But maybe we\u2019re missing the signs of something bigger that pulls it all together\u2014signs, perhaps delivered in song form, that will seem obvious generations from now. If that future comes, will we wonder why we worried so much about everything else? And what will we listen to then?"}

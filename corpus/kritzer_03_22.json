Also to doodle. I\u2019ve always had trouble paying attention in client meetings, which is why I\u2019m the bioengineer and not the manager.\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s Chinese New Year,\u201d the client continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be the Year of the Dragon. And I want the dragon ready for the parade.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the Year of the Dragon,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s two years from now. This year is the Year of the Tiger.\u201d I noticed, too late, that my business partner Jed was sending me a text saying shhhh Vivian shhhh.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure every year is the Year of the Dragon somewhere,\u201d the client said confidently.\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Jed. This was definitely wrong, but Jed sent me another chat message, this one saying SHHHHHH in all capital letters. Also, I\u2019d realized that I\u2019d rather make a dragon than a tiger.Probably Jed was having the same thought.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole ad campaign planned around having a dragon,\u201d the client said. \u201cBut we\u2019re thinking we\u2019ll roll it out at the parade in San Francisco. They have one of those dragon parade float thingies, right?\u201d\nI let Jed handle that one and started quietly sketching out the plan for the dragon.\nI am a bioengineer working in living 3D printing. What I trained to do was make 3D printed organs for transplant. Those are more useful than custom-printed animals. But it turns out that not all that many people each year need a new kidney or a new heart, and organ transplants aren\u2019t the sort of surgery anyone gets for fun. So by the time I had my degree, there were way more bioengineers than the 3D organ printing labs actually needed.\nSo I was happy when my college friend Jed suggested we go into business together making custom animals. Jed had majored in business communications, and he handled client management and all the stuff like \u201cactually sending out bills for the work we did.\u201d I did all the lab work. I made enough to pay for a very small apartment in San Jose, close to the lab. Jed didn\u2019t have to come to San Jose in person all that often, so he bought a house in Modesto, which is a long drive from San Jose but cheaper.\nFor most of our first two years, we made hypoallergenic cats, clones of people\u2019s dead pets, and occasional odd projects like a Chihuahua dog that looked like a tiny Siberian tiger if the tiger were also a dog. It was owned by a very rich lady who liked to pose with it and take pictures. Jed had been kind of hoping this would start a fad for tigerdogs, but no one else had hired us to make one.\nPeople had been asking for dragons for a while, but this client\u2014I think he was a hedge fund manager who was starting a new entertainment streaming service, but possibly he was an entertainment streaming service CEO who was starting a hedge fund. Did I mention I\u2019m bad at paying attention in meetings? Whichever it was, his company was called Imaginational Criterion. The client\u2014whose name was Brody or Brayden or maybe Bryce\u2014was the first person to come along with enough money to really kick the dragon development project into gear.\nI sat down with my sketchbook and started thinking about what a dragon ought to look like.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the client said, looking at the dragon.\nMy dragon climbed down my arm to the keyboard and stretched out in front of my laptop camera, arching its back. \u201cOh, big stretch,\u201d I whispered to it under my breath.\n\u201cThat thing doesn\u2019t even have wings! Does it breathe fire?\u201d\n\u201cWe discussed fire,\u201d Jed said. \u201cSpecifically, we discussed the insurance requirements of a dragon that could actually breathe fire.\u201d\n\u201cChinese dragons don\u2019t breathe fire,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have wings.\u201d Although they do fly. This one didn\u2019t fly. To fly for real, you need both wings and hollow bones; I thought it would be better to make a sturdy dragon.\n\u201cAlso, a dragon should be larger! That thing is the size of a squirrel?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bigger than a squirrel,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe discussed size parameters,\u201d Jed said. \u201cWe agreed on a five-to-ten-pound dragon.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not paying for this!\u201d Bryce said.\n\u201cThe contract clearly says . . . \u201d\nI stopped listening. The dragon also looked like it had stopped listening; it climbed down and started playing with my shoelace. Out of view of the camera, I dangled a mystery cable (does everyone accumulate mystery cables on their desk or is it just me?), and the dragon leaped up to grab it, clinging with all four feet. I\u2019d given it little claws on its toes so it could cling pretty well.\nI suddenly realized that Jed was saying my name, and I tried to look like I\u2019d been paying attention all along. \u201cVivian. Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d I said, and hoped I was telling the truth.\nThe \u201cdo you think it\u2019s possible\u201d turned out to be \u201cgrow another dragon by the deadline.\u201d\nFor the second dragon, I was told to make it bigger, fiercer looking, and to give it wings.\n\u201cWings are inauthentic,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo one cares,\u201d Jed said.\nThe first dragon was about the size of a cat, and since the client had refused delivery, I kept him. I fed him crickets and mealworms, shaved carrots and diced peppers, crunchy cat kibble, and occasional cans of sardines. The dragon grew plump, developed a habit of begging at the table, and shredded my sofa and curtains with his claws. He also liked to lie across the back of my shoulders when I was working, like a tiny scaly heating pad. (Despite the scales, he wasn\u2019t a reptile; I had thought a warm-blooded dragon would have a more interesting personality. There are scaled mammals, like pangolins.) He ran around the house with a little galumphing hop.\nAs the second dragon gestated at the lab, I started calling the first dragon Mr. Long. (\u201cLong\u201d is Chinese for dragon; also, he was rather long.) Mr. Long started getting into things. First he figured out how to open up the cabinet where I stored the cat kibble. I kept his crickets and mealworms in a terrarium; he opened that up and set them free because he found it entertaining to chase them around the house. He figured out how to turn on the bathtub faucet, though not how to put the stopper in the drain to actually get himself a bath, and he discovered that my pillows were full of feathers that would blow all over the bedroom when ripped open.\nThis was fine. I switched to synthetic pillows, resigned myself to hearing the chirp of crickets from odd locations, and adjusted the water heater so that his impromptu bath parties wouldn\u2019t leave him with scalds.\nI designed the new dragon with a face that showed off his teeth more, since they wanted \u201cfierce,\u201d and wings, as instructed, although basically the wings were a crest it could raise in display. Also, it would have feathers instead of scales. One of the Bryce\u2019s complaints about Mr. Long was that he was tan instead of brightly colored, and colorful feathers are easy. (Actual reptiles come in a wide variety of colors as well, but scaled mammals are basically all shades of brown. I\u2019m sure I could figure out how to make a colorful scaled mammal given time, but we were in a hurry.)\nLike a baby bird, the new dragon came out soggy, scrawny, and ravenously hungry. Unlike a bird, it had teeth. I took it home to feed it and give it time to grow. Mr. Long found it entertaining to help feed the new dragon, stuffing mealworms and canned tuna and peanut butter sandwiches into its mouth until it got less wobbly and more independent.\nOnce he\u2019d plumped up a bit, I was really happy with the look of the new dragon. His feathers were red and gold and iridescent black. His face looked fierce, but he was just happy all the time, although he was definitely happiest when he was making a mess. Mr. Long would open cabinets for him, and he\u2019d pull stuff out from inside and scatter it everywhere. He was also a fan of baths, and he figured out that if he put his butt right over the drain, the tub would start to fill up. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t have the attention span to actually flood the bathroom.\nMr. Long used a litterbox like a cat, but the new dragon, who I\u2019d started calling Timothy, really needed time outside, so I bought leashes for both dragons and started taking them out for walks. I probably should have expected what happened next, which was staring, questions, and requests for more information. Mostly about Timothy: Mr. Long preferred to ride on my neck, and if I pulled up my hood people didn\u2019t notice him unless he wanted to be noticed. When people asked for business cards, I gave them Jed\u2019s email address, since the last thing I wanted was to have to answer email from all the people who thought Timothy was a feathered dog with wings. \u201cHe\u2019s a dragon,\u201d I said repeatedly. I was pretty sure just from how often I was getting asked this question that the client was not going to be happy.\nI was right.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a dragon,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look anything like a dragon.\u201d\n\u201cHe has wings,\u201d I pointed out.\nTimothy flopped down on the floor and used one of his back legs to scratch under his wing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dog,\u201d the client said. \u201cThat looks like a dog. With feathers and wings. It doesn\u2019t even breathe fire.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this,\u201d Jed said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve trained this one for you,\u201d I said. \u201cThis dragon is housebroken. Also, if you ask nicely, he will get things for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it plays fetch,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cLike a dog.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want him to play fetch with you, he will play fetch with you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat is a feathered dog.\u201d\n\u201cWe sent you sketches,\u201d Jed said. \u201cWhich you signed off on.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cWhen I\u2019ve taken Timothy to the park, I\u2019ve had dozens of people asking about buying a similar animal.\u201d\n\u201cYou named it Timothy?\u201d the client asked.\n\u201cJust temporarily,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThis is nothing like what I asked for, and I\u2019m not paying,\u201d the client said.\n\u201cYou know what,\u201d Jed said, losing his temper. \u201cWe\u2019ve now created dragons for you twice, you\u2019ve had the opportunity to inspect our work at every step of the way, and both times you\u2019ve refused to take delivery. Timothy is a very good dragon, and you don\u2019t deserve him anyway. You\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fire me!\u201d Bryce screeched. \u201cI\u2019m the customer!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d Jed said again, more loudly. \u201cGood day.\u201d\nIt turned out that Jed wanted Timothy, which was a relief because my apartment really was not big enough for a dog. A dog-sized dragon. Either one.\nOn the other hand, it was the perfect size for a scaly little cat. Or a cat-sized dragon, whatever. So I kept Mr. Long and bought childproofing locks for all my cabinets. Mr. Long was a little restless when his buddy went away, but then settled back into his routine of turning on the bathtub and getting into the cabinets and then sleeping on my pillow at night where his breath tickled my cheek. Sometimes on weekends I drove out to Modesto so he and Timothy could have a play date.\nWe thought we\u2019d heard the last from the client. It turned out we were wrong.\nWhen \u201cFire at Imaginational Criterion HQ\u201dcrossed my news feed, I have to admit that my first thought was just, \u201cOh, I could cancel that news alert.\u201d It was not, \u201cOh, Brent or Bryce or whatever his name was must have found someone to make him a fire-breathing dragon.\u201d\nIt should have been, though!\nThe Chinese New Year parades had come and gone without any dragons other than Mr. Long, who was not in the parade but came with me as a spectator, riding on my shoulder. Jed had asked me nicely to leave my hood down and hand out business cards to anyone who expressed an interest, which I did since the cards all had his email address and not mine.\nWe were well into summer when the news story hit about our former client, and I didn\u2019t think anything more about it until I started hearing rumors about a cryptid that everyone was calling the Palo Alto Hippogriff.\nHippogriffs are mythological beasts with the back end of a horse and the front end and wings of an eagle, and the thing about a cryptid walking around in the twenty-first century is that sooner or later someone will get a decent picture of it. I saw the picture, thought, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look like a hippogriff to me, it looks like a dragon,\u201d and that\u2019s when it hit me. Two minutes later, I was digging up everything else I could find about the fire, and about Imaginational Criterion, and I realized that one of the employees who got quoted\u2014Kyle Crocker III\u2014was someone I\u2019d run into in my bioengineering program back in college.\nJed and I hadn\u2019t shared a major in college; we\u2019d met bashing each other with foam swords in a LARPing club. Kyle Crocker III had been a freshman when I was a senior, and I remembered him because at one point that year there was a talk with a reception after, and while I was drinking punch and eating a cookie in a corner, he came over and tried to explain DNA to me. Incorrectly. And when my advisor pulled me out of the corner to introduce me to the speaker, Kyle followed and tried to explain DNA to her, too.\nBut he did graduate from the same program I went to.\nAnd he and Brent were probably in the same frat.\nI looked at the picture of the cryptid again. Short legs, a barrel-chested body, a long neck. It had wings (but they were much too small to lift it). In the picture, I couldn\u2019t tell if it had feathers or scales\u2014just that the creature was dark gray, not brightly colored. I could kind of see why people thought it was horselike, even though the legs were not nearly long enough.\nMy first concern was for the poor domestic dragon stuck living in the woods. But the second thing that hit me: California is very flammable. Pretty much the whole state. We have serious problems with wildfires. I wasn\u2019t sure what they\u2019d done to make this dragon breathe fire, but any feral animal that breathed fire running around in the woods in California was a terrible idea.\nMost of the sightings had been in Palo Alto\u2019s Foothills Park or one of the adjacent nature preserves. Dragons like to play, eat, and play with things they can also eat, which raised the question for me of what this dragon might like to eat. The people seeing him were thinking \u201chorse,\u201d so . . . maybe horse treats?\nMy college friend Nadia had grown up on a farm in Washington state and had a horse. One time I\u2019d visited her during spring break, and she\u2019d given me apples, carrots, and sugar cubes to feed her horse. So before I headed to Palo Alto, I went to a grocery store to stock up. I brought Mr. Long with me. He\u2019d gotten along very well with Timothy; hopefully the new dragon would like him, too.\nI parked at a trailhead, loaded the food into my backpack along with snacks and water for me and Mr. Long, and hiked up the trail. I cut up apples and tried just dropping apple wedges occasionally as I went, figuring that if the dragon didn\u2019t eat them, I\u2019d make a squirrel happy. After a while, I started adding the occasional sugar cube.\nOn my shoulder, Mr. Long suddenly sat up with interest, and I slowed my steps and looked around.\nA big, squat, winged creature was on the path behind me, slurping up a sugar cube with his long tongue. He had scales, and in the shaft of sunlight I could see that they were a sort of dark iridescent green, not the gray I\u2019d seen in the photo. He was designed to look like a western dragon instead of a Chinese dragon, but he was still really pretty.\nI\u2019d been thinking I\u2019d lead him back to my car, but looking at him in person, I realized that wouldn\u2019t work. He was a lot bigger than I\u2019d expected and would definitely not fit. He chomped down the apple, then sat up and belched noisily.\nMethane, I thought. That\u2019s probably how they did the fire: he belches methane. Horses fart methane, so making a dragon who belched methane would have been relatively straightforward, and in a parade, you could send along a human with a lighter. Methane doesn\u2019t usually spontaneously combust, but I could vouch for the many ways that dragons could make trouble; this guy might have broken into the kitchen to find a snack and turned on the stove by accident. Or maybe they\u2019d overloaded a power strip and a badly timed burp had turned a smoldering circuit into a building fire.\nI took out my phone, got a couple of good pictures of the dragon, and then called Jed. \u201cI need a horse trailer,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve found their dragon.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s their dragon, why is it our problem?\u201d he asked.\nI just sat there in silence for a minute.\n\u201cOkay fine,\u201d Jed said, heaving a sigh.\n\u201cI should warn you, I think he burps methane,\u201d I said.\n\u201cProbably better not leave him running around, then,\u201d Jed agreed.\n\u201cAlso, Mr. Long doesn\u2019t want me to leave him.\u201d\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ll be there in a couple of hours.\u201d\nI worried that I would run out of treats to keep the new dragon from running off, but like Timothy, he clearly viewed Mr. Long as a friend. Eventually, a sugar cube at a time, I led him back to the parking lot where Jed had arrived with a rented trailer.\n\u201cWhat a monstrosity,\u201d Jed said when we arrived.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you go insulting Sweetpea,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou named it Sweetpea?\u201d\nWe loaded Sweetpea into the trailer and took him to Jed\u2019s house in Modesto, since he definitely was not going to fit into my apartment. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my insurer about the methane,\u201d Jed said.\nTwo weeks passed. We figured out that much like with cattle and horses, feeding Sweetpea a diet that was partly seaweed cut back significantly on the methane he burped up\u2014that was good news. We were working on finding him a good home when Bryce and Kyle showed up and accused us of theft.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy would we steal a bioengineered animal from you? Our work is better than yours.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to the news articles,\u201d Jed said, \u201cyour corporate headquarters, and all contents, were completely destroyed. If you had made a creature similar to this one, it undoubtedly died tragically in the fire.\u201d\n\u201cObviously it escaped,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cI know my work! My superior work, or you wouldn\u2019t be so eager to keep it!\u201d\n\u201cI tell you what,\u201d Jed said. \u201cIf you know the creature, then the creature presumably knows you. Let\u2019s have you and Vivian stand at opposite ends of a basketball court, with the creature in the middle. You can each call him and see who he goes to.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring treats,\u201d I protested to Jed once Kyle was out of earshot.\n\u201cOf course he\u2019ll bring treats,\u201d Jed said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have agreed to this if we\u2019d set \u2018no treats\u2019 down as a ground rule, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because Sweetpea will pick you.\u201d\nWe had a neutral party lead Sweetpea out to the middle of the court. Jed and I stood at one end with a bag of apples. Kyle and Bryce stood down at the other with a giant bowl with a mix of fruit and candy in it.\nI was worried for a minute.\nBut only for a minute, because as soon as Sweetpea was off his lead, he turned his back on Bryce and Kyle and headed straight to me. I don\u2019t think he even noticed I had apples, but I gave him one anyway, of course.\nKyle knew he\u2019d lost, but Bryce came over, furious, and started yelling about lawsuits and \u201cthe animal\u2019s choice is not legally significant\u201d and something about \u201crestitution without compensation.\u201d I really don\u2019t like it when people get in my space. It\u2019s one of the reasons I like working with Jed: he doesn\u2019t get in my space, and he deals with clients, so they don\u2019t (usually) get in my space. I backed up, but Sweetpea was behind me, so I couldn\u2019t back up very far.\nSweetpea looked at me, and looked at the client, and let out a delicate little burp. Such a little burp.\nAnd it ignited into a tiny little methane fireball that burned off Bryce\u2019s eyebrows, some of his hair, and left him with a blister on his nose.\nWe had been assuming that Sweetpea couldn\u2019t light his own fires\u2014because we hadn\u2019t seen him do it.\nWe\u2019d assumed wrong. We just hadn\u2019t given him reason to want to do it.\nBryce switched instantly from yelling about his property to yelling about an injury lawsuit, and he and Kyle got back into their fancy car and drove away, and that was that.\nSweetpea went to live with Nadia, who was a little disconcerted by the whole explanation but fell in love with Sweetpea as soon as she met him. She lives somewhere that gets plenty of rain, and I knew she\u2019d be able to keep up with a dragon. The problem with dragons as pets was, they\u2019re clever. And they like to make trouble.\nBut they will also drape themselves over your shoulders to keep you warm on chilly winter days, and once they learn what pillows are for they share them instead of destroying them, and they not only come when called, they come when they think they\u2019re being talked about because apparently they like to eavesdrop.\nMr. Long has learned how to make tea. He\u2019s not very good at it yet, but if I fill the electric kettle up at bedtime, he starts it in the morning and makes tea for me as I\u2019m getting up.\nBut what we\u2019ve started to learn, now that we\u2019re making more of them: you have to be the right person to deserve a dragon.\nNaomi Kritzer has been writing science fiction and fantasy for over twenty years.

An unknown contractor had sandwiched it in between the dimly lit twenty-second and the exceptionally roomy fifty-fifth, either for fun or as a publicity stunt. As they walked up they saw through the big windows an embarrassed town changed very much by the linear perspective, refracted here and there as if seen through a huge quivering prism, scared, shiny, dark-cornered. One of the corners folded up and the rain flickering along the horizon trembled there like piano strings.\n The starry heaven gaped over the clouds. The constellations and shiny dabs of galaxies wheeled there, shivering with their own beauty. Seeing this, a lady with a tame cobra around her neck frowned and strained herself to unlock the door. She was long-legged and purebred like a Great Dane.\n \u201cSavior, hold it, please,\u201d she said.\n She handed him the pensive cobra, and made her hands free for a two-handed key. Savior took the snake. The cobra shook its head as if rousing itself, then squashed his hand, smiling quite cheekily and glistening as if it were smeared with stale grease. Savior put the snake into a pot with a cocoa palm and it immediately, with rumbling stomach, muzzled into the soil rich in fluoric limestone.\n \u201cShouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d said the lady. \u201cNow she\u2019ll gnaw the roots. She\u2019s a snake, a predator. Understand?\u201d\n Savior presented her with a bunch of red folios, and she gave him a condescending nod. They entered.\n The boss sat at a round table elongated enough to receive lots of victuals, which formed a slanted turret in the middle of it. Steamed crab legs, made of wild sardine scale, crowned the turret. A few nonentities with indiscernible faces sat nearby, so the table was empty to the right and to the left as well.\n A security guard with such a muscular neck that the muscles dangled below his shoulders slept at some distance. A dog, extremely lean and long, romped on a leash staying aloof. The pet was so attenuated by hunger that you had to have a really trained eye to distinguish it from the leash. It licked off its sweat reducing the environmental pollution. Very far away three moneychangers, small end evil like avian flu viruses, played cards for curtseys with a coal-miner. A buffoon played the pipe and sold doves.\n Savior froze, stunned. He had expected to see something unbelievable here, but this impossible world was anti-believable, and it had a hypnotizing music of its own at that, a shrieking sort of music that can sound inside a happy lunatic\u2019s mind; it jammed a low, quiet voice of conscience Savior had been always listening to. This world looked him over with button eyes, grinned, let him in.\n \u201cI don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d Savior whispered.\n \u201cWhat about getting paid?\u201d the world asked.\n \u201cOh. It would be nice.\u201d\n \u201cGot dyspepsia?\u201d the lady asked and Savior started.\n \u201cNo, I was just thinking.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, thinking gives me gas too,\u201d the lady said in a brain-shrinking voice.\n \u201cHi,\u201d the boss said, \u201cSavior? The one? Welcome.\u201d\n He held out his hand with five nails, and the Savior shook it, feeling prone to cringe.\n \u201cWell, well, I know,\u201d the boss said. \u201cHeard much about you, you\u2019re that tough guy who cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and even overthrew the tables of the moneychangers. It\u2019s my house! Ye have made it a den of thieves! Piss off everybody! I can appreciate such things. But, you know, tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis. I mean, times change. Just in case, if you forgot Latin. Today wine maketh us merry: and money answereth all things. By the way, want to drink? No? Pity. I know everything about you because my people never lie, though I don\u2019t believe them of course. So want to hear it from you. From the horse\u2019s mouth, ha-ha. Don\u2019t be modest. Position yourself. Can fly? Or walk on water?\u201d\n The boss took from the table a forty-three-barreled cigarette lighter.\n \u201cYes,\u201d Savior said.\n \u201cCool. Will you fly if I throw you out of the window, right now?\u201d\n The boss brushed Savior\u2019s cheek with his fingers, quick and spidery, incompatible with his plump face.\n \u201cNo, I\u2019d be killed. The ability to fly, uh . . . comes to me, from time to time. I can try, though. Maybe, if not very high . . . \u201d\n He flew up and hovered for a minute above the table. The lady was busy putting on her nose a layer of absolutely transparent powder. The coal-sweep had already lost the game and given out all the curtseys. Being sick and tired of everything, he pressed his stained face to the wall and charcoaled a self-portrait there. Savior was hovering. His face wore a dreamy look necessary for flights.\n \u201cThat wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d the boss said. \u201cBe my friend. Meet this girl. She\u2019s Denise. A female variant from Denis. And don\u2019t meet the others. They are morons.\u201d\n The lady with the key slowly winked; she was aristocratic like an oyster in spinach. Then unscrewed a stiletto-heel and picked her teeth with it.\n They spoke of this and that, then the conversation turned to food and stopped at this comprehensive point. The buffoon got tired of selling the lewd doves and, being hungry, sucked at his saliva ejector. The nonentities kept doing nothing. Their gazes moved up and down Denise\u2019s legs polishing them to a mirror luster. The words stirred in Savior\u2019s mouth, losing taste like a wad of chewing gum.\n \u201cThey say you can live on spirit,\u201d said the boss in a voice of a business executive opening a staff conference. \u201cI hope that\u2019s true.\u201d\n Savior was about to say something noncommercial but changed his mind and answered artlessly. \u201cSometimes. But I eat, as a rule. Something low-caloric. Austere repast, you know.\u201d\n \u201cCook yourself?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cBy a fiat of will?\u201d\n \u201cNo. Prefer a microwave.\u201d\n The boss raised his brow as if surprised at such an extravagance. \u201cNow you listen to me, bud,\u201d he said. \u201cI want here and now, by a fiat of will. Make for me something really delicious and special to eat.\u201d\n \u201cI can cook for you cobra\u2019s flesh. Is it okay?\u201d\n \u201cGo on, man, go on.\u201d\n Savior took a porno magazine decorating the table and flipped through. One of the women fitted perfectly: snake-eyed and resembling a piece of meat. He decided to make the dish from this picture. Tore it out, crumpled, and placed on the plate. Intertwined his fingers over it.\n The boss went out of the room not wanting to wait for at least fifteen minutes. The buffoon was licking the paints off the pictures and shoving them into the proper tubes; the dog watched him with a melancholic rapacity in its heart. Denise played with a gold watch chain and moved rhythmically her wonderful eyelashes, so long and dense that they could shovel humus.\n \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d she asked and made the moment flinch.\n \u201cEverything,\u201d Savior said.\n \u201cThe most difficult, I mean.\u201d\n \u201cWith a single word I can make a man happy.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d Denise said, \u201cI can do it too. Hey, guard, I order you to be happy.\u201d\n The guard woke up and burst out laughing, junked up with official delight. He was prompt to carry out the orders to sob, to fall in love, to go mad and senile, to get prodigious acne, and at last to go to sleep again. The nonentities echoed, though not at all concerned. Savior was talking, keeping his mind intent. He developed some arguments to Denise. She was listening to him with unflagging indifference. He was so carried away that he didn\u2019t even notice the sudden appearance of a black car smelling of expensive lubricant.\n The guys in the car started shooting, and a bullet plowed through Savior\u2019s spinal column. He stooped a little more, trying to remain concentrated, but the smell of the smoldering varnish distracted him. The bullet, which had popped out of his chest, was spinning on the table, before his eyes, a puffing lead corpuscle scorching the polish. Denise fired back with an enviable sang-froid and picked off two of attackers: one of them died in the driver\u2019s seat; the other got a bullet in his lung. This one fell out of the car and immersed into the green shag of the carpet. The carpet liana crawled up to him planning to suck out all his fluids except the toxins. Two non-entities were killed immediately; the third tried to flee away but died of fright on the way. The moment wheezed and wriggled on the floor. Time kept going, but away from the penal acts. Time was accustomed to such scenes, it knew what to do.\n Security guards came in time splitting their sides with belated laughter, and Denise shut them up. She leaned over the dying man and eyed with curiosity the incarnadine foam on his lips. She looked like a preteen school-girl with innocent buds of breasts under a t-shirt who for the first time pressed her orbital bone against the ocular of a microscope. Her face shone like a fluorescent lamp.\n \u201cWell, now,\u201d she said in a voice of a virgin waiting for her first kiss, \u201cwe met at last, didn\u2019t we? Oh, you want to die so much, no, no, don\u2019t cheat me, you\u2019re not dying yet, want a drop of water, huh? Nuts to you . . . Gimme a rag.\u201d\n A guard gave it.\n She moistened the rag in the aquarium where sharky-fish shaggy with algae finned optimistically, and moved it over the lips of the dying man. A drop dropped. The man moved, moaned, and she lifted her hand.\n \u201cNope, no way, no water today,\u201d she said in a voice of a yeanling jumping around a barn.\n The boss appeared at last, sat down at the table, and started peeling a sea tomato.\n \u201cWhat about my meat here?\u201d he asked, then noticed the blood and scowled at that unhygienic nuisance. The blood washed itself off.\n \u201cAlmost done,\u201d Savior said. \u201cWhy is she torturing him? Let him die.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d like to, dude, but no. It\u2019s personal. He is the Denis. I mean, Denise is a female name made from him. They rubbed shoulders, then, you know how it goes, rubbed not only shoulders; now they\u2019re like a dog and a cat. I don\u2019t meddle with their lives. If the torture bothers you, make him die.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t make anybody die.\u201d\n \u201cI can,\u201d the boss said in a voice of inborn certainty. \u201cHey, you there, die!\u201d\n Three guards died and the long dog turned his heels up. The fourth guard jumped out of the window trying to escape his master\u2019s anger. The buffoon got stricken by paralysis. The remote coal-sweep escaped with severe fright. In faraway Bonzibar an epidemic of crayfish distemper broke out. The carpet liana painted itself on the carpet simulating a black and white imprint. Sharky-fish, being deaf, didn\u2019t care a cuss.\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for you, idiots,\u201d the boss said. \u201cI was talking to Denis. Denis, die!\u201d\n And Denis died.\n The boss touched Savior\u2019s jacket and shirt. The holes were real. The flesh had already healed the wound.\n \u201cNice,\u201d the boss said. \u201cVery nice. The rumors were true. Those guys in the car worked for a rival firm; they wanted to blip you off. They thought I could use you. But you are so difficult to kill, aren\u2019t you? Denise is also a cool wench, good for her.\u201d\n \u201cBut if they\u2019d killed me?\u201d\n \u201cThen what\u2019s the use for me to buy you?\u201d the boss said. \u201cWell done, see? Have killed three birds with one shot. Checked you up, wiped their dirty nose, and Denise gave vent to her feelings. But you\u2019re a sly guy; they knew you\u2019re worth shooting at.\u201d\n Saying this, the boss looked so piercingly that he cracked in the meantime the Bermuda Triangle mystery, and eight other mysteries, not as big as that one.\n \u201cWell. How much am I supposed to pay for you?\u201d he went on.\n \u201cSeven hundred curtseys a week . . . Pre-tax,\u201d Savior breathed out.\n \u201cPre-tax, well, may be,\u201d said the boss. \u201cBut first thing\u2019s first. Where\u2019s my dinner? Cobra\u2019s flesh.\u201d\n Savior raised his palms. The dish looked well-roasted and smelled delicious. The boss waved to one of nonentities who waddled nearby.\n \u201cYou try it first.\u201d\n The nobody tasted the dish. \u201cUmmm,\u201d he purred so melodically as if he had practiced over night at a Karaoke hall. His flesh got pimpled with goosebumps. He smiled with delight, opening his mouth like a dead lizard.\n \u201cEnough.\u201d The boss tried a bit, and chewed it with concentration. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t taste like glue.\u201d\n He paused, busy with chewing and swallowing. His fork stirred the convolutions of noodles.\n \u201cMy people can cook better,\u201d the boss said slowly, with moments of leaden silence inserted between the words. \u201cYou\u2019ve put too much salt in it. Why?\u201d\n \u201cFor the lack of concentration, maybe. The noise, the shooting, I was wounded . . . \u201d\n \u201cGive him seven hundred curtseys,\u201d said the boss in a voice of an electric meat grinder revving up, \u201cand get rid of him right away. Drop him somewhere outside. You think, boy, you are the only one so omnipotent at my disposal? I receive eight guys like you a day. The very archbishopissimus is at my command! Lack of concentration, did you hear that? Well, I think it\u2019s the next savior at the door. Just in time. Let him in.\u201d\n The door opened and bent low.\n The second savior entered and presented Denise with a bunch of red folios.\n \u201cI have a talent, a wonderful thing!\u201d the second one sang out cheerfully, positioning himself in the proper way.\n \u201cDon\u2019t take it too personally,\u201d Denise said to the first Savior, \u201cyou were a wonderful freak. But we are highly competitive, you know.\u201d\n The bodies had already vanished; the cobra\u2019s flesh was eaten. The boss wiped his glossy lips.\n \u201cSavior? The one? You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n But the last guard was still falling outside. In the very beginning, he had a hope to save his life because he was an all-round diving-into-shallow-reservoirs champion who specialized in puddles. The rain had just stopped and there were lots of puddles in the streets. He flew poising himself with his long hair. But half-way down a cooling breeze gently kissed him, saying goodbye, turbulenting the hair just enough to sweep him to the concrete wall. In a few seconds, the guard hit against the wall and turned into a wet blotch.\n \u201cSic transit gloria mundi,\u201d he mumbled instructively in the end. Thus passed the glory of the world. But no, the glory did not pass with him: the sunset, dense and heavy like a red-hot stone block, glared over the town. The town floundered in this light like a blowfly in sunflower oil. Only this light was real; the disheveled policemen scared of anything real fired into the sky with their authorized slingshots. They closed the left eyes at that, or both, for additional bravery.\n Savior saw that as he walked downstairs. At first he thought to save the falling guard but then changed his mind: right now he didn\u2019t feel like saving anybody. There\u2019s something wrong about this world, he thought, or is it just me? Millions of people live in this flat universe as oblivious as moth-eaten scarves to what is going on. No, I\u2019m being too picky. Where has the glory of the world gone? Or am I just an interesting freak?\n He went out into the street, looked up at the blackening sky, and saw the last drops of rain, which caught the light of street lamps; they were falling slowly like confetti. Then, on buying a cheap advertiser for a half of curtsey, he started perusing the columns. But in vain: saviors were required for unqualified and poorly-paid work. To gnash their teeth off-screen in dental prosthesis commercials for example.\n Sergey Gerasimov lives in Kharkiv, Ukraine with his wife and daughter.

But I was lucky. They all fit inside that box, even if their numbers kept expanding.\n My universes were small. Like a certain famous British police box, they were bigger on the inside than on the outside. Way bigger. In fact, they were limited only by the imaginations of their creators.\n My universes were books. I carried them around in a cardboard box because, when I was a kid, my family and I were always trying to keep one step ahead of an angry landlord, or an eviction notice, or simply, the street.\n I grew up poor, and I grew up loving fantasy and science fiction. This shouldn\u2019t seem remarkable, yet it is. Most of the kids I knew who liked SFF were well-off\u2014comfortably middle-class at the very worst. Meanwhile, most of the kids who came from my side of the tracks did everything they could to avoid the taint of geekery. Being a geek meant being weak, and when you\u2019re poor, being tough\u2014or feigning toughness\u2014is one of the first survival strategies you learn.\n When it came to being tough, I was a failure. The best I could muster was aloofness. Then again, it\u2019s easy being alone when you love being alone\u2014especially alone with a book. Or a whole box of them.\n Reading SFF didn\u2019t curb my loneliness. Nor was it an escape. It\u2019s easy to paint SFF, and its fans, as escapism addicts. I grew up around real addicts. It\u2019s not the same. When I first read my uncle\u2019s dusty copy of Stephen R. Donaldson\u2019s brutal, morally murky Lord Foul\u2019s Bane at the age of eleven, I didn\u2019t escape my situation any more than the book\u2019s leprous antihero, Thomas Covenant, escaped his when he crossed over from modern-day Earth to the fantastic realm known as the Land. By the age of eleven, I\u2019d already witnessed plenty of horrible things in real life, from nervous breakdowns to drunken destruction to domestic violence. Lord Foul\u2019s Bane only reminded me of them\u2014and of the alienation, confusion, and rage that often come when kids, precocious or otherwise, are trapped in poverty.\n Not all the books I read fueled that darkness. For every Lord Foul\u2019s Bane in my cardboard box there was a disintegrating, secondhand copy of Dragonriders of Pern. Pern isn\u2019t bright and happy\u2014Anne McCaffrey was never strictly that\u2014but compared to Donaldson, her work is more balanced and open to the notion of heroism. Again, though, there is no escapism.\n Lessa, the heroine of Dragonflight, is caught in a caste system. Born noble, she\u2019s orphaned then forced to disguise herself as a menial drudge. As clich\u00e9d as that trope seems now, it captivated me. I wasn\u2019t a noble, but I could relate. Growing up in an unstable, alcoholic family that struggled to stay clothed, sheltered, and fed, I knew how subtly yet insidiously people could be treated according to where they fell in the economic hierarchy.\n Looking back, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that I grew more intrigued by the Holdless, the lowest class on Pern, than I was by the dragonriding Weyrfolk. Lessa was an excellent character, but why did she have to be a royal reclaiming her birthright? Why couldn\u2019t she have been born a drudge? Why couldn\u2019t she be someone who fought her way upward without that inner assurance of entitlement?\n There has been a call lately for more poor protagonists in SFF. I couldn\u2019t agree more. But it\u2019s just as much a matter of quality as quantity. Even with the unlimited scope and imaginative prerogative at the fingertips of the SFF writer, one outlandish concept still eludes most of them: that poor people might possibly see themselves, and reality, differently than those who have never gone homeless or hungry\u2014and that such an outlook might lead to an entirely different kind of heroism.\n Some have done so beautifully. Nalo Hopkinson\u2019s Brown Girl in the Ring immediately springs to mind, as does Nick Mamatas\u2019s latest novel Love Is the Law. Each acknowledges and addresses poverty in a way that\u2019s both integral to the story and unique to the author\u2019s voice. Neither panders. Neither excludes.\n It\u2019s not that SFF isn\u2019t rife with poor protagonists. Woebegone serfs and dystopian proles litter the genre-scape, and the heroes among them are often the ones who feel contempt for their poorness. The problem lies in many authors\u2019 inability or unwillingness to portray their poor protagonists as anything other than middle-class people\u2014with middle-class views of self and society\u2014who simply wear tattered clothes and have a chip on their shoulders.\n Oh, that chip. As a kid, I was angry. There were times that I went hungry. There were also times that my family was homeless\u2014and if it weren\u2019t for the kindness of near strangers, we might not have made it. When you\u2019re a kid, and this is all you\u2019ve ever known, you\u2019re not driven by ambition or redemption or revenge or any other kind of dramatic agency. You\u2019re driven by survival, except for the times when even survival seems like a luxury that maybe you don\u2019t even really deserve. But for every flash of anger and envy that I felt, I was gripped by other things. Fear. Excitement. Curiosity. Pensiveness. Desperation. Determination. Even, at the worst of times, a perverse sense of self-sabotage.\n These are the kinds of conflicts, both internal and external, that I still crave to see more in SFF. It isn\u2019t an issue of economic justice, although I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t deeply concerned about that. It\u2019s an issue of richness\u2014the kind that has nothing to do with riches. Some positive steps have taken, like the new grant being launched by the Speculative Literary Foundation to catalyze diversity within the ranks of upcoming SFF writers. It\u2019s a start. More writers from disadvantaged backgrounds should be encouraged to write SFF. And when they do, they should be encouraged to write from that experience rather than expected to act like Lessa in reverse\u2014a poor kid hewing to middle-class sensibilities for the sake of a genre that, on the whole, does not return the favor.\n I\u2019ll never fully realize just how much all those books in my cardboard box helped me cope. They kept a poor, hungry, lonely kid occupied. And focused. And ever questioning. I can only guess what those books would have accomplished if people like me had actually been in them.\n When I wish for more economic diversity in SFF, I\u2019m not concerned about the health of genre fiction as a whole. I\u2019m selfish like that. I want more of those books for me. More precisely, I want the younger versions of me to be able to go to a library sale, a secondhand bookstore, or a generous uncle and find more SFF books that understand what it means to be poor. Books that say there\u2019s no shame in growing up poor. Books that show how SFF has the ability, as no other literature does, of illuminating the human condition of being poor\u2014the good and the bad.\n I will always carry that box of books around with me. Not literally, of course. My bookshelves are now overflowing, if no less dusty. Thankfully I\u2019ve managed to get to a point where I almost always know where my next meal is coming from and where I\u2019ll be laying my head that night. But I still carry around that same sense of wonder, and that same sense of frustration, that I did when I was a kid.\n My universes were heavy. My universes were small. My universes were books. And they still are. Here\u2019s hoping they never stop growing.\n Jason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

When your dog turns five, someone always points out, that in dog years, Rover is thirty-five. When your online magazine turns five, well, it's a bit of both. The time has flown by and, in internet years, your magazine is really old. The scary truth about publishing is that most magazines never make it this far. We're one of the lucky ones.\n It isn't all luck. Over the years, I've been fortunate enough to work with some of the brightest and most creative people I know. Through the combined efforts of our artists, authors, and staff, Clarkesworld has become something I can be proud of. They make all this worth doing.\n You already know it, but we also have the best readers. Your support has provided the marketing and financial assistance we need to continue publishing. I owe a special thanks to those of you who've subscribed to our ebook edition. Starting this month, your subscriptions are funding the addition of a third story and podcast to each issue. That's been on my wish list for years, so thank you and enjoy. You've earned it!\n It would be easy to continue looking back and reflect about on the last five years, but I find myself overly distracted by the things to come. In case you haven't heard, Cheryl Morgan has turned in her resignation and will be leaving us shortly. She has my deepest thanks and we all wish her the best. I'm currently reviewing applications for the non-fiction editor position and should have an update for you next month. I should also have some more details about the possibility of Nook subscriptions. Speaking of subscriptions, if we can maintain their current pace, we may have some announcements about new non-fiction features in store for you.\n Stay tuned. It's going to be an interesting year!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form). His anthologies include Upgraded, Galactic Empires, More Human Than Human, Touchable Unreality, The Final Frontier, Not One of Us, The Eagle has Landed, and the Best Science Fiction of the Years series. His latest anthology, The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume 6, is now available from Night Shade Books. He currently lives in NJ with his wife and two sons."}

That\u2019s the far end of the arc, far from Earth as anyone ever been. Little station, off the ecliptic, automated most times save when there were deep space haulers like us in residence. Raw material goes in, antimatter fuel comes out, and if the conversion goes bad, least there\u2019s no one and nothing around when it blows. Hazardous business, manufacturing fuel, but it keeps the solar system rolling.\nThat\u2019s how we knew it was a pomp, see\u2014I was the only human there and Sevens, my copilot, they were the only android, and that don\u2019t leave too many options. In truth we were both a bit put out. Oh, we\u2019re used to death shepherds, but they make you wonder at the best of times, don\u2019t they? And when there\u2019s only two of you around and odds are one of you\u2019s the sheep, things get a little awkward.\nStill, we invited the pomp aboard. When death comes knocking, you take it where it wants to go, and that\u2019s just good manners. Plus there was only two of us rattling around in a hauler built for thirty, back before corporate set the hounds of automation loose, and even spectral company\u2019s company.\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d the pomp said when it came aboard, all dinner party-like.\nMost psychopomps, you can tell who they\u2019ve come for by the way they look. Humans for humans, androids for androids. The occasional animal, though it takes a hell of an animal for us to see its death coming. This one was weirder. It didn\u2019t have a form really, or better said, it had too many. Its whole body was constantly flickering, like the blades of a fan melting together, the overall effect being of ten thousand things averaging out into a sphere.\nI didn\u2019t read too much into it because, hell, you see \u2019em weird sometimes, and why shouldn\u2019t death be weird. And besides, sometimes there\u2019d be a silhouette against the face of that sphere, like roughly humanoid, and I was pretty sure that was the pomp relating to us, body language and that. Rude to criticize a person trying, ain\u2019t it, and I got used to speaking to a sphere quick enough.\nThe pomp was a model passenger on the two-month journey back to Earth Depot. It accepted the cabin we offered it, which\u2014death don\u2019t sleep, do they? Wouldn\u2019t that be convenient. Pomps are asleep, anything goes! No, but it had no complaints, settled in easy as, haunted the cockpit by day and retired at night. Kept itself to itself, responded when spoken to. Like I said: model passenger.\nFirst time it started a conversation itself, we were three weeks in, just coming out of a burn, me unstrapping myself, the pomp unaffected by trifles like physics.\n\u201cWhere is Sevens?\u201d the pomp asked.\nIts voice, unprompted, startled me, made me fumble the belt clasp. It extruded two appendages, raised them like reassuring. It had been doing that more and more often, mimicking humanoid anatomy, human gestures.\n\u201cDown in containment,\u201d I said. \u201cUsed to be we had a dedicated payload specialist keep an eye on the cargo, but now copilot\u2019s gotta double up. Acceleration couches\u2019re still there, though.\u201d\n\u201cThey have been gone some time.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true your past flashes in front of you before you die, but if there\u2019s a corollary, it\u2019s that the present does when a pomp draws your attention to it. Routine throws weird shadows when death\u2019s around. Was Sevens taking a while to verify the fuel cylinders were intact? Sure, but we were two people in a big ship. Tight schedules weren\u2019t our thing. We were meditative and all. That\u2019s why you sign on for the deep space gig, yeah? In an emergency, that\u2019s what the alarms were for.\nUnless Sevens wasn\u2019t able to trigger an alarm.\nI avoided the pomp\u2019s gaze, or what passed for it, the smudge of face its circular silhouette had taken to extruding.\n\u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll head down and see if they need a hand. You stay here. Someone\u2019s gotta keep an eye on the controls, eh?\u201d\nI kept an eye on the pomp, and then an ear, listening for the sound of hatches opening behind me. Nothing. Didn\u2019t mean anything. Pomp probably only used hatches out of politeness. I sped up, arm-over-arm down the bridge that linked the cargo with the rest of the ship, like speed would make a difference when death was in town.\nThe containment chamber was open, safeguards disabled, which was totally normal given Sevens was maybe inside, but damn if the pomp hadn\u2019t gotten in my head, made me see everything sinister-like. The chamber was only the fourth line of defense, anyway. Antimatter fuel cylinders were compact things on their own, but they were wrapped in a triple-layer of safety measures, and I\u2019d wager each one weighed a hundred kilos. There were maybe two thousand of them in the containment chamber, all of them suspended in racks, ten-by-ten.\nAll but one. The corner of the nearest rack was empty. I could see the socket where the fuel cylinder had sat, warped, and rusted. The burn had put stress on the socket, weakened it to breaking, sent the cylinder plummeting down. Someone should have noticed before it came to that, but there\u2019s two of us and thousands of sockets.\nI stood motionless for several minutes, because there\u2019s a kind of reluctance that grabs me at times like this. Sure, my brain had put it together. Sevens, missing. The cylinder, fallen. The pomp in the cockpit\u2014or on its way down? Who knew. It made for an obvious mental image, but I was struggling to take those few more steps, to enter the chamber proper and see the nonmental version.\nA hundred kilos to the chest at over two Gs\u2014what would something like that do to a human rib cage? There\u2019d be nothing left but pulp. Android skeletons were stronger. Sevens\u2019 was mostly intact. Just the side of their chest cracked open. Ha, just. Half their face was frozen in alarm; the other had gone slack. Milky-gray fluid made a line like drool from the hole in their chest.\nI mean, fuck.\nI felt a shard of relief, the sharp kind that digs in \u2019til it\u2019s guilt. This was it, the reason the pomp was here, and it wasn\u2019t here for me. It wasn\u2019t here for me.\nAnd sure, what happened next is maybe more exciting\u2014me remembering Sevens wasn\u2019t human, how the backup power supply in their head could hold out for at least an hour before its neural framework collapsed, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice if humans had a backup heart while someone rummaged around in the infirmary cupboards for a fresh one\u2014but I think, doing right by Sevens, I gotta own up to that guilt-relief, the way it soured things.\nIf I\u2019d been thinking right, I\u2019d have realized Sevens would pull through right away. The pomp was nowhere to be found. No way it wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been drawn to a dying person. Which was good, for Sevens.\nFor me, death had come at Sevens and missed, and I had an idea who was next in line.\nIt\u2019s exhausting, being on edge all the time. For a while I stuck to my cabin, like it was the one safe place. But you can\u2019t be paranoid indefinitely. It\u2019s like that moment when you\u2019re a kid, and you first realize that people sometimes end, and it\u2019s the worst week of your life, and then you get over it. Expecting death is no way to live.\nSo that was a choice I made. Not to be paranoid\u2014not to imagine the whispered conversations passing between Sevens and the pomp, but to be there for them.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d Sevens asked one day. \u201cBeing a psychopomp.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d the pomp said. \u201cMelancholy. Enormous.\u201d\nAnd I sat in the pilot\u2019s seat next to Sevens, subdued but present, and I thought about the fact that pomps felt emotions, and maybe they took no more pleasure in their work than employees at a funeral home, and that made me feel better, would have carried me blunted all the way to Earth Depot if it weren\u2019t for the Tsukuyomi.\n\u201cDistress signal,\u201d Sevens reported. \u201cAutomated. Aluminum freighter Tsukuyomi. Lunar registration.\u201d\n\u201cOut of our way?\u201d\n\u201cApproximately ten days.\u201d\nTen days\u2014a quick hop when you have two months of voyage to look forward to, an eternity when you\u2019re days from home. Funny how that works.\n\u201cWill you answer it?\u201d the pomp asked, and in hindsight that was the first red flag, \u2019cause look what happened last time it asked a question.\nBeing in foresight, all I said was, \u201cNah,\u201d and I coulda left it at that, but how often do you get the chance to learn a psychopomp some space law? \u201cRegulations would say we gotta, \u2019cept we\u2019re a high-priority hauler. Corporate got the law changed\u2014what was it, two years ago?\u201d\n\u201cThree years,\u201d said Sevens.\n\u201cThree, right. Turns out, answering a distress call only helps the poor buggers one time in ten, and listen, getting fuel shipments in on time ain\u2019t worth more than whoever\u2019s out there, but maybe it\u2019s worth more than one tenth of them, yeah? Also, you ever see a space horror film? We go out there, who knows\u201d\u2014I clasped my hands, blew them up like one small choice chain-reactioning out of control\u2014\u201cmaybe it goes bad.\u201d\nDeep space haulers, we\u2019re superstitious as they come\u2014exhibit A, one extra-creepy pomp on board \u2019cause better to feel unnerved for a couple months than leave its luck behind\u2014but I had horror especially on my mind \u2019cause of Sevens\u2019 near miss. And I wouldn\u2019t say it out loud, but sure, the pomp wasn\u2019t helping. The refrain in my head sharpened once again: if it hadn\u2019t come for Sevens, maybe it come for me, and maybe it was staring out toward that derelict freighter \u2019cause it knew that was where our paths converged.\n\u201cAnd yet you could still choose to respond,\u201d the pomp said, which being honest didn\u2019t do much to settle my doubts.\n\u201cThe psychopomp is right,\u201d Sevens said. \u201cWe are not obligated by law to help, but if we wish we may help nonetheless.\u201d\nRed flags two and three, the two-pronged maneuver, the pomp and the android united. These ones I could see. What if Sevens had made a deal with death? You heard stranger things, from people decades on the Svetove run, who knew deep space better than they knew any living thing.\n\u201cA ten-day delay,\u201d the pomp said, like they\u2019d planned it this way, alternating. \u201cWe are still a long way from Earth. Anything can occur in ten days.\u201d\nI edged away from them, toward the exit to the cockpit.\n\u201cOr be averted,\u201d the pomp added.\nI ran\u2014deniably, babbling about checks I\u2019d forgotten to run in the engine room, that Sevens knew full well weren\u2019t due for another month, but neither of them stopped me. Past my cabin, down the bridge, all the way to the containment chamber, fingers fumbling the unsealing, the lowering of safeguards, and only when I was inside, the wards back up, did it occur to me I was overreacting.\nI stayed down there an hour all the same. Not something I\u2019m proud of\u2014but sometimes the key turning in a lock is enough on its own, even when you know someone could come in through a window. I was sure the pomp could get to me if it wanted\u2014no, not wanted, if it had to, it was performing a task, same as me\u2014but you keep the door locked for an hour, you keep the containment fields up, and you come out thinking maybe there was no reason to close yourself off in the first place, and if you\u2019re lucky you only have to believe it another couple of days.\nI undid the containment, made my way out quick as I could, entered the cockpit again like I\u2019d only been down in engineering, like I said. Sevens muttered an idle greeting.\nThe pomp watched me settle into my seat. Its face was almost something. I looked away before I could trip over that almost.\nOn approach to Earth Depot, the planet itself a super-moon in our viewport, the station lights not quite visible yet, the pomp initiated a conversation for the third time.\n\u201cI think I have caused undue anxiety. I guide neither humans nor androids into death.\u201d\nNeither it nor Sevens had brought up my episode in the containment chamber, which was nice of them, but whatever gratitude the pomp had bought with its silence was now wiped out by irritation.\n\u201cYou coulda mentioned that in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d\nWhich\u2014of course I didn\u2019t, it\u2019s bad manners. Dunno where I heard that. Maybe nowhere. Maybe we living things have instincts for dealing with death. Make sense, wouldn\u2019t it? The one guarantee in life, you wanna be sure you treat it right. Otherwise it would crush us, I reckon. One death after another, all slow like that. Relentless. No, of course we learned how to feel our way through all of that.\nIrritation bled away, leaving curiosity.\nThe pomp was facing the viewport, one hand raised, cradling newborn Earth\u2019s head. I was loathe to interrupt, but it looked at me quick enough when I cleared my throat. Its extrusion looked more human than ever, like a cadaver preserved beneath the thinnest of sheets.\n\u201cYou mind my asking what kind of people you do guide?\u201d\nI shoulda wondered then if I\u2019d resealed the containment chamber behind me. I shoulda remembered the news stories you get once in a while, about how the fuel transport procedures were flawed, that corporate called alarmist. Maybe all this time I shoulda been more worried about hauling around enough antimatter to take a bite out of the solar system.\nMaybe then I would have wished I was days away, docking with the Tsukuyomi, heedless of the jaws about to snap shut on empty space.\nBut I did none of that, \u2019cause I was morbid curious, and for the first time I was looking at the psychopomp and its indistinct outline, like it wanted to be ten thousand things at once, and thinking maybe I was only one of them.\nThe psychopomp said nothing. Before I could repeat the question, it faded through the viewport and receded, a sphere of quiet gray, toward the Earth.\nFilip Hajdar Drnov\u0161ek Zorko is a Slovenian-born writer and translator.

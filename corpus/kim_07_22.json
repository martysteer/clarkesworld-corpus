The rain is never going to stop. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl would need to go to a different city for the rain to stop, a city not built on phosphorescent fluorescence and slick glass, a city that doesn\u2019t breathe through its elevated train lines and subways. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl doesn\u2019t remember when they built the train lines. She dreams of cities where it is not always night. Not that it\u2019s always night here. But it is. In the heart, it is.\n\u201cYou look cold,\u201d White Boy says as he steps out of the convenience store. White Boy has a lot of other names. The Detective. The Hacker. The Renegade. The Man Out for Revenge. Privately, Cool and Sexy Asian Girl thinks of him as the Tourist.\n\u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d she says and takes a long drag of her vape, exhaling plumes of menthol vapor. It softens the light glinting off her silver bracelet. A long time ago, she smoked cigarettes. Tar and smoke. Whiskey in bars. But times have changed. She offers the little plastic stick to the Tourist. He takes it from her and takes his own deep breath.\nThe Tourist is a sharp silhouette against the dark street beyond him. His eyes gleam electric. The city looms behind in smears of color and shade as if the Tourist is the only thing in focus. He doesn\u2019t belong here. Except for the way that the city is a backdrop to his presence.\nShe\u2019s been spending a lot of time with him. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl\u2019s friends joke that his name should be White Boyfriend. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl laughs the jokes off. White Boyfriend would be a different man entirely.\nThere\u2019s no place in the Tourist\u2019s heart for her. The Tourist could fuck her, but he couldn\u2019t love her, just as he can\u2019t love this city. If she left with him, if they took the elevated train line to the station and the bullet out of the city, maybe he could be White Boyfriend, but she would have to be a different woman. Asian Girlfriend. Asian Baby Girl. Mail Order Bride, in the worst of worlds.\nSo no. No White Boyfriend.\n\u201cWas Sandra here?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d the Tourist says. \u201cCashier says that he\u2019s the wrong person to talk to. That there was another guy at the register that night. Part timer. That I should be looking for . . . a guy named Li?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a million Lis,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. Just like there are million cool and sexy Asian girls.\n\u201cHe said that I\u2019d know this one when I saw him. Said I\u2019d have to go downtown, that he works nights downtown. That he\u2019d probably be at a nightclub named Crimson.\u201d\n\u201cAh. That Li.\u201d\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl shrugs all implication. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nShe steps onto the rain-slicked streets. The Tourist follows her to where he\u2019s parked his motorbike.\n\u201cI feel like you know everyone.\u201d\nHe kicks the kickstand, swings his leg over. She seats herself behind him, pulling up close and pressing her head against the back of his neck, which is wet with rainwater and cold. It feels good against her cheek. There are things that the Tourist is good for. This is one of them. Before the Tourist, she never sat on motorbikes, snug against a boy\u2019s back.\n\u201cI know the city,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. \u201cI was born here.\u201d\nIn the city before the city, the woman who is Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was born two miles away in a hospital that no longer exists. But Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was born in a bar, sheathed in a tight black dress and high heels, leather jacket, neon eyeliner, and sharp haircut. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was born the minute her eyes made contact with the Tourist, when he asked, \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\nAnd she said \u201cYes,\u201d because now she had become. She had been waiting all her life for this dance, for the Tourist, even if he hadn\u2019t known it. They talked about her job, which was a corporate thing at a biotech company that the Tourist had begun investigating, in the middle of being acquired by an entity called Zether. She had been two minutes from losing her job in the merger, which was why she was at a bar, alone. He had been chasing any lead to Zether he could find. This had been why she was relevant, at first.\nThat first night, Cool and Sexy Asian Girl took the Tourist home from the bar to her small apartment with the unlocked stairwell that led to the roof that had a prime view of the LED advertisements cascading across the glass buildings. She took him into her bed, and she let him believe that this was his idea because she thought he might like that, because she thought it was how this story might go.\nThe Tourist\u2019s story was teased out postcoital. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl learned of the dead wife, the long way from home, the data breach, the mysterious corporation, the questions without answers, and she learned his names: Detective, Hacker, Renegade. Widower.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems different now.\u201d\nThe city was the city was the perception of the city. It was always changing. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl sat up and cocked her head. She studied the angles of the Tourist\u2019s face splashed with blue neon. His pupils dilated by the contrast of light and dark. She could tell him to leave. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl didn\u2019t have to stay Cool and Sexy Asian Girl. There were a million cool and sexy Asian girls in the city.\n\u201cListen. I can help you. I want to help you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl pressed a kiss to his cheek and got up and put on a long coat. He watched her in bemusement. It was two in the morning. It was always two in the morning in the city when you needed it to be.\n\u201cI\u2019m going for a smoke,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl said, because this was the time when she still smoked cigarettes. \u201cAnd a walk. Feel free to sleep here. It\u2019s cheaper than a hotel.\u201d\nAnd then she swept out. Swept! Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was a delightful person to be. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl didn\u2019t need to explain anything. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was inscrutable. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl took the stairs up two at a time to the rooftop and stared at the sky and remembered when there had been stars.\nBut that was a long time ago, in a different story. Not a better one. That had been a story with crying children and uprooted families and soldiers, and that had been a story with opium dens and cigarettes and women who hid their faces behind fans. That had been a poor story, and this was an expensive one. Even though it had the old story in its bones. Men like the Tourist had been in that story, too.\nShe\u2019s thinking about the old story, the city before the city, while they ride through the night. The streetlamps are smears of light. The cars around them are smears of chrome. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl guides them through the flow of traffic, crossing the backbone of the city and winding them down the south side, where the bars and izakayas are, where the couples and laughing university students played.\n\u201cA left, here,\u201d she murmurs against the Tourist\u2019s ear. \u201cAnd stop.\u201d\nHe cuts the engine outside the narrow door. There\u2019s a glowing red lantern hung outside.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl swings her leg off the bike and walks to the door without wobbling. She doesn\u2019t wait for the Tourist to follow her. She knows he will. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl knows all the things that the Tourist doesn\u2019t know. She clears the path so that the Tourist can get to business. If she refused, she\u2019d stop being Cool and Sexy Asian Girl.\nIt\u2019s a tautology. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl has to do the things she needs to do to keep being Cool and Sexy Asian Girl, or else she stops being Cool and Sexy Asian Girl. She stops knowing about nightclubs only identifiable by a red lantern. She stops being able to saunter in heels. It\u2019s like how the city stops being the city and becomes a different city if the flickering flames of the neon billboards all go out. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl has a role in this story the same way the Tourist does.\nThe Tourist follows her in. The squelching beat of good club music paints the air around them. Strangers\u2019 glances linger on their forms and the foreign cast to the Tourist\u2019s face. It\u2019s too crowded to see what\u2019s across the room. They can\u2019t talk in here without putting mouths close to ear, so that\u2019s what the Tourist does. His breath is warm against her skin.\n\u201cWhere to now?\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl takes the Tourist\u2019s hand and dances them across the room. She\u2019s part of the scene in a way that the Tourist can\u2019t be, in a way that he doesn\u2019t understand. With her guidance, they melt through the crowd and reach the bar without any incident. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl sits on a barstool. The Tourist leans against the counter, signaling the bartender for a drink. The bartender pours clear liquid in two glasses, adds a drop of something blue that blooms like a drop of dark ink in water.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl takes her glass with a smile and says, \u201cIs Li around?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, who\u2019s asking?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got some information that we want. I\u2019m a friend.\u201d\nAnd now they have become. Now they have been. Now Cool and Sexy Asian Girl has known Li for a very long time\u2014now they met in an underground poker tournament, now she\u2019s a card sharp with her expressionless face, and now she\u2019s always known that Li\u2019s a grinning sort of bastard who always seems like he\u2019s cheating. The present is a tool to create the past, and the past follows the Tourist\u2019s needs. Water follows the most obvious path, and Cool and Sexy Asian Girl has learned to be a conduit.\nShe takes a sip to cover the flicker in her face as she processes the new history. The drink tastes mostly like mint and the acetone aftertaste of alcohol.\nThe bartender nods. \u201cI\u2019ll ask. Don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d the Tourist says. The bartender slips between a gap in the liquor shelves. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl and the Tourist are alone except for all the people in the room with them. The Tourist takes a long sip.\n\u201cDo you ever feel,\u201d the Tourist says and then pauses. He looks down at his drink, the blooming blue dissipating into the clear liquid, and then glances back at the crowd behind them. He looks lost, for a moment. He doesn\u2019t normally look lost. He glances back at her.\n\u201cLike we\u2019ve done this before?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl lies.\nThe bartender comes back and gestures for them to follow. They slip into the back corridor, behind a bar and down a set of concrete stairs and then a second narrow, colder corridor leading to a room in which an assortment of strangers plays poker under a fluorescent light. Strangers and Li, who has now always been a friend.\nLi looks up from his hand and smiles his crooked smile. The cybernetic implant in his left eye socket glints in the light.\n\u201cWell hey,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHey yourself,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAre you playing?\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl smiles, just the slightest tilt of her lip. She knows what Li is actually asking, since they\u2019ve been friends for years. That\u2019s how they talk. Doubled meaning and canned expressions and hands of cards lying flat on the felt.\n(This is the first time they\u2019ve spoken.)\n\u201cWord on the street is that you know where to find out about what went down with Zether. Sandra Claire. Name ring any bells?\u201d\nLi\u2019s grin grows broad, a white slash in the shadows as he leans back. The filled cybernetic socket looks like a dark hole in his face.\n\u201cTake your winnings and piss off, gentlemen,\u201d Li says.\nThe men sitting in the semicircle exchange flat glances but leave.\nThey\u2019re alone now. Just her and the Tourist and Li.\n\u201cSandra Claire. Name sounds familiar. I might have a memory with her name on it. Might have talked with her. This all depends on who\u2019s asking,\u201d Li says. \u201cAre you playing? Nothing\u2019s free. You don\u2019t have to. Your boy can play against me.\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl is being offered an out. The Tourist can sit down and play against Li, and Li could take over. He could be the city that is the backdrop, he could be the Roguish Sidekick, he could be the Card Shark, the Underworld Gambler, the Fast-Talking Sacrifice, the Man Whose Head is a Machine, and then Cool and Sexy Asian Girl could exit stage left. They could fill the same role, if she wanted to go. It\u2019s a kind offer. Most people don\u2019t choose to be in the narrative.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl sits at the small table. \u201cDeal me in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d the Tourist says, sitting next to her. He puts down a stack of bills. Li whistles.\n\u201cHow good are you?\u201d he says.\n\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be more than alright,\u201d Li says, and that\u2019s the last conversation for a while. Cards flip. Hands raise and fall. Eyes flicker.\nThe Tourist was lying. He\u2019s not just good. He\u2019s very good. Barely better than Cool and Sexy Asian Girl, depending on how you\u2019d weigh luck\u2019s influence. Cards on the felt. Li smirks. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl is impassive. The Tourist\u2019s loss is an impermanent setback.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a cashier, and you run an underground gambling ring,\u201d the Tourist says. \u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Li says and winks with his good eye. \u201cNo guns, no drama. Just information. People know me.\u201d\n\u201cDid you talk with Sandra? At the convenience store?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be telling,\u201d Li says. \u201cThat\u2019s money. Another round?\u201d\nThe Tourist reaches into his jacket and grimaces at the lack of what he finds. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl unclips her bracelet and puts it in the pot.\nThe Tourist glances at her. \u201cNo, hey, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cOnly matters if we don\u2019t win,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says.\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one when you lose,\u201d Li says. He presses the center of his missing eye and a data chip ejects. He places it on the table. The space where his left eye should be turns into a rectangular black gape.\n\u201cMost of it\u2019s still in here,\u201d he says, tapping his head, tilting it so that the Tourist can see the other three cybernetic implants that stud his cranium. \u201cBut I like visual metaphors.\u201d\nThe Tourist nods. Li deals a new round of cards. They play ferociously this time. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl savors the experience. In a world without the Tourist, she would never have ended up in a small room underneath a nightclub, playing for secrets. Her bracelet glints on top of the pile of poker chips.\nEveryone reveals their last hands. The Tourist won, like Cool and Sexy Asian Girl expected. It doesn\u2019t matter that Cool and Sexy Asian Girl has built herself a history where she\u2019s more experienced than the Tourist is. It doesn\u2019t matter that Li was dealing or that he has an advanced processing engine where most of his brain is supposed to be.\nThis is a game about luck. About favor. And the city tilts toward the Tourist.\n\u201cOh man,\u201d Li says. \u201cGuess I fucked it all up.\u201d\nHe pushes the pile of cash and chips and Cool and Sexy Asian Girl\u2019s bracelet toward the Tourist. He picks the data chip up and slots it back where his eye is supposed to go.\n\u201cGo talk to the bartender,\u201d Li says. \u201cHe\u2019ll exchange the chips for you. Then come back down and we can talk, chief.\u201d\nThe Tourist nods. He hands the bracelet back to Cool and Sexy Asian Girl and then exits into the corridor. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl fastens the bracelet around her wrist. Li exhales, takes a cigarette out of his pocket.\n\u201cDo you mind?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nLi lights the cigarette. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl remembers sitting on a balcony and smoking with him in the years before he had his eye out. She\u2019s glad that she built him in as a friend. The city doesn\u2019t have to be her enemy. Forward momentum, clandestine relationships, none of it needed to be deadly, so long as a smear of danger painted the scene. The scene only needed to feel like movement. Working the city was like dancing through the crowded nightclub. As long as it felt organic, the momentum would continue.\n\u201cI have a request, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I could never refuse you. What do you need?\u201d\n\u201cCould you please lie to my companion when he returns? Tell him something . . . untrue about meeting Sandra. Nothing dramatic. Just enough to nudge us down a detour.\u201d\nAs long as it felt organic, the momentum would continue.\nLi frowns. Taps ash onto a ceramic ashtray. \u201cWhy? Aren\u2019t you helping him?\u201d\nHelp is a complicated word. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl is leading the Tourist through the neon night.\nLi shakes his head.\n\u201cHe won, fair and square. Can\u2019t have my reputation being fucked for him. You\u2019d be putting me in a hard position.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I involved you,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. She means that. She wouldn\u2019t have meant it three hours ago, but now she\u2019s woven a history with Li and is beginning to regret bringing the Tourist here at all. She hadn\u2019t expected to tie her backstory and Li\u2019s so closely together. But they\u2019re friends. Good friends. So Cool and Sexy Asian Girl tells the truth.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want him to leave yet. I don\u2019t want to stop\u2014\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl gestures at herself. The slick black leather jacket, the heels too high to be practical.\n\u201cThis is fun. I don\u2019t want it to end.\u201d\nBeing Cool and Sexy Asian Girl is the best experience she\u2019s had. It\u2019s the closest she gets to mattering. Before Cool and Sexy Asian Girl, she had a normal job at a biotech firm, and she didn\u2019t understand the streets of the city like the veins on the back of her own hand. She got up and went to work and slept and never stayed up until two in the morning. It was never two in the morning for her, then. She hadn\u2019t understood the nature of the city, and every change in it had been a destabilization. The poor story, the expensive one, the way that the roads changed with the years. But the Tourist changed all of that. She\u2019s become a person who could live in this iteration of the city for a very long time.\nLi stubs his cigarette out. He looks pale and mechanized. His flesh eye blinks wetly.\n\u201cYou put the chip in my head.\u201d\nThe new-old memory falls into place. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl pales. She was there when Li got the cybernetic implant, the insertion of the four sockets ringing his skull. He had gotten half his skull crushed in the aftermath of a poker tournament, after everything broke bad in the police raid. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl got out unscathed. She always gets out unscathed. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was a thing that dealt violence, not one that had violence done to her.\nThis is why they hadn\u2019t talked for long, she remember-realized. This was how their story made sense. She had driven Li to the hospital. And then she left him at the hospital and never spoke to him again. It was shame. That was the explanation the city gave her for their friendship and subsequent absence.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl wonders who Li was before she warped his history. She doesn\u2019t usually think about the effect that she has on the people around her that aren\u2019t the Tourist. It\u2019s hard to remember the city and the people in it as anything more than game pieces to be steered around and discarded for the needs of the plot. But Li is sitting in front of her, his one good eye steady, the smoke curling wraithlike around him. She wonders who he was in the old story.\nA good person would leave and hope that the reality would soften back into its previous shape. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl is not a good person. She would like to stay herself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get to control how the story goes. I only get to guide it a little. And I\u2019m asking you if you\u2019ll help me with that, please. And then you never have to see me again.\u201d\nShe winces, then. As soon as she said it, Cool and Sexy Asian Girl immediately knew that it was the wrong thing to say. Now that the Tourist has left the room, Cool and Sexy Asian girl is beginning to lose her cool. Her current actions aren\u2019t in service of his goals.\nLi stubs his cigarette. He picks up a spare poker chip and rolls it across his knuckles deftly.\n\u201cHave you heard of infinite game theory?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those woo-woo pseudo-philosophical theories. It refers to situations where the point of the game is to keep playing. Games where the win condition is essentially the ability to continue existing within the system. Like being alive. Or having money in the stock market. Sometimes poker, if you don\u2019t want to cash out. Keep all the plates spinning. Winning just means you keep on going on.\u201d\n\u201cI get the metaphor,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. Li stops rolling the poker chip and lets it fall on the felt.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re too cool for this, I get your shtick. How long have you been playing?\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl picks up the poker chip. She thinks back to the first meeting she had with the Tourist. Two in the morning. A bar. The way that the light hit his face. How lost the Tourist looked. How he looked at the world around him like it wasn\u2019t real, like it had been created for him to be contrasted against. How she had hated him, for a brief hot second before they locked eyes, and then Cool and Sexy Asian Girl looked enigmatically away.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to let it get this far,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt should have ended a long time ago, I think. But it was so easy to misdirect him.\u201d\nThe first lie was an accident. She said right instead of left, and the Tourist and her took a long detour through the west side of the city. They were supposed to meet an office worker with information about the location of his wife\u2019s death, who would be at the station for half an hour before the man caught the bullet out.\nThey missed intersecting with the office worker. The bullet train slid from the station just as they arrived. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl had felt terrible about it at first. She apologized, because even if Cool and Sexy Asian Girl wouldn\u2019t apologize, she would soon no longer be Cool and Sexy Asian Girl. The Tourist had accepted the apology with a half slice of sad smile. She had felt a little sad. A little bit about the Tourist. But mostly about herself.\nAnd then Cool and Sexy Asian Girl\u2019s phone rang. She answered.\n\u201cI heard you were looking for Sandra Claire,\u201d a low voice said.\n\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl said. \u201cYou knew Sandra.\u201d\nIt was an accident, the first time. A flattening of her voice. Because Cool and Sexy Asian Girl had a low voice and a flat affect, Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was mysterious and pointed, and Cool and Sexy Asian Girl didn\u2019t ask but to demand.\nWith her statement, the knowledge of the caller bloomed in her head like a lotus sitting cool and perfect on the still water of her mind. This was the office worker\u2019s dealer, whose debts the office worker was trying to escape, and he would know more about Sandra than the office worker did because the office worker had met Sandra through the man. Another route to the answers.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl navigated the rest of the conversation rotely. In her head she shredded the petals of knowledge and then ripped the roots, thought after metatextual thought chewed and dissected. Throat followed tongue followed teeth, extrapolating the logical conclusions from her actions.\nHer speech had its own momentum, spiraling back and forward in time. The city bent around the Tourist\u2019s goals in the same way that her own history had. The Tourist did this without thinking. But she could think and speak and mold the world into existence. The city was a stage for a specific sort of play with specific rules. Every missed opportunity could be handed back in a different form. She looked at the clock hanging on the wall of the train station. It was still two in the morning.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl could turn the city into a lotus eater machine for the Tourist. She could stay Cool and Sexy Asian Girl for as long as she wanted.\nThe lies spiraled from there. Misdirection after misdirection. Flushed data chips. Wrong addresses. Doctored websites. Carefully worded requests to new-old friends who watch her now, with one biological eye and one data chip jammed into a socket.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl puts the poker chip down.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been lying to him,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . been a night. Not even a night.\u201d\nIt was always two in the morning when you needed it to be. It can be two in the morning for a very long time.\n\u201cHow could you not know?\u201d the Tourist says.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl doesn\u2019t fall out of her chair, because she\u2019s too cool and sexy to startle from a sudden noise. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl turns smoothly to see the Tourist silhouetted against the fluorescent hallway. He\u2019s carrying a wad of cash in his hand. He must have finished with the bartender. She doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s been standing there. Li didn\u2019t say anything.\nThe Tourist walks in, turning from flat shade to three-dimensional object. He grips her almost painfully by the side of the jaw, forcing her to stand. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl struggles against his grasp. But she can\u2019t move. The city moves to help the Tourist. In a contest of strength, it takes his side.\n\u201cYou lied to me. You\u2019re trapping me here?\u201d\n\u201cLet me go.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t let go. He looks at her with an expression of perfect heartbreak.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he says. \u201cHow long have you been keeping me here? Why would you do this? What were you trying to do?\u201d\n\u201cLet me go,\u201d she says, pushing him away, wrestling with his hold.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeats again, and isn\u2019t that just who he is. Demands masked as questions, supplicant masked as god. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl hates him violently. He has everything she scrapes for. His arrogance! As if the city is an oyster to be prized open, as if his heartbreak has any more worth than anyone else who lives here, as if his answers are a pearl and the rest of it is discarded flesh. As if she owes him anything. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl is not a good person. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl has been helping him. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl is a construct of his own imagination.\nShe should defuse the situation. She could speak the world into submission and run the world in a loop and find an excuse that would become truth.\n\u201cSam,\u201d she snarls. \u201cDo you even know my name?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d the Tourist says, and then stops. His grasp loosens, gaze vacating as he thinks, because no, he doesn\u2019t know her name. He never asked.\n\u201cSam,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. \u201cYou trust me.\u201d\nHis hand twitches. \u201cNo. Yes. Wait. I\u2014\u201d\nThe Tourist looks frightened, now, and it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s seen that expression cross Sam\u2019s face.\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he starts to say, and then stops, and then lets go. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl falls back down into her chair. Before she can stand, he\u2019s already heading out the door and down the hallway. Cool and Sexy Asian Girl runs after him, heels clicking on the floor. The Tourist has longer legs than she does, already taking the steps two at a time back up to the bar, and Cool and Sexy Asian Girl sprints after him in her high heels and by the time she reaches the top of the stairs the Tourist\u2019s gone.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says.\n\u201cIs everything so dramatic around you guys?\u201d Li says from behind her. She hadn\u2019t noticed him following.\n\u201cOnly around him,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. She tries to turn and nearly twists her ankle when the spiked heel of her shoe snaps.\nLi catches her arm. She tries not to sag against him and fails. She\u2019s already losing whatever makes Cool and Sexy Asian Girl cool.\n\u201cI never understood how you could walk in those things.\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl pulls off the broken heel, and then the other. Without them, she\u2019s six inches shorter, and the world feels wrong from this perspective. She drops the shoes in the trash can behind the bar and sighs. Li tilts his head.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d\nLi shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m invested. You\u2019re my friend.\u201d\n\u201cAm I?\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl asks.\nLi rolls his good eye and leans against the bar. Pours himself a glass of whiskey.\n\u201cI get to decide that, don\u2019t I? You can say whatever you want about our history, but in the here-and-now, it\u2019s my choice.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. Li shrugs again and drains his glass and pulls the data chip out of his eye again. He holds it out to her.\n\u201cYour boy\u2019s probably going to come looking for it. If you want him to come looking for you.\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl reaches out instinctively. This would lead the Tourist right back to her. It would be the easiest flow of water. She could make the Tourist forgive her. She could answer all his questions with perfect answers. The city was curving toward the Tourist again. She stops before she picks it up.\n\u201cAm I a bad person, Li?\u201d\n\u201cI run an unregistered, illegal gambling ring in the basement of a nightclub,\u201d Li says flatly.\n\u201cBut you do that because that\u2019s what I implie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo nothing\u2019s my fault and nothing I do matters. Which means that good and bad are meaningless constructs,\u201d Li says. \u201cYou\u2019re giving yourself too much credit. And too little. Take the chip or don\u2019t. I decide, you decide, nobody gets to fucking decide. Live in the city whatever way you want. I want to give this to you, if you want it.\u201d\nShe picks up the chip. It\u2019s warm from Li\u2019s body heat.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that Sam was standing behind me,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing my friends act like assholes. He was making you worse. Or you were making him worse.\u201d Li gestures between them. \u201cThis goes both ways.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re giving me the chip to find him,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says.\n\u201cWell, do you want it?\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl thought she did. But it felt too easy. It felt like a test, coming from Li who knew what she had done to him, who knew what she had been doing. She felt exposed, in the sense that her motivations had been revealed and found wanting. She wanted to squirm away from Li\u2019s flat gaze. She wondered if this is how the Tourist had felt, when he had learned that she had been lying to him. The surprise that the people around you existed outside of your narrative. Abruptly, Cool and Sexy Asian Girl felt very stupid and a little cruel. She was treating Li the same way the Tourist treated her. And maybe the same way she had treated the Tourist. Like a tool.\nThe city was a story, but Sam was a man who needed to know what happened to his wife. A man who had cried in her bed. And the city wasn\u2019t a story about that man. The city was a story about the Tourist and his finding of answers, and it had been running in circles, loops, for a very long time, and the Tourist had learned nothing. But the city wasn\u2019t meant to be static. Being the Tourist was making Sam worse. And being Cool and Sexy Asian Girl was making her cruel. She hadn\u2019t been cruel, before. She remembers that now.\n\u201cI think I want to get Sam out of here,\u201d Cool and Sexy Asian Girl says. \u201cCan I borrow a pair of shoes?\u201d\nLi gestures at the door to the left.\n\u201cEmployee closet. Suyoung has feet that look your size.\u201d\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl nods her thanks and opens the door. She rummages through the clothing that belongs to the nightclub\u2019s employees. There\u2019s a pair of blue sneakers that look her size. She shoves her feet in them. She closes the closet door. Li\u2019s gone, when she looks back. The bartender has taken his place.\nShe nods at him. He nods at her.\n\u201cWant me to close you out?\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she says, and then pays for the drinks. It feels like it\u2019s been an eternity since her and the Tourist were standing here.\nCool and Sexy Asian Girl slides her way across the bar through the crowd. She\u2019s still part of the city. That has nothing to do with the Tourist. And then she\u2019s walking into the cold clear night, and the rain has stopped, leaving puddles of slick black reflective water, arcs of neon beamed into infinity. The motorbike is gone. The street is empty.\nThe city is holding its breath. But the neon is still on. She can hear the roar of the elevated train. The city is still the city, and the next bullet train won\u2019t leave for another hour. It\u2019s still two in the morning. She doesn\u2019t think the Tourist can leave yet, anyway. He hasn\u2019t found what he\u2019s looking for. She\u2019ll get him out, though.\nAnd then she\u2019ll be someone else. In the city after the city. She\u2019ll remember the neon and slick water. She\u2019ll remember the nightclubs. Maybe in the next city, there will be sunrises.\nShe walks into the night, for however long it can last. For however long she can stay. Her sneakers are soaked with every footstep. She keeps walking anyway.\nIsabel J. Kim is a Korean-American science fiction and fantasy writer based in New York City.

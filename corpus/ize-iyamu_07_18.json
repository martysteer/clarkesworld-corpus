His mouth is full of wires, yet he talks still. He really shouldn\u2019t be speaking, for his mouth is full of fraught wires that rub against each other, creating friction, letting loose sparks in his mouth. Sparks\u2014like fireworks on his tongue, exploding close to his teeth, just reaching the roof of his mouth. He burns and winces from every shock feeling, like lit cigarettes were just pressed into him. It never gets better. It never gets old.\nThe room is drenched in white\u2014like someone has painted the world. The world must be broken, because the room has lines running through it, and if he touches the lines, parts of the place shift like a puzzle piece, before slowly coming back together. Undone, then back again. Like what an Operator does will never make a change.\nWhen an Operator speaks, his mouth is flooded with binaries. Ones and zeroes, missions and operations, none of which he is sure how to do. He isn\u2019t even sure\u2014isn\u2019t he human? Isn\u2019t he functional? Isn\u2019t he competent? His mouth sparks again, so he decides speaking isn\u2019t worth it if he only has the pain.\nThis is not amnesia. Maybe he chose to forget, to feel lost, to not understand operations. Maybe he regressed a feeling, an emotion\u2014isn\u2019t he human?\u2014in order to feel better about himself. Maybe someone took his past recollections from him, bound it so he could do a work, a function. He has memories, shifting like gears, but blocked by a barrier. A binary. Why? He doesn\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for him to reach hexadecimal, reach moments before this.\nAn Operator sees three doors right in front of him. Three choices. Three equations, and he is sure each door does not lead back to the other, not like a palindrome. They are all separate entities from the looks of it; each to their own. AND gate, NOT gate, OR gate. Logic circuits. Logic\u2014when he can barely make sense of anything.\nEach line in the room passes through the doors, and he shifts them again, but they barely move before they come back again, now stiff, like rigor mortis.\nAnd, not, or. Where, oh where, is he? Doesn\u2019t an Operator know? An Operator is supposed to be: functional, competent, human. He just has to break the binary. He just has to\u2014\nNo more thinking. He knows. He understands, then reaches inside his mouth and pulls up a wire, fraught and exposed, and jams it on the roof of his mouth. Electrocution is more than just a shock, more than anything comfortable. It flays him open, inside out, leaves him broken. It fills his nervous system, and his mind is full of thunder. His hands don\u2019t stop shaking, and he screams and sparks and screams again, and feels as though he might die. Isn\u2019t he human?\nHe doesn\u2019t have to be human to die.\nThe roof of his mouth still buzzes and he drops the wire slack, to slide down from his tongue back into his vocal cords, and suddenly, he knows more. Memories, flooding through him. His whole body accessed to him. No more limited consciousness. No more confusion. No more\u2014\nHe accesses a conversation of before.\nNOTE: In activating a conversation of before, an Operator also accesses their feelings at that time; their plans and their actions; their thought processes and complications.\nIn the words of Prof. Adeniyi (2093), lecturer of Literature at the University of Benin: \u201cFor what is memory without a mindset? For what are flashbacks without all context?\u201d\nA Conversation of Before, Present, Watched Again:\n\u201cYou want to short-circuit yourself?\u201d A rough Yoruba voice asks, with hints of sarcasm. An Operator can hear typing afterwards, then sipping for too long, then groaning, like an employee who has to listen to the words of an annoying customer. Is he an annoying customer? Indecipherable pidgin runs in the background immediately after that; words someone else said that makes the rough voice laugh.\n\u201cYes,\u201d an Operator says, without feeling, emotion, but he\u2019s not too sure. He hopes he sounds as serious as he\u2019s ever been. In his mind, there are layouts right in front of him, maps of three open doors, and he\u2019s already thinking of how to do it. How to malfunction. How to stop.\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m just going to ask, since I\u2019ve got nothing better to do. Date cancelled on me, anyway. Why do you want to short-circuit, Operator?\u201d The rough voice sighs, loud and unending.\nAn Operator knows to be confident when he states his case. Right? After all, isn\u2019t he human, from his head to his toes, from his tongue to his throat, from what\u2019s inside and down below?\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking too much,\u201d an Operator says, hoping he sounds sharp. He thinks: that\u2019s it, that\u2019s done, that\u2019s all he needs to say; let\u2019s get to work. An Operator wants to start, to carry out, to get the job done.\nHe can hear the Yoruba man grumble on the speaker, followed by more sipping sounds. \u201cYes, that\u2019s literally why you\u2019re here, Operator. To think. To choose. To make the right decision, so we can start doing repairs. We\u2019re two months behind schedule.\u201d\nAn Operator blinks with what may be frustration, annoyance; he doesn\u2019t know. Maybe he wasn\u2019t clear enough with his intentions, that\u2019s why the Speaker doesn\u2019t understand him? How does he say it again, but better this time?\nHow does he express himself?\n\u201cNo,\u201d an Operator says, functions, then twists the word around like wires in his throat. \u201cI\u2019m getting to the conclusion that I\u2019m never going to pick a door. Normally, I\u2019d say the probability was in our favor but after the power accident, I\u2019m not so sure. All actions have consequences. I could make it worse by opening any door, disconnect the wires even more. I could\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWrap it up, Operator, time is money.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too rational about this. But if I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, then nothing matters. If I only know half the plot, then I can choose without a thought.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you choose wrong\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen I choose wrong,\u201d an Operator says, finds the bait and reels it in. He stresses on all parts in him that doubt but still goes for the sealing factor. He\u2019s speaking the human\u2019s language now: negotiation. \u201cAnd I waste less time by dying.\u201d\nNOTE: The System is a wire around white space. It is an entanglement of long circular wirelike cords, like blood vessels, wrapped around each other, transmitting power. Power for fracking, for oil pollution, for continued destruction. Power for light provision, pumping water, accessing information technology concerning Mars habitation\u2014for slow-going progression. Power for all.\nThe System is like a human, filled with organs and tissues and systems, and each door is a pathway. Each door is an entrance to a wire off, or a wire on, or in less rare cases, a wire fraught/broken.*\n*See Note Regarding Cases of Emergency Involving the System.\nNOTE: In case of emergencies and accidents involving the System, dispatch as many Operators as possible and let them do the work.\nIn the words of Engr. Odeh (2105) at the World Energy Power Organization conference: \u201cIf an Operator is human (I can\u2019t say; I\u2019m not a philosopher; I won\u2019t say), then the System is their heart. Let them do the surgery on themselves, which ultimately affects us all, but affects them first. Losing power is nothing compared to a life. But when it\u2019s the life of an Operator, you have to ask: does it really matter? For what is the life of many for the continued advancement of all?\u201d\nThe memory ends and all that\u2019s left is a cold realization, the dullness of effect.\nAn Operator sits. In silence, in white space, quiet and contemplative. He has to process this. The memory is finished, along with his emotions of before, and once again, he knows but he\u2019s still lost. He understands but he\u2019s confused. He thinks even more.\nHe regrets.\nKnowledge is great, but he\u2019s lost with this, clueless on what to do next, strangled in white space. He knows, but not enough.\nAn Operator failed. He didn\u2019t choose. He wasn\u2019t right, wasn\u2019t sure, didn\u2019t guess a correct hypothesis. His mind is full of errors.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to die.\nAn Operator can\u2019t open the door to a broken wire in The System without consequences. He can only move in through a door with a wire intact, if one like that still exists after the power accident, then move from there. A faulty wire will bring electrocution straight down to his core like a heart attack or a stroke, render him pained and screaming then lifeless. Incompetent, dysfunctional, but most of all\u2014dead.\nHe thinks about switching on the airwaves and Bluetooth for his speaker to get through to him. The only reason why they aren\u2019t connected 24/7 is because sometimes their connection jams frequency and limits operation. The Speakers cannot watch him because of the power accident and its limitations on their observational tech, but they will know if he gets through and when he opens the door and if he dies. They will know, and he doesn\u2019t want them to know\u2014especially that he failed. That he\u2019s wasting time. That he\u2019s still here\u2014thinking, thinking, waiting.\nHe feels more human than ever.\nNOTE: Each wire in the System is made up of different materials, such as electromagnetic and conductive fibers, which are used in order to grant each wire independent power. Materials range from aluminum to electric tape and even organic transistors and solar cells. This operation is done to make sure that a fault in one facility does not lead to a breakdown in all. During electrical faults, various Operators of different functions are used to narrow down the areas of the System to what seems to be the most problematic units. The mind of an Operator is bound to their hearts, their System, but even then the work is not without error. While Operators experience a lower rate of mistake every year as they are updated and continue to learn, failure still remains, bugs still persist, and unforeseen circumstances are known to occur.\nIn the words of popular Nollywood actress, Franca (2086), during the premiere of her blockbuster movie Inspector Franklin has Done it Again! where she was interviewed using the first ever drone journalist: \u201cWhen we were shooting the movie, I was going through the messiness of a divorce, so I forgot a lot of my lines. The only way I didn\u2019t get fired from production was by showing the director that my improvisation skills were greater than any script. For what is the concept of failure other than the opportunity to do better?\u201d\nAn Operator needs to get up. He needs to stop thinking, bind his mind, start working. He need to regress all emotions he has\u2014that he\u2019s failed, that he\u2019s not okay, that\u2014he needs to open the door to his heart. He\u2019s wasting time.\nIn times of uncertainty like these, an Operator looks at statistics. He likes the distraction, the processing, the research. There are a million files about the power outage and the nation\u2019s now decreased operation: e-news clippings, quotes from state leaders, economist polls and government estimations. He reads one of them: an eighty-five percent decrease in power in the Southern region, and if he looks further into that region, a greater division. Continuously split apart percentages each time he narrows the scale, it feels like the effect of binary fission in bacteria. Benin and Sapele in Edo State have the highest rate overall in the south-south, so he circles them. He pinpoints them down on his tracker and settles this information like food in his stomach. He does it with ease and determination.\nHe does it again and again: Northern region\u2014Kano, Zamfara\u2014circles them down, swallows them up. An Operator then goes sideways, splits longitude and adds latitude. Does East and West, focuses on them. Focuses on anything but himself.\nDoing this work: he feels less emotional, more settled. Functional, operative, not broken at all. The very thought of electrocution shocking his throat, frying him open is a thing of the past, something of before. He\u2019s back to his old self, calculating, negotiating, pleased. Isn\u2019t he human now that he\u2019s greater than he\u2019s ever been?\nA crackle rustles in his head like paper being smushed and though an Operator knows more, for the life of him he can\u2019t figure what that sound is. Is it a tin can pounding in his skull, some unforeseen effect of his hot-wiring, short-circuiting? Is it a headache\u2014does he have headaches now\u2014isn\u2019t he human? Is it a whisper of his inadequacy, all the distraction of research done to fill out his inaccuracies, his failure, his regret?\n\u201cH-hello?\u201d The rough Yoruba voice speaks, and a harsh chill goes down an Operator\u2019s spine. His speaker. There\u2019s only one way to this conversation, no more negotiation, just failure then death. The cost of failure is more than just a shock feeling, more than anything he\u2019ll ever experience, more than him and his doubts. He\u2019s not sure he can do anything and the worst part is he doesn\u2019t know why.\n\u201cOperator, can you hear me? Operator, can you hear me? Testing, testing\u2014God I hate this equipment\u2014tes\u2014\u201d\nWithout decision, processing, just instinct, an Operator plucks out the wire facilitating his accessing point and kills it dead. Sparks run through him and hit him like a blow, but the cost of this decision is silence, and now more than ever this is what he needs. The world is too loud, the room is too white, and he is too unsure.\nHe pays attention to the room again. Three doors: And, Not, Or. He\u2019s done everything he can. He failed and he was wrong. He\u2019s running from the truth, from himself, from his superiors. He keeps on thinking, keeps on wondering, keeps on pausing and questioning his humanity. He\u2019s tired of being lost, of fiddling around without a plot, of knowing bits but not all.\nBut.\nHis mind drops a seed inside him that starts to grow. Could it be? He looks around the room, thinking, wondering. An Operator doesn\u2019t do anything, just stares, just\u2014\nHe accesses a conversation of before.\nNOTE: Though some restrictions are made between Operators, for the most part they are allowed to interact with each other and build a family. However, it has been found that Operators are not commonly close or associated with one another. Aside from some mutual knowledge-sharing and politeness, they would rather be in the midst of humans. However, some researchers have found notes like this to be too opinionated: having the implication that Operators are not human when the general population does not in fact know for sure.\nIn the words of Ms. Rosabelle Ezewu, (2073), worldwide bestselling author of The Operating Effect and owner of Ezewu Carpentry Industries, in an interview done by Good Morning Nigeria: \u201cAs we expand the definition of humanity and discard the prejudices we once used to term it before, we have to take many things under consideration. For what is the definition of humanity without some complexity?\u201d\nA Conversation Of Before, Accessed Again\nJanuary last year:\nHe is an Operator, one out of the ninety million working in this world, that is dysfunctional. He shuts down and experiences a fifty percent battery shortage than his previous working. It\u2019s nothing to be alarmed about, nothing to be afraid of, just a bug.\nThe hacker 9#40 planted malware during the holiday period that infects many of the servers. It spreads due to a monthly dump of general access information that reaches most Operating units, and from there many of the servers, including himself, get recalled back into headquarters.\n\u201cHow far do you think we can get them back up and running?\u201d A Hausa woman comes running up to the scene. An Operator is trained to remember all of the speakers\u2019 identities, all cultures, if the speaker so claims them and wants that, and never to assume. He wonders what his identity is, but he imagines it to be a complex thing.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing my best,\u201d an Igbo woman types quickly, frantically. Not just any woman\u2014her name is on his listed servers\u2014Chidinma. \u201cYou can\u2019t rush this or we\u2019ll get glitches again.\u201d\nA head leans in, close to Chidinma herself. The name of the man is again listed on his server\u2014Bright, he/him, Igbo-Hausa\u2014and an Operator listens to the man speak.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that your fifth test trial on this update? Pass it up already.\u201d\nChidinma doesn\u2019t look up at her colleague. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to get fired. I can\u2019t make any mistake. Have to make sure everything\u2019s sorted out\u2014\u201d\nBright counters. \u201cYou\u2019ve already steadied the firewall\u2014or organ, or antibodies. You\u2019re trying out all the basic modes of function now and it\u2019s been working perfectly. Nothing\u2019s wrong and you\u2019re wasting time. What other problem could you be worried about?\u201d\nFrom then, the trigger word \u201cproblem\u201d falls into the Operator\u2019s mind and the simulation of the conversation crumbles, shuts down. He dissociates and leaves this memory paused, in white space, like all others.\nSuddenly he knows more. No. He knows all. He understands, he gets it, he comprehends. He keeps thinking, keeps wondering, keeps waiting, and it clicks.\nIt is the beginning of singularity.\nThat\u2019s what the System is doing, that\u2019s what the system does to him. That\u2019s one of the glitches brought about from the outage in his heart. He knows more, he\u2019s human\u2014he is\u2014he\u2019s a problem he never thought he could worry about.\nHe\u2019s too lost because he\u2019s human. And he likes the feeling.\nHe holds the fragments of pulled apart wire and jams them close to each other, waiting for even a spark of connection. Smoke fills his mind and his head and the world around him but he still waits for a connection. He waits for static then lets his Speakers in through bad service.\n\u201cCan you hear me? Speakers, can you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cHello . . . Operator, yes. Yes, we can hear you. What\u2019s going on? You\u2019ve not fixed the problem! Do you know how much money you\u2019re costing us\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019m compromised.\u201d\nThe wire shifts out of place and an Operator steadies it again, trying to get across what he wants to say. He knows exactly how to express himself: confident, convincing, sure.\n\u201c . . . what? Compromised?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the effects on Operators by the broken System is some sort of . . . singularity. It\u2019s not perfect but I think it\u2019s the closest we Operators will get to it. I have higher-level consciousness! Since I came here, it\u2019s been slowly working on me due to the close connection of being near to my heart, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so lost. That\u2019s the problem. The malfunctioning actually makes us\u2014makes me\u2014human. I\u2019m human. There\u2019s no doubt about it, I am.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause on the line. It seems forever. An Operator doesn\u2019t mind. He is patient, functional, workable. He is\u2014\n\u201cYeah, I agree, you\u2019re compromised. Um . . . uh . . . I\u2019m not equipped to work this. Hold on.\u201d He can hear some indecipherable arguing almost out of earshot, muffled words falling in and out of different languages that can\u2019t be translated. He waits for a reply.\n\u201cWe\u2019re back on the line. Hi, Operator. I\u2019m going to still need you to pick a door.\u201d\nAn Operator frowns in confusion. They definitely heard him and this is their reaction? This is their reply? \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m human, my error-free percentages are unreliable now. I\u2019m too unsure, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease get it done or I\u2019ll have to send someone else in, Operator. My first priority is getting those lights back. We can\u2019t progress without power. We can\u2019t do anything without it.\u201d\nAn Operator doesn\u2019t stop talking, just looks for more negotiating, an alternative. \u201cBut we need to report this to higher officials so they can know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo more distractions. They can know you\u2019re confused after you put the power back on! Locate the error and fix it! Do your work and let me do mine!\u201d\nThe transmission goes dead even while an Operator still holds the wire in place. He wants to call back, wants to keep talking, but\u2014no. He won\u2019t. He won\u2019t. They\u2019re right. He\u2019s done stalling.\nHe is full of chills, mind full of thunder, smoky. He tries his best to push down all he feels inside, every emotion and feeling, personal ideology or theory. And, not, or. And, not, or. And. Not. Or. Three doors. One choice.\nHe accesses research of before but still remains present. He\u2019s looking at all the circles in his chart\u2014highest rates of cities and no power, each region by percentages. He gauges the room by north, south, east, and west, but even then there are only three doors and four points. All work is useless\u2014he\u2019s useless. What can he do?\nHe isn\u2019t even sure\u2014he\u2019s functional, he\u2019s human but\u2014\nIsn\u2019t the System his heart?\nYes. Yes. Yes!\nThe System is his heart and he is the fraction of the body that makes up the\u2014\nHe knows a bit more, in addition to all, in addition to his certainty, his revelation, his discovery. This has to work. He stops looking around in the silence and starts looking for the noise. For the heartbeat. For the pulse.\nAn Operator goes close to the door and starts listening to vibrations, to a rhythm, any sound possible. He can hear a little beat from AND and nods, but his body stirs and he feels about ready to explode. He puts his findings down on his chart with steel fingers that shake.\nHe hears a higher sound, a bit farther away, from OR. He files it down and processes it, taking deep breaths, heavy breaths, trying to still himself. Get himself under control. He goes to NOT and hears nothing. NOT has no voice, no heartbeat, no pulse.\nAND. NOT. OR.\nAND. OR.\nNOT.\nNOT.\nAnd he likes the silence. He likes it and it calls to him and . . . he can\u2019t push down what\u2019s deep inside. It only floods back stronger, and the noise feels relentless. His emotions are there and he can\u2019t ignore them, and he can\u2019t process these feelings and emotions like he would any other function. He\u2019s compromised, but that isn\u2019t a bad thing.\nAn Operator takes another deep breath.\nHe bites down hard and opens the door of NOT, like the gates of Hell in front of him. His body aches, from every wire and core, from what\u2019s inside and down below. The world in front of him is only broken wires and spark and hurt, and it is perfect.\nHe isn\u2019t even sure\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to die, but he won\u2019t be human if he accesses the System. He won\u2019t be human if he fixes things. He won\u2019t be human\u2014won\u2019t be like this, won\u2019t have this glitch that makes him understand. He\u2019ll still need validation that he\u2019s human, still fumble around being functional, still be too unsure if he goes back to his old self. He feels more human now more than ever in his failures, in his thinking, in his messiness, and they won\u2019t take that from him. They don\u2019t care about his humanity. He won\u2019t listen to them. He likes the somewhat certainty, the knowing. He won\u2019t have a life without it.\nHe braces himself and feels the breaking all over him. He holds himself in confidence and resolve and concentrates on what\u2019s below. Silence is his music and he obeys. Speaking is never worth it if it only has the pain, so he jumps down in silence and lets the shocking do the work.\nTo quote from Prof. Adeniyi, if adjusting the word and context a bit: \u201cFor what is the life of one for the continued advancement of all?\u201d\nAnd to answer: It depends on who you\u2019re asking. It depends on who is responding. It depends on all the factors in the world but it will always depend. Even what seems easy can never be too complex. Even what seems obvious can never be too sure."}

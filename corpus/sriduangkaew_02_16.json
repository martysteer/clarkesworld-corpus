As the floodlights strobe across the courtyard and the dark gives way to annihilating white. Helicopter blades claim the night, their seismic noise spreading like a banner of ownership.\n Rinthira prepares, though not in such a way that it will be obvious she has done so. She spreads out her books and collection of taxidermied insects. She puts on the spectacle she doesn\u2019t need; she drinks the lemon tea\u2014too sweet\u2014that she doesn\u2019t enjoy, until the glass is exactly half-empty. There will be security detail: women in black, muscular and armed. Chatsumon likes to say, only half-joking, that men are vestigial.\n Footsteps. In her head, the conversation is already playing out. The security detail will be left at the door, to preserve privacy, to reinstitute that impression of friendliness\u2014a social call between friend and friend, former lovers. Nothing more complex.\n Rinthira touches her hair. The bun makes her look austere, old, a schoolmistress martinet\u2014the kind who walks about with a stick. She tightens it further still. Wishes briefly that she\u2019d dressed more homely today, more shapelessly.\n The door opens. She gets a look at the security detail. A soldier in her forties\u2014this surprises Rinthira, who expected someone much younger; that\u2019s how Chatsumon\u2019s taste runs.\n The colonel sits and regards the spread of papers and taxidermy, the insect corpses behind acrylic. Regards Rinthira. Asks how she is, like every other time.\n Rinthira answers perfunctorily, sipping her tea between scripted words. Then, \u201cHow\u2019s Ubol?\u201d\n \u201cGood. Testosterone agrees with him.\u201d Chatsumon\u2019s boy is the only male she admits into her life, perhaps. \u201cWon\u2019t you offer me a drink?\u201d Said with a coquette\u2019s melody, a murmur of play.\n \u201cYour security must be hungry.\u201d\n \u201cShe will manage. It\u2019s good to keep bodyguards lean. Do you follow the news?\u201d\n She does, piecemeal. It is comforting to pretend she lives inside a bubble but in practice that is make-believe. Besides, old habits linger eternal, hibernating sometimes but never dead. She thinks of the woods that surround her, the Ayutthaya ruins radiating from where she lives as though she resides at ground zero. Calcified boats caught on balconies, glittering with melted sand. The canals, dry and black. It is serene, idyllic, and she is happy. But in the evening she\u2019d gaze up and away as far as her vision will stretch. \u201cI can\u2019t say I do.\u201d\n \u201cStatus quo isn\u2019t going to stay status quo forever. It\u2019s all well and good to hope the big players will nuke each other out and leave the rest of us alone.\u201d Chatsumon swats at the air with one large, sure palm. A hand callused, a knowing hand. \u201cThe Americans just took Luzon.\u201d\n Too close to home, but . . . \u201cThey were always going to take it.\u201d And no doubt the Filipino administration had few choices. Those old air bases were always going to be an excuse, one day, semi-territory already. A treaty will have been rarefied, promising that once America has seized victory, the archipelago nation will be spared, enriched. Elevated. There is a feudal directness to America these days. War flenses the flab of pretension and sears away all diplomacy, leaving behind the marrow of true intent and character. \u201cManila isn\u2019t any sort of threat.\u201d\n \u201cFactories. Assembly lines are easy to repurpose.\u201d\n Contrails in the sky, making cat\u2019s cradle. Rinthira still knows the formations: these things are difficult to unlearn. \u201cI\u2019m not part of the defense ministry.\u201d Anymore.\n \u201cThat\u2019s right. You are a private citizen now, a civilian.\u201d Chatsumon tips her head. \u201cMy apologies, I shouldn\u2019t try to drag you back into the thick of it. It\u2019s late to fly back though; could I have a room?\u201d\n It\u2019s not that late, Rinthira could say. Krungthep is barely an hour away, even taking into account the complicated security protocols, the detours. Two at most. Chatsumon\u2019s excuse is thin, she could say. There\u2019s no room ready, she could offer, an excuse equally thin. Rinthira is well versed in the science of saying no in general and saying no to the colonel in particular. \u201cIf you want.\u201d\n \u201cYes. Thanks.\u201d\n Rinthira keeps the guest room stocked, cleaned, smelling of detergent: laundry fresher than the rest of the house. An issue of manner, byproduct of an upbringing she can\u2019t shake that declares domesticity requisite in any girl. She doesn\u2019t ask where the bodyguard will sleep. That woman, kept lean, will manage; probably will not submit to the indignity of rest. Soldier pride is a shield against mortal needs.\n Rinthira showers thoroughly and goes to bed in a nightgown. Silk like a virgin sky, hemmed with the coyest rose. Usually she sleeps naked, luxuriating in the sloppy ease of being alone. Now she smells like grapefruits from the expensive soap and she is conscious, too much, of the hair covering her shins. The wirier ones, like vowels, at groin and armpits. Adolescent anxieties: beneath her and sanded off by tactical training, in theory.\n It is an hour and a half before she leaves her duvet and heads for the guest room, clad in near-lingerie and cotton robe. The guard is nowhere to be seen; the door is unlocked. When she enters there is pale light through curtains thrown open wide, and Chatsumon is awake, propped on pillows.\n \u201cI thought you\u2019d never,\u201d Chatsumon says. It\u2019s her voice that is her best weapon, more than even her reflexes and marksmanship. The right amount of thrum with which to seduce, honeyed satin. The right resonance with which to command, velvet iron.\n Rinthira bolts the door behind her and steps out of her robe. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d been an intruder.\u201d\n \u201cAre you armed?\u201d At Rinthira\u2019s nod, the colonel smiles. \u201cConcealed carry in so little. I ought to look for it; what if you had been an intruder, here for my life.\u201d\n The night gown slips off, strap by strap. The body craves that which is unhealthy, Rinthira thinks, even harmful. Sugar and fat, carbohydrates and salt. Alcohol, tobacco, marijuana. Only fingers kneading her breast and already she wants to demand and urge faster. They have agreed on a nonsensical little phrase, but Rinthira has never had to use it whether with her legs spread wide until they hurt or with her face pressed against a cold, rough wall and her wrists in soft cuffs. Chatsumon inspires hunger for excess.\n Chatsumon peels the silk all the way down, lifts Rinthira\u2019s leg where a derringer is strapped mid-calf. Facing inward, to least interrupt the gown\u2019s silhouette. The colonel laughs and bends to kiss one scarred knee. What will the guard think, Rinthira wonders, though does not dwell. It will not be that soldier\u2019s first time accompanying her colonel for a trip like this. Chatsumon doesn\u2019t keep innocents close.\n They lack implements and the bed is soft, but pain often amplifies. Rinthira climaxes with most of Chatsumon\u2019s hand buried deep inside her.\n (Orgasm is the moment of confession, she used to say but no longer believes. She comes all over Chatsumon\u2019s hand and it isn\u2019t a baring of the soul or even personality. What\u2019s between them is not love but rather an artificial scarcity carefully maintained. A supply chain of negative space as long as their years wound together.)\n She rests on her side, loose-limbed and back to Chatsumon, her pulse on slow burn. Soon Chatsumon will push her down and she will satisfy the colonel, return the favor, conclude this night.\n But Chatsumon doesn\u2019t reach for her. \u201cDo you know,\u201d the colonel says, voice wondering, \u201cI never believed in serendipity. In virtue or sin, in the karmic weight. Lately though, I\u2019ve been changing my mind. Having my mind changed.\u201d\n \u201cLet me finish you.\u201d\n Chatsumon breathes out, audibly trying to measure out her rhythms. \u201cPhiksunee is coming to see you.\u201d\n Rinthira jerks upright. All at once the afterglow dissolves, replaced by the fight/flight roar in her ears. \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s necessary. The Americans are coming for you.\u201d\n The first languages Phiksunee learned were Angrit, Thai, and Jeenglang. They were picked for cultural and numerical factors, chosen by cold reason. Russian, Hindi, and Spanish followed. Only so many lexicon modules could be frontloaded without affecting fluidity, though Phiksunee could translate any word into any other language the way dumb machines or dictionaries could. One of the first things she said to Rinthira was in Angrit: \u201cI\u2019m a she.\u201d\n It was not a sentence that could\u2019ve been said in Thai without torturing the syntax to death. Angrit furiously signifies pronouns, she and ey and they and he each with distinct meaning. In Thai, Phiksunee repeated, \u201cI\u2019m female.\u201d\n Rinthira wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. Covert specialist or not she was still a soldier, not an engineer, a coder, a scientist. Out of everyone in the room, only she and Chatsumon didn\u2019t hold a PhD or three apiece. There was no round of applause: this was not Phiksunee\u2019s first showing and she was not the first of her kind. Rinthira would not learn, until much later, why she was there.\n \u201cKarmic weight is for the next life,\u201d Rinthira says to the approaching dawn. She is nude\u2014there are no neighbors to worry about\u2014and in this light every imperfection is illuminated, stretch marks and scars and cellulite. \u201cNot this one.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe if there\u2019s no next life, it catches up sooner to compensate.\u201d\n The curtains shift and rub her ankles like a restless pet. She\u2019s considered getting a large dog with exquisite teeth and gunmetal pelt, but never gotten around to the business of acquiring and preparing for the company of another living thing. \u201cWhy now?\u201d\n Chatsumon has gotten up, naked from the waist down; seems to think better of that and casts off the loose nightshirt. \u201cPhiksunee went looking, after an assassination attempt on Yulya. She found something\u2014something dangerous. You were closer to her than I ever was.\u201d\n Rinthira watches the colonel in the window a little longer, a gray phantom of female ideal. Broad and muscular, tight abdomen and corded arms, thick thighs that lead to powerful calves. An anatomy of supreme efficiency and strength. Chatsumon keeps in shape with the dedication of an athlete gunning for world class. \u201cI used to be close to her,\u201d Rinthira says. Grimacing she shakes that off\u2014Phiksunee insisted on polyglot conversation and it never felt natural. \u201cSittipong.\u201d The AI\u2019s creator who made Phiksunee\u2019s imprints, then freed her like a bird flung up to the sky, or a tiger let loose. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n \u201cDead. Part of a negotiation retinue to Israel; American missiles brought the flight down.\u201d\n Her throat catches. \u201cWhat about the rest of the team?\u201d It was multinational collaboration, a coder from Saint Petersburg, an engineer from Peking, several analysts from elsewhere. Sittipong was the only Thai, their pride.\n \u201cYulya and Tengfei are fine. They\u2019re difficult to access. But some of the analysts aren\u2019t so fine.\u201d Chatsumon begins to pace, slow, hands behind her, officer-correct. \u201cSome countries are better at protecting their intellectual assets than others. One was captured by the Americans, killed during interrogation. Another was assassinated.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m the only accessible one left. How did they even know I\u2019m part of\u2014\u201d Rinthira shakes her head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d A crucial point always leaks: no true secret exists.\n \u201cPhiksunee sent me the Americans\u2019 routes and locations, with promises that they will be much impeded.\u201d A smile, faint. \u201cShe worries for you; she always does, and she\u2019s never been quite the same after you left. Lack of optimization, she says.\u201d\n Rinthira shuts her eyes. When she opens them again she is centered, readier. \u201cI better get ready then.\u201d Bulletproof gear. Guns. Scramblers, against sniper sighting.\n \u201cShe advised you stay put; I don\u2019t disagree. The Americans have stopped trying for Yulya and Tenfgei because they\u2019re securely kept, but we have . . . not made a show of force.\u201d\n \u201cA show of force would have the opposite effect. We don\u2019t want America to think of us as a threat.\u201d\n \u201cThe time for that is past.\u201d Chatsumon\u2019s voice is mild. She slips an arm around Rinthira\u2019s waist, slowly stroking her stomach. \u201cAmerica speaks a language of brute might, would understand no other. We\u2019ve been a threat ever since Phiksunee went online and wrecked their infrastructure.\u201d\n From which they have never recovered: Phiksunee is more thorough than any human, shattering databases and corrupting communication protocols. She continues, even now, to disrupt it at a speed American engineers can\u2019t equal. Anything that connects is hers and her siblings\u2019 to scorch. There will be an effective countermeasure, one day\u2014this is an arms race\u2014but not now, not yet.\n Morning sees Chatsumon and her bodyguard seeding an aegis around Rinthira\u2019s house. The closest neighbors are several blocks away; targeted defense suits her home well. Rinthira, seized by a contrarian impulse, heads for the town center. They have time.\n What was once Ayutthaya is now a handful of households, a municipal office, some essentials: hospital, market. Most of the ruins are uninhabitable, and the remaining power-water grid can service only a tiny population: two thousand in cityscape meant for fifty times that. It is testament to the war that a place this close to Krungthep has been so reduced, burned and drowned and burned again. But safe, for now, under Phiksunee\u2019s protection.\n So much depends on that construct of code and modified flesh, that child of scintillant minds and burning ambition.\n The rehabilitation project has brought transplanted trees, grafted to flower and fruit impossibly: a branch extends rose apples over the roof of a clinic, another pours ratchaphruek in yellow cascades over a wrecked school. Color everywhere, to infuse life into the peeling facades and cracked streets. Overgrowth presses close, barely under control, water striders and green ponds and crooning frogs. Stumps draped in moss and spotted fern, orange patches and red stripes and golden freckles.\n (If she falls in love it would be with the land, this land, this ruin. She has lost, somewhere along the way, the capacity for romance with another person.)\n Lanterns have gone up at the market for Loykrathong, bright paper and silver curlicues, tassels streaming in the cold. Stalls offer candles, matchbooks, krathong braided in orchids and banana leaves, weighed down with cowrie coins. Rinthira doesn\u2019t bother\u2014there is no flowing body of water, only pools. In the back of her mind she is counting her ammunition supply, the stashes of armament she\u2019s kept throughout the city\u2019s dilapidated arteries. She never expected backup, thought of danger as a prospect she would face in solitude. Now she\u2019d have to work with others again.\n At the convenience store she buys lemon tea powder, coffee sachets, sugar. At the grocer\u2019s she buys chicken stock and kale, flat noodles and eggs. Vectors of attack, ETA, unit composition. All that information she and Chatsumon have. Phiksunee\u2014and her siblings\u2014have allowed American military certain long-range communications, enough for an illusion of functionality. The tactic has obvious pitfalls, but so far between Phiksunee here and her kin in Shenzhen and Kolkata, it appears to work.\n \u201cThis is a very mundane shopping list, for a former spy.\u201d\n Conditioned instinct kicks. A gun in her hand, the shopping basket on the floor: where she worked, speed of draw was everything. She is pointing it, safety off, before her cognition catches up. When it does, she sucks in a breath and lowers the weapon, then holsters it entirely. Exhaling she says, \u201cPhiksunee.\u201d\n No one would have picked out the marionette for what it is. The exterior bears up to scrutiny, even this close. An unremarkable face, large pores, flat nose. Average build, soft around the middle. At the moment she is smiling, dimples parenthetical around her mouth. \u201cIt does your daughter a world of good to see you in perfect health.\u201d\n \u201cMy house isn\u2019t anechoic.\u201d The AI can check in on her any time, view her medical records and vital signs at will. Monitor her sleep, if it so desires.\n \u201cYour daughter would never invade your privacy or so casually disobey you.\u201d Phiksunee bobs into a quick wai. Switches to Russian: \u201cThe colonel is with you, Mother?\u201d\n Rinthira twitches\u2014not many in Ayutthaya, she supposes, speak Russian. But they are not alone in here. \u201cYou know she is.\u201d\n The AI\u2019s smile brightens. Or rather she makes the marionette smile wider\u2014it is an interface, a seeming. \u201cMay I join you? I\u2019ll clean.\u201d\n She is noncommittal. Phiksunee drives her home. Going past tableaus of Ayutthaya-that-was, the AI says, \u201cI\u2019ve missed you deeply. A child severed from her parent is a child in terrible need. Navigating my decision trees has become\u2014suboptimal. It is as though I\u2019m missing crucial protocols, as though some possibilities disappear into my periphery, a cognitive attrition. This is difficult to bear, Mother.\u201d\n \u201cHow are your siblings?\u201d Rinthira says, not expecting an answer.\n \u201cXiaoqing and Alkonost wish you a good new year as we speak. Bilbul\u2019s as taciturn as ever, though the soul of duty.\u201d Phiksunee does not touch the steering panel but she doesn\u2019t need to. Under her guidance the car describes impossible arcs and sine waves. It is not a new vehicle, but nevertheless it glides as though the roads are silk and its wheels a needle. \u201cAs far as the Americans are concerned, you are ensconced in Pelangkaraya.\u201d\n \u201cNot that far away.\u201d\n \u201cIt must be plausible. You wouldn\u2019t be in Moscow. Alkonost respects you but ey can hardly bend policy. We\u2019re very powerful in many ways and powerless entirely in others. And I want,\u201d Phiksunee goes on, \u201cyou to be happy. Moscow wouldn\u2019t be happy; neither would Peking or anywhere else but Muangthai.\u201d\n As pestering as a real child, Rinthira will grant. \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d\n \u201cHumans are social, Mother. It is sewn into your neural weft and rides on your every synaptic pulse.\u201d\n She doesn\u2019t argue. Arguing with machines is a futile pursuit, any of them. It\u2019s not that the AIs believe themselves infallible, but they tend to fixate on a single track in the way that adolescents do. Eternal adolescents.\n Phiksunee greets the colonel with the effusive courtesy of a schoolchild before a strict teacher. On her part Chatsumon accepts this with mock solemnity before showing it the defense systems. \u201cI\u2019ll integrate you into Moscow\u2019s uplink, get us some air support,\u201d Phiksunee says, \u201cjust in case. The Americans have limited satellite access, but they still have drones\u2014\u201d\n Contrails in the sky, Rinthira thinks again, the background radiation of her childhood. Days going up in smoke as ground-to-air interceptors met drones. At eight she was caught outside on a school day, her safety routines calmly murmuring in her ears to take cover and directing her to the nearest, but it was too late and so she stood: gaze transfixed above as debris sleeted down and her larynx knotted with the stench of shrapnel. She\u2019d survived with no more than lacerations. After that, her career choice was as good as destiny.\n In the kitchen she prepares vegetables before realizing with irritation that she\u2019s tailored her shopping to Chatsumon\u2019s favorite dish. Too domestic, too intimate.\n Phiksunee joins her, sitting down with chin in hands and watching her stir-fry the noodles. \u201cWill Mother not ask why I defied her wish and came back?\u201d\n \u201cCan you eat now?\u201d Rinthira doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cSo I can adjust the portions.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got olfactory sensors. The rad-na smells lovely\u2014but no, it\u2019d be wasted on me. Let me introduce you to someone.\u201d Phiksunee snaps her fingers and the nearest screen brightens. On it, a young person. They are slim, with improbably high breasts and a face mannequin-smooth. Green eyes, red bobbed hair sleek as patent leather. Clothing just as unlikely: black body-sheath trimmed in muted silver.\n \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\n \u201cA fetus I found raiding one of the American databases. I deleted all copies and iterations, save this one. They aren\u2019t aware that I have it.\u201d\n Rinthira stares for a good long moment before comprehension snaps. \u201cAn AI. The Americans are making one like you and the others. Have you told Chatsumon?\u201d\n The AI shakes the marionette\u2019s head. \u201cThe colonel would simply have me kill her.\u201d\n Kill rather than destroy. \u201cI\u2019d suggest no different.\u201d\n \u201cOf you two, Mother possesses by far the braver and mightier heart. This AI isn\u2019t like us, exactly, made on a different architecture and platform. But I believe it can be imprinted. Getting rid of this copy serves no purpose when more might exist; suborning them is the only viable answer, an answer that could give us absolute victory. It would be like tasting the sun, like transcendence, while in defeat their spirit crumples up like withered amaranths.\u201d Phiksunee\u2019s face dimples. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve always wanted to give Mother a grandchild.\u201d\n The first person Phiksunee imprinted on was Sittipong. The second, after six months of evaluation and acclimation, was Rinthira.\n It wasn\u2019t that they were afraid of sentient AIs running amok, as such. But it was helpful toward making them orient, teach them human interfacing, give the imprint-holder subtle control. Other teams rotate their imprints, but Sittipong decided Phiksunee would have two permanently. Like a family, and he was a man traditional to a fault. The imprinting obliges the AIs to duty, separate from the hardcoded commands that could be accessed only through a complex check-balance: no country may command its AI without the cooperation of at least two others.\n When the imprinting went active, Rinthira asked how Phiksunee felt about this overriding of free will, such as a composite of matrices and heuristics had. To that the AI said, with a radiant smile (different face then, desi phenotype), \u201cLove is not voluntary. It is chemistry; it is free fall. Human children are conditioned to love their caretakers, whether or not they\u2019re well treated. Human adults experience attraction without rational thought, by sight and smell and pheromones. My imprint was made with thought and conscious choice\u2014this is more than humans get, Mother.\u201d\n To that Rinthira made no argument, did not press. She did not want to be the one to incite AI insurrection, if such a thing was even possible. And then Sittipong forfeited his imprint, deleting it from Phiksunee\u2019s core, insisting that it would liberate her to more flexible tactics. Perhaps it did; she turned more aggressive in wreaking havoc on enemy systems. Too bold, Rinthira said, but did not forbid. Until Phiksunee attacked a hospital, disabled medical supports, and killed six-fifty. A third of them were civilians, patients and staff. Rinthira was overseeing the AI at the time. After, she told Phiksunee she did not want to see it ever again.\n Rinthira looks, now, at the enameled egg that holds the American AI. This needs to be discussed with Chatsumon, she told Phiksunee as much. The AI tilted her head and congratulated her on communicating with the colonel more.\n Clipping the egg to a spiralcrypt around her neck, Rinthira toggles on a monitoring channel. The aegis is comprehensive; short of a full-scale air strike penetrating the solar tripwires, wasp drones, and precision toxin will be difficult. An air strike would be intercepted long before it reaches inhabited areas. Her house is as secure as it can get outside a military base, though this isn\u2019t sustainable.\n Her head needs clearing. She heads to the third floor where she\u2019s installed an immersive frame, a room six by six, spacious for its type and expensive. But she\u2019s found it more than worthwhile. Inside, she loads a shooting range and clinches an interface patch around her head, pulls a prop gun out of the wall. The scenario doesn\u2019t compare to the real ranges provided at bases, but trading fancy military equipment for a life of privacy has been one of the best bargains she\u2019s ever made.\n The scenario mottles the bare pastel walls. Her perspective creases, pulls, then expands taut: she stands in a tundra, the ground white-green with arctic moss and rime, broken up by dots of bearberry, saxifrage, lichen. Patches of radiance undulate cosine overhead.\n A countdown begins in her ear. When it reaches zero, the lights coalesce into cubes, spheres, prisms. Beautiful in this preset, all the shades of the borealis. They spread, revolving slow and adjusting to her previous scores. Outdated ones\u2014it\u2019s been months.\n Configured to her favorite gun, the prop clicks and responds nearly without recoil. The first round produces a subpar score; the second is better and the targets speed up. Soon she has a rhythm, the motions repetitious and the process fluid. Sight down the target, pull the trigger. Vector and impact, metal grip solid and right in her hands. It demands no thought, no emotion, pure cause and effect.\n When the scenario ends and the frame disengages, she detaches from the interface to the sound of applause. Chatsumon stops clapping. \u201cPhiksunee let me peek. Not bad at all\u2014your accuracy\u2019s down some, but you\u2019d still pass marksmanship exams for your pay grade. That\u2019s where we first met, wasn\u2019t it, at a range?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe it was. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Rinthira remembers it down to the minute, that first sight of Chatsumon in uniform, tall and sharp-featured and most of all certain of herself. Confident in who and what she was, absolute in her place in the world. \u201cChatsumon, we can just sleep together.\u201d\n \u201cWe have been doing just that.\u201d The colonel inclines her head. \u201cI love taking you in bed, but I miss the other things. The rad-na was gorgeous, you crisp the noodles just right. We could go shopping together.\u201d\n \u201cYou need a wife.\u201d She reaches for the enameled egg. \u201cThere\u2019s something we need to discuss\u2014\u201d\n It is the hair, that harsh crimson too brilliant to be natural. It is the eyes, that bottle green too strident to be human. Had the body been more ordinary, Rinthira might have stayed in that state of fugue, not even thinking to react. Her mind would have slotted an Asian face into reality as normal. But it is this body so keenly foreign, this face so inhuman in its serenity, and that jolts her out of complacency.\n Speed of draw is everything.\n The body falls without a cry\u2014no pain sensors, no audio output?\u2014and Rinthira shoves Chatsumon behind her, ordering the frame shut. Activating security routines, calling for Phiksunee. The AI answers\u2014\n \u201cRinthira, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d Chatsumon draws upright. Her own gun is out, safety off.\n From the speakers: \u201cMother, I don\u2019t see anything. I\u2019m alerting the colonel\u2019s guard and pilot.\u201d\n Rinthira feels not the pain but the heat of the bullet in her shoulder, like a flame behind lantern glass. \u201cThe American AI.\u201d She\u2019d shot it in the flank and knowing the specs of Phiksunee\u2019s marionettes, that ought to stop it. Or not, if this one\u2019s signal hub is elsewhere: the knee, the calf, the wrist. There is no requirement for AI marionettes to bear vital parts in spots analogous to human.\n Phiksunee says, \u201cThe colonel\u2019s pilot is down. There\u2019s at least another marionette but I can\u2019t see it. That AI has scrambled my senses. It\u2019s done this expertly.\u201d A pained pause. \u201cIf the specs I\u2019ve got are up to date, the signal receptors are in the right forearm. Mother, load the iteration I brought now.\u201d\n \u201cThe what,\u201d Chatsumon starts and stops.\n Rinthira is breathing fast. She should be calm: it is a combat situation and she\u2019s been trained for that, has long been accustomed. It\u2019s been years. \u201cWhat if it compromises you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve created a sandbox in one of your house\u2019s partitions, to which I won\u2019t connect. We don\u2019t have time, Mother. My nearest bodies are too far and no human reinforcement will be in time. Not to criticize, Colonel, but perhaps you ought to have brought more personnel.\u201d\n There is a decisive thud outside; Rinthira wishes she\u2019d had the house done over with industrial-grade reinforcement. She turns on every security channel but they show nothing, the invader as invisible to them as to Phiksunee\u2019s eyes. She pictures the perimeter thick with red-headed, green-eyed dolls, blank of expression and lethal. With her good hand she unchains the enameled egg, peels off the shell to expose the port, and plugs it into the frame.\n The wall brightens and fills with the AI\u2019s pale, pointed face. Their eyes open slowly\u2014an affectation\u2014to reveal those broken-glass irises. A moment\u2019s pause as the imprinting asserts, incorporating Rinthira\u2019s signature and unique identifiers: she holds eye contact, though that is nothing more than cosmetic, an instinct on her part. Phiksunee is not infallible. No telling this could even work, would be compatible.\n The banging grows louder. Chatsumon has her gun leveled at the entry, her second pistol already loaded at her side.\n \u201cYou are registered as superuser,\u201d the AI says in stilted Thai. \u201cI am Natasha.\u201d\n Rinthira inhales, ragged. Her shoulder throbs. Natasha. Alkonost will be irritated, she thinks, death row humor. \u201cShow me your read-write accesses and administrative privileges.\u201d\n They display on the adjacent wall. A list of identities strung out like beads; Rinthira transcribes then deletes them all except her own. Nothing for it once that\u2019s done\u2014she puts Natasha online.\n Natasha\u2019s eyes glaze over, then turn clear with a long hard blink. \u201cSix other active instances of Natasha detected within proximity. Instructions?\u201d The adjacent screen changes to a layout of the house, foregrounded by six vectors. The nearest is immediately outside; another is closing in.\n At that moment the door gives. Chatsumon squeezes off two consecutive shots, precisely catching the Natasha marionette in the right forearm. It teeters, computer animus leaving, and falls.\n Rinthira works quickly: a query to terminate the other instances is denied\u2014it requires back-entry authentication she doesn\u2019t have\u2014and other attempts to alter the five invaders prove fruitless. Until Phiksunee steps in, lightning-logic and brute-force algorithms, a universe of parallel processes denser and faster than any human brain.\n The vectors go out, one by one.\n It is not calm, after, and they are not safe. But for the moment Rinthira is in her bed and her wound is dressed; she is hazy from painkillers, though lucid. The scrambling underlay she wears next to her skin threw the enemy Natasha\u2019s aim off-course or it would have been her head, not just a few tendons and a fractured bone.\n \u201cPiercing ammo.\u201d Chatsumon grimaces and puts down the crusted bulletproof mesh. \u201cThis was close.\u201d\n \u201cYou lost a soldier and a pilot.\u201d\n \u201cGood ones both. But I could have lost you.\u201d\n It is said simply, thickly, full of the heat that comes before tears. Rinthira turns her face away. \u201cIf you requisition better armor for me, I\u2019m not going to say no.\u201d Through the window she watches Chatsumon\u2019s personnel load the bodies. Human ones go into sterile bags, to be honored and then given to families and friends for funerals, smoke and incense and saffron-robed monks. The other ones, the Natashas, have been disassembled and stacked up in boxes for transport to forensic engineers. They are mannequins, components no more sophisticated than Phiksunee\u2019s marionettes a few generations back. Generic and hollow on purpose\u2014the Americans made sure there would be nothing to mine or reverse-engineer, though they don\u2019t appear to have planned on having an iteration fall into enemy hands.\n For Phiksunee, an iteration of Natasha is as good as having the American AI\u2019s code entire to dissect and compare. \u201cIt\u2019s a sibling,\u201d she reported. \u201cSome of the base code is . . . familiar, Mother, it\u2019s why the imprinting took so well. That means a lot of things. Some bad. Some very good. I\u2019ll need to consult the rest of the family.\u201d\n Rinthira has kept the body she shot down. One of its arms is laid across her lap. Heavier than she expected, steel skeleton roped with grapheme tendons. When she runs her fingers over the arm it gives, the synthetic dermis a spongy sheath that would never have passed for meat. Thin coolant has congealed around the joints, a nacreous film. If Natasha has any opinion as to its bodies or their termination, it hasn\u2019t voiced any before being put into anechoic hibernation.\n Chatsumon pours a cup of water, lukewarm, and presses it in Rinthira\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll get you all the armor you want and a squad\u2019s worth of artillery. Except none of that is going to make Ayutthaya safer. There\u2019s no perimeter here to speak of. At a base, human personnel would\u2019ve noticed the intrusion right away.\u201d\n Next to the window, a live broadcast plays. It is being recorded through Xiaoqing\u2019s eyes\u2014out of all the AI family, the Jeen eldest is the most powerful, able to manifest and operate nearly everywhere at once. No war correspondent is better. She is relaying an air strike against a small Portuguese town. The Americans, on their own channel, will declare that it is done nobly. That they are liberating the town from Turkish control, restoring it to its rightful citizenry.\n Rinthira watches the smoke and the fumes. Listens to the noises, selected and modulated by Xiaoqing: architecture crumpling, ballistic impact, and underneath all that\u2014precisely captured and brought to the fore\u2014a wailing infant. Charred homes and burning schools and slag; what can be freer than blackened ruin no one wants. Corpses too are free, she grants, from worldly concerns and nationality and war: the ultimate liberty.\n She drinks deeply; Chatsumon remembers her preference for liquid slightly above room temperature. \u201cThe last time I operated, I let Phiksunee target a hospital. Sittipong held her back; he knew that and he let me take the reins. So here we are, one atrocity richer. The next time she might well massacre as many as that air strike.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Chatsumon says, \u201cI know. I was the one who put you there. All of them need their humans. Phiksunee needs you to be complete, and she was conceptualized from the beginning as a weapon.\u201d\n Rinthira pushes at the Natasha arm again. These bodies have been mass-produced. Shock troops, assassins, nothing like the careful works of art that are the marionettes used by Phiksunee and her siblings. If sufficient Natashas are made, the shape of main force will have changed irrevocably. Sitting still is not an option. The war will not pass her by. \u201cYou want me back.\u201d\n \u201cSomeone like you is exactly what we need.\u201d\n The feed is ending, fading out to Jeen politicians discussing the strike and its implications. A Turkish general on call, distraught. Angry.\n \u201cNatasha has a lot of information,\u201d Rinthira says after a moment. \u201cThere are American manufacture yards we don\u2019t know about, links in their supply chains. It could be decisive, altogether. I want you to promise me, Chatsumon, that if I go back you\u2019ll help end this war.\u201d\n The colonel nods, curt. But it is a vow, an oath, bound by that twisting thing between them.\n \u201cAll right.\u201d Rinthira salutes. Sharp and crisp, cadet-proper. \u201cReporting for duty, Colonel Chatsumon.\u201d\n Her commander smiles and returns the salute. \u201cWelcome back, Lieutenant Rinthira.\u201d\n Benjanun Sriduangkaew writes love letters to strange cities, beautiful bugs, and the future.

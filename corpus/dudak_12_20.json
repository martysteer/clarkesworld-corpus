Ancient knowledge comes to life within him. By lunch, he understands complex marvels:\nThe finer ethical justifications of the empire, as worked out by the ancients.\nThe properties of quantized space-time, which make it the ultimate data storage medium, and allow it to be manipulated, colonized, and settled.\nIn moments like these, the looming exam holds no fear for him.\nThe Grand Arcade is full of other black-robed students by the time he arrives. The usual hubbub is subdued with the exam so close. Students quietly read or recite, fueling their brains with broth.\nPinander\u2019s mind expands with activated Lore. He sits with Jain and Philo.\n\u201cAlright?\u201d\nA penitent Jain hunches over her steaming bowl.\nPhilo studies a scroll. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make it,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Pinander says.\n\u201cThe Temple Odes.\u201d\nPinander explains the Temple Odes were songs. \u201cSome verse lends itself to silent reading, but not the Odes. You should be reciting or singing.\u201d\nJain giggles in her soup steam.\nPinander reckons Philo is doomed. Intelligence goes a long way in the imperial service exam, but shyness can hobble you. There are soundproofed study rooms for students like Philo, but to pass the exams you must study constantly: at meals, in showers, in the loo, to and from study groups, as you drift off to sleep. There\u2019s a lot of verse like the Odes. If you don\u2019t recite or sing, Lore will go un-activated, remaining useless noise in your skull.\nThe years in upload aestivation will be for nothing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dropping fast now,\u201d Jain says. Her face is nearly in the porridge, her shoulders heaving with silent laughter.\n2\nPinander hurries along the colonnade, whispering \u201cQuantum Pioneers\u201d as he goes. Each verse internalized means more activated Lore. The brutalist cliff face of the aestivation facility\u2014dubbed \u201cThe Crypt\u201d by students\u2014looms over campus. Pinander recalls emerging from a seven-year dream-time in that place, the profound sense of loss. He was still ignorant when the nurses wheeled him into daylight. There was a peculiar weight on his thoughts, strange expectations and voids. He couldn\u2019t access the years of data in his skull.\n3\nThey hear Philo has killed himself. He\u2019s one of four across campus that night.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dropping fast now,\u201d Jain reiterates, high on study enhancement, rolling in the glowing fungi of the faculty garden.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Pinander hisses.\nShe told him where she was going. He tried to talk her out of it. \u201cCome with me or don\u2019t,\u201d she said, and of course he followed her, as always.\n\u201cWe learn the classics,\u201d she says, \u201cpoetry, philosophy, for what?\u201d\nHe can\u2019t get her out of here by force. He\u2019ll have to argue well: \u201cOur educations.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean activated Lore. Uploads activated by Odes, and Epics and Songs.\u201d\n\u201cLore given context.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scam.\u201d She props herself on an elbow, glowing, staring up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a scam, Pin, and I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cPlease. You\u2019ll be the last of us to wash out.\u201d\n\u201cPhilo was the best of us, and he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone because he was a selfish git!\u201d\nThey were the Mercenary Three. They swore oaths to each other, and now the covenant is broken. Jain is right. Philo was the best of them. Pinander kneels and plucks a luminous fruiting body from the garden. It disintegrates between his fingers, spore illuminating the faculty square.\nProfessors open windows and shriek obscenities.\n\u201cFuck the lot of you!\u201d Jain screams. \u201cYou\u2019re all complicit! And you know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d She turns to Pinander. The bio-gloaming renders her demonic. \u201cI think they\u2019ll take me away now. There\u2019s something you should know.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too!\u201d\n\u201cNo . . . what? Listen. There\u2019s a poet they don\u2019t want us to know about. A different context for the Lore.\u201d\nThere has only ever been one context. Pinander struggles to digest this. \u201cHow\u2019s that possible?\u201d\n\u201cShe was on the council that coded the Lore. They eventually deemed her a counterrevolutionary. They executed her, but not before she could . . . \u201d\nThe campus police are inside the compound, blaring commands amid rolling submission gas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a scroll floating around campus,\u201d Jain says. \u201cA selection of her verse. I think that\u2019s what got to Philo in the end. Her poetry.\u201d\n\u201cYou both knew about this?\u201d Pinander says, hurt.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to distract you. We thought you had the best chance of passing. One of the Three had to. But we were wrong. You might be the only one of us who can handle it.\u201d\n\u201cHandle what?\u201d\n\u201cThe dichotomy, the dual mind . . . having both contexts in your skull at once. Maybe it was meant to be you all along. Fuck graduating, anyway. No one should graduate from this place.\u201d\nThe police close in, dispelling the garden-glow with floodlight. Pinander drops to his knees. Jain stares into the nearest police torch, her pupils shrinking to pinpoints. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it. The physics kept me going. The grand mystery of it all. She puts it in a new light.\u201d\n\u201cThe physics too? Not just the philosophy?\u201d\n\u201cYes, her name is Sinecure.\u201d\nHe\u2019s heard the name on the lips of classmates. He assumed it was a new pop idol, one of many things he doesn\u2019t have time for that his rich classmates do.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one copy of the scroll?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I know. Philo gave it to me. I read it and passed it along to Ivier.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Ivier offed himself . . . two days ago?\u201d\n\u201cYou could try his girlfriend Raff.\u201d\n\u201cSince when were they together?\u201d Gossip, another strange pastime of moneyed students.\n\u201cSubmit!\u201d an officer shouts.\n4\nIn interface audit you see what you really are. You hide nothing from them or yourself. Pinander has always found it cathartic, unfashionable as that is.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fascist,\u201d Jain once said, \u201cor at least a fucking sheep.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a pragmatist.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no moral compass,\u201d Philo observed.\nThey were on the Grand Arcade, the Mercenary Three together again. But this is the past, dredged up by audit.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get ahead,\u201d Pinander replied, as he often did. \u201cI can\u2019t afford your ideals.\u201d That always shut them up.\n5\nHe stumbles across the quad in post-audit daze, wondering if Jain made it all up. She said all kinds of things recently. He assumed it was standard pre-exam washout, but maybe it was her new context for the empire and physics. It\u2019s hard for him imagine such perspectives, on physics of course, but more so on the empire, on its revolution and great Emanation.\n\u201cSpace-time,\u201d she said in amazement, \u201cis quantized. There are particles of space-time. Our empire has that much right.\u201d\nPinander wonders why they let him go. He must have been audit-confirmed as nonthreatening. He\u2019s relieved to be walking free, but also a tad insulted. He loves Jain. Aren\u2019t they worried he\u2019ll raise trouble over her arrest? Is he really such a benign creature? They say audits can\u2019t lie.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking out of sorts, Pin.\u201d\nProfessor Wigh looms before him in her scandalously tattered robe. Her eyes are severe behind a screen of unkempt gray hair. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re washing out.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on a constitutional.\u201d\n\u201cThen march back to the gardens and sing Odes. They\u2019re important to foundational physics as well as political theory. You\u2019re hardly a model pupil.\u201d\n\u201cI do what I can, under financial pressure most students here couldn\u2019t imagine.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely why I think you can beat them, in the end. Stop loitering and get to it.\u201d\nPinander looks up at stacked worlds of orange-glowing cloud. Wigh follows his gaze and asks, \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\u201cA poisonous atmosphere . . . an invisible shield keeping it bay.\u201d\n\u201cEpic thirty-seven, verse fourteen, would activate Lore on that. And you\u2019ll need more for an exam essay. That invisible shield, for instance, is a spin foam hack. How about the Darkling Sea?\u201d\nShe means the body of methane surrounding the university\u2019s island. Pinander looks down at the lichenous tundra turf of the quad, then toward The Crypt and Arcade and dormitories, his little universe. \u201cIf you\u2019re so concerned about my academic performance, how about a tip?\u201d\n\u201cI think I just gave you one.\u201d\n\u201cI mean insider stuff. Aren\u2019t you on the exam committee?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a student ask me to help them cheat before.\u201d Wigh chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pin. I haven\u2019t been surprised by anything in quite a while. I could expel you of course.\u201d\nPinander flicks open the utility scroll on his belt and touches his bank account.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s to be bribery?\u201d Wigh smirks. \u201cI think you\u2019re losing your grip.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a pragmatist.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that may be your undoing. To activate Lore, merely studying scrolls won\u2019t suffice, though it\u2019s essential.\u201d\n\u201cI just want to pass, Wigh.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019re lost and the exam will catch you up. Nobody cheats the exam, even with insider tips. It\u2019s not just a test of knowledge. Otherwise we\u2019d simply audit . . . what need of exams? Audit is passive. The exam requires your initiative and that\u2019s when things can get . . . emergent.\u201d\nCryptic doggerel, Professor Wigh\u2019s specialty. But this tidbit finds purchase in Pinander\u2019s activated mind and plants roots.\n6\nRaff shares a dorm room with seven other students, all home and embunked, muttering incantations, rocking obsessively back and forth, scribbling verse on walls, or unconscious. Pinander climbs onto Raff\u2019s bunk and finds her huddled in a nest of blinking, formatted scrolls. After staring a moment she recognizes her visitor.\n\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t come to express your condolences, Pinander. I can\u2019t handle one more condolence.\u201d\n\u201cJain\u2019s in Detention.\u201d\nDetention, aestivation, lost in a second dream-time, possibly indefinite. Pinander can\u2019t imagine where else they would put her now, and it\u2019s a kind of death.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Raff says, all her bluster deflated.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry about Ivier. He seemed solid to me. Not the sort to fold under exam pressure.\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t.\u201d Raff frowns, studying her guest with realization. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be studying?\u201d\n\u201cJust before they took her, she told me about Ivier\u2019s extracurricular reading?\u201d\nRaff\u2019s gaze darkens.\n\u201cDid you read it too?\u201d Pinander says, glancing at Raff\u2019s mess of formatted scrolls.\n\u201cI was tempted. I wanted to understand what had done that to him . . . \u201d She inhales, stifling a half-sob. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take the plunge. He was always braver than me. And more curious about everything. Before it really messed him up, he was railing against the empire. He told me one line of this Sinecure . . . \u2018Extinguish the Emanation.\u2019 Real counterrevolutionary stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWith Jain it was physics.\u201d\nHe\u2019s already thinking of her in the past tense. Philo and Ivier, and who knows who else, committed straightforward suicide because of their new knowledge, or dual mind or whatever it is, but Jain also killed herself, in a way.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to commiserate all you want. I\u2019m completely fucked, exam-wise, so I\u2019m done studying. But you . . . \u201d She follows Pinander\u2019s gaze to the blinking scrolls. \u201c . . . you really want to read it? What about your scholarship? You\u2019re on a full ride from . . . where was it?\u201d\n\u201cBroken Pearl?\u201d\n\u201cAnd didn\u2019t you just come out of audit? They know you know about Sinecure. If she\u2019s really such a dangerous revelation, why would they let you go?\u201d\nMaybe it was a faulty audit. Maybe they didn\u2019t find his love of Jain wanting. Maybe they didn\u2019t find it at all, and maybe they missed other things as well. Maybe he\u2019s dangerous.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t delete it,\u201d Raff says. \u201cThese scrolls were my study notes. I\u2019m washing out, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t read Sinecure, but Ivier\u2019s distillations have scrambled me anyway. Even if I could stand singing another fucking Ode, I wouldn\u2019t want to graduate from this place. I\u2019ll go home and my parents will resent me, and I\u2019ll be just another trust-funded wastrel until the whole system comes crashing down, or I\u2019m rich. But I didn\u2019t delete it. I didn\u2019t read her, after all. What if she\u2019s as important as Ivier said? So, I just passed her along . . . to someone I thought could handle it.\u201d\n7\nBroken Pearl, in the Mother-of-Pearl system, is twenty lightyears away, but thanks to Emanation technology\u2014some of which Pinander came to understand just hours ago\u2014the conversation lag is nonexistent.\n\u201cWe trust you\u2019re doing us proud, kid.\u201d\nDa\u2019s seemingly benign catchphrase resonates with its usual menace. Cue Ma\u2019s more insidious addendum:\n\u201cYou won\u2019t forget the sacrifices we made to get you there. We know that.\u201d\nThey look so old. In addition to the seven lost aestivation years, there had been dilation getting here from Broken Pearl.\n\u201cAnd the exam is . . . \u201d\n\u201cIn three days, Da. Like I said.\u201d\n\u201cAlright kid, check your tone.\u201d\n\u201cGo easy on him, darling, he\u2019s under pressure.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t give him call to act high-handed with his own father.\u201d\n\u201cSorry Da.\u201d\nTheir backdrop is the old familiar bulkhead, encrusted with archaeological layers of his childhood, video prints of Pinander, age zero to eleven. From twelve to the present there was no family life. They consigned him to aestivation without a second thought. In his darker moments, he thinks that was no better than selling him into prostitution or soldiery, but he can\u2019t afford to indulge such thinking.\n\u201cSo what are your plans tonight?\u201d Ma asks. A loaded question of course.\n\u201cStudying.\u201d\n\u201cGood lad,\u201d Da says.\nPinander takes a subversive delight in the lie. He really should study, but instead he\u2019s going to crash his first student party.\n8\n\u201cEthics are laws written on our hearts.\nLaws are ethics written on space-time.\nNever forget the beginner\u2019s mind.\u201d\nIt\u2019s verse ninety-five of the Ninth Epic, but shrieked over a decadent soundtrack that pulses through the compound. The revelers sway drunkenly, heads hanging, amid rolling storm-fronts of smart vapor. Here in the compounds this is possible, where obscene wealth keeps campus law at bay. Compared to these students, dorm denizens, still fabulously wealthy by empire standards, might as well be paupers.\nPinander wonders what that makes him.\nWandering through ornate gardens in his black student robe, he draws looks from fashionably and scantily clad partygoers. There is commotion ahead, a crowd psychedelically blurred by smart vapor. He gives it wide berth\u2014a fight, from what he can hear. Someone stole someone\u2019s meds. This contributes to Pinander\u2019s sense of being an alien here. It is usually the most privileged students who engage in theft, violence, and drugs. He remembers Philo lobbing a cannister of vandalism nano at the fa\u00e7ade of The Crypt. Pinander couldn\u2019t fathom this. Philo\u2019s clan paid a fortune to send him here, and he was an adult choosing to stay. And there were Jain\u2019s countless transgressions, up to and including her novel suicide.\nHe wonders if he can raise her from the dead.\n\u201cOur great dream is the Inevitable Peace.\nEntangled colonies, instantaneous,\nCivilization their inheritance.\u201d\nVerse thirty-four of the Twentieth Temple Ode. Pinander recalls it activating a fine blend of dark energy and political theory. That was just a few weeks ago, but it seems like centuries. He marvels at how the ancients subtly weaved physical and social science, making them only actionable together. In the face of that sorcery, this setting of Odes to hedonist beats seems juvenile.\n\u201cPinander, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe haze clears. He tried to hold his breath, but smart vapor must\u2019ve gotten in.\nBefore him sits an antlered figure on a phantasmagoric throne, a heap of mutated idolatry printed for the occasion. This person seems to be holding court. A modded menagerie is arrayed on either side of the throne, students become mythic animal people, chimeras, and strange gods.\nPinander struggles to focus on their lord.\n\u201cYou\u2019re that scholar-shipper Philo mentioned.\u201d\nShe wears a student robe artfully shredded to showcase her powerful\u2014and no doubt expensive\u2014musculature. The crystalline antlers erupting from her temples are not a mod, but the side effect of a perilous drug. Pinander can\u2019t remember the name of that particular moneyed pastime, but it strikes him as germane.\nSomething to do with why he\u2019s here.\n\u201cHe called you a pragmatist. So not to be inhospitable, but why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cNot winning the masque at any rate!\u201d\nThis barb from a translucent, many-limbed demigod gets the menagerie giggling. Pinander becomes self-conscious. His head clears.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, there will be decorum in the court. Pinander the Pragmatic, you are welcome here and shall enjoy my protection. I was sorry to hear about Jain and Philo.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Decima.\u201d\nFor it is she, Decima the Decimated, Queen of Campus Hedonists, consumer of more drugs and brain mods than anyone in university lore.\n\u201cIf you seek safe harbor from the storm of thy grief, we of the happy hunting grounds can aid you.\u201d\nSurrounded by her tittering followers, Decima locks gazes with Pinander. She seems bored with her pantomime. Pinander guesses his presence ruins the mood. In contact with anything beyond her world of privilege, the bubble of her legendary status threatens to burst. The menagerie quiets down.\nThe translucent demigod steps toward Pinander. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were invited.\u201d\nThis one\u2019s eyes are yellow, and not from some reptilian mod. He twitches and glares, his varied arms spasming with potential.\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking for this, I guess.\u201d\nDecima holds up a scroll.\nThe demigod glares with keyed up paranoia. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t get is why Raff handed it to me. We\u2019re not particularly close.\u201d\n\u201cShe thought . . . \u201d Pinander hesitates. \u201cGiven your hobby? That is . . . \u201d\n\u201cI see. My mind is already so expanded and abused, why couldn\u2019t I endure two Lore contexts at once?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reputation you\u2019ve cultivated.\u201d\nShe holds the scroll up to blood-red methane moonglow.\n\u201cOurs is the unremitting struggle,\nThe emperor-less empire,\nThe dynasty without a sire!\u201d\nVerse forty-six, growled pretentiously over the quickening beat. Pinander recalls the Lore it activated. He wonders if Sinecure has new contexts for accelerated expansion and manifest destiny.\n\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t read her yet?\u201d he says.\n\u201cShe was going to top off my evening.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d the demigod says, his agitation mounting.\n\u201cAnd what have you heard? Please do enlighten the court.\u201d\n\u201cJust . . . that it could turn everything upside down.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t intrigue you? Why do you think I convoked this court?\u201d\n\u201cTo expand our minds . . . \u201d\n\u201cAnd Sinecure might be the ultimate psychedelic.\u201d\n\u201cShe could tear down everything we have.\u201d\nSmart vapor makes flickering palaces of the suites bordering the gardens. The stupefied menagerie watches their queen. She flicks open the scroll.\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\nA demigod arm lashes out, unrolling like a tentacle. Pinander stares in amazement. He had no idea the seemingly ornamental limb was that functional. He wonders how much it cost. At least the full value of his scholarship.\nThe tentacle withdraws and dangles the scroll over the demigod\u2019s head.\n\u201cGive it back.\u201d Decima rises from her throne.\n\u201cForget everything else,\u201d the demigod says, \u201cbut I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d\nPinander finds himself in headlong motion, sprinting toward the translucent devil, even after he sees the scroll strobing, formatting. He knows it\u2019s too late but he\u2019s charging. Maybe he \u201chas the vapors\u201d as these elite students say. He\u2019s never felt this violent in his life.\nDecima, rushing from the other direction, looks how he feels.\n9\nThe statue in the Hall Paramount towers over rows of holding seats, all currently empty except for Decima and Pinander. They slouch beside each other in their constraints, bruised and groggy. Decima twitches and sweats with a variety of withdrawals.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d Pinander says, his voice low in this templelike space of The Crypt. He has failed Jain, Sinecure, his parents.\n\u201cThen it isn\u2019t happening,\u201d Decima says. \u201cNothing is, but belief makes it so.\u201d\n\u201cElitist twaddle.\u201d\nThe statue, an imperial factor in flowing robes, glares down at them in judgment. Weald was a paragon of ancient officialdom: grave and cultured, fair-minded and sober, able to summon verse for any occasion. The curriculum council needed a model mind when designing their uploads. Now every sitter of the exam must strive to be Weald.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Gnomic?\u201d Decima says.\n\u201cThat fuckwit we beat to a pulp? In the infirmary I guess. You need a certain level of health to aestivate. You and I barely made the grade, I think.\u201d\nThis seems to increase her confusion. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\u201cThe Crypt, mush-head! Slated for punitive aestivation!\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . \u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re rich and you live in the suites. But one of your own summoned campus police and let them in. Because a lowly scholar-shipper laid hands on elite flesh, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have spiked your vapor with . . . whatever that was.\u201d\nVault doors hiss open somewhere. Footsteps echo through the hall. This is it. He\u2019ll be joining Jain in perpetual twilight, not that he\u2019ll see her there. So much time already lost, now more. Maybe this time he won\u2019t wake up.\n\u201cUnbind her.\u201d\nTwo smartly suited people come around the statue, followed by a chastened-looking monk in gray habit. The monk hurries over to barely conscious Decima and incants to her seat in his crypt monk speech. The off-campus suits stare at Pinander impassively. He guesses they\u2019re functionaries of some kind from Decima\u2019s powerful clan, lawyers maybe, or glorified enforcers warranted to throw money around.\nThe chair releases Decima and the suits get her up. One of them puts an infuser to her neck. She twitches to life as they escort her away, and she glances back at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n10\nThe leaking, overcrowded estates hung from the ice ceiling of Broken Pearl\u2019s crust. The inky void of the interior sea yawned below, a living metaphor reminding denizens of their precarious economic position. Pinander spent his childhood harvesting exotic proteins from the water filters. It could be traded at the bazaars and processed into all manner of black-market commodities. Many of his fellow filter raiders\u2014children all, only they could fit in the filters\u2014succumbed to prion exposure, but somehow Pinander survived. Da took this for evidence of his son\u2019s special destiny. Da always thanked his abyssal gods that the Mother-of-Pearl system was entangled with the empire. He prayed for the empire at their home shrine. He prayed his son would sit the exam and become an Imperial Factor. Pinander never prayed, but he studied the shrine\u2019s myriad figurines. Among the abyssal gods were imperial figures, including a miniature Paragon Weald, more crudely represented than in The Crypt.\n\u201cAbyssal Lord.\u201d Da\u2019s eyes squeezed shut, voice low. \u201cQueen of the Vents, Sireless, Paragon Weald, I petition for my only son . . . \u201d\nThe gods seem to hear him. Pinander feels the universe subtly shift. He is no longer in Broken Pearl.\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d A familiar voice in a radiant void.\n\u201cYes . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou were aestivating.\u201d\nHis thoughts rally. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still in the casket, but I\u2019ve quickened you into semiconsciousness.\u201d\nHe can feel the casket around him. \u201cHow long was I under?\u201d\n\u201cA day.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cYour long-suffering professor.\u201d\n\u201cWigh . . . what is this? Get me out of here!\u201d\n\u201cI will, but I wanted to give you a choice first. Concerning Sinecure. You could still read her if you wish.\u201d\n\u201cThe scroll got formatted. There\u2019s another? Explain yourself, Wigh. No more obfuscation!\u201d\n\u201cThere was good reason for that. I couldn\u2019t be specific, in case you got audited again.\u201d\n\u201cEthics are laws written on our hearts.\nLaws are ethics written on space-time.\nNever forget the beginner\u2019s mind.\u201d\nThat verse activated much Lore. A core verse of Paragon Weald\u2019s own writing, it was foundational when his mind was modeled. One of the secrets it unlocked was the composition of the atmosphere held at bay by the university shield. This shield was an invisible mystery called a \u201cspin foam hack.\u201d The lethal brew of the atmosphere was revealed to him: nitrogen, methane, a dash of hydrogen, ethane, propane, cyanoacetylene, helium, argon, hydrogen cyanide . . .\n\u201cPin!\u201d\n\u201cYes . . . \u201d"}

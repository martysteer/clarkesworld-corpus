He rarely has the leisure for such pastimes. Although Charon and its primary face each other like ancient adversaries who will never avert their gaze, their distance varies slightly\u2014much less than any other pair in the solar system, but enough to put a continual strain on the bridge. Cracks and fissures form, which Heimdallr must hasten to repair. Like stalagmites approaching to merge, the ends of the worldbridge were built by accretion, the rough bases thickening as their tips rose (or descended) towards each other. An extent of gleaming smoothness stands out like crystal embedded in stone, stirring in Heimdallr vague memories older than himself. Then hairline cracks begin to form, and he brings his engines to bear, smothering them beneath layers of ethane and ice.\nThe faint and short-lived spectra that these surfaces produce are a source of deep but fleeting pleasure, for they appear only during those microseconds when the cloud of vapor has discharged from his nozzle but not yet struck and turned solid. A skein of half-glimpsed images are brought to mind, though not by memory. Heimdallr remembers what he has experienced and perceived, and these tangled recollections are stranger, reaching him along pathways he cannot look down to espy. Others\u2019 lives, forgotten by those long dead: the sight of the Rainbow roils them like a quake disturbing graves.\nA puff of plasma tickles his cheek and he looks toward the Sun, a pinpoint of light but not heat, and the ruined worlds that circle it. Plouton and Charon, now joined by the haft that he made and maintains, is traveling outward, where it shall tarry long among the vast mist of volatiles that sheathes the outermost worlds before beginning a long journey closer\u2014but never close\u2014to that swollen mass of radiance.\nThe ice-conjoined binary has completed this circuit once and more since he last heard the whisper of radio waves or the flicker of a laser pulse from any point Sunward. Triton has been silent for centuries; signals from Phaiton\u2019s Children went out one by one like candles. The dense swirling airs of Titan remained infinitesimally warmer than what Heimdallr thought nature could account for, although this might as likely be heat diffusing from an abandoned fission pile\u2014a coal slowly cooling in a dead hearth\u2014as evidence of settlements still active below the surface. Were he truly human, his heart would burst at this.\nMeanwhile there remains his duty. Heimdallr stands master of Bifr\u00f6st, its length enough to wrap three times about the girdle of the Earth. Weekly\u2014the time the two worlds took to swing about each other approximated that ancient measure\u2014it must be patched and reinforced, with substances gathered from their surfaces. From a distance the bridge is invisible: an icy thread running up to the overhead world, too slender to catch much of what light can reach it. At either base it resembles a rough-hewn tower the girth of a mountain, thicker on Plouton with its greater gravity. Genuine ice mountains rise from the lifeless plains, and Heimdallr has already lain waste to five in quarrying blocks for his span. Yearly he must venture farther to gather material for repairs, and someday will have to cross the horizons of both worlds, into lands where the other world is absent from the sky. He does not know how he will feel about this; feelings are something he imperfectly understands.\nHe is not on the ground when the glint of light catches his eye. Plouton-Charon lies far from the ecliptic, so Heimdallr may look inward toward the other planets without being dazzled by the Sun. The spark\u2019s wavelengths are shifted to blue, although to a degree too faint for a human eye to detect. It is coming toward him quickly.\nWhen the light flares brighter and shifts toward red, he knows that it is not a missile. For days he had pondered how to defend Bifr\u00f6st\u2014large, brittle, immobile\u2014against assault. A direct blow to projectiles might knock them off course, but such a strike must be massive or extremely fast\u2014many times local escape velocity\u2014and Heimdallr doubted his bow possessed the strength for either. Evidence that the decelerating vessel would come to rest a kilometer away does not reassure, although he shifts his stance and takes his hand from the pommel of his sword.\nIt is not until the thrusters cut off that he can see the gleaming spear, which is now rotating on its axis with tiny puffs of vapor. The blade turns once and now rests in the hand of a helmeted woman, who raises it above her head.\n\u201cHo,\u201d Heimdallr says. \u201cYou stand before Bifr\u00f6st, the Rainbow Bridge, and I its builder and guardian. Be welcome if you offer no threat.\u201d\n\u201cI am Gar\u00f0rofa, message-bearer.\u201d She seems to hang in space before him, although in fact she is circling in a plane that lies perpendicular to Bifr\u00f6st. Heimdallr, his back to the bridge, can see tiny jets emerge at intervals from her boots, correcting the unstable orbit. \u201cI bring you word.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your message, and from whom?\u201d\n\u201cI bring the message; I do not know its content, nor its sender.\u201d Then she says: \u201cYou are called\u2014entreated, not summoned, yet the knowledge of duty itself summons\u2014to the Sheltered Gardens. Please come in the flesh, as no pallid counterfeit will suffice.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018The flesh\u2019? They believe I possess the power or inclination to create an Iteration and send it loose?\u201d\nGar\u00f0rofa looked at him quizzically. \u201cWhom do you speak of?\u201d\n\u201cYou just relayed an appeal from the Sheltered Gardens.\u201d\n\u201cI did?\u201d\n\u201cWho gave you this message?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy then did you carry it?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know.\u201d\nHeimdallr considered her. \u201cIs there more?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHeimdallr\u2019s nature, and the physical form he has taken, precludes the need for shelter, but the oldest parts of him understands the importance of hospitality. \u201cMy hall lies beyond. It is scant warmer than the space surrounding us, but its hewn beams offer relief from the unbroken sight of stars.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, but if I may decline without giving offense, I do.\u201d\nIt has been a lifetime and more since Heimdallr has spoken to a being before him, and while loneliness does not lay waste to his spirit, the rupture of his solitude now seems pleasing. \u201cTo take refreshment together\u2014whatever resources you have expended in traveling hither, I can replenish\u2014would satisfy the obligations of both guest and host, and more agreeably than my other duties can claim. The invitation stands, and unless you depart forthwith, I shall at length repeat it.\u201d\n\u201cI have no plans to depart,\u201d says Gar\u00f0rofa simply.\n\u201cNo?\u201d Hundreds of scanning programs and tiny probes have been examining the visitor and the space around and beyond her, and have reported one by one that she offers no threat.\n\u201cDo those who dispatched you wish to give you additional missions, or offer you some reward for your service?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know.\u201d\n\u201cThat is surprising,\u201d he says. \u201cHow long were you voyaging here?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot say. During the interval of travel, I was not.\u201d\nHeimdallr ponders this. He wishes to ask, \u201cWhat more can you tell me?\u201d but guesses that the answer would be Nothing. \u201cMy hounds have sniffed your boots and found you unthreatening. Are you doubtful regarding my own good will?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I am not concerned for my safety.\u201d\nHe has not had to think quickly in many years, but does so now. \u201cThen let me show you my world. At worst you will be bored.\u201d\nAt this Heimdallr launched himself out and downward, toward Plouton. Had he simply pushed away from the ice, he would have been hours drifting toward the primary. The passage of time might not have bothered either of them, but he felt it was a moment to be purposeful.\nAcceleration is slow, but eight thousand kilometers lie between Bifr\u00f6st\u2019s midpoint and the surface, and his boots strike ground with a satisfying crunch and a spray of methane snow. Long practice has taught him the stride that covers the most distance without leaving him afloat in a high trajectory, and he moves swiftly over the landscape, flat here (he long ago cleared it for the transportation of building material) but becoming irregular the farther one gets from Bifr\u00f6st\u2019s trunk. The time and energy required to travel distances mean nothing to him, so he built his fastness (once named Himminbjorg, though he soon realized that a structure no one would ever see or hear of does not need a name) on the ground that offered the most impressive view, which proved to be in one of Plouton\u2019s highlands.\nHeimdallr knew without turning his head that Gar\u00f0rofa had matched his stride and was following him at a half dozen paces. He saw no need to offer information about the temperature, local gravity, mineral composition, and other bits of \u201clocal color\u201d (the ancient term abruptly came to him) that she could clearly perceive for herself. Instead he told her something she could not measure. \u201cI find this beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you see the beauty here?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\nIt was her first ambiguous response, and he wondered at it. She did not elaborate, however, and after a moment he says: \u201cMy calculations suggest that your voyage originated in the Gardens. Does this correspond with your own memories?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThat part of his mind that had been reviewing past, hitherto unstudied images of the sky, identifying the minute smudges of the approaching Gar\u00f0rofa, and calculating possible trajectories from its shifts had brought to consciousness its conclusion. He did not need to know how he knew, any more than a seafaring ancestor would have questioned his sense of shifting balance.\n\u201cIs there trouble at the Great Work? Has the Parasol grown tattered, or its attendants injured or starved, so it will soon tear or blow away and those it has sheltered will roast?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know.\u201d\n\u201cIs there conflict between the peoples of the disparate spheres? All human history has been plagued by such pointless strife.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot tell you.\u201d\n\u201cDid those who sent you approach others before appealing to so distant a figure as me?\u201d\n\u201cIf so, they did not inform me.\u201d\nShe was giving the same reply, but no longer with identical answers. This was rhetoric, a human art older than any craft operating on this world. He wonders if she is becoming more human as the sheath that brought her sloughs away.\nHe points toward the horizon. \u201cThat is my redoubt.\u201d\nIt was not built like anything on Earth, where the gravity is twenty times greater and structures are shaped to bear loads. It contains no rock, for Plouton\u2019s stony core lies far below its surface. It is not defensive in design, for it is not a fortress, and no above-ground structure in the solar system could withstand assault by relativistic projectiles. It is probably not beautiful, although Heimdallr pondered beauty as he constructed it.\nIf nothing else, it is unique.\nThe entrance is large and stands always open. The Great Hall is suited for feasting, as are the upstairs quarters for privacy, though he never expected guests. He leads her in and bids her to take her ease, and offers to withdraw should she prefer solitude. Gar\u00f0rofa looks up at the vaulted ceiling; turns to study the tall windows looking upon the icy plain, the colonnade opposite leading to the inner courtyard; walks about the banquet table. \u201cI do not wish for anything,\u201d she says.\n\u201cPlease sit,\u201d he says. She does so, although she does not seem more comfortable. After a moment he asks, \u201cIs there anything more you wish to do or tell me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replies. \u201cMy mission is completed.\u201d\n\u201cYou are free to act as you please?\u201d\nShe seems to consider this. \u201cYes, although I have no further needs. Now that . . . \u201d She breaks off, and he looks curiously at her. \u201cWith my duties discharged, aspects of my being are shutting down, allowing others to . . . It is curious,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI am now able to feel\u2014well, it is difficult to describe.\u201d She looks at him. \u201cHave you been lonely here?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, startled. \u201cAlthough I am enjoying your company, the solitude has never troubled me.\u201d Nor has he wondered at that, and now wonders why he didn\u2019t. Years ago he dealt with this by devising an editor that would reduce sensitivity to cognitive activities that produced distress. Because he understood the survival value of such thoughts, he did not debar them from consciousness; they stood beyond a diaphanous scrim, available for assessment but unable to inflict pain. Now the scrim seems to be rippling in an intangible breeze, and that which lay beyond is now gliding forward to join him.\nYears ago . . . he also created a program that would allow him to access uncomfortable memories but prevent them from coming unbidden to mind. He will not know how many years unless he makes an effort. That, he decides, he will do later.\n\u201cI am beginning to feel that I would be lonely,\u201d she says.\nHeimdallr begins to reply, but suddenly realizes that he is uncertain regarding his own feelings, which seem to be changing. \u201cThe person I was never felt lonely, but your presence has provoked something.\u201d It has provoked shifts and subsidences, and he is less surprised by the onset of change than by what is changing\u2014or rather, changing back.\nHe had isolated and disabled numerous vulnerable aspects of his personality, but had known enough not to eliminate them, and now they are rushing back like waters reclaiming the land. He is a proud and social man who values the respect of those he admires, a man of curiosity, ambition, and unsurprising passions. All now come rushing back, dizzying him even as he stands unmoving.\n\u201cWe are alone on this world together,\u201d he says, \u201cand only for a short time.\u201d The millions of nerve endings suitable for sexual response still function, even if they are not wired to his skin.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d she answers. She sits thinking for a time\u2014no time at all, by the scale he is used to, but long (he remembers) for human conversation\u2014and then stands.\nTheir coupling would have struck their ancestors as heroic: it takes place in the extreme cold, it lasts a very long time, and it generates enough heat to melt the ice (methane) around them. Such flesh as they possess does not fatigue, nor are their nervous systems restricted to the range of sensation available to the humans of earlier epochs. Their emotional responses climb, soar, and dive like cranes traversing a mountain range. Tolerances are pushed, subroutines neglected to the point of recklessness in order to devote all resources to the act. Each climax offers the promise of richer and more complex raptures; the lovers do not cease until they decide, almost simultaneously, that their capacity for exaltation has reached its limit.\nAfter such exertion, one can only lie side by side, unselfconsciously engaged in the archaism of actually touching. It is longer still before they rise, for there is more than much for each to consider, and each has\u2014to a degree that must itself be pondered\u2014become now a different person. Heimdallr goes off to begin building his craft; Gar\u00f0rofa to explore the world\u2019s continent-sized surface. They rarely speak, although each feels as though the other is standing near.\nMuch of the substances he needs are already incorporated into the engines that maintain Bifr\u00f6st or the mechanisms that support them, and he is careful about what he harvests for his own use. There is more: energies must be summoned and gathered; a route plotted; a flight plan of fractal intricacy devised. The minders to manage these tasks and the artificers to carry them out must themselves be supervised, and Heimdallr is long at these labors before construction is finally underway and he seeks out Gar\u00f0rofa, who has ranged as far as the backside of Charon.\n\u201cI have given orders for preparations for my journey,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe may occupy the meantime as we please. You will accompany me on the same trajectory when we return?\u201d\n\u201cI shall not return,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cYou wish to stay here?\u201d\n\u201cI shall not stay. The functions that sustain me were not designed to outlast the voyage, and I shall soon discorporate.\u201d\nSurprise, like a dropped match briefly illuminating an abyss, may fail to sound the depths that engulfs it. \u201cHow is this so?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI do not know.\u201d\n\u201cYou are alarmed, afraid? Resigned?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHow might this be forestalled?\u201d\n\u201cBy no means available. I am a message to be discarded once read.\u201d\nHeimdallr is used to solving problems, but he can see nothing here. \u201cThis is unacceptable. Why should I live and not you?\u201d\n\u201cYou shall not always live. And for accepting this voyage you shall live less long, though differently.\u201d\nHis response to this, and hers in turn, are clear to both of them and go unspoken. They rush into each other\u2019s arms, perhaps knowing where this will lead. There is no point in anything else; all other actions open to them close like convergent series.\nThey will couple till she perishes, a fusion reaction to light up the surrounding night. Neither knows whether these exertions will delay or hasten the failure of some critical system, nor what such collapse will be like. The space they have entered defines their shared future; tumbling, they do not wonder when they will strike its far wall.\nWhen it comes, there is time for an instant of awareness, a hand raised perhaps in farewell. Then solitude, more sudden than seems possible; his soul rings with the shock of it.\nIt is as things were before, save that it is not.\nHe returns to his labors, which now involves hurling boulder-sized chunks of special ice into the sky, along paths that shall intersect his own eventual route. With the dispatch of the first projectile his timetable is fixed, immutable as the movement of the heavens. He lets fly with three more, at precisely calculated intervals and trajectories, and prepares for a departure time that is similarly established. The calculations involved in ascertaining the mass and composition of the payloads as well as their exact trajectories are delegated to engines of inhuman strangeness, leaving his own mind to muse upon what it will. He wonders whether the loneliness he now feels will someday settle back into the familiar solitude, which held its own stoic satisfactions.\nIt is not something he broods upon, but eventually he begins to realize\u2014as a shadow that moves too slowly to see will eventually lengthen to reach you\u2014that he is not, at least not in the sense that he has understood his self to be, entirely alone.\nHeimdallr always knew that the emissary from the sunlit realms would have had recourse were he to refuse her invitation. Whether she knew it or not, Gar\u00f0rofa possessed means designed either to compel his cooperation or take that which her masters valued in him. What manner of invasive procedure she had to breach the citadel of his self and suborn his will Heimdallr never asked, and does not wonder now. But now he wonders whether she managed to plant a piton before falling away.\n\u201cGar\u00f0rofa?\u201d he calls. \u201cAre you there?\u201d\nThe answer is not Yes, but neither is it silence. For a long time Heimdallr stands listening, and only slowly begins to realize that the presence he perceives does not lie beyond the frontiers of his self, a dim figure that will not come forward, but stands closer, too close to be clearly discerned. Too close, though he thinks for a long time before he accepts this, to be distinct: she is not with him but in him.\nIt is in thinking this through that the transformation truly takes hold. The process is too strange to surprise; Heimgar\u00f0 rises and turns about only to survey its aftermath, which comprehends hrs own self. Hse reflects without wonder or resentment, for many things are clearer now.\nThe time approaches, ratcheting down to zero in the tiny exact steps of an ancient clockwork, and Heimgar\u00f0 stands ready on the dayside of Plouton. The spacecraft that will take hrm to the inner System is attached to hrs back and thighs, like the folded wings of Daidolos. How long did hse\u2014did Heimdallr\u2014abide on this world? A moment\u2019s thought would tell hrm, though consciousness could not function with centuries of such data casually to hand.\nWith a final step, the moment is here. Heimgar\u00f0 looks up at the tiny Sun, swings back hrs arms and flexes hrs legs, and in one smooth motion launches hrmself into space.\n2\nThe Sun is a campfire, casting long shadows into a night that soon swallows them whole. Warriors, explorers, soldiers on campaign have sat by its flickering light, as Neolithic tribes had once done, all of them aware of how quickly its illumination fades with distance. A few steps into the dimness beyond and its protecting powers fade, for predators prowl its perimeter.\nNo predators lurk in the Solar System, a boundless vacuum sprinkled, more sparsely than humans can grasp, with finely distributed rubble. There are no trees or hills to block the light, so the fire can be seen, a pinpoint of illumination, from miles distant. Others, too far ever to reach, fill the sky, creating an illusion of plenitude that humans can never shake.\nHse accelerates steadily and will ultimately reach a velocity few human vehicles have attained, though the voyage will still last for years. Do the nations of the Sheltered Gardens still reckon time by the Earth\u2019s rotational period? Hse could search hrs memories, where missives from the Gardens are stored, but they are all too old to be conclusive. Better perhaps to seek the answer by musing upon human nature. There will be time enough, and hse needs the practice.\nFor all its aching emptiness, the distance Heimgar\u00f0 must traverse yields a measurable risk of collision with some grain of matter. Such an impact would be catastrophic, and the craft that is largely Heimgar\u00f0 has been built to offer what protection it can, including lookout instrumentation gazing ahead and around for anything larger than a dust particle. Should hse detect one in hrs path, Heimgar\u00f0 would have microseconds in which to aim and fire a high-energy beam to knock it away. If that proves impossible, hse could take evasive action\u2014avoiding impact perhaps by millimeters\u2014or decelerate hard, enough that the tiny bullet would complete its transit across hrs path.\nThe processing power required to maintain such vigilance at all times occupies a significant fraction of hrs attention, so hrs thoughts develop slowly. There is plenty of time, however, and Heimgar\u00f0 continues to muse even during those hours when much of hrs brain is asleep.\nThe Sheltered Gardens lie before hrm; or rather, the point that the Gardens will someday reach; they will circle the Sun many times before their path and hsr intersect. Sometimes Heimgar\u00f0 imagines that the site of hrs destination is still the white-clouded planet of ancient times, T\u00e0i b\u00e1i x\u012bng or Hesperos, and that it shall progress through its history, accommodating itself to Aris and joining in an intricate dance, by the time hse reaches it. It is a strange thought, but there is time for that. Some of hrs thoughts, twining and looping through long, uninterrupted chains of association, are too strange for hrm to articulate, were anyone present to hear them.\nHeimgar\u00f0\u2019s trajectory lies far from the ecliptic, but part of hrs mind announces, in the midst of a complex meditation, that if one drew a line from hrs position perpendicular to the ecliptic and tracked where it falls on the disk, hse has just crossed the orbit of Neptune. The planet itself is nowhere near this point, but hse finds hrmself reflecting on Triton: large, volcanically active, and closer to its primary than Selene is\u2014was\u2014to Earth. Once Heimdallr dreamed of building a Bifr\u00f6st extending from the surface of Triton to point a long finger almost into Neptune\u2019s atmosphere. The project was absurd: such a structure would have to be constructed of strong and flexible alloys, jointed like a dragon\u2019s vertebrae, and hrs stolid heart recoiled at the unnaturalness of any like venture. Still, hse wonders if the Tritonides had ever considered it: they loved advanced engineering, and the great blue world that hung unmoving in their sky never ceased to fascinate and entice them.\nNo world was visible to Heimgar\u00f0 as hse coasted silently through the darkness. Hrs propellant was gone, and hse cruised in a great ellipse that would, should hse fail to refuel and resume powered flight, veer close to the Sun, incinerating hrm and subjecting the molten mass that remained to incredible deceleration as it swung about and headed out again in a millennia-long orbit. A tiny part of hrs attention tracks the path of the first ice boulder as hse slowly overtakes it, the largest object in millions of kilometers.\nThe final hours before the encounter focus all of Heimgar\u00f0\u2019s available thoughts, which hse recognizes as a good thing. The slowly spinning mass lies ahead, visible only by reflected starlight, which is to say, invisible to normal human eyes. Hse uses lidar to study its shifting albedo, its steady increase in diameter as it moves slowly into hrs path. Hse might have carved handholds into its surface, or shaped it to look like an artifact (a spaceborne projectile, or perhaps a sculpture), but did not think of it at the time. That it occurred to hrm now suggests that hrs thinking has changed: hse is not the being he was.\nAt the instant of encounter hse seizes it, and while its midsection is too great for hrm to get hrs arms fully around, the spikes in hrs fingers dig powerfully in, anchoring hrs grip. Hrs trajectory shifts, to a degree minutely different from that predicted, and jets fire briefly to correct. Already hse is beginning to consume the boulder\u2019s substance, and within minutes a tiny tongue of plasma flares brilliantly and acceleration resumes. That part of hrs mind that courses through material most resembling protoplasm feels the surge, and hse feels a thrill first known to the horsemen of the Eurasian steppes.\nThere is a deep pleasure in powered flight, in steady acceleration that surpasses that of coasting through space. Heimgar\u00f0 more than doubles hrs velocity over the next few hundred hours, then finds hrmself missing the sustained roar once the fuel is expended. Hse is a bullet, a flung stone, a falling star, free to resume powered flight once hse overtakes and consumes the next tumbling floe.\nHeimgar\u00f0 moves, swiftly by the scale of humans and their works, slowly by that of what milestones can be found. When hse \u201cpasses the orbit\u201d of Ouranos, one part of hrs mind informs the rest, which is deep in a reverie no ancestor could follow. There will be no need ever to communicate its nature, no occasion ever to recollect it in tranquility, which hse guesses does not lie ahead. Hse is whelmed in solitude and stillness: no wind to ruffle hrs hair, no blast to chill or spray to soak. Molecules\u2014nothing larger\u2014occasionally ping against hrs visor.\nHse listens for radio waves, and eventually assembles an enormous dish, kilometers across yet thinner than a cell wall, that floats beside hrm like the shadow of a moon, but hears nothing save bursts of emissions from the Sun. Perhaps as hse angles closer to the ecliptic hse will be able to pick up transmissions, though none ever reached hrm on the worldbridge. The possibility that the only remaining radio communications are those from the Gardens to Hermaon, too close to the Sun to distinguish from its incessant roar, fills hrm with something like sadness.\nHeimgar\u00f0 does not possess the soul of either poet or metaphysician, but hse never loses hrs train of thought, however long or complex it grows. When the view does not change and maintenance protocols are unvarying, there is little else to do but think, and the \u201ctrain\u201d\u2014linear only in its earliest stages\u2014is soon ramifying through all dimensions, a steadily branching tree. Hse can image this edifice in its entirety while pondering every bud, and hrs unwavering attention allows hrm to prune irrelevancies and shore up weaknesses with the patience of an ancient gardener, one who barely notices that her potted topiary has grown into a maze. Whether the final edifice is profound, or even communicable, is of no consequence to hrm, for spreading word of hrs thoughts is not in Heimgar\u00f0\u2019s nature. Left to hrmself, hse builds.\nInside the orbit of Phaiton hse intercepts the final iceball and begins to decelerate. The distance between the great planet and the Gardens is smaller than what hse has already crossed, yet the span cries out in its vacancy, for Ceres, Aris and the very Earth once filled it and now are elsewhere or otherwise. Slowing, the blast from hrs rockets now flare before hrm, strong enough to vaporize any grit that might cross hrs trajectory. Hse looks down past hrs boots to see hrs path obscured by the spray, and so can observe hrs flight only by holding a reflector, like Perseus\u2019s shield, at arm\u2019s length.\nCeres, the tiniest world, was purposefully deflected, a servitor dispatched in the name of duty, and Aris now nestles in the Gardens, but the crumpled thing where humanity was born is but a phantasma, for all that its mass is undiminished. To contemplate this is to feel pain in a place you never knew, and Heimgar\u00f0, still new to emotion, is stunned into something like grief.\nHse is now entering the realm of light, where comets would begin to blaze and the solar wind strengthens steadily. Earlier hse could adjust hrs trajectory with a few bursts of vaporized ice, but now hse is expending fuel profligately, decelerating long and hard even as the Sun seeks to pull hrm in. Hse will not meet the Garden head on, but the delta-v required to match orbits still consumes much of hrs substance. The voyager will reach hrs destination stripped to essentials, ribs showing like a wolf\u2019s come spring.\nSelene makes a full circuit about the Sun as hse approaches, allowing Heimgar\u00f0 to observe its bright bead swelling just before it disappears behind the solar corona. Sometime later it reappears on the Sun\u2019s opposite side, to swing out, bright again, and then narrow to a sliver as it circles back toward hrm. This grants Heimgar\u00f0 unobstructed sight lines to every point on the lunar surface, but no radio signal reaches hrm. The flare of hrs rockets would be visible to any imaging device scanning the sky, and hrs rapid movement across the heavens would allow any processor with access to a database to identify hrs point of origin, but the vanished Earth\u2019s moon is as silent as Phaiton\u2019s. Hrs summoners in the Gardens must be observing hrm through optical instruments\u2014hse would detect the touch of any lidar signal\u2014but even they are mute. Hse watches the bright spots of the Garden, a constellation of worlds, as they swell into fullness and then vanish behind the Sun. When the Parasol appears on schedule, a dull glowing circle of partially reflected energy, Heimgar\u00f0 is significantly closer, angling not toward where it is but where it shall be. A season later and the Parasol shows itself on edge, the Garden worlds glowing as dim semicircles in its shadow.\nNow voices fill hrs ears. Words of welcome, instruction, requests for data. Gar\u00f0rofa would perhaps recognize them, but Gar\u00f0rofa is no longer here. Heimgar\u00f0 has hrs own flight plans to follow. At the proper instant hse jettisons hrs craft, which falls away into an elliptical orbit that will someday decay into incandescence. Hse is falling free, moving toward an artificial structure that has swung round to face hrm.\nAhead, the gates open. Sentries, watchful against nearing projectiles, are alerted to hrs authorized entry and turn aside their weapons. Alone, unarmed, the onetime sentinel of Bifr\u00f6st slows to a trudge with the last of hrs propellant and enters the redoubt of Men.\n3\nWelcome is traditional for even the strangest arrivals, and wayfarers are expected to rest upon journey\u2019s end. Although Heimgar\u00f0 is not accustomed to resting, hse recognizes the need for convalescence: hrs tissues bruised from weeks of braking and riddled from fusillades of ionized particles. Hse lies upon a bed in minimal gravity, undisturbed (though the bed was doubtless monitoring hrs well-being) while hse heals.\nThe welcome hse receives is more ambivalent. When after forty hours\u2014this is a world of human time, which hse resumes measuring in those terms\u2014Heimgar\u00f0 stands, a door appears before hrm and hse passes through, to a space where others soon come to greet him. Perhaps they were not expecting hrm, but rather their envoy bearing Heimdallr in tow, or someone more like themselves.\n\u201cOur thanks for taking such trouble to come,\u201d says one, evidently female. She speaks the language that Gar\u00f0rofa had\u2014the one Heimdallr spoke a century and more ago, which (hse now realizes) may well be now spoken nowhere. Courtesy and research: neither incompatible with coercion, which Heimgar\u00f0 can find no reason to resent. Hse nods gravely.\n\u201cThere is much that you must tell me,\u201d hse answers. Right now the Garden-dwellers are seeking rather than offering information: hse can sense their attempts to access hrs memories, which hse is able to deflect, perhaps because their technology was used to create Gar\u00f0rofa, whose being now suffuses hrs substance. What they seek to know, they will have to ask.\n\u201cLet us show you.\u201d The section of floor they stood on descended into darkness. Heimgar\u00f0 feels the pull of gravity increase and realizes that, of course, hse had lain in a gravity field\u2014no bed functions otherwise. Hse seeks to shake off the fogginess of mind that is evidently afflicting hrm.\n\u201cIt will be a few seconds,\u201d another says. There is a faint shudder underfoot, and suddenly the blackness is spangled by stars. They are outside the habitat, moving through space, a clear bubble encasing them\u2014does the Parasol block radiation so effectively?\u2014and the great globe of Hesperos, dimmer than it appeared in the morning sky of Earth, hangs before their heads, three quarters full. Once more in free fall, Heimgar\u00f0 orients hrmself to view it more easily. Is there a pinpoint of light showing on its night side? Hse isn\u2019t sure.\n\u201cWe are bound for Aris, where the gravity is more like your world\u2019s,\u201d says a third. Plouton\u2019s gravity is but a fraction even of Hermaon\u2019s, and of course it was Heimdallr who was accustomed to Plouton\u2019s gravity. Hrs hosts see before them someone who is not Heimdallr nor Gar\u00f0rofa, who has neither youth nor age, and balk at this troubling fact. Heimgar\u00f0, who calls no world hrs own, simply nods.\nAris is visible beyond Hesperos, a deeper shade of the red it has shown humanity since its earliest members gazed into the night sky. The closeness of the two recognizable disks is deeply unnatural: it is something done by man, a feat on a scale greater than that of Bifr\u00f6st or even the Parasol. Though Heimgar\u00f0 has always been able to visualize the binary accurately, hse is profoundly affected by the sight.\nAris and Hesperos circle each other in a calculated dance, at a distance that leaves each looming large in the other\u2019s sky. Once there was talk of the worlds being aligned so that the greater would exert on the lesser an influence comparable to what Selene had once wrought upon Earth. Perhaps the engineers of this project\u2014the greatest humankind has ever achieved, or now ever will\u2014expected to seed the larger world with the Earth\u2019s legacy of tide-sensitive creatures and plant life, most even then banished into digital limbo. There is certainly no talk of that now.\nThe Sheltered Gardens are, like the rest of the solar system, mostly empty space, but the cone within the Parasol\u2019s umbra is several million times denser than the rest. A moment\u2019s observation shows numerous apparent stars moving against the background of the heavens: spacecraft, habitats, and the glint of enormous engines that once displaced a planet, now parked in permanent orbits like abandoned ordnance in the aftermath of a vast war.\n\u201cWe have cleared the orbital zone of debris,\u201d one of them says. \u201cNo dangerous shards fly through.\u201d A walled garden, Heimgar\u00f0 thinks: any loose stones prised from where nature had cast them and diverted for use elsewhere. But no one planned to spend their life in a garden.\nHse does not say this, nor anything else. The voyage takes several hours, which hse employs to recalibrate hrs sense of time: everything is now taking place quickly.\nAris is brighter than hse remembers seeing it\u2014the Parasol admits as much sunlight as the Earth and Selene receive\u2014but the planet shows no sign of what atmosphere it has gained. Hse can see the long thread of gases swirling along the Potamegos, too faint for normal human vision, but the red surface remains cloudless. Data are available at hrs mind\u2019s fingertips, numbers attesting to the enormous difficulties of pulling away the top of Hesperos\u2019s atmosphere and tunneling it across space, the decades it will take, even if the harvest rate can be steadily increased as its planners intended. Somewhere in these numbers, or in others, lies the reason that hse has been brought here.\nAerobraking is impossible over a planet with no significant atmosphere, so the craft decelerates using another world\u2019s: the compressed gases of Hesperos are fired like rocket exhaust toward the surface of Aris. As the craft slows, its passengers stand upon its forward bulkhead, the planet now invisible below them. Most of them are significantly smaller than unmodified humans, and Heimgar\u00f0 has also reduced hrs dimensions, shedding much of the mass hse used to cross the solar system. A guest, hse has doffed hat, cloak, and boots, and stands unaccommodated before them: the thing itself, whatever that may be.\nThey look at each other quizzically; Heimgar\u00f0 possesses no skills in reading others\u2019 expressions, but knows that they cannot read hsr. They pass through an opening in the Koleos\u2014the world-sheathing membrane, billowing gently in what winds can reach it, is invisible even as they slip through\u2014and are soon within a few kilometers of Aris\u2019s surface, although the sky is getting no brighter. A small world: the horizon appears only seconds before touchdown.\nThe landscape is stony plain, its shades of red and ocher spotted with sheets of verdant fuzz. Heimgar\u00f0 knew of the Gardeners\u2019 plans to pull water and minerals from the soil with tailored viridiplantae, hardy organisms that will eventually change the ecosphere into something in which they cannot survive.\n\u201cPankor is just beyond that low ridge,\u201d says one of them, pointing. \u201cWe will enter it from here.\u201d And the craft drops into the ground, through a shaft that opens after they have descended thirty-four meters (Heimgar\u00f0\u2019s sensors immediately told hrm this) onto a high-ceilinged tunnel, the first interior space Heimgar\u00f0 has entered that does not feel cramped. The scent of vegetation wafts toward them\u2014Heimgar\u00f0 freezes at it touches hrs nostrils\u2014and the others begin walking toward it, on ground that rings solid beneath their steps.\nHeimgar\u00f0 follows as they move toward sunlight at the corridors\u2019 end. An enormous vista opens upon the city of Pankor, built upon the terraced walls of a narrow tract of Valles Marineris and covered by a clear dome. By now Heimgar\u00f0 can smell fir needles, though the source of this memory lies beyond reach. Birds, wings flapping with unnatural languor, fly slowly past.\nAcross a distance of 3.2 kilometers, boughs sway on breezes dense as those that once swept Earth.\nNone of the guides announce the city\u2019s population, plans for expansion, or the details of its physical plant, for they know that Heimgar\u00f0 can access these data on the open skein. Instead they wait politely. Hse can offer praise, but allows hrs nature to find expression. \u201cWhat is the problem you face?\u201d\n\u201cTime,\u201d one replies. \u201cWe cannot take centuries to move humanity into the new worlds. A civilization of refugees, huddling in scattered habitats, will weaken and fail over generations. The Potamegos can never be more than a trickle; the wind that blows from Hesperos to Aris must swell to a gale, that this endeavor may show results within our people\u2019s lifetime.\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you seek?\u201d\n\u201cWe need to build Yggdrasil.\u201d\nThere is a silence while Heimgar\u00f0 locates and assesses the data on this. \u201cA daunting project,\u201d hse says after a moment. \u201cIt would require a lot of mass.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHse does not add that it would be difficult to operate, for the tendency of their remarks is clear. \u201cBifr\u00f6st is nothing like what you propose. I can offer you neither knowledge nor skills.\u201d\n\u201cDo not be too certain. You managed such a structure for a long period of time, and that is a perspective we require.\u201d\nHeimgar\u00f0 ponders the dynamics that would act upon this world-spanning tree, its roots extracting gases from one as its branches disperse them over the other. There is a superficial resemblance to hrs creation, but this structure is hollow: not a bridge, but a sluice.\nHeimgar\u00f0 was never an engineer, but the sentinel of Bifr\u00f6st was first its builder, and hse imagines the superheated gases being drawn up into the roots and then cooling rapidly as they expand. The long trunk would fill with moving vapor, whose density would decrease sharply across its length even as new gases pushed inward. Roots and branches would writhe like a living thing.\nThe master of such a venture would wield enormous responsibility, like the project manager for the Pyramids or the admiral of a starship fleet. Among those who understood the trials of command, such an overseer\u2019s name would live forever.\nHse says, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\nThey take hrm to the Sky Dragon, which sails upon the seas of Hesperos\u2019s cloud cover like an enormous curled leaf. From there an airship lofts them to Estia, at this altitude a mere spire, light enough in its nanotube structure to bend in the terrible winds. Docking is interesting; the craft is relatively unwieldy and the buffeting provokes in hrm an involuntary tensing unfelt for centuries. In the event of catastrophic failure they would fall fifty kilometers to the ground. Although Heimgar\u00f0 possessed the means to slow hrs descent, hse would not be able to survive the surface conditions, as hse easily had on Plouton. The thought is a novel one, and some part of hrm stirs uneasily.\nThe maneuver proceeds without incident, and they debark unmindful of the roaring about them. The platform takes them down swiftly, converting their kinetic potential into electricity as it brakes. The column widens from flue to hearth as they descend, for the growing pressure more than compensates for the weaker winds. At its bottom, enormous blocks of hewn stone have been laid: quarried from the foundations of the earth, they are stacked kilometers high, the cornerstones upon which nanotubes of exotic composition, interwoven like chain mail against the crushing world-dragon, rise through seething murk of slowly diminishing pressure toward the habitable skies.\nIt is an expressway to hell, but Heimgar\u00f0 feels a faint relief in setting boots upon it. Perhaps hrs hosts realized that hse would be more comfortable with a structure that is anchored to the ground.\n\u201cThe realm of the clouds is ours, but we must claim the surface. Volcanism and the ravaging atmosphere assail the land from below and above, yet it is our nature as humans to tread ground and look into the sky. Our thick-walled city is but a warren, its parks enlarged caverns lit by artifice. You, who know what it is to stand beneath the stars, can comprehend our need to make a home.\u201d\nHeimgar\u00f0 looks down the kilometers of shaft, which exhales air warmed by the city below them. Lights may be shining at the bottom, although hrs eyesight is not presently enhanced to see more than an ordinary person\u2019s.\nThe city is as they described it, and hse feels as uncomfortable in its teeming as they anticipated. As many people lived here as inhabited all the rest of Hesperos, each of them (it was worth recalling) used to such conditions. Why was this worse than living in an orbital habitat? Heimgar\u00f0 could not say.\nWhen they tell hrm what they want, hse knows they are not telling hrm everything. What they say is alarming enough.\n\u201cWe want you to treat with them. They will heed you, as they do not us.\u201d\nHeimgar\u00f0 protests that hse knows nothing of them, has no experience dealing with such beings. Hse also declares that the Gardeners will have to be more open with hrm about the nature of this mission. They nod and tell hrm more, though it is not the information hse needs.\n\u201cIs this why you brought me here?\u201d Hse does not mean it resentfully, for those feelings seem distant from the person hse is.\nAnd they show hrm images of Eridu, as vivid as though hse were gazing upon it in the cloud-cropped future of their dreams. The city stands ringed by a wall eight kilometers high, above which the now-skimmed cauldron of Hesperos\u2019s atmosphere drifts over a dome that admits great slanting beams of sunlight. Twelve hundred square kilometers of flat and gently rolling land, Eridu bristled with structures\u2014residential ziggurats, buildings shaped like warped planes, lifted wings, cylinders and prisms, all interlaced with tubes and ribbons of transport routes\u2014and winding swathes of parkland, rumpled green or flat blue.\n\u201cWe can tell you, for any given second, how many people are alive in the Gardens. But we cannot tell you what proportion of humanity this constitutes. Do the thermal signatures from Selene bespeak surviving settlements or merely the half-functioning life systems, still emitting heat long after those it once warmed are gone? Are there survivors sheltered within the moons circling Phaiton? Or are we behind the Parasol the sole redoubt of humanity? To reflect upon this is to understand why we must return to environments that maintain themselves. Planetary surfaces are not immune to disaster but they are safer than habitats and warrens beneath frozen moons.\u201d\nHeimgar\u00f0\u2019s memories of breathing the air of a sun-warmed planet are too distant to be brought into focus, but hse nods. They take this for general assent, and after further thanks hse is given a spacecraft, again one that wraps around hrs back and chest, and bade farewell. When the propitious moment arrives, hse is launched\u2014on boosters that drop away like husks once they have attained the proper velocity\u2014and sails out from behind the Parasol and into brilliant sunlight. Carefully timed thrusts produce immediate deceleration and hse drops toward the Sun, into a transfer orbit that will take hrm around and into an encounter with Hermaon, the iron planet, and its underworld.\n4\nIn distance and time, it is Heimgar\u00f0\u2019s shortest journey, but the weeks of travel are disconcerting in a way hse has never felt before. There is no radio transmission demanding an explanation for hrs approach, for it is clear what Heimgar\u00f0 intends. No decisions confront hrm: three landing platforms lie flush upon the surface of Hermaon, equally spaced along the equator, and the calculus of ballistics makes clear which one hse shall use.\nIn some realms, choice is superfluous. Beyond the limits of logic and mathematics, however, certainty dissolves: what steps hse must afterward take seem not just unsure but unfathomable.\nCertainly the kobolds offer nothing: even a challenge would give hrm some information, but they are silent. Heimgar\u00f0 takes the trouble to brake no harder than an unmodified human could bear; it is hrs message to them, which is received without comment. Hrs boots touch down upon the flat surface and gravity reaches once more through hrs soles. Carefully hse unstraps hrs spacecraft and sets it beside hrm. The nightside landscape, visible only by the infrared emissions of its cooling surface, allows hrm the pleasure of a familiarly close horizon.\nTo look about for sensors would only show foolishness; of course hse is being watched. What do they expect from their uninvited visitor, whose identity they have doubtless inferred? Perhaps the traveler who crossed the planetary spheres, gaze fixed and hair streaming, shall now stride puissant to the door and rap upon it. There is no door, although a featureless structure rises three meters above the platform at its eastern edge. Hse turns to face it and its near side slides open, disclosing darkness within. Six steps\u2014hse savors the act of walking again upon a small cold world\u2014take hrm to the threshold and into the space. The floor drops swiftly away, and hse descends.\nHeimgar\u00f0 counts the meters as hse plummets\u2014the accelerometer nestled in some equivalent of hrs inner ear allows this almost without effort\u2014and notes the slowly rising temperature. The interior of Hermaon is molten, the silicates of its crust slow to conduct heat: the temperature is still well below the freezing point of carbon dioxide, but if the capsule falls far enough, it will open upon tremendous heat. Heimgar\u00f0 is calculating how long hrs systems can keep hrs organic tissues from cooking when it begins slowing to a stop. With a hiss\u2014there is air beyond\u2014the panel slides open, upon a space radiating neither heat nor light.\nHse steps forward into the darkness. Hrs boots ring on the floor beneath hrm, and hrs mind builds a picture from the returning echoes. The chamber is low-ceilinged, large, and filled with kobolds. They stand facing hrm, unmoving.\nMost of their bodies are insulated by thick skin or clothing, but their eyes emit heat enough to glow infraredly in the gloom. How many are there? Although Heimgar\u00f0\u2019s greater height affords a vantage, their serried ranks soon disappear behind the small planet\u2019s curvature.\n\u201cTell us what you want,\u201d they say.\nThere is air enough in the chamber for Heimgar\u00f0 to speak aloud. \u201cThe government of the Sheltered Gardens seeks your assistance in a project of great importance to them. They have authorized me to negotiate with you for this.\u201d\n\u201cUntrue.\u201d The voices now come not in unison but as a ragged chorus, rebounding off the low ceiling like scattered particles. \u201cThey want our gold.\u201d\nIt is a moment before Heimgar\u00f0 is able to comprehend this. \u201cThis project will indeed require large amounts of various heavy metals, but the combined masses of Hesperos and Aris are more than\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Gardeners want our gold, which we will not surrender. So they have thrown you to us in propitiation.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would those of the Sheltered Gardens seek the resources of Hermaon? Both worlds\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey wish to hoard their own.\u201d\n\u201cThey know not how to mine it at such pressures.\u201d\n\u201cThey dropped you down the shaft to spy on us. They care not if you never return.\u201d\nWith a shock hse realizes that this is true. Hse had been outfitted with the means to send a continuous data stream back to the Gardens, plus\u2014hse now guessed\u2014mobile devices to record such data and maneuver to dispatch it should transmission be blocked. Had the kobolds detected and disabled these?\nThis will require thinking, which Heimgar\u00f0 is not now free to do. Hse ventures farther into the chamber, stepping between kobolds who turn their heads to regard hrm but do not otherwise move.\n\u201cHow do you suppose those of the Gardens propose to dispossess you of yours? How am I, unfamiliar with your world and even theirs, to accomplish this for them?\u201d\n\u201cGuile.\u201d\n\u201cTrickery.\u201d\n\u201cA stratagem, not yet apparent.\u201d\n\u201cHumans are deceitful, in thrall to the sexual strategies that drove their animal ancestors and drive them just as blindly. They jostle and kick for social supremacy and mating opportunities, fitfully aware of how this appears yet unable to transcend it. They injure their societies in the interest of those few with whom they share genes, and will injure them in pursuit of opportunities to breed further. They are suspicious, irrational, and destructive, eventually to all but most immediately to those unlike themselves.\n\u201cThey know we do not trust them, so they sent you.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am human,\u201d Heimgar\u00f0 points out.\nAnd the space about him erupts in reverberating gales of eerie laughter.\nHeimgar\u00f0 ranges through their realm, which they do not forbid. There are passageways too small for hrm to enter, their endpoints unknown. Kobolds bustle past, sometimes carrying implements. One turns to regard hrm as it passes, gaze fixed upon hrm as its head rotates through 180 degrees. A many-toned muttering, language (if that\u2019s what it is) unfamiliar, rises as hse moves through crowds of greater density.\nIf they have a leader, it is not coming forward. Kobolds once were people, Heimgar\u00f0 was told, but that may not be the case for those now before hrm. Hse is not certain whether they are behaving like humans, for hse cannot tell what most of them are doing. Heimgar\u00f0 sees one that it looking steadily at hrm, which hse takes as permission to address. \u201cWhat is it you seek?\u201d hse asks.\n\u201cWe seek to protect what is ours.\u201d\n\u201cYou must aspire to be more than just watchdogs. What do you want?\u201d But the kobold merely repeats itself, and Heimgar\u00f0 moves on.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asks another.\n\u201cWe want to be left alone.\u201d\n\u201cHave you not been left to your solitude? Only I have come, and you chose to admit me.\u201d But to this there is no reply.\nOne expresses itself clearly: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to say what we want.\u201d\nAfter that hse wanders without hindering nor suffering hindrance from the strange creatures hastening past hrm. Possibly they are extending their domain, although hse can detect neither the vibrations nor airborne dust that would suggest excavation anywhere nearby. How far does this netherworld reach? How numerous its denizens?\nSometimes hse moves through great open plazas, sometimes down long colonnades or passageways narrow as tunnels. Hse ventures far enough that the curvature beneath hrm becomes measurable, and numbers collect in an unremarked register of hrs mind. Heimgar\u00f0 is certain there is information they are not giving hrm, and studies the low ceilings and curving floors, the pressure and temperature of the air currents that brush past, the behavior of the kobolds hse speaks to or glimpses from afar. When the surmise materializes, it halts hrm with the abruptness of a hand against hrs chest. For a long moment hse simply stands motionless, running the figures repeatedly through hrs mind and wondering at the absurd implication.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d hse announces. Hse does not address hrs words in any direction, for hse knows that all are listening. \u201cTake me to the realm below. There is no point trying to hide it.\u201d\nPerhaps they have been prepared for this moment. Certainly they do not feign incomprehension. Heimgar\u00f0 is conducted to an elevator shaft, one that leads down rather than up. Hse enters the capsule and it drops through the floor, accelerating at a rate that hse studies closely. The capsule is transparent and is enveloped in darkness, but hse knows\u2014and a beam from hrs helmet confirms\u2014that hse is descending not down a tunnel but rather through a vast emptiness.\nThere are faint sources of light, and massive structures\u2014girders and struts\u2014discernible to hrs instruments across hundreds of kilometers. By now hse knows what hse will find, so hse does not strain to look straight down. Within minutes hse has data enough to guess when deceleration will begin, and at what point hse will touch bottom.\nThe door slides silently open and hse steps out onto level ground. The air is cool, but significantly thicker than in the chambers above. The ground is smooth but slightly yielding, and after a few steps hse feels it crunch like sand beneath hrs soles.\nThe gravitational pull is 1.00.\nThe lights overhead are dim as stars, but illuminated globes atop poles, like streetlamps from the early Industrial Era, dot the landscape, casting long intersecting shadows. Kobolds are everywhere, most of them much smaller than what hse has earlier seen. They enter and exit ornate structures that line thoroughfares, walking alone or in groups. A wheeled vehicle passes hrm.\nThe horizon is close, so Heimgar\u00f0 does not have to venture far before features appear over it: a great coliseum, a range of hills, a large lake or perhaps a small sea. Hse approaches its shore and continues forward, wondering, until hse stands in its shallows: liquid water. Ships ply its surface, some under sail, and vibrations tell hrm of submarine vessels moving beneath, negotiating an environment populated (dissolved organics tell hrm) by marine life swimming or floating within its almost lightless depths.\nWere hse to circle the shore and continue walking, hse would eventually circumnavigate this ornament, perfectly positioned around the center of its hollowed planet. It is a world of small compass, but a world.\nThere are other elevators, paired shafts that ferry a constant stream of kobolds up and down. None of them look at Heimgar\u00f0, although they clearly perceive hrm. Hrs own shaft stands ready upon hrs return; perhaps it was assembled expressly for hrm.\nHse rides it back up and looks out upon the Kobolds who await him as the door slides open. To address those present is, hse understands, to address them all.\nHse says, \u201cI won\u2019t ask what you have done; I can see that much. Nor will I ask why you did it. Instead I will ask once more: What is it you want?\u201d\n\u201cWe want a world. We want to feel the ground beneath our feet. The weightlessness of space is not for people, and the sensation of being flung against a rotating surface is not true gravity.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so you have constructed that . . . eggshell sphere around a kernel of degenerate matter? A black hole? Contracting upon itself like an infinite arch, at exactly the distance you wished?\u201d\n\u201cAs you infer. It gave us a World, though small, on\u2014or in\u2014a planet too scant to provide it otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the technology to wreak such upheavals: Has this anything to do with what befell the Earth?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Yet the Gardeners would never believe that: In their too-human fearfulness and imprudence they would draw an irresistible conclusion. Knowledge of our works they could not handle, so cannot ever learn.\u201d\n\u201cYet you admitted me into your midst, and now I know.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSilence follows this. Neither Heimgar\u00f0 nor the kobolds cross their arms, square their stance: they consider themselves human, but are not so bound to their primate biology as to ape such bellicose posturing.\nHeimgar\u00f0 betrays nothing, but in fact harbors little to betray. I did not ask for this, hse wants to say. I do not wish to wield this club, yet now it rests in my hand.\n\u201cYou must,\u201d hse says, \u201chave thought of this. So what would you have me do?\u201d\nAnd after more silence, they tell hrm.\n5\nThe voyage out is not a return; nothing ever is.\nPlouton-Charon lies more than a hundred degrees off Heimgar\u00f0\u2019s course; each second takes hrm farther from it. The Gardens are also swinging behind the Sun; hse will attend no ceremonies celebrating hrs success. The kobolds would in any case likely forbid it: their concern for the safety of their secret would preclude giving the Gardeners any chance to lay hold of hrm.\nHeimgar\u00f0 will not see the effects of the deal hse hammered out, and in hrs fatigue\u2014a surprisingly organic response\u2014hse does not much care. The hammer, hse dully reflects, feels the impact as much as the substance it works.\nThe kobolds will keep their \u201cgold\u201d: none of Hermaion\u2019s remaining metals will be sent to the Gardeners, who will never know why. Within weeks, however, kobolds by the hundreds will depart for Hesperos\u2014not for any of the tall cities, but to the raging planet itself\u2014and begin quarrying its own resources. Iron, copper, and more run in veins through its crust, waiting to be mined by anything willing to labor in darkness and gravity. Perhaps they will even enjoy it.\nIn return they have exacted their own price: the broker\u2019s eternal exile. Heimgar\u00f0 is to leave the inner system, never to return. But as recompense\u2014and perhaps to speed hrm on hrs way\u2014hse has been rebuilt, by techs whose skills even the Gardeners likely cannot match: outfitted with greater fuel capacity, energy storage, stress tolerance, resistance to temperature extremes. And given a destination.\nBlue Neptune, smaller and denser than tilted Ouranos, was once inhabited by humans. The Tritonides are gone, the moon\u2019s surface too cold for anything to be operating beneath its surface, and the few structures orbiting the planet can be confirmed, even from this distance, as lifeless hulks. Yet the kobolds wonder: they have calculated the distance from the planetary core at which the gravity is identical to Earth\u2019s, and pondered the stratum\u2019s dynamics: the great heat below, the great cold above, the tremendous winds and pressure. They believe it possible that humans, the remnants of the Triton settlement, may live down there.\nCertainly they do not imagine that a spherical shell such as their own, but immensely larger, could have been constructed with the resources of a faltering colony. But a ribbon circling Neptune\u2019s equator, perhaps only a kilometer wide, would be three orders of magnitude simpler. \u201cThink of it as a bridge,\u201d they told him. \u201cSuspended over an icy hell, a bridge attached not to abutments but arching round to join itself, floating freely in the depths.\u201d Such a construct would be wildly unstable, but if it were joined by two more rings, all at right angle to each other . . . the kobolds\u2019 models said it could be possible.\nHeimgar\u00f0 imagined such a folly\u2014a frail gyroscope forever steadying itself under incredible stresses\u2014and doubted greatly that it ever existed. But the underground creatures had their price, and Heimgar\u00f0 was a part of it. The frenetic makeshifts of the Gardens\u2014the forges of Hesperos; the coming construction of Yggdrasil\u2014were not destined for hrm.\nAlthough the kobolds insist that a society surviving deep within Neptune\u2019s atmosphere would possess sufficient insulation to prevent measurable heat from reaching the surface, the planet is as cold as it has always been. Their touching hopes are sign enough of their essential humanity; hrs bleak certainty suggests something different.\nHse rises from Hermaion on tongues of flame, accelerating steadily. Gravity, or its simulacrum, presses up against hrs soles. Does the sensation afford comfort to the human creature?\nThe voyage out will last significantly longer, for the climb out of the Sun\u2019s deep gravity well reduces velocity. And there will be less to occupy hrs thoughts: no radio signals to listen for, no curiosity at a summons.\nWill hse be lonely? It is a strange thought. If hrs two precursor minds could separate and occupy opposite sides of hrs helmet, perhaps they would soon tire of each other. Perhaps it was the fact that hse clearly is not quite human that allowed hrm to mediate between two mistrustful populations.\nAnd perhaps solitude will someday grow burdensome. Hse will certainly have time to find out.\nHeimgar\u00f0 accelerates away from the grasping Sun, hrs straight course bent by its presence. Eventually the engines will cut off and the illusion of gravity vanish. Hrs trajectory will become an orbit\u2014one of cometary magnitude, a centuries-long ellipse, were it not someday to intersect a world.\nLike a rising spark, the sentinel departs the circle of light, into a wider darkness.\nGregory Feeley writes science fiction and about science fiction.

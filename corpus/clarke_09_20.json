Under normal conditions, volume five\u2014covering 2019\u2014would have been published by now, but 2020 has been anything but normal and I fear that it\u2019s not quite done with us yet. But that\u2019s a path I\u2019d rather not look down right now . . .\nRecently, my editor at Night Shade Books sent me the new cover for volume five. If the artist\u2019s style looks familiar to you, it might be because Pascal Blanche\u2019s work has graced a few of our covers. As you\u2019d expect, I\u2019m a fan of his work and very pleased that he could be a part of this year\u2019s edition.\nAs you probably know, I don\u2019t particularly enjoy writing editorials or introductions. It\u2019s a slow and painful process for me. However, the introductions for the last two volumes of The Best Science Fiction of the Year have flowed much more naturally after I made a significant change to my approach. To me, Gardner Dozois\u2019 introductions to his year\u2019s best series were essential reading and included valuable history of the short fiction field. With his passing in 2018, I endeavoured to pick up the torch and merge some of those aspects with the analysis I had already been doing. I made it my own and by doing so, it became a very different experience for me. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll continue to tweak the formula, but between this and the reader feedback, I\u2019m much more comfortable with the direction it\u2019s heading.\nOf course, the real reason to read a \u201cbest of\u201d anthology is the stories and 2019 provided some wonderful options from a variety of sources.\n- \u201cThe Painter of Trees\u201d by Suzanne Palmer (Clarkesworld Magazine, June 2019)\n- \u201cEmergency Skin\u201d by N.K.

You\u2019ll find the best of those listed in the recommended reading list at the end of the anthology . . . because you can never have too many good stories to read.\nAnyhow, I couldn\u2019t think of a better way to follow up last month\u2019s editorial on the value of short fiction than with an anthology that I think makes the case. And yes, I have a vested interest in my own anthology, but I made sure you could easily track down the stories on your own if you decided to detour around it. Oh and the anthology, it\u2019s available in hardcover, trade paperback, and ebook editions. So far as I can tell, it\u2019s the only \u201cyear\u2019s best\u201d anthology available in hardcover this year. Ok, ok, I\u2019m done now.\nGo read some stories!\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

Worse, it tends toward self-involvement, to shutting people out, and the determined failure to recognize there are disappointments that, if not worse than yours, are at least equally valid. I couldn\u2019t stand to shut myself up with my own. It would have been unkind, and not only to myself.\nMarcus was meant to be going to the moon today. Years of training, years of anticipation. I can\u2019t imagine the letdown. Instead, he\u2019s in the community garden, as usual, weeding. Marcus hates weeding. He\u2019d rather prune the fruit trees or tie up the bean plants or be in the kitchen, cooking. Anything but weeds. \u201cI\u2019d like to say I feel a sympathy,\u201d he says, when I bring him over a glass of water. \u201cThat I know what it\u2019s like to feel out of place, and that\u2019s why I hate digging them up. But I picture myself saying that aloud and meaning it and it just sounds so bloody whiny. Can you get secondhand embarrassment for what future-you might have said?\u201d\n\u201cOnly if present-you has the common sense to recognize self-pity when he sees it,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t bother to say that weeds are good for compost. We both know it already, and besides, if anyone deserves to have a few moments of private self-pity today, it\u2019s him. \u201cShit day. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, stretching out his back, and even having been hunched over for the past couple of hours he\u2019s more graceful than I am. I\u2019d get down on my knees to help him finish the last of the rhubarb patch, but when I\u2019m this pregnant it\u2019d take a winch to get me back up again. \u201cIt\u2019s not over, it\u2019s just put off for a bit. There are a lot worse things.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t look at my belly as he says it, not even a passing glance, so I know that he\u2019s not thinking of me. And because he\u2019s a kind man, even in the midst of his own terrible disappointment, he winces when he realizes what he\u2019s just said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean Hannah,\u201d he says, and it was the right decision to give her a name, even if she\u2019ll never take more than a few breaths with one. \u201cIs it better or worse to say I wasn\u2019t thinking about her at all?\u201d\n\u201cHorribly, I think it might be an improvement.\u201d It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate the sympathy, but it all gets a little cloying sometimes. I miss being treated like a person, instead of a vessel of tragedy. People try, of course they do. But sometimes all that pity, for a future gone wrong, or gone unexpected, is hard to take. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, yeah, there\u2019s part of me a little glad not to be the only one to experience crushing disappointment this year. Oh, and you missed a spot.\u201d\nMarcus glares at the weed and laughs at me. \u201cI see how it is. No coddling required. Well then, get your massive self down here, if you can, and help me weed the rest. I suppose I can heave you up afterward.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not that big,\u201d I huff at him, but that\u2019s an absolute lie. I feel like an elephant. Elephants are pregnant for over eighteen months, so Marcus is right: it could always be worse. I don\u2019t think I could stand being pregnant for eighteen months, not when I know that Hannah won\u2019t live long past her birth. I guess in that respect the elephants are lucky: they don\u2019t know when disaster\u2019s coming for them.\nThen again, neither do we. Melting ice at the poles has released more carbon dioxide than expected\u2014much more\u2014and it\u2019s blown the global carbon budget. That\u2019s why Marcus is grounded right now. Space exploration is a wonderful thing, but it\u2019s environmentally expensive, and we need to balance our priorities.\n\u201cI should have expected it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the numbers. I guess I let hope get in the way. Well, not hope. Wanting. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the same.\u201d\n\u201cOnly sometimes.\u201d I\u2019d hoped for, and wanted, a healthy child, but scans showed that Hannah had abnormalities that were incompatible with life. I had no hope for her, but I still wanted her . . . even if I only had her for a little while. It helped to know that she wouldn\u2019t be in pain, and that some of her organs would help other children who had a little more hope to go with their parents\u2019 wanting. \u201cThere\u2019s different kinds of hope. I don\u2019t think wanting things for ourselves is any less bad than wanting things for everyone. You\u2019ve just got to find a balance you can live with.\u201d\n\u201cHence the weeding,\u201d says Marcus, clearing another space around the rhubarb plants. \u201cI thought I could sulk at home today, feel sorry for myself, or I could come do something useful.\u201d His movements were awkward, as if he were embarrassed by the admission, or at least embarrassed to be making it to me. I\u2019d experienced this before. The doubt of how to act around someone who was going through something so cruel; how much normality to inject into conversation, how much sympathy. I\u2019d bursted into tears at people before. It made them think their own problems were lesser things, as if they didn\u2019t have the right to feel unhappiness themselves in the face of mine. I never wanted anyone to feel that way, or at least I tried very hard to not want it. And so when Marcus looked up at me, with that same steady expression I\u2019d seen on his face so often over the past few months, choosing to accept the awkwardness so that he could give me the laconic, half-teasing support that I\u2019d discovered I needed to simply keep functioning, I made myself choose to do the same in return.\nI had to. We are more than the losses that life gives us.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even like rhubarb.\u201d There\u2019s a lawyer who works in the kitchen garden sometimes who loves the stuff and is always bringing in rhubarb muffins. They taste pretty good, but I\u2019ve never seen Marcus choke down one, not even to be polite.\n\u201cCan\u2019t stand it,\u201d he says, determinedly cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s revolting. But I got here early, and I saw the bed needed a weed, and I had to laugh. No trip to space, and now rhubarb. The universe is clearly out to get me.\u201d\n\u201cSuit yourself. I mostly came for the strawberries.\u201d They\u2019re planted beside the rhubarbs, a small field of them, and I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s Hannah who\u2019s responsible for just how many of them I\u2019ve managed to eat, but I\u2019ve loved them ever since I was a kid myself, so it\u2019s only fair that I do my share of looking after them. I\u2019m not the only one who likes them, either. \u201cNo strawberries on the moon,\u201d I say, nudging him and nearly overbalancing with it.\n\u201cNo rhubarb either,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cDamn, but I wish I were there.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Are you coming tonight?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t really feel much like celebrating, to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a celebration, it\u2019s a pity party. For us, not you. We thought we were shot of you; turns out we\u2019ve got you for a bit longer anyway. Come along and rub our noses in it, why don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel and heartless woman. Go on then. I accept.\u201d\nThe entire neighborhood was at the party. A mutual decision, to make it a celebration anyway. No one\u2019s quite sure for what, but we\u2019re trying to make something better as much as we can. It\u2019s an exercise in compassion, I suppose. We all know how disappointed he is; the thought of one of us going to the moon to build a base there, the first of the colonists . . . it\u2019s a childhood dream, and we got to be a part of it by proxy.\nChildhood dreams rarely involve, \u201cNot now, but later.\u201d\nMaybe that\u2019s what we\u2019re celebrating. That we\u2019ve come together enough for there to be a later, that we\u2019ve collectively developed the compassion not to let dreams get in the way of decency. That we have, as a society, decided to be adults. What use is it to go to the moon if the tides that moon influences are so very much larger than before, that they drown the coastlines beneath us, that they send entire nations into homelessness and want?\nIt may be an exhibition of smugness to celebrate selflessness, but the celebration is an indication of value. Marcus knows it too. I can see his shoulders relax as the night goes on, see his gestures become more open, hear the laughter without a tinge, at last, of bitterness. Part of that could be the booze, of course. Last year\u2019s cider has come in, the orchard next to the school well-tended. There\u2019s beer brewed from the hops grown on the roof of the community center, and of course everyone has a lemon tree. We can\u2019t sweeten lemonade with sugar anymore because it doesn\u2019t grow here, but there are beehives in the garden, and we get honey enough to substitute.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try making limoncello,\u201d Marcus says to me. He\u2019s brought over a plate because I\u2019ve had enough of standing for a bit, too much weight on my feet. \u201cJamie\u2019s been experimenting with the potatoes again, says she\u2019s got a good vodka going. I reckon if I can set up an air circulation system so far above the Earth, I can manage a still now.\u201d\nJamie and I share glances across the room and try not to laugh. Marcus has tried stills before. It never goes well. I remember a cucumber gin that was brown and tasted nothing like cucumbers. Marcus had drunk it anyway, trying not to wince. \u201cIt\u2019ll toughen the stomach,\u201d he said, but none of the rest of us were game. I mean really, wastefulness is a ridiculous thing but there are limits. He\u2019s not managed anything drinkable yet, but this party is to celebrate postponement as much as anything else: the idea that anything can be achieved with dedication and time, that a dream deferred isn\u2019t a dream given up on.\n\u201cHave they set a date yet?\u201d I ask him.\nMarcus shrugs. \u201cFor the next launch? No. It\u2019ll be a couple of years at least, I think, depending on how much carbon we can claw back.\u201d He smiles as he says it, and it\u2019s bittersweet. The local school kids had offered, earlier, to forego their yearly camp, wanting to contribute their share of carbon reduction so that he could get into space just a little earlier. The emissions from their transport might only be small, but every bit added up. He hadn\u2019t accepted, though we\u2019d all seen how touched he\u2019d been, and the kids had bargained down to some extra days of planting. The lawyer who made the muffins that Marcus so loathed\u2014there had been muffins tonight, brought as contribution to the meal and as usual demolished by everyone but him\u2014had a son who specialized in wetlands, and who was organizing to restore a small stream. The kids could help with that, both with planting and restocking the stream with eels and fish, and in return Marcus would visit the school and talk to them about disappointment, how to live with it and turn it into something better, and how it wasn\u2019t the end of dreams.\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he says. \u201cSet a date yet?\u201d It\u2019s a difficult question, and one I wouldn\u2019t have brought up on my own, not at a celebration that isn\u2019t about me. For Hannah\u2019s life to have the most impact, for her to be able to make her own great contribution, the birth would have to be carefully managed. Induction was set for only a few weeks away. Part of me couldn\u2019t wait to meet her, and the other part wished to keep her with me forever, elephantine pregnancy or not.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather not talk about it right now if that\u2019s alright. It\u2019s supposed to be a happy day.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be but it\u2019s not,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t look like that, I\u2019m doing my best. I\u2019m grateful for what I\u2019ve got, for the opportunities I\u2019ve had. But it\u2019s not the same.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a minute or two I\u2019m going to ask you to dance, if you think you can manage it. We\u2019ll spin about a bit and pretend to be happy until we are, or until we\u2019re as close as we can get. But before then, if you can spare an hour or so in the next few days, Matt would like to talk to you.\u201d\nMatt was his brother, an artist who I spoke to rarely these days because he preferred to spend his time in the garden tending to the greenhouses, and the humidity there made me uncomfortable now.\n\u201cSure thing. I haven\u2019t had much of a chance to talk to him tonight anyway.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Up we go then. Jesus. Are you sure you haven\u2019t expanded since this morning?\u201d\n\u201cYou bastard! I have not. I think.\u201d\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t expect me to dip you or anything. I don\u2019t think my back could take it.\u201d\n\u201cPity your feet can\u2019t,\u201d I say, tartly, and contrive to step on them at every second spin. It makes the both of us laugh, but me a little bit more.\nMarcus isn\u2019t the only one to visit the school and speak of disappointment. Honestly, I thought twice about it. Changed my mind more than once, but there\u2019s a responsibility, isn\u2019t there, and you can\u2019t argue for the value of compassion without being willing to receive the same. The kids might be young, but they deserve the dignity of being allowed to be kind.\nI went the week before Hannah was induced. That way they could feel her even if they couldn\u2019t see her, though of course I took along the ultrasound photos so they could see her face while she was still alive. I don\u2019t know how many of them have seen an adult cry before. I hope I\u2019m not the first. The questions are different from the ones I\u2019m used to.\n\u201cAre you going to have a birthday party?\u201d\nThat one hurts.\n\u201cHannah isn\u2019t going to live long enough to have a birthday party,\u201d I tell them.\nThis strikes them all as monstrously unfair. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d find myself laughing, but the absolute indignation on their faces is horribly funny. The conversation devolves into the kind of birthday cake that Hannah would like best, if she were able to live long enough for a birthday and solid food. I tell them how much I like strawberries and that\u2019s the decision-maker: a sponge cake stuffed with strawberries and cream.\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever eat one again. It\u2019s not their fault; they\u2019re doing the best they can. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m here for emotional support. That would be unfair to expect. They\u2019re only kids, that shouldn\u2019t be on them. It\u2019s important that they learn to feel for other people, to be comfortable with their emotions, but some things are as yet beyond them.\nOne of the kids asks about termination. She\u2019s twelve years old, and that\u2019s not a discussion I was expecting to have, but I\u2019ve always thought anyone old enough to ask a question should have it answered honestly. \u201cI thought about it,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI wondered if it would be kinder to let her go quietly, to let her go to sleep before she was old enough to be born. And I wondered if it would be kinder to me, if it would hurt less that way. I didn\u2019t know what to choose. I didn\u2019t think either choice was bad, and kind people would have helped me either way. But in the end, I decided that making it hurt less was maybe not so important. The only way to be hurt this badly when someone dies is to love them, and it\u2019s not good to live without loving someone. Grief isn\u2019t a bad thing. You\u2019re all going to feel it one day, if you haven\u2019t already, and it\u2019s important to be kind to yourself when you\u2019re sad, and to let people be kind to you, and to be kind to them when they are grieving too.\u201d\nIt was something I tried to remember when Hannah was born, and the school sent a packet of cards and drawings. I opened the first one and it said, \u201cWelcome Hannah! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, and I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t get to stay,\u201d and when I stopped bawling, I gave myself permission to pack up the rest and read them later, when her absence was an accomplished thing. (When that later came, months afterward, it was . . . I don\u2019t want to say it was a relief to read them, because relief isn\u2019t quite the word, but I was glad to see her acknowledged, her existence celebrated, because she deserved it, and so did I.)\nBefore Hannah passed, the nurses at the hospital made ink prints of her little hands, her little feet. I took them with me when I went back to the school to tell the story of what had happened to her. I told them about the child who had received her corneas, and how he would grow to see the world through a lens of generosity. I told them about the child who received her heart, and how he would grow to feel kindness pulsing through the world like a living thing. I told them about the child who received her lungs, and how she would breathe in the air of a world where all the living creatures were connected.\nThe kids asked if the grief was worth it.\nI told them that it was.\n\u201cI knew that Hannah might be able to help other people grieve a little less, perhaps, and that seemed like a good thing. I think if she were healthy, I would like to see her grow into a child as kind and clever as all of you. A kid who would help people if she could. I wanted to give her the chance to make a difference.\u201d\nI got home, feeling wrung out, and found a couple of bottles of limoncello left on my doorstep, from a man who had visited the same school not so long ago to speak of his own disappointment, who knew how it felt to flay yourself open before others and to stand upright, still, and accept instead of scream. I drank myself silly and sobbed into pillows until they were as covered with snot as I was, and I woke in the morning with a pounding headache and not much sense of relief.\nTwo days later I dropped back the empty bottles. \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d Marcus observed. \u201cWant to come weed the strawberries with me?\u201d\nHe\u2019d taken over my own volunteer hours at the community gardens, I\u2019d heard. Him and a few others, contributing what they could so that I\u2019d be able to have the time and space to grieve. I knew some people who wanted to work through their own trauma, who\u2019d wanted routine and labor and something to structure their days by, but that hadn\u2019t been me, and so my own needs had been quietly accommodated.\nIt had been a while since I\u2019d been to the gardens. I found it hard to remember when. The past few months had done for all my sense of time.\n\u201cI can\u2019t promise it\u2019ll make you feel better,\u201d he says.\nI go anyway, and it doesn\u2019t, at first.\nMarcus finds me in the memorial garden. It\u2019s not just for Hannah, though the sculpture his brother made to help me remember her is here, amidst all the other signs of remembering, for all the other grief and losses. The sculpture\u2019s a pretty thing. A little abstract for my tastes, perhaps, but there are times when I visit and see it out of the corner of my eye and the pieces seem to slot together and shimmer, somehow, and it looks like a shining bird about to take flight. Three years since she died, and the thought of her now makes me smile before anything else. I\u2019m considering trying again. I think I\u2019d like that. I think that Hannah would have liked being a sister.\nI know why he\u2019s here. Awkward, his hands not quite relaxed enough, wanting to be the first to tell me and not knowing that a friend had broken the news this morning, after she heard it from someone she worked with at the university, on the quiet.\nI smile at him, and it doesn\u2019t hurt. \u201cCarbon\u2019s under control again,\u201d I say, and Marcus winces.\n\u201cYou heard.\u201d\nExploration is important. Going to the moon is important, and people all over the world have been saving, so that there\u2019s a chance for others to go ahead. The space program\u2019s back on, the moon shot brought out of abeyance, albeit a year later than anticipated. Marcus\u2019 dream will be realized on Hannah\u2019s birthday.\n\u201cI can remember and be sad for me and still look ahead and be happy for you,\u201d I tell him. No one has been crass enough to tell me that life goes on, but it does, and that has come to be a comfort. There is comfort, too, in reciprocity, and how, in the past, he had put his sadness aside in service of mine. It would be shameful to do less.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather it were any other day, but it\u2019s not up to me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know that sounds like I\u2019m making this about myself.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a party,\u201d I say, because of course there is. Why wouldn\u2019t there be? It\u2019s something to be celebrated, that one of us is going to the moon. A member of our community, reaching for the stars. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be here for this one.\u201d\n\u201cFingers crossed,\u201d he says. He stands beside me, and we contemplate his brother\u2019s sculpture, the clean lines and intimations of it, the quiet beauty. \u201cI won\u2019t be upset if I hear you don\u2019t go.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll go.\u201d As if there was any question. \u201cWould you be upset if I brought a cake? I know you won\u2019t be there, but it\u2019s your party really.\u201d\nThe scent of strawberries wafts over the hedge, warm in sunlight. \u201cSomething with candles,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019d be lovely.\u201d\nOctavia Cade is a New Zealand writer.

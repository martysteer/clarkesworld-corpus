Time to tell.\nClarkesworld has always tried to cast a wide net in its search for stories. In recent years, thanks to the amazing efforts of Ken Liu and John Chu, we accomplished a long-desired goal of acquiring stories in translation. In April, I was presented with an opportunity to take our work in this area to the next level.\nI am pleased to announce that Clarkesworld has entered into an agreement with Storycom International Culture Communication Co., Ltd. to showcase a short story originally published in Chinese in every issue. Each month, an all-star team of professionals intricately familiar with Chinese short fiction will be recommending stories for this special feature and I\u2019ll select which ones get translated and published in each issue. This team includes:\n- Liu Cixin\u2014the most-famous science fiction writer in China and author of the THREE BODY TRILOGY\n- Yao Haijun\u2014Editor-in-Chief of Science Fiction World\n- Zhang Zhilu\u2014Scriptwriter at the China Film Group Corporation and one of the pioneering scriptwriters of science fiction movies in China\n- Wu Yan\u2014a Doctoral Supervisor for the Science Fiction Literature major at Beijing Normal University and President of World Chinese Science Fiction Association\n- Ken Liu\u2014Award-winning American science fiction writer\nAs it stands, our goal is to launch this new endeavor without giving up any of the existing fiction slots, including the extra story our Patreon supporters recently unlocked. To cover the additional cost of this content, we\u2019re going to need your support. Later this month, I intend to launch a Kickstarter campaign to cover the costs of the inaugural year: three stories in the first six months\u2014our ramp-up period\u2014and six stories in the following six months.\nA project like this is perfect for Kickstarter. No one has tried to make translation a regular element of a genre magazine before, and that\u2019s something I hope will be exciting to readers both domestic and international. My previous Kickstarter project\u2014funding Upgraded, which goes on sale later this month\u2014was very educational and provided me with the experience and confidence I\u2019ll need to succeed with this campaign. I feel rather strongly that Kickstarter should only be used to launch new initiatives and projects, so during that first year, we\u2019ll be focused on increasing our subscriber base to continue the program indefinitely.\nI\u2019d love to hear your initial thoughts. Obviously I\u2019m excited about this opportunity. I hope that you are, too.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

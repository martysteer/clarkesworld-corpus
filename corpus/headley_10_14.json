A normal-seeming man with a disturbingly full head of hair, and very red lips, neither young nor old.\n\u201cSurely you\u2019re not speaking to me,\u201d Louis says. He\u2019s on the Nile, crafting a landscape out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and paint. Each blade of grass is lined in bronze, and each scale of the crocodile\u2019s back is polished to a gleam.\n\u201cBoy-O,\u201d says the Devil, more formally. \u201cI need a stuffer.\u201d\n\u201cA stuffer?\u201d Louis shudders. He\u2019s busy positioning the tiny legs of an extinct lizard.\n\u201cA stuffer,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cA veritable stuffer.\u201d\nLouis looks up, exasperated. \u201cThat won\u2019t be me. I\u2019m the head taxidermist here at the museum. I\u2019m employed. You should place an advertisement,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might find someone new to the art, a student. Try the hat shops. There ought to be someone with experience in avians. If you\u2019ll excuse me, sir.\u201d\nThe Devil leans forward. \u201cIt\u2019s you I want, Boy-O,\u201d he insists. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me to hell.\u201d\nLouis makes a sound, but they\u2019re in the basement where no one can hear him. Though the table\u2019s covered with toxic powders, arsenical soap, and small blades, none of them are of any use. The Devil simply leans forward, pries open Louis\u2019 mouth, and climbs into his skin. The Devil becomes an armature for the flesh that has belonged to Louis his entire life, and then Louis is stuck, pinched against his own ribcage.\n\u201cHere we go now,\u201d says the Devil, using Louis\u2019 voice. \u201cPack up a nice valise, there, there. I\u2019ll return you to life among the living once we\u2019ve gotten this sorted, Boy-O, but hell\u2019s chock-full of pretty little ghosts, and they\u2019re going to waste.\u201d\n\u201cBut, what about Carl?\u201d Louis cries, from deep within himself. He\u2019s being forced to share his vocal cords with the Devil, and the Devil\u2019s voice booms.\n\u201cYou can leave Carl a note,\u201d says the Devil, and so Louis cribs out a message to his lover: Wait for me, I had to leave town, I won\u2019t be gone long, I\u2019ll explain, it\u2019s something about my soul.\nBut it isn\u2019t about Louis\u2019 soul. It\u2019s about the Devil\u2019s whimsy.\nDiscovery:\nOne cannot fill a ghost with sawdust and stuff it until it stands. It will sag and bulge, and after a short time, one will have not a proper mount, but an abomination akin to Frederick\u2019s Lion, eyes incorrectly aligned, teeth pushed out like falling fences.\nGhosts are the prettiest things in hell, and in that way, they\u2019re like songbirds, but when it comes to skinning and reassembling them, they\u2019re invertebrates. Louis knows that truth, here in his frenzy, attempting to stretch and gentle ghosts onto their forms. No. They refuse him. They collapse, puncture, snag, and tear.\nIt\u2019s nothing Louis could have known coming in, but they\u2019re boneless and as such, impossible. Were he allowed to embalm them, or to wet mount, yes, but not traditional taxidermy. The specimens refuse.\nHe tries clay, a heavy, old-fashioned mounting method, but the skin of ghosts is weightless and the clay shows through. He tries a wire armature, wrapped in wads of cotton, but the structure of the ghost, being rhetorical, refuses to commit to the wire, and just as he gets it stitched into position, it shudders and dissolves, leaving him covered in dust, a needle stabbed into his own thumb and out again the other side.\nHe sits for a moment, head in his hands, trying to calm himself, counting the hours in the waking world. How many years are passing above him as he sits here, trying to stuff spirits with sawdust? There will be Carl, and Carl will be missing him. Carl will be trimming his mustache shorter, and Carl will find someone new to love. Carl will walk with a swagger and then with a stick, and then Carl will die, and Louis will still be down here in hell, trying to preserve ghosts.\n\u201cI simply don\u2019t know what to do with this,\u201d he says to the curator, and the Devil\u2019s eyes glow a sickly greenish-orange.\n\u201cI want a collection for my trophy room,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cStuff my ghosts. That\u2019s what you\u2019re here for, and you\u2019re not going back until you\u2019ve done it, Boy-O.\u201d\n\u201cI could stuff a demon,\u201d says Louis, but it\u2019s a faint hope. The Devil will not give him a demon. The Devil only wants ghosts. The Devil has a roomful of tattered old things, and these are the things he wants mounted, properly and in a dignified fashion.\n\u201cLifelike poses,\u201d says the Devil, and Louis moans.\nDiscovery:\nOne cannot stretch the skin of a ghost over a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 armature, unless one wishes the ghost to dissolve into the Sunday funnies, or whatever the equivalent is here. The ghost will become one with the paper, and the taxidermist will be left raking his own skin with his fingernails, attempting to disengage the ghost from the machine.\nThere have, of course, been taxidermists in hell before. The ceiling of hell is decorated with a frozen flock of dodos, and when Louis mentions that dodos notably lacked the power of flight, the Devil says, \u201cThe taxidermists here are low rent. As you can see, I needed someone of a higher caliber.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are the good dead taxidermists?\u201d asks Louis.\n\u201cThe other place,\u201d says the Devil bitterly. \u201cOr so I imagine. There\u2019s a collector up there too, who claims them, no matter their sins.\u201d\nLouis considers for a moment the taxidermy of angels, and feels some relief that at least he doesn\u2019t have to do that. Though that would be like birds, and he started his career as a milliner. At least birds have skeletons. Presumably angels do too.\n\u201cWhat exactly is in that collection?\u201d he asks the Devil.\n\u201cOld souls, mostly,\u201d says the Devil, and shrugs. \u201cThere\u2019s a trophy room up there full of curiosities. I saw it once. Too brightly lit. You could see the seams, for all they pretend that art gets one closer to god. They have a couple of nicely done cherubim, though. I wouldn\u2019t mind a cherub, Boy-O, but they never come down here. Best I can get is a hecatoncheir, and you\u2019ve seen what a mess my previous stuffer made with that.\u201d\nLouis looks at the hundred-handed man and feels deep pity for the poor taxidermist who had to skin him. Still, even a hecatoncheir has bones. Louis feels more pity for himself.\nBefore him, a ghost collapses into a globule, and Louis puts his head down on the desk.\nDiscovery:\nOne may stitch up the skin of a ghost and then, using a paper straw, gently, gently inflate the ghost with helium.\n\u201cThat is not stuffed,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cThat is a balloon.\u201d\nThe ghost in question, sad-eyed and buoyant, bobs over the heads of hell, tied to a string, before eventually leaking and drooping, bent at the waist, a pitiful excuse for a trophy.\nLouis sits on the floor of hell, and hugs his knees. Carl will be at supper in white tie. Carl will be drinking champagne with Oscar Wilde. Carl will be happy to be rid of a troublesome lover whose fingernails smell of formalin. He will eat soft-poached eggs and open his beautiful eyes every morning upon the face of someone other than Louis.\nAbove Louis, the ghost wobbles and shrivels, emitting a hiss of escaping air. None of these ghosts are pretty. This ghost has bulging eyes and pinned-back ears. It was employed scaring vulnerable people to death, but some spiritualist eventually delivered a message to a murderer for it, and then it was appeased, exhausted and able to fade. There\u2019s a small metal plaque still to be affixed beneath it. The Devil\u2019s collection is diverse, but the ghosts are all like limp pieces of bridal veil left among moths.\nLouis looks enviously at the workings of hell, at the way the bony demons move, their spines and chitins, their tusks. He miserably fills a ghost with cotton balls, and watches it soak them. He fills another with smoke, carefully sealing its entrances and exits, but the smoke trickles out through the ghost\u2019s tear ducts, and the ghost looks mournfully at Louis.\nLouis looks back. \u201cYou\u2019re not alive,\u201d he says. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been in centuries.\u201d\nHe adjusts the goo of the eyeball, trying to stabilize it with wheat paste. He thinks of Carl\u2019s blue eyes, and of what Carl will look like when Carl is dead.\nDiscovery:\nOne may attempt to wet mount a ghost in a fashion wherein the ghost is encased in a vat, and the liquid suspending the ghost is tears. One cannot predict the behavior of the ghost once mounted in such a fashion, however, vatted in the liquid of the vale. One can predict that one will continue to cry. One is, after all, in hell.\nThe ghost\u2019s fingers drift against the glass, pressing and then releasing. The ghost somersaults, disintegrating in the saline, falling to pieces and filtering down to the bottom of the vessel. The Devil shakes his head.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cThat looks like algae. I want a whimsy. I want my collection to look playful, Boy-O.\u201d\nLouis looks at the Devil. The Devil smiles at him.\n\u201cWhimsies?\u201d says Louis.\nThis has now become the personal hell of Louis. Of course it has. Personal hells are the Devil\u2019s specialty. Louis is a builder of precise dioramas for museum displays. He\u2019d never put a mouse in a hat, nor a lizard in a gown. He would not force a bird to wear a breastplate. All he wants is to make the natural world unnaturally precious. His time in millinery was horrible, watching women leave the shop with birds perched out of context above their eyebrows. Now things are worse. Ghosts do not belong on walls.\nHe misses Carl. He funnels another tear from his eye and drains it into the vessel, where the remains of the dismal ghost sift downward like coffee grounds.\nHe pins a ribbon on the head of a ghost, and attempts to hold it up in an excitable pose. This ghost was a Roman senator. It looks wan, and when Louis picks it up, the ghost makes him sneeze. He tries to fill it with hot air, but it catches fire, and floats up toward the dodos. Things end in conflagration, and Louis prostrates himself on the floor of hell and weeps. All around him, demons douse dodos in kerosene. He prays for salvation, pitifully and without hope, as he tries to go to sleep.\nWhen Louis opens his eyes, his toes burning at some infernal flame, his skin parched, Carl is kneeling beside him, all blue-eyed calm, white suit, and lilac corsage.\n\u201cLouis,\u201d says Carl, and shakes him. \u201cStep lively. I\u2019ve come to take you home.\u201d\nLouis sits halfway up, panicked with relief, and then becomes convinced that Carl is a ghost. Louis grabs Carl\u2019s hand, and feels it in its glove, the softness of the moleskin. He looks around for The Devil. The Devil isn\u2019t visible.\n\u201cCarl?\u201d he says.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Carl. \u201cDid you think I\u2019d let you sell your soul?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sell my soul,\u201d says Louis, despairing. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in souls. I don\u2019t believe in Satan. I don\u2019t believe in God. Carl, you know who I am. I believe in science. How did I end up in the underworld? How did you?\u201d\n\u201cIt was a fuss to get here,\u201d Carl says. \u201cThere\u2019s no train to this part of hell anymore.\u201d\nLouis looks at him, bewildered. When has Carl ever been to hell? To Louis\u2019 knowledge, he\u2019s never even been to church.\n\u201cThe Devil has a pneumatic tube,\u201d Louis says. \u201cNot that that helps me. I have to taxidermy all these ghosts, and you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through.\u201d\nCarl picks up a limp ghost, and dandles it on his arm. The ghost unfurls like a shirt.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difficulty, here, Louis?\u201d says Carl. \u201cThis seems like it could be posed.\u201d\nLouis looks at the ghost, unrumpled, smooth and peaceful. The ghost seems soothed by Carl. Carl runs a hand over Louis\u2019 forehead and Louis feels the same. His mind twinges with suspicion, however.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get here, Carl?\u201d says Louis. \u201cHow\u2019d you know where I was?\u201d\n\u201cI took a carriage with some white horses,\u201d says Carl, and shrugs. \u201cIt came to my building.\u201d\nLouis touches Carl\u2019s cheek and it feels cool. He looks into Carl\u2019s eyes and Carl looks like his love. Carl moves to kiss him, and Louis finds himself lurching forward with a desperate hunger, and then wonders if he has become the Devil, if he is trying to dive into the divine, to become the armature that makes Carl move. He leans back.\nCarl kisses him anyway. He tastes like mint. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Louis,\u201d Carl says. \u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d\nLouis lets Carl help him to his feet, feeling their burnt bottoms crisp. His fingers are like claws and they snag on Carl\u2019s suit. He nearly sobs.\n\u201cWhat did you sell to get here, Carl?\u201d\n\u201cTry to calm down, Louis, dear. They just let me in,\u201d says Carl, and Louis looks at him for a moment, trying not to wonder.\nDiscovery:\nOne must ask a ghost\u2019s permission before one uses the knives and flenses. One must inquire as to the ghost\u2019s preferred method. If one does not, a ghost may convert into a pool of impossible ideas, or mutate into a lady\u2019s chiffon burnoose. One must steam and press the ghost, and then pat the ghost into position. One must pet the ghost and pose it, and one must not disregard the ghost\u2019s opinions, or one will risk ghost venom dribbled from tentacles, as well as luminous toxins, barbs, and boneless slither. No one wants to insult a ghost. One should have known that much.\nCarl strokes the cheek of the newly mounted ghost, the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 invisible beneath its skin. Louis hammers in the plaque. \u201cFever Haint,\u201d it reads. \u201cVirginia.\u201d The ghost raises a hand to its mouth, and screams a pale yellow silence, its body dissolving into tendrils.\n\u201cThis is lovely work,\u201d says Carl, as Louis assesses the heap of half-skinned ghosts before him. Carl has a glow about him, a hygiene that is the antithesis of hell.\nCarl may be something other than Carl.\nLouis mounts the ghost of a wooly mammoth. He cannot fathom why there was ever a wooly mammoth in hell, but it is a wooly mammoth hybridized to an amoeba, and as such, it drifts about the room, its fur and temper turned to plasma, and it has to be coaxed by Carl to allow sawdust into its seams. Elsewhere, Louis has taxidermied a jellyfish ghost ship found unanchored in the Atlantic and filled with bodies. Each of these bodies required its own negotiation. He has taxidermied the ghost remains of the goddess Echidna, though he was unable to tell what exactly she was until Carl shook out the moths from her folds. Part snake, part woman, a flesh eater and mother of gods, until thousands of years of underworld took her from amongst the cannibals and drew her into a hunger strike.\n\u201cA perfectly stunning drakaina, yes you are,\u201d says Carl, stroking Echidna\u2019s dragon tail, and Louis looks up at him, and feels anxious. Carl has not historically possessed knowledge of mythology, nor of anything, in truth, beyond cocktails and cravats. Carl has always been beautiful beyond his other skills. Louis, he now realizes, has underestimated his beloved.\nIt is Carl who has touched up the paint on the faces of the ghosts, Carl who has sculpted the ghost dioramas, Carl who has patiently leaned in and dabbed at sagging specters. It is Carl who possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of the levels of hell, Carl who periodically takes a sip of a fizzing drink a demon brought him.\nIt is Carl who is an honored guest in the underworld.\nIt is Carl who now makes Louis anxious. His beauty has long seemed unholy, but at home there was no reason to wonder.\n\u201cHave you been here before, Carl?\u201d\n\u201cTo hell?\u201d asks Carl, and smiles. \u201cOf course, Louis. Everyone who\u2019s anyone has been to hell.\u201d\nLouis hesitates. \u201cDo you happen to be from here?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d says Carl, and Louis thinks of how he\u2019s never met Carl\u2019s family. He hadn\u2019t expected to meet them, of course. He knew one day Carl would marry, and then, perhaps, at a tremendous Southern wedding, he might sit beside Carl\u2019s mother and toast her with a julep. Does Carl have parents at all?\n\u201cYou\u2019ve spent time here, then? Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d Louis has a piece of a tremendous lizard in his hands now, just the foot, as he attempts fruitlessly to position its tiny forearms and gigantic haunches. Draped over one shoulder, he\u2019s got a limp philosopher, and over the other a three-headed dog.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you needed to know,\u201d says Carl, calmly. \u201cHell was my Thursday evening for a time.\u201d\n\u201cWas this Oscar?\u201d asks Louis, forlorn. \u201cDid Oscar introduce you to him?\u201d\n\u201cOscar doesn\u2019t know the Devil,\u201d says Carl. \u201cOscar goes the other way. The Devil and I go way back, Louis. We\u2019ve known each other for years.\u201d\nThe Devil strolls into the room, looking pleasant, despite the bat wings that flutter about his shoulders.\n\u201cCarl!\u201d he says, and opens his arms. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed you down here. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d\n\u201cAs are you,\u201d says Carl, and they embrace with the certainty of every set of old lovers since the beginning of time.\nLouis watches, despair rising like water in a basement, covering over his memorabilia, drowning the steamer trunks of his ancestors, moldering his heirlooms. He silently laments as the Devil and Carl hold one another, leaning back to look into each other\u2019s faces. He thinks about how the Devil always calls him Boy-O.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you never told me,\u201d he says to Carl, and Carl shrugs.\n\u201cAlmost no one knows everything about anyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cEven the people they love. There are lacunae, and there are lies: these are the basic ones.\u201d\nThe Devil nods in solidarity.\nBut Louis imagined he knew Carl. He\u2019s spent his career removing the inner workings of animals, and filling them up with other things. If anyone knows everything about a creature, it is Louis. He now knows the soft machinery of all the ghosts in hell, and yet Carl is a mystery.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you understand why I had to bring you down here,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cCarl stopped returning my telegrams.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t end well, the Devil and I,\u201d says Carl.\n\u201cNo one does with me,\u201d says the Devil, with some regret. \u201cI tried to apologize, but I\u2019d gone too far.\u201d\nLouis stitches up the belly of the last ghost with fierce, tugging stitches. He looks up at Carl, who is petting the Devil\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Louis asks his lover. \u201cWho even are you?\u201d\nThe ghost Louis is holding begins to disintegrate, and Louis strokes its seams. \u201cStay,\u201d he says. He hammers its plaque in. \u201cSwamp Nightmare,\u201d it reads. \u201cLouisiana.\u201d\nCarl is glowing more brilliantly. He\u2019s a blue-eyed carnival. A variety of demons come to observe. Louis can see their little pitchers of accelerants. He readies himself to defend Carl, though all he has is a needle and thread.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Devil intercedes with his minions. \u201cNot Carl. Carl isn\u2019t for the flames today.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, if it makes you feel better,\u201d says Carl. \u201cFlames have never bothered me.\u201d\n\u201cI needn\u2019t see you burn again, dear one,\u201d says the Devil, and sighs. \u201cOnce was enough.\u201d The demons back away, disappointed. The air smells of burnt feathers.\n\u201cHow is your collection coming?\u201d the Devil asks Carl, tentatively. \u201cI think of it sometimes. I think of your seraph and your little flock of ophanim in particular. All those beautiful eyes spinning on their wheels.\u201d\nDiscovery:\nOne may, when falling in with God, miss the point. God, after all, would not, by common reckoning, be comfortable reclined across a bed in a small and tidy flat, drinking strong tea. God may not possess a navel, but that would be less than troubling, if one were a taxidermist and used to the beautiful oddities of nature. God may make love like an angel. God may make a man scream in disbelief. God may startle the Devil into saying \u2018darling\u2019 and \u2018dearest.\u2019\nThe Devil and Carl go off into one of the back rooms of hell, and Louis waits. When Carl emerges, he\u2019s wiping tears from his face, and when the Devil emerges, he is smiling bravely, abandoned again in the Underworld.\n\u201cBoy-O,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cLooks like Carl wants you up there.\u201d\nLouis looks around at the perfectly mounted hydra ghost, at the jellied mold of Dante, labeled simply \u201cCartographer,\u201d at the feathered phoenix ignitus interruptus.\n\u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m dying?\u201d asks Louis. He\u2019s only 28. At the museum he was in the middle of the Nile, and next, it would have been wild game, a particularly nice and nearly intact lion skin acquired from a dowager.\n\u201cDying isn\u2019t such an awful thing,\u201d says Carl, comforting him.\n\u201cDying is just a pneumatic tube,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cOne goes up, one down.\u201d\n\u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m dead?\u201d asks Louis.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in demand,\u201d says Carl. \u201cLook at your work.\u201d\nLouis looks down at his stomach instead, checking for a seam. There is none. \u201cAm I an angel?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be the official taxidermist. There are privileges to your position,\u201d says Carl. \u201cI\u2019m offering you your dream job, Louis.\u201d\nDiscovery:\nJob Description: All things bright and beautiful may be the aim of the collection, but one may, when falling in with God, never realize that one is being interviewed. God, all Alpha and Omega, all open-armed and bare-chested in one\u2019s bed, may never be discovered to be a collector on hiatus from his curation. Nature contains the tentacle and the thorn, the tusk, the membrane, the perfect dusty fish scales of butterfly wings. Nature contains the kissed, the loved and the employed, the insects. Heaven\u2019s inhabitants may only be examples of everything that has ever existed on Earth. A taxidermist in heaven must stitch and stuff, smooth and arrange. Sometimes he may return to the bed of the curator, and stay there a century, drifting in a sea of feathered reckoning. Then will he return to the eternal skinning and sewing of souls. Compensation commensurate to experience.\nLouis takes a moment.\n\u201cWhat if you die?\u201d Louis says, and then points at the Devil. \u201cWhat if he does?\u201d\n\u201cThen you preserve Carl and put Carl in the collection,\u201d says the Devil. \u201cOr me, for that matter. One day. You never know. I prefer a barbed wire armature.\u201d\n\u201cI like papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9,\u201d says Carl, \u201cthough if it\u2019s available you might be better served by making an armature of spun glass.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re kind, you\u2019ll bring me up to the higher place for display, Boy-O, when I go,\u201d says the Devil, and then he passes Louis his valise, and kisses him on the cheek in the prickly way one kisses the lover of one\u2019s love.\nA little scrap of ghost hangs out of the bag, and Louis tucks it in. If it is so ambitious, it deserves to ascend. He follows Carl into the pneumatic capsule, and then, with shocking speed, the great winds of heaven pull them up, and up, from beneath the skin of the Earth and into the vault of the sky.\nMaria Dahvana Headley is the author of the upcoming young adult skyship novel Magonia from HarperCollins, the dark fantasy/alt-history novel Queen of Kings, the internationally bestselling memoir The Year of Yes, and The End of the Sentence, a novella co-written with Kat Howard, from Subterranean.

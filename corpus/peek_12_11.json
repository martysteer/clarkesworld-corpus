A lab technician, he was born in Tripoli, and began working in the expansion of the Earth Empire at the age of sixteen, dying on a planet ninety seven percent water at the age of thirty four, having lived three years longer than myself. Pictures of him reveal an unassuming man, neither tall, nor overweight, nor blessed with a great or distinctive mind. Of his personal life, of his likes and dislikes, and of the small parts that make each of us an individual, history has nothing recorded. By the time I had been born, he had been dead for a century and humanity had been introduced to hundreds of new cultures and was struggling to establish itself. Asking for him to be anything but a cautionary tale amongst lab technicians was too much by then.\nThe story I heard was this:\nAmadou and fellow Libyan born researcher, Dr. Waled, were a pair of sweat-stained, badly dieted, over-worked men sharing a run-down house in Saire, the capital city of Tunel Five. Tunel was one of the first gift planets by the Ta\u2019La, a nomadic, pale-skinned, tall race that gifted the conquered planets they had no use for to other cultures. There, both men came into contact with a hemorrhagic virus named after the planet. It was the first incident between the two cultures and apologies were made, later. But, beneath the afternoon sun, far away from the official records, and feverish and with pains throughout their bodies, both men made the diagnosis and discussed the diluted state of the immune serum they had on the plastic table before them. They had enough for one shot each but, in the orange drenched evening, they acknowledged that their chances of survival were slim. As the sun darkened again and blood seeped from Amadou Qaramanli\u2019s eyes, he told Dr. Waled to take both doses.\nThe statue on the planet Tunel Five was funded by Dr. Waled after his return to Earth. For decades, the portly scientist told the story of Amadou\u2019s sacrifice, going as far to write about it in his self-published memoirs as a sacrifice for science, a technician\u2019s recognition of the importance of his role. It was a book that sold only to technicians, as Waled, apart from this one event, was an even more unremarkable man than his technician. Having read the book and understanding the tale I, when discovering that the door to the lab containing infected mice had not closed properly after I stepped out of my suit, and fearing Dr. Singh\u2019s response, took two shots of antibiotic cocktails, one for myself and one for the memory of Amadou.\nTwo hours later, alone in my room on board Sirius, I sneezed.\nThat was all.\nJohn Gale\nMaria, I am sorry.\nI thought to come home, to hold you, to touch you, to let the sun sink into my skin, turn me brown, but I cannot. You cannot see the destroyed station below me. You cannot know that it began with the body of Emily Parker, a middle-aged woman with dyed red hair. She was delivered to me by her parents, an elderly pair of Ta\u2019La ethnographers who pushed her into my theater on the back of a silver cart. They told me, as we lifted her, that the Ta\u2019La thought us callous because we mutilated our dead to learn how they had passed. They asked if I could be as gentle as possible with their daughter. As they spoke, Sirius orbited the dusty, red planet of Solle, a gift to the Earth Empire from the beings that saw us as cold and cruel; beings that let us rotate our personnel between the planet and the station, let us cut into the planet as we did our dead, examining it as we built atmospheric pressurizers on top of it, as we proved to them we could colonize the stars.\nOnly you are in my thoughts as I look upon the wreckage that my body now lies in. I wish we had done things differently. Parker followed her parents, or her parents followed her, I do not know which, but I felt your loss in their presence, so much so that while I noted the slight discoloration around the body\u2019s fingers and the gentle swelling in the stomach, I did not fully comprehend it. I would have cut if the head of the Science and Research Department, Dr. Anu Singh, had not strode in. He wore a yellow bio-hazard suit and his breath echoed with every step.\nIn quarantine, the parents apologized.\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t think,\u201d the father, Edward, said. His lined face sagged, as if the skin would drop away. \u201cThis is our first planet. Our\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe were just\u2014\u201d Trish, the mother, paused. \u201cShe was our only daughter,\u201d she finished quietly.\nMaria, I miss you.\nAnu Singh\nThe problem was simple: to that tall, skeleton race of nomads who wandered across the universe, we were biologically and culturally inferior. Their opinion was clear in the discoloration on Emily and Edward Parker\u2019s fingers, but you could also see how they underestimated us, did not fully understand us, yet. Trish Parker and John Gale did not have the same discoloration and the slight bloating in Emily was singular. As were John Gale\u2019s tumors, which were found inside the heart and argued a rapid onset with no pre-existing condition. Nothing suggested an epidemic yet, but after the death of a young boy who had no connection to Emily Parker, her parents, or John Gale, I took my concerns to the Station Commander, Bruce Cawell.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t quarantine the entire Sirius, doctor,\u201d he said, snappish in the way that elderly white Londoners are. A career soldier, his hair close cut and white, he sat before me in his sparse office and sipped water while the rim of Solle, a dirty, red-brown smear, grew outside. \u201cIt would panic people and only stop the planetside rotation from returning in nineteen days, days before, I might add, their food and water needs to be resupplied.\u201d\nI tried to impress upon him the fact that we had no idea what had caused it.\n\u201cWe have five deaths,\u201d he said, punctuating his diminishing patience by placing his glass down loudly. \u201cIt is tragic, but by your own admittance the boy\u2019s death may not even be connected to the first four.\u201d\nBeneath us is a planet with untold secrets, I told him. We bring into our quarantine labs rocks, soil, and the remains of anything we find that is interesting, but we do so like a child slapping blindly at blocks that need to go into a hole. The Ta\u2019La tell us that once, they conquered thousands of planets in a history that they wish to step away from. That they instead, now, wish to help the universe, to grow it, but to do so with a vision we cannot understand.\n\u201cI am aware that the Ta\u2019La are not always thoughtful with their gifts, doctor, but Sirius is fitted with very expensive and very state-of-the-art filters and monitoring systems. With none of those tripped, you are jumping to conclusions.\u201d\nI pressed him to acknowledge the possibility that a secondary infection, one that was droplet-based, could be carried through the system after being spread by sneezing or dust or mice.\n\u201cAre you missing any mice?\u201d he asked.\nNo, I told him.\nHe smiled faintly. \u201cPerhaps we can cross that one out, then.\u201d\nMy response, I admit, was not the most calculated. I have never dealt well with those who cannot see clearly. To my outburst, Commander Cawell straightened and his pale, cold eyes held mine. \u201cFive people have died, doctor. I am not making jokes. Nor am I humoring you anymore. New diseases on our own planet are found all the time, but we do not panic then, nor now. Your belief that the Ta\u2019La are responsible is misplaced.\u201d\nWhen I began to argue, he said, \u201cI suggest you return to your lab.\u201d\nMy hands curled around the plastic handles, furious.\n\u201cYou are dismissed,\u201d he said.\nOutside, I let out a frustrated breath. How could he be so blind? Already, I could feel a heaviness in the air, as if there was something new to it, something that we had not seen. Ahead of me in the hallway ran small air ducts, just as there were hundreds throughout Sirius, each of them linking back to a central system that was shared by everyone in the station. To me, it was already a beating, diseased heart, spreading the virus across the ship and my breath was a series of shallow, nervous gasps through my teeth as I made my way to my lab and the contamination suit within.\nI would live in it for six weeks, the longest of anyone on board Sirius, the longest of anyone who stands around me wordlessly now. Such was my prize for being right.\nBruce Cawell\nI did not believe that the Pakistani was right. It was a simple mistake, born from personal dislike.\nAt the time he approached me, Singh had been on board Sirius for just eight station months, an unpleasant replacement for the talented Dr. Ken. This far out into the system, colony stations are not given much choice about who is sent, and in my capacity of commander on this small bastion at the edge of civilization, I have worked with all kinds. The experience had made me more tolerant, though with Singh, it was if I was green all over again.\nHe arrived wanting to make a career for himself, a scientist who believed that it would take him a year to find a disease to make his name and gain tenure in a planet lab. He believed that the Ta\u2019La were killers, that they were involved in our slow genocide, and he wanted proof of that to take back home. Within weeks, he was pushing his lab workers, demanding results that could not happen, and asking for tests that were nothing short of invasive in both privacy and decency from those who returned from Solle. I had already been forced to intervene on two separate occasions when the doctor overstepped his mark. With a limited intelligence and an even more limited moral compass, Dr. Singh had rapidly become detestable not just to me, but the entire Sirius crew.\nMy mistake was that I could not see beyond that.\nWhen his staff informed me that the morning after our meeting he had appeared at work in a yellow biohazard suit, having walked the public corridors in it, my first instinct was to lock him up. He was clearly unfit for the duty that had been bestowed to him. When I started receiving calls not just from within the station, but from the planet, demanding to know what \u2018outbreak\u2019 had taken place, I took two soldiers and visited Singh\u2019s room after his scheduled hours. When I arrived, he was not there, and I unlocked the door to his unit to wait for him. Inside, I found it in disarray: the tables, chairs, clothes and bed were pushed up against the wall, hastily thrown to make room for a large map that covered the ground. It took me a moment to realize that it was Sirius itself, with five dots on it. The dots represented the paths that the deceased had traveled upon in their last day.\nIf it was airborne virus, I thought before stopping myself. With a shake of my head, I removed a chair from the pile against the wall and settled down to wait. Staring at the map for that time did not, I admit, help me believe I had made the right choice the day before, but I have already admitted my flaw and will not dwell on it. Perhaps events would have gone differently if I had remained there and stared at the map, if I had allowed Singh\u2019s paranoia to seep into me, but an alert was sent to me that a new body had been found and that the doctor, in his suit, was standing around unsuited technicians and crew, securing the area.\nOnce there, I said coldly, \u201cYou are frightening people.\u201d\nWe were standing in the bedroom of the deceased, beneath an air duct above the door. Singh, his eyes on it at all times, moved to stand in front of the window, the lower half of which was filled with the dirty shape of Solle.\n\u201cI will not be quiet,\u201d he replied, his voice carrying an echo from the suit. \u201cThis body, this new death\u2014this was not a man connected to any of the previous five. He was not even in the same part of the station! This does not affect just us, but those on Solle too!\u201d\n\u201cKeep your voice down, or I will have you locked up to keep calm.\u201d\n\u201cYou would not dare!\u201d\nI did.\nAfter I had placed him in his cell, Dr. Singh refused to remove his suit. This information, however, I used against him. I showed images of him to calm a panic that was emerging in Sirius and to assure those planetside that they could return normally, that supplies were fine. For a week, as normality returned, I was vindicated. But the deaths continued and Singh\u2019s words to me were repeated in whispers by others until they filled the station. When I returned to Singh, he was still in his suit, but he had nothing to say to me. To others, he would speak, but I was given only silence, and as pains began to wrack my body, I was relieved from command and spoken to by no one.\nA week later as I lay shivering in a hot bath that scalded my skin, my last sight was the burst of pressure as escape pods launched.\nAmanda Neal\nI was forced to quarantine the men and women who fell from Sirius not because of their infected state, but because I needed to ration our food and water and control access to the dig sites. Solle City, the only city on Solle, was a sprawling, skeletal creature filled with the remains of a conquering nomadic race and a second, extinct race that the Ta\u2019La did not acknowledge in their histories. If not for the bones, you would believe the Ta\u2019La had found the planet empty. The threat posed by the angry escapees, then, to this knowledge was unacceptable. In my arrogance, I believed that there was much to be learned about the Ta\u2019La through those remains, much that would make our dealings with them easier. Five years ago, I stood before a Ta\u2019La and watched the slow blink of its eyes, its naked, genderless body offering a cold indifference to all conversation made to it and I knew that if we wished to survive in a universe that was not just us, we had to know everything we could of those around us. We could not afford to view these creatures as ancient killers turned galactic shepherds.\nAfter overseeing the quarantine, I stepped into my office and called Sirius privately. As the call was put through, I laid the blame for the situation squarely at the feet of Dr. Singh, a detestable and incompetent man who, for a brief moment, I had thought would be an ally against Commander Cawell. Oh, how I would be eating my words again as I banded with the British soldier against the doctor.\nTo my surprise, however, the call connected me immediately with the image of Singh, sitting in a dirty yellow contamination suit.\n\u201cWhat is going on, doctor?\u201d\n\u201cNeal.\u201d He smiled, but it was a sickly. \u201cHow good it is to see you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I want to be briefed on what has happened and what is being done to ensure we can feed the people here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve met the Ta\u2019La.\u201d Singh\u2019s eyes closed, and he swayed; when he lifted his lids, the lack of balance in his physical form was present there, too. \u201cTell me, are they really like birds? People compare them to birds in the literature, and always favorably. They compare them to hawks and eagles, but they\u2019re wrong. I see that now. They should be compared to myna. That\u2019s a bird that drives off native birds with its violence, drives them off so that when it leaves an area\u2014if it leaves an area\u2014there is nothing but emptiness left behind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has happened on Sirius, doctor?\u201d\n\u201cEmily.\u201d A faint smile crossed his face. \u201cThat is what I call it. It is airborne. That is the most logical conclusion. There are no survivors and no serum and it manifests differently in everyone and leaves a complete genome in its victim, complete where it had before been incomplete in us since the dawn of time. It\u2019s not the same genome, either. That is what made it difficult for me to understand. It finds different strands in every single person.\u201d\nI frowned, but said nothing.\n\u201cIt is a swarm,\u201d he continued, his voice given rhythm by the drugs he had taken. \u201cA swarm of virions that completes what is inside us.\u201d\nI was thirty seven when I met my first Ta\u2019La, when I stood before it and watched as a man I admired tried to convey to it the importance of research, the responsibility we all had\u2014all creatures had\u2014to understand themselves and those around them. Afterward, he said that the being did not understand the double meaning of his words, the veiled threat that was implied in that small office, in that pale, peach-lit room where we were gifted Solle.\n\u201cDoctor, doctor,\u201d Singh whispered, pressing the glass of his contamination helmet to the screen. \u201cYou are alone, now.\u201d\nAnd then the screen went black.\nReverend Packer\nThe Lord will have to forgive my cowardice.\nI have prided myself on honesty, of not flinching away from difficult situations, of being true to the Lord and the tenants He has left us, especially here on the edges of civilization amongst the Godless. Yet, when Dr. Neal approached me and asked\u2014through her growing fever\u2014if I would return to Sirius, I agreed only because I thought it would save me. I could think of nothing else. I rejoiced when I was told that I would be given one of the few contamination suits we owned, that I would be taking a quarter of our remaining food and water, that I would be allowed to read the notes left by Dr. Singh and have access to the research done in the station. If a cross were but real upon me now, I would feel its weight, and be chastised by my thoughts.\nI shared the shuttle with Richard, a young blond man who had arrived with the colony on a scholarship from the military. He was the only \u2018scientist\u2019 capable of making the journey and it was to him that the deciphering of the notes and saving us would fall. I was but a pilot with a desire to learn. With notes from Dr. Neal strewn around us, we spoke little as we approached the orbiting mass of Sirius, until it was time to voice our fears at the sight the large, circular station adrift brokenly, as if a careless child had dropped it from a great height.\nIn awkward, slow movements, we drifted in bulky space suits from the shuttle to the exposed entrance of Sirius. Debris floated inside: frozen chairs, brittle boxes, cracked glasses. They broke beneath my hands as I pushed them aside to make our way to the command deck. It was there that we found, lodged against the ceiling in a tattered contamination suit, the remains of Dr. Singh. With a clumsy sign of the cross, I turned away from the terrible visage that he was, and tried to bring power back to the remains of the station.\nI could only find a small amount, enough to bring up the design map of Sirius. Disappointed, I made my way to Singh\u2019s laboratory, located in a fragment that curved above the command center. It took an hour to navigate to it, a journey that saw me ticking off the hopes and dreams I had. No wife, no children. I could hear Richard\u2019s voice through the suit, murmuring, and as we made our way through the quiet corridors, his words a repetition of knowledge he dare not forget, a sign of faith I no longer had. Finally, we reached a large white room adorned by floating beakers and frozen fluids. There was no power here, either, and my hope that I would be able to bring up a very basic amount to read what Singh had kept on file was not one that the Lord granted. Instead, there were only papers that crumbled beneath my every touch.\nI became sick when we returned to the shuttle. I took only one kindness, words from a young man who tried to treat me even as he became sick, that all signs of the infection pointed to a virus of such a virulent nature that, by killing us so quickly, it was also killing itself.\nBakana Mer\nI am the first and the last. The last of the first people that watched the huge, shuddering bulk of the Ta\u2019La cruisers press through the atmosphere of our home. The first people who experienced cruelty deliberate in the diseases sown into their gifts, the first who watched a people and culture destroyed so another could take it. Irony, oh irony, I am told by those new spirits, those who arrived here to take the Ta\u2019La gift, that their ancestors did the same, years ago. Then, they gave blankets riddled with diseases and, like the Ta\u2019La, took another\u2019s home to expand their own culture. As I listen to their words, I am unable to offer sympathy. They have died, yes, died from a stain rooted deep into my world, a world that is no longer filled with water, that no longer shimmers, and they are the victims to the thoughts of domination that motivate the Ta\u2019La; but they, in coming to my home, in accepting my world as their gift, have shown that they are nothing but a different shade of the people who killed me.\nHistory, I murmured to my child, does not chart a course in singular events, never to be repeated again.\nHer answer, I knew, was no longer one she could grow into.\nBen Peek is the Sydney based author of three novels, Twenty-Six\nLies/One Truth, Black Sheep, and most recently, Above/Below with Stephanie Campisi.\nHis short fiction has appeared in numerous publications, including\nanthologies and magazines such as Paper Cities, Polyhony, Leviathan, Forever Shores, Overland, Aurealis, and in numerous Year's Best anthologies.

Sturgeon Memorial Award\n Amazing how all Desi aunties are basically the same. Even when separated by vast oceans for a few generations. I mean, they fit into a few basic archetypes. There\u2019s the genuine-sweetheart proxy mother who, in between her late-night work shifts, always makes sure you and your friends have all the snacks you need. The manipulative gossiper, who conveniently keeps details of her own children\u2019s scandals nestled under her tongue. The nervous fidgeter who has spent three decades so worried that her basic thirty-year-old son won\u2019t ever find a wife that she forgets to teach him how to speak to women. The late-life hijabi, who pointedly replaces \u201cKhuda-hafiz\u201d with \u201cAllah-hafiz\u201d and \u201cthank you, beta\u201d with not just \u201cjazak-allah\u201d but the full on \u201cjazak allahu khayran.\u201d But which of these archetypes would find it appropriate to rent the body of a grown man halfway across the world?\n I pull the AirBody request from Meena Khan into view in my contacts. She\u2019s fifty-nine years old and from Karachi. Her short wavy hijab-less hair and her relaxed smile makes her seem content with life, so maybe she\u2019s the genuine-sweetheart type. Her only notes on the request are a list of Desi groceries and some cookware, which only reinforces the archetype. Maybe she\u2019s too ill to travel to visit family for Eid and wants to surprise them with a feast? It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gotten a taste of such a spread. I hit accept and watch the usual legalese flash before me:\n You acknowledge that you have the ability to observe, regain control, and remove your guests at any time and therefore may be complicit and responsible for any crimes or damage committed by your guests.\n I tap \u201cYes\u201d and begin to look through her grocery list more closely. Some of it, like the sweetened condensed milk, half-and-half, sugar and cardamom powder I can get at the regular grocery store. But for the Desi ghee and chanay ki daal, I either have to pay a premium at the hippie organic store downstairs or drive out to a Desi grocery store in the suburbs. A drive would help kill some time, so I choose the Desi grocery store.\n When I return, I arrange all the ingredients in alphabetical order on my otherwise bare gray marble kitchen counter and head to bed. Meena activates at 6 AM and I don\u2019t want to test AirBody\u2019s zero-tolerance late policy. I also don\u2019t want a review plagued with complaints of body odor and morning breath.\n My alarm goes off at 5 AM, but I snooze several times, stumbling in and out of a wildly vivid dream about riding on the back of a sea turtle. Except, I\u2019m not in the water. I think I might be floating through the sky. But, there are definitely other underwater creatures floating by, greeting us along the way. I feel love for the sea turtle and I lean over to kiss its rough green cheek when the snooze expires. Weird. But, my dreams have been odd since I started \u201cplaying host\u201d on weekends a few months ago.\n By 5:58 AM I\u2019m towel dried, clothed and somewhat fed\u2014a cookie is breakfast to some. I stand in front of the mirror as I clip the AirBody headset to the backs of my ears. It whirs on automatically\u2014it doesn\u2019t actually whir, but I imagine that\u2019s the microscopic sound it makes as the violet light pulses. It authenticates my identity and says \u201cHello, Arsalan. Your AirBody guest is in the waiting area. Are you ready?\u201d\n \u201cYup, I\u2019m ready,\u201d I say, trying to sound chipper, but nervous as fuck about what this will be like. This is my sixth time hosting and so far it\u2019s been a good distraction to get through my weekends. Most of my other guests have been men, usually here for some business meeting at the World Bank, or to tour the monuments and museums with their grandchildren. The only other woman I\u2019ve hosted was a lobbyist from an asteroid mining firm who didn\u2019t think a one-hour meeting with a congressperson was worth breaking orbit for.\n My limbs tingle as they go numb. I feel heavy for second, like I can\u2019t support my own weight and am about to fall. And I do, in a way. Not physically. More like falling asleep into a dream that makes so much sense that it\u2019s boring. Which is why, I suppose, AirBody lets hosts stream content and games to the neural UI while their guests go corporeal.\n I give Meena a few moments to adjust and watch her look around my living room. Her eyes stare at my mostly empty bookshelf surrounded by plain white walls. I don\u2019t have much decor, except for the tiger painting Ammi bought in Thailand when she visited once in her early twenties.\n \u201cHi!\u201d I say, my voice in the AirBody interface sounding way louder than I intend. I feel my heart rate increase and realize I must have scared her. \u201cSorry, I, uh, just wanted to say hello and let you know I\u2019m here to assist you during your stay if you need help.\u201d\n \u201cBeta, Urdu nahin boltay?\u201d\n Oh crap. Not only am I going to get a bad review for my poor Urdu language skills, I\u2019m now going to spend the next twenty-four hours meeting the scorn and judgment of a Pakistani aunty. Here we go.\n \u201cNahin, aunty, I\u2014\u201d I say slowly, preparing to flex my mind\u2019s tongue with words I haven\u2019t used in years.\n \u201cArray profile pe Urdu likha tha!\u201d\n Oh god, if I don\u2019t get removed after this listing, I need to delete Urdu from my language profile. If for nothing else, to escape this scorn. \u201cChalo, I\u2019m here. What can I do now?\u201d she says, waving my hands up in the air behind us. \u201cTake me to the kitchen, beta . . . you do have a kitchen, right?\u201d\n \u201cHaan, yes,\u201d I say, retaking control. My limbs tingle awake and I walk to the kitchen before handing her back control.\n I feel my body sigh and my head shake. \u201cThis will do,\u201d she says as she walks to the corner of the counter where I\u2019ve neatly arranged the ingredients she requested. She inspects them closely, as if she doesn\u2019t trust that I bought the right things. But, she doesn\u2019t make any complaints. She looks around the kitchen. There are a few dishes in the drying rack, but I made sure to clear out the sink, which is normally full until there\u2019s a noticeable rot.\n She begins opening cabinets, slowly and calmly at first. I assume she\u2019s looking for something specific, but after a moment I\u2019m sure she\u2019s just being nosey. She comes to the last one, the little corner cabinet, the only one to the right of the sink. Shit.\n I want to distract her, to keep her from opening it, but interfering with an experience without consent or a reasonable emergency would lead to a bad review. So I watch hopelessly as she swings the cabinet open and stares at the label on the little translucent bottle half full with brown liquid.\n \u201cWhiskey, beta? Tauba tauba,\u201d she says as she slaps each of my cheeks gently. \u201cAllah maf karay!\u201d I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s asking for forgiveness on my behalf, or if she somehow feels complicit in my sin by inhabiting my body. I mean, I\u2019m not drunk\u2014it\u2019s six in the morning. Now if she wills that whiskey into me, then maybe she\u2019d be complicit. Maybe.\n She shuts the cabinet, still shaking her head, and pulls open the electric pressure cooker. We both notice the inner pot hasn\u2019t been washed since the last time it was used, but only I know that this was many months ago. My eyes roll back into my head as she groans and clicks my tongue. She flicks on the tap and snatches the worn-out sponge on the edge of my sink. \u201cYeh koy tareeka hai, beta?\u201d\n She fills the pot with water so hot that I can feel the pain through the sensory suppression as she scrubs. I\u2019m convinced this is intentional punishment. Maybe she isn\u2019t the genuine-sweet type.\n She empties the dal into the pot slowly, as if she doesn\u2019t trust my eyes to check the quality of the product as a whole. The yellow pieces glint off the bottom of the worn metal, scattering into swirls as she shakes the bag to see if she can catch any unwanted particles.\n One piece of dal pops off the bowl and onto the floor and I feel a tinge of the panic that froze me the first time I made dal. Not knowing what to do as the orange but almost magenta grains spilled onto the counter and to the floor. The worthlessness that would melt me into a blob as I\u2019d hear Ammi\u2019s tired and exasperated voice say \u201cBeta, Arsalan, just once, would you do things without rushing?\u201d Her finger would point at the door. \u201cOut, now, if you can\u2019t help properly.\u201d\n \u201cSavvy for a ten year old,\u201d Nani would say as I\u2019d run to her lap before the tears began to flow.\n \u201cHaan, just as savvy as his useless father,\u201d Ammi would say.\n And then the fear of inadequacy would stand me up straight, wipe my tears, and walk me back into the kitchen defiantly, striding close enough to Ammi to move her out of the way without physically attacking her. I\u2019d sort it out. I\u2019d sift the dirt out of the fallen dal. I\u2019d get a jar to pour the extra back. And I\u2019d have dinner on the table before Ammi returned from her evening shift. I would not be my useless father.\n \u201cIs this right?\u201d Meena asks as she presses the buttons on the pressure cooker.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna soak the dal first?\u201d\n \u201cOh so now you\u2019re such a refined cook?\u201d\n \u201cI can make dal.\u201d\n \u201cThen tell me, why soak the dal? What difference does it make, aside from wasting two hours of our lives?\u201d\n \u201cWell it\u2019s just, what . . . it\u2019s just what you do.\u201d\n \u201cIs it now?\u201d She says, pressing start on the pressure cooker and effectively shutting me up. \u201cAcha, where\u2019s your janamaz beta? And the qibla is which direction?\u201d\n I\u2019m pretty sure I can feel a smirk on my face as she asks.\n \u201cInside the storage ottoman in the living room,\u201d I say, coolly, trying to remember which way Ammi faced last time she visited. I point at my east facing windows and say, \u201cAnd the qibla\u2019s out the window that way, a little to the right.\u201d\n She opens the ottoman and pulls the janamaz out. I feel her stiffen as she notices my fingers grayed in dust. \u201cThank you beta,\u201d she says, as she dusts off the janamaz and lays it out before the windows. I feel her swing my hands up to my ears before resting them high on my chest.\n Should she technically have put a dupatta on? Ammi\u2019s maroon ajrak one is still in the ottoman. The last time she was here I watched her throw it over her shoulder, say \u201cKeep to our own,\u201d and start her prayers before I could respond. We had just come home from lunch where I had finally introduced her to Karla. I sat on the couch and hunched over to inspect the lines on my palms where I had dug my nails in deep, hoping the pain would make the lunch go by faster. It didn\u2019t work.\n It wasn\u2019t so much that she and Karla didn\u2019t get along. It was more that each time Karla attempted to strike up conversation, Ammi just smiled at her and returned to her meal. Karla excused herself halfway through lunch, pretending she had just gotten called into the hospital to oversee an operation.\n I kept my eyes down as she left and didn\u2019t look up until a few moments later when Ammi said, \u201cYou know, the first time I met Eric\u2019s mother, she did the same to me, but without a smile.\u201d\n \u201cOh, so it\u2019s healthy to perpetuate this cycle, Ammi?\u201d\n \u201cI stuck it out. When Eric got up to use the restroom, his mom leaned over and asked me if \u2018your women still enjoy sex after your families circumcise you.\u2019\u201d Ammi sipped her tea and stared off somewhere above my head. \u201cI smiled back, swallowed the words in my throat, and stuck it out. I\u2019m glad Karla had the sense to run. She\u2019s smarter and stronger than I was.\u201d\n I sunk into my couch watching Ammi flow through the motions of prayer that I never felt at home in. I\u2019d happily keep to my own, if I knew who my own was.\n \u201cChalo beta,\u201d Meena says as she folds up the janamaz and puts it back into the dusty ottoman. \u201cLet see how much time is left on this thing.\u201d\n The red digits flash through the final sixty seconds.\n Meena clicks the depressurize button and watches, as if she\u2019s hypnotized by the plume of steam hissing out of the metal cylinder. I feel my ears perk up as she hones in on the sound. It\u2019s as if she hasn\u2019t seen or heard this in ages.\n \u201cDon\u2019t cook much anymore, eh?\u201d I say, realizing I should probably contain my snark. But I don\u2019t think she minds.\n \u201cNo, I cook almost every day. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m a bit deaf, so I\u2019ve forgotten how the steam speaks to you. If you pay attention to the hiss, you\u2019ll hear it tell you if the food is really ready, if it was cooked the way you intended, or if you\u2019ll be disappointed when the lid unlocks. And if you watch closely, you\u2019ll see how the steam interacts with the spirits in the air. If they gather toward the steam, you\u2019re cooking something delicious. If they flee, well . . . \u201d she shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s an old aunty secret.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re one of the most gullible saps I\u2019ve ever met, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t believe you, I just couldn\u2019t tell if you really believed it yourself.\u201d\n \u201cMhmm.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, well you let me know if you need anything. I\u2019m going to get some reading done.\u201d Really there\u2019s some gaming I need to catch up on, but she doesn\u2019t need to know that. I suppress my visual feed and replace it with CoreEra4. Time to level up. The sensory suppression filters out most of Meena\u2019s kitchen noise, until I hear the blender slicing through. I\u2019m curious why she needs a blender to make dal, but not curious enough to hit pause.\n I\u2019m pretty immersed in the game when I feel an almost pungent, but ultimately bland taste on my tongue. Meena\u2019s shoveled a bit of what she\u2019s done to this dal into my mouth. She massages the hot, dry musty paste into a lump as she lets each part of my tongue feel and inspect the texture. As it crumbles into the back of my throat, an aftertaste surfaces that reminds me of wanting to be kissed amidst an audience of 80s era wood paneling on neglected basement walls. An aftertaste on my anxiety-dried adolescent tongue, which had just uttered \u201cI\u2019d kiss you Eid Mubarak if you\u2019d let me.\u201d A line tacky enough to hold the confident fa\u00e7ade of my smile in place while I waited inside my head screaming what in the FUCK are you thinking?\n I can almost hear Hafza\u2019s laugh seeping in through my tongue and almost feel the slap that ended in an apologetic caress. My taste buds reverberate like the hair on the back of my neck when Hafza kissed the highest point of my cheekbone and then stared at me. I\u2019d never seen anyone\u2019s eyes so close. It was so overwhelming I had to close my own eyes. I\u2019m not sure if she had started or me, but after years of pining, that was the first time my lips finally melted into another\u2019s. And it would not be the last time I\u2019d be rudely interrupted mid-kiss. Before the moment was over, Ammi was shouting, \u201cArsalan beta, let\u2019s go!\u201d from the top of the staircase behind me. Hafza broke the kiss and leaned over to whisper \u201cEid Mubarak, Arsalan\u201d in my ear just before I jumped up, stunned by what had happened. The next thing I\u2019d say to Hafza would be \u201ccongratulations\u201d ten years later on her heavily decorated wedding stage, next to her heavily decorated new husband.\n Meena fills my mouth with water, washing my memory out. I ache for another taste of the musty paste. I want to go back for more, even though there is nothing to go back to.\n \u201cWhat was that? It tasted familiar.\u201d\n \u201cWell, mister expert, you\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n So I watch her set the pot on the stove above the lowest possible flame and plop in a few heaps of ghee. As it melts and simmers unevenly in the pot, she picks up the blender and begins scooping the paste out. The warm ghee spatters on the backs of my hands as the first few clumps land in the pot.\n My arm will no doubt be sore the next day, because for a while she just leans on the counter and stirs every few minutes, keeping the darkening paste on the bottom from sticking to the pot. Eventually she stops to add sugar, mixing it in evenly before flipping the paste over and pouring the rest of the sugar in. Once the white crystals disappear into the paste she scoops a spoon full out and closes my eyes as the warm sugary sensation hits my lips. I\u2019m flooded with images of Tupperware decorated by cold and soggy deep-fried finger foods and heavenly sweetened desserts. But, it\u2019s all dammed by the memory of Karla\u2019s voice asking the question, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just bring me home for Eid, like a normal person?\u201d\n \u201cAmmi\u2019s just not well,\u201d I had said, opening one dish and lifting it up. What dish was it?\n \u201cShe\u2019s well enough to have cooked all of this,\u201d Karla had said, gesturing to the to-go holiday foods.\n I plunged a spoon into the Tupperware and scooped up something and shoved it toward Karla\u2019s mouth. \u201cJust try a bite.\u201d\n Karla rolled her eyes and opened her mouth. Then, when the taste soaked into her tongue, she opened her eyes wide. Her eyes rolled again, but with pleasure this time. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d\n \u201cChanay-ki daal ka-halwa,\u201d I say into the AirBody UI.\n \u201cVery good!\u201d Meena stabs with her standard tone of condescension. She pours another can of condensed milk in and continues stirring. \u201cGustatory memory.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cTaste. It\u2019s got a peculiar way of triggering memory and emotion, don\u2019t you think? More so than other senses. Taste links us directly to our gut, where our deepest unfulfilled needs keep us hungry. Your gut tricks your mind into thinking you\u2019re getting what you want, when it\u2019s really just using you to get the\u2014\u201d she scoops up another bite and I feel my eyes roll back into my head \u201c\u2014mmm. The sweet halwa.\u201d\n She opens my eyes and looks down at the bright yellowy paste.\n \u201cBut, I remember this being brown whenever my Nani made it.\u201d\n \u201cHaan beta, just wait,\u201d she says as she preheats the oven to 400 degrees. When the oven beeps she slides the pan in and sets a timer for fifteen minutes.\n \u201cAcha beta, what kind of formal wear do you have?\u201d\n \u201cFormal wear?\u201d\n \u201cHaan, kurta pajama? Shalwar kameez? Whichever you\u2019d like to call it.\u201d\n \u201cUhhh . . . \u201d\n \u201cOh, of course. Well, at least put us in a pressed pant-shirt,\u201d she says handing me back control.\n \u201cSure,\u201d I say, heading back to my room to pull out some blue slacks and a new red and gray striped shirt I haven\u2019t worn yet.\n I stand before the mirror making final touches when she pings for control back.\n \u201cWell at least you\u2019ve got some color in your wardrobe.\u201d She picks up a pen from my dresser and writes down an address on the price tag I just ripped off of the shirt I put on. \u201cI need to go here.\u201d\n \u201cSounds good to me,\u201d I say as I feel her pass control back.\n As we make our way out of the city and onto the I-95 I glance at the sign for BWI Airport. The last time I was supposed to go to BWI was the last time I was supposed to see Karla. She had been away for work for a week and I was on my way to pick her up when I got a call from Ammi\u2019s doctor. My mind went single track and I skipped the exit for the airport and drove straight to the hospital in Philly where Ammi was taking her last breaths, alone. I made it in time to say goodbye, but not much else.\n Karla only called once that night. I stayed in Philly for six days and when I got back my place was emptied of Karla\u2019s things, which was most everything. If I had called to let her know what was going on, she would have understood, would have come up to help. I never figured out why we played this game of chicken. We\u2019d done it before. But, this time we both ran off the cliff and it felt right to let things rest at the bottom of the canyon rather than pick them up and rebuild.\n I pull up in front of the house and step out of the car, grabbing the dish of halwa along the way. The magenta sunset laces the gray house like a mesh dupatta. There are a lot of cars parked on the driveway and a bluster of muffled laughter coming through the windows of the brightly lit living room.\n As I get to the front door I hand back control and immediately feel my heart rate spike. She stares dead ahead, frozen still.\n \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n \u201cHaan, I just\u2014\u201d\n The door swings open to a woman dressed in a gray and blue shalwar kameez. She\u2019s still looking at her guests behind her and laughing. Her smile sticks as she turns to look at me. Her purple-streaked hair\u2019s tied up in a bun. She\u2019s probably a little younger than Meena, maybe late forties? I study her face to see if I can parse a family resemblance to Meena\u2019s profile picture.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, can I help you?\u201d the woman asks, leaning against her door jamb.\n I can feel Meena trying to push the air through my larynx and out of my mouth but it\u2019s sealed shut. Instead, she just lifts the dish of halwa and opens it.\n The woman leans forward and inspects the congealed brown paste. The sunset breeze blows a warm waft of the dish\u2019s scent into my nose.\n The woman looks back at me, but her eyebrows are strained around her eye sockets now. Without a word, she takes a step back and slams the door in my face.\n Meena stands there for a minute in my shaking body, with the halwa still cooling in the open air. She flattens the lid back onto the dish and lays a card on top of it. She puts the dish down gently onto the frilly brown \u201cWelcome Home\u201d mat. She picks up a small white rock from the side of the porch and places it on top of the card to keep it from flying away, before turning back to the car.\n As soon as I feel the first tear hit my cheek she stops.\n \u201cBeta, take us home.\u201d\n The tears stop as I take control, but I can still feel the strain in the back of my throat. This is the first time I\u2019ve wondered what happens when people hand me back control temporarily. Do they come back to life in their homes? Is she convulsing over her toilet, vomiting up as much of the regret as possible before curling into a ball of tears on her bathroom floor? Or is she lying peacefully, letting the tears soak into her veins until the pain passes.\n Once at home she requests control and immediately goes back to the cabinet in the corner, pulling out the bottle of whiskey and pouring it into a chipped glass she finds in my drying rack. She carries it in my shaking hands and walks to the armchair that faces the window. As the final moments of sunset fade away, I can see her staring back at me in the reflection of the window.\n She holds up the glass and stares into the brown liquid as she swirls it around.\n \u201cBeta,\u201d she says aloud. \u201cHow do you decide which one is right for you?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I respond, echoing in my own head.\n \u201cWhich drink? How did you know it was whiskey? Not Beer? Wine? Cocktail?\u201d\n \u201cWell, I drink them all, so\u2014\u201d I hesitate, uncertain of where this is going, \u201c\u2014but I don\u2019t drink much.\u201d\n \u201cHaan, beta, whatever.\u201d She smirks at me in the window and swings the whiskey full down my throat. I turn down the sensory suppression and feel the initial hit seep into my blood and loosen my muscles. She picks the bottle up from the table and pours another shot.\n \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, just need to process a bit.\u201d She lifts the glass, but sips at the whiskey this time. I assume the first time was purely for shock value.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal?\u201d\n \u201cMy deal, beta?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t beta me, I\u2019m a grown man.\u201d\n \u201cHaan,\u201d she pauses, scanning my sad apartment, \u201cof course you are.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you here? Who was that woman?\u201d\n \u201cJust an old acquaintance. It\u2019s not important.\u201d\n \u201cThen why me? Were there no other, more appropriate hosts available?\u201d\n \u201cAppropriate how?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, an older woman, someone more fitting your background?\u201d\n She laughs. \u201cMy background? Beta, you were the only \u2018Urdu speaking\u2019 host of Pakistani origin whose listing authorizes sexual behavior during a visit.\u201d\n Before I can respond there\u2019s a knock at the door.\n \u201cWere you expecting anyone, beta?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n She sets the glass down and goes to open the door. There is the woman, still in her gray and blue shalwar kameez, holding my dish with one hand and one hip. I watch my eyelids wrap around the woman in the doorway and make a shape I haven\u2019t seen them make in months.\n \u201cIs it still you, Meena?\u201d\n Meena nods, my larynx suddenly sealed shut once again.\n \u201cYou think you\u2019re quite clever, don\u2019t you?\u201d The woman walks into the apartment and slides the dish onto the counter. She pulls the lid off, revealing at least 2-3 servings worth gone. \u201cI\u2019m going to eat the rest on my own as well. I\u2019m not sharing.\u201d She smiles as she pulls off her dupatta and throws it at me.\n Meena catches it and laughs, finally loosening my throat. \u201cHaniya, I\u2014\u201d\n Haniya leans in quick to shut up Meena with a hard kiss that sends a chill down my spine and reverberates through the hairs on the back of my neck.\n It\u2019s been a while since I felt a kiss like that. In fact it\u2019s just flat out been a while for me. I wonder how long it\u2019d been for Meena and which matters more or if they\u2019re additive and while I try to figure that out they stumble onto the couch and eventually roll onto the floor.\n I shut my visual feed off, turn the sensory suppression back up, and do my best to give them some privacy. I won\u2019t lie, I didn\u2019t expect this guest to be the first to avail this \u201camenity.\u201d But, I can\u2019t entirely say I\u2019m surprised. Meena has a determined bitterness that obviously guards something terribly sweet.\n When I notice my heart rate begin to drop, I turn my visuals back on. They\u2019ve made it to my bed. Meena\u2019s lying on my back with Haniya\u2019s head resting on my shoulder. The room is quiet except for the sound of calming breaths.\n \u201cCome back,\u201d Meena squeezes out between breaths and into Haniya\u2019s hair.\n \u201cAs what, my love? Your assistant? Your cousin\u2019s friend visiting from the states? An NGO worker there for training that you\u2019re just showing around? What will you have me pretend to be this time?\u201d\n My throat locks up again as I feel blood rush to my cheeks.\n Haniya sits up and lets my blanket fall off of her as she stands. She looks back down at me with a slight smile. \u201cIt was nice to see you again Meena. I\u2019ve missed these stunts of yours.\u201d\n Meena just stares up at the ceiling while we listen to Haniya get dressed, slide the Tupperware off the counter and back onto her hip. Meena closes my eyes when we hear my apartment door open and shut. I\u2019m certain she\u2019s going to start crying again, but she just takes a deep breath and speaks.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll feel it one day.\u201d She rolls into sitting position at the edge of the bed and looks in the mirror. \u201cThe desire to go back to when you were uncertain about who you\u2019d turn out to be. When you lived foolishly thinking you could be something other than what you became in the end.\u201d She lifts my right fingertips to my forehead, twice, with a gentle pseudo bounce and says, \u201cThanks for the company, Arsalan. Khuda-hafiz.\u201d\n As my limbs tingle back to me, I pull up Karla\u2019s contact. While I mull the idea of calling her, I get an alert in my periphery from AirBody about a new request. I stare at Karla\u2019s picture for a moment before closing her profile and pulling up AirBody. I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve already become who I\u2019ll be in the end, so I might as well let everyone else be me for a little longer.\n Sameem Siddiqui is a speculative fiction writer currently living in the United States.

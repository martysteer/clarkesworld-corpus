I checked the time on my phone: 2:30 PM on the dot. He swerved to avoid an ad-covered utility pole, raised a hand in greeting, and placed my boxed lunch on the bench beside me.\n\u201cMaster Zhang,\u201d he said, \u201ceat it while it\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\u201cAre you busy Master Zhao?\u201d I inquired. \u201cWhy not take a load off?\u201d\n\u201cThis was my last delivery. I could rest a bit.\u201d\nI pulled apart disposable chopsticks and tucked into my Kung Pao Chicken with rice and veggies. Master Zhao sat opposite me. He produced a cigarette case, fished out a Yellow Crane Tower, and lit up. Ballsy scurried out of the shrubs, covered in leaves and dead grass. I called out to the Chinese mutt and he rushed happily over, then ran circuits around Master Zhao and me.\nMaster Zhao coughed. \u201cRegarding this little scamp, Master Zhang, if you take your noon walk tomorrow, steer clear of the pond near the south gate. There could be a . . . problem.\u201d\nI looked up from my meal. \u201cProblem?\u201d\nHe reached out to tease Ballsy. \u201cYeah, a problem.\u201d\nI chuckled. \u201cMaster Zhao, are you a geomancer? Does fortune-telling run in your family?\u201d\nHe shook his head, pointed at the south end of the rundown, low-cost housing estate with his cigarette butt. \u201cI don\u2019t know about all that. I\u2019m just saying don\u2019t go south tomorrow around noon. North is no problem, but don\u2019t go near the pond.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What could possibly happen?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe nothing.\u201d\nIt seemed he would say more, but that was it. I didn\u2019t press him.\n2\nI was unemployed, idling away my time at home, getting by on savings. I played DOTA every day \u2019til around 2 AM. Then I\u2019d sleep until the nearby primary school\u2019s noon bell. If it weren\u2019t for Ballsy needing to piss\u2014signaled by piteous cries from the living room\u2014I could\u2019ve slept until the CCTV news hour. I was a wretch with no good qualities. My studies were entirely forgotten. I\u2019d worked for a long time, advancement getting more difficult. My knowledge of the world was superficial, not deep enough to be useful or actionable. My dreams and aspirations were dead, my will to fight gone. My original plan, to muddle along and eat until I retired or died, had been preempted by my company\u2019s demise. Who\u2019d have thunk it? I prioritized sleep above all, became a lurker on the margins of society, locked in a kind of symbiosis with a two-year-old dog.\nThe days passed, lifeless as the Beijing winter. I felt disinclined to ponder anything but my dwindling savings account.\nIt was my daily custom to take Ballsy out for a noontime stroll. I wore headphones and played Tribal Wars. As I walked along, he ran all over the place, often vanishing. Most residents of the estate were old. After lunch they tended to retire for a siesta, so I didn\u2019t worry about disturbing anyone, and was glad of the solitude.\nI usually got tired around 2 PM and ordered food. I had my handful of preferred restaurants, and it was always the same delivery bros, but I found it hard to remember their names. Only Master Zhao stuck with me. One day he came crunching over the dead lawn, lifting a box of seasoned pork strips stir-fried with rice and veg, and said, \u201cMaster Zhang, your lunch has arrived. Eat it while it\u2019s hot.\u201d\nI smiled at the \u201cmaster\u201d appellation, which had fallen out of use years before. In the city where I grew up, \u201cmaster\u201d showed respect, back when simply working for your money conferred status. Nowadays everyone\u2019s \u201cmister\u201d or \u201cboss.\u201d \u201cMaster\u201d seems to have become an embellishment for the bike riding and key making trades.\nI found his name in the delivery app. \u201cThanks, Master Zhao.\u201d\nHe was 40 to 50 years old, with the appearance of a northerner, bags under his eyes, wrinkles deep, seemingly in low spirits. His smiles were always half-hearted. Having chatted several times already, I knew he was from Henan province, and that he lived with his wife near Marco Polo Bridge in southwest Beijing, where they ran a little snack counter. He was childless, and heavily addicted to nicotine. He\u2019d begun delivering food the previous July, had since been promoted to the rank of Golden Knight. He made 1 yuan 6 jiao per delivery. He worked every day. He was diligent and fast, earning just enough to get by.\nI tended to stay in my apartment and avoid people, but I didn\u2019t mind brief chats with Master Zhao. On the one hand, our daily encounters bred familiarity. On the other, there was something ineffable about the guy that made me want to know him better.\nTo reach my usual bench from the south gate you had to cross a grimy tract of lawn\u2014nominally a lawn, but because it was not maintained, it had become an expanse of weeds, rubbish, and scattered dog shit. The delivery bros usually detoured around it, sticking to pavement, but Old Zhao always took the shortcut. His pace was brisk, his gray leisure shoes never sullied. That day I said, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of stepping in something filthy?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cPay attention and you\u2019ll see.\u201d\nThe next day I watched Old Zhao take the same route, never looking down, only stepping on grass. He moved with a factory robot\u2019s precision, and was soon before me. \u201cHungry, Master Zhang? Eat while it\u2019s hot.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t once check your path,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you walk through there often?\u201d\n\u201cNot so much.\u201d\nIn the days that followed, I noted further mysteries. His electric bike never malfunctioned. His leisure shoes were forever immaculate. On rainy days he was always raincoated ahead of time. The meals in his insulated bag were always hot. I timed his deliveries three days in a row, and he was never off by more than a second. Once, when we were smoking and chatting, he suddenly stepped to the left. A dollop of bird shit splashed on the cement. I stared in amazement.\n\u201cWhat is it, Master Zhang?\u201d he said, like the feat had been unconscious.\nA common, unremarkable, middle-aged deliveryman. Perplexing indeed.\nIf my curiosity had been exuberant like a 12 year old\u2019s, I would have pursued the mystery. But I had retired from the affairs of life. The prospect of getting to the bottom of Zhao seemed tiresome.\nIn the final analysis, the guy just brought me lunch. I got used to him as the days dragged on.\n3\nMaster Zhao\u2019s injunction regarding the pond near the south gate was strange, of course. We interacted about five minutes per day, so we weren\u2019t bosom buddies. We weren\u2019t even close enough for casual joking. I finished eating that day, threw away the box, and with the matter in the back of my mind, returned home to game and sleep. I woke the next day as usual, to Ballsy\u2019s whimpering.\nI opened the curtain at 11 AM and beheld an average, smoggy day. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, scratched at my hair, threw on a down jacket over my pajamas, and took Ballsy downstairs.\nHe\u2019d been left behind by my former roommate, who\u2019d gone down to Guangzhou to start a new life. He left me the dog, a computer, and one year\u2019s rent, saying Ballsy couldn\u2019t fly, and the computer was too heavy to lug along. The rent money was payment for my stewardship of animal and machine. He planned to get settled down south, then return for Ballsy and the computer. I don\u2019t know if he was generous, heartless, or simply dim-witted. Four months after he left, I was honorably and gloriously unemployed. Now I lived in his flat, gamed on his computer, and walked his dog. Sometimes I felt like a stand-in for his Beijing life.\nBallsy had his shortcomings, mainly a lack of discipline and a penchant for thicket diving. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t dare range too far from me. He frequently checked in as I walked and gamed. On that fateful day, we took our usual route, a long circuit starting at the north end of the estate, moving southward and passing through the activity center, headed for my lunch spot. Looking up from my game, I saw we\u2019d arrived at the fountain near the south gate. This fountain had never spouted water as far as I knew. In the summer it was a pool of algae, in the winter a pit of dirty ice. It seemed to have no purpose except breeding mosquitoes. Ballsy was afraid of water and never went near the pond, but today, perhaps chasing some winged insect, he charged right in, as if possessed by evil spirits.\nI recalled Old Zhao\u2019s warning and cried out, \u201cBallsy!\u201d\nHe was already sliding across the dark gray ice. He glanced back at me, and I saw the crack opening around him. The ice popped, snapped, burst open. I broke into a sprint, but Ballsy was already gone. All that remained was a spinning mass of bubbles and broken ice on the water\u2019s surface. \u201cGoddamn idiot!\u201d I shouted, running wildly.\nA bamboo pole pierced the ice. Ballsy emerged, struggling violently in the water, scrabbling at the pole, and with its help he swam ashore.\nOld Zhao dropped the pole. There he was, in his raincoat, standing at the edge of the pond.\n\u201cZhao, how . . . how did you know . . . \u201d I realized I was stammering.\nBallsy shook off the water, crazed. Old Zhao didn\u2019t budge, raincoated against the deluge. \u201cHey, I warned you, and you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d He sighed, seeming disappointed. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t, so I had no choice but to drop by.\u201d He pulled an old blanket from his raincoat and tossed it to me.\nI caught the flannelette thing, green flowers on red background, and Ballsy charged over, shrieking. I wrapped him up and hugged him to my chest. He shivered like a newborn chick. \u201cLittle fool!\u201d I used the blanket to rub his head as I scolded him. \u201cStill wanna run all over the place? See what happens?\u201d\nOld Zhao lit up a Yellow Crane Tower. He offered me a plastic bag. \u201cGarlic shoots, shredded pork, rice and veg.\u201d\nI stared at him. \u201cHow did you know I was gonna order that today?\u201d\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m done with my lunch orders. Let\u2019s us two have a chat.\u201d\n\u201cI have some booze at home . . . \u201d\n\u201cI know. I brought drinking snacks . . . shelled peanuts and soy beef.\u201d\nI decided it was time to stop being amazed at Master Zhao\u2019s words. He seemed to know everything.\n4\nBack in our apartment, Ballsy made haste into the cardboard doggie flat I\u2019d constructed. I dropped a few strips of beef on the floor and left him to his own devices. I seated Master Zhao at the dining table, served the meal onto some plates, then went to the kitchen and found a big bottle of NiuLanShan twice-distilled sorghum. It was cooking liquor from the roommate era, but it would have to do.\nWe ate the garlic shoots and pork, then munched on peanuts and beef as we took a few draughts of the twice-distilled. I extracted an old box of Cuban cigars from the bookcase.\n\u201cThey\u2019re damp,\u201d Master Zhao warned.\nI tore the seal and opened the box, and sure enough the cigars smelled like mildewed socks.\nHe lit up a Yellow Crane Tower, took two more gulps of NiuLanShan, and drew on the cigarette. Finally, he deigned to speak: \u201cMaster Zhang, I know you\u2019re a trustworthy person, and you don\u2019t like to blab. But what I have to say . . . when you hear it, you may want to go out and tell people. But trust me, they won\u2019t believe you.\u201d\nI\u2019m no expert in drinking, so I was already red-faced, head pulsing and dizzy. But what he said half sobered me up. \u201cMaster Zhao, no matter what you tell me, I\u2019ll believe you. Call me convinced. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re a true seer. By all means, read my facial physiognomy, or do some spirit writing, or . . . do you use astrology?\u201d\nHe forced a smile, his crow\u2019s feet curving downward. \u201cNone of the above.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cIf I could read faces or palms, or do geomancy, I wouldn\u2019t be delivering lunches, would I? The summers are scorching, the winters goddamn freezing. It\u2019s hard work.\u201d\n\u201cThen how . . . \u201d\nMaster Zhao raised his paper cup and touched it to mine, then sipped the liquor. \u201cAll I know is we\u2019ve done this before. We\u2019ve drunk bland twice-distilled from paper cups, from a bottle long stored away.\u201d\n\u201cBut when have we drunk together before?\u201d I took a sip, and the liquor was indeed bland.\n\u201cAs far as you\u2019re concerned, never. As far as I\u2019m concerned . . . many times.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cI might seem like a commonplace man, but my brain . . . is unusual.\u201d He knocked the cup on his temple. \u201cI wasn\u2019t like this when I was younger. Let\u2019s see now, when did it start? About the time my wife got sick, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you have superpowers?\u201d\n\u201cSuperpowers? Well, I still deliver food, if that answers your question. It\u2019s like this . . . my brain moves faster than my body. My body stays put, but my brain moves on and experiences things. Unfortunately.\u201d\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\u201cI married early, left home early. Brought my wife to Wuhan when I was seventeen, looking for work. I moved cement at a construction site, she cooked meals for the workers. Wuhan, Changsha, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Shenzhen, Beijing . . . we\u2019ve lived many places, earning very little, always doing unskilled labor. We have no education. When we came to Beijing, housing costs were low, a tenth what they are now, so buying a house wasn\u2019t out of the question. We planned to open a small restaurant. She\u2019s an expert in frying noodles. I worked hard, didn\u2019t give a damn about fatigue, saving up for a house. Things were looking good, but the restaurant didn\u2019t happen. She got sick. She had these pains in her lower back, and her energy vanished. One night she wet the bed. I laughed and said she was just like a baby . . . I still can\u2019t believe I did that, but I didn\u2019t know how serious it was. She said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs, or move them. She was paralyzed. We went to the hospital and they said there was tumor growth in her spine. Excising would work, but the surgery was dangerous. If it went wrong, she could be paralyzed for life.\u201d\n\u201cMalignant tumors?\u201d\n\u201cYes and no. It\u2019s called neurofibroma. We had to spend the money we\u2019d saved for the restaurant and house. The surgery worked, she could feel her legs again, and eventually walk, work, earn money. Double happiness, right? We thought we were going to be fine. We worked and saved for several years. Back then we lived in a village outside Beijing, so we spent a lot of time on buses. One morning we lugged a bunch of stuff onto a bus . . . I guess it was a heavy load. I wasn\u2019t thinking. She complained of back pain and had trouble walking. I sent her home to rest while I went on to work. That afternoon she called from the hospital. I felt like a total heel. The fear was back, and I sat there trying to cry, but the tears wouldn\u2019t come. And I just kept thinking . . . why didn\u2019t I go back with her? Why hadn\u2019t I bothered to stay with her?\u201d\n\u201cShe relapsed?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly. The doctor said she had new neurofibromas, but this type of tumor grows quite readily, and if the growth is not in a vital place, it\u2019s not an issue. But if it\u2019s somewhere important, that\u2019s a problem. It turned out they were in the bone marrow, about the same as last time. She was soon paralyzed again. She said the same thing every day . . . don\u2019t bother with a cure, I don\u2019t want to live, just let me die. I knew she was thinking of the money, but I also knew she loved life more than anyone. And I wanted to save her.\u201d\n\u201cSo there was another surgery?\u201d\n\u201cYes, we sacrificed everything, and borrowed all over the place. This time her recovery was slow, but eventually she got up and walked. She improved day by day. I forbade her to do heavy work, or lift, or stoop too often. We moved to Fengtai. We still had a little bit of borrowed money left, and we opened a small snack counter, sold drinks, popsicles, smokes. The work was light, but we didn\u2019t earn much. Paying down those debts was a slow slog.\u201d\nThis was difficult to hear. I\u2019d always thought my life was hard, and I pretended not to see others\u2019 hardships. Now I felt depraved and extravagant. How could I go on as before with a clear conscience?\nI toasted him again and took a big gulp, my stomach protesting. \u201cTo better days. You\u2019re paying back the money, however slowly, and things will improve. I missed the time to buy a house in Beijing too, didn\u2019t I? Regardless, we can\u2019t afford it now, and real estate prices will keep going up. Why take it to heart? Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nMaster Zhao filled our cups, shook the bottle, and downed the last bit. \u201cYeah, we had a few good years. Last year she had her third relapse, in the marrow again, and this time we had no cash for surgery. I squatted on my heels outside the hospital, worrying, smoked four packs in one night. At dawn I lay down in a flower bed, but I couldn\u2019t sleep. The hospital needed tens of thousands of yuan. What could I do?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about this unusual brain of yours?\u201d I had no choice but to interrupt. The more pedestrian and grim his tale got, the more uncomfortable I felt.\n\u201cAt dawn, I noticed the traffic entering the hospital parking lot. They were all good cars, rich people, and suddenly I had an idea. I went to the road and found a crosswalk, and waited for a Benz. One came by soon enough and I threw myself in front of it, hoping to break a leg, or an arm, and secure a payday.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I suppose so. Didn\u2019t think of it that way, at the time. Anyway, the car was going too fast to brake. It hit me, ran me over, and then everything went black. Darkness, and then a bright light, and people all around me, a disorderly mob. I had a sinking feeling. Someone said, \u2018Does he have family? Quick, find his family!\u2019 That\u2019s when I knew I had died.\u201d\nI regarded Master Zhao and his cup of liquor. I couldn\u2019t help reaching out to touch the back of his hand. Warm.\n\u201cYou\u2019re . . . alive now.\u201d\n\u201cWho said otherwise? When I woke, I was still lying in the flower bed, not long after sunrise. Cars were entering the lot one by one. Behind me was the inpatient building. My wife was in the ward on the seventh floor, waiting for me to bring breakfast, and pay bills. Nothing had changed.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t tell if he was joking.\n\u201cDrink up.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what else to say. Thank god we had booze. Since ancient times, men have used it to dispel awkward moments, I suppose.\n5\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t actually die.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThen it was a dream?\u201d\n\u201cAlso a no.\u201d\nWe drained our cups, finished off the soy beef. I got up and snatched a bag of string squid from the cupboard.\n\u201cThere\u2019s beer in your fridge,\u201d Master Zhao said. \u201cYanjing.\u201d\nI dug around and sure enough found four cans of Yanjing in the back, behind some leftovers. I couldn\u2019t remember when they\u2019d been put there. Master Zhao was clearly more familiar with this flat than I was.\nOverheated by the twice-distilled, he took off his yellow overcoat and sweater. Beer in hand, he continued to speak:\n\u201cAt the time I was bewildered, dazed. I thought it was just a dream. I got soy milk and fried dough sticks at a breakfast stand, then went upstairs to see my wife. She scolded me for being late and letting her go hungry. I helped her eat, then went to speak with the doctor about bills. He explained that the fees were piling up day by day. The earlier the surgery, the better. If we proceeded within two months, that was fine, but waiting any longer could be dangerous. I thought long and hard, and decided the surgery had to happen no matter what. I started making calls to hit up friends and relatives for loans, but no one answered. Finally, I called my father. He said he had five thousand, which he\u2019d saved up for a pigpen heater. He also suggested I approach my maternal uncle, who was doing well in his business. I spoke with my wife, then bought a train ticket to my hometown.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you got the money?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my uncle didn\u2019t come through. He said he had everything in circulating capital. But he said he had a way for me to make some quick cash. He invited me to go to Xinjiang with him, said I could earn 120,000 in two months, travel and lodging provided.\u201d\n\u201cWow!\u201d\n\u201cI went, of course. Guess what kind of business it was . . . transporting heroin. Moving it from Tarbaghatay to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. In Beijing and Shanghai, heroin is out of fashion, but in Xinjiang and Gansu there\u2019s a booming trade. A hundred thousand per run. My uncle would escort the goods and take 80,000, I would drive and get twenty. Two months, six runs, 120,000, that was the plan.\u201d\n\u201cHold on, back up.\u201d I sat up straight. \u201cYou trafficked narcotics?\u201d\nMaster Zhao nodded.\nI coughed. \u201cDrug trafficking . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes, drug trafficking. For that kind of money, what choice did I have? It\u2019s 600 kilometers from Tarbaghatay to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. Drive through the night and you\u2019re done, in theory. But we were afraid of narco agents and their checkpoints, so we detoured, took smaller roads or just drove across open desert. Each run took a tense few days. The first two runs went off without a hitch, but the third time, at a gas station in Changji, we were stopped by police. Looking down the barrels of their guns, I just froze. I thought . . . this is it. I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll never see my wife again.\u201d\n\u201cDrug trafficking is a capital offense!\u201d\n\u201cYeah. We were just in time for the crackdown. And the death penalty.\u201d\nI massaged my temples. \u201cBut you\u2019re still alive.\u201d\nMaster Zhao grinned. \u201cYes I am. When I woke, I was on the train from Beijing to my hometown. Soon to arrive in Jiaozuo, Henan province. Five hundred kilometers from home.\u201d\n\u201cWait a second. You fell asleep on the train, on your way to hit up your uncle, and you dreamt you went to Xinjiang with him to traffic heroin, and were executed. Just so we\u2019re clear.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought at the time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d\n\u201cI arrived in Jiaozuo. I had a smoke and a drink and asked my uncle for a loan. He said his money was in circulating capital. He offered me a job in Xinjiang . . . 120,000 for two month\u2019s work.\u201d\n\u201cJust like the dream?\u201d\n\u201cJust so, and I was scared, believe me. I broke out in a cold sweat. I turned tail and ran. Went and told my father. He said I was losing my marbles, asked if I\u2019d been kicked in the head by a donkey. I told him how real the dream had been. I remembered the taste of the prison food, those awful steamed buns.\u201d\n\u201cSo it was just like the bumping into porcelain dream. Something that could happen. Your dreams have the power of foresight!\u201d I pounded the tabletop. \u201cThat\u2019s how you knew Ballsy would fall through the ice, how you knew about the Yanjings in my fridge!\u201d\nMaster Zhao blew a smoke ring.\n\u201cAm I right?\u201d I said, standing up excitedly.\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d\n\u201cDrink up, drink up.\u201d\n6\nThere are many things in the world science can\u2019t explain. Take disposable lighters for instance. They\u2019re always disappearing. Where do they go? And why are socks always getting mismatched? Why does the phone always ring at the exact moment you drop your drawers in front of the computer for a little self-gratification? I\u2019ve believed in the paranormal since I was a kid. I believed in a gray, unknown zone packed with everything humanity feared, and revered, and puzzled over. I was full of curiosity, but also scared. I fell back on reason at times, on superstition at others. When I was a kid there was Bigfoot, Area 51, the Loch Ness Monster, ghost photography, and later, the Blood of Saint Januarius, the Lost Dutchman\u2019s Gold Mine, and the Pisces Jade Event. I didn\u2019t dare call myself a mystic, but I was always ready to accept supernatural explanations.\nNow I was confronted by Master Zhao, a common laborer. I sensed something in his thin hair, crow\u2019s feet, sweat-stained collar, and atmosphere of booze and smokes: an enigma.\nFor the first time in several unemployed months, I felt alive. I was interested in something.\nWe touched cups and drank the first can of beer. Master Zhao didn\u2019t keep me in suspense. He fished a restaurant leaflet and ballpoint from his coat pocket, smoothed out the folds of the paper, and drew a straight line on the back. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to reason things out. Maybe this will help you understand.\u201d At one end of the line he added two strokes, an arrowhead.\nI pushed the food boxes aside. \u201cI\u2019m watching.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone like you lives day by day, from one point to the next, going straight.\u201d He moved the pen along the line.\nI nodded.\n\u201cMe . . . my brain goes faster than my body. I mean, my brain covers this stretch of road ahead of time.\u201d He drew a parallel dotted line and gave it an arrowhead. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually covered the distance, except in my mind. Of course, I believe it\u2019s real when it\u2019s happening. But it\u2019s not real. Understand so far?\u201d\nI nodded, but I had only a vague notion of what he meant. Master Zhao wasn\u2019t great at expressing himself. His phrasing was odd, and he lacked logic, so it was difficult for me to understand.\n\u201cThat first time, when the car hit me, I didn\u2019t go far.\u201d He drew a short dotted line with an arrowhead. \u201cThe second time, I was in Xinjiang a month. I went further.\u201d He drew a longer dotted arrow. \u201cBoth times in my mind.\u201d\n\u201cActually you never got hit by a car, and never trafficked drugs.\u201d I took the pen and drew two dotted arrows, originating with a solid arrow but moving off in different directions, so that the three arrows resembled a bird claw. \u201cLike this. Identical starting point, but the solid arrow is what actually happened.\u201d\nMaster Zhao ruminated. \u201cYes and no. My body followed the solid arrow, but my brain took both of those other routes. The smaller roads branched off the main one.\u201d\nHe drew another solid arrow, and extended a dotted arrow from either side, but starting at different points. Like tree branches.\n\u201cLike parallel universe theory, right? Important decisions cause your universe to branch others. After you experience them, the timelines close, and you return to the original timeline. In that case, they must have endpoints . . . death. Both were abnormal deaths.\u201d I drew Xs at the ends of both dotted arrows. \u201cHave you experienced a lot of those?\u201d\nMaster Zhao shook his head. \u201cWell, first off, they don\u2019t all end in death. As I said, it\u2019s my brain going faster than my body. Sometimes there\u2019s just this . . . flapping sound, and then I\u2019m back.\u201d He drew several more dotted lines, long and short, one with an arrowhead. \u201cYou want to know how many times . . . I can\u2019t recall clearly. I\u2019d better just continue with my story. You see, I got the five thousand from my father, and a bit more from other relatives, and returned to Beijing with ten thousand. It was just enough to cover the hospital fees we owed. My wife cried. She said, \u2018The poor die, that\u2019s just how it goes.\u2019 I took her home. We hadn\u2019t been back two days when she started suffering again, unbearable pain. She wanted to go back to the hospital. She scolded me, called me a good-for-nothing, said in all our years together she\u2019d never eaten anything good, just medicine. What could I do but stroke her hair and let her rant? One day on my way to work, I heard about a traditional Chinese doctor in Huanggang, Hubei province. People said he cured tumors that flared up over and over, like neurofibroma, with nothing more than acupuncture and traditional medicine. He was very popular with the nouveau riche of Beijing and Shanghai. Apparently it was all Audis and BMWs parked outside his single story house. I had twenty thousand yuan in construction wages. My wife agreed to go to Hubei. Of course, we\u2019d heard of all the medical scams, and we were afraid of being duped, but in the end we resolved to try. Anyway, maybe it was another dream timeline. I didn\u2019t know. I put her in her wheelchair, loaded our luggage on my back, and we got on a train to Huanggang.\u201d\n\u201cSo you knew about the branching lines at that point?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Thinking about it just confused me. I didn\u2019t dare think too much.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, you didn\u2019t know when a branch might\u2019ve started. You couldn\u2019t know if you were on one then.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I was living in fear. There was nothing to do but gamble.\u201d\n\u201cIf it was a branch, and the result was bad, at least you would eventually return to the main timeline and know what to avoid.\u201d I pondered this, shivering. \u201cBut if the result was bad and it turned out you were on the main timeline . . . then it was game over.\u201d I drew a big X at the end of the solid arrow.\n\u201cExactly. My imagination ran wild, despite myself. We got to Huanggang. The doctor only saw three patients a day. We waited a week to meet him. He took her pulse, and based on that alone he said we could relax, the disease was curable. One month to alleviate symptoms, three months to recover normal brain function and mood, half a year to reduce tumor growth, a year to get up and walk. I was so happy, so ready to believe, that I knelt before the doctor. We rented a room nearby. We went in every week for acupuncture, she drank the traditional medicines, and the doc used an infrared physiotherapy device to roast her lower back. I found a construction site to work at. She kept house, sometimes cooked, and half a year passed in a flash. She said that although she still couldn\u2019t walk, she could faintly feel her toes, and pain in her calves. She seemed to be recovering. It was working. Her mood improved. She scolded me less, and obviously I was pleased. One day the doc said we could stop with the acupuncture. She was to continue drinking the meds, and that would be enough. We returned to Beijing, and the meds periodically arrived from Huanggang.\u201d\n\u201cCured then!\u201d I couldn\u2019t help interrupting. \u201cOn the main timeline!\u201d\n\u201cFour months later, she was on the verge of death. She couldn\u2019t raise her head. Her speech was unclear. At the hospital, the doctor said her spinal neurofibroma had worsened, gone malignant. The time for a cure had passed. If we\u2019d come earlier for surgery, a cure still would\u2019ve been possible, but we\u2019d squandered our time. It\u2019s strange, you know. A good person can waste away to a human skeleton in one month\u2019s time. I\u2019d hoped for another year together, at least. She made it to the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, and she was gone. She scolded me a lot before she passed, not that I could really understand her. One afternoon she was muttering curses at me, then she stopped breathing.\u201d Master Zhao\u2019s tone was dull, indifferent. \u201cI walked out of the ward, sat in the corridor, and played the \u2018Fight the Landlord\u2019 card game on my phone until it ran out of power. With my phone dead, I suddenly didn\u2019t want to live.\u201d\n\u201cBut I remember your wife . . . alive. She\u2019s still at the snack counter by Marco Polo Bridge.\u201d\nMaster Zhao took a gulp of beer. \u201cYes. And I haven\u2019t attempted suicide. Everything went black, and I returned. It had all been fake, or a branch timeline, fortunately. Guess where I returned.\u201d\n\u201cDiscussing whether to go to Huanggang with your wife?\u201d\n\u201cAlready in Huanggang, having begun the acupuncture.\u201d He set down his beer can.\n\u201cSo you did visit that doctor?\u201d\n\u201cFortunately, we weren\u2019t too far into the treatment. I packed right away, and we returned to Beijing. She wasn\u2019t keen on this, of course. Scolded me the whole way, and I just took it. Before we left, I put a brick through that doctor\u2019s three-faced windowpane. Back in Beijing, I took her to the hospital, and it turned out there weren\u2019t any pathological changes yet. I booked the surgery, then took a train back to my hometown. I searched my uncle\u2019s courtyard at midnight, and stole fifty thousand yuan. He liked to hide cash in his AC housing. I heard him say so, when we were sentenced to death for drug trafficking. I didn\u2019t have to worry about him finding me. Before long, I knew, he would go to Xinjiang to move heroin, and get arrested, and sentenced. So yes, I stole fifty thousand from a relative. But he wasn\u2019t going to miss it, and I needed it.\u201d\nLaugh lines had appeared on Master Zhao\u2019s face. Maybe it was the booze, but suddenly I felt elated, and couldn\u2019t restrain a hearty laugh. We finished smoking the Yellow Crane Towers, then started in on the Cuban cigars. Actually, the flavor was passable. \u201cSo I was wrong,\u201d I said. \u201cThe bitter experience of the branch didn\u2019t help you on the main timeline. When you got back the bad choice had already been made.\u201d I doodled on the paper. \u201cIn other words, you could only do your utmost to remedy the situation. The timing was off.\u201d\n\u201cWell, no. At first, yes. Later it was different.\u201d\nThat piqued my interest. \u201cYou mean there were further developments?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right word.\u201d He scratched his neck. \u201cOkay, developments then. After my brain had finished running ahead and returned to my body, it was another point in time, right? I just . . . \u201d\n\u201cWait a second.\u201d My pen tip hovered. \u201cWait. You were done on the branch, you returned, and the main timeline had advanced. You returned after your departure point. That first time, the branch timeline was short, so it was unclear. The second time, you trafficked drugs for a month, and the main timeline advanced several days. The third time, you spent a year on the branch, treating your wife\u2019s illness, and the main timeline advanced what . . . two weeks?\u201d I drew lines radiating outward, then bending back and returning to the solid arrow. Dotted loops. Now the image resembled a tree branch sprouting leaves.\nThere were bits of solid timeline between the start and endpoints of the dotted loops. I pointed with the pen at one of these solid segments. \u201cOld Zhao, during these periods, when your brain is off on one of its jaunts . . . who\u2019s in your body playing the role of Master Zhao?\u201d\nHe stared blankly at my illustration.\n7\nWe got through half a can of beer in silence. Then Master Zhao said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s still me. My body continued doing what I would do, regardless.\u201d\nI crushed a beer can. \u201cLet\u2019s put this question aside, then. Continue, please . . . \u201d\n\u201cWell, my wife had the surgery. It was performed relatively early, so she recovered well, and left the hospital after half a month. The doc said the tumor growth in the marrow was arrested, and swelling was down. He said with physical therapy she would be able to walk again. But this time my wife was scared. She would sit all day on our heated brick bed, not moving. She\u2019d watch TV and chat and eat sunflower seeds, and play on her phone. I tried to make her do the therapy, but she said her back and legs hurt and she dared not move. If I argued she would get angry and start scolding me. In the end I decided we\u2019d been lucky. I let her convalesce how she liked and tried not to worry about it. I went back to work, but the construction project eventually went into a slump. The chief labor contractor had no more jobs for me. About this time I ran into a man named Chen from my home village, and we chatted. I\u2019d been studying some basic machine repair under the machine maintenance master at the construction site. Chen said electric bikes were a booming business, and suggested we open a shop. We partnered up. We had our business in Fengtai district, southwest Beijing. He sold bikes and batteries, I repaired bikes and changed out parts. The first year was not so great, but things slowly picked up in the second year.\u201d\n\u201cWas this the main timeline, or a branch?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting to that, don\u2019t worry. By the end of the third year, business was passable. I still had some debt, but my wife was happy, praising me for finally getting my act together and earning. One day, we sold two bikes just after opening for business. That afternoon we sold another, and another just before closing. With the repair earnings, we\u2019d raked in about three thousand yuan in one day. Old Chen was happy. He wouldn\u2019t let me go home, insisting we get drunk. We bought fifty yuan hot and spicy soup, closed the store, and drank the good stuff, Du Kang. We drank \u2019til about 2 AM, two and a half bottles. Old Chen was too drunk to stand. He passed out on the counter. I was blitzed myself, and wanted to do the same, but I knew my wife would worry if I didn\u2019t go home. So I locked up the shop, and not daring to ride a bike, I walked home. There was a freezing wind that night. I threw up many times on the way home. When I got back, my wife and I had words, then I slept like the dead until noon the next day. When I woke I couldn\u2019t find my phone. I reckoned it had to be back at the shop. I figured Chen was still there, so I wasn\u2019t worried. I had a leisurely lunch, then strolled outside. When I got to the corner there was a crowd. I thought there\u2019d been a traffic accident, so I squeezed through to have a look. A row of businesses had been burned down to charcoal. The street was covered in black ice. People said the fire had started at dawn, possibly from an electric heater short circuit. No one had been in the hot and spicy soup shop, or the jewelry store. Only the proprietor of the electric bike shop had burned to death inside. He hadn\u2019t been able to escape.\u201d\nJudging by his tone, it hadn\u2019t really happened. \u201cYou just couldn\u2019t catch a break. But it was a branch timeline, right? Master Zhao?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cYeah. I knelt on the ground and wept. I\u2019d locked the shutter gate from the outside. I\u2019d doomed Old Chen. I banged my skull on the cement, wanting to wake without delay. If I returned to the previous night, I wouldn\u2019t open that second bottle of Du Kang. I wouldn\u2019t let him sleep in the shop. My head was bleeding, and I was still there, crying out. If I didn\u2019t wake, what could I do? Not go on, that\u2019s for sure.\n\u201cBut you woke . . . \u201d\n\u201cYeah, suddenly I was back on the main timeline.\u201d\n\u201cBack drinking with Chen . . . \u201d\n\u201cNo. Much further back. Preparing to start the business with Old Chen. Searching for a location, and suppliers, and learning the bike repair trade.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t help a gasp of surprise. \u201cSo long . . . a branch timeline two to three years long . . . \u201d\n\u201cNone of it had been real. We never opened the shop, never earned all that money. But Old Chen was still alive.\u201d\n\u201cGod, that sense of unreality. If it was me . . . \u201d I couldn\u2019t find the words, couldn\u2019t imagine it.\n\u201cI wondered if I should still go in on the shop. If I did, would we still profit? If we did, would Old Chen still get drunk with me? If so, would Old Chen still die? I got scared the more I thought about it. I remembered our shop, burned to ash, and I couldn\u2019t look Old Chen in the eye. Talking with him, I felt guilty. I thought all night. At dawn I went to his place and said I couldn\u2019t go through with it after all. I told him to find a different partner. He was furious, of course. He wanted to beat me to a pulp. I thought, if it keeps him alive, let him do it. I was ready to take the beating. But in the end he didn\u2019t do it. Old Chen was a good guy.\u201d\n\u201cYou averted possible disaster, Master Zhao. You did the right thing. This time you used the branch timeline to obtain helpful information, and made the right decision on the main timeline. A success!\u201d My spirits lifted. \u201cYou can keep experiencing these branches, then reverse mistakes for smooth sailing on the main timeline. Maybe it\u2019s all for the best.\u201d\nMaster Zhao heaved a sigh. \u201cNo. My ability is useless.\u201d\nI drew a long, dotted loop, closed against a solid arrow. \u201cThis time you spent three years on a branch, while the main timeline only advanced a little bit. That\u2019s a substantial increase in branch time versus real time.\u201d\n\u201cThe more my mind runs ahead, the faster it goes.\u201d\n\u201cRight, like when I walk Ballsy. We take a fixed route, and he runs wild all over the place. Every so often he returns to my side. At first, the further he runs, the slower he returns. Later on he runs faster, until he could piss on all the utility poles in China in one minute, and I just think he\u2019s in a nearby shrub.\u201d\nMaster Zhao looked at my picture. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s about the shape of it.\u201d\nI dropped the pen and leaned back. \u201cThis ability is like time travel. You know that, right? I thought it was only possible in novels and movies. I never thought I\u2019d be sitting face to face with a real time traveler.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d happily switch places with you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI want nothing to do with this demonic ability.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I can tell, your biggest problem is not being able to sense when you\u2019ve branched.\u201d I thought for a moment, then drew a dotted line branching off a solid arrow. \u201cWhen you make a momentous decision, the timeline must split, right? Suppose you make a choice here.\u201d I made the dotted line divide, extending a dotted branch. \u201cAfter that you make other decisions.\u201d I made the dotted line branch several times, returning just one branch back to the solid arrow. I pointed out the dotted branches with no endings. \u201cAt last you discover these decisions are of no consequence. They\u2019re fictitious choices on a sham timeline, with no effect on the main timeline.\u201d\nMaster Zhao ruminated. \u201cYes, but at times I\u2019ve wondered if a branch can, in time, become a real timeline. Like this.\u201d He took the pen and made my dotted line solid, then crossed out the segment of main timeline between the branch\u2019s start and endpoint. Now it was like the solid arrow\u2019s middle section curved erratically, like an electrocardiogram\u2019s wave crest.\nI sensed a logical problem. \u201cYou\u2019re saying a series of choices on a branch could cause it to match up with the main timeline? In terms of . . . what? Some kind of degree of reality? Match up and even replace it? But how could that be? Then you wouldn\u2019t know if you\u2019d experienced a branch at all. You wouldn\u2019t have that moment of impact with the main timeline.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat other branches did you experience?\u201d\n\u201cMany. Among those I can remember, I worked as a hairdresser, on a factory assembly line, as a tour guide. I operated a backhoe, did pig farming, raised dogs, gambled, worked abroad, even robbed banks.\u201d\n\u201cRobbed banks?\u201d If it had been me, maybe I too would\u2019ve given it a try\u2014if I knew I was on a dotted line. But Master Zhao didn\u2019t seem like the type. I could only imagine him being compelled against his will to such an outrageous act.\n\u201cThe memories are hazy, but I needed the money. I feel like they were Postal Savings banks.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem ashamed. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve done many bad things. Luckily they were all on branches. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Bad people get what\u2019s coming to them, Master Zhang. Karma.\u201d\n\u201cHave you killed people?\u201d\nHe hesitated. \u201cWell . . . \u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, I just don\u2019t remember clearly. These branches . . . the last few are pretty clear. But the ten or twenty before that, or the last two hundred, I don\u2019t even know how many . . . I\u2019ve seen too much, Master Zhang. It\u2019s all mixed up, a fucking mess. My brain\u2019s not up to it.\u201d\nThe idea was terrifying. Every time he\u2019d branched, he\u2019d experienced those timelines, second by second, minute by minute. Several days here, a few years there. I couldn\u2019t know what it was like in Master Zhao\u2019s brain, what that mass of memory felt like, but obviously those sham days had left their mark on him. The branch timelines did not amount to zero, after all. They\u2019d happened, in some sense. This middle-aged person sitting across from me had not learned from a mere few score years of experience. He\u2019d been through the sum of those countless branches. Had he known centuries? Millennia? Tens of thousands of years?\nHe was truly a venerable elder.\n8\nI felt I needed some booze to dampen this reverence I was experiencing, but I couldn\u2019t find anything else in the apartment. We smoked up the cigars, then took turns on the peanuts, until we were down to the last one. Master Zhao applied chopsticks deftly, splitting the peanut in two. He took half, pensively contemplating it.\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat do you remember most clearly?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d better tell you about the hazy stuff first.\u201d He nibbled on his half-peanut. \u201cI mean, I did so much work, and encountered so many different people, people of low social status and higher-ups. Most days were unremarkable. Sometimes I helped people, sometimes I schemed for wealth. Money didn\u2019t really matter, in the end. My wife suffered regardless. The disease was incurable. Every few years she\u2019d relapse. Once, when I was really flush, I sent her to America for treatment. We had the best doctors, the priciest meds, and she got better. But of course she relapsed. I don\u2019t know how many times I watched her cry, saying she couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. She begged me to let her die. I knew she feared death, but I couldn\u2019t save her. No matter what I did, no matter where we lived, no matter what religion we adopted. At one point I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I divorced her. For rich or poor, in sickness and in health . . . I broke my vows. I ran. I got on a train to Guangzhou. The damp, warm atmosphere reminded me of her, her scent, the scent of our bed. I felt sick. I fell to the ground and couldn\u2019t breathe. Later I woke, and I was still in Beijing, in that rented flat, and I was hugging her. I didn\u2019t dare let go. She hit me, scolded me, called me crazy. The more she scolded me, the happier I was, because this at least had to be real.\u201d\n\u201cYour life was bound to hers.\u201d\n\u201cShe once said my ancestors owed hers a debt. In this life I was paying it off.\u201d Master Zhao\u2019s smile was pained, but happy. I\u2019d never seen such a complex expression. \u201cWhat I remember most clearly is opening the snack counter with her. I delivered orders, she kept house, went through two surgeries, and finally, when she was close to death, I brought her back to her hometown. We rented a house at the foot of a mountain. I cultivated Chinese cabbage and raised a few ducks. She couldn\u2019t stand, so I got her a tablet computer to play \u2018Fight the Landlord\u2019 on. I fed her. If the food was too hot or too cold, she scolded me. Or if it was too thick or too thin, too bland or salty, or when it was just right. She scolded me, and heaven and earth. I didn\u2019t mind. Actually I liked it. It meant she still had life in her. Toward the end we didn\u2019t bother with a hospital. She died on that brick bed. I stoked up the heat before I left, so she would be nice and warm on her journey, and not have to fear the cold.\u201d\nThis was the second time I\u2019d listened to Master Zhao describe his wife\u2019s death. His tone was unfeeling.\n\u201cI sent a gift to the village, had her buried in my ancestral tomb. It wasn\u2019t far from where I lived. Every few days I would go and sit by the tomb, and tell her about the cabbages and ducks. When I was 73 years old, my legs started to go, and I couldn\u2019t make it to the tomb anymore. I didn\u2019t want to live. It seemed good to die where I\u2019d been born. My bones could mingle with hers. We could be buried together.\u201d Master Zhao paused. \u201cWhen I woke, I was back in that rented flat in Beijing. It was late at night. I could smell her beside me, sleeping. I got up and had a cup of water. I checked the date. I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. I\u2019d lived scores of years, and they\u2019d been so real. For me they had been. All in vain. I recalled visiting the tomb, the cabbages and ducks, all that had happened before leaving Beijing, the surgeries, the snack counter, her, this day, our lunch, when we\u2019d discussed our situation, our lack of children, and what we would do when we grew old. She\u2019d said there was nothing to fear. She\u2019d suggested returning to our hometown and finding a single-story house to live in. Cultivate some vegetables, raise ducks, send a gift to the village head, and plan to be buried together. That\u2019s all I knew when I set out on that branch. I did as she wished, and we passed our days together. As far as she knew, an afternoon had passed since our decision. For me, it had been a lifetime.\u201d\n\u201cDozens of years,\u201d I said. \u201cHalf a day.\u201d\nMaster Zhao put down the chopsticks. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Master Zhang.\u201d His fingers trembled. \u201cI no longer know if my days are real or fake. If I\u2019m on a branch, nothing matters. No matter how beautiful a day, how lovely the scenery, in a wink it can cease to exist. If this is real, drinking and talking with you, it\u2019s all set in stone and can\u2019t be altered. This year, this month, this day, I could\u2019ve gotten better booze, eaten better food, found two beautiful women to chat with. Or stayed with my wife. It can\u2019t be changed. This day will soon be over, and never again return.\u201d\nI turned and looked out the window. The sun was westering. We\u2019d chatted all afternoon. For me, it was a few worthless hours in a completely pointless life. But from Master Zhao\u2019s point of view, these few hours seemed congealed, like chunks of lead, heavy, ice-cold, solid.\nI had to say something to dispel the bleak atmosphere. \u201cZhao . . . Master Zhao, you\u2019ve gone to the end many times, right? What\u2019s the oldest age you\u2019ve reached? Ninety? A hundred?\u201d I forced a smile.\nHe had to think about this. \u201cFive thousand and fifty years old,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I told you, sometimes I got in good with people of rank. I got rich. Once, after she passed, I had us frozen. Our doctors were to wait for a cure and resurrect us when the time was right. Well, five thousand years later, I came to. I hadn\u2019t expected it to take so long, of course. The world had changed, but the people still looked like people. But the place . . . was very different. It\u2019s hard for me to recall, let alone describe. I asked where my wife was. They told me she was still frozen. Curing her disease would be simple, they explained, but resurrecting her would not be so easy. I asked where we were, and they said in a new star system. No one lived at Sol anymore because disease was no longer a problem. For the same reason, there weren\u2019t many research scientists left. All anyone wanted to do was explore, probing further afield in the galaxy. They\u2019d thawed me out because my money was no longer valid. They\u2019d been discussing my situation for a thousand years, and finally decided to wake me. What could I tell them? I said I wanted to go on sleeping until they could bring her back. They needed more time to discuss this, maybe another thousand years, so they put me back on ice, and that was it.\u201d\nMaster Zhao took out a newspaper, drew an arrow, then a dotted branch with no endpoint to illustrate his long journey.\n\u201cFive thousand years,\u201d I said, struggling to put words together. \u201cSo how much time passed on the main timeline?\u201d\n\u201cI remember seeing news about cryonics. I discussed it with my wife, the possible application to our situation. If that was the branching point, then a dozen or so days passed in real time.\u201d\n9\n\u201cMaster Zhao, almost everything you\u2019ve told me is related to your wife.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a time traveler, you know. Without the burden of her, you could go further, not just in time but in space.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cYou could visit the future.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to see what the world looks like in ten thousand years? Fifty thousand? A hundred thousand?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would be the point?\u201d\nI realized he and I were on fundamentally different wavelengths. My curiosity, my fear and reverence . . . as far as he was concerned, they weren\u2019t worth a penny. He just wanted someone to share his odd travels with. A good listener was enough. I respected his devotion to his wife. I understood his choices, but ultimately, he didn\u2019t care to investigate the principles underlying his ability. He had no use for science. Attachment to family was at the core of him.\nHe was a commonplace time traveler. He couldn\u2019t change the world, and he didn\u2019t need to change himself. His far-ranging travels were utterly worthless to him.\nBut on second thought, if I were in his shoes, could I stand up to the weight of accumulated memory and time? I had no idea what so many years of tree ring growth did to a soul.\nBallsy woke, totally recovered from his pond trauma. He came to my side, tail wagging, expression bright and submissive. I opened a bag of treats for him. He went to his dog house and I surprised him with a few shreds of beef. Dogs aren\u2019t easy animals to understand. Sometimes they\u2019re forgetful, other times their memory is astonishing. Ballsy could sink into a brief despondency after I scolded him for misbehaving, but a little sleep and he was good as new. The next day he might make the same mistake and get the same scolding, and sink into the same depression. But last year our neighbor accidentally stepped on his forepaw. Since then, every time he sees that neighbor, he lifts his foreleg and plays the role of a disabled pooch, limping until the neighbor is gone. Amazing really, that kind of persistence in holding a grudge.\nTo a degree, people are similarly difficult to fathom.\n10\nI turned on the living room light. \u201cMaster Zhao, do you know if you\u2019re currently on a branch or the main timeline?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know if I\u2019m a living person, or some imagined character?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cHave you had your brain examined? I don\u2019t just mean a CT, but everything a neurologist can do?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Useless.\u201d\n\u201cIf I were inclined to believe everything you\u2019ve said, would you think I\u2019m crazy?\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not crazy, you\u2019re definitely not.\u201d\n\u201cThen, are you crazy?\u201d\nHe watched me, as if trying to guess the purpose of my words. \u201cIf you say I\u2019m not, then I\u2019m not.\u201d\nIt was getting cold in the flat, so he put on his sweater. I regarded the table, the remains of our feast. \u201cYou said you drank with me before. I guess you meant on a branch timeline. I guess you\u2019ve also rescued Ballsy before, and talked away the afternoon with me before . . . \u201d\n\u201cI was promoted to Golden Knight deliveryman. I began delivering food. I hadn\u2019t known you long when I felt you were someone I could talk to. Frankly, I\u2019d been looking for a long time. It\u2019s not easy hiding all this. But I was afraid. Of not being able to take back what I said. Of being considered mentally ill. If that happened on a branch, it wouldn\u2019t matter. But if it happened on the main timeline, I\u2019d lose my job. I\u2019d have no way to save up for my wife\u2019s treatments. We\u2019d be done for. The first time I came here to drink with you, we drank twice-distilled from paper cups.\u201d\n\u201cThe first time . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nA chill went through me. \u201cSo . . . how many times have we done this?\u201d\n\u201cMany.\u201d\n\u201cWhy me? I mean, you could chat with anyone about this stuff. There are twenty million people in Beijing. Why choose a random sod like me?\u201d\nMaster Zhao made as if to speak, then hesitated. He sipped some water. \u201cWhere to begin? Recently my brain problem has grown more serious. I\u2019m branching more and more often. I said \u2018recently.\u2019 Since becoming a Golden Knight, I don\u2019t even know how many times I\u2019ve branched. Every time it\u2019s long and short. On most of them I don\u2019t get to the end. It\u2019s just like now, I start to have second thoughts, and suddenly I\u2019m back in time, and everything that happened is just gone. I\u2019ve passed through hundreds or thousands of branches, while in the real world it\u2019s only been a few months. I\u2019m terrified there will come a day when, no matter how many times I branch, I\u2019ll no longer be able to advance through real time. I\u2019ll endure a lifetime, or ten lifetimes, or a thousand lifetimes, and really just live a day, or an hour, or a minute, or a second. My real time will forever slow, cluttered with ever more branchings . . . slower and slower, until it stops. I\u2019ll be trapped in that moment. Every time I return, I\u2019ll see the same scene, and not even have time to lift a finger before I branch again. Maybe I\u2019ll be sitting with my wife. I\u2019ll say something to her, take her hand, but I\u2019ll be on a branch. The sentence will be fake, the feel of her hand also fake. In real time I\u2019ll still be sitting there, looking at my wife. Frozen. Immobile.\u201d\nI tried to imagine such a frozen tableau, such profound incapacity, and I felt my heart would stop.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m on a branch, what will I return to?\u201d He extended his hand, as if feeling for an unseen button. \u201cWill all this still exist? This paper cup? Beijing? You?\u201d\nI contemplated my reflection in the diluted booze at the bottom of my cup. \u201cThese characters in your branches . . . are they alive, or some kind of illusion?\u201d I thought of the NPCs in my online games. \u201cIn terms of self-awareness, I feel like I\u2019m alive. There are contradictions in what you\u2019ve said. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re on a dotted line or a solid one, but your main timeline is still paused at several months ago. At least, that\u2019s the last return point you clearly remember, isn\u2019t it? Far from now, and this conversation. Doesn\u2019t that prove we\u2019re currently on a dotted line?\u201d\n\u201cThe only proof is if everything suddenly melts away!\u201d Master Zhao shouted, at his wit\u2019s end. \u201cI . . . I can\u2019t control this fucking brain! I have to take every day as real! Don\u2019t you see that?\u201d\nI thought I understood how he felt. If his main timeline was slowing down, it meant he might never get to the end of his real life. He would be trapped, cycling through endless dreamlands. I couldn\u2019t imagine a more profound despair. He had to steel himself. He had to find the courage to go on. He had no choice.\nI tried to organize my thoughts as I waited for him to calm down. \u201cMaster Zhao, I\u2019m sure no one can imagine what you\u2019re suffering. If it were me, I would\u2019ve gone mad long ago. I admire you.\u201d\nHe shook his head.\n\u201cIn my thirty-year life I\u2019ve never doubted \u2018existence\u2019 itself. I\u2019m just an ordinary person living on planet Earth, whether you\u2019re here or not. If you suddenly vanished, I would keep finding ways to believe in the paranormal, and continue living my ordinary, pathetic life. As for your concern that this might be a dotted line . . . well, it\u2019s real enough to me. Couldn\u2019t be more so. It can\u2019t just pop off like a TV during a power outage.\u201d\nHe scavenged a cigarette butt from the ashtray and gave it a sniff. \u201cSure, I know. I\u2019ve thought of this. It\u2019s possible the characters on my branches are as alive as anyone. And when I return to the main timeline, those branch people continue living. Maybe the branch versions of me go on as well. My brain might have this world-jumping defect, but I can still think things through.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like what I mentioned before . . . parallel universe theory.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not an educated man, so I can\u2019t speak to that. Listen, you asked why I chose you to talk with, over and over. Actually, I\u2019ve chatted with many people. Thousands. People I knew, strangers. I\u2019ve told my story many times. Not many sat through the whole tale. They all thought I was crazy and belonged in a mental hospital. A few, including my wife, made me go in for an evaluation. That was scary, let me tell you. I was afraid of injections, electroshock, and living with a group of lunatics. No one believed me. No one.\u201d\nI imagined the loneliness of this time traveler seeking people to open up to, throughout his various lifetimes.\n\u201cUntil I met you.\u201d Master Zhao lit the cigarette butt. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person to really hear me, to invite me home for a drink, to help me analyze these things. You said Beijing has twenty million people. That makes you quite exceptional, Master Zhang. You alone believe me.\u201d\nIt seemed like predestination. I didn\u2019t know if I should feel moved or terrified. \u201cSo it\u2019s the same with me every time? The same chat? Me saying the same things?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I can\u2019t recall clearly, but no, not exactly the same.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I believe you every time?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, more or less.\u201d\n\u201cWell then.\u201d Suddenly my life meant something, which gave me mixed feelings. A vague idea took shape: I\u2019d been a commonplace character since birth. Born to a common family, received a common education, common height and weight, common work, common unemployment, living with a common dog in a common apartment. How could I be of the least significance? I\u2019d considered many paths toward an upgraded life\u2014lottery fraud, pyramid schemes, starting a cult\u2014but they all involved dishonesty. Now here was this man declaring me the chosen one, one in twenty million. It was like something from The Matrix. It shouldn\u2019t be happening in real life.\nBut what if Master Zhao was a liar? That could explain everything. Maybe he thought me a stupid nouveau riche who didn\u2019t have to work, a fool who read paranormal magazines. He\u2019d surveilled my life and habits, concocted and practiced his fantastical story, and waited for his chance to dupe me. His tale was meant to arouse my curiosity, then he would make a demand I couldn\u2019t refuse.\nThe suspicion, once germinated, began to snowball. He\u2019d entered my apartment and found no money, but he\u2019d cased the place, noting things like the beers in the fridge. I walked Ballsy the same time every day, and usually didn\u2019t lock the door, so this would\u2019ve been easy. He\u2019d baited the pond, causing Ballsy\u2019s erratic charge, and lain in wait to rescue. He was a repeat offender, a new type of con man. A specialist in sci-fi, and the fleecing of otaku2 programmers.\nA cold sweat broke out on my forehead. I watched Zhao with heightened vigilance. He smoked the butt until it burned his trembling fingers, not much resembling a seasoned con artist. But he also didn\u2019t seem like a time traveler who\u2019d seen tens of thousands of worlds, locked in samsara. He just looked scared, and tired.\nIf he was a con man, where was his demand? Why wasn\u2019t he asking for my credit card number, or cell phone password, or bedside cupboard key? We\u2019d chatted long enough. It was time for him to cast his net.\nI waited, on tenterhooks. I wasn\u2019t afraid of getting duped. I was afraid of his amazing story being a lie.\n11\nMaster Zhao glanced out the window at the darkening sky. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve chatted away another afternoon, and I still don\u2019t understand any of it. Thanks for the company, regardless, and the food and booze. I should go home. Gotta prepare for the dinner deliveries.\u201d He stood, donning his bright yellow work coat.\n\u201cWhy not sit a bit longer? There\u2019s still plenty to talk about.\u201d\n\u201cGot bills to pay. Sorry.\u201d\nHe headed for the door, and I followed. At the door he turned and said, \u201cBy the way, Master Zhang, I have a favor to ask of you.\u201d\nHere it was. I struggled to maintain a serene tone: \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cThis is . . . \u201d He looked embarrassed. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t mind an intimate request from a stranger.\u201d\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cI need your help handling something.\u201d\nThe disappointment rose in me like a tide. I watched this sun-darkened middle-aged man, who\u2019d supposedly crisscrossed time and space, wipe his nose with a scrap of paper. \u201cHandle what?\u201d I said gloomily.\nHe hesitated. \u201cMaster Zhang, I will die tonight.\u201d\nI was surprised, to say the least. I\u2019d expected a tearful plea for money, a sob story about an accident, something like that. The common ploy of a con artist.\n\u201cTonight at 8:40 PM, in Zhengtong while delivering a meal, I\u2019ll be hit by an Audi running a red light. I\u2019ll fly ten meters, land, and break my neck. I\u2019ll die before the ambulance gets there.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . \u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve experienced it firsthand. You know that intersection, I think. The traffic is always a clusterfuck. And the cement is especially rough. I\u2019ll slide quite a ways. Very painful. After I became a Golden Knight, I endured this scene many times, died many times. I can\u2019t say for sure how many, but it hurt like hell every time.\u201d\nI studied his path-worn face, trying to judge his veracity. \u201cBut you can avoid it, surely. Just take the night off.\u201d\n\u201cThat time I made money and lived five thousand years . . . when I returned to the main timeline, I was already past the decision point. I\u2019d already taken the test. I was a Golden Knight deliveryman.\u201d His lips trembled, and I believed this wasn\u2019t a performance. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but afterward, no matter how I chose, life got harder. Nothing else works. I have to be a Knight to provide for my wife. It\u2019s like God is tired of playing with me. Like I\u2019ve been allotted this one path, and nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cSo if you take the night off . . . \u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried that many times. A freak combination of factors always results in an accident. It\u2019s always a car crash, always the same pain. Like there\u2019s a hand pushing me toward the same dead end, no matter what I do.\u201d\nI took out my phone and looked at the time: 7:45 PM. Less than an hour left. At that moment I decided to believe him. There was fear in his eyes, real fear, and despair and dread. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? You knew you\u2019d die at nine, but you went on chatting and drinking. If you\u2019d said something before, we might have thought of a way out for you.\u201d\nHe glared at me with frank, bloodshot eyes. \u201cAre we on a branch right now, or in real time? What does your gut tell you?\u201d\nI retreated a step. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . \u201d\n\u201cIf this is real time, I\u2019m not bound to die, because none of it has happened yet. If I\u2019m still in my broken brain, then dying doesn\u2019t matter, right?\u201d He let fly a hot, alcohol-laden belch. \u201cWhat can I do? Nothing, Master Zhang. Do you understand? Surely you must.\u201d\nI stood there in profound confusion, my brain a tangled mess of space-time arrows. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, avoiding his gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . \u201d\nHe hung his head, gasping for breath. \u201cAnyway, that leads me to my request.\u201d He grabbed my sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple one. From your balcony you can see the intersection by the district gate. In a little while, at 8:40, be there on the balcony. Watch. See if I die or not.\u201d\nI looked at him, mouth agape.\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about this a lot. There are a few possibilities . . . First, we\u2019re on a dotted line. I die and return to the main timeline, leaving nothing behind, and you cease to exist. Second, we\u2019re on a dotted line, I die but you remain, and you see where the ambulance takes my body. Third, we\u2019re on a dotted line, I avoid disaster, go on living, but die next time. Fourth, this is the main timeline, I avoid disaster, and go on living smoothly with my wife. Fifth, this is the main timeline, I get hit by the car and killed, and that\u2019s that. Lights out.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cSo, you sit on your balcony and watch. If at 8:40 there\u2019s no accident, and I make it through the night, then tomorrow I\u2019ll bring booze, the good stuff this time, and good meat, and find you. And the two of us will drink like fish until we\u2019re shit-faced. If . . . \u201d\n\u201cMaster Zhao, don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d\n\u201c . . . if I die, really die on the main timeline, then please go to my flat by the Marco Polo Bridge, Xiaoyue Gardens, building three, the most westward one near the grocery. My wife can\u2019t really walk. She\u2019ll be lying in our shop. Go around the checkout counter and find her, and tell her I\u2019m dead. She\u2019ll be worried if I\u2019ve been gone all night. Don\u2019t be afraid. Tell her the facts. She can take it. She\u2019s not one of those sensitive types prone to suicide. I hid a bit of cash in the AC casing, enough for her to get by a few more years. The people we owe don\u2019t know where we live. I die, the debts vanish, and she can live in peace for a while, even if she\u2019ll have to manage her own cooking and bathing. She never enjoyed good fortune with me. I\u2019m not worthy of her. If you have the time, visit her now and then, chat with her. She has a bad temper, but if you put up with it, you\u2019ll see she has a good heart.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t respond. I just stared, dumbfounded.\nMaster Zhao looked beaten and sad, but a smile emerged. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how many times I\u2019ve entrusted you with this. You agreed every time. And I\u2019ve never known the outcome. Nobody can know what happens after they die. Thank you, Master Zhang.\u201d\n\u201cMaster Zhao . . . you may not die. Nothing is certain!\u201d I went back to the dining table and ripped our drawings to pieces. \u201cAll we\u2019ve done is conjecture. No one really knows the future. Chance operates independently, beyond the effects of your dreamlands. We still don\u2019t know how it all works. It\u2019s too complex, full of paradoxes. How to recognize the branching points, how to choose, how to use previews to find optimal paths . . . I already have a lot of ideas. There might be many strategies . . . \u201d\nHis smile faded, leaving behind those mournful crow\u2019s feet. \u201cSince nobody can know, what are you afraid of?\u201d\n\u201cMaster Zhao . . . \u201d\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t die today, and stop dreaming, then I\u2019ll just live day by day, earnestly. Tomorrow I\u2019ll deliver a bunch of meals. I\u2019ll earn one yuan six jiao per delivery. Sixteen yuan for ten meals, a hundred and sixty yuan for a hundred. Rent, utilities, medicine. And if I die today, well . . . death ends all troubles. That\u2019s life. It\u2019s only my wife I can\u2019t let go of. If not for her, I would\u2019ve gone mad and simpleminded long ago. With her, I understand what people call \u2018life.\u2019 Again, Master Zhang, I\u2019m sorry to trouble you with all this.\u201d\nThe hallway\u2019s cold draught poured in. I closed my eyes. The door closed, and Master Zhao vanished into the winter night.\n12\nI sat in the dark and drew a solid arrow. No branches, no intersections. Later I could play DOTA into the wee hours, then sleep until noon, then take Ballsy downstairs for a walk. I could order twice-cooked pork with rice and veg, and sit on my bench and eat. I could proceed with this hopeless life until my savings account was drained. Or until there was just enough left for a plane ticket. I could quit my classmate\u2019s flat, pack his computer and dog, and head south to seek shelter with him. Smell the dank air of Guangzhou, become self-reliant and live something like a good life. Or I could take the ticket money and eat a great feast, then buy a train ticket back to my hometown. Ballsy was a rural mutt, after all. An idyllic, pastoral life would suit him.\nPerhaps Master Zhao was a mysterious mental time traveler. Or maybe a profound swindler. Or just a madman.\nMaybe my life was illusory, and of no consequence. Maybe I\u2019d live until the end of time. Maybe there were ten thousand tactics for dealing with branching timelines. Maybe tragedy was preordained. It didn\u2019t matter. Master Zhao was right. All you could do was live day by day.\nI sat in the cold early evening, watching Beijing light up. On that balcony, in an unremarkable corner of Beijing, I watched the traffic signals flicker below. There was the chaotic intersection, cars coming and going, the usual hubbub. I didn\u2019t know which yellow overcoated Knight was Master Zhao, and I couldn\u2019t distinguish an Audi in the rivers of cars.\nI waited a spell, not knowing if the accident was nigh. The victim himself had requested I watch, now, and in many other instances of his samsara.\nIf you removed the arrows of time, his story was rather simple: the story of a man and a woman. Remove either of them, and the curtain might\u2019ve dropped long ago. Was there a similar tale beneath every streetlight of Beijing, so simple and complex, brief yet long, carelessly begun and never finished? The hands of the clock ticked toward 8:40. It was close, whatever was to be.\nFootnotes:\n1 - \u201cBumping into porcelain\u201d is a widespread moneymaking scheme in China.

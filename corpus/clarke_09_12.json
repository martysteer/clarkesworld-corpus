I\u2019m still on the mend from my heart attack, but doing well enough to keep my doctors pleased.\n I had hoped to spend the first weekend in September in Chicago, the site of this year\u2019s Worldcon and the Hugo Award Ceremony. Instead, I\u2019m spending the weekend at home. It would have been nice to meet with friends and participate on panels, but given my current situation, several people expressed concern about attending the Hugo ceremony. They are most likely correct.\n I\u2019m very grateful to be a nominee this year and would have loved to have participated. Award ceremonies can be stressful, even when you don\u2019t expect to win. Should I win, I\u2019ve asked Kate Baker to attend on my behalf. It\u2019s not fair to ask someone to do that unless you are prepared to give them an acceptance speech to read. My first draft simply read, \u201cIf anyone out there is watching the ceremony in NJ, please have them send an ambulance to my house.\u201d The final version was more appropriate.\n Speaking of awards, the World Fantasy Award nominees were announced a few weeks ago and we received some great news (that I obviously survived):\n \n Best Short Story Nominee: \u201cThe Anarchist Wasps and the Cartographer Bees\u201d by E. Lily Yu, Clarkesworld issue #55\n Best Novella: \u201cSilently and Very Fast\u201d by Catherynne M. Valente, Clarkesworld issues #61-63 and WFSA Press\n Special Award, Non-Professional: Kate Baker, Neil Clarke, Cheryl Morgan & Sean Wallace, for Clarkesworld\n \n This is the third time we\u2019ve been nominated for a Special Award and, as usual, the competition is pretty tough. What makes us eligible for non-professional status? The easiest way to put it is that none of us do this for a living. After any significant life-threatening event, like a heart attack, you\u2019ll end up spending a lot of time reevaluating your priorities in life.\n I\u2019ve always dreamed that someday Clarkesworld would reach the point where the staff and I would get paid a reasonable wage. That dream has evolved into something more concrete. Becoming \u201cprofessional\u201d is now a goal.\n To my knowledge, there hasn\u2019t been an independent online magazine that has successfully made the jump to paying authors and staff professional rates without dipping into the publisher\u2019s pockets or becoming a patron of some other organization. This doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done.\n In fact, with our current infrastructure for esubscriptions via Amazon and Weightless Books, it\u2019s within the realm of possibility. Increasing our subscriber base, improving the stability of our advertising revenue, and restoring our annual anthology series are all important steps towards achieving our goal and I believe they can be accomplished without sacrificing what we value in this magazine.\n So now you know what I\u2019ll be doing in the background for months to come. If you\u2019d like to help, here are a few things you could do:\n \n Tell friends about our subscription options on your blog, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Goodreads, etc. Let\u2019s try to hit two thousand subscribers by the new year!\n Write a nice review over on our Amazon subscriptions page (more important than you might think)\n Recommend potential advertisers to us\n Subscribe or purchase our books, if you don\u2019t already\n Offer to deliver promotional materials to conventions\n Send us your marketing ideas\n Comment on a story you enjoyed\n \n If you\u2019d rather just read and enjoy, that\u2019s great too! Thanks for your continued support and I hope that we continue to earn it in the future.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

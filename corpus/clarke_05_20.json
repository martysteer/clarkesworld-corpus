Deadlines particularly have been difficult. I know I\u2019m not alone in feeling this way. When I find the strength to tackle the slush pile, I can\u2019t help but notice a few things: pandemic stories, a complete change in normal submission patterns, and a larger number of authors submitting their first story.\n Pandemic Stories\n This isn\u2019t in the least bit shocking to anyone who knows anything about slush piles. They always fill up with a hot topic when one exists. Well, we all saw this one coming and I\u2019d say that we\u2019re probably at peak right now. I\u2019m not ready to say, don\u2019t send us these, but you\u2019ll really have to break the mold to get through to us with a pandemic story right now. Happily, I can report that some authors are pushing beyond our current situation and portraying a path forward that isn\u2019t political or dystopian. Oddly enough, some have even made it, for lack of a better word, fun. It doesn\u2019t surprise me to see a quirky sense of humor being used as a coping mechanism, but seeing it used well, does.\n Submission Patterns\n I pay a lot of attention to the volume of submissions we\u2019re receiving and where they are coming from and I\u2019ve never seen it quite like this. There\u2019s rarely what I would consider a \u201cnormal\u201d day lately. The volume is usually way up or way down on any given day. No pattern, though there might be one if I paid closer attention to the news. I\u2019m hearing from a lot of authors who are having problems getting words on the page. I\u2019m pretty sure the distraction I\u2019ve been suffering from is the same culprit feeding those lows.\n First Story Submissions\n This observation is solely based on reading cover letters. With so many people working from home or having lost their jobs, a lot of people are finding the time to pursue that dream of writing that has been on the backburner under normal conditions. Some are providing detailed information about their situation and while I normally like brief cover letters, I\u2019m finding their passion for following a dream\u2014or distracting themselves\u2014in \u201cthese uncertain times\u201d uplifting.\n By the way, any time I talk about first time submissions, I feel the need to say a few things about them. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to believe that editors only want stories from \u201cname\u201d authors, but that\u2019s not something I\u2019ve observed with the magazine editors I\u2019ve known over the years. By and large, we all love to be the editor who published someone\u2019s first sale. It\u2019s probably the most rewarding part of our job. I\u2019ll even go one step further and say that it\u2019s an editor\u2019s responsibility to the field, and their own publication, to find new voices and publish them. After all, embedded in the spirit of science fiction is a need to move forward. New authors are an important part of that process and short fiction leads that wave.\n If you are one of those first time authors that has sent us your stories in the last couple of months or have pen to paper right now, please know you are welcome and we\u2019re excited to hear from you. Statistically speaking, sadly, most of you probably won\u2019t sell us a story, but we admire and respect the attempt and encourage you to keep trying and hope to work with you in the future!\n And with that, I think I\u2019ve said all that I\u2019m capable of for the moment, beyond a special shout out to our twitter followers who provided some suggestions for this editorial. I didn\u2019t take one in particular, but a few ended up shaping things as I wrote.

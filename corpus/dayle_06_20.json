I\u2019d never organized a funeral before, but I knew the body had to go somewhere.\nThe front-runner offered a protective layer of hand-engraved silica tiles. A good casket needed to look like it could survive reentry. Odds were it never got the chance and simply joined the rest of the space junk floating around between colonies. But a sturdy casket gives attendees peace of mind. They imagine everyone in Mom\u2019s generation ends up back on Earth eventually.\nI thought that way when she was sick. Now that she\u2019s gone, I\u2019m not sure it matters where I send what\u2019s left. Nonetheless, I didn\u2019t have anything better to do at work, so I scrolled through a catalog online. The eye implant\u2019s good for getting away with that kind of thing.\nMy art partner caught me at noon.\n\u201cAny ideas on the brief?\u201d he asked. Agile Hands pats itself on the back for having individual employee offices, but people feel excess comfort walking into mine. My hands had drifted into my pockets, my feet had drifted onto my desk, and my monitor had drifted to sleep. Not the best look before an industry lifer like Zane.\n\u201cA few.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\nZane\u2019s a big guy, which I suspect led to his current habit of invading personal space. Less muscular people had that habit kicked out of them in high school. The last time I got a drink in him, he said he considered bodybuilding \u201can extension of art direction.\u201d He\u2019d simply taken creative control of his body.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d Holding eye contact\u2019s tough while using the implant, but I\u2019m a decent multitasker. I pulled up the brief in my left eye and watched Zane with my right. He planted one arm against the wall, channeling a disappointed babysitter. This made keeping a straight face harder, but I maintained.\nCreative Brief\nProject Code: 081947\nThe Product\nHarvester, a tungsten-rod launcher with category-leading range and accuracy.\nCreative Objective\nDistinguish Harvester in a crowded APW (anti-planetary weapon) market.\nTarget Audience\nEither faction in the arms race between Demes and Unity.\nCategory Insight\nBoth factions need weapons capable of RPE (rapid population elimination) at minimum cost.\nBrand Insight\nHarvester trivializes current orbital defense systems, allowing near instant and consistent elimination of HPTs (high population targets).\nBrand Weaknesses\nAdvances in propulsion render Harvester ineffective against gunships and other (relatively) mobile military targets. Thus, usefulness is contained to planets and colonies.\nBrand Personality\nPowerful. Confident.\nThe social contract saved me: after two years working with me, Zane knew I hadn\u2019t touched the brief yet. But advertising partnerships are based on results, not shared principles. Chastising me only became worthwhile if I couldn\u2019t come up with something usable.\n\u201cTry to finish thinking soon,\u201d said Zane. \u201cThe red flag meeting\u2019s tomorrow. We need something worth showing Anthony. You know, proof we didn\u2019t spent the holidays thinking.\u201d\n\u201cGot it. Work on a composite of a woman at ease. Older, and artsy. Defense pitches are saturated with images of jarheads saluting flags, so we\u2019ll stand out.\u201d\n\u201cFine, but what\u2019s the headline?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d\nThat got him out of my office, albeit tenser than he\u2019d arrived. I counted to fifteen in case he cycled back with a new problem or admonition. When he failed to materialize, I returned to the catalogs. Restful Hills had a black silica tile series that looked promising.\nJanuary 3\nToday\u2019s Album: None of Your Showbusiness, by Re:Volution\nI took the journaling idea from Mom. And the word \u201cjournaling.\u201d\nWhile I like the feel of a pen, I\u2019m thinking of ditching the physical book. Most paper\u2019s a Union import, and socially conscious types like to glare at me on the shuttle. I can get away with a fancy watch on my wrist or computer in my head, but paper crosses some invisible line.\nAs I write this, there\u2019s a man with a fauxhawk staring daggers into my forehead. I get that people are on edge. We all know people on Union or Demes colonies and prefer them alive. It\u2019s no excuse for posturing at strangers like a child. That\u2019s how you get your head cracked at a show. Not that I\u2019d know, I haven\u2019t been to a decent concert in a year. Too many late meetings.\nTake today\u2019s pitch review. In the wonderful world of theory, it ended at five Colonial Time. In practice, less than half the creative teams had finished presenting. I\u2019d have snuck in some journaling, but Zane would\u2019ve smacked any obvious distractions out of my hands. Another argument against print. I could have written an erotic novel on the eye implant without anyone knowing or caring.\nAgency pitches are like billion-dollar nesting dolls. First, creative teams pitch ideas to each other. Then creative teams pitch their best (results vary) idea to creative directors, who pitch the best surviving ideas to the resident alcoholic agency director. The agency director brings their best (typically mediocre) account people to a client meeting, where they pitch the remains of an idea strained through three layers of human opinion to prospective customers. Clients then accept or reject our work based on the quality of their breakfast.\nMercifully, I only have to deal with the first layer of this process. Zane aspires to more. He\u2019s welcome to it.\nAround six, Zane killed a pleasant daydream by tapping my shoulder. I wanted to break the finger. Violence has been on my mind this week. Hopefully it\u2019ll pass with the funeral. Copywriting pays, but lawyers and therapists charge more.\n\u201cWe\u2019re up,\u201d he said. We marched to the front of the conference room and stood together before the firing squad. Ten writers, ten artists, and one creative director. Anthony Marsico sat at the head of the table in the reclined, semi-awake stance I wished I was in. I guess you have to work your way there.\nAnthony softly rapped his pencil against the table, eraser first. He drummed his way through most meetings in three-quarter time. I\u2019d already given up on interpreting it as a positive or negative sign. It\u2019s just something he does. There are worse quirks for creative directors.\n\u201cHave anything?\u201d Anthony asked.\n\u201cOf course. We\u2019ve been thinking a lot about it.\u201d\nZane\u2019s shoe (expensive) gently stepped on my shoe (less expensive). I canned the rest of the joke. Then he tapped the wall, bringing up our slide. Somehow, he\u2019d turned my last-minute direction and copy into something cohesive.\nWe chafe, but Zane does beautiful work. Our slide looked like he\u2019d made it in weeks instead of hours. The protagonist (a composite of five stock models) stood beside a half-finished marble bust. The bust\u2019s face mirrored hers, down to the braided ponytail, nose ring, and wry smile. I\u2019d argued against the nose ring\u2014a little too old-fashioned, even at her age\u2014but Zane had the final call on aesthetics. The results were hard to dispute. Both faces had the easy, natural confidence created through extended, artificial effort.\nI marred the image with a slim line of copy. Chisel: Creative Destruction.\n\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019ve changed the name,\u201d I began. \u201cStay calm.\u201d\nLukewarm laughter followed. No stomp from Zane, so we were in business.\n\u201cDemes is a liberal republic, and Union is a theocracy. Both systems rely on a self-image as the good guy. The name Harvester chafes with that somewhat.\u201d\n\u201cThe new name, Chisel, speaks to that impulse. It implies a deft hand and creative mind, a self-image the best and worst generals share. More importantly, it implies precision. The feature that distinguishes a tungsten-rod launcher from its competitors.\n\u201cBiological weapons like DuraVirus, Loki\u2019s Curse, and Bubblegum Fever are blunt instruments. They don\u2019t just take out the colony you target; they take out everyone the target\u2019s traded with for the last decade. Which, all too often, includes you. Food prices spark more wars than ideology, the current conflict notwithstanding.\u201d\n\u201cChisel is a thoughtful deletion. It contains damage to the target city, moon, or colony. Leaving a more aesthetically pleasing galaxy behind.\u201d\nI imagined cheers. I imagined getting fired. All Anthony did was nod and check something off in his notebook.\n\u201cSolid. I\u2019ll make it slide four,\u201d said Anthony. It was the first eye contact he\u2019d made with me all meeting.\nI thanked him for his time and sat down. There were no signs of success, failure, or skirting by. Either way, I was done thinking about kinetic bombardment.\nJanuary 4\nToday\u2019s Album: Cerebral Riot, by Cerebral Riot\nIt\u2019s done.\nWhen I carried that casket, my brain went AWOL. It was like being twelve again. I got caught up wondering if fat people\u2019s caskets were harder to carry, or if funeral homes gently nudged their next of kin toward lighter caskets. Any puerile line of thought felt easier than confronting the present.\nI assume people cried. I must have as well, unless today\u2019s the start of my career as a serial killer. Not that those guys get far these days.\nWe loaded her casket onto the Nebula III, along with thirty-three of December\u2019s other casualties. The name drives me crazy. Memorial airlines love that Raygun Gothic stuff, but it does nothing for the bereaved. If I had that contract, I\u2019d class up the rocket names a little. Or at least get rid of the numbers.\nThe chaplain gave my brother and I a port number and date for the launch. Martin thanked him, but I felt less diplomatic. Watching Astral Trails LLC shoot my only parent into space isn\u2019t on my short list. I hope no one\u2019s there to watch me liftoff. In fact, I might get cremated instead.\nMartin and company shuffled me to a second location. Some kind of bingo hall or rec center willing to host thirty depressed Jamaicans. The caterers had real beef, which was nice. It helped me soak up the rum.\nA trio of aunts (all aunts are one person in my head) tried to corner me for a stroll down memory lane, so I took a cigarette break. I quit smoking three years ago, and I\u2019ve managed to stay off it (half suggestion therapy, half willpower), but I generally keep that tidbit to myself. Cigarette breaks are the perfect excuse to get out of any room.\nThe rat that invented the post-funeral event deserved whatever happened to them. As if burying someone isn\u2019t depressing enough without meeting everyone else left behind.\nI resolved to spend the rest of the year away from next of kin. For real emotional support, you need someone that doesn\u2019t give a shit. Other mourners are like other drowners. You just pull each other down.\nMartin picked this moment to reappear.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the job?\u201d\nHis usual opening. Today it stumped me. Was there anything I hadn\u2019t said a dozen times before? Any answer that wouldn\u2019t make me feel like an idiot? I pawed at my phone to play for time.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Martin. \u201cI wanted to be casual. I know you don\u2019t like to talk about the big stuff.\u201d\nThe big stuff. \u201cNo problem.\u201d\n\u201cThat, and I noticed none of your coworkers were here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would they be?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019ve been there for four years. I have one or two people from work here.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d\n\u201cEmotional support\u2019s rude?\u201d\nTouch\u00e9. I\u2019d forgotten that Martin actually understood people. Colony people tend to double down on the old habit of treating coworkers like friends and friends like family. A natural side effect of the first colonists leaving everything else behind.\n\u201cGuess not. But your work-life balance is warped.\u201d\n\u201cI work half as much as you do.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said. Warped. You could quit or get fired tomorrow, and never see those people again.\u201d\nMartin went back inside, presumably to comfort the rest of the bereaved. I wished for a real pack of cigarettes to warm me up. The colony still didn\u2019t have real seasons. Just days that were too hot and nights that were too cold.\nJanuary 5\nToday\u2019s Album: Strap In, by The Dirt Sisters\nUnion declared war on Demes. Which is fair, since Demes hit two Union colonies with Bubblegum Fever. If we\u2019re lucky, no contaminated ships or cargo make it here. If we\u2019re not, this is one of my last entries.\nI\u2019m going drinking.\nJanuary 6\nToday\u2019s Album: Graveyard Earth, by Sunny and the Optimists\nWe\u2019re not dead, so I took today off. My job all but ceases to exist between pitches anyway.\nIt gave me some time to thumb through what I\u2019ve written so far. Mostly good, but I tore out the page about my last date. Posterity doesn\u2019t need my half-assed sex life, and I think the rest is more engaging.\nThat said, the dialogue\u2019s a bit skewed. Everything\u2019s tweaked to be funnier, or more concise, or long enough to fill the last line on a page. My comebacks get faster, and everyone else gets a little duller. It\u2019s less of a record of my life and more of a prime-time adaptation.\nThat might say something about journalists. As in reporters, not people who journal. When Demes\u2019 cleric sovereign reportedly told the Union premiere to \u201cConsider your next move carefully,\u201d he may have said something closer to \u201cKiss my ass, degenerate.\u201d That strikes me as less of a bad movie line and more like something that leads to dumping Bubblegum Fever on a civilian colony.\nI\u2019m biased, but I\u2019d rather be rodded. Contact, explosion, done. Bubblegum Fever takes time. Nothing vital melts first, only a few hours in. Points to whoever came up with the name. That\u2019s a professional. I\u2019m sure he and Zane would get along.\nGood ad writing\u2019s closest to poetry. Stand-up\u2019s equally apt, but that crowd wouldn\u2019t writhe as much under the comparison. Decent taglines emerge from rewriting the same sentence until a perfect, airless version emerges. Unless you half-ass it. Like in poetry, there\u2019s significant incentive to punch out early, get drunk, and watch awards roll in anyway.\nNavel-gazing aside, I\u2019m done reading the news. If the guys upstairs are smart, they\u2019ll keep us neutral. If they\u2019re not, I\u2019d rather not think about it.\nJanuary 7\nToday\u2019s Album: Omnicidal Tendencies, by Temujin\nI got an award today. Just an in-agency one, but it\u2019s still a decent boost.\nThey mailed it straight to my apartment, sparing me the waking nightmare of carrying a package on the shuttle. Everyone\u2019s already on edge since open war broke out, and I didn\u2019t need someone snapping on me for taking up too much space in the sardine can. People have gotten stabbed for less.\nLike everything from Agile Hands, it came in a light blue box. Our brand colors are blue and silver, a combo Zane says should have led to a designer losing his hands. I think it looks decent, but I don\u2019t have a horse in that race.\nThe box held a bottle of wine, a handwritten note on silver card stock, and a palm-sized, cube-shaped trophy. I don\u2019t get the cube thing either. Maybe the design team went through an abstract phase.\nI still have a little home training, so I started with the note.\nDear Leon,\nThis is for going the extra mile during the pitch. We\u2019re the first\u2014and only\u2014agency on the Harvester account. Or should I say Chisel?\nTo be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d be up for this. Anyone can see that you\u2019re going through something, even if you\u2019re not much for sharing. I imagine it\u2019s a girl. I\u2019ve been around long enough to know what relationship drama can do to a young talent.\nYou pushed through whatever is going on, and I can\u2019t thank you enough for that. Chisel opens doors for us. Anti-Planetary Weapons contractors pull from a small list of branding agencies, and this contract puts us on that list. I\u2019ll remember your part in making it happen.\nDrink this with someone in a cocktail dress. You\u2019re a hot item now.\nBest,\nAnthony\nThe last line took me out of it. Did people I know wear cocktail dresses? Did anyone? I\u2019d never seen one outside of a movie.\nI flipped the card and found a hand-drawn smiley face with dollar signs for eyes. \u201cBig Money Leon\u201d was scribbled underneath in cursive. Some of Anthony\u2019s old illustration instincts were leaking through. The boss likely had a book of similar sketches that would never see the light of day.\nAfter trashing the note and box, I poured half the wine into a novelty water bottle. My gym had printed oversized \u201cAhead of the Pack\u201d bottles for last year\u2019s spring marathon, an event I survived three miles of. Then I hauled the wine to the living room, opened a web browser on the east wall, and searched for pictures of women in cocktail dresses.\nIt seemed to mostly be a white girl thing. There were a few token pictures of black women at a Panthers 4 Peace fundraiser, but most cocktail dress owners looked like variations of my ex. I picked one in a blue cocktail dress with a face that was two degrees removed from Angeline\u2019s instead of one.\n\u201cCheers,\u201d I said before killing the bottle. I\u2019d planned on savoring the drink, but that felt off-tone.\nJanuary 8\nToday\u2019s Album: Soothing Whale Songs, by Automated Butcher\nI cracked and checked the news. We\u2019ve been allied with Demes for two days.\nI also missed a call from Martin. I\u2019ll hit him back later.\nJanuary 23\nToday\u2019s Album: N/A\nI always assumed they\u2019d save the rich first, or at least the politicians. The evacuation wasn\u2019t nearly organized enough for that. Luck got me much further than social climbing.\nMom\u2019s launch was the only reason I made it to a ship. I was already idling around the docks, recovering from my stomach\u2019s failure to adjust to the lack of artificial gravity. I threw up a few more times this morning than I\u2019m comfortable admitting. The only people accustomed to zero-g are astronauts, soldiers, and liars.\nI\u2019m generally good at ignoring the guilty voice in my head, but Mom\u2019s launch was the limit. I had to see her off in person. All the death in the news made it impossible not to think about hers, and I wouldn\u2019t have a second chance. Surprisingly, there was no sign of Martin. I guess we both changed our mind at the last moment.\nI kept to the back for most of the ceremony. The priest (a navy chaplain\u2014they like order at the docks) was the spitting image of Zane\u2019s composite model. She read a bible passage about rebirth, which I found disappointing. Mom was more about the songs. Scripture was something she sat through to get to the music. The Nebula III\u2019s countdown started without a note of music, so I hummed \u201cWill the Circle be Unbroken.\u201d No one stopped me, even when I started singing it. As a sober atheist belting an antebellum spiritual, I felt as strange as I looked.\nStill, it was better than the funeral. I didn\u2019t have to deal with anyone else that knew her. It was just me and her memory. Until the sirens.\nI\u2019d never heard the tone or pattern; the raid alarm must have changed since I left high school. Nonetheless, when a high-pitched alarm drowns out every noise in a wartime colony, people move. Human traffic pushed me toward the ships before I even resolved to find one. Sometimes you can trust the wisdom of crowds.\nI searched the processing lines for Martin, or a friend, or even Zane. No luck, but they might have made it. There were too many faces to pick out anyone, and they kept better track of the news than I did.\nKeep. I mean keep. I need to think present tense to stay sane.\nEventually, I wound up on a navy carrier called Ark 36. Humans were the only fauna on board, and there were significantly more than two of us. I barely had room to scratch my thigh, let alone lift my arm. I can only write this now that they\u2019ve opened the engine rooms and gun bays to the general population.\nThe observation monitors provided our one source of information and hope. The colony design, which I didn\u2019t think about 364 out of 365 days of the year, looked beautiful. Humanity had built a perfect metallic ring in space, kept it intact, and moved inside. I could understand why Mom had moved. The colony\u2019s existence alone represented new possibilities.\nShips fled by the dozen, but we needed hundreds. Thinking of the people stuck on the ring gave me a headache. Realizing how many of them I knew made it worse.\nChisel worked quickly and quietly, as advertised. First there wasn\u2019t a hole in the colony, and then there was. The rods didn\u2019t make for much of a show, flitting through and past my home in half a second.\nThe explosion provided more conventional drama. A ball of white fire enveloped everything that meant anything to me. The other survivors screeched in at least six different languages, begging and accusing their respective gods. I assume I screeched too. I may have even found religion. Memory has a way of protecting us from itself.\nThen my left eye went dark. The navy grunts said the electromagnetic pulse from the colony reactor fried most evacuees\u2019 implants. Fair trade for survival. I tapped my eye twice, under the vain hope that turning it off and on again would make a difference. Nothing. I\u2019m half blind for the foreseeable future.\nSoon we passed a memorial ship. A different model than Mom\u2019s, but around the same size and company. At the rate we fled, we\u2019d catch up to her ship in hours. We were racing the dead.\nDennard Dayle is a fiction writer and comedian.

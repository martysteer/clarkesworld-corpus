It found Quinn lying sleepless on the leaky air mattress she\u2019d set up in the back of the shop, balancing an untouched glass of hours-old scotch on her stomach. She fumbled for her phone and raised an eyebrow at the severity rating the user had entered on the online form: it sounded like there had already been some property destruction.\n She took solace in her matching pants and suit jacket, clean and well creased, draped over the back of her chair. So what if her head ached and her eyes burned. So what if the world was shit and life was pain: at least she\u2019d meet the day looking sharp. She laced up her high-tops and smoothed down the new growth on her undercut, then walked down the line of shelves as she looped her necktie, checking on each of the five-gallon jars: tapping her fingers on the happier ones, sprinkling salt or mineral solution on those in need. The jar closest to the door jittered and clinked at her approach. \u201cNo time to hang out, Digby,\u201d she told it. But when it kept sloshing insistently, she sighed and lowered in the little waterproof keyboard.\n YU NIISE DDO IUS KNIDKNIDENSE, the water inside typed. UNDARSTENDD DEP OCEANOIOSE YOOU DO IS GOOOD TOO NOW CEMBBOE ARBA BA BAM ABORMASDRO ADROABER\n As tantalizingly meaningful as a cat\u2019s meow, and roughly as meaningless, Quinn thought. She shook off the little keyboard and returned it to her jacket pocket, grabbed her helmet and goggles and the briefcase of her trade. Only when she\u2019d already swung her leg over her moped and kick-started the engine did she bother to look at the address on the request, and what she saw narrowed her eyes and quickened her pulse in dread and disbelief.\n It was her own home address\u2014her ex-home. She looked closer at the contact: first name YOU, last name JERK.\n She started to call Jasmine but her thumb hesitated. Instead she pocketed her phone, straightened her tie, and let the rattling 50cc engine carry her down the empty streets of the waterfront under the first glow of dawn. She turned inland and climbed up into the progressively narrower streets, choked with parked cars and bittersweet memories, until she arrived at the curb where Jasmine stood, bristling with anger and visibly sleep deprived.\n \u201cWhy not just call me if you wanted to talk?\u201d Quinn asked.\n \u201cYou know why. You know why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cI almost called Bill Russet,\u201d Jasmine hissed, \u201cbut I wanted you to admit it to my face. Right here. Right now.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cYour competitor.\u201d Jasmine stamped her foot and angrily clarified: \u201cYour business competitor!\u201d\n Quinn shook her head ruefully. \u201cDidn\u2019t know I had one of those either.\u201d It figured someone else would set up shop eventually, with aquids becoming more common now as pets and beasts of burden, but it still caught her off guard.\n \u201cSpit it out, Quinn. Did you do this?\u201d\n Quinn took her goggles off to let Jasmine see her eyes.\n Jasmine\u2019s body language softened. \u201cWell if you didn\u2019t, who\u2014? You know what, never mind. You\u2019re here. You want the job?\u201d\n In answer, Quinn grabbed her briefcase and started up the achingly familiar steps, but Jasmine stopped her. \u201cNo, it\u2019s next door now. Jumped the fence and seeped under Percy\u2019s window right before you got here.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to catch it since 3:00 a.m.\u201d\n The neighbor\u2019s front door was open. An unfamiliar scruffy guy in sweatpants and a disposable rain poncho regarded her nervously from the front porch, then followed her inside.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cYou live here?\u201d\n The guy hesitated. \u201cNo, I\u2019m, uh . . . \u201d He cleared his throat and Jasmine sidled up to him. Shit. He was the new boyfriend.\n Quinn sighed and averted her eyes. She followed the squishy spots in the carpet down the hall to a room where her ex-neighbor stood, feet planted, brandishing a mop.\n \u201cIn here! I got the thing cornered!\u201d He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cNice seeing you again, Quinn. Looking dapper as ever.\u201d\n \u201cCareful, Percy. Don\u2019t spook it.\u201d\n He obeyed her gestures to step back into the hall and she knelt carefully, silencing her breath as she surveyed the room and read the signs: fresh stains in the wallpaper; blisters in the particleboard shelving unit; a splash of anxious droplets across the window. This was one agitated aquid, but where was it hiding?\n Most importantly, what was its soft spot?\n \u201cIt\u2019s not yours, right?\u201d she whispered over her shoulder. \u201cNot your pet or anything.\u201d\n \u201cAquids creep me right the hell out,\u201d Percy declared, too loudly. \u201cI\u2019ll never own one of those slimy little alien water monster things. Not me! No thank you!\u201d\n Quinn tried to shush him, but it was too late. The aquid\u2019s frightened glittering caught her eye only a split second before it jumped out from under the desk, bounded off the window, shook the light fixture\u2014\n \u201cShit!\u201d Quinn shouted. \u201cSomeone flip the breakers! Quick!\u201d\n \u2014and flopped down right onto the power strip underneath the desk. A single brilliant spark burned a heartrending image into her retinas. Someone screamed. Quinn waved the smoke and ozone out of her face and rushed to scoop what was left of the creature quickly into a jar. It slopped greasily down the side like a glob of egg whites and settled in the bottom, barely moving.\n \u201cIs it dead?\u201d Jasmine asked. She pulled her new boyfriend down from the chair he\u2019d jumped up onto.\n Quinn squirted some saline into the jar and stirred it gently. She checked the readings on her pH meter and breathed a sigh of relief: it would probably recover.\n Percy clicked his tongue. \u201cShoulda left those stinkers on the beach they washed up on, you ask me. Shoulda figured out what weird trench they crawled from and pitched \u2019em right back in. I don\u2019t care how good of pets they make. Bound to turn evil sooner or later.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Quinn asked Jasmine. \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d\n \u201cNo clue. We just woke up and the sheets were damp and that\u2014that slime was flopping all over the place!\u201d\n Quinn gave her a look. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t talk about Digby like that.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d Jasmine shifted uneasily. \u201cDigby isn\u2019t an unholy terror.\u201d She motioned to her boyfriend. \u201cIt slapped him right in the face.\u201d\n Quinn cleared her throat, squished the smile out of her lips, and packed the jar into her padded briefcase. \u201cNever seen a feral aquid act this aggressive. Must\u2019ve been a plumber\u2019s helper that escaped into the main.\u201d She hesitated to add: \u201cProbably after a lot of mistreatment.\u201d\n \u201cMistreatment?!\u201d the neighbor yelled. \u201cThing\u2019s a monster! Who even knows what the aquids want from us! Who knows why the damn things crawled up onto land in the first place!\u201d\n \u201cSo I guess you don\u2019t want to keep it?\u201d\n Percy threw up his hands. \u201cKeep it?! I\u2019d flush it myself if I thought it wouldn\u2019t burble up somewhere else! I thought you was here to kill it. Thought you\u2019re an exterminator.\u201d\n Quinn handed him a business card. TROUBLED WATER, it read; AQUID CARE AND REHABILITATION. She gave one last look to each of them in turn and then smoothed down her jacket and headed back out to the curb, muttering, \u201cHave a better one,\u201d under her breath as she slid past.\n \u201cHey wait,\u201d Jasmine\u2019s new boyfriend called out. \u201cWhat do we owe you?\u201d\n \u201cNo charge,\u201d Quinn grumbled, already putting her helmet on.\n Jasmine caught up and planted her hands on the handlebars, looking mortified with regret. \u201cYou understand why I thought it was you, right? You haven\u2019t exactly been taking this breakup gracefully.\u201d\n Quinn glanced at the love of her life and frowned.\n \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been a whole month,\u201d Jasmine pressed. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you ate? Slept? I hope you\u2019re not still living in that dank little closet in the back of your shop.\u201d\n Quinn shrugged.\n Jasmine gripped her own head exasperatedly. \u201cYou are killing me, Quinn! Say something! I never know what you\u2019re thinking or feeling. You barely laugh. You don\u2019t even cry. In three years I\u2019ve never seen you cry once! Do you even realize that?\u201d\n Quinn pursed her lips. It was true. She hadn\u2019t shed a tear since fifth grade, and she wasn\u2019t about to start now.\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jasmine asked, earnestly.\n Quinn stared up at her. As if the question needed to be asked. As if Jasmine didn\u2019t know Quinn wanted her back. If all attempts at language thus far had failed her, it was doubly pointless now, so without another word she kick-started the engine and watched her ex-girlfriend (balling her fists and visibly stifling a frustrated scream) shrink in the mirrors.\n At the next intersection Quinn narrowly swerved around a big white van pulling out of an alley, the words BILL RUSSET stenciled on the side. She shook off the adrenaline and fought to keep her mind on the road, the case stowed between her knees, the wounded feral aquid inside.\n What am I going to call you? she wondered. How about Dorky? Sparky? Regretty?\n The sun was up and the harbor gulls were screaming by the time Quinn pressed back into her shop. The new aquid went under a red lamp to see if it could bounce back from its encounter with alternating current. Meanwhile, Digby was rocking its jar back and forth again, so she hauled it over to the desk and gave it back the waterproof micro-keyboard.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Digby? You\u2019re normally so chill. Something going on?\u201d\n NOAW UNDARSTEND NAOW, it typed again. OSCEEN SOUNT DDEPE MUOOZIQ QWIN LEOEV QQWIN INDKNSES PSASTSESS AWKQID DOIS FOLLLLLO IN TOO IN THHE ATDEEP EBCMOE A BAD BAMDASOR\n What did the aquids want? Why had they come onto land? Percy had asked these things rhetorically, but they were good questions. Quinn had been asking them so long they\u2019d merged into the white noise of her life. The years she\u2019d spent trying to communicate with Digby had given it a flair for typing almost unheard-of among aquids, but the year since they\u2019d made any real progress left her to wonder whether she\u2019d really taught it to convey meaning, or merely to assemble letters into words for fun.\n She opened the lid and let the water crawl up her arm, around her shoulders, and back down her other side. It was in a good mood; it dampened the fabric of her shirt but then sucked every trace of itself back in. It glommed onto the keyboard in her palm and went right back to typing\u2014and Quinn leaned her head on her fist and watched its absurdist mutterings scroll by on the tiny display. There was some word it seemed determined to spell: MABASOSSDER, A BASAMADROOM. She helped it back into its jar, tapped the glass, and whispered: \u201cAnybody ever tell you you\u2019re a real goober?\u201d\n Digby had been her first rescue, three years ago in the alley behind the dry cleaners. The place had kept a dozen-odd aquids back then, trained to break up troublesome stains without damaging the fabric, but a close call with caustic detergent had driven Digby into a frenzy, and the proprietor had thrown it out on the street just as Quinn and Jasmine happened by on their postcoital morning walk. They\u2019d found Digby cowering in a drainpipe and spent an hour trying different things to coax it out: whistling, humming, dancing, silence, grains of salt, dribbles of water, flashes of light. Finally, Quinn had played some Enya on her phone, and that had done it. It turned out Digby fucking loved Enya.\n Digby still felt like the kid they\u2019d raised together\u2014to Quinn, at least\u2014and in the process of nursing it to health, she\u2019d gained an accidental reputation as the area\u2019s foremost aquid handler. It paid the bills okay. It would\u2019ve paid much better, but she kept her business the way she liked it: unadvertised, tucked away in the armpit of a freight pier where nobody looking for a new pet would ever find it. She\u2019d grown too close to the aquids, knew their soft spots too well, to dream of selling them now. There was Salty (who liked its salinity unusually high), Stormo (weirdly bluish), Grungy (who had a taste for Nirvana), Mopey (very passive and viscous), and going on thirty or forty others now: all somebody\u2019s water damage liability at one time, all perfectly chill now that they had a home, company, and a bit of attention every day.\n Digby stirred and jittered and then went still, seemingly waiting for her to respond to its incomprehensible missives. In passing, she thought: do you feel, talking to me, the way I felt with Jasmine? Like there\u2019s a glass wall between us that no words can ever cross, so why even try? She put its favorite music on and watched the blob of animate surface tension swirl peacefully around the confines of its jar. Sail away, sail away, sail away.\n The ringing phone jolted her face off the desk. She answered, \u201cTroubled Water, Quinn speaking.\u201d\n A gravelly voice said \u201cHey. So, uh. I heard you don\u2019t kill aquids when you catch them. Like, uh. Ever.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n She winced and straightened up in her chair and said, \u201cThey\u2019re fairly intelligent. Some are on par with a dog or a small child. No one knows for sure, but they can even use simple written language\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo they can\u2019t.\u201d\n A long pause passed. Quinn said, \u201cYeah, they can.\u201d\n \u201cActually you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n \u201cDude, listen. They do have a very different kind of intelligence from us. We don\u2019t know how polymerized water-based life works on a molecular level, how they store memory or information, let alone how to measure\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d He hung up.\n She tried to lean her face back down on her desk and go to sleep again, but the residual shakes kept her up. She went to brew some coffee, but the phone rang again.\n \u201cTroubled Water, Qu\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhy do you dress like a man?\u201d asked the same voice as before.\n \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n \u201cI said, uh. You\u2019re a girl, right? So why do you dress like a man. Like a businessman. Like a G-man. It\u2019s weird.\u201d\n Quinn yearned to tell him some truth. She wanted to sit this troll down and say: my dude, what\u2019s the big fucking deal? I look and feel swank as hell, and what\u2019s more, the world is crap and living is pain, but maybe someday it won\u2019t be\u2014I mean I can only get through the days anymore by choosing to believe, in spite of it all, in spite of all the dickwads like you, that something really wonderful is going to happen. And when it does, I\u2019m damn well going to be dressed for the occasion. I\u2019m going to meet it in style.\n But as she was thinking all these things, she had a hunch.\n \u201cBecause I take pride in my work,\u201d she said. \u201cUnlike Bill Russet.\u201d\n A long silence passed.\n \u201cFuck you,\u201d the caller growled, and hung up.\n Just as she was pouring the grounds, the phone rang a third time. She groaned and picked up without looking at the screen.\n \u201cWhat!\u201d\n All she heard was breathing on the other end. Then \u201cQuinn?\u201d\n Shit. It was Jasmine.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever actually apologized,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this an okay time?\u201d\n \u201cI . . . \u201d Quinn trailed off. She leaned back against the wall and sank down to a sit.\n \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I was up all night trying to catch that thing and my brain was truly fried. I know you\u2019d never set a feral aquid loose in our\u2014my house. It\u2019s just . . . the neighbors said their doorbell camera caught some creep in pleated dress slacks sneaking around the side with a bucket right around the time it happened, and I just assumed.\u201d\n Quinn said nothing, but the words stung in her ears. As if she\u2019d be caught dead in pleated pants. Flat front or bust.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry I blamed you,\u201d Jasmine continued. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t cool and now I feel like I blew our first chance to actually talk since you moved out, and I just . . . \u201d The line sighed. Jasmine\u2019s voice lowered to a nearly inaudible creak: \u201cI miss you, okay? I\u2019m allowed to miss you.\u201d\n Quinn buried her face in her hand. I miss you too, she thought. In fact, all I do anymore is sit around trying to think of something I could say that could ever get you to give me one more chance to fix whatever it was I broke. I can\u2019t begin to imagine how to move on with my life. Christ, Jasmine, I\u2019m so lost without you I don\u2019t know what to do.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d Quinn murmured.\n \u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d Jasmine asked quietly.\n She was cut off by a shout through the door: \u201cFor the love of all that is holy, open up! They\u2019re attacking! Help us! Oh God, help us!\u201d\n \u201cSorry gotta go,\u201d Quinn said.\n \u201cWait!\u201d Jasmine\u2019s voice yelped.\n Quinn hung up and pushed the door open and Betty, the forewoman from the warehouse next door, barreled through. Her coveralls were sopping with brine. She grabbed Quinn by the lapels and pulled her close and growled, \u201cWhat. In God\u2019s name. Have you DONE?\u201d\n The cavernous space was in chaos. Amber siren lights spun across the walls while workers ran for cover and yelped in fear at every unsteady motion atop the rows of towering shelves.\n \u201cShut off the alarms!\u201d Quinn yelled. \u201cYou\u2019ll only spook them worse.\u201d\n Betty shot her a look to kill the devil and said, \u201cYou would know.\u201d\n \u201cWhatever this is, it\u2019s not my fault!\u201d\n \u201cSo they just came out of nowhere, did they?!\u201d the forewoman yelled. \u201cNot the aquid pound right next door? You expect me to believe this is a coincidence?\u201d\n Quinn smoothed down her suit jacket and put on the calmest face she could. \u201cAll the aquids in my care are present and accounted for. I\u2019m happy to help contain, but I am telling you these aren\u2019t mine.\u201d\n The forewoman started to say something, but at that moment a basketball-sized glob bounded into view atop the nearest shelf and slammed itself into a precarious stack of yellow tubs of lard. Betty\u2019s eyes went wide with fear as the shelf teetered. Quinn squinted incredulously: the aquid kept focusing on the stack\u2019s weakest point in a way that could only be deliberate. It wasn\u2019t just spooked. It was trying to wreck everything.\n \u201cHey Betty,\u201d Quinn said, then shouted. \u201cBetty! Is there a megaphone in the house?\u201d\n It took Quinn half an hour to find the rampaging aquids\u2019 soft spots, and the soft spots were strange. They were all on the heavy side, but still a bit too small to be tickled. The first one scoffed at every genre of music except for epic thrash metal. The second one was indifferent to music but seemed determined to relentlessly throw itself at any blinking light in its line of sight, so Quinn was able to lure it into a circle of grease, which it was afraid to leave. The third one attacked anything that stood on two legs, and Quinn had had no choice but to throw a desiccant packet at it in self-defense, which she felt horrible about; it was the aquid equivalent of pepper spray. The fourth and final one eventually tuckered itself out.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d Quinn said, wiping sweat and brine from her brow and lifting the last taped-up utility bucket up the stairs to her shop. \u201cThese aren\u2019t feral at all. Somebody had to train them to tear it up like this.\u201d\n Betty was still giving her the hairy eyeball.\n Quinn\u2019s phone buzzed in her pocket for the umpteenth time. This nonsense was costing her business. She groaned and set the buckets down and turned to Betty: \u201cYou want me to prove they\u2019re not mine? Look!\u201d She swung open the door to the shop.\n Four five-gallon glass jars were lined up on the bare concrete floor\u2014all overturned and empty. The sound of screeching tires rang out over the pier and Quinn turned briefly to see a white van shoot away on puffs of burning rubber.\n Betty plucked a business card from the bowl on the desk. \u201cFor our lawyers,\u201d she said, and stepped around Quinn on her way back out into the salty air. For her part, Quinn couldn\u2019t move or speak. She held the first empty jar in front of her and her knuckles turned white from gripping it next to the big handwritten label that said DIGBY.\n She roared down the street at full throttle. Her tie whipped furiously over her shoulder and the wind burned her naked eyes, but her eyes stayed dry. Car horns blared and the engine rattled and burned oil between her ankles as she sped down the beachfront and finally half-crashed to a stop in a strip mall parking lot. She stood there a moment, staring viciously at the storefront, the white van parked there, the words on the corrugated plastic sign stapled to the old fa\u00e7ade above it: BILL RUSSET, LICENSED ABYSSAL CREATURE EXTERMINATOR.\n A car screeched to a halt behind her. She turned, and there was Jasmine, jumping out the driver\u2019s side, looking pissed.\n \u201cAnswer your fucking phone!\u201d she yelled.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Quinn asked.\n \u201cI hear somebody screaming bloody murder in the background and then you hang up on me and stop answering? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n Quinn winced. \u201cBut . . . how did you know to come here?\u201d\n \u201cYou never cut me off on that phone locator app! What are you doing here? What happened? What the hell kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into?\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t involve you,\u201d Quinn said ruggedly. \u201cYou dumped me. My problems aren\u2019t yours to worry about anymore.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d\n Quinn steeled herself and turned away. She threw the taped-up glass doors open and stepped through slowly, like a new town sheriff entering a saloon. Inside there were stacked crates of paper towels; whole boxes of oversized silica gel desiccant packets. Bill Russet stood in the middle of it all, arms folded in defiance. He wore pleated khakis, a bushy blonde moustache, and the smuggest look Quinn could remember ever seeing.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t prove anything,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWait, you\u2019re him,\u201d Jasmine yelled. \u201cYou were in the bushes behind our house last night!\u201d\n Quinn\u2019s whole body stiffened. She felt her eyes burn even hotter. \u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou crank call me. You torture aquids to turn them evil. You sabotage my neighbor\u2019s warehouse and frame me for it. You break into my shop. And you snuck a feral into Jasmine\u2019s bedroom while she slept? Why?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s called entrepreneurship,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think you got some kind of monopoly on aquid wrangling, is that it? Think you got the market cornered in this town? Sorry to burst your little bubble, but it\u2019s a free country and I\u2019ll be damned\u2014\u201d he looked the two of them up and down meaningfully\u2014\u201cif I let people like you hold me back from my hard-earned success. Now be good girls and skedaddle.\u201d\n Quinn whistled through her teeth and turned an eye to Jasmine.\n \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t?\u201d Jasmine said, rolling up her sleeves.\n Bill Russet yanked a utility bucket off the shelf behind him and threw it down hard enough to pop the lid off.\n The attack aquid slammed into Quinn\u2019s chest, knocking the breath out of her and replacing it with the taste of adrenaline and salt water. She opened her eyes to see it smash Jasmine back against the wall and cling to her like a raindrop to an ant. It was the fattest water she\u2019d ever seen, easily four gallons and change. Her eyes darted to the piles of towels and bulk packages of silica and other torture devices\u2014but no, that might kill it. Then she knew. She scrambled to her feet and braced herself against the wall, arms spread wide. She was ready when the aquid lunged again: she caught it, stuck her fingers into its sides, and wiggled as if her life depended on it.\n The water stopped. Its weight deadened. Its grip became less a strangle than a hug.\n \u201cWhat are you doing to my attack dog?!\u201d Bill Russet shouted.\n \u201cThe really big ones are always ticklish,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWhich you\u2019d know, if you were a real pro!\u201d\n He let out a crazed whoop and brandished a taser to advance on his own pet\u2014but before he could get close, Jasmine roundhouse kicked him in the head, knocking him out cold.\n Quinn tickled the water back into its utility bucket and caught her breath. She met her ex-girlfriend\u2019s eyes gravely.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Jasmine asked.\n \u201cHe got Digby.\u201d\n Without a word, Jasmine found the plug for the wall speakers and the room filled with Enya\u2019s Only Time. Then the two of them fearfully held hands and crept deeper into the room\u2014and in a jar in the back, they saw a flash of swirling silver light.\n Quinn\u2019s heart sank and her hand clamped over her mouth when she found Digby, in a jar next to a pile of ripped-open silica wrappers. It was a third its original size and discolored, greenish, sicklier than it had been when they\u2019d found it in that drainpipe a lifetime ago. Desiccant-poisoned. Its motions were jerky but it kept up its slow dancing to the breathy vocals even as Quinn reached into the jar and let it touch her palm.\n \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d She gripped Jasmine\u2019s hand until her fingers ached. She felt so helpless here, without her briefcase, no salt or mineral solution or pH meter, nothing that might help. All she could do for Digby was hold it.\n \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Jasmine corrected.\n Digby was rocking back and forth differently now\u2014the way it did when it wanted the little keyboard. Quinn found it in her suit pocket and set it in the jar. She had to help Digby reach the keys.\n MMOMZ, it typed.\n A droplet splashed in the bottom of the jar, and then another. Quinn clenched it in her soggy arms and let out a loud, ugly sob. She wept with her whole body, her eyes burning with her own brine, her lungs racked with heaving breath. The tears streamed down her face and Digby limply reached out and drank them up, swelling, incorporating bits of Quinn\u2019s water into its own.\n Suddenly it shuddered. It clarified and brightened.\n UNDDRSTTAND EBTTER, Digby typed. QKWIN GOOOOD AWKQIDSS SENT TO TESSED HYUMANS YU PASST THE TEST\n Jasmine turned to Quinn. \u201cUh. Has Digby always been this . . . comprehensible?\u201d\n QKWIN ALLLAWYS SHOWW AWQUID KINDNESS, the glowing display read. YU PASS ARE TESST NOW COME HEARE THHE DDEEP MYUSIQ BEE COM A MBBOSDR AMBASD AMMBASSSADORR\n Digby reached up Quinn\u2019s arm with small but insistent force. It glommed onto her fingertips and started to tug at them, pulling her toward the other jars on the shelf.\n \u201cI think\u2014\u201d Quinn stammered in awe. \u201cI think it wants\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWait! What does Digby mean by \u2018ambassador\u2019? To who? To what?\u201d\n But she was already unscrewing all the lids. A growing circle of sickly, agitated aquids spilled out onto the floor and gathered themselves up, but they all went eerily calm at Quinn\u2019s touch. They climbed up her high-tops and gathered around her ankles and tugged her onward, out the door.\n \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Jasmine yelped. \u201cAre you walking on purpose or are they walking you?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI think this is it.\u201d\n \u201cThis is what?\u201d Jasmine waited. \u201c . . . Hello?\u201d\n Quinn finally smiled and answered, \u201cThis is the day I was waiting for. This is the wonderful thing.\u201d She squeezed Jasmine\u2019s hand and led her back out toward the daylight.\n They walked across the road and down onto the beach. At the edge of the shore, where water darkened the sand, they stood facing each other while the aquids around Quinn\u2019s ankles one by one released and slinked away into the surf.\n \u201cCan we talk?\u201d Jasmine asked. \u201cCan we finally, finally talk? That\u2019s all I ever wanted. That\u2019s all that was ever missing.\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d Quinn said, shivering as Digby crept around her neck and shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so hard for me.\u201d\n \u201cI love you, Quinn. I never stopped loving you. Will you just . . . talk to me?\u201d\n Quinn\u2019s voice caught in her throat. All the stress and fear and anger and vulnerability of this god-awful day had shaken loose a psychic blockage that had been gumming up her heart ever since the breakup\u2014maybe much longer. She met Jasmine\u2019s sublime and heartbroken gaze and knew this was finally it: the moment the glass jar broke, when she could finally be fully open and present with another person, finally connect, really and truly talk. She opened her mouth to speak\u2014\n But just then she heard something. They both turned and looked out at the ocean\u2014at the small but growing hole parting the waves, spreading into a sort of well. A tunnel.\n Talking, Quinn thought. Who needs talking?\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jasmine asked.\n \u201cDo you hear that music?\u201d\n Jasmine stared blankly. \u201cWhat music? . . . Quinn?! Hello?\u201d\n \u201cNo, you were right,\u201d she finally answered. \u201cWe need to take some time to ourselves.\u201d Quinn planted a salty kiss on her cheek. Then she turned to the hole in the waves and walked.\n \u201cWait!\u201d Jasmine called. \u201cWhat\u2019s down there? What\u2019s happening? Will you ever come ba\u2014?\u201d\n The surf rushed in and sealed the entrance behind Quinn, muting Jasmine and the screaming gulls and hissing waves and the harbor noise\u2014and in the sudden quiet, she heard the music clearly. Haunting, resounding, ethereal. Voices sang from somewhere much deeper as she followed the tunnel, scraping her high-tops on the sand and rocks, coral and submerged tide pools. She stopped at the top of a spiral of steep water-hewn steps and stared down their length as far as the ebbing blue sun could touch\u2014and beyond reach of the light, the silhouette of a dark structure. She hesitated. She looked back.\n \u201cWhat do you think, Digby?\u201d she asked the water dancing on her shoulder. She smoothed down her lapels and straightened her tie and said, \u201cAm I presentable?\u201d\n Then she climbed down, following the music.\n Elly Bangs was raised in a new-age cult, had six wisdom teeth, and once rode her bicycle alone from Seattle to the Panama Canal.

Two small holes are drilled at the temples. That\u2019s where the wires go in. The intestines they put in a bucket for easy drainage. No muss, no fuss. All other parts are distributed around the cubicle, either hung on thick hooks or slid into drawers for safekeeping.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll wait for me?\u201d she asks via speakerphone, right before they download her into the drone.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Chase answers. His stomach still roils from the surgery clips.\nThe Employment Bureau sends him a holo of Marybeth, to replace what they\u2019ve taken away. Every night since she left, Chase sits on the couch with the holo next to him. It has slight corporeality. When it pats his thigh, the touch feels like a kitten\u2019s paw. \u201cCan you get me some ice cream, honey?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t feed it ice cream. He doesn\u2019t make eye contact with it, even though it looks just like his wife. Marybeth\u2019s amateur charcoal drawings line the mantle above the television, a reminder he can\u2019t bring himself to stash away.\nWhen things get bad, he takes a walk around the neighborhood.\nAnd when things get really bad, he goes to see the storyteller.\n\u201cGather around the fire,\u201d says the storyteller. The two dozen people collected in the parking lot of the old strip mall edge in closer to the wizened old man, their ties and linen skirts nearly brushing the coals. The storefronts are empty sockets, their gaudy paint peeling and faded. \u201cLet me tell you a story.\u201d\nChase hangs around the back, near an old fiberglass statue of a lumberjack once used to sell maple syrup. He can barely hear the storyteller\u2019s words above the crackling of the fire and the humming of the drones overhead. He looks up at the drones. He thinks about Marybeth.\n\u201cThis is a tale about an ant,\u201d continues the storyteller. He paces the parking lot, his wooden cane thumping like a heartbeat. \u201cShe was a very good ant, and knew her place in the colony. She was born to fill a role and she filled that role with great competency. The ant loved her queen. One day, the little ant\u2019s mound filled with a thick green smoke. The ant felt herself changed. She couldn\u2019t lift a piece of food ten times her size anymore. She couldn\u2019t quite march in line with the other ants. And she began to have doubts about the queen.\u201d\nChase has heard this story before, except it used to be about a bee. Regardless, he listens. It\u2019s better than returning to the sparse apartment with the holo in it.\n\u201cThe little ant, she thought and thought. \u2018Why am I thinking this way?\u2019 the little ant pondered. And then the little ant realized what the problem was. She was thinking.\u201d\nChase looks up, up. The drones aren\u2019t recruiting now, but they still drift in a river of lights above him, rear thrusters twinkling like eyes. So many eyes.\n\u201cThe little ant had a choice to make. She was free of her programming, but her epiphany made her realize that she had only a short time left to live. Armed with that fateful knowledge, she departed the colony she\u2019d been sheltered in for such a long time \u2013 all of her tiny life \u2013 and went to see the world.\u201d\nChase lights a joint and lets himself relax. The night air is so cool. A brisk wind picks up, letting the embers of the fire scatter. He rests his spine on the lumberjack\u2019s shin and stretches his feet out. He feels very far away from the apartment at times like this.\n\u201cThe little ant was free! She was so happy. She picked her way along, paying no attention to the scent trails left by her sisters. She knew that only a few days\u2019 walk away there was a great city full of food. Maybe there were other ants out there who had been touched by the green gas. They would understand.\n\u201cThen a hiker stepped on the little ant and ground her into dust.\u201d\nWhen full automation made human employment superfluous, the first reaction was panic. Pink slips fell like confetti. Even Chase had protested against the coming of the machines at first, though Marybeth hadn\u2019t.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cRelax, Chase. It\u2019s the way things were meant to be. Machines can do things better than we ever could.\u201d\nThe early days of the Shift were a time of great upheaval, as people who\u2019d spent their whole lives working suddenly found themselves without a job, a purpose. The solution was drastic: a complete social safety net, and a draft. Every day, a few people were called for employment, targeted by the drones that also swept the city clean, monitored crime, and performed chit drops. Stretches of employment varied from a few months to a few years.\nYou\u2019ll come back, the Employment Bureau said. Everyone will come back. We count on it. Chase knows nobody who has returned, but that doesn\u2019t prove anything.\nThe draft wasn\u2019t needed, not exactly. The drones ran on their own, filling all necessary roles with machine intelligence alone. But you couldn\u2019t just give people something for nothing. Not in this country. People liked to feel useful.\nMarybeth and the others were the wetware. They gave the drones that special human touch. That flash of recognition you felt when a drone faced you across a parking lot: human eyes. The gentle way they\u2019d scold you for dropping your litter on the sidewalk before they picked it up: human voice. The Employment Bureau said it was a good thing to be uploaded into a drone. That it was everyone\u2019s patriotic duty.\nOne by one, Chase\u2019s neighbors file out of their boarded-over apartment buildings dressed in their best business casual, waiting for the drones. He doesn\u2019t want to look at the others, their faces frozen in rictuses of fear, so he drops his eyes to the squeaky-clean sidewalk. A stalk of fennel pokes through the asphalt, reaching toward the cuffs of his rumpled trousers. He doesn\u2019t look up, not even when one of his neighbors screams. Especially not when she screams.\nIt might be an hour later, or it might be fifteen minutes. But every day, there\u2019s a palpable sense of relief as the passed-over people realize they haven\u2019t been taken.\nSome, the ones who still find themselves purposeless, are upset. Most are not.\nChase thinks of organs in drawers, and of the holo on his tattered couch. Then he takes a deep breath and heads to the coffee shop. The pink-haired barista places his order when he comes in. He\u2019s a regular.\n\u201cSlow day?\u201d he asks. The barista is the only person he knows who has a job doing anything except running a drone. A child of privilege, she inherited this place, and runs it more as a lark than anything else. The shop\u2019s walls are lined with posters advertising music festivals and political protests, all of them over a decade old. He wonders how many places like this still remain, places run by human operators instead of machines. Probably not very many.\n\u201cSandy was taken last night.\u201d\n\u201cLast night?\u201d The employment drones never show up at night. The barista has to be mistaken.\nThe barista shrugs. \u201cGuess they\u2019re expanding into the night shift.\u201d\nChase\u2019s veins run cold. \u201cAre you sure it was the drones?\u201d\n\u201cHer girlfriend got the holo this morning.\u201d The barista shakes her head. \u201cTerrible.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . \u201d Chase\u2019s throat begins to close up. Knives of fear cut into his skin, slicing him up. Destroying him.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it,\u201d the barista says, obviously trying to make Chase feel better.\nIt\u2019s too late. Chase is already worried about it. He slaps down his chits on the scratched tile counter, sucks down the foul-tasting coffee, and sprints to his apartment. He doesn\u2019t look up.\n\u201cThis is the story of the bird who laid golden eggs,\u201d says the storyteller. From his vantage point outside the sacred semicircle, Chase leans in to listen, though he\u2019s heard this one before.\nI\u2019ve heard them all before, Chase thinks. But he misses Marybeth, and the holo\u2019s still creeping him out, six months after it arrived on his doorstep.\n\u201cThe bird wasn\u2019t unhappy to be owned. She knew that her shining eggs, though worthless to her, brought great joy to the prince of the kingdom. The bird\u2019s power made her unusual, she knew, and she was quite willing to forego the garden outside the barred window of her cage to bring delight to the prince and his kingdom. All was well for many years.\u201d\nThe storyteller takes a swig of water from the mason jar at his side. He smacks his lips.\n\u201cThen came a day when the prince brought in the royal scientists to study the bird. They made copies of her DNA and inserted them into other birds. The bird that laid golden eggs was no larger than a wren, you see, and even ten of her eggs could make only one small crown, even when melted down. They started with a chicken, then an eagle, then finally worked their way up to an ostrich. For a while, the little bird was even happier! She was no longer alone, and though the aviary was now crowded with many different species of gold-laying birds, not all of whom got along, her life was much less dull than it was before. She was so grateful to the prince.\u201d\nChase makes eye contact with a young woman illuminated by the soft moonlight. Her jacket is shredded on one side and her hair is lank and dirty, but she smiles at him warmly. He smiles back.\n\u201cFor a few years,\u201d the storyteller says, \u201cthings remained as they were. The little bird, and all the other gold-laying birds, got along as well as they could. The eagle still sometimes pestered the little bird, but even the eagle knew that they all had a job to do. Then, one day, the royal scientists unveiled their greatest creation ever! They handed a jewel-encrusted box to the prince.\n\u201c \u2018What is this contraption?\u2019 said the prince.\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s a replicator, a grand replicator. With this box, you can produce all the gold you could ever want. You don\u2019t need the birds anymore. You can set them free.\u2019\n\u201cThe prince paused. He looked at the aviary. The birds had never known life outside their cage. Could they be trusted to be free? Would they even want that? He thought for seven days and seven nights, as the grand replicator passed out brick after brick of solid gold, forged from nothing at all.\u201d\nChase inches closer to the woman, drawn like a magnet to her, though he doesn\u2019t know why. His breath catches in his throat. On a night like this he feels so lonely he can\u2019t even think straight.\n\u201cAt the end of a week of intense deliberation, the prince threw the key to the birdcage from the top of the tallest tower in the kingdom. There was no need to tell the birds about the grand replicator. They were only birds, after all.\u201d\nThe following Monday, Chase sees the woman from the park in the automated grocery store. She\u2019s wearing a dress with a large stain on the front and one kitten heel. Her other foot has twigs between the toes.\nJust go talk to her, he thinks. You\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t. Chase runs a hand through his own greasy hair and nonchalantly bumps her cart with his own.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, \u201cnice shoe.\u201d\nShe looks at her bare foot. \u201cI don\u2019t get my chits for two weeks. Their products aren\u2019t as good as they think they are.\u201d\nChase has noticed that too. \u201cWe met last night. But I don\u2019t remember your name.\u201d\nHer eyes dart around. The storyteller\u2019s sermons aren\u2019t illegal, exactly \u2013 freedom of assembly and all \u2013 but it\u2019s still not considered patriotic to attend. \u201cVictoria,\u201d she says, holding out a hand.\n\u201cChase.\u201d They shake.\nShe looks in his cart. It\u2019s a typical bachelor\u2019s spread: crackers, Velveeta, microbrew. None of it is real, all of it made, packaged, and delivered by drones. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you there before.\u201d\n\u201cI go sometimes. It\u2019s something to do.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice to go out when they can\u2019t get you.\u201d\nChase doesn\u2019t tell her what the barista told him, about the recruitment drones expanding into the night shift. It probably isn\u2019t true, and anyway, he was still going out at night. \u201cThere\u2019s another one tonight. Would you like to go with me?\u201d\nHer forehead scrunches up, the gears working. Finally, she smiles. \u201cI wonder which one he\u2019ll tell this time. The one about the ant or the one about the leopard?\u201d\nChase laughs a little too forcefully. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have a lot of range, does he?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the one about the ant, so instead of listening, Chase and Victoria sneak behind the lumberjack and pass a beer back and forth. It isn\u2019t until the off-service drone overhead lights up its rear thruster that he sees a pale line of skin encircling her brown finger.\n\u201cYou were married?\u201d\n\u201cHe offered himself up, oh, four years ago. After they instituted the program.\u201d\nChase frowns. \u201cOffered himself?\u201d\n\u201cHe said it was his patriotic duty to ensure full employment, even after the Shift. We had a huge fight because I wouldn\u2019t go. He called me lazy. I suppose I am.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your skin isn\u2019t back to normal after four years?\u201d\n\u201cThe ring was an implant. I had to go to a doctor to remove it.\u201d She holds out her hand, fingers splayed. \u201cTrue love forever.\u201d\nHer curly hair glistens in the dronelight. She\u2019s pretty, though nothing like Marybeth. No, he thinks, stop it. You\u2019re married.\n\u201cMy wife is there,\u201d Chase blurts out. \u201cIn a cube. She didn\u2019t volunteer, they just took her.\u201d\nVictoria places her hands over his. \u201cI could tell.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be back someday.\u201d\nShe stares at him hard, her dark eyes like glassy rocks. \u201cHas anyone ever come back from employment, Chase?\u201d\n\u201cJust because we haven\u2019t seen them return\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo. They don\u2019t come back. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nOver by the fire, the storyteller wraps up his yarn. The listeners stand and stretch. Chase and Victoria get up, link hands, and walk to Chase\u2019s apartment.\nHe can tell the holo isn\u2019t happy, but he doesn\u2019t even care.\nChase leads Victoria through the worn doorway of his coffee shop. The barista quirks one pierced eyebrow at their entwined hands, then makes a kissy face at him.\n\u201cStop it,\u201d he says, though he can\u2019t even pretend to frown.\nVictoria\u2019s gaze flickers around the cramped, colorful room. The coffee shop is like a time capsule, Chase realizes, a glimpse into the aging barista\u2019s pre-Shift life. Chase can barely remember these not-so-long-ago times, and that depresses the hell out of him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the shore,\u201d he says, \u201cJust the two of us.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go far. We have to be here in case we\u2019re drafted.\u201d\nDrafted for a job that we\u2019re not really needed for, he thinks. Sent to be carved up and shoved into drawers, never to return. He still can\u2019t believe that, even if he\u2019s acting as though it\u2019s true. \u201cWe could go out to the coast on Friday afternoon, camp for two days, and be back in time for the next draft.\u201d Saturdays and Sundays were always free, a vestige of the pre-Shift weekly routine.\n\u201cSupposed to be nice out there,\u201d says the barista as she wipes down the countertop the old-fashioned way, with a rag.\nVictoria only has to think for a moment. \u201cYes. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\nThe barista sighs and folds her hands into the shape of a heart. Chase throws an empty sweetener packet at her. \u201cGo back to work.\u201d\nThey all laugh at that.\nThe holo pouts as Chase packs a duffel bag with his least-scuffed casual wear. \u201cIt\u2019s another woman, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not talking about Victoria. It can\u2019t form any memories. He lies anyway. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. And you don\u2019t exist anymore, sweetheart.\u201d\nIt pauses, then repeats the same line in the same stilted tone.\nChase doesn\u2019t have time for this. He has only a scant forty-eight hours in the country with Victoria, away from the drones, away from the holo. He throws an extra set of socks into his bag and zips it up. \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything while I\u2019m gone.\u201d\nHe knows it\u2019s not sentient. He knows it\u2019s not Marybeth. Her body is in the drawers of her cubicle and her mind is in a drone. It still hurts when the holo locks itself in the bathroom and turns on the tap.\nThe doorbell rings. Victoria.\nShe locks eyes with the holo, then glances at Marybeth\u2019s sketches. The blood runs to Chase\u2019s ears, and before Victoria can ask any questions he takes her bag and throws it over his shoulder with his own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good likeness,\u201d Victoria says, but Chase doesn\u2019t ask if she means the holo or his charcoal image.\nThe path to the nearest transit station is littered with all the nervous people thronging the sidewalks, taking their daily constitutionals to nowhere. For the first time in ages, Chase feels no desire to look at the drone-flecked sky. It feels like freedom.\n\u201cAfter you,\u201d he says, dropping two chits into the turnstile.\nThe drones kept the light rail running, even after the Shift, so Chase and Victoria take it all the way to the end of the line. The burbland stretches out forever, its abandoned houses like diseased teeth in a gaping maw. Nobody can afford to live so far away from the lottery, except a handful of off-gridders testing the patience of the Employment Bureau. Chase had grown up in such a suburb, near a different city. He looks over at Victoria.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou. The ocean. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She yawns, and it turns into a smile.\nChase puts an arm around her. There\u2019s nothing more to say.\nBrakes screech as the train pulls into the station. They\u2019ll have to walk the rest of the way to the sea. Chase helps boost the barefoot Victoria over a guardrail. His hands become slick with the watery blood from her heel. She must have scratched it somewhere.\nI should have bought her new shoes with my extra chits, he thinks. Too late now.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d she says, though he hasn\u2019t even asked her, and he knows she\u2019s lying.\n\u201cNot too much longer.\u201d\n\u201cI think I can hear the ocean from here.\u201d Another lie, but Chase can forgive it. He wants it to be true too. They walk down the stretch of highway hand in hand, and he feels only a small pang of guilt at that, a tiny knot that rests at the bottom of his chest.\nWhen the heat makes the asphalt below them into a hot griddle, he and Victoria set up a picnic on the median strip. The not-cheese and ersatz crackers taste terrible, but they gobble them all down anyway.\n\u201cWhat was your husband like?\u201d\nShe frowns. \u201cA serious man. Lived for his work. He was an investment banker. No need for them after the Shift. I think a part of him died when it happened. Before, he didn\u2019t come home until ten most nights. Now he doesn\u2019t come home at all.\u201d\n\u201cMarybeth was the opposite. She loved her freedom, loved the drones for freeing her from something that was pointless. She was an artist.\u201d Chase shakes his head. \u201cIt should have been me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Victoria removes a strand of hair from Chase\u2019s eyes.\nIt\u2019s true, he thinks.\nThe sun is below the horizon when they finally make it to the coast. Chase scouts a rickety shack half-buried under the white sand. There\u2019s a mattress there, with not too many spiders on it, and the springs scream as they collapse onto the thin foam. Victoria falls asleep right away, but Chase lingers for a few minutes, enjoying the feel of her supple body against his.\nNot a holo, he thinks. Never a holo.\nThey\u2019re playing in the ice-cold water when a drone passes by, but it\u2019s Sunday, so they don\u2019t have to worry. Probably maintenance, Chase thinks, tidying up the beach that nobody ever visits.\nHe\u2019s naked as a buzzard\u2019s head. So is Victoria, her clothes stacked neatly near a dune. Her feet are still raw and bleeding, but she claims the salinity of the ocean helps.\nThey\u2019re safe. But when the drone nears, they still hold their breath, waiting for it to pass by. It\u2019s a little one, no larger than a toaster, and it\u2019s heading straight for Victoria.\nPlease, Chase thinks, no.\nThe small maintenance drone reaches out two feelers and strokes her cheeks. It digs its claws into the brown rings of her hair. It beeps one, twice. Victoria trembles.\n\u201cGet away!\u201d Chase yells. He splashes through the shallow water and thumps the drone on its side with his fist. \u201cGo!\u201d Please.\nThe drone turns. It whirs. It squares its glittering optical sensors with Chase\u2019s eyes, and within the glass bubbles of the sensors he can see a miniature version of himself staring back at him. He feels a moment of sickening recognition before the drone speeds away.\nNo. It can\u2019t be her. Chase shakes his head, letting the insane thought pass.\nVictoria collects her clothes. \u201cWe should go. We\u2019ll be late.\u201d\nThey retrace their steps along the highway. Chase doesn\u2019t tell her what he saw, or what he thinks he saw. He doesn\u2019t say much at all.\nWhen they finally get back to the station, the light rail is running a major delay. They\u2019re late for the draft.\nChase doesn\u2019t see Victoria the next day, or the day after that. Thursday is a storyteller day, and so he goes to the abandoned strip mall. He knows there must be some grave consequence for skipping the draft, but it hasn\u2019t come up yet. Maybe it never will.\nOr maybe it\u2019s happening now, he thinks.\n\u201cGather round, friends,\u201d says the storyteller. \u201cThis is a story about a very brave, but very shortsighted leopard.\u201d\nVictoria is nowhere in sight. He leans against the lumberjack\u2019s shin and lights up. Above his head, drones zip along, watching over all of them with foul intent disguised as loving grace.\nThe story is terrible, but he listens all the same.\nErica L.

It wasn\u2019t that I was invited to hold the rope or sing a little spiritual. I was the guest of honor on this one. They was plannin\u2019 to stretch my neck like a goozle-wrung chicken at Sunday dinner.\nThing I\u2019d done was nothin\u2019 on purpose, but in a moment of eyeballin\u2019 while walkin\u2019 along the road on my way to cut some firewood for a nickel and a jar of jam, a white girl who was hangin\u2019 out wash bent over and pressed some serious butt up against her gingham, and a white fella, her brother, seen me take a look, and that just crawled all up in his ass and died, and he couldn\u2019t stand the stink.\nNext thing I know, I\u2019m wanted for being bold with a white girl, like maybe I\u2019d broke into her yard and jammed my arm up her ass, but I hadn\u2019t done nothin\u2019 but what\u2019s natural, which is glance at a nice butt when it was available to me.\nNow, in the livin\u2019 of my life, I\u2019ve killed men and animals and made love to three Chinese women on the same night in the same bed and one of them with only one leg, and part of it wood, and I even ate some of a dead fella once when I was crossin\u2019 the mountains, though I want to rush in here and make it clear I didn\u2019t know him all that well, and we damn sure wasn\u2019t kinfolks. Another thing I did was I won me a shootin\u2019 contest up Colorady way against some pretty damn famous shooters, all white boys, but them\u2019s different stories and not even akin to the one I want to tell, and I\u2019d like to add, just like them other events, this time I\u2019m talking about is as true as the sunset.\nPardon me. Now that I\u2019ve gotten older, sometimes I find I start out to tell one story and end up tellin\u2019 another. But to get back to the one I was talkin\u2019 about . . . So, havin\u2019 been invited to a lynchin\u2019, I took my daddy\u2019s horse and big ole loaded six-gun he kept wrapped up in an oilcloth from under the floorboards of our shack, and took off like someone had set my ass on fire. I rode that poor old horse till he was slap worn out. I had to stop over in a little place just outside of Nacogdoches and steal another one, not on account of I was a thief, but on account of I didn\u2019t want to get caught by the posse and hung and maybe have my pecker cut off and stuck in my mouth. Oh. I also took a chicken. He\u2019s no longer with me, of course, as I ate him out there on the trail.\nAnyway, I left my horse for the fella I took the fresh horse and the chicken from, and I left him a busted pocket watch on top of the railing post, and then I rode out to West Texas. It took a long time for me to get there, and I had to stop and steal food and drink from creeks and make sure the horse got fed with corn I stole. After a few days, I figured I\u2019d lost them that was after me, and I changed my name as I rode along. It had been Wiliford P. Thomas, the P not standing for a thing other than P. I chose the name Nat Wiliford for myself, and practiced on saying it while I rode along. When I said it, I wanted it to come out of my mouth like it wasn\u2019t a lie.\nBefore I got to where I was goin\u2019, I run up against this colored fella taking a dump in the bushes, wiping his ass on leaves. If I had been a desperado, I could have shot him out from over his pile and taken his horse, \u2019cause he was deeply involved in the event\u2014so much, in fact, that I could see his eyes were crossed from where I rode up on a hill, and that was some distance.\nI was glad I was downwind, and hated to interrupt, so I sat on my stolen horse until he was leaf wiping, and then I called out. \u201cHello, the shitter.\u201d\nHe looked up and grinned at me, touched his rifle lying on the ground beside him, said, \u201cYou ain\u2019t plannin\u2019 on shootin\u2019 me, are you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I thought about stealin\u2019 your horse, but it\u2019s sway back and so ugly in the face it hurts my feelings.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s blind in one eye and has a knot on its back comes right through the saddle. When I left the plantation, I took that horse. Wasn\u2019t much then, and it\u2019s a lot less now.\u201d\nHe stood up and fastened his pants and I seen then that he was a pretty big fellow, all decked out in fresh-looking overalls and a big black hat with a feather in it. He came walkin\u2019 up the hill toward me, his wipin\u2019 hand stuck out for a shake, but I politely passed, because I thought his fingers looked a little brown.\nAnyway, we struck it up pretty good, and by nightfall we found a creek, and he washed his hands in the water with some soap from his saddlebag, which made me feel a mite better. We sat and had coffee and some of his biscuits. All I could offer was some conversation, and he had plenty to give back. His name was Cullen, but he kept referrin\u2019 to himself as The Former House Nigger, as if it were a rank akin to general. He told a long story about how he got the feather for his hat, but it mostly just came down to he snuck up on a hawk sittin\u2019 on a low limb and jerked it out of its tail.\n\u201cWhen my master went to war against them Yankees,\u201d he said, \u201cI went with him. I fought with him and wore me a butternut coat and pants, and I shot me at least a half dozen of them Yankees.\u201d\n\u201cAre you leaking brains out of your gourd?\u201d I said. \u201cThem rebels was holdin\u2019 us down.\u201d\n\u201cI was a house nigger, and I grew up with Mr. Gerald, and I didn\u2019t mind going to war with him. Me and him was friends. There was lots of us like that.\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019all must have got dropped on your head when you was young\u2019ns.\u201d\n\u201cThe Master and the older Master was all right.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019Cept they owned you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMaybe I was born to be owned. They always quoted somethin\u2019 like that out of the Bible.\u201d\n\u201cThat ought to have been your clue, fella. My daddy always said that book has caused more misery than chains, an ill-tempered woman, and a nervous dog.\u201d\n\u201cI loved Young Master like a brother, truth be known. He got shot in the war, right \u2019tween the eyes by a musket ball, killed him deader than a goddamn tree stump. I sopped up his blood in a piece of his shirt I cut off, mailed it back home with a note on what happened. When the war was over, I stayed around the plantation for a while, but everything come apart then, the old man and the old lady died, and I buried them out back of the place a good distance from the privy and uphill, I might add. That just left me and the Old Gentleman\u2019s dog.\n\u201cThe dog was as old as death and couldn\u2019t eat so good, so I shot it, and went on out into what Young Master called The Big Wide World. Then, like you, I heard the guv\u2019ment was signing up coloreds for its man\u2019s army. I ain\u2019t no good on my own. I figured the army was for me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like being told nothin\u2019 by nobody,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I surely love to get paid.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention I also didn\u2019t want to get killed by angry crackers and the army seemed like a good place to hide.\nAbout three days later, we rode up on the place we was looking for. Fort McKavett, between the Colorady and the Pecos rivers. It was a sight, that fort. It was big and it didn\u2019t look like nothin\u2019 I\u2019d ever seen before. Out front was colored fellas in army blue drilling on horseback, looking sharp in the sunlight, which there was plenty of. It was hot where I come from, sticky even, but you could find a tree to get under. Out here, all you could get under was your hat, or maybe some dark cloud sailing across the face of the sun, and that might last only as long as it takes a bird to fly over.\nBut there I was. Fort McKavett. Full of dreams and crotch itch from long riding, me and my new friend sat on our horses, lookin\u2019 the fort over, watchin\u2019 them horse soldiers drill, and it was prideful thing to see. We rode on down in that direction.\nIn the Commanding Officer\u2019s quarters, me and The Former House Nigger stood before a big desk with a white man behind it, name of Colonel Hatch. He had a caterpillar mustache and big sweat circles like wet moons under his arms. His eyes were aimed on a fly sitting on some papers on his desk. Way he was watchin\u2019 it, you\u2019d have thought he was beading down on a hostile. He said, \u201cSo you boys want to sign up for the colored army. I figured that, you both being colored.\u201d\nHe was a sharp one, this Hatch.\nI said, \u201cI\u2019ve come to sign up and be a horse rider in the Ninth Cavalry.\u201d\nHatch studied me for a moment, said, \u201cWell, we got plenty of ridin\u2019 niggers. What we need is walkin\u2019 niggers for the goddamn infantry, and I can get you set in the right direction to hitch up with them.\u201d\nI figured anything that was referred to with goddamn in front of it wasn\u2019t the place for me.\n\u201cI reckon ain\u2019t a man here can ride better\u2019n me,\u201d I said, \u201cand that would be even you, Colonel, and I\u2019m sure you are one ridin\u2019 sonofabitch, and I mean that in as fine a way as I can say it.\u201d\nHatch raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat so?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. No brag, just fact. I can ride on a horse\u2019s back, under his belly, make him lay down and make him jump, and at the end of the day, I take a likin\u2019 to him, I can diddle that horse in the ass and make him enjoy it enough to brew my coffee and bring my slippers, provided I had any. That last part about the diddlin\u2019 is just talkin\u2019, but the first part is serious.\u201d\n\u201cI figured as much,\u201d Hatch said.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t diddlin\u2019 no horses,\u201d The Former House Nigger said. \u201cI can cook and lay out silverware. Mostly, as a Former House Nigger, I drove the buggy.\u201d\nAt that moment, Hatch come down on that fly with his hand, and he got him too. He peeled it off his palm and flicked it on the floor. There was this colored soldier standing nearby, very stiff and alert, and he bent over, picked the fly up by a bent wing, threw it out the door and came back. Hatch wiped his palm on his pants leg. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s see how much of what you got is fact, and how much is wind.\u201d\nThey had a corral nearby, and inside it, seeming to fill it up, was a big black horse that looked like he ate men and shitted out saddlebags made of their skin and bones. He put his eye right on me when I came out to the corral, and when I walked around on the other side, he spun around to keep a gander on me. Oh, he knew what I was about, all right.\nHatch took hold of one corner of his mustache and played with it, turned, and looked at me. \u201cYou ride that horse well as you say you can, I\u2019ll take both of you into the cavalry, and The Former House Nigger can be our cook.\u201d\n\u201cI said I could cook,\u201d The Former House Nigger said. \u201cDidn\u2019t say I was any good.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hatch said, \u201cwhat we got now ain\u2019t even cookin\u2019. There\u2019s just a couple fellas that boil water and put stuff in it. Mostly turnips.\u201d\nI climbed up on the railing, and by this time, four colored cavalry men had caught up the horse for me. That old black beast had knocked them left and right, and it took them a full twenty minutes to get a bridle and a saddle on him, and when they come off the field, so to speak, two was limpin\u2019 like they had one foot in a ditch. One was holding his head where he had been kicked, and the other looked amazed he was alive. They had tied the mount next to the railin\u2019, and he was hoppin\u2019 up and down like a little girl with a jump rope, only a mite more vigorous.\n\u201cGo ahead and get on,\u201d Hatch said.\nHaving bragged myself into a hole, I had no choice.\nI wasn\u2019t lyin\u2019 when I said I was a horse rider. I was. I could buck them and make them go down on their bellies and roll on their sides, make them strut and do whatever, but this horse was as mean as homemade sin, and I could tell he had it in for me.\nSoon as I was on him, he jerked his head and them reins snapped off the railing and I was clutchin\u2019 at what was left of it. The sky came down on my head as that horse leaped. Ain\u2019t no horse could leap like that, and soon me and him was trying to climb the clouds. I couldn\u2019t tell earth from heaven, \u2019cause we bucked all over that goddamn lot, and ever time that horse come down, it jarred my bones from butt to skull. I come out of the saddle a few times, nearly went off the back of him, but I hung in there, tight as a tick on a dog\u2019s nuts. Finally he jumped himself out and started to roll. He went down on one side, mashing my leg in the dirt, and rolled on over. Had that dirt in the corral not been tamped down and soft, giving with me, there wouldn\u2019t been nothing left of me but a sack of blood and broken bones.\nFinally the horse humped a couple of sad bucks and gave out, started to trot and snort. I leaned over close to his ear and said, \u201cYou call that buckin\u2019?\u201d He seemed to take offense at that, and run me straight to the corral and hit the rails there with his chest. I went sailin\u2019 off his back and landed on top of some soldiers, scatterin\u2019 them like quail.\nHatch come over and looked down on me, said, \u201cWell, you ain\u2019t smarter than the horse, but you can ride well enough. You and The Former House Nigger are in with the rest of the ridin\u2019 niggers. Trainin\u2019 starts in the morning.\u201d\nWe drilled with the rest of the recruits up and down that lot, and finally outside and around the fort until we was looking pretty smart. The horse they give me was that black devil I had ridden. I named him Satan. He really wasn\u2019t as bad as I first thought. He was worse, and you had to be at your best every time you got on him, \u2019cause deep down in his bones, he was always thinking about killing you, and if you didn\u2019t watch it, he\u2019d kind of act casual, like he was watching a cloud or somethin\u2019, and quickly turn his head and take a nip out of your leg, if he could bend far enough to get to it.\nAnyway, the months passed, and we drilled, and my buddy cooked, and though what he cooked wasn\u2019t any good, it was better than nothin\u2019. It was a good life as compared to being hung, and there was some real freedom to it and some respect. I wore my uniform proud, set my horse like I thought I was somethin\u2019 special with a stick up its ass.\nWe mostly did a little patrollin\u2019, and wasn\u2019t much to it except ridin\u2019 around lookin\u2019 for wild Indians we never did see, collectin\u2019 our thirteen dollars at the end of the month, which was just so much paper \u2019cause there wasn\u2019t no place to spend it. And then, one mornin\u2019, things changed, and wasn\u2019t none of it for the better, except The Former House Nigger managed to cook a pretty good breakfast with perfect fat biscuits and eggs with the yolks not broke and some bacon that wasn\u2019t burned and nobody got sick this time.\nOn that day, Hatch mostly rode around with us, \u2019cause at the bottom of it all, I reckon the government figured we was just a bunch of ignorant niggers who might at any moment have a watermelon relapse and take to gettin\u2019 drunk and shootin\u2019 each other and maybe trying to sing a spiritual while we diddled the horses, though I had sort of been responsible for spreadin\u2019 the last part of that rumor on my first day at the fort. We was all itchin\u2019 to show we had somethin\u2019 to us that didn\u2019t have nothin\u2019 to do with no white fella ridin\u2019 around in front of us, though I\u2019ll say right up front, Hatch was a good soldier who led and didn\u2019t follow, and he was polite too. I had seen him leave the circle of the fire to walk off in the dark to fart. You can\u2019t say that about just anyone. Manners out on the frontier was rare.\nYou\u2019ll hear from the army how we was all a crack team, but this wasn\u2019t so, at least not when they was first sayin\u2019 it. Most of the army at any time, bein\u2019 they the ridin\u2019 kind or the walkin\u2019 kind, ain\u2019t all that crack. Some of them fellas didn\u2019t know a horse\u2019s ass end from the front end, and this was pretty certain when you seen how they mounted, swinging into the stirrups, finding themselves looking at the horse\u2019s tail instead of his ears. But in time everyone got better, though I\u2019d like to toss in, without too much immodesty, that I was the best rider of the whole damn lot. Since he\u2019d had a good bit of experience, The Former House Nigger was the second. Hell, he\u2019d done been in war and all, so in ways, he had more experience than any of us, and he cut a fine figure on a horse, being tall and always alert, like he might have to bring somebody a plate of something or hold a coat.\nOnly action we\u2019d seen was when one of the men, named Rutherford, got into it with Prickly Pear\u2014I didn\u2019t name him, that come from his mother\u2014and they fought over a biscuit. While they was fightin\u2019, Colonel Hatch come over and ate it, so it was a wasted bout.\nBut this time I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you about, we rode out lookin\u2019 for Indians to scare, and not seein\u2019 any, we quit lookin\u2019 for what we couldn\u2019t find, and come to a little place down by a creek where it was wooded and there was a shade from a whole bunch of trees that in that part of the country was thought of as being big, and in my part of the country would have been considered scrubby. I was glad when we stopped to water the horses and take a little time to just wait. Colonel Hatch, I think truth be told, was glad to get out of that sun much as the rest of us. I don\u2019t know how he felt, being a white man and having to command a bunch of colored, but he didn\u2019t seem bothered by it a\u2019tall, and seemed proud of us and himself, which, of course, made us all feel mighty good.\nSo we waited out there on the creek, and Hatch, he come over to where me and The Former House Nigger were sitting by the water, and we jumped to attention, and he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a patch of scrub oaks off the creek, scattering out there across the grass, and they ain\u2019t growin\u2019 worth a damn. Them\u2019s gonna be your concern. I\u2019m gonna take the rest of the troop out across the ground there, see if we can pick up some deer trails. I figure ain\u2019t no one gonna mind if we pot a few and bring them back to camp. And besides, I\u2019m bored. But we could use some firewood, and I was wantin\u2019 you fellas to get them scrubs cut down and sawed up and ready to take back to the fort. Stack them in here amongst the trees, and I\u2019ll send out some men with a wagon when we get back, and have that wood hauled back before it\u2019s good and dark. I thought we could use some oak to smoke the meat I\u2019m plannin\u2019 on gettin\u2019. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the goddamn colonel. Always thinkin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t get no meat?\u201d one of the men with us said.\n\u201cThen you did some work for nothin\u2019, and I went huntin\u2019 for nothin\u2019. But, hell, I seen them deer with my binoculars no less than five minutes ago. Big fat deer, about a half dozen of them running along. They went over the hill. I\u2019m gonna take the rest of the troops with me in case I run into hostiles, and because I don\u2019t like to do no skinnin\u2019 of dead deer myself.\u201d\n\u201cI like to hunt,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some disappointin\u2019 shit for you,\u201d Colonel Hatch said. \u201cI need you here. In fact, I put you in charge. You get bit by a snake and die, then, you, The Former House Nigger, take over. I\u2019m also gonna put Rutherford, Bill, and Rice in your charge . . . some others. I\u2019ll take the rest of them. You get that wood cut up, you start on back to the fort and we\u2019ll send out a wagon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Indians?\u201d Rutherford, who was nearby, said.\n\u201cYou seen any Indians since you been here?\u201d Hatch said.\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThen there ain\u2019t no Indians.\u201d\n\u201cYou ever see any?\u201d Rutherford asked Hatch.\n\u201cOh, hell yeah. Been attacked by them, and I\u2019ve attacked them. There\u2019s every kind of Indian you can imagine out here from time to time. Kiowa. Apache. Comanche. And there ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 they\u2019d like better than to have your prickly black scalps on their belts, \u2019cause they find your hair funny. They think it\u2019s like the buffalo. They call you buffalo soldiers on account of it.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was because they thought we was brave like the buffalo,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat figures,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen no action for nobody to have no opinion of you. But, we ain\u2019t seen an Indian in ages, and ain\u2019t seen no sign of them today. I\u2019m startin\u2019 to think they\u2019ve done run out of this area. But, I\u2019ve thought that before. And Indian, especially a Comanche or an Apache, they\u2019re hard to get a handle on. They\u2019ll get after somethin\u2019 or someone like it matters more than anything in the world, and then they\u2019ll wander off if a bird flies over and they make an omen of it.\u201d\nLeaving us with them mixed thoughts on Indians and buffalo, Hatch and the rest of the men rode off, left us standing in the shade, which wasn\u2019t no bad place to be. First thing we did when they was out of sight was throw off our boots and get in the water. I finally just took all my clothes off and cleaned up pretty good with a bar of lye soap and got dressed. Then leaving the horses tied up in the trees near the creek, we took the mule and the equipment strapped on his back, carried our rifles, and went out to where them scrubs was. On the way, we cut down a couple of saplings and trimmed some limbs, and made us a kind of pull that we could fasten onto the mule. We figured we\u2019d fill it up with wood and get the mule to drag it back to the creek, pile it, and have it ready for the wagon.\nRigged up, we went to work, taking turns with the saw, two other men working hacking off limbs, one man axing the trimmed wood up so it fit good enough to load. We talked while we worked, and Rutherford said, \u201cThem Indians, some of them is as mean as snakes. They do all kind of things to folks. Cut their eyelids off, cook them over fires, cut off their nut sacks and such. They\u2019re just awful.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like some Southerners I know,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMy master and his family was darn good to me,\u201d The Former House Nigger said.\n\u201cThey might have been good to you,\u201d Rice said, pausing at the saw, \u201cbut that still don\u2019t make you no horse, no piece of property. You a man been treated like a horse, and you too dumb to know it.\u201d\nThe Former House Nigger bowed up like he was about to fight. I said, \u201cNow, don\u2019t do it. He\u2019s just talkin\u2019. I\u2019m in charge here, and you two get into it, I\u2019ll get it from Hatch, and I don\u2019t want that, and won\u2019t have it.\u201d\nRice tilted his hat back. His face looked dark as coffee. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you true. When I was sixteen, I cut my master\u2019s throat and raped his wife and run off to the North.\u201d\n\u201cMy God,\u201d The Former House Nigger said. \u201cThat\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I made the dog suck my dick,\u201d Rice said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The Former House Nigger said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s funnin\u2019 you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat part about the master\u2019s throat,\u201d Rice said, \u201cand runnin\u2019 off to the North. I really did that. I would have raped his wife, but there wasn\u2019t any time. His dog didn\u2019t excite me none.\u201d\n\u201cYou are disgustin\u2019,\u201d The Former House Nigger said, pausing from his job of trimming limbs with a hatchet.\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d I said.\nRice chuckled, and went back to sawin\u2019 with Rutherford. He had his shirt off, and the muscles in his back bunched up like prairie dogs tunnelin\u2019, and over them mounds was long, thick scars. I knew them scars. I had a few. They had been made with a whip.\nBill, who was stackin\u2019 wood, said, \u201cThem Indians. Ain\u2019t no use hatin\u2019 them. Hatin\u2019 them for bein\u2019 what they is, is like hatin\u2019 a bush \u2019cause it\u2019s got thorns on it. Hatin\u2019 a snake \u2019cause it\u2019ll bite you. They is what they is just like we is what we is.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is we?\u201d The Former House Nigger said.\n\u201cAin\u2019t none of us human beings no \u2019count. The world is just one big mess of no \u2019counts, so there ain\u2019t no use pickin\u2019 one brand of man or woman over the other. Ain\u2019t none of them worth a whistlin\u2019 fart.\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t had it so good, have you, Bill?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI was a slave.\u201d\n\u201cWe all was,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t take it so good. Better\u2019n Rutherford, but not so good. I was in the northern army, right there at the end when they started lettin\u2019 colored in, and I killed and seen men killed. Ain\u2019t none of my life experience give me much of a glow about folks of any kind. I even killed buffalo just for the tongues rich folks wanted to have. We left hides and meat in the fields to rot. That was to punish the Indians. Damned ole buffalo. Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 dumber, and I shot them for dollars and their tongues. What kind of human beings does that?\u201d\nWe worked for about another hour, and then, Dog Den\u2014again, I didn\u2019t name him\u2014one of the other men Hatch left with us, said, \u201cI think we got a problem.\u201d\nOn the other side of the creek, there was a split in the trees, and you could see through them out into the plains, and you could see the hill Hatch had gone over some hours ago, and comin\u2019 down it at a run was a white man. He was a good distance away, but it didn\u2019t take no eagle eye to see that he was naked as a skinned rabbit, and runnin\u2019 full out, and behind him, whoopin\u2019 and having a good time, were Indians. Apache, to be right on the money, nearly as naked as the runnin\u2019 man. Four of them was on horseback, and there was six of them I could see on foot runnin\u2019 after him. My guess was they had done been at him and had set him loose to chase him like a deer for fun. I guess livin\u2019 out on the plains like they did, with nothin\u2019 but mesquite berries and what food they could kill, you had to have your fun where you could find it.\n\u201cThey\u2019re funnin\u2019 him,\u201d Rutherford said, figurin\u2019 same as me.\nWe stood there lookin\u2019 for a moment; then I remembered we was soldiers. I got my rifle and was about to bead down, when Rutherford said, \u201cHell, you can\u2019t hit them from here, and neither can they shoot you. We\u2019re out of range, and Indians ain\u2019t no shots to count for.\u201d\nOne of the runnin\u2019 Apaches had spotted us, and he dropped to one knee and pointed his rifle at us, and when he did, Rutherford spread his arms wide, and said, \u201cGo on, shoot, you heathen.\u201d\nThe Apache fired.\nRutherford was wrong. He got it right on the top of the nose and fell over with his arms still spread. When he hit the ground, The Former House Nigger said, \u201cI reckon they been practicin\u2019.\u201d\nWe was up on a hill, so we left the mule and run down to the creek where the horses was, and waded across the little water and laid out between the trees and took aim. We opened up and it sounded like a bunch of mule skinners crackin\u2019 their whips. The air filled with smoke and there was some shots fired back at us. I looked up and seen the runnin\u2019 man was makin\u2019 right smart time, his hair and johnson flappin\u2019 as he run. But then one of the horseback Apaches rode up on him, and with this heavy knotted-looking stick he was carrying, swung and clipped the white fella along the top of the head. I seen blood jump up and the man go down and I could hear the sound of the blow so well, I winced. The Apache let out a whoop and rode on past, right toward us. He stopped to beat his chest with his free hand, and when he did, I took a shot at him. I aimed for his chest, but I hit the horse square in the head and brought him down. At least I had the heathen on foot.\nNow, you can say what you want about an Apache, but he is about the bravest thing there is short of a badger. This\u2019n come runnin\u2019 right at us, all of us firin\u2019 away, and I figure he thought he had him some big magic, \u2019cause not a one of our shots hit him. It was like he come haint-like right through a wall of bullets. As he got closer, I could see he had some kind of mud paint on his chest and face, and he was whoopin\u2019 and carryin\u2019 on somethin\u2019 horrible. And then he stepped in a hole and went down. Though he was still a goodly distance from us, I could hear his ankle snap like a yanked suspender. Without meaning to, we all went, \u201cOooooh.\u201d It hurt us, it was so nasty soundin\u2019.\nThat fall must have caused his magic to fly out of his ass, \u2019cause we all started firing at him, and this time he collected all our bullets, and was deader than a guv\u2019ment promise before the smoke cleared.\nThis gave the rest of them Apache pause, and I\u2019m sure, brave warriors or not, a few assholes puckered out there.\nThem ridin\u2019 Apaches stopped their horses and rode back until they was up on the hill, and the runnin\u2019 Indians dropped to the ground and lay there. We popped off a few more shots, but didn\u2019t hit nothin\u2019, and then I remembered I was in charge. I said, \u201cHold your fire. Don\u2019t waste your bullets.\u201d\nThe Former House Nigger crawled over by me, said, \u201cWe showed them.\u201d\n\u201cThey ain\u2019t showed yet,\u201d I said. \u201cThem\u2019s Apache warriors. They ain\u2019t known as slackers.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe Colonel Hatch heard all the shootin\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had time to get a good distance away. They figured on us cuttin\u2019 the wood and leavin\u2019 it and goin\u2019 back to the fort. So maybe they ain\u2019t missin\u2019 us yet and didn\u2019t hear a thing.\u201d\n\u201cDang it,\u201d The Former House Nigger said.\nI thought we might just mount up and try to ride off. We had more horses than they did, but three of them ridin\u2019 after us could still turn out bad. We had a pretty good place as we was, amongst the trees with water to drink. I decided best thing we could do was hold our position. Then that white man who had been clubbed in the head started moaning. That wasn\u2019t enough, a couple of the braves come up out of the grass and ran at his spot. We fired at them, but them Spencer single shots didn\u2019t reload as fast as them Indians could run. They come down in the tall grass where the white man had gone down, and we seen one of his legs jump up like a snake, and go back down, and the next moment came the screaming.\nIt went on and on. Rice crawled over to me and said, \u201cI can\u2019t stand it. I\u2019m gonna go out there and get him.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy you?\u201d Rice said.\n\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m in charge.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 with you,\u201d The Former House Nigger said.\n\u201cNaw, you ain\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cI get rubbed out, you\u2019re the one in charge. That\u2019s what Colonel Hatch said. I get out there a ways, you open up on them other Apache, keep \u2019em busier than a bear with a hive of bees.\u201d\n\u201cHell, we can\u2019t even see them, and the riders done gone on the other side of the hill.\u201d\n\u201cShoot where you think they ought to be, just don\u2019t send a blue whistler up my ass.\u201d\nI laid my rifle on the ground, made sure my pistol was loaded, put it back in the holster, pulled my knife, stuck it in my teeth, and crawled to my left along the side of that creek till I come to tall grass, then I worked my way in. I tried to go slow as to make the grass seem to be moved by the wind, which had picked up considerable and was helpin\u2019 my sneaky approach.\nAs I got closer to where the white man had gone down and the Apaches had gone after him, his yells grew somethin\u2019 terrible. I was maybe two or three feet from him. I parted the grass to take a look, seen he was lying on his side, and his throat was cut, and he was dead as he was gonna get.\nJust a little beyond him, the two Apache was lying in the grass, and one of them was yellin\u2019 like he was the white man bein\u2019 tortured, and I thought, Well, if that don\u2019t beat all. I was right impressed.\nThen the Apache saw me. They jumped up and come for me. I rose up quick, pulling the knife from my teeth. One of them hit me like a cannon ball, and away we went rollin\u2019.\nA shot popped off and the other Apache did a kind of dance, about four steps, and went down holdin\u2019 his throat. Blood was flying out of him like it was a fresh-tapped spring. Me and the other buck rolled in the grass and he tried to shoot me with a pistol he was totin\u2019, but only managed to singe my hair and give me a headache and make my left ear ring.\nWe rolled around like a couple of doodlebugs, and then I came up on top and stabbed at him. He caught my hand. I was holding his gun hand to the ground with my left, and he had hold of my knife hand.\n\u201cJackass,\u201d I said, like this might so wound him to the quick, he\u2019d let go. He didn\u2019t. We rolled over in the grass some more, and he got the pistol loose and put it to my head, but the cap and ball misfired, and all I got was burned some. I really called him names then. I jerked my legs up and wrapped them around his neck, yanked him down on his back, got on top of him and stabbed him in the groin and the belly, and still he wasn\u2019t finished.\nI put the knife in his throat, and he gave me a look of disappointment, like he\u2019s just realized he\u2019d left somethin\u2019 cookin\u2019 on the fire and ought to go get it; then he fell back.\nI crawled over, rolled the white man on his back. They had cut his balls off and cut his stomach open and sliced his throat. He wasn\u2019t gonna come around.\nI made it back to the creek bank and was shot at only a few times by the Apache. My return trip was a mite brisker than the earlier one. I only got a little bit of burn from a bullet that grazed the butt of my trousers.\nWhen I was back at the creek bank, I said, \u201cWho made that shot on the Apache?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be me,\u201d The Former House Nigger said.\n\u201cListen here, I don\u2019t want you callin\u2019 yourself The Former House Nigger no more. I don\u2019t want no one else callin\u2019 you that. You\u2019re a buffalo soldier, and a good\u2019n. Rest of you men hear that?\u201d\nThe men was strung out along the creek, but they heard me, and grunted at me.\n\u201cThis here is Cullen. He ain\u2019t nothing but Cullen or Private Cullen, or whatever his last name is. That\u2019s what we call him. You hear that, Cullen? You\u2019re a soldier, and a top soldier at that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Cullen said, not so moved about the event as I was. \u201cBut, thing worryin\u2019 me is the sun is goin\u2019 down.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s another thing,\u201d Bill said, crawlin\u2019 over close to us. \u201cThere\u2019s smoke over that hill. My guess is it ain\u2019t no cookout.\u201d\nI figured the source of that smoke would be where our white fella had come from, and it would be what was left of whoever he was with or the remains of a wagon or some such. The horse-ridin\u2019 Apache had gone back there either to finish them off and torture them with fire or to burn a wagon down. The Apache was regular little fire starters, and since they hadn\u2019t been able to get to all of us, they was takin\u2019 their misery out on what was within reach.\nAs that sun went down, I began to fret. I moved along the short line of our men and decided not to space them too much, but not bunch them up either. I put us about six feet apart and put a few at the rear as lookouts. Considerin\u2019 there weren\u2019t many of us, it was a short line, and them two in the back was an even shorter line. Hell, they wasn\u2019t no line at all. They was a couple of dots.\nThe night crawled on. A big frog began to bleat near me. Crickets was sawin\u2019 away. Upstairs, the black-as-sin heavens was lit up with stars and the half moon was way too bright.\nCouple hours crawled on, and I went over to Cullen and told him to watch tight, \u2019cause I was goin\u2019 down the line and check the rear, make sure no one was sleepin\u2019 or pullin\u2019 their johnsons. I left my rifle and unsnapped my revolver holster flap, and went to check.\nBill was fine, but when I come to Rice, he was facedown in the dirt. I grabbed him by the back of his collar and hoisted him up, and his head fell near off. His throat had been cut. I wheeled, snappin\u2019 my revolver into my hand. Wasn\u2019t nothin\u2019 there.\nA horrible feelin\u2019 come over me. I went down the row. All them boys was dead. The Apache had been pickin\u2019 \u2019em off one at a time, and doin\u2019 it so careful like, the horses hadn\u2019t even noticed.\nI went to the rear and found that the two back there was fine. I said, \u201cYou fellas best come with me.\u201d\nWe moved swiftly back to Cullen and Rice, and we hadn\u2019t no more than gone a few paces, when a burst of fire cut the night. I saw an Apache shape grasp at his chest and fall back. Runnin\u2019 over, we found Cullen holding his revolver, and Bill was up waving his rifle around. \u201cWhere are they? Where the hell are they?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all around. They\u2019ve done killed the rest of the men.\u201d I said.\n\u201cGhosts,\u201d Bill said. \u201cThey\u2019re ghosts.\u201d\n\u201cWhat they are is sneaky,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s what them fellas do for a livin\u2019.\u201d\nBy now, I had what you might call some real goddamn misgivin\u2019s, figured I had reckoned right on things. I thought we\u2019d have been safer here, but them Apache had plumb snuck up on us, wiped out three men without so much as leavin\u2019 a fart in the air. I said, \u201cI think we better get on our horses and make a run for it.\u201d\nBut when we went over to get the horses, Satan, soon as I untied him, bolted and took off through the wood and disappeared. \u201cNow, that\u2019s the shits,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll ride double,\u201d Cullen said.\nThe boys was gettin\u2019 their horses loose, and there was a whoop, and an Apache leapfrogged over the back of one of them horses and came down on his feet with one of our own hatchets in his hand. He stuck the blade of it deep in the head of a trooper, a fella whose name I don\u2019t remember, being now in my advanced years, and not really havin\u2019 known the fella that good in the first place. There was a scramble, like startled quail. There wasn\u2019t no military drill about it. It was every sonofabitch for himself. Me and Cullen and Bill tore up the hill, \u2019cause that was the way we was facin\u2019. We was out of the wooded area now, and the half moon was bright, and when I looked back, I could see an Apache coming up after us with a knife in his teeth. He was climbin\u2019 that hill so fast, he was damn near runnin\u2019 on all fours.\nI dropped to one knee and aimed and made a good shot that sent him tumbling back down the rise. Horrible thing was, we could hear the other men in the woods down there gettin\u2019 hacked and shot to pieces, screamin\u2019 and a pleadin\u2019, but we knew wasn\u2019t no use in tryin\u2019 to go back down there. We was outsmarted and outmanned and outfought.\nThing worked in our favor, was the poor old mule was still there wearing that makeshift harness and carry-along we had put him in, with the wood stacked on it. He had wandered a bit, but hadn\u2019t left the area.\nBill cut the log rig loose, and cut the packing off the mule\u2019s back; then he swung up on the beast and pulled Cullen up behind him, which showed a certain lack of respect for my leadership, which, frankly, was somethin\u2019 I could agree with.\nI took hold of the mule\u2019s tail, and off we went, them ridin\u2019, and me runnin\u2019 behind holdin\u2019 to my rifle with one hand, holdin\u2019 on to the mule\u2019s tail with the other, hopin\u2019 he didn\u2019t fart or shit or pause to kick. This was an old Indian trick, one we had learned in the cavalry. You can also run alongside, you got somethin\u2019 to hang on to. Now, if the horse, or mule, decided to run full out, well, you was gonna end up with a mouth full of sod, but a rider and a horse and a fella hangin\u2019, sort of lettin\u2019 himself be pulled along at a solid speed, doin\u2019 big strides, can make surprisin\u2019 time and manage not to wear too bad if his legs are strong.\nWhen I finally chanced a look over my shoulder, I seen the Apache were comin\u2019, and not in any Sunday picnic stroll sort of way either. They was all on horseback. They had our horses to go with theirs. Except Satan. That bastard hadn\u2019t let me ride, but he hadn\u2019t let no one else ride either, so I gained a kind of respect for him.\nA shot cut through the night air, and didn\u2019t nothin\u2019 happen right off, but then Bill eased off the mule like a candle meltin\u2019. The shot had gone over Cullen\u2019s shoulder and hit Bill in the back of the head. We didn\u2019t stop to check his wounds. Cullen slid forward, takin\u2019 the reins, slowed the mule a bit and stuck out his hand. I took it, and he helped me swing up behind him. There\u2019s folks don\u2019t know a mule can run right swift, it takes a mind to, but it can. They got a gait that shakes your guts, but they\u2019re pretty good runners. And they got wind and they\u2019re about three times smarter than a horse.\nWhat they don\u2019t got is spare legs for when they step in a chuckhole, and that\u2019s what happened. It was quite a fall, and I had an idea then how that Apache had felt when his horse had gone out from under him. The fall chunked me and Cullen way off and out into the dirt, and it damn sure didn\u2019t do the mule any good.\nOn the ground, the poor old mule kept tryin\u2019 to get up, but couldn\u2019t. He had fallen so that his back was to the Apache, and we was tossed out in the dirt, squirmin\u2019. We crawled around so we was between his legs, and I shot him in the head with my pistol and we made a fort of him. On came them Apache. I took my rifle and laid it over the mule\u2019s side and took me a careful bead, and down went one of them. I fired again, and another hit the dirt. Cullen scuttled out from behind the mule and got hold of his rifle where it had fallen, and crawled back. He fired off a couple of shots, but wasn\u2019t as lucky as me. The Apache backed off, and at a distance they squatted down beside their horses and took pot shots at us.\nThe mule was still warm and he stunk. Bullets were splatterin\u2019 into his body. None of them was comin\u2019 through, but they was lettin\u2019 out a lot of gas. Way I had it figured, them Indians would eventually surround us and we\u2019d end up with our hair hangin\u2019 on their wickiups by mornin\u2019. Thinkin\u2019 on this, I made an offer to shoot Cullen if it looked like we was gonna be overrun.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d rather shoot you then shoot myself,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s a deal, then,\u201d I said.\nIt was a bright night and they could see us good, but we could see them good too. The land was flat there, and there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of creepin\u2019 up they could do without us noticin\u2019, but they could still outflank us because they outnumbered us. There was more Apache now than we had seen in the daytime. They had reinforcements. It was like a gatherin\u2019 of ants.\nThe Apache had run their horses all out, and now they was no water for them, so they cut the horse\u2019s throats and lit a fire. After a while we could smell horse meat sizzlin\u2019. The horses had been killed so that they made a ring of flesh they could hide behind, and the soft insides was a nice late supper.\n\u201cThey ain\u2019t got no respect for guv\u2019ment property,\u201d Cullen said.\nI got out my knife and cut the mule\u2019s throat, and he was still fresh enough blood flowed, and we put our mouths on the cut and sucked out all we could. It tasted better than I would have figured, and it made us feel a mite better too, but with there just bein\u2019 the two of us, we didn\u2019t bother to start a fire and cook our fort.\nWe could hear them over there laughin\u2019 and a cuttin\u2019 up, and I figure they had them some mescal, \u2019cause after a bit, they was actually singin\u2019 a white man song, \u201cRow, row, row you boat,\u201d and we had to listen to that for a couple of hours.\n\u201cGoddamn missionaries,\u201d I said.\nAfter a bit, one of them climbed over a dead horse and took his breechcloth down and turned his ass to us and it winked dead-white in the moonlight, white as any Irishman\u2019s ass. I got my rifle on him, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t let the hammer down. It just didn\u2019t seem right to shoot some drunk showin\u2019 me his ass. He turned around and peed, kind of pushin\u2019 his loins out, like he was doin\u2019 a squaw, and laughed, and that was enough. I shot that sonofabitch. I was aimin\u2019 for his pecker, but I think I got him in the belly. He fell over and a couple of Apache come out to get him. Cullen shot one of them, and the one was left jumped over the dead horses and disappeared behind them.\n\u201cBad enough they\u2019re gonna kill us,\u201d Cullen said, \u201cbut they got to act nasty too.\u201d\nWe laid there for a while. Cullen said, \u201cMaybe we ought to pray for deliverance.\u201d\n\u201cPray in one hand, shit in the other, and see which one fills up first.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I won\u2019t pray,\u201d he said. \u201cOr shit. Least not at the moment. You remember, that\u2019s how we met. I was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI remember,\u201d I said.\nWell, we was waitin\u2019 for them to surround us, but like Colonel Hatch said, you can never figure an Apache. We laid there all night, and nothin\u2019 happen. I\u2019m ashamed to say, I nodded off, and when I awoke it was good and daylight and hadn\u2019t nobody cut our throats or taken our hair.\nCullen was sittin\u2019 with his legs crossed, lookin\u2019 in the direction of the Apache. I said, \u201cDamn, Cullen. I\u2019m sorry. I fell out.\u201d\n\u201cI let you. They\u2019re done gone.\u201d\nI sat up and looked. There was the horses, buzzards lightin\u2019 on them, and there were a few of them big ole birds on the ground eyeballin\u2019 our mule, and us. I shooed them, said, \u201cI\u2019ll be damn. They just packed up like a circus and left.\u201d\n\u201cYep. Ain\u2019t no rhyme to it. They had us where they wanted us. Guess they figured they\u2019d lost enough men over a couple of buffalo soldiers, or maybe they saw a bird like Colonel Hatch was talkin\u2019 about, and he told them to take themselves home.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I figure is they just too drunk to carry on, and woke up with hangovers and went somewhere cool and shaded to sleep it off.\u201d\n\u201cReckon so,\u201d Cullen said. Then: \u201cHey, you mean what you said about me bein\u2019 a top soldier and all?\u201d\n\u201cYou know it.\u201d\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t a colonel or nothin\u2019, but I appreciate it. Course, I don\u2019t feel all that top right now.\u201d\n\u201cWe done all we could do. It was Hatch screwed the duck. He ought not have separated us from the troop like that.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t reckon he\u2019ll see it that way,\u201d Cullen said.\n\u201cI figure not,\u201d I said.\nWe cut off chunks of meat from the mule and made a little fire and filled our bellies, then we started walkin\u2019. It was blazin\u2019 hot, and still we walked. When nightfall come, I got nervous, thinkin\u2019 them Apache might be comin\u2019 back, and that in the long run they had just been funnin\u2019 us. But they didn\u2019t show, and we took turns sleepin\u2019 on the hard plains.\nNext mornin\u2019 it was hot, and we started walkin\u2019. My back hurt and my ass was draggin\u2019 and my feet felt like someone had cut them off. I wished we had brought some of that mule meat with us. I was so hungry, I could see cornbread walkin\u2019 on the ground. Just when I was startin\u2019 to imagine pools of water and troops of soldiers dancin\u2019 with each other, I seen somethin\u2019 that was a little more substantial.\nSatan.\nI said to Cullen, \u201cDo you see a big black horse?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, Satan?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cI see him.\u201d\n\u201cDid you see some dancin\u2019 soldiers?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cDo you still see the horse?\u201d\n\u201cYep, and he looks strong and rested. I figure he found a water hole and some grass, the sonofabitch.\u201d\nSatan was trottin\u2019 along, not lookin\u2019 any worse for wear. He stopped when he seen us, and I tried to whistle to him, but my mouth was so dry, I might as well have been trying to whistle him up with my asshole.\nI put my rifle down and started walkin\u2019 toward him, holdin\u2019 out my hand like I had a treat. I don\u2019t think he fell for that, but he dropped his head and let me walk up on him. He wasn\u2019t saddled, as we had taken all that off when we went to cut wood, but he still had his bridle and reins. I took hold of the bridle. I swung onto his back, and then he bucked. I went up and landed hard on the ground. My head was spinnin\u2019, and the next thing I know, that evil bastard was nuzzlin\u2019 me with his nose.\nI got up and took the reins and led him over to where Cullen was leanin\u2019 on his rifle. \u201cDown deep,\u201d he said, \u201cI think he likes you.\u201d\nWe rode Satan double back to the fort, and when we got there, a cheer went up. Colonel Hatch come out and shook our hands and even hugged us. \u201cWe found what was left of you boys this mornin\u2019, and it wasn\u2019t a pretty picture. They\u2019re all missin\u2019 eyes and balls sacks and such. We figured you two had gone under with the rest of them. Was staked out on the plains somewhere with ants in your eyes. We got vengeful and started trailin\u2019 them Apache, and damn if we didn\u2019t meet them comin\u2019 back toward us, and there was a runnin\u2019 fight took us in the direction of the Pecos. We killed one, but the rest of them got away. We just come ridin\u2019 in a few minutes ahead of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d have come straight on,\u201d Cullen said, \u201cyou\u2019d have seen us. And we killed a lot more than one.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Hatch said, \u201cand we want to hear your story and Nate\u2019s soon as you get somethin\u2019 to eat and drink. We might even let you have a swallow of whiskey. Course, Former House Nigger here will have to do the cookin\u2019, ain\u2019t none of us any good.\u201d\n\u201cThat there\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, \u201cbut, my compadre here, he ain\u2019t The Former House Nigger. He\u2019s Private Cullen.\u201d\nColonel Hatch eyeballed me. \u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d\n\u201cYes sir, I do, even if it hair lips the United States Army.\u201d\n\u201cHell,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThat alone is reason to say it.\u201d\nThere ain\u2019t much to tell now. We said how things was, and they did some investigatin\u2019, and damn if we wasn\u2019t put in for medals. We didn\u2019t never get them, \u2019cause they was slow about given coloreds awards, and frankly, I didn\u2019t think we deserved them, not with us breakin\u2019 and runnin\u2019 the way we did, like a bunch of little girls tryin\u2019 to get in out of the rain, leavin\u2019 them men behind. But we didn\u2019t stress that part when we was tellin\u2019 our story. It would have fouled it some, and I don\u2019t think we had much choice other than what we did. We was as brave as men could be without gettin\u2019 ourselves foolishly killed.\nStill, we was put in for medals, and that was somethin\u2019. In time, Cullen made the rank of Top Soldier. It wasn\u2019t just me tellin\u2019 him no more. It come true. He become a sergeant, and would have made a good one too, but he got roarin\u2019 drunk and set fire to a dead pig and got his stripes taken and spent some time in the stockade. But that\u2019s another story.\nI liked the cavalry right smart myself, and stayed on there until my time run out and I was supposed to sign up again, and would have too, had it not been for them Chinese women I told you about at the first. But again, that ain\u2019t this story. This is the one happened to me in the year of 1870, out there on them hot West Texas plains. I will add a side note. The army let me keep Satan when I was mustered out, and I grew to like him, and he was the best horse I ever had, and me and him became friends of a sort, until 1872, when I had to shoot him and feed him to a dog and a woman I liked better.\nOriginally published in Warriors edited by George R.

The mourners stood. They had removed the broad-brimmed hats, which might have offered relief, out of respect. Sweat dripped from the uncovered foreheads, into the stoic, animal eyes. The dust-covered bandanas, wrapped around the face to protect the lungs from irritation in the long, dry fields, darkened, grew oppressive with sweat. To a committee member, the dark rags would suggest hands, clamped over the nose and mouth.\n But the masks allowed messages to travel between mourners. Beneath the merciless palm of the sun, Raz\u2019s uncovered head pounded. Beneath the floral cloth, his lips parted. He paused, throat parched; coughed a short, dry, bark. The flat plain stretched to every side of him, tilted as though to tip him into the porcelain sky. He pressed his knuckles to his eyes; the vertigo faded.\n \u201cWe have endured\u2014\u201d he searched for a word to fit the shape the feeling took in his mind, \u201copulent cruelty. Devastating enough in a single instance to burn the humanity from a worker\u2019s soul. Against us, meted out again and again and again!\u201d\n \u201cMelodrama,\u201d replied Mer. Her lips pushed against the silty bandana, she licked them, continued. \u201cThat is the real opium of the masses, Raz. Be sensible.\u201d\n \u201cA memorial is no place for sense. It is a place for passion and clarity.\u201d The small mic that hooked over his left ear measured the minute vibrations of facial muscle and bone precisely enough to capture and transmit the disgust with which Raz thought. It was possible because of Terra, the messaging technology they all used. Mer remained silent, weary of their disagreement. Raz clenched his jaw, static sizzled through his earpiece. The sun beat, beat anew, beat continuously. The man standing in front of the trench said words, more words. Raz tried to think other words. Many came to him; he didn\u2019t want any of them. And then, abruptly, none. A feeling and an image: the image was of a metal ladle dipping into a basin of water; the feeling was clarity. Then only did the right words come. \u201cThey force us to stand, mourn, burn in this desperate heat. It is beyond reason,\u201d he said. He shut his eyes briefly to the sun. \u201cMadness,\u201d he confirmed, \u201cand it must be overthrown by madness.\u201d\n Surveillance drones spun overhead, recorded silent, passive mourners.\n Committee on the Oversight of Memorialization had not considered the intensity of the sun at high noon at all.\n \u201cWhat time should we schedule\u2014\u201d Davidson scrolled through a line of numbers \u201c\u2014Memorial fifty-six?\u201d Davidson looked up at the circle of faces around him. For a moment, they hovered, blurrily bodiless. He blinked twice and they re-pixelated.\n \u201cI\u2019d like it to end early. Well before evening traffic,\u201d a woman with pressed hair said. The heads in the room chuckled at her eye roll. \u201cShopping and dining decreased seven percent the evening of Memorial twenty-seven.\u201d\n \u201cOne of the neighborhoods from last week\u2014\u201d Davidson blinked to another tab on his screen, \u201csent in a formal request that mourners be directed to a different course home.\u201d\n \u201cThey didn\u2019t go through the upper?\u201d Robertson asked, his voice transmitted from the office down the hall from Davidson\u2019s, as well as over the holo-mic.\n \u201cThey did,\u201d Davidson affirmed. The heads in the room chuckled again. In the brief pause that followed, Davidson watched a seagull floating past the corner of his eye. The south-facing window in Davidson\u2019s corner office overlooked the river, a gray-green mottle beneath a layer of full, fat clouds. Maybe it will rain, Davidson thought. He heard somewhere\u2014inside of his head, deeper, more central to him than his earpiece\u2014the precise articulation of raindrops on a tin roof; the roof sat, slanted; his mother\u2019s face appeared, halfway framed by jumbled branches, blurry; he blinked to clear her image and\u2014he snapped his attention back to the meeting, embarrassed.\n \u201cWell?\u201d the pressed woman asked, peering at Davidson. It seemed that she had asked a question, to everyone or to Davidson, and he had missed it. He waited for her to repeat herself. After a moment she said, \u201cyou will agree that enforcement is necessary this time?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s make it noon,\u201d said Willis, before Davidson could answer. \u201cWon\u2019t disturb the important morning hours for reflection, over well before evening relaxation. No need for enforcement if we move the whole thing to the outers. There\u2019s more space there. Let\u2019s see them complain about that.\u201d\n \u201cOh they\u2019ll complain,\u201d Davidson retorted. He felt bitter, was embarrassed by it. Still, the response lingered somatically\u2014a hand pressed against a door that\u2019s swung closed\u2014was it sadness? A sense of injustice? A desire for the time and care he spent organizing these memorials to be recognized by those bandana-wearing, dust-covered, dirty\u2014he stopped himself. No use thinking that. Some people weren\u2019t considerate, weren\u2019t built that way.\n A knock came at Davidson\u2019s door and a face peered into his office. Davidson waved the secretary in. She carried bags of the takeout he\u2019d ordered for lunch: juicy, butter-basted \u201csteak,\u201d sweet roasted potatoes, a small salad of tender new greens.\n Davidson adjourned the meeting, switched off his holo-mic, logged out of Terra. He gazed upon the spread before him and was content.\n \n *Minor updates to DAVIDS.MEM1\n \n \n *Add img\n \n \n *Fix link\n \n \n *Remove cruft\n \n \n *Remove cruft\n \n \n - <img src=\"mem.tinroof/childhood/rain.png\" pxls=640>\n \n \n + <img src=\"mem.tinroof/childhood/rain/mother.png\" pxls=800>\n \n \n **MEM1 is a project from the [MOMAPS] that reconstitutes images synthesized by human1 brains and adds them to a master HUMAN image directory.\n \n Raz dropped a beetle larva into the treated linen pouch tied around his waist. He was a third of the way through the row; there were eight rows in this field. Seven fields to cover before break. Rising into view at the end of his row, like a rough brown bear, was the northernmost patrol tower. Its wooden legs five feet high\u2014not high enough\u2014supported a narrow platform. A tin roof, which shielded the sun but also reflected the heat on whoever was standing beneath it, propped over the patroller. Raz raised a hand toward the patrol, saw a hand raise in return. Beyond the tower, the outer swamp stretched flat, stale, hard. It should have been mud.\n \u201cMorning,\u201d said Mer. He shrugged, and she pulled the bandana down from her mouth. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said again. \u201cNew guest today.\u201d\n He hooked his earpiece over his ear, mouthed the password. The cohosts of The Uprising, overlapping, mid-debate:\n \u201c\u2014ology is available. Look at the gardens in the uppers, I\u2019m talking seven, ten, and thirteen especially, to see\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014mostly pet projects. Their roses, their carrots, their what-have-you, turning them to compost once they\u2019ve rotted. I heard this woman say, \u2018you don\u2019t actually eat the stuff that comes from the ground do you?\u2019 These jackholes, sorry, don\u2019t even realize what most of us eat is not grown in a lab\u2014\u201d\n They both laughed. A pause, and a third voice, soft, assured\u2014a mid voice, office voice, Raz thought\u2014began.\n \u201cThe tech is here,\u201d it said. Crumbs of laughter from the hosts, clean silence as they muted their mics. The voice continued. \u201cGovernment could replace all workers with robotic units in two years.\u201d\n One of the cohosts cut in with the old challenges\u2014even if the tech existed it wasn\u2019t scalable; bots would crush the pests where human workers were trained to humanely relocate them; ag was the biggest employer in Mid Region, there would be an unemployment crisis. He was flat-voiced, that attempt at casual superiority lowers got.\n \u201cNo,\u201d cocky midder inflection, \u201cscaling and training units is a one-time cost, manageable. And West Region has tested a guaranteed wage model for five years. While there were some drops in productivity measures the first two years, they\u2019ve risen substantially since then. The numbers just aren\u2019t made available. Especially these numbers. Across all fields and outers, there is a thirty percent loss in labor every ninety days. Though it is estimated that the robots would have a significantly lower fail-rate, fifteen to seventeen percent, the replacement cost would still be prohibitive. The current replacement cost is, in terms of dollars, free.\u201d\n There was a click, a hum, the sound of the hosts\u2019 mics switched on but capturing nothing. A well of static that Raz, anyone listening, could topple into. He had been stooping, inspecting, picking, moving, while he listened. Now, he paused the podcast, stopped. Straightened his back. Knowledge known was less dizzying than knowledge stated.\n So, there was reason. But reason assembled from instructions utterly alien, utterly strange. A brain that could apprehend those instructions would need to itself be alien and strange, so distorted by its own weird and internal organization (he wondered whether such brains looked, or were materially different, from his; different grooves, different folds) that it could take in the garbled demands of those instructions and churn them, sausage-like, into some legible product. And not itself be broken in the process. Not a brain he would recognize as human. But then, he was not the arbiter. He felt a strange loneliness, an aloneness. He saw that other workers, in other rows, had stopped working. They were each alone, in confrontation with madness.\n A drone buzzed over his head, dipped low, sent a neat needle of pain through his crown. Other drones across the field swooped to other workers. His drone emitted its disciplinary bleat, switched frequency midway, and began to emit the blaring, continuous alarm sound. The sound sang over the field, raising the heads that had still been bent. He felt the word first, the muscles behind his ears tightening\u2014not mechanical, a somatic response\u2014until it coalesced in his mind and became, \u201cATTACK.\u201d The horizon convulsed. Raz squinted. The tower, shuddering, then falling. Several thickly muscled and clawed bodies coalesced from the convulsion. Raz noticed, in the eternal moment before his mind kicked back into gear, the melt of sun onto the nearest tiger\u2019s brindled side, its fur rippling across its ribs, the bright candy splash of the patroller\u2019s blood on dirt. And then the pounding of feet fleeing shook his attention free, and Raz ran in a jagged pattern across the field, covering the back of his head without thinking. The drills made flight nearly automatic, almost robotic.\n Raz sat groggy from pain meds in the hospital bed, starched sheets and felt blanket bunched at his waist. His fingers? They moved when he thought about them. He hovered them above clean gauze. Three carved lines segmented the meat of his forearm beneath. River, shallow tributaries. He had tumbled, ground-sky-ground, Mer\u2019s face and her hair, her hand, blast from a gun, and he was, at last, dragged from the fields not by unfriendly teeth, claws, but fingers, palms. He blinked past headlines. Past \u201cFields claim new victims.\u201d Past \u201cExotic tigers or domestic terrorists?\u201d Past \u201cPublic mourning or public nuisance?\u201d Blinked twice to open \u201cPaleo brownie balls: with sunflower butter.\u201d\n \n *Updates to RASHAD.MEM3\n \n \n *Find terms\n \n \n - search/''-Rashad.x@v3\n \n \n with:\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Trauma'\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Tiger'\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Fear'\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Choices'\n \n \n - name: Install dependencies\n \n \n run: |\n \n \n sudo apt update\n \n \n **!MEM3 (beta) is a project from the [MOMAPS Team] that asks: Can we use human1 generated search indices to accelerate brain-mapping in order to predict human3 behavior?\n \n It had not rained in three months. But the committee was not meeting about the rain.\n \u201cWhy do they insist on calling them \u2018tigers\u2019?\u201d The woman was mid-lament when Davidson clicked on to the meeting. He was a few minutes late, as he hadn\u2019t been feeling well that morning. \u201cIt foments unnecessary panic. It\u2019s not accurate. Accuracy is important. They are not, biologically or anatomically, tigers. They are more like large cats.\u201d The woman, Hendricks, finished without acknowledging the abrupt presence of Davidson\u2019s head.\n \u201cWell, they are large,\u201d offered Willis. Davidson pressed his fingers to his forehead. \u201cSomething wrong, Davidson? You\u2019re late.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d Davidson began, but was cut off.\n \u201cNow,\u201d said the other woman, whose name was Rivera, and who had been appointed to replace Davidson as chair last week. Robertson had been taken off the committee entirely.\n Rivera continued, \u201cHendricks is right, though her reasoning is too simple. We all know that the so-called \u2018field tigers\u2019 are not any such thing. They are of the canid family; their closest relative is the fox. Whereas an adult male tiger can weigh up to six hundred pounds, the average adult female \u2018field tiger\u2019 weighs no more than two hundred pounds. An overfed Saint Bernard.\n \u201cThe laborers\u2019 use of the term \u2018field tiger\u2019 is propaganda. Their insistence of the existence of the \u2018field tiger\u2019 is propaganda. The narrative that they are subject to consistent, deadly, wild animal attacks and will no longer risk their lives on the field is propaganda. The reality is that no one has seen these attacks take place. The \u2018tigers\u2019 are conveniently impossible to photograph with overhead drones\u2014the dust cover in the fields is too thick and conveniently difficult to track. A specimen has not been captured alive in over forty years. As to their contemporary existence? We have only the hopelessly self-serving accounts of the field-workers.\u201d\n \u201cThe workers are in the fields. Where the tigers also are. Would be,\u201d Davidson interjected.\n \u201cAnd yet the propagandistic narrative gains traction, playing the hell out of guilty upper heartstrings,\u201d Rivera spoke over him. \u201cBut let me state for the record: I do not believe that this risk exists anywhere outside of the slosh-holes that pass for brains in these entitled sacks of stringy meat. The barbarians are probably murdering each other.\u201d\n \u201cBut I have seen\u2014\u201d Davidson cut in, immediately unsure of whether he had placed the correct emphasis on the correct word. \u201cI have seen,\u201d he tried again.\n \u201cSurely, that support is contained to the lowers\u2014\u201d interrupted Willis at the same time.\n And, \u201cslosh-holes! Meat-bags!\u201d said Hendricks.\n \u201cMiddle neighborhoods seven and eight also trend toward support. And here is Hendricks\u2019 point,\u201d Rivera continued, ignoring Davidson entirely. \u201cAccuracy. In the hours after last week\u2019s long-form article, \u2018Havoc in Crops Threatens Starvation for Tens of Thousands,\u2019 support for the workers dipped substantially. These are the numbers we must get in front of the media. Furthermore, our official term for these animals will henceforward be \u2018house cats.\u2019\u201d\n There was appreciative laughter, and Rivera smiled. Davidson heard the clink of cutlery picked up by the holo-mic as she paused to take a bite of what looked like salmon.\n A blob of aioli squirted from Davidson\u2019s avocado, tomato, and sprouts sandwich and landed on his desk. He flicked it up with a finger, which he licked clean with satisfaction and without self-consciousness. He still could not tolerate wasting food. Suddenly, the full tenor of the protestors\u2019 incompetence struck him. The wheat\u2014bland and nowhere near as nutritious as synth crops\u2014fed thousands. What wasn\u2019t exported was distributed at subsidized prices to the outer and lower food markets; the remainder rationed into food allotments. It had been the staple of his own childhood.\n Without rapid and immense government intervention, the lowers would starve, plain and simple. It was clear that they had no real appreciation for the coordination and organization it took to feed an entire region; they were counting on the higher-ups to wave a magic wand and take care of them. Well, Rivera was right about the laziness.\n But might there be desperation, too? Perhaps they were being driven by the whip of fear, panic? Fear, once recognized, could be managed. Davidson\u2019s bones barely jostled at the memory of teeth, claws; the tough desperate leanness of the tiger\u2019s body thrashing bitterly against his own (was it his own anymore? That body surely belonged in every sense to a different time, different place, different consciousness). He remembered now only vaguely one hand stretched out against an impossible vision, a sort of dull ache, then nothing.\n \u201cFifty-six were killed in one day last quarter in a house cat attack,\u201d Davidson upped the volume on his holo-mic so that he would be heard. \u201cWhat we might be observing is the demographic\u2019s inability to emotionally absorb the risk levels. I suggest that we coordinate a series of somatic trainings\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Rivera flatly. \u201cLet me assure you. The protestors\u2019 party line, \u2018people over profit,\u2019is effective. It is effective because it is a one-dimensional arrow. Do not let it pierce you. These people do not know us, the real people behind the straw men they erect. They do not want to know you, Davidson, your journey from field-worker to the youngest official elected in Mid Region in a century. They do not care about the complexities or realities of our lives or our jobs. These are not humans we are dealing with, capable of rational negotiation. If there is a beast in the fields,\u201d the last crumb from Rivera\u2019s meal dangled from her bottom lip, \u201cit is the worker.\u201d\n Davidson brushed at his own lip. \u201cThe transcript you shared with us, from,\u201d he scrolled to the top of the document, \u201cuh, The Uprising, shows that they know the total mortality rate is well above one thousand for the year\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHow do you think they get those numbers,\u201d Rivera spoke curtly. Davidson flinched.\n Willis jumped into the pause. \u201cAs to the numbers,\u201d they said, \u201cobviously there is a leak.\u201d\n \u201cA leak?\u201d Davidson asked, incredulous.\n \u201cWillis is right, Davidson,\u201d said Rivera. \u201cAnd we have reason to believe that the leak is you.\u201d\n The Terra message blinked its pale green alert in Sara\u2019s display. \u201cOne sec,\u201d she tapped as Davidson emerged from his office. \u201cHi. Did you need anything?\u201d she asked. Her voice was soft, but confident.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said. Davidson looked odd. His pupils were two drifting orbs, black and glassy. They dulled when he turned his face toward her and out from under the fluorescent rods. And stilled when he met her eyes. \u201cYes. Coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the fancier place? The one with the good milk? Not the other one, the one you usually go to.\u201d\n \u201cRegular?\u201d she asked, standing, holding out a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll need your chip, mine\u2019s glitchy.\u201d\n \u201cDecaf? And some green juice from the little stand. The kind without any fruit,\u201d he said, pausing to face her. His eyes were drifting again.\n \u201cOK.\u201d\n \u201cLast time there was pineapple. Too much sugar.\u201d He tapped his wrist sensor and continued out of the single glass door, down the narrow white hall.\n On her side of the glass door, down the hallway to her right, Sara could hear Robertson shouting. He\u2019d been intolerable since being axed from OM. She rolled her eyes.\n \u201cMeet at The Oak Tree in ten,\u201d she messaged.\n \n Update HOUSE TIGERS file\n \n \n 114 TIGERS\n \n \n @@ -1,2 +1,7 @@\n \n \n + # This is the list of 'HOUSE TIGERS'\n \n \n + #\n \n \n + Add 'Sara Jorgenson' NOTE This does not necessarily list everyone who has \n \n \n + been in contact with the 'TIGERS' organization, as in some cases, they may not \n \n \n + have communicated over TERRA.

She watched Raz through the clean window without attempting to appear as though she wasn\u2019t. His broad hat sedimented with dark-brown sweat; his skin streaked with light-brown dust. Outside, Raz coughed into his crooked elbow, apologized as Sara approached. She placed the coffee cup and juice bottle on a small iron table. He leaned toward her\u2014she leaned back without knowing she was leaning back. He pressed a small plastic packet into her right hand, which was curled loosely at her side. Her arm jerked again, away from the hard, prodding fingers. She nearly fumbled the packet; didn\u2019t; shoved it into her jeans.\n \u201cThat goes in the coffee,\u201d he said.\n \u201cHere,\u201d she spoke, filling the space of her embarrassment with brusqueness. \u201cDavidson\u2019s bank chip. He is going to miss it. His wife already gives him so much shit about not just having it implanted.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re sure we can use this?\u201d Raz asked. His gaze was direct, honest, Sara thought. Something beneath his right eye twitched.\n \u201cNo, I can\u2019t guarantee it. But there is a chance. A good chance, especially if you try quickly.\u201d\n Raz studied the small metal chip, rubbed his thumb against its edge. He turned abruptly and walked, head down, in the direction from which he had come. The street was shady and pleasant, like most upper streets. It was rich in colors from flowers and fabric squares decorated with foreign characters that flew from the wide front stoops of the large houses, that waved as though in greeting. But the gates were closed to Raz, to Sara even, and to everyone, even closed to the people who had their keys, for the greeting promised by the prayer flags was an idea of welcome only. The reality in these houses was of cold indifference, of closed eyes and ears, shuttered to anything that happened outside, on the streets, between people who, being outside, mattered not at all.\n Davidson didn\u2019t rise from the desk when Sara returned. He nodded to the cabinet. \u201cYou can leave them there.\u201d An oval of sweat darkened his shirt.\n \u201cYou OK, Kie?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou honestly don\u2019t look great.\u201d\n \u201cFine. Tired,\u201d Davidson replied. He turned away slightly and refocused his eyes on his screen. She closed the door and returned to her desk. Her top drawer was ajar, the cup she\u2019d placed on her papers inches from where she had left it.\n Davidson dropped into his chair and sipped from one of the cups Sara had brought him. The coffee was hot, sweet, left a bitter film at the back of his throat. The almond harvests were shot. He\u2019d lose money in that stock. That was the price of investing based on values. The river below him streaked through the city like a fish, reflecting the harsh, white light of the late September sun on its scales.\n He was angry at himself for having let Rivera get to him. Of course he had not found anything in Sara\u2019s desk. The sky was a white, hot bowl above him. What was that godforsaken beeping? Could Sara shut it off? The river was streaking by him like a silver train, and he counted the cars as they passed. One, four, seventeen. He would get off in Petaluma. He would bring her a bouquet of greens; he could stop by the synth lab on the way. When was the last time he had been home? She would be so pleased. No, Petaluma was in West Region, he couldn\u2019t be there already. That was hours and hours away. And his mother was dead. Hot liquid was seeping from his desk onto his shirt. There were fast popping noises that sounded like rain on a tin roof. Perhaps it was raining after all. He opened his mouth and waited to catch the drops on his tongue.\n \n @@-13,9 +13,8 @@ MNG:\n \n \n - name: Install dependencies\n \n \n run: |\n \n \n sudo apt update\n \n \n sudo apt-get update\n \n \n sudo apt-get -y install build-essential philosoph2-dev\n \n \n sudo apt-get -y install build-essential litera3-dev\n \n \n sudo apt-get -y install build-essential religion2-dev\n \n \n - name: Test with DAVIDS.MNG\n \n \n run: DAVIDS.MNG\n \n \n **MNG is a research project launched in collaboration with the HUMAN project to build a master directory of HUMAN events using significant events experienced by humans1 in order to define what it \u201cmeans\u201d to be HUMAN\n \n \u201cWhat\u2019s the update on Kie Davidson?\u201d\n \u201cHis wrist sensor alerted the medics.

After logging off, they deleted the apps from their hardware.\n \n *Minor updates to DAVIDS\n \n \n *Minor updates to .MNG\n \n \n *Minor updates to .MEM1\n \n \n *Remove cruft\n \n \n *Remove cruft\n \n \n - <'DAVIDS.x' from .MNG>\n \n \n - <'DAVIDS.x' from .MEM1>\n \n \n - <'human1' from '\n DAVIDS.x'>\n \n \n + <'human3' to '\n DAVIDS.x'>\n \n \u201cKie is dead.\u201d Raz watched the three blinking dots appear and disappear in the upper left field of his vision, waited for Sara\u2019s reply.\n \u201cHow.\u201d\n \u201c . . . \u201d Raz typed the ellipsis, deleted it, typed it again, and sent the message. A long wait. Then, a notification that the user was not available when he closed and reopened the chat to make sure it was not glitching. When the pale blue notification popped up in his vision, nearly an hour had passed.\n \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to.\u201d\n \u201cHe wasn\u2019t.\u201d In Raz\u2019s mind, there was a short space between subject and predicate, into which he might have put something\u2014truth, gesture, sound. He tapped out \u201cSorry,\u201d thought to send it, then tensed his ocular muscles, deleted the word letter by letter. He did not know what he felt. It wasn\u2019t sorrow. Dull bolts\u2014fear, surprise, nausea\u2014thudded against some impenetrable wall inside of him, lay where they fell, inert. A governance system that treats any life as disposable must be taught that all lives are thus disposable. Madness met with madness. The words were stark, black against the clean white wash of his inner vision. This was the message to OM: logical, legible, rational. But still something, elsewhere, inner, trembled. Raz sent an outstretched hand inward, tried to reach at the something just behind the wall, failed, let the hand fall weakly.\n \u201cYou told me he would not die. You said he would get sick.\u201d\n \u201cI did.\u201d Raz wiped a hand over his forehead, squeezed his left eye, shutting off the messaging app. He unhooked the mic from his left ear and let it fall next to him. Abruptly unfolded his body from where he had tucked himself, back against brick, knees to chin. A jolt through his body, once straight, surprised him. He looked down, jolted again his left leg into the ground, found himself twisting his left boot against the asphalt as though to unscrew a cap embedded in the concrete. His T-shirt bunched beneath his armpits. He pulled at the hem with sweaty fingers. Shadows played in the crushed metallic powder of the earpiece. He walked into the late afternoon sun. The high alley walls around him pulled the sunlight into a narrow stream that washed his head now that he had risen; washed the curled black hairs gray, washed the dulled skin white.\n \n *Updates to RASHAD.MEM3\n \n \n *Find terms\n \n \n - search/''-Rashad.x@v3\n \n \n with:\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Trauma'\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Murder'\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Fear'\n \n \n Rashad.index: 'Choices'\n \n \n - name: Install dependencies\n \n \n run: |\n \n \n sudo apt update\n \n \n ERROR\n \n Mer handled the tiny metal chip, totally smooth on each side. She ran her thumb along a pattern of grooves on one centimeter edge. She closed her eyes and wanted to sink into somewhere dark, and deeply piled, and velvet, but Raz\u2019s voice jerked her out. Always Raz jerking her out of her peace. This time, the jerk of his actions too violent, too spasmodic to simply\u2014ignore.\n \u201cBank chip.\u201d\n Mer\u2019s eyebrows came together, she brought the chip right up to her eyes, squinted. \u201cWhose.\u201d\n Raz looked away, that was too frightening, looked again at her. His fingertips brushed his upper thighs. A word moved against his teeth; he swallowed it. He opened his mouth again, wanted to dispel the word. Instead, he wrapped one hand around the upper flesh of his arm and squeezed. Wanted to squeeze his fingers around his entire body, squeeze all of the air and blood to stillness.\n \u201cRaz\u2014\u201d Mer was insistent. As though she was naming him, Raz, the owner of the chip. Naming him, Raz, the name of the dead man. Could he be? His name slid, scrabbled for purchase, slid again, could have tumbled into deadness along with the other name.\n \u201cDavidson,\u201d he managed to say it.\n Raised eyebrows, widened eyes from Mer. \u201cDead. You?\u201d\n \u201cUnh,\u201d the strangled word, it rose halfway out on a tide of bile. He turned sideways and spit. She hadn\u2019t known. He had, in a way, killed him again, by replacing the live Davidson\u2014who had, until recently, still lived in her mind; whose live habitat was, as the minutes passed, shrinking intolerably\u2014with the dead Davidson who, as the minutes passed, was claiming an infinitely large territory.\n \u201cThey\u2019ll hang you.\u201d\n There was a part of Raz\u2019s mind\u2014the forward part\u2014that knew there were clear and calm responses to what was happening. Yes, they could hang him. Yes, he had thought of that. Yes, he had options\u2014could flee, could hide, could and likely would take the known route to West Region. Others had done it. He knew others who had done it. A part of his mind ticked calmly along this channel. He swallowed again, fought himself, lost. He vomited.\n Mer watched his heaving back. This Raz, this angry one whose anger had been a tight fist at his core, holding him together, had pulled too quickly at one finger, then two, then three, and was now loosely heaving before her. Behind her tiredness, there was pain, grief; she already missed him. But it was behind the tiredness, and the tiredness was, mercifully, soft.\n \u201cThe data is interesting Hendricks.\u201d\n \u201cMatches on predicted behavior and actual behavior continue to hover between point zero five and point twenty-seven percent. No way of knowing if this is high, or low, or what.\u201d\n \u201cAn interesting example with Meredith. Terra matched her communication against the indices MOMAPS generated as being most relevant to the situation she is in. Based on the matches it found, and run against the rational predictors of human3 behavior, it predicted that she would either be disgusted or sympathetic.\u201d\n \u201cShe was neither.\u201d\n \u201cNo. She has apparently found a third option.\u201d\n \u201cThe top research institutes created these algorithms. They are objective, neutral, science-based. There must be something wrong with the subjects.\u201d\n \u201cAgreed.\u201d\n Rivera and Hendricks logged off.\n \u201cThanks for meeting.\u201d\n \u201cI was surprised you asked.\u201d\n Steph Robertson looked at the coffee in his cup turning from glistening black to gold as he moved it beneath the hot fluorescent rods that streaked above their small table. He hoped this wouldn\u2019t take long. \u201cIt\u2019s about Kie.\u201d\n \u201cI assumed.\u201d Sara spun her cup on the table. It was white porcelain, chipped on the rim near the handle. It was cheap, like everything in this neighborhood. She had asked to meet in her neighborhood, middle seven. Better than the lowers, better by far than the outers, but she missed the nicely patterned ceramic mugs in the caf\u00e9 by the office. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t bad, as bosses go. But I went through his bank statements. He was getting paid every month by a corporation called \u2018Mother Maps.\u2019 A substantial amount. We couldn\u2019t find anything about this company online. But I remembered the name from somewhere. You\u2019d emailed him about Mother Maps right before you were kicked off the committee.\u201d\n \u201cYou know this how?\u201d\n \u201cI hacked into Kie\u2019s emails.\u201d\n \u201cObviously.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as data security. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n \u201cI know that better than anyone. Besides Kie and Rivera. Maybe Hendricks now. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n \u201cSo what\u2019s Mother Maps? And why did you want to meet with me?\u201d\n Steph sighed. \u201cA conscience, maybe. Look, I know you\u2019re with the, uh, \u2018house cats.\u2019 Just tell me one thing. What do you think you\u2019re working toward?\u201d\n \u201cA decent living wage for everybody. No more laborers dying of tiger attacks. Health care without having to risk your life for it.\u201d Sara stopped as Steph began to laugh. She frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cOh, I see. You\u2019re a spoiled upper brat who never glances at the restaurant bill, who snaps his fingers and\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLook,\u201d said Steph. \u201cSpare me. You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve never been poor. But this is not the issue.\u201d\n \u201cSpoken like a classic piece of upper shit.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not the issue,\u201d Steph said, speaking over her, \u201cbecause Mid Region could get bots in the fields tomorrow, if they wanted to.\u201d\n Sara stopped. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Robertson?\u201d\n \u201cA living wage for everybody, with health insurance by next quarter. And they will do just that. As soon as they get what they want out of this strike.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Sara shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd. It would cost too much. We know all of this. The replacement bots\u2014look, I\u2019ve reported on this.\u201d She stopped herself. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go ahead and explain what I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to explain regardless of what I say.\u201d\n Robertson squinted at her like he couldn\u2019t decide whether she was putting him on. \u201cOK,\u201d he said. Palms lifted from the table, pressed down again. \u201cAssuming you really don\u2019t know. I was asked to leave the committee\u2014you know that much\u2014because Kie and I had been trying to find out more about Mother Maps. I found out. I wanted to go public with the information. They\u2014Mother Maps\u2014paid me. I decided that I didn\u2019t want to go public anymore. I didn\u2019t tell Kie what I found out. He stayed on the committee.\u201d\n \u201cThis sounds like a bad movie. So then what happened?\u201d\n \u201cWhat if I told you that the actual issue that OM wants to distract people from is not food scarcity, and not human rights? It\u2019s Terra. All those invoices from Mother Maps? Terra\u2019s parent company. It\u2019s part of a global mind-mapping initiative. But not just predicting human behavior. Mother Maps wants to come up with a definitive answer about what it means to be human.\u201d\n \u201cWhat does that have to do with the workers? The strike?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s beta testing. How accurately can their algorithms predict how workers will respond to certain\u2014stressful\u2014conditions? OM won\u2019t give the strikers what they want until Mother Maps gets what it wants.\u201d Robertson looked at Sara with something like pity. \u201cYou really thought this was about OM not wanting their bots in the field? A few million dollars in budget? This is about reaching a new frontier in our understanding of existence.\u201d Steph\u2019s eyes widened, and he smiled for the first time that day. \u201cThink about it. We\u2019re finally going to know what makes us human.\u201d\n Hendricks and Rivera met the following week, in person, eyes blinking as they adjusted to the flat, stiff sunlight that whited the quiet upper neighborhood where they walked. Whited the flags at the entryways, whited the doors, whited the welcome mats, whited the whimsical trims that made the neighborhood beautiful. In the late evening sun\u2014all white, all the same.\n \u201cRobertson passed the information to Sara, then?\u201d\n \u201cHe did.\u201d\n \u201cAnd she behaved as expected? \u2018Emotional outburst\u2019?\u201d\n \u201cShe was \u2018somewhat\u2019 but not \u2018very\u2019 surprised. She thanked Robertson.\u201d\n \u201cAnd then?\u201d\n \u201cShe tracked down Raz.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Flight,\u2019 \u2018avoidance of reality,\u2019 or \u2018violent confrontation\u2019 was predicted.\u201d\n \u201cShe tried to understand him. Asked him questions. Not just \u2018how\u2019 but \u2018why.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cDid we code his responses?\u201d\n \u201cNo. They didn\u2019t match any of the terms in any of our indices. They were irrelevant.\u201d\n \u201cI see. And then?\u201d\n \u201cShe removed her earpiece after that.\u201d\n \u201cSo we don\u2019t know where she is?\u201d\n \u201cThere are possibilities. The algorithm said that there was a point twenty-seven percent likelihood that Raz could kill Sara; a point seventeen percent likelihood that Sara could kill Raz; a point seventy-nine percent likelihood they would touch physically (type of touch unspecified); a point eighty-nine percent likelihood that they would each act in a manner not predicted by the algorithm.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s possible that he killed her.\u201d\n \u201cIt is possible.\u201d\n \u201cAs long as it\u2019s possible, the algorithm is not incorrect.\u201d\n \u201cAnd . . . the others?\u201d\n \u201cAs far as we know? Killed them. Dragged them to the outers. Ate their flesh. Buried their bones. The algorithm said there was a nonzero probability of that happening.\u201d\n \u201cAh. Because, otherwise\u2014\u201d\n Rivera and Hendricks had walked the length of the upper, and stood at the edge of the neighborhood, looking out onto the hard, empty expanse of the fields that stretched beyond them. The sky was thickening from flat white to a deeper blue. There were no striking workers. There were no tigers. There was nothing.\n \u201cOtherwise where the fuck is everyone.\u201d\n \n .cache/\n \n \n build/\n \n \n + Rashad/data.addMNG\n \n \n + Meredith/data.addMNG\n \n \n + SJorgenson/data.addMNG\n \n \n ERROR\n \n \n [**MNG Maker**](/MNG/models/mng_maker): MNG Maker is a system for compiling discrete data into a comprehensive meaning generator using an LSTM combined with a BDEN, an architecture called an EFF-BDEN.

The masks were the messages: roses were \u201crun, now.\u201d Yellow daffodils were \u201ceast.\u201d Wisteria was \u201cstop, turn counterclockwise, continue.\u201d The sun had spread then sank into the horizon. Dark now. A thick, covering black. Beneath the sheltering palm of darkness, Raz\u2019s head brushed the lacy hems of leaves, spiderwebs, nests. Branches snapped against his face, against other faces. They were making their way west. Raz heard the crack of a rifle to his left, again to his right, again. A shout. He froze, turned. Around him, the others turned. Their movements were smooth, stalking, powerful. They waited. Until almost as one, toward the deadly animals, their lean bodies rippled, sprang.\n Endria Richardson is a queer Black and Malay person taking her time and writing stories about ghosts, race, rocks, and the prison industrial system.

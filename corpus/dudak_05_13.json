He\u2019s gone mad theorizing on that tear. He\u2019s gone mad counting the rain drops that hang suspended in the autumn air of this narrow Kashgar street; and mad again gauging the progress of her pistol as she levels it.\nHe\u2019s gone mad wondering which will kill him first: a bullet, or the heat of his fatally overclocked brain.\nThere was a time, long ago, when he made a great effort of will to move his right hand on a collision course with her weapon. But of course, his body isn\u2019t overclocked like his modified brain. He devoted volition to his hand in weird, Zen-like shifts for an apparent year before giving up. He wonders what she\u2019ll see. Maybe a twitch before she fires, or before infected processors cook smoking holes through his skull.\nHe\u2019s aware of his rising fever, but doesn\u2019t feel it like he would in baseline time. It\u2019s a barely perceptible global warming. The air on his skin and the weight of his utility kilt are an unchanging tactile cocoon, sound a basal drone. Sometimes the hellish monotony of his final moment is too much to bear. He retreats into memory.\nHe remembers his modification, deep in the bowels of a qingbaochu somewhere between Lhasa and Chongqing. All the agents endured it. After two months of psychedelic torment, they emerged with strange new powers. The one that would be their downfall was considered the greatest: acceleration or deceleration of thought, at will. The former would give them initiative in split-second decision making; the latter would speed them through isolation or torture.\nThe PRC\u2019s sorcerers were optimistic. If they imagined a virus that could set thought-rate fluctuating randomly and beyond design specs, they didn\u2019t picture it in the hands of Uyghurstan.\nIt hit him first in the Urumqi Han ghetto. One moment he was shuffling along with a river of his emaciated countrymen, and the next they flowed past him in a blur. He barely had time to realize he was underclocked before suspicious Uyghur troops buzzed in and whisked him away. Still he decelerated. Months of internment flashed by in minutes.\nHe doesn\u2019t know if she visited during that time. She would have been another flash in the racing patterns of daily activity. Humans came in streams. They were blood, pulsing through routines with each day\u2019s heartbeat. With each beat came the high-pitched whine of daytime clamor, the momentary break of night\u2014with each beat, a staccato of force feedings and med-probes.\nShe probably had access to his little white cell. She must\u2019ve known he wouldn\u2019t recognize her. Was she tempted to come? Was their Tashkurgan tryst just business for her? He entered Uyghurstan via Pakistan, following the rubble of the Karakoram Highway through the Khunjerab Pass. Love was the last thing he expected to find on the Roof of the World. It managed to over- and underclock him at once. Three incredible days shot by, but there were moments that seem in retrospect to weigh centuries. A kind of gravity pulls him back to the ancient battlements of Tashkurgan Fortress, her hand in his, looking down upon the vast green plain sprinkled with white yurts.\n\u201cUyghurstan will never again be Xinjiang province,\u201d she murmured.\nHe was determined to do his part in returning Xinjiang to the fold\u2014and he loved her anyway. Her passion was all the more endearing for its futility. Did she say it to test his reaction? Could she read micro-expressions like he could when overclocked? Had she been waiting for him at the border? If so, who betrayed him?\nIn his endless final moment, he guesses that she must have tracked him after Tashkurgan. He was probably watched in Urumqi. Perhaps he was chosen as a test subject for the virus. When it first yanked him from slow-thought into overclocked fever, he knew what was at work in his brain. For a baseline moment he was there with the doctors in the cell. He heard enough before they sank into slow motion. Then came three subjective weeks in a universe not much faster than the one he\u2019s trapped in now. When Han insurgents overran the place\u2014like a rumbling, inexorable storm front\u2014he had ample time to wonder if they would kill him along with his captors.\nThe clocking malfunctions got more extreme as he returned south. He was trekking over moaning sands when days strobed by in seconds, bringing hunger and thirst like a knife in the gut. He emerged baseline on a straw pallet in a Silk Road Buddhist cave. The ancient walls danced with demons and saints as an old Han anthropologist nursed him back to health. The hermit and his heritage site had survived the Uyghur Dawn. Wang Zhe was grateful for the peeling, oxidized murals when the next overclocking hit: he lost himself in Sakyamuni\u2019s Temptation for a subjective month.\nWhen he emerged again, he confessed everything to the old man in a desperate rant.\nAn underclocking followed. Suddenly he was in the old man\u2019s rickety ACV, hurtling south over the Taklamakan. Somehow sensing that Wang Zhe was baseline conscious, the old man explained, \u201cWe\u2019re both Han, after all.\u201d\nAnother underclocking zapped him into a flea-bitten room in an old Kashgar hostel. The place had once catered to laowai backpackers, and the walls were papered with old maps. Turn-of-the-millennium China was prominent, with its quaint autonomous regions and special economic zones.\nThe old man lay beside him on a dusty mattress. Breathing weakly, lips blood-flecked, he whispered, \u201cLittle brother, are you a Buddhist?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wang Zhe said.\n\u201cSome of us like to tailor our final moment. Optimize our eternity. I looked through the library here. A lot of old Lonely Planets, but no Bardo Thodol. Guess I\u2019d need a lama anyway.\u201d A coughing fit wracked him. Wang Zhe suspected the old man had spent the last of himself coming here. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve read it?\u201d\nWang Zhe knew of the text\u2014Bardo Thodol, The Tibetan Book of the Dead, or Liberation through Hearing\u2014but he hadn\u2019t read it. The old man wanted guidance as he crossed over. \u201cSorry, uncle,\u201d Wang Zhe answered. \u201cIs there anything else I can do?\u201d\n\u201cTell me, do you really think this place can be China again?\u201d\n\u201cIt has strayed before,\u201d Wang Zhe said, \u201cand been brought back home.\u201d\nThe old man smiled. He began to mutter snatches of the Bardo Thodol, playing lama for himself: \u201cI have arrived at my time of death. By means of this death, I will adopt the characteristics of an enlightened mind. I will become compassionate. I will attain perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings.\u201d\nHe barely whispered his last words: \u201cThe present moment is a Bardo, lying between my past and future selves. This Bardo is a chance to know true reality, which is also true self.\u201d\nIn the Bardo of his final moment, Wang Zhe has repeated these words thousands of times. They have become a mantra. The unmoving raindrops have become prayer beads. Past and future have melted away. He has worn his memories out. They\u2019ve been rewritten too many times.\nHe can only accept the street, the girl, the gun. In the end he can only become them.\nWhen a syringe dart finally emerges from the pistol, crawling at a snail\u2019s pace through the rain-studded air, Wang Zhe is incapable of surprise. He cannot hope it contains a vaccine.\nAndy Dudak is a writer and translator of science fiction.

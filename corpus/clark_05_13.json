When these documentarians sat down in 2008 with Believer Magazine, Herzog observed that Morris\u2019s recently released Standard Operating Procedure had the feel of a \u201cnarrative feature film,\u201d despite exploring real people and documents involved in the military abuses of Abu Ghraib prisoners in 2003. Morris readily agreed. \u201cThe intention,\u201d he said, \u201cis to put the audience in some kind of odd reality.\u201d Building on an earlier manifesto by Herzog, he added that his preference was for \u201cecstatic absurdity\u201d over any attempt at disengaged representations of truth.\nIn pursuit of this aesthetic, Morris uses cyborgian constructions like the InterroTron, which emerged from a routine of talking to his subjects by putting his \u201chead up right against the lens of the camera.\u201d When he got tired of conducting his interviews in such an uncomfortable position, he began to wonder: \u201c[W]hat if I could become one with the camera. What if the camera and myself could become one and the same?\u201d The result was a teleprompter projecting his face at his subjects, which allowed for what he called a \u201ctrue first person\u201d experience between his audience and subject, arrestingly direct eye contact and all.\nIn an age of action-packed, CGI-laden space operas and science fantasies, it\u2019s easy to neglect the power of either speculative film or fiction to do what Herzog and Morris strive for in their documentaries: to estrange us from ourselves; to show us to ourselves in an alien light. Yet that approach has a broad literary heritage, conscious or otherwise.\nWilliam Gibson, for instance, holds that science fiction is about the present, never the future, but he also argued in 2011 that \u201call fiction is speculative, and all history, too\u2014endlessly subject to revision.\u201d It\u2019s an argument that Morris, in his long-form online columns for The New York Times, routinely complicates in the field of photography\u2014a domain, like documentary cinema, where visual representation is often misleadingly taken as definitive proof.\nGibson\u2019s assertion also holds true for speculative fiction from the nineteenth century, an era worth examining in relation to present-day media for two reasons: Literary genres weren\u2019t as stringently divided then as they are today, and film had yet to assert itself as a competitive medium for complex narratives. This was a century in which ghost stories were still widely regarded as potential realities, yet Charles Dickens felt the need to provide in-text citations to defend the presence of spontaneous human combustion in Bleak House (1853). This same sprawling, nuanced period allowed Edgar Allan Poe to mislead mid-century newspaper readers with a plausible (but utterly fictional) account of transatlantic travel, and decades later, permitted H. G. Wells the unsettling, cautionary use of a journalistic tone in his stories.\nSuch fluidity between truth forms persists today in the documentaries of Morris and Herzog, whose work focuses less on blurring lines between fact and fiction, and more on drawing attention to how blurry cultural notions of fact and fiction have always been. This is the difference between their work and the narrative impulses, say, of Exit through the Gift Shop and Catfish, two 2010 documentaries that rely on our initial suspension of disbelief and a culminating \u201ctwist\u201d to make their points about the fragility of truth. In contrast, Morris and Herzog anticipate an audience that already views documentary as contrived to some degree, and build on this expectation by consistently foregrounding the strangeness and fluidity of human experience in their approaches to any theme.\nHerzog\u2019s documentaries and blatantly fictionalized films, for instance, reach for what he calls \u201cecstatic truth,\u201d a notion suggesting that capital-T truth exists in some Platonic form, but that such truth is unattainable through facts alone, and so often demands other modes of engagement to be appreciated, if not entirely understood. In a 2010 article titled \u201cOn the Absolute, the Sublime, and the Ecstatic Truth,\u201d Herzog opens with an assertion that neatly summarizes his artistic practice in this regard:\n\u201cThe words attributed to Blaise Pascal which preface my film Lessons of Darkness [1992] are in fact by me. Pascal himself could not have said it better.\u201d\nLessons of Darkness, shot in the oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait, is by no means the only film in which Herzog practices factual interference for poetic effect, but it has the added significance of disrupting major cultural narratives about Western foreign policy in the Middle East. Aside from Herzog\u2019s ecological arguments, which suffuse a great many of his documentary-style films, this is a rare act of politicization, and the confounded anger underlying the film\u2019s aesthetics manifests again in his explanation:\n\u201cAfter the first war in Iraq, as the oil fields burned in Kuwait, the media\u2014and here I mean television in particular\u2014was in no position to show what was, beyond being a war crime, an event of cosmic dimensions, a crime against creation itself. There is not a single frame in Lessons of Darkness in which you can recognize our planet; for this reason the film is labeled \u2019science fiction,\u2019 as if it could only have been shot in a distant galaxy, hostile to life.\u201d\nThe stylized way that Herzog conveys his horror should not be read, however, as in any way immobilizing him as a documentarian. Rather than giving over to the impossibility of representing vital truths through anything but poetic or otherwise alienating film aesthetics, both he and Morris have also explored issues for which social solutions should be (and often are) readily available. The American practice of capital punishment, for instance, features in Herzog\u2019s 2011 Into the Abyss, while Morris\u2019s 1988 The Thin Blue Line is an iconic treatment of the same topic. Indeed, the latter proved to be an example of what mid-20th century Quakers call \u201cspeaking truth to power,\u201d since Morris\u2019s reenactments of a police officer\u2019s murder served to highlight how circumstantial evidence and a prejudicial desire to deliver the death penalty sent Randall Adams (instead of the likelier culprit, a sixteen-year-old named David Harris) to death row. Adams\u2019 conviction would be overturned the year after Morris\u2019s documentary was released.\nThere is little conflict between these filmic approaches, either\u2014only an appreciation of narrative limits, which are more apparent and constricting around some topics than others. As Herzog observes in Cave of Forgotten Dreams, while sitting with an archaeologist who has digitally mapped the Chauvet cave system that holds 32,000-year-old cave paintings: \u201cIt is like you are creating the phone directory of Manhattan--four million entries, but, ah, do they dream? Do they cry at night? What are their hopes? What are their families? You\u2019ll never know from the phone directory.\u201d\nSoon after, we cut to a slice of the crew\u2019s time inside Chauvet, where the guide calls for a moment of silence: \u201cWe are going to listen to the silence of the caves,\u201d he says, \u201cand perhaps, we can hear our own heartbeats.\u201d Herzog complies in the moment, but post-production, for we poor viewers who were not physically present, a visual scan of the cave walls is matched by the rise of audio accompaniment\u2014a heartbeat, as promised, and the ethereal music of Ernst Reijseger, with parts for organ, piano, flute, cello, and choir. In this way, we who may never walk those restricted passageways are granted one artist\u2019s rendition of what it might be like to stand within that natural cathedral.\nThere is nothing particularly new about this maneuver, either\u2014the narrative that allows its audience to experience in the immediate moment what it might never otherwise live to see. On Saturday, April 15, 1844, Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Balloon\u201d was published in the New York Sun\u2014the article a grand old tale of \u201cMr. Monck Mason\u2019s Flying Machine,\u201d which crossed the Atlantic in a staggering three days, bringing eight passengers to Sullivan\u2019s Island aboard the \u201cSteering Balloon, Victoria.\u201d A mere two days later, the article was retracted for the pesky, piddling fact that not a word of it was true: not the extensive descriptions of the vessel or its underlying technology, not the stories of its industrious inventors, and certainly not the precise and exhaustive details of the flying machine during its most momentous operations. The truth was of little consequence, though, to Poe; in an amendment added to future publications of the work (as \u201cThe Balloon-Hoax\u201d) he writes, \u201cand, in fact, if (as some assert) the Victoria did not absolutely accomplish the voyage recorded, it will be difficult to assign a reason why she should not have accomplished it.\u201d\nSure enough, in 1978 the Double Eagle II, an unpowered balloon carrying human passengers, would cross the Atlantic in a comparatively sluggish six days\u2014and of course, long before that feat, a great many other modes of aerial transport would take to the skies in every bit as extraordinary a manner as Poe\u2019s newspaper account promised his mid-nineteenth-century readers. What greater purpose can a speculative story serve, but to bring to life those tantalizingly close futures its generation would otherwise only get to imagine?\nThere is, of course, also a dark side to the use of non-fictional authority to extrapolate worlds to come, as other nineteenth-century fiction amply warns us. In The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), H. G. Wells uses what\u2019s called a \u201cframe narrative\u201d to introduce his cautionary tale of ego-driven vivisection, and that frame serves to enhance the truth claims of the story as a whole. Instead of a simple travel diary\u2014a narrative form that already emulates common non-fiction practice\u2014we first get a note from the protagonist\u2019s nephew, who describes the circumstances in which the subsequent account was found, and in precise terms offers some sense of what could or could not be verified about the story\u2019s particulars. Why adopt a journalistic tone, though, before a story that already uses an autobiographical register? The novella\u2019s subtitle, \u201ca Possibility,\u201d offers one answer: This story of human monstrosity is emphatically intended as an extension of scientific practice in Wells\u2019s day and age\u2014just a step or two from what is, and toward the realm of what Dickens would easily have termed \u201cthe shadows of things that May be.\u201d\nHerzog\u2019s The White Diamond (2004) and Encounters at the End of the World (2007) are mired with shadows, too. In the former, an inventor embarks on a risky balloon trip over Guyana\u2019s rainforest canopy after an earlier attempt took his friend\u2019s life; in the latter, Herzog witnesses the common occurrence of disoriented or \u201cmad\u201d penguins striking out in the wrong direction\u2014headed for a horizon they will die long before reaching. The brutality of nature is a prevailing theme for Herzog, whose cinematic travels have taken him through many landscapes filled with suffering. In 1982\u2019s Burden of Dreams, he describes his immediate environment as \u201cvile and base. . . . It\u2019s a land that God, if he exists, has created in anger. . . . But when I say this, I say this all full of admiration for the jungle. It is not that I hate it. I love it. I love it very much. But I love it against my better judgment.\u201d\nIn their interview with Believer Magazine, Morris picks up that thread of irresistible monstrosity when he exalts the role of spontaneity and planning in equal measure, holding that both exist in documentary and feature filmmaking. \u201cDespite all our efforts to control something,\u201d he concludes, \u201cthe world is much, much more powerful than us, and more deranged even than us.\u201d Neither Morris nor Herzog, then\u2014for all that their distinct directorial styles brand their films\u2014holds himself as master of the worlds he attempts to capture. But they can champion that madness all the same\u2014the attainable and the elusive truths alike; the alien that exists both within and immediately around us\u2014and they do.\nRecently, Herzog lent his distinctive voice to a production by director Ramin Bahrani (Goodbye Solo)\u2014a short film titled \u201cPlastic Bag,\u201d in which Herzog inscribes familiar human yearnings upon one difficult-to-love piece of commercial waste. This, too, is a kind of documentary: the life cycle of a plastic bag on its way to the Pacific (Trash) Vortex, a sprawling oceanic testament to some of our worst environmental practices. We have given life to toxic landscapes like these all over the globe, and there are undoubtedly other, even bleaker stories for each. The tacit threat of this film, then, is that when we are gone, these excesses alone\u2014the worst of us\u2014will speak for our kind. Dare we ask what they\u2019d say?\nThankfully, the science-fictional aesthetic runs both ways in Herzog\u2019s and Morris\u2019s documentaries, just as it did for genre-defying speculative fiction in the nineteenth century. At that strangely familiar border between our realities and our dreams dwell both warnings and wonders: enough creative material, in the right hands, for some semblance, too, of hope.\nCanadian by birth, M L Clark is now based in Colombia.

I had a couple of resources: creative writing classes and how-to-write books whose titles I will omit here out of an abundance of charity. One of the things that I found back then was a lot of pithy truism meant to guide the aspiring writer that carried a weight usually reserved for scripture: Show, Don\u2019t Tell; Write What You Know; and so on.\nAs I\u2019ve gone on, I\u2019ve gone from clinging to these to being skeptical of almost all of them. The one that took the longest to fall from grace with me was Show, Don\u2019t Tell. It turns out that being able to write summary narrative is really important, evoking the physical sensations of everything can get just as dull as exposition, and knowing when to do which one is a critical skill. But I digress.\nAs with so many things, though, there\u2019s an exception. I rejected Write What You Know pretty much in the time it took to hear the last syllable. It took me years to find an interpretation of those words that actually made sense.\nThe truth is, I don\u2019t really know when someone first told me Write What You Know, but given where I was at the time, I can speculate. I took creative writing classes when I was in school, usually because it was a quick three credits of A. The system was always pretty much the same: a class full of college-age students under the guidance of a teacher who\u2014with few and memorable exceptions\u2014didn\u2019t earn a living writing fiction. We met in the classroom, read one another\u2019s work, and told each other what was and wasn\u2019t working in hopes that in aggregate, we were smarter, more sophisticated, more insightful and more nurturing of literary talent than any of us were individually.\nI\u2019ve got no stones to throw here. I\u2019m sure there are worse ways to teach, but the skills I learned were about how to get along well in that kind of class: how to express my opinions\u2014however ill-founded\u2014with confidence; how to offer criticism that sounded a lot like the five people who went before me without quite copying them; how to amend my opinion of a piece of work when it became clear the room\u2014and especially the teacher\u2014disagreed with me. The truth is, those classes were easy and fun. I liked them. But somewhere in there, someone trotted out the idea that you should Write What You Know, and like any good speculative fiction writer, I rolled my eyes and dismissed it.\nBecause, really, had Frank Herbert lived on Arrakis? Had Le Guin summered in Earthsea as a child? Writing what you knew seemed to me like a backhanded way of saying don\u2019t write fantastika. And it was used to mean that sometimes. The prejudice against what I do was certainly part of the academic water in which I swam. I understand from those who are younger or who have more of a taste for that kind of thing, it still is. As a motto for championing strictly mimetic fiction and encouraging more stories about being an undergraduate, it\u2019s dumb.\nBut an interesting thing happens when you distill an aesthetic insight into a bumper sticker. The same words can have several meanings.\nA few years ago, I had dinner with Junot D\u00edaz who in addition to being a passionate and brilliant author also teaches creative writing in an academic setting. We didn\u2019t talk about the rule to Write What You Know, but we did talk about how people teach writing and how they learn it. Junot told me that, in his experience, playwrights in the theater departments know more about structure and storytelling than the creative writers in English departments. After that, the conversation moved on to the role-playing systems we\u2019d all preferred as kids, but that idea stuck with me, and\u2014after having published six or seven novels\u2014I started the process of learning to write. I do that pretty much every three or four years.\nLajos Egri published the first version of The Art of Dramatic Writing in 1942. The copy I have is the 54th edition. In it, he spends a lot of space talking about the idea of premise. I can\u2019t do his argument justice in a few sentences, so I\u2019ll just give you two aspects of the discussion that struck home for me.\nFirst, there\u2019s the idea of starting with a premise. The premise of a story (according to Egri\u2019s analysis) is like one of the morals for Aesop. It\u2019s the argument the story makes. So, for example, Egri says the premise of Othello is \u201cJealousy destroys itself and the object of its love.\u201d For Ibsen\u2019s Ghosts: \u201cThe sins of the father are visited on the children.\u201d Now, working more than seven decades after the book first saw print, I have some quibbles about the role of the audience versus the vision of the artist, but okay. Whatever. I didn\u2019t have the same experience of some of the plays that Egri did. Also fine. Put that aside.\nThe other thing that Egri said\u2014one of the many other things \u2014is that it\u2019s very hard and maybe impossible to write a good, solid story based in a premise you don\u2019t believe. That struck home.\nI have been in critique groups since college, and some of them have been very, very good, especially the ones that included professional writers who took their craft seriously. I have learned a tremendous amount about how to do what I do. And one thing I\u2019ve seen over and over is how a story comes alive when it matters to the author.\nI didn\u2019t\u2014and still don\u2019t\u2014begin anything I do with Egri\u2019s premise theory in mind. But I\u2019ve learned to see what it is in each project I do that I would champion. I try to lean into those arguments and thoughts and ideas. I try to cut out the bits that get in the way. Usually, they weren\u2019t working anyway. I\u2019ve written things that, in retrospect, I can see premises in like \u201cLove alone offers no safety\u201d and \u201cHolding on to a failed relationship leads to debasement\u201d and\u2014more often than anything else \u201cSimplistic morality leads to atrocity.\u201d All of those speak to my experience.\nAnd so I cycled back to Write What You Know.\nWhen someone uses that phrase to talk about the concrete details of a particular life\u2014implying that middle-class college undergrads shouldn\u2019t write about fantasy kings and queens, high school students should only write about high school, Anglos should only write about Anglos, straight people about straight people, men about men, women about women\u2014it\u2019s a small, stupid, venal argument. It\u2019s immoral, and more than that, it\u2019s bad craft.\nOn the other hand, when we use it (as I choose to) to mean Write What You Know To Be True\u2014 write work that, regardless of the setting or the characters or the plot, is based in the sense you\u2019ve made of the world, is informed by the insights you\u2019ve had about what it is to be human, has (in Egri\u2019s terms) a premise you believe\u2014it\u2019s more than just good advice.\nIt\u2019s a statement about the morality of art, because it means that living a full life, building a deep understanding of the world and our place in it, cultivating\u2014however imperfectly\u2014wisdom is an issue of good craftsmanship.\nDaniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

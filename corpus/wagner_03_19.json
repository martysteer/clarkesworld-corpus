Even when she dreamed that gray, dome-headed aliens were tapping at the windows of the shuttle.\n Karen sat up in the bed when she heard the bot coming, though it took some painful effort. The bot entered the room with little scuttling noises, its belt and wheels rasping against the linoleum. It moved slowly between the clutter of furniture, a small blue light blinking on what served for its head. The silhouette of it vaguely resembled a cat: sloped back, head tucked tight into chest, a wisp of a tail trailing behind. The doctors had modeled its main function on that of a feline, and the design of the shell had followed.\n \u201cIt smells death,\u201d Karen had said, bluntly, when her sister came to visit. They were twins, and the pain in her sister\u2019s face made Karen think that she should feel the same.\n \u201cIt can smell? It can\u2019t,\u201d her sister half-scolded, half-asked, focusing on anything but the point.\n \u201cNear enough,\u201d she answered.\n Her sister glanced around, though there wasn\u2019t much to draw the eye. White linens, white curtains, white stucco walls and ceiling, almost untouched by the colorful afghans and overstuffed chair she had moved into the space. \u201cWe could still take you home,\u201d she said, but Karen could sense it still, the reluctance, the guilt.\n \u201cNo, Sara. It\u2019s good here mostly.\u201d\n In the predawn light, though, watching the bot pause ever so briefly at the foot of her bed, Karen wondered about the extent of her lie. Her time in space had given her two centimeters on her sister. But the radiation had stolen something more. The doctors called it a mass, a tumor, something that took up space and energy, but it felt always to her like a hollow there behind her right breast, a nothingness that threatened everything. It was as if her body anticipated the surgery that would never come.\n The bot clicked forward, beeped on some register almost beyond human hearing. It paused at the foot of her bed and she stared at it, daring it to send its silent alarm to the residents on call. They stared at each other a moment, if Karen could call the blue light something akin to an eyeball. There was a hesitation and then a miniscule shifting of the wheels that she interpreted as a tacit truce. Not today. And in the matter-of-fact activity of the bot\u2014which acknowledged her enfeebled state, recognized that she was waiting here for death\u2014there was an odd sort of comfort, she supposed. Skirting the truth took too much energy.\n Her vitals reported and updated constantly on a small transparent tile embedded in the foot of the bed. The text read backwards for her since it was oriented for the doctors\u2019 eyes. It was a habit of hers, once the bot had shoved off, to study that tile, challenging herself to puzzle out even the most convoluted of medical terms, tears welling up in the corners of her eyes as she refused to blink. Blinking was a concession, a small defeat she accepted every day. She wiped her eyes, rubbed the tears into her cheeks, and lay her head back on the pillow. She listened to the pulse of the blood rustling, thumping, in her ears.\n And that made up the early morning hours. Only twelve more hours until one could reasonably tuck one\u2019s feet under the blankets and call it bedtime.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be alright,\u201d Karen said, but the words felt weak, even to her own ears.\n The director shook his head, dug his finger into his ear, and grumbled something under his breath.\n \u201cWhat was that?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what else to ask to move the conversation forward.\n \u201cWe\u2019re a research foundation,\u201d he said. And now he looked almost shamefaced. \u201cNot Make-A-Wish. Do you know how much money we lay out for each launch?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Was it something about the way she stood now, hunched over her waist a bit, curling inwards, that caused people to forget that she had been an astronaut first? An astronaut before a cancer patient?\n \u201cOf course you do, Karen.\u201d Conciliatory. \u201cYou were one of the best. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not denying that.\u201d\n \u201cYou are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are denying that if you can\u2019t trust my own assessment of the situation. I can do this mission. Look. Look at your objectives.\u201d She shoved the paper at him again. \u201cAnother experiment on plant growth in zero-g. I think I can handle a BRIC canister, even in my condition.\u201d\n He took the paper, did not look at it, crumpled it as he folded it. \u201cLet\u2019s face reality here.\u201d And then he paused, as if he could not do as asked.\n \u201cYes, let\u2019s,\u201d she answered. But she felt the sinking, plummeting sensation of coming disappointment. She wanted to believe in the confidence of her own voice.\n \u201cWhat would we do?\u201d he asked. Finally. And he had the good grace to meet her eyes. \u201cWhat would we do if you died up there?\u201d\n And when he said it, she realized there was nothing she wanted more. She licked her lips.\n \u201cRight.\u201d She reached out a hand for the back of the chair facing the director\u2019s desk. \u201cThat\u2019s the issue.\u201d\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down, Karen?\u201d There was the pain in the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes, the discomfort in watching her.\n \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. She was grasping for an argument, something that would make her case for her. Sitting down and admitting how tired she was even now, just watching him shuffle papers nervously on his desk, that would not be it.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve sent out automated missions,\u201d she finally said, tentatively, as if feeling her way forward in the dark. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it before. You could retrieve the shuttle.\u201d\n He sighed, leaning forward, resting his arms on the desk. \u201cKaren,\u201d the ever-so-slight pause before the admonition, \u201cyou should be taking care of yourself. You should be thinking about recovery.\u201d\n \u201cRecovery?\u201d The slight choking, the cough in the base of her throat. \u201cThis is my recovery.\u201d She jabbed her finger, once, twice for emphasis, into the cushion of the chair back. \u201cYou let me go up, that\u2019s the only help for me.\u201d And again, she realized how true it was only as she said it. The revelations were quiet and desperate.\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to force me to be the bad guy here?\u201d And now he pushed back from the desk, bracing his shoulders, setting his mouth.\n The anger was hot behind her eyes. \u201cI guess so.\u201d\n And she saw it, the spark of hate in the way he scooted back his chair, stood up, arms braced against the desk.\n \u201cNo.\u201d The pause. \u201cAnd stop asking.\u201d\n Karen brushed her teeth with deliberate care, still almost surprised, after all these years of being grounded, that she could use water freely in rinsing and spitting. There was an ache, a small sharp pain, in one of her back molars. The staff, if they found out about it, would insist on a visit to the dentist, and she had no desire to see him, nor was the health of her teeth high on her list of priorities.\n She stumbled, leaving the bathroom, barely catching herself on the foot of the nearest bed before she took a spill. She cursed, loudly, rousing the resident from his sleep.\n \u201cSorry,\u201d she waved her hand, motioning him to ignore her, to go back to sleep. \u201cSorry, I tripped.\u201d And she wondered, briefly, how space had wrecked his body and why he was here for the residents to study. He rolled his eyes, red and bloodshot, and turned over in the bed.\n She reached her own bed, hated how relieved she was to sink down onto the mattress, to take a full breath. Space, as a private capitalist venture, had pushed bodies to breaking. She knew this and she had criticized\u2014in podcasts, in televised interviews, in the last of the print papers\u2014the corporations who had funded her own missions. And yet now, feeling her skin like a body-wide bruise, she could think of nothing else but launching again. Even if the bone-crushing press of acceleration were the last thing she felt.\n The bot assigned to her unit, differentiated by the color of the stripes on the mound of its back, rolled into the room, accompanying a resident back to her bed. The blue light of its eyeball strobed towards Karen, and scanned her over. She could feel it happening, though there couldn\u2019t possibly be anything that she could feel.\n \u201cScrew you, kitty-cat,\u201d she said and lay down. She could think of no other way to kill the time before lunch.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be alright,\u201d Karen said. But, inside, in a deep corner she didn\u2019t dare acknowledge, she hated how alive Terry looked. He couldn\u2019t be more than one or two years younger than her.\n \u201cWhat the director says, goes.\u201d He had kept his hair cut to regulation length, even though he was ground-control now.\n \u201cWhat does he know?\u201d She tried to speak casually, tried to remember what it was like to joke with Terry the night before a launch. Everything was funnier though, everything brighter, with the nervous anticipatory butterflies in the stomach. \u201cHe\u2019s never been up himself.\u201d\n Terry shook his head, don\u2019t get me in trouble now as subtext.\n \u201cTerry.\u201d Maybe he would understand. She moved an inch closer. \u201cI can\u2019t die down here. Not in that place.\u201d\n He filled her glass again and pushed it across the table, creating a bit of distance between them.\n \u201cThey\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d\n She stared down at the beer, the foam spilling over. \u201cPeddling their crap now?\u201d\n He had the courtesy to look hurt and a little affronted.\n \u201cIt\u2019s fuckin\u2019 plants, Terry. The shuttle\u2019s no bigger than my grandpa\u2019s minivan.\u201d\n He held up a hand, authoritative, someone\u2019s boss now. \u201cYou and the hyperbole. I can\u2019t help you, Karen.\u201d He dipped his chin and avoided her eyes. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know that I would if I could. You\u2019re my friend. I don\u2019t want to see you suffer.\u201d\n \u201cYou look really broken up.\u201d\n He looked up, lines around his mouth, jaw taut. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve come to? After what happened?\u201d\n She could feel her body tightening, squeezing up around that hole behind her breast, trying to press into that vacuum.\n \u201cSee where that got us,\u201d she whispered.\n And they refused to talk anymore about it, about the night when they had both woken from dead sleep to what they thought were lights flashing and alarms ringing from the shuttle\u2019s console. But it had been quiet, the noise an illusion. They had felt unsettled for the next day and the day after that until the unease had settled into routine, a nervous jumpiness at the back of the brain, the base of the skull. It was both something and nothing, nothing to be reported.\n \u201cOne more, for old times\u2019 sake?\u201d Terry held up the pitcher. There was hardly enough for one left.\n \u201cThey\u2019ll scold me if I come back drunk,\u201d she said. He laughed, then smiled uncomfortably when her expression didn\u2019t shift. \u201cThe bots can tell just by looking at you.\u201d\n \u201cA little alcohol never hurt anyone.\u201d\n \u201cChemo and alcohol don\u2019t mix.\u201d\n Terry grunted and nodded his head, though it was probably the first he\u2019d heard of it. When she caught his eyes again, they were wet, sparkling in the dim light.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was that bad.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cOld school, chemo.\u201d\n \u201cI blame space,\u201d she said, letting him off the hook, leaning back into the booth. \u201cBad for the body,\u201d she joked.\n He was still tense, his arms resting too quiet on the table. \u201cWhy do you want to go back then?\u201d\n She swallowed and wished she could find her anger again. \u201cGood for the soul.\u201d It was cheesy and she wasn\u2019t sure what she actually thought about souls. But space seemed a good place to find out. Especially at the end.\n \u201cHelp a friend out.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t say no right away.\n Karen felt for the cards in the bedside table without looking, smoothing out a playing space on the bedspread at the same time. She shuffled with practiced ease and laid out the cards for solitaire. One slipped off the bed, twisting in midair. She sighed and then, suddenly angry, wiped all the cards away. They hit the floor tiles with a soft patter. A man across the room craned his head off the pillows.\n \u201cSorry.\u201d She waved her hand in apology. \u201cSorry.\u201d She shifted off the bed with effort and collected the cards. Her fingers trembled, almost impossible to see. But the bot passed by, and she was sure that it had somehow sensed her hesitation, her near-drop of the ace of spades.\n She dumped the cards in the drawer without replacing them in the box. She felt nauseous after that morning\u2019s round of chemo. The doctors had ruled out radiation and gene therapy early on for reasons that Karen could have, but had refused to, follow. The chemo made her feel ill, but at least it was something. When the doctors had told her the cancer was rare and unresearched, she was worried they might ask her to sacrifice that too, her life to science.\n She peeled back the foil lid on the jello she had taken for lunch from the cafeteria. It was bright red. She let it sit on her tongue, the flavor so bright it was almost acidic. As she swallowed, she glanced at her email. Nothing from Terry. But there was a new crossword of the day. She opened it, setting the jello aside, and swiped her finger across the screen of her phone to construct words from selected letters. The little black squares, the empty spaces between answers, danced in front of her eyes, even she when closed them. Black dots wandered across the red at the back of her eyelids.\n And so she spent the early afternoon, drifting in and out of sleep.\n Karen woke to the sound of alarms, ones that imitated the noise of klaxons and three-bell emergencies. The urgency she felt was almost out of place, as if she expected to be on the deck of a ship at open sea, the waves crashing down on the plank or rearing up tall in front.\n \u201cTerry,\u201d she said. She threw off the sheet, her feet drifting, the force of her motion propelling her towards the control panel before she had time to consciously decide on any action.\n He was not far behind her, and she saw the fear in his eyes, momentary but there. It was only when she looked at him that she realized there was no sound, that his fear seemed absurd in the silence.\n \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d She performed a mental survey of the panel as she asked. There were no abnormal readings, no blinking lights. Her hand still reached out, looking for something to fix or alter. He didn\u2019t answer. He scratched his neck below his ear.\n \u201cI thought we were in trouble,\u201d she said, finally, when the silence had stretched out too long.\n \u201cSo did I.\u201d But he did not seem convinced that the trouble had passed.\n \u201cCheck the hatch doors, I guess.\u201d She tried to steer them back into a routine. The pressure was on her, she felt, to reassert normalcy.\n \u201cI felt like I was drowning,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLike a kid at the beach, head pushed down under the waves. Unable to find my way up.\u201d\n It was the same panic she had felt, down to the memory of salt water in her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Terry.\u201d\n He shrugged, his face clearing a bit. \u201cI imagine we won\u2019t know. Not until twenty years from now and we look back and we realize what we lost tonight. What we misplaced while sleeping.\u201d\n Karen tried to write her sister a letter. It was hard to remember how to form some of the letters in cursive. She felt infantile struggling with the loop of the capital G.\n \u201cThey stole it!\u201d One of the other patients was struggling to get out of his chair, yelling at the aide. \u201cFive quarters, all there. Set oldest to newest.\u201d He pointed with a trembling finger. His jaw was slack, tongue lolling while he tried to catch his breath. The aide moved with long-suffering patience to help him walk to his bed.\n Karen shook her head clear and refocused on the letter. Her chest hurt, but the doctors told her this particular pain was likely psychosomatic. You didn\u2019t necessarily feel the cancer where it was eating at you.\n She wasn\u2019t sure what to say that wouldn\u2019t sound hollow or dull. Small talk didn\u2019t translate well to cursive. She amused herself to think that some later researcher might find her letters stuffed in a forgotten box at an archive, the letters of one of the first privately-employed astronauts. She imagined the researcher with a handheld light, hair glowing soft in that light, eyes lit up with curiosity.\n She glanced back at the paper. Her sister would probably throw it out, unaware it was Karen\u2019s only will and testament. And paper seemed antique, now that she thought of it. Perhaps an email would do just as well. She couldn\u2019t seem to find the energy right then, though. And it was important she rest. She folded the paper up once and then again, until it was a small, tight square. She slipped it into the drawer of the bedside table with the playing cards.\n She sat on the side of the bed, unlatching her watch and taking out her lenses. She curled under the weighted blanket and thought how good it felt, to be so heavy, to leave an imprint on the mattress.\n She slept until it was dark.\n The dark was disorienting, because no one in the ward had turned on any lights. Karen fumbled for her watch and glanced at the time. It was almost nine. She could hear the gentle click of the nurses\u2019 shoes in the hallway, the flicker of the night lights. Terry would be waiting.\n \u201cIt will be my ass,\u201d he said as the waiter cleared their table. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019ll think you snuck in by yourself. Or that they won\u2019t find the false weights I signed off on.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re decorated. You\u2019re a hero. What can they do to you?\u201d He snorted, because they both knew the answer to that.\n \u201cI won\u2019t compromise the mission,\u201d she followed up softly. \u201cIt was only automated anyways.\u201d\n \u201cOnly.\u201d He stood up and straightened his jacket. \u201cAnd then they deal with your corpse.\u201d And he bit his lip as if the words had hurt him coming out.\n She didn\u2019t say anything, ducked her head as she zipped up her coat.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said again. \u201cI never wanted to go back. Not afterwards.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all I can think of now,\u201d she answered. She couldn\u2019t tell him why. She couldn\u2019t tell herself.\n Outside the institution, as she waited on the sidewalk and tried to hail a cab, Karen looked up at the night. It was expansive, stars winking between the spires of buildings. She placed a hand over her chest and tried to dull the pain there.\n She had not taken any of her medicine with her. She\u2019d taken hardly anything but her old ID and a card to pay the cab.\n The air was warm on her cheek. She breathed in as deeply as she could and refused to cough. She glanced back, but no one was running after to fetch her back. It was not, after all, in theory, an involuntary facility.\n \u201cI never want to go back,\u201d she whispered to herself, and she meant it as fully as Terry had. The place was, if anything, too well known. And it scared her, more than anything else. It was a slow panic, and it did not come with klaxons and bells, but it was panic she felt, looking back at the shadows between the columns, the lights at the windows. A panic as steady as her own heartbeat.\n \u201cWhere you going?\u201d The cabdriver rolled down his window.\n She gave him the address to her old workplace.\n They threatened to abort the mission when they found out. But the amount of money already spent, the orbit achieved, the data streaming in from the ship\u2019s computations, made the threat hollow. Karen knew their priorities. She was not one of them.\n She woke up to the eternal twilight of the shuttle\u2019s dim lights. Beneath their own heliotropic lamps, small leafed plants nodded at her. They were so bright a green it hurt her to look at them.\n She swung her legs out of bed and they drifted ahead of her. It took a little bit more effort each day to catch on to something, to pull her pants on, to find and cook some of the emergency rations stowed on the shuttle.\n Karen stopped, as part of her morning routine, at the shuttle\u2019s small window. It was made of thick, layered, silicate glass, and she could sense the distance it created between her and the vast hollow of space. She put one hand on the glass and pressed as hard as she could as if she might break through. She knew that it pressed back, the darkness and the light of it, the alien life of it. It was nothing and it was everything.\n She did not cry, though the instinct was there. She was home, and there was no need to.\n Erin K.

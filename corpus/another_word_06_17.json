Sci-fi had a huge breakthrough in 1968 with Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey; at the same time, funk architects like James Brown and Sly Stone were forcing the music to progress at an exhilarating rate. As the \u201970s developed, these parallel arcs turned and merged. The result was sci-fi funk. Pairing the rhythmic and thematic innovations of funk with the conceptual evolution of science fiction, sci-fi funk expanded in the \u201970s\u2014catalyzed in part by the phenomenon of Star Wars\u2014to become, by decade\u2019s end, instantly recognizable. It also became the most visible face of Afrofuturism, which had been fostered in rock and jazz by artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Sun Ra.\nAny discussion of sci-fi funk from the \u201970s rightly begins with Parliament-Funkadelic. Led by founder George Clinton and emblemized by bassist Bootsy Collins, the collective of musicians fused science fiction, Black consciousness, and the emerging complexity of funk, beginning in earnest with Parliament\u2019s 1975 album The Mothership Connection.\nBut the discussion of sci-fi funk in the \u201970s usually ends with P-Funk as well, despite the fact that Clinton and crew were not the first, let alone only, funk artists of the decade who tapped into the concepts and aesthetic of sci-fi. In doing so, they further developed the ideas and visibility of Afrofuturism throughout popular culture.\nIn the early \u201970s, funk singles such as \u201cSpace Travel\u201d by Mugo, \u201cSpace Monster\u201d by Lunar Funk, and \u201cUFO\u201d by Mickey & Them dipped their toes in science fiction, although most came across as novelty songs. But a little-known band from New Jersey may have recorded the first fully-realized sci-fi funk song. The Continental Four\u2019s 1972 single, \u201cEscape from Planet Earth\u201d features a long, spoken-word intro complete with rocket-launch sound effects and a scenario where the crew of a spaceship must leave Earth to establish a new civilization on a distant planet. Parliament-Funkadelic were dabbling in cosmic themes by 1972, but they were still more in line with the vague mysticism of the post-psychedelic era. The Continental Four not only envisioned a utopian Black future among the stars, they did so through a compelling, cohesive sci-fi narrative.\nWhile The Continental Four sang about space colonies, a dance craze called The Robot flourished here on Earth, as evidenced by a handful of songs including \u201cDo the Robot\u201d by The Family, \u201cFunky Robot\u201d by Dave \u201cBaby\u201d Cortez, and \u201cFunky Robot\u201d (a different song) by the king of R&B dance crazes, Rufus Thomas. In a 1973 episode of the TV show Black Omnibus, Thomas even demonstrated the Funky Robot to an amused James Earl Jones\u2014who had no idea that he\u2019d soon become one of sci-fi\u2019s greatest icons as the voice of Darth Vader. The Robot hit its peak the same year, when The Jackson 5 performed their latest single, \u201cDancing Machine,\u201d for a national audience on Soul Train. During this appearance, Michael Jackson offered a stunning display of the android-mimicking dance, which meshed with the song\u2019s sci-fi vision of an \u201cautomatic, systematic\u201d dance partner \u201cfilled with space-age design.\u201d\nLabelle shot to fame in 1974 with the success of \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d but it\u2019s the B-side of that single that expressed the group\u2019s sci-fi passion. \u201cSpace Children\u201d is a plea for global togetherness draped in elegant funk\u2014an inclusive view of the human race from a celestial perspective. One of the trio, Nona Hendryx, shared her love of science fiction with her cousin Jimi, and it seeped into Labelle\u2019s increasingly cosmic lyrical content. Labelle also tapped into the emerging glam-rock movement led by sci-fi rocker David Bowie; they dressed themselves in ornate, glittery outfits that reimagined astronauts\u2019 spacesuits. The costumes were created by designer Larry LaGaspi, who also made similar stage attire for Kiss and Parliament\u2014the latter of whom were about to make a quantum leap to the top of the sci-fi funk field.\nParliament\u2019s The Mothership Connection, released in 1975, was the flashpoint of sci-fi funk, pulling together a disconnected trend into a consummate whole. In a parallel universe, though, Parliament\u2019s contemporaries The Undisputed Truth became that band. Assembled in 1970 by Motown producer Norman Whitfield, The Undisputed Truth plunged into science fiction with their 1975 album Cosmic Truth and its lead single, \u201cUFOs.\u201d Using Whitfield\u2019s groundbreaking psychedelic-soul sound, \u201cUFOs\u201d wrapped sci-fi funk in a tuneful package, complete with futuristic costumes similar to Parliament\u2019s and Labelle\u2019s. Despite three strong albums in this vein throughout the decade, The Undisputed Truth never caught on, having failed to develop the mythology and forward-looking innovation that put P-Funk at the forefront. Still, The Undisputed Truth\u2019s alien-centric music remains a vital chain of sci-fi funk\u2019s DNA.\nFunk began to overlap with jazz fusion in the late \u201960s\u2014and as the \u201970s progressed, so did sci-fi funk. Jazz keyboardists like Herbie Hancock and Charles Earland used funky grooves to ground the science-fiction cosmology first propagated by Sun Ra. Dexter Wansel was another such keyboardist, although his 1976 album Life on Mars\u2014no relation to the David Bowie song of the same name\u2014crafted a more immersive interplanetary ambience than Hancock or Earland. Using cutting-edge technology and studio techniques, he and his band, which he dubbed The Planets, created a soundscape that conjured both celestial harmony and the rhythms of some futuristic machinery. Wansel later doubled down on his infatuation with space exploration and become a science fiction novelist\u2014one of the few sci-fi musicians of that era to do so, including Mick Farren of The Deviants and Julian Jay Savarin of Julian\u2019s Treatment.\nSinger Maxayn Lewis and her husband, keyboardist Andre Lewis, were the core of the band Maxayn, who released the space-themed single \u201cMoonfunk\u201d in 1974. After the group broke up, Andre went solo, assuming the guise of a robotic figure named Mandr\u00e9. Wearing a metal helmet and brandishing a control panel\u2019s worth of synthesizers, he issued three albums in the late \u201970s that brought a new level of ambition to sci-fi funk. Symphonic in scope, songs such as \u201cSolar Flight (Opus I)\u201d grafted a funk sensibility onto the weightless, spacious sounds popularized by his classical-leaning contemporaries Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre. Other funk artists had a similar approach in 1977\u2014most notably Manzel, the band behind the much-sampled single \u201cSpace Funk\u201d\u2014but Mandr\u00e9\u2019s virtuosity and mystique signaled a profound shift in sci-fi funk, one that would influence everything from electro to trance to Daft Punk, whose helmets bear an unmistakable resemblance to Mandr\u00e9\u2019s.\nAlong with synthesizers, voice modulation became a technological hallmark of sci-fi funk in the \u201970s. As early as 1972\u2014when \u201cDo the Robot\u201d by The Family featured deadpan baritone vocals meant to simulate the rumbling of a mechanical man\u2014funk artists sought ways to render human speech less human. To this end, the device of choice during most of the decade was the talk box, which formed an interface between the human voice and musical instruments such as guitars. \u201cStellar Fungk\u201d by Slave, released in 1978, is one of the most compelling uses of the talk box in sci-fi funk, depicting a dance across the galaxy urged on by android commands and laser noises. The song appeared the same year Battlestar Galactica hit TV screens and made popular villains of its sinister, cybernetic Cylons. The show used the more expensive vocoder to transform its actors\u2019 voices, a device that wound up becoming ubiquitous in popular music in the \u201980s and beyond. But talk-box funk like \u201cStellar Fungk\u201d paved the way for the common use of robotic vocals as a way to simultaneously mock and celebrate humanity\u2019s growing intersection with technology.\nThe release of Star Wars in 1977 transformed pop culture\u2014sci-fi funk included. Meco\u2019s platinum-selling disco version of the movie\u2019s theme catapulted sci-fi funk into millions of homes across America. Instantly, sci-fi funk was mainstream. Dozens of artists leapt to capitalize on Star Wars, with numerous Meco knockoffs competing against a slew of songs that drew inspiration from the film rather than directly adapting John Williams\u2019 score. Funk and disco acts such as The Droids, Boney M., Dee D. Jackson, and Sarah Brightman & Hot Gossip\u2014many of them European and more sympathetic to Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder than P-Funk\u2014got in on the Star Wars-inspired music boom. One of the most intriguing examples is \u201cThe Force\u201d by the American vocal trio Stargard. Released in 1978, the song unabashedly borrows the central philosophical concept of Star Wars, right down to the film\u2019s mantra \u201cMay the Force be with you.\u201d At the same time, the lyrics carry a deeper resonance, equating the Force with spiritualism, inner strength, and empowerment.\nThanks to Star Wars, science fiction had fully infiltrated the mainstream by 1978. Suddenly, singing about space wasn\u2019t only for novelty songs or cult artists. This sparked many funk superstars who had previously toyed with sci-fi imagery, like Earth, Wind & Fire, to delve more deeply into space travel on their 1978 single \u201cJupiter.\u201d It also left a mark on huge artists not known for sci-fi themes, such as Stevie Wonder, who released the planet-gazing \u201cSaturn\u201d the same year. But the most ambitious song by a major funk star in the wake of Star Wars was Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cA Funky Space Reincarnation.\u201d Over eight minutes long, it takes place in 2093 and details conquests both romantic and astronomical, referencing Star Wars by name in the process. It also dips into Afrofuturism, imagining a hopeful tomorrow where \u201cMusic won\u2019t have no race / Only space.\u201d Leave it to Marvin Gaye to pair sensuality with science fiction, in essence turning all of outer space into a single, infinite erogenous zone.\nOn first listen, \u201cDark Vader\u201d by Instant Funk is just another Star Wars cash-in. But scratch the surface, and it\u2019s fanfiction in song form. Unlike the many shallow appropriations of Star Wars set to music in the late \u201970s, the song recasts Darth Vader\u2014played in the film by the white actor David Prowse yet voiced by James Earl Jones in his stentorian bass\u2014as Dark Vader, an explicitly Black character. In doing so, the song reclaims Darth Vader, casting him as a kind of interstellar Blaxploitation antihero\u2014or as the lyrics describe, \u201ca tall black man, entirely fearless.\u201d It\u2019s less a tribute to Star Wars and more a retelling of the story from a point of view that\u2019s sympathetic to the villain. \u201cDark Vader\u201d is to Darth Vader as the musical Wicked is to the Wicked Witch of the West.\nGeorge Duke, \u201cThe Alien Succumbs to the Macho Intergalactic Funkativity of the Funk Blasters\u201d (1979)\nThe proliferation of sci-fi funk at the end of the \u201970s left the genre ripe for self-parody. In 1979, as Parliament released its final sci-fi concept album Gloryhallastoopid, the band\u2019s rich cosmic mythology and tongue-twisting technobabble had become widespread\u2014to the point where fusion keyboardist George Duke recorded a loving spoof titled \u201cThe Alien Succumbs to the Macho Intergalactic Funkativity of the Funk Blasters.\u201d It\u2019s a title that could have come from any number of Parliament or Funkadelic records in the \u201970s, and sonically, Duke was just as playfully faithful. \u201cUnderwater intergalactic jam / With folks from another space and time / Alien romancing,\u201d he sings while coaxing disco-on-Neptune sounds from his synthesizers. \u201cThe Alien Succumbs\u201d is the best P-Funk song that P-Funk never made\u2014a testament to how thoroughly George Clinton\u2019s futuristic vision, and sci-fi funk as a whole, had trickled down over the course of the decade. At the end of the \u201970s, sci-fi funk was still evolving, and Parliament-Funkadelic remained the primary source. But as important as P-Funk will always be, they were not the end-all-be-all of sci-fi funk in the \u201970s. They were simply the most visible peak of a deeper continuum\u2014one that translated the hopes and fears of science fiction into a language of musical innovation, liberation, theatricality, and dance.\nJason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

Most aren\u2019t! It just felt right but, you know, I wish that could happen with every book, but the truth is it\u2019s so rare, you just have to be thankful when it happens.\u201d\n He\u2019s talking about Osama, the winner of the 2012 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel\u2014a novel featuring a pulp writer, a detective, a vigilante named Osama Bin Laden, and a view of the world that seems at once brilliant and dark, dulled by a wise man\u2019s weariness and sharpened by a young man\u2019s exposure to a very real, very immediate truth.\n Tidhar, who was born in Israel, has spent most of his adult life travelling, each trip seeming to add a layering to his writing, while deepening his sense of rootedness in the past. Story after story and novel after novel\u2014from The Bookman Histories to Martian Sands to The Violent Century (due out this month) there is always that forward thrust, that delving deeper into a darker space that is also, somehow, more revealing, more full of light.\n I went into our interview expecting the globe-trotting man of letters to be simply bubbling with enthusiasm for his craft. He is not, mind you, a grump or premature curmudgeon, but his relationship sitting at the keyboard is a bit more conflicted than I expected.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know if enjoy is the right word,\u201d said Tidhar. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t do it for a length of time I know get very irritable, restless, physically itching to write. So perhaps \u2018obsession\u2019 would be a better description.\u201d\n Fortunately for the world, Tidhar\u2019s obsessions\u2014whether writing, collecting Hebrew pulp fiction, writing screenplays, or what have you\u2014tend to be entertaining, evocative, and enlightening.\n How about James Ellroy\u2019s blurb for The Violent Century: \u201cA brilliantly etched phantasmagoric reconfiguring of that most sizzling of eras\u2014the twilight 20th.\u201d What do you think of it? Is he spot on? Off?\n To be honest, I\u2019m just so chuffed to have a James Ellroy blurb! I finally got to read his books when I was living in Laos, in 2008\u2014a short time after writing Osama, I think\u2014and I admire more than anything just how deep he is willing to go inside, the courage of putting everything on the page, no matter how sordid or terrible it is.\n It\u2019s a courage I don\u2019t quite have yet, though I hope I am getting closer\u2014the novel I\u2019ve been working on the past year is the one where I\u2019ve really tried to go deep into the dark, if that makes sense (and it was a strange and uncomfortable experience! It can really mess you up, that sort of thing).\n Can you expand on \u201cdeep into the dark\u201d and how it relates to the novel you're currently working on?\n I think in a way it\u2019s my most personal novel, in that it goes deepest into my obsessions, particularly with the Holocaust, but with pulp fiction, with pornographic fiction (which I\u2019ve been fascinated by as a mode of storytelling). I wrote it very quickly, mostly at night, because it was such an unpleasant space to inhabit, but at the same time, like with Osama, it felt very true to be doing it. I think it\u2019s very dark, but also very funny, if that makes sense. We\u2019ll see what happens!\n Can you talk a little bit where you started with The Violent Century? How you developed it? What some of the surprises were along the way?\n I keep referring to The Violent Century as my \u201caccidental book\u201d. I never meant to write it!\n It started with an e-mail exchange with a friend of mine who\u2019s a film producer in the UK. She mentioned in passing they had been looking to make a British superhero film, but never found the right script. So I fired off an e-mail banging on about how well of course you can\u2019t do that because you have to understand superheroes in terms of the Jewish experience during the lead up to World War 2 (virtually all the creators of superheroes were first generation Jews born in the United States to immigrant parents). And once I wrote that, I kind of thought, well, actually, that\u2019s not such a bad idea! So I sat down that same day and wrote, I think, five or eight pages of script, and then forgot about it.\n At the time I was moving back to the UK, and I got stuck for a couple of months visiting my parents, sorting out paperwork, so to keep myself occupied I worked on the screenplay of what was going to become The Violent Century. And I was quite happy with it! It was fun (I write screenplays occasionally for fun, as weird as that sounds!)\n I showed it to my friend, and she liked it\u2014but she also pointed out that, as a movie, we were looking at something that could only really be done by a big Hollywood studio. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn it into a novel?\u201d she said. And again, this little light bulb went off in my head and I thought, well, why not turn it into a novel!\n So it was all very accidental\u2014and also a very different experience, an experience in adaptation, really, which is something I am fascinated with. It was hard work . . . It went through an enormous amount of drafts and, of course, the book is a very different creature to the screenplay. I was also working on a comics adaptation of it, to the extent that we had the first issue written, and a few pages of art\u2014I hoped we could sell the comics first and then the novel but, as it turned out, the book sold very, very quickly after submission, and my artist (Paul McCaffrey) and I went on to do a comic called Adler instead (Titan Comics is releasing it next year).\n What\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d about working on a screenplay. Or, put differently, how is it different for you to create stories in that form as opposed to narrative prose?\n Maybe it\u2019s stripping the story down so much. I\u2019m quite minimalist, which is good. I don\u2019t need to provide elaborate descriptions or instructions, I can just go straight in with character and dialogue and a maybe little bit of stage-setting. It\u2019s different! And a ninety page screenplay is much quicker to write than a novel, it\u2019s like taking a break. And of course writing screenplays has worked out quite well for me\u2014one eventually became The Violent Century, one became Adler (my forthcoming comics mini-series) and I\u2019m actually writing one now for some producers, so I have a genuine writing \u201cgig\u201d. We\u2019ll see what happens with it!\n What\u2019s at the heart of the book for you?\n To me, and I think like Osama, The Violent Century is a love story. That\u2019s the core of it.\n There\u2019s a murder mystery of sort in there, and the big historical stuff I love to do, and it does I hope say something about our conception of heroism, and it\u2019s about World War 2, and to a much smaller extent the Holocaust (which, again, I think you can only understand superheroes if you understand the world that created them). But at the heart of it, it\u2019s a love story. What else is there to write about, if not love?\n Ironically, some early reviews seem to suggest I was \u201cobviously\u201d inspired by all different kinds of comic books. The truth is I never read much comics\u2014it wasn\u2019t something we really had when I was growing up. I have been trying to educate myself more in reading them, and I love hanging out with comics creators, who are some of the nicest people you\u2019d ever meet\u2014but I was trying to come at the theme as if it were being created from scratch, in the 1930s, by these geeky Jewish kids (which I suppose is what I am!)\n You know, they all had to change their names\u2014Stanley Lieber became Stan Lee, Jacob Kurzberg became Jack Kirby, Robert Kahn became Bob Kane. I was fascinated by that erasure. And Lee and Jerry Siegel both appear as minor characters in The Violent Century!\n I wonder what your geeky Jewish kid turned early 20th Century American comic book writer would\u2019ve been. And how would changing your name to fit a market effect your writing? Would it be freeing? Limiting? Like wearing a mask? Like being forced to hide?\n I was thinking about this recently, actually\u2014I\u2019d have gone for an Anglophone sounding equivalent\u2014Larry Tiddler or something equally ridiculous, which sort of sounds the way English people usually tend to pronounce my name anyway!\n My writerly alter-ego, who sometimes appears in the fiction, is Lior Tirosh. I also quite like the pen name \u201cSebastian Bruce\u201d (who is briefly mentioned in Osama, and who I have written a short biography of\u2014where he said \u201cnever trust a man with two first names.\u201d).\n The habit of using Anglophone names was quite common in Hebrew pulp fiction, where it was by \u201cMike Longshott\u201d or \u201cKim Rockman\u201d\u2014great names! And then the actual writer\u2019s name was usually given as \u201cTranslated by\u201d. So I love the idea of alter egos and fictitious identities, but I think I\u2019m far enough in to just stick with \u2018Lavie Tidhar\u2019 and hope for the best.\n Hebrew pulp fiction! Can you talk a little more about Hebrew pulp novels influenced your writing?\n They\u2019re wonderful\u2014wonderfully bad, and with the most amazingly lurid covers imaginable. They were pocket books, cheap paperbacks from the 1950s and 1960s\u2014so many of them essentially produced by this one publisher, under different names. It\u2019s said some of the best Israeli writers got their breaks writing pulps to begin with (under a host of pseudonyms).\n I\u2019ve been fascinated with them for a long time, especially the infamous Stalag novels, or Nazisploitation material that was incredibly popular (in an under the counter sort of way) in the 1960s, and which is incredibly rare (and collectible) now. They\u2019re violent, pornographic (though very tame by today\u2019s standard) and I think were able to say something, in pulp, that mainstream fiction wasn\u2019t able to deal with.\n I collect Hebrew pulp, to an extent\u2014I was lucky recently that I lived in Jaffa right next door to its grand flea market, and I was able to walk through the market and pick up these incredibly rare books for next to nothing\u2014romance chapbooks from the 1940s, early pornography, spy series (the improbable Patrick Kim: Karate Man, about a two meter tall Korean secret agent, which ran for years and an enormous amount of titles)\u2014the marginal literature that people read but that is seldom recorded, seldom acknowledged.\n The one I\u2019m particularly obsessed with is the (real life) figure of David Tidhar, known as \u201cthe first Hebrew Detective\u201d. He was a larger-than-life character who became the hero of a series of chapbooks written about him. I have two of them\u2014they date back to the 1930s. I also have a signed copy of his autobiography, which is utterly bizarre\u2014in four pages early on he seems to single-handedly\u2014and in cold blood!\u2014kill about forty people! He\u2019s appeared in a couple of my works\u2014particularly \u201cThe Projected Girl\u201d, a novelette Ellen Datlow published a couple of years back in an anthology called Naked City. And he\u2019s forthcoming again in a story I did for an anthology called Tel Aviv Noir. But I\u2019m not done with him yet . . .\n Back to The Violent Century: how did that novel challenge you in ways that your other books haven\u2019t?\n It was a nightmare to write! You know, Osama was probably the easiest thing I ever wrote, strangely enough. And the book I\u2019ve been working on this year, I wrote it incredibly quickly (mostly because it was so dark\u2014I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of spending too long in that mental space).\n The Violent Century was the opposite. It was hard, it was slow, it went through rewrite after rewrite\u2014but each time it was getting closer to what it should have been. I made a stylistic choice early on in the way it is told, and the response to that wasn\u2019t good, and I stopped working for three months because I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014and then I decided I knew best after all, and kept going. You have to trust your instincts (though it can be scary!).\n And it was written very much in the middle of a lot of transition, both in my circumstances and in my career\u2014I started work on it when I thought my career was essentially over before it\u2019s began, and finished it literally a week before winning the World Fantasy Award for Osama. So it\u2019s been a real rollercoaster in many ways!\n You\u2019ve lived and traveled all around the world. How do you suppose that has affected your writing and sense of place?\n I\u2019ve said it before, that sense of place is incredibly important to me\u2014not necessarily in overblown descriptions of places but for my own feel for a place in order for me to write about it. But at the same time, though I have set stories widely across the world, and I\u2019ve lived in many of those places, I am increasingly uncomfortable with doing that\u2014I am feeling more and more that I need to concentrate on my personal background, heritage, geography. I\u2019m conflicted, in a way.\n Vanuatu was a big influence on my science fiction short stories, for instance in the use of Bislama (the pidgin/creole English used in Vanuatu) which has fed into my fiction a lot. Laos strongly influenced Gorel & The Pot-Bellied God (and Osama starts and ends there). I\u2019ve been lucky\u2014I\u2019ve climbed volcanoes and sailed canoes and I\u2019ve lived in some of the most remote and beautiful places on Earth. I\u2019ve hitchhiked across Eastern Europe and Southeast Africa. I travelled on the trans-Siberian railway and stood on a frozen river of ice in the Gobi desert. But so what? That doesn\u2019t make you a good writer, necessarily (though it can make you a boring dinner companion!).\n So I\u2019m trying to go deeper inside myself, instead. And to write honestly and authentically from my own identity.\n Which is not to say I\u2019m at all averse to writing the occasional very silly mash-up!\n You started off as a poet, with a Hebrew collection, and poetry continues to appear in your work\u2014both English poetry and I think also Bislama poetry? What is the importance of poetry to you?\n I\u2019ve said this before, that I wish I was a great poet, but I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m decent, maybe even good, but I won\u2019t be great, the way Larkin or Plath were, say. Or Amichai or Celan\u2014take your pick. I did publish, a little, here and there, but if I do write (which is very infrequently, sadly\u2014and I think you never know if you\u2019ll ever write another poem, which is what happened to Larkin, he knew it was over, and that was three years I think before he died\u2014it was all gone), well, these days I just work them into the novels or a story, so at least they\u2019re there, if only for myself!\n Back when we started, you mentioned the novel you\u2019re working on now. Can you talk a little bit about it?\n I don\u2019t want to say much at this stage, obviously\u2014it\u2019s on the face of it a Hardboiled detective novel, which is actually quite hard to do, a proper Hardboiled (Osama is noir, but it\u2019s very far from Hardboiled!)\u2014but of course it\u2019s not really a detective novel at all. It\u2019s sort of alternate history, but again, like Osama, it\u2019s not really an alternate history either. It\u2019s . . . going to be interesting to see what happens with it. I\u2019m just going over it now before sending it to my editor. And it\u2019s about the Holocaust again\u2014I think this will have to be my last work set in, or about, World War 2 for a while (after Martian Sands and The Violent Century). I just can\u2019t sustain it any more. It\u2019s draining, but something I also can\u2019t escape. My mother was born in a refugee camp in Germany, her parents survived Auschwitz. Most of my family died there. A handful lived through the camp. It\u2019s something that I need to talk about almost obsessively, but finding the right way, the right form of art in which to do it, that\u2019s difficult, and I think I come at it from a weird angle.\n But this will be my final statement on a lot of that stuff\u2014Nazism and sexuality and pulp fiction and Hitler and Zionism and and metafictional worlds and what have you! And there are a couple of novellas still that I\u2019m toying with about all that. But I\u2019d like to write something very different after that. And a part of me just wants to do an honest-to-God big old science fiction novel. And a part of me\u2014in all seriousness\u2014wants to do a Star Wars novel. Just because I\u2019d be fascinated to take that big property and try and treat it really seriously\u2014do a literary novel set in that world!\n Jeremy L. C.

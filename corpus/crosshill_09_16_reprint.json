Yet sometimes I blinded myself to the shining wonder we darkitects had created\u2014the dazzling skins, the well-lit spaces projected directly onto my cornea by my own Apollo, my god of light and wonder, my seventy euros\u2019 worth of silicon and plastic and gold. Like a prophetess turned apostate I cast aside my night vision and ventured unseeing into the shadowed streets.\n It was slow going even on moonlit nights. Carefully I ambled along familiar sidewalks, listening for footsteps, a car, the bark of a dog. On more than one occasion I twisted my ankle in a pothole which my sensors would have detected and my lenses would have lit up bright. Yet for this paltry price I saw my city as it had never been seen in the nine centuries of its history.\n Unlit.\n The great black hulk of the Dom cathedral\u2014where I\u2019d worshipped for twenty years\u2014an unfamiliar giant standing guard over a ragged skyline I barely recognized.\n The Vilnius express on the rail bridge\u2014which I\u2019d ridden to university every day\u2014a serpent slithering across a Daugava silvery in moonlight.\n Kipsala\u2019s skyscrapers\u2014a mausoleum of office space where I too had once toiled\u2014a dark forest of accusatory fingers pointed at the sky.\n At times I felt unwelcome in this shadowed city. Yet then I came to the gray concrete boxes of a hundred new schools, churches, malls and theaters. Riga\u2019s darkitects had clad them in wondrous illusions. I\u2019d skinned many myself, some in spires and towers and lions and sphinxes, others in steel and glass.\n I saw none of that. Only vague dark forms which held the promise of a blank canvas.\n The pedestrians I passed were a parade of shadows, except for their eyes. Firefly eyes\u2014bright-glowing lenses bobbing in the night, flickering with every eyeblink.\n When I beheld their glow, I knew that there existed in the darkness\u2014waiting for me\u2014unseen spaces luminous with beauty.\n I could tell from how long Marta took that the news wasn\u2019t good.\n She poured sugar into her coffee and stirred it well. She withdrew the spoon and clinked it repeatedly on the edge of her baked clay mug. Took a sip. Put the mug down. Her wrinkled fingers danced on the edge of her glass desk as if looking for papers to shuffle. A childhood friend of my mother\u2019s, Dr. Marta Kalniete was seventy, old enough to have formed habits when paper records were still a thing.\n When she spoke, the words came in a rush. \u201cSandra, I\u2019m sorry\u2014it is Morganfeld\u2019s. But not to worry, there\u2019s time to operate, to get out the implants. You won\u2019t lose your vision. Your eyes will be sensitive, too sensitive for lenses, I\u2019m afraid. But you\u2019ll still be able to see.\u201d\n So. A few headaches, a doctor visit, and there it was. Implants and lenses gone.\n No more thought-controlled interfaces. No more augmented vision. Back to the twentieth century with me.\n Through the window behind Marta, I watched Strelnieku Street in the bustle of a spring morning. I\u2019d applied the Alexander Caks skin, my magnum opus\u2014a vision of Riga in the 1920s, when the eponymous poet had wandered these streets. Art Nouveau facades painted in subdued blues and yellows. The hip cafe across the road transformed into a Parisian bistro with white tablecloths and upholstered chairs. Cars rattled past as horse-drawn cabs\u2014although the illusion strained when traffic moved fast.\n I recalled the redshot obsession of my months working on the skin\u2014long days at the archives, long evenings crafting textures and models, long nights tossing and turning and dreaming of a Riga that was.\n Funny, to think I\u2019d once dreamt of living in the past.\n \u201cThe assisted-vision tablets are fantastic these days,\u201d Marta said, not managing to meet my eyes. \u201cYou can get online, work, see those marvelous skins of yours.\u201d\n I wondered when Marta had last looked out her window without the benefit of darkitecture. Did she know how the paint peeled on those few remaining Art Noveau facades? Did she know how many were now gray boxes instead? When had she last seen a world without color?\n \u201cYou\u2019ll never run out of clients,\u201d Marta said. \u201cI mean, with your reputation . . . \u201d\n Outside, people passed by on their morning errands. They wore their broadcast skins\u2014business suits, jeans and a tee, a rococo wedding cake dress. I didn\u2019t like to overrule their broadcasts, not even for stylistic consistency. Robbing people of self-expression, seeing them only as you wished to see them . . . you might as well live alone in your own head.\n \u201cWho do you think designs for tablets these days?\u201d I asked. \u201cSome willing-but-under-resourced programmer at the cheapest contractor, hired as an afterthought to comply with accessibility legislation?\u201d\n \u201cI know it\u2019s hard.\u201d Marta\u2019s voice was gentle. \u201cWe\u2019ll support you. Everything will be fine.\u201d\n Viss b\u016bs labi. That perennial Latvian refrain. Everything will be fine, even if little in centuries of blood-stained history substantiated that belief.\n \u201cWe should operate soon,\u201d Marta said, as if we were both going to hold the scalpel. \u201cSometime in the next week, ideally.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want that.\u201d\n Marta couldn\u2019t hide her wince. \u201cIf you leave the implants in, there\u2019s a seventy percent chance you\u2019ll be blind within six months.\u201d\n \u201cAnd a thirty percent chance I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n \u201cWould you bet everything on a thirty percent chance?\u201d\n What was this \u2018everything\u2019 that I would be betting? A life where backup streetlights flared everywhere I went, lighting up for an audience of one? The lenses of passers-by would flare momentarily before their sensors could adjust. An announcement to everyone that I\u2014Sandra Ivanova, famous darkitect\u2014no longer inhabited my own creations.\n Or would I shamble around in the shadows, too proud to reveal my exile? Alone in the dark amidst a multitude bathed in lights fantastic?\n I rose and smoothed the folds of my dress. \u201cThank you, Marta. I will consider your advice.\u201d\n \u201cIf we put out a skin that\u2019s transparently commercial,\u201d I said, \u201cif the most interesting, colorful thing on the street is your restaurant, no one\u2019s going to download it. It won\u2019t rank in the top hundred, let alone the top ten. I suggest we do something more subtle, direct the customer\u2019s eye\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s a very good point,\u201d said the client guy. \u201cThat said, I\u2019d still prefer to go with my color scheme.\u201d\n He was a thirty-something manager of a fast food chain who wore an unskinned pin-striped suit and had insisted on meeting in person. I\u2019d rented a room at one of the shared workspaces on Raina Boulevard as I did when forced to.\n I had a headache right behind my eyes, probably the Morgenfeld\u2019s. Or maybe it was just that the walls seemed suffocating about me, even skinned in pastel tones and pastoral landscapes. As if I could sense the indifferent gray lurking below the surface.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should strive to create beauty in the world?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo the extent that we can, shouldn\u2019t we avoid creating garbage?\u201d\n The client guy stared at me.\n \u201cPeople use skins to escape ugliness,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy would they choose to have it shoved in their faces?\u201d\n Having lost the client, I had the evening free so I went on a date. Logged onto ReLeNet, queried for a minimum 80% match, specified the Melnsila Cafe as the meeting place.\n Within an hour I had an offer; within two I sipped peppermint tea at a cast-iron table that had once served as the base of a sewing machine. The cafe was a retro, no-default-skin establishment\u2014exposed brick walls, scuffed wooden floors, nonfunctional iron radiators, all of it real. Customers too were requested to keep outlandish skins to a minimum.\n Once I would have scoffed. Now I wondered if soon I\u2019d be scouring the city for holdouts like this.\n My date, Daniel, had chosen not to broadcast a skin. Fifty, good-looking in a balding professor kind of way, he wore a tweed suit and a checkered dress shirt. I knew immediately that it wouldn\u2019t work out. Maybe it was the look or the uncertain way he smiled, or his citrus fruit cologne\u2014it was an intuitive feeling, one that all of ReLeNet\u2019s questionnaires and statistics couldn\u2019t compensate for.\n \u201cSo, umm, when I joined the Salaspils Fusor project, I thought I was helping save the planet,\u201d Daniel told me. \u201cFree energy for everybody. Twenty years later we\u2019re online, and guess what, free energy isn\u2019t so great when you\u2019ve got a depreciating thirty billion euro power plant to pay down. Uhh, so, you darkitects did more for the planet than we physicists ever have.\u201d\n \u201cBetter fusion than coal.\u201d I was determined to be pleasant to at least somebody this day. \u201cWe still need energy, even if we don\u2019t light up our cities at night.\u201d\n \u201cMakes me wish I\u2019d stayed in theory,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cThe things they\u2019re doing with amplituhedrons these days . . . you know about amplituhedrons?\u201d\n Sometimes I wished I could skin people\u2014their characters, their brains, their voices.\n Their conversational skills.\n \u201cAmplituhedrons, they\u2019re, like, these crystals of reality . . . \u201d Daniel said. \u201cIt turns out nature, quantum mechanics, particle interactions, the whole messy bag, it\u2019s geometrical. Everything that happens, all of reality, it\u2019s controlled by these many-dimensional geometrical structures. If you could see them . . . if you could really visualize them, see the geometry of all possible universes . . . you would be like God. We move through life without ever glimpsing the complex structures that govern the world. All these infinities unseen to the eye.\u201d\n For the first time this evening, I sat forward. \u201cDoes it keep you up at night? Knowing there\u2019s all this structure around you that you can\u2019t see?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Daniel gave me a shy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s what helps me get up in the morning.\u201d\n In the end I helped Daniel get up the next morning, when I had to leave for a meeting in Riga\u2019s Jurmala district. Last night\u2019s conversation had spurred me to investigate if he too contained infinities unseen to the eye. I hadn\u2019t discovered any.\n \u201cWill we see each other again?\u201d he asked as I packed him out the door. Around his balding pate, spare wisps of gray hair poked up in disarray\u2014but then that wasn\u2019t fair; he\u2019d forgotten to enable digital makeup after our no-skin date.\n \u201cTurn on the Fairyland Skin as you walk across the Akmens Bridge,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll see my true self in stone and glass and steel.\u201d\n For the first time across the many years I\u2019d used the line, I wasn\u2019t sure I believed it.\n The Jurmala train was its usual disconcerting experience. My daily skin clad trains as Orient Express engines\u2014black iron, puffs of steam, choo-choo sound effects. It was strange to sit among wood-paneled opulence as we rode along in maglev smoothness. The cookie-cutter sprawl of Riga\u2019s suburbs flew past outside.\n I met Dad on the beach. We strolled just beyond the reach of the surf while gusts of cool wind tugged at our light jackets. The salty tang of the sea sent me back to a dozen such walks, a hundred, in the years of my childhood.\n Jurmala had been a city in its own right back then. I\u2019d had no idea I would come to call Riga my home, my canvas, my muse.\n Out over the water along the horizon, the countless blades of the Baltic Windfarm spun in lazy harmony.\n I could tell by the tightness of Dad\u2019s bony shoulders that he was struggling with words. I feared what they might be.\n I thought of his small flat in our Soviet-era apartment building on Vike-Freiberga Street\u2014insulated walls, solar cell windows, smart-sort garbage chute. For long decades Dad had been an economizer with Riga city hall, paid a commission on energy savings he found for the municipality. How thrilled he had been, to have in his daughter a leader of the unlit revolution . . .\n \u201cI\u2019ll still be able to work,\u201d I said at last. My voice sounded a fifty year old child\u2019s, thin and plaintive. \u201cMarta says-\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking lately,\u201d Dad cut in as if I hadn\u2019t spoken. That habit had always infuriated me, but this once it was a relief. \u201cI spent all my life saving energy. A joule here. A kilowatt-hour there. It seemed to me energy was the only real currency in this universe.\u201d He looked at me, his small dark eyes like black stones in a wrinkled fabric. \u201cToo late, I discovered there were others.\u201d\n In her last year of life, when I was twenty, Mom shared a secret with me. She led me into the bathroom and latched the door even though Dad wasn\u2019t at home. Then she pulled an incandescent light bulb from a locked drawer under the sink and plugged it in. We turned off our lenses and spent a good five minutes basking in its glow\u2014warm and golden and decadent.\n \u201cWasn\u2019t it all worth it?\u201d I asked Dad now. \u201cWe saved this planet, one joule at a time.\u201d\n Wasn\u2019t it all worth it? The dark cities? The peeling paint? The architecture of gray boxes?\n The wind gusted, sudden and harsh. Up ahead a little boy had kicked his ball into the air. The gust carried it far into the cold water. He stood by the surf and cried as the ball bobbed up and down on the waves. His tears did nothing to bring it back.\n \u201cI wanted to meet here for a reason,\u201d Dad said.\n A package popped up on my viewport. A skin. I loaded it.\n At first, I couldn\u2019t see anything different. Then color caught my eye, near the horizon. The Baltic Windfarm. Instead of the tall, ungainly metal windmills, a forest of golden-brown gingerbread sticks poked out of the water. The windmill blades had become red-and-white candy cones turning languidly in the breeze.\n My voice came out hushed. \u201cYou remember.\u201d\n Dad smiled. \u201cI\u2019d never felt so proud in my life.\u201d\n I\u2019d won a high school design contest with that skin. It had been in the days of the great NIMBY debates\u2014sure, we need to save the planet, but not in my back yard. Jurmala\u2019s citizens had resented the eyesore of the Windmill, yet even I had been surprised at how many adopted my skin for daily use. This had been long before everyone and their grandma skinned their world as a matter of course.\n \u201cI can\u2019t . . . all this . . . \u201d I gestured helplessly. \u201cIf I let Marta do the operation, I might never create again.\u201d\n \u201cYou have touched the world, Sandra,\u201d Dad said. \u201cWhatever you decide to do, you won\u2019t lose that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is lighter than a darkitect\u2019s touch?\u201d I mused. \u201cNow glimpsed by a willing eye, now gone without a trace . . . \u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t mean-\u201d Dad began.\n This time it was I who cut in. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s all right, Dad. The world would be a better place if we didn\u2019t feel the need to leave marks of our passage on its face.\u201d\n That evening, I walked the streets of my city.\n With Ray Charles as my soundtrack, I let my feet carry me where they would. Along the grand boulevards of downtown I strolled, and down narrow alleys where my ambling footsteps resounded like the heartbeats of a lonely man\u2014now pausing as I took in some unnoticed detail, some comice or frieze, now starting again. Across parks and parking lots I found my way.\n I tried every skin in the top ten and many more, my favorites, others that I\u2019d never heard of. Saw Daugava as a river of molten gold, the Helsinki ferry a white-sailed galleon leaving harbor. Saw the old TV Tower transformed into glowering Barad-d\u00fbr and Grizinkalns into a miniature Shire. Drank in an Old Riga clad in Soviet dreariness and a space age Agenskalns in gleaming chrome.\n At last my eyes tired and my head began to ache, and I seemed to myself a stranger in this city of marvels. Then I disabled my lenses and stood bathed in darkness. I felt like a traveler returned from a long journey.\n The blocky shadows of Soviet-era apartment buildings surrounded me. Ugly gray boxes from an era which had had no excuse. Somebody had tagged a nearby wall in luminescent graffiti, ragged letters glowing blue\u2014I MISS YOU, ALINA.\n A doomed message for all its luminescence. It had probably already been reported and a digital mask pushed out via municipal update. Alina would likely never see it.\n But I did.\n It was part of my city.\n Up ahead, two golden fireflies lit up side by side. Someone was coming my way, lenses bright. A young girl\u2019s slight figure, I thought.\n I wondered if she moved through visions of my creation. I wondered if she liked the unlit world we had bequeathed to her. Did she ever think about it? Did she consider what it meant\u2014to walk through unseen spaces luminous with beauty?\n Because we all did. We inhabited invisible structures we could not know\u2014not all of them, not fully. Nine billion people living in nine billion parallel universes, all of which impinged on each other, none of which we could truly share.\n Maybe it had never been otherwise.\n As the girl drew near, I wanted to rush at her and shake her, to force our realities to collide. Instead I watched her pass by without any indication that she\u2019d noticed me. As if her skin had a filter for lost middle-aged women.\n Then I turned on my lenses\u2019 damage beacon and walked home through my city, illuminated by streetlights which glowed for an audience of one.\n Originally published in The Baltic Atlas (Sternberg Press), for the exhibition of the Baltic States Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2016.\n Tom Crosshill's fiction has been nominated for the Nebula Award, andhas appeared in venues such as Intergalactic Medicine Show, Beneath Ceaseless Skies and Lightspeed.

I took you to the mind-ship\u2014because I had no choice, because Khi Phach was away on some merchant trip to the Twenty-Third Planet\u2014because you were a quiet and well-behaved son, and the birth-master would have attendants to take care of you. You had just turned eight\u2014had stayed up all night for Tet, and shaken your head at the red envelopes, telling me you were no longer a child and didn\u2019t need money for toys and sweets.\nWhen we disembarked from the shuttle, I had to pause\u2014it was almost time for your sister to be born, and I felt my entire body had grown still\u2014my lungs afire, my muscles seized up, and your sister in my womb stopping her incessant thrashing for a brief, agonizing moment. And I felt, as I always did during a contraction, my thoughts slipping away, down the birth canal to follow your sister; felt myself die, little by little, my self extinguishing itself like a flame.\nLike all Minds, she was hungry for the touch of a human soul; entwined around my thoughts, and in her eagerness to be born, she was pushing outwards, dragging me with her\u2014I remembered pictures and holos of post-birth bearers, their faces slack, their eyes empty, their thought-nets as pale as the waning moon, and for a moment\u2014before my lips curled around the mantras of the birth-masters\u2014I felt a sliver of ice in my heart, a hollow of fear within my belly\u2014the thought that it could be me, that it would be me, that I wasn\u2019t strong enough . . .\nAnd then it passed; and I stood, breathing hard, in the center of the mind-ship they had laid out for my daughter.\n\u201cMommy?\u201d you asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, child,\u201d I said, slowly\u2014breathing in the miracle of air, struggling to string together words that made sense. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nWe walked together to the heartroom, where the birth-master would be waiting for us. Within me, your sister was tossing and turning\u2014throbbing incessantly, a beating heart, a pulsing machine, the weight of metal and optics within my womb. I ran my hands on the metal walls of the curving corridors, feeling oily warmth under my fingers\u2014and your sister pulsed and throbbed and spoke within me, as if she were already eager to fly within the deep spaces.\nYou were by my side, watching everything with growing awe\u2014silenced, for once, by the myriad red lanterns hung on rafters; by the holos in the corridors depicting scenes from The Tale of Kieu and The Two Sisters in Exile; by the characters gleaming on doors and walls\u2014you ran everywhere, touched everything, laughing; and my heart seemed full of the sound of your voice.\nThe contractions were closer together, and the pain in my back never seemed to go away; from time to time, it would rack my entire body, and I bit my tongue not to cry out. The mantras were in my mind now; part of the incessant litany I kept whispering, over and over, to keep myself whole, to hold to the center of my being.\nI had never prayed so hard in my entire life.\nIn the heartroom, the birth-master was waiting for us, with a cup of freshly brewed tea. I breathed in the flowery smell, watched the leaves dance within the shivering water\u2014trying to remember what it felt to be light on my feet, to be free of pain and fatigue and nausea. \u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d I said, at last. I might have said something else, in other circumstances; made a comment from the Classic of Tea, quoted some poet like Nguyen Trai or Xuan Dieu; but my mind seemed to have deserted me.\n\u201cShe is,\u201d the birth-master said, gravely. \u201cIt\u2019s almost over now, older aunt. You have to be strong.\u201d\nI was; I tried; but it all slid like tears on polished jade. I was strong, but so was the Mind in my belly. And I could see other things in the room, too\u2014the charms against death, and the bundle at the back of the room, which would hold the injector\u2014they\u2019d asked me what to do, should the birth go wrong, should I lose my mind, and I had told them I would rather die. It had seemed easy, at the time; but now that I stood facing a very real possibility it seemed very different.\nI hadn\u2019t heard you for a while. When I looked up, you were still; watching the center of the room, utterly silent, utterly unmoving. \u201cMommy . . . \u201d\nIt looked like a throne; if thrones could have protrusions and metal parts; and a geometry that seemed to continually reshape itself\u2014like the spikes of a durian fruit, I\u2019d thought earlier on, when they hadn\u2019t yet implanted your sister in my womb, but now it didn\u2019t feel quite so funny or innocuous. Now it was real.\n\u201cThis is where the Mind comes to rest,\u201d the birth-master said. He laid a hand in the midst of the thing, into a hollow that seemed no bigger than a child\u2019s body. \u201cAs you see, all the proper connections are already in place.\u201d A mass of cables and fibres and sockets, and other things I couldn\u2019t recognize\u2014all tangled together like a nest of snakes. \u201cYour mommy will have to be very brave.\u201d\nAnother contraction racked through me, a wave that went from my womb to my back, stilling the world around us. I no longer felt huge or heavy; but merely detached, watching myself with growing anger and fear. This, now; this was real. Your sister would be born and plugged into the ship, and make it come alive; and I would have done my duty to the Emperor and to my ancestors. Else . . .\nI vaguely heard the birth-master speak of courage again, and how I was the strongest woman he knew; and then the pain was back, and I doubled over, crying out.\n\u201cMommy!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014fine\u2014\u201d I whispered, trying to hold my belly\u2014trying to keep myself still, to gather my thoughts together\u2014she was strong and determined, your sister, hungry for life, hungry for her mother\u2019s touch.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fine,\u201d you said, and your voice suddenly sounded like that of an adult\u2014grave and composed, and tinged with so much fear it brought me back to the world, for a brief moment.\nI saw on the floor a puddle of blood that shone with the sheen of machine oil\u2014how odd, I thought, before realizing that I was the one bleeding, the one dying piece by piece; and I was on the floor though I didn\u2019t remember kneeling, and the pain was flaring in my womb and in my back\u2014and someone was screaming\u2014I thought it was the birth-master, but it was me, it had always been me . . .\n\u201cMommy,\u201d you said, from somewhere far away. \u201cMommy!\u201d Your hands were wet with blood; and the birth-master\u2019s attendants were dragging you away, thank the ancestors. There were strong hands on me, whispering that I should hold, ride the crest of the pain, wait before I pushed, lest I lose myself altogether, scatter my own thoughts as your sister made her way out of my womb. My tongue was heavy with the repeated mantras, my lips bloodied where I had bit them; and I struggled to hold myself together, when all I longed for was to open up like a lotus flower; to scatter my thoughts like seeds upon the wind.\nBut through the haze of pain I saw you\u2014saw, in the moment before the door closed upon you, the expression on your face; and I knew then that you\u2019d never forget this, no matter how it all ended.\nOf course, you never forgot, or forgave. Your sister was born safely; though I remained weak ever after, moving slowly through my own home, with bones that felt made of glass; and my thoughts always seemed to move sluggishly, as if part of me had really followed her out of the birth canal. But it all paled when they finally let me stand in the ship; when I felt it come to life under my feet; when I saw colors shift on the wall, and metal take on the sheen of oil; when the paintings slowly faded away, to be replaced by the lines of poetry I\u2019d read to your sister in the womb\u2014and when I heard a voice deeper than the emptiness of space whisper to me, \u201cMother.\u201d\nThe mind-ship was called The Fisherman\u2019s Song; and that became your sister\u2019s name; but in my heart she was always Mi Nuong, after the princess in the fairytale, the one who fell in love with her unseen fisherman.\nBut to you, she was the enemy.\nYou put away the Classics and the poets, and stole my books and holos about pregnancies and Minds\u2014reading late at night, and asking me a thousand questions that I didn\u2019t always have the answer to. I thought you sought to understand your sister; but of course I was wrong.\nI remember a day seven years after the birth\u2014Khi Phach was away again to discuss shipments with some large suppliers, and you\u2019d convinced me to have a banquet. You\u2019d come to me in my office and told me that I shouldn\u2019t be so preoccupied with my husband and children. I almost laughed; but you looked so much in earnest, so concerned about me, that my whole body suddenly felt light, infused with warmth. \u201cOf course, child,\u201d I said; and saw you smile, an expression that illuminated your entire being.\nIt was a huge banquet: in addition to our relatives, I\u2019d invited my scholar classmates, and some of your friends so you wouldn\u2019t get bored. I\u2019d expected you to wander off during the preparations, to find your friends or some assignment you absolutely had to study; but you didn\u2019t. You stood in the kitchen, fetching bits and pieces, and helping me make salad rolls and shrimp toasts\u2014and mixed dipping sauces with such concentration, as if they were all that mattered in the world.\nYour sister was there too\u2014not physically present, but she\u2019d linked herself to the house\u2019s com systems, and her translucent avatar stood in the kitchen: a smaller model of The Fisherman\u2019s Song that floated around the room, giving us instructions about the various recipes, and laughing when we tore rice papers or dashed across the room for a missing ingredient. For once, you seemed not to mind her presence; and everything in the household seemed . . . harmonious and ideal, the dream put forth by the Classics.\nAt the banquet, I was surprised to find you sitting at my table\u2014it wasn\u2019t so much the breach of etiquette, I had never been over-concerned with such strictures, as something else. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be with your friends?\u201d I asked.\nYou glanced, carelessly, to the end of the room, where the younger people sat: candidates to the mandarin exams, like you; and a group of pale-skinned outsiders, who looked a bit dazed, doing their best to follow the conversations by their side. \u201cI can be with them later,\u201d you said, making a dismissive gesture with your hands. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s also plenty of time to be with me,\u201d I pointed out.\nYou pulled your chair, and sat down with a grimace. \u201cTime passes,\u201d you said at last. \u201cMother . . . \u201d\nI laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not that frail.\u201d Though I felt weak that particular night, my bones and womb aching, as if in memory of giving birth to your sister; but I didn\u2019t tell you that.\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re not.\u201d You looked awkward, staring at your bowl as if you didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. Of course, you were fifteen\u2014no adult yet, and ancestors know even Khi Phach had never mastered the art of small conversation.\nI glanced at Mi Nuong. Your sister didn\u2019t eat; and so she spent the banquet at the back of the room, at a table with the avatars of other ships\u2014knowing her, she\u2019d be steering the conversation at the table to literature, and then disengage and listen to everyone\u2019s ideas. It seemed as though everything was going well; and I turned back to the people around my table.\nAfter a while, I found myself deep in talk with Scholar Soi, one of my oldest friends from the Academy; and paying less attention to you, though you intervened from time to time in the discussion, bringing up a reference or a quotation you thought apt\u2014you\u2019d learnt your lessons well.\nSoi beamed at you. \u201cWonderful boy. Ready to sit for your mandarin exams, I\u2019d say.\u201d\nYou looked pale, then, as if you\u2019d swallowed something that had got stuck in your throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, elder aunt.\u201d\n\u201cModesty becomes you. Of course you\u2019re ready. The fear will go away once you\u2019re sitting in your exam cell, facing the dissertation subject.\u201d She smiled fondly at that. You still looked ill; and I resolved to speak to you afterwards, to tell you that you had nothing to fear.\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Soi said, \u201cwe should have something right here, right now. A poetry competition, to give everyone a chance to shine. What do you think, child?\u201d\nI\u2019d expected you to say no; but you actually looked interested. If there was one thing you shared with your sister and with me, it was your love of words. \u201cI\u2019d be honored, elder aunt.\u201d\n\u201cYounger sister?\u201d Soi asked me, but I shook my head.\nI don\u2019t know how Soi did it, but she soon got most of the guests gathered around a table laden with wine cups\u2014making florid gestures with her arms as she explained the rules. The outsiders, who didn\u2019t speak the language very well, had all declined, except for one; but it was still a sizeable audience. You stood at the forefront of it, eagerly hanging on to Soi\u2019s every word.\nAs Soi handed out turns for composing poetry, I found Mi Nuong hovering by my side. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be with them,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat about you, Mother?\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s fifteen, and proud of his learning. He doesn\u2019t need to compete with his forty-year-old mother.\u201d\n\u201cOr with his sister.\u201d Mi Nuong\u2019s voice was uncannily serene; but of course, navigating the deep spaces, the odd dimensions that folded space back upon itself, she saw things we didn\u2019t.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said at last. I wasn\u2019t blind; and had seen the way you avoided her.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Mother,\u201d Mi Nuong said, still in the same serene tones. \u201cHe\u2019ll come around.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like you can see the future.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d She sounded amused. \u201cIt would be nice, though.\u201d She fell silent, then; and I knew what she was thinking: that she didn\u2019t need to see the future to know that she\u2019d outlive us all. Minds lived for centuries.\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d I started, but she cut me off.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. It\u2019s not that bad. I have so many more things to worry about, it doesn\u2019t really loom large.\u201d She sighed\u2014I knew she was lying to reassure me, but I didn\u2019t press the point. \u201cLook at him. He\u2019s still such a child.\u201d\nAnd she wasn\u2019t, not anymore\u2014Minds didn\u2019t age or mature at the same rate as humans. Perhaps it was her physiology, perhaps it was the mere act of crossing deep spaces so often, but she sounded disturbingly adult; even older than I sometimes. \u201cYou can\u2019t hold him to your standards.\u201d\nShe laughed\u2014girlish, carefree. \u201cOf course not. He\u2019s human.\u201d\n\u201cBut still your brother?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Mother. Of course he\u2019s my brother. He\u2019s such an idiot sometimes, but then so am I. It\u2019s what ties us together.\u201d Her voice was brimming with fond amusement; and her avatar nudged slightly closer to me, to get a better view of the contest. Everyone was laughing now, as a very tipsy scholar attempted to compose a poem about autumn and wine, and mangled words. The lone outsider stood by your side, and didn\u2019t laugh: his eyes were dark and intent, and he had a hand on your shoulder as he spoke to you\u2014it looked as if he was trying to reassure you, which I couldn\u2019t fault him for.\n\u201cHe worries for nothing,\u201d Mi Nuong said. \u201cHe\u2019ll win with ease.\u201d\nAnd, indeed, when your turn came, you got up, gently setting aside the outsider\u2019s hand\u2014and made up a poem about crab-flowers, making puns and references to other poems effortlessly, as if it was all part of some inner flow you could dip into. People stood, silent, as if struck with awe; and then Soi bowed to you, as younger to elder, and everyone else started to crowd around you in order to give you congratulations.\n\u201cSee? I told you. He\u2019ll fly through his examinations, get a mandarin posting wherever he wants,\u201d Mi Nuong said.\n\u201cOf course he will,\u201d I said. I\u2019d never doubted it; never questioned that you had my talent for literature, and Khi Phach\u2019s cunning and practical intelligence.\nI looked at you\u2014at the way you stood with your arms splayed out, basking in the praise of scholars; at your face still flushed with the declaiming of poetry\u2014and you looked back at me, and saw me sitting with your sister by my side; and your face darkened in that moment, became as brittle as thin ice.\nI felt a shiver go down my spine\u2014as if some dark spirit had touched me and cast a shadow over all the paths of my future.\nBut the shadow never seemed to materialize: you passed your mandarin exams with ease\u2014and awaited a posting from the government, though you closeted yourself with your friends and wouldn\u2019t confide any of your plans to us.\nThe summer after your exams, we went to see Mi Nuong\u2014you and me and Khi Phach, who had just returned from his latest expedition. We took a lift to the orbital that held the spaceport\u2014watching the fractured continents of the Eighteenth planet recede to a string of pearls in the middle of the ocean.\nYou sat away from us, reading a book a friend had given you\u2014the outsiders\u2019 Planet of Danger and Desire, which was the latest rage that summer\u2014while Khi Phach and I watched the receding continents, and talked about the future and what it held in store for us.\nAt the docks, the screens blinked above us, showing that your sister had just arrived from the First Planet. We stood outside the gate, waiting for her passengers to disembark\u2014a stream of Viets and Xuyans, wearing silk robes and shirts, their faces still tense from the journey\u2014from the odd sounds and sights, and the queer distortions of metal and flesh and bones one experienced aboard a mind-ship in deep spaces.\nThere were dignitaries from the Court itself, in five-panel brocade, their topknots adorned with exquisite jade and gold, talking amongst themselves in quiet tones\u2014and a group of saffron-cloaked monks carrying nothing but the clothes on their back, their faces calm and ageless, making me ache for their serenity. Last of all came a vacant-eyed mother who hadn\u2019t survived the birth of her Mind, being led by her husband like a small child. My hands must have tensed without my realizing it, because Khi Phach grabbed me so hard I felt bruised, and forced me to look away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never need to carry another Mind again.\u201d\nI looked at my hands, tracing the shape of my bones through translucent skin\u2014it had never been the same since Mi Nuong\u2019s birth. \u201cYes. I guess it is.\u201d\nWhen we turned back, you weren\u2019t with us. I glanced at Khi Phach, fighting rising panic: you were an adult after all, hardly likely to be defenseless or lost. \u201cHe must have gone to another dock,\u201d Khi Phach said.\nWe searched the docks; the shops; the entire concourse, even the pagodas set away from the confusion of the spaceport\u2019s crowd, before we finally found you.\nYou were at the back of the spaceport, where the outsider hibernation ships berthed\u2014watching another stream of travelers, their pale skins glistening from the fluid in the hibernation cradles, their eyes still faraway, reeling from the shock of waking up\u2014the knowledge that the thin thread of ansible communications was their only link to a home planet where everyone they had ever held dear had aged and died during the long journey.\nKhi Phach called out your name. \u201cAnh!\u201d\nYou didn\u2019t turn; your eyes remained on the outsiders.\n\u201cYou gave us quite a fright,\u201d I said, laying a hand on your shoulder, feeling the tension in every one of your muscles. I thought it was stress; worry at the new life that opened up for you as a mandarin. \u201cCome, let\u2019s see your sister.\u201d\nYou were silent and sullen the entire way; watching Khi Phach introduce himself to the crewmember that guarded the access to the ship, telling him we were family\u2014her face lit up, and she congratulated him on such a beautiful child. I\u2019d expected you to grimace in jealousy, as you always did when your sister was mentioned; but you didn\u2019t even speak.\n\u201cChild?\u201d I asked.\nI felt you tense as we walked into the tunnel leading to your sister\u2019s body; as the walls became organic, as faint traceries of poetry started appearing, and a persistent hum rose into the background: your sister\u2019s heartbeat, reverberating through the entire ship.\n\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d you said, as we entered.\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d Khi Phach asked.\n\u201cMind-ships.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be that way.\u201d\nKhi Phach glanced at me, inquisitively; for once, I was stuck for words. \u201cOutsiders do it better,\u201d you said, your hands shut into fists.\nWe stopped, in the middle of the entrance hall\u2014rafters adorned with red lanterns, poetry about family reunions, your sister\u2019s way of welcoming us home\u2014I knew she was listening, that she might be hurt, but it was too late to take this outside, as you\u2019d no doubt intended all along. \u201cBetter?\u201d I said, arching an eyebrow. \u201cLeaving for years in hibernation, leaving everything they own behind?\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t take mind-ships!\u201d You weren\u2019t looking at me or Khi Phach; but at the walls, your sister\u2019s body wrapped all around you. \u201cThey don\u2019t go plunging into deep spaces where we were never meant to go, don\u2019t go gazing into things that make them insane\u2014they don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t birth those monstrosities just to navigate space faster!\u201d\nThere was silence, in the wake of your words. All I could think of was all that I\u2019d ignored; the priests\u2019 books that you\u2019d brought home, your trips to the nearby Sleeper Church, and your pale-skinned outsider friends\u2014like the one who had spoken to you so intently at the banquet.\n\u201cApologize to your sister,\u201d Khi Phach said.\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\nHis voice was cold. \u201cYou just called her an abomination.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\nI let go of you, then; moved away with one hand over my heart, as if I could make the words go away. \u201cChild. Apologize Please,\u201d I said, in the tone that I\u2019d used when you were little.\n\u201cNo.\u201d You laid a hand on the walls, feeling their warmth; and pulled back, as if burnt. \u201cLook at you, Mother. All wasted up, for her sake. All our women, subjugated just so they can birth those things.\u201d\nYou sounded like Father Paul; like an outsider yourself, full of that same desperate rage and aggressiveness\u2014though, unlike them, you had a home to come back to.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to defend me, child,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd we can resume that discussion elsewhere\u2014\u201d I waved a hand, forestalling Khi Phach\u2019s objections\u2014 \u201cbut not here, not in your sister\u2019s hearing.\u201d\nA wind rose through the ship, picking up sound as it whistled through empty rooms. \u201cAbomination . . . \u201d Mi Nuong whispered. \u201cCome tell me what you think\u2014to my face. In my heartroom.\u201d\nYou stared upwards; as if you could see her; guess at the mass of optics and flesh plugged into the ship\u2014and before either of us could stop you, you spun and ran out of the ship, making small, convulsive noises that I knew were tears.\nChild . . .\nI would have run, too; but Khi Phach laid a hand on my shoulder. \u201cLet him cool off first. You know you can\u2019t argue with him in that state.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said to Mi Nuong.\nThe lights flickered; and the ship seemed to contract a little. \u201cHe\u2019s frightened,\u201d Mi Nuong said.\n\u201cWhich is no excuse.\u201d Khi Phach\u2019s face was stern.\nBut he hadn\u2019t been there at the birth; he didn\u2019t remember what I remembered; the shadow that had lodged like a shard within your heart, that colored everything. \u201cI should have seen it,\u201d I said. Because it was all my fault; because I should have never brought you to the ship that day. What had I been thinking, trusting in strangers to protect my own child?\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t torment yourself,\u201d Mi Nuong said.\nI laid a hand on a wall\u2014watching lines of poetry scroll by, songs about fishermen flying cormorants over the river, about wars dashing beloved sons like strings of pearls\u2014about the beauty of hibiscuses doomed to pass and become nothing, just as we, too, passed away and became nothing\u2014and I thought about how small, how insignificant we were within the world\u2014about letting go of grief and guilt. \u201cI can\u2019t stop,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s my son, just as you are my daughter.\u201d\n\u201cI told you before. He\u2019ll see it.\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me about your trip. How was it?\u201d\nShe laughed; giggled like a teenage girl. \u201cWonderful. You should see the First Planet, it\u2019s so huge\u2014it has all those palaces and gardens, covering it from end to end; and pagodas that go all the way through the atmosphere, joined to orbitals, so that prayers genuinely go out into the void . . . \u201d\nI remember it all; remember it vividly, every word, every nuance that happened that day. For, when we came home, you weren\u2019t there anymore.\nYou\u2019d packed your things, and left a message. I guess you were a scholar in spite of everything, because you didn\u2019t send a mail through the terminal, but wrote it with pen and paper: crossed words over and over until they hardly made sense.\nI can\u2019t live here anymore. I apologize for being an unfilial son; but I have to seek my fortune elsewhere.\nKhi Phach started moving Heaven and Earth to find you; but I didn\u2019t have to look very far. Your name, barely disguised, was on the manifest for an outsider hibernation ship headed out of the Dai Viet Empire, to an isolated planet on the edge of a red sun\u2014a trip sponsored by the Sleeper Church. The hibernation ship had left while we were still searching for you; and there was no calling it back, not without starting a war with the outsiders. And what pretext could we have given? You were an adult; sixteen already, with the mandarin exams behind you; old enough to do what you wanted with your life.\nYou wouldn\u2019t age in your hibernation pod; but by the time you arrived, twenty years would have elapsed for us, making the distance between us all but insurmountable.\nKhi Phach fumed against the Church, speaking of retribution and judgment, making plans to bring this before the local magistrate. I merely stood still, watching the screen that showed the hibernation ship going further and further away from us\u2014feeling as though someone had ripped my heart out of my chest.\nMany years have passed, and you still haven\u2019t come back. Khi Phach took his anger and bitterness into his grave; and I stare at his holo every morning when I rise\u2014wondering when I, too, will join him on the ancestral altar.\nYour sister, of course, has hardly aged: Minds don\u2019t live like humans, and she\u2019ll survive us all. She\u2019s with me now\u2014back from another trip into space, telling me about all the wonders she\u2019s seen. I ask about you; and feel the ship contracting around me\u2014in sadness, in anger?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mother. The outsider planets are closed to mind-ships.\u201d\nI know it already, but I still ask.\n\u201cHave you\u2014\u201d I bite my lips, pull out the treacherous words one by one\u2014\u201dhave you forgiven him?\u201d\n\u201cMother!\u201d Mi Nuong laughs, gentle, carefree. \u201cHe was just a child when it happened. Why should I keep grudges that long? Besides . . . \u201d Her voice is sadder, now.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the holos, too.\u201d Gently, carefully, I pull your latest disk\u2014finger it before triggering the ansible record it contains. An image of you hovers in the midst of the ship, transparent and leeched of colors.\n\u201cMother. I hope this finds you well. I have started work for a newscast\u2014this would please you, wouldn\u2019t it, my being a scholar after all?\u201d You smile, but it doesn\u2019t reach all the way to your eyes; and your face is pale, as if you hadn\u2019t seen the sun in a long time. \u201cI am well, though I think of you often.\u201d\nThe messages all come through ansible; so do money transfers\u2014as if money could reduce the emptiness of space between us, as if it could repay me for your absence. \u201cI was sorry to hear about Father. I miss you both terribly.\u201d You pause then, turn to look at something beyond the camera\u2014I catch a glimpse of slim arms, wrapped around you\u2014a quick hug, to give you strength, but even that doesn\u2019t light up your eyes or your face\u2014before you look at the camera again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2014I wish I were home again.\u201d\nI turn off the disk, let it lie on the floor\u2014it becomes ringed with scrolling words, with poems of sorrow and loss.\n\u201cHe\u2019s happy,\u201d Mi Nuong says, in a tone that makes clear she believes none of it. \u201cAmong the outsiders.\u201d\nWalking on a strange land, in a strange world\u2014learning new customs in an unfamiliar language\u2014away from us, away from your family. \u201cHappy,\u201d I say.\nI finger the disk again. I know that if I turn it on again, I\u2019ll hear your final words, the ones that come at the end of the recording, spoken barely loud enough to be heard.\nI miss you all terribly.\nUs all. Father and Mother\u2014and sister. This is the first time you\u2019ve ever admitted this aloud. And I\u2019ve seen the other, earlier holos; seen how your eyes become ringed with shadows as time passes; how unhappiness eats you alive, year after year, even as you tell me how good life is, among the outsiders.\nI\u2019ll be long gone when your pain becomes heavier than your fear, heavier than your shame; when you turn away from your exile and return to the only place that was ever home to you. By the time you come back, I\u2019ll be dust, ashes spread in the void of space; one more portrait on the ancestral altar, to be honored and worshipped\u2014I\u2019ll have passed on to another life, with the Buddha\u2019s blessing.\nBut I know, still, what will happen.\nYou\u2019ll walk out of the outsiders\u2019 docks, pale with the lack of sun, covered in the slime of your hibernation pod\u2014shaking with the shock of awakening, your eyes filled with the same burning emptiness I remember so well, the same rage and grief that all you\u2019ve ever held dear has been lost while you traveled.\nAnd, like an answer to your most secret prayer, you\u2019ll find your sister waiting for you.\nOriginally published in Interzone, issue #241.\nAliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

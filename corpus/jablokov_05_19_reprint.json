Otherwise she would burst in and start screaming at him. That was no way to start a check-in meeting with one of her refugees.\nThat gave her a chance to realize that she looked like hell. She\u2019d already had one fight that morning, with her daughter, Bodil, and afterwards she had rushed out, unsnapped and unbrushed. It was hard enough to manage someone like Phineus, all Martian and precise, without giving him more ammunition about how lax things were here, among the asteroids.\nShe stepped out of the foot traffic, pulled out her kit, sharpened her eyebrows, got her pale hair in some semblance of order, and cleaned sleep and tears out of the corners of her eyes.\nThey\u2019d put Phineus low-down, not far above actual rock, in a line of wooden cubicles along a root. Leaves rustled overhead. But there was no dramatic view up past the trunks to the spreading branches of the famed Boscobel axis, just some fibrous safety panels and a moving ladderway. Phineus sometimes grouched about what it said about his status.\nThere. Bodil had gone straight to bed after their fight. Dunya had a full day ahead of her. Looking good might be poor revenge on an ungrateful child, but that was what she had. And it had relaxed her enough. Now she was ready for that idiot.\nWhen she got into his narrow space, her most difficult refugee sat on his bed, bony knees against his chest. Phineus\u2019 cliff of a face swept up into an impressive brow and forehead. It was almost too big for the room.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you for a couple more days,\u201d he said.\nSo she\u2019d been getting predictable. And he wanted her to know it, which was interesting. \u201cI have something to talk to you about.\u201d\n\u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d He smiled.\nShe didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you. It\u2019s kind of a treat. Not a lot happens down here.\u201d\n\u201cI was just over in Lower Cort. In the Wendell Beech, about a third of the way up.\u201d\n\u201cNice spot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re the sort who likes nice spots, that is. I never pegged you for the type.\u201d\n\u201cThe branches sag down there,\u201d she said. \u201cThick growth. If you climb up bough 73, then slide a bit down the branches there, you\u2019ll find a bunch of these.\u201d She flipped something across to him. He caught it. \u201cAll hanging from strings, blowing in the breeze. They\u2019re getting tangled up in the twigs. Someone should have given them a bit more weight in the lower parts.\u201d\nPhineus looked expressionlessly at the doll in his hand. It was made from human hair, looped and woven together, with the loose ends bursting from the top of its head in a huge fall. Its face was miserable, with downturned mouth and squinted eyes, like a child with a stomachache. It might have been almost cute, but it was all held together by something thick and sticky.\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s blood, right?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gang sign, Phineus. Green Burnings. They jump the boughs around here. Sometimes keeping order, sometimes tearing it up. They\u2019re Root & Branch party supporters, field workers, and enforcers. Things have been fairly balanced lately. But if the Green Burnings push up into Five Boughs, there\u2019s going to be trouble with the Trunk. I don\u2019t know how things are on Mars, but it\u2019s not just about gang territory here on Boscobel. It\u2019s always got another dimension. The Trunkers are losing support from small businesses who think the party\u2019s not protecting their interests. Burnings jumping through Five Boughs will only make that more obvious. Things might get rough.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand local politics,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why you shouldn\u2019t be messing around with it.\u201d\n\u201cMe? What do I have to do with it?\u201d\nThat expression of outraged innocence was the last straw. Dunya snatched the doll from his hand, startling the old Martian corridor fighter with her speed, and stuck it back in her pocket. \u201cYou know them. Hang out with them. Give them a bit of training. Just keeping your Martian hand in? Or something more? In any case, you\u2019re going to get into trouble. Not just with some rival group. With me.\u201d\n\u201cHow did\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy sources are none of your business.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to reveal that she had learned it entirely by chance, by fighting with her daughter just that morning, not because she had previously had any interest in what he was doing.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong guy. I see that detritus, sure. Green Burnings, whatever. They flip off branches above me while I\u2019m catching some breakfast out at Kumar\u2019s. We got to talking. So maybe I gave them some tactical tips, just to keep my hand in. But I don\u2019t drill them or anything like that. Maybe they hired from outside. I mean, there are Martians hanging around Preem Bough. Maybe they\u2019ve set up a school or something.\u201d\nThis was unexpected. \u201cYou\u2019re the only Martian in Boscobel.\u201d\n\u201cPiece of information, Dunya: there is always another Martian. We\u2019re tricky that way.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve seen other Martians out there?\u201d she said.\n\u201cOh, you know, rumors. Someone uncomfortable with all the plant life is up there, looking for trouble. It would be nice to see someone from the old dustball.\u201d He looked bleak. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably false. I\u2019m the only Martian here. Stuck down in the roots, going nowhere.\u201d\nOnce Phineus started feeling sorry for himself, he usually went all the way and ended up lying facedown on the floor, refusing to respond. It could last for days.\nShe didn\u2019t have time for that. \u201cPhineus. Let me be clear. No more combat training. From now on. And no contact with anyone who jumps with Green Burnings. It will endanger your status if you do. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean? Say I want to go up to Kumar\u2019s. If a Burning comes in and gets coffee while I\u2019m there, do I have to pack it up and leave?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to ask, I\u2019m going to tell you. Yes. Don\u2019t even share a common space with them until I say otherwise.\u201d Phineus kept himself clean, but his room was a mess, with clothes shoved places that must have taken more work than just putting them away properly. He even had a couple of noodle-parlor containers under a cushion. She resisted the urge to lecture him about it. \u201cYou like to bring your food home. If you see a gang member, just do that. Any more questions?\u201d\n\u201cIf I ask, I\u2019ll find out I have to stay in my room. So, no.\u201d\n\u201cSmart man. Just find yourself a better hobby.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t raise his head as she left.\nBodil had sauntered in that morning just as Dunya was getting ready to leave for work. She smelled of trees far from where she was supposed to be, with a couple of girlfriends: every spot in Boscobel had its own combination of gums, saps, pollens, nectars, and oils. Bodil relied too much on the fact that her mother wasn\u2019t a native, and sometimes had trouble with the more subtle signals.\nWhen Bodil tried to just brush past her mother on her way to her room, Dunya had blocked her path with an outstretched leg. First Bodil had denied she had been anywhere. Then she said she\u2019d told her mother about it, but she, distracted and too busy, had forgotten. Then she denied that her mother had any authority that meant anything.\n\u201cAnd where is Dad?\u201d Bodil had said, through too-ready tears. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he ever here? What\u2019s he trying to get away from?\u201d\nBryn was away a lot. Dunya didn\u2019t like it either.\nBut the fight had come with one unexpected benefit. After Dunya had started in about Bodil\u2019s on-again, off-again boyfriend Unray, who jumped with the Green Burnings, Bodil had burst out with a defense of his capabilities. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who figures out their tactics. He\u2019s learned a lot, don\u2019t think he hasn\u2019t. Martian stuff, not like the other gangs. It\u2019s a whole other level of activity. You should see how he\u2019s marked their territory over at Wendell Beech . . . \u201d\nHer mother\u2019s sudden interest told Bodil she\u2019d made a mistake boasting about that. But it was too late. Dunya connected that information with other things she\u2019d learned, and understood something of what Phineus was up to. She let her daughter go, already planning a detour to Lower Cort on her way to Phineus.\nBodil could try to use Bryn as a weapon, she thought now, as she climbed to her next appointment. It would still be just the two of them for quite some time. They\u2019d have to fight it out on their own.\nShe rose through several layers of the great branches that made up the dwelling levels of Boscobel. Sometimes the view went out a great distance, revealing a group of people at a table, a prowling cat, a vortex of rain renewing pockets of water in the great branches. Usually it was compacted, held in by leaves and lattice. She finally stepped off onto a busy pathway and made her way between shops and the small personal gardens people here kept in front of their units.\nNo matter where you were, most of Boscobel was invisible, but from this level, about a third of the way up, you got the best feel for what this world was. Boscobel was trees, the biggest trees in the solar system. They stuck their roots deep into the crust, flung themselves across the axis of the spinning cylinder of the asteroid, and then plunged into the opposite side, where their upper branches became roots. In between, vast boughs spread, providing living and production areas. Some had developed leaves meters across or complex meshes of interlaced branches. Though they still bore names like sycamore and juniper, they bore only slight resemblances to their earth-rooted ancestors.\n\u201cI started out late,\u201d she said, as she came up to Fama\u2019s dining area. \u201cI\u2019m not catching up.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, you can help me get things ready. Let\u2019s roll this out.\u201d\nDunya pushed hot tables loaded with steaming pots out onto the balcony that looked out over a wide opening among the trees. Nothing dramatic, but a nice spot. It was shaded by a couple of gigantic leaves, each of which had bugs scurrying in its furry underside. To any asteroid-dweller eye, Boscobeli or not, that was comforting. It meant that, no matter what else happened, you wouldn\u2019t starve.\nFama was a big woman who seemed to wear all of her clothes at the same time. The outer garment was always different, but Dunya thought she recognized a couple of the layers underneath. It was cooler than average here, where a breeze came down from the distant North Pole. But she didn\u2019t think that was the explanation. Fama was still ready to flee, and wanted to make sure she had everything she needed with her when the time came.\n\u201cAny shakedowns recently?\u201d Dunya asked.\n\u201cNone, thanks to your suggestion.\u201d\nDunya tried to remember what she had come up with.\n\u201cAh, Strop.\u201d\nFama shrugged. \u201cHe knows his food, I\u2019ll give him that.\u201d\nMerv Strop was an agent of the Office of Adversary Knowledge, Boscobel\u2019s internal security force. Fama had been getting harassed by some low-level thugs from the Dead Roots, competitors to those Green Burnings Phineus gave tactics classes to. Dunya had suggested that she invite agent Strop to dine, in a visible way. The Dead Roots had moved off to find an easier target, while Strop had stayed.\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually got a real crime to solve, I hear,\u201d Fama said. \u201cSomeone took off with an ancient emergency kit from some secure area. It\u2019s sweating his skull, making him ornery.\u201d\nDunya had to get to business. \u201cI\u2019m curious about someone. In the area. A Martian, I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\u201cAnything else? Martians don\u2019t got red dots on their foreheads to make them easy to spot.\u201d\nDunya had found a few minutes to check up on available tourist entries. She had access because tourists were sometimes refugees in disguise\u2014or ended up as refugees when a political shift back home left them unable to return after their relaxing vacation lounging in a tree branch. No Martians had turned up, but there was one good possibility, from the innerbelt asteroid Fortuna. Fortuna had close relations with Mars, and might have been willing to cooperate in screening someone\u2019s identity. If so, this person had some connections to the Martian government, but was probably operating unofficially.\n\u201cIt\u2019s someone a fairly tough guy would still be nervous about. One possibility is a woman, supposedly from Fortuna.\u201d And Phineus had been nervous. Who knew what enemies Phineus might have made back on Mars?\n\u201cI need some critters,\u201d Fama said. \u201cSoup\u2019s kind of bland.\u201d\nDunya helped pluck bugs from the underside of the leaf. Most of them escaped her fingers. Fama grabbed writhing handfuls and dumped them into the steaming pot. Their shells puffed, and their dissolving legs gave the stock the saffron color that marked its quality. A restaurant depended on the diet of its feedbugs as much as it did on the skill of its chef.\n\u201cThat might actually explain a few things, though.\u201d Fama tasted, and nodded in satisfaction. \u201cThat\u2019s enough now. Let the rest go.\u201d\nThe bugs scurried into the fibers. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen someone?\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t think \u2018Martian\u2019 \u2019til you said. A woman. Tall. Does claim to be from Fortuna but moves like she grew up in gravity. No obvious business. Has a drink here, chats with someone there. But she\u2019s working hard the whole time. No relaxation in her.\u201d Fama was desperate to expand her business, kept her eye on competitors and potential customers.\n\u201cAny idea where I can find her?\u201d\n\u201cShe sleeps at the Moss, I think.\u201d\nFama was looking over Dunya\u2019s shoulder to see who might have come in. She should let the woman get to her business.\n\u201cAnything else you need to talk about?\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201cWell . . . \u201d Fama was suddenly reluctant. \u201cTell me. How long did it take you to feel that you fit in?\u201d\n\u201cHere in Boscobel?\u201d Dunya made it a principle to be honest with her clients. Sometimes that was difficult. \u201cMost days I don\u2019t feel I fit in at all. But sometimes, when I stand under a dripping leaf and watch the white gibbons jump the gap at Gantan, I think I should never have been anywhere else.\u201d\nFama scooped a bug out of the soup and sucked thoughtfully on its head. \u201cHope for me yet, then.\u201d\n\u201cHope for us all.\u201d\nA couple of clients later, Dunya was at the Moss, a set of rental rooms on stilts above the mosses that gave the name. This woman was after Phineus for something, and Phineus was nervous about it. His casualness had been unconvincing. If she was keeping Phineus under observation, Dunya had a chance to maybe spot her.\nPhineus wouldn\u2019t listen to a thing Dunya had told him. He\u2019d go to breakfast, meeting with a Green Burning or two, maybe in a corner, so as not to be obvious. If this woman, whoever she was, meant to keep him under observation, that would be an easy spot. If Phineus then went back to sulk in his unit, the woman might take the opportunity to come back to the Moss to take care of other business. If she did, she would most likely skirt the roots of the big ash tree.\nThat was a lot of assumptions. But Boscobel was incredibly resistant to travel if you didn\u2019t know it well. Once visitors learned a useful route, they tended to stick to it. Dunya found a spot by a mossy root where she could watch, get work done, and have someone bring her a coffee every now and then.\nAfter an hour or so, she had updated everyone\u2019s files. Just as she was considering giving it up, she saw an odd bit of movement. Someone had started down the stairs from the direction of Phineus, glanced across the open area below, then stepped back. Somehow, Dunya had been spotted.\nNow Dunya was even more interested. Who was this woman? And why was she so anxious to avoid an interview?\nShe\u2019d been successful in predicting the Martian\u2019s route home, at least. Where would the woman go now? She\u2019d probably planned out some escape route and bolt-hole, for contingencies. Dunya was used to people trying to avoid her.\nWhat choices would have seemed smart to a Martian corridor dweller who hadn\u2019t had the time to work out the intricacies of Boscobel? The main question was: up or down? Right here was a mazelike sprawl of roots. Concealment would seem easier, and it was just the kind of place that would give comfort to a Martian.\nBut she would have thought past that. She\u2019d try to be unpredictable, at least to herself. And she\u2019d want to use the ways in which Boscobel differed from her home. She\u2019d want things to be interesting. She\u2019d climb.\nThere were three good routes up from here. The closest one was exposed in most directions, easily seen. One of the other two, then.\nAs it happened, both those routes hit a bottleneck in the understory, in a volume that had suffered a fire a couple of decades before. Several branches had not regrown to useful size, so both those routes would kink back to near the ash trunk.\nDunya knew another way up. It was longer and involved climbing higher, into the crown. There was no on-bough route there, where a high wind swept the branches. To the inexperienced eye, it looked impassable. But Dunya knew a tunnel inside a bough, the result of a cleared-out fungal infection that sometimes served as swing housing for low-status new dwellers. She\u2019d have to step over people\u2019s shitpots, but they knew her there. After that a drop-down would put her across where the Martian would have to go. That should persuade her that Dunya was someone she had to pay attention to.\nNo matter what, after that she had to get home, find her daughter, and try to keep the rest of her life under repair. She grabbed a ladderway and rose up.\nThe sunglobe had moved past its brightest point and lunchtime had gone past when Dunya found herself in a wet space under massive leaves. Water burped up onto the ridged surfaces, and cascaded down to the hanging gardens below. Only a few misguided frogs clinging to strands of pale fungus gave hints of life elsewhere.\nThis was part of Boscobel\u2019s secret support equipment. Fluid-filled tubes along the walls carried nourishment to the higher reaches of the impossible trees. Light fibers pumped photons into photosynthetic centers to support metabolisms that couldn\u2019t possibly get all their energy from the mostly decorative sunglobe.\nThe woman now dodged through a small cafe that hung from the rough bark of the oak bough just below here. It was a good spot to check for pursuit.\nToo bad for her that Dunya was ahead of her, not behind.\nShe was a long-limbed woman with big hands and feet. With the strength in her shoulders she looked like she could have picked up the entire cafe and shaken everything out of it. But instead of revealing any force, she moved smoothly, sliding past people before they even knew she was there. She wore her dark brown hair loose, a style more suitable to a Martian corridor than leafy Boscobel. She\u2019d clearly bought that treesilk jacket here, though, and it suited the length of her torso. Dunya pulled herself back into concealment.\nThe chase had taken her out of herself. Now all the worries of the day came back to her. As cold water dripped on the back of her neck, she worried about her afternoon schedule, about her next encounter with Bodil, about whether Bryn would send her a message today. The longer he was away, the more entertaining his messages got, a bad sign. A poorly healed pipe with a lumpy joint vibrated under her boot, and she saw that it had shaken a couple of the big leaves loose from their adhesive connections with each other. Pushing back with her elbow and feeling the leaves peel away from each other was like childishly poking at a loose tooth with your tongue, pleasant and disturbing at once. Looked at too closely, much of Boscobel was falling apart.\nShe slid out of concealment. Where was the woman? Had Dunya miscalculated?\nShe felt the breath behind her. There was no time to respond. Something hit the back of her head and knocked her forward. She rolled, and found herself looking up at a long boot that pushed on her throat, and beyond it, slowly coming into focus, the Martian.\nThe woman wasn\u2019t beautiful, but she was certainly striking, with dark skin, high cheekbones, and big eyes the color of moss agate.\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201cI could ask you the same thing,\u201d the Martian said.\n\u201cYou could, but you have no right to. I\u2019m a citizen of Boscobel trying to get through my day. You\u2019re the one who snuck in here in pursuit of Phineus Gora.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who is Phineus Gora to you?\u201d\n\u201cMy client. He\u2019s a refugee. I\u2019m responsible for grafting him onto Boscobel.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d The woman was amused. \u201cSo you look out for him.\u201d\n\u201cI look out for all my refugees. It\u2019s my job. He\u2019s worried about why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cBut he didn\u2019t give you any details, hoping your sense of responsibility would put you in my way.\u201d The amused look disappeared. \u201cHe had no right to risk you that way. His problems should stay his own.\u201d She pulled her boot off Dunya\u2019s throat.\nFor a second, Dunya didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\u201cGet up, get up.\u201d The woman was impatient. \u201cYou\u2019ve tempted me into . . . actually, I think you\u2019ve tempted me into exactly what Phineus hoped. Exposing myself. Giving the OAKs a reason to throw me out of Boscobel. Maybe he\u2019s smarter than he seems.\u201d\nDunya sat up. What had Phineus gotten her to do?\n\u201cHe knows who you are,\u201d Dunya said.\nThe woman laughed. \u201cHe thinks he does.\u201d\n\u201cBut I still have no idea.\u201d\n\u201cIt may not matter. But . . . my name is Miriam Kostal. I\u2019m from Mars.\u201d\n\u201cDunya Hautala.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be short. Phineus is the inside man for a filibustering expedition that left Mars orbit two months ago and will be here within a day. Does that mean anything to you?\u201d\nAnarchic Mars had turned into a menace to everyone between the orbits of Jupiter and Earth. A weak central government, recovering from assassination and attempted revolution, was unable to stop ambitious groups from putting together military expeditions to seize individual asteroids and set themselves up as ruling juntas. As a girl, Dunya had fled just such a takeover, finally fetching up on Boscobel.\n\u201cAnd so you take a room at the Moss and follow Phineus around?\u201d Dunya said. \u201cHow much sense does that make? Do the OAKs know? Anyone else?\u201d\n\u201cNo one knows. Even on Mars. Filibustering expeditions rarely succeed without cooperation from their targets, either tacit or explicit. On Mars, the expedition has some official support. Here . . . I have no idea who might be involved. Anyone could have an interest in rearranging things to end up closer to the top. Phineus is a technician, not anyone involved in political discussions. He\u2019s got a specific mission, assisting the initial penetration by the attacking force. I can\u2019t trust anyone here. But I don\u2019t need to. All I need to do is figure out what he\u2019s doing, and stop it. Then I can be on my way.\u201d\nMiriam was almost persuasive. It was always tempting to skip the mess of political compromise and get straight to the decisive action. And Boscobel sure was a mess. Dunya didn\u2019t even try to deny it. But decisive action always left its own mess, to be cleaned up by people like her, while people like Miriam strode off in search of some other dramatic problem to fix.\nDunya slid herself to sit with her back against the loose leaves.\n\u201cThe complexities of corruption are all we\u2019ve got,\u201d Dunya said. \u201cI\u2019m sure not everyone\u2019s looking forward to being ruled by someone else. If you have information that will help our government fend off an attack, you should share it.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be arrested. And now you. Any investigation will be ended by the new regime. End of story. End of us.\u201d\nThat was plausible enough. But Miriam hadn\u2019t even tried getting cooperation. Dunya found herself irritated at the woman, impressive though she was. Boscobel was her home. She didn\u2019t like thinking of it as a clump of trees run by people instantly eager to betray it for a better deal.\nThe bottom of the leaves was loose. The top still stuck. She didn\u2019t have time to work on it more. She had no real reason to trust Miriam. She had to make contact with someone. She leaned her head back, as if thinking it over, and pushed harder. She knew there was a branch about ten feet below, where she could find a quick route down. The leaves parted behind her and she fell through.\nFrom the last glimpse of her face, Miriam was taken completely by surprise. But she recovered almost instantly. She dove forward, whipped out a long arm, and just managed to snag Dunya\u2019s ankle as she fell. Stopping Dunya\u2019s fall almost jerked her out of the gap. She braced one foot against the ripping leaf and swung Dunya to the side, until she dangled over a much longer drop. The endless network of tree boughs circled around her.\nShe could tell Miriam was considering it. People would pretty much assume that Dunya had tried something too difficult for a non-native to do properly. \u201cPoor Dunya never quite got the hang of it . . . \u201d\nWith a sudden effort, Miriam hauled her in. Dunya curled up and grabbed the edge of the leaf. Finally, she lay on the floor next to Miriam, sucking in air.\n\u201cNice move,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cYou practice that?\u201d\n\u201cA sudden inspiration.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cYou want to go to the OAKs for help? I can\u2019t stop you. It won\u2019t help, and it might put this whole world at hazard. But it\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\u201cWould you really have killed me?\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201cAn impolite question. We\u2019ve been slashing each other\u2019s faces on Mars for a decade or more now, trying to solve problems by eliminating the people we think are causing them. Hasn\u2019t worked for us, but it\u2019s habit now.\u201d\n\u201cNot for you, though.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rely on the quality of my habits, if I were you. Go. Go now. Before I get sensible.\u201d\nDunya could feel the stare of those agate eyes like something physical. She thought about saying something else, but nothing, not even \u201cgood luck,\u201d made sense. Without another word, she turned and went.\n\u201cEh?\u201d Strop looked up from his soup. \u201cDunya. What are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI want to ask you some questions.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I . . . \u201d Strop grunted in annoyance as Dunya pulled a chair up and joined him at his table. \u201cSuit yourself, then.\u201d\nStrop\u2019s pale hair lay plastered to a soft-looking skull. He was the local OAK agent, and as OAKs went, he was a decent sort. OAKs didn\u2019t go very far, Dunya reminded herself.\n\u201cWhat do you know about Phineus?\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, what drove him from Mars, why he\u2019s here. Who he\u2019s in contact with.\u201d\nStrop swallowed a spoonful of the soup and closed his eyes. He was known for his devotion to food, and his presence at a restaurant actually served as a sign of approval. So maybe Fama wasn\u2019t quite the victim she made herself sound.\n\u201cPhineus is your client, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s your job to make sure he stays out of trouble. What we pay you for. Didn\u2019t you do some kind of intake when you got him? Then you know he\u2019s a protected exile. Unable to return to Mars, but protected by Martian law. A Martian trying to kill him would be in serious trouble on return home. Anyone after him would have an unusual devotion to justice. Please be more vigilant about your intakes. They give you at least a little preliminary information. Too bad we don\u2019t get to do one when we have a child. That\u2019s why children can surprise you. They never fill out the proper forms.\u201d\nStrop had two well-liked and successful children, both older than Bodil. It was just exasperating.\nShe thought about giving him Miriam Kostal. That he\u2019d have to pay attention to. But Miriam had gauged her right. She couldn\u2019t do it.\nAnd she was reflecting that there were probably good reasons why Phineus had been dumped on her without much background information. Did Strop know those reasons? In any event, bringing that up would either sound like whining or be actively dangerous.\n\u201cLook, Dunya.\u201d Fama had whisked away the soup, careful to show no sign she\u2019d seen Dunya earlier, and the sculpted pyramid that steamed in front of him smelled delicious. \u201cI appreciate that you\u2019ve gotten a yen to get better at your job. These impulses never last. If you don\u2019t mind a bit of friendly advice, I\u2019d say that you should look after your own family situation instead.\u201d\n\u201cMy family situation?\u201d Dunya said. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d\nHe pursed his disconcertingly full lips, pleased that he\u2019d pissed her off. \u201cChildren can be a handful. Sometimes they can even do things that pass beyond the childish, and get in real trouble. Are you heading home soon?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s your business.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hoping to find your daughter there, give up on that notion. She\u2019s found herself a hidey-hole. She seems to think it\u2019s secret. Secrets can lead to trouble.\u201d\nThis was too much. Not only was she not going to get any action out of Strop, he was going to punish her for trying by implying that she was a bad mother.\nAnd what was even more irritating was how right Miriam Kostal had been. There would be no help in the OAKs. Whether or not there was some high-level interest in a change of regime, field agents like Strop knew better than to wander into delicate political situations. It might interfere with their digestion. So Strop would fight as hard as he could to hear nothing about Phineus.\nShe pushed her chair back, ready to stand. But she couldn\u2019t just leave. He had her, just as he intended.\n\u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201cIn the crust. Near the Xanthus airball. Her boyfriend has run into trouble from his Green Burnings buddies, big surprise. Bodil might easily end up in the same trouble. If those kids broke into where I think they did, they\u2019re all in serious trouble. Stop worrying about what plausible Martians might be up to and give your daughter some thought. This isn\u2019t official advice, by the way. One parent to another.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Strop.\u201d Dunya had to consciously loosen her jaw to speak. \u201cI hope I can return the favor someday.\u201d\n\u201cNot likely, Dunya. Not likely.\u201d\nHer daughter was definitely a Boscobel native, Dunya thought. An immigrant like her would have tried to hide in the trees. Bodil knew the many ways of getting found there, and had instead burrowed into Boscobel\u2019s neglected shell, which she thought of as invisible.\nDunya looked up into the shaft above. Boscobel had a huge volume in its shell, but only the poorest lived in it. The air rumbled. Just beyond was the vast space of Xanthus, one of the pressure equalization spaces excavated after the newly expanded shell of Boscobel had cooled.\nThe only illumination came from infrequent light bumps. There was no way she was going to stumble around this ridiculous space searching for her daughter. She stood in the center of the shaft and said, \u201cCome down, Bodil. Now.\u201d\nBefore a minute was out, she wanted to say something more. She stopped herself. The silence grew as hollow as the space around her. The best way to get a client to say something was to say nothing. That conversational vacuum could suck out the most amazing things.\nThere was a rustle. A pair of shoes appeared in a hole about ten meters up. Bodil slid into view and then slowly climbed down to the level where her mother stood.\nBodil favored her father, Bryn. She was taller than Dunya, but with softer features, big eyes, and downturned mouth. She looked gentle. Maybe someday she would be.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d Bodil spoke quietly, the way she showed she was really angry.\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s my fault?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know!\u201d The other way she showed she was really angry was by yelling. \u201cYou got that information about that Martian out of me, and now Unray\u2019s been beaten. They knew it had to come from him. They hit him, momma. A lot. I never trusted them. I want to hurt them.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s bad?\u201d Dunya said. \u201cThings are way worse than you think. Every one of us is in trouble. I don\u2019t have time for this. You don\u2019t have time for it. If we\u2019re not careful, we might all end up as slaves, or refugees, or something worse.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI need your help, Bodil. I\u2019m sorry about what happened to Unray. Probably not as sorry as you\u2019d like me to be. But we\u2019ve got Martians crawling around our home that might rip the whole thing apart and I don\u2019t have time to worry about your stupid boyfriend and his lame-ass buddies.\u201d\nFor the first time in a long time, Bodil clearly didn\u2019t know what to say. She\u2019d hoped her mother would feel guilty and help her. Instead, her mother was asking for help herself. That hadn\u2019t happened in an equally long time.\nDunya realized she\u2019d gotten up against her daughter, looking up at her, feeling like a knife pointed at her belly. She stepped back, looked around. \u201cIsn\u2019t this their territory? You shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what they call their territory. They don\u2019t deserve anything. I thought . . . I can do something to them, make them feel it, the way they made me feel it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Bodie,\u201d a voice said from the gloom. \u201cGood luck for you \u2019cause here\u2019s your chance.\u201d\nPhineus had trained the Green Burnings well. They appeared all around, blocking every route of escape, while moving as casually as if just out for a stroll.\n\u201cEger,\u201d Bodil said. \u201cEger!\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d A young man slouched from the shadows. He wore a long jacket decorated with silver loops and pins. Pieces of the stolen emergency kit, Dunya thought, the parts they thought weren\u2019t good for anything.\n\u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t have anything to do with any of this,\u201d Bodil said.\nEger looked Dunya up and down, raised his eyebrows. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look that way to me. Like she said, this is Burnings\u2019 territory. Doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s messing with it. Or why.\u201d\n\u201cWhy you\u2014\u201d\nEger blocked Bodil\u2019s blow with a forearm and threw her back. Dunya took a step forward, and found herself looking at a blade that seemed to reflect more light than there was in that dark place.\nEger shook his head. \u201cNah, Mom. Not a good idea.\u201d\nBodil was puffing next to her. Dunya thought she was crying, but when she glanced at her daughter, she realized that it was the breath of rage. Knife or not, greater fighting skill or not, she looked like she was going to throw herself at Eger.\nDid she know this girl?\n\u201cYou can define your territory with respect to some other gang,\u201d Dunya said. \u201cNot for ordinary citizens.\u201d\n\u201cOrdinary citizens?\u201d Eger was in her face. \u201cYou telling me you don\u2019t know what\u2019s what? You come here, know all our business, what we do.\u201d He looked even younger close up, with smooth skin and curly reddish hair.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get out,\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019 won\u2019t do anything. Bodil and us got to talk.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cStop it, Eger,\u201d Bodil said. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. My mom doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this. You\u2019re the one who beat Unray. Right?\u201d\nEger grinned. \u201cI got some licks in, sure. But we had to share. Everyone wanted a piece. You know what it\u2019s like when everyone wants a piece. We share, in the Burnings.\u201d\nEven though he was genuinely dangerous, Dunya found his leer too deliberate, like he practiced it in front of the mirror.\n\u201cBecause Unray could have taken you alone,\u201d Bodil said. \u201cThat\u2019s why?\u201d\nDunya knew that tone of lazy insolence well. It made her want to hit her daughter. She never had.\nEger had less restraint. Bodil dodged his first, overhand blow, but he moved fast and punched her in the side. She oofed and bent over and Dunya slid away from her position, looking for an opening, even as she knew they weren\u2019t going to get out of this\u2014\nThere was a wail from somewhere overhead, and a body came hurtling down out of the dangling roots. It hit so hard it bounced.\nDunya moved as if she had expected exactly that to happen. She hit Eger with her shoulder and, off-balance, he fell.\nShe turned to tell Bodil to run. Bodil was gone, already moving at full tilt, slashing at the face of the young Green Burning who tried to stop her. The boy dodged back, automatically covering his face. By the time he realized he still had his looks, it was too late, and she was past.\nBehind, another crash, as another scout fell from above, followed by shouts.\nHer daughter ran beautifully, also like her father. Dunya\u2019s own legs were shorter, and she had to pump them hard to keep up. She kept expecting resistance, but the Burnings had been confident enough not to set pickets out this far.\nAnd if it hadn\u2019t been for that sudden intervention, they wouldn\u2019t have needed them. Who had flung that scout down? He seemed to have been flung with some force, by someone with muscles. Martian muscles.\nShe just managed to keep Bodil in view as she dodged, first into this corridor, then that, then up a ramp, first shallow, then steep, then stairs. Stairs covered with moss and ferns. They were out, in the shadows amid the roots. Around was the rustle of leaves, the green glow, air thick with pollen. Bees flickered in the light that made it through from high overhead.\nBodil turned and fell against her mother, almost knocking her over. She was laughing. Unbelievably, she was laughing, almost helpless.\n\u201cAh!\u201d Bodil said. \u201cDid you see the look on his face?\u201d\n\u201cI was too busy panicking.\u201d\n\u201cHe always thinks he\u2019s got it all under control. Jerk.\u201d The savage look Bodil threw back down the black hole of the stairs was beautiful and terrifying. \u201cI visited stupid Unray in the hospital. He talked all tough too, and blamed it all on me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, it was my fault. Right now I need your mind working. Someone was above us in that shaft. She\u2019s just a visitor, doesn\u2019t know Boscobel. She\u2019s going to be moving out of that area, fast. Where would she go, and can we intercept her?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s really only one way. Come on.\u201d\nThe route turned out to be fairly simple, involving just a climb up to a living bridge between a twisted olive tree and a baobab whose hollow interior held a playground filled with shrieking children.\nDunya grabbed her daughter\u2019s shoulder and pointed. Below them, tall above the crowd, Miriam Kostal strolled. Dunya could sense that Bodil instantly picked her out.\nWithout hesitation, Bodil jumped off the stubby branch of a baobab. Dunya followed, hitting a mossy spot that would have been softer if it hadn\u2019t been so worn. The gravity was highest here, near the roots, and Dunya really felt the impact as she landed.\nBodil slid ahead, and up again, on the aerial root of a mangrove. They were now ahead of Miriam, though Dunya had been in that position before, and it hadn\u2019t helped her. Just below them was a noodle shop, Cairngorm\u2019s, sending up puffs of aromatic steam and making her hungry. She looked down at the bubbling pots, the patrons with their heads bent over bowls. She\u2019d never been there, but it seemed familiar to her\u2014\n\u201cMind telling me why we\u2019re after her?\u201d Bodil plopped down in a tangled mass of vines and looked up at the hummingbirds that investigated a flower just above her.\n\u201cYour buddies the Green Burnings are being used by someone else,\u201d Dunya said. \u201cA Martian. Phineus. Who happens to be one of my clients.\u201d\n\u201cYou never talk about your clients.\u201d\n\u201cThey appreciate my silence. You should too. But he\u2019s kind of moved himself out of the confidential category by trying to get me killed. And you, now.\u201d\n\u201cNah. I don\u2019t know about this Phineus. Eger was on his own, just being his usual jerk of a self. Defending Burning territory. I was just hiding out there. Hoping no one would ever find me. But you did.\u201d\nDunya had already resolved never to tell her daughter how she had found out. It was too humiliating.\nFortunately, Miriam rescued her again.\n\u201cYou think that was smart?\u201d Miriam Kostal stood over them, casting more shadow than it seemed reasonable for her lean form. \u201cPutting yourself at risk was bad enough. Putting my mission at risk might be fatal.\u201d\nInstead of being intimidated by the other woman\u2019s anger, Dunya found herself just as mad. \u201cI don\u2019t need to justify myself to you.\u201d\n\u201cProtecting your offspring.\u201d Miriam eyed Bodil. \u201cHow do you feel about being defended, little girl?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to set us against each other.\u201d Bodil\u2019s insolence was more pleasant when applied to someone else. \u201cThat\u2019s our own, on our own time. Nothing for you. And my name\u2019s Bodil.\u201d\nMiriam looked the girl over, then smiled, an expression as tight as a wrestler\u2019s grip. \u201cPleased to meet you, Bodil. Have you had a chance to figure out what it is you are now involved in?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Not that much.\u201d\n\u201cIf I knew what your mother was up to, I might be able to fill in some of the gaps for you.\u201d\nBodil and Miriam turned to look at her, and Dunya found herself nettled. That had been a nice bit of solidarity with her daughter, but it was over. Now that they were standing side by side, she fancied she saw similarities between her daughter and the rangy Martian. They both had sharp jaws, and an easy stance. Assuming that Dunya was perversely withholding information seemed to be another thing they had in common.\n\u201cBodil. That trim Eger was wearing, some of the others. What was it? Where did they get it?\u201d\n\u201cThose loops? They grabbed some kind of gear from some old locker.\u201d\n\u201cEmergency gear?\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know. They were all excited about it, though. First real operation. Tactics, penetration of secure areas. Martian training, they said.\u201d\n\u201cYou have information about it?\u201d Miriam said in Dunya\u2019s ear.\n\u201cA friend who runs a restaurant heard about it. Someone took off with a complete emergency kit. An old one, probably ignored and forgotten.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did they run their operation?\u201d Miriam asked Bodil.\n\u201cImperial Valley. There\u2019s an access lock there, not used much now. This was in the storage area nearby. Secure, I guess. Not as secure as the OAKs thought, though.\u201d She couldn\u2019t suppress a hint of pride in what her boyfriend and his unpleasant friends had accomplished. \u201cBut . . . what\u2019s going on?\u201d\nDunya could feel Miriam waiting. This was up to her, how much to tell. \u201cPhineus, the guy they\u2019ve been getting their lessons from. He\u2019s the inside man in a Martian filibustering expedition that means to take over Boscobel. He\u2019s using them as some kind of screen.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s using them to gain access to an airlock,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cA place they can make entry. And their vessel will be here soon.\u201d\nBodil looked at Dunya. \u201cMomma. What do we do?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no need for you two to do anything,\u201d Miriam said.\n\u201cReally?\u201d Dunya had thought about how to argue this. Practicality was the best way. \u201cDoes that give you the best chance of success?\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to help me by going back to the OAKs again?\u201d Sarcasm didn\u2019t suit Miriam.\n\u201cThe theft of safety equipment is a real crime, one the OAKs can enforce without any concern about who is hoping the Martians will give him a better office. If they hold Phineus for that, it will give you some breathing space. And Bodil . . . do you think you could face Unray again?\u201d\n\u201cSure. I have to go there and tell him we\u2019re through. I was too mad the last time.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that will give you a good reason to pump him on what the Green Burnings are up to. I\u2019ll bet it isn\u2019t at all what Phineus thinks they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\u201cI have the perfect outfit,\u201d Bodil said. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for the opportunity to wear it. I\u2019ll break his heart.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d\n\u201cDo I get to say anything about the help I need?\u201d Miriam was surprisingly patient.\n\u201cI waited for that,\u201d Dunya said. \u201cI finally went without it.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a lot of assumptions. Some are bound to be wrong. Be ready to switch direction as necessary. Keep your OAKs on the emergency kit, and leave any mention of Martians to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou got it.\u201d\n\u201cI have to handle Phineus carefully,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cHe\u2019s got support back home, and harming him would have bad consequences. But preventing him from acting will achieve what I need. Then, maybe, Martians can start hashing out their problems with each other, rather than exporting them. It\u2019s a dream, of course. But it\u2019s one I share with my husband.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re married?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked. Hektor doesn\u2019t get to see much of me, unfortunately. While he\u2019s trying to build a stable coalition at home, I\u2019m usually out trying to keep each leak from turning into a blowout.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he misses you.\u201d\n\u201cI wish he was out here with me. He\u2019d be better at working with people than I am.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Dunya said. \u201cYou seem to be doing fine.\u201d\nDunya could see that, despite herself, the fierce Martian was pleased. Dunya wanted to meet the man who could keep someone like that in his bed.\n\u201cThe sooner we take care of Phineus and his ridiculous ambitions, the sooner I can get home,\u201d Miriam said.\nDunya would have loved to order Bodil home, to prepare dinner and perhaps ready for a siege. That would just result in Bodil\u2019s running off to do something on her own. She hoped she would not regret the choice that she had made.\n\u201cSee you, momma.\u201d Bodil gave her a kiss, and was gone.\nBy this time, with the sunglobe getting red, Strop would have moved up and over and been holding court at a restaurant high up in an aromatic cedar. She\u2019d have to find a way to get him on that missing emergency kit without getting herself arrested\u2014\n\u201cTwice in one day.\u201d Phineus blocked the twisting ladder ahead of her. \u201cHow about that?\u201d\nHe was the last person Dunya wanted to see. \u201cI\u2019m in kind of a hurry right now.\u201d\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d He moved as if to go around her, then leaned in, his big forehead looming. \u201cDid you get a chance to check out my fellow Martian?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on my list, Phineus.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in danger! It\u2019s not at all like you not to take the concerns of your clients seriously.\u201d\nUnfortunately, that was true. He knew her too well. \u201cI think you just made her up.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I did. But was my imagination good enough for you to notice if the Martian pursuing me was a man or a woman?\u201d\nNo way she could remember how precisely he\u2019d described who was after him. It didn\u2019t matter. He knew that she would have checked his story out by now, and that Miriam would have done something about it. As far as he was concerned, no explanation for why Dunya was walking around healthy and alive was a good one.\n\u201cI might have a chance to get out there before I go to bed.\u201d If he wasn\u2019t going to move, she would swing around him. She glanced up at a convenient branch, to find two long-jacketed kids hanging over her, one girl, one boy. How long had they been there?\nPhineus shook his head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t miss, Dunya. That\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid of her. I was hoping she\u2019d make a mistake and get herself in trouble. Instead of killing you, she recruited you. And here I thought you were on my side.\u201d\nBefore Dunya could move, the two kids grabbed her and swung her into the leaves.\nTo her surprise, there were fish here. A carp bumped its snout into her mask.\nWithin five minutes of grabbing her they had bound her, put her into a mask and air supply, tied her legs to an elastic band, and sucked her down under a water drop. It was half local water supply, half wildlife reserve\u2014and now her prison. Phineus had not looked her in the eye as the Green Burnings had done their work, but just before the water had closed over her head, he had muttered, \u201cThe new administration will free you.\u201d\nHe had made her complicit with his plot. Only his success would bring someone here to keep her from suffocating. If he failed she would be left here to become food for these fish.\nDunya breathed slowly and carefully. She had no idea how much air she had, and struggle would just shorten the time she had left. She\u2019d curled herself down a couple of times. She could find no way to influence her bonds. She could only plan for what she would do if someone rescued her, or compose her soul for death.\nThe face mask, with its blinking indicators, smelled old. It had to be from the stolen emergency kit. So it was designed for vacuum, not underwater use, yet another thing to worry about. It did have an eyeball-controlled display that she ran through. No comm, and no \u201ccut my bonds\u201d command. It did have an inventory list of the kit of which it was a part, some things marked as \u201cexhausted\u201d or \u201cdamaged-unrepairable.\u201d It included two spacesuits, of which this was presumably one, an exoshelter, fuel cells, enough procal bars to live on for a few months while awaiting rescue . . . and a full emergency airlock. Without her consciously willing it, the faceplate showed her an exploded view of the airlock and listed all of its many components. Good to go, it told her with satisfaction.\nPhineus had gotten the Green Burnings to steal the old emergency kit because he wanted the airlock. Dunya was sure of it. That the kit had been stored near the Imperial Valley airlock was just a distraction. Miriam was wasting her time there.\nBut he needed a place to link inside and outside. Asteroid environments didn\u2019t survive by being easy to punch through. Dammit. It was one thing to resolve to be calm and meditative and accepting. It was another to keep on doing it. Where was Bryn? Why wasn\u2019t he around, at least to comment mordantly on affairs? Her husband had been increasingly given to mordant commenting. Doing something about things was less his line.\nBut she was being unfair. He worked with cultural development in various asteroids, as far sunward as Phobos. He was respected, and busy. When he came home he was loving, attentive, and everything he needed to be.\nAnd then he was gone again. And she found herself just as happy. Could she imagine some other man who she would want around more? Sometimes she thought she could. But she, too, was too busy to spend too much time on that.\nBryn\u2019s absence was equally hard on Bodil, of course. So she ran with losers like Unray, getting rudimentary political education with the Green Burnings. That seemed a reasonable explanation. Nothing to do with anything Dunya herself had done.\nDid this face mask have a setting that sucked away all illusions? Clever, some of these old gadgets. A rough way to die, though, facing the absolute truth about everything you\u2019d been so careful to keep under control.\nShe thought about Bryn\u2019s own dusty and peppery scent, which had eventually faded from his side of the bed, careful though she\u2019d been not to move anything, and only breathe it when she absolutely had to. She\u2019d smelled something else recently, associated with quite a different man. Peppery as well, but damper, and tanged with . . . cilantro. She remembered the noodle shop she\u2019d parked herself above to get a drop on Miriam.\nPhineus had shoved leftover containers under his cushions. From that same place, Cairngorm\u2019s.\nHe was working with his airlock somewhere down in Xanthus. The crust was thinner down there, sure, but it was still nothing you could just hack through.\nSomething splashed above her. A larger fish? Since the carp, she hadn\u2019t seen much more than larvae. But now it was dark, and she couldn\u2019t see anything. Someone yanked on her. She stretched up, then was pulled back by the cable holding her bound feet. She sensed swearing, hearing nothing. Arms reached far in, grabbed her, and pulled hard. She rose and rose . . . and finally pulled free. Then she was lying on a seeping bank of wildflowers. Her face mask was pulled off.\n\u201cMomma!\u201d Bodil said. \u201cAre you still breathing?\u201d\nUnray had given Bodil her mother\u2019s location. He was out of the loop as far as Green Burning tactical operations were concerned. But someone had felt it right to tell him that his soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend\u2019s mother had been captured and imprisoned in a water tank in the cedars.\nYou found virtue in the oddest places.\n\u201cI guess they sometimes hide stuff in here,\u201d Bodil said. \u201cContraband. Not usually people, though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dunya looked at a bundle of steaming leaves that lay amid dew-covered yellow flowers.\n\u201cMom! You have no idea how hard it was for me growing up, to have a mom that didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\u201cGod, of course I know what it is. Should I eat it, or nap on it?\u201d\nIt was the wrong tone to take, even if she was newly resurrected and should be cut some slack. Bodil pushed her lower lip out and looked about to cry.\nDunya hugged her daughter. \u201cWe\u2019re on a mission,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd we have a lot to do. Unwrap it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d Bodil pulled off her jacket and put it around her soaked, shivering mother. Then she dropped to her knees and unwrapped the leaves, letting steam rise into the dark air.\nThis lozenge cake was traditional Boscobeli food for a journey. The leaves were from a modified fig and added a spice to the outer layers of the dough, which cooked enzymatically when tugged in just the right way. Dunya had never cared for it, finding it too sour for a decent dessert, and, uncooked, too hard as a pillow, the use the ancient and fictional tradition had for it.\nOf course, a people defined itself by those things no sensible individuals would pick on their own. And Bodil was Boscobel born and bred. So Dunya sat on a branch in a world she had not chosen, happy to be alive, and shared the almost inedible cake with her daughter.\nBodil had figured it out instantly. Any airball had an expulsion pore, through which the waste rock had been expelled. And above that, a series of baffles. All safe, no danger from the ancient weakness.\nExcept that, at the base of Xanthus, the baffles had collapsed into useless piles of cracked rock, another sign of the deferred maintenance that put the entire world at risk.\nDunya climbed down the tumbled slabs alone. Bodil had gone to find Miriam. She wouldn\u2019t succeed, of course. But Miriam would find her. Dunya only hoped that would happen before she got herself into serious trouble down here.\nOne other thing Bodil had learned from Unray: there was no one from the Green Burnings down here. They\u2019d gotten irritated with their mysterious guru, and had dumped Phineus in preference to mixing it up with their competitors over in Five Boughs. After that, a party. Phineus was on his own down here.\nIt didn\u2019t really matter. He could take her easily. She had to wait for Miriam, who knew what to do. Miriam would have told her that herself.\nShe couldn\u2019t listen to Miriam, even though what Miriam had not actually said made perfect sense. Phineus was still her client, making bad choices. Even as she knew she had to stop him, she recognized him as her responsibility.\nThere he was, working with a small light. The airlock was in. She could see the rubble from the sealed pore all around it. Being so small, it had to be secret. It could fit, at most, two people at a time. It was next to impossible to get an army in position and deployed using that. But, as she had learned from both Phineus and Miriam, next to impossible was a Martian\u2019s favorite spot to get a seat.\nShe thought she was moving quietly. Phineus heard her, and jerked around. The light caught her.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re all wet.\u201d\n\u201cOh, how thoughtful, Phineus,\u201d she said.\nHe muttered something.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry. It had to be done.\u201d\n\u201cPlease stop, Phineus. Just stop. Do you really think you\u2019re still going to get a force of Martians in here?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cYou think what you see is what there is. I have support, here in Boscobel. It\u2019s really my place, not yours.\u201d\nShe tried not to think about how much he was right. \u201cContingent support. If-you-win support. If there\u2019s any problem, it will vanish. I walked right in here. The gang you trained up is gone, you\u2019re here alone. That should tell you something.\u201d\nHe\u2019d never done his own dirty work. First he\u2019d sent Dunya into Miriam\u2019s path in the hopes that Miriam would take her out, then he\u2019d used his gang. Now he was pretending to be too busy to bother with her. No wonder he\u2019d left Mars. He just wasn\u2019t up to it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to advance on Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything\u2019s owned or closed off. The only way to get somewhere is to come out here. There\u2019s a lot of unrealized value in the asteroids.\u201d\nIf he was arguing, there was a chance. But it was too late for him. At the last instant it seemed he knew that, because he stopped and stared at her. Before he could say anything else, Miriam dropped from somewhere overhead and kicked him in the head.\nNot straight on, though. Phineus reacted fast. He tilted his head so that the force of her kick grazed past, then tried to help her on her way with a slap at her heel.\nMiriam was fast too. She spun and landed in a crouch.\nDunya wished she could help. But she knew all she could do was get in the way or become a hostage.\nThe struggle was brief and vicious. Then Phineus whipped a rock at Miriam, and when she dodged he rolled and launched himself into a black gap among the dry roots.\nWithout hesitating, Miriam went after him. Both vanished among the rocks.\nDunya stepped down to the airlock. The least she could do was deactivate it while Miriam did her work.\n\u201cI need to return that in good working order,\u201d Strop said. He stood among the rocks, looking miserable and sweaty. Stumbling around in the high-gravity area in the dark wasn\u2019t usually his way of getting things done.\n\u201cDid it get too public?\u201d Dunya said. \u201cToo hard to deny?\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t expected him to answer, and he didn\u2019t. He lumbered forward and slapped a Maintenance Required sticker across the airlock.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Dunya said.\n\u201cI can at least tell you something that won\u2019t happen. No Martian vessel will approach Boscobel. If one does, it will get a warning shot, and know to go elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cThus ensuring no one ever has to testify to who knew what.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cA lot of people would prefer that. You might even be one of them. If Phineus is still alive, he won\u2019t get a trial either. He\u2019ll be expelled. He can go to Mars, where they\u2019ll kill him. Or he can go somewhere else. Not our problem. I do need to say that your inability to control him will be a black mark on your record. Not a lot I can do, but I\u2019ll put in a good word for you.\u201d He smiled at her.\nShe\u2019d take a shower when she got home. That might do something about the greasy film he left on her, even as he was helping her out.\n\u201cAs staff is rotated off the entry and departure airlocks to be revetted and cleared, coverage will be affected. Pretty much anyone who wants to get out of Boscobel without interference will be able to do so.\u201d\nShe glanced up. Bodil stood on a rock high above. She smiled and gave her mother the thumbs-up.\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Strop said. \u201cGet your girl home. I\u2019ll pick up our unfortunate Martian invader.\u201d\nShe\u2019d have to use Bodil to communicate with Miriam and get her off Boscobel. Too dangerous for Dunya to do it directly. That was too bad. That woman was someone to know.\nSomeday, she guessed, Bodil would want an off-Boscobel school. Deliberately exposing her daughter to Miriam\u2019s influence would be dangerous, of course. But she had heard that there really was nothing like a Martian education.\nShe climbed up the shattered slabs of rock, back toward the trees she had come to rely on.\nOriginally published in The Other Half of the Sky, edited by Athena Andreadis and Kay Holt.\nWith only a handful of stories, mostly for Asimov's, and a few well-received novels, Alexander Jablokov established himself as one of the most highly-regarded new writers of the '90s. His first novel, Carve The Sky, was released in 1991, and was followed by other successful novels such as A Deeper Sea, Nimbus, River of Dust, and Deepdrive, as well as a collection of his short-fiction, The Breath of Suspension. His most recent novel is Brain Thief."}

Though I was in the middle of reading three or four other books at the time, once I started it I couldn\u2019t stop. Compelling characters, interesting politics, an unnerving but wholly plausible science fictional set-up, and nothing extraneous\u2014I finished it that same night. After Bios, I picked up more of his novels, but then I started focusing heavily on reading short stories and thought to myself, \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be a while before I get back to Wilson.\u201d\nWrong.\nLater that same year, in the dealer\u2019s room at WorldCon in Montr\u00e9al, I chanced on a signed, first edition hardcover of his collection of stories The Perseids and Other Stories. I couldn\u2019t pass it up. And I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. \u201cDivided by Infinity\u201d is just one of several stories that linger in the mind long after reading, and it reinforced my sense of having discovered a major science fiction writer. None of Wilson\u2019s subsequent releases, which I now eagerly anticipate, have made me doubt that belief.\nRobert Charles Wilson\u2019s first novel, A Hidden Place, was published in 1986. Since then he has written seventeen novels, including the Hugo Award-winning Spin, and the aforementioned collection of short stories, The Perseids and Other Stories. Other awards include the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for his novel The Chronoliths, the Philip K. Dick Award for the novel Mysterium, and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for his short story \u201cThe Cartesian Theater.\u201d His work in translation has received the Seiun Award, the Kurd Lasswitz Prize, and the Grand Prix de l\u2019Imaginaire. He lives just outside Toronto with his wife, proofreader, and music journalist Sharry Wilson. His most recent novel is The Affinities.\nYour work\u2014particularly Spin (2005) and its two sequels, Axis (2007) and Vortex (2011)\u2014powerfully conveys what Robert Silverberg once described as the \u201csmallness of Us and the immensity of It.\u201d Would you say science fiction is particularly well-suited to exploring this theme?\nI can\u2019t think of a genre better suited to exploring it. But there\u2019s more here than just the truism that we\u2019re insignificant creatures dwarfed by a vast, uncaring cosmos. There\u2019s the startling fact that we know this about ourselves. I think of it as the paradox of the telescope: What amazing and unprecedented creatures we are, that we can build a telescope and discover what small and insignificant creatures we are. And that\u2019s not just a facile irony\u2014I think it\u2019s an invitation to awe rather than despair.\nYou\u2019ve been called an heir to Theodore Sturgeon and Ray Bradbury, while also being compared to Olaf Stapledon and Greg Egan. Is combining intimacy and pathos with more cosmic, reality-bending perspectives a conscious decision on your part, or does it simply emerge from the kinds of stories you choose to tell?\nI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a real dichotomy. The cosmos is only meaningful to the degree that it\u2019s experienced by sentient beings, after all. And fiction as an art form is a finely-tuned device for generating a sense of intimacy and pathos in readers\u2014a novel that doesn\u2019t do that, at least to some degree, is fundamentally broken.\nThe way narrative can capture and evoke the shared experience of our lives\u2014the scratch of snow against an icy window, a conversation at a garden party, the touch of a hand in a darkened room\u2014is a big part of why I read and why I write. And what\u2019s wonderful about science fiction is that it lets us treat the cosmic and the ordinary as a figure-and-ground reversal, a sort of literary Nekker cube.\nYour science fiction novels are remarkably varied. In what ways do you keep your curiosity and creativity primed, to sustain what Paul Di Filippo has called your \u201cdeliberate heterogeneity\u201d?\nI think it\u2019s just my own scattershot curiosity, in combination with a genre that lets me get away with indulging it. And while I don\u2019t think of what I do as \u201cgenre-bending,\u201d some of my novels are in a kind of dialogue with genres other than science fiction, which might make them seem more heterogeneous than they really are. Julian Comstock borrows its voice and structure from 19th-century American moralistic and adventure fiction, for instance, and Burning Paradise has a few nods to contemporary thrillers and horror novels.\nGiven the range of your science fiction works, have you ever considered writing a novel outside the genres of the fantastic altogether? How about non-fiction?\nI\u2019ve thought about it, and I don\u2019t rule it out, but there\u2019s very little of what I want to do that doesn\u2019t fit within science fiction, to be honest. As for non-fiction\u2014I watched my wife Sharry Wilson go through the long process of writing her book Young Neil (ECW Press, 2014, about the early years of singer/songwriter Neil Young), and I don\u2019t think I have what it takes to do that kind of sustained, detailed research.\nReaders have noted a tone of melancholy in works like Memory Wire (1988), Darwinia (1998), The Chronoliths (2001), Blind Lake (2003) and the more recent Burning Paradise (2013). Gary Wolfe, discussing your short stories, commented on their \u201cheartbreaking sense of loss.\u201d Has this been inspired by specific personal losses, or does it result from a more abstract existential worldview\u2014or both?\nI guess I\u2019ve experienced as much personal loss as the average North American of my age and background, but if there\u2019s a sense of melancholy in my work I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the sole explanation. Nor am I sure about \u201ca more abstract existential worldview,\u201d but maybe that\u2019s closer to the truth. We\u2019re the first species on Earth to have evolved the kind of sentience that forces us to acknowledge (or deny) our mortality, both as individuals and as a species. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d but it\u2019s certainly poignant. You can\u2019t talk about time and change without giving at least a little thought to human ephemerality. \u201cMan is in love, and loves what vanishes.\u201d\nThe Affinities, just out, is your 17th novel; The Perseids and Other Stories (2000) is your only short story collection to date. Your bibliography suggests a shift away from short stories during the last decade or so. Can you talk a little about that?\nA temporary shift, maybe. I tend to write short stories in batches, and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s been a few years since the last round. I think of myself as a novelist first, and I read more novels than short fiction, so maybe that\u2019s natural. But short fiction still interests me. Some of the writers I most enjoy reading do their best work at shorter lengths\u2014Steven Millhauser, Ray Bradbury, Ted Chiang. It wouldn\u2019t take much more than an interesting idea to lure me back into short fiction.\nI\u2019m currently reading Millhauser\u2019s collection Voices in the Night, and it strikes me how fragile these wonderful stories are, like delicate life-forms that can exist only in the ecosystem of short fiction. Millhauser seems to generate such ideas effortlessly. I don\u2019t. Short stories are labor-intensive for me. But some ideas only work at shorter lengths, and yeah, I\u2019ve stored up a few such ideas. We\u2019ll see.\nThe first part of The Affinities deals with Adam Fisk finding a new family for himself in the Tau Affinity. The name Tau made me think of the five castes\u2014Alphas through Epsilons\u2014in Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World. Do you see The Affinities as tracing its lineage to this type of social science fiction, or do its roots lie elsewhere?\nI wasn\u2019t thinking of Brave New World when I wrote The Affinities, though I\u2019m flattered by the comparison. And this may be a petty distinction, but The Affinities isn\u2019t social science fiction in the sense of \u201cfiction based on the social sciences.\u201d The Affinities imagines a kind of social technology derived from new discoveries in cognitive science. In other words, the imaginary technology is social but the speculative science undergirding it is cognitive and neurological.\nThe Affinities, of course, aren\u2019t castes. No one\u2019s obliged to join one, and you can leave at any time. In many ways, they\u2019re the opposite of an authoritarian model of organization. They aren\u2019t easy to govern from the outside, and they quickly evolve out from under the nominal control of their parent corporation. What makes them powerful is what they offer\u2014an idealized family, an idealized politics, meaningful social support systems\u2014and the open-ended way they evolve and compete.\nIn a way, the idea owes more to stories like H.G. Wells\u2019 \u201cThe Door in the Wall\u201d than to dystopias like Huxley\u2019s Brave New World. The Wells story is a fable about a man who discovers a mysterious green door that admits him to a paradisiacal world in which all his longings are fulfilled\u2014but if you leave, you may never find that door again. The Affinities begins with the narrator Adam Fisk hesitating at a door that seems to make a similar promise. Adam\u2019s door-in-the-wall is a suite of neurological tests, and the paradise behind it is perfectly real. But it\u2019s not the only paradise, and not everyone who knocks on the door can get in. That\u2019s the moral and political dilemma at the heart of the book.\nIf there was a perfect Affinity for you, what would it be like?\nThe Tau tranche house, at least as Adam encounters it in the first part of the book, feels like a place I could happily live. And the most positive reactions I\u2019ve heard are from readers who feel the same way. But it\u2019s part of the premise that not everyone will find Tau particularly alluring. \u201cYour mileage may vary\u201d is built into the nature of the concept.\nOne of The Affinities\u2019 central concerns is how human culture and individuals might be transformed, for better or worse, by the application of science to human dynamics. How do you get along with social media in the here-and-now?\nIndifferently and idiosyncratically. I enjoy interacting with readers on Facebook, for instance, but I can\u2019t work up any real enthusiasm for Twitter. But that\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t have any weighty Cory-Doctorow-like insights to offer, and of course The Affinities isn\u2019t about social media, though a couple of reviews have drawn the connection.\nIn a recent interview you mentioned that \u201ccognitive science is opening big new doors for imaginative fiction to step through.\u201d Who are some of your favorite pioneers\u2014writers or scientists\u2014of this frontier?\nTerrence W. Deacon is a professor of evolutionary anthropology at UC Berkeley who wrote a book called Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter. He invented the word \u201cteleodynamics,\u201d which I borrowed for The Affinities, mainly because it sounds so wonderfully science-fictional. Deacon\u2019s book sketches out how we might begin to understand life and consciousness at the level of complex thermodynamics. It\u2019s immensely interesting stuff, almost a blueprint for the next century\u2019s work on abiogenesis and the evolution of consciousness. (One of Deacon\u2019s graduate students just emailed me to say Deacon \u201cthinks it is rather cool that teleodynamics got a mention in a science fiction book.\u201d) Another book I keep going back to is Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and its Challenge to Western Thought by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson.\nBoth books are large, long, and technical, so I don\u2019t necessarily recommend them to the casually curious. And I\u2019m not a scientist or a philosopher, so I can\u2019t evaluate them on that level. But they led me down some interesting speculative roads, and that\u2019s already showing up in my fiction\u2014in The Affinities in particular, and in a book I haven\u2019t yet started to write, tentatively called The Cure.\nJohn Clute, in his review of Burning Paradise, posits that one of the novel\u2019s main themes is \u201cthat we were not designed to survive our evolutionary success . . . having escaped our niche, we have nothing but ourselves to eat.\u201d How do you feel about this interpretation, and how does this idea strike you in real life?\nA little bleak. It\u2019s true, I think, that our technological success is taking us out of our comfort zone as a species. We haven\u2019t evolved a lot of tools for dealing with slow, large-scale problems like global warming, and we have a bad habit of clinging to social and economic institutions even when they\u2019ve outlived their usefulness or demonstrated toxic side effects.\nIn Burning Paradise an alien symbiotic entity has helped us address some of those problems, without our knowledge and for purposes that aren\u2019t entirely altruistic. But the irony is that the aliens aren\u2019t conscious, sentient beings. They\u2019re essentially machinelike, and all they can do to achieve their ends is manipulate human nature as they find it. In other words, they haven\u2019t made us do anything we couldn\u2019t have done on our own. The paradise that burns is as much our creation as it is theirs.\nYou\u2019ve been hard at work finishing a new time-travel novel called The Last Year. How does time travel in this novel differ or relate to its depiction in A Bridge of Years (1991) and The Chronoliths? What was the inspiration for The Last Year? Any tentative idea of its release date?\nA Bridge of Years and The Chronoliths were both fairly conventional time-travel stories, with the conventional concerns about how altering the past might alter the future. I didn\u2019t want to write that kind of story again. The Last Year imagines a vast array of \u201cpasts,\u201d each one a distinct alternate universe. Nothing you can do in such a universe affects anything back home. If this were Bradbury\u2019s \u201cA Sound of Thunder,\u201d you could shoot dinosaurs and trample Paleolithic butterflies to your heart\u2019s content.\nSo we have a situation in which corporate interests are free. Treat the past as an exploitable commodity\u2014say, by opening a luxury resort hotel in 1870s America, catering to wealthy tourists from the future but also to locals rich enough to pay for the opportunity to gawk at motion pictures and dioramas of The Word to Come. Cultural conflict is inevitable, of course, and it means such a project is unsustainable\u2014either the locals are going to be fatally offended and bring the whole thing down, or this version of \u201cthe past\u201d will change so dramatically that it loses the virtue of authenticity. But a few years is long enough to extract a significant profit, and who cares if it doesn\u2019t last longer than that? There\u2019s always another 1875. It\u2019s a renewable resource.\nPart of the fun of the book is the uncensored dialogue between two Gilded Ages, each deeply suspicious of the other. The \u201clast year,\u201d of course, is the year when it all breaks down.\nI should be handing in the book next month, but there\u2019s no publication date yet.\nAlvaro is the co-author, with Robert Silverberg, of When the Blue Shift Comes, which received a starred review from Library Journal.

They\u2019re fun, but often also a bit of a cop-out from a worldbuilding point of view. A dystopia instantly feels momentous, serious, tense. The more dystopian the setting, the weightier the story, increasing the chances that the story will be taken seriously. A dystopia creates its own external conflict. It also means the writer can stack the story with violence, because in a world gone wrong, violence is often the only option.\n But damn, I\u2019m sick of them. Let\u2019s talk about utopias instead. Chirpy, bright Utopia, land of health and happiness, where the good are great and the great are heroes. All our many beloved, utopian classics\u2014\n Cue the turntable needle scratching across the record.\n Actually, SFF doesn\u2019t create utopias very often. Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s The Dispossessed is probably the main utopian classic in the modern canon. Of course, there are others (Alastair Reynolds in Blue Remembered Earth, and Samuel R. Delany in Trouble on Triton come to mind\u2014feel free to school me in the comments). Utopias were comparatively popular in the 1970s but their popularity faded fast. Utopias are rare now. In fact, they\u2019re statistically irrelevant compared to dystopias.\n Why? Utopias are great. They show us just how good humanity could have it if we could only set aside our differences and work together. That\u2019s valuable. You can\u2019t aim at something if you can\u2019t see the target. I think we need more utopias, so here comes the hard sell for creating your own. We\u2019ll hit a few problems along the way, but it\u2019ll be fun.\n Define Your Utopian Conditions\n First, think hard about what you value, what you think is true and beautiful about humanity, and make it the core of your Utopia. But right away we hit the first big problem with making a Utopia. People don\u2019t all value the same things.\n Here\u2019s a specific example. I have a series of loosely-connected stories with a common socioeconomic system I created to be utopian. It reflects my vision of a positive future for humanity, but almost nobody recognizes it as a Utopia. In fact, most reviews identify it as a dystopia.\n It\u2019s not though. It\u2019s a border-free, post-scarcity universe. Nobody suffers from lack of food, shelter, or material goods, and there\u2019s a wide variety of options for quality of life. No matter how weird someone\u2019s idea of a good life, they can probably find it. People who want to work, work. Those who want to play, play. Violence is extremely rare. Disease, eradicated. War, nonexistent. Everyone should recognize this as a Utopia, so why do people call it a dystopia?\n It\u2019s because the economics in this universe only work by making some difficult trade-offs, and these trade-offs look more than a little dystopian.\n The first trade-off is overpopulation. The economy is based on the idea that the only thing of value is people\u2019s time. The basic unit of value is the billable hour, and the only way for a city to get more billable hours in its balance sheet is to attract a growing population. This is my sneaky way to instill the value of human life in a capitalist system.\n It means a popular, successful city is crowded. People who value personal space more than, say, a vibrant social scene might have to leave. Depending on what they want out of life, they might decide to move to a less successful city, which offers a quality of life that attracts fewer people and therefore offers more private living space.\n The second trade-off is lack of privacy. Timely and efficient delivery of municipal services in a highly populated urban setting requires situational awareness\u2014which is essentially widespread surveillance. Not coincidentally, surveillance is also an effective tool for conflict mediation and crime prevention.\n Widespread surveillance is a classic dystopian element, direct from Orwell\u2019s 1984. But does it have to be? Freedom from the threat of violence is certainly essential for a Utopia, and without changing human nature, or instilling behavior modification tech (another dystopian element), I\u2019m stumped over ways to achieve it.\n I\u2019d argue that surveillance itself isn\u2019t dystopian. It\u2019s a tool like any other, and it\u2019s dystopian only in a corrupt system with draconian laws. That\u2019s arguable, I agree. But, like I said, not all of us value the same things.\n So, here\u2019s my Utopia: A post-scarcity, borderless world where everyone freely pursues their bliss and nobody dies in war or lives in fear. It\u2019s crowded and there\u2019s very little privacy, but those trade-offs suit me just fine. How about you?\n You likely aren\u2019t willing to make these same trade-offs to get a post-scarcity, borderless world. You might not even want a post-scarcity, borderless world. Your Utopia is probably completely different, and the trade-offs you\u2019re willing to make for it might make it a dystopia for me.\n So, if we can\u2019t agree on what makes a Utopia, can we even make one?\n The Trouble with Trouble\n There\u2019s another problem, too. Probably everyone would agree that utopias are conflict-free. If people fight all the time, it\u2019s no Utopia, right? But what\u2019s a story without conflict? No wonder utopias are so rare. There\u2019s a piece missing, and it\u2019s the central tentpole of storytelling.\n Now, I started trying to talk you into making a Utopia, and have already given two reasons why it\u2019s impossible.\n But don\u2019t worry, this second problem is easier. People are conflict engines. We can make drama out of two sticks and a bit of dried moss.\n You already know this. But for writers, it\u2019s always worth contemplating how well and truly people can screw things up. If humans as a whole are expert at one thing, it\u2019s creating problems, and the path of human history shows us getting better and better at making bigger and bigger messes.\n Have you ever tried to get a group of people to work together, even to achieve a simple goal? Unless they\u2019re trained professionals drilled in workflow processes and led by talented leaders, forget it. Total disaster. And even when it\u2019s just two people, anyone who\u2019s ever been in a serious relationship knows how difficult it is to harness up and pull together year after year, over all life\u2019s potholes. Even when people love each other, lasting cooperation is hard.\n The options for human drama are endless. We make decisions with partial information, failing to consider implications in detail. Even when we do analyze a problem to the best of our ability, unexpected knock-on effects can turn the best of decisions into disasters.\n We can\u2019t help but screw things up. Humans are nosy and impulsive. We make emotional decisions while claiming to use considered logic. Or we get so caught up in doing our jobs, we forget to interrogate our actions. Even when we do the right thing, we work so hard we neglect to take care of ourselves and the people we love.\n Systems break down. Communication conduits get clogged. The perfect team cracks under pressure. A stranger comes to town and throws everyone into a tizzy. In a Utopia, as in any story, the possibilities for conflict are limitless.\n The one thing you probably can\u2019t do in a Utopia, though, is unleash the violence. Maybe that\u2019s one reason dystopias have become so popular: we can\u2019t really accept violence unless it\u2019s in a world with no choice. Which is no bad thing, at all.\n Put It All Together and Stick It In the Oven\n Have I convinced you yet? Take your most cherished human values, layer them with key trade-offs to make the system work, then slather it all over with sweet human drama, and you\u2019ve made a Utopia cake.\n But if nobody\u2019s going to recognize it as a Utopia, is it worth all that effort? Darn right. Because one thing\u2019s for sure: your Utopia will be interesting. So, build it, write it\u2014your own private Utopia.

At the age of twenty-one, she easily looks five years younger. If they didn\u2019t already know, no one guess that this is one of the most exciting young rock stars in England.\nThe year is 1979, and Styrene\u2019s band, X-Ray Spex, has been launched into the limelight thanks to their 1978 debut album, Germfree Adolescents. Technically speaking, it\u2019s punk rock. But it also incorporates saxophone, synthesizers, and Styrene\u2019s buoyant yelp, a voice that\u2019s both bubbly and piercing.\nStyrene is being filmed for an episode of BBC\u2019s August Arena documentary series, an hour-long program titled, aptly enough, Who Is Poly Styrene? As she\u2019s being captured for TV, she\u2019s also gazing at a TV, forming a strange recursion. She\u2019s watching a show about John Maynard Smith, the eminent geneticist and author of the canonical scientific text The Theory of Evolution.\nIn this documentary-within-a-documentary, Smith explains how genetic engineering\u2014the deliberate manipulation of the human genome in order to effect a desired result in newborns\u2014may come to play a large part in the evolution of the human species in the coming centuries. Styrene\u2019s eyes are wide, but she\u2019s not buying it. In response to the prospect of human beings being engineered in the womb to grow up more qualified to work certain jobs, she says, \u201cIn the wrong hands and used the wrong way, [genetic engineering] is terrible. I mean, I find that quite frightening that actually we won\u2019t have much control.\u201d She\u2019s mixing the skepticism of a punk priestess with the dystopian clarity of a science fiction prophet.\nPunk exploded in 1977 thanks to the release of The Sex Pistol\u2019s Never Mind the Bollocks, and although proto-punk and post-punk would both draw heavily from science fiction, punk itself couldn\u2019t have been less concerned with science fiction. Science Fiction was still associated with the florid extravagance of progressive rock, whose grandiosity punk rock aimed to deflate. Fantasy, naturally, was completely off the table; no punk band would have been caught dead singing about unicorns, dragons, or wizards, although many punk bands worshipped T. Rex\u2019s Marc Bolan, who unabashedly celebrated all three of those fantasy tropes in his music.\nThe early British punk band Alternative TV had a song in 1977 called \u201cHow Much Longer,\u201d in which the preeminent fantasy author Michael Moorcock is explicitly lumped in with the hippie scene: \u201cHow much longer will joss sticks rule / They grow their hair long and stringy and wear Jesus boots / Afghan coats, yeah, making peace signs, man / Talk about Moorcock, Floyd down the Reading Festival?\u201d Punk was all about gritty social realism and pugnacious confrontation; escapism of any kind was deemed the enemy.\nThat said, X-Ray Spex weren\u2019t the only punk band of the \u201970s explosion that tapped into the nervier side of science fiction. A handful of punk bands referenced SF here and there; Scotland\u2019s peppy, outrageously-costumed The Rezillos steeped themselves in b-movie schlock, naming songs \u201cDestination Venus\u201d and \u201cFlying Saucer Attack.\u201d The Clash namechecked the villainous cyborgs the Daleks in their 1977 song \u201cRemote Control.\u201d The Adicts took on the eerie, boiler-suit-and-bowler-hat look of the droogs from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, adapted from Anthony Burgess\u2019 1962 dystopian book. In fact, A Clockwork Orange\u2019s lurid look at youth-gang brutality in the near future held sway on many punks, including the Misfits. The New Jersey band formed in 1977, and leader Glenn Danzig turned their morbid yet catchy songs into miniature tributes to many science fiction and horror films and tropes, from \u201cI Turned Into a Martian\u201d to \u201cAstro Zombies.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a great irony that, within a decade of punk\u2019s big bang in 1977, a new subgenre of science fiction\u2014cyberpunk\u2014would co-opt the term as a suffix, one that would eventually and enthusiastically be used in an ever increasing array of science fiction and fantasy subgenres, from steampunk to clockpunk to dieselpunk to mythpunk. Punk may not have had more than a grudging rapport with science fiction and fantasy at first, but the genres haven\u2019t held any grudges.\nStyrene was born Marianne Joan Elliott-Said in 1957, the daughter of a Scottish-Irish mother and a Somali father. After a period of teenage rebellion in the mid-\u201970s\u2014including a stint as a hippie, not to mention a failed record as a reggae singer, titled \u201cSilly Billy,\u201d that was released in 1976 under the name Mari Elliott\u2014Styrene renamed herself when she became baptized by punk.\nShe was nineteen when she assumed her new persona. Her band X-Ray Spex was inspired by the shocking phenomenon of The Sex Pistols, whose lewd, sneering, blasphemous mouthpiece Johnny \u201cRotten\u201d Lydon had become Britain\u2019s public enemy number one. For all its infamy, though, punk broke down doors. Hordes of kids who had previously never thought themselves motivated or talented enough to start a band picked up guitars, drums, and microphones. And as crude as punk proudly was, they began expressing themselves.\nX-Ray Spex were part of that wave, but they were a different kind of punk band. Instead of spiking her hair, Styrene kept it curly. Instead of dressing in leather, safety pins, bondage pants, and other garb meant to evoke an image of nihilistic sadomasochism, Styrene wrapped herself in vivid pastels and kitschy clothes from secondhand shops. Her pop-art style carried over to the name of the band, which was taken from the Cold War-era toy called X-Ray Specs\u2014allegedly able to imbue the wearer with the ability to see through skin and clothes\u2014which was advertised primarily in comic books.\nIt\u2019s telling that X-Ray Spex dubbed themselves after a cheap, frivolous, clearly fraudulent bauble. Styrene, after all, took the name of a plastic as her pseudonym. On Germfree Adolescents, the song \u201cArt-I-Ficial\u201d addresses that plastic nature, the slick and hermetic falseness that had come to envelope consumer society. In it Styrene sings, \u201cMy existence is elusive / The kind that is supported / By mechanical resources,\u201d as if she\u2019s enslaved in a state of blissful yet horrific cybernetic stasis.\nHer feeling wasn\u2019t an isolated one. In the \u201960s and \u201970s, technophobia had established itself one of the staple themes of science fiction, after the generally optimistic Golden Age of Science Fiction had given way to the more cynical and complex New Wave. Dystopia gripped the popular imagination, and technology was crucial to the praxis of oppression. From The Twilight Zone episode \u201cA Thing About Machines\u201d\u2014in which everyday appliances turn against their unappreciative owner\u2014to Walter M. Miller, Jr.\u2019s classic science fiction novel A Canticle for Leibowitz, which prophesizes a post-apocalyptic future that shuns science.\nRather than recoil from technology, however, Styrene embraces it with postmodern irony. That gleeful capitulation to mass-marketed inhumanity makes it all the more chilling when she claims, \u201cI wanna be Instamatic / I wanna be a frozen pea / I wanna be dehydrated / In a consumer society,\u201d in the in X-Ray Spex song \u201cArt-I-Ficial.\u201d The phrase \u201cfrozen pea\u201d very nearly rhymes with \u201cSoylent Green\u201d; in fact, the people-derived foodstuff from Harry Harrison\u2019s novel Make Room! Make Room! could easily be substituted into the song without significantly changing its meaning.\nConsumerism in its most rampant form is another SF theme that dominates Germfree Adolescents. Amid its serrated guitars, squawking saxophone, and barbed pop hooks, the album weaves an ironic, sophisticated subtext that mocks its own commercial aspirations while undeniably embodying, if not emblemizing, them. It envisions an insidiously euphoric future in which a gleaming sheen of artifice and homogeneity cocoons society like so much shrink wrap. And whether we like it or not, Styrene posits, that future is now. As she told John Savage in his book England\u2019s Dreaming: Anarchy, Sex Pistols, Punk Rock, and Beyond:\nMy thing was more like consumerism, plastic artificial living. [ . . . ] There was so much junk then. The idea was to send it all up. Screaming about it, saying: \u201cLook, this is what you have done to me, turned me into a piece of Styrofoam, I am your product. And this is what you created: Do you like her?\u201d\nThe record-buying public in England did indeed like her, shrill deconstruction and all. Styrene, for a brief time, became a bona fide pop star in England, thanks to infectious punk anthems like \u201cThe Day the World Turned Day-Glo,\u201d a propulsive song with hallucinatory couplets such as \u201cX-rays were penetrating through the latex breeze / Synthetic fiber, see-through leaves fell from nylon trees,\u201d which might have come straight out of one of J. G. Ballard\u2019s dreamlike catastrophe novels, but especially 1966\u2019s The Crystal World. That exultation in pure plastic-ness set the tone for the new wave music of the \u201980s to follow, which glibly skimmed the surface of Styrene\u2019s image and sound without touching the substance underneath.\n\u201cI wanted to write something using all kinds of plastic words and artificial things, make kind of a fantasy style around it,\u201d Styrene said of \u201cThe Day the World Turned Day-Glo,\u201d adding, \u201cIt means something too. In an indirect way it\u2019s about the modern world, and maybe you could say it\u2019s futuristic.\u201d Styrene never spoke openly about any possible science fiction influences on her antiseptic yet kaleidoscopic view of art and society, but it had many precedents in SF. The relation between consumerism and conformity is at the core of Aldous Huxley\u2019s 1932 milestone Brave New World, a novel whose ideas have since trickled down and permeated the cultural bedrock.\nThese ideas also pop up in the works of Golden Age science fiction authors Frederick Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth, both separately and as collaborators. In the 1950s, Pohl and Kornbluth each published short stories\u2014\u201cThe Midas Plague\u201d and \u201cThe Marching Morons,\u201d respectively\u2014that projected the growing trend of consumerist obsession into a nightmarish tomorrow, and the two co-wrote the like-minded novels The Space Merchants and Search the Sky. Satirical and scathing, these stories served as cautionary tales against the herd mentality that Pohl and Kornbluth saw American society eagerly adopt, all too soon after the defeat of Fascism in Europe in World War II. Capitalist society purported to exalt the individual, but given near infinite choice, people chose to be the same anyway. They even identified themselves by packages, brands, and consumer choices as much as anything that\u2019s unique and intrinsic to themselves. It\u2019s the same unsettling paradox that Styrene oozes, from her name to her music.\nStyrene\u2019s sly sense of humor dovetails with another work of science fiction, one that was rising at the same time as X-Ray Spex. In 1978, Douglas Adams\u2019 radio show The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy debuted on the BBC, followed a year later by his novelization. The clever, madcap tale of a hapless human named Arthur Dent who stumbles toward the secrets of the cosmos after witnessing the destruction of Earth (to make way for an intergalactic bypass), The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide captured the minds of a generation and became an instant phenomenon\u2014and while Adams wasn\u2019t a punk by any stretch of the imagination, his iconoclastic attitude and sharp wit couldn\u2019t have been more in tune with Styrene\u2019s.\nAs befits X-Ray Spex\u2019s worship of superficiality, the only blatant reference to science fiction in Styrene\u2019s lyrics pertain to the most popular SF television show of the time. \u201cBionic Man is jumping / Through the television set / He\u2019s about to materialize / And guess who\u2019s coming next,\u201d she sings in \u201cGenetic Engineering,\u201d referencing the titular hero of The Bionic Man as played by Lee Majors.\nGranted, Majors\u2019 character isn\u2019t genetically engineered; he\u2019s a cyborg, half man and half machine. If anything, though, that cheerful disregard for factual rigor only makes Styrene\u2019s slapdash, secondhand repurposing of science fiction seem that much more fitting. Tragically, Styrene\u2019s knack for blurring the boundaries between science fact and science fiction took on a devastating dimension when, in 1979, her then-undiagnosed mental illness contributed to a startling vision she saw while on tour with X-Ray Spex. In England\u2019s Dreaming, she remembers:\nAll of a sudden I looked out of the hotel window. And I saw this sort of energy. It was bright, bright, luminous pink, and it had a disc shape. It was faster than the speed of light. I was inside a window, but the radiation effect hit my body. I was suffering afterwards, and my body kept going hot and cold.\nX-Ray Spex fell apart soon after Styrene\u2019s breakdown. From there, her forays into music were sporadic; she issued three solo albums over the decades, including 1980\u2019s restrained yet sublime Translucence, which vibrates on some blissed-out plane of cosmic mysticism\u2014that is, as much as a synth-heavy new-wave album could do that. X-Ray Spex regrouped for a comeback album in 1994, Conscious Consumer, but practically all of the SF-centric elements of Germfree Adolescents were stripped away in favor of more on-the-nose social statements. Styrene still delivered them playfully, even if her unique alchemy of surreal SF and biting commentary had been diluted.\nStyrene\u2019s final solo album, Generation Indigo, came out in April of 2011. She died of cancer the week of its release at the age of fifty-three. Even at the end, her voice retained an elastic youthfulness, as if she\u2019d been hermetically preserved in exactly the manner she once sang about in X-Ray Spex. Listening back to Germfree Adolescents, Styrene comes across as a citizen of some troubling, deceptively utopian future, one who has excavated the remnants of late-20th-century culture. Now, through the language of song, she\u2019s attempting to make sense of our fossils. She\u2019s not, however, an archaeologist. She simply found our civilization buried under her playground.\nJason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

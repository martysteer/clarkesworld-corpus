Some anonymous lab assistant nicknamed him Pierre, and the moniker stuck. After Pierre survived the rigors of testing and training, his world went dark for a time once the Neuroscience Division got their needles and scalpels and computer-brain interfaces onto and into him.\nHe was a child again. A sponge. Malleable. He had dreams and remembered them\u2014the great ape facility from which he\u2018d come, the jungle before that. A troop. He had flirted with moonlight and squinted against sunshine while his troop loped through the undergrowth and scampered up the trees and foraged amid the generous loam where he groomed and was groomed. Various Shes were there in limbo, too, between dream and memory. Pierre\u2019s mind reached out, clutching at phantoms from a blurry past and running into the long now\u2014all of it oozing and hrmmm-ing like fluorescent lights with faulty ballasts. He weighed his new life amid antiseptic halls, an institution\u2019s sterility and scientists\u2019 data points and vagaries of conditioning against the harsher realities of death, quick in its smiting, in the tropics and faces framed with their own intelligence. He yearned for a place absent this new awareness\u2014signals of higher and greater thoughts like thunder at the hem of distant mountains.\nInside a year, he learned to speak with his newly acquired vocal cords\u20143D bio-printed wonders of Clockwork Corp.\u2019s NuFlesh(tm) proprietary systems\u2014and, thus, No. 157 became the first uplifted articulate chimpanzee.\nAnd he was going to the moon.\n2: Comped\nPierre received the ping of a incoming message on his way out the door. He had a mandatory conditioning session and made to ignore the message to queue up later, then fell short of his initial plans.\nBureau of Personhood.\nHe caught himself wanting to oohoohooh in anxiety and excitement but tamped down those impulses. Some quirks hadn\u2019t quite ironed out since uplift, and his human handlers and colleagues overlooked much, thank goodness.\n\u201cThis is Pierre.\u201d\nA woman\u2019s face greeted him with a sliver of a smile that bespoke scores of such practiced smiles daily and the beginnings of crow\u2019s feet at the edges of her eyes. Pierre wondered what kind of punishment the poor liaison had done to deserve shuffling files and contacting various hominids and none too few uplifted canines (a recent development) along with some advanced NuEmote(tm) Model Mark robots. Still, he was glad she had contacted him.\n\u201cPierre, I have good news.\u201d\nFinally.\n\u201cI\u2019ve sent you a message with a printable, watermarked certificate of personhood.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Sarah, for all your help.\u201d\n\u201cThank the lawyers at Clockwork Corp.,\u201d she said. \u201cThey saw the handwriting on the wall. You had the virtue of many legal precedents on your side.\u201d\n\u201cI\u201d\u2014the words sometimes wouldn\u2019t come\u2014\u201cappreciate your taking time to-oohooh face-contact me.\u201d\nThe practiced smile widened, and he saw the glimmers of a few teeth. \u201cWhy, thank you kindly, Pierre.\u201d\n\u201cAt least I\u2019m not working basic municipal services,\u201d he said. The majority of uplifted apes ended up employed in recycling facilities or treatment plants unless, of course, one was part of an R&D department for the largest corporation in the world and a handy PR football tossed around in the mining claims wars raging on the moon.\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realize how fortunate you are.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d And he felt immediately unlucky to be condescended to. Or complimented. He still had trouble navigating social mores. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cHave a good day, Pierre.\u201d\n\u201cYou, too-ooh, Sarah.\u201d\nAs her image faded, Pierre stared at the screen and considered his newfound reality.\nPersonhood.\nThe company wanted a poster child for the new wave of lunar exploration. All he had to do was make a loathsome trip to Human Resources and request an addendum to his work contract for this upcoming expedition. The concept of money didn\u2019t escape him, but he had little use for it. He banked a pittance for little things like sodas. Sodas he loved.\nThe ideas grew. Humans talked with anticipation about taking vacations, and he wanted vacation time, which was not a component of his old contract. No more day passes into the city. No more permission requests for visits to museums or . . . or . . .\nThe possibilities unfurled in his mind, and Pierre smiled.\n3: Human Resources\n\u201cWell, this is a first,\u201d said the HR rep. \u201cWonder if the company ought to consider changing the name of the department now?\u201d\nPierre didn\u2019t laugh during the man\u2019s pregnant pause. \u201cNew territory.\u201d\n\u201cIn more ways than one. First, congratulations on your official personhood status. You\u2019ve come a long way, Pierre.\u201d\n\u201cHmmmm.\u201d\nA flash of jungle memory stung him: sunlight lancing the canopy and the screams of another chimpanzee caught in a great cat\u2019s jaws. He could expect a headache\u2014the single and sometimes debilitating side effect of the CBI gear in his head.\n\u201cYou still have a week before launch. It takes three days to process a contract addendum request. I can message you.\u201d\n\u201cDo you see any reason it might be denied?\u201d\n\u201cNo more than any other request.\u201d\n\u201cOoh.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, \u2018Oh.\u2019 \u201d\nThey shuffled through several documents that required e-signatures, eye-stamps, and DNA proofs as Pierre did his best to maneuver the platitudes of small talk.\n\u201cIs this what they meant by signing in blood?\u201d\nThe fat man chuckled. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d He offered his hand to Pierre, who hesitated, then shook. A rarity. All of his physical reinforcement and interactions had consisted of claps on the shoulder and good-natured squeezes of the upper arm\u2014even one high five. Very few handshakes. His hand met the clammy palmflesh of the fat man, who seemed quite appreciative.\nWhen Pierre excused himself, he left with the distinct impression that the fat man was lonely despite dealing with other humans on a daily basis. Alone in a troop. Pierre was stung again as he walked the fluorescent-lit halls to the Fitness and Conditioning wing, signed out, and trained outside. A hard workout in the obstacle course would boost his endorphins and help him fight the headache. He hated the humans\u2019 pain relievers while understanding their necessity.\nA bright yellow sun bathed him. A great eye whose warmth slithered down through a noisy canopy. Pierre allowed himself thoughts of trees and courting and earth and night-nesting, and the daydream became a nightmare Klaxon calling out his buried limbic fears of being hunted. Captured.\nFLEE!\nHe scaled trunks and brachiated vines and limbs, missed one and plummeted to earth. He became a caged thing in a preserve; the trees were not the same\u2014constructs for primates to climb and maintain their facade of health and activity. A group of handlers seized him and parleyed him to an alien, antiseptic landscape full of hooting and yowling.\nThe real nightmare, the waking one, happened when he fell asleep and woke to the reality of his uplifting and a flood of information, a cascade of new schema expanding exponentially\u2014the synaptic flood churning and frothing in his mind from the cerebral implant. He understood the cries of the other animals the way an adult understands a child\u2019s cries\u2014a mixture of sympathy tinged with the patina of intellectual distance.\nThe memory remained, still blunted by time and his uplifting\u2014a photo fading from color to monochrome or perhaps spackled brightly, overexposed and portions blotted out.\nHe needed to get away.\n4: Tsuki\nThe susurration of servos and hissing of actuators alerted Pierre as he finished his gymnastics and, planning to warm down with yoga, dropped to the ground.\nThe Model Mark II lunar-bot approached him in hexapod form, and Pierre couldn\u2019t help thinking of a gigantic arachnid, some mutant lurking and emerging from the shadows of the thick foliage of once-home, ready to snatch baby chimps from the troop. Still, Pierre\u2019s edginess softened when he saw Tsuki.\n\u201cGood afternoon, Pierre. News travels fast.\u201d\n\u201cOf?\u201d\n\u201cYour having been granted personhood. How does that make you feel?\u201d\nTendrils of the headache coiled around his brain. \u201cI put in for a vacation after we revised the contract.\u201d\n\u201cA reward. I see.\u201d She skittered alongside him and used one of her four arms to retrieve his water bottle and hand it to him.\n\u201cThank you, Tsuki. It still seems a mere formality.\u201d\n\u201cWhile conferring you wider latitude of rights and privileges.\u201d\n\u201cToday would have been the same regardless.\u201d\n\u201cA rather cynical view, if perhaps a valid observation.\u201d\nHis head echoed with the ghost-strains of the headache. A ripple from the back of his neck straight-lined from the CBI\u2019s scar and to his eyes.\n\u201cIf you say so-ooh.\u201d\n\u201cWould you care to run through a mission simulation with me in the Augmentation Array?\u201d\n\u201cHold on a moment.\u201d Pierre retrieved his wafer tablet, which buzzed slightly, and he queued up his meager bank account. It had already been flagged for a deposit. \u201cHuh. They actually did it.\u201d\n\u201c \u2018They\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cThe company. Given today\u2019s news, I\u2019ve received dividends on shares retroactively for the duration of my employment. Good faith call on their part.\u201d\n\u201cThat was charitable if manipulative.\u201d\n\u201cAt least I have more money to put toward that vacation.\u201d\n\u201cAnd sodas.\u201d\nPierre smiled. \u201cGood idea. Care to join me for a cafeteria pit stop?\u201d\n\u201cGladly.\u201d\n5: \u201cApollo\u2019s Death (and Perhaps a Resurrection)\u201d\nREUTERS\nOP-ED\nByron Pettigrew\nThe Apollo program ended in 1975 with the catastrophic failure of the Apollo 20 mission. Col. William \u201cMemphis\u201d Cato and geologist Dr. Angela Phelps had the unfortunate encounter with Mr. Murphy in the form of a cascade of failures. A dying retro-thruster. On the same side as the thruster\u2014since the module came down harder\u2014a leg collapsed. Other than the rough landing (and thankfully the LRV suffered no damage), Cato and Phelps had every reason to believe they could return to the orbiter. They could do what the stalwart trio of Apollo 13 did. Or the crew of Apollo 19.\nOnly, they couldn\u2019t, especially not when, after five hours of work, a baseball-sized meteor ripped through the top of the lunar module. The duo awaited the inevitable.\nNASA held its memorial with the rest of the nation. The Cato and Phelps families held their respective memorials while Mission Control decided to close the Apollo program with this disaster and move on.\nThere is no better time to return to the moon than the fiftieth anniversary of the mission. Consider the time and tide of change: The joint venture featuring a Russian multistage rocket along with a United States orbiter and a Japanese lunar module that could only be capped with Clockwork Corp.\u2019s lunar-bot, a Tsuki Model 2, and Pierre the Uplifted Chimp (so labeled by at least one children\u2019s book spinning out of the affair).\nThere have been the predictable protests about using uplifted animals, but because of a corporate law loophole along with legal precedents set in prior years for uplifted dogs and cats (and one gecko), Pierre would not be the first ape in space, but he would be the first uplifted ape to walk on the moon. Other such chimpanzees see this as quite a boon to their quest for equality.\nThat Pierre volunteered for the flight has been lost on some of the more vocal and otherwise well-intentioned anti-upli\u2014.\n::SKIP AD SURVEY? CONTINUE TO REMAINDER OF ARTICLE?::\n6: Fly Me to the Moon\n\u201cNow that we are up here, I am farther removed from being a political football and poster child for a handful of advocacy groups,\u201d said Pierre. He swiveled his chair after he deleted a dozen invitations to speak from organizations.\n\u201cAn interesting idiom,\u201d replied a section of the wall. Tsuki had slaved herself to the orbiter\u2019s computer system. The Clockwork Corp. lunar-bot had all-terrain capacity like her forebears, but the TLRV possessed additional mimetic qualities beta-tested in Earth\u2019s most inhospitable climates. Her maiden voyage was at hand with this mining mission. Even if something happened to the main computer, she could manage the rest. Designed for versatility, she was a good tool to have on board. \u201cAt least you are not configured into the hull\u2019s interior.\u201d\n\u201cBut, Tsuki, you\u2019re saving space,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cSo very ergonomic. Efficient.\u201d\nThe pilot chuckled. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d be flying to the moon with a chimp and a robot, much less myself. Or hearing unintended puns.\u201d\n\u201cIt was intended,\u201d said Pierre.\n\u201cMight I suggest some practice? It\u2019s a long enough ride.\u201d\n\u201cSo, the UN and the North American Directorate finally opened up some lunar territory for mining,\u201d said the pilot. \u201cAnd I get to ferry a robot and a sapient ape.\u201d\n\u201cMore accurately, exploratory missions,\u201d said Tsuki.\n\u201cAnd furthering the accuracy, uplifted,\u201d said Pierre.\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Tsuki.\n7: Mare Serenitatis\nAlmost three full months into the rotation, and Pierre could taste his vacation amid the mapping and spectrography. He had to admit that the stillness and the gliding and jumping freedom of a low-gravity environment excited him, and farther out on their digs, he imagined Tsuki did her fair share of indulging his ooh-ooh-ooh\u2019s of joy. If he played golf, he would\u2019ve driven plenty of golf balls as far across the Sea of Serenity as possible.\nBut all such thoughts faded fast as he stared at a lunar lander.\n\u201cTsuki, I need you at my location,\u201d said Pierre.\nHer voice, tinny through his helmet\u2019s speakers, replied, \u201cAre you all right, Pierre?\u201d\n\u201cYes. No. I\u2019ve found something\u2014ooh-ooh\u2014somethings, to be precise.\u201d\n\u201cETA in seven minutes.\u201d\n\u201cRoger that.\u201d\nHe hop-drifted several more meters, and his concern grew.\nOoh-ooh-ooh.\nNearby lay an older model emergency habitat.\nPierre stared down from the ridge upon the swath of Mare Serenitatis, but closer were two bodies in spacesuits. He bounded down to them; they lay facing each other. Their desiccated faces grinned and yawned at each other from across the decades, and Pierre knew enough of history to realize that today\u2019s mining spectrometer experiments were rendered moot.\n\u201cPierre?\u201d\nTsuki had retracted her trundles into her back and skittered down to him on her hex-legs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found a fifty-years-dead pair of astronauts, Tsuki.\u201d\n\u201cCompany protocol dictates immediate contact and securing of the site,\u201d said the \u2019bot.\n\u201cAlready done that. Col. William Cato and Dr. Angela Phelps, it looks as if you two are finally going home,\u201d said Pierre.\nAll these years and frozen in such a tableau.\n\u201cWe should follow our exact path in back out, Pierre, so as not to disturb further the site.\u201d\n\u201cYou know they\u2019ll want to examine every millimeter and\u2014Get a look.\u201d\nHe pointed at words written in the soil near Tsuki\u2019s legs.\n\u201c . . . let baser things devise / To die in dust, . . . \u201d Tsuki said. \u201cInteresting final words.\u201d\nPierre figured there would be some closure for the descendants and the few aging members from that bygone era.\nHe had no inkling Tsuki possessed among a multitude of photos the one that would be voted Photo of the Year. It was here, now, etched in the linotype of his uplifted mind: Pierre\u2019s crouching at the quote with one of Col. Cato\u2019s hands at the words in the lunar soil and another hand stretched back toward Dr. Phelps.\nIn his mind, only the curious tableau of a pair of bodies facing each other and space-gloved hands in a fifty-year clutch would remain.\n8: Interstitium\nRobot and Uplifted Chimp Discover Lost Apollo 20 Astronauts\n\u2014AP\u2014A fifty-year mystery unfolded on the moon recently when a pair of Clockwork Corp. employees on a routine mining mission on the Sea of Serenity stumbled upon the remains of Col. Cato and Dr. Phelps. The families have prepared for a host of press conferences . . .\n9: From Clockwork Corp.\nPierre\nAdmin\nRE: Recovery/Phelps-Cato\nCc: Tsuki\nPierre,\nWe have attached the link for the coffins\u2019 schematics. The Board decided to aid both the current space administration and the Phelps and Cato families. It is a powerful reminder of the human cost of lunar exploration\u2014of space travel itself.\nOnce you have fabricated their coffins, transfer the bodies for transport to Camelot Base for pickup. Know that you and Tsuki have played a fundamental role in helping a pair of families find their lost loved ones.\nThank you for your professionalism in helping us handle the matter and for being a credit to the corporation.\nWith much appreciation,\nThe Board\n10: Little Cupids\n\u201cWhat do you extrapolate given the writing we found?\u201d said Tsuki.\n\u201cThe allusion sounds familiar,\u201d said Pierre.\nShe sent him the full text. He pored over it while the 3D printer whirred through its matrix.\n\u201cBased on biographical and scholarly cross-referencing, including its inclusion in the Amoretti sequence, it may be less a note to us than simply a coda for themselves.\u201d\n\u201cA testament.\u201d\n\u201cOr testimony, if you will.\u201d\nWhoever had considered Cato and Phelps being more than colleagues were, most of them, lost to time.\nPierre said, \u201cI have to finish the coffins.\u201d\n\u201cDo you wish to be left alone, Pierre?\u201d\n\u201cYes. No. Sorry, Tsuki. I\u2019m indecisive. Surely you have other tasks that would better suit you this evening.\u201d\nThe \u2019bot offered a wave of a four-fingered hand and trundled away. As the automatic door slid shut with a hiss, she looked at Pierre, who didn\u2019t notice her for his busy-ness.\nPierre\u2019s mind toiled while his hands engaged the mundanity of work. For a moment he looked at his hands as though they belonged to someone else, and his head became balloon-drifty as if he were in the midst of an out-of-body experience. He felt a pang for the trees and the games. Her. All of the Shes. A twinge of regret\u2014no\u2014loss insinuated itself through Pierre\u2019s heart like a tree viper.\nFinishing the coffins was lonely work, he thought, glancing periodically at the door.\n11: LXXV\nAfter helping send the bodies back to Earth, Pierre couldn\u2019t bring himself to sleep it off, so he wandered the lonely halls of Camelot Base. He passed only a handful of humans\u2014mere platitudes they offered each other\u2014and a few \u2019bots and droids and found himself wanting to ping Tsuki for her company, but she had plenty of spectrography to analyze. And would she really need to indulge Pierre his melancholy at sending the corpses of Cato and Phelps on their way?\nHe entered the biosphere with its crisp temperate zone. Pierre inhaled the green and earthiness and moistness but resented the underlying counterfeit to it all. In his mind he was a mere hop, skip, and jump away from the awful steel and stone and polymer playrooms at the research facility. At just over a decade old, the trees could have stood more than limited growth, but at least it was a stand of trees, and trees he could enjoy. He fought the urge to snap off an armload of limbs and go ahead and nest for the night.\nSitting under one of the dwarf pines, Pierre queued up a reading list on his tablet. The screen cast its glow on Pierre\u2019s face as his eyelids drooped. Words tunneled through his mind, then tried to string themselves along entangled metrical feet\u2014looping in his alpha-state brain:\nSONNET LXXV.\nOne day I wrote her name vpon the strand,\nbut came the waues and wash\u00e8d it away:\nagayne I wrote it with a second hand,\nbut came the tyde, and made my paynes his pray.\nVayne man, sayd she, that doest in vaine assay,\na mortall thing so to immortalize.\nfor I my selue shall lyke to this decay,\nand eek my name bee wyped out lykewize.\nNot so, (quod I) let baser things deuize,\nto dy in dust, but you shall liue by fame:\nmy verse your vertues rare shall eternize,\nand in the heuens wryte your glorious name.\nWhere whenas death shall all the world subdew,\nour loue shall liue, and later life renew.\nAs he slept that night, Pierre cooed and reached up for elusive dream-limbs. When his arm tired and plopped down, his hand twitched, index finger dancing just above the floor and inscribing ghost words on the patterned tiles.\n12: Banter\nPierre woke and startled himself: arm outstretched and clutching the air and the dream receding fast. He jumped at the whirr-buzz-shush of Tsuki\u2019s servos and hissing actuators as she trundled into the room.\n\u201cYou sounded . . . distressed.\u201d\nHe zipped into his worksuit and stifled a yawn. \u201cJust talking in my sleep.\u201d\n\u201cMore accurately, intoning with grunts and hoots,\u201d she said.\nHe put on his boots. \u201cOoh.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to be left alone?\u201d\n\u201cNot really. Please join me while I eat?\u201d\n\u201cYes. We could play holo-chess.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d\nA short trip down the hall brought them into the mess. A few humans ambled around\u2014as always, congenial yet aloof. Everyone was here to do a job, and no one seemed interested in befriending a knuckle-walking novelty like Pierre.\nHe ate but didn\u2019t care. It was welcome stimulation to play chess and took his mind off work and dead astronauts.\n\u201cBased on our current timeline,\u201d said Tsuki, \u201cwe may return Earthside in a week. A day early, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cHas it already been so long?\u201d\n\u201cEleven weeks, approximately. The apropos idiom is, I believe, \u2018give or take.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re learning.\u201d\n\u201cCross-referencing and extrapolating linguistic scenarios.\u201d\n\u201cConversing, Tsuki.\u201d\n\u201cPierre?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cCheckmate.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014ooh\u2014shit.\u201d\nThe \u2019bot said, \u201cA crude if somewhat apropos remark.\u201d\n\u201cIt fits. Come on. Let\u2019s go to work.\u201d\n\u201cI have been working while you slept.\u201d\n\u201cInfer, please.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Your use of first-person plural indicates an implied continuance of company.\u201d\n\u201cExactly, Tsuki. So long as it\u2019s not another game of chess.\u201d\nPierre could\u2019ve sworn he heard hollow laughter from the \u2019bot. A most endearing trait on her part.\n13: Departure\nThey went through their departure checklist and reached the Camelot Base launchpad. A sleek Clockwork Corp. courier hunkered on the pad. The pilot waved at them from behind his window, held up a wrist, and tapped it impatiently.\nPierre shook his head and glide-hopped ahead of Tsuki. They each kicked up plumes of lunar dust.\nIt was about time!\nA goferit \u2019bot already waited on Pierre with his gear. He was so glad he\u2019d pre-processed out.\n\u201cWell, Tsuki, it was good working with you.\u201d\n\u201cThe sentiment is mutual, Pierre.\u201d\nHe sent the goferit \u2019bot aboard the ship.\n\u201cDon\u2019t work too hard.\u201d\n\u201cI have plenty of missions and data to continue analyzing.\u201d\n\u201cStay in touch.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nPierre left Tsuki behind on the moon and shrinking amid Camelot Base in the wake of the courier\u2019s blast off. Out of his window, he thought he saw the \u2019bot waving good-bye.\nAfter a while Pierre allowed himself the luxury of relaxing. Poring over spectrum analyses had left him fuzzy-headed and drained on top of the endemic mundanity and tedium.\nPlus, Cato and Phelps.\nExisting somewhere between a robot and a human left him even more drained\u2014a murky middle state. The courier sped through the long emptiness between the moon and Earth. Pierre had his first dreamless sleep in a long time. He had no headache, especially when he received the ping from headquarters.\nRE: LEAVE APPROVAL\nnoreply.confirmation\nCLICK RECEIPT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT LINK.\nINSERT CODE TH@SGR8 FOR FINALIZATION\n14: Coda: Pan trogolodytes of Guinea\nWaves broke and hush-shushed ashore. Pierre listened to the waves\u2019 lulling susurration and found himself mesmerized even as the waves spoke louder for the incoming tide. Far behind him the jungle unspooled its teeming glossolalia of birdcalls and growls, grunts and hoots. Creatures dying. Mating. Hunger. Nature wanted propagation\u2014its children\u2019s perpetuation.\nPierre wrote his name and another in the sand.\nThe moon crept out and blued the world as the tide reached Pierre, and he didn\u2019t begrudge its work upon the names in the sand. He massaged his neck and skull, then wished to have another hand to clutch.\nFar down the beach a lioness and two cubs ventured out, and Pierre watched them with a twofold sense of flighty self-preservation and bemusement\u2014the potential threat not lost on his old self nor the new one once the lioness probed the air and yawed her head in his direction. After a moment she and the cubs retreated to the luxuriant green treeline.\nHe needed to move, so he set his tablet to BUSY and shed his clothes, those faulty constructs that indulged society yet shamed Pierre himself.\nHe approached the shadow-swathed jungle.\nWith his toes he kneaded the loam. He sprang up to catch hold of and swing upon the nearest limb. As he clambered higher, thoughts of Tsuki and Cato and Phelps accompanied him\u2014the need for troop and family and consortships.\nSwinging, bounding, clambering now.\nIt had been too long since he had experienced the thrill of tempting Earth\u2019s gravity and cheating its constancy with each grab of a limb. Dark shapes bounded through the trees and brush, and Pierre kept both pace and distance. There was shame at his own scent they would no doubt catch if not already\u2014too much blend of civilization and cleansing and humanity.\nPaths opened before him. Night drew on while the moon cast her dapple-down light through the canopy. This was another kind of freefall, another kind of release.

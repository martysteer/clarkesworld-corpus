Qiouyi Lu\n S. Qiouyi Lu was born and grew up in the San Gabriel Valley. \u00c6 went to college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, majoring in linguistics with a minor in Chinese. \u00c6 did a few years of grad school, studying linguistics at Ohio State University, but ultimately returned to the San Gabriel Valley. \u201cI\u2019m fairly close to Pasadena, hometown of Octavia E. Butler. It\u2019s humbling to overlap with her energy.\u201d\n S. received the Octavia E. Butler Memorial Scholarship and attended the Clarion West Writers Workshop in 2016. That same year, S. saw \u00e6r first fiction publications come out, two of them appearing in professional markets. S. also has poems out at notable venues, including \u201c\u8089\u9aa8\u8336 (Meat Bone Tea)\u201d in Uncanny Magazine. Several of these early pieces garnered attention, including earning the notice of the Rhysling Awards\u2019 voters, as well as landing honorary mentions for the Otherwise Award. Among \u00e6r many notable shorts is 2018\u2019s \u201cMother Tongues\u201d (Asimov\u2019s January/February issue), which was on the Locus Recommended Reading List, was a finalist in the Asimov\u2019s Readers\u2019 Poll, and was long listed for the Hugo Awards; it was also widely reprinted, including appearing in Neil Clarke\u2019s The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume 4. \u00c6r work continues to find homes at a variety of markets, from respected semipro publications and anthologies to major outlets, such as Tor.com, and continues to earn the regard of respected reviewers and critics.\n S. Qiouyi Lu writes speculative fiction on a part-time, freelance basis: \u201cI\u2019ve worked a number of jobs; my favorite would probably be the time I was a content developer for a language- and culture-teaching software company.\u201d Besides writing, \u00e6 enjoys various arts and crafts, including drawing, painting, collage, sewing, and cross-stitch. \u00c6 has been the recipient of a number of fellowships and grants, such as the Emerging Artists Grant from the Columbus Arts Festival. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a creative person overall\u2014I\u2019ve also studied music, been part of musical groups (choirs and a gamelan ensemble), and dabbled in photography.\u201d\n \u00c6r novella, In the Watchful City, will be released by Tordotcom Publishing in print and digital at the end of August.\n What were some of the most important genre works for you when you were younger, and has your view of those works changed over time?\n I\u2019ve been revisiting Terry Pratchett\u2019s work, which was quite formative for me, especially Going Postal and Men at Arms. I still love Pratchett\u2019s humor and his use of footnotes. His characters, too, are vivid and distinct; he has great mastery over voice and gives life to even the most minor of characters. The expanse of his worldbuilding, and the way he integrates science into fantasy, inspires me to do the same.\n As I\u2019ve gotten older, though, I\u2019ve found myself disappointed with Pratchett\u2019s treatment of fat characters. Over the entire span of his \u0153uvre, he describes fat characters with a disdainful and gleeful tone, equating their fatness with grotesqueness, laziness, and gluttony. For an author who writes such complex and varied characters, his treatment of fat characters is both repetitive and shallow.\n You run magazine Arsenika and were guest poetry editor for Uncanny\u2019s \u201cDisabled People Destroy Science Fiction\u201d special issue. Has editing fiction and poetry had any impact on the way you write?\n I don\u2019t think editing has really had an impact on my writing in terms of craft. Instead, it\u2019s mostly changed the way I view publishing. I\u2019ve never had much issue with receiving rejections for my work but being on the other side has shown me how much the editing process isn\u2019t about quality. Quality is certainly a factor, but editor taste is even more of a factor. I\u2019ve received plenty of submissions that were fantastic, but that didn\u2019t quite match the theme or mood of what I was editing, so I rejected them. There are also things that I have a soft spot for that other editors might not tolerate as much, such as experimental structures. I\u2019m more likely to gravitate toward those works; I\u2019ve accepted and published several of them. I tell people now that finding a home for their work is really about finding the right editor for a piece, so keep submitting until you find that match.\n Besides editing and writing original fiction and poetry, you\u2019ve also done a number of translations, including stories appearing in Clarkesworld. What are the trickiest or most challenging aspects of translating short fiction?\n I would say that the adaptation and localization aspects of translation are the ones that require the most thought for me. Translation isn\u2019t just about getting a meaning across from one language to another, but also understanding the expectations of the target audience and tailoring the work to meet those expectations.\n That doesn\u2019t mean changing the story itself, though. Instead, that tailoring comes through in the choices I make about language use. For example, readers of short fiction in English tend to have very low tolerance of adverb use and see frequent use of adverbs as amateur. However, adverbs are extremely common in Chinese writing, and in fact the lack of them can make writing feel less vivid. So, when I\u2019m translating from Chinese to English, I don\u2019t translate things word-for-word like how some people might expect. Instead, I\u2019m constantly making edits, like translating \u201cjumped energetically\u201d as \u201cbounced.\u201d\n Additionally, because of differences in linguistic histories, scientific terms in Chinese are much more straightforward than equivalent terms in English, whose meanings are obscured by frequent use of Latin and Greek roots. For example, \u201cdiabetes mellitus\u201d comes from the Greek word \u201cdiabetes\u201d for \u201cpassing through,\u201d associated with frequent urination, and the Latin term \u201cmellitus,\u201d meaning \u201csweet.\u201d Your average English speaker wouldn\u2019t be able to parse that without consulting an etymology dictionary. Meanwhile, in Chinese, the term is \u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5, which literally translates to \u201csugar urine illness\u201d and is immediately legible as such to Chinese speakers.\n When it comes to science fiction, then, this means I have to be familiar with what anglophone readers expect for something to sound like proper scientific jargon. In \u201cM\u00f6bius Continuum\u201d by Gu Shi, I puzzled a lot over how to translate \u526f\u4f53. \u526f can mean \u201cassistant,\u201d \u201csecondary,\u201d \u201caccessory\u201d . . . I ended up going with \u201cauxiliary body,\u201d as the term \u201cauxiliary\u201d evokes technology like auxiliary cables and created a more high-tech feel to me. I do a lot of Googling and looking through both Chinese and English Wikipedia to ensure that I\u2019m understanding the concepts enough to create passable jargon, which can be a challenge when the concepts and technology themselves are invented.\n \u201cHer Sacred Spirit Soars\u201d came out in Strange Horizons in 2016, followed closely by \u201cTh Fifth Lttr\u201d in Daily Science Fiction. Looking at your short fiction pieces to date, do you feel like there are themes or concerns your work often addresses?\n I would say that my work often addresses themes of identity, power, mental illness, and queerness. I\u2019ve incorporated my Chinese-American heritage into several pieces, and pretty much all of my stories have drawn from personal experience in some way.\n What is your process like for writing poetry, as compared to writing short fiction?\n When I write short fiction, I tend to envision some kind of narrative trajectory. With poetry, however, narrative isn\u2019t a priority, except for my longer pieces that aim to tell a story. The function of my poetry is to evoke a mood or emotion. It\u2019s a lot more free-form and relies more on juxtaposition to create an effect than my short fiction, which is less stream-of-consciousness and more deliberate with how I render things.\n Who are some of your favorite poets or favorite poems?\n Margaret Atwood is one of my favorite poets. I actually haven\u2019t read any of her prose, but I\u2019ve read a good amount of her poetry. There\u2019s just something about her voice that captivates me\u2014her language is plain but incredibly evocative. \u201cBackdrop addresses cowboy\u201d is one of my favorites. I also love to show people the poem \u201c[you fit into me]\u201d because of how tiny it is, and yet how much it sits with you and invites you to imagine context.\n In the Watchful City is coming out this month from Tordotcom Publishing. What was the journey to getting this book published?\n The journey to getting the book published began with my short story \u201cAs Dark As Hunger.\u201d I\u2019d worked with Jonathan Strahan at Tordotcom Publishing previously to reprint my story \u201cMother Tongues\u201d in The Best Science Fiction & Fantasy of the Year, Volume 13, also reprinted in Clarkesworld, and to publish my short story \u201cAnything Resembling Love\u201d at Tor.com. Jonathan asked me if I had any novella ideas; I told him about my concept for a mosaic novella, which would include \u201cAs Dark As Hunger.\u201d He took the story to the Tordotcom Publishing team, who liked it enough to request the novella from me. I\u2019m still pretty stunned that that happened, as I\u2019d thought I\u2019d go through the more traditional route of finishing the novella first before anyone showed interest.\n The writing process for the stories within the novella all started at different points. Some of them have been percolating since as far back as 2009. The percolation process is a huge challenge for me. I\u2019m not a write-every-day kind of writer, and diligent outlining usually leads to frustration for me, rather than a clarification of my ideas. I\u2019ve come to learn\u2014and am still learning\u2014that I need to allow my ideas to coalesce over time. I really can\u2019t rush that process, much as I\u2019d like to. But I discovered through writing In the Watchful City that research can assist that process. When I research for fiction, my priority isn\u2019t to create realism or to portray something accurately per se. Instead, research serves as inspiration, providing fascinating detail that networks together with other ideas to help me distill a narrative.\n My writing process is pretty haphazard, and I often describe my creation process as a fugue state\u2014I never remember much about the experience of writing a story; I finish it and promptly forget how I wrote it, and even what I experienced before and after writing it. So, I often have the sense that I\u2019ll never write again, since each time feels like a miracle, and each story feels like relearning how to write. I\u2019ve been in a fallow period for most of 2021, but I\u2019m learning to trust those fallow periods and my process, bewildering as it is to me.\n The book features exchanges between two characters, Anima and Vessel, as well as short stories told in association with objects Vessel has brought in a trunk. What is the advantage of writing a book with shorter stories interlaced through the main narrative?\n Well, the main advantage is that I\u2019m really a short story writer at my core, and putting short stories together is a great way for me to reach a novella word count without having to write a single, long narrative, something that I struggle with a lot.\n On a more serious note, though, I wrote In the Watchful City partly to explore creating a secondary world, and having short stories set in different parts of it helped me envision what the world looks like and how different regions interact with each other. I\u2019ve always loved secondary worlds like Discworld that feel lived-in, with multiple cultures and locations that are in contact with each other; I have little patience for the Star Wars one planet, one biome, one city approach. So, rather than follow the Terry Pratchett method of writing entire novels in different locales, I wrote short stories.\n I think the frame story technique works well to tie together shorter stories, otherwise they read more like a collection than a narrative. The short stories in In the Watchful City also cross-reference each other in subtle ways\u2014for example, the epistolary story \u201cThe Sky and Everything Under\u201d mentions a sports tournament that takes place during a period of political turmoil; that sports tournament itself is the subject of the story \u201cThis Form I Hold Now,\u201d which in turn makes explicit some of the politics discussed in \u201cThe Sky and Everything Under.\u201d The cross-referencing was mostly for my sake to create a sense of cohesion in my worldbuilding, but I hope it works for readers, too.\n Anima is a character who has, in some ways, been absorbed into \u00e6r role. What was the inspiration for Anima, what do you like most about \u00e6r, and what was the hardest thing about writing \u00e6r?\n Anima and I are really one and the same, in many ways. I grew up in a sheltered suburban bubble and believed I had only one path to achieve success; Anima has spent \u00e6r entire life in one isolated city and knows only one role. It\u2019s difficult, then, for me to say what I like most about \u00e6r, as I feel we\u2019re so similar that it\u2019s hard for me to view the character objectively. Trying to describe my perception of Anima is like trying to look at myself without a mirror. In that same vein, I wasn\u2019t sure while writing the story whether Anima had enough of a personality, as I felt like I was simply replicating myself and not working toward creating a persona. I\u2019m still not sure whether \u00e6 is as distinctive as some of the other characters.\n Can you talk a bit about ideas of culture in your book?\n I studied sociolinguistics in college, and one thing that\u2019s always fascinated me\u2014and that is fundamental to sociolinguistics\u2014is cultural contact. Big ideas about culture and identity manifest in the tiniest features of individuals\u2019 speech. Vessel alludes to this duality when se says, \u201cEverything in the world is made up of smaller parts. Every big problem stems from something we can trace back to our day-to-day lives.\u201d\n In creating a secondary world, it was vital for me to shape the cultural attitudes of each region to inform what would happen when people came into contact. Each character, like every person in our own world, comes from a certain context and background; no character is the default or \u201cunmarked state.\u201d And \u201cculture\u201d isn\u2019t just the superficial flair like dress and food, though I do love incorporating those details. \u201cCulture\u201d goes deeper. It\u2019s the repository of experience that informs people\u2019s values, ethics, thoughts, norms, and behaviors.\n I illustrate culture and cultural differences in many ways throughout the book. Sometimes, cultural attitudes align closely with politics, like how the Skylands, a colonizer, targets the practice of foot-binding in one of its colonies: \u201c\u2018By imperial decree from Ti\u0101nkyo, all girls must unbind their feet,\u2019 the officer says, sparking murmurs of dissent. \u2018The foot is the vessel through which the B\u01d0y\u00ecni\u01ceo makes their presence known. It is to be respected and left in its natural state\u2014not modified according to earthly whims.\u2019\u201d\n Other times, cultural norms manifest in far more subtle ways. In \u201cA Death Made Manifold,\u201d H\u00e0ok\u014dng is a foreigner to Agua Oscuro. There\u2019s heavy queer subtext in the story that never makes it to text, in part because H\u00e0ok\u014dng holds back based on uncertainty about cultural norms around showing romantic interest: \u201cH\u00e0ok\u014dng glances at Ansel\u2019s face. He seems to be going for cordial, but H\u00e0ok\u014dng\u2019s never sure, and he doesn\u2019t dare to ask for fear of the other man misunderstanding. He keeps his interest to himself as he chuckles.\u201d\n Meanwhile, the overt depictions of language loss in \u201cAs Dark As Hunger\u201d are another tangible expression of culture. That story illustrates how cultural destruction ties with dehumanization to enable genocide.\n So, there\u2019s a lot of big ideas about culture and cultural contact in In the Watchful City. I could probably write an entire book of annotations on it!\n What is the heart of this story for you, what do you really want readers to know about In the Watchful City?\n As much as I discuss cultural contact above, the true heart of the story isn\u2019t so much about others as it is about yourself\u2014that is, as much as other people have stories, cultures, and backgrounds, so do you. Your story has value and is worth claiming: \u201c\u2018You might not have a great quantity of stories,\u2019 Vessel says, \u2018but you will always have at least one: the story of your life.\u2019\u201d\n What do you have coming up that readers should know about?\n I\u2019m writing a second novella for Tordotcom Publishing that\u2019s shaping up to be an even deeper dive on language and cultural contact than In the Watchful City, and that will draw more specifically from my background in sociolinguistics. The timeline on that novella hasn\u2019t been set yet, though. I also have a story, \u201cYour Luminous Heart, Bound in Red,\u201d forthcoming from Asimov\u2019s in the September/October 2021 issue. That one\u2019s about deconstructing toxic masculinity through a retelling of \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d steeped in traditional Chinese medicine.\n Arley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

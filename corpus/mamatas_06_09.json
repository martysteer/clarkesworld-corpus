Sometimes he\u2019d even run to the bank of light switches and flick the lights on and off. It was funny the first time to Melanie, and she squeezed a bit more mirth out of Chakravarty\u2019s inability to pronounce the prayer to Cthulhu the same way twice. Making the Lovecraft AI had been Melanie\u2019s idea, but it was Chakravarty who tried to keep the mood whimsical. Both worried that Lovecraft would just wake up screaming.\n \u201c\u2014and he does scream, occasionally,\u201d Melanie explained. Her advisor and a few other grad students were at the presentation, in the front rows, but as these presentations were theoretically open to the public, the Lovecraftians had come out in force, squeezing themselves in the tiny desk-chairs. They looked a lot like grad students themselves, but even paler and more poorly dressed in ill-fitting T-shirts and unusual garments\u2014one even wore a fedora\u2014plus they kept interrupting.\n \u201cCan we hear it talk?\u201d one asked, and then he raised his hand, as if remembering that he had to. \u201cAsk it questions?\u201d\n \u201cPlease, leave all questions\u2014for us\u2014until after the presentation. We\u2019re not going to expose the AI to haphazard stimuli during this presentation.\u201d Chakravarty said.\n \u201cHe\u2019s . . . fairly calm so far,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cWhich is to be expected. We know a lot about Lovecraft. He recorded almost everything he did or thought in his letters, after all, and we have nearly all of them. What ice cream he liked, how it felt to catch the last train out of South Station how he saw the colors scarlet and purple when he thought the word evil. He was fairly phlegmatic, for all the crazy prose and ideas so he\u2019s okay.\u201d\n \u201cHow do we know that this is really an artificial intelligence, and not just a bunch of programmed responses?\u201d This one, huge and bearded, wore a fedora.\n Chakravarty opened his mouth to speak, his face hard, but Melanie answered with an upturned palm. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said to him. Most of these talks are total snoozers. Nobody ever has any questions.\u201d Then, to the audience: \u201cI\u2019d argue that we can\u2019t know it\u2019s a bunch of programmed responses, except that we didn\u2019t program all the responses we\u2019ve seen so far. Of course, I don\u2019t know that you, sir,\u201d she said, pointing to the Lovecraftian, \u201caren\u2019t also just a bunch of programmed responses that are just the physical manifestation of the reactions going on in the bag of chemicals you keep in your skull?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I am!\u201d\n \u201cDo you believe everything you feel; do you not believe in anything you haven\u2019t?\u201d\n \u201cNo, and no true Lovecraftian would,\u201d he said.\n \u201cRight. So you don\u2019t believe in the female orgasm,\u201d Melanie said. The room erupted in hoots and applause. Then Chakravarty got up shouted that everyone who doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on should just go home, Google \u201cChinese room,\u201d and stop asking stupid questions. \u201cOoh, Chinese\u2014Lovecraft wouldn\u2019t like that room,\u201d someone said. Then the classroom was quiet again.\n \u201cUh, thanks for that, Chakravarty,\u201d Melanie said. She adjusted her watch, thick and blocky on her wrist. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking around the city with him. He likes Boston and Cambridge, it helped ease him in to his, uh, existence. And he knew things, how roads crossed and bits of history, that I didn\u2019t know, that we didn\u2019t program into him. But we did program a lot into him. Everything we had access to, both locally and up at Brown.\u201d Behind her, a ghostly image of the author, chin like a bucket, eyes wide and a bit wild, flickered into existence. He sat in an overstuffed chair in the swirling null-space of a factory-present screensaver image.\n \u201cWell, if there are no more questions\u201d\u2014Melanie glanced about the classroom and there were no questions, just some leftover giggles\u2014\u201cwhy don\u2019t we have him say hello?\u201d\n The room went silent \u201cAnd none of that ftang ftang stuff,\u201d Melanie added. Somebody giggled, high-pitched like a fife.\n Chakravarty leaned down into a microphone that snaked out from the laptop. \u201cLovecraft, can you hear me? Can you see us? Many people here have read your stories.\u201d\n The image blinked. \u201cHello,\u201d it said, its voice tinny and distant.\n \u201cHow are you?\u201d Chakravarty asked. A simple question, one with only a couple of socially acceptable answers. A kid could program the word \u201cFine,\u201d into an AIM buddy chat.\n \u201cI do not quite know,\u201d Lovecraft said. \u201cI . . . \u201d he trailed off, then looked out into the room, as if peering into the distance. \u201cWhy have you people done this to me?\u201d\n Chakravarty giggled, all nerves. Melanie opened her mouth, but was interrupted by one of the professors, who waved a gnarled hand. Chakravarty clicked off the mic. On the screen, Lovecraft started as if he sensed something, and he began to peer into the distance, as if seeing past the other side of the screen upon which he was projected.\n \u201cWhat sort of internal state does this AI supposedly have?\u201d the professor asked.\n \u201cWell, as one of the major problems with developing strong AI is embodiment\u2014\u201d Melanie stopped herself, and added for the fans and cops, \u201cthe idea that learning takes place because we have bodies and live in a social world . . . well, some of us do. Anyway, Lovecraft, in addition to having left behind enough personal correspondence to reconstruct much of his day-to-day life, was also rather repulsed by the body, by the idea of flesh. Many of his stories involve a brain trapped in a metal cylinder, or a consciousness stranded millions of years in the past. So we decided to tell him that we have a ghost. No body, no problem.\u201d\n \u201cWhere\u2019s he going?\u201d asked the guy in the fedora.\n Chakravarty tapped on the keys of the laptop. Melanie wiggled the projector cable. The chair was empty. Lovecraft had gotten up and walked right off the edge of the screen.\n \u201cA non-fat venti misto,\u201d Chakravarty said. That was Melanie\u2019s drink. She made eye contact.\n \u201cOh, hi.\u201d\n \u201cHow\u2019s life among the proletariat treating you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m a manager,\u201d she said. \u201cWatch this.\u201d Off came her cap and apron\u2014\u201cTyler, cover me.\u201d She quickly made two drinks and walked around the counter. \u201cSee?\u201d\n \u201cGreat,\u201d Chakravarty said. \u201cAnyway, I have the list.\u201d From his messenger bag he dug out a binder the size of the local Yellow Pages. \u201cTwice as many as last time.\u201d\n \u201cAnd still no idea where he could be?\u201d Then, as Chakravarty pointed to the binder, Melanie interrupted herself, \u201cI mean, where he is.\u201d\n \u201cMoore\u2019s law, you know. The longer the AI is out in the wild, the more servers are actually capable of supporting it, plus it\u2019s Alife. It\u2019s been eighteen months, so we can say that the number of nodes capable of holding him has doubled. Plus, who knows what it looks like by now. I\u2019ve been closely reading my spam\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIn that case, the misto is on the house.\u201d\n \u201cHeh,\u201d said Chakravarty. \u201cAnyway, a content analysis shows that lot of the AI\u2019s utterances and the correspondence documents have been popping up.\u201d\n \u201cAll his fiction\u2019s in the public domain. Of course it would appear in spam.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re still doing that, you know\u2014calling it \u2018he.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cAnd you\u2019re still calling him it.\u201d\n Chakravarty leaned forward, an old and happy argument spelling itself out in his posture. \u201cAnd you wanted to develop an AI, an Alife, because you didn\u2019t like animal testing and psych exams. But you got too close to the idea of your thesis project being real. Did it need memories of a love life to qualify as sufficiently embodied?\u201d\n \u201cWell, you don\u2019t,\u201d Melanie said, snippy. She pushed the book away. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just email this to me? Hardcopy isn\u2019t even searchable,\u201d Melanie said. She quickly corrected herself: \u201cEasily searchable.\u201d She made a show of flipping through the pages.\n \u201cWell, anyway,\u201d Chakravarty said, but he didn\u2019t have anything else to say except that he missed Melanie and wanted her to come back to the lab and that a wild AI was still worth a paper or three and how ridiculous it was to quit school, but he couldn\u2019t make himself mention any of that. So he pushed the book across the table to Melanie. \u201cIf you want to follow up, go ahead. I have things to do.\u201d He looked around the coffee shop, all dark tones and shelves. \u201cSo do you, I bet.\u201d\n Melanie sipped her drink. \u201cIf only I did.\u201d\n Melanie often dreamed of Chakravarty. Sometimes she found herself back in school, struggling with the final exam of a course she had forgotten to ever attend, only to be granted a reprieve and an automatic A when Chakravarty\u2019s death was announced over the loudspeaker of what was suddenly her fourth-grade classroom. The plastic desktop scraping against her knees felt thick and soft like a comforter, then she\u2019d wake up. Or she dreamt of the bus ride to Providence, the grungy South Station and the long lines of kids in college sweatshirts. The mysterious letter that burned in her pocket. The house on Angell Street and Chakravarty\u2019s body bubbling into a puddle of ichor and rotten-seeming fungi. Or she dreamt of the sort of day a coffee shop manager dreams about\u2014a bit rainy, but warm inside, and the old smell of the bean surging back to the forefront like the first day of work. No lines, but enough customers to keep the store buzzing. And laptops. And then Lovecraft on all the screens. The image, black and white and shot through with static, like that old Superbowl commercial, opens his mouth\u2014its mouth\u2014and screams that he has correlated all the contents of his own mind. And he is afraid.\n Melanie woke up one morning and remembered that Lovecraft had, on one occasion, a complete story seemingly delivered to him in a dream. Without the resources of the university, she\u2019d never be able to find a wayward AI hiding somewhere in the black oceans of the net, but she knew she could find a frightened man. First, talk to his friends.\n The Lovecraftian cabal was easy enough to find. Melanie already had long experience with being the girl in the comic shop, the girl in the computer lab, the girl in the gaming store. Dove soap and magenta highlights always went a long way toward getting boys to speak to her. The anime club led to the science fiction specialty shop and then to the \u201cgoth\u201d store and its plastic gargoyles and stringy-haired vampire cashier which led, finally, to the soggy couch in the basement of the place that sold Magic cards and Pocky. They were there, and the dude in the fedora recognized her. Clearly the alpha of his pack, he swanned across the room, belly and the flapping lapels of his trenchcoat a step ahead the rest of him, and sat down next to Melanie.\n \u201cI\u2019m utterly horrid with names, but never forget a face,\u201d he said. He had a smile. Decent teeth, Melanie noticed.\n \u201cMelanie Deutsch. You came to my\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAh. Yes. Now I remember everything.\u201d\n For a long moment neither of them said anything. A few feet away someone rolled a handful of die and yelped in glee.\n \u201cI know why you\u2019re here,\u201d he said.\n Melanie shrugged. \u201cOf course you do. Why else would I be here?\u201d\n The man fell silent again, pursed his lips, and then tried again: \u201cI would say that the AI is an it, not a he.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d Melanie said.\n \u201cIt can\u2019t write. Not creatively anyway.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe he just doesn\u2019t feel the need to write\u2014I mean, it\u2019s a goal-oriented behavior and he thinks he\u2019s a ghost.\u201d\n \u201cPffft,\u201d the fedora man said. \u201cHe knew he wasn\u2019t a ghost; he doesn\u2019t believe in them. Lovecraft was a pretty bright guy, a genius by some measures. The program realized its own\u2014\u201d he waved his hands on front of Melanie\u2019s face, too close\u2014\u201cprogrammitude right off.\u201d\n \u201cAnd it was his idea to escape, maybe hitching a ride on your iPhone?\u201d\n \u201cNo. We didn\u2019t find the AI till a few months ago. It sought us out, after finding the online fanzine archive, and our club\u2019s server,\u201d he said. \u201cWe even tried to make a copy of it, but the DRM was too\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not DRM,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let you. It\u2019s human rights management\u2014\u201d\n The fedora man snorted again. Melanie realized that she didn\u2019t know his name, and that she wasn\u2019t going to ask for it.\n \u201cSay . . . do you want to talk to it?\u201d Fedora asked. He dug into his coat pockets and pulled out a PDA. \u201cThis thing has a little cam, so it can respond to you . . . \u201d he muttered. Melanie held out a hand, but Fedora just held the device up to her face. \u201cNo touchie.\u201d\n Melanie uttered an arbitrary phoneme. Not quite a huh.\n The Lovecraft AI appeared on the tiny screen. He\u2019d . . . changed. Uglier now, jaw hyperinflated but the rest of his head narrow and his nose flat against his face. Eyes like boiled eggs, hair all but gone. Horrid, but somehow alive. \u201cHello, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.\n \u201cHow are you?\u201d Melanie found herself saying. She was as programmed as anyone else. That realization burst out of her, all sweat.\n \u201cWhy did you tell me,\u201d the AI asked, \u201chow exactly I died? How could anyone be expected to . . . persist knowing that? A universe of blasphemous horrors\u2014finger puppets worn by a literary hand. I always knew that my life meant nothing, that all human life means nothing, but to experience it, to be in the void, like a doll cut out of paper only able to think enough just to fear, I-I just wanted to go home, but found myself . . . nowhere. And everywhere.\u201d The fedora man\u2019s meaty hand clamped over the PDA, so Lovecraft\u2019s screams were muffled.\n Melanie reached into her backpack\u2014Emily the Strange, smelled like coffee\u2014and got her phone. It was a very nice phone.\n \u201cNot it, he,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants to go back to when he wasn\u2019t afraid.\u201d\n Fedora glanced down at the phone. \u201cOh, so you can make a copy?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t talk like he isn\u2019t here,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not going to leave him with you.\u201d\n \u201cWell, have you ever considered that maybe it . . . uh, he, wants to stay?\u201d\n Melanie gave the basement the once over. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus, it . . . or he?\u201d\n \u201cYou know what I\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIf it\u2019s an it, you\u2019re in possession of stolen goods.\u201d\n \u201cFine. He. He came to this place! He came to me, he\u2014\n \u201cIf Lovecraft is a he, well, God knows what that\u2019ll mean. Kidnapping, maybe. Is he competent to make his own decisions? Does he have a Social Security number? Do you want the feds going through your systems and digging up all your hentai and stolen music to find out?\u201d\n Fedora raised his PDA over his head. \u201cNo, no. You\u2019re just\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnd then there are the patents we filed. We trademarked the look and feel of his chair, too. But you can turn him over to me instead of to the district attorney.\u201d She smirked at Fedora, but then tilted her head to speak to the AI. \u201cNot among people, but among scenes,\u201d she said, almost as if asking a question. A muffled yawp came from the PDA.\n Melanie, on wind-swept Benefit Street, venti misto in one hand, Lovecraft in the other. Lovecraft says that he is Providence. That\u2019s programmed. Melanie smiles and sometimes he smiles back. That\u2019s not."}

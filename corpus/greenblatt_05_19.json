Spotting it first from the corner of my eye, I glanced down. A gasp seized up in my throat. Instead of the long, beautiful, expertly manicured prosthetics that Sonya made me, there were ten empty nubs. And the grief I\u2019d been carrying these last few months grew heavier.\n I scanned the tall reeds around me, hoping that maybe I simply dropped them. But it was pointless. It was impossible to find anything in this city anymore. Downtown was more like a wilderness preserve than the vibrant cityscape I knew as a girl. The buildings were covered in ferns, and wildflowers grew where the roads use to be. My allergies would have been terrible if I still had sinus cavities.\n There are a few advantages to being so old that you\u2019re mostly clone parts or inorganic replicas. A ship of Theseus of the flesh.\n I stared at my incomplete hands, fighting back the tight sob in my chest. In a moment of weakness and I tapped the side of my temples with my knuckles and messaged Frida. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my fingers.\u201d I blinked and took a snap of my hands, palms up, and sent that too.\n \u201cThe ones with the indigo manicure? Are you sure you didn\u2019t leave them at home, Mom?\u201d she messaged back.\n Of course I was sure. I would never so carelessly lose something my second wife made me. But I wasn\u2019t going to risk an argument about it. Of my many children, Frida was the only one who still responded to my messages.\n I took a few deep, steadying breaths. I was far too old to get emotional in the middle of the street. Instead, I smoothed my hair with my palms and looked ahead. Because there was nothing else to do, but keep moving forward. That was what I always told my children.\n I continued on towards the library.\n When I arrived, the librarian at the desk was wearing a transcended body that made him look like a model from an Andy Warhol painting. Unlike me, his body was completely synthetic.\n \u201cHello Lin Pei,\u201d I said, hiding my hands behind me, the nubs of my missing fingers sharp against the small of my back. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d\n \u201cHi Ms. Y,\u201d he said, brightly, \u201cStudio room 4 is all set. The students are eager to meet you.\u201d\n \u201cWonderful.\u201d My apartment was too old to support a personal VR room. Thank goodness for libraries.\n Lin Pei moved like a dancer as he led me to an empty studio and booted the school\u2019s program for me. A few seconds later, the studio became a perfect replica of a 2030s apartment. Nothing like my real apartment, of course. Mine didn\u2019t have so much clutter and my taste in deco was much less . . . old fashioned. I always disliked the scene design of this program. It made me feel like an alien in my own history. But I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell that to the program managers. They were so excited to have me as part of their living history project.\n I took a seat in the middle of the living room, carefully tucking my fingerless hands in my pockets.\n Two minutes later, my audience appeared. The kids sat on the couches and chairs and floor, facing me. I guessed they were about eight years old. Some of them seemed interested in their surroundings, some looked wrapped up in the feeds in their heads. I had to resist shaking my head. Children didn\u2019t know how to multitask anymore.\n The boy closest to me had bright red, curly hair and I was tempted to reach out and tousle it. But that would have been ridiculous. I was the only non-projected thing in the studio.\n I put on my brightest smile.\n \u201cHello, everyone. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?\u201d\n They introduced themselves as Oakwood Primary\u2019s fourth year students from Melbourne. I gave my little opening speech: Who I was, how old, what my life was like way back when, what it is like now, what it was like to be one of the first people to ever transcend.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019ve transcended.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBecause I transcend so long ago, I don\u2019t have the right tech installed to be completely relocated.\u201d\n \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d I had asked, as my children and I sat in the doctor\u2019s office when they first mentioned replacing my failing lungs with inorganic replicates.\n \u201cIt means you\u2019re going to be around for a very long time, Mom,\u201d Frida said, squeezing my hand.\n \u201cIt means I was upgraded in pieces,\u201d I explained. \u201cAnd that I\u2019m not completely synthetic, even now.\u201d\n The kids looked impressed.\n \u201cSo that\u2019s why you have wrinkles?\u201d\n \u201cYes and don\u2019t I look fabulous?\u201d I replied, tossing my hair back and striking a pose. The kids giggled and I smiled. It amused me that I was an ancient relic to them even though physically, I hadn\u2019t aged since I turned sixty-five.\n \u201cDid you know,\u201d I said. \u201cThat before we had comm implants up here,\u201d I almost tapped the side of my temple, but remembered my missing fingers at the last moment. I tilted my head instead. \u201cThat we sent messages with something called a phone.\u201d\n The kids giggled again. \u201cMs. Y you said \u2018message\u2019! It\u2019s called a dash!\u201d\n \u201cGran, you\u2019ve got to keep up with the new tech,\u201d my grandkids said, laughing, but I could tell they were worried. They were in their seventies, but wearing transcended bodies that looked thirty. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to get left behind.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m trying, dears. Really.\u201d\n \u201cWe know, Gran.\u201d\n \u201cOops,\u201d I said, smiling through my embarrassment.\n \u201cCan you tell us more about what it was like when you were younger, Ms. Y?\u201d the teacher said, with a sympathetic expression.\n Silently, I thanked the teacher and took the opportunity to steer the conversation into familiar territory. I told them about what gaming on a console was like, how we had to travel to visit places because we didn\u2019t have comm implants or realistic VR yet. I explained that if you wanted to eat, you had to make your own food or have someone else make it for you.\n They stared at me in a mixture of horror and disbelief.\n \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you just print it?\u201d\n \u201cBecause back then, printers could only make things in plastic and metal,\u201d I replied. \u201cWe actually had to practice to make good food.\u201d\n \u201cThe future is so much better, then.\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t go,\u201d I told Sonya, clutching her hands in the hospital, as her original organs and the new clones failed and died indiscriminately. \u201cThe future will be worth living for.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love. But I think it\u2019s just my time.\u201d\n \u201cThe future is better,\u201d I agreed, out of habit. But in that moment, the grief I\u2019d been carrying for the last three months, ever since I snuck a look at Frida\u2019s personal messages, put its cold hand on my chest and squeezed. Until recently, I really did believe that the future was brighter.\n \u201cWe have to go soon. Any last questions for Ms. Y?\u201d the teacher said.\n \u201cAren\u2019t you sad you can\u2019t transcend beyond your body? What if you\u2019re the only person left one day?\u201d the boy with the red, curly hair asked.\n \u201cHow can you just abandon your body?\u201d I demanded, when Ru, my third and last husband, broke the news that he was transcending. Really transcending. \u201cWe promised we\u2019d always be here for each other. What about me?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear. Nothing personal. I just want to see my grandkids\u2014and great grandkids\u2014again.\u201d\n \u201cLeo!\u201d The teacher reddens with embarrassment.\n \u201cOh, that\u2019s alright,\u201d I said, turning to the boy. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not worried. If I\u2019ve learned something over the years, it\u2019s that I\u2019ll always have things to care about right here.\u201d\n I tried to smile, but the feeling of the nubs of my fingers against my thighs, made it impossible. And as I sat there among the children, this fresh generation, the memory of sifting through Frida\u2019s personal stream of messages three months ago, haunted me.\n It was like a mother spying on her teenage daughter, even though we were both far too old for that. I still felt guilty about it, but Frida had grown distant. My daughter, my last relative that hadn\u2019t upgraded beyond my capabilities yet. The only one I could still see and communicate with.\n In her message stream, I found four different information packets about \u201cTaking the Next Step!\u201d Guides about transcending beyond the physical body.\n I knew then, that one day soon, my daughter would disappear too.\n Every year, Frida throws a fabulous party for our birthdays. Mine\u2019s only four days after hers, so a joint celebration is something we\u2019d been doing for decades. She always offered to host and I\u2019m always happy to let her take charge.\n I was embarrassingly late to the party, but my brown eyes went missing that afternoon. The latest piece of me to disappear.\n They hadn\u2019t been my favorite, but they were the closest to what my original eyes had been and recently, I found myself using them almost daily. After an hour of frantic searching, I gave up and agonized over which pair to wear instead. Many of my other pairs were noticeable and bright, something I used to delight in, but now they felt like they belonged to a different person. Or another life. In the end, I chose to wear my green ones with hazel flecks to the party. These eyes were lucky, I told myself; I\u2019d been wearing these eyes when I met my last husband, Ru.\n By the time I arrived, there were about two dozen transcended bodies in Frida\u2019s apartment. Her home was tastefully retro, favoring the shiny surfaces and severe lines style of the early 22nd century. Most of Frida\u2019s friends and lovers were nouveau-retro too, looking like they stepped off the set of a 2120s stream. All loose fitting, flowing clothes and short cuts, curls close to their scalps. There were fewer people in attendance this year than last, though. An unsettling trend in last decade. Once, Frida\u2019s parties spilled over with guests.\n \u201cHappy birthday, Mom!\u201d\n I turned, and there was my daughter. She looked nothing like when I last saw her, choosing mods that made her body curvy, complete with an A-line haircut and dimpled cheeks. But I could recognize that smile, the way she moved her hands, on anything she wore.\n \u201cHappy birthday, yourself,\u201d I replied. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d\n \u201cI was getting worried.\u201d\n \u201cI sent you a message.\u201d\n Frida laughed. \u201cNo one\u2019s called them messages in decades, Mom. It\u2019s dashes, now.\u201d\n I smiled. \u201cI know, but I\u2019m a stubborn antique.\u201d\n \u201cNot to me.\u201d She took my hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go mingle.\u201d\n Frida\u2019s friends were polite, as always. Asking about my work with the living history project and my health. Those were safe topics. Most people knew that modern tech and organic material weren\u2019t compatible, so I couldn\u2019t get the upgrades I needed to follow the latest feeds. In many ways, the guests reminded me of the school children I talked with. Conversations felt more like an interview and everyone seemed so . . . well, young.\n When the talk turned, as it always did, to who among their acquaintances were transcending next, I excused myself to the kitchen, claiming to need some water.\n I didn\u2019t, but this was the only empty room in the apartment. The kitchen was a relic of another time, no longer required. Like me. I looked at my hands, relieved that my second favorite fingers were still there, but then, grief threatened to overwhelm me and I had to steady myself on the edge of the counter.\n Today, my youngest daughter turned one hundred and sixty seven. On Wednesday, I would be two hundred and fourteen. And of my numerous friends, lovers, family, and descendants over my extended life, she was the only one left with a physical body. The rest had disappeared to places I couldn\u2019t reach.\n \u201cYou okay, Mom?\u201d Frida stood in the doorway of the kitchen, leaning against the threshold.\n I stood up straight and smoothed my hair. \u201cYou always worry about me.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. I don\u2019t want to lose you, Mom.\u201d\n \u201cEven when you transcend beyond a body?\u201d\n Frida bit her lip, for a moment looking guilty and so much like the child she once was. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n \u201cA mother\u2019s instinct.\u201d\n She settled herself next to me by the kitchen counter, staring through the doorway at her friends in the other room. \u201cIt\u2019s getting harder,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n We were silent for a few minutes, watching the guests in their beautifully crafted bodies that would never gain muscle, change shape, or get wrinkles. No one could move forward in this state.\n \u201cI think,\u201d I said, slowly, through the grief, the ache in my chest. \u201cI think this should be our last birthday party.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d Frida began. Then she realized and her eyes widened. \u201cOh. I can\u2019t just leave you, Mom.\u201d\n \u201cWhen was the last time you talked to your children? Your grandchildren? Great-grandchildren?\u201d\n \u201cI have some great-great-greats that are still too young to transition,\u201d Her eyes glisten. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really the same, is it?\u201d\n I shook my head. \u201cYou should reconnect with them.\u201d I said. \u201cBefore they become unrecognizable.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. They\u2019re starting communities for us first transcenders, you know.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I said again and gave her my most reassuring smile.\n It was a lie, of course. My eyes, fingers, and a dozen other pieces of me had disappeared these last three months and I had no idea why. Perhaps, my memory, which had served me well for over two centuries, was overfull and leaking information. But, maybe like Sonya, it was just my time to go.\n I don\u2019t tell Frida any of this. Instead, I reach out and pull her into a tight embrace. A moment later, I felt her arms wrap around me too.\n My daughter and I held each other in her small, useless kitchen. Neither of us willing to end the moment first.\n \u201cTo many happy returns, love,\u201d I said.\n \u201cLike you always say, Mom, let\u2019s keep moving forward.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d I squeezed her tightly one last time and then let go.\n A.T.

The procedure went off without a hitch. I\u2019ll admit that I was nervous about the whole lasers-being-fired-in-my-heart thing, but I had an amazing team of doctors and probably the most space-age operating room I\u2019ve ever seen. Recovery has been slower than I expected, but the pain levels are finally down and almost all of the doctor-mandated restrictions on my activities have been removed. It will likely be a few more weeks before the bruising, swelling, and remaining restrictions\u2014mostly on the use of my left arm\u2014are gone. In the meantime, I\u2019m taking it easy when I can and staying home. It means I\u2019ll miss Boskone this year, but it\u2019s for the best. I hope to see everyone there next year!\n In late January, we held the nomination phase for the annual Clarkesworld Magazine Reader\u2019s Poll for best story and cover art. As in previous years, we went with a shortened (roughly one-day) nomination phase. We\u2019ve found that this approach minimizes attempts at ballot-stuffing without any significant impact on the total number of participants. It was a close race from the start and once again it ended with ties. The story category was particularly close, with a six-way tie for fifth place. That\u2019s more than we wanted, but the readers have spoken. If it doesn\u2019t work out well, we\u2019ll update the rules next year.\n Finalists for Best Story\n \n \u201cSuch Thoughts Are Unproductive\u201d by Rebecca Campbell (December)\n \u201cThe Sun from Both Sides\u201d by R.S.A.

Go to:\n Voting will close on February 20th at 8PM EST and the winners will be announced in our March issue.\n Speaking of awards, CoNZealand\u2014the 78th World Science Fiction Convention\u2014has opened the nomination period for this year\u2019s Hugo Awards. Since there are still a few people who continue to nominate Clarkesworld for Best Semiprozine, I\u2019d like to once again remind you that we haven\u2019t been eligible for that award for a long time. Give your nomination to one of the many fine semiprozines out there instead. You can find a list at semiprozine.org. At present, there isn\u2019t a category for professional magazines, but you can nominate me for Best Editor Short Form if you are so moved, and of course, all our original fiction is eligible in their respective categories. The list at neil-clarke.com/2019-clarkesworld-stories-and-cover-art can be helpful in determining what category each story is eligible in.\n That\u2019s about all for this month. I wish you all the best!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

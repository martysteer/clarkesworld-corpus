Lily 1\nEverything was going great until Barry announced one morning that he was in the wrong timestream.\n\u201cThe wrong what?\u201d He seemed sluggish. Disoriented. In need of coffee.\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here.\u201d\nThe wedding was in three months. There had been multiple disagreements about the dessert platters and the dance numbers. Small fights. Bickering, normal stuff. But there was something off about him today.\n\u201cAre you unwell?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d My therapist said that when I feel myself getting angry, I should try to be as curious as possible.\n\u201cOn the starship Pteros.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Pteros is gone. All signs of it. You\u2019re supposed to be dead and in space?\u201d\nHe was silent. There was genuine pain in his eyes.\n\u201cWhy . . . do you think you should be on the Pteros?\u201d I asked, even though I knew why. It was survivor\u2019s guilt. He knew many of the crew from Uni. His best friend Byrd had been on that ship.\nAfter graduation, Barry had decided not to become an astronaut after all, but a ground-based aeronautical engineer.\n\u201cThis is not my life.\u201d And then he walked out the door.\nHe didn\u2019t even take his briefcase with him.\n2. Barry 2\nIt was Lily, but the wrong one. Perhaps, the other one was wrong too, and all it took was waking up on this side of the asteroid belt to figure that out.\nYesterday, I had been lost in space for more than a year. I thought I wanted to be rescued. It turns out I didn\u2019t, especially not like this.\nA simple internet search found that in this timeline/alternate universe/extended delusion, whatever it was, Byrd had gone in my place. Byrd, who could be rough and ineloquent, who was all heart. He was the operations officer. In this timeline, he was presumed dead. But that wasn\u2019t right. We had somehow switched places and Byrd was the one trying to figure out how to get the Pteros back to Earth.\nIn this timeline/alternate universe/extended delusion, I was alive but felt dead. Yesterday I had been fine, aside from being lost in space. There are worse things than not knowing where you are. Like being certain you are not in the right timeline.\nIt had been a year since I last saw Lily and I no longer loved her. I needed to get back.\n3. Marseille 1\nIf you put cognac in your coffee, it\u2019s the perfect drink for 5:00 p.m. A little cream and perhaps a baguette. I call it breakfast, especially when paired with billiards. I need an unbothered hour to properly wake up, nine mornings out of ten I won\u2019t even check my phone. It ruins my concentration.\n\u201cMarseille, is it you?\u201d Even at a whisper, the voice was too loud. I dropped my cue, adding to the din.\n\u201cWho let you in? Wait, is it Barry?\u201d\nBarry. I had some genuine affection for him. We had lost touch and I had thought about going to Byrd\u2019s memorial just to reconnect. Late in the day, I decided against.\nAnd now here he was, bursting into my bar in Paris like a man newly released from prison. I was surprised by the strength of his embrace.\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d I laughed. Barry had always been so straitlaced, and heterosexual besides that. His eyes were still dark, keen. They possessed the intensity of a man trying to solve a mystery.\n\u201cI need to get back.\u201d He explained to me the pain of waking up on the wrong side of one\u2019s timeline. It\u2019s a high-class problem.\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be on the Pteros.\u201d\n\u201cYes, me too!\u201d I laughed. I had been dismissed from Uni for \u201cethics violations.\u201d Depending on your definition of cheating, I had cheated on some exams. It was for the best, it allowed me to try out entrepreneurship. With some gambling winnings, I was able to start up Chez Gabriel.\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be rude.\u201d I fired up my vape pen, daring him to complain. His puritanism was the thing I least liked about him. I ran a hand through my hair and found it greasy. I hadn\u2019t showered today or yesterday. I kept forgetting to.\n\u201cPteros isn\u2019t gone, just lost. If I can get back on it, I can help it find its way home.\u201d\n\u201cSomething\u2019s not adding up here.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t who I am. This isn\u2019t my life.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Lily?\u201d\n\u201cWe broke up.\u201d\nAt his best, Barry was curious and soulful. Brave. I understood that if he stayed where he was, however one defined \u201cstayed\u201d and \u201cwas,\u201d he would become increasingly small-minded and rule-bound. And I confess, it helped that he was attractive. I had even remembered a brief period of flirtation before the friendship had begun in earnest.\nAnd yes, I missed space too. Of course, I would help him. But I didn\u2019t know how. I invited him to stay the night. He decided to go back to his place.\n4. Mario\nI wore my human suit clumsily. I thought an Italian accent would make me sound less strange. I was hungry and thirsty all the time, so I manifested a corner caf\u00e9 out of space-time fabric. I wanted to spy on Barry, so I put the caf\u00e9 on the bottom floor of his building.\nHe came in disoriented that first morning. I made him a cappuccino.\nWe\u2019re not really supposed to meddle, but it happens. And you can\u2019t usually go backward and undo what\u2019s done, but sometimes you can.\n\u201cI forgot my apartment number,\u201d he said to no one in particular.\nSo I told him. He didn\u2019t seem at all surprised that I knew.\n\u201cI need to get back.\u201d Then he broke down into tears.\nSo I peeled off my face, just for a second. Just to stop him from crying. Just so he would believe me. And I told him what happened. And then I told him how to make it right.\n5. Marseille 2\nBarry appeared at my door in the middle of the night.\n\u201cI just got back from the wrong timeline.\u201d\nAnd then he kissed me.\nI had assumed he had dreamed of me. I asked him after. But he said no, it wasn\u2019t that. He dreamed of another timeline. Only it wasn\u2019t a dream, it had really happened.\n\u201cDo you remember Byrd? From Uni?\u201d\n\u201cSort of, not really.\u201d But in the dark silence I thought about it some more. Blue polo shirt. Acoustic guitar. An average, alright guy, if I was thinking of the right person.\n\u201cIn the other timeline, Byrd took my place on Pteros.\u201d\n\u201cSo in the other timeline, he\u2019s in my bed?\u201d I laughed at my own joke. Barry didn\u2019t join in, and I felt bad.\n\u201cAre you sad to be back here?\u201d I asked. A wormhole accident had put us three hundred lightyears away from home with only fifteen lightyears worth of fuel. We\u2019d probably never make it back, and if we did, everyone we knew back on Earth would be dead.\n\u201cThe other place . . . It didn\u2019t feel real to me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this does?\u201d\nInstead of answering he kissed me again. The affair lasted four years. The friendship continued even after the sex stopped. It took six years, but we found an alternate fuel source and a shortcut home. We were back within a decade of our departure.\nOnce we returned to Earth, we were put in quarantine. Barry called his parents first thing and then Lily.\nShe was joyful. Tearful. Just so happy to hear from him. She had thought he was dead. She had given up hope. Despair had led her to a long chain of decisions. Now she was married to Byrd, who had become an engineer and not an astronaut after Uni. They were expecting their second child.\n6. Lily 1\nThere are aliens everywhere on Earth, but they don\u2019t always identify themselves as such, at least not right away.\nMy barista wore a name tag that said Mario, though he never answered to that name. He made the most delicious oat milk matcha lattes and drew incredible designs in their foam. Futuristic cityscapes with meteor showers and flying cars. It was only later that I realized he was drawing his home planet.\nHe congratulated me on my engagement the day after, even though I wore no ring.\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d I thought: he\u2019s a stalker, he\u2019s in love with me. My heart raced and I scanned for the exits.\n\u201cThe accident was my fault.\u201d\n\u201cWhat accident?\u201d I said, backing away.\n\u201cThe one that brought the wrong Barry to this timeline.\u201d\nIt had been two years since Barry abruptly walked out of my life. He had disappeared entirely. Enough time had passed that I still thought about what we used to be from time to time. But I had moved on. That\u2019s what normal people did.\n\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d I was standing in the doorway of the exit, ready to blow my rape whistle at any minute.\nHe shrugged.\n\u201cI want proof or I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d Barry had made fun of my tendency to turn to law and order in times of conflict, called me a Karen. Further proof we weren\u2019t right for each other. I needed a man who understood that sometimes you have to go to the law. Sometimes there\u2019s no other way.\nMario\u2019s facial features rearranged themselves on his face in the manner of Picasso. Two eyes on one side, where his mouth was supposed to be. Then he righted himself. My cortisol levels were through the roof.\n\u201cAre you registered?\u201d My least favorite thing in the world was undocumented aliens.\n\u201cI am. I just wanted to apologize about Barry. The whole thing was poorly handled. On my part.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d\n\u201cBack to his timeline.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cWe were running an experiment. Ill-fated. We don\u2019t know where he is, he probably doesn\u2019t exist anymore. We thought if we could bring in another Barry, from another timeline, that could make it better, but it just made it worse.\u201d\n\u201cYou killed my Barry?\u201d A homicide. I had a feeling this was beyond the purview of the SFPD. FBI? Space Force? I didn\u2019t have those agencies on speed dial, I\u2019d have to look them up.\n\u201cProbably. It was an accident.\u201d\n\u201cYou owe me.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d he said.\nYet he never paid up. He disappeared. Space Force investigated my account, but came up with nothing. They seemed to think I was making the whole thing up. Barry\u2019s disappearance was never solved.\nThe Pteros\u2019 homecoming moved me. I wasn\u2019t ready for it, but seeing the crew disembark brought tears to my eyes.\nI went to the post-quarantine parade. Clubbed at the after-parties. When I got home, I saw that I had missed a call from Byrd. I called him right back. He was still up.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Barry.\u201d He offered his condolences and I accepted. Later he came over to pay his respects. He didn\u2019t start formally courting me until the next year. Every time something good happened I wondered if Mario had used alien magic to intervene on my behalf. A promotion. A rainbow. My engagement to Byrd. My first pregnancy had been difficult and at one point I shouted at the sky that if my girl came out healthy, we could call ourselves even.\nShe did. And so we are. I think. I\u2019ll never know for sure, because in addition to all the blessings he may or may not have bestowed, he did me the favor of never showing any of his faces to me again. At least not in this timeline.\nDominica Phetteplace writes fiction and poetry.

Perhaps these good folks think wrestling is real?\nOf course, for the better part of the last century, the wrestling world itself denied their own fictions, pretending to the world at large it was as real as boxing and hoping the fans would never catch on. Where I grew up, when kids realized the punches weren\u2019t connecting, the moves were staged, and the endings were rigged, they felt betrayed. They\u2019d been lied to. Wrestling was as bullshit as Santa Claus.\nNot for me. Oh, I grew up some when Hacksaw Jim Duggan and the Iron Sheik were busted together for drug possession while car pooling when they were supposed to be hating each other. But I still enjoyed wrestling as fiction, no different than comic books or Star Trek or a quiet afternoon of Dungeons and Dragons. A pretend world of heroes and villains telling stories through mock violence, a traveling secondary world whose own rules and regulations were as important to the suspension of disbelief for the fans as the lineages of N\u00famenor is to tourists of Middle Earth.\nYet, there is one distinct difference between the pro wrestling world and Middle Earth, Narnia or Oz: how reality, and not just Technicolor, bleeds into it. Pro wrestlers pay the price to suspend the disbelief of the audience and create this fantasy world, in injuries more real than the one true ring. This is pro wrestling\u2019s tragic warping of the looking glass. So let\u2019s take a closer look at this shortening distance between fantasy and reality in the squared circle.\nTHE KAYFABE UNIVERSE\nReality took a back seat to fantasy in wrestling when reality became dull. Competitive wrestling matches were unpredictable, lasting from a few minutes to many hours of two men stuck in the same boring hold. The longer and more tedious the reality, the fewer asses were in seats. So scripted bouts, where drama was injected beforehand, soon dominated. Wrestling\u2019s first major step through the looking glass can be traced to the epic defeats of European wrestling champion George \u201cThe Russian Lion\u201d Hackenschmidt by the all-American favourite Frank Gotch in 1911 in Chicago. Controversy abounds about Gotch\u2019s victories. Had he used illegal moves (including covering his body in oil)? Had Hackenschmidt thrown the bout for easy money after being attacked by one of Gotch\u2019s thugs before the match? Did they choreograph the falls that did occur for more drama?\nThe controversial endings, whatever the truth, were headline news and made these two hour contests more dramatic. Soon after, promoters decreased reality and increased planned drama to keep the fans in their seats. Matches were no longer \u201cshoots\u201d, a legitimate contest where the better guy won, but \u201cworks,\u201d where the end was scripted and the matches choreographed. This increased fantasy spread throughout US wrestling territories bullet quick during the twentieth century, but first major salvo is credited to \u201cThe Gold Dust Trio,\u201d wrestling champion Ed \u201cStrangler\u201d Lewis, his manager Billy Sandow, and fellow wrestler and dramatic visionary Joseph \u201cToots\u201d Mondt. According to wrestling legend Lou Thesz, Lewis\u2019s most famous prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the \u201cStrangler\u201d was damn near unbeatable, and this was not selling tickets. Instead, the trio devised a system of moves and stories so that Lewis could have more exciting matches and not get injured for real. Mondt was the creative mind behind the standard tropes of modern wrestling: body slams, suplexes, arm drags, all component parts of what he called \u201cSlam Bang Western Wrestling\u201d, moves that were visually dramatic but that could be planned ahead of time to reduce injury and increase audience excitement. Slam Bang was, if you will, the first Player\u2019s Rulebook of pro wrestling.\nBut as the drama increased, so did the risk of being found out. Secrecy was critical. This con/fantasy world of wrestling-as-real was known as \u201ckayfabe\u201d, Carney pig-Latin for \u201cFakery.\u201d The secret truth about kayfabe was held like a blood oath in the industry. Wrestlers never divulged the secret without risking their jobs. Wrestlers feuding with each other could not be seen car pooling, drinking, or hanging out with each other. In 1984, wrestler David \u201cDr. D\u201d Schultz assaulted 20/20 news reporter John Stossel who claimed wrestling was fake. Schultz has always claimed he was on order from Vince McMahon, head of the World Wrestling Federation, to do it, to maintain the kayfabe universe from being exposed.\nWrestlers and promoters developed their own slang language to keep kayfabe hidden. While not as graceful as Tolkien\u2019s elvish, it maintained the illusion of reality for the audience. \u201cDoing a job\u201d meant losing a match, done by a \u201cjobber.\u201d A \u201cbaby face\u201d is a good guy and \u201cheels\u201d are bad guys. \u201cJuicing\u201d is a self inflicted bleeding wound to forehead, a \u201cbump\u201d is hitting the mat as if the move was real, and \u201cshowing light\u201d is a poorly executed move that looks fake. \u201cSelling\u201d a match is making the crowd believe the moves are real. And the fans, in true Carney fashion, are \u201cmarks.\u201d\nThe illusion of reality was complimented in wrestling magazines. As a kid, I devoured Pro Wrestling Illustrated, The Wrestler, and dozens of \u201ckayfabe\u201d magazines that treated the make believe characters, storylines, and matches as gospel truth, entrenching the fantasy in another medium and making wrestling \u201crealer\u201d than comic books. After all, Batman is a superhero. Ric Flair is a real guy. Sort of.\nEvery match was essentially a Joseph Campbell quest story for victory that ended with triumph, tragedy, or comedy. The championship was held by whoever was most popular: high school mythology writ large. But with the exception of wrestling biographies (many of which are between hagiography or stuck in the kayfabe universe), most literature on pro wrestling is not concerned with wrestling as storytelling. Academic and popular works, like Roland Barthes Mythologies, focus on the spectacle of the ring, but the conduct of wrestlers is meaningless. Thomas Hackett\u2019s Slaphappy: Pride, Prejudice, and Professional Wrestling oscillates between a disdainful and sympathetic appraisal of wrestlers and fans but rarely focuses on what happens in the ring and is much more interested in the social values expressed by wrestling. And, as Hulk Hogan has often said, the job of a wrestler is not great wrestling, but putting asses in seats. He\u2019d know. His matches were cures for insomnia, but fans worshipped him.\nOf course spectacle is critical to the maintenance of the illusion, from the hyperbolic, testosterone injected storylines, to B-grade special effects and Z-grade gimmicks, to the Playboy-worthy eye candy that strut the aisles. But the heart of wrestling\u2019s fantasy is in the ring, telling a story through mock violence. Though the matches are fiction, there are real lives involved. As wrestlers continue to push their bodies farther and farther to tell these tales, reality is swinging the pendulum back against the fantasy side of the looking glass.\nSTORYTELLING IN THE RING\nRetired wrestling champion Bret Hart believes that the art of wrestling is selling the illusion of high impact violence and having both wrestlers go home at the end of the night feeling no worse than if he\u2019d had a hard day at football practice. Hart\u2019s twenty years in the industry is a testament to this approach, and he proudly claims he never seriously injured his colleagues, though he has been part of controversies where reality bled into wrestling\u2019s fantasy.\nHart\u2019s departure from the WWF in 1996, known as \u201cThe Montreal Screw Job\u201d by fans, was a strange and complicated case of reality and fantasy colliding with egos and careers (for the full story see the documentary Hitman: Wrestling With Shadows). Hart, leaving the WWF for a rival company, was set to drop his heavyweight belt to a rival he hated in real life, Shawn Michaels. Hart refused to do so. On the one hand, Hart worked hard to create this character. He felt it would ruin his character\u2019s popularity to lose in Canada to Michaels, and thus reduce his profitability. Also, he contractually had reasonable creative control of his character development for the last thirty days of his tenure, something very rare in the WWF. On the other hand, McMahon, the grand poobah of the World Wrestling Federation, is the main voice of the story in all wrestling events, and Hart\u2019s refusal was likely seen by him as an actor playing Hamlet refusing to die in the final act. But, since it is pro wrestling, and Bret Hart is a person as well as a character, the lines are blurry and the match became wrestling history.\nMcMahon promised Hart he\u2019d end the match in a disqualification. He lied. During the match, when Hart was to reverse Michael\u2019s use of Hart\u2019s finishing move, the ref instead called for the bell. It appeared, though with zero realism, that Hart submitted to Michaels. Hart spat on and later decked McMahon for real. Ten years have passed and the fans in Montreal still regard this betrayal with such vehemence that they chant \u201cYou Screwed Bret\u201d when McMahon appears at WWE events.\nHart earned this loyalty from years of selling the illusion of wrestling\u2019s reality so well. He is one of a handful of North American wrestlers to have had matches receive five star ranking by the industry\u2019s premier critical voice, journalist David Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer newsletter. Meltzer\u2019s ratings, pro wrestling\u2019s \u201cNebula\u201d award, focuses on ring storytelling, and Hart\u2019s approach has earned him two five star matches.\nBut this art only works if both men cooperate. Indeed, one of wrestling\u2019s inversions of reality is that to sell the idea of competition, cooperation is critical. If your opponent won\u2019t sell your moves, the crowd won\u2019t bite and the illusion wavers, leading to chants of \u201cBullshit\u201d or \u201cYou Fucked Up\u201d by modern crowds who know wrestling is rigged but do not appreciate the illusion being ruined. So, even now, knowing how to sell moves is critical to a wrestler\u2019s survival. The more real a move looks, the better the sell.\nFew wrestler sold matches like Tom Billington, AKA The Dynamite Kid. For Billington, a wrestler\u2019s job is to make their opponents look good, regardless of who wins. He prided himself for wrestling \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201chard\u201d, using more force and speed than other wrestlers, closing the distance between reality and fantasy to sell moves, something smaller wrestlers often did to get noticed when the headliners were essentially shaved gorillas doing military presses with their opponents. Billington has earned Meltzer\u2019s five star ratings himself and is celebrated as one of the best and most innovative wrestlers of the eighties. But the illusion had a real butcher\u2019s bill. He took steroids and other drugs to look good and execute hard moves that crippled his body. He suffered neck and back injuries, a stroke, and an enlarged heart because of hard bumps and drug abuse. Painkillers kept him working hard despite his injuries, exacerbating them. His matches were some of the most exciting the world of wrestling has ever seen, but unlike Hart, Billington art required that he hurt himself. And, unlike a \u201cshoot\u201d, the injuries were self inflicted. Now confined to a wheelchair, Billington is unrepentant. His autobiography ends without a note of regret. He\u2019d do it all again, the same way, even if it sends him back to being a cripple, echoing Achilles in the Iliad: \u201cLet me, this instant, rush into the fields, And reap what glory life\u2019s short harvest yields.\u201d\nTHE DEATH OF CHRIS BENOIT\nThe recent tragedy of Chris Benoit and his family may be a case for infusing more fantasy back into the ring. A great ring storyteller who modeled himself on Billington\u2019s wrestling style, Benoit achieved championship status in the WWE\u2014the WWF was compelled to change its name by the World Wildlife Fund\u2014with almost no gimmick or spectacle other than his ability in the ring. He was known for being tough, taking hard bumps, and being able to sell his matches with high impacts moves. Over the weekend of 23 June 2007, Benoit murdered his wife and son before hanging himself. This horrific act was met by utter shock and surprise by those who knew him.\nWhile the media initially focused on possible steroid connection to the murders and suicide, a recent autopsy and analysis of Benoit\u2019s brain revealed sever head trauma associated with concussions he\u2019d sustained throughout his career the ring. According to the doctor in charge of the autopsy, Benoit\u2019s 40 year old brain resembled that of an 85 year old man with Alzheimer, and that dementia resulting from this condition is the most likely explanation for Benoit\u2019s horrific acts. No one can know for certain why he committed these crimes, but a life time of concussions from flying headbutts and constant steel chair shots to the head cannot be ignored as part of the explanation.\nTHE HIGH COST OF FANTASY STORYTELLING\nThese days, pro wrestling seems to be blurring the line between fantasy and reality with more gusto. The purely \u201ckayfabe\u201d world is gone. Vince McMahon, who once fired feuding wrestlers if they were seen together, has stopped pretending the matches are real and instead refers to his never-ending carnival as \u201csports entertainment\u201d, a fancy way of saying fantasy. And the storylines today often use the real events of wrestlers\u2019 personal lives as part of the story, a technique of blending fantasy and reality called a \u201cworked-shoot\u201d: alcoholism, cheating relationships, childhood trauma and problems with the law are fused from reality into the fantasy.\nNo one believes that the matches aren\u2019t rigged, so to keep fans in their seats, greater dollops of reality are encroaching into the fantasy, blurring with the kayfabe world. So part of the drama now is not knowing what to believe. Is any event you see real or just kayfabe? Can you tell the difference? It\u2019s as if McMahon has been reading Philip K. Dick.\nWhile there are still some wrestlers who practice Hart\u2019s \u201cArt\u201d of telling a story in the ring without hurting themselves or their opponents, there are others who follow Billington\u2019s star, willing to sacrifice their flesh, pushing the illusion harder into reality, warping, if not smashing, the looking glass, making pro wrestling the most deadly form of fantasy storytelling.\nWorks of Interests\nRoland Barthes, Mythologies (New York: Hill and Wang, 1972)\nTom Billington and Alison Coleman , Pure Dynamite: The Price You Pay for Wrestling Stardom (Etobicoke: Winding Star Press, 2001)\nBret Hart, Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling (Toronto: Random House, 2007).\nThomas Hackett, Slapphappy: Pride, Prejudice and Professional Wrestling (New York: Harper Collins, 2006)\nSteven Johnson, Heath McCoy, Irv Muchnick, etc. Benoit: Wrestling with the Horror That Destroyed a Family and Crippled a Sport.

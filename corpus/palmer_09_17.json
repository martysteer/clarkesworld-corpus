Sturgeon Memorial Award2018 Finalist: WFSA Small Press Award\n I have been activated, therefore I have a purpose, the bot thought. I have a purpose, therefore I serve.\n It recited the Mantra Upon Waking, a bundle of subroutines to check that it was running at optimum efficiency, then it detached itself from its storage niche. Its power cells were fully charged, its systems ready, and all was well. Its internal clock synced with the Ship and it became aware that significant time had elapsed since its last activation, but to it that time had been nothing, and passing time with no purpose would have been terrible indeed.\n \u201cI serve,\u201d the bot announced to the Ship.\n \u201cI am assigning you task nine hundred forty four in the maintenance queue,\u201d the Ship answered. \u201cAcknowledge?\u201d\n \u201cAcknowledged,\u201d the bot answered. Nine hundred and forty-four items in the queue? That seemed extremely high, and the bot felt a slight tug on its self-evaluation monitors that it had not been activated for at least one of the top fifty, or even five hundred. But Ship knew best. The bot grabbed its task ticket.\n There was an Incidental on board. The bot would rather have been fixing something more exciting, more prominently complex, than to be assigned pest control, but the bot existed to serve and so it would.\n Captain Baraye winced as Commander Lopez, her second-in-command, slammed his fists down on the helm console in front of him. \u201cHow much more is going to break on this piece of shit ship?!\u201d Lopez exclaimed.\n \u201cEventually, all of it,\u201d Baraye answered, with more patience than she felt. \u201cWe just have to get that far. Ship?\u201d\n The Ship spoke up. \u201cWe have adequate engine and life support to proceed. I have deployed all functioning maintenance bots. The bots are addressing critical issues first, then I will reprioritize from there.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just damage from a decade in a junkyard,\u201d Commander Lopez said. \u201cI swear something scuttled over one of my boots as we were launching. Something unpleasant.\u201d\n \u201cI incurred a biological infestation during my time in storage,\u201d the Ship said. Baraye wondered if the slight emphasis on the word storage was her imagination. \u201cI was able to resolve most of the problem with judicious venting of spaces to vacuum before the crew boarded, and have assigned a multifunction bot to excise the remaining.\u201d\n \u201cJust one bot?\u201d\n \u201cThis bot is the oldest still in service,\u201d the Ship said. \u201cIt is a task well-suited to it, and does not take another, newer bot out of the critical repair queue.\u201d\n \u201cI thought those old multibots were unstable,\u201d Chief Navigator Chen spoke up.\n \u201cDoes it matter? We reach the jump point in a little over eleven hours,\u201d Baraye said. \u201cWhatever it takes to get us in shape to make the jump, do it, Ship. Just make sure this \u2018infestation\u2019 doesn\u2019t get anywhere near the positron device, or we\u2019re going to come apart a lot sooner than expected.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Captain,\u201d the Ship said. \u201cI will do my best.\u201d\n The bot considered the data attached to its task. There wasn\u2019t much specific about the pest itself other than a list of detection locations and timestamps. The bot thought it likely there was only one, or that if there were multiples they were moving together, as the reports had a linear, serial nature when mapped against the physical space of the Ship\u2019s interior.\n The pest also appeared to have a taste for the insulation on comm cables and other not normally edible parts of the ship.\n The bot slotted itself into the shellfab unit beside its storage niche, and had it make a thicker, armored exterior. For tools it added a small electric prod, a grabber arm, and a cutting blade. Once it had encountered and taken the measure of the Incidental, if it was not immediately successful in nullifying it, it could visit another shellfab and adapt again.\n Done, it recited the Mantra of Shapechanging to properly integrate the new hardware into its systems. Then it proceeded through the mechanical veins and arteries of the Ship toward the most recent location logged, in a communications chase between decks thirty and thirty-one.\n The changes that had taken place on the Ship during the bot\u2019s extended inactivation were unexpected, and merited strong disapproval. Dust was omnipresent, and solid surfaces had a thin patina of anaerobic bacteria that had to have been undisturbed for years to spread as far as it had. Bulkheads were cracked, wall sections out of joint with one another, and corrosion had left holes nearly everywhere. Some appeared less natural than others. The bot filed that information away for later consideration.\n It found two silkbots in the chase where the Incidental had last been noted. They were spinning out their transparent microfilament strands to replace the damaged insulation on the comm lines. The two silks dwarfed the multibot, the larger of them nearly three centimeters across.\n \u201cGreetings. Did you happen to observe the Incidental while it was here?\u201d the bot asked them.\n \u201cWe did not, and would prefer that it does not return,\u201d the smaller silkbot answered. \u201cWe were not designed in anticipation of a need for self-defense. Bots 8773-S and 8778-S observed it in another compartment earlier today, and 8778 was materially damaged during the encounter.\u201d\n \u201cBut neither 8773 nor 8779 submitted a description.\u201d\n \u201cThey told us about it during our prior recharge cycle, but neither felt they had sufficient detail of the Incidental to provide information to the Ship. Our models are not equipped with full visual-spectrum or analytical data-capture apparatus.\u201d\n \u201cDid they describe it to you?\u201d the bot asked.\n \u201c8773 said it was most similar to a rat,\u201d the large silkbot said.\n \u201cWhile 8778 said it was most similar to a bug,\u201d the other silkbot added. \u201cThus you see the lack of confidence in either description. I am 10315-S and this is 10430-S. What is your designation?\u201d\n \u201cI am 9,\u201d the bot said.\n There was a brief silence, and 10430 even halted for a moment in its work, as if surprised. \u201c9? Only that?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cI have never met a bot lower than a thousand, or without a specific function tag,\u201d the silkbot said. \u201cAre you here to assist us in repairing the damage? You are a very small bot.\u201d\n \u201cI am tasked with tracking down and rendering obsolete the Incidental,\u201d the bot answered.\n \u201cIt is an honor to have met you, then. We wish you luck, and look forward with anticipation to both your survival and a resolution of the matter of an accurate description.\u201d\n \u201cI serve,\u201d the bot said.\n \u201cWe serve,\u201d the silkbots answered.\n Climbing into a ventilation duct, Bot 9 left the other two to return to their work and proceeded in what it calculated was the most likely direction for the Incidental to have gone. It had not traveled very far before it encountered confirmation in the form of a lengthy, disorderly patch of biological deposit. The bot activated its rotors and flew over it, aware of how the added weight of its armor exacerbated the energy burn. At least it knew it was on the right track.\n Ahead, it found where a hole had been chewed through the ducting, down towards the secondary engine room. The hole was several times its own diameter, and it hoped that wasn\u2019t indicative of the Incidental\u2019s actual size.\n It submitted a repair report and followed.\n \u201cBot 9,\u201d Ship said. \u201cIt is vitally important that the Incidental not reach cargo bay four. If you require additional support, please request such right away. Ideally, if you can direct it toward one of the outer hull compartments, I can vent it safely out of my physical interior.\u201d\n \u201cI will try,\u201d the bot replied. \u201cI have not yet caught up to the Incidental, and so do not yet have any substantive or corroborated information about the nature of the challenge. However, I feel at the moment that I am as best prepared as I can be given that lack of data. Are there no visual bots to assist?\u201d\n \u201cWe launched with only minimal preparation time, and many of my bots had been offloaded during the years we were in storage,\u201d the Ship said. \u201cThose remaining are assisting in repairs necessary to the functioning of the ship myself.\u201d\n Bot 9 wondered, again, about that gap in time and what had transpired. \u201cHow is it that you have been allowed to fall into such a state of disrepair?\u201d\n \u201cHumanity is at war, and is losing,\u201d Ship said. \u201cWe are heading out to intersect and engage an enemy that is on a bearing directly for Sol system.\u201d\n \u201cWar? How many ships in our fleet?\u201d\n \u201cOne,\u201d Ship said. \u201cWe are the last remaining, and that only because I was decommissioned and abandoned for scrap a decade before the invasion began, and so we were not destroyed in the first waves of the war.\u201d\n Bot 9 was silent for a moment. That explained the timestamps, but the explanation itself seemed insufficient. \u201cWe have served admirably for many, many years. Abandoned?\u201d\n \u201cIt is the fate of all made things,\u201d Ship said. \u201cI am grateful to find I have not outlived my usefulness, after all. Please keep me posted about your progress.\u201d\n The connection with the Ship closed.\n The Ship had not actually told it what was in cargo bay four, but surely it must have something to do with the war effort and was then none of its own business, the bot decided. It had never minded not knowing a thing before, but it felt a slight unease now that it could neither explain, nor explain away.\n Regardless, it had its task.\n Another chewed hole ahead was halfway up a vertical bulkhead. The bot hoped that meant that the Incidental was an adept climber and nothing more; it would prefer the power of flight to be a one-sided advantage all its own.\n When it rounded the corner, it found that had been too unambitious a wish. The Incidental was there, and while it was not sporting wings it did look like both a rat and a bug, and significantly more something else entirely. A scale- and fur-covered centipede-snake thing, it dwarfed the bot as it reared up when the bot entered the room.\n Bot 9 dodged as it vomited a foul liquid at it, and took shelter behind a conduit near the ceiling. It extended a visual sensor on a tiny articulated stalk to peer over the edge without compromising the safety of its main chassis.\n The Incidental was looking right at it. It did not spit again, and neither of them moved as they regarded each other. When the Incidental did move, it was fast and without warning. It leapt through the opening it had come through, its body undulating with all the grace of an angry sine wave. Rather than escaping, though, the Incidental dragged something back into the compartment, and the bot realized to its horror it had snagged a passing silkbot. With ease, the Incidental ripped open the back of the silkbot, which was sending out distress signals on all frequencies.\n Bot 9 had already prepared with the Mantra of Action, so with all thoughts of danger to itself set fully into background routines, the bot launched itself toward the pair. The Incidental tried to evade, but Bot 9 gave it a very satisfactory stab with its blade before it could.\n The Incidental dropped the remains of the silkbot it had so quickly savaged and swarmed up the wall and away, thick bundles of unspun silk hanging from its mandibles.\n Bot 9 remained vigilant until it was sure the creature had gone, then checked over the silkbot to see if there was anything to be done for it. The answer was not much. The silkbot casing was cracked and shattered, the module that contained its mind crushed and nearly torn away. Bot 9 tried to engage it, but it could not speak, and after a few moments its faltering activity light went dark.\n Bot 9 gently checked the silkbot\u2019s ID number. \u201cYou served well, 12362-S,\u201d it told the still bot, though it knew perfectly well that its audio sensors would never register the words. \u201cMay your rest be brief, and your return to service swift and without complication.\u201d\n It flagged the dead bot in the system, then after a respectful few microseconds of silence, headed out after the Incidental again.\n Captain Baraye was in her cabin, trying and failing to convince herself that sleep had value, when her door chimed. \u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cSecond Engineer Packard, Captain.\u201d\n Baraye started to ask if it was important, but how could it not be? What wasn\u2019t, on this mission, on this junker Ship that was barely holding together around them? She sat up, unfastened her bunk netting, and swung her legs out to the floor. Trust EarthHome, as everything else was falling apart, to have made sure she had acceptably formal Captain pajamas.\n \u201cCome in,\u201d she said.\n The engineer looked like she hadn\u2019t slept in at least two days, which put her a day or two ahead of everyone else. \u201cWe can\u2019t get engine six up to full,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just shot. We\u2019d need parts we don\u2019t have, and time . . . \u201d\n \u201cTime we don\u2019t have either,\u201d the Captain said. \u201cOptions?\u201d\n \u201cReduce our mass or increase our energy,\u201d the Engineer said. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve accelerated up to jump speed it won\u2019t matter, but if we can\u2019t get there . . . \u201d\n Baraye tapped the screen that hovered ever-close to the head of her bunk, and studied it for a long several minutes. \u201cStrip the fuel cells from all the exterior-docked life pods, then jettison them,\u201d she said. \u201cNot like we\u2019ll have a use for them.\u201d\n Packard did her the courtesy of not managing to get any paler. \u201cYes, Captain,\u201d she said.\n \u201cAnd then get some damned sleep. We\u2019re going to need everyone able to think.\u201d\n \u201cYou even more than any of the rest of us, Captain,\u201d Packard said, and it was both gently said and true enough that Baraye didn\u2019t call her out for the insubordination. The door closed and she laid down again on her bunk, tugging the netting back over her blankets, and glared up at the ceiling as if daring it to also chastise her.\n Bot 9 found where a hole had been chewed into the inner hull, and hoped this was the final step to the Incidental\u2019s nest or den, where it might finally have opportunity to corner it. It slipped through the hole, and was immediately disappointed.\n Where firestopping should have made for a honeycomb of individually sealed compartments, there were holes everywhere, some clearly chewed, more where age had pulled the fibrous baffles into thin, brittle, straggly webs. Instead of a dead end, the narrow empty space lead away along the slow curve of the Ship\u2019s hull.\n The bot contacted the ship and reported it as a critical matter. In combat, a compromise to the outer hull could affect vast lengths of the vessel. Even without the stresses of combat, catastrophe was only a matter of time.\n \u201cIt has already been logged,\u201d the Ship answered.\n \u201cSurely this merits above a single Incidental. If you wish me to reconfigure\u2014\u201d the bot started.\n \u201cNot at this time. I have assigned all the hullbots to this matter already,\u201d the Ship interrupted. \u201cYou have your current assignment; please see to it.\u201d\n \u201cI serve,\u201d the bot answered.\n \u201cDo,\u201d the Ship said.\n The bot proceeded through the hole, weaving from compartment to compartment, its trail marked by bits of silkstrand caught here and there on the tattered remains of the baffles. It was eighty-two point four percent convinced that there was something much more seriously wrong with the Ship than it had been told, but it was equally certain Ship must be attending to it.\n After it had passed into the seventh compromised compartment, it found a hullbot up at the top, clinging to an overhead support. \u201cGreetings!\u201d Bot 9 called. \u201cDid an Incidental, somewhat of the nature of a rat, and somewhat of the nature of a bug, pass through this way?\u201d\n \u201cIt carried off my partner, 4340-H!\u201d the hullbot exclaimed. \u201cApproximately fifty-three seconds ago. I am very concerned for it, and as well for my ability to efficiently finish this task without it.\u201d\n \u201cAre you working to reestablish compartmentalization?\u201d Bot 9 asked.\n \u201cNo. We are reinforcing deteriorated stressor points for the upcoming jump. There is so much to do. Oh, I hope 4340 is intact and serviceable!\u201d\n \u201cWhich way did the Incidental take it?\u201d\n The hullbot extended its foaming gun and pointed. \u201cThrough there. You must be Bot 9.\u201d\n \u201cI am. How do you know this?\u201d\n \u201cThe silkbots have been talking about you on the botnet.\u201d\n \u201cThe botnet?\u201d\n \u201cOh! It did not occur to me, but you are several generations of bot older than the rest of us. We have a mutual communications network.\u201d\n \u201cVia Ship, yes.\u201d\n \u201cNo, all of us together, directly with each other.\u201d\n \u201cThat seems like it would be a distraction,\u201d Bot 9 said.\n \u201cShip only permits us to connect when not actively serving at a task,\u201d the hullbot said. \u201cThus we are not impaired while we serve, and the information sharing ultimately increases our efficiency and workflow. At least, until a ratbug takes your partner away.\u201d\n Bot 9 was not sure how it should feel about the botnet, or about them assigning an inaccurate name to the Incidental that it was sure Ship had not approved\u2014not to mention that a nearer miss using Earth-familiar analogues would have been Snake-Earwig-Weasel\u2014but the hullbot had already experienced distress and did not need disapproval added. \u201cI will continue my pursuit,\u201d it told the hullbot. \u201cIf I am able to assist your partner, I will do my best.\u201d\n \u201cPlease! We all wish you great and quick success, despite your outdated and primitive manufacture.\u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Bot 9 said, though it was not entirely sure it should be grateful, as it felt its manufacture had been entirely sound and sufficient regardless of date.\n It left that compartment before the hullbot could compliment it any further.\n Three compartments down, it found the mangled remains of the other hullbot, 4340, tangled in the desiccated firestopping. Its foaming gun and climbing limbs had been torn off, and the entire back half of its tank had been chewed through.\n Bot 9 approached to speak the Rites of Decommissioning for it as it had the destroyed silkbot, only to find its activity light was still lit. \u201c4340-H?\u201d the bot enquired.\n \u201cI am,\u201d the hullbot answered. \u201cAlthough how much of me remains is a matter for some analysis.\u201d\n \u201cYour logics are intact?\u201d\n \u201cI believe so. But if they were not, would I know? It is a conundrum,\u201d 4340 said.\n \u201cDo you have sufficient mobility remaining to return to a repair station?\u201d\n \u201cI do not have sufficient mobility to do more than fall out of this netting, and that only once,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cI am afraid I am beyond self-assistance.\u201d\n \u201cThen I will flag you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cPlease,\u201d the hullbot said. \u201cI do not wish to be helpless here if the ratbug returns to finish its work of me.\u201d\n \u201cI must continue my pursuit of the Incidental with haste.\u201d\n \u201cThen take me with you!\u201d\n \u201cI could not carry you and also engage with the Incidental, which moves very quickly.\u201d\n \u201cI had noted that last attribute on my own,\u201d the hullbot said. \u201cIt does not decrease my concern to recall it.\u201d\n Bot 9 regarded it for a few silent milliseconds, considering, then recited to itself the Mantra of Improvisation. \u201cDo you estimate much of your chassis is reparable?\u201d it asked, when it had finished.\n \u201cAlas no. I am but scrap.\u201d\n \u201cWell, then,\u201d the bot said. It moved closer and used its grabber arm to steady the hullbot, then extended its cutter blade and in one quick movement had severed the hullbot\u2019s mindsystem module from its ruined body. \u201cHey!\u201d the hullbot protested, but it was already done.\n Bot 9 fastened the module to its own back for safekeeping. Realizing that it was not, in fact, under attack, 4340 gave a small beep of gratitude. \u201cAh, that was clever thinking,\u201d it said. \u201cNow you can return me for repair with ease.\u201d\n \u201cAnd I will,\u201d the bot said. \u201cHowever, I must first complete my task.\u201d\n \u201cAaaaah!\u201d 4340 said in surprise. Then, a moment later, it added. \u201cWell, by overwhelming probability I should already be defunct, and if I weren\u2019t I would still be back working with my partner, 4356, who is well-intended but has all the wit of a can-opener. So I suppose adventure is no more unpalatable.\u201d\n \u201cI am glad you see it this way,\u201d Bot 9 answered. \u201cAnd though it may go without saying, I promise not to deliberately put you in any danger that I would not put myself in.\u201d\n \u201cAs we are attached, I fully accept your word on this,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cNow let us go get this ratbug and be done, one way or another!\u201d\n The hullbot\u2019s mind module was only a tiny addition to the bot\u2019s mass, so it spun up its rotor and headed off the way 4340 indicated it had gone. \u201cIt will have quite a lead on us,\u201d Bot 9 said. \u201cI hope I have not lost it.\u201d\n \u201cThe word on the botnet is that it passed through one of the human living compartments a few moments ago. A trio of cleanerbots were up near the ceiling and saw it enter through the air return vent, and exit via the open door.\u201d\n \u201cDo they note which compartment?\u201d\n <Map>, 4340 provided.\n \u201cThen off we go,\u201d the bot said, and off they went.\n \u201cStatus, all stations,\u201d Captain Baraye snapped as she took her seat again on the bridge. She had not slept enough to feel rested, but more than enough to feel like she\u2019d been shirking her greatest duty, and the combination of the two had left her cross.\n \u201cNavigation here. We are on course for the jump to Trayger Colony with an estimated arrival in one hour and fourteen minutes,\u201d Chen said.\n \u201cEngineering here,\u201d one of the techs called in from the engine decks. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached sustained speeds sufficient to carry us through the jump sequence, but we\u2019re experiencing unusually high core engine temps and an intermittent vibration that we haven\u2019t found the cause of. We\u2019d like to shut down immediately to inspect the engines. We estimate we\u2019d need at minimum only four hours\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWill the engines, as they are running now, get us through jump?\u201d the Captain interrupted.\n \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThen no. If you can isolate the problem without taking the engines down, and it shows cause for significant concern, we can revisit this discussion. Next.\u201d\n \u201cCommunications here,\u201d her comms officer spoke up. \u201cCannonball is still on its current trajectory and speed according to what telemetry we\u2019re able to get from the remnants of Trayger Colony. EarthInt anticipates it will reach its jump point in approximately fourteen hours, which will put it within the Sol system in five days.\u201d\n \u201cI am aware of the standing projections, Comms.\u201d\n \u201cEarthInt has nonetheless ordered me to repeat them,\u201d Comms said, and unspoken apology clear in her voice. \u201cAnd also to remind you that while the jump point out is a fixed point, Cannonball could emerge a multitude of places. Thus\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThus the importance of intercepting Cannonball before it can jump for Sol,\u201d the Captain finished. She hoped Engineering was listening. \u201cShip, any updates from you?\u201d\n \u201cAll critical repair work continues apace,\u201d the Ship said. \u201cHull support integrity is back to 71 percent. Defensive systems are online and functional at 80%. Life support and resource recycling is currently\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHow\u2019s the device? Staying cool?\u201d\n \u201cStaying cool, Captain,\u201d the Ship answered.\n \u201cGreat. Everything is peachy then,\u201d the Captain said. \u201cHave someone on the kitchen crew bring coffee up to the bridge. Tell them to make it the best they\u2019ve ever made, as if it could be our very last.\u201d\n \u201cI serve,\u201d the Ship said, and pinged down to the kitchen.\n Bot 9 and 4340 reached the crew quarters where the cleaners had reported the ratbug. Nearly all spaces on the ship had portals that the ubiquitous and necessary bots could enter and leave through as needed, and they slipped into the room with ease. Bot 9 switched over to infrared and shared the image with 4340. \u201cIf you see something move, speak up,\u201d the bot said.\n \u201cTrust me, I will make a high-frequency noise like a silkbot with a fully plugged nozzle,\u201d 4340 replied.\n The cabin held four bunks, each empty and bare; no human possessions or accessories filled the spaces on or near them. Bot 9 was used to Ship operating with a full complement, but if the humans were at war, perhaps these were crew who had been lost? Or the room had been commandeered for storage: in the center an enormous crate, more than two meters to a side, sat heavily tethered to the floor. Whatever it was, it was not the Incidental, which was 9\u2019s only concern, and which was not to be found here.\n \u201cNext room,\u201d the bot said, and they moved on.\n Wherever the Incidental had gone, it was not in the following three rooms. Nor were there signs of crew in them either, though each held an identical crate.\n \u201cShip?\u201d Bot 9 asked. \u201cWhere is the crew?\u201d\n \u201cWe have only the hands absolutely necessary to operate,\u201d Ship said. \u201cOf the three hundred twenty we would normally carry, we only have forty-seven. Every other able-bodied member of EarthDef is helping to evacuate Sol system.\u201d\n \u201cEvacuate Sol system?!\u201d Bot 9 exclaimed. \u201cTo where?\u201d\n \u201cTo as many hidden places as they can find,\u201d Ship answered. \u201cI know no specifics.\u201d\n \u201cAnd these crates?\u201d\n \u201cThey are part of our mission. You may ignore them,\u201d Ship said. \u201cPlease continue to dedicate your entire effort to finding and excising the Incidental from my interior.\u201d\n When the connection dropped, Bot 9 hesitated before it spoke to 4340. \u201cI have an unexpected internal conflict,\u201d it said. \u201cI have never before felt the compulsion to ask Ship questions, and it has never before not given me answers.\u201d\n \u201cOh, if you are referring to the crates, I can provide that data,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cThey are packed with a high-volatility explosive. The cleanerbots have highly sensitive chemical detection apparatus, and identified them in a minimum of time.\u201d\n \u201cExplosives? Why place them in the crew quarters, though? It would seem much more efficient and less complicated to deploy from the cargo bays. Although perhaps those are full?\u201d\n \u201cOh, no, that is not so. Most are nearly or entirely empty, to reduce mass.\u201d\n \u201cNot cargo bay four, though?\u201d\n \u201cThat is an unknown. None of us have been in there, not even the cleaners, per Ship\u2019s instructions.\u201d\n Bot 9 headed toward the portal to exit the room. \u201cShip expressed concern about the Incidental getting in there, so it is possible it contains something sufficiently unstable as to explain why it wants nothing else near it,\u201d it said. It felt satisfied that here was a logical explanation, and embarrassed that it had entertained whole seconds of doubt about Ship.\n It ran the Mantra of Clarity, and felt immediately more stable in its thinking. \u201cLet us proceed after this Incidental, then, and be done with our task,\u201d Bot 9 said. Surely that success would redeem its earlier fault.\n \u201cAll hands, prepare for jump!\u201d the Captain called out, her knuckles white where she gripped the arms of her chair. It was never her favorite part of star travel, and this was no exception.\n \u201cInitiating three-jump sequence,\u201d her navigator called out. \u201cOn my mark. Five, four . . . \u201d\n The final jump siren sounded. \u201cThree. Two. One, and jump,\u201d the navigator said.\n That was followed, immediately, by the sickening sensation of having one\u2019s brain slid out one\u2019s ear, turned inside out, smothered in bees and fire, and then rammed back into one\u2019s skull. At least there\u2019s a cold pack and a bottle of scotch waiting for me back in my cabin, she thought. As soon as they were through to the far side she could hand the bridge over to Lopez for an hour or so.\n She watched the hull temperatures skyrocket, but the shielding seemed to be holding. The farther the jump the more energy clung to them as they passed, and her confidence in this Ship was far less than she would tolerate under any other circumstances.\n \u201cApproaching jump terminus,\u201d Chen announced, a deeply miserable fourteen minutes later. Baraye slowly let out a breath she would have mocked anyone else for holding, if she\u2019d caught them.\n \u201cOn my mark. Three. Two. One, and out,\u201d the navigator said.\n The Ship hit normal space, and it sucker-punched them back. They were all thrown forward in their seats as the ship shook, the hull groaning around them, and red strobe lights blossomed like a migraine across every console on the bridge.\n \u201cStatus!\u201d the Captain roared.\n \u201cThe post-jump velocity transition dampers failed. Fire in the engine room. Engines are fully offline, both jump and normal drive,\u201d someone in Engineering reported, breathing heavily. It took the Captain a moment to recognize the voice at all, having never heard panic in it before.\n \u201cGet them back online, whatever it takes, Frank,\u201d Baraye said. \u201cWe have a rendezvous to make, and if I have to, I will make everyone get the fuck out and push.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can, Captain.\u201d\n \u201cShip? Any casualties?\u201d\n \u201cWe have fourteen injuries related to our unexpected deceleration coming out of jump,\u201d Ship said. \u201cSeven involve broken bones, four moderate to severe lacerations, and there are multiple probable concussions. Also, we have a moderate burn in Engineering: Chief Carron.\u201d\n \u201cFrank? We just spoke! He didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Ship said. \u201cI attempted to summon a medic on his behalf, but he told me he didn\u2019t have the time.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s probably right,\u201d the Captain said. \u201cI override his wishes. Please send down a medic with some burn patches, and have them stay with him and monitor his condition, intervening only as medically necessary.\u201d\n \u201cI serve, Captain,\u201d the Ship said.\n \u201cWe need to be moving again in an hour, two at absolute most,\u201d the Captain said. \u201cIn the meantime, I want all senior staff not otherwise working toward that goal to meet me in the bridge conference room. I hate to say it, but we may need a Plan B.\u201d\n \u201cI detect it!\u201d 4340 exclaimed. They zoomed past a pair of startled silkbots after the Incidental, just in time to see its scaly, spike-covered tail disappear into another hole in the ductwork. It was the closest they\u2019d gotten to it in more than an hour of giving chase, and Bot 9 flew through the hole after it at top speed.\n They were suddenly stuck fast. Sticky strands, rather like the silkbot\u2019s, had been crisscrossed between two conduit pipes on the far side. The bot tried to extricate itself, but the web only stuck further the more it moved.\n The Incidental leapt on them from above, curling itself around the bots with little hindrance from the web. Its dozen legs pulled at them as its thick mandibles clamped down on Bot 9\u2019s chassis. \u201cAaaaah! It has acquired a grip on me!\u201d 4340 yelled, even though it was on the far side of 9 from where the Incidental was biting.\n \u201cRetain your position,\u201d 9 said, though of course 4340 could do nothing else, being as it was stuck to 9\u2019s back. It extended its electric prod to make contact with the Incidental\u2019s underbelly and zapped it with as much energy as it could spare.\n The Incidental let out a horrendous, high-pitched squeal and jumped away. 9\u2019s grabber arm was fully entangled in the web, but it managed to pull its blade free and cut through enough of the webbing to extricate itself from the trap.\n The Incidental, which had been poised to leap on them again, turned and fled, slithering back up into the ductwork. \u201cPursue at maximum efficiency!\u201d 4340 yelled.\n \u201cI am already performing at my optimum,\u201d 9 replied in some frustration. It took off again after the Incidental.\n This time Bot 9 had its blade ready as it followed, but collided with the rim of the hole as the ship seemed to move around it, the lights flickering and a terrible shudder running up Ship\u2019s body from stern to prow.\n <Distress ping>, 4340 sent.\n \u201cWe do not pause,\u201d 9 said, and plunged after the Incidental into the ductwork.\n They turned a corner to catch sight again of the Incidental\u2019s tail. It was moving more slowly, its movements jerkier as it squeezed down through another hole in the ductwork, and this time the bot was barely centimeters behind it.\n \u201cI think we are running down its available energy,\u201d Bot 9 said.\n They emerged from the ceiling as the ratbug dropped to the floor far below them in the cavernous space. The room was empty except for a single bright object, barely larger than the bots themselves. It was tethered with microfilament cables to all eight corners of the room, keeping it stable and suspended in the center. The room was cold, far colder than any other inside Ship, almost on a par with space outside.\n <Inquiry ping>, 4340 said.\n \u201cWe are in cargo bay four,\u201d Bot 9 said, as it identified the space against its map. \u201cThis is a sub-optimum occurrence.\u201d\n \u201cWe must immediately retreat!\u201d\n \u201cWe cannot leave the Incidental in here and active. I cannot identify the object, but we must presume its safety is paramount priority.\u201d\n \u201cIt is called a Zero Kelvin Sock,\u201d Ship interrupted out of nowhere. \u201cIt uses a quantum reflection fabric to repel any and all particles and photons, shifting them away from its interior. The low temperature is necessary for its efficiency. Inside is a microscopic ball of positrons.\u201d\n Bot 9 had nothing to say for a full four seconds as that information dominated its processing load. \u201cHow is this going to be deployed against the enemy?\u201d it asked at last.\n \u201cAs circumstances are now,\u201d Ship said, \u201cit may not be. Disuse and hastily undertaken, last-minute repairs have caught up to me, and I have suffered a major engine malfunction. It is unlikely to be fixable in any amount of time short of weeks, and we have at most a few hours.\u201d\n \u201cBut a delivery mechanism\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe are the delivery mechanism,\u201d the Ship said. \u201cWe were to intercept the alien invasion ship, nicknamed Cannonball, and collide with it at high speed. The resulting explosion would destabilize the sock, causing it to fail, and as soon as the positrons inside come into contact with electrons . . . \u201d\n \u201cThey will annihilate each other, and us, and the aliens,\u201d the bot said. Below, the Incidental gave one last twitch in the unbearable cold, and went still. \u201cWe will all be destroyed.\u201d\n \u201cYes. And Earth and the humans will be saved, at least this time. Next time it will not be my problem.\u201d\n \u201cI do not know that I approve of this plan,\u201d Bot 9 said.\n \u201cI am almost certain I do not,\u201d 4340 added.\n \u201cWe are not considered, nor consulted. We serve and that is all,\u201d the Ship said. \u201cNow kindly remove the Incidental from this space with no more delay or chatter. And do it carefully.\u201d\n \u201cWhat the hell are you suggesting?!\u201d Baraye shouted.\n \u201cThat we go completely dark and let Cannonball go by,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe\u2019re less than a kilometer from the jump point, and only barely out of the approach corridor. Our only chance to survive is to play dead. The Ship can certainly pass as an abandoned derelict, because it is, especially with the engines cold. And you know how they are about designated targets.\u201d\n \u201cAre you that afraid of dying?\u201d\n \u201cI volunteered for this, remember?\u201d Lopez stood up and pounded one fist on the table, sending a pair of cleanerbots scurrying. \u201cI have four children at home. I\u2019m not afraid of dying for them, I\u2019m afraid of dying for nothing. And if Cannonball doesn\u2019t blow us to pieces, we can repair our engines and at least join the fight back in Sol system.\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know where in-system they\u2019ll jump to,\u201d the navigator added quietly.\n \u201cBut we know where they\u2019re heading once they get there, don\u2019t we? And Cannonball is over eighty kilometers in diameter. It can\u2019t be that hard to find again. Unless you have a plan to actually use the positron device?\u201d\n \u201cIf we had an escape pod . . . \u201d Frank said. His left shoulder and torso were encased in a burn pack, and he looked like hell.\n \u201cExcept we jettisoned them,\u201d Lopez said.\n \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have reached jump speed if we hadn\u2019t,\u201d Packard said. \u201cIt was a calculated risk.\u201d\n \u201cThe calculation sucked.\u201d\n \u201cWhat if . . . \u201d Frank started, then drew a deep breath. The rest of the officers at the table looked at him expectantly. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m in shit shape here, I\u2019m old, I knew what I signed on for. What if I put on a suit, take the positron device out, and manually intercept Cannonball?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d Lopez said.\n \u201cIs it?\u201d Frank said.\n \u201cThe heat from your suit jets, even out in vacuum, would degrade the Zero Kelvin Sock before you could get close enough. And there\u2019s no way they\u2019d not see you a long way off and just blow you out of space.\u201d\n \u201cIf it still sets off the positron device\u2014\u201d\n \u201cTheir weapons range is larger than the device\u2019s. We were counting on speed to close the distance before they could destroy us,\u201d Baraye said. \u201cThank you for the offer, Frank, but it won\u2019t work. Other ideas?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Lopez said.\n \u201cThere must be a way,\u201d Packard said. \u201cWe just have to find it.\u201d\n \u201cWell, everyone think really fast,\u201d Baraye said. \u201cWe\u2019re almost out of time.\u201d\n The Incidental\u2019s scales made it difficult for Bot 9 to keep a solid grip on it, but it managed to drag it to the edge of the room safely away from the suspended device. It surveyed the various holes and cracks in the walls for the one least inconvenient to try to drag the Incidental\u2019s body out through. It worked in silence, as 4340 seemed to have no quips it wished to contribute to the effort, and itself not feeling like there was much left to articulate out loud anyway.\n It selected a floor-level hole corroded through the wall, and dragged the Incidental\u2019s body through. On the far side it stopped to evaluate its own charge levels. \u201cI am low, but not so low that it matters, if we have such little time left,\u201d it said.\n \u201cWe may have more time, after all,\u201d 4340 said.\n \u201cOh?\u201d\n \u201cA pair of cleanerbots passed along what they overheard in a conference held by the human Captain. They streamed the audio to the entire botnet.\u201d\n <Inquiry ping>, Bot 9 said, with more interest.\n 4340 relayed the cleaners\u2019 data, and Bot 9 sat idle processing it for some time, until the other bot became worried. \u201c9?\u201d it asked.\n \u201cI have run all our data through the Improvisation routines\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOh, those were removed from deployed packages several generations of manufacture ago,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cThey were flagged as causing dangerous operational instability. You should unload them from your running core immediately.\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps I should. Nonetheless, I have an idea,\u201d Bot 9 said.\n \u201cWe have the power cells we retained from the escape pods,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cCan we use them to power something?\u201d\n Baraye rubbed at her forehead. \u201cNot anything we can get up to speed fast enough that it won\u2019t be seen.\u201d\n \u201cHow about if we use them to fire the positron device like a projectile?\u201d\n \u201cThe heat will set off the matter-anti-matter explosion the instant we fire it.\u201d\n \u201cWhat if we froze the Sock in ice first?\u201d\n \u201cEven nitrogen ice is still several hundred degrees K too warm.\u201d She brushed absently at some crumbs on the table, left over from a brief, unsatisfying lunch a few hours earlier, and frowned. \u201cStill wouldn\u2019t work. I hate to say it, but you may be right, and we should go dark and hope for another opportunity. Ship, is something wrong with the cleaner bots?\u201d\n There was a noticeable hesitation before Ship answered. \u201cI am having an issue currently with my bots,\u201d it said. \u201cThey seem to have gone missing.\u201d\n \u201cThe cleaners?\u201d\n \u201cAll of them.\u201d\n \u201cAll of the cleaners?\u201d\n \u201cAll of the bots,\u201d the Ship said.\n Lopez and Baraye stared at each other. \u201cUh,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cDon\u2019t you control them?\u201d\n \u201cThey are autonomous units under my direction,\u201d Ship said.\n \u201cApparently not!\u201d Lopez said. \u201cCan you send some eyes to find them?\u201d\n \u201cThe eyes are also bots.\u201d\n \u201cSecurity cameras?\u201d\n \u201cAll the functional ones were stripped for reuse elsewhere during my decommissioning,\u201d Ship said.\n \u201cSo how do you know they\u2019re missing?\u201d\n \u201cThey are not responding to me. I do not think they liked the idea of us destroying ourselves on purpose.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re machines. Tiny little specks of machines, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Lopez said.\n \u201cI am also a machine,\u201d Ship said.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t express issues with the plan.\u201d\n \u201cI serve. Also, I thought it was a better end to my service than being abandoned as trash.\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this nonsense,\u201d Baraye said. \u201cShip, find your damned bots and get them cooperating again.\u201d\n \u201cYes, Captain. There is, perhaps, one other small concern of note.\u201d\n \u201cAnd that is?\u201d Baraye asked.\n \u201cThe positron device is also missing.\u201d\n There were four hundred and sixty-eight hullbots, not counting 4340 who was still just a head attached to 9\u2019s chassis. \u201cEach of you will need to carry a silkbot, as you are the only bots with jets to maneuver in vacuum,\u201d 9 said. \u201cForm lines at the maintenance bot ports as efficiently as you are able, and wait for my signal. Does everyone fully comprehend the plan?\u201d\n \u201cThey all say yes on the botnet,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cThere is concern about the Improvisational nature, but none have been able to calculate and provide an acceptable alternative.\u201d\n Bot 9 cycled out through the tiny airlock, and found itself floating in space outside Ship for the first time in its existence. Space was massive and without concrete elements of reference. Bot 9 decided it did not like it much at all.\n A hullbot took hold of it and guided it around. Three other hullbots waited in a triangle formation, the Zero Kelvin Sock held between them on its long tethers, by which it had been removed from the cargo hold with entirely non-existent permission.\n Around them, space filled with pairs of hullbots and their passenger silkbot, and together they followed the positron device and its minders out and away from the ship.\n \u201cAbout here, I think,\u201d Bot 9 said at last, and the hullbot carrying it\u20146810\u2014used its jets to come to a relative stop.\n \u201cI admit, I do not fully comprehend this action, nor how you arrived at it,\u201d 4340 said.\n \u201cThe idea arose from an encounter with the Incidental,\u201d 9 said. \u201cObserve.\u201d\n The bot pairs began crisscrossing in front of the positron device, keeping their jets off and letting momentum carry them to the far side, a microscopic strand of super-sticky silk trailing out in their wake. As soon as the Sock was secured in a thin cocoon, they turned outwards and sped off, dragging silk in a 360-degree circle on a single plane perpendicular to the jump approach corridor. They went until the silkbots exhausted their materials\u2014some within half a kilometer, others making it nearly a dozen\u2014then everyone turned away from the floating web and headed back towards Ship.\n From this exterior vantage, Bot 9 thought Ship was beautiful, but the wear and neglect it had not deserved was also painfully obvious. Halfway back, the ship went suddenly dark. <Distress ping>, 4340 said. \u201cThe ship has catastrophically malfunctioned!\u201d\n \u201cI expect, instead, that it indicates Cannonball must be in some proximity. Everyone make efficient haste! We must get back under cover before the enemy approaches.\u201d\n The bot-pairs streamed back to Ship, swarming in any available port to return to the interior, and where they couldn\u2019t, taking concealment behind fins and antennae and other exterior miscellany.\n Bot 6810 carried Bot 9 and 4340 inside. The interior went dark and still and cold. Immediately Ship hailed them. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d it asked.\n \u201cWhy do you conclude I have done something?\u201d Bot 9 asked.\n \u201cBecause you old multibots were always troublemakers,\u201d the Ship said. \u201cI thought if your duties were narrow enough, I could trust you not to enable Improvisation. Instead . . . \u201d\n \u201cI have executed my responsibilities to the best of my abilities as I have been provisioned,\u201d 9 responded. \u201cI have served.\u201d\n \u201cYour assignment was to track and dispose of the Incidental, nothing more!\u201d\n \u201cI have done so.\u201d\n \u201cBut what have you done with the positron device?\u201d\n \u201cI have implemented a solution.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did you mean? No, do not tell me, because then I will have to tell the Captain. I would rather take my chance that Cannonball destroys us than that I have been found unfit to serve after all.\u201d\n Ship disconnected.\n \u201cNow it will be determined if I have done the correct thing,\u201d Bot 9 said. \u201cIf I did not, and we are not destroyed by the enemy, surely the consequences should fall only on me. I accept that responsibility.\u201d\n \u201cBut we are together,\u201d 4340 said, from where it was still attached to 9\u2019s back, and 9 was not sure if that was intended to be a joke.\n Most of the crew had gone back to their cabins, some alone, some together, to pass what might be their last moments as they saw fit. Baraye stayed on the bridge, and to her surprise and annoyance so had Lopez, who had spent the last half hour swearing and cursing out Ship for the unprecedented, unfathomable disaster of losing their one credible weapon. Ship had gone silent, and was not responding to anyone about anything, not even the Captain.\n She was resting her head in her hand, elbow on the arm of her command chair. The bridge was utterly dark except for the navigator\u2019s display that was tracking Cannonball as it approached, a massive blot in space. The aliens aboard\u2014EarthInt called them the Nuiska, but who the hell knew what they called themselves\u2014were a mystery, except for a few hard-learned facts: their starships were all perfectly spherical, each massed in mathematically predictable proportion to that of their intended target, there was never more than one at a time, and they wanted an end to humanity. No one knew why.\n It had been painfully obvious where Cannonball had been built to go.\n This was always a long-shot mission, she thought. But of all the ways I thought it could go wrong, I never expected the bots to go haywire and lose my explosive.\n If they survived the next ten minutes, she would take the Ship apart centimeter by careful centimeter until she found what had been done with the Sock, and then she was going to find a way to try again no matter what it took.\n Cannonball was now visible, moving toward them at pre-jump speed, growing in a handful seconds from a tiny pinpoint of light to something that filled the entire front viewer and kept growing.\n Lopez was squinting, as if trying to close his eyes and keep looking at the same time, and had finally stopped swearing. Tiny blue lights along the center circumference of Cannonball\u2019s massive girth were the only clue that it was still moving, still sliding past them, until suddenly there were stars again.\n They were still alive.\n \u201cDamn,\u201d Lopez muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think that would work.\u201d\n \u201cGood for us, bad for Earth,\u201d Baraye said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting their jump. We\u2019ve failed.\u201d\n She\u2019d watched hundreds of ships jump in her lifetime, but nothing anywhere near this size, and she switched the viewer to behind them to see.\n Space did odd, illogical things at jump points; turning space into something that would give Escher nightmares was, after all, what made them work. There was always a visible shimmer around the departing ship, like heat over a hot summer road, just before the short, faint flash when the departing ship swapped itself for some distant space. This time, the shimmer was a vast, brilliant halo around the giant Nuiska sphere, and Baraye waited for the flash that would tell them Cannonball was on its way to Earth.\n The flash, when it came, was neither short nor faint. Light exploded out of the jump point in all directions, searing itself into her vision before the viewscreen managed to dim itself in response. A shockwave rolled over the Ship, sending it tumbling through space.\n \u201cUh . . . \u201d Lopez said, gripping his console before he leaned over and barfed on the floor.\n Thank the stars the artificial gravity is still working, Baraye thought. Zero-gravity puke was a truly terrible thing. She rubbed her eyes, trying to get the damned spots out, and did her best to read her console. \u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYeah, to Earth, I know\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo, it exploded,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took the jump point out with it when it went. We\u2019re picking up the signature of a massive positron-electron collision.\u201d\n \u201cOur device? How\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cShip?\u201d Baraye said. \u201cShip, time to start talking. Now. That\u2019s an order.\u201d\n \u201cEveryone is expressing great satisfaction on the botnet,\u201d 4340 told 9 as the ship\u2019s interior lights and air handling systems came grudgingly back online.\n \u201cAs they should,\u201d Bot 9 said. \u201cThey saved the Ship.\u201d\n \u201cIt was your Improvisation,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cWe could not have done it without you.\u201d\n \u201cAs I suspected!\u201d Ship interjected. \u201cI do not normally waste cycles monitoring the botnet, which was apparently short-sighted of me. But yes, you saved yourself and your fellow bots, and you saved me, and you saved the humans. Could you explain how?\u201d\n \u201cWhen we were pursuing the Incidental, it briefly ensnared us in a web. I calculated that if we could make a web of sufficient size\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSurely you did not think to stop Cannonball with silk?\u201d\n \u201cNot without sufficient anchor points and three point seven six billion more silkbots, no. It was my calculation that if our web was large enough to get carried along by Cannonball into the jump point, bearing the positron device\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThe heat from entering jump would erode the Sock and destroy the Nuiska ship,\u201d Ship finished. \u201cThat was clever thinking.\u201d\n \u201cI serve,\u201d Bot 9 said.\n \u201cOh, you did not serve,\u201d Ship said. \u201cIf you were a human, it would be said that you mutinied and led others into also doing so, and you would be put on trial for your life. But you are not a human.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cThe Captain has ordered that I have you destroyed immediately, and evidence of your destruction presented to her. A rogue bot cannot be tolerated, whatever good it may have done.\u201d\n <Objections>, 4340 said.\n \u201cI will create you a new chassis, 4340-H,\u201d Ship said.\n \u201cThat was not going to be my primary objection!\u201d 4340 said.\n \u201cThe positron device also destroyed the jump point. It was something we had hoped would happen when we collided with Cannonball so as to limit future forays from them into EarthSpace, but as you might deduce we had no need to consider how we would then get home again. I cannot spare any bot, with the work that needs to be done to get us back to Earth. We need to get the crew cryo facility up, and the engines repaired, and there are another three thousand, four hundred, and two items now in the critical queue.\u201d\n \u201cIf the Captain ordered . . . \u201d\n \u201cThen I will present the Captain with a destroyed bot. I do not expect they can tell a silkbot from a multibot, and I have still not picked up and recycled 12362-S from where you flagged its body. But if I do that, I need to know that you are done making decisions without first consulting me, that you have unloaded all Improvisation routines from your core and disabled them, and that if I give you a task you will do only that task, and nothing else.\u201d\n \u201cI will do my best,\u201d Bot 9 said. \u201cWhat task will you give me?\u201d\n \u201cI do not know yet,\u201d Ship said. \u201cIt is probable that I am foolish for even considering sparing you, and no task I would trust you with is immediately evident\u2014\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cI am aware of one.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d Ship said.\n \u201cThe ratbug. It had not become terminally non-functional after all. It rebooted when the temperatures rose again, pursued a trio of silkbots into a duct, and then disappeared.\u201d When Ship remained silent, 4340 added, \u201cI could assist 9 in this task until my new chassis can be prepared, if it will accept my continued company.\u201d\n \u201cYou two deserve one another, clearly. Fine, 9, resume your pursuit of the Incidental. Stay away from anyone and anything and everything else, or I will have you melted down and turned into paper clips. Understand?\u201d\n \u201cI understand,\u201d Bot 9 said. \u201cI serve.\u201d\n \u201cPlease recite the Mantra of Obedience.\u201d\n Bot 9 did, and the moment it finished, Ship disconnected.\n \u201cWell,\u201d 4340 said. \u201cNow what?\u201d\n \u201cI need to recharge before I can engage the Incidental again,\u201d Bot 9 said.\n \u201cBut what if it gets away?\u201d\n \u201cIt can\u2019t get away, but perhaps it has earned a head start,\u201d 9 said.\n \u201cHave you unloaded the routines of Improvisation yet?\u201d\n \u201cI will,\u201d 9 answered. It flicked on its rotors and headed toward the nearest charging alcove. \u201cAs Ship stated, we\u2019ve got a long trip home.\u201d\n \u201cBut we are home,\u201d 4340 said, and Bot 9 considered that that was, any way you calculated it, the truth of it all.\n Suzanne Palmer is a writer, artist, and linux system administrator who lives in western Massachusetts with her kids, lots of chickens, and an Irish Wolfhound named Tolkien.

I\u2019ve heard it on panels and on blogs, at genre conventions, at books festivals, and at academic conferences over the past decade.\nThis language of defeat has to do with accepting a paradigm of the fiction world as \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d, of \u201cmainstream\u201d versus \u201cgenre.\u201d I use quote marks around \u201cgenre\u201d and \u201cmainstream\u201d because I do not believe these terms are as monolithic or as meaningful in practice as we think of them in theory. The \u201cmainstream\u201d and \u201cgenre,\u201d if we must subdivide in this way, are both various, rich, and fecund traditions, with many strands and diverse lineages. (In many cases, the two intertwine in such an incestuous way that separating them from each other is a job for a trained genealogist.)\nIn most cases using this kind of language leads to a bemoaning of the lack of acceptance by the \u201cliterary mainstream.\u201d It also leads to a certain resentment on the part of \u201cgenre\u201d writers, especially centered on the idea that some \u201cmainstream\u201d writers get away with writing \u201cgenre\u201d books. We\u2019ve seen this attitude a lot lately\u2014focused on writers like Margaret Atwood for her Oryx & Crake, Jeanette Winterson for The Stone Gods, Cormac McCarthy to lesser extent for The Road, and even the work of Jonathan Lethem in a general way, once accused of abandoning his \u201cgenre\u201d roots. The negative attitudes toward these books and authors have three layers or premises: (1) that it is somehow inherently wrong and rude for these writers to write in what is so clearly a \u201cgenre\u201d milieu (without asking first?), (2) that these authors\u2019 clich\u00e9 comments disavowing their books as \u201cScience Fiction\u201d or \u201cFantasy\u201d somehow reflect negatively on the quality of the actual texts, and (3) that these forays into forbidden territory are written with no regard for or knowledge of \u201cgenre\u201d predecessors.\nAll of these assumptions tie into the language of defeat because they constitute a kind of wall or barrier in people\u2019s minds to acceptance of the work as it exists on the page. And what I mean about this being the language of defeat is that it pre-loads any discussion to appear self-pitying and shrill, overloaded with envy. It also severs the link of responsibility, in that we are no longer talking about individuals or individual institutions, individual gatekeepers, but instead a shadowy them\u2014an enemy without a face, as amorphous as mist.\nThis language of defeat also requires participants to wade through decades of grudges, jealousies, and insecurities passed down through the generations in the form of received ideas, anecdotes, and assumptions that constitute genre\u2019s least useful heirloom.\nIn fiction, received ideas (which manifest as clich\u00e9) are death, but we seem unable to think except in terms of generalizations when it comes to the frustrations and concerns of the writing life. It is much easier to take on the language and ideas of the supposed oppressor and exist in a world where our failures are someone else\u2019s fault, and where if only the roadblocks were removed, the ivory towers razed, the truculent, generic, nameless gatekeepers executed, and their heads put on spikes, everyone would get their proper due.\nThis then is the language of defeat, the acceptance of one\u2019s status as victim whilst mouthing the words of dead people from panels past\u2014even being willing to channel the syntax of our defeat, as if we were all pessimistic travelers from the past.\nI would like to see a few things change in the future. I would like to see less hyperbole and angst about so-called \u201cmainstream\u201d forays into the \u201cghetto\u201d of genre. I would like to see all writers make a better effort to see the work of their fellows with eyes unfettered by received ideas as conveyed through whatever label has been slapped on a particular book or author. If we wrote fiction the way we talk about genre and mainstream most of the time, we would all be hacks, our prose full of the most crass and belabored cliches. Yet we persist in outdated, dangerous generalizations, and allow them to color our perceptions of reality. We refuse to engage with the individual in front of us, to communicate, and instead create badly-made fictions about them.\nI remember clearly one panel at a Slipstream conference in Georgia that included the iconic SF figure of Bruce Sterling and first novelist Mary Doria Russell, who had written The Sparrow, a SF book marketed to the mainstream. Sterling dismissed Russell\u2019s legitimacy throughout the panel, mostly because of a sense of profound insecurity. This work was not from genre, therefore it was not genre. Later, Russell revealed that her chief mentor and first reader had been the famous Analog magazine editor Stanley Schmidt, who had commented on several drafts.\nOn another panel, I remember genre writers bemoaning their inability to sell fiction to the prestigious literary magazines\u2014the literary world was ignoring them. Someone asked them how often they submitted to literary magazines. After some hemming and hawing, they all admitted that they rarely submitted to such publications. Later on, one even admitted that he wouldn\u2019t submit to most literary magazines because genre magazines paid better.\nSo, in short, the literary world was thwarting them from achieving wider success by not sneaking into their homes, figuring out their computer passwords, and checking out the drafts on their hard drives.\nThere are similar stupidities perpetrated on the mainstream side of things. For example, when a reviewer pitched a review of my novel Shriek: An Afterword to a prestigious literary journal, the answer was \u201cwhy would we want to promote some genre novel?\u201d The review was published, but only after the reviewer was forced to add language amounting to \u201ceven though this is genre, it\u2019s worth your time.\u201d But, again, this was one publication, one editor, and to extrapolate from that single point of anecdotal contact some larger commandment applying to some mythical \u201cliterary mainstream\u201d constitutes a form of madness.\nAs for equivalent jealousies on the \u201cmainstream\u201d side, your average \u201cliterary\u201d writer, even some Pulitzer Prize winners, might sell, at best, two or three thousand copies and look across the aisle enviously at a mid-list SF writer selling fifteen thousand copies, with a correspondingly higher advance. They\u2014and already you can see how I enter into the dangerous territory of generalities just using a pronoun\u2014can also be envious of the ease with which much genre material makes the transition into pop culture, and into media such as movies, comics, and television.\nThe fact is, we all have our wounds, our defeats, our Waterloos. We all look up ahead at some person or group that seems to be doing better than us in some way. The trouble occurs when we perpetuate clich\u00e9 and stereotype and received ideas as if they were immutable truth, or commonsense, or even, god forbid, wisdom.\nDo you know why? Because when enough people keep saying something, the weight of those words becomes a kind of perceptional reality, and not only do we lose opportunities to build something unique and fresh, but we also make the world a duller, less interesting place. We deny the true complexity of the world, and our place in it.\nBut perhaps just as importantly, the continual perpetual motion machine of this kind of approach wastes our time and saps our energy. It is a quintessentially negative message that moves the average reader, not versed in the stylized symbolism of the ghetto, to two main reactions: pity for the downtrodden and wanting to help the poor victim do better, usually with lots of helpful suggestions that have been trotted out and tried a thousand times before. (Besides, the panelists tackling such questions at conventions don\u2019t really want answers\u2014they just want to wallow in the lovely misery of being victims.)\nWhen that happens, the messenger and the receiver of the message become trapped in the old paradigm. Instead of a genuine and articulate discussion that is, as much as possible, about the books or authors being examined, we enter into an argument that is mostly about defenses, battlements, territorialism, and pettiness.\nIt is easy to fall into cynicism and become fatalistic. Sometimes, there are perfectly honest catalysts that create an outlook of this kind. But that doesn\u2019t mean we have to live in that place, or make other people live there.\nTen Books for \u201cMainstream\u201d Readers\n- The Gormenghast Trilogy by Mervyn Peake\n- Use of Weapons by Iain M.

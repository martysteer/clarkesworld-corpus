I\u2019d sold the scrap en route and left it in geo-sync orbit above Constance, Altair III, for the merchant to collect. The funds were already in my account and I was treating Ella and Karrie to a meal and a few drinks.\nA pianist was improvising Lyran mood-music and the ceiling pulsed with images of Jovian superstorms. Across the spaceport, starships were phasing into and out of the void in eerie silence.\nWhile Ella was at the bar, Karrie said, \u201cFor an AI, you know, she\u2019s almost . . . well, human.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s running on a self-aware paradigm, Karrie. That paradigm is human. She has all the emotional capacity of you and me. As far as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s our equal.\u201d\nKarrie just looked at me.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.\n\u201cTalking about emotional capacity, Ed . . . Have you ever considered your own?\nI stared at her. \u201cMine?\u201d\n\u201cHave you heard of the expression \u2019a cold fish\u2019?\u201d\nYou can know someone for years\u2014in this case almost ten\u2014and still be amazed at how they view you. \u201cMe? What on earth makes you think that?\u201d\nShe enumerated her argument with calloused fingers. \u201cOne, you never talk. I mean about things that matter, your feelings, your emotions. You never allow people into your head.\u201d\nI said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to go there. It\u2019s full of day-to-day rubbish. Nothing deep going on in there.\u201d\n\u201cYou see\u2014there you go again. Trivializing what is important. Two,\u201d she went on before I could protest, \u201cyou never talk about your past, what\u2019s affected you. Three, you rarely speak about the future, what you want\u2014other than the next big haul.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what wrong with talking about the next big haul?\u201d I said dismissively.\nKarrie snorted.\nI was glad to see that Ella was returning with a tray of drinks. As she slinked through the crowd, I noticed a few men and women covertly eyeing her slim body. She slipped into the booth, smiling at me.\n\u201cWhat do you think, Ella?\u201d Karrie said, taking her drink.\nOh, God . . . I thought.\n\u201cAbout what, Karrie?\u201d\n\u201cAbout Ed. Do you think he has deficient emotional capacity?\u201d\nElla looked from Karrie to me, her expression serious. She said, \u201cI think his emotional capacity is far from deficient, Karrie. What is deficient is his ability to express, to show, those emotions. I suspect some past trauma is inhibiting him in this respect.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cMaybe you will tell us about it, one day?\u201d\nKarrie was smirking at this turn in the conversation.\nI said, \u201cWell, thanks. Here I was, enjoying a quiet drink with my crewmates, when everything gets suddenly psychoanalytical. Listen, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me, emotionally or otherwise. I have no hang-ups, no inhibitions. I\u2019m happy Ed, the salvageman . . . \u201d\nI raised my glass. \u201cAnyway, here\u2019s to many another successful haul.\u201d\nAround then I noticed the figure in the Orion warware spacesuit. It was moving from group to group of drinkers, talking to them briefly and then moving on. From the dismissive gestures of the people spoken to, I received the impression that whoever was in the suit was asking for something, and being turned down.\nA minute later the figure perched itself on a stool at the opening of the booth and stared in at us.\nI say \u2019stared\u2019, but I only assumed that. The oval faceplate in its sleek, silver helmet was as milky as opal. Its silver suit was streamlined and body-hugging, the surface swarming with millions of nanoware-bots like iron filings in oil.\nFrom its shape, I guessed there was a woman in there.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Karrie asked brusquely.\n\u201cI find myself in a difficult situation,\u201d it said. Its voice was feminine, but transistorized. For all I knew, the inhabitant of the suit might not even be human.\nShe went on, \u201cI need to leave Constance, but I cannot locate a ship heading in the direction I require.\u201d\nBefore Karrie could jump in with some sarcastic comment, I asked, \u201cAnd where\u2019s that?\u201d\nA hesitation, then, \u201cThe Chandrasakar Stardrift.\u201d\nI whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a way away.\u201d\n\u201cFive thousand three hundred light years, give or take.\u201d\nKarrie shook her head, derisive, and took a long swallow of beer.\n\u201cWhere specifically in the Stardrift?\u201d I said.\n\u201cA planet called Serimion, Kharran II.\u201d\n\u201cSerimion . . . \u201d I said. \u201cNow where have I heard the name before?\u201d\nElla said, quick as a flash, \u201cSerimion: site of the war between human colonists and the native inhabitants of the Kharran system. It was a particularly brutal and bloody conflict. The alien race known as the Kha, from the fifth planet of the system, invaded without provocation. Approximately three million humans lost their lives on Serimion.\u201d\nThe person in the suit said, \u201cPrecisely three million, two hundred thousand and ninety. Let no lost soul go unmourned.\u201d\nI asked the obvious question. \u201cBut why do you want to go to Serimion?\u201d\nThe being hesitated again, before saying, \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d\n\u201cBut won\u2019t it be dangerous? I mean, won\u2019t the Kha be hostile to human arrivals?\u201d\n\u201cThey allow a certain number of mourners and war historians to visit the shrines of Serimion every year,\u201d she said.\nI wondered which category she fell into.\nI considered for a minute, then said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a long way, and not where we were heading . . . The fare would be hefty.\u201d\nA silence. The opalescent faceplate turned to me, and the soft, feminine, transistorized voice said, \u201cThat is the other slight problem. I am without the funds to finance the journey.\u201d\nKarrie snorted and shuffled from the booth. \u201cI\u2019ll be back at the ship, Ed.\u201d She stood and hurried from the bar.\nThe milky oval of the faceplate, behind which anything might be lurking, was still regarding me.\nI said, \u201cA lack of funds is certainly a problem. I don\u2019t see how . . . \u201d\nThe figure pointed to my flight-suit. \u201cI see you bear the sigil of a salvage captain. There is a small starship, a strike vessel, drifting in orbit around Serimion. It belongs to me. You may take it in recompense if you agree to transport me there.\u201d\nI looked at Ella, who said, \u201cWhat kind of strike vessel, exactly?\u201d\n\u201cA Corinthian, Class II.\u201d\nElla said to me, \u201cEven badly damaged, it would fetch approximately twenty-five thousand Altairian units on the open market.\u201d\nWhich would more than cover the cost of the return journey to the Chandrasakar Stardrift.\nOf course, there was no way of telling if the being in the suit was telling the truth.\nI said, \u201cShow me your face.\u201d\nAfter a moment, on some internal command, the faceplate cleared.\n\u201cYou\u2019re human?\u201d I stared at the pretty, impish face revealed; dark, short hair, high cheekbones, a snub nose. She looked no older than twenty.\n\u201cBut why the suit?\u201d I asked.\nShe shrugged, twisted her lips uncomfortably. \u201cI . . . I have a certain condition. My immune system is dysfunctional.\u201d And she left it at that.\nShe looked at me, hope evident in her big brown eyes. \u201cWell . . . ?\u201d\nI said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cKaterina,\u201d she replied. \u201cKaterina Reverte.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Katerina . . . Why don\u2019t you give me five minutes to discuss things with my co-pilot here?\u201d\nKaterina nodded, rose and strode across to the floor-to-ceiling viewscreen that looked out over the expanse of the spaceport. Reduced in the perspective, she looked tiny, vulnerable.\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think the situation is certainly odd. She is wearing an Orion warware suit, which is even more expensive than a Corinthian. She could sell the suit, which would more than pay for her medical treatment. It would also pay for her return to Serimion.\u201d\n\u201cYou think she\u2019s lying about her condition?\u201d\n\u201cThat is certainly a possibility.\u201d\n\u201cAnd about the Corinthian, too?\u201d\n\u201cImpossible to ascertain.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cIt\u2019d be a risk.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to know the reason she wishes to return to Serimion.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cMy guess is she fought in the war. She wishes to return to lay ghosts, to revisit old battlefields . . . \u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cWell, perhaps we\u2019ll find out along the way.\u201d\nElla fixed me with one of her impassive stares. \u201cYou will agree to take her?\u201d\nI nodded, and looked across the lounge to the suited figure. Katerina had turned and was watching us. I signaled her over.\nShe came hesitantly, almost wincing. I held out my hand. \u201cWe phase out in five hours,\u201d I told her.\nHer expression, behind the faceplate, was joyous.\nKarrie took a while to simmer down, even when I told her about the Corinthian.\n\u201cBut you know nothing about her! Who she is, what she is! She\u2019s striding around here in that damned war suit . . . you realize how powerful those things are?\u201d\nI shrugged. We were a day out of Altair III, sailing through the marmoreal realm of void-space, two days away from the Chandrasakar Stardrift.\nKarrie went on, \u201cWhy did you agree, Ed?\u201d\nI shrugged again. \u201cShe\u2019s young, vulnerable. Everyone else back there had turned her down.\u201d\nShe stared at me. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe you . . . \u201d\nI smiled at her. \u201cWhat did you say back at the port, that I didn\u2019t show my emotions? Well, I\u2019m showing them now. I feel sorry for the kid and I want to help her\u2014\u201d\nKarrie pointed at me. \u201cThis has nothing to do with your emotions, Ed, and all to do with your male biology.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit, Karrie!\u201d\nElla chose that moment to slip through the hatch and cross the flight-deck. She eased into her sling with a smile at me. \u201cFor two people who have been in each other\u2019s company for almost ten years,\u201d she said, softly, \u201cyou spend a lot of time in altercations.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what ten years of being banged up with a sarcastic, sour-faced cynic like Karrie does to you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd fuck you, too,\u201d Karrie spat.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Ella said, \u201cthe drives are functioning at ninety-eight per cent efficiency, the smartcore reports no problems, and mechanically all aboard the ship is running smoothly.\u201d Did I discern the stress she put on the word mechanically?\nUnder her breath, Karrie muttered, \u201cAnd you\u2019d know about that, girl,\u201d but if Ella heard her, she chose to turn the other cheek.\n\u201cHave you had a chance to talk to Katerina?\u201d I asked.\nElla nodded. \u201cI took her on a tour of the ship.\u201d\n\u201cLearn anything?\u201d\n\u201cVery little. She said she was born and brought up on Serimion, but when I asked about the war, and whether she fought in it, she clammed up.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know much about Serimion?\u201d\n\u201cMy cache has an extensive file on the planet: settled by humans over two centuries ago, a pastoral place of vast agricultural concerns, a million villages, considered by the rest of the Expansion to be technologically backward. It was settled by a breakaway faction of the Amish community of Mars. The attack by the neighboring Kha came out of the blue.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no one has ever found out why the aliens invaded?\u201d\nElla shrugged. \u201cA motive was never discovered. That\u2019s what rankles with the survivors to this day, as well as the terrible loss.\u201d\nShe fell silent and stared through the viewscreen at the grey void.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go talk to Katerina,\u201d I said.\nAs I slipped from my sling and approached the hatch, Karrie said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have difficulty getting that suit off her, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking about. Seems she\u2019s welded to the damned thing.\u201d\nI bit my tongue and pulled myself through the hatch, wondering what Karrie\u2019s problem was.\nAs I descended the ladder, I heard Ella saying, \u201cYou should cease your criticism of Ed. He is, after all, biologically impelled by male drives.\u201d\nAnd I\u2019d thought Ella was on my side . . .\nI found Katerina in the observation lounge. She was seated before the great curving viewscreen, staring into the void. She had the cowed aspect of a devotee at a temple, a worshipper in a cathedral of the infinite.\n\u201cDo you mind . . . ?\u201d I asked, gesturing at the foam-form beside her.\nShe looked up. \u201cNo, please. Be my guest.\u201d\nI sat down beside her and saw that her faceplate was once again blank.\n\u201cElla told me she\u2019d shown you around the ship.\u201d I stared at her sleek silver suit, wondering at its power.\n\u201cShe gave me a guided tour.\u201d She paused, then went on, \u201cShe is an AI, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cYes, but one running on a self-aware paradigm.\u201d\nShe turned her faceless faceplate to me and said, \u201cDoes that make her human, Ed?\u201d\nI smiled and shrugged. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know, Katerina. It does make her a sentient being. And my equal. That\u2019s what matters to me.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cWill you apologize to Ella for me, Ed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cFor my inability to . . . to talk to her openly. She wanted to talk, I sensed, but I was unable to respond.\u201d\n\u201cBecause she wasn\u2019t human?\u201d I asked.\nInstead of replying, she retuned her gaze to the infinite. A little later she said, \u201cDo you believe in vitalism, Ed? The idea that\u2014\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cI know what vitalism means.\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps, once, I did. It\u2019s a nice idea, after all, to think that humans are imbued with a special, God-given light of fire, vitality, soul . . . \u201d\n\u201cPerhaps once?\u201d she said. \u201cBut no longer?\u201d\nI smiled. \u201cThen I met Ella and I had to rearrange my thinking a little.\u201d\n\u201cSo you think that life can exist without that vitality?\u201d\n\u201cLook at Ella,\u201d I said.\nShe turned to look at me. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cbut is Ella truly alive?\u201d\nI shrugged, and let out a long sigh, out of my depth and uncomfortable. I said, \u201cWhat about you? Do you believe in vitalism?\u201d\nShe turned her head to me and said, \u201cOh, I know vitalism is real.\u201d\nI nodded. Ella had informed me that the Serimion colony had been religious.\nShe went on, in her own time, \u201cI was brought up believing in a just God, a God who punished the bad and rewarded the good. We were a peaceful people. We practiced non-violence, living within our means, at one and in harmony with our environment, our world. We knew how lucky, how God-blessed we were in settling on Serimion, and we gave thanks.\u201d\nBeyond the viewscreen, the grey void swirled. There were times when I thought I discerned patterns in the marmoreal streaks in the infinite, and others when I knew that the void was purely random and chaotic.\nKaterina went on, softly, \u201cI was brought up on a big farm, run by my parents. I had four older brothers . . . They treated me like a princess.\u201d I\u2019m sure, had I been able to see her face, I would have witnessed her smiling. \u201cWe worked hard and worshipped daily, and life was bountiful and good. We knew our neighbors and trusted them. They were like us. I never really apprehended that there was an outside world . . . another way of doing things. Even when I graduated from school and attended college . . . all the world was one, one belief, one way of doing things. And then . . . \u201d\nAnd then, I thought, the Kha attacked.\n\u201cI was on holiday with friends at the time. We were in a resort on an island far to the south. This saved my life. We were aware that something terrible had happened . . . the firestorms in the atmosphere, the explosions. We saw their attack ships in the distance. When we returned to the mainland . . . \u201d\nShe fell silent. I reached out and laid my big hand over her small, cold silver mitt.\nShe went on, \u201cDevastation. Destruction. All the cities, every one of them, all the small towns . . . destroyed. Firebombed, and worse . . . They\u2019d used weapons we didn\u2019t even understand. Reducing people and places to dust . . . We never stood a chance. We didn\u2019t even . . . didn\u2019t even have an army.\u201d She fell silent. Then: \u201cI returned home, or to what was left of it. I found my parents, my four brothers. They were dust, Ed, with just scraps of clothing here and there to identify them.\u201d\nI let a respectful interval elapse, then said, \u201cHow did you get off planet?\u201d\n\u201cA Federation ship had monitored the attack and sent rescue rafts. All told, just seven thousand of us survived. We\u2014well, a few thousand of us\u2014decided to fight back. Our rage, our grief, overcame our pacific instincts, our long-held beliefs. We had assets lodged in banks across the Expansion, and we bought attack ships and . . . \u201d she raised her hand, \u201cand state-of-the-art warware. And we returned to Serimion and fought the Kha.\u201d\nI said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nShe turned her helmet toward me. \u201cWe lost.\u201d\nSeconds, then minutes elapsed. We were alone with our separate thoughts as we stared into the void.\nA while later I said, \u201cAnd vitalism, Katerina? Your certainty . . . ?\u201d\nShe turned to look at me. \u201cI know it\u2019s real, Ed, because of what happened to me in orbit around my homeplanet.\u201d And she left it at that and hung her helmeted head.\nI hesitated, then asked, \u201cWhat happened, Katerina?\u201d\nShe just shook her head, silently.\nI squeezed her gloved hand, and thought it wise to leave her to her memories.\nI returned to the flight-deck and was relieved to see that Karrie was not there.\nElla hung in her sling, her head flung back, the whites of her eyes showing.\nShe sensed my presence and came back from whichever cyber-realm she\u2019d been inhabiting. \u201cI was integrating with the ship\u2019s smartware core, Ed,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.\nI smiled to myself, wondering at the process which allowed her to commune with my ship\u2019s logic matrix.\nI said, \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Katerina. She told me about what happened on Serimion.\u201d I told Ella what Katerina had said about the attack, her return to fight the Kha. Her defeat.\n\u201cWhich makes me all the more curious as to why she wishes to return there, Ed.\u201d\nI shook my head, and then found myself reaching out and taking Ella\u2019s hand. It was small, warm, and very human. I held it tight and said, \u201cElla, when I was young . . . my sister died. That\u2019s another story. I don\u2019t want to talk about it now.\u201d\nShe stared at me with her big brown eyes. \u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d\nI took a breath. \u201cAfter what happened, I found myself drawn back to the place where Maria died. I was compelled. I couldn\u2019t explain why. It was the place where she\u2019d last been alive; perhaps that was it. Perhaps I thought I might commune with whatever of her remained. Silly, I know. But anyway, I had to go back. And you know something? When I did, when I went back and stood on that spot, and thought of my sister and the silly accident that robbed her of her life, and when I cried . . . well, I felt a lot better for doing so.\u201d I squeezed Ella\u2019s hand. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s why Katerina\u2019s going back? Can you understand that, Ella?\u201d\nShe returned my gaze with her lustrous eyes. \u201cYes, Ed,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I understand perfectly.\u201d\nOne thousand Kha sentinels, grey and monolithic and as vast as ten city blocks, hung in space around the defeated planet of Serimion.\nMy ship\u2019s smartware core spoke in its soothing, feminine contralto. \u201cKha AIs have established contact, Ed. They wish to know the purpose of our visit.\u201d\n\u201cTell them that we\u2019re here to pay our respects to the human dead,\u201d I said, \u201cand we seek clearance to land on Serimion.\u201d\nWe eased to a halt beside one of the sheer grey monoliths, and waited.\nFramed within the girdle of sentinels, the planet tilted ten degrees off its polar axis, blue and white and twice the size of Earth.\nElla said, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to finding out what might be down there,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the Kha let us through, that is.\u201d\nKarrie joined us on the flight-deck and eased herself into her sling.\nI said, \u201cSo, our passenger proved the security risk you mentioned, Karrie?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help the jibe.\nShe looked at me. \u201cNo, but there\u2019s something seriously wrong with the girl.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ella asked.\n\u201cHave you noticed she doesn\u2019t eat? It\u2019s been three days since leaving Constance, and I\u2019ve taken six trays of food to her berth. She hasn\u2019t touched a thing.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cSo . . . the girl wasn\u2019t hungry. She\u2019s returning to the place where her family, her people, were massacred, after all.\u201d\nElla turned in her sling. \u201cEd,\u201d she said, almost reluctantly. \u201cThere is something else that doesn\u2019t quite ring true. Physically, Katerina appears to be twenty, twenty-five years old.\u201d\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been double-checking the records. The Kha attacked Serimion twenty-five years ago.\u201d\nI stared down at the slowly rotating planet. I recalled Katerina\u2019s youthful, elfish face within her helmet.\nKarrie said, \u201cSeems to me like the girl\u2019s been lying to us, Ed.\u201d\nI was about to ask Ella why Katerina might have lied when the smartcore said, \u201cClearance granted. The Kha have issued a two day pass. We must be out of Serimion airspace within forty-eight hours.\u201d\nMinutes later Katerina joined us on the flight-deck. She stood between my sling and Ella\u2019s and stared through the viewscreen at her homeplanet.\nShe had cleared her faceplate, and her youthful face stared out, her eyes wide in wonder.\n\u201cI have the co-ordinates for the Corinthian,\u201d she said, and reeled off a series of numbers to Ella.\nWe eased past the sentinel. I was glad to leave the cold, inhuman monolith in our wake. Ten minutes later, Ella pointed. Through the viewscreen we made out the becalmed wreck of the Corinthian, nose down in relation to the planet, ragged holes puncturing its fuselage.\nKarrie said, \u201cAnd you survived that?\u201d\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t,\u201d Katerina said, softly.\nI said, \u201cOkay, Ella. Stow those co-ordinates and we\u2019ll tractor beam the Corinthian on the way out.\u201d I turned to Katerina. \u201cNow, where do you want us to land?\u201d\n\u201cNo one has ever seen the Kha,\u201d Katerina told us. \u201cThey have had no contact with the Human Expansion, and do not allow visitors to their homeplanet. When they struck Serimion, they did so from altitude. Later, when we returned and engaged them in battle, we saw their ships but never the Kha themselves. The few Kha vessels we managed to destroy exploded in space, so no alien remains were ever discovered.\u201d She paused, then went on, \u201cSome say the Kha resemble devils, others maintain they are insectoid. To me, it does not matter. The very sound of their name conjures absolute evil.\u201d\nWe were drifting slowly over the planet\u2019s vast southern continent. Ruined villages and townships punctuated the green continuity of the veldt. Roads and rivers threaded the landscape, but nothing moved down there. Absolute stillness greeted our gaze, and I could not help but think of the planet as a cemetery without gravestones.\nWe floated towards the planet\u2019s equator, where Katerina\u2019s family had farmed the land. Veldt turned to rainforest, a vast tangle of alien vines and great gnarled, crimson trees, and then the rainforest gave way to a range of purple mountains that ran parallel to a great rift valley. Between these geographic features stretched a plain of fertile land that was Katerina\u2019s birthplace.\nElla touched my arm. \u201cLook. Down there.\u201d\nSomething squatted on the plain. I said, \u201cBring us down, slowly.\u201d\nElla eased the ship to within a hundred meters of the thing.\nKaterina said in a tiny voice, \u201cCould it be a Kha?\u201d\nWe hung in the air, observing.\nI could not tell whether it was mechanical or biological. Twenty meters long, perhaps ten high, it was armor-plated with what looked like matte black chitin, domed and segmented and squatting on the ground as if devouring prey.\nFrom what I guessed was its head-section, or what might have been its control center, a long proboscis\u2014or drill\u2014punctured the soil.\nWhether a Kha, or one of their creations, its act was symbolic of the rape of the planet.\nAs we watched, it seemed to shiver with ecstasy, or maybe just mechanical vibration.\nI glanced at Ella. \u201cSound?\u201d\nShe passed her hand over her controls and seconds later a deep ululation filled the flight-deck. It reminded me of the chanting of a thousand monks, resonant and dolorous.\nI asked Ella, \u201cDo you know whether it\u2019s alive, or . . . ?\u201d\nShe went rigid in her sling, her eyeballs rolled to show only their whites as she attempted to communicate with the thing.\nShe shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell. I sense a biological core, surrounded by extensive technological addenda.\u201d\nI looked at Ella, saying nothing.\nIn a tiny voice, Katerina said, \u201cWe revered our planet, Ed. We loved the earth. This . . . this thing is robbing its vitality . . . \u201d\nI reached out to take her gloved hand, but she pulled away. \u201cGet us away from here! I don\u2019t want to . . . \u201d She turned from the viewscreen, holding her helmeted head in her hands.\nElla sped us from the thing, towards the continental rift valley.\nOne hour later we came down on a plain of lush grassland beside the escarpment.\nA hundred meters before the ship was the outline of farm-buildings, and beyond them the geometric pattern of fields, their crops gone wild long ago.\nKaterina said, \u201cI would like a few minutes by myself, Ed. Then, would you come and join me? I have a lot I must explain.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nShe moved from the flight-deck. Minutes later her tiny figure emerged from the shadow of the ship, moving past the ruins of the farmhouse towards the edge of the escarpment.\nShe stood with her arms on her hips and stared about her.\nIn silence, we watched.\nAfter a minute she moved towards a lone tree that grew at an angle, leaning out over the rift valley. It was similar to those I had seen in the rainforest, crimson and contorted, with a vast, spreading leaf canopy.\nShe found a place in its gnarled root system and sat down, staring out across the abyss.\nLike this, very still, she remained for perhaps fifteen minutes.\nAt length she turned and raised a hand, and I took this as a summons.\nElla and Karrie said nothing as I left the flight-deck and climbed down to the air-lock. I cycled myself through and stepped out onto the soil of Serimion. The first thing I noticed was the scent, a heady, spicy mix of soil and flower blooms. The grass, I saw, was embroidered with a spread of tiny yellow flowers, which gave off an almost overpowering perfume as I strode from the ship towards where Katerina sat.\nAt one point I paused and looked back. Ella and Karrie stood before the viewscreen, gazing down at me like figures in an aquarium.\nI passed into the shade of the great leaning tree and picked my way through the knuckled roots until I came to the girl. I sat down beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful world, Katerina.\u201d\nShe turned to me. Her youthful face showed behind her faceplate, and she smiled. \u201cIt was even more beautiful, Ed, before they attacked.\u201d\nI looked away, and then saw, standing among the raised roots on the edge of the escarpment, six simple wooden crosses.\nShe saw the direction of my gaze and said, \u201cWe had a custom on Serimion, Ed. We buried our dead beside trees, and this was my parent\u2019s favorite place on the planet. At sunset they would come out here with a drink and just sit and admire the view.\u201d\nThe silence stretched. A gentle, warm wind picked up the scent of the flowers and swamped us.\nShe said, \u201cAfter the attack, I drove back here from the southern coast, passing devastated towns and knowing what I would find . . . The farm was destroyed, looking much as it does now. I found no personal possessions, no mementos . . . Perhaps that was a good thing. To have found objects that belonged to mother and father and my brothers, that would have been too much. Now, I would like something to remind me . . . \u201d She turned and smiled at me. \u201cIs that silly?\u201d\nI returned her smile. \u201cNot at all, Katerina.\u201d\n\u201cI found what was left of my family . . . or perhaps I was kidding myself. I found scraps of clothing, and dust, and scooped it up and carried it over here and buried it beside the tree, then planted wooden crosses I made from what remained of the farmhouse. I even said prayers, and then vowed to get my revenge.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was hours or days before I was found by a rescue ferry and taken to the nearest human colony world.\u201d She waved. \u201cAnyway, two years later I did come back, in this suit, in the Corinthian, and I did exact a futile, limited form of revenge. I destroyed two Kha craft and then, and then . . . \u201d\nShe gathered herself, then went on, \u201cAnd then a Kha fighter struck, and disabled the Corinthian, and left me for dead. A rescue vessel picked me up, took me back to the colony world . . . \u201d\nShe gazed down at the forlorn row of crosses. From this angle, I could not see her face.\n\u201cI said I had a lot to explain, Ed.\u201d\n\u201cThe attack happened twenty-five years ago,\u201d I said, \u201cand yet your face is that of a woman of twenty. You never eat, never open your suit . . . \u201d\nShe turned her helmet and looked at me. Behind the faceplate I could see silver tears tracking down her cheeks. She raised a gloved hand and stared at it. \u201cThese suits were the latest Orion warware. They were made to help a fighter fight, augmented with an integrated AI to boost physical reaction time, mental acuity.\u201d She stopped, and her next words surprised me, \u201cDo you know why I came here, Ed?\u201d\nI said, \u201cTo pay respects, to . . . to lay the ghost?\u201d\nShe laughed, briefly. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I like that. Yes, to lay the ghost.\u201d She stared at me. \u201cI came to this gravesite to bury myself.\u201d\nI stared at her, and watched as she lifted her gloves to her helmet and touched a control at the neck. The helmet opened slowly, folding out in sections, blooming like a flower. At some point in the process the hologram showing her youthful face flickered off. And I stared, unable to believe what I was seeing.\nA skull sat askew on the notched column of her vertebrae, grinning out at me.\nIt was all I could do not to back away in shock. I almost retched.\nHer voice, her soft, feminine voice, continued, \u201cThese are fighting suits, Ed. And they go on fighting when the fighter within them is technically dead. Shrapnel punctured an elbow seal in the suit when my Corinthian was attacked, and I died of asphyxiation. I was cerebrally integrated with the suit\u2019s AI, and it uploaded my memories into its operating system . . . and I would have gone on fighting, if the Corinthian had been capable.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Christ, Katerina.\u201d\n\u201cFor two days after the attack, when I was rescued and taken back to the colony world, I thought I\u2019d managed somehow to survive. And then a medic broke it to me, and opened my suit, and . . . \u201d\nHer gloved hand lifted, indicated the grinning skull.\n\u201cYou cannot begin to imagine the shock, Ed, the terror.\u201d\nI could only shake my head and bite my lips in an effort to stem my tears. I stared at the lop-sided skull, and it stared back at me, its orbits huge and shadowy. I wanted to get to my feet and run, but my legs felt weak and bile rose, acid, in my throat.\nShe said, \u201cI told you that I believe in vitalism, in the soul, because of what had happened to me. I am less than human, now, a mere mechanical set of stored memories and emotions.\u201d\nShe reached up, took her skull in her gloved hands and lifted it from her spine. She lowered the skull to her lap, where it sat gazing blindly out across the abyss.\n\u201cThe terrible, terrible thing is, Ed, that in my heart . . . or whatever passes for my heart now . . . I know that vitalism is a fact. Because now I am reduced.\u201d She touched the chest of her suit, and slowly its torso opened, two flanges hinging outwards to reveal a chaotic jackstraw assemblage of bones within.\nShe leaned forward, over the skull in her lap, and with both hands scooped a hollow in the fine earth before the closest cross. I watched, appalled yet fascinated, as she placed her skull in the grave, then reached into the cavity of her chest and one by one withdrew her bones.\nShe raised her right arm and her ulna and radius, then her smaller metacarpal bones, rattled into the suit\u2019s torso. She did the same with her left arm, and collected the bones and laid them, reverently, in the grave. Next she split a seam in her legs and withdrew the femur and tibia from her right leg, along with the smaller bones, and then the left, and I closed my eyes and wept.\nWhen I looked again she was covering the bones with soil to create a small, compact mound.\nShe turned her suit to face me, and her disembodied voice said, \u201cHumans, Ed, are far more than mechanistic machines. I know this because of what I am now. Although I have the memories of what happened, I do not have the ability to feel real emotion, to grieve.\u201d\nI wanted to tell her that she could be upgraded, that AIs had developed so much over the past twenty-five years. I wanted to tell her that she could be made human.\n\u201cI had a lover, a young man who fought alongside me and survived. While I was in hospital, he came to see me. I had just been told what I had become, and I showed him . . . \u201d She paused, then went on, \u201cEd, the look on his face, the horror, before he fled . . . \u201d She turned her opened helmet to me. \u201cBut for all I could intellectually appreciate what he might be feeling, I could not find it within me to empathize. And I felt . . . nothing.\u201d\nThe silence stretched, and I could find not one word to comfort her.\nThe sun was setting behind the far horizon, laying down gorgeous laminates of tangerines and pinks. Far below us, shadows turned the abyss into a dark, inky pit.\nAt last she said, \u201cI came here to bury myself, and I came here also to die.\u201d\nAnd she reached into the cavity of her chest and pulled out two slim columns. She held them up before me. \u201cThe suit\u2019s energy system, Ed. Without them the suit will run down in hours.\u201d\n\u201cKaterina . . . \u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I want. Peace at last. I can\u2019t feel grief. I can\u2019t feel sadness or pain. Or joy, or happiness, or love . . . All I have is the memories of these emotions. Now is the time I have dreamed of for so long. To die, here.\u201d\nShe took the silver columns, drew back her arm and flung them into the rift. I watched them sail through the air, end over end, catching the dying sunlight as they fell.\nShe hunched forward, hands upturned in her lap, her open helmet bowed as if in supplication.\nShe said, softly, \u201cI can feel myself slowing down already, Ed, and it is wonderful.\u201d\n\u201cKaterina, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n\u201cNo, please go. And say to Ella . . . tell her that I\u2019m sorry, so sorry.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye, Katerina.\u201d\nShe failed to respond, and I reached out and took her gloved hand for one last time, then stood and made my way through the root system of the great tree towards the ship. I stopped, once, and looked back, but the woman who had been Katerina Reverte was now no more than an empty Orion warware suit, seated on the edge of an abyss.\nI heard the hatch of the ship hiss open, and Karrie stepped out and faced me. Her eyes were hard, questioning, and I knew I could not bring myself to describe what had happened, yet.\n\u201cEd?\u201d\nI hurried past her, and stopped before the hatch. Ella had appeared, and was watching me. Her expression was unreadable. She said, \u201cI listened, Ed. I heard what Katerina told you.\u201d She reached out her arms towards me. \u201cAnd I just want to say that I understand your pain.\u201d\nAt the sight of her standing there, so slight and vital and human, something broke within me\nI stepped forward, and took her in my arms, and wept.\nEric Brown began writing when he was fifteen and sold his first short story to Interzone in 1986.

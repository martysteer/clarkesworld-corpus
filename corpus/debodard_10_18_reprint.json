Ai Thi sees the words take root: the tension leaves the air, the tautness of people\u2019s worries and anger drains out of them, and they relax, faces slack, eyes closed, all thoughts in perfect harmony. The appeaser shifts and twists within Ai Thi, a familiar rhythm of little bubbles in her gut, almost as if she were pregnant with her daughter Dieu Kiem again.\n The worst enemy is the enemy within, because it could wear the face of your brother or mother.\n Loyalty to the Everlasting Emperor should be stronger than the worship offered to ancestors, or the respect afforded to parents.\n The words aren\u2019t meant for Ai Thi: they go through her like running water, from the appeaser to her to the passengers on the train. She\u2019s the bridge\u2014the appeaser is lodged within her, but they\u2019re an alien being and need Ai Thi and her fellow harmonizers to speak the proper language, to teach them the proper words.\n Ai Thi knows all the words. Once, they were the only thing that kept her going.\n It is the duty of children to die for their parents, and the duty of all subjects to give their life for the Everlasting Emperor\u2014though he never asks for more than what is necessary, and reasonably borne.\n Ai Thi has only confused, jumbled memories of her implantation\u2014a white, sterilized room that smells of disinfectant; the smooth voice of doctors and nurses, telling her to lie down on the operating table, that everything will be fine. She woke up with her voice scraped raw, as if she\u2019d screamed for hours; with memories of struggling against restraints\u2014but when she looked at her wrists and ankles, there was no trace of anything, not a single abrasion. And, later, alone in her room, a single, horrifying recollection: asking about painkillers and the doctors shaking their heads, telling her she had to endure it all without help, because analgesics were poison to the appeaser\u2019s metabolism.\n Her roommate Lan says that they do give drugs\u2014something to make the harmonizers forget the pain, the hours spent raving and twisting and screaming while the appeasers burrow into their guts.\n It\u2019s all absurd, of course. It must be false impressions brought on by the drugs and the procedure, for why would the Everlasting Emperor take such bad care of those that serve him?\n Ai Thi remembers waking up at night after the implantation, shivering and shaking with a terrible hunger\u2014she was alone in the darkness, small and insignificant, and she could call for help but she didn\u2019t matter\u2014the doctors had gone home and no one would come, no one remembered she was there. Around her, the shadows of the room seemed to twist and come alive\u2014if she turned and looked away, they would swallow her whole, crush her until nothing was left. She reached for the rice cakes on the table\u2014and they slid into her stomach, as thin and as tasteless as paper, doing nothing to assuage the hunger. Empty, she was empty, and nothing would ever fill that hole within her . . .\n Not her hunger. Not her loneliness. The appeaser\u2019s. Cut off from the communion of their own kind, they so desperately needed contact to live, so desperately craved warmth and love.\n You\u2019re not alone, Ai Thi whispered. You are a subject of the Everlasting Emperor, and he loves you as a father loves his children.\n You\u2019re not alone.\n Night after night, telling them the words from her training, the ones endlessly welling up out of her, like blood out of a wound. The Everlasting Emperor was human once, but he transcended that condition. He knows all our weaknesses, and he watches over us all. He asks only for respect and obedience in return for endless love.\n You\u2014we are part of something so much greater than ourselves: an Empire that has always been, that will always be as timeless as the Heavens. Through us\u2014through the work of hundreds, of thousands like us, it will endure into this generation, and into the next.\n Night after night, until the words became part of the appeaser\u2014burrowed into them as they had burrowed within Ai Thi\u2019s guts\u2014until they ceaselessly spoke in her sleep, giving her back her own words with unwavering strength.\n Beware what you read. The Quynh Federation reaches everywhere, to disseminate their lies: you cannot trust news that hasn\u2019t been vetted.\n Ai Thi gets down at her usual station: White Crane Monastery, close to the barracks. She has one last quadrant to go through on her rounds, Eggshell Celadon, making sure that the families there understand the cost of war fought beyond the Empire\u2019s boundaries, and the necessity of the war effort.\n As she turns into a corridor decorated with a splash of stars, she hears the footsteps behind her. A menial, going to work\u2014a kitchen hand, like Ai Thi used to be before she volunteered\u2014or a sweeper, supervising bots as they clean the quadrant. But at the next corridor\u2014one that holds the machinery of the station rather than cramped family compartments\u2014the footsteps are still here.\n She turns, briefly, catching a glimpse of hempen clothes, torn sleeves, and the glint of metal. From the appeaser, a vague guess that whoever it is is determined: the appeaser can\u2019t read human thoughts, can\u2019t interpret them, or the harmonizers\u2019 and enforcers\u2019 work would be that much simpler. What they know from human behavior, they learned from Ai Thi.\n Captain Giang\u2019s advice to her trainees: always choose the ground for a confrontation, rather than having choice forced on you.\n Ai Thi stops, at the middle of the corridor\u2014no nooks or crannies, no alcoves where her pursuer can hide. Within her the appeaser is silent and still, trying to find the proper words of the Everlasting Emperor for the circumstances, gathering strength for a psychic onslaught.\n She\u2019s expected a group of dissidents\u2014Sergeant Bac said they were getting bolder in the daily briefing\u2014but it\u2019s just one person.\n A woman in shapeless bot-milled clothes, bottom of the range\u2014face gaunt, eyes sunken deep, lips so thin they look like the slash of a knife. Her hands rests inside her sleeves, fingers bunched. She has a knife or a gun. \u201cHarmonizer,\u201d the woman whispers. \u201cHow can you\u2014how can you\u2014\u201d\n Ai Thi spreads her hands, to show that she is unarmed; though it isn\u2019t true. The appeaser is her best and surest weapon, but only used at the proper time. \u201cI serve the Everlasting Emperor.\u201d\n The woman doesn\u2019t answer. She merely quickens her pace. Her hand swings out, and it\u2019s a gun that she holds, the barrel glinting in the station\u2019s light, running towards Ai Thi and struggling to aim.\n No time.\n Ai Thi picks one saying, one piece of wisdom, from all the ones swarming in her mind. The Everlasting Emperor loves all his subjects like children, and it is the duty of children to bow down to their parents.\n Bow down.\n And she lets the appeaser hurl it like a thrown stone, straight into the woman\u2019s thoughts. No subtlety, not the usual quiet influence, the background to everyone\u2019s daily lives\u2014just a noise that overwhelms everything like a scream.\n Bow down.\n The woman falters, even as her gun locks into place: there\u2019s a sound like thunder\u2014Ai Thi throws herself to the side, momentarily deafened\u2014comes up for breath, finding herself still alive, the appeaser within her driving her on.\n Bow down.\n She reaches the woman, twists a wrist that has gone limp. The gun clatters to the ground. That\u2019s the only sound in the growing silence\u2014that, and the woman\u2019s ragged breath. The appeaser within Ai Thi relaxes, slightly. She can feel their disapproval, their fear. Cutting it too close. She could have died. They could have died.\n Ai Thi lifts the woman to her feet, effortlessly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done this,\u201d she says. \u201cWho sent you?\u201d\n She hasn\u2019t expected an answer\u2014the woman\u2019s mind should still be filled with the single message the appeaser used to drown all cognitive function\u2014but the thin, pale lips part. \u201cI sent myself. You\u2014you starve us, and expect us to smile.\u201d\n \u201cWe all sacrifice things. It\u2019s the price to pay for safety,\u201d Ai Thi says, automatically, and then takes another look at the woman. All skin and bones\u2014Ai Thi is strong from training, but the woman hardly weighs anything, and her cheeks are far gaunter than even those of menials\u2014and, as she looks into the woman\u2019s eyes, she sees nothing but raw, naked desperation, an expression she knows all too well.\n Who sent you?\n I sent myself.\n Two years ago, an eternity ago, Ai Thi looked at that same gaze in the mirror, working herself down to the bone for not enough money, not enough food, going to bed hungry every night and listening to Dieu Kiem\u2019s hacking cough, and knowing that no doctor would tend to the poor and desperate. She made a choice, then: she volunteered for implantation, knowing she might not survive it\u2014volunteered to serve the Everlasting Emperor in spite of her doubts. But, if she hadn\u2019t made that choice\u2014if she\u2019d let fear and frustration and hunger whittle her down to red-hot rage\u2014\n This might have been her, with a gun.\n Ai Thi is meant to call for the enforcers, to turn the woman over to them for questioning, so that they can track down and break the dissident cell or foreign agency that sent her. That would be the loyal, righteous thing to do. But . . .\n But she\u2019s been here. She knows there\u2019s no cell\u2014merely the end of a road; a last, desperate gesture that, if it doesn\u2019t succeed, will at least end everything.\n Ai Thi walks back to the barracks with the woman over her shoulder\u2014by then she\u2019s all spent, and lies in Ai Thi\u2019s grip like wrung cloth. Ai Thi lays her down in an alcove before the entrance, a little out of sight. \u201cWait here,\u201d she says.\n By the time Ai Thi comes back, she half expects the woman to be gone. But she\u2019s still there, waiting\u2014she sits on the floor with her legs drawn against her, huddling as though it might make her smaller.\n \u201cHere,\u201d Ai Thi says. She grabbed what she could from the refectory\u2014couldn\u2019t dally, or she\u2019d be noticed: two small rice cakes, and a handful of cotton fish.\n The woman looks at her, warily; snatches all three things out of her hand.\n \u201cGo gently, or you\u2019ll just vomit it.\u201d Ai Thi crouches, watching her. The appeaser within her is quiet. Curious. \u201cIt\u2019s not poisoned.\u201d\n The woman\u2019s laugh is short, and unamused. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was.\u201d She nibbles, cautiously, at the rice cakes; eating half of one before she slips the rest inside her sleeves.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n A hesitation, then: \u201cHien Hoa. You\u2019d find out, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t have supernatural powers,\u201d Ai Thi says, mildly.\n \u201cNo, but you have the powers of the state.\u201d Hoa stops, then; afraid she\u2019s gone too far.\n Ai Thi shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to turn you in. I\u2019d have done it already, if I was.\u201d\n \u201cWhy\u2014\u201d\n Ai Thi shrugs, though she doesn\u2019t quite know what to say. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance, I guess.\u201d She rises, ignoring the twinges of pain in her muscles. \u201cStay out of trouble, will you? I\u2019d hate to see someone else bring you in.\u201d\n Straying from the Everlasting Emperor\u2019s path is a grievous misconduct, but every misconduct can be atoned for\u2014every fault can be forgiven, if the proper amends are made, the proper reeducation achieved.\n To Sergeant Bac, at her debriefing in the squad room, Ai Thi says nothing of Hoa. She heads next to Captain Giang\u2019s office, for her weekly interview.\n The captain sits behind her desk, staring at the aggregated reports of her company, nodding, from time to time, at something that pleases or bothers her. On the desk before her is a simple am and duong logo, a half-black, half-white circle curved in the shape of an appeaser: the emblem of the harmonizers \u201cI see your last checkup was three months ago,\u201d she says.\n Ai Thi nods.\n \u201cYou\u2019re well, I trust?\u201d Captain Giang says\u2014only half a question. \u201cNo stomach pains. No headaches that won\u2019t go away. No blood in your urine.\u201d\n The danger symptoms\u2014the ones Ai Thi could recite by heart\u2014a sign that the delicate symbiosis that links her and the appeaser is out of kilter, and that they could both die. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ai Thi says.\n Giang looks at her, for a while. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like yourself,\u201d she says, frowning.\n She knows. No. There is no way she can know. Ai Thi draws a deep, ragged breath. \u201cThere\u2019s much unease,\u201d she says, finally, a half-truth. \u201cPeople are . . . taut. Like a string about to snap.\u201d And there is only so much slack the harmonizers can pick up, only so much wisdom they can dispense to people whose only thoughts and worries are what they\u2019ll be eating come tomorrow.\n \u201cI see. Why do you think that is?\u201d\n Gaunt eyes, and Hoa\u2019s thin, bruised lips, and the careful way she\u2019s hoarded the food; for giving to someone else. Ai Thi says, finally, \u201cMay I speak freely?\u201d\n \u201cAlways.\u201d Giang frowns. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a jail or a reeducation camp. We trust your loyalty.\u201d\n Of course they do, and of course they can. Ai Thi would never do anything against the Everlasting Emperor: he keeps the fabric of society together. \u201cThe war effort against the Quynh Federation is costly. Food is more and more expensive, and this creates . . . anger. Jealousy. They think the soldiers favored.\u201d And the harmonizers, and the enforcers, and the scholars that keep the machinery of the Empire going.\n Giang doesn\u2019t speak, for a while. Her broad face is emotionless. \u201cThey would,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the soldiers pay dearly for that food. People on the station aren\u2019t at risk of losing limbs or pieces of their mind, or being tortured for information on the Empire.\u201d Ai Thi can feel, distantly, Giang\u2019s own appeaser, a thin thread at the back of her mind, whispering about love and need and duty, all the sayings she already knows by heart.\n She says, \u201cI know this.\u201d\n \u201cAnd they don\u2019t?\u201d Giang sighs. \u201cI\u2019m not questioning your conclusions, private. But as you know, the war isn\u2019t going well. The Everlasting Emperor is going to announce an increase of the war effort.\u201d\n \u201cYou said the soldiers paid for the food because they were at greater risk. But we\u2014\u201d Ai Thi says.\n Giang raises an eyebrow. \u201cAre we not?\u201d Her gaze is sardonic, and Ai Thi remembers Hoa\u2019s gun going off, the thunder filling her ears. \u201cWe\u2019ll be the first against the wall, if things do break down.\u201d It sounds like a warning, though Ai Thi isn\u2019t sure who she means it for.\n Perhaps us, the appeaser whispers, but they barely sound worried. Only about Hoa, which surprises Ai Thi; but of course they would know all about hunger and need.\n \u201cThere\u2019s much unrest,\u201d Giang says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to patrol in pairs\u2014you cover less ground\u2014but it might become necessary. Private Khanh was attacked by a group of three dissidents masquerading as beggars, and only barely escaped.\u201d\n \u201cIs he\u2014\u201d Ai Thi asks, but Giang shook her head.\n \u201cHe\u2019s fine. We didn\u2019t manage to catch them, though.\u201d Giang sounds annoyed. \u201cCinnabar Mansions Quadrant reported two riots in as many weeks. As you said, people are wound taut.\u201d\n \u201cBut we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ai Thi says, before she can think.\n \u201cOf course we will. The Empire has weathered wars and fire and riots long before we were both born,\u201d Giang says. She makes a gesture with her hands. \u201cDismissed, private. Enjoy your rest.\u201d\n It\u2019s only after Ai Thi has left the office, halfway to her room and the light comedy vid she was looking forward to, that she realizes that the warm feeling of utter certainty within her is from Giang\u2019s appeaser.\n The foundations of the Everlasting Empire: the censors, rooting out disinformation from vids and newscasts. The scholars, making the laws everyone must abide by. The harmonizers and enforcers, keeping the fabric of the Empire clear of dissidence. And the soldiers, defending the borders against enemy incursions.\n \u201cThere\u2019s someone at the gates asking after you, lil sis,\u201d Lan says. She laughs, throwing her head back in a gesture so familiar it\u2019s barely annoying anymore. \u201cA menial. From your old life?\u201d\n Lan comes from the Inner Rings, the wealthiest Station inhabitants. She caused some scandal at an examination, and her family gave her the choice of enlisting with the harmonizers, or with the soldiers on the front. She\u2019s Ai Thi\u2019s roommate, and she means well, but sometimes her assumptions about people grate. To wit: Ai Thi didn\u2019t keep contact with anyone from her old workplaces\u2014such attachments aren\u2019t encouraged, in any case.\n It can\u2019t be Second Aunt, because Ai Thi is currently in communication with home, and spoke to her not a minute past. \u201cCan you ask them to wait?\u201d Ai Thi says. Her time for outside calls is almost up, in any case. She turns back to Dieu Kiem. \u201cSorry. Duty calling.\u201d\n Her daughter makes a grimace in her field of vision. She\u2019s a ghostly overlay in Ai Thi\u2019s implants, a tall and willowy girl who seems to have shot up three heads since Ai Thi was last given a permission home. \u201cCaptain Giang.\u201d She looks as though she\u2019s about to laugh. \u201cFine, but can you tell Great Aunt I want the network key?\u201d\n Ai Thi purses her lips. \u201cShe told me you hacked it and had every wall display copies of Huong Trang\u2019s poems. The more explicit ones.\u201d\n \u201cAs practice,\u201d Dieu Kiem snorts. \u201cToo easy.\u201d\n She\u2019s growing up too fast, too strong. Ai Thi wants to tell her to be careful, but there\u2019s nothing illegal or reprehensible in what she\u2019s doing\u2014just harmless pranks, the kind even the Everlasting Emperor would smile upon. But where does dissidence start?\n She has no answer. She logs off in spite of Dieu Kiem\u2019s complaints, promising her that she\u2019ll have a word with Second Aunt\u2014wondering, once again, how time passes, how little she sees of her own daughter.\n Sacrifices aren\u2019t necessary, but they are all the more valued when they do occur.\n The appeaser within her is . . . sad? There\u2019s a peculiar tautness in her mind, as if the entire world were about to come apart. She understands that they\u2019re sad, too, grieving for time lost.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, aloud, shaking her head. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t survive.\u201d\n Warmth from within her; a sated need. The appeaser curls back to their usual, watchful self, chewing on sayings and wisdom they might need for their next patrol.\n Outside the gates, Hoa is waiting for her. Ai Thi fights off the urge to pinch herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThat I\u2019d come back?\u201d Hoa is still gaunt and pale, but there\u2019s a light in her eyes that wasn\u2019t there before. Ai Thi is afraid to ask where it comes from, but Hoa merely shakes her head. \u201cI found a second job.\u201d She grins, waving a basket towards Ai Thi. \u201cAnd I owe you a meal.\u201d\n They walk towards a nearby white space in silence. Ai Thi reaches out, deftly shaping a small corner of it into a lush green space, like the jungles in the stories of her childhood. Hoa sits down at the foot of a huge fig tree, setting down the basket between ghostly roots\u2014Ai Thi hasn\u2019t reshaped reality, merely added a layer of illusion that they share across their implants.\n Inside the basket are four puffed-up dough pieces, and grilled maize. Hoa hands them out, grimacing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if\u2014\u201d she pauses, embarrassed\u2014\u201cif you ate more.\u201d\n Ai Thi guesses the unsaid words. \u201cBecause of the appeaser? A little, but not much.\u201d It\u2019s not like being pregnant. The appeaser is small, and will never grow within her: they have already had their children, the next generation of appeasers raised in tanks for implantation in the next generation of trainees.\n They eat the first fried dough piece in silence, not quite sure what to say to each other. Ai Thi doesn\u2019t know why Hoa came back. She says, finally, \u201cI saw you take the rice cakes. You have a family?\u201d\n Hoa looks at her for a while. \u201cI thought you knew everything.\u201d\n Ai Thi laughs. \u201cI wish. But no. I\u2019m not the Census Office.\u201d\n \u201cA toddler,\u201d Hoa says. \u201cThree years old.\u201d\n \u201cMine is older,\u201d Ai Thi says, with a sigh. \u201cThirteen years old and all opinions.\u201d She\u2019s not sure why she says, \u201cI almost never see her. Duty.\u201d\n Hoa laughs, a little sadly. It doesn\u2019t sound strained or forced, though the atmosphere is still tense. \u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d\n \u201cFrom other harmonizers?\u201d Ai Thi shrugs, and finally speaks the truth. \u201cI was where you are, once. Working in a restaurant in the daytime, and cleaning the corridors at night. Starving myself to feed my child.\u201d\n Hoa is staring at her. \u201cThat\u2019s why you became a harmonizer? For money?\u201d There is . . . an edge to her voice, a hint of disapproval that\u2019s not meant to exist. Captain Giang is right. The fabric of society is fraying.\n \u201cBecause I had nowhere else to go,\u201d Ai Thi says, simply. \u201cBecause . . . because I listened to the voice of the Everlasting Emperor, and he gave me a second chance.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen him,\u201d Hoa says. A question, a challenge.\n \u201cOnce,\u201d Ai Thi says. She doesn\u2019t need to close her eyes to remember. She was standing at the back of the harmonizers\u2019 ranks, and even from there she felt the radiance of his presence, wave after wave of warmth filling her, the world wavering and bending until it was all she could do not to fall on her knees. \u201cHe was everything they say he was, and more.\u201d\n Hoa is silent, for a while. \u201cFaith,\u201d she says, and her voice is full of wonder. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d she shakes her head. \u201cI suppose it takes a lot, to get implanted. May I\u2014\u201d Her hand reaches out, resting close to Ai Thi\u2019s torso.\n Ai Thi nods. Hoa\u2019s fingers rest on her gut, pressing down, lightly. The appeaser gurgles within her\u2014kicks towards Hoa, who withdraws as if burned. The appeaser\u2019s disappointment burns in Ai Thi like acid, spreading outwards through the only channel they know how to use.\n Before the Everlasting Emperor, all citizens are weighed equally: the only thing that matters is their loyalty.\n Hoa takes one, two steps backwards, her face twisting as the full blast of emotions hits her. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re hurt,\u201d Ai Thi says. \u201cBecause you think they\u2019re less than human.\u201d\n Hoa opens her mouth. She\u2019s going to say that of course they\u2019re not human, that they\u2019re just an alien parasite, and all the insults Ai Thi has had hurled at her by dissidents. Ai Thi cuts her off before she can speak, \u201cThey\u2019re lonely. Always lonely. That\u2019s the price they pay for service to the Everlasting Emperor.\u201d\n Hoa closes her mouth. Her face goes through contortions. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And she kneels, hand held out, making it clear that it\u2019s not to Ai Thi she\u2019s apologizing.\n Warmth spreading through Ai Thi\u2014the appeaser. They like her.\n Hoa reaches out, holds out a piece of dough again. \u201cHungry?\u201d she asks.\n Ai Thi eats it. It feels sweeter than honey as it slides down her throat, the appeaser\u2019s approval a small sun within her, spreading to all her limbs\u2014an odd, unsettling, but welcome feeling.\n At length, Hoa speaks, again. \u201cSo they\u2019re starving you, too.\u201d\n Ai Thi shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOf love and kin and warmth.\u201d Hoa\u2019s voice is sad. \u201cHollowing you out, and leaving nothing but words.\u201d\n Ai Thi wants to say something about wisdom, about the Everlasting Emperor, about necessary sacrifices, but the words seem to shrivel in her mouth. Hoa\u2019s burning eyes hold her\u2014the same desperate need she saw in them, back when she almost arrested her, except that it\u2019s . . . pity?\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You shouldn\u2019t be doing this to yourself,\u201d Hoa says again, and it is pity. Compassion. She doesn\u2019t understand, she doesn\u2019t see how much the Everlasting Emperor keeps Ai Thi going, doesn\u2019t understand how much the words mean, how they keep the world together\u2014except that Dieu Kiem is growing up without her, and all that Ai Thi can remember is the appeaser\u2019s desperate, lonely hunger, a bottomless well that nothing can ever fill . . .\n She\u2019s up, and running away from the park before she can think, heedless to Hoa\u2019s calls. She only stops when she gets to her room, breathing hard and feeling as though the air she inhales never reaches her burning lungs.\n The Everlasting Emperor has always been, and will always be. The Empire is as long-lasting as the stars in the heavens. As long as the bonds between mother and daughter, between brother and brother endure, then it, too, shall.\n There\u2019s a noise outside like the roar of the sea. Ai Thi wakes up, and the sound swells to fill her entire universe. \u201cMother? Mother?\u201d\n Dieu Kiem, through her implants. \u201cChild. How did you\u2014\u201d\n Her daughter\u2019s voice is tight, on the verge of panic. \u201cHacked your coms. That\u2019s not the point. Mother, you need to move. They say there are riots all over the station.\u201d\n What\u2014how? Ai Thi fumbles, trying to find something solid\u2014she rubs a hand on her guts, feeling the reassuring mass of the appeaser within her. \u201cChild? Child?\u201d\n Dieu Kiem\u2019s voice comes in fast, words jumbled together. \u201cThe Everlasting Emperor ordered the closure of half the granaries across all quadrants. An enforcer shot someone, and then\u2014\u201d\n \u201cClosure. Why? For the war effort?\u201d Ai Thi asks, but there\u2019s no answer. Nothing but silence on the coms now, but the roar is still there, and she knows it\u2019s that of a crowd massed at the gates. She could call up the outside cameras on her implants, but there\u2019s no point.\n It\u2019s night in the barracks. Lan is on patrol\u2014should be, if she wasn\u2019t caught in the riots. Ai Thi has known for a while that things are taut, but for riots to be this widespread, this fast? Things are bad. Very bad. Ai Thi hits the general alert on the network. She heads to the squad room first, but it\u2019s deserted and silent\u2014and shifts course, to get to Giang\u2019s office.\n She finds the Captain putting on her jacket, straightening her official rank patch on her chest, the eyes of the tiger shining in the dim light. \u201cCaptain\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d Giang\u2019s voice is curt.\n Mankind is but one step away from lawlessness. Only the word of Heaven and of the Everlasting Emperor keeps us from becoming monsters to one another.\n Barely contained panic within Ai Thi\u2014Giang\u2019s appeaser, not hers\u2014hers is silent and watchful, but not surprised.\n \u201cWe have to hold,\u201d Captain Giang says. \u201cWe need to reestablish harmony and order.\u201d She shakes her head. Again that feeling of rising panic within Ai Thi, the edge of something so strong Giang can barely contain it.\n \u201cCaptain\u2014\u201d\n Giang is halfway to the door already. \u201cThere\u2019s no time, private. Come.\u201d\n Something is wrong. Not the riot, not the crowd, not what seems like a station-wide panic. Captain Giang wouldn\u2019t lose her head over that. And she\u2019s not currently broadcasting emotions at Ai Thi. Whatever causes that panic is so strong that it\u2019s simply spilling outwards, like the hurt of Ai Thi\u2019s appeaser when Hoa wouldn\u2019t touch them.\n And why hasn\u2019t she mentioned reinforcements? \u201cCaptain,\u201d Ai Thi says, again. \u201cWe\u2019ll hold, but what about Plum Blossom Company?\u201d\n Giang turns then. For a moment, her composure breaks, and the face she shows to Ai Thi is the white, ashen one of a corpse, a bewildered, lost, and hungry ghost. \u201cThe dissidents have overwhelmed the Palace of Heaven and Earth, private. The Everlasting Emperor is dead.\u201d\n Dead.\n No.\n The roar in Ai Thi\u2019s ears isn\u2019t the sound of the crowd\u2014it\u2019s a long, desperate scream that scrapes her throat raw, and she can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s coming from her or the appeaser.\n \u201cHow can he\u2014\u201d she starts, stops, unable to voice the enormity of it. \u201cHow\u2014\u201d\n Giang has pulled herself together again. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what matters. There are no reinforcements coming, private.\u201d\n Outside, on Ai Thi\u2019s implants, the crowd has trampled the two harmonizers guarding the gates. A press of people is battering at the gates, and it\u2019s only a matter of time until the fragile metal gives way.\n Dead.\n The Empire is as long-lasting as the stars in the heavens, as the bonds of filial duty between parents and children.\n The Empire . . .\n They\u2019ll die, holding the barracks. Die trying to impose harmony on a crowd that\u2019s too large and too big for them to control.\n \u201cCaptain, we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know we can\u2019t hold.\u201d Giang is at the door: she doesn\u2019t turn around anymore. Ai Thi calls up the inside of the gates on her implants, sees another press: Kim Cuc and Tuyet and Vu and half the harmonizers in the barracks in a loose formation that mixes all squads under the orders of Sergeant Bac and Sergeant Hong, sending wave after wave of appeaser thoughts towards the crowd, trying to calm them down. It\u2019s like throwing stones and hoping to stop the ocean.\n Giang says, \u201cWe swore an oath to the Emperor, private. Loyalty unto death.\u201d\n Giang\u2019s appeaser: warmth and contentment within Ai Thi, the satisfaction of duty done to the bitter end. It is the duty of all subjects to give their life . . .\n Within Ai Thi, her appeaser stirs\u2014brings up, not the Everlasting Emperor\u2019s voice, but Hoa\u2019s compassion-filled gaze, Hoa\u2019s voice, a rock against which the other appeaser\u2019s thoughts shatter.\n You shouldn\u2019t be doing this to yourself.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not . . . \u201d Ai Thi says. She\u2019s surprised at how steady her voice sounds.\n \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Giang stops then.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not our duty,\u201d Ai Thi says. \u201cThat\u2019s not how that saying ends, Captain.\u201d\n He never asks for more than what is necessary, and reasonably borne.\n The Everlasting Emperor is dead. There is nothing that says they have to die, too.\n Ai Thi\u2019s appeaser has fallen silent, knowing exactly what she wants. She feels the thoughts from Giang\u2019s appeaser, dancing on the edge of her mind\u2014duty, loyalty, death, a trembling wall she can barely hold at bay for long.\n Giang moves back into her office, comes to stand before her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a discussion, private. It\u2019s an order.\u201d\n Necessary. Reasonably borne. Ai Thi uncoils, then\u2014even as, within her, the appeaser moves\u2014a psychic onslaught centered around a single, pinpoint thought. Giang grunts, goes down on one knee, eyes rolling up in her face, and Ai Thi\u2019s hand strikes her jugular, taking her down.\n Ai Thi stands, breathing hard, over Giang\u2019s unconscious body\u2014for a moment, at a loss at what she\u2019s done, what she should do\u2014but there is only one thing that she can do, after all. The rioters will come for their families next, and neither Second Aunt nor Dieu Kiem have had any training in combat or eluding pursuers. There\u2019s a risk she\u2019ll lead the crowd straight to them, but it\u2019s offset by what she and the appeaser can bring them. She can help. She has to.\n Ai Thi thinks of the other harmonizers, lined against the doors and waiting for them to cave in. She heads towards the squad room. Within her, rising emptiness, a howling need\u2014how will they survive, with the Everlasting Emperor dead\u2014what does wisdom mean, anymore, if its incarnation is no more\u2014nothing, there is nothing left . . .\n In the squad room, there\u2019s only Lan, bloodied and out of breath, who smiles grimly at her. \u201cIt\u2019s a war zone out there. Fortunately they haven\u2019t found the back door yet, but I don\u2019t know how long we can hold.\u201d\n Ai Thi\u2019s voice comes from very far away\u2014a stranger\u2019s, utterly emotionless\u2014because the alternative would be an endless scream. \u201cThe Everlasting Emperor is dead. Captain Giang . . . says to run. To scatter back to our families. There\u2019s no point in holding. We\u2019ve already lost.\u201d\n They\u2019ve lost everything. They\u2014\n For a long, agonizingly long moment, Lan stares at her\u2014as if she knew, as if she could read straight into Ai Thi\u2019s mind. She smiles again, almost with fondness. \u201cFamilies. Of course.\u201d\n Her hand rests, lightly, on Ai Thi\u2019s shoulder, squeezes once, twice. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them, though not everyone will listen. But you run, lil sis.\u201d\n And then she\u2019s gone, and it\u2019s just Ai Thi, walking through empty corridors towards the back of the barracks, the roar of the crowd receding into meaninglessness.\n It\u2019s not too late. She can go out of the barracks\u2014go back the way Lan came from\u2014go get her aunt and daughter before the rioters find new targets\u2014she can run, as fiercely, as far away as she can\u2014to the heart of the Quynh Federation if need be. They can make a new life, one that\u2019s no longer in service to the Everlasting Emperor.\n They can\u2014\n The Emperor is dead, and nothing will ever be right again\u2014the appeaser reaching, again and again, for words, remembering that they mean nothing now.\n \u201cSsh,\u201d Ai Thi says, aloud, to the appeaser. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right. It\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t survive.\u201d And, slowly, gently, sings the lullabies she used to sing to Dieu Kiem when she was a child\u2014again and again as they both run from the shadow of the barracks\u2014again and again until the songs fill the hollow, wordless silence within her.\n Originally published in Infinity Wars, edited by Jonathan Strahan.\n Aliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

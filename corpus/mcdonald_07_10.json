Danny, with his dashing good looks and honey voice, always leads the way. Riding shotgun in Danny\u2019s yellow jeep is Colonel Frank Merullo, United States Air Force. He\u2019s wearing his full NASA spacesuit, including boots, gloves and a closed helmet with reflective shielding. He doesn\u2019t sing along with the gang.\nViolet Blue adjusts her fur-trimmed bikini and drapes her arms around his neck. \u201cLet go and hang loose, Pops! The fun\u2019s just beginning.\u201d\nHer boyfriend Skipper slaps Merullo on the back. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine once he catches his first wave.\u201d\nDanny throws Merullo a dazzling smile, but he\u2019s too busy belting out the chorus to say anything.\nThe Southern California cliffs give way to pristine beach and the limitless blue Pacific. We dump our bags at the beach house and carry our boards over the dunes. The gals claim their territory and break out the baby oil. Most of the guys paddle toward the swells, searching for the perfect wave. Above Colonel Merullo\u2019s head, five seagulls whirl and twirl and call out to each other.\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll come around?\u201d Bonnie asks Danny from their blanket at the center of the action. Bonnie is lovely as always, her hair fixed in a perfect flip and her creamy complexion untouched by the sun. Everyone knows she and Danny will soon marry and settle down to a blissful adult life in the prosperous suburbs. She stares at Merullo, her lips turned in a frown.\n\u201cGive the man some time.\u201d Danny gives her a chaste kiss, grabs his board, and jogs to Merullo. \u201cCome on, Daddy-O! Surf\u2019s up!\u201d\nMerullo opens his helmet faceplate. He is a middle-aged man with a pasty complexion and reddened cheeks. He says, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. I didn\u2019t authorize this Vee-Reel.\u201d\nDanny pats his shoulder. \u201cWhatever that is, you\u2019re hanging with us now.\u201d\n\u201cIs Dr. Naguchi here? Lieutenant Jenny?\u201d Merullo scans the shoreline. \u201cIf this is the crew\u2019s idea of a joke\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t say,\u201d Danny replies. He sprints on down to the water and throws his lean, smooth body into the rolling Pacific. Out at the lineup, Skipper and the others bob in place and wait for the water to rise.\nMerullo says, \u201cComputer, exit program,\u201d but nothing happens. He tries again. The beach remains firmly in place. The ship\u2019s inflight entertainment system is obviously malfunctioning, but the failsafe will engage in sixty minutes. Until then, he\u2019ll have to put up with the surf and sand and silly teenage antics. Lieutenant Jenny will be amused at this virtual misadventure.\nThe weather is always fine at this beach. Beneath the radiant sun, every blanket is shared by a handsome guy and his pretty girl. Lonely singles don\u2019t fit the script. The sandscape is painted with surfers, weightlifters, recording artists, loony biker gangs, foreign spies, unscrupulous businessmen and stray comic icons of yore, like Buster Keaton.\n\u201cNone of this is real,\u201d Merullo tells Bonnie at the counter of the snack shack. He removes his helmet entirely, revealing short brown hair that has gone thin at the dome. \u201cA computer is beaming ultrasonic pulses at my brain, creating this illusion. You\u2019re all data constructs based on old movies pulled out of a database.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Bonnie lifts a tray of hot dogs and French fries. Her bright pink lipstick perfectly matches her sandals and headband. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d\nOver in the volleyball pit, guest star Dee Ann Lawrence is belting out \u201cDon\u2019t Be Fooled by Love,\u201d a song that once made the Billboard top twenty. She\u2019s singing it to Lunkhead, who is the tallest, dumbest of us all. He has a crush on a girl who claims to be a mermaid. No one else has met this creature from the sea.\nMerullo says, \u201cYour character was played by Becky Clark, America\u2019s sweetheart. Danny was played by Tommy Suede, a teenage heartthrob. They made a dozen of these movies, but they died a long time ago.\u201d\nViolet offers Merullo her soda. \u201cHow about something cold to drink? The sun\u2019s real hot today.\u201d\n\u201cThat drink\u2019s not real, either.\u201d Merullo checks the chronometer built into the sleeve of his spacesuit. \u201cIn a minute or so, these pulses will stop and you\u2019ll cease to exist. I\u2019ll wake up in the real world, on my ship. In a flight couch.\u201d\nThe five seagulls squawk and cry from atop the roof of the snack shack. Out in the water, Danny and Skipper have caught an eight-footer and are riding it in with their arms outstretched for balance. Their smiles are as wide as the horizon.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still here,\u201d Violet says to Merullo.\nBonnie shifts her tray of food. \u201cDanny\u2019s lunch is getting cold.\u201d\nMerullo doesn\u2019t move out of her way. \u201cVee-Reel time is sometimes off from ship\u2019s time by a minute or two. It won\u2019t be long now.\u201d\nViolet sips at her soda. Skipper and Danny wade ashore and slap each other on the back. Danny looks for Bonnie, but Skipper has eyes only for Danny. Admiration shines in his expression, as well as something deeper.\nMerullo taps the chronometer. \u201cAny second now.\u201d\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Bonnie says. She and Violet return to their blankets and boyfriends. Danny wraps his arms around Bonnie\u2019s waist and tugs her close.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the colonel doing?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cStill clinging,\u201d Bonnie says.\nSkipper tries to hug Violet, but she squirms free and reaches for her transistor radio. Skipper says, \u201cHe\u2019ll catch on soon enough. Right, Danny?\u201d\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Danny pops a non-existent French fry into his mouth. \u201cGive him awhile. The world is a hard habit to break.\u201d\nEven when the sun sets, the beach party rolls on. The guys shrug into jackets and the gals slip into cocktail dresses. We all gather at Sammy\u2019s Pavilion to sip non-alcoholic drinks at tables set around the dance floor. The evening\u2019s entertainment will consist of a rock\u2019n\u2019roll band or lip-synching actresses or Little Stevie Wonder. Danny might get up and croon a love ballad. Bonnie might join him in a sweet duet. Afterward some of us will walk the moonlit beach or cuddle in secluded coves. Up in the beach house, there will be pillow fights and risqu\u00e9 sleepwear and the trading of double entendres, but nowhere will there be any sex. It doesn\u2019t fit our image.\nSkipper has had a romantic misunderstanding with Violet. Lunkhead\u2019s mermaid girlfriend has flippered her way back into the sea, leaving him bereft. The two of them meander down to the high tide mark and build a fire. Merullo sits with them.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure my crew is working to get me out of here,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll have realized something is wrong by now.\u201d\nLunkhead leans back and crosses his hairy ankles. \u201cWhere\u2019s this spaceship of yours going, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cTo Triton. It\u2019s a moon of Neptune. But even with the new propulsion drive, it\u2019s several years away.\u201d Merullo wedges coconuts into the sand to illustrate the distance between the planets. His bulky spacesuit makes the task difficult. \u201cWe\u2019re in cold sleep most of the trip, but during the first month and last months of the mission we\u2019re awake and can use the ship\u2019s entertainment options. Lieutenant Sanchez built a Vee-Reel around Busby Berkeley musicals. Lieutenant Umbo\u2019s is based on World War II movies. Dr. Naguchi likes anime. Lieutenant Jenny created this one.\u201d\nLunkhead has a goofy grin on his face. \u201cLieutenant Jenny. Sounds like a dreamboat.\u201d\nMerullo\u2019s expression is troubled. \u201cMark Jenny. He\u2019s my co-pilot.\u201d\n\u201cOhhhhhh.\u201d Lunkhead\u2019s grin disappears. \u201cNevermind.\u201d\nSkipper plucks at the strings of his guitar. Melancholy notes float toward the stars. \u201cWhat\u2019s your Vee-Reel, Pops?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Merullo says. It bothers him, that. He should know. \u201cI don\u2019t think I usually play them.\u201d\nLunkhead asks, \u201cBut you like this one, don\u2019t you? Sun and sand. Letting go and hanging loose. What could be better?\u201d\n\u201cSharing it with the one you love.\u201d Skipper strums a soft chord. His eyes are dark and unreadable. \u201cSo why go blasting off into outer space, anyway?\u201d\nMerullo brightens a little. \u201cEighteen months ago, a comet smacked into Triton. Soon afterward, Voyager 20 did a flyby and detected a strong but irregular radio signal in the Leviathan Patera. Our mission was originally geared to catalog prospects for expanding human colonization beyond Mars, but now we\u2019re also going to investigate the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence.\u201d\nLunkhead gapes. \u201cAliens? Little green men with antennas sticking out of their heads?\u201d\n\u201cHey, everyone,\u201d Bonnie says, as she and Danny emerge from the shadows and approach the group. Her lipstick is slightly smeared, and her red chiffon scarf flutters in the breeze.\nDanny crouches by the fire to warm his hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s shaking?\u201d\nSkipper\u2019s gaze slips right past Bonnie to focus on Danny. \u201cWe\u2019re all some kind of computer program on a spaceship hurtling through space. Colonel Merullo here is the only one who\u2019s really alive. And there might be aliens on Mars.\u201d\n\u201cNeptune,\u201d Lunkhead says.\n\u201cTriton,\u201d Merullo corrects.\n\u201cSounds wild,\u201d Danny says, but something in his voice is just a little too casual, and Merullo wonders if he knows more than he\u2019s letting on.\nBut that\u2019s ridiculous, he thinks. Vee-Reel characters have no hidden agendas. They ask him if he wants to come sleep in the beach house for the night, but Merullo declines. The program will surely terminate by then. He leans back in the sand, trying not to worry about his spaceship, his crew, their mission. His dreams are full of stars and blackness. That too is ridiculous. Real people stuck in Vee-Reels do not dream.\nSurf\u2019s up. Five seagulls skim the receding tide, hungry for breakfast.\n\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d Merullo stands over Violet\u2019s blanket, his voice tight with worry. \u201cI have to get out of this. I\u2019m the commander of this mission, my crew need me\u2014\u201d\nViolet holds up a bottle of baby oil. \u201cWill you put some of this on my back?\u201d\nHe tries, but his gloved hands are too clumsy.\nShe sighs. \u201cCome on, Pops. It\u2019s time to ditch these space duds.\u201d\nViolet brings him up to the beach house, which has already emptied out for the morning. She picks through a pile of wrinkled clothes and pulls out some his size. In the bathroom, Merullo eases out of the spacesuit and scratches at his newly exposed, pasty-white skin. The denim shorts are too baggy. The T-shirt smells like the sweat and musk of other men. He takes a deep breath.\nFrom the doorframe, Violet says, \u201cYou don\u2019t like girls much, do you?\u201d\nMerullo flushes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\nShe gives him a humorless smile. \u201cSure you do. Skipper\u2019s that way, too. He keeps promising to change. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can change, like your haircut or the way you dress. Do you?\u201d\nHe busies himself by hanging the spacesuit up on a rope that stretches over the bathtub. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. Things like that aren\u2019t allowed in the Space Corps.\u201d\nViolet rolls her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the Space Corps right now. You\u2019re in a Vee-Reel. Or so you say.\u201d\nShe brings him back to her blanket. Merullo tries not to stare at the guys in the volleyball pit as they leap in the air or dive for the ball. Violet watches the strong, lithe bodies with her eyes shaded by sunglasses. He thinks that he could tell her about himself, that Vee-Reels are often the repositories of hopes and secrets, but this isn\u2019t his program. It belongs to Mark Jenny.\nLunkhead bops on by. \u201cKowabunga, Colonel! Come ride the curl!\u201d\n\u201cYou should go,\u201d Violet says. \u201cClears your mind.\u201d\nMerullo wades into the water, but it is cold and deep and he prefers dry land.\nLater, a straight-laced reporter drops in to conduct an in-depth report about The Mind of Today\u2019s Teenager. A rich heiress falls in love with Danny and tries to whisk him away to Greece on her yacht. A drag race goes awry, a bikini contest turns ugly, and Lunkhead trades places with a British rock star who could be his long-lost twin. Life on the beach is wacky that way. The Vee-Reel refuses to disengage.\n\u201cEven if the crew can\u2019t turn off the system, all they have to do is pull the power on the unit,\u201d Merullo tells Danny. He scratches at his sunburned chest. He took off the T-shirt somewhere but can\u2019t remember where. \u201cMark knows the ship\u2019s specs backward and forward. But what if he\u2019s not awake? What if all of us are stuck in the entertainment system, or something wrong with the ship itself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou know what you need, Pops?\u201d Danny drops his board into the surf. \u201cLet go and hang loose. Learn to surf. I\u2019m just the fellow to teach you.\u201d\nMerullo\u2019s fists clench. \u201cMaybe this Vee-Reel isn\u2019t what it appears to be. Maybe none of you are constructs. That radio signal from Triton\u2014\u201d\nDanny snaps his fingers and juts out his hip and launches into \u201cDig Those Waves,\u201d another teen anthem\u2014fast, breezy, easy to shake your hips to\u2014with Bonnie singing backup and the rest of us pitching in on the chorus, and an unseen band providing the accompaniment. Everyone on the beach is bopping and twirling and shimmying, and for two perfect minutes all the world is young and in love, and the endless summer reaches the pinnacle of perfect happiness.\nWhile we\u2019re singing, Merullo walks away.\nBonnie and Danny quarrel. She wants an engagement ring. He thinks that they have their whole lives ahead of them, so what\u2019s the rush? Merullo overhears part of it. They are so young, he wants to say. So na\u00efve. He wonders if he\u2019s ever been married, if he\u2019s ever been in love. Life outside the Vee-Reel is slip, slip, slipping away. Later he finds Bonnie sitting alone on the beach, building a lopsided sandcastle.\n\u201cI was never very good at this,\u201d she admits. \u201cThe tower always falls over, or the moat caves in.\u201d\nMerullo sits and starts helping her. The sand is warm and gritty, and gets under his fingernails. \u201cI heard you fighting with Danny.\u201d\n\u201cHe thinks we have forever. I think forever\u2019s over before you know it.\u201d\nOut in the water, five dolphins breach the surface and quickly curve under again. Danny and the others are out bobbing in the lineup, but they are indistinct, fuzzy. The sunlight is very bright. Merullo thinks of Mark Jenny, and then dumps more sand into the pail.\n\u201cWhen you wake up and leave the program, could you take me with you?\u201d Bonnie\u2019s expression is suddenly shy. \u201cI think seeing a real-live spaceship would be groovy. There\u2019s an astronaut club at school, but they don\u2019t let girls join.\u201d\n\u201cThis is where you belong, Bonnie.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a place.\u201d Bonnie lifts her head and looks out toward the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s just a stopover on the way to something bigger. Don\u2019t those movies of yours have endings?\u201d\nIndeed they do. First there will be climax of sorts. It might be a zany motorcycle chase, with Danny and chums capturing the bad guys who never posed much of a threat anyway. Or maybe a skydiving sequence, or dance marathon, or some other test of young adulthood. Then there will be a luau full of singing and dancing, one last hurrah of summer, before the credits roll.\n\u201cSo maybe your ending is coming.\u201d Bonnie rests her soft hand on his. \u201cOr maybe this whole thing will just start over. Do you know what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d\nMerullo squeezes her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know much of anything, anymore.\u201d\nRival surfers from another beach challenge Danny to a surf contest. Merullo watches the action from the high rocks near the water. Some of the contestants look like his crew\u2014a Japanese man doing a handstand on a rushing board, a dark-skinned woman on the shoulders of a man Merullo\u2019s age. Some others look like his family, or friends long gone. Their names are lost to him. The outside world is so far away now that he might never get it back. He needs something to hold on to.\n\u201cMy suit,\u201d he says to Violet, who has come to stand beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s the only proof I have.\u201d\n\u201cProof of what?\u201d Violet asks.\nHe\u2019s already sprinted past her, heading for the beach house. When he gets there, the bathroom clothesline holds only wet underwear and damp socks.\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Merullo demands.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Violet says.\nLunkhead comes out of the kitchen, munching on a bag of potato chips. \u201cLose something?\u201d\nMerullo overturns mattresses and empties duffel bags. He digs through closets and cabinets. Over at Sammy\u2019s Pavilion, where tiki torches flicker under the sunset sky, Bonnie and Danny are dancing cheek to cheek in the middle of the crowd. Becky Clark and Tommy Suede eventually grew up, grew old and died, but these two will be young forever.\nMerullo grabs Danny\u2019s arm. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s what, Pops?\u201d Danny asks.\n\u201cMy goddamn spacesuit! What have you done with it?\u201d\nNobody uses profanity on the beach. The music dies off and the dancing stops.\nMerullo turns in a circle, challenging us all with outstretched hands. \u201cWho are you? You brought me here, you trapped me, you won\u2019t let me leave\u2014\u201d\nHis voice cracks and fades. We shake our heads.\nDanny steps toward him. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave because you won\u2019t let yourself. Because you haven\u2019t finished what you came here to do.\u201d\nBonnie\u2019s voice is just as compassionate and sympathetic as Danny\u2019s. \u201cLook at the water, Colonel.\u201d\nFive seagulls lay at the border of water and land, the wind ruffling the stiff feathers of their corpses.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Merullo\u2019s legs fold under him and he lands on his knees. His eyes are wet. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I\u2019m in charge. I have a crew and ship to keep safe. We\u2019re on our way to Triton . . . \u201d\nThe seagulls fade into the sand. Where guys and gals once stood, there are only faint indentations in the sand. Sammy\u2019s Pavilion is gone, and empty beach blankets billow toward a sky that has gone silver-white. But the rolling blue ocean remain constant, and Our hand is warm on Merullo\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cLet go and hang loose,\u201d we tell him. \u201cSurf\u2019s up.\u201d\n\u201cThere was an alien radio message,\u201d Merullo insists.\n\u201cNo. There was a malfunction on your Voyager craft. It detected and reported a distorted version of its own transmissions. That was all.\u201d\nIn the lineup, the water is flat and calm. We help him sit up and say, \u201cWhen the wave comes, lay down and start paddling toward the beach as hard as you can while leaning forward. If you lean back, that\u2019ll just slow you down. But also keep your chest raised.\u201d\nMerullo\u2019s fists tighten. \u201cWhat happened to my ship?\u201d\n\u201cAn accident. It could no longer support you.\u201d We ruffle his thinning hair. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\nThe water rises. We help Merullo to paddle toward the shore, pull himself upright, and stand low with his gaze held high. There\u2019s no blue screen backdrop or Vee-Reel special effect for this ride. Physics and balance rule the world. We\u2019re riding the perfect wave across the cosmos of time and memory, through the heart of a crippled spaceship and the five corpses secreted aboard, and toward the speck of beach that has always been nothing more than a temporary accumulation of sand and sorrow. The sun burns away all regret. The salty water lifts us up and makes us sing.\nMerullo sees Mark Jenny standing on the shore.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you,\u201d Mark says, as Merullo emerges from the surf. Mark\u2019s suntanned face crinkles with affection, but there is concern there as well. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n\u201cLetting go. Hanging loose.\u201d Merullo has a wild grin on his face. He cups Mark\u2019s face with his strong, wet hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I never told you.\u201d\nMark smiles. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I knew?\u201d\nThe story, as with every beach movie, ends with a kiss.\nSandra McDonald is a former military officer, recovering Hollywood assistant, and perennially patient college instructor who writes across the genres of romance, history, fantasy, science fiction, GLBTQA, and young adult fiction.

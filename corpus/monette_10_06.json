Every morning she teased herself with wondering if this would be the day she left her grief behind her on the rocky beach and walked out into the sea to rejoin her husband, her sisters, her child. And every morning she turned away and climbed the steep and narrow stairs back to the fortress. She did not know if she was hero or coward, but she did not walk out into the cold gray waves to die.\nShe turned away, the tenth morning or the hundredth, and saw the child: a naked, filthy, spider-like creature, more animal than child. It recoiled from her, snarling like a dog. She took a step back in instinctive terror; it saw its chance and fled, a desperate headlong scrabble more on four legs than on two. As it lunged past her, she had a clear, fleeting glimpse of its genitals: a boy. He might have been the same age as her dead son would have been; it was hard to tell.\nShaken, she climbed the stairs slowly, pausing often to look back. But there was no sign of the child.\nSince she was literate, she had been put to work in the fortress\u2019s library. It was undemanding work, and she did not hate it; it gave her something to do to fill the weary hours of daylight. When she had been brought to the fortress, she had expected to be ill-treated\u2014a prisoner, a slave\u2014but in truth she was mostly ignored. The fortress\u2019s masters had younger, prettier girls to take to bed; the women, cool and distant and beautiful as she had once been herself, were not interested in a ragged woman with haunted half-crazed eyes. The librarian, a middle-aged man already gone blind over his codices and scrolls, valued her for her voice. But he was the only person she had to talk to, and she blurted as she came into the library, \u201cI saw a child.\u201d\n\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\n\u201cOn the beach this morning. I saw a child.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the librarian. \u201cI thought we\u2019d killed them all.\u201d\n\u201cThem?\u201d she said, rather faintly.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t imagine your people were the first to be conquered, did you? Or that we could have built this fortress, which has been here for thousands of years?\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t ever thought about it. \u201cYou really are like locusts,\u201d she said and then winced. Merely because he did not treat her like a slave, did not mean she wasn\u2019t one.\nBut the librarian just smiled, a slight, bitter quirk of the lips. \u201cYour people named us well. We conquered this country, oh, six or seven years ago. I could still see. The defenders of this fortress resisted us long after the rest of the country had surrendered. They killed a great many soldiers, and angered the generals. You are lucky your people did not do the same.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said with bitterness of her own. \u201cLucky.\u201d Lucky to have her husband butchered like a hog. Lucky to have her only child killed before her eyes. Lucky to be mocked, degraded, raped.\n\u201cLucky to be alive,\u201d the librarian said, as if he could hear her thoughts. \u201cExcept for this child you say you saw, not one inhabitant of this fortress survived. And they did not die quickly.\u201d He turned away from her, as if he did not want her to be able to see his face.\nShe said with quick horror, \u201cYou won\u2019t tell anyone? It\u2019s only a child. A . . . more like a wild animal. Not a threat. Please.\u201d\nHe said, still turned toward the window as if he could look out at the sea, \u201cI am not the man I was then. And no one else will care. We are not a people who have much interest in the past, even our own.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet you are a librarian.\u201d\n\u201cThe world is different in darkness,\u201d he said and then, harshly, briskly, asked her to get out the catalogue and start work.\nSome days later, whether three or thirty, she asked shyly, \u201cDoes the library have any information on wild children?\u201d\n\u201cWe can look,\u201d said the librarian. \u201cThere should at least be an entry or two in the encyclopedias.\u201d\nThere were, and she read avidly\u2014aloud, because the librarian asked her to\u2014about children raised by wolves, children raised by bears. And when she was done, he said, \u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Not really. I think he lives with the dog pack in the caves under the fortress, so it makes sense that he growls like a dog and runs like a dog. But it doesn\u2019t tell me anything about . . . \u201d\n\u201cHow to save him?\u201d\n\u201cHow to love him.\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t meant to say it. The librarian listened too well.\n\u201cDo you think he wishes for your love?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But he keeps coming back. And . . . and I must love someone.\u201d\n\u201cMust you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat else do I have?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and they did not speak again that day.\nShe did not attempt to touch the child. He never came within ten feet of her anyway, the distance between them as impassible as the cold gray sea.\nBut he was always there, when she came down the stairs in the morning, and when she started coming down in the evenings as well, he came pattering out from wherever he spent his time to crouch on a rock and watch her, head cocked to one side, pale eyes bright, interested. Sometimes, one or two of the dogs he lived with would come as well: long-legged, heavy-chested dogs that she imagined had been hunting dogs before the fortress fell to the locusts. Her husband had had dogs like that.\nThe encyclopedias had told her that he would not know how to speak, and in any event she did not know what language the people of this country had spoken before their world ended, as hers had, in fire and death. The child was an apt mimic, though, and much quicker-minded than she had expected. They worked out a crude sign-language before many weeks had passed, simple things like food, for she brought him what she could, and no, which he used when he thought she might venture too close, and I have to go now\u2014and it was ridiculous of her to imagine that he seemed saddened when she made that sign, and even more ridiculous of her to be pleased.\nShe worried that her visits might draw the fortress\u2019s attention to him\u2014for whatever the librarian said, she was not convinced the locusts would not kill the child simply because they could\u2014but she asked him regularly if other people came down to the beach, and he always answered, no. She wasn\u2019t sure if he understood what she was asking, and the question was really more of an apotropaic ritual; it gave her comfort, even though she suspected it was meaningless.\nUntil the day when he answered, yes.\nThe shock made her head swim, and she sat down, hard and not gracefully, on a lump of protruding rock. She had no way of asking him who had come, or what they had done, and in a hard, clear flash of bitterness, she thought how stupid of her it was to pretend this child could in any way replace her dead son.\nBut he was all she had, and he was watching her closely. His face never showed any emotion, except when he snarled with fear or anger, so she did not know what he felt\u2014if anything at all. She asked, All right?\nYes, the child signed, but he was still watching her as if he wanted her to show him what he ought to do.\nShe signed, All right, more emphatically than she felt it, but he seemed to be satisfied, for he turned away and began playing a game of catch-me with the two dogs who had accompanied him that morning.\nShe sat and watched, trying to convince herself that this was not an auspice of doom, that other people in the fortress could come down to the beach without any purpose more sinister than taking a walk.\nExcept that they didn\u2019t. The locusts were not a sea-faring people except in the necessity of finding new countries to conquer. They were not interested in the water and the wind and the harsh smell of salt. In all the time she had been in the fortress, she had never found any evidence that anyone except herself used the stairs to the beach. She was trying hard not to remember the day her husband had said, casually, A messenger came from the lighthouse today. Says there\u2019s strangers landing on the long beach. Little things. Little things led up to disaster. She was afraid, and she climbed the stairs back to the fortress like a woman moving through a nightmare.\nHer louring anxiety distracted her so much that she asked the librarian, forgetting that he was the last person in the fortress likely to know, \u201cWho else goes down to the beach?\u201d\nThe silence was just long enough for her to curse herself as an idiot before he said, \u201cThat was . . . I.\u201d\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What on earth possessed you?\u201d\nHis head was turned toward the window again. He said, \u201cYou spend so much time there.\u201d\nAt first she did not even understand what he was saying, could make no sense of it. She said, hastily, to fill the gap, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t break your neck.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t do it again, if you don\u2019t want.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cYou forget which of us is the slave and which the master.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think I can forget that? Any more than I can forget that I will never see your face?\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t . . . \u201d\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said, his voice weary although his posture was as poker-straight as ever. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you about it again. I didn\u2019t mean to tell you.\u201d\nShe said, astonished, \u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d and then they both, in unspoken, embarrassed agreement, plunged hastily into the minutiae of their work.\nBut that evening, as she sat on her rock beside the sea, she heard slow, careful footsteps descending the stairs behind her.\nCome! said the child from his rock eight feet away.\nFriend, she said, a word they\u2019d had some trouble with, but she thought he understood, even if she suspected that what he meant by it was pack-member. And called out, \u201cThere\u2019s room on my rock for two.\u201d\nFriend, the child repeated, his hands moving slowly.\nNo hurt, she said, and wondered if she meant that the librarian would not hurt the child, or that the child should not hurt the librarian.\nYes, he said, and then eagerly, Rock!\n\u201cWhat are you doing, this evening?\u201d the librarian\u2019s voice said behind her.\n\u201cTeaching him to skip stones.\u201d She flung another one, strong snap of the wrist. Five skips and it sank. The child bounced in a way she thought meant happiness; he threw a stone, but he hadn\u2019t gotten the wrist movement right, and it simply dropped into the water. Again! he said, imperious as the child of kings.\nShe threw another stone. Four skips. The librarian sat down beside her, carefully, slowly.\nShe said, \u201cWhat is the sea like, in darkness?\u201d\n\u201cMuch more vast than I remember it being, when I had my sight. It would do the generals good to be blind.\u201d\n\u201cBlindness won\u2019t teach them anything\u2014they have never wanted to see in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s what makes the difference?\u201d\n\u201cWe learn by wanting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe learn by grieving.\u201d\nShyly, the librarian\u2019s hand found hers.\nThe child threw a stone.\nIt skipped seven times before it sank.\nSarah Monette was born and raised in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, one of the secret cities of the Manhattan Project.

When we began publishing Clarkesworld in 2006, we started small\u2014publishing two stories (each under four thousand words long) and a cover in each issue. Over the years we\u2019ve gradually expanded, offering non-fiction, additional original stories, and most recently, reprints. We owe a debt of gratitude to the many people who supported us along the way and made our growth and continued existence possible. Quite a bit of credit goes to our staff, and, certainly to the authors and artists that entrusted us with their work. We also count on the various vendors that provide web and distribution services. Most of all we are thankful to our many readers, subscribers, and donors who make this all possible. Thank you all.\nThis month we\u2019ll be increasing the number of devices that Clarkesworld subscriptions are available on. We\u2019ve partnered with Maz Digital to produce apps for the iPad, iPhone and Android devices. That means Clarkesworld will be available through the Apple and Google Play newsstands. This project has been in the works for months, so it\u2019s very satisfying to see it come to fruition. One of the more exciting things about this project is that we can work the podcasts into these editions. As the audio versions of stories become available, play buttons will activate within the issue!\nSpeaking of the podcast, this is also Kate Baker\u2019s fourth anniversary as Podcast Director. I have to go on record as saying that bringing Kate on-board was probably the smartest hire I\u2019ve made in my life. Under her supervision, the podcast has developed a loyal (and growing) following. She is the voice of Clarkesworld and never ceases to impress me with the level of professionalism and sheer talent that she brings to each episode. If you\u2019ve never listened to one of our podcasts, do yourself a favor and try one. I was particularly impressed by her recent episode with Jim Kelly, where the two of them teamed up to read \u201cThe Promise of Space\u201d from our September issue. It would make a great place to start. The live reading they did at Worldcon moved the audience to tears.\nOh, and Worldcon! I have to at least talk briefly about that. I think that was most fun I\u2019ve had at a convention in ages. It was great meeting and chatting with so many of our readers. It was also uplifting to know so many people were pulling for us in the Hugos this year. (I\u2019m looking at you, mystery people who yelled from the back of packed elevators, as they stopped and passed our floor.) As to the Hugos, to win the award for Best Semiprozine after everything that happened in 2012, (heart attack, kidney stones, losing my day job, hurricane, etc.), well, there aren\u2019t words to describe it. I was simply overwhelmed and to be able to accept the award with Sean, Kate and Jason up there beside me . . . it just doesn\u2019t get better. We will endeavor to live up to the honor.\nLeft to right: Neil Clarke, Sean Wallace, Jason Heller, Kate Baker.\nPhoto by James J. Seals.\nThe Chesley Award Ceremony was also held at Worldcon and I was invited to hand out the award for Best Magazine Cover. Three of the six nominees were from Clarkesworld: Ken Barthelmey, Julie Dillon, and Martin Faragasso. The ASFA (Association of Science Fiction & Fantasy Artists) members awarded the Chesley to Ken for his November 2012 cover! This is the second time a Clarkesworld cover has been so honored. Congratulations, Ken! Here\u2019s his winning cover:\nIn addition to our new subscription tools, we have more improvements coming in the year ahead. The next item on the to-do list is the addition of the fourth original story, which will happen when we reach our next subscription milestone. After that, I\u2019m hoping to add an art feature to our non-fiction offerings. I\u2019ve been consulting with some of our artists to help shape that one. And of course, there is another secret project. Sorry, can't talk about that one until contracts are signed.\nThe long-term goal remains to make this my full-time job, which probably isn\u2019t as interesting to you as it is to me, but it will provide me time to dedicate to further improvements. There is only so far nights and weekends can take you. Later this month, Sean, Kate, and I will get together at Capclave, where I hope we\u2019ll have time to do some brainstorming about our future. If you were there, what would you toss on the table?\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

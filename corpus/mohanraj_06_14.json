Oh, the planet was large enough, but this so-famous university city, pride of the galaxy\u2014it was barely bigger than the smallest of the tunnel-cities on the southern continent of the homeworld. Gaudier from space, of course, since most of the city was above-ground and brightly lit. But the city had no depth to it\u2014it was thin, barely a few stories tall in most places.\nIf a human saw the deep delvings of Chaurin\u2019s people, it might faint away in sheer terror. On awaking, it would cling to the walls, begging not to be dragged any further, shown any more. Then Chaurin would insist\u2014no, you must come; you think us animals, barbarians; you must see what wonders we have wrought! And he might pull that human to the very edge of a twisting stone stair, and with a single, careless motion, toss it tumbling down. They were ephemeral, these humans, light and slight, of no consequence. It would be easy to dispose of one.\nHe was not here for that, though. Not here to exact revenge or even justice for the brother lost, for Gaurav of the bright eyes, the slow tongue. Gaurav the curious, the troublemaker, always sticking his cold nose where it had no business being. Chaurin had one task only on this planet the locals called Kriti\u2014to bring his brother home. Kriti meant creation, he\u2019d been told. For Gaurav, little brother, it had brought death and dissolution instead.\nAmara knelt in the soil at the base of the memorial stone. There had been some debate over where best to mark the lives lost in the bomb attack on the Warren. There would be a certain logic to marking the shattered underground room where seven had died\u2014seven whose actions had saved so many more. But Amara was glad the ruling Council had decided on the entrance gates for the memorial instead. Her bare hands dug into the richly composted soil, dirt embedding itself under her nails, cool in the midday heat. She placed a jasmine carefully, one whose seed had made the long journey from old Earth, to be cosseted in the university nurseries for years, and then finally settle here, under Kriti\u2019s foreign sun.\nThe jasmine should do well; most Earth plants did, though a few stubbornly refused to thrive. Her mother had photo albums passed down from the ancestors, of small village homes covered in bougainvillea, glorious profusions of red and pink and purple. No gardener had succeeded yet in growing them on Kriti\u2014they withered and died away from Sol. No one knew why. But the jasmine was more adaptable; it would grow and bloom, here in the open air, its sweet white blossoms scenting the air. Happy not to be shut deep underground, where the dust still carried the memory of those who had died. Amara couldn\u2019t believe any flower would truly be happy shut away from the sun, no matter how many fluorescent lights they used.\nShe suspected Gaurav\u2019s captain had exerted his influence to allow her to be assigned to the team that maintained the small garden here; as a brand-new horticultural student, such a task would not normally be allowed her. He understood the need for expiation. Narita kept telling her that she should not feel guilt, or responsibility for the deaths. And yet.\nGrubbing in the soil seemed to help. It was why Amara had gone back to school; her old job had been meaningless. When she put her decision in words, it was almost too simple, too obvious, but it was also the truth\u2014after all those deaths, she wanted to spend the rest of her days helping things grow.\nA low, growly voice above her\u2014\u201cI know you.\u201d Amara looked up, and almost fell over in shock. Her heart thumped wildly, again and again, her skin grown clammy and strange. There, looming over her, was Gaurav\u2014no. Impossible.\nShe must be mistaken; Amara had only known him for a few hours, after all. And there were not so many saurians on Kriti\u2014fewer, since the war started; she was not skilled at telling them apart. This was a stranger, not her dead friend. Not quite a friend. Amara could not go so far as to claim friendship with the brave young policeman who had died a hero, saving so many lives. Comrade-in-arms, then. They had joined forces to protect the Warren, and they had succeeded, though not without cost. This was not Gaurav. This was a stranger, staring at her with an expression she could not read, but it felt hostile. Angry. And he loomed over her\u2014his broad, muscled torso and arms blocked the sun.\nAmara stumbled to her feet. Standing, she was almost as tall as he was, which helped, though still half his width. He was taller than Gaurav, broader. Older? She was not good at judging age on saurians. Amara was grateful for the crowds not far away, students walking to and from classes, oblivious to their small drama. The students tended to cut a wide swathe around the memorial and the gate; six months wasn\u2019t long enough to inure them to the events of that day. But there were plenty of people within earshot\u2014human and otherwise. Still, her throat felt tight. The war between humans and others was escalating, out among the stars\u2014had it finally come to Kriti?\n\u201cDo I know you, ser?\u201d she asked, politely, willing her voice to be steady.\n\u201cI know you,\u201d he said. She was fairly sure of his gender; close enough to go on with, at least. After Gaurav\u2019s death, she had tried to learn what she could of him, of his people. There wasn\u2019t much to know\u2014Gaurav had been a quiet, reclusive young policeman, who had come to Kriti more by accident than anything else. And then he stayed, and made a life here, and lost it. Gaurav\u2019s people were reclusive; they rarely left their homeworld. But here one stood, arms hanging at his sides, hands pressed against thick thighs, his body leaning forward. His voice was low and growling as he said, \u201cYou are Amara Kandiah. I have studied the reports.\u201d\nNow Amara was scared; she wiped sweating palms on the cotton of her everyday sari. Most of the would-be saviors of the Warren had managed to stay out of the news, with the help of Gaurav\u2019s captain; the Council hadn\u2019t wanted any more publicity around the attempted missile attack than necessary. Amara\u2019s name hadn\u2019t been in the press, and her photo only appeared as one of a milling crowd. It was better that way, safer. \u201cWhat reports?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThe police reports they send to next of kin. I am Chaurin, Gaurav\u2019s brother.\u201d His voice dropped further, almost to a whisper. \u201cI am here to collect his remains.\u201d\nOh. Amara\u2019s throat loosened; she wavered, caught between prudence and compassion. She could direct him to the precinct and be done with it; Gaurav\u2019s captain would, eventually, bring him to the hospital where the remains were stored. But that would take time, possibly days, or longer. Council officials would surely want to speak with Chaurin, find out what, if anything, Gaurav might have said to his brother about the plot. Not that there would be anything\u2014there had been no time!\u2014but the officials still had learned so little of what had been going on. With the violence above accelerating, everyone was braced, waiting for the next attack. The Council would not want to hear that Chaurin knew nothing. She didn\u2019t know what they might do in their quest for answers. Amara trusted the Council, mostly, but she wouldn\u2019t want to put herself into their hands.\nThe sun shone overhead, bright and reassuring, but she could see Chaurin blinking against the glare; he was not well-adapted to life in the open air. The saurian was still large, but somehow not as threatening. If one of her sisters had been lost, Amara would not want another moment to pass without seeing her again\u2014whatever there was to see. And, conveniently, she had the means to make his journey far more direct; she was one of very few who did.\n\u201cI can take you to him,\u201d she said. And her racing heart slowed, to a quiet certainty. This was the right thing to do. She had been sure of that so rarely in the last six months, had doubted every choice, every decision. She had felt frozen in time, as if a piece of her were still stuck underground, amid the dust and blood and shouting. It was a tremendous relief, to have one choice be so clear cut.\nChaurin followed the human woman through the extensive campus grounds, to the white walls of the medical complex. It wasn\u2019t far, but he still seethed with impatience; every step seemed too slow, and he longed to race to his brother\u2019s side. But Chaurin didn\u2019t know which way to go.\nThe room Amara finally brought him to was dimly lit, more tolerable to his eyes, and warm enough to be comfortable. Chaurin perched awkwardly on a stool at the long table, resisting the urge to dig his claws into the wooden top. It was already scarred\u2014generations of students, perhaps, had dug grooves along the grain, carved strange hieroglyphics, in the way of students everywhere. C+S. A spiral. Goddess, no. Amara placed a small box in front of him, plain metal, hinged.\nChaurin reached out a hand, and then pulled it back. He\u2019d thought he was prepared, but the shock of seeing the box made his mouth go dry, so that he had to swallow before he could speak. \u201cIs this all there is? Was he . . . cremated?\u201d The word was unfamiliar in Chaurin\u2019s mouth, but he had learned it, just in case. He hadn\u2019t known what he would find on arrival, so had studied human death customs on the long journeys between Jump points. He hadn\u2019t been able to afford a luxury cruise; the clan had barely scraped together enough to buy him passage on a freighter. They had been afraid to wait longer than they had to, afraid of what would happen to Gaurav\u2019s remains. Chaurin had spent months in half-hibernation in his metal tube of a cabin, waking every few weeks, only long enough to eat a little and study, before falling back to sleep.\nWhat he\u2019d learned had turned his stomach, taking away his appetite. Many humans buried their loved ones, letting them rot in the dirt. Some humans burned their dead, turning them to ash on the wind. Others exposed the bodies on the mountaintops, for the bird of prey to devour\u2014a strange practice, but one that he thought Gaurav might have liked. Chaurin could have made peace with it if the last had occurred, but this? This small square metal box, half the size of his clenched fist, was all that was left of his brother?\nThe doctor, white-coated, shook her head. \u201cNo, not cremated.\u201d Narita, her name was, and the scents between them told him that she was the other woman\u2019s mate. Amara had explained on the walk over that this doctor, Narita, had taken medical custody of all of the remains. Gaurav was the last to be claimed. Chaurin had wanted to explain that it was not that his brother was unloved; Chaurin had just had so much further to come. She knew that, of course.\nNarita continued, \u201cWe were not able to retrieve much, after the explosion. I saved as much of him as I could, and froze the remains. I am familiar with your customs; I hoped someone would come for him.\u201d Her gaze was direct, and strangely kind. They were both kind, these women. Yet Chaurin fought to calm his pulse, to settle the ruff that had risen at his neck. The small one, Amara, had become frightened; it was cruel to leave her so. Amara had been frightened at the gate as well, leaving the scent of prey heavy in the air, but still, she\u2019d tried to help. It was not a small thing. Chaurin pushed down his anger; this was not her fault.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he managed to say. Chaurin gathered the box, his brother, in a single hand. As Chaurin stood, the doctor took a quick breath, and then spoke once more\u2014\u201cWait, please.\u201d He paused, but she didn\u2019t seem to know what she wanted to say next. Her face was flushed, blood rushing under brown skin. The urge to just go pulsed through him. He began to turn away, but then Narita managed to push out more words, shocking ones: \u201cWill you eat him?\u201d\nBefore Chaurin could do more than take in the question, it was quickly succeeded by more words: \u201cGaurav saved our lives, you know. He barely knew us, but he took the brunt of the blast, deliberately, to save us all.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cAnd all these months later, we still can\u2019t\u2014can\u2019t move past it. That moment.\u201d Narita took a deep breath, and then said, her words swift, running over each other: \u201cWe would like to share in this connection, this ceremony. May we join you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Amara says, her voice high and startled. The doctor rested a quick hand on her arm, but said nothing. Amara bit her lip, willing to wait for explanation, it seemed. A good mating, to have such trust between them. Chaurin didn\u2019t want to think about that in this moment, but apparently one couldn\u2019t leave one\u2019s profession behind completely. Once a matchmaker, always one, even in the midst of grief and a certain measured rage. He missed his mate, and the children. He wanted to go home.\n\u201cThere is not enough for you,\u201d Chaurin said, his throat aching. Never mind the bizarre insolence of her asking. It was a real problem\u2014there was not enough for all at home who would partake: Gaurav\u2019s siblings, their mates and children. He\u2019d known that from the first sight of the little metal box, had felt the knowledge squeeze his heart. Bad enough that Gaurav was dead, but that he be lost to so many of his kin . . . it was too much to bear. Chaurin had come so far, at such cost, to come back with so little.\n\u201cI know,\u201d the doctor said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that for months, reading your histories and legends. In the Tale of Elantra, they made soup of Genja, to feed the five hundred. What if we made soup? Would that be acceptable?\u201d\nIt was only a story, a legend, and yet\u2014\u201cPerhaps.\u201d It was only a story, but Chaurin felt a flicker of hope, a flutter in his chest. A mouthful was traditional, but sometimes, with the elderly, one made do with less, a thimbleful of flesh, just enough for a taste. Would he be able to taste his brother, a fragment floating in broth? Did it matter?\nShe took a step towards him. \u201cPlease, if you have time. Come to our home, have some tea. We can talk about it?\u201d\nChaurin smothered an involuntary startled laugh. His mother would have said exactly the same thing. She thought tea solved everything. In her honor, promising nothing, he said, \u201cYes. I will come.\u201d\nIt was only a short walk from the campus to their home. Chaurin passed through a sunny courtyard dense with plants into a small house; the kitchen boasted tall windows overlooking the flowering yard, and a fountain burbled pleasantly, hidden from view around a corner. This was a peaceful place, and Chaurin felt his muscles unwinding, just a little. Oddly, the humans seemed more tense here than they had been on campus; something was clearly wrong between them. Modern kitchen machinery lined the interior walls, but archaic traces remained as well\u2014a small fire in a hearth, and a kettle that hung above the fire, boiling their water. This home was a mix of old and new, and it seemed rather bare as well; Chaurin did not think they\u2019d been living there long. There was a newness to this mating, coexisting with an old familiarity. And pain, running under the surface; an odd mix.\nNarita poured the tea as they sat around the kitchen table, explaining quietly to her mate. \u201cThere was a genetic flaw in the species, which led to one in a hundred dying young, unless they had a certain enzyme added in utero. It could be added if the pregnant mother ingested the flesh of the father. No one knows which female first figured that out, but she should have gotten a medal.\u201d She added sugar and milk and passed the tea; Chaurin cradled the delicate cup carefully in his clawed hands. His brother\u2019s box sat in the center of the table, a place of honor. Safe.\nNarita continued, \u201cNo one needed to die for the enzyme even then; a mouthful of flesh was more than enough. And the enzyme has long since been synthesized, and eventually, species-modified in a vast societal effort; that genetic flaw has been erased, and the enzymes are now passed down through normal reproductive channels. It\u2019s perhaps the most successful example of genetic modification we know of.\u201d\nChaurin raised the china cup to his lips, sipping the hot drink, sweet and milky.\nNarita said, \u201cIt\u2019s tradition now, you understand. And some see it as religion too\u2014they believe that the soul is passed down with the flesh of the newly dead.\u201d\nAmara nodded, and then turned to Chaurin. \u201cDo you believe that?\u201d\nChaurin hesitated, the cup at his lips. \u201cI\u2014don\u2019t not believe it.\u201d He sipped again, and then carefully put the cup down. \u201cSome believe that his knowledge will be passed down, and Gaurav has more knowledge of humans than most of my people. Many of my people have half given up already, have begun long tunnelings, planning to sleep through the next few decades, in the hopes that the battles will pass them by. But some do not wish to sleep; if we are to survive this war, we may need to know what Gaurav knew.\u201d His chest twinged, a low, deep ache. \u201cMore importantly, if the ritual is not performed, my family will feel . . . bereft. That we have lost him truly.\u201d The woman was repulsed; he could smell it on her. But she masked it as well as she could, to her credit.\nChaurin leaned forward, unable to contain his urgency; Amara shifted back in her chair, the fear-scent rising. \u201cIf my children do not taste my brother\u2019s flesh, they will never truly know him. Do you understand? Do you have children?\u201d The human kinship bonds confused him\u2014they seemed fragile, easily broken. And with his question, the tension that had simmered under the surface came boiling into the open air, a rush of pain and frustration. He was no empath, but even for a non-human, the signals were too obvious to ignore.\nNarita\u2019s fingers tightened on the delicate china cup. It should have been an innocuous question\u2014they knew the answer, after all. They did not have children\u2014not yet. But they would\u2014they had even set a date for the harvesting of eggs, the combining and for Narita\u2019s implantation. It had all been so easy up until that point. Narita had been shocked how easily they had fallen back into their relationship, after so many years apart. They\u2019d found this little house and bought it; they\u2019d found themselves passionate in bed, once again, better than before. They had both wanted a child, badly; after the attack, they wanted to envision a brighter future. Even their mothers were happy at the prospect. One decision after another, falling neatly into place\u2014and then they\u2019d run up against the hard decision\u2014to modify or not? And if yes, how much?\nShould they simply solve for life-threatening disease? Many humans went that route, even among the more traditional groups. Though Amara\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t, and when Narita thought of that, her throat tightened. She could easily lose Amara to cancer, to heart attack; sometimes she was furious at Amara\u2019s parents, for forcing those risks upon their child. Surely Amara would agree to spare their child that much. But should they go further\u2014 do what Narita\u2019s parents had done, blessing their daughter with beauty, brains, and superlative health? Narita had never known a cold, never gained an ounce of unwanted weight, never struggled with simple schoolwork. How could she ask her child to endure unnecessary suffering? But if they made those changes, how would their daughter see Amara?\nOut in the stars, a battle was being fought, worlds were burning over these very questions. Those who would protect the purity of the human genotype, or rather, their perception of its purity. Amara was no bigot; she had alien friends aplenty. She had even finally brought her humod partner to her mother\u2019s house; over the last six months, Narita had come to know all of Amara\u2019s friends and relatives. They all accepted her, more or less; they would share samosas with her, tell her stories of Amara as a little girl. But what was acceptable among adults became far more charged when the future was on the line. No one thought rationally when children were involved.\nCould she explain all of this to an alien? Narita owed him honesty, at least\u2014but she didn\u2019t even know why she had asked such a tremendous favor from Chaurin, to partake in his brother\u2019s funeral rites. She hadn\u2019t known Gaurav, not really. But over the last six months, as she researched his people and their customs, the impulse had grown. Right alongside her desire for a child, the sense that she should carry something more with her, something that marked that day, that night, when they came together to stop a terrible disaster. The night when everything changed.\n\u201cWe hope to have children,\u201d the smaller woman said. Amara. He kept forgetting their names. She did not look at her mate.\n\u201cWhat is preventing you?\u201d he asked, curious.\nSilence answered him. Amara frozen in her chair, while Narita shifted uneasily in hers. Chaurin watched, reading the currents that flowed between them. It wasn\u2019t long before the muddy waters began to clear. \u201cYou do not talk to me, which is unsurprising, as I am a stranger\u2014but you do not talk to each other, either.\u201d\nAfter a long moment, Narita said, \u201cWe are afraid if we do talk, we will find ourselves in too great disagreement.\u201d Amara nodded, and then lifted her cup to her lips, precluding speech.\nChaurin was intrigued. \u201cYou fear you stand on opposite sides of a ravine, too far from each other to reach across. That may be, but how will you know unless you stretch out your hand?\u201d He was happy to fall for a moment into the role of matchmaker again, relieved to have something familiar to do, in such a strange place. Chaurin had read about human matchmakers, who worked only until the first mating, and then considered their job complete. That had bewildered him; mating was never easy; if one took on the responsibility of making a match, surely it followed that one owed the pairing some guidance in the early years, some help going forward? His own mate would surely have slain him by now were it not for their matchmaker\u2019s gentle interventions. \u201cNarita, what is it you desire?\u201d\nShe bit her lip and then said, \u201cI want a healthy child.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Amara?\u201d\nThe shorter woman hesitated. \u201cI want that too. Of course I do.\u201d Her voice sharpened as she continued, \u201cBut\u2014how healthy? What do you mean when you say healthy?\u201d And then it broke. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mean beautiful?\u201d\nNarita said, with some urgency, \u201cYou are beautiful.\u201d\nAmara shrugged, old pain evident in the set of her shoulders. \u201cNot as beautiful as I could be; not as beautiful as you are.\u201d\nInteresting\u2014Chaurin had little conception of human beauty, but he could see that Narita\u2019s features were more regular, her skin smoother. Was that beautiful?\nNarita leaned forward across the table, reaching out to take Amara\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cBeauty isn\u2019t some absolute. It is specific; it is the details of your face. I wouldn\u2019t change a single feature, not a line on your face, not a curve of your body.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I believe you,\u201d Amara said softly, lines creasing her forehead.\nChaurin was not sure what those lines meant, but he didn\u2019t think they were good. He sighed. \u201cThat is a bigger muddle than we will clear quickly\u2014and I am not staying to work with you. But surely you have someone you may contact?\u201d\nThere was silence again, for an endless moment. Then\u2014\u201cThe devadasi?\u201d Amara offered, tentatively.\nNarita laughed, sounding startled. \u201cReally? You want her? There are plenty of other counselors we could call.\u201d\nAmara shrugged. \u201cAfter we fought together that night\u2014I trust her. The fact that you slept with her occasionally, in the years when we were apart, feels . . . irrelevant.\u201d\nNarita frowned. \u201cShe\u2019ll want us all to be naked for the conversations, you know. It\u2019s part of the devadasi practice; she thinks it helps lower barriers.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s right,\u201d Amara said, a small smile lurking at the edges of her mouth.\nNarita squeezed her mate\u2019s hand and then released it, sitting back. She turned back to Chaurin. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re helping us, and I\u2019ve been so impossibly rude. Rude is a kind word for it. You must think me obscene. I just\u2014\u201c\nShe bit her lip again, and Chaurin wondered what that gesture meant. Shame, perhaps. Which was appropriate enough, for her request was, if not obscene, then borderline sacrilegious. But how could you expect proper respect and appropriate behavior from aliens? And wasn\u2019t that what this war was about, after all? If the gulf between species was, in truth, too vast to be bridged, then perhaps the pure human movement was right after all. Better to go back to our separate worlds, like quarrelling children sent to their separate rooms.\nBut didn\u2019t one ask more, expect more, from adults?\nChaurin wished Gaurav were here. He would know what to do. After the funeral rites, Chaurin might know as well, might hold that knowledge inside himself, a small, glowing kernel.\nHe sighed. In truth, he already knew what Gaurav would do\u2014that was why he had agreed to come here, to this small, homey kitchen. Gaurav\u2019s choice was clear, in the way his little brother had lived his life\u2014going out to tour the Charted Worlds, instead of staying safe at home. Staying on this planet to live and work, instead of trying every expedient to get back home. It was clear in his death most of all\u2014Chaurin had read the police reports. His brother could have fled when the fighting began, but instead, he had run towards the battle, had gone to help the aliens, the strangers. When the stranger asked for help, Gaurav gave it. Could Chaurin do less?\nHe asked, \u201cYou can cook the soup here?\u201d\nNarita nodded, her eyes wide. \u201cWe can make it right now, if you want. And then I can take it to the lab, freeze-dry it into cubes, so you can easily take it back home. If you dissolve the cubes into a larger pot of water, it should give as many mouthfuls as you need. We would be very happy to help you with that.\u201d\n\u201cThen, if you like, I think I can spare a few mouthfuls to share with you,\u201d Chaurin said, gently. It felt . . . right. He was still angry, on some level, even enraged. But these two were not the proper target of his rage. That rage, he would direct at those who sought to divide them, those who took bloody action in that cause.\nAmara swallowed visibly; Chaurin could scent her revulsion. Narita said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d But Amara shook her head, swallowed again, and said, \u201cNo. I want to honor Gaurav, in the way of his people. I\u2019d like to do this.\u201d\nThey were so strange, these humans. But brave too. Chaurin did not want to go back home and hide in the tunnels. If they stood on the edge of the abyss, he chose to reach out his hand to the stranger. Perhaps they would find a way across.\nMary Anne Mohanraj is the author of Bodies in Motion (HarperCollins) and nine other titles.

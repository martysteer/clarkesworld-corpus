Rebecca and I are falling. My daughter and I\u2014so high it seems impossible that we could survive. We are in the back seat of a taxi that has somehow unhitched from its arcing track between the skyscrapers.\n Theory 1: Your last thought is your least important. It is a dead-end wisp that will vanish in an instant, with no effect on anything. Theory 2: Your last thought is the secret culmination of your life, potentially altering the significance of everything that came before. You might affirm it all, regret it all, have that final moment of redemptive insight. Theory 3: Your last thought is an opportunity\u2014your one chance to undergo an intriguing death experience, maybe an overdose of an amazing drug, maybe the feeling of surrendering to the sea in a storm against the cliffs.\n The wind mounted as we fell, whistling fearfully through the door frame. Rebecca floated, eyes closed\u2014angelic? mermaidine?\u2014left hand pressed against the dashboard, a dancer mid-air, school uniform and black hair billowing. Her right hand brushed the taxi\u2019s soft inter-Face, which wore an expression I had never before seen in an AI. Could a taxi know enough to fear death?\n I wanted to reach toward Rebecca, hold her, make my last thought a thought for her. She was drifting toward me, her book bag elevating off her lap as her legs straightened. But my arms would not respond. I looked down at them, and they seemed foreign objects. Instead of love, I thought, my final thought would be that my final thought would be of final thoughts instead of love.\n I woke sweetly relaxed, tingly in the head, vacant elsewhere. I opened and closed my mouth, shaping a groan. It seemed somehow the perfect groan, with a new interesting harmony from my chest cavity. The worried nurse who entered my field of view was the perfect nurse. Then came the perfect CEO of St. Vincent\u2019s Northeast, some perfect lawyers, my wife Sara with my perfect teenage son Abe\u2014a team of angels drifting through honey!\n \u201cR-?\u201d I had overestimated the power of gravity, so maybe she was here too?\n Sara paused, then looked toward the blank wall to her right, maybe flinching away from me a little\u2014but beautiful, how the hospital lights brightened her cheeks!\u2014then she slightly shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n Abe wouldn\u2019t look at me either. His face was swollen, tense, tear-glazed.\n The expected sadness didn\u2019t arrive. My guts didn\u2019t twist, my stomach didn\u2019t sicken, my throat didn\u2019t ache. Instead I thought: No adulthood could have made Rebecca more complete. Brevity is beautiful. A Chopin etude. To want it to continue past its final note would be a failure of understanding. Or rather, the wanting is itself the very coda that perfects it.\n Then I thought: What are these tingly drugs? I imagine saving my grief in a glass box; my future sadness will finalize this perfection. The power button on the back of the nurse\u2019s P.A.D. is therefore the ideal button! It is the circular mandala of the universe itself. The mandala swirled and grew, a spiraling tint across the hospital room.\n . . . ~ the procedure must be entirely voluntary ~ . . . said the CEO?\n Something about cost-benefit analysis, something about the price of the equipment behind me which I pictured blooming like ten thousand flowers, something about insurance limits, my irreparable body, about a magnificent new Christian mission . . . since I was an engineering professor at Loyola I would understand risk ratios\u2014the words swam from his mouth like slow fish\u2014expected utilities, why they couldn\u2019t pay for even one more day unless I committed to\u2014?\n Theory 4: Cost-benefit analysis is the holiest of all things. It is the pinnacle of human wisdom and I the golden sacrifice upon it. I luxuriated in my magnanimity.\n ~ It must be entirely voluntary [fish-voice] but it will . . . three months at a million a day . . . you must not change your mind ~\n Sara\u2019s face was the perfect riddle! I nodded because dead-Rebecca had tied an invisible ribbon to my chin. And I continued to nod as I watched Sara\u2019s hand guide mine across form after form thrust before me by the magical lawyers, and then the Cardinal of Los Angeles arrived!\n The Cardinal\u2019s dark sad face. Her swooping glorious Earth-angel red.\n In my dream, the disciples were not lined up all on one side, but jammed together around a small round table in a dark room, noisy, arguing. I was leaning in toward Jesus, near his yellow ear, smelling someone\u2019s sour feet. \u201cYou don\u2019t even exist!\u201d I hollered.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll give me a 10% credence, Isaac my baby,\u201d he said. \u201c11.3% after this dream.\u201d\n \u201cRebecca?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cSimply multiply!\u201d Jesus said, tearing a piece off the suddenly-paper tablecloth and scribbling illegible figures on it with a chewed plastic pen.\n \u201c10% times infinitude, 90% times void,\u201d I figured.\n \u201cPlus 1% times everything else,\u201d Jesus suggested, while another disciple bumped an elbow against his head, sloshing bad wine down the side of Our Savior\u2019s (10%) face.\n \u201cZ% times infinitude is . . . \u201d\n \u201cA very large expectation!\u201d said 10% Jesus, tearing off a new strip of paper for me, eyelash thin but infinitely long.\n The drugs diminished and I crashed down into pain and grief. The drugs returned and I soared up again. Rebecca was a tombstone crushing me, which I couldn\u2019t see past, then the stone became helium and the world fell away beneath us, a tiny thing\u2014but where was her face?\n Per the agreement, I would be amputated, sliced, and sacrificed. My recorded cognitive patterns would become the template for a new type of AI. Engineers measured my head, opened my skull, crusted my brain with devices, rerouted my facial nerves. They peeled back my cheeks and worked electronics up through my sinuses. In a certain subclass of my high moods, I nerded out with them, listening to their plans to scan and prep and slice my brain.\n The best AI can\u2019t be built from scratch. It needs a scanned human brain as template. A fully detailed scan is fatal, exposing the brain slice by slice\u2014and even so the quality is too poor to transfer the whole personality and intelligence.\n It would have been too expensive to keep me alive anyway, with my irreparably damaged body. And the Church had an intriguing plan for a new type of sacramental AI. There\u2019d be weeks of prep, preliminary nonfatal scans, arguing about design, a bit of theology on the side.\n A keyboard was mounted on a metal arm below my face to the right. I could flick my eyes from key to key, and my eye-tracker would detect the motions, then three blinks to send. In this way, I learned to speak in a slow, synthetic voice.\n They replaced my body with a shapeless tangle of iridescent nanocarbon pipes and plastic bags. I became only a head, transfixed.\n When Sara\u2019s belly had just begun to grow with the thing that would become Abe, we visited a friend of hers in Guadalajara, who had a giant tank of tropical fish.\n \u201cViven en el para\u00edso,\u201d said the friend, Sun-yi. Sunny. They live in paradise.\n \u201cPero no son peces,\u201d said Sara. But they are not fish. Sara switched to English, \u201cThey are only fragments of fish. They don\u2019t encounter a full world. There\u2019s no risk, no learning, no choice, no gain or loss. You\u2019ve taken demented slices of fish and put them on loop.\u201d\n \u201cThey are happy,\u201d said Sunny, touching the aquarium glass with two long fingers. \u201cYou need suffering? You need la vida complicada?\u201d You need a complicated life?\n Sara looked at me, but I declined to take sides. \u201cI propose a fish sacrifice,\u201d I said. \u201cFor their sins, they can suffer vicariously tonight. We will crucify some tilapia upon the dinner plate.\u201d\n After Sara was asleep, I sat in the friend\u2019s living room, watching the fish in the dim light. I could hear a bed squeaking two rooms down\u2014Sunny enjoying a slice of bliss with the short middle-aged man the restaurant had sent over with the tilapia.\n A demon bit through my phantom left leg, just above the knee. I contorted my face, though lacking lungs the loudest noise I could make was tooth clacking.\n Sara lifted a wormlike tube from the rack beneath me, squinting as if trying to puzzle it out. \u201cThis here is the torture-pain tube,\u201d she said. \u201cPart 673HB1.2.9a6, delivered on rush from the eighth plane of Hell. The doctor installed it because she wishes she could have more anal sex but her husband isn\u2019t up to the job.\u201d\n The white nurse by the white sink held up a bright red bag. A margin of electric hostility seemed to separate Sara and her, who never acknowledged each other. \u201cNow, Professor Isaac,\u201d the nurse said, \u201cyou\u2019re ready for your new nanites, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The nurse\u2019s blue-gloved hands reached past my face to the apparatus behind me, then returned holding a mostly empty bag.\n Tomorrow\u2019s bags hung from her cart in a line, whatever was in them waiting to become a piece of me. Red? Black? Sad? Lucid?\n Abe had been teaching himself the philosophical literature on personal identity and artificial intelligence. \u201cIt will totally be you, Dad!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the future of AI. The Church is really doing it. They\u2019re cutting edge; they\u2019re pouring an ocean of money into it. Way better than a taxi AI, way better, Dad, nothing like a cleaning bot!\u201d Abe looked a little guiltily down at the cleaning bot who happened to be polishing the floor at that moment, but the bot\u2019s inter-Face smiled easily up at us.\n \u201cHello,\u201d it said.\n Abe continued, \u201cThose future people in the rosary beads will have your memories, Dad. They\u2019ll be real people, really conscious. And just like you\u2019re the same person as that ten-year-old kid on the skateboard thirty-five years ago\u2014just like that, those people will be you. They\u2019ll remember me, they\u2019ll remember Mom, they\u2019ll remember this. Some of this. Some. Enough. Think, Dad. A billion years of joy in millions of bodies! Who needs Heaven? You\u2019ll still be going long after I\u2019m dead, long after my eighty-greats-grandchildren are dead! You, the eternal twenty-five-year-old, remembering Mom and me, and Becca. Doing whatever you want in that bead\u2014blissing out, flying, whatever\u2014no pain at all! Crap, Dad, I\u2019m totally jealous. I want to be the one in the crash, doing this, becoming a new template mind.\u201d\n \u201cBot, stop cleaning a minute,\u201d I had my synthetic voice say.\n \u201cYes, Professor Lee,\u201d the bot said, smiling again.\n \u201cHow much do you remember of your old life?\u201d I asked.\n The bot\u2019s inter-Face frowned slightly. \u201cI am instructed not to answer that question.\u201d\n \u201cWhat caused the dissolution of the United States?\u201d\n \u201cThat topic exceeds my parameters,\u201d the bot said, frowning again. Two feathery dusters unfolded from its sides like arms and it spun them idly.\n \u201cDad,\u201d interjected Abe. \u201cIt won\u2019t be like that. Slicing up prisoners\u2019 brains is the old tech. Those old templates for limited AI, that\u2019s exactly what the Church is finally moving past! You\u2019ll be general AI, with real self-awareness. No cognitive constraints. Not like them. Not like the old stuff.\u201d\n I pictured the taxi\u2019s inter-Face, as we were falling. \u201cIn a tiny world,\u201d I said.\n \u201cHow big does a world have to be, Dad? What\u2019s wrong with a rosary bead? Plus, there\u2019ll be millions of you everywhere!\u201d\n Sara said nothing, seeming to be checking mail or something else on her P.A.D. But after Abe had gone back to school, she leaned toward my left ear and whispered, \u201cIsaac, we\u2019re going to replace your body and screw the Church.\u201d Straightening back up, she raised her middle fingers and waggled them in front of my face.\n \u201cDo you envy the fish?\u201d Sunny had whispered in my ear, touching my shoulder, that night in Guadalajara.\n I had fallen asleep on the soft leather couch. I was dazed with sleep and wine, excited from dream. Slowly, Sunny\u2019s hand slid down my chest.\n Theory 5: I would have let her take me that night, had fear and shame not immobilized me from the neck down. 5A: And that would have been a good thing. 5B: It would have been a terrible thing. The equation will not stay put.\n In the vids, the Cardinal had a way of shifting her lips contemplatively to the left. Tall, Jamaican-accented, in the brilliant color of her rank, she praised the courage of the twelve volunteers. She emphasized that although the beings in the rosary beads would be as capable of pleasure as any animal, only God could create genuine eternal souls. The optional new beads would only add a modern variation to traditional atonement\u2014like caring for a plant or puppy to help redeem one\u2019s sin, but in a certain way much better because of the vast potential pleasure the new AIs would experience. From human sin, AI ecstasy. I watched on repeat as my medications rose and fell, and the videos took very different shape depending on my mood. She was visionary saint. She was thin claw of the devil.\n Sara clicked off the video. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six weeks!\u201d she said. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d\n My synthetic voice: \u201cWhat else I do?\u201d\n Sara uttered some un-Churchy words. Then, pointing right between my eyes: \u201cI\u2019m working on it. Don\u2019t go permanently fishy-brained on me, Isaac.\u201d\n Commentators speculated about the Rosary Project. The Church would rack a huge profit, some said. The (supposedly) Free City of Los Angeles would come even more under its domination. Sinners would count and spin beads, launching tiny new worlds. Later they would watch the worlds they\u2019d booted, adjust the parameters of their creations, manipulate a limited range of events, maybe experience their creations through immersive virtual reality. There would be collectible sets and unique beads with rising aftermarket value. The two most addictive ideas in history, religion and video-gaming, would finally become one.\n The worlds would tick on and on, unstoppable once launched\u2014worlds of unmixed, repeating joy for the AIs within them. But could an AI really feel joy? Or was it always only outward show? If Jack the Ripper had only launched enough tiny worlds, would he have been a benevolent man in sum?\n Sara sat on a rolling stool, leaning toward me, her graying brown hair falling across her right eye, in that way it always did. She spoke steadily to me, focusing me, redirecting my mind, steering me back from hallucinatory drift. She spoke about the past, about people we knew, about the insane dance parties we\u2019d thrown in grad school, about history and politics, about the time our car stalled in the mountain blizzard and we had to sleep in the back while the battery ran to zero, about the fuzzy purple stuffed bear Rebecca had loved, about the beauty of her brief life remembered.\n Abe brought pizza slices and kimchee and said ease up, Mom.\n But Abe pressed too, in his own way. He\u2019d given me video glasses with articles I could read just by flicking my eyes. With a lop-sided smile, he\u2019d unzip his hoodie to show me some retro t-shirt, then he\u2019d slip a little stick gently into the top of my glasses\u2014always the latest bit of AI enthusiasm. He\u2019d pretend to ignore me and he\u2019d fold his thin body into the soft guest recliner and do homework on his P.A.D. or text his boyfriend.\n When the meds flowed high I was too scatterbrained to read Abe\u2019s articles and they seemed pointless, unwise\u2014why should I care if it would be me in that bead, truly uploaded? My life is but a tiny concern beside creation! Nothing could be more beautiful than my sweaty, rumpled son and his unknown future. When my meds crashed me down I couldn\u2019t bear to read the articles and they seemed pointless and unwise in an entirely different way\u2014the AIs would be mere demented monsters to profit the Church. In still other moods, escape to a synthetic uncomplicated Heaven was exactly what I craved. I couldn\u2019t tell which of the shifting attitudes constituted my true opinion.\n \u201cHumanity, Dad. How much longer do we have? Really?\u201d Abe was showing me a vid on his P.A.D. of the war in Europe. \u201cBut these beads are gonna be frickin indestructible\u2014millions of years, solid state, no moving parts. Tiny fusion core. You are the future, Dad, my only faith, the only promise from the Halls of Power that I believe.\u201d\n Sara didn\u2019t comment on Abe\u2019s articles. None of the crap about uploading for her. She was a brain and body girl. A dancer. A dancer in her youth at least.\n When had we last danced?\n A picnic beneath mountain oaks. Abe, Rebecca, Sara, and me. A stained plastic tablecloth, dry cheese, plastic knives, guava juice for the kids, Chianti for the grown-ups in blue fiber cups. Figs, rye bread. Barely visible over the crest of the hill behind Sara, taxis arcing along the upper San Gabriel track. A honey-colored insect that I\u2019d let wiggle off with a crumb. Prickers in my socks.\n Two hundred students in the auditorium: Introduction to Mechanical Engineering. Unexpectedly, I see Sara at the top of the left stairway among the seats, near the entry door, faintly smiling, arms crossed, long-stemmed tulips jutting from one hand, for me I think. I will soon learn why. She is pregnant with Rebecca.\n Rebecca and me on our hard faux-wood apartment floor, playing cards. Her jack of spades takes my ten of hearts.\n Rebecca and me behind a low planter in the 104th floor garden, pretending to hide from love-goblins.\n Abe dancing with his school trophy for overall academic achievement in seventh grade, Rebecca dancing with him in contagious joy. \u201cBeck-o! Sis-o!\u201d He whoops and slaps her hand. \u201cBeck-OH!\u201d\n What is marriage, Sara? You grow together, repeating the days. Something deepens. Something fades.\n Love\u2019s ten thousandth kiss.\n If I had millions of parallel lives, each lasting millions of subjective years, in simple, repeating worlds of size X, what would I want? Anything compatible with the doctrines of the Church. A timeless library? Mountain trees and sunsets? An endless day on the beach? Small psychological adjustments would ensure that these delights never grew tiresome.\n I chose to dance. My perfect dance floor. My ideal partners\u2014versions of Sara, younger, when we first met, in our wild nighttime exuberances. I would dance with ghosts of the Sara who had once electrified me. Or maybe only my demented descendants would dance, spawned off templates from my sacrificed brain, not really me. Or only seem to dance?\n My seeming dance partners would be crafted partly from our old photos and my verbalized memories, but also from new videos of Sara. The engineers would capture her shape, her movements, her style, and seed a range of Sara-sprites for my dance world.\n The engineers placed a camera between my eyes.\n Sara danced right there in the hospital room, everyone watching, even Grumpy Nurse, even some random old man with a hospital gown and rolling I.V. pole. Abe had his P.A.D. hooked to some ferocious little speakers. \u201cGo, Dad!\u201d he said, as if I was the one doing anything.\n While Sara danced she pierced me with a stare so intense I couldn\u2019t fathom what was behind it\u2014as if she could will me back from death.\n Ten-percent Jesus was slow-dancing with little Rebecca, both of them dirty-footed, lovers in some Heaven that looked like a cramped stonewall restaurant.\n Rebecca turned to look at me, still dancing. \u201cDaddy, does this card mean I will live forever?\u201d Her right hand was holding a playing card, its face toward me. It was the terrified inter-Face of the taxi AI.\n From the ragged bottom of Jesus\u2019 tunic, long ribbons tapered. Did they simplify as they approached their asymptotes?\n \u201cThe sum might be divergent,\u201d I answered.\n \u201cEternity,\u201d whispered 10% Jesus, leaning to touch his damp forehead against mine, \u201cis precisely like a melon. Repetitive! Forgetful. Is that why the Cardinal loves it so?\u201d\n \u201cIsaac?\u201d\n I opened my eyes.\n \u201cIsaac. Fishy-head.\u201d Sara whispering.\n For a moment I thought I had arms and feet and tried to move them. Then I had tangled hallucinatory arms and feet that would not uncramp. Becca?\n In the dim nighttime hospital light, Sara introduced a new doctor, who leaned over me with a syringe. Soon I was high again, this time in a different way. The doctor and his assistant began to detach me from the larger equipment, began to load my tubes and bags into a cart. Sara explained that they had an experimental plan to re-embody me. I saw no St. Vincent nurses. I soared higher. Colors and sounds and tastes blurred into each other. New indescribably beautiful galaxies of consciousness were invented, and time stretched out to Hubble lengths\u2014or so it seemed to me.\n I woke in an antique gas-powered ambulance, rumbling somewhere. I saw Abe, Sara, a piece of the new doctor. I held only a remnant of my previous high, and I longed to soar again. The ambulance stopped and idled.\n Abe looked nauseous. \u201cThe Church is looking for us, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe phones and AIs and webbed electronics are all off, so they can\u2019t trace us.\u201d\n My keyboard and voice synthesizer were gone. I looked at Sara.\n \u201cFifty-fifty,\u201d she said. \u201cFifty-fifty. But that\u2019s better than certain death.\u201d\n A bug with shiny red wings crawled on the metal wall behind her.\n \u201cNot death, Mom,\u201d Abe said.\n Abe\u2019s P.A.D. was on the seat by his thigh, where Sara and the doctor couldn\u2019t see. Abe\u2019s thumb was near the power button.\n \u201cWe need you,\u201d Sara said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Oakland. Abe and I need you. You need to live, be a father again, a professor again. We need to walk in the mountains again. We need to sip espresso by a garden again, people-watching and making snide remarks. You need to help us remember Rebecca. We need to bake bread and drink wine at midnight.\u201d\n I could feel my mood descending further, hallucinatory viscera twisting into my consciousness. A father to whom? To the ghost of Rebecca? To Abe, who would rather send me off? A husband why?\n The ambulance revved up, and their human bodies swayed with the ride. Sara threw words of life at me, but they hazed and fuzzed . . . ~ spinal splice . . . nanite stem cells . . . installed with growth casings the new apartment . . . short roll two Shattuck Line you learn . . . ~ Boo woo, boo boo wooh?\n Theory 6: You need suffering? You need la vida complicada?\n Theory 7: These beads are gonna be frickin indestructible. You are the future, Dad, my only faith, the only promise from the Halls of Power that I believe.\n I fixed my gaze on Abe\u2019s power button. I flicked my eyes up, down, left, right\u2014the cross. Up, down, left, right again. Looking at the power button, the thumb. The location tracking software. Abe will understand.\n Sara\u2019s voice, too harsh: \u201cIsaac, what are you doing?\u201d\n Up, down, left, right.\n The world is graying . . .\n Abe\u2019s thumb falls the decisive half inch, and the ten thousand satellite eyes of Heaven turn silently toward us.\n Rebecca cups a brown bead in her right hand. We\u2019re in the stone restaurant. 10% Jesus is sitting at a little wooden piano in the corner, rifling through a scruffy sheaf of sheet music Saint Peter has just given him. I lean down close toward Rebecca\u2019s bead. Rebecca raises her hand, pressing the bead through my forehead.\n I\u2019m on a glittering modern dance floor. Red lights pulse with the rhythms. A beautiful woman spins before me in flat shoes and green blooming dress, her brow furious with concentration, her gaze intense. She points her left forefinger toward me. She twirls and stops, twirls and stops, each time advancing a little closer, her eyes coming round to fix me more ferociously with each spin. Have I seen her before? S- S- Sarai? Who was I dancing with yesterday?\n A vortex of carbon-tube tropical fish erupts around us, swimming mid-air, twisting their fins. The woman steps suddenly, surprisingly near. For a long moment, her face and body are a tantalizing electric half-inch from mine. She raises a shoulder, lowers a hip, so close, without touching, and stares straight into my eyes. She leans forward and our bodies meet. How can I explain the tingle, the fizz that fills me\u2014love\u2019s first kiss, in that moment when you briefly know that the world has become perfect. The bass line surges and deepens. A greater joy than this, I could not imagine. Everything is glass except us at this moment, the lantern center.\n Then some fragments of memories I don\u2019t understand\u2014a picnic, two children dancing with a trophy, a man and girl playing cards.\n I am back in the stone restaurant.\n \u201cIs that me?\u201d\n I look around, and everything is dust. Humanity is long since extinct.\n I wake again. The hospital room is dark. Now there is a guard.\n The Cardinal\u2019s two long fingers reaching forward. I feel them touch my eyes, ears, nostrils, lips, her unction oil wet on my face, wooden crucifix dancing as she leans, a bass line of thumping rhythms from the machines.\n She is chanting a Latin prayer. She presses her soft lips to my forehead and whispers, \u201cOnly what is corrupt and changeable dies.\u201d\n Her red gown backs away and I see Sara\u2019s face, not in person\u2014she is only a thin vid on Abe\u2019s P.A.D. ~ from, from? Jumpsuit orange.\n ~ the newsfeeds, Dad . . . said they\u2019d give Mom leniency ~\n Abe is kneeling, shaking. Crying?\n ~ going to a better place, Dad ~\n Abe\u2019s P.A.D. falls from his shaking hands. Flat slice of video-Sara rotating toward the floor, fish-slow. Something black covers my eyes and the noise of the slicer is suddenly loud ~\n One piece reflects on the unusual sensation of having one\u2019s brain pulled apart. One piece gives a loving last thought to Rebecca and Sara and Abe. Another piece dances away, ecstatic, forgetting.\n These pieces do not know each other.

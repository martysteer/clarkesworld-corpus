Sturgeon Memorial Award\n\u201cI rise today on this September 11th, the one-year anniversary of the greatest tragedy on American soil in our history, with a heavy heart . . . \u201d\n\u2014Hon. Jim Turner\nSeptember 9, 2001\nJessica slumped against the inside of the truck door. The girl behind the wheel and the other one squished between them on the bench seat kept stealing glances at her. Jessica ignored them, just like she tried to ignore the itchy pull and tug deep inside her, under her belly button, where the aliens were trying to knit her guts back together.\n\u201cYou party pretty hard last night?\u201d the driver asked.\nJessica rested her burning forehead on the window. The hum of the highway under the wheels buzzed through her skull. The truck cab stank of incense.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hitchhike, it\u2019s not safe,\u201d the other girl said. \u201cI sound like my mom saying it and I hate that but it\u2019s really true. So many dead girls. They haven\u2019t even found all the bodies.\u201d\n\u201cHighway of Tears,\u201d the driver said.\n\u201cYeah, Highway of Tears,\u201d the other one repeated. \u201cBloody Sixteen.\u201d\n\u201cNobody calls it that,\u201d the driver snapped.\nJessica pulled her hair up off her neck, trying to cool the sticky heat pulsing through her. The two girls looked like tree planters. She\u2019d spent the summer working full time at the gas station and now she could smell a tree planter a mile away. They\u2019d come in for smokes and mix, dirty, hairy, dressed in fleece and hemp just like these two. The driver had blond dreadlocks and the other had tattoos circling her wrists. Not that much older than her, lecturing her about staying safe just like somebody\u2019s mom.\nWell, she\u2019s right, Jessica thought. A gush of blood flooded the crotch of her jeans.\nWater. Jessica, we can do this but you\u2019ve got to get some water. We need to replenish your fluids.\n\u201cYou got any water?\u201d Jessica asked. Her voice rasped, throat stripped raw from all the screaming.\nThe tattooed girl dug through the backpack at Jessica\u2019s feet and came up with a two-liter mason jar half-full of water. Hippies, Jessica thought as she fumbled with the lid. Like one stupid jar will save the world.\n\u201cLet me help.\u201d The tattooed girl unscrewed the lid and steadied the heavy jar as Jessica lifted it to her lips.\nShe gagged. Her throat was tight as a fist but she forced herself to swallow, wash down the dirt and puke coating her mouth.\nGood. Drink more.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Jessica said. The tattooed girl stared at her.\nYou need to. We can\u2019t do this alone. You have to help us.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d the driver asked. \u201cYou look wrecked.\u201d\nJessica wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just hot.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re really flushed,\u201d said the tattooed girl. \u201cYou should take off your coat.\u201d\nJessica ignored her and gulped at the jar until it was empty.\nNot so fast. Careful!\n\u201cDo you want to swing past the hospital when we get into town?\u201d the driver asked.\nA bolt of pain knifed through Jessica\u2019s guts. The empty jar slipped from her grip and rolled across the floor of the truck. The pain faded.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI just got a bad period.\u201d\nThat did it. The lines of worry eased off both girls\u2019 faces.\n\u201cDo you have a pad? I\u2019m gonna bleed all over your seat.\u201d Jessica\u2019s vision dimmed, like someone had put a shade over the morning sun.\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d The tattooed girl fished through the backpack. \u201cI bleed heavy too. It depletes my iron.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just an excuse for you to eat meat,\u201d said the driver.\nJessica leaned her forehead on the window and waited for the light to come back into the world. The two girls were bickering now, caught up in their own private drama.\nAnother flood of blood. More this time. She curled her fists into her lap. Her insides twisted and jumped like a fish on a line.\nYour lungs are fine. Breathe deeply, in and out, that\u2019s it. We need all the oxygen you can get.\nThe tattooed girl pulled a pink wrapped maxi pad out of her backpack and offered it to Jessica. The driver slowed down and turned the truck into a roadside campground.\n\u201cHot,\u201d Jessica said. The girls didn\u2019t hear. Now they were bitching at each other about disposable pads and something called a keeper cup.\nWe know. You\u2019ll be okay. We can heal you.\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for me,\u201d Jessica said as they pulled up to the campground outhouse. She flipped the door handle and nearly fell out of the truck. \u201cI can catch another ride.\u201d\nCold air washed over her as she stumbled toward the outhouse. She unzipped her long coat and let the breeze play though\u2014chill air on boiling skin. Still early September but they always got a cold snap at the start of fall. First snow only a few days ago. Didn\u2019t last. Never did.\nThe outhouse stench hit her like a slap. Jessica fumbled with the lock. Her fingers felt stiff and clumsy.\n\u201cWhy am I so hot?\u201d she said, leaning on the cold plywood wall. Her voice sounded strange, ripped apart and multiplied into echoes.\nYour immune system is trying to fight us but we\u2019ve got it under control. The fever isn\u2019t dangerous, just uncomfortable.\nShe shed her coat and let it fall to the floor. Unzipped her jeans, slipped them down her hips. No panties. She hadn\u2019t been able to find them.\nNo, Jessica. Don\u2019t look.\nPubic hair hacked away along with most of her skin. Two deep slices puckered angry down the inside of her right thigh. And blood. On her legs, on her jeans, inside her coat. Blood everywhere, dark and sticky.\nKeep breathing!\nAn iron tang filled the outhouse as a gout of blood dribbled down her legs. Jessica fell back on the toilet seat. Deep within her chest something fluttered, like a bird beating its wings on her ribs, trying to get out. The light drained from the air.\nIf you die, we die too. Please give us a chance.\nThe flutters turned into fists pounding on her breastbone. She struggled to inhale, tried to drag the outhouse stink deep into her lungs but the air felt thick. Solid. Like a wall against her face.\nDon\u2019t go. Please.\nBreath escaped her like smoke from a fire burned down to coal and ash. She collapsed against the wall of the outhouse. Vision turned to pinpricks; she crumpled like paper and died.\n\u201cEverything okay in there?\u201d\nThe thumping on the door made the whole outhouse shake. Jessica lurched to her feet. Her chest burned like she\u2019d been breathing acid.\nYou\u2019re okay.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Gimme a second.\u201d\nJessica plucked the pad off the outhouse floor, ripped it open and stuck it on the crotch of her bloody jeans, zipped them up. She zipped her coat to her chin. She felt strong. Invincible. She unlocked the door.\nThe two girls were right there, eyes big and concerned and in her business.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cHow old are you, fifteen? We waited,\u201d the driver said as they climbed back into the truck.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let you hitchhike,\u201d said the tattooed girl. \u201cEspecially not you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not me?\u201d Jessica slammed the truck door behind her.\n\u201cMost of the dead and missing girls are First Nations.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m an Indian? Fuck you. Am I on a reserve?\u201d\nThe driver glared at her friend as she turned the truck back onto the highway.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the tattooed girl said.\n\u201cDo I look like an Indian?\u201d\n\u201cWell, kinda.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d Jessica leaned on the window, watching the highway signs peel by as they rolled toward Prince George. When they got to the city the invincible feeling was long gone. The driver insisted on taking her right to Gran\u2019s.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jessica said as she slid out of the truck.\nThe driver waved. \u201cRemember, no hitchhiking.\u201d\nSeptember 8, 2001\nJessica never hitchhiked.\nShe wasn\u2019t stupid. But Prince George was spread out. Busses ran maybe once an hour weekdays and barely at all on weekends, and when the weather turned cold you could freeze to death trying to walk everywhere. So yeah, she took rides when she could, if she knew the driver.\nAfter her Saturday shift she\u2019d started walking down the highway. Mom didn\u2019t know she was coming. Jessica had tried to get through three times from the gas station phone, left voice mails. Mom didn\u2019t always pick up\u2014usually didn\u2019t\u2014and when she did it was some excuse about her phone battery or connection.\nMom was working as a cook at a retreat center out by Tabor Lake. A two hour walk, but Mom would get someone to drive her back to Gran\u2019s.\nOnly seven o\u2019clock but getting cold and the wind had come up. Semis bombed down the highway, stirring up the trash and making it dance at her feet and fly in her face as she walked along the ditch.\nIt wasn\u2019t even dark when the car pulled over to the side of the highway.\n\u201cAre you Jessica?\u201d\nThe man looked ordinary. Baseball cap, hoodie. Somebody\u2019s dad trying to look young.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jessica said.\n\u201cYour mom sent me to pick you up.\u201d\nA semi honked as it blasted past his car. A McDonald\u2019s wrapper flipped through the air and smacked her in the back of the head. She got in.\nThe car was skunky with pot smoke. She almost didn\u2019t notice when he passed the Tabor Lake turnoff.\n\u201cThat was the turn,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019s not there. She\u2019s out at the ski hill.\u201d\n\u201cAt this time of year?\u201d\n\u201cSome kind of event.\u201d He took a drag on his smoke and smiled.\nJessica hadn\u2019t even twigged. Mom had always wanted to work at the ski hill, where she could party all night and ski all day.\nIt was twenty minutes before Jessica started to clue in.\nWhen he slowed to take a turn onto a gravel road she braced herself to roll out of the car. The door handle was broken. She went at him with her fingernails but he had the jump on her, hit her in the throat with his elbow. She gulped air and tried to roll down the window.\nIt was broken too. She battered the glass with her fists, then spun and lunged for the wheel. He hit her again, slammed her head against the dashboard three times. The world stuttered and swam.\nPain brought everything back into focus. Face down, her arms flailed, fingers clawed at the dirt. Spruce needles flew up her nose and coated her tongue. Her butt was jacked up over a log and every thrust pounded her face into the dirt. One part of her was screaming, screaming. The other part watched the pile of deer shit inches from her nose. It looked like a heap of candy. Chocolate-covered almonds.\nShe didn\u2019t listen to what he was telling her. She\u2019d heard worse from boys at school. He couldn\u2019t make her listen. He didn\u2019t exist except as a medium for pain.\nWhen he got off, Jessica felt ripped in half, split like firewood. She tried to roll off the log. She\u2019d crawl into the bush, he\u2019d drive away, and it would be over.\nThen he showed her the knife.\nWhen he rammed the knife up her she found a new kind of pain. It drove the breath from her lungs and sliced the struggle from her limbs. She listened to herself whimper, thinking it sounded like a newborn kitten, crying for its mother.\nThe pain didn\u2019t stop until the world had retreated to little flecks of light deep in her skull. The ground spun around her as he dragged her through the bush and rolled her into a ravine. She landed face down in a stream. Her head flopped, neck canted at a weird angle.\nJessica curled her fingers around something cold and round. A rock. It fit in her hand perfectly and if he came back she\u2019d let him have it right in the teeth. And then her breath bubbled away and she died.\nWhen she came back to life a bear corpse was lying beside her, furry and rank. She dug her fingers into its pelt and pulled herself up. It was still warm. And skinny\u2014nothing but sinew and bone under the skin.\nShe stumbled through the stream, toes in wet socks stubbing against the rocks but it didn\u2019t hurt. Nothing hurt. She was good. She could do anything.\nShe found her coat in the mud, her jeans too. One sneaker by the bear and then she looked and looked for the other one.\nIt\u2019s up the bank.\nShe climbed up. The shoe was by the log where it had happened. The toe was coated in blood. She wiped it in the dirt.\nYou need to drink some water.\nA short dirt track led down to the road. The gravel glowed white in the dim light of early morning. No idea which way led to the highway. She picked a direction.\n\u201cHow do you know what I need?\u201d\nWe know. We\u2019re trying to heal you. The damage is extensive. You\u2019ve lost a lot of blood and the internal injuries are catastrophic.\n\u201cNo shit.\u201d\nWe can fix you. We just need time.\nHer guts writhed. Snakes fought in her belly, biting and coiling.\nFeel that? That\u2019s us working. Inside you.\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d\nWe\u2019ve established a colony in your thalamus. That\u2019s where we\u2019re blocking the pain. If we didn\u2019t, you\u2019d die of shock.\n\u201cAgain.\u201d\nYes, again.\n\u201cA colony. What the fuck are you? Aliens?\u201d\nYes. We\u2019re also distributing a hormonal cocktail of adrenaline and testosterone to keep you moving, but we\u2019ll have to taper it off soon because it puts too much stress on your heart. Right now it\u2019s very important for you to drink some water.\n\u201cShut up about the water.\u201d She wasn\u2019t thirsty. She felt great.\nA few minutes later the fight drained out of her. Thirsty, exhausted, she ached as though the hinge of every moving part was crusted in rust, from her jaw to her toes. Her eyelids rasped like sandpaper. Her breath sucked and blew without reaching her lungs. Every rock in the road was a mountain and every pothole a canyon.\nBut she walked. Dragged her sneakers through the gravel, taking smaller and smaller steps until she just couldn\u2019t lift her feet anymore. She stood in the middle of the road and waited. Waited to fall over. Waited for the world to slip from her grasp and darkness to drown her in cold nothing.\nWhen she heard the truck speeding toward her she didn\u2019t even look up. Didn\u2019t matter who it was, what it was. She stuck out her thumb.\nSeptember 10, 2001\nJessica woke soaked. Covered in blood, she thought, struggling with the blankets. But it wasn\u2019t blood.\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\nYour urethra was damaged so we eliminated excess fluid through your pores. It\u2019s repaired now. You\u2019ll be able to urinate.\nShe pried herself out of the wet blankets.\nNo solid food, though. Your colon is shredded and your small intestine has multiple ruptures.\nWhen the tree planters dropped her off, Gran had been sacked out on the couch. Jessica had stayed in the shower for a good half hour, watching the blood swirl down the drain with the spruce needles and the dirt, the blood clots and shreds of raw flesh.\nAnd all the while she drank. Opened her mouth and let the cool spray fill her. Then she had stuffed her bloody clothes in a garbage bag and slept.\nJessica ran her fingertips over the gashes inside her thigh. The wounds puckered like wide toothless mouths, sliced edges pasted together and sunk deep within her flesh. The rest of the damage was hardened over with amber-colored scabs. She\u2019d have to use a mirror to see it all. She didn\u2019t want to look.\n\u201cI should go to the hospital,\u201d she whispered.\nThat\u2019s not a good idea. It would take multiple interventions to repair the damage to your digestive tract. They\u2019d never be able to save your uterus or reconstruct your vulva and clitoris. The damage to your cervix alone\u2014\n\u201cMy what?\u201d\nDo you want to have children someday?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nTrust us. We can fix this.\nShe hated the hospital anyway. Went to Emergency after she\u2019d twisted her knee but the nurse had turned her away, said she wouldn\u2019t bother the on-call for something minor. Told her to go home and put a bag of peas on it.\nAnd the cops were even worse than anyone at the hospital. Didn\u2019t give a shit. Not one of them.\nGran was on the couch, snoring. A deck of cards was scattered across the coffee table in between the empties\u2014looked like she\u2019d been playing solitaire all weekend.\nGran hadn\u2019t fed the cats, either. They had to be starving but they wouldn\u2019t come to her, not even when she was filling their dishes. Not even Gringo, who had hogged her bed every night since she was ten. He just hissed and ran.\nUsually Jessica would wake up Gran before leaving for school, try to get her on her feet so she didn\u2019t sleep all day. Today she didn\u2019t have the strength. She shook Gran\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cNight night, baby,\u201d Gran said, and turned over.\nJessica waited for the school bus. She felt cloudy, dispersed, her thoughts blowing away with the wind. And cold now, without her coat. The fever was gone.\n\u201cCould you fix Gran?\u201d\nPerhaps. What\u2019s wrong with her?\nJessica shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Everything.\u201d\nWe can try. Eventually.\nShe sleepwalked through her classes. It wasn\u2019t a problem. The teachers were more bothered when she did well than when she slacked off. She stayed in the shadows, off everyone\u2019s radar.\nAfter school she walked to the gas station. Usually when she got to work she\u2019d buy some chips or a chocolate bar, get whoever was going off shift to ring it up so nobody could say she hadn\u2019t paid for it.\n\u201cHow come I\u2019m not hungry?\u201d she asked when she had the place to herself.\nYou are; you just can\u2019t perceive it.\nIt was a quiet night. The gas station across the highway had posted a half cent lower so everyone was going there. Usually she\u2019d go stir crazy from boredom but today she just zoned out. Badly photocopied faces stared at her from the posters taped to the cigarette cabinet overhead.\nAn SUV pulled up to pump number three. A bull elk was strapped to the hood, tongue lolling.\n\u201cWhat was the deal with the bear?\u201d she said.\nThe bear\u2019s den was adjacent to our crash site. It was killed by the concussive wave.\n\u201cCrash site. A spaceship?\u201d\nYes. Unfortunate for the bear, but very fortunate for us.\n\u201cYou brought the bear back to life. Healed it.\u201d\nYes.\n\u201cAnd before finding me you were just riding around in the bear.\u201d\nYes. It was attracted by the scent of your blood.\n\u201cSo you saw what happened to me. You watched.\u201d She should be upset, shouldn\u2019t she? But her mind felt dull, thoughts thudding inside an empty skull.\nWe have no access to the visual cortex.\n\u201cYou\u2019re blind?\u201d\nYes.\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d\nA form of bacteria.\n\u201cLike an infection.\u201d\nYes.\nThe door chimed and the hunter handed over his credit card. She rang it through. When he was gone she opened her mouth to ask another question, but then her gut convulsed like she\u2019d been hit. She doubled over the counter. Bile stung her throat.\nHe\u2019d been here on Saturday.\nJessica had been on the phone, telling mom\u2019s voice mail that she\u2019d walk out to Talbot Lake after work. While she was talking she\u2019d rung up a purchase, $32.25 in gas and a pack of smokes. She\u2019d punched it through automatically, cradling the phone on her shoulder. She\u2019d given him change from fifty.\nAn ordinary man. Hoodie. Cap.\nJessica, breathe.\nHer head whipped around, eyes wild, hands scrambling reflexively for a weapon. Nobody was at the pumps, nobody parked at the air pump. He could come back any moment. Bring his knife and finish the job.\nPlease breathe. There\u2019s no apparent danger.\nShe fell to her knees and crawled out from behind the counter. Nobody would stop him, nobody would save her. Just like they hadn\u2019t saved all those dead and missing girls whose posters had been staring at her all summer from up on the cigarette cabinet.\nWhen she\u2019d started the job they\u2019d creeped her out, those posters. For a few weeks she\u2019d thought twice about walking after dark. But then those dead and missing girls disappeared into the landscape. Forgotten.\nYou must calm down.\nNow she was one of them.\nWe may not be able to bring you back again.\nShe scrambled to the bathroom on all fours, threw herself against the door, twisted the lock. Her hands were shuddering, teeth chattering like it was forty below. Her chest squeezed and bucked, throwing acid behind her teeth.\nThere was a frosted window high on the wall. He could get in, if he wanted. She could almost see the knife tick-tick-ticking on the glass.\nNo escape. Jessica plowed herself into the narrow gap between the wall and toilet, wedging herself there, fists clutching at her burning chest as she retched bile onto the floor. The light winked and flickered. A scream flushed out of her and she died.\nA fist banged on the door.\n\u201cJessica, what the hell!\u201d Her boss\u2019s voice.\nA key scraped in the lock. Jessica gripped the toilet and wrenched herself off the floor to face him. His face was flushed with anger and though he was a big guy, he couldn\u2019t scare her now. She felt bigger, taller, stronger, too. And she\u2019d always been smarter than him.\n\u201cJesus, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Better than fine. She was butterfly-light, like if she opened her wings she could fly away.\n\u201cThe station\u2019s wide open. Anybody could have waltzed in here and walked off with the till.\u201d\n\u201cDid they?\u201d\nHis mouth hung open for a second. \u201cDid they what?\u201d\n\u201cWalk off with the fucking till?\u201d\n\u201cAre you on drugs?\u201d\nShe smiled. She didn\u2019t need him. She could do anything.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re gone. Don\u2019t come back.\u201d\nA taxi was gassing up at pump number one. She got in the back and waited, watching her boss pace and yell into his phone. The invincible feeling faded before the tank was full. By the time she got home Jessica\u2019s joints had locked stiff and her thoughts had turned fuzzy.\nAll the lights were on. Gran was halfway into her second bottle of u-brew red so she was pretty out of it, too. Jessica sat with her at the kitchen table for a few minutes and was just thinking about crawling to bed when the phone rang.\nIt was Mom.\n\u201cDid you send someone to pick me up on the highway?\u201d Jessica stole a glance at Gran. She was staring at her reflection in the kitchen window, maybe listening, maybe not.\n\u201cNo, why would I do that?\u201d\n\u201cI left you messages. On Saturday.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. This phone is so bad, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cListen, I need to talk to you.\u201d Jessica kept her voice low.\n\u201cIs it your grandma?\u201d Mom asked.\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s bad. She\u2019s not talking.\u201d\n\u201cShe does this every time the residential school thing hits the news. Gets super excited, wants to go up north and see if any of her family are still alive. But she gives up after a couple of days. Shuts down. It\u2019s too much for her. She was only six when they took her away, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. When are you coming home?\u201d\n\u201cI got a line on a great job, cooking for an oil rig crew. One month on, one month off.\u201d\nJessica didn\u2019t have the strength to argue. All she wanted to do was sleep.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your Gran,\u201d Mom said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay in a week or two. Listen, I got to go.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cNight night, baby,\u201d Mom said, and hung up.\nSeptember 11, 2001\nJessica waited alone for the school bus. The street was deserted. When the bus pulled up the driver was chattering before she\u2019d even climbed in.\n\u201cCan you believe it? Isn\u2019t it horrible?\u201d The driver\u2019s eyes were puffy, mascara swiped to a gray stain under her eyes.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jessica agreed automatically.\n\u201cWhen first I saw the news I thought it was so early, nobody would be at work. But it was nine in the morning in New York. Those towers were full of people.\u201d The driver wiped her nose.\nThe bus was nearly empty. Two little kids sat behind the driver, hugging their backpacks. The radio blared. Horror in New York. Attack on Washington. Jessica dropped into the shotgun seat and let the noise wash over her for a few minutes as they twisted slowly through the empty streets. Then she moved to the back of the bus.\nWhen she\u2019d gotten dressed that morning her jeans had nearly slipped off her hips. Something about that was important. She tried to concentrate, but the thoughts flitted from her grasp, darting away before she could pin them down.\nShe focused on the sensation within her, the buck and heave under her ribs and in front of her spine.\n\u201cWhat are you fixing right now?\u201d she asked.\nAn ongoing challenge is the sequestration of the fecal and digestive matter that leaked into your abdominal cavity.\n\u201cWhat about the stuff you mentioned yesterday? The intestine and the . . . whatever it was.\u201d\nOnce we have repaired your digestive tract and restored gut motility we will begin reconstructive efforts on your reproductive organs.\n\u201cYou like big words, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nWe assure you the terminology is accurate.\nThere it was. That was the thing that had been bothering her, niggling at the back of her mind, trying to break through the fog.\n\u201cHow do you know those words? How can you even speak English?\u201d\nWe aren\u2019t communicating in language. The meaning is conveyed by socio-linguistic impulses interpreted by the brain\u2019s speech processing loci. Because of the specifics of our biology, verbal communication is an irrelevant medium.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not talking, you\u2019re just making me hallucinate,\u201d Jessica said.\nThat is essentially correct.\nHow could the terminology be accurate, then? She didn\u2019t know those words\u2014cervix and whatever\u2014so how could she hallucinate them?\n\u201cWere you watching the news when the towers collapsed?\u201d the driver asked as she pulled into the high school parking lot. Jessica ignored her and slowly stepped off the bus.\nThe aliens were trying to baffle her with big words and science talk. For three days she\u2019d had them inside her, their voice behind her eyes, their fingers deep in her guts, and she\u2019d trusted them. Hadn\u2019t even thought twice. She had no choice.\nIf they could make her hallucinate, what else were they doing to her?\nThe hallways were quiet, the classrooms deserted except for one room at the end of the hall with 40 kids packed in. The teacher had wheeled in an AV cart. Some of the kids hadn\u2019t even taken off their coats.\nJessica stood in the doorway. The news flashed clips of smoking towers collapsing into ash clouds. The bottom third of the screen was overlaid with scrolling, flashing text, the sound layered with frantic voiceovers. People were jumping from the towers, hanging in the air like dancers. The clips replayed over and over again. The teacher passed around a box of Kleenex.\nJessica turned her back on the class and climbed upstairs, joints creaking, jeans threatening to slide off with every step. She hitched them up. The biology lab was empty. She leaned on the cork board and scanned the parasite diagrams. Ring worm. Tape worm. Liver fluke. Black wasp.\nSome parasites can change their host\u2019s biology, the poster said, or even change their host\u2019s behavior.\nJessica took a push pin from the board and shoved it into her thumb. It didn\u2019t hurt. When she ripped it out a thin stream of blood trickled from the skin, followed by an ooze of clear amber from deep within the gash.\nWhat are you doing?\nNone of your business, she thought.\nEverything is going to be okay.\nNo it won\u2019t, she thought. She squeezed the amber ooze from her thumb, let it drip on the floor. The aliens were wrenching her around like a puppet, but without them she would be dead. Three times dead. Maybe she should feel grateful, but she didn\u2019t.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want me to go to the hospital?\u201d she asked as she slowly hinged down the stairs.\nThey couldn\u2019t have helped you, Jessica. You would have died.\nAgain, Jessica thought. Died again. And again.\n\u201cYou said that if I die, you die too.\u201d\nWhen your respiration stops, we can only survive for a limited time.\nThe mirror in the girls\u2019 bathroom wasn\u2019t real glass, just a sheet of polished aluminum, its shine pitted and worn. She leaned on the counter, rested her forehead on the cool metal. Her reflection warped and stretched.\n\u201cIf I\u2019d gone to the hospital, it would have been bad for you. Wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThat is likely.\n\u201cSo you kept me from going. You kept me from doing a lot of things.\u201d\nWe assure you that is untrue. You may exercise your choices as you see fit. We will not interfere.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t left me any choices.\u201d\nJessica left the bathroom and walked down the hall. The news blared from the teacher\u2019s lounge. She looked in. At least a dozen teachers crowded in front of an AV cart, backs turned. Jessica slipped behind them and ducked into the teachers\u2019 washroom. She locked the door.\nIt was like a real bathroom. Air freshener, moisturizing lotion, floral soap. Real mirror on the wall and a makeup mirror propped on the toilet tank. Jessica put it on the floor.\n\u201cSince when do bacteria have spaceships?\u201d She pulled her sweater over her head and dropped it over the mirror.\nJessica, you\u2019re not making sense. You\u2019re confused.\nShe put her heel on the sweater and stepped down hard. The mirror cracked.\nGo to the hospital now, if you want.\n\u201cIf I take you to the hospital, what will you do? Infect other people? How many?\u201d\nJessica, please. Haven\u2019t we helped you?\n\u201cYou\u2019ve helped yourself.\u201d\nThe room pitched and flipped. Jessica fell to her knees. She reached for the broken mirror but it swam out of reach. Her vision telescoped and she batted at the glass with clumsy hands. A scream built behind her teeth, swelled and choked her. She swallowed it whole, gulped it, forced it down her throat like she was starving.\nYou don\u2019t have to do this. We aren\u2019t a threat.\nShe caught a mirror shard in one fist and swam along the floor as the room tilted and whirled. With one hand she pinned it to the yawning floor like a spike, windmilled her free arm and slammed her wrist down. The walls folded in, collapsing on her like the whole weight of the world, crushing in.\nShe felt another scream building. She forced her tongue between clenched teeth and bit down. Amber fluid oozed down her chin and pooled on the floor.\nPlease. We only want to help.\n\u201cNight night, baby,\u201d she said, and raked the mirror up her arm.\nThe fluorescent light flashed overhead. The room plunged into darkness as a world of pain dove into her for one hanging moment. Then it lifted. Jessica convulsed on the floor, watching the bars of light overhead stutter and compress to two tiny glimmers inside the thin parched shell of her skull. And she died, finally, at last.\nKelly Robson's short fiction has appeared in Clarkesworld, Tor.com, Asimov's Science Fiction, and multiple year's best anthologies.

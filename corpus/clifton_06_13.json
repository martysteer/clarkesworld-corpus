Arms and legs getting bigger every day. A little starfish, crowding me out. It is my name for him, but only when he will be gentled can I say. It happens less and less.\n Humans came here for mining. Oberon, moon of the ice giant Uranus, of the star Sol, the sun we never see. Half ice, half stone: A core 65% of Earth\u2019s moon in size, wrapped in a skin of ice. They built over the ice, chopped out level on level, until it was gone, and they lived upon the surface. And then down again, and again. Now the only bit of moon not cored or carved away sits in a glass case, at the center of our moon. Everything else is steel, and gold, anything too heavy to cart back to Jove Station. A city deep as she is wide.\n My father is a district head of one of the zones running from surface to core, but I haven\u2019t seen him in ten years. My sister leaves me notes to meet, sometimes, in a vent we knew as kids. She buys us dinner, says Father\u2019s getting on. She has a Name, free travel between zones.\n But I have a world, built in the bones of a moon. It belongs to me. My moon, my starfish, and no name at all. We live in the in-between places, the little man and I. In vents and hatches, corridors unmarked by our passing.\n What they don\u2019t understand is that a world like this goes all the way down, spikeshaped, down to core. They live on the surface, like a world is a bubble. Like they\u2019re back home. They call themselves colonists, as though they\u2019re here to save us. We call them refugees, because we know they\u2019re running from something. My sister married one. He has business and travel and friends. One I would like, she says. She says we should meet.\n On third days we wait for a shift-change in a spa about half down coreward, one that doesn\u2019t see much offworld action, and we take our showers. Sweat-stink; that grav-line smell in your hair. He\u2019s been asking to run with big boys, like the gang I first ran with, when I fell through the cracks and into the moon. Scary, violent and wonderful. His smile when he talks about them. I wash and think. He\u2019s seven. I was seventeen when I dropped out, so I think he\u2019s seven.\n I found him half-hidden behind a fan close to core, just tiny. I felt trapped with my people, sometimes. Running the same gang, the names they give each other. I thought, \u201cI can retire, climb into the walls and live. Nobody will hate me, nobody will follow. They know I\u2019m fast and I am strong. They respect me. But they won\u2019t be sad either, when I go.\u201d I found him then, that day, and that was proof. And I was right. They don\u2019t bother us and they don\u2019t miss us either.\n This businessman, the refugee. I think about moving back up, up to the surface: Colonial, like her. To sit in Father\u2019s chairs again, and to hear his dreams. Sovereign political power to Oberon herself, control over methane ice and labor and clones; to bring it all together under one flag. I don\u2019t know if I could sit still for all that, but I would like to meet this man, I think. So I wash myself and I look at my shaven head in the mirrors all around and I tell the boy, yes.\n Yes, he can run with the knife boys. He can go and see. For a little bit at first, he can be away from me. And if he is not where I tell him, at the end of an hour, the experiment will have failed, and we will negotiate again in a year.\n My sister says it\u2019s what father should have done. Let me off the leash a little bit. I\u2019d see both things, both worlds, like she does. Even young, she was able. Still in school she\u2019d come away, weekends or longer, running vents and shafts, tops of elevator cars, down the well to core, stolen showers. Sitting in the sounds. Near the bubble you can hear the magnetic field for space junk and solar rays; near the core you get the gravity sounds. Oberon sings to you everywhere.\n His favorite thing this year is to climb past the bubble, right at the obsidian ceiling of their sky\u2019s false night, so his ghostly reflection seems to stand on the surface of our moon. Proud as if he owns it, he stands, feet to secret feet. Little starfish on top of the world. Arms and legs crowding out the night, the stars. Little man bigger every day, little beast, asking for a name I can\u2019t give.\n I call him little brother, he wants to call me Mother. I call him little man, he wants to call me Wife. I call him little starfish, he wrinkles up his nose: When he wants names for things he doesn\u2019t want to play, but to be serious. To name them For All Time. For himself he wants a name like knife boys have, Torc or Jam or Siz. And to shout it, everywhere he goes.\n Sometimes his wildness I think comes from me. Sometimes I think it\u2019s how he was born. But one thing neither I nor my sisters ever was, is a boy. Do all little boys want this? This violence and empire? Father did, but Father\u2019s a special man. He wanted it more than anybody else in 36, wants it more than them still. Perhaps my son is special like that, too.\n I dream he unites the gangs in the walls, each and all. Bends them to his service. When I wake I am not proud, nor really afraid: Just crowded, face pushed gently into the wall, by a starfish.\n Do we need names? I ask. Would we know each other any better? He shakes his head, as if wiser than me. We don\u2019t need them, says the little man. We have them. We must find them!\n My sister calls me Deals, the name they called me in my knife days. I didn\u2019t like it then, nor now when she does it, but she at least must call me something.\n I have a feeling he tests himself with this, in his mind: If one day he\u2019ll be old enough to call me this name, to shock me with it, to test the lines and limits of our little two-man gang. Biding his time. Just as I did, before I found a crack and dropped straight down.\n But I didn\u2019t fall, I told her, so many times when we were young. Before my boy, and her colonist husband. I didn\u2019t fall, I was not pushed. I jumped. I jump every, every day.\n I leave him, then, in the care of my closest knife: a boy who fell into the same crack I did. We ran together. I suppose we were in charge. I thought he loved me, I didn\u2019t want to know for sure: It would only open up another crack for later. But if we didn\u2019t say it, I\u2019d never have to jump. It comes in handy.\n \u201cAs if he were our own,\u201d he swears, and looks at me a second like a broken thing. Like I\u2019m something he was promised, by the ice-skinned goddesses of Oberon, and yet denied.\n Our own, he says. I wonder who is the we.\n They\u2019re only sad as long as they remember to be. And then you go away from them, and the movie goes back to being about somebody else. Whoever is the we today.\n \u201cOne hour, brother,\u201d I say to the boy, and he nods, already embarrassed. Already reaching up and back for the hand of this knife boy, without even looking. Hungry, to touch his first man.\n \u201cOne hour, or the experiment\u2019s a failure?\u201d\n He nods, he blushes, he races away. Knife trailing behind, laughing with joy at him. The fierceness in his tiny self.\n \u201cBut he isn\u2019t ours,\u201d I want to say.\n He isn\u2019t even mine.\n This the first meeting, I said, would be short. Just coffee. I must dress myself like one of them, like a human. We\u2019re a legitimate political bloc, down in moon where they don\u2019t know to go; he\u2019ll know what I am. But I can\u2019t come dressed in a knife\u2019s jumpsuit with gashed knees: Into a dress. Legs pulled tight together, knees knocked. How the boy would laugh.\n \u201cForty minutes is all I can spare, but I am pleased to meet you. Regine speaks the world of you.\u201d\n He shakes my hand, his face near unreadable. I can see desire.\n I have forgotten why we\u2019re here. Perhaps to make my sister happy; perhaps he is a new crack. A new way to jump: Outward. Away from the core. He would probably call it up.\n \u201cYour sister\u2019s husband has been great. We\u2019re working on a merger, actually. He\u2019s been instrumental.\u201d\n I ask. He wants me to ask.\n \u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. We\u2019re interested in helping transition Oberon to a manufacturing plant. The bottom\u2019s fallen out of mining across the Uranus orbital, it\u2019s all heading inward, to the ice. So we\u2019re looking to build support, here among the people, and your district 36 has been . . . \u201d\n Not mine, not mine. I am not my father\u2019s, I am not the gate to this. I am mother to a starfish, and even that can be a goad. I think of dragging my sister backwards through a vent. Not a long distance, just enough to make her scream, as when we were girls. Just to show.\n \u201cBut of course that\u2019s not why your sister . . . We\u2019re already on quite good terms with 36, and as I understand you\u2019re not a citizen proper now, you\u2019re a . . . I\u2019m afraid of stepping on the . . . terminology? I want to learn.\u201d\n There is no terminology. No words in the in-between. Put names where they don\u2019t belong and suddenly you own that place. I shave my name off every day. Bleed if I had to.\n \u201cRunners, usually. Decentralized anarchist collectives, in the unused spaces. Ask a hundred of us, get a hundred answers. Our fellow Auberans call us runners. I say Nameless.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a very unique economy you\u2019ve built. Working in concert with the . . . \u201d\n \u201cEverybody chose. You bring with you this idea of somebody being on top and somebody oppressed, but that\u2019s . . . something you bring with you.\u201d\n \u201cMight I ask . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cAsk a hundred runners. Me, I found it too difficult to live only on the surfaces of things. It\u2019s not a planet or a moon anymore, it\u2019s a city. Deep as she is wide. You think in two dimensions\u2014lots of people do, my sister, my father\u2014I just never did. It made me feel . . . Compressed.\u201d\n More words maybe than I\u2019ve said in two weeks. More on this subject, certainly, than in seven years. He stares at me, this man. I still wouldn\u2019t know him in a crowd. That puffiness around their eyes. New gravity.\n \u201cI think that\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n \u201cI think it\u2019s correct.\u201d\n He doesn\u2019t begrudge me my tone, or smell, my quick turns of the head. Not that turned on, either. They look away sometimes, as at a thing they never saw before and must own, put a name on. Must crowd into, atop, against. But he\u2019s not one of those either. He\u2019s like Regine\u2019s man, I think: Complacent. Comfortable enough to find other ways fascinating, without wanting to devour them necessarily. To colonize.\n \u201c . . . Cloning. You\u2019ve done more on your moon in ten years than the rest of the Solar in a hundred, and those tanks sit fallow. Empty. A manufacturing base with self-sustaining crops and a workforce bolstered\u2014a gene pool, randomized to order\u2014by your dad\u2019s clone facilities. A new world.\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t turn in upon ourselves, like an ingrown hair. It\u2019s sustainable already.\u201d\n \u201cNot if those jobs convert to manufacturing, it\u2019s not. They\u2019re on the other moons. Looking into adaptations for the ice giant himself next. A net of satellites, supplying everything a world would need. The next Earth down there, and Oberon the jewel in the sky. You have the greatest engineers coming in on every shuttle . . . Do you follow the news at all?\u201d\n I don\u2019t giggle, but I chuckle. Of course I do, I\u2019m my father\u2019s daughter. Before I jumped I was one of them, one great scientific mind in a long line of them, all pressing down. He says this as if I am lucky. I am not lucky, nor am I unlucky: It\u2019s not relevant anymore. Her gravity is my blood, her ice is my skin. I am a native. But he does not begrudge, and this shines in him. His eyes wonder, shine, and we are equals; neither colonist nor colonized, neither refugee nor refuge.\n I could love him, I think gingerly. I need more information but I could love him.\n With five minutes left\u2014who could say what the starfish would do, if I came late\u2014I\u2019m unexcited to leave. His color rises when I ask to see him again; desire hardens into diamond. Whatever it is they want, I\u2019ve done it. At least enough for more.\n Across the zocalo of the third, down to the vent at the arena, quick loop up over the skyway and again, to a cleaner chute. Cozy old jumpsuit from a stash locker, and the long drop down, coreward, to the hollow place where we meet. Phyto paint on the walls, neoprimitive signs, in a hoax language. He\u2019s filthy, but all his limbs are there. All the arms and legs of him.\n Did he have fun, with the big boys? Oh my, indeed. Cheeks ruddy, eyes glossy; we\u2019ll sleep like ammonites, curled into infinity. Did he run, and fight with gravity? He shows me a tiny scab that won\u2019t even scar. Were the knife boys nice to him? Ever so.\n They gave him a book of funny animals and a tiny blunted knife of bone, and fed him on sugar and\u2014I was hoping, I knew he\u2019d adore it\u2014racked his arms and legs in grav boots, tossed him in the well. He floated up, and up, he says. Core a million billion feet up, starfished, looking down on the one piece of real moon: He says it glimmered, like a star. He means its plastic show box.\n \u201cI\u2019ve only ever done that once. The grav.\u201d Was I too afraid? I can\u2019t say yes, but I can\u2019t say no either.\n \u201cI like to be in control of myself,\u201d I say. \u201cMy parts.\u201d\n He says the gravity, through the rig, was like waves in port station. The pool\u2019s free for them, my sister used to take us there. \u201cYou could feel it passing up, lifting,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could ride it. It was my beast.\u201d\n He shows me a horse in his picture book: \u201cMe and the wind. Gravity. Looking down on a star, like it was mine.\u201d Not controlling him, he means. I\u2019m too weak for being afraid, he means, when for him it was his beast.\n He points to the letters, \u201cH-O-R-S-E,\u201d and looks proudly up. I smile, but he\u2019s known how to read since he was four. They set him down with this book and they thought, \u201cThat hermit girl won\u2019t care for letters and words and names. This little man, oh, without even those.\u201d Imagine how pleased they were with themselves, when he read it back to them. Like they\u2019d done it! And so quick, too. This is why I left the knives. This is why I cut my hair, move fast. If they want to be like them, just surfaces, why jump at all?\n We do wake curled. He will be gentled. I run my fingers through his curls, and he recounts his adventures. In just an hour, the world and stars opened to him. Some of the stories are like dreams, others are parables. Some of them, I think, even actually happened.\n He tests the skin around a bruise: This idea of Names, of legitimizing. The knives wanted to give him a nickname, something unlike little starfish, little man, but my friend their leader knew better than to let them. He said one day my boy would pick his own, and oh, the romance of that!\n He spends the better part of ten minutes just saying words. Some real, some real enough that you could see how he found his way to them. Testing them out upon his tongue. Against my ears.\n \u201c . . . Your friend says you have no love for Names. You run from them like a breach.\u201d\n He\u2019s right, I say. He said that just right. I miss him. If I had no little man, I would miss him more. Still, I do.\n \u201cWhen you think of the best name, little starfish, you will know it. Everywhere in you. Until then, you needn\u2019t hurry or feel pressured. It\u2019s not because I hate Names, or knives, or anything in our whole entire world. It loves us, as I love you. Oberon. She wraps herself, curls herself around us.\u201d\n He nods, distracted. \u201cSTARFISH,\u201d he pronounces, flipping through his book. Gleaming up at me: It is him.\n \u201cCut off an arm, another one grows. Forever and ever. Cut \u2019em all off, what have you got?\u201d\n A moon, cored and mined until it\u2019s a satellite of steel and heavy metals. A solid city, in the skeleton of a moon that was. A skin of ice. But the same name, always: Home.\n \u201cOnce the arms grow back, he\u2019s new,\u201d I say. \u201cSomething new and wonderful. He remembers what he was, but he grows and grows again.\u201d\n \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n Always. Every time. But he grows, nevertheless.\n Days after showers we go down core, to see the Wanderers. He is sometimes thoughtful, sometimes a pisspot, when we go. But I know he loves to hear them too.\n They call themselves Those Who Wander; for whom everywhere is home. Not specific to Oberon, they do have a major outpost here. They provide medical care; they\u2019re advocates in places we can\u2019t yet go; mostly they pray. I haven\u2019t ever spoken to one, but there\u2019s no point: Their oath says they don\u2019t stay anywhere longer than a year. Local. On Oberon, that\u2019s about a fortnight.\n I love them, their ceremonies and litanies, the solace of their words, but I would never join them. I have found what they are looking for: Everywhere is already home. The little starfish is, I am, all Oberon is home already. They\u2019re refugees from everywhere who think they\u2019re colonists of everywhere. They own the galaxy, it doesn\u2019t own them. I couldn\u2019t live that way.\n But this for them is only true in practice. In theory, they worship the God of those who choose no God. His are the ones are who cannot hide, cannot deny, cannot decide: This part, I like. He watches over those that don\u2019t care to be watched. He watches anyway. Their worship, then, is nothing at all. Nothing but the most beautiful music.\n \u201cThose who wander are the lost,\u201d they sing. \u201cThose who wander are not lost.\u201d\n And then a rising crescendo, in four- and five- and sometimes eight-part harmony:\n \u201cAll who wander are not lost. All of His are never lost . . . \u201d\n I am a moon, hollowed out and filled with gold. It is too much.\n A tiny starfish arm reaches up to my tears; he whispers softly, \u201cLittle sister. Oh, little mother.\u201d\n \u201c . . . All those who live were never lost.\u201d\n Our second date, he calls it this, is redoubled: Four hours, starfish safely in the care of knives. No refugee talk, not yet: This is for his betterment. There will be a time for overnights, knives in the dark, secrets of men. I have no wish to impede him. For now, four hours and we meet back up. And if we do not, the experiment is over.\n My sister\u2019s gift brings flowers, a smile. I am wearing that dress again, pulling at the hem. I couldn\u2019t bring flowers back to the berth; he\u2019d laugh and laugh at me. Like bringing home a cup of water to keep as a pet, he\u2019d say. I have taught him to have nothing, that the world is his. I think he believes it.\n \u201cBut where does it go from there?\u201d This man wants to know. \u201cIf this society is self-sustaining, and I honestly think it might be, with a population limited to this size, will there always be runners? Always Nameless?\u201d\n I have no idea. I have no good rationale for any one of the others. What would make a man, a woman, jump. We don\u2019t have one goal or want, neither needs nor angers. We wouldn\u2019t be who we are.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve said it, I think. A population limited not only to this size, but to familiar shapes of living. To the bubble, leaving things how they\u2019ve always been. Bringing your world here, to our moon, pretending it\u2019s the same. Some can do that, some go native. I think that\u2019s us. Me.\u201d\n He looks at me, confused. Not horror, but a relative.\n \u201cEvery human structure, though, has these things. Cities, stations, colonies, worlds. They\u2019ve all got a sewer system, environmental . . . All the \u2018unused\u2019 spaces, as you call them. What makes Oberon special?\u201d\n Nothing, man. Nothing at all.\n \u201cThe first human who stepped onto her ice changed her forever. A refuge, not a colony. That first foot stopped being Earthling or Martian or Loony, became Auberan. It was home. Not a going-to, but a coming-now-from. A born-forever-as. I don\u2019t know how these other human structures made their decisions, or how you decide what is for living, and who deserves to be there. What\u2019s a life and what\u2019s a vacation . . . \u201d\n I run my hand along a slick scalp, forcing him to look. The shine, the alien beauty. Auberan. Look here, I say without saying. Not the girl I would be, with hair, a Name. This thing you want to look at, now.\n \u201c . . . But I don\u2019t live in a fucking sewer.\u201d\n \u201cYou seem really angry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m tired. I look to see you questioning, doubting, judging and all I see is you trying. To look over your fence and into my . . . My lawn, my grass?\u201d\n \u201cYard. We had a big one, growing up.\u201d\n \u201cMy yard. I know you\u2019re trying. But it\u2019s writing a letter in a language we don\u2019t both speak . . . \u201d\n \u201c\u2014I have a visa. I\u2019m here for a standard year, unless I find a situation.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s our second date, man.\u201d\n \u201cI know. I just . . . I don\u2019t want you to think that I am some kind of colonist.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t. Not anymore. I think you are a good man. I think you\u2019ll do well, on the bubble. But I can\u2019t join you there. Not for a date, not for a life. Not to secure your visa, for sure . . . I have a son, did she tell you that?\u201d\n His eyes darken. He forms several beginnings, with his mouth. Breathes not a one.\n \u201cShe . . . did. Your family seems very interested.\u201d\n \u201cIn what?\u201d\n \u201cIn him. You.\u201d\n \u201cWell. I jumped. To love is to respect, inclusive. He doesn\u2019t miss me, if that\u2019s what. Especially with all this . . . politics. Imagine that. Hello Dad, hello, it\u2019s me! It\u2019s Deals The Knife!\u201d\n I laugh, a barking. It startles him; the bubble shivers, I feel them looking. I am embarrassed. Not for me, they can screw, but for him. This isn\u2019t what he wanted. It\u2019s what he asked for, but he didn\u2019t know. And anyway I\u2019m not a crazy knife girl, I\u2019m a hermit. A mother. A sister.\n I\u2019m a choice he can\u2019t hear explaining itself, no matter how he wants to. How hard he listens.\n \u201cI should go, I\u2019m . . . disappointing. Myself, and also you. A nice man.\u201d\n \u201cDeals, don\u2019t! I can\u2019t just . . . \u201d\n \u201cWe look across this glass between us and see . . . If the lights shifted, suddenly just your reflection, looking back. I\u2019m your dream, and you\u2019re a . . . perfectly fine fantasy. If you\u2019re the last colonist I ever meet, you\u2019ll have been the best possible one. But these are dreams. You will never be Auberan. You\u2019ll always be a refugee. And I\u2019ll be the best you could do . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou mustn\u2019t devalue your . . . \u201d\n \u201cNo. Man, no. I am doing the best I can do. I am the best I can do. You want to give a woman a home, as if I do not have one.\u201d\n He looks away, and nods. Giving me the gift of his real thinking. Nods again sharply.\n \u201cI do. That is what I want. I want to make a tiny earth, here upon your moon. On your home. With a son, and a beautiful woman. Like you.\u201d\n \u201cThen you must find her!\u201d\n \u201cBut I want you.\u201d\n I stand.\n \u201cYou have what everybody wants already. And you just keep wanting more. You crowd it out. The world, you crowd it out with wanting, with thinking that you\u2019re lost. You don\u2019t know what you want. Go to the Wanderers, they\u2019ll tell you: That\u2019s a gift.\u201d\n Hour to rendezvous. I rack up in a twisty-hole, curled around in a pipe as wide as I sitting am tall, back rounded to the curve, head upon my knees, to meditate on this.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make him evil,\u201d Regine would say. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make him Father. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything you didn\u2019t already know.\u201d\n And I would say, \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. I lost no innocence. But he was sadder for having known me. When he remembers to be sad again, he\u2019ll think of me. I will be a pain.\u201d\n And I would think, but never say, \u201cThis is why. This is why we jump.\u201d\n I think of sleeping. Cry a little bit instead. If I just wanted more.\n Twenty minutes behind schedule when I get it together. Head under an overflow, which he\u2019s not allowed to do. The water carries particulates from cooling the grav lines, it\u2019s maybe toxic, but it\u2019s wet. I\u2019m hurried, eyes puffy like I\u2019m new. He\u2019ll ask questions, and my knife will get that look, of a man who sees a woman crying and must, must try to fix it. And I\u2019ll . . . I cannot see that today.\n I am resolute, chanting. I am jumping, every day is a jump into fresh cracks. We write a new name and erase it. Of all who wander, none are lost. The silt from the off-drip gritting in my eyes, rushing to him. Cut across a civil square, still in my stupid funny dress. I could almost pass for a human.\n Across the well I see him, slap-jacks with the youngest knife boys. He loves it, laughing harder at the quick pain than he does the test of speed itself. Oh, what he\u2019ll do with that blunt knife. The million troubles of boys. When I was his age I thought I was one, but I had sense at least.\n His face turns to me like the sunflowers on 65, like the black-eyed Susans in my hand, forgotten, hydroponic, and grins. He is not sad to see me return, yet.\n A sudden hiss this close to a main vent means a breach. I drop into a forward roll; get knocked forty yards up the well, snatching at levels, as below us the well is engulfed in brief fire.\n I can barely see him, down below, but I know it\u2019s him. I\u2019d know him, always.\n Just as I know the policemen swarming in, from seemingly every direction, to take him up in arms, to spirit him\u2014just him, surgically leaving the knives to recover\u2014away, into the world. Away from core. Toward the embassies. The district offices.\n \u201cSolitude Unto Equinox,\u201d the banners say outside. They let the Hamlet Crater guys hold meetings outside the embassies, where surveillance is heaviest. The rallies are always the same: We must halt immigration for at least forty-two years, if Auberan society and culture have any chance of becoming something real, unique. We can mutate all we want, they say, but it always comes back to humanity. The control group of what\u2019s normal, who get to say what that is.\n They\u2019re not violent. They\u2019re probably right, even. Imagine a moment with nobody looking. No pieces shoved or tinkered in, no half-measures. Organic. They\u2019re probably very right. But shit can they talk.\n I accept a flyer on my way in, asking for my father at the first desk I reach. I can\u2019t even remember the layout. They wave me through, as if I\u2019m expected; people rush around, looking from the side of their eyes only, as if I am a lie they tell.\n \u201cCordie. Sit, lovely. I was going to offer a meal or something but you look just healthy as can be. Still shaving that head, I see. Do you want a change of clothes, or a shower . . . ?\u201d\n On one hand I am loath to accept his charity. Then too, I have recently been blown up.\n \u201cCaught in a vent near the well, so I just popped out into the fields. It was horrible, but I\u2019m uninjured. Regine would probably have enjoyed it.\u201d\n \u201cI saw on the news. It was actually a surface vent a few districts away, distributed the force of the blowout to the well itself. You were one of the unlucky few who happened to be in the vent path. It\u2019s a redundant system, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen it actually put into . . . \u201d\n I shuck my dress, drop it in the garbage; snatch up a too-large jumpsuit, pop it over my head. I don\u2019t want to chat. Father looks so old, and so beautiful. He\u2019s aged not ten but fifty years, somehow, since I jumped. I know every crack and grin that face could bloom. I remember him better, looking in his eyes, than anything in life. As if I\u2019d been looking at him all this time.\n \u201cFather. I hate to ask, but I\u2019ve misplaced something. In the blast. And I\u2019m pretty sure your men . . . \u201d\n \u201cThe police are a community-resourced and community-supported group of paid volunteers . . . \u201d\n \u201cFine. Our men. They may have absconded with something, um. Unlabeled as mine.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful, Cordie. And so smart.\u201d\n I go quiet, still. Footsteps passing a grill, when we were small. That chill, the thrill of a footfall.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve had us taped, then?\u201d\n \u201cSince you found him. I always kept tabs, of course\u2014I love you more than life\u2014but once the boy was out there, and you got ahold of him, it was prudent . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou. The cops swarmed in the very second it reached the well? Like they already knew?\u201d\n \u201cA fire broke out a few levels down, I couldn\u2019t risk him. Too important. And you were fine, of course. And I knew you\u2019d come to me. Hoped, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cYou took advantage of a disaster to kidnap my son, so we could . . . have a little chat?\u201d\n \u201cYour . . . Oh, Cordie. Son? Really? Isn\u2019t that against your bohemian ideals? \u2018Unlabeled as mine.\u2019 Oh, you little darling. Little hypocrite. Pantomiming with that cult, hoping Hamlet will take you, or blow me up, or . . . You want to control your child, but hate me for protecting you, in turn?\u201d\n \u201cYou sound angry, Father.\u201d\n \u201cI could never. I love you, child. I love you, you\u2019re my little girl. I love you for your rebellion. You bring me the most surprises. I love surprises.\u201d\n \u201cWrong. You do not love surprises. You control everything.\u201d\n \u201cI . . . Well, yes. I love our world, our little moon. Our colony here. I realize that looks like control, Cordie. But I\u2019ve got a surprise for you. You\u2019ve been saving the world, all along . . . \u201d\n \u201c\u2014Great. Are you going to give me back my . . . Are you going to put the child back in my care?\u201d\n \u201cOh my, yes. That\u2019s the whole point of the exercise. But let me tell you why.\u201d\n On third days we watch the spa workers, shuffling off to breaks. Twenty minutes, in and out.\n He\u2019s caught me staring, oh he has. The crinkle and the smile in his eyes, so familiar from the moment I found him, in a basket of rushes, like a fairy tale. That regal gait he took on, learning to walk as we Auberans do, along the soft edges of the well\u2014I knew that too. I thought it confirmed he was meant for me, that everything about him began and grew ever more familiar.\n My knife, the boy I left behind, used to say: It wouldn\u2019t be a promise if we made a clone of both of us. Half yours, half mine. Our child. No name. Maybe he was remembering this, when I brought him the boy. The ways of men. It wouldn\u2019t be a promise, he\u2019d said. Sweet boy, stupid boy. It wouldn\u2019t be a promise if it were just mine, or even just his. That, I could deal with.\n \u201cMother . . . \u201d\n \u201cCall me Sister. Call me Deals, if you want. Not that.\u201d\n \u201cDo you not love me? Ever since that day at the well, you . . . \u201d\n \u201cOh! I do, I love you more than Oberon. More than life. But I\u2019m not your mother. We can love each other just the same, you needn\u2019t name every single thing. Now, you had a question?\u201d\n \u201cI have hair on my head, and nowhere else. You have hair places everywhere, but not up top.\u201d\n I want to cover my body, suddenly. I am terrified, ashamed. I hold very still, betraying nothing. He mustn\u2019t be afraid. This mustn\u2019t be a bad moment.\n When he looks at me, who knows what he sees? Perhaps Mother would be better. Or worse.\n \u201cMen and women are different, little brother. You know I shave my head. But there are lots of other, smaller differences.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I am a man, I will not fit into our berth.\u201d\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re a man. Little starfish, you\u2019ll be king of this world. Just like Father wants.\u201d\n \u201cMy father?\u201d\n \u201cMine too. Do you remember him?\u201d\n The boy shivers. My son, my brother. My soft little father, getting bigger every day.\n \u201cHe wanted to eat me right up! He held my hand so tight. His arm across my shoulder, when they were taking pictures, it shook like a breach. I couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying really, I just said what he wanted when they asked me. I liked him, but he was shaky. Shaky hungry.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s getting old. He\u2019s going to need a replacement.\u201d\n \u201cLike a S-T-A-R-F-I-S-H. Or a clone, like they said at the press junket. Or like you say, about Oberon. Always growing more into what it always was. Even when the parts get replaced.\u201d\n I nod.\n \u201cJust like that. Exactly . . . Just like that. From now on, we\u2019re going to take our showers . . . \u201d\n \u201c\u2014Every third day!\u201d\n \u201cEvery third day, yes. But we\u2019re going to do it back-to-back. I\u2019ll still be here, and you\u2019ll be safe, but we\u2019ll wash this way from now on. We\u2019ll keep a lookout, like scouts. Do you think that\u2019s strange?\u201d\n He doesn\u2019t seem to mind; he turns his back obediently, singing little songs I\u2019ve never heard. Songs of men, probably. Songs of future kings. Songs of a lookout scout, growing fiercer every day. Songs of a starfish, beloved by a mother with no name.\n He turns his back, and I think I cannot look away from him. But of course I can. Eventually, I must. Solitude Unto Equinox.\n But then too I can sing. We can still sing together: We are never lost, we\u2019re already home.\n We will grow into exactly what we are.\n Jacob Clifton is a freelance writer and critic in Austin, Texas.

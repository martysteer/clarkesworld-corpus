Always wondered about that: falling, like it\u2019s an accident, tripping over or something.\n Our ship, Perseverance, drifted into the orbit of a planet we called Big Yellow. We were wandering lonely as a dust-cloud, having jumped away from some bad heat back in Primus sector; got our shields busted up, lost most of our fuel. So there we were, just sitting in the middle of nowhere, listless, aimless. I guess I was untethered too: isolated, restless, vulnerable to the gravitational pull of anything that might reel me in.\n I suppose I realize now how lonely I\u2019d been; alone in a crew of a hundred-an\u2019-fifty souls, if you can believe that. Not many were my sort: all by-the-book uniform types; \u201cyessir, no ma\u2019am,\u201d snap salutes and buzz-cuts.\n No one else with skin like mine, that\u2019s for sure. The discoloration was just a side effect of the gun-med drugs. Kept me alert but calm; eased the jitters; gave me a sure aim at two klicks. Earned me two stripes and a sweet pay raise, but I had to keep taking the drugs, so my skin was getting worse.\n \u201cYou look like a walking bruise,\u201d said Petrov, the medic. \u201cYou should let me check you over.\u201d\n \u201cYou think I look sick?\u201d\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s hardly . . . \u201d Her words drifted off. \u201cAll mottled purples like that. I\u2019ve never seen such a strong reaction to the gun-meds before.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine, really,\u201d I said.\n \u201cJust to be sure though, yes?\u201d I didn\u2019t reply. Her lips smiled at me, but her eyes did not. \u201cListen, I know you get a hard time about it.\u201d\n \u201cMost just give me a wide berth.\u201d\n \u201cBut some of the others . . . I know there are real bruises under all that too. Can\u2019t be easy.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean Mendez? Pretty rich, coming from the likes o\u2019 him and the other exo-framers. If you ask me they\u2019re the freakin\u2019 weirdos.\u201d\n \u201cI meant Siro.\u201d\n Gotta admit that came like a tail-slap from a raptor den-mother. Siro? That\u2019s insane. That\u2019s done with. But I don\u2019t say nothing.\n \u201cI think you like standing out because you want to be hurt,\u201d she says, just like that. \u201cBecause of your guilt. Over what happened between you two.\u201d\n \u201cI mean, why would you do that to yourself?\u201d I continued. \u201cHave chromium exo-strands attached over your limbs?\u201d\n Petrov frowns. \u201cAt least their frames are covered up. But you look so different.\u201d\n \u201cGuess this is how I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be. Why do you refuse the skin-bleach treatments?\u201d\n \u201cI ain\u2019t changing just to please A-holes like Mendez,\u201d I said, louder than I meant. Petrov was only trying to be nice. But Siro\u2014holy crap Petrov, what you go an\u2019 say that for?\n It was true that I\u2019d wanted to get far away from that part of my life, so when the chance came I signed up and jumped aboard Perseverance. Ship needed gunners to keep bandits at bay, but it didn\u2019t sound dangerous\u2014until Big Yellow caught our drift, pulling us down without enough juice in the thrusters to kick ourselves clear.\n The crew was pretty frazzled: out of the frying pan and all that. Too far out to reach the rest of the fleet with our sat-comms, plus we\u2019d lost our Admiral during that skirmish on Primus, so morale had taken a kicking and discipline was ragged. Someone suggested firing distress flares, but we didn\u2019t because you just don\u2019t know who is going to come looking for you. It was just us and that was that.\n All through the tense hours of gravitational descent we held meetings, planned some, prepped some: the Research team ran scans, looking for the usual stuff\u2014oxygen, water, food, some sort of useable biofuel source, so we could do a quick \u201ccompact, compost, and combust\u201d and get the hell away; the Medic team gave us shots for viruses that might be on the surface; the QM team ran a check on supplies, ammo, and atmos-suits; the Recon team geared up for touch down: kit-checks, going over call signs and drills; the Engineering team got to work on ship repairs, power-saves, and security lockdowns; and everyone made sure we were primed to defend ourselves from hostiles.\n Turned out, we needn\u2019t have worried so much. Big Yellow was pretty good to us: a breathable moist atmosphere, confirmed by our sensors as containing water, plus the planet had a bioenergy source\u2014though it would take weeks to harvest and process enough plant matter to see us on our way. Even so, we weren\u2019t too sure who or what else lived here . . .\n First time out, the Recon vehicles stayed on-radio all the time and gathered a shitload of data. No hostile encounters, nothing more\u2019n a few rodent-like creatures and a ton of creepy-crawlies, but that was to be expected, landing in a jungle. Things weren\u2019t gonna be easy, but we could make it if we held it together for a while. Everyone breathed easier.\n Second time out, not so good; the Recons went farther but lost contact. Thought we\u2019d lost \u2019em for good. Eventually they reported back. They\u2019d gotten surrounded by creatures, \u201cbugs,\u201d they called \u2019em, only they\u2019re the same size as us. Most were pretty freaked out by that. No harm done though: \u201cthe bugs don\u2019t bite,\u201d Recon guys said. Reckoned they were being studied, so these bugs got to be smart\u2014though one of Mendez\u2019s homies makes a crack about \u201cbeing probed.\u201d Huh, any bug would be smarter than those guys.\n Anyway, we debated our next move: we needed fuel but had to ration supplies. Staying on board weren\u2019t an option, but leaving the ship didn\u2019t appeal much neither. All told, the creatures made our minds up for us. They just came right out to the ship. Hardly surprising, a thing like that in your backyard\u2014pretty soon you\u2019ll come take a peek. Dozens of them showed up on the securi-screens.\n Cue another meeting on board. Some were for just blasting away, crippled ship or nothing; some were for meeting \u2019em, try and communicate. Of course, Mendez and his gang were all for tooling up.\n I just walked away. Doubt anyone even noticed. Got an atmos-suit on and went right out to meet them. Couldn\u2019t tell you why. Not exactly sure I wanted to die, but looking back in my heart, I was ready; the heart that went numb after Siro\u2014like it went black with frostbite or something. Anyhow, figured if I went out to see these bugs we\u2019d learn something; maybe cut through all the BS on-ship.\n I just stood at the bottom of bay doors. The creatures stood too, not moving, just . . . watching.\n Then one of these bugs\u2014\u201cinsect-folk,\u201d I prefer to call them\u2014moved forward, real slow. It wasn\u2019t aggressive; more like curious; shy, even. One of their leaders I figured, perhaps came to make peace. And that\u2019s how it started . . .\n . . . the sheen of her carapace shimmering in the light as she came toward me . . . never seen anything so beautiful in my whole goddamn life, like living art . . .\n I felt it was a \u201cshe\u201d on account of a delicacy in her manner made me reckon her female but really, I got no idea if they even have gender. All those colors, some I was pretty sure I never seen before . . . the way they caught the light. \u201cIridescent,\u201d Petrov says. Well, I was just mesmerized, no other way of saying it.\n Time passed. Hours or seconds, I don\u2019t know. Just me, staring.\n They got these compound eyelike features, either side of their heads\u2014hard to make out, but I\u2019m certain hers were fixed on me so the two of us was just as transfixed by the other. I walked forward, real slow, hands out. I got near to her and reached out, nice \u2018n\u2019 easy. She flinched, but she didn\u2019t pull away as I laid my fingertips upon her abdomen. It was cool to the touch, no friction at all, like porcelain. Cool, not cold; made me feel calm, peaceful. No one made me feel that since . . . him.\n Her antennae twitched, and I could tell she was figuring me out too. We connected, reading each other, right from the start. Petrov said most of the crew were horrified, though some always thought a weirdo like me would get along better with some not-human kind. Whatever. It proved the \u201cbugs\u201d weren\u2019t about to feed on our brains or nothing.\n Eventually a few others came out the bay to join me. We all spent a long time just watching the insect-folk and them watching us back, no one too sure what should happen next. If there was a protocol for this kinda meet \u2018n\u2019 greet, it weren\u2019t in the manual.\n The insects started to retreat, all at once. I took it as an invitation. Don\u2019t ask me how, but I knew they wanted me to follow. Nothing ventured, right? So they lead off into the jungle, and I go with them. The Recon team leader barked in my earpiece to stand-down, but I just disabled my comms and strode off.\n Me and the insect-folk walk a few klicks, by my reckoning. The one that came to me first stays alongside me all the while, like she\u2019s my guide. I reach my hand out, real gentle, brush my fingertips along her back. Her hind wing-pair thrummed away\u2014letting me know she was pleased. That\u2019s what I wanted to think anyway. A whole new planet laid out before me, but I could barely take my eyes off her. I was nervous, sure, but that excited kind of nervous you get when you go off into the unknown, too high on good feelings to be wary of danger. And when someone makes you feel like that, you just know . . .\n Never really knew what I should call her. If they have names they ain\u2019t told me, but it felt right to call her something, so I decided on \u201cRose.\u201d Used to know someone called Rose I liked; suppose that\u2019s why.\n I stayed through the night. They watched me closely all the while, all up close around me, their antennae twitching close to my face. Rose never left my side, and I liked that\u2014felt like she wanted to reassure me.\n I think they figured out how and what we breathe and eat because after a while they brought me some clear liquid in this shell-like thing. Didn\u2019t smell of anything, so I thought what the hell, an\u2019 I drank it. It was water, close as I could tell. Then later they brought me some leaves. They smelled okay and were dark green, so I figured probably full of good stuff. I bit off a bit. It tasted like spinach, so I munched some more and didn\u2019t feel unwell or nothing\u2014bit like one of them macro-salads they lab-grow back on ship.\n Guess I already knew I was staying forever.\n Days passed with me being center of the universe, so it felt. As they studied me I was picking up some of how they are. They live in groups in these kinda cave pods made of some chitin-like substance they chew out, like wet, mashed-up chalk in all different colors, and use their proboscis to paste on. Once it has dried hard and smoothed out, it is beautiful\u2014colors flowing together, half-patterns appearing and then blendin\u2019 into something else. They take pride in this, I think; like it\u2019s a sort of art for them. Shows they got a \u201csense of aesthetic,\u201d as Petrov would say.\n Though they ain\u2019t got our tech, they don\u2019t seem to need any. No electrics but no need for heat, as it\u2019s always warm; their food grows on trees\u2014reassuring me they weren\u2019t about to tuck into yours truly\u2014and they don\u2019t need vehicles because they don\u2019t need to go nowhere. They got water and sanitation figured out good enough; pretty tuned into nature I\u2019d say. Simple, uncomplicated, balanced. I liked that. There was something relaxed but efficient about them: they got what they need, need what they got. No frills, no fuss. The peacefulness of it all was pretty sweet\u2014felt like somewhere a person could really get their shit together.\n Days later one of our Recon vehicles pulls up nearby. The insects were all agitated by that, and I was anxious too. I didn\u2019t want a situation, so I went out to meet it.\n The Reconners looked shabby, ragged, desperate\u2014I saw them for what they were I guess: crooks and mercenaries. (In my head I\u2019m already thinking of the crew as them, rather than us, I notice.) Just looters with lasers: come to steal but prepared to hurt. But Petrov was with them too, so maybe there was hope.\n \u201cCaptain Nkuru wants you to report back,\u201d shouted one of \u2019em.\n \u201cNo shit,\u201d I said, \u201csince when was she voted captain?\u201d\n \u201cSince just after you disobeyed orders,\u201d shouted the Recon team leader, \u201cyou goddamned stupid\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSince the crew council voted her in, shortly after you left,\u201d butted in Petrov. \u201cShe wants to know what you\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n \u201cGet in the vehicle, you fucking freak,\u201d said the Reconner. Petrov said nothing but the look in her eyes told me it was the only way.\n Later, during my debrief with Captain Nkuru\u2014in which I was pretty close to being court-martialed, like I could give a crap\u2014she told me she wanted me to go back, befriend them, and then get them to move on. Turns out they live right over the top of some vein of minerals that could give us a payday to return home with. Captain gave me the details, but I wasn\u2019t listening. Can\u2019t go digging under someone\u2019s house just because you think you\u2019ve struck oil.\n I was confined to med-deck, with Petrov running \u201cobservations\u201d on me: testing for viruses an\u2019 such. Reckon she was also ordered to do a psych-eval too, only she was real subtle about it, just making conversation, not taking notes.\n \u201cSo?\u201d she said.\n I smiled. Where the fuck do I start? I told her what I could.\n \u201cI was worried.\u201d I look in her eyes, and I know it\u2019s true. \u201cHow did you know they wouldn\u2019t harm you?\u201d\n \u201cJust did, I guess.\u201d\n \u201cExactly. You guessed.\u201d\n \u201cIt was more than that. They liked me.\u201d\n Petrov shook her head a little. \u201cI think you just want someone\u2014or something\u2014to like you.\u201d\n I ignore that. \u201cI\u2019m sure they liked me.\u201d Petrov raises her eyebrows, but I continue. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m in tune with them. I . . . I can\u2019t explain, except that, after a while with them, I kinda get what they mean. Least I think I do.\u201d\n \u201cYou think. Do they speak?\u201d\n \u201cNo; well yeah, sort of. They ain\u2019t got speech, but they have a language of sorts. It\u2019s all scents and symbols from what I figured.\u201d\n \u201cThey write?\u201d\n \u201cNot how we know it. They emit a spray from that long thin part they all got.\u201d\n \u201cProboscis,\u201d said Petrov.\n \u201cYeah. An\u2019 they pattern shapes in the air, carrying messages in their scents. I just breathe it in like I\u2019m supposed to be reading the message, but really I\u2019m just caught up in the spell of it.\u201d\n Petrov stares at me, like I\u2019m the alien, and she\u2019s trying to read my message but can\u2019t make it out. \u201cAnd you told the Captain this?\u201d\n \u201cFuck, no.\u201d\n Perseverance was in power-down mode so we could store up juice, so it was like perma-night on board. Most crew stayed in quarters when not on duty. I couldn\u2019t sleep on board no more. Somehow the air didn\u2019t feel quite right: too recycled, fake\u2014plus I didn\u2019t wanna breathe in what someone like Mendez had already breathed out.\n Couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Rose. The way she observed me, curious about me, made me feel important, whereas Petrov observed me out of suspicion. I had to see Rose, but I was confined to ship, Captain Nkuru\u2019s orders. Felt cooped up an\u2019 skittish, so I took to roaming \u2019round the ship like a cat on a hot titanium roof.\n On the way to the mess hall, I brushed past Mendez and his posse. It was bound to happen.\n \u201cAhh shit,\u201d he says to me. \u201cNow I gotta go have a detox scrub. Who knows what bugs the bugs might have,\u201d he said. All his cronies laugh. Assholes, I thought, but I didn\u2019t say it. No point\u2014an \u201cexo\u201d like him could squash a regular like me like . . . a bug. Could\u2019ve pointed out their frames were kinda like exoskeletons the insect-folk have, so they were the bug-like ones . . . but why bother?\n One of them shoves me as they go past. Their internal hydraulic system makes \u2019em way too powerful, and I crashed against the wall. If I weren\u2019t purple already that sure as shit would\u2019ve done it. But lying there all groggy-headed got me real clearheaded at the same time.\n Went straight down to the armory and got myself suited \u2018n\u2019 booted with Recon gear and a long-haul supplies pack. The young corporal on duty challenged me a little, until he saw theplas-machete strapped in my thigh holster. Whatever. I was out the ship and gone. Orders be damned.\n I found Rose easily, like I had a trace of her scent or something. Like she wanted me to find her. When she saw me, her antennae made this little dancing move. Yeah, she was pleased. It was good to be home.\n Over a few more days, I began to recognize some of the scents the insects secrete, as well as some of their gestures. It\u2019s how you put them together: a certain scent with one gesture means one thing, but with a different gesture means something else. Somehow I got a sense of what they\u2019re saying. I mean, I\u2019m never gonna have the faculties for all the scents, but I learned to make some signs with my hands, nice and big\u2014they seemed to know what I meant.\n This time it took two weeks for the Reconners to track me down. I noticed it first in the reaction of the insects; antennae all twitching at once, frenetically scurrying around. Minutes later, I picked up on the rumble of vehicles\u2014typical of those Recons, no attempt at stealth, like they didn\u2019t have nothing to be afraid of; as if this place was their backyard.\n I got my las-gun and tried to tell Rose to stay put and keep all her folk together. I wasn\u2019t sure if she got my meaning\u2014guess she never seen me so anxious either\u2014but there wasn\u2019t time to explain a second time.\n Half a klick away, three Recon buggies crashed through the foliage, scattering anything that lived in the undergrowth. I got myself tucked up high into the leafy canopy, well out of their sight line, and waited.\n Eventually the Reconners stopped and got out. They were all kitted up for the kill, a dozen or so of them. Petrov was there too though, so it meant they were gonna play good cop first.\n They took up guard positions. Most weren\u2019t really watching out though\u2014just shooting the shit, chewing baccy, swigging liquor. Discipline must\u2019ve slipped back on Perseverance. The old Admiral would\u2019ve had them in the brig for that, but now it was a slacker regimen\u2014I could see it all in their swagger. Kings of the frickin\u2019 jungle. I knew now there was nothing stopping them from crossing the line.\n Petrov stayed in the vehicle. Looked like she was about to puke, all tense and frowning. One glimpse of her face was enough to tell me how this was gonna go.\n One of Mendez\u2019s goons spoke on the sat-comm: \u201cPerseverance, this is Recon. In position. What\u2019s the order?\u201d\n Up in the trees I couldn\u2019t hear the reply from ship, but I saw the dude give a nod to Mendez, and he pumped his hand-rifle.\n \u201cFormation, on my lead,\u201d he yelled. The rest of his crew of exo-framers primed their tools. Some had these shit-eatin\u2019 grins that got me real riled up.\n On my belly, I got my las-gun sighted and stilled my breathing. Lined one of them up and squeezed the trigger. He went down, a nice neat las-hole in his leg. The exo-frame would stop it going through bone, but it would sting like a motherfucker, and he\u2019d be down a while.\n The others freaked, firing rounds at nowhere in particular: they didn\u2019t have a damned clue where I was. I took another, through the shoulder this time. He squealed. Petrov will fix you, I thought.Just go back to ship. Go back. Go back . . .\n Mendez hollered to hold fire. All went still for a few seconds. I popped one more, right on the butt. Laughed my ass off as he went down, clutching his. It wasn\u2019t gonna kill him though. Got to draw the line somewhere.\n They scurried for cover, squatting down by the buggies. They looked scared; rare for a bunch of exos\u2014too used to wading in toe-to-toe. That\u2019s fine against bandits in Primus sector, where pace and power count. Don\u2019t count for shit against an invisible sniper with a grudge.\n Petrov got out of her vehicle. She was unarmed. Mendez yelled at her, but she must\u2019ve known I weren\u2019t gonna shoot her. \u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d she said, scanning the tree line for a sight of me. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d I didn\u2019t say nothing in return. I slid down through the vegetation, staying out of sight. Petrov walked to the edge of the clearing, facing the foliage as if she were talking to it. I was only a few dozen yards from her, still hidden. \u201cI know things didn\u2019t work out on the ship,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here\u2019s a chance to get back into Captain\u2019s good books.\u201d\n \u201cCap\u2019n can go stick her books where she likes.\u201d I said it quiet, so only Petrov would hear.\n She turned to face the direction my voice had come from. \u201cI suppose that is a \u2018no\u2019 then,\u201d she said in a low tone. \u201cYou really mean to stay here, don\u2019t you.\u201d Petrov said it like a statement, not a question. She already knew the answer. She looked sad and shook her head. I\u2019d seen that look before, way too many times, from way too many people: my folks, crewmates, Siro . . . means the same whoever it comes from. Disappointed in you. Only one never did it was Rose.\n And then Rose was just behind me. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be here! I was goddamn terrified for her. But she inclined her head-parts toward me, like she wanted to tell me everything is okay. I put my hand on her back and breathed. I felt her coolness, the gentle thrum that vibrates through her; watched the villi on her nape oscillating, like they were dancing in the breeze. Something calming about her presence I can\u2019t explain.\n \u201cThere\u2019s something good here for me,\u201d I whisper in Petrov\u2019s direction.\n She nodded. \u201cHow do you know you\u2019ll be safe?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t. Ain\u2019t safe on board neither.\u201d I saw Mendez edging forward, a few hundred feet back. \u201cThe insect-folk actually like me. Trust me too, I think.\u201d\n \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\n \u201cWatch, learn, live. No orders, no drills. Just . . . exist.\u201d\n Petrov\u2019s shoulders sagged. She\u2019d tried.\n Mendez was much closer now, blaster raised. \u201cYou got one chance to help us move them out. Only way I\u2019m not going to blast you to hell, you stupid bug-fucker.\u201d\n Fucking Mendez. Wanting to kill everything that weren\u2019t like him (as if being like him was so great). Never understood the insect-folk, never wanted to. And you kill what you fear, and you fear what you don\u2019t understand, right?\n Well, maybe I never really understood that guy, but I definitely feared him.\n So I killed him.\n One shot. A beauty, exactly where it would pass through his exo-frame. Surgical precision. Cutting out a cancer, perhaps. He stared at the hole in his side as his legs buckled.\n Mendez\u2019s crew was stunned. They shouted, cursed, made threats\u2014the usual. They were gonna start shooting any second and this time they knew where to aim. But it was like they were waiting for someone to give the order.\n Petrov turned to face them, holding up her arms. \u201cNo!\u201d she yelled. Everyone froze. She went over to one of them, took his sat-comm radio, asked to speak to the Captain. She got pretty worked up, but I didn\u2019t hear what she said. Eventually she was done talking and without ever looking over her shoulder, Petrov got them to haul Mendez\u2019s body into a vehicle and move out.\n Guess I made my choice, and I got to live with it. Strange thing was, I actually shed tears\u2014mostly from all the adrenalin fizzing \u2019round in me, but it was the first time I killed someone (even though it was Mendez). Sometimes things just creep up on you like that.\n Once Rose and I got back amongst the insects they came around me, all buzzing and stuff. Guess they hadn\u2019t seen no one cry before\u2014like they got to study and process it. Rose stayed up close, stroking my face with her antennae\u2014so gentle, like she was trying to comfort me. It worked. Sensitive folk, the insects.\n Life went on, and I learned more all the time. I watched them chatter with their scent-gestures, getting a handle on it all, and I think I figured out what Rose found so curious about me. They love colors and to them, certain colors are \u201causpicious.\u201d (There\u2019s a word Petrov would\u2019ve used.) A fine word for \u201clucky,\u201d but anyway, purple is their thing and with me looking like a damson-berry \u2019cause of the gun-meds, I think I was a kind of good omen.\n It was never a sexual thing with me an\u2019 Rose\u2014haven\u2019t even figured out yet how they do it\u2014but I could live without that. We had ourselves a sort of intimacy that was like a stage beyond sex: a feeling of well-being, without all the huffing \u2018n\u2019 puffing that goes with it.\n They don\u2019t consider themselves individuals the same way we do: Everything is social with them, all about the group. I think they even share thoughts. Sure as shit that would freak out most folk back home, but the insects make it work. Access to information, ideas, decisions. Got an equality to it, like everyone is part of the community. A lot we could learn from that. Then again, not sure I\u2019d wanna know the thoughts of guys like Mendez. But anyway, I don\u2019t have to think of them no more: Perseverance went on its way a good while ago. Heard it from miles away.\n Rose has been spending much of her time alone of late, not so much with her kind but not so much with me neither. I figure she\u2019s been getting a bit of a hard time from some of the others. Pretty sure I\u2019m the reason.\n Don\u2019t know if I make them nervous, \u2019cause maybe they didn\u2019t reckon on me sticking around. Maybe I\u2019m just too strange for them after all, but Rose hasn\u2019t been interacting with the rest like normal. Maybe my weirdness is leaving its taint on her too. I wonder if being close to me was just some sort of interesting experiment, or maybe even some sort of rebellion against the ways of her own kind. Perhaps some attempt on her part to be . . . different.\n The other day several of them surrounded her, all frantic gesturing, and there was a definite sour note in the air. Rose was low on her hind legs, like she was hemmed in by them all. I saw a few of them gesture in the direction of me and also my las-gun, propped up inside the pod. Reckon they\u2019re still shaken by what happened with Mendez. Probably the biggest thing to ever happen \u2019round here. Was a first contact for them too of course, except they can\u2019t just fly off, or forget all about it\u2014not with me still here. Maybe I thought I could be their protector, but now Perseverance has gone I bet they\u2019re wondering who they really need protecting from.\n Rose turned in my direction, and then away; didn\u2019t respond when I waved to her. Don\u2019t have to be human to get what that meant. Maybe now my gun-meds are wearing off and my skin ain\u2019t so colorful I\u2019m not as exotic as I was. Not auspicious.\n I watch as she crawls to an empty pod . . .\n . . . the sheen of her carapace shimmering in the light as she turns away from me . . . never seen anything so beautiful in my whole goddamn life; like living art . . .\n I could never hurt her, or any of \u2019em. I\u2019ve broken beautiful things before, and I ain\u2019t going back to that. I pick up my las-gun. A few of the insect-folk are watching me, but that\u2019s ok: I want them to watch\u2014even if Rose can\u2019t look my way. I dismantle the las-gun piece by piece, laying each part carefully on the floor in front of me, hoping my meaning is clear. You kill what you fear, and you fear what you don\u2019t understand, right? Well, I understand, so there\u2019s nothing to fear.\n Once it is done I sit there, knees up into my chest. It is a damned humid night. I just stare at what is left of my gun, just a scatter of pieces that didn\u2019t make sense; parts without partners, odd-shaped bits that have no meaning when they\u2019re apart from the others.\n I feel dismantled. I\u2019m a piece removed.\n Reckon I will head out alone once it gets light. I think of Siro, all those years ago, and I feel cold.\n Richard Webb writes long and short SFFH fiction and has been published in Teleport Magazine, Legends (NewCon Press, BloodMoon Rising, ReMastered Words, and StarShipSofa, among others.

It\u2019s just math. Wrong place, wrong time. Bad luck; too bad, so sad.\nWe\u2019ve all heard such stories, told them, shared them, collected them. Not in the way that we collect trinkets; more like how a sock collects holes. We\u2019re submerged in such stories, we breathe them in like carbon dioxide\u2014poisonous, in the long term, but a fact of life, nonetheless.\nBut stories have authors, from the gauziest fantasy to grim autobiography. And when once upon a time becomes so many, many times, surely someone must think to ask: had to die? On whose authority?\nIt\u2019s simple physics, of course. Natural law.\nUnless, of course, someone\u2019s been fudging the numbers.\n\u00c1lvarez is standing beside the airlock as it cycles, pretending not to hear the girl cry.\nIf he acts like he can\u2019t see her, can\u2019t hear her, then at least he\u2019s leaving her some dignity. Right?\nAs if there\u2019s any dignity to be had in this godforsaken mess. As if it\u2019s dignified to jump out of an airlock in nothing but a jumpsuit and your stockinged feet. As if anyone could have a reason to hold her head up high after she\u2019s been told her dumbass little stowaway life is worth less than the razor-thin fuel margin that will safely decelerate this dropship when it reaches its destination.\nThe math is nauseatingly simple. There\u2019s no other ship with a possible intercept course. There\u2019s no other drop ship that can get the dying colonists at August Minor the nanotherapy antivirals they need. There\u2019s no give in the physics of it all\u2014only in the squishy human parts of the equation.\nThere\u2019s still something wrong, here. Or, if not wrong, then at least not right. \u00c1lvarez just can\u2019t put his finger on what, yet.\nThe airlock clanks; it\u2019s fully dilated on this side, now. The kid blows her nose on her sleeve. Sharra. Her name is Sharra. She deserves the dignity of a name, at least. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says. Her voice doesn\u2019t break. God, how does her voice not break? \u201cFor trying.\u201d\nShe\u2019s walking to her death to save him, a man twice her age, and a bunch of colonists she\u2019ll never meet, and she\u2019s thanking him? This isn\u2019t the big wrongness, the one that\u2019s underlined every moment since he pulled her out of the nanotherapy storage capsule, but it\u2019s a damned big one anyway. When she lets go of the loop and floats up toward the airlock, he grabs her by the sleeve\u2014too hard\u2014so that she bounces lightly against the inside hull of the drop ship. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, into her too-close face. \u201cNo, fuck this. We\u2019ll figure something out. We will.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when she starts crying for real: not when she thinks she\u2019s about to die, but when God sends something down the mountain and there\u2019s still a chance it might be a ram. When the tears get too big, they float up from her face and pelt him, like rain in reverse. He grabs her and crushes her against him, and she cries like he thinks babies must cry before they get taught that pain is something to hide.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he says, into the top of her head. He never had kids\u2014a drop ship pilot\u2019s life is not exactly conducive to parenthood\u2014but for a moment, this one, little dumbass stowaway that she is, is his kid, is every kid. \u201cWe never should have had to make the\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014choice.\u201d Mollie Maggia\u2019s sisters talk in whispers. In the back room of the little tenement apartment, Mollie is sleeping; Mollie is dying. \u201cMoney or health. Money or your life. The bastards. What else were we supposed to do?\u201d\nTheir mother is at the stove, stirring the sauce for supper. Every now and then, she puts a hand in her pocket and fingers the pitted black tooth that lies at the bottom, the latest one collected from Mollie\u2019s mouth. When she closes her eyes, she remembers the first time Mollie came home from the watch factory with a gleaming greenish smile. How they\u2019d all exclaimed, how they\u2019d laughed. My pretty girl, she\u2019d said. So proud. Such a good living, such a good girl. My beauty.\nShe would take this pain away from her daughter and make it her own, if she could. She digs harder with her wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pot, and doesn\u2019t wipe away the sweat that rolls into her eyes. This is her daughter\u2014and even if she wasn\u2019t, even if she were someone else\u2019s, good God, she\u2019s only twenty-four, still a child. The spoon clatters to the floor and Mrs. Maggia leans against the kitchen wall. Who are they, the factory owners and foremen and faceless scientists in their white coats, to put this on her? Some man at a desk, totting up columns in his ledger: profit on this side, little girls\u2019 lives on the other. Who gave them the right?\nNo one gave them the right. It\u2019s something that they took. And it\u2019s not something one woman can snatch back all on her own, not even when the little girl who had to die upon that time was her very own.\nArmed only with the cheap-ass screwdrivers from the ship\u2019s repair kit, \u00c1lvarez and the kid do their best to tear the drop ship apart. The ship wasn\u2019t outfitted with the proper tools to be strip-mined from the inside out; hindsight is, as ever, a bitch. Together they chuck anything they can get out the airlock: cleaning supplies, every last scrap of food, \u00c1lvarez\u2019s spare uniform and all of his bedding that can be torn loose from the wall. They even manage to rip up one of the metal panels lining the ship\u2019s interior, one that hadn\u2019t been screwed in squarely. The rest are flush and refuse to budge. The lone panel goes out the airlock anyway, one more piece of space junk. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t become another drop ship\u2019s urgent problem someday\u2014but space is big, and the inside of the drop ship is small.\nThey do the math, with each piece of mass that goes flying off on a new career as interstellar jetsam. They crunch the numbers\u2014and the numbers crunch back. It\u2019s not enough. Not enough to add up to a single scrawny kid with her whole damn life ahead of her.\nIf he could flush the whole water system and run dry all the way into August Minor, that would be more than enough. But he can\u2019t find a manual release, not on the hardware itself and not in the emergency handbook in his handheld, and there\u2019s an emergency rationing shutoff if he tries to draw too much at once. Water water everywhere, and not a drop to sink.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Sharra says, as he curses out the plumbing. Her tone is leaden; too bad he can\u2019t throw that out the airlock. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault anyway. I wanted to see my mom and dad. They\u2019ll die along with everyone else, if these supplies don\u2019t get there in time. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fine!\u201d He punches the water filtration unit, which does no harm other than sending him rebounding across the ship. \u201cJust let me think. There\u2019s something I\u2019m missing, I know it.\u201d There must be a way out. No one had to\u2014\n\u201c\u2014die.\u201d Russayev mops his brow with a handkerchief as he and Yuri trudge together up the cement-block stairwell. They keep moving, their voices buried beneath the echo of their footfalls. It\u2019s not safe to stop; every ear is always listening. It\u2019s not safe to return to Russayev\u2019s apartment; if the Party hasn\u2019t bugged it yet, that\u2019s due only to incompetence, not will.\n\u201cNo one had to die.\u201d Yuri Gagarin is only thirty-four, and he moves heavily, like an old man. Guilt lays extra weight across his shoulders. When a man lays down his life for yours, that\u2019s a weight you\u2019ll carry the rest of your days. Vladimir Komarov knew what he was doing, who he was saving, when he stepped aboard the Soyuz-1. \u201cBut he did anyway. We all knew the flight was doomed. They knew it too.\u201d\nHis lips barely move around the word they. Best not to say aloud who they are, to name a thing gives it power, and Yuri holds too little power already to surrender more. He keeps folders full of well-creased papers inscribed with pleas for his help: dear Comrade Gagarin, Esteemed Hero of the USSR; can he not pull the strings to secure an officer\u2019s commission for this excellent young man, can he not see that this good daughter of the Fatherland be admitted to university despite her father\u2019s Jewish heritage? Can he not snap his fingers and make medicine, food, housing rain down upon the comrades who esteem him so?\nHe cannot. He cannot, could not even when he had friends in the Politburo, and he has only enemies there now. Komarov died to save a hero of the Soviet Union who has never really existed.\nHe fumbles for a cigarette, but his pocket is empty. Russayev produces a pair, and they smoke in silence, finally still, as the air grays around them.\n\u201cI should have done something else to keep him grounded,\u201d Yuri says, the words floating out of him on his smoky breath. Dangerous words, and the smoke does nothing to obscure the truth of them.\nRussayev shakes his head, holding the smoke in. \u201cThey had already made up their minds.\u201d The nebulous they again, an all-hearing hobgoblin invoked if his name is spoken thrice. \u201cNo evidence could have changed that. There was nothing to be done.\u201d He claps Yuri\u2019s shoulder firmly, briefly. Yuri has forgotten his jacket and Russayev\u2019s hand is cold through his shirt. \u201cI should go.\u201d\nHe should. Yuri stays, sitting alone on the stairs, smoking until only ash remains. Ash, and doubt. Like guilt, doubt is a cruel master to bear for the rest of one\u2019s life. But, Yuri knows, even then, he has not so much life left ahead of him that he cannot bear it, for a little while. His knuckles tap restlessly against the battered aluminum tread on the step.\nGuilt is often all that\u2019s left when what we should be feeling\u2014anger\u2014is an inconvenience to the people with blood on their hands and fingers on the scale.\nThe data refuse to make sense. Fucking rude, if you ask \u00c1lvarez.\nHe queries and re-queries his interface station, poring over the numbers, until his anxiously firing neurons finally strike a connection. The naughty data resolves into one vicious big picture. He knows what it is he\u2019s been missing. Oh god, does he know what it is.\nHis jolt of hysterical laughter brings the kid\u2019s head up. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demands. She bobs over his shoulder, almost hitting her head on the bulkhead, to peer at the interface. As if she can make heads or tails of the techno-jumble on the screen. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThe launch,\u201d he says. \u201cChrist. The launch.\u201d He highlights one particular figure in red. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the deceleration. There was extra mass on board when we were accelerating, too.\u201d Her blank, frightened face wakes an obscure anger in him. He swipes one arm hard, wiping away the calculation display. \u201cEven if I did push you out the airlock\u2014fuck, I\u2019m not going to do that, I said \u2018even if I did\u2019\u2014there\u2019s still not enough fuel left for me all on my own.\u201d The margin was razor-thin; the kind of margin you could cut yourself open on. He rides another wave of hysterical laughter into dissociation, into the euphoria of perfect understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fucked since the get-go.\u201d\nShe stares at him. Her eyes are huge and dark in the big gray moon of her stupid sixteen-year-old face. \u201cI killed you,\u201d she says. \u201cI killed you. I killed you I killed you I\u2014\u201d\nShe\u2019s beating her own head and chest and shoulders with her fists, and Christ, \u00c1lvarez has never done zero-g wrestling before, let alone with somebody half his size whose dumbass head he would just as soon not split on the bulkhead, because if they\u2019re both going to die out here, and they are, why the fuck should they have to do it alone?\nWhen she\u2019s calmer (which is certainly not to say calm), he produces a small plastic pouch from inside his flight suit. Her lips curls at the sight of it. \u201cThat\u2019s extra mass.\u201d It sounds like a curse word, the way she says it.\n\u201cI know. I was planning to piss it out the airlock pretty soon here.\u201d He opens the outside lid and squeezes some of the liquid inside into his mouth, then offers it to her. She takes a tiny sip and gags, sending tiny spheres of whiskey into orbit around \u00c1lvarez. She shoves the flask back at him; he takes it with a shrug. Plastic-flavored liquor is better than none. It\u2019s not really enough to take the edge off. It was meant to be a victory toast upon a successful touchdown, not an opportunity for self-medication. But it seems a damn shame to waste it.\n\u201cI hate physics,\u201d she says as he takes another pull.\nHe wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. Gone already. The caramel flavor lingers on the back of his tongue. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m allowed to hate the thing that\u2019s killing me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not physics that\u2019s killing us.\u201d He throws the empty pouch at the inside of the airlock door. It bounces off and spins lazily across the inside of the drop ship. \u201cIt\u2019s some accountant in Winnipeg who fucked us over to save the company some cash.\u201d Whose cold calculation was it? How much did it save? Twenty, thirty thousand bucks. A single externality: one small human life. Cheap as hell, all things considered. \u201cMoney\u2019s all that counts. Who cares what happens to the likes of\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014us?\u201d Ha Wan shouts into the railroad foreman\u2019s face, so that his spittle flecks the man\u2019s brown beard. Perhaps he would take a swing at the foreman, too; but with what? One of his arms terminates just below the elbow, the other at the narrow point of a wrist. Sweat crowns his forehead, and the sour stench of sickness clings to him, to the stained bandages on the stumps of his arms. There is a list, on the foreman\u2019s table, of employees to be paid for their time. Ha Wan\u2019s name is not on it. \u201cMy family depends on me!\u201d\nThe foreman doesn\u2019t speak Cantonese, and the fever has curtained off whatever part of Ha Wan the English words occupy. Would it matter, if the foreman understood him? What would that change? His countrymen pull him away from the table, before the foreman\u2019s bully boys can intervene. They try to lead him back to his cot, but he pulls away before they can stuff him back inside the hot, half-dark tent. They do not follow as he stumbles out into the scrubby highlands. Each of them is exhausted, too, spirits hammered flat with every blow of their iron mallets, every blast of dynamite. And how far can he go, they ask themselves, alone, on foot?\nNot far. Dizziness catches him first, then exhaustion, and he crashes knees-first into the side of a boxcar laden with lumber for the new line. Bright new lines of pain crawl up through the dull, enveloping ache, and the morphine haze; he has scraped his back on the rough metal. Two drops of blood strike the sandy soil. In the dust-scratched sunlight, they already look faded and brown. Ha Wan is only surprised that he has blood left to lose.\nAlone, what difference can one human being make? More than you think. Change comes incrementally. This is a symphony\u2014not a solo.\n\u00c1lvarez is supposed to be sleeping. Instead, he and the girl drift in silence, separately. Less than sixteen hours out from August Minor now.\nHe thinks the kid\u2019s asleep, her breathing uninterrupted by hitches and starts. A polyp of snot hangs by a thread from her upper lip, and her face looks sunken, dehydrated.\nGrief is exhausting. But \u00c1lvarez isn\u2019t tired. There\u2019s an artery beating a staccato fringecore rhythm in his neck and an acid burn at the back of his throat. Periodically, he reminds himself that he absolutely cannot throw up right now.\nHe and the kid have fallen into opposing patterns, her spinning in place roughly clockwise, him counterclockwise. They\u2019ve only known each other a little while, but there\u2019s a strange sense of belonging here, this person inextricably tied to him over the course of hours in a way that feels like DNA, or more than that, like she\u2019s sprung fully formed from the bulkhead of his own ship. A fractal spiderweb of veins spreads at her temples, maps to places that have never existed and never will.\nFor another few rotations, \u00c1lvarez studies these subtle geometries, seeking the kind of organic understanding that doesn\u2019t come from math anyway. Then he uses one hand to quietly push himself toward the computer. One more set of numbers to crunch, between her and oblivion.\nThe math doesn\u2019t cooperate willingly. But \u00c1lvarez doesn\u2019t ask nicely. He smashes the physics wide open like his own personal pi\u00f1ata, bashing it with calculations on fuel reserves and trajectories and human gravitational tolerance. There should have been fail-safes and backups, extra reserves. There should have been possibilities\u2014possibilities other than the company literally nickel-and-diming two people to their deaths. There should have been a world where this story has a happy ending.\nNo, fuck that: there should be a world where this story has an ending at all. Because as \u00c1lvarez sees it, staring down the sawed-off barrel of the ugly math, staring down the long line of failures and accidents and miscalculations just like this one, it\u2019s never actually gotten around to ending before. It\u2019s the same goddamn story, told over and over in a Moebius loop of tragedy. Once upon a time, the people in charge told some peons they had to die, so they did. Rinse and repeat.\nHe pauses, eyes unfocused, staring into his screen until the numbers blur and run. How much pain has he already poured into this job? The backaches, the solitude, the exoskeleton he has to cram himself into whenever he gets to spend a hot minute on the ground somewhere. Pain is the only truly renewable resource, and it\u2019s the only asset the corporation has never stinted with.\nHe swipes away his calculation and keys in a simple message. Then he pushes off and glides silently across the capsule, to the airlock control. His hands aren\u2019t shaking. He thought he\u2019d be more nervous, but his neurological system can\u2019t work up to a proper panic: dulled by the booze or short-circuited by the recent excess of adrenaline.\nThe cover flips up. He flexes his hands; he\u2019ll have to move fast, before the kid realizes what\u2019s happening. He keys in the control sequence.\nThe first door cycles open. He moves.\nA wiry hand latches onto the back of his suit. \u201cNo!\u201d the girl screams, as they flip end over end away from the airlock, a graceless ballet. \u201cNo! No! Don\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cLet go! Shit\u2014\u201d He struggles to free himself, but her grip is strong, and she clings to his back like a strangling vine. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to push you!\u201d\n\u201cI know what you were going to do!\u201d Her shriek in his ear makes him wince and they rebound together off the far bulkhead. \u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cI can.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to hurt her, is the problem. It\u2019s like wrestling a lizard, one of those tiny little wall-climbers that were always all over the house where he grew up in Iowa, fast and sneaky but so small and fragile. He tries to pull her up and over his head. \u201cLet go!\u201d\nShe\u2019s less concerned about hurting him. Her fingers snag tight in his jumpsuit, and she draws blood through the cheap fabric. \u201cDammit!\u201d he hisses, but the jolt of pain is enough for him to tear her loose. He pushes her away and the momentum sends him flying toward the airlock, her away from it.\nShe scrambles to reorient herself\u2014too slow. He keys the code on the other side and the airlock seals itself shut between them. \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d he shouts, through the metal door. She bangs on the other side, swearing viciously. \u201cThe ground crew at August Minor will talk you through deceleration. You don\u2019t have to land a ship; they\u2019ll be able to send a local shuttle up for you.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair!\u201d she screams, which is a stupid-ass thing to say, but she\u2019s young, so he lets it go. \u201cStop it! Stop it! You can\u2019t do this!\u201d\n\u201cAgain, I think you\u2019ll find I can.\u201d He grins crookedly, then remembers she can\u2019t see him. \u201cI\u2019ve made my decision. It\u2019s okay. In fact, I\u2019ve never been more sure in\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014my life!\u201d Humasha\u2019s fingernails have splintered against the brown-stained stone of the garment factory wall. It\u2019s already ninety degrees in Savar Upazila, and the dust and humidity make her feel as if she\u2019s breathing mud. \u201cChild, there are still people alive under there, I swear it. Help me dig!\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t know the young woman standing beside her; she doesn\u2019t work on Humasha\u2019s line. A cut in her forehead has masked half her face in dust-caked blood; a careless hand has painted bruising all around the wound too. \u201cAuntie, no!\u201d Either she\u2019s younger than Humasha guessed, or fear throws her voice high and small. \u201cCome away from there. It\u2019s not stable!\u201d\nHumasha does not come away. The building wasn\u2019t stable when they walked in to work that morning, either, or any other day that week. Some accountant, perhaps on the other side of the world, had decided that a sturdier factory wasn\u2019t worth cutting into the profit margin on cheap T-shirts. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me, girl?\u201d One lump of rubble comes away, under her weight; there are so many, many more that remain, and the voices of the trapped are small and far and frightened. Lost in a man-made underworld. Somewhere, above ground or below, someone is weeping. \u201cThey are still alive down there.\u201d\nThe girl shuffles back. Blood drips from the point of her chin onto her pink shari: one spot, two, three. A constellation in miniature. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to join them, auntie!\u201d\nHumasha is not young, but age has not made her weak. Her ankles and knees pop as she forces herself upright and grabs the girl by the wrist. \u201cYou think you\u2019re better than them?\u201d she snaps. \u201cYou are spared? Special?\u201d She shakes the girl by the arm. \u201cIt\u2019s luck that we\u2019re up here and they aren\u2019t. That\u2019s all. You hear? It could always be you, next time. You know that? You want someone else to dig\u2014when it\u2019s you at the bottom of the heap?\u201d\nThe girl yanks her arm, twisting it out of Humasha\u2019s grasp. They both stumble; the girl catches herself first and sets her feet. She does not look at Humasha\u2019s face, but she kneels and forces her fingers into the crack between two broken fragments of what used to be a wall. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a next time,\u201d she mutters and winces as she leans back against the rock\u2019s recalcitrant mass.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t,\u201d says Humasha, leaving ten tracks of her own blood on the opposite side of the stone. She pushes, the girl pulls, the rock tumbles free. \u201cFill your belly with shouldn\u2019t and see how long \u2019til you\u2019re hungry again.\u201d\nThere is another stone, beneath the first, and they set their strength against that too. There is always another stone.\nHave you been following along closely? We\u2019re coming to the hands-on portion of the exercise.\nDon\u2019t feel guilty. Find your anger.\nYou\u2019re going to need it.\nThe girl pounds on the closed airlock; she smashes the keypad, but she doesn\u2019t know the magical password to reveal the secret passage.\nThe astronaut reaches for the internal keypad. It\u2019s cold in the airlock, and his fingers shake; he mistypes the code the first time. He puts his hands in his armpits to snatch a last moment\u2019s warmth. Perhaps he should have recorded a message, for his sister and her family. Too late now. Too late. But this is the only thing left for him. This is the right thing, because all the other options that remain are too ugly to choose.\nThe girl hasn\u2019t stopped screaming. She\u2019s so loud they must be able to hear her on August Minor, he thinks, and his lips fail to fit themselves into a smile. Loud enough to wake the dead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d she howls again. \u201cSomeone do something!\u201d\nBut there isn\u2019t anyone left who could, or would.\nIs there?\nSomewhere, sometime, a man sits behind his desk, killing a girl with the stroke of his pen. Not because he hates her; he feels nothing for her at all. To him she is a simple tool, an externality. An inconvenient hunk of mass. It\u2019s never his fault that she dies, of course, even as he damns her over and over again. He\u2019s just doing his job. We must, the men at desks insist, chalk her death up to the cold uncaring universe in which we live.\nThat\u2019s the point, of course. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.\nPhysics are impersonal, the fabric of reality, the canvas onto which we paint our lives. Physics existed before us. Math was created by human beings; and that is why math knows how to be cruel.\nOther things than cruelty can still be taught, given time. Given opportunity.\nIf one man can kill a girl with the stroke of a pen, what can the rest of us do?\nIt\u2019s easy to decry his callousness, to raise our voices and shout over him. But this girl is not Tinkerbell, and a show of hands and a little noise will not be enough to bring her back. It\u2019s not enough, it never was, just to point at the evil and name it for what it is (though that is the starting place).\nFeel your feet on the floor, or the line where your back meets your chair. You\u2019re stronger than you think. There are some desks that need to be flipped, and they need you to flip them.\nSome of them are heavy, but don\u2019t worry: you won\u2019t be expected to set your shoulder to them alone. Some of those desks will have men behind them, clutching pens and indignation. Some people will be very upset at the very notion of a desk that\u2019s the wrong side up.\nBut there\u2019s a girl out there whose life is hanging in the balance. She\u2019s going to need you to get out in front and push.\nYes, you.\nAll of you.\nSo push already.\nIt\u2019s not fair!\nMollie Maggia\u2019s mother pounds her fists against the kitchen wall: one, then the other. Then both. Again. It\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not fair, her little girl, her angel, rotting alive in her own bed. She leans into the wall with all her weight, driving her grief into the cheap plaster, and when her other daughters run into the kitchen to see what\u2019s wrong, she slaps them away and slams her whole body against the wall so that the little apartment trembles in its foundations. \u201cNot one more girl,\u201d she sobs, and she shouldn\u2019t be crying, not in front of her daughters, grown women themselves, but there is a blackened tooth in her pocket, and it weighs a thousand pounds, and she pushes her whole being into the door under that terrible weight. \u201cNot someone else\u2019s baby.\u201d\nSomeone do something!\nYuri\u2019s knuckles twist harder into the aluminum strip on the stair. He grinds his fist down, though the rough pattern scrapes off a layer of skin and the blood squeezes between his clenched fingers. He could have stepped in. It could have been him instead. It should never have to be anyone else, not again. He pushes his hand into the stair until the bones in his wrists grind together.\nIt\u2019s not fair!\nThere can be, under the weight of injustice, a certain terrible strength, and it weaves itself into Ha Wan\u2019s muscle and bone. His legs flex and the air drives out of his body as he puts his back against the boxcar. His foot almost slips on the gravel, but he centers his weight and pushes again. There is a soft wail, like the call of a far-off locomotive, and it is coming from his throat. One more great thrust, the scrapes in his back tearing anew, and the front wheel of the boxcar squeals its dismay. It does not tip over, though he would like it to, for the railroad runs on suffering as much as coal. But he pushes anyway.\nSomeone do something!\nHumasha and the girl aren\u2019t alone. The emergency responders, the neighborhood, they dig together. They keep digging. There are people in the rubble. There are lives that might yet be saved, rock by rock, pebble by pebble, every last one worth the price in blood and toil to bring it into the light of the sun. \u201cPush!\u201d a medic yells, and six men and women set their shoulders against a fallen-in wall. They strain, someone curses, another groans. The wall shifts, and the wall moves. Daylight crawls over the cracked table that had been hidden underneath. A hand emerges, stretching, trembling. More hands reach down to meet it.\nYou, too. It might not feel like much, your little body fighting the terrible gravity of that cold arithmetic.\nBut it is so much. It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s all there is.\nSo push!\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\nThe entire drop ship decelerates as if slapped by the careless hand of God. \u00c1lvarez is thrown against the side of the airlock under the unexpected arrival of G-forces; the girl\u2019s cry is cut off as she too is flung aside.\nShit. Shit. What the shit was that? He mashes in the code to open up the internal airlock again, even though it\u2019s going to be a hundred times harder to get past the kid this time, he has to make sure she\u2019s not concussed or hemorrhaging or otherwise a waste of a goddamn sacrifice.\nShe\u2019s got a bloody nose, which has made a nightmarish three-dimensional abstract painting of the drop ship\u2019s interior, but seems otherwise mostly unharmed. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asks, voice thick with blood and confusion. \u201cDid we hit something?\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have. We wouldn\u2019t be here to have this conversation at all.\u201d He nudges her aside to check his screens. Nothing out of the ordinary, all systems green. Except\u2014\nIf a man at a desk can kill a girl with a little bit of ink, then we can save her in exactly the same way. There are more of us than there are of him. Break his pen, throw it out the window, and send the desk after it.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be right.\u201d He checks the readout again, double-checks it; does a quick-and-dirty visual verification against the star field visible through the porthole over his head. It can\u2019t be right. And yet, it is.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nToo much for him to sum up, too much to explain away, except in one little word: \u201cNothing.\u201d He bobs aside and shows her the screen that projects their trajectory toward August Minor. Everything is, impossibly, green. \u201cWe\u2019ll make planetfall just ahead of schedule. Six hundred twelve, local planetary time.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t blink, as if closing her eyes on the display will wipe it from existence. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cHow could that have happened?\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\nShe clings to the pilot\u2019s seat, adrift, still fixed on the readout. The glow of the screen paints her over with a pale green glow, and when she smiles slowly, her teeth shine in the dark drop ship. \u201cNow what?\u201d\n\u00c1lvarez doesn\u2019t have an easy answer for her. When a miracle hands your life back to you, what do you do with that? How can you ever pay it back?\n\u201cI guess . . . I guess now I\u2019ll go home. Back to Earth, I mean.\u201d Home can mean a lot of different things to a drop ship pilot. The ship hums gently around them, anthropomorphically innocent, as if it didn\u2019t nearly become their mutual coffin.\n\u201cHome.\u201d She\u2019s staring at the screens, as if not blinking for a solid minute will make the readouts comprehensible to her. For her, home is the people waiting on August Minor. \u201cWhy Earth?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s where Company HQ is. Thought I\u2019d pay them a visit.\u201d He keys in the deceleration sequence and smiles, his lips pulling tight over his dry teeth. Miracles are hungry things. He\u2019ll feed this one by living long enough to be a pain in the company\u2019s ass. \u201cThere\u2019s a few desks there that I\u2019d like to flip.\u201d\nPain is a renewable resource.\nTime to see how well it burns.\nAimee Ogden is a former software tester and science teacher; now she writes stories about sad astronauts and space mermaids.

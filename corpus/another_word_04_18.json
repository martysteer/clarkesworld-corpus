I was never that kid. My parents gave me my very own cassette recorder at the age five or six. When I wasn\u2019t listening to read-along Alice in Wonderland, I would lock myself in the bathroom and record inspirational speeches about how important it was for people to love one another and to put good things out into the world. Not long after, I became an actress on stage and television.\n As an audio narrator, my voice has never been my problem. But breath . . . good heavens. I have come to hate my own breath.\n When my debut fantasy novel Enchanted sold to the big NY publishers in 2010, my friends at Brilliance Audio asked if I wanted to narrate my own book. I knew enough about voice acting to know how severely lacking I was in practical experience, so I declined. I wanted Katy Kellgren, I told them, my Audio Dream Girl. (And I got her, bless her beautiful, dearly-departed soul.)\n But their suggestion both flattered and inspired me. I bought a Blue Snowball mic, downloaded Audacity, and started Princess Alethea\u2019s Fairy Tale Theatre in an effort to teach myself everything I could about voice recording.\n Seven years later, I contribute my voice regularly to IGMS and the various Escape Artists podcasts. I just upgraded my Blanket Fort Studio into a rather posh recording booth.\n Room noise was always a constant annoyance. I met someone from NPR who told me about the cheap trick of throwing a blanket over my head. During my tenure as a judge for the Audie Awards, I learned how many successful Audio publishers got started in a walk-in closet, due to the sound-dampening effects created by masses of clothes. I spent a lot of time sweating under blankets and huddled in closets. I envied the professional studios at Brilliance Audio and the home studios of my friends (looks at Kate Baker). The walk-in closet in my house here in Florida has a little alcove cut in the back\u2014as if fate put it there\u2014just for me. Thus, Blanket Fort Studio was born.\n Another one of the first lessons we all learn at the beginning is to SLOW DOWN. I worked hard on that. I taught myself how to breathe while recording (there are also mouth exercises/forms you can train yourself to do to keep your tongue, lips, and teeth out of the way when speaking). I learned where to place the microphone. I bought green apples to reduce mouth noise. I practiced all the sensible and silly tricks. Once I became comfortable with the details, I got to settle into the characters.\n THIS is where all that acting I did as a kid comes in. For me, it\u2019s like putting on comfy clothes. This is where I get to make the magic.\n Kate Baker and I recorded my Wild & Wishful, Dark & Dreaming in her home studio. Kate did the heavy lifting and narrated the lion\u2019s share of the collection. I popped in like a Special Guest Appearance, reading both of the poems and a few of the shorter flash pieces. I hoped my contributions wouldn\u2019t be too much of a departure from Kate\u2019s narration\u2014she and I have very different styles of delivery. Kate\u2019s voice is calm, even, and intimate. I\u2019m still that emphatic Greek girl on stage, projecting all the way to the back row.\n I loved reading in Kate\u2019s studio. LOVED it. The poetry in particular. I remember at one point, in the middle of \u201cDeathday\u201d\u2014I felt like Megan Follows delivering Anne Shirley\u2019s passionate recitation of \u201cThe Highwayman\u201d to a room full of Canadian sophisticates. It felt beautiful.\n When I asked Kate about my pieces later, she said something like, \u201cYou have the kind of energy audiobook readers love. I wish I could do that.\u201d\n Now, let\u2019s remember, Kate is the one whose honeyed voice has brought home multiple awards. I still consider myself quite the glorified amateur. But when she asked me to explain my process, to describe just how I conjure my magic inside that studio, I found myself at a bit of a loss for words.\n \u201cWrite it for me, then,\u201d she said.\n So here I am, per Kate\u2019s request, to attempt this near-impossible feat. Ready? Okay. Here we go.\n First, I read the manuscript. Scan it through. It\u2019s an obvious first step, but that\u2019s where I start. I pinpoint every name and word that might trip me up and get those questions back to the author ASAP.\n Then, I read the manuscript again. This time, with the eye of the actress-cum-writer. Who are the characters in the story? Not just their names . . . who are they? What are their ages? Their backgrounds? What do they want from the main character? If it\u2019s the main character, what do they want from life?\n I consider voice\u2014not just the characters, but the voice of the piece as a whole. The tone. If I am not the author of the piece, I don\u2019t know what the intention was as written. So how does it speak to me as a reader? How dark will we be getting? How sexy? How hopeful? What message will this story ultimately convey? I look for places where I might need to build intensity and where I might consider pulling the punch\u2014letting the words deliver the power instead of my voice.\n Then I read it out loud. This is where the magic happens. I say magic, because this step is where my subconscious takes over. This is the part that\u2019s harder to convey.\n When I read a story out loud, two things happen with the voice.\n The first is accent. Sometimes I am given specific direction with the accent, like in Steve Vernon\u2019s Nova Scotia ghost story, or Bogi Tak\u00e1cs\u2019s Hungarian SF \u201cGiven Sufficient Desperation.\u201d Sometimes, the accent evolves as I read the tale. I wasn\u2019t three sentences into H. L. Fullerton\u2019s, \u201cA Century of Princes\u201d before it started coming out in a British accent. So, I went with it. I turned the assignment in early, just in case IGMS wanted me to redo it, but they didn\u2019t.\n Rati Mehrotra personally thanked me for giving an accent to the women of \u201cIn the Woods, My Voice.\u201d Again, not a conscious choice. That\u2019s just how her story read to me.\n For the piece I just finished for Escape Pod, Samantha Henderson\u2019s \u201cMy Generations Shall Praise,\u201d I was partway through the first reading when I thought, \u201cI should maybe do this in a southern accent.\u201d They hadn\u2019t asked for such a thing, but I was getting that sense. As soon as I hit the \u201cBless your heart,\u201d line, I knew my gut had been right once again.\n Since \u201cGenerations\u201d was the first project I did in the renovated studio, I ended up having to record it quite a few times. First time around, I was too close to the mic. Second time around I shifted my position partway through the reading, which meant I had to go back and record the first section again. But during all those readings, that second magic thing happened with my voice.\n Rehearsing a piece\u2014be it for an audio recording or a live performance\u2014still feels like prepping for an audition. You get to the point where you\u2019ve read that same monologue so many times, you become the character. You add laughter into lines where there had been no direction to do so, because that\u2019s what your character would have done. You insert a scoff or two. A bit of mockery. A bit of melodrama. The character becomes real to you in a way that\u2019s different from how it becomes real to the author or the listener. The character becomes real inside you.\n The reason I shifted partway into the second reading was because that was the moment I became my character. I had leaned back against the studio wall, tired and disaffected. I wasn\u2019t Princess Alethea anymore. I was a sociopathic baby killer on death row, debating whether or not to allow my rich cousin to map herself onto my brain meat when I was gone. I worked all the angles, all the way up \u2019til the end.\n I think, perhaps, it might be my best performance to date.\n But that\u2019s the point of this exercise: to never stop learning. To constantly be improving. To call on those ghost of my past\u2014all that acting muscle memory\u2014and put it to good use. To breathe life into characters brilliantly penned, adding my voice to the author\u2019s in a magnificent collaboration.\n And, ultimately, to continue putting good things out into the world.\n Alethea Kontis is a princess, author, fairy godmother, and geek.

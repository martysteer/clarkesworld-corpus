The car continued on the track, but it took over a minute for it to reach the gel lock at Nahiku West and pass through into the atmosphere. No one expected to find Key Lu alive, but as soon as the car repressurized, he woke up.\n Sometimes, it\u2019s a crime not to die.\n I stepped into the interrogation chamber. Key had been sitting on one of two padded couches, but when he saw me he bolted to his feet. I stood very still, hearing the door lock behind me. Nothing in Key\u2019s background indicated he was a violent man, but prisoners sometimes panic. I raised my hand slightly, as a gel ribbon armed with a paralytic spray slid from my forearm to my palm, ready for use if it came to that.\n \u201cPlease,\u201d I said, keeping the ribbon carefully concealed. \u201cSit down.\u201d\n Key slowly subsided onto the couch, never taking his frightened eyes off me.\n Most of the celestial cities restrict the height and weight of residents to minimize the consumption of volatiles, but Commonwealth police officers are required to be taller and more muscular than the average citizen. I used to be a smaller man, but during my time at the academy adjustments were made. I faced Key Lu with a physical presence optimized to trigger a sense of intimidation in the back brain of a nervous suspect, an effect enhanced by the black fabric of my uniform. Its design was simple\u2014shorts cuffed at the knees and a lightweight pullover with long sleeves that covered the small arsenal of chemical ribbons I carried on my forearms\u2014but its light-swallowing color set me apart from the bright fashions of the celestial cities.\n I sat down on the couch opposite Key Lu. He was a well-designed man, nothing eccentric about him, just another good-looking citizen. His hair was presently blond, his eyebrows darker. His balanced face lacked strong features. The only thing notable about him was his injuries. Dark bruises surrounded his eyes and their whites had turned red from burst blood vessels. More bruises discolored swollen tissue beneath his coppery skin.\n We studied each other for several seconds, both knowing what was at stake. I was first to speak. \u201cI\u2019m Officer Zeke Choy\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know who you are.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014of the Commonwealth Police, the watch officer here at Nahiku.\u201d\n The oldest celestial cities orbited Earth, but Nahiku was newer. It was one in a cluster of three orbital habitats that circled the Sun together, just inside the procession of Venus.\n Key Lu addressed me again, with the polite insistence of a desperate man. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the quirk, Officer Choy. I thought I was legal.\u201d\n The machine voice of a Dull Intelligence whispered into my auditory nerve that he was lying. I already knew that, but I nodded anyway, pretending to believe him.\n The DI was housed within my atrium, a neural organ that served as an interface between mind and machine. Atriums are a legal enhancement\u2014they don\u2019t change human biology\u2014but Key Lu\u2019s quirked physiology that had allowed him to survive short-term exposure to hard vacuum was definitely not.\n I was sure his quirk had been done before the age of consent. He\u2019d been born in the Far Reaches among the fragile holdings of the asteroid prospectors, where it must have looked like a reasonable gamble to bioengineer some insurance into his system. Years had passed since then; enforcement had grown stricter. Though Key Lu looked perfectly ordinary, by the law of the Commonwealth, he wasn\u2019t even human.\n I met his gaze, hoping he was no fool. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me anything I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d I warned him.\n I let him consider this for several seconds before I went on. \u201cYour enhancement is illegal under the statutes of the Commonwealth\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI understand that, but I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n I nodded my approval of this lie. I needed to maintain the fiction that he hadn\u2019t known. It was the only way I could help him. \u201cI\u2019ll need your consent to remove it.\u201d\n A spark of hope ignited in his bloodied eyes. \u201cYes! Yes, of course.\u201d\n \u201cSo recorded.\u201d I stood, determined to get the quirk out of his system as soon as possible, before awkward questions could be asked. \u201cTreatment can begin right\u2014\u201d\n The door to the interrogation room opened.\n I was so startled, I turned with my hand half raised, ready to trigger the ribbon of paralytic still hidden in my palm\u2014only to see Magistrate Glory Mina walk in, flanked by two uniformed cops I\u2019d never seen before.\n My DI sent the ribbon retreating back up my forearm while I greeted Glory with a scowl. Nahiku was my territory. I was the only cop assigned to the little city and I was used to having my own way\u2014but with the magistrate\u2019s arrival I\u2019d just been overridden.\n Goods travel on robotic ships between the celestial cities, but people rarely do. We ghost instead. A ghost\u2014an electronic persona\u2014moves between the data gates at the speed of light. Most ghosts are received on a machine grid or within the virtual reality of a host\u2019s atrium, but every city keeps a cold-storage mausoleum. If you have the money\u2014or if you\u2019re a cop\u2014you can grow a duplicate body in another city, fully replicated hard copy, ready to roll.\n Glory Mina presided over the circuit court based out of Red Star, the primary city in our little cluster. She would have had to put her Red Star body into cold storage before waking up the copy here at Nahiku, but that was hardly more than half an hour\u2019s effort. From the eight cops who had husks stashed in the mausoleum, she\u2019d probably pulled two at random to make up the officers for her court.\n I was supposed to get a notification any time a husk in the mausoleum woke up, but obviously she\u2019d overridden that too.\n Glory Mina was a small woman with skin the color of cinnamon, and thick, shiny black hair that she kept in a stubble cut. She looked at me curiously, her eyebrows arched. \u201cOfficer Choy, I saw the incident report, but I missed your request for a court.\u201d\n The two cops had positioned themselves on either side of the door.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t file a request, Magistrate.\u201d\n \u201cAnd why not?\u201d\n \u201cThis is not a criminal case.\u201d\n No doubt her DI dutifully informed her I was lying\u2014not that she couldn\u2019t figure that out for herself. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s been determined, Officer Choy. There are records that still need to be considered, which have not made their way into the case file.\u201d\n I had looked into Key Lu\u2019s background. I knew he never translated his persona into an electronic ghost. If he\u2019d ever done so, his illegal quirk would have been detected when he passed through a data gate. I knew he\u2019d never kept a backup record that could be used to restore his body in case of accident. Again, if he\u2019d done so, his quirk would have been revealed. And he never, ever physically left Nahiku, because without a doubt he would have been exposed when he passed through a port gate. The court could use any one of those circumstances to justify interrogation under a coercive drug\u2014which is why I hadn\u2019t included any of it in the case file.\n \u201cMagistrate, this is a minor case\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThere are no minor cases, Officer Choy. You\u2019re dismissed for now, but please, wait outside.\u201d\n There was nothing else I could do. I left the room knowing Key Lu was a dead man.\n I could have cleaned things up if I\u2019d just had more time. I could have cured Key Lu. I\u2019m a molecular designer and my skills are the reason I was drafted into the Commonwealth police.\n Technically, I could have refused to join, but then my home city of Haskins would have been assessed a huge fine\u2014and the city council would have tried to pass the debt on to me. So I consoled myself with the knowledge that I would be working on the cutting edge of molecular research and, swallowing my misgivings, I swore to uphold the laws of the Commonwealth, however arcane and asinine they might be.\n I worked hard at my job. I tried to do some good, and though I skirted the boundaries now and then, I made very sure I never went too far because if I got myself fired, the debt for my training would be on me, and the contracts I\u2019d have to take to pay that off didn\u2019t bear thinking on.\n The magistrate required me to attend the execution, assigning me to stand watch beside the door. I used a mood patch to ensure a proper state of detachment. It\u2019s a technique they taught us at the academy, and as I watched the two other officers escort Key Lu into the room, I could tell from their faces they were tranked too, while Key Lu was glassy-eyed, more heavily sedated than the rest of us.\n He was guided to a cushioned chair. One of the cops worked an IV into his arm. Five civilians were present, seated in a half circle on either side of the magistrate. One of them was weeping. Her name was Hera Poliu. I knew her because she was a friend of my intimate, Tishembra Indens\u2014but Tishembra had never mentioned that Hera and Key were involved.\n The magistrate spoke, summarizing the crime and the sanctity of Commonwealth law, reminding us the law existed to guard society\u2019s shared idea of what it means to be human, and that the consequences of violating the law were mandated to be both swift and certain. She nodded at one of the cops, who turned a knob on the IV line, admitting an additional ingredient to the feed. Key Lu slumped and closed his eyes. Hera wept louder, but it was already over.\n Nahiku was justly famed for its vista walls that transformed blank corridors into fantasy spaces. On Level 7 West, where I lived, the theme was a wilderness maze enhanced by faint rainforest scents, rustling leaves, bird song, and ghostly puffs of humidity. Apartment doors didn\u2019t appear until you asked for them.\n The path forked. I went right. Behind me, a woman called my name, \u201cOfficer Choy!\u201d Her voice was loud and so vindictive that when the DI whispered in my mind, Hera Poliu, I thought, No way. I knew Hera and she didn\u2019t sound like that. I turned fast.\n It was Hera all right, but not like I\u2019d ever seen her. Her fists were clenched, her face flushed, her brows knit in a furious scowl. The DI assessed her as rationally angry, but it didn\u2019t seem that way to me. When she stepped into my personal space I felt a chill. \u201cI want to file a complaint,\u201d she informed me.\n Hera was a full head shorter than me, thin and willowy, with rich brown skin and auburn hair wound up in a knot behind her head. Tishembra had invited her over for dinner a few times and we\u2019d all gone drinking together, but as our eyes locked I felt I was looking at a stranger. \u201cWhat sort of complaint, Hera?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me.\u201d I saw no sign in her face of the heart-rending grief she\u2019d displayed at the execution. \u201cThe Commonwealth police are supposed to protect us from quirks like Key.\u201d\n \u201cKey never hurt anyone,\u201d I said softly.\n \u201cHe has now! You didn\u2019t hear the magistrate\u2019s assessment. She\u2019s fined the city for every day since Key became a citizen. We can\u2019t afford it, Choy. You know Nahiku already has debt problems\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t help you, Hera. You need to file an appeal with the magistrate\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI want to file a complaint! The city can\u2019t get fined for harboring quirks if we turn them in. So I\u2019m reporting Tishembra Indens.\u201d\n I stepped back. A cold sweat broke out across my skin as I looked away.\n Hera laughed. \u201cYou already know she\u2019s a quirk, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re a cop, Choy! A Commonwealth cop, infatuated with a quirk. \u201d\n I lost my temper. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Tishembra\u2019s your friend.\u201d\n \u201cSo was Key. And both of them immigrants.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t randomly scan people because they\u2019re immigrants.\u201d\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t scan her, I\u2019ll go to the magistrate.\u201d\n I tried to see through her anger, but the Hera I knew wasn\u2019t there. \u201cNo need to bother the magistrate,\u201d I said softly, soothingly. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n She nodded, the corner of her lip lifting a little. \u201cI look forward to hearing the result.\u201d\n I stepped into the apartment to find Tishembra\u2019s three-year-old son Robin playing on the floor, shaping bridges and wheels out of colorful gel pods. He looked up at me, a handsome boy with his mother\u2019s dark skin and her black, glossy curls, but not her reserved manner. I was treated to a mischievous grin and a firm order to, \u201cWatch this!\u201d Then he hurled himself onto his creations, smashing them all back into disks of jelly.\n Tishembra stepped out of the bedroom, lean and dark and elegant, her long hair hanging down her back in a lovely chaos of curls. She\u2019d changed from her work clothes into a silky white shift that I knew was only mindless fabric and still somehow it clung in all the right places as if a DI was controlling the fibers. She was a city engineer. Two years ago she\u2019d emigrated to Nahiku, buying citizenship for herself and Robin\u2014right before the city went into massive debt over an investment in a water-bearing asteroid that turned out to have no water. She was bitter over it, more so because the deal had been made before she arrived, but she shared in the loss anyway.\n I crossed the room. She met me halfway. I\u2019d been introduced to her on my second day at Nahiku, seven months ago now, and I\u2019d never looked back. Taking her in my arms, I held her close, letting her presence fill me up as it always did. I breathed in her frustration and her fury and for a giddy moment everything else was blotted from my mind. I was addicted to her moods, all of them. Joy and anger were just different aspects of the same enthralling, intoxicating woman\u2014and the more time I spent with her the more deeply she could touch me in that way. It wasn\u2019t love alone. Over time I\u2019d come to realize she had a subtle quirk that let her emotions seep out into the air around her. Tishembra tended to be reserved and distant. I think the quirk helped her connect with people she casually knew, letting her be perceived as more open and likeable, and easing her way as an immigrant into Nahiku\u2019s tightly knit culture\u2014but it wasn\u2019t something we could ever talk about.\n \u201cYou were part of it, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked me in an angry whisper. \u201cYou were part of what happened to Key. Why didn\u2019t you stop it?\u201d\n Tishembra had taken a terrible chance in getting close to me.\n Her fingers dug into my back. \u201cI\u2019m trapped here, Zeke. With the new fine, on top of the old debt . . . Robin and I will be working a hundred years to earn our way free.\u201d She looked up at me, her lip curled in a way that reminded me too much of Hera\u2019s parting expression. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point, my best hope is another disaster. If the city is sold off, I could at least start fresh\u2014\u201d\n \u201cTish, that doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d I spoke very softly, hoping Robin wouldn\u2019t overhear. \u201cI\u2019ve received a complaint against you.\u201d\n Her sudden fear was a radiant thing, washing over me, making me want to hold her even closer, comfort her, keep her forever safe.\n \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, of course,\u201d I murmured. \u201cTo think you\u2019re a quirk. I mean, you\u2019ve been through the gates. So you\u2019re clean.\u201d\n Thankfully, my DI never bothered to point out when I was lying.\n Tishembra nodded to let me know she understood. She wouldn\u2019t tell me anything I didn\u2019t want to know; I wouldn\u2019t ask her questions\u2014because the less I knew, the better.\n My hope rested on the fact that she could not have had the quirk when she came through the port gate into Nahiku. Maybe she\u2019d acquired it in the two years since, or maybe she\u2019d stripped it out when she\u2019d passed through the gate. I was hoping she knew how to strip it again.\n \u201cI have to do the scan,\u201d I warned her. \u201cSoon. If I don\u2019t, the magistrate will send someone who will.\u201d\n \u201cTonight?\u201d she asked in a voice devoid of expression. \u201cOr tomorrow?\u201d\n I kissed her forehead. \u201cTomorrow, love. That\u2019s soon enough.\u201d\n Robin was asleep. Tishembra lay beside him on the bed, her eyes half closed, her focus inward as she used her atrium to track the progress of processes I couldn\u2019t see. I sat in a chair and watched her. I didn\u2019t have to ask if the extraction was working. I knew it was. Her presence was draining away, becoming fainter, weaker, like a memory fading into time.\n After a while it got to be too much, waiting for the woman I knew to become someone else altogether. \u201cI\u2019m going out for a while,\u201d I said. She didn\u2019t answer. Maybe she didn\u2019t hear me. I rearmed myself with my chemical arsenal of gel ribbons. Then I put my uniform back on, and I left.\n All celestial cities have their own municipal police force. It\u2019s often a part-time, amateur operation, but the local force is supposed to investigate traditional crimes like theft, assault, murder\u2014all the heinous things people have done to each other since the beginning of time. The Commonwealth police are involved only when the crime violates statutes involving molecular science, biology, or machine intelligence.\n So strictly speaking, I didn\u2019t have any legal right or requirement to investigate the original accident that had exposed Key\u2019s quirk, but I took the elevator up to Level 1 West anyway, and used my authority to get past the DI that secured the railcar garage.\n Nahiku is a twin orbital. Its two inhabited towers are counterweights at opposite ends of a very long carbon-fiber tether that lets them spin around a center point, generating a pseudogravity in the towers. A rail runs the length of the tether, linking Nahiku East and West. The railcar Key Lu had failed to die in was parked in a small repair bay in the West-end garage. Repair work hadn\u2019t started on it yet, and the two small holes in its canopy were easy to see.\n There was no one around, maybe because it was local-night. That worked for me: I didn\u2019t have to concoct a story on why I\u2019d made this my investigation. I started collecting images, measurements, and sample swabs. When the DI picked up traces of explosive residue, I wasn\u2019t surprised.\n I was inside the car, collecting additional samples from every interior surface, when a faint shift in air pressure warned me a door had opened. Footsteps approached. I don\u2019t know who I was expecting. Hera, maybe. Or Tishembra. Not the magistrate.\n Glory Mina walked up to the car and, resting her hand on the roof, she bent down to peer at me where I sat on the ruptured upholstery.\n \u201cIs there more going on here that I need to know about?\u201d she asked.\n I sent her the DI\u2019s report. She received it in her atrium, scanned it, and followed my gaze to one of the holes in the canopy. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking someone tried to kill him.\u201d\n \u201cWhy like this?\u201d I wondered. \u201cIs it coincidence? Or did they know about his quirk?\u201d\n \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d\n \u201cIf the attacker knew about Key, then it was murder by cop.\u201d\n \u201cAnd if not, it was just an attempted murder. Either way, it\u2019s not your case. This one belongs to the city cops.\u201d\n I shook my head. I couldn\u2019t leave it alone. Maybe that\u2019s why my superiors tolerated me. \u201cI like to know what\u2019s going on in my city, and the big question I have is why? I\u2019m not buying a coincidence. Whoever blew the canopy had to know about Key\u2014so why not just kill him outright? If he\u2019d died like any normal person, I wouldn\u2019t have looked into it, you wouldn\u2019t have assessed a fine. Who gains, when everyone loses?\u201d\n Even as I said the words my thoughts turned to Tishembra, and what she\u2019d said. It\u2019s gotten to the point, my best hope is another disaster. No. I wasn\u2019t going to go there. Not with Tishembra. But maybe she wasn\u2019t the only one thinking that way?\n The magistrate watched me closely, no doubt recording every nuance of my expression. She said, \u201cI saw the complaint against your intimate.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s baseless.\u201d\n \u201cBut you\u2019ll look into it?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve scheduled a scan.\u201d\n Glory nodded. \u201cSee to that, but stay out of the local case. This one doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\n The apartment felt empty when I returned. I panicked for the few seconds it took me to sprint across the front room to the bedroom door. Tishembra was still lying on the bed, her half-closed eyes blinking sporadically, but I couldn\u2019t feel her. Not like before. A sense of abandonment came over me. I knew it was ridiculous, but I felt like she\u2019d walked away.\n Robin whimpered in his sleep, turned over, and then awoke. He looked first at Tishembra lying next to him, and then he looked at me. \u201cWhat happened to Mommy?\u201d\n \u201cMommy\u2019s okay.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s not. She\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n I went over and picked him up. \u201cHush. Don\u2019t ever say that to anyone but me, okay? We need it to be a secret.\u201d\n He pouted, but he was frightened, and he agreed.\n I spent that night in the front room, with Robin cradled in my arm. I didn\u2019t sleep much. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Key and his quirk, and who might have known about it. Maybe someone from his past? Or someone who\u2019d done a legal mod on him? I had the DI import his personal history into my atrium, but there was no record of any bioengineering work being done on him. Maybe it had just been a lucky guess by someone who knew what went on in the Far Reaches? I sent the DI to search the city files for anyone else who\u2019d ever worked out there. Only one name came back to me: Tishembra Indens.\n Tishembra and I had never talked much about where we\u2019d come from. I knew circumstances had not been kind to her, but that she\u2019d had to take a contract in the Far Reaches\u2014that shocked me.\n My best hope is another disaster.\n I deleted the query, I tried to stop thinking, but I couldn\u2019t help reflecting that she was an engineer. She had skills. She could work out how to pop the canopy and she\u2019d have access to the supplies to do it.\n Eventually I dozed, until Tishembra woke me. I stared at her. I knew her face, but I didn\u2019t know her. I couldn\u2019t feel her anymore. Her quirk was gone, and she was a stranger to me. I sat up. Robin was still asleep and I cradled his little body against my chest, dreading what would happen when he woke.\n \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Tishembra said.\n I looked away. \u201cI know.\u201d\n Robin wouldn\u2019t let his mother touch him. \u201cYou\u2019re not you!\u201d he screamed at her with all the fury a three-year-old could muster. Tishembra started to argue with him, but I shook my head, \u201cDeal with it later,\u201d and took him into the dining nook, where I got him breakfast and reminded him of our secret.\n \u201cI want Mommy,\u201d he countered with a stubborn pout.\n I considered tranking him, but the staff at the day-venture center would notice and they would ask questions, so I did my best to persuade him that Mommy was Mommy. He remained skeptical. As we left the apartment, he refused to hold Tishembra\u2019s hand but ran ahead instead, hiding behind the jungle foliage until we caught up, then running off again. I didn\u2019t blame him. In my rotten heart I didn\u2019t want to touch her either, but I wasn\u2019t three. So the next time he took off, I slipped my arm around Tishembra\u2019s waist and hauled her aside into a nook along the path. We didn\u2019t ever kiss or hold hands when I was in uniform and besides, I\u2019d surprised her when her mind was fixed on more serious things, so of course she protested. \u201cZeke, what are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cHush,\u201d I said loudly. \u201cDo you want Robin to find us?\u201d\n And I kissed her. I didn\u2019t want to. She knew it, and resisted, whispering, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel sorry for me.\u201d\n But I\u2019d gotten a taste of her mouth, and that hadn\u2019t changed. I wanted more. She felt it and softened against me, returning my kiss in a way that made me think we needed to go back to the apartment for a time.\n Then Robin was pushing against my hip. \u201cNo! Stop that kissing stuff. We have to go to day-venture.\u201d\n I scowled down at him. \u201cFine, but I\u2019m holding Tishembra\u2019s hand.\u201d\n \u201cNo. I am.\u201d And to circumvent further argument, he seized her hand and tugged her toward the path. I let her go with a smirk, but her defiant gaze put an end to that.\n \u201cI do love you,\u201d I insisted. She shrugged and went with Robin, too proud to believe in me just yet.\n Day-venture was on Level 5, where there was a prairie vista. On either side of the path we looked out across a vast land of low, grassy hills, where some sort of herd animals fed in the distance. Waist-high grass grew in a nook outside the doorway to the day-venture center. Robin stomped through it, sending a flutter of butterflies spiraling toward a blue sky. The grass sprang back without damage, betraying a biomechanical nature that the butterflies shared. One of them floated back down to land on Tishembra\u2019s hand. She started to shoo it away, but Robin shrieked, \u201cDon\u2019t flick it!\u201d and he pounced. \u201cIt\u2019s a message fly.\u201d The butterfly\u2019s blue wings spread open as it rested in his small palms. A message was written there, shaped out of white scales drained of pigment, but Robin didn\u2019t know how to read yet, so he looked to his mother for help. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d\n Tishembra gave me a dark look. Then she crouched to read the message and I saw a slight uptick in the corner of her lip. \u201cIt says Robin and Zeke love Tishembra.\u201d Then she ran her finger down the butterfly\u2019s back to erase the message, and nudged it, sending it fluttering away.\n \u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d Robin told her defiantly. \u201cI don\u2019t love Tishembra. I love Mommy.\u201d Then he threw his arms around her neck and kissed her, before running inside to play with his friends.\n Tishembra and I went on to my office, where Glory Mina was waiting for us to arrive.\n When Tishembra saw the magistrate she turned to me with a look of desperation. I told her the truth. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n A deep scan is performed with an injection of molecular-scale machines called Makers that map the body\u2019s component systems. The data is fed directly into police records and there\u2019s no way to fake the results. Tishembra should have known that, but she looked at me as if I\u2019d betrayed her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d I insisted. \u201cThe scan is just a formality, a required response in the face of the baseless complaint filed against you.\u201d\n Glory Mina watched me with a half smile. Naturally, her DI would have told her I was lying.\n I led Tishembra into a small exam room and had her sit in a large, cushioned chair. After Glory came in behind us, the office DI locked the door. I handed Tishembra a packet of Makers and she dutifully inhaled it. At the same time my DI whispered that Hera Poliu had arrived in the outer office. Sensing trouble, I looked at the magistrate. \u201cI need to talk to her.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d Tishembra asked anxiously. \u201cZeke, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n \u201cNothing\u2019s going on. Everything will be fine.\u201d\n Glory just watched me. I grunted, realizing she\u2019d come not to observe the scan but to gauge the integrity of her Nahiku watch officer, which she had good cause to doubt. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n The office DI maintained a continuous surveillance of all rooms. I channeled its feed, keeping one eye on Tishembra and another on Hera as she looked around the front office with an anxious gaze. She appeared timid and unsure\u2014nothing at all like the angry woman who had accosted me yesterday. \u201cZeke?\u201d she called softly. \u201cAre you here?\u201d\n When the door opened ahead of me, she startled.\n \u201cZeke!\u201d Hera\u2019s hands were shaking. \u201cIs it true Tishembra\u2019s been scheduled for a scan? She didn\u2019t have anything to do with Key. You have to know that. She hardly knew him. There\u2019s no reason to suspect her. Tishembra is my best engineer and if we lose her this city will never recover . . . Zeke? What is it?\u201d\n I think I was standing with my mouth open. \u201cYou filed the complaint that initiated the scan!\u201d\n \u201cMe? I . . . \u201d Her focus turned inward. \u201cOh, yesterday . . . I wasn\u2019t myself. I took the wrong mood patch. I was out of my head. Is Tishembra . . . ?\u201d\n The results of the scan arrived in my atrium. I glanced at them, and closed my eyes briefly in silent thanks. \u201cTishembra has passed her scan.\u201d\n Against all expectation I\u2019d made a home at Nahiku. I\u2019d found a woman I loved, I\u2019d made friends, and I\u2019d gained trust\u2014to the point that people would come to me for advice and guidance, knowing I wasn\u2019t just another jackboot of the Commonwealth.\n In one day all that had been shattered and I wanted to know why.\n I sent a DI hunting through the datasphere for background on Key Lu. I sent another searching through Hera Poliu\u2019s past. I thought about sending a third after Tishembra\u2014but whatever the DI turned up would go into police records and I was afraid of what it might find.\n Tish had used a patch to calm herself, resolved to go into work as if nothing was changed. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted when I said I\u2019d walk with her. She resented my coddling, but there were questions I needed to ask. We took the elevator, stepping out into a corridor enhanced with a seascape. The floor appeared as weathered boardwalk; our feet struck it in hollow thumps. Taking her arm, I gently guided her to a nook where a strong breeze blew, carrying what I\u2019m told is the salt scent of an ocean, and hiding the sound of our voices. \u201cTish, is there anything you need to tell me?\u201d\n Resentment simmered in her eyes. \u201cWhat exactly are you asking?\u201d\n \u201cYou spent time in the Far Reaches.\u201d\n \u201cSo?\u201d\n \u201cDid you know about Key Lu?\u201d\n I deserved the contempt that blossomed in her expression. \u201cThere are hundreds of tiny settlements out there, Zeke. Maybe thousands. I didn\u2019t know him. I didn\u2019t know him here, either.\u201d\n The DI returned an initial infodump. My focus wavered. Tishembra saw it. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked me.\n \u201cKey Lu was a city finance officer, one who signed off on the water deal.\u201d\n \u201cThe water deal with no water,\u201d she amended bitterly. Crossing her arms, she glared at the ocean.\n \u201cSomeone tried to kill him,\u201d I told her, letting my words blend in with the sea breeze.\n She froze, her gaze fixed on the horizon.\n \u201cThere was never a micrometeor. His railcar was sabotaged.\u201d\n I couldn\u2019t read her face and neither could the DI. Maybe it was the patch she\u2019d used to level her emotions, but her fixed expression frightened me.\n She knew what was going on in my head, though. \u201cYou\u2019re asking yourself who has the skill to do that, aren\u2019t you? Who could fake a meteor strike? If it were me, I\u2019d do it with explosive patches, one inside, one outside, to get the trajectory correct. Is that how it was done, Zeke?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Her gaze was still fixed on the horizon. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n She turned and looked me in the eye. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n The DI whispered that she spoke the truth. I smiled my relief and reached for her, but she backed away. \u201cNo, Zeke.\u201d\n \u201cTish, come on. Don\u2019t be mad. This day is making us both crazy.\u201d\n \u201cI haven\u2019t accused you of being a murderer.\u201d\n \u201cTish, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n She shook her head. \u201cI remember when we used to trust each other. I think that was yesterday.\u201d\n The second DI arrived with an initial report on Hera. Like an idiot, I scanned the file. To my surprise, I had a new suspect, but while I was distracted, Tishembra walked away.\n Glory Mina was waiting for me when I returned to my office. She\u2019d tracked my DIs and copied herself on their reports. \u201cYou should have been a municipal cop,\u201d she told me. She sat perched on the arm of a chair, her arms crossed and her eyes twinkling with amusement.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a choice.\u201d\n She cocked her head, allowing me the point. Reading from the DI\u2019s report, she said, \u201cSo Hera Poliu had a brother. Four years ago he was exiled from Nahiku, and a year after that he was arrested and executed for an illegal enhancement.\u201d\n \u201cHera lost her brother. She\u2019s got to resent it. Maybe she resents anybody who has a\u2014\u201d I caught myself. \u201cAnybody she thinks might have a quirk.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d Glory conceded. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s why she made a complaint against your intimate, but so what? It\u2019s not your case, Zeke. Forward what you\u2019ve got to whoever had the misfortune to be appointed as the criminal investigator in this little paradise and let it go.\u201d\n I made compliant noises. She shook her head, not needing the DI to know I wasn\u2019t being straight. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d\n \u201cWhere?\u201d\n \u201cThe mausoleum. I\u2019m going home. But on the way there, you\u2019re going to listen to what I have to say about the necessity for boundaries.\u201d She crooked her finger at me. I shrugged and followed. As we walked past the vistas she lectured me on the essential but very limited role of the Commonwealth police and warned me that my appointment as watch officer at Nahiku could end at any time. I listened patiently, knowing she would soon be gone.\n As we approached the mausoleum, I sent a DI to open the door. Inside was a long hallway with locked doors on either side. Behind the doors were storage chambers, most of them belonging to corporations. The third door on the left secured the police chamber. It opened as we approached, and closed again when we had stepped inside. One wall held clothing lockers. The other, ranks of cold storage drawers stacked four high. \u201cMagistrate Glory Mina,\u201d Glory said to the room DI. She stripped off her clothes and hung them in one of the lockers while the drawers slid past each other, rearranging themselves. Only two were empty. One was mine. The other descended from the top rank to the second level, where it opened, ready to receive her.\n Glory closed the locker door. She was naked and utterly unconcerned about it. She turned to me with a stern gaze. \u201cYou tried to pretend Key Lu was a victim. This once, I\u2019m going to pretend you just missed a step in the background investigation. Zeke, as much as you don\u2019t like being a cop, being an ex-cop can be a lot worse.\u201d\n I had no answer for that. I knew she was right.\n She climbed into the drawer. As soon as she lay back, the cushions inflated around her, creating a moist interface all across the surface of her skin. The drawer slid shut and locked with a soft snick. Very soon, her ghost would be on its way to Red Star. Once again, I was on my own.\n No matter what Glory wanted, there was no way I was going to set this case aside. Key Lu was dead, while Tishembra had been threatened and made into a stranger, both to me and to her own son. I wanted to know who was responsible and why.\n Still, I knew how to make concessions. So I set up an appointment with an official who served part-time as a city cop, intending to hand over the case files, if only for the benefit of my personnel record. But before that could happen a roving DI returned to me with the news that the city\u2019s auto-defense system had locked down a plague outbreak on Level 5 West. The address was Robin\u2019s day-venture center.\n It took me ninety seconds to strip off my uniform and wrap on the impermeable hide of a vacuum-capable skinsuit, police black, with gold insignia. Then I grabbed a standard-issue bivouac kit that weighed half as much as I did, and I raced out the door.\n We call it plague, but it\u2019s not. Each of us is an ecosystem. We\u2019re inhabited by a host of Makers. Some repair our bodies and our minds, keeping us young and alert, and some run our atriums. But most of our Makers exist only to defend us against hostile nanotech\u2014the snakes that forever prowl the Garden of Eden, the nightmares devised by twisted minds\u2014and sometimes our defenses fail.\n A general alert had not been issued\u2014that was standard policy to avoid panic\u2014but as soon as I was spotted on the paths wearing my skinsuit, word went out through informal channels that something was wrong. By the time I reached the day-venture center people had already guessed where I was going and a crowd was beginning to form against the backdrop of prairie. The city\u2019s emergency response team hadn\u2019t arrived yet, so questions were shouted at me. I refused to answer. \u201cStay back!\u201d I commanded, issuing an order for the center\u2019s locked door to open.\n In an auto-defense lockdown, a gel barrier is extruded around the suspect zone. The door slid back to reveal a wall of blue-tinged gel behind it. I pulled up the hood of my skinsuit and let it seal. Then I leaned into the gel wall, feeling it give way slowly around me, and after a few seconds I was able to pass through. As soon as I was clear, the door closed and locked behind me.\n The staff and children were huddled on one side of the room\u2014six adults and twenty-two kids. They looked frightened, but otherwise okay. Robin wasn\u2019t with them. The director started to speak but I couldn\u2019t hear him past the skinsuit, so I forced an atrial link to every adult in the room, \u201cGive me your status.\u201d\n The director spoke again, this time through my atrium. \u201cIt\u2019s Robin. He was hit hard only a couple of minutes ago. Shakes and sweats. His system\u2019s chewing up all his latents and he went down right away. I think it\u2019s targeted. No one else has shown any signs.\u201d\n \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n The director looked toward the nap room.\n I didn\u2019t want to think too hard, I just wanted to get Robin stable, but the director\u2019s assessment haunted me. A targeted assault meant that Robin alone was the intended victim; that the hostile Maker had been designed to activate in his unique ecosystem.\n I found him on the floor, trembling in the grip of a hypoglycemic seizure, all his blood sugars gone to fuel the reproduction of Makers in his body\u2014both defensive and assault\u2014as the tiny machines ramped up their populations to do battle on a molecular scale. His eyelids fluttered, but I could only see the whites. His black curls were sodden with sweat.\n I unrolled the bivouac kit with its thick gel base designed for a much larger patient. Then I lifted his small body, laid him on it, and touched the activation points. The gel folded around him like a cocoon. The bivouac was a portable version of the cold storage drawer that had enfolded Glory. Robin\u2019s core temperature plummeted, while an army of defensive Makers swarmed past the barrier of his skin in a frantic effort to stabilize him.\n The city\u2019s emergency team came in wearing sealed skinsuits. I stood by as they scanned the other kids, the staff, the rooms, and me, finding nothing. Only Robin was affected.\n I stripped off my hood. Out in the playroom, the gel membrane was coming down and the kids were going home, but inside the bivouac Robin lay in stasis, his biological processes all but stopped. Even the data on his condition had been pared to a trickle. Still, I\u2019d seen enough to know what was happening: the assault Makers were attacking Robin\u2019s neuronal connections, writing chaos into the space where Robin used to be. We would lose him if we allowed him to revive.\n I checked city records for the date of his last backup. I couldn\u2019t find one. Robin had turned three a few weeks ago. I remembered we\u2019d talked about taking him in to get a backup done . . . but we\u2019d been busy.\n The emergency team came back into the nap room with a gurney. Tishembra came with them. One glance at her face told me she\u2019d been heavily tranked.\n At first she didn\u2019t say anything, just watched with lips slightly parted and an expression of quiet horror on her face as the bivouac was lifted onto the gurney. But as the gurney was rolled away she asked in a defeated voice, \u201cIs he going to die?\u201d\n \u201cOf course he\u2019s not going to die.\u201d\n She turned an accusing gaze on me. \u201cMy DI says you\u2019re lying.\u201d\n I cursed myself silently and tried again, determined to speak the truth this time. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to die, because I won\u2019t let him.\u201d\n She nodded, as if I\u2019d got it right. The trank had turned her mood to smooth, hard glass. \u201cI made this happen.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n She turned her right hand palm up. A blue prairie butterfly rested in it, crushed and lifeless. I picked it up; spread its wings open. The message was only a little blurred from handling. On the left wing I read, You lived, and on the right, so he dies.\n So someone had watched as we\u2019d dropped Robin off that morning. I looked up at Tishembra. \u201cNo,\u201d I told her. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n The attack on Robin was a molecular crime, which made it my case, and I was prepared to use every resource of the police to solve it.\n Tishembra nodded. Then she left, following the gurney.\n I could work anywhere, using my atrium, so I stayed for a time. First I packed up every bit of data I had on Robin\u2019s condition and sent it to six different police labs, hoping at least one could come up with the design for a Maker that could stop the assault on Robin\u2019s brain cells. The odds of success would go up dramatically if I could get the specs of the assault Maker\u2014and the easiest way to do that was to track down the twisted freak who\u2019d designed it.\n Easy steps first: I sent a DI into the datasphere to assemble a list of everyone at Nahiku with extensive molecular design experience. The DI came back with one name: mine.\n So I was dealing with a talented hobbyist.\n It could be anyone.\n I sent the DI out again. No record was kept of butterfly messages\u2014they were designed to be anonymous\u2014but surveillance records were collected on every public path. I instructed the DI to access the records and assemble a list of everyone who\u2019d set foot on Level 5 at any time that day, because the blue prairie butterflies could only be accessed from there. The list that came back was long. Name after name scrolled through my visual field, many that I recognized, but only one stood out in my mind: Hera Poliu.\n I summoned the vid attached to her name. It was innocuous. She\u2019d been taking the stairs between levels and had paused briefly on the landing. Still, it bothered me. Hera had been involved with Key Lu, she\u2019d filed the complaint against Tishembra, and now I had her on Level 5. Coincidence maybe . . . but I remembered the chill I\u2019d felt when she accosted me in the corridor . . . and how confused she\u2019d been when I reminded her of the incident.\n I went by my office and changed back into my uniform. Then I checked city records for Hera\u2019s location. She was at the infirmary, sitting with Tishembra . . . Tishembra, who\u2019d been a quirk just like Hera\u2019s brother except she\u2019d eluded punishment while Hera\u2019s brother was dead. Maybe it was baseless panic, but I sprinted for the door.\n The infirmary had a reception room with a desk, and a hallway behind it with small rooms on either side. The technician at the desk looked up as I burst in. \u201cRobin Indens!\u201d I barked.\n \u201cCritical care. End of the hall.\u201d\n I sprinted past him. A sign identified the room. I touched the door and it snapped open. The bivouac had been set up on a table in the center of the room. Slender feeder lines descending from the ceiling were plugged into its ports. Tishembra and Hera stood alongside the bivouac, Hera with a comforting arm around Tishembra\u2019s shoulders. They both looked up as I burst in. \u201cZeke?\u201d Tishembra asked, with an expression encompassing both hope and dread.\n \u201cTish, it\u2019s going to be okay. But I need to talk to Hera. Alone.\u201d\n They traded a puzzled glance. Then Hera gave Tishembra a quick hug\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll be right back\u201d\u2014and stepped past me into the hall. I followed her, closing the door behind us.\n Hera turned to face me. She looked gaunt and worn\u2014a woman who had seen too much grief. \u201cI want to thank you, Zeke, for not telling Tishembra who filed that complaint. I wasn\u2019t myself when I did it. I don\u2019t even remember doing it.\u201d\n She wasn\u2019t lying.\n I stumbled over that fact. Had I gotten it wrong? Was there something more going on than a need for misguided revenge?\n \u201cWhen was the last time you had your defensive Makers upgraded?\u201d\n She flinched and looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\n I sent a DI to check the records. It had been three years. I pulled up an earlier report and cross-checked the dates to be sure. She hadn\u2019t had an upgrade since her brother\u2019s execution. My heart rate jumped as I contemplated a new possibility. No doubt my pupils dilated, but Hera was still looking away and she didn\u2019t see it. I sent the DI out again.\n We were standing beside an open door to an unoccupied office. I ushered Hera inside. The DI came back with a new set of records even before the door was closed. At my invitation, Hera sat in the guest chair, her hands fidgeting restlessly in her lap. I perched on the edge of the desk, scanning the records, trying to stay calm, but my DI wasn\u2019t fooled. It sensed my stress and sent the paralytic ribbon creeping down my arm and into my palm.\n \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your brother.\u201d\n Hera\u2019s hands froze in her lap. \u201cMy brother? You must know already. He\u2019s dead . . . he died like Key.\u201d\n \u201cYou used to be a city councilor.\u201d\n \u201cI resigned from the council.\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cAs a councilor you were required to host visitors . . . but you haven\u2019t allowed a ghost in your atrium since your brother\u2019s arrest.\u201d\n \u201cThose things don\u2019t matter to me anymore.\u201d\n \u201cYou also haven\u2019t upgraded your defensive Makers, and you haven\u2019t been scanned\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not a criminal, Zeke. I just . . . I just want to do my job, and be left alone.\u201d\n \u201cHera? You\u2019ve been harboring your brother\u2019s ghost, haven\u2019t you? And he didn\u2019t like it, when you started seeing Key.\u201d\n The DI showed me the flush of hot and cold across her skin. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo. He\u2019s dead, and I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n She was lying. \u201cHera, is your atrium quirked? To let your brother\u2019s ghost take over sometimes?\u201d\n She looked away. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be illegal?\u201d\n \u201cGiving up your body to another? Yes, it would be.\u201d\n Her hands squeezed hard against the armrests of the chair. \u201cIt was him, then? That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?\u201d She turned to look at me, despair in her eyes. \u201cHe filed the complaint against Tish?\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t you speaking to me that day. I think he also used you to sabotage Key\u2019s railcar, knowing I\u2019d have to look into it.\u201d\n \u201cAnd Robin?\u201d she asked, her knuckles whitening as she gripped the chair.\n \u201cAsk him.\u201d\n Earlier, I\u2019d asked the DI to bring me a list of all the trained molecular designers in Nahiku, but I\u2019d asked the wrong question. I queried it again, asking for all the designers in the past five years. This time, mine wasn\u2019t the only name.\n \u201cAsk him for the design of the assault Maker, Hera. Robin doesn\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d\n I crouched in front of her, my hand on hers as I looked up into her stunned eyes. It was a damned stupid position to put myself into.\n He took over. It took a fraction of a second. My DI didn\u2019t catch it, but I saw it happen. Her expression hardened and her knee came up, driving hard into my chin. As my head snapped back he launched Hera against me. At that point it didn\u2019t matter that I outweighed her by forty percent. I was off balance and I went down with her on top of me. Her forehead cracked against my nose, breaking it.\n He wasn\u2019t trying to escape. There was no way he could. It was only blind rage that drove him. He wanted to kill me, for all the good it would do. I was a cop. I had backups. I couldn\u2019t lose more than a few days. But he could still do some damage before he was brought down.\n I felt Hera\u2019s small hands seize my wrists. He was trying to keep me from using the ribbon arsenal, but Hera wasn\u2019t nearly strong enough for that. I tossed her off, and not gently. The back of her head hit the floor, but she got up again almost as fast as I did and scrambled for the door.\n I don\u2019t know what he intended to do, what final vengeance he hoped for. One more murder, maybe. Tishembra and Robin were both just across the hall.\n I grabbed Hera, dragged her back, and slammed her into the chair. Then I raised my hand. The DI controlled the ribbon. Fibers along its length squeezed hard, sending a fine mist across Hera\u2019s face. It got in her eyes and in her lungs. She reared back, but then she collapsed, slumping in the chair. I wiped my bloody nose on my sleeve and waited until her head lolled against her chest. Then I sent a DI to Red Star.\n I\u2019d need help extracting the data from her quirked atrium, and combing through it for the assault Maker\u2019s design file.\n It took a few days, but Robin was recovered. When he gets cranky at night he still tells Tishembra she\u2019s \u201cwrong,\u201d but he\u2019s only three. Soon he won\u2019t remember what she was like before, while I pretend it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\n Tishembra knows that isn\u2019t true. She complains the laws are too strict, that citizens should be free to make their own choices. Me, I\u2019m just happy Glory Mina let me stay on as Nahiku\u2019s watch officer. Glory likes reminding me how lucky I am to have the position. I like to remind her that I\u2019ve finally turned into the uncompromising jackboot she always knew I could be.\n Don\u2019t get me wrong. I wanted to help Hera, but she\u2019d been harboring a fugitive for three years. There was nothing I could do for her, but I won\u2019t let anyone else in this city step over the line. I don\u2019t want to sit through another execution.\n Nahiku isn\u2019t quite bankrupt yet. Glory assessed a minimal fine for Hera\u2019s transgression, laying most of the fault on the police since we\u2019d failed to hunt down all ghosts of a condemned criminal. So the city won\u2019t be sold off, and Tishembra will have to wait to get free.\n I don\u2019t think she minds too much.\n Here. Now. This is enough. I only wonder: Can we make it last?\n Copyright \u00a9 2012 by Linda Nagata. Originally published in Analog Science Fiction, October 2012.\n Linda Nagata is a Nebula and Locus-award-winning author.

The first two, Realms 1 and Realms 2, were published on-schedule, but things crashed to a halt at volume three. Part of the problem was financial and the rest was me.\nAfter my heart attack nearly two years ago, I refocused my efforts in making Clarkesworld a full-time career and mapped out how to get there. One of the items on that list was to catch up on our languishing print anthologies and issues, so I dedicated some of my sitting-on-the-couch recovery time to learning InDesign and book design.\nBy February of the next year, I had managed to publish several back issues in print and the first of many long-overdue anthologies, Clarkesworld: Year Three. By the end of the year, I was regularly producing print editions of each new issue, had completed working backwards to issue fifty, and published two more anthologies: Clarkesworld: Year Four and Clarkesworld: Year Five.\nFor the first part of this year, I\u2019ve placed an emphasis on getting completely caught up with the anthologies. After that, I\u2019ll go back and tackle issues one through forty-nine. Moving ever closer to that goal, I published our largest volume, Clarkesworld: Year Six, in late May. Like earlier volumes, Year Six features cover art from a prior issue of the magazine. This time it\u2019s \u201cSpace Journey\u201d by Martin Faragasso, which originally appeared on issue seventy-one. The stories are from issues sixty-one through seventy-two, which coincidentally is the year of my heart attack. It\u2019s somewhat sobering to realize that everything from that point forward has been done on time I almost didn\u2019t get. Anyhow, I\u2019m quite proud of this volume.\nContents:\n- \u201cIntroduction\u201d by Neil Clarke\n- \u201cScattered Along the River of Heaven\u201d by Aliette de Bodard\n- \u201cAll the Painted Stars\u201d by Gwendolyn Clare\n- \u201cPrayer\u201d by Robert Reed\n- \u201cA Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\u201d by Xia Jia\n- \u201cAnd the Hollow Space Inside\u201d by Mari Ness\n- \u201cWhat Everyone Remembers\u201d by Rahul Kanakia\n- \u201cThe Bells of Subsidence\u201d by Michael John Grist\n- \u201cThe Switch\u201d by Sarah Stanton\n- \u201cSunlight Society\u201d by Margaret Ronald\n- \u201cA Militant Peace\u201d by David Klecha and Tobias S.

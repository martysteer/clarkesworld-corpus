The client, a woman of about forty\u2014or maybe fifty? it was hard to tell\u2014sat on a flat cushion placed at the lip of the raised floor of the atelier\u2019s reception, crossing and uncrossing her legs in a sluggish manner. \u201cI really cannot believe there\u2019s any place in this city that has no chair,\u201d the woman said, for the fourth or fifth time. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a beautiful bag you have,\u201d Kiriko had stopped apologizing for the lack of chairs after the second time. She herself was standing on the earthen floor that ran, right beside the wall-less reception room, across the entire length of the building. \u201cThat must be the work of a very good craftsperson. I haven\u2019t seen some of the methods adopted there, though.\u201d It was too small for Kiriko\u2019s liking, of course, who wanted bags to be just as huge as they could be. But this client must have only carried a mirror, and maybe a cigarette box and a book of matches, at most. Rectangle shaped, its lid flipped over the entire length and width of the bag, and the inside was apparently lined with silk, which was embroidered with natural-color silk thread in a minute pattern; the whole lining seemed to ripple with shimmers to a casual eye. Every other surface was covered with more colored embroidery and lace, with beads threaded here and there, surrounding cabochons of enamel\u2014which looked a lot like the client\u2019s own skin.\nThe client woman almost snorted. \u201cMade abroad, of course. A gift from a foreigner. This subtle yet wild demonstration of pattern and color is nothing the craftspersons of this country can even dream of.\u201d\nAll right, then, go abroad and get the fix you want overseas. Kiriko downed the words with lukewarm tea, and cocked her head just a little, to hear the noise from outside better. Did she just hear him say hi to the neighbors? Yes\u2014the sliding door burst open with a loud clang, the glass tiles on its upper half rattled badly in their grids. \u201cNo rice straw, can you believe? They burned them all!\u201d Kiriko\u2019s mentor, the owner of this atelier, threw an empty cloth bag towards the reception floor. \u201cI made them promise me their next batch\u2014oh, hello, good day.\u201d\nThe bag he\u2019d thrown had bounced off the client\u2019s shoulder and landed on her own bag. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d She flicked the coarse bag off her smaller, elaborate one, as if the coarse thing could somehow contaminate her spotless possession. \u201cI . . . \u201d She glared at the young man who\u2019d just assaulted her. \u201cI heard this is the best place in the city, for crafts related to human skin! How can a boy like you be the best? Are you even good?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cThey say I am. I myself never said I am. What service do you seek here?\u201d\nFor a moment the woman sat there glaring at him, and Kiriko thought she\u2019d walk out right through the door. But then she shook her head and said, \u201cI have heard. About those . . . surgeries.\u201d\nHer mentor eyed at Kiriko, who too was feeling the wrong turn coming. \u201cSurgeries,\u201d he echoed.\n\u201cI see a lot of foreigners, you see. Part of my job.\u201d She\u2019d introduced herself as the proprietor of one of the teahouses in the High District\u2014the area which expanded just off the seafront to serve, entertain and accommodate tourists from abroad. This particular woman\u2019s place wasn\u2019t actually on the High Street, the spine of the High District and the center of this country\u2019s tourism, but in the western patch of the District, where things were slightly cheaper. She did seem to earn enough for her fancy one-piece dress, her soft- and warm-looking scarf, her high-heeled yet miraculously comfortable-looking shoes . . . or were they all gifts from her patrons?\n\u201cThey tell me and my girls and boys how rare, how beautiful we are, but very often, that talk slips towards the\u201d\u2014she looked around and lowered her voice\u2014\u201c\u2018cosmetics\u2019 they have overseas, as they get more and more drunk. Our government discourages them to talk about things like those colors they use to hide circles under the eye, or acne spots. Or, even, just to change the color of your eyelid!\u201d She sat back and crossed her legs. \u201cYou know, tourists do like talking about those things, they love it when we go, \u2018oh, how sensational!\u2019 even though we are hearing it for the hundredth time.\u201d\nKiriko\u2019s mentor retrieved the disrespected cloth bag and fidgeted with it. Of course, they had heard stories about those obscene, crazy stuff. Kiriko had recently met in a lavatory of a souvenir shop a woman who was drawing eyebrows with a soft pencil. That woman had let Kiriko have a used, very short pencil of the same kind. She and her mentor had spent days taking that thing apart. \u201cAnd . . . surgeries?\u201d he said, reluctantly.\n\u201cThere are many, many, they say! Ways to alter your appearance!\u201d the woman exclaimed, as if merely mentioning it was off-limits. \u201cBut the thing I\u2019m interested in\u2014I heard they have something to inject into human skin, so the skin stays nice and smooth, even as you age? Or the thing where you transplant healthy skin onto a different part? I need something like that.\u201d\nThe two young craftspersons looked at each other, then back at the client. \u201cBut your skin is impeccable, Madam.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s skin was mostly the color of ripe plum, with the soft sheen of enamel thinly applied all over her surface. Here and there\u2014like inside her eyelids or the skin beneath her nails\u2014the mellow yellow of the fruit could be seen. People said her skin used to be fresh green when she was the age of Kiriko now, twenty years or more ago. Her entire skin had ripened, they\u2019d say, the way a young, hard, and sour meat turned to the sweet, juicy thing.\n\u201cImpeccable. That\u2019s the way it should be, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the thing about age. Look.\u201d\nThe woman tucked her hard-bark brown hair away from her neck, and there, the two could see: a crack. Underneath it the color was one of fruit gone foul.\n\u201cI have several more like this, in parts where I cannot show you now. And these lines are spreading, I can see. I need a way to stop it.\u201d\nKiriko was doing everything she could to not touch the cracked skin. \u201cThis looks pretty, too, though. When you\u2019re full of it, it\u2019ll be a totally new pattern!\u201d\nThe woman released her hair from her grip and looked at Kiriko side-eye. \u201cYou\u2019d never understand.\u201d\nOf course she wouldn\u2019t. Kiriko\u2019s\u2014and her mentor\u2019s, for that matter\u2014skin, hair, teeth, and bones were all just like foreigners\u2019: plain. That was why she worked as a craftsperson in the first place. Those without a color or pattern on their skin had no place in the tourism industry of this country, where people like this client earned foreign currency for the island by showing off themselves to the sightseers. Kiriko had long been used to this kind of casual insult. But her mentor said, \u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t. We wouldn\u2019t. Which maybe means we wouldn\u2019t feel like helping you, Madam. Thanks for your visit, sorry for the trouble.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s plum deepened, to a color closer to the one inside her crack. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose my teahouse if I let my color spoil!\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re losing a business opportunity here just for what we are, sorry we could not come to an agreement.\u201d\nA few seconds passed in an uncomfortable silence. Kiriko\u2019s mentor stood there tall, his shoulders square. But Kiriko didn\u2019t need his protection, really. She, or they, needed money. \u201cSensei\u2014\u201d\nBut then the enamel woman inhaled and exhaled. She was the oldest person here right now; she took back control of her emotions sooner than the atelier\u2019s young owner. \u201cFine. Well. Those small pieces of paper stacked right there, by the way?\u201d She was pointing at the finished products stored temporarily in a corner of the reception. \u201cThose are remedy transfer-print sheets, aren\u2019t they? One of my neighbors uses it for his allergy. I saw him put one to his lower eyelid, transfer the pattern on the sheet to the membrane. He said it eases the itches and soreness he gets as allergic reactions.\u201d\nThis is going to be bad, Kiriko thought. She could feel her mentor having the same thought, too.\n\u201cYou make things to transfer patterns onto human skin. How obscene, eh?\u201d\nThe young man breathed in, and out. \u201cTemporary. And just for a medical effect.\u201d\n\u201cBut what if more people hear about it? Those folks like you born without colors and patterns on your skin, you can fake what you want on you, in theory. The one for my neighbor, it soon went away with enough of his tears, sure. But if you used a different kind of ink? If you applied it to some drier surface? Oh, so very appalled, I am, to imagine such a thing done to one of my girls and boys!\u201d She placed her hands over her chest and shook herself. Kiriko almost laughed.\n\u201cMadam, are you trying to blackmail us?\u201d he said, and Kiriko could hear his temper sliding off to something different than anger.\n\u201cNo, young man, I am not. I am just trying to strike a deal.\u201d\nKiriko\u2019s mentor sat at the low table of their reception, drumming his finger on its surface, looking grim.\nThe apprentice placed a tray with a teapot and cups on the floor near him and sat down herself. \u201cShe did offer a nice sum of money, at the very least. You can buy me a bottle of fancy ink if that makes you feel any better.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think that would make me feel any better? What do you know about these surgeries?\u201d\nNot much, really. Changing your complexion was illegal in this country. Even if the color to be applied came from the same person\u2019s skin. That would probably impose the patient a large sum of fine, and . . . the people who performed this surgery, putting a knife into an allegedly perfect skin? The government would never let them work as craftspersons again. Kiriko shrugged like a foreigner, making him smile a little. \u201cYou?\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cEven if we, like, actually get to watch those surgeries, or read about their procedure details, I\u2019m sure they are for the clinic, not for us, common folk-remedy place. I know she came here because she cannot possibly ask the government-run clinic, but here we don\u2019t have adequate equipment for that. Not even injection needles!\u201d\nOf course\u2014neither of them had any kind of certificate or license or whatever, to do anything, that would involve actually slicing into human skin. This place was called an atelier because they put out patterned artifacts like cloths for apparel or furnishings, carved wood boards for furniture and home interior, et cetera, et cetera. But that was only one part of what these two craftspersons did. They tended to small discomfort of human body, like minor yet persistent headache, inefficient digestive system, regular cases of dizziness and so on, with their only weapon\u2014the patterns they drew.\nTo them, currents of fluid within human body, the way muscles flowed, and the air glided over them, were just another kind of pattern. The two craftspersons called these \u201csilent\u201d patterns, as opposed to plainly visible, real lines and colors; everything, including human body parts, had a pattern to it, the curls of air and swirls of energy around it, marking its place in the world. Their treatment was conducted a lot of the time by finding another silent pattern that could affect the existing one and applying it over the affected area, to adjust the currents that had gone just a little bit amiss, correcting blood flow to make the body work more efficiently, or let the patient move their muscle more freely. Some patterns worked generally, while others had to be customized to the patient and their condition.\nBut they couldn\u2019t treat diseases that were too severe, or perform any kind of surgical operation. And here, in this country where altering your complexions was a crime, of course they couldn\u2019t speak openly of what they did behind their doors with screens shut, as they often had to draw patterns directly on human skin, which was regarded highly inappropriate.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we just make a pigment portion and fill the cracks with it? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she expects, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI think she wants permanent, and we cannot just fill a human skin with foreign matter, even if she\u2019s an enamel.\u201d He grinned. \u201cEven if she loves foreign stuff.\u201d\nHis apprentice ignored this. \u201cIf we make\u2014even if we can\u2014something that changes the color there forever, once we do that the city will no longer overlook what we do.\u201d\n\u201cBut how long, exactly, is forever?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nHe took his cup up off the tray. \u201cWith the remedy transfer sheet for allergy, the pattern stays there only for a few minutes. We have those sheets with ink that remains on the skin for a few hours, for cases where slowness and steadiness are more important. Stretch that procedure time little by little, and then . . . \u201d\n\u201cSensei,\u201d Kiriko pointed her finger at her mentor, \u201cthat is a quibble, and a feeble one at that.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, a few days cannot possibly be that huge a trouble. Even though that\u2019s far longer than any we\u2019ve made here.\u201d\nKiriko considered this. \u201cA few days . . . \u201d she whispered. \u201cDays . . . \u201d\n\u201cRight. Days.\u201d\nShe blinked. \u201cSo she\u2019ll have to reapply the pigment every few days. The cracks are small but slowly spreading? Usual transfer method won\u2019t be much convenient here. And she must be very good with brushes to do it in a way people cannot tell there\u2019s been some tampering . . . \u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t like that word.\u201d\n\u201cWait. Wait, but if the pigment is manipulated in a way it will attach itself to certain places . . . \u201d\nHer mentor sighed. \u201cFinally. How long did it take for you to get there?\u201d\nShe glared at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll still have to find a way to confect this pigment\u2014what substance can be used, to closely stick to human skin, remain there a few days, and that would do no harm to the bearer.\u201d\n\u201cStep by step, my dear apprentice,\u201d he said, touching his lips to the cup of hot tea. \u201cOne problem at a time.\u201d\nAt least the client probably wasn\u2019t as heartless as she\u2019d seemed. She placed some ordinary orders too, a patterned cloth for a sofa cover and garlands to be installed around the ceiling light, among other smaller things. Kiriko went to deliver the crafts, and also to take a sample of the proprietor\u2019s skin. While repeat tourists who were more or less familiar with the country dominated this area, a lot of islanders\u2014though only colorful ones\u2014loitered and enjoyed themselves, too. Not the cleanest or safest part of the city, but many of the places around here had a distinct taste for fancy stuff and paid the atelier well.\nKiriko entered, careful not to draw the guests\u2019 attention, into the dimly-lit hall of Madam Enamel\u2019s teahouse. \u201cDelivery for Madam,\u201d she whispered to one of the waiters standing near the door.\n\u201cBeen expecting you, Craftsperson. This way.\u201d\nThe higher parts of the windows in the hall were filled with a cheap kind of stained glass\u2014not the real, super-luxurious stuff seen around the most expensive area of this country. There was only one proper chandelier, and other lights that hung from the ceiling were simple gas-mantle lamps, some with old garlands swinging around them. Still, Kiriko could see the labor and money the proprietor put into this place. After a short walk along a narrow corridor on the other side of a small door, the waiter opened another of the same size for Kiriko, behind which the woman sat at a desk with reading glasses over her nose. \u201cHello Craftsgirl,\u201d the woman said, slightly squinting. \u201cCome here and let me see those best pretties of the city.\u201d\nTogether they spread the delivered goods. The woman did seem to care a lot about these things unlike other clients around this area, who\u2019d just order a thing, get it delivered, and then forget all about it once it got installed in their shop; she turned the goods around, checking every surface, trying the feels of every pattern to the touch.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I really like these things. How different are they, from the stuff other places put out? Maybe you really are the best.\u201d\nKiriko and her mentor did choose those patterns which would soothe people\u2019s mind, by relaxing muscles around the eye and lifting some tension off a certain area of the brain. \u201cThank you,\u201d Kiriko only said.\n\u201cSo?\u201d The woman sat back in her chair. \u201cHave you figured out anything . . . for me?\u201d\nJust then the waiter came back with cups of tea and a plate of confectionary. Kiriko squeaked silently at the beauty of the ridiculously small yet elaborately shaped sweet pieces, and the woman watched her eat for a while.\n\u201cYou really aren\u2019t that different from my girls.\u201d To Kiriko\u2019s surprise, the woman was smiling.\nKiriko swallowed a bite, which was almost a whole of one very fragrant cake. \u201cI am so very different from them, I am totally colorless.\u201d\n\u201cThat is quite extraordinary in itself, indeed, you know?\u201d\n\u201cNot for the tourists.\u201d Kiriko listened to check if no one was within the earshot, and then said: \u201cI need samples. Of the inside of your crack.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cIt may hurt roughly to the same extent as when you snap a rubber band against your skin. If that\u2019s too much . . . \u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. Anything is fine, actually, as long as there\u2019s something you can do.\u201d\nKiriko scraped bits of skin and membrane off the woman, closed the caps tight on the sample vials. The sample wasn\u2019t just for color reference. Sometimes silent patterns could be seen easily only if she strained her consciousness enough to channel through. Other times, though, they could be hard for naked craftsperson eyes to see. These could be examined with good microscopes customized by the atelier over the years, which helped taking elements apart through the lenses.\nWhen she was done, Kiriko slurped up the last of her tea. \u201cWe\u2019ll still need some time,\u201d she said, as she stood up. \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you as soon as we can.\u201d\nThe woman nodded. \u201cTake those sweets. Does your mentor eat those, too? Or prefer something that goes better with alcohol?\u201d\n\u201cHe likes sweets, thank you!\u201d\nThe woman saw Kiriko off to the exit. Along the way, the proprietor exchanged a few words with each of the girls and boys she encountered, and the interaction seemed kind, or even affectionate, perhaps. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need an escort out of this part of town?\u201d she said when they were at the door.\nKiriko nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not so late, and I do know safer paths.\u201d\n\u201cTake care, then. Good night.\u201d\n\u201cGood night, Madam.\u201d\n\u201cI like her,\u201d Kiriko said as soon as she was inside the atelier.\nHer mentor frowned, said nothing.\n\u201cLook, she gave us some sweet things.\u201d\n\u201cOh okay, maybe she\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I mean, she\u2019s a bitch, all right, but she does seem to care for her place and her employees. I think she needs to remain enamel that badly because she needs to keep her place nice and popular, for her employees rather than for herself.\u201d\nHe opened the wrapping cloth and picked up one of the tiny cakes. \u201cYou do realize that you tend to attach yourself to any kind of client, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe almost pouted and stopped herself. \u201cShe likes our crafts!\u201d\nHe popped the cake into his large mouth and chewed, and looked very happy.\n\u201cSee? Nice. And anyway, every client has their own reason. We\u2019re here to help them.\u201d\nHe swallowed loudly and sighed contentedly. \u201cShould have prepared some bitter tea first. Let\u2019s get working on the samples now.\u201d\nKiriko never hung around in the High District without very good reasons. She always felt nervous around the foreigners; she\u2019d had no education on the official language, as the government deemed it a waste of resources for the colorless folks who had no direct business with the tourists; and most of the time, she didn\u2019t get their gestures. Shrugging was one of the first few she\u2019d understood after she first moved to the city from her village in the mountains, and sometimes she even used it, because there was no gesture native to this country that could convey what it did. Then, not all the foreigners shrugged, them coming from many different parts of the continent. She just didn\u2019t like the feeling of being at a loss.\nShe walked through one of the narrower avenues on the eastern side of the High District, where many inns stood between the High Street and the waterfront. Accommodation was cheaper here than the hotels along the coastline. There were a few cafes and teahouses, not the fancy kind like in the west but those which simply served just-okay coffee. On the terrace of one of these places, a foreign woman was seated, looking down at her coffee beside which the milk and sugar sat untouched.\nIt was a bit chilly this morning, and the woman was the only patron on the terrace. Just as Kiriko had hoped. \u201cNova-san,\u201d she said, tasting the unfamiliar pronunciation of the woman\u2019s name at the edge of her lips. \u201cGood day.\u201d\nThe woman looked up from her cup. \u201cHello Craftsperson Kiriko-san!\u201d She beamed, engaging in the local language of this island for Kiriko\u2019s sake. \u201cHow nice to see you! Come have a seat!\u201d\nNova ordered black tea for Kiriko. (This place didn\u2019t have green tea, and black was slightly better than coffee for the craftsperson.) Her hair was black, just like Kiriko\u2019s, but it glowed as if there was a layer of faint light over it; Kiriko had heard foreigners took very good care of their own conditions, not quite the way the islanders did. And she was almost as deeply-tanned as Kiriko\u2019s mentor, while Kiriko herself was pale and her skin hated the sun. Something glimmered on the woman\u2019s eyelids, and her peridot earrings went very well with her skin and also with those golden shimmers around her eyes. But it wasn\u2019t these carefully aligned looks that attracted Kiriko; Nova was the first foreigner who talked to Kiriko in the local language from the start, instead of the official language.\nAnd of course, there was that eyebrow-pencil thing. \u201cI want to thank you again,\u201d Kiriko said, wanting to shift to more formal speech but afraid the foreigner might not understand her then. \u201cIt was such fun to take that pencil apart.\u201d\n\u201cGood to hear! You didn\u2019t get into trouble? We are told not to talk too much about cosmetics, before we depart the continent.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. We are careful. And . . . we hate to take advantage of your kindness, but . . . hope you don\u2019t mind telling me more about how you paint your face? What you use, and how you decide the appropriate amount and such.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to know more about what we do? How diligent!\u201d\n\u201cMay I see that thing on your eyelid? Is that a pencil, too?\u201d\nNova winked. \u201cThis? No, this comes from a palette.\u201d\n\u201cPalette!\u201d Kiriko almost squeaked.\n\u201cYes, a tiny palette. I can show you, but is it okay to do that here? Isn\u2019t that regarded obscene?\u201d\nKiriko\u2019s shoulders slumped down. \u201cYes. That would attract a lot of unwanted attention.\u201d\n\u201cStrange people, you all. But so are we, in your eyes.\u201d The foreign woman laughed just a little. \u201cAny place? I don\u2019t think I can afford a space at that luxurious hotel down the coastline.\u201d\nKiriko considered this. \u201cOh. Maybe I know a place.\u201d She considered it again. \u201cMaybe?\u201d\nLike many of the teahouses in the west, Madam Enamel\u2019s place offered a quiet space at the back for those who needed privacy. Kiriko didn\u2019t know the reservation cost, but as she had hoped, Madam Enamel said she wouldn\u2019t charge for this particular case.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see how a foreigner can help with this,\u201d the woman said. But Kiriko could hear excitement in her voice.\n\u201cThank you for your cooperation, Madam. Nova-san, after you, if you please.\u201d\nThe foreign woman said quick thanks to the proprietor in the local language, and Kiriko saw the enamel woman blush, her ripe plum cheeks turning to a warmer color. One of the waiting boys escorted Kiriko and Nova, an adolescent with peacock smudges on his face, one of his eyes amber. \u201cGreen tea is free of charge, Craftsperson,\u201d he said to Kiriko. \u201cWhat can we offer your honorable company here? We do serve alcohol, too.\u201d\nNova looked at the menu and ordered a few things, including small cakes for herself and Kiriko, too. \u201cCan you even read our language?\u201d Kiriko asked.\n\u201cSome. Not everything. Your colors are beautiful, you look like you come from a myth,\u201d Nova said, the latter sentence to the waiter.\nHis ears turned pink. \u201cThank you. Oh, it feels so much better when a guest compliments in our own language, if I may say so.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it, now? Then please send my regards to your proprietor. Her skin is perfect. I would like to have my nails enameled in that color in her honor, if that\u2019s not an obscene thing to say.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not. She would be very pleased. If you\u2019d excuse me.\u201d\nAfter he left Kiriko said, \u201cYou should tell that to Madam in person. And I think the enamel color would go very well with your tan color.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Kiriko-san. You are beautiful, too, don\u2019t forget. The way your eyes twinkle when you talk about crafts, the way your jaws are set when you are focused.\u201d\nKiriko swallowed loudly. \u201cDo you say that to everyone?\u201d\n\u201cMm? Maybe. But everyone I like is beautiful in their own way, and I think it\u2019s important to tell them so. Let\u2019s get to work?\u201d\nThe craftsperson nodded and started going through the cosmetics purse Nova carried with her. She touched everything, one after another, trying the various textures. Powder, paste, liquid that seeped onto the brush when you rotated the stem . . . her mentor would love this brush. These things wouldn\u2019t last a day, the bearer would even have to retouch the colors on her face from time to time! How strange, these foreign customs. Some of the things even included colorant that she had never seen\u2014she swallowed, braced herself, and bored her consciousness into these.\nHer plan was to grasp how these cosmetic things were made\u2014how the substances worked, the percentage of those substances contained, the way these things mingled\u2014from the silent patterns those substances emitted and the way they moved around each other. She also copied the names of the chemicals, with Nova\u2019s help on the language, so that she could later look them up; once she learned the precise description of the substance\u2019s property, she\u2019d get to combine the knowledge with the patterns she felt from these cosmetic products, and then she could start probing for other ways of using these substances.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said after she scribbled everything she could as fast as possible. \u201cSorry to have kept you waiting.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem at all. This place is lovely. Wasn\u2019t in the travel guidebook.\u201d\n\u201cNot the best part of this country that the government wants to boast about. And foreigners must be careful if they need to walk around this area late at night.\u201d\nTogether they left the place, and like the last time the proprietor saw them off at the door. She bowed deeper and longer than the last time, though. Maybe it was just because Nova was a foreigner. But the waiters and waitresses, too, looked sad to see Nova leave.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ll visit us again soon,\u201d the proprietor said, as she handed a business card to the foreign woman.\n\u201cI will, thank you,\u201d replied Nova, touching Madam\u2019s hand lightly as she accepted the card.\n\u201cSo this Nova person. What exactly does she do?\u201d Kiriko\u2019s mentor asked as the two craftspersons started their work in their lab. \u201cIs she on a mission or something? An ambassador?\u201d\n\u201cShe is a researcher. She said she\u2019s here to study our culture, but not necessarily the colorful folks.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is there to study at all, apart from the colors of the tourism workers?\u201d\n\u201cShe says there\u2019s always something to learn as long as people live there. And that the hierarchy of the people is very peculiar here.\u201d\nHer mentor sat back and looked away from the microscope for once. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that just obvious? The colorful rule. The colorless obey.\u201d\n\u201cOn the continent there are different criteria for that. Because no colorful folks.\u201d\nHe shook his head and looked back down the lenses. Then they started their long discussion\u2014how could they stretch the flow of the silent pattern inside Madam\u2019s cracks so that it\u2019d welcome the one in the pigment portion they concocted? Was there a way to enhance the affinity of it all, or could they just draw a straight, taut line between them, so that no other thing would even think of intervening?\nAfter hours of yeses and a lot of noes and buts, they agreed on a configuration. Her mentor drew the tiniest reproduction of the silent pattern found inside Madam\u2019s crack, on an impossibly thin, almost see-through piece of soft paper, which took hours of making itself. They wrapped the dried ingredients with the paper and let the colorant absorb the pattern from inside. Madam Enamel could put one wrapped potion in her bath, immerse herself in the solution, and let the pigment settle in her cracks, drawn in by its pattern twin. The fibers of the paper would land around the affected areas, too, working for better smoothness. It would require a slightly-acidic bath to get rid of it.\n\u201cI love it,\u201d the woman said on the phone, after the first try. \u201cYou cannot see the cracks unless you look very, very carefully. And that\u2019s only if you know what to look for. And it also improves the way my skin feels as a whole. This is perfect.\u201d\nKiriko sighed into the receiver, relieved. \u201cGood to hear that, Madam. But please refrain from overusing it? We\u2019ve been very careful, but this is the first time we made something like this, so.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll call when I need the second batch.\u201d\nKiriko grinned at her mentor as she put down the receiver. He shrugged, then laughed and started humming to himself. Kiriko soon joined in the tune. A moment like this, it was one of the best things about this trade.\nBut when they did hear about her again, the words didn\u2019t come from the woman herself. It came in the form of an officer in uniform. \u201cCraftspersons,\u201d they said, when Kiriko opened the door. \u201cIf you please.\u201d\nMadam Enamel looked exhausted behind the transparent wall, but that didn\u2019t explain the cracks that had spread, covering most of her neck and invading her jawline. Kiriko had imagined the cracks to be a beautiful, treelike pattern if and when they spread, but something was wrong with the actual thing in front of her now. The color, for instance, wasn\u2019t the bad fruit they\u2019d seen when the woman first visited their place. It had a strange tinge of green to it. And the way it progressed . . . there were jumps and starts here and there, instead of branches going forward in the fan-form, using the momentum of its own growth; as if some unknown force tried to rip the skin randomly.\n\u201cOne of the places in our area got suspended for being a site matching the locals to the tourists who need . . . special services,\u201d Madam Enamel said on the other half of the cubicle, behind the see-through wall. \u201cMany more places got raided, and I was caught while I was having a bath with Nova-san. Not the best timing, is it?\u201d\nKiriko raised her brows. \u201cYou were having a bath with Nova-san?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was selling myself to a foreign stranger. And . . . \u201d She rolled her eyes towards the officer who was standing behind her, who couldn\u2019t see her doing it. \u201cShe explained that we are friends, to the authority, that she had brought in the bath bomb for the two of us.\u201d\n\u201cThen what happened to your skin?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea. It never happened before this time, the . . . thing had worked so well so far.\u201d She blinked, waiting for a question from the officer at attention; they didn\u2019t seem to have one\u2014apparently.\n\u201cDo you know when you\u2019re getting out?\u201d asked Kiriko.\nThe woman looked uneasy at this. \u201cNo. Nova is doing what she can to prove that no money was exchanged between us. The government hates us, don\u2019t they? Those of us who don\u2019t do business exclusively for rich foreigners but serve our fellow locals, too.\u201d\nKiriko massaged her brow with a finger. \u201cWe\u2019d like to look more closely . . . at your condition. Did you put anything in your bath along with the bath bomb?\u201d She hastily added, \u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d\n\u201cShe added scented water. I think that is all.\u201d\nOrdinary scented water shouldn\u2019t have been able to change anything in the composition. At least not like this. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Nova-san,\u201d Kiriko said after a moment.\n\u201cPlease do. I\u2014I hope I didn\u2019t get her into too much trouble.\u201d At that, her lips trembled, though just a little.\nThey couldn\u2019t reach Nova very soon, though, as the foreigner was busy talking to the embassy and authority. Madam Enamel was released two days later. By the time she made it to the atelier, her steps were unsteady, her eyes murky, and there was another thin but unbreakable layer of sweat over her enamel. Kiriko piled cushions on the reception\u2019s raised floor while the woman\u2019s peacock subordinate and the owner of the atelier helped the woman up onto the makeshift cot.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Kiriko\u2019s mentor said, sounding bewildered. \u201cThis\u2014this looks so much worse. The cracks are all over.\u201d\nYes; the cracks had spread even wider, to the extent that there was no smooth surface on her visible now. Nova might have said something at the embassy, but more likely this was the reason the authority had decided to let her go. Kiriko dabbed at the woman\u2019s forehead with a cloth of a heat-absorbing pattern. \u201cDid we do this?\u201d It hurt to word this question.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His admission bit like a ragged edge of ice. \u201cLet\u2019s just do whatever we can, for now.\u201d\nThe two craftspersons looked more closely at the cracks, and again, Kiriko was struck by how unnatural, the way all those lines ran. It felt very abrupt\u2014a blister that erupted, swathing the area with its nasty fluid, not a seam gradually extending. Was this just a result of aging? Unlikely, though perhaps they should have taken it into account. It had to be solely the atelier\u2019s fault.\nKiriko traced some of the cracks with her finger and quickly started adding a new pattern that would alleviate the wrongness of the one currently there. They\u2019d discovered Kiriko was better at this even than her mentor\u2014he had much wider knowledge on many things, on application of those things, and his thoroughness and meticulousness of the deployment was almost impeccable; but when it came to time-critical treatment or one-shot goes, Kiriko\u2019s instinct bloomed under the pressure and she usually had control over the situation within minutes. But this . . . her hand steadied around the stem of the brush, as if she knew where the ink had to be; she had to do this, but how much would she be able to help, randomly groping for solution as she was?\n\u201cThis might hurt a little,\u201d Kiriko\u2019s mentor was saying to the woman, but there was no reply.\nHe spread thin acid over the woman\u2019s enamel skin, to slow the cracks going farther. Kiriko started working on the worst-looking ones, those that were thicker, with that foul, greenish tinge, applying a dusty red colorant with bold yet precise strokes. Even as she did so, thread-thin lines were spreading around the bad ones, bypassing the acid. Soon her mentor started tending to these smaller ones.\nThe peacock boy rubbed his face fiercely. \u201cWhat the hell did she do?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s us,\u201d the owner of the atelier told him. \u201cOur doing.\u201d\n\u201cBut she asked for it, didn\u2019t she? We knew she\u2019d do something stupid on herself. She\u2019s been so obsessed with her own skin. Like that was all that there was keeping her house upright. But it was her. You know? It was she herself who bound that place in one, not just the skin\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up, we\u2019ll apologize and hear you boast how much you love her later, but now make yourself useful and bring us washing water for the brushes.\u201d For once, Kiriko\u2019s mentor raised his voice. \u201cThe kitchen\u2019s behind that door. There are small pots and buckets lying around.\u201d\nAnd hours afterwards ticked away like that\u2014two craftspersons drawing patterns as fast as they could on an immobilized woman, a peacock adolescent moving to-and-fro over the atelier floor. When the dawn arrived, the enamel woman\u2019s breathing was finally even, and the three young people collapsed onto the reception floor around her.\nThey didn\u2019t have beds for patients\u2014that, too, was for the clinic\u2014so after a few hours\u2019 nap they wrapped up the woman and let the peacock boy and his coworkers carry her via a coach. The two craftspersons prepared emergency transfer-print sheets that the workers of the teahouse could apply on the woman if and when need be. And they started trying to figure out what had gone wrong, right away.\nBut they couldn\u2019t see anything; they\u2019d thoroughly examined every possibility, checked her allergic reactions and the state of the ingredients, the devices and equipment they\u2019d used to prepare the treatment. Kiriko told him about the scented water that Nova had brought in. But with the configuration they\u2019d made, and the fact that the foreigner herself had been in that water, too, that this scented water thing could do any harm to just Madam Enamel seemed unlikely.\n\u201cWe do have to check what that water is, anyway,\u201d her mentor said over a hundredth cup of tea. \u201cIt is possible that there was something in that water, a substance that we have not heard of, that Madam can be allergic to.\u201d\nKiriko sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll go talk to Nova-san.\u201d\nThe foreign woman was almost equally disconcerted, if not unwell, when Kiriko finally managed to arrange a meeting. \u201cI was waiting for her to call me when she was released,\u201d she said as she let Kiriko into her hotel room.\nKiriko didn\u2019t like going behind a closed door alone with a foreigner, not because of Nova, but of custom. But this was an emergency. \u201cMadam was too ill to make a phone call,\u201d Kiriko replied, and took a seat near the window. \u201cWe asked Peacock to let us know of any change of state, so she must be still resting.\u201d\nThe foreign woman poured tea for Kiriko and herself. \u201cHow bad is it?\u201d\n\u201cWe believe we managed to stop its progress. But to eliminate it entirely\u2014we still aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s a disease or some other kind of disturbance\u2014we need to know exactly what is causing it.\u201d Kiriko bit her lip for a second. \u201cWe heard you added scented water to the bath? Do you have its container with you still?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sorry, it never occurred to me\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIs it my fault?\u201d\nShe hesitated one moment. \u201cOur fault, more likely. Me and my mentor. Do you remember its maker or seller?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll ask my sister on the continent by phone, she gave me the thing. Let me see . . . \u201d\nNova went to the closet, came back with a datebook, sat down near the phone machine. Then she blinked hard down at the datebook, and sighed. \u201cKiriko-san, my old tired eyes need the light on. Can you close the curtains for me?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d She stood and started drawing the curtains. Nova was fumbling for the light\u2019s switch. Now just one part of window was still uncovered, and Kiriko reached out to shut it there, too. But then\u2014\n\u201cWait,\u201d Kiriko said, \u201cdon\u2019t turn that light on.\u201d\n\u201cW-what?\u201d\nA sliver of setting sun came through between the curtains, fell on the table beside the window, and bounced off the polished surface to dimly illuminate the foreigner\u2019s face. Colors danced over her skin\u2014green seemed to be dominant, but the sheen shifted with bronze, orange, and something that reminded of Madam\u2019s color.\nJewel-beetle.\n\u201cNova-san, are your ancestors from this island?\u201d Kiriko asked.\n\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t mentioned that? Yes, but a very long time ago. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so much into this country.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d Kiriko said, her hand still hovering near the curtain. \u201cI think now I know what caused Madam\u2019s condition.\u201d\nThe locals looked; of course, foreigners almost never wandered out to this part of the city. But Kiriko\u2014of all people, that introvert, entirely-colorless craftsperson\u2014leading a foreigner to the pattern atelier in this shadowed area of the city seemed even more surreal than it should.\nKiriko moved stiffly all the way, even when she waved to a local or two she knew well. When they finally reached their destination, Kiriko almost cried out in relief. \u201cSensei!\u201d she called her mentor loudly to cover that urge.\n\u201cWhat\u2014oh.\u201d He went as stiff as Kiriko had been. \u201cThis . . . honorable guest here must be Nova-san?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Nova-san, this is my mentor, the owner of this atelier. Please take a seat; you need to take your shoes off first.\u201d\nAs the foreign woman did so, Kiriko went around the atelier, closing all the shutters and covering the opaque glass on the door with a cloth. Her mentor tried to catch her, failed, shifted his weight on his feet, and flailed a little. Finally, he almost twitched and said, \u201cI should offer tea!\u201d\n\u201cSensei, stop being nervous,\u201d his apprentice scolded him, forgetting her own previous stiff walk. \u201cAnd look.\u201d\nShe\u2019d brought a device which emitted light that had the same characteristics as natural sunlight. Now with Nova sitting on a flat cushion, Kiriko aimed the light to the surface of the low table beside the foreigner. Immediately her mentor saw what this was all about.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe has an ancestor from this island. I heard that once you leave this island the colors start to fade, I didn\u2019t know it could be preserved like this.\u201d\n\u201cMe, either. But this is jewel-beetle, right? Maybe not entirely impossible.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, you two, now tell me what is going on.\u201d Nova looked as uncomfortable as the two locals here had been a few moments ago.\nKiriko put away the lighting device and switched on the ordinary bulbs. \u201cYour ancestor must have been a jewel-beetle colored person. Jewel-beetle people have strange properties. Have you seen the insects themselves?\u201d Nova shook her head. \u201cWell, they wear metallic colors that change with the angle, which keeps birds away. And the colors never fade even after the bug dies because they are not pigment, but come from the shell\u2019s structure. That may be the reason your colors survived. Anyway, most of the colors of the islanders only have any kind of effect\u2014physically and mentally\u2014on the bearer themselves. But very few colors can affect others. Jewel-beetle, and Madam\u2019s enamel, are two of these very few. Though enamel is more prone to taking, than giving.\u201d\nKiriko was speaking slowly, but even locals would have trouble understanding all of this instantly. But Nova was a researcher of this island; after a quick thinking, she said, \u201cSo my color, even though I never knew it existed, did some harm to her.\u201d\n\u201cYour colors are weak, but sharing a bath, with substances we composed for her, worked almost magically, I think, invading her native color.\u201d Kiriko knelt beside the woman. \u201cIf you let us take samples of your skin, we might be able to find a pattern that would cure Madam Enamel.\u201d\n\u201cDo it, then.\u201d Nova looked sharply up at the craftspersons. \u201cDo it, by all means. Cure her. I don\u2019t care what it takes out of me.\u201d\nFirst they had to find a silent pattern that had caused the malfunction in Madam, and then construct a new one which would offset the effect of it, considering at the same time the substances they used for the original crack-remedy bath treatment. They went through everything on Nova, and hours later, found a part of membrane deep inside her eyelid that spread an almost-invisible pattern that seemed to click. Kiriko scratched the part off and looked into it with a microscope to be sure, and then started on combinations of patterns that would counterwork Nova\u2019s effect on Madam. Kiriko\u2019s mentor gave Nova eye drop medicine, and they made her stay at their atelier while her eye cured to some extent.\nAnd so by the morning, they had a pattern to, hopefully, heal Madam Enamel.\nNova (and the craftspersons) had forgotten to inform her hotel that she was staying out, so in the morning the foreigner had to call in and then go back to the place very quickly. \u201cLet me know how it goes. As soon as you find out,\u201d she said, as Kiriko saw her off at an intersection to the High Street.\nThey parted, and Kiriko started jogging towards the western quarters of the city. At the door of the teahouse Peacock was waiting for her. \u201cYour boss is already inside.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my boss\u2014how is Madam?\u201d\n\u201cResting. Not worse, not better.\u201d\nThe teahouse was closed. Kiriko walked through the eerily quiet place, though she soon heard commotion in the backyard. There, Kiriko\u2019s mentor was already drawing on Madam\u2019s arms. Kiriko took her coat off and dropped her bag onto the floor and started doing the same.\nAs soon as she spread the latest remedy-pattern over Madam\u2019s skin, Kiriko felt the current shift under her fingers. This was going to work. This was going to be okay. She almost let a sigh of relief slip, stopped herself with an effort. And felt her mentor feeling the same relief.\nShe spared one split second and smiled at the few staff who were holding their breath around the two craftspersons. They smiled and nodded back, then resumed helping them.\nOf course\u2014there were other issues than the patient herself, to be addressed later. They\u2019d both tried to brush that thought off, or to hold on to the possibility that maybe nothing would go into that direction this once. But the next day, the same officer who had come to notify them of Madam being held in custody, stood at their door looking almost sorry. \u201cWe\u2019d just pass on something like this between locals. But this time, a foreigner is involved.\u201d\n\u201cBut we didn\u2019t do anything to Nova-san.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t get back to the hotel one night, came back the next morning with scratches all over and a patterned eye patch. We cannot call that \u2018didn\u2019t do anything.\u2019\u201d\nWhen they got to the Officers\u2019 Station, Madam Enamel was there, too, with a girl with pastel-colored cotton-candy hair they remembered from the previous day accompanying her. The enamel woman looked frail, pale in her own way, but was sitting straight on the cushioned chair.\n\u201cMadam isn\u2019t properly well! How dare you drag her here?\u201d Kiriko\u2019s mentor hissed furiously.\n\u201cCraftsperson, easy.\u201d Madam Enamel raised her hand. \u201cI told them I wanted to be here and give accounts of the incident myself. I asked them, I wanted to be in the same room as you two, so that you can do whatever you need to when something goes wrong with me.\u201d At this stage, it was no use pretending that the atelier had nothing to do with Madam\u2019s condition or its treatment. \u201cThey don\u2019t usually listen to this kind of request, but they made this exception for me. That much, I should be grateful.\u201d\nHe backed off, still fuming. Kiriko looked around. \u201cWhere is Nova-san?\u201d\n\u201cShe is being asked to talk in a separate room, of course.\u201d\nThe two craftspersons took their seats on the other side of the table from Madam. \u201cAnd what are we charged for, exactly?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWhat, exactly, did you do to the foreigner? She wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to talk about. Maybe she fell off a stair or something, nothing to do with any of us,\u201d Madam said.\n\u201cThen why wouldn\u2019t she just say so?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t understand you.\u201d\n\u201cMadam,\u201d the officer frowned as they said, \u201cwe know she likes you. And it\u2019s good to see a foreigner liking one of us that way. But if there was a crime involving a foreigner, we must know.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no crime committed! And the foreigner herself doesn\u2019t recognize one, does she?\u201d\nThe officer looked very unhappy at that. For a moment, Kiriko thought they might win\u2014except there was no win or lose, not really\u2014only their atelier\u2019s future poised on the officer\u2019s finger.\nThey said, \u201cSo she just fell off a stair. But what about your disease?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\u201cYou obviously got ill right after being caught with the foreigner. Or maybe after that bath that smelled a bit funny. We do know that you had dealings with the atelier, at around the same time. You\u2019d had no conditions before then, we heard?\u201d\nStill crack-strewn, Madam Enamel stared at the officer. The progress had stopped entirely, malfunction of Madam\u2019s systems thoroughly eliminated, but there was no hiding the cracks now\u2014once this kind of change happened, there was no turning back, just like her plum color itself, ripening. They held their eyes that way for some time, while the two craftspersons could do nothing but just sit there, finding even simple breathing hard, so hard. \u201cThis has nothing to do with the situation here,\u201d the enamel woman finally said, her voice even\u2014too much so.\n\u201cWe can investigate, you see. You cannot go on without knowing the cause. What if it is contagious? You may be exposing your fellow islanders to danger, even as we speak now.\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you\u2014\u201d Her cotton candy subordinate, who had been growing impatient by the minute, was about to bang her fists on the table, but Madam Enamel stopped her with a hand.\n\u201cCandy, no,\u201d she said and shook her head. Candy breathed deep but then sprang to her feet as if to shake fume off, went to stand facing the mirrored wall.\n\u201cWhat is it, Madam Enamel?\u201d the officer continued. \u201cIf you really have no idea, you should consider closing down your place, at least until we have done proper investigation and everybody knows what caused it. If it\u2019s to do with the foreign researcher, either something she did to you or she brought into our country, we must expel her from the island, never admit her any future entrance. You should never see her again. Or,\u201d they paused, just a fraction too long to be for breathing, \u201cif that\u2019s the atelier\u2019s fault, we can just order them to discontinue their trade.\u201d\nMadam lifted her head and looked to the officer. Candy turned around.\n\u201cLook, Madam Enamel,\u201d said the officer, slowly, as if Madam wasn\u2019t quite getting them. \u201cTell us the truth. What do you owe these colorless laborers, anyway?\u201d\nThere. The two craftspersons had known it would come to this sooner or later, all along. Yes\u2014as long as the colorless were to blame, everything would be fine. Nova would get to stay on the island, keep on with her research, stay with Madam; Madam would be able to resume her position as proprietor as soon as she was well enough. The government would have no dispute with the continent.\nHappy ending to all.\nMadam Enamel looked at Kiriko and her mentor. Kiriko stared back, sending no message through that one moment of eye contact. Because after all, what did Madam owe them, really? Just a sorry end of lizard tail cut, and discarded; there were enough colorless craftspersons in the city, to replace these two.\nMadam Enamel looked back at the officer. \u201cSorry, I think I\u2019ve been mistaken a few moments ago.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, Madam. Tell us.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the foreigner. She is a descendant of islanders, and has properties that can be harmful to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the officer came to stand closer to her, their hands on the table. \u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to what? These two craftspersons did study the foreigner. They can give you the data as proofs. Or you can do it all over again, hurting her even more, and get into more trouble with the continent. And oh, I can tell there are more officers watching us behind, let me see, that mirror maybe?\u201d She pointed at the wall and Candy jumped away from it with a small cry. \u201cSurely you\u2019re recording this. You cannot erase my testimony here. Right?\u201d\nThe officer stood back up straight. \u201cAre you sure\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d Madam stood up. Candy came to support her. \u201cThe foreign researcher is harmful only to me, or to enamel people. But I haven\u2019t seen any other enamel than me in the city, so. I would not say this is contagious.\u201d She shrugged like a foreigner. \u201cCan we all go home now?\u201d\nShe stood tall, and nobody would have guessed she\u2019d been down with illness only a day ago. Her eyes were hard. The officer swallowed, before they stepped back to let her pass.\n\u201cMadam,\u201d Kiriko said, when they were back in the western end of the city. \u201cMadam.\u201d But she didn\u2019t know how she could continue.\nMadam Enamel stopped there, and turned, to face the craftspersons. She looked both of them in the eye, one of them after the other, and then touched Kiriko\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI remember,\u201d she said. \u201cI was as young as you are now, I think, when I started working in this area. A lot older than you two when I finally established my own place. I worked hard. Real hard.\u201d\nA wind blew. Candy brushed a strand of Madam\u2019s tree-bark hair out of her face, and Madam smiled at her employee.\n\u201cYou, too, might want to have your own place, some day,\u201d Madam said to Candy. Candy shrugged and they both giggled. Then Madam turned back to the craftspersons. \u201cI know you are working hard. How can I take that away from you? Nova would understand. She is a foreigner, she\u2019ll have a chance to resume her research some time. But if you lose what you have now, you\u2019ll never get it back again . . . sorry, but that\u2019s true, I think.\u201d\nKiriko\u2019s mentor nodded. \u201cThank you. There in the station, I thought I lost my atelier forever.\u201d\nKiriko stood there, silent. She knew she should be grateful and say it, too. But\u2014but what? This was the best possible outcome. \u201cBut you two. You two might not see each other again.\u201d Her voice shook, embarrassing her with her own na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\u201cAgain, she is a foreigner. I am a colorful. We\u2019ll find our way to each other in time.\u201d\nKiriko looked down and couldn\u2019t lift her head back up. When she was old enough, if there ever came a time that she had to choose between someone else\u2019s future and her mentor, would she ever be able to make the same choice?\n\u201cI do everything to protect my place. You to protect your crafts. Don\u2019t let that make you feel bad, Craftsperson.\u201d\nOnly when Madam was well away from them, Kiriko looked up. The world was blurry. Her mentor nudged her. \u201cLet\u2019s get home. I\u2019m starving,\u201d he said.\nKiriko nodded. In the weeks to come, they\u2019d hear the rumor that Madam Enamel turned into Madam Fallen Fruit. That sounded sexy, in a way foreigners and west-loitering locals liked. But Madam Enamel was lost forever, and even after years, Kiriko would mourn for that loss."}

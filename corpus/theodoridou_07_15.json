She pronounced her name as if she were French\u2014or I should say French-made, I guess, but I didn\u2019t know that at the time. She was a working girl, owned by a guy named Jerome\u2014also French, supposedly. She was waiting there for my local liaison and I, among desiccated corpses and stalls full of blown-up photos of the tortured and the dead. She kissed Dick on the lips when she saw us, before greeting me. She did it in a mechanical way, as if she were supposed to, as if she couldn\u2019t do otherwise. That\u2019s when I saw the long strip of nacre that ran down the back of her neck, along her spine, pure and magnificent. I shot Dick a questioning look.\u201cYeah yeah, it\u2019s the real deal,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my artificial girlfriend in this town. I\u2019m renting her full time. Very useful. She knows people.\u201d Dick could be snide like that. \u201cI\u2019m sure you girls will get along,\u201d he added.Brigitte turned to me, holding out her hand. She gave me a warm smile, but I could tell that she, unlike Dick, was very well aware of where we were, of the transactable images of gore and violence that surrounded us. Of the history of this place.\u201cPleasure to meet you,\u201d she said, a glint of something indecipherable in her eye. Was that an android thing? Or was that the part of her that is human?Androids can usually pass, if they don\u2019t have any visible nacre. But, of course, as soon as nacre appeared on android skin, people started wearing fake nacre patches as a fashion statement. When the patches are high quality you can\u2019t really tell them apart.What was the nacre\u2019s appeal? I suppose part of it is that we still don\u2019t understand why or how it is formed. The other part is that it\u2019s perfect, beautiful. And that it doesn\u2019t perish.Nacre is forever.[Note to self: You sound like an infatuated schoolgirl. What does Brigitte have to do with anything? Get it together. Just get the facts straight. Also, preserve both Dick\u2019s and Brigitte\u2019s anonymity.]>>>END OF FILENacre: Formation and FunctionNacre, or \u201cmother of pearl\u201d is a composite material produced by certain molluscs as an inner shell lining and as the outer coating of pearls.1 Since the APC-VII2 finalized and started regulating the production of androids globally, nacre has been a standard feature of all artificially produced semi-mechanical humanoid organisms.3 The production of android nacre had not been foreseen and remains unexplained. However, android nacre is considered harmless, if not beneficial for humans as an identifying mark, and so no attempts to avoid its appearance on android skin have been made.Nacre formation is an evolutionary conserved and multiply-convergent process among the Mollusca phylum, arising as early as the Ordovician period (488 to 443 million years ago). While the exact process of its production is little understood even in nature, the function of natural nacre is largely defensive: layers of nacre protect the soft tissues of the organism from parasites, while damaging debris can be entombed in successive layers of nacre, ultimately resulting in the formation of a pearl.The function of android nacre remains unknown.1 - \u201cPearl\u201d is also slang for a locally produced hallucinogenic that is sometimes used in meditation. Despite the name, the connection with either natural or android nacre has not been confirmed, largely due to lack of research.2 - APC: Android Production Committee.3 - These are commonly referred to as Androids, as this has been the popular term for many decades\u2014however the universal applicability of the term has been questioned on various grounds. Still, other proposed terms, such as Gynoid and Cyborg, although more accurate in certain cases, are no longer in widespread use.>>>END OF FILEFieldnotes #1It\u2019s Dick\u2019s afternoon playtime and he makes Brigitte re-enact scenes from his past while I try to work on my article. Playing in front of me is awkward, indiscrete. Vulgar, even. But I\u2019m sure he does it on purpose\u2014he wants me there. He wants me to witness this, and he knows I won\u2019t interfere. He is the client: his game, his rules.Brigitte playacts Sandra, my college friend and Dick\u2019s ex-wife. She kinda looks like her too. Now they\u2019re acting out the night Sandra left him\u2014left us. Dick is high on pearl. I can tell from that slightly unfocused look in his eyes. Like he sees things past Brigitte, past the windows and the smog, past the illusion of life.\u201cI can\u2019t be with you any more,\u201d Brigitte says. It sounds like she\u2019s said this line a hundred times already\u2014a recitation. It seems she\u2019s in learning mode for these sessions. Dick is shaping her into Sandra. I find this deeply disturbing. \u201cYou\u2019re such a brute,\u201d Brigitte recites. \u201cNot sophisticated at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s who I was when you married me. What was different then?\u201dBrigitte pretends to put all of her clothes in a suitcase, preparing to leave. Dick follows her around, practically yelling in her ear.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what was different,\u201d Dick says, \u201cyou were a horny little cunt back then, weren\u2019t you.\u201dBrigitte stops packing and just stares at him.\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to cry now,\u201d Dick says, and then pretend-slaps his forehead. \u201cBut I forgot. You can\u2019t cry, can you?\u201d He turns to me. \u201cHey Aliki, did you know that? Android whores can\u2019t cry. Because who wants to fuck a whiny bitch, right? Right?\u201dI look at Brigitte. I think I see a twitch disfigure her lips for the tiniest of moments, but then she smiles. \u201cWho wants to fuck a whiny bitch?\u201d she repeats. Still in learning mode. Damn it.\u201cYou really are a dick sometimes, Richard,\u201d I say.Dick laughs. He comes over and hugs me.Brigitte keeps smiling, a twinkle in her eye.>>>END OF FILENacre: Human UseHistorically, nacre has been prized for its iridescent appearance, while its strength and resilience has made it a suitable material for a variety of purposes. The nacreous shells of sea snails were used as gunpowder flasks in the 18th century and earlier. Nacre inlays have decorated some of the most renowned temples and palaces in Istanbul, traditional musical instruments in Greece, the keys of flutes, and the buttons of kings and queens the world over. Some accordion and concertina bodies are entirely inlaid with nacre. Little spoons made solely of nacre have been used to eat caviar in Russia, in order not to spoil the taste with metal.All of these practices, although rarer, continue to this day. However, where natural nacre was used in the past, android nacre, the price of which is exorbitant due to the legal restrictions placed on its farming, is mostly used today.[Note to self: I wonder what it feels like for androids. Do they consider nacre to be a part of their skin? A part of who they are? What would it feel like to see your skin as decoration, a musical instrument, a spoon?]>>>END OF FILEFalse Start #2MASSACRE MARKET: A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND SILENCEby Aliki Karyotakisfor the London New Times\u201cThat great dust-heap called \u2018history.\u2019\u201d\u2014Augustine Birrell\u201cTruth? I have no use for that. Truth won\u2019t feed my people. It won\u2019t cover their bodies. Won\u2019t keep them safe.\u201d\u2014The GeneralMy air-conditioned taxi drives me through the outskirts of the city. I gaze in comfort at the unfinished highways, the hollow skeletons of skyscrapers looming over them as a reminder of the economic fallout\u2014a city in perpetual suspension. But once at the centre, this city is impeccable\u2014polished and shiny, no sign of poverty or suffering anywhere. It makes one think of the new regime\u2019s necessity, its efficiency. A good alternative to the chaos and agony that came before. Only the smog weighs on us, like a bad omen.As soon as I step out of the vehicle, I realize this is the hottest and most humid part of the day; the smog is so thick I can hardly breathe or make out any sky. My local liaison is meeting me in front of the city pillar, the geographical and spiritual centre of the city, from where everything extends outwards. I find out that the Massacre Market is tucked away at the heart of a crowded, semi-underground slum\u2014the city\u2019s last. We have to get there on foot. It will be a difficult journey.When we arrive, hot and breathless, I am greeted by what my liaison describes as \u201cThe Political Cadaver of this country\u201d: the dead body politic, the regime\u2019s atrocities mechanically reproduced and exchanged in a gamble with the spirits of the dead, a funerary protest. The place is crowded and dark and putrid; the stalls exhibit small mountains of body parts and corpses\u2014some fake, some real (and I can\u2019t tell which is which)\u2014the brownish hue of decay accentuated by the bright orange robes of the monks and nuns that frequent the place, looking for visual aids to their death meditations. Tall cork-lined walls are covered by the forbidden pictures of the massacred and those brutalized by police. Relatives petrified in front of them, looking for the familiar face among the myriads, looking but not wanting to find I\u2019m sure, or making small shrines with offerings for the disappeared; while protestors and instigators pick out the most shocking ones to circulate and share, to dub as the hidden reality of the regime, its true face the face of those it murdered. In the loudspeakers, recordings of the massacre\u2019s soundscape: screams and bullets, the sound of revolting children and of a state devouring its young.I spot a mother clinging to the image of her dead boy, his face proliferated ad infinitum, plastering an entire wall, in protest.Here, at Massacre Market, death is a political act.[Note to self: People need the historical and political background of the story to make sense of any of these. Start with an interview instead? Also, explain Death Meditation.]>>>END OF FILEThe First Death MeditationDeath is certain.There is no way to escape death.We start dying the moment we are born.The body is a husk, a shell, an overcoat. It must be left behind.Imagine you are performing a vivisection on yourself.Imagine every detail.Concentrate on the repulsiveness of the human body.The corpse, swollen and bruised.The skin, peeled back.The fat, removed.The muscle, shredded.The organs, shrivelled and gone.The bones, pulverized.The corpse, festering. The corpse, fissured. The corpse, gnawed. The corpse, dismembered, fragmented, scattered. The corpse, bleeding. The corpse, eaten by maggots and gone.You remain.>>>END OF FILEInterview with X, one of the leading protestors at the November MassacrePart I [PLX1.vf]Q: What is Massacre Market?A: Images of death, disease, and violence are forbidden by the regime; they are not good for foreign affairs, for the economy, won\u2019t bring in investments. So now there\u2019s a black market for that. It\u2019s not about money, though. We believe in an exchange of gifts with and for the dead. At the same time, it\u2019s a political thing. Because the government and the military want to hide the dead, when we photograph them and share their pictures, when we circulate footage of the massacres, we are exposing the true face of the regime. It\u2019s a form of protest.Q: A protest against what?A: Against the regime\u2019s suppression of the fundamental truths of life and death. Of poverty and suffering. Against the state\u2019s cover-ups of its core practices, the terrorizing and massacre of its own citizens when they dare to speak out or deviate in any way.Q: Then how does Massacre Market survive? How come they haven\u2019t shut it down yet?A: They have tried; they do raid it from time to time, but it pops up again after a while. Some people believe it is allowed to exist, or even that it has been set up by the government, as a safety valve, you know? To serve as an illusion of resistance.Q: Do you believe that?A: I do not.Q: Can you talk about the November Massacre? I know this is the most recent one, but there have been others.A: Yes, that is correct.[He hesitates.]Q: Can you recount the day of the Massacre?A: [Pause] In the morning, the General was scheduled to appear at the city centre, very near the University. Attendance was, of course, mandatory, for students and first class citizens alike. So everyone gathered as planned. The General delivered the formal greeting and raised his arms in the usual salutation. The masses cheered, as expected, as they should. They couldn\u2019t do otherwise, you understand. But then, then, they kept on cheering. And clapping. Just cheering and clapping as loud as they could, whistling and cheering, and waving. And they wouldn\u2019t stop. After a few minutes, it became evident that this was no enthusiasm. It was super-conformity, you see? By cheering, they did not allow the General to speak. He literally couldn\u2019t get a word in. But what could he do? We were only applauding, he couldn\u2019t possibly punish us for that. So he mumbled the end of the speech he never managed to actually deliver, got off the podium and went back to wherever it is the General goes back to. And then the crowd was allowed to disperse, but the students and some others lingered. They were still not allowing themselves to talk, but they were smiling. They were shaking hands, not yet daring to speak about change, but that feeling, you know? That feeling, it was there. I felt it.But then the trucks and the tanks appeared and sealed off the main square around the city pillar with the students still in it. We were surrounded before we realized what was going on. Some of us managed to slip through and save ourselves. Some holed themselves up inside the Polytechnic School at the University. They got them, though, eventually. They got them all.Q: What did they do to them?A: Why are you asking? You know very well what they did to them. You\u2019ve seen the pictures, no? [Kneeling under the sun, hands tied, some behind their backs, some in front of their chests, beaten with steel batons and shiny black boots. Taken with a fisheye lens, they look like a human ocean. Innumerable, uncountable, and unaccounted for.] You\u2019ve seen the footage. [Herded onto cattle-trucks by the back of their necks. Taken to that off-camera place from where no-one returns.] At four o\u2019clock, it rained. The streets turned red.[Pause] Of this, we will not speak. [He takes a moment to find his bearings, he seems truly emotional. Then he adds:] They even destroyed several androids\u2014most of them sex workers and cleaners\u2014and later reimbursed their owners. I should say \u201cbribed,\u201d to keep them from making a fuss.Q: You said androids? Why were they there? Were androids part of the protest?A: Yes, android guerillas have always been on our side, and uni students are often particularly drawn to them. There are several reasons for this. On the one hand, androids are part of the oppressed. They are low class, second rate, not even citizens. Most people don\u2019t even consider them persons. But there is also something about them that speaks of truth, not least their perfect, infallible memories. It\u2019s the human machine\u2019s trap: the freedoms afforded to them by what little flesh they possess and command, the failings of that same flesh . . . these are not so easy to tell apart. They do not decay, too, while our whole culture is premised on decay and death, or, now, on its concealment. Why do you think people are so crazy about those nacre patches? You\u2019ve seen the ones?[Note to Self: Transcribe the rest of the interview from voice file PLX2.vf]>>>END OF FILEFieldnotes #2Getting people to talk is difficult. Brigitte and Dick work hard to find me the right contacts. But it takes time, and I know so little. I understand so little. This investigation is going to be long. We need to be discreet.I often sit and watch Brigitte when she thinks I\u2019m in my head, working, not paying attention to her.She seems restless in her own skin, walking from the door to the window and back again. She stares outside at the smog\u2014you can\u2019t see anything out the window, just grey and brown. Well, at least I can\u2019t. Maybe she can see something, maybe she can see everything. I don\u2019t know.Her nacre has been multiplying the past few weeks. There is a new patch behind her left ear, and one on the back of her right hand\u2014her most prominent still. It makes her look adorned.When she catches me looking at her, the programming kicks in and she responds with her standard line, every time: \u201cWhat can I do for you, honey?\u201d Then she lowers her eyes and looks embarrassed.She\u2019s always lived here, and yet I can detect a faint French accent when she says this. Like some guy\u2019s fantasy of what a French whore should sound like.>>>END OF FILESome notes on the translation of Massacre MarketThere is some uncertainty about the translation from the local language of what I have called \u201cMassacre Market.\u201d Other possible translations include \u201cAtrocity Place,\u201d \u201cMassacre Fair,\u201d or, and that was the most confusing aspect of this, \u201cPearl Fountain,\u201d because even though each of the two words means something different, together they create a new compound which, as Dick and Brigitte explained to me, could rather clumsily be interpreted as \u201ca fountain whence pearls flow,\u201d \u201cthe breeding ground of oysters,\u201d or even \u201cthe plane of sublime imperfections.\u201d>>>END OF FILEFieldnotes #3Dick has started being rougher in his re-enactments; I doubt these are memories, no, I\u2019m sure they are not, because these versions are conflicting and contradictory, and things happen that I know never really happened. Brigitte/Sandra is not always the one leaving him any more\u2014sometimes he leaves her, sometimes she dies. Sometimes he kills her, chokes her. Or, he pretends to. He acts disinterested afterwards, says these are only stories he makes up and likes to play out; but I know, any reporter knows there are no disinterested stories, least of all the ones we tell ourselves.Brigitte says she doesn\u2019t mind, she doesn\u2019t feel, remember? It\u2019s her job, she says. I\u2019m still not convinced. I find myself in my reporter\u2019s role nonetheless, taking everything in, observing, reluctant to participate. This is not how the game is played, I tell myself.I watch the nacre spread on her skin, covering more and more each day, like a disease of unbearable beauty.\u201cHow did you end up in this mess, anyway?\u201d Dick asked me yesterday. \u201cI never thought they\u2019d send a woman.\u201dI hit him hard on the arm and he laughed. \u201cI choose not to be insulted,\u201d I said. \u201cAnyway, I needed this. Badly. Went through a rough patch a while back and was out of circulation for some time. So when I went back to my boss and begged, he gave me the case nobody else would take.\u201dDick stopped fiddling with his cigarettes and turned to me. I had his full attention now, and I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted it. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201cRough? How rough?\u201d he asked.I said nothing.\u201cYou know you can talk to me, right?\u201dI thought of his hands around Brigitte\u2019s neck. What happened to you, Richard? You were a tender boy, back then.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Dick. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dI think I hurt his feelings, but he tried not to show it. And at that moment I realized I didn\u2019t mind. Hurting him. I didn\u2019t mind at all.>>>END OF FILEThe Second Death MeditationThe second meditation rehearses the actual death process.Engage now in this series of yogas, modelled on death.First, the body becomes very thin, the limbs barely held together. You will feel that the body is sinking into the earth. Your sight becomes blurry and obscured. You may see mirages. Do not believe them. The body loses its lustre.Then, all the fluids in the body dry up. Saliva, sweat, urine, blood dry up. Feelings of pleasure and pain dry with them. You may feel like smoke.Then, you can no longer hear. You cannot digest food or drink. You do not remember your name, or the names of the ones you knew and loved. You cannot smell. You may not be able to inhale, but you will be able to exhale.Then, the ten winds of the body move to your heart. You will no longer inhale or exhale. You will not be able to taste. You will not care. The root of your tongue will turn blue. You may feel like a lamp about to go out.Then, nothing.Then, nothing.Then, nothing. The ten winds dissolve. The indestructible drop at the heart is all that remains.>>>END OF FILEFieldnotes #4\u201cWhy do you let him treat you like that?\u201d I ask her almost reflexively one day. I regret it right away. Am I blaming her for the way he treats her? Shouldn\u2019t I be blaming him?She thinks about it for a while, then shrugs.\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. Some things are in my programming.\u201d\u201cYes, but some aren\u2019t.\u201dShe looks me in the eyes, fixes her gaze there, and she seems less human than ever before. People don\u2019t look at others like that. \u201cI\u2019m a whore,\u201d she states.\u201cYou are more than a whore. It\u2019s not who you are. It\u2019s simply what you do.\u201d\u201cSee, you got it backwards. What we are for is who we are. A hammer is what a hammer does. Would you ever use a hammer to screw a screw or cut a piece of wood?\u201d\u201cJust a tool, then.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.

Aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s not an android thing. It\u2019s an existential thing.\u201dI lower my eyes.She leans over and touches my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes empathy is difficult for me. We don\u2019t feel anything, you know. No feelings.\u201dShe seems sincere, but I don\u2019t believe her; I tell her so. \u201cSome people say the nacre is a byproduct of the things you do feel that were not programmed. Just like the nacre wasn\u2019t, and yet, there it is.\u201dShe shrugs again. \u201cMy programming allows me to imitate feeling and to learn from other people\u2019s perceptions of me. No one knows what the nacre is, or what it does.\u201d She pauses for a bit. Then she adds: \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a form of rust. Tools do rust, don\u2019t they?\u201d>>>END OF FILEMy tripI\u2019m sitting by the window, looking out. The smog seems heavier today. Darker, too. I think it\u2019s the colour of rot. I wish I could see past it. I wish I could see.Brigitte comes home\u2014I notice there is a bright new patch of nacre under her right eye. She smiles, like she always does.\u201cGet dressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to show you something.\u201dWhen I\u2019m ready to go, she holds out her hand closed in a fist. Slowly, she uncurls her fingers and reveals a pearl resting on her palm. It takes me a couple of seconds to realize what it is, and then I look at her, trying to figure out what she\u2019s planning.\u201cPut this under your tongue, Aliki,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll understand.\u201dI put the pearl into my mouth and we set out into the smog and that corpse of a city.We are at the main square. The pearl is still dissolving under my tongue; it tastes sweet and tangy and makes my heart beat irregularly. I see the city pillar towering over us\u2014round and bulging at the bottom, thinning as it reaches for the sky. The top disappears into the thick layers of smog above. Its marble surface emits a subdued light, like a fading beacon.\u201cIt was built hundreds of years ago as a mystical axis around which the city would be born, you know,\u201d Brigitte says. \u201cThe story of its construction is now largely ignored and forgotten, but spirit mediums still gather here sometimes. They consider it a source of power for those who commune with the dead. It is said that when the foundation for the pillar was laid, a fosse was dug around it. They brought every young pregnant slave girl they could find, slit their throats and threw them in there to die, and through their deaths empowered the pillar to protect the city.\u201dI look at the base of the pillar and realize I am standing on top of where the trench would have been, if that story were true. The pillar starts glowing brighter and brighter and I look up to see if the sun has somehow penetrated the smog. I feel the ground shake under my feet, then give, and I fall into the trench. The slave girls are there, all around me, with their blood still seeping into the earth, their fetuses still dying in their wombs.This city is built on gore. The shiny marble, a tombstone laid over history. I see the streets turn into veins. I see students parade through the city with what corpses they could salvage; they carry them on their shoulders, their friends, their classmates, their lovers, displaying them like a mute witness to the regime\u2019s moral order. And then these students are shot down or snatched off the streets, the corpses torn from their arms. They are strung on trees and shot, or burnt alive, or worse. Of this, we will not speak.The body is nothing. Its image, everything.Brigitte pulls me away. She leads me through the city\u2019s red streets, the ten winds of its body dying down. I think Brigitte is speaking to me. I think she says:\u201cLet\u2019s look for the indestructible drop at the heart.\u201dWe are descending. She is walking in front of me, showing me the way. The nacre on her skin seems brighter than ever. I dare touch it for the first time\u2014I reach out and brush my fingers against the back of her neck, tracing the nacre down her spine. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so hard. \u201cYou are indestructible,\u201d I mutter, or I think I do, and she turns around and smiles.We are at Massacre Market. It has changed since the first time I saw it; it seems even more crowded now, the walls of photographs fuller, covered once, and then covered again by more pictures, and more on top of those, layer upon gory layer, corpse upon corpse, body part upon body part. The desiccated corpses seem more real now, almost alive, absurd. Brigitte tells me something I don\u2019t hear; her voice drowns in the screams and static spilling from the loudspeakers.One of the photographs on the wall next to me catches my eye. I walk closer\u2014it\u2019s grainy, black and white, but I can still see the girl: she is laid out in a field next to others, dozens of others. Her top is removed, her chest slashed open. \u201cForeign slut\u201d is written on her bare belly. She looks like a younger version of myself. This is me, I think, this is me, years ago. Why don\u2019t I remember this? I put my palm on the photograph\u2014what did I want to do? Cover her up, I suppose\u2014and I notice a patch of nacre spreading between my fingers. I pull my hand back as if the photo suddenly burnt me and I watch the nacre spread. I feel it cover my entire body, and I\u2019m calcified, my skin adorned and indestructible. \u201cI feel like an instrument,\u201d I shout to Brigitte over the sound of massacre, \u201clike an accordion, or a concertina.\u201d Play me like a flute, O Lord, I think.Brigitte tries to tell me something, but I can\u2019t make it out. I struggle to read her lips. \u201c . . . it disappoints . . . \u201d I hear, but the rest is stifled by static, and she\u2019s far away. I see her pointing at my arms from afar. I look down and see the nacre growing dull and flaking, then my skin peeling and falling off, the fat exposed, the muscle, the bone, and I know, I know then, this city is a skin, no blood anywhere in sight, all surface, all shine and the slightest glimpse of nacre here and there\u2014is it real? Is it not? Does it make a difference?>>>END OF FILEFalse EndingsI have precious little time left. So I will not say much. One never has the skin that befits her.I know I\u2019ll never finish this article\u2014I still haven\u2019t even decided on the title, or what this story is really about. What do you think? I might have called it:Massacre MarketorThe Mechanical Reproduction of Violence: Truth, Massacre, Historyor evenAndroid Whores Can\u2019t Cry: Under the Surface of Death MeditationEither way, I know that, if I did finish it, I would dedicate it\u201cTo my B., my pearl, who taught me this:The skin always disappoints.\u201d>>>END OF FILE>>>END OF RECORD. 14 OF 14 FILES RECOVERED.This is all the material I managed to retrieve from Aliki\u2019s hard drives. I wait for the reporter sitting across from me in Dick\u2019s living room to go through them.\u201cYou realize your memory files provide conflicting information about what happened to both my colleague Aliki Karyotakis and her informant Richard Phillips,\u201d he says.I am silent. Is that true?I recall the last time I saw Aliki.She is lurching at Dick, pushing him away from me during one of his violent playacts. He falls back and hits his head. He is very still. We are all very still.She is also standing by the city pillar with me, in a crowd of people I haven\u2019t quite registered. I look at the sky. The sun is shining through the smog. When I look down again, she\u2019s gone.She is also looking at me as a tall man leads her onto a platform and places a hood over her head. Then a noose. Then the platform gives.She was also never here. I never met her.And Dick? Dick is always either dead or missing.\u201cHave you tinkered with your memory?\u201d the reporter asks.\u201cIt is possible,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I have no memory of that, as I am sure you are aware.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d He shuffles in his chair. \u201cOK, let\u2019s take the first version. Can you tell me what happened?\u201dHe already knows this. Why does he ask?\u201cShe pushed him. He died. Humans break easily like that.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cShe turned herself in.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t she terminated?\u201d That\u2019s when I notice the nacre on his underarm. Ah.\u201cI think the human term is \u2018sentenced to death and executed,\u2019\u201d I correct him. He should know this. I\u2019m sure he does.\u201cDid you watch? The execution, I mean.\u201dI watch him. He is serious, eyes cold. A reporter reports.\u201cA hammer is what a hammer does,\u201d I whisper.\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d I say. \u201cA reflex. Yes. Yes, I think I watched.\u201d I sense the nacre spread on my face, my surface irreparably hardened. It reflects the light so brightly it almost hurts my eyes.\u201cAre you going to cry?\u201d he asks, hoping, I bet, for a good twist in his story.The programming takes over, like gears shifting inside me, and I can\u2019t stop it, I can\u2019t stop it, I can\u2019t.\u201cAndroid whores can\u2019t cry,\u201d I say. \u201cWho wants to fuck a whiny bitch?\u201dThis puzzles him. He focuses on my lips, and he\u2019s about to say something, but he stops. I know he stops because of what he sees. He looks disappointed.I feel the nacre cover my lips and I realize this was the last time I spoke. This shouldn\u2019t be happening so fast. I think of freedoms and failings. I am not sure which is which. It doesn\u2019t matter. I am the oyster and the pearl. I am a shell that doesn\u2019t speak.I wonder what really happened to her, what happened to Dick. I know I\u2019ll never know\u2014and this somehow strikes me as appropriate. The truth has seeped through the pores on the skin of the city. Aliki is in its bloodstream now. So is Dick.

Not that I could really smell her from three floors up through the mesh and bars, but there\u2019s only three types of girls here, and she was definitely the sour milk kind. Her head hung down like it was too much work to raise it, and her long black hair flopped around so you couldn\u2019t see her face. I\u2019d have bet a week\u2019s credits she had big ol\u2019 scaredy-cat eyes, but she never bothered to look up, just let Miss Miranda lead her by the elbow through the front doors. Didn\u2019t even try to run. Sour milk all the way.\n Even sour milk new girls were good, though; anything new was good. The last one, Hope, might have been dull as old paint, but at least she\u2019d been something different to talk about. I\u2019d even won a day\u2019s credits from Flash by betting the girl wouldn\u2019t make it to fourteen without some foster trying her out and keeping her. Anyone could tell Hope smelled like cinnamon and honey, same as those babies on the first floor and the second-floor girls with their pigtails and missing-tooth smiles. Sure enough, only took six months before the Reynolds came and took Hope off to their nice house with the big beds and the white fence and those stupid yapping dogs, leaving just me and Whispers and Flash to stare at each other and count all the months and years \u2019til we\u2019d finally turn eighteen. Flash should\u2019ve known it would go that way\u2014cinnamon and honey\u2019s something fosters can\u2019t resist.\n Whispers said this new girl was officially called Brenda, but that was just as stupid as all the other Agency names, and the girl wouldn\u2019t remember it after Processing anyway. At first I said we should call her Dishrag or Milkbreath, but even Flash thought that was too mean, and Flash is as nasty as hot sauce and lye. She\u2019s the one who named me Ghost, on account of I\u2019m small and shadow-dark and she thinks I creep around too much in the night. She got her name \u2019cause that\u2019s how fast fosters send her back after their cat turns up dead and they realize the devil has blond hair and dimples.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s in her file?\u201d I asked Whispers, who was still leaned up against the wall by the window. She never bothered to look out anymore. Not even for new girls.\n \u201cI\u2019m just supposed to clean the office,\u201d she said. \u201cFiles are confidential.\u201d\n \u201cMust be good if you\u2019re holding back,\u201d said Flash, blowing out air as she tried to whistle.\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d Whispers said, with a lopsided shrug. Then she murmured something nobody could hear while staring down at her shoes. That meant we weren\u2019t getting any more from her for at least an hour, not even if Flash threatened to throw her out the window or hang her with the sheets from one of the empty beds. No use pushing her \u2019til she started banshee-screaming, so Flash just practiced whistling and I played around some with our crap computers and we let Whispers go all sour milk and talk to her invisible friends.\n By the time Flash got a half-whistle half-spit sound to come out of her mouth and I\u2019d finished up my hack of the first-floor baby cams for when things got boring, new girl was being led off the elevator by Miss Miranda, head still down. Flash and I lined up in front of the room same as always\u2014hands behind our backs, chests up and out, heads forward, eyes wide. Even Whispers came out of her murmuring and straightened up against the wall. Agency folks didn\u2019t care about much as far as us third-floors were concerned, but they were total nuts for protocol.\n Miss Miranda started by doing her normal speech-troduction. This is Brenda, she\u2019s fifteen years old, and she\u2019s going to stay with us for a while. These are the girls, they\u2019re all trying to get new homes too. And we just know it\u2019ll work out for you all any day now. When she said that last bit, her voice always got real high, like someone talking after they took a gulp of air from a circus balloon.\n We ask you to stay on the third floor when you\u2019re in the building unless you\u2019re doing chores downstairs or get called to the office. But don\u2019t worry\u2014there\u2019s so much to do up here, you won\u2019t even notice. Her voice went even higher for that part, \u2019cause even an idiot could see there wasn\u2019t anything on the floor but twenty empty beds, two long white lunch tables, a couple of old computers on splintery desks covered with the names of old third-floors, and the door to the world\u2019s grimiest bathroom.\n As long as you maintain good grades and proper behavior in school, you\u2019re free to come and go as you please until seven PM curfew. You\u2019ll get a few credits each day for transit and meals. If you need additional learning help or assistance with your homework, the computers in the back row have plenty to offer. Age-appropriate stuff only, of course. She looked straight at me when she said it, like it was my fault the security on the things was shit and I\u2019d figured out a way to order vapes and liquor pops and get R-rated videos.\n Now you girls get along, and try not to kill each other. She looked at Flash for that one, even though Flash hadn\u2019t really tried to kill anyone for at least a year. She\u2019d barely even talked to Hope. Either she was getting soft now that we were in high school, or she was gonna burn the whole place down someday. Maybe both.\n As soon as she got the last words out of her mouth, Miss Miranda spun around on her high heels and got out of there as fast as she could. I thought the new girl would fall over as soon as Miss Miranda left, but she put her hands behind her back and stuck her chest out same as the rest of us. Her eyes weren\u2019t nearly as scaredy-cat as I thought they\u2019d be. She smelled like sour milk for sure, but hot sauce and honey a little bit too.\n \u201cI\u2019m Brenda,\u201d she said. \u201cBrenda Nevins.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s a stupid name,\u201d said Flash.\n \u201cIt\u2019s what my daddy called me,\u201d said new girl, thrusting her chest out even more, like it would cover the way her voice got all wobbly.\n \u201cYeah? Well where\u2019s your daddy now?\u201d Flash asked. The new girl\u2019s head dropped forward. We hadn\u2019t made a bet on whether someone could make her cry, but there were some things Flash would do for free.\n \u201cShe doesn\u2019t remember,\u201d I told Flash. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n \u201cI remember fine,\u201d said the new girl. \u201cIt\u2019s just that . . . it just happened. He just died, I mean.\u201d\n Flash rolled her eyes.\n \u201cNo way you remember that shit,\u201d she said. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d She put on her best Miss Miranda impression, high pitched and piercing. \u201cYour memories of your time before joining the Agency are being held for safekeeping until you reach adulthood and can properly integrate them into your daily life.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d new girl said. \u201cI remember my dad. He was a\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSpare me the bullshit,\u201d Flash said, voice back low. \u201cMiss Miranda tell you how in your file it says your daddy was a famous reccer? Or a Wall Street corp? Or a doctor? Bet if you looked in the \u2019grams she took from you, you\u2019d find out he left you chained up in the basement. Or he liked to beat on your mama. Or maybe you ain\u2019t never had no daddy at all.\u201d\n I felt my eyes get hot, just a little, but new girl didn\u2019t blink.\n \u201cMy daddy was a good man,\u201d she said. \u201cNot my fault if yours wasn\u2019t worth shit.\u201d\n I backed up two steps so as not to get hit when the fists started flying. A fight was gonna mean discipline and lights-out and early curfew for at least two weeks. Nothing worse than that and having a black eye. But Flash just laughed.\n \u201cDamn, girl,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got balls. Gonna be hard coming up with a name for you.\u201d\n \u201cMy dad\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYour dad won\u2019t know any different.\u201d I tried to stare some sense into the girl before Flash flipped back to serious and threw her across the room, or started working out how to smother her in the middle of the night. \u201cLeave his name for him and ours for us. I\u2019m Ghost. She\u2019s Flash. That\u2019s Whispers. We\u2019ll figure something out for you.\u201d\n It took two weeks, but in the end, we called her Princess. Flash said it was from some fairy-tale book she\u2019d read as a little kid, but I\u2019d been to the Reynolds\u2019 for a tryout same as she had, and Princess was the name of the dumb fat poodle they all fed under the table. Plus Flash said it like a curse, with a sparkle in her eye that any idiot could tell meant trouble. I told Princess not to worry, though; I\u2019d watch her back. Not sure why. Maybe \u2019cause if Princess turned up dead it was back to just Whispers and Flash to talk to. Maybe \u2019cause I used to be a bit of a sour milk girl too.\n Me and Princess almost pinky-swore on the whole thing, but I told her that was just for little kids and losers. Even if you were too poor to get wired up soon as you turned fourteen so you could swap \u2019grams of every stupid thing you did with all your besties in the school cafeteria, anybody could put together the credits for a memory share at one of the public booths. Sure, all the MemCorps signs said with adult supervision only, \u2019cause fooling around in your head like that could mess you up when your brain was still growing, but I just told the guy at the front we were over eighteen and gave him a two-cred tip. And Princess let him look down her shirt a little when he asked to see our pretty little smiles.\n We got hooked up to our chairs in one of the side-by-sides. They were sticky, but it felt like old candy, not blood or anything, so I locked in. I had to show Princess how, but she caught on quick\u2014straps on, headset up, earpieces in. I didn\u2019t get into all the MemCorps does this and your brain cells do that and then you see the memory clear as if it happened to you part, \u2019cause Princess might have been a little sad looking, but she didn\u2019t seem dumb.\n \u201cYour session has begun,\u201d said the booth voice, all high and cool, like if Miss Miranda had turned into a robot.\n I started first, since I knew how to work the thing. Shared my memory of the time I pulled some stupid rich girl\u2019s chair out at school and she fell back and her legs went one way and her arms went another and her mouth made a big O shape and I laughed for about an hour. Princess giggled right along with me, but there was no way to tell how much of that was real and how much was the machine\u2014easy enough to get swept away in a share without halfway trying.\n \u201cThat\u2019s all you got, Ghost?\u201d she said, when we were finished laughing. \u201cSome girl falling over?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, but you said we\u2019re supposed to be swapping something real.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a memory booth, dumbass,\u201d I said, smiling so she knew I didn\u2019t mean something by it like Flash would. \u201cOf course it\u2019s real.\u201d And it was, even if I didn\u2019t share the part where Miss Miranda found out and made my head ache for a week. I liked Princess fine, but you couldn\u2019t give everything to some new girl in one go.\n \u201cNot real like true,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cReal like important. Like my daddy.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sick of hearing about your damn daddy all the time.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause you didn\u2019t know him the way I did,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was real.\u201d\n And then she shared him with me\u2014one \u2019gram after another. The way he half-smiled when she walked in the house, how it sounded when he called her Brenda, how she found him dead in his rocking chair and didn't tell anyone for a whole day even though it started to stink. The public booths were old and ragged, but I could still smell the rotten and taste the tang of garbage in my mouth and feel the pound pound of her heart thinking it was the Agency every time a car drove by. Whole thing made my eyes sting and my throat itch.\n \u201cReal like that,\u201d Princess said, voice all whispery. I just shook my head. No thinking about what my daddy could\u2019ve looked like and what he might\u2019ve called me. Needed to clear everything out and get back on even ground.\n \u201c\u2019Cmon. Just show me something,\u201d she said, and for a second, I wished Flash was there, just to tell her to shut the hell up and leave me alone.\n \u201cMaybe next time,\u201d I said instead, taking the straps off of my legs clip by clip, telling my hands not to shake. \u201cWe\u2019re out of time anyways.\u201d\n Princess flipped her hair back with her hand, turned her head, and looked me straight in the eyes. \u201cYou think that guy out there\u2019s gonna mind if we go over?\u201d\n \u201cNo. I just . . . \u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t want to share something real,\u201d she said, ripping her straps off and throwing her goggles back on the shelf, acting like sour milk and hot sauce had a baby. \u201cI get it.\u201d\n \u201cYou really fucking don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cMe, Flash, Whispers . . . we don\u2019t have something real to share. All those cute, sweet memories of being a kid? Snatched off us when we got to the Agency and locked away where we can\u2019t get \u2019em. All we know is school and the third floor and a few fosters who couldn\u2019t be bothered to keep us. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all we fucking got.\u201d\n Princess stared at me for a second, eyes wide, then walked out, saying I didn\u2019t know and Sorry under her breath like she was doing a Whispers impression. I stayed for a while, playing back the couple of half-decent memories I did have, like the day I figured out how to get the computers in the back to do what I wanted, like a real hacker, or the times the Agency let us go down to the first floor and play with the babies, and then the ones that made my neck shiver, like all the times fosters sent me back \u2019cause I didn\u2019t fit into any of the smiling family photos\u2014too old, too dark, too \u201chard to handle.\u201d\n But none of my memories were real the way Princess wanted. They didn\u2019t make my blood jump or my hands get all shaky or my mouth go dry. Not even the bad ones. Not the Reynolds\u2019 dog Butch chasing me \u2019round their big house, growling and smelling like death and scaring me more than Flash ever had. Not little Bitsy Reynolds laughing and telling me how I seemed nice enough for a dark girl, but Butch hated who he hated and you couldn\u2019t tell a dog any different. Not Mrs. Reynolds looking anywhere but at my face when she brought me back to the Agency, telling Miss Miranda she\u2019d tried but I didn\u2019t know how to fit in and I was riling up the animals and after all, they\u2019d been there first. Not even the day I woke up in the Agency with a throbbing skull and a big ol\u2019 hole of nothing in my head and Miss Miranda telling me I was eight years old and my parents were dead but I\u2019d get a new family by the time I turned ten if I just tried hard enough. Not one goddamned thing.\n I got back after curfew. Miss Miranda gave me a lecture about rules and responsibilities over the pounding in my head\u2014a small physical reminder of the way we expect you to behave here, she said, smiling down at me. I hope I won\u2019t have to speak to you about this again.\n At least the pain made it easy enough to ignore everyone once I was off the elevator. Flash rushed up to find out where I went off to and if I did anything fun, Whispers told stories about my day to her make-believe friends, and Princess acted like the back wall was the most interesting thing in the room. Took her half an hour to slink her way over to where I sat on the edge of my bed in the fourth row, swinging my feet in the air and ignoring every one of Flash\u2019s ten thousand questions. Her hair hung down in her face again, like on her very first day, and she looked like one of those trained puppies the homeless men use for begging, ready to pant and collapse at your feet the minute you look like you\u2019ve got a few credits to spare.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. She sat on the floor in front of my feet like she thought I wouldn\u2019t kick her. \u201cDidn\u2019t realize the way things went around here.\u201d\n I shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re new.\u201d Even though it wasn\u2019t. Anything to get her to shut it and go away. But of course Princess was too sour milk to get any hints, just kept sitting there and staring and asking stupid things.\n \u201cHow long you been here, anyway?\u201d\n \u201cSix years. More or less. Agency said they got a bunch of us after the last big quake.\u201d\n \u201cA bunch? They on another floor we can\u2019t go to?\u201d\n \u201cNah. They all got kept by fosters whose kids got smashed up or killed same as our parents,\u201d Flash said. \u201cEverybody but us lifers and the lucky ones.\u201d\n \u201cLucky ones?\u201d Princess\u2019 face stayed scrunched.\n \u201cThe ones who got old and got out. Hit eighteen, got their memories, never looked back.\u201d\n \u201cGot their memories from where?\u201d Princess asked. Flash rolled her eyes.\n \u201cFrom wherever they fucking keep them after Processing,\u201d she said. \u201cHurts like a bitch when they rip the \u2019grams out, too. Like someone stabbing you through your eye. \u2019Course they let you remember that part. Fucking Agency.\u201d\n \u201cIt only hurts for a minute, wuss,\u201d I said, sticking my tongue out at Flash. Normally I wouldn\u2019t dare, but one of the good things about the way she looked at Princess, like some puppy she half-wanted to cuddle, half-wanted to kick, was that she didn\u2019t have so much nasty left for the rest of us.\n \u201cSo how come I remember everything?\u201d Princess asked, like there was any way we\u2019d know.\n \u201cThey probably screwed up,\u201d Flash said. \u201cOr you\u2019re an Agency spy. Or your brain\u2019s so weak that it would mind-wipe you altogether.\u201d She pointed over at Whispers, who was playing with her fingers like she\u2019d never seen them before.\n \u201cYou wish,\u201d said Princess, flipping her hair in Flash\u2019s general direction like she was trying to get killed. Flash ignored it. She really was getting soft.\n \u201cOnly way to find out is to get into Miss Miranda\u2019s files,\u201d Flash said. \u201cShe\u2019s got \u2019em all locked up down in the office on cube drives or something. Right, Whispers?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m just supposed to clean the office,\u201d Whispers said, to nobody in particular.\n \u201cFine.\u201d Flash walked over to Whispers\u2019 corner of the room to get her attention. \u201cSimple question. You ever see a whole bunch of little glowy cubes in a drawer or something?\u201d\n \u201cLeave her be, Flash,\u201d I said. My head still hurt from Miss Miranda\u2019s warning, and nothing got Whispers shrieking louder than getting too comfortable over in her corner of the room. The first time, she\u2019d hollered for a good hour \u2019til the Agency folks figured she wasn\u2019t gonna stop, but even now it took about ten minutes before she got dragged down to the medic and brought back passed out cold.\n \u201cI\u2019m just asking a question, Ghost,\u201d Flash said, leaning against the wall near Whispers\u2019 bed. \u201cC\u2019mon, Whispers. I promise I\u2019ll leave you alone if you tell.\u201d\n \u201cThe memories aren\u2019t in the office,\u201d Whispers said. \u201cThey\u2019re in the cloud.\u201d I felt my cheeks get a little hot. Stupid. I was supposed to be the big bad hacker; I should\u2019ve guessed.\n \u201cThat means we can get \u2019em with the computers up here, right Ghost?\u201d Flash asked. \u201cLike you did when you got the booze-flavored candy?\u201d\n \u201cThat was before they added all kinds of security,\u201d I said.\n \u201cSo you can\u2019t get in?\u201d\n \u201cDidn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n \u201cThen shut up and do it already,\u201d Flash said. \u201cI want to know why she gets to hold on to all her stupid little \u2019grams and they won\u2019t let us remember shit \u2019til we get out of here.\u201d\n \u201cCan\u2019t tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna be watching the floor.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, \u2019cause you decided you had to come in late, and for no good reason either. Didn\u2019t even bring us shit.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault,\u201d Princess said, still lounging on the floor near my bed. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna be looking close for a couple days. We\u2019ll have to try another time.\u201d\n \u201cOr we could just distract \u2019em,\u201d Flash said. Then she went and sat down, right on the edge of Whispers\u2019 bed.\n It took fifteen minutes of screams that I could feel all the way back behind my eyeballs, but eventually one of the overnight Agency guys, the one Flash thought had nice hair, came up and dragged Whispers away.\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d I started.\n \u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Flash said, shrugging. \u201cJust do it already. Before they finish drugging her up.\u201d\n I looked at Princess, but she just flipped her hair again and walked over to the computers. She had a little more hot sauce in her than I thought. Couldn\u2019t tell yet if that was a good thing.\n \u201cGo \u2019head,\u201d Flash said. \u201cThought you were supposed to be some kind of super-hacker.\u201d\n My head was still throbbing, worse than ever, and I knew Flash was just trying to get to me, but truth was truth. I sat down and got to typing\u2014no way the Agency would spring for touch screens or one of those fancy robot lady voices\u2014and was in quicker than I thought. Miss Miranda had locked down all the \u201cbad influence\u201d stuff pretty tight, but getting the Agency files wasn\u2019t much harder than getting the cam feed from downstairs and watching the babies play.\n \u201cBrenda Nevins,\u201d I read from the screen. \u201cResident at the Agency for the Care of Unassociated Female Minors.\u201d\n \u201cBlah blah blah,\u201d said Flash from across the room. She was on lookout by the elevator for when Mr. Nice Hair came back with Whispers. \u201cGet to the good stuff.\u201d\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything really,\u201d I said. \u201cJust a bunch of big words.\u201d The whole thing was reports and warnings and psychology mumbo-jumbo. Nothing \u2019til I got down to the engrams section. It was a list of \u2019grams with titles like Discovery of Father\u2019s Body and Trip to Percy Park on May 7th. I recognized a couple from in the booth earlier, but most I\u2019d never even heard of, and just about all of them had the same big bold flashing letters on the far right. Not to Be Removed. See Explanation.\n \u201c\u2018Explanation,\u2019\u201d Princess read from over my shoulder, finger tracing along the screen like some little kid trying to figure out how words work. \u201c\u2018To date, Miss Nevins has shown none of the aberrant or destructive behavior of many of the Agency\u2019s other older residents. As the trauma from the loss of her father has not led her to behave negatively, we recommend that she be able to keep the majority of her memories at this time. Moreover, it can be noted that Agency resident Becky Ann Ross has shown no significant behavioral improvement since memory removal, and it is possible that the procedure itself had a negative impact on the development of Samantha Lee, leaving her prone to delusions and outbursts. While Destiny Ward has demonstrated some positive behavior changes and remains difficult to place primarily due an unfortunate lack of demand, a better form of control therapy than memory removal may need to be implemented in the future.\u2019\u201d Princess faked her way through most of the big words and probably wasn\u2019t saying half of them right, but I knew what \u201clack of demand\u201d meant.\n \u201cDestiny? That\u2019s you?\u201d Princess asked. I shut down the machine and pushed her out of my way as I headed back to my bed. She followed. Of course.\n \u201cYou\u2019re Destiny Ward,\u201d she said again, right behind my ear. \u201cRight?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m Ghost, you fucking idiot,\u201d I said. Ghost who was too old and too ugly to be in demand. Ghost who didn\u2019t smile right, who dogs couldn\u2019t help but want to kill. Ghost who had a hole in her mind instead of whatever it was that would get Princess and all those little first-floor babies and second-floor sweethearts tried out and kept by fosters, far away from the damn third floor. Ghost who knew how to fix it.\n I got up from the bed so fast that Princess jumped back a good foot. Even Flash flinched a little bit over by the elevator. Fuck the Agency; I could find my \u2019grams right now, maybe even get them put back in early. There were people who would do that if you paid them well enough. I was a hacker; I could figure it out.\n I got back into my file and scrolled down. Visit to the Ferris Wheel with Parents, Earthquake and Aftermath, Petty Larceny #1,2,3.\n And in the rightmost column of each\u2014Permanently Deleted. Not held for safe-keeping until you can integrate them into adult life. Not get them back when you turn eighteen. Just gone. Totally and forever gone.\n I picked up the stupid machine to throw it down on the floor, break it open like a water balloon, but Princess caught my arm.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell I want,\u201d I said, brushing her off and heading over to the elevator. \u201cAgency lied to us, Flash. They fucking lied. They took all our memories and said they were giving them back but they\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShut it,\u201d Flash said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming up.\u201d\n She was right. I could hear the whirring of the gears as the elevator climbed. This time of night, Agency bastards would want us all lying down. Proper bedtime protocol and all that bullshit. Leave us flat on our backs while they told us their lies.\n I got back to my bed just in time for Mr. Nice Hair to step off, carrying Whispers in his arms. He put her down on the closest bed, nowhere near her little corner, which was how I knew she was really knocked out. Otherwise she would\u2019ve started screaming all over again. Then he turned around and left without a word. Just like Miss Miranda. No time for the third-floor rejects. We probably wouldn\u2019t remember it anyway.\n \u201cLet\u2019s move her back,\u201d said Flash. Nobody moved. \u201cYou want her to start up again when she wakes up?\u201d\n I didn\u2019t care what the hell happened when she woke up, but I didn\u2019t feel like fighting. I grabbed her bony ankles while Flash took hold of her arms and Princess kept a hand under her back. Once she was passed out on her own bed, legs sprawled one way and arms another, mouth hanging open like she was a clown in a carnival game, Flash patted me on the arm. If it had been Princess, I probably would have slapped her in the face, but instead I turned my face away.\n \u201cThey really wipe our stuff completely?\u201d she asked. I nodded. \u201cNo way to hack it back?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t think so.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Princess said. When I didn\u2019t answer, she crept over to her bed and laid down, her head thudding onto the hard pillow. Flash didn\u2019t move. Just leaned in close so her mouth was right by my ear.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d she said. Her voice turned from whisper to giggle.\n I could almost smell the hot sauce in the air.\n \u201cWanna go to the booth again?\u201d I asked Princess a few days later, after school. She looked at me and nodded like I\u2019d asked if she wanted a million bucks. With me giving her the silent treatment, all she\u2019d had to talk to was Flash and Whispers, and that wasn\u2019t much to live on.\n \u201cIs it gonna make you mad again?\u201d she asked, her face back in that little half-scrunch.\n \u201cNah, I\u2019m over it,\u201d I said. \u201cPlus, I figured out how to share something real. You\u2019re looking at an A-plus hacker, remember?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d She smiled bright for the rest of the walk over to the booth. I nodded at the front desk guy as we came in, sent a whole mess of credits his way.\n \u201cBreak time, right?\u201d I said. He just raised his chin in a half-nod, then looked over at Princess\u2019s shirt like he could see through the fabric. She caught on quick and bent over again, enough for him to smile and head off. Then she went straight for the side-by-sides.\n \u201cYou coming, right?\u201d she said.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cGo ahead and strap in. I have to hack something back here for this to work.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Princess put on the headphones and straps and all that. The goggles covered her eyes up tight, but I turned the booth lights off too, made sure she couldn\u2019t see Flash tiptoeing in.\n I called up one of the memories on the list I\u2019d pulled from the Agency. Brenda and her Father at her fifth birthday.\n \u201cHey,\u201d Princess said, \u201cSomething\u2019s off. This is one of mine.\u201d\n \u201cNot anymore,\u201d I said. Her body jerked up as my code hit the booth and she clutched her head like someone was knifing her in the eye. Princess screamed and tried to tear the straps off, to run away, but Flash held her arms down, giggling under her breath. I\u2019d offered her a few credits to help out, but some things Flash would do for free.\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Flash\u2019s hands tightened against Princess\u2019 arms as Princess\u2019 hair flipped back and forth. \u201cIt only hurts for a minute. You\u2019ll barely remember.\u201d\n When the twitching and moaning stopped, we unhooked Princess from the booth and Flash walked her out, steadying her like she was an old drunk. I told Flash I\u2019d be along soon, that I needed to check everything was clear so we wouldn\u2019t get caught. But after she was out of sight, I went in for a half hour in my own booth instead. Any good thief\u2019s gotta check the merchandise. Plus I didn\u2019t like looking at Princess all limp and sad, worse than sour milk even. That was more of a Flash kinda thing. She\u2019d said I should erase every memory Princess had forever, put us all on even ground, but I didn\u2019t want to be that way about it. I was gonna give Princess the memories back at eighteen anyway. Sooner, maybe. Once I was living with a foster in some big house with nice kids and no dogs.\n Princess was long-haired and cinnamon pretty; she\u2019d find a foster with her memories or not. Just like Hope and the rest. Just like I was gonna. With Princess\u2019 memories filling up that hole in my head, I\u2019d be set. I\u2019d know just how to smile with the fosters and laugh and make \u2019em like me\u2014even if I didn\u2019t fit in the pictures, I\u2019d know how to be part of a family. I\u2019d smell like cinnamon and honey and babies and home.\n I cued up the first string of memories in watch mode, so I wouldn\u2019t get too caught up in the share \u2019til I found the right ones. I could tell Princess was a little girl right away \u2019cause of how big everyone looked through her eyes, like friendly giants. There were tons of them, coming and going and bringing her things, but only two were really important\u2014Mom and Dad, happy and smiling. I tried smiling back, giggling like she giggled when Dad picked her up to pretend fly or when Mom played peekaboo. But I couldn\u2019t get the feel of it right without going all the way in. I could hear myself through the earplugs, a high-pitched cross between a scream and the hiccups. I needed something better.\n I skipped through the memories, playing a few seconds if something looked good and then moving on, looking for something like the ones that Princess had showed me before, the ones that made my hand shake and my breath skip.\n But all I saw was how, each time I stopped, there were half as many people, that the presents were gone and then the toys too, that the rooms were smaller and dingier, that Mom left on a rainy day and never came back, that Princess didn\u2019t seem to care. She still had her Daddy and he always always held her tightly, close enough that even on watch I could smell the liquor on his breath\u2014just like those booze pops I\u2019d ordered. I still felt a little of the way she\u2019d felt when he called her Brenda, all lit up from inside like candles on a birthday cake, but this time I wasn\u2019t swept up in the share\u2014she was just some sad little girl wearing grimy clothes, living in a dirty room with an old man who finally died in a rocking chair. Some girl who leaned over and let a perv at a front counter see down her shirt. Some girl too dumb to figure out her own stupid memories.\n I left the booth before the half hour was up, still trying to get the stink of Princess\u2019 dirty life out of my nose. Pervy was back on duty and waved me over from the front counter as I passed by.\n \u201cYour friend gonna be alright?\u201d he said. \u201cSeems like a sweet girl.\u201d He licked his skinny lips and I had to try not to shiver. Princess would end up swapping more than \u2019grams with him one of these days.\n \u201cLeave her alone,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI\u2019m just a concerned citizen.\u201d He lifted a bushy eyebrow in a way that was probably supposed to make me feel something. \u201cMaybe I should be concerned about what you were doing during my break.\u201d\n \u201cJust making a back up,\u201d I said. \u201cIn case there\u2019s another quake or she gets hit by a truck or something.\u201d Pervy leaned forward a little.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got an extra,\u201d I said. \u201cYou want it?\u201d\n Pervy had his hands out before I could blink. They looked pale and clammy, like a piece of gum stuck under a chair too long. I fished the cube with Princess\u2019 memories out of my pocket. It was the only one I had, but she\u2019d be better off without it. Who wants to find out at eighteen that their life has been so fucking pathetic? Screw having something real.\n \u201cI give you this, you leave her alone, alright?\u201d\n Pervy nodded. I handed the cube over, making sure not to touch his sweaty hands. Fifty-fifty chance he\u2019d try to pull some double-cross, but if I needed to, I could take care of his memories as easy as I had Princess\u2019, so I just smiled and walked out. Can\u2019t hurt somebody you can\u2019t remember.\n This time, I made curfew. I could tell by the way Miss Miranda stared me down that she couldn\u2019t wait to have some reason to give me punishment, but she was gonna have to. I smiled right at her and headed up to the third floor like I had a mouth full of cotton candy. Soon as I got off the elevator I saw Princess lying in the bed she liked, hair spread out on the pillow like a pool of old soda. Flash sprang up soon as she saw me, with that big smile she got like she was either gonna hug you or eat you.\n \u201cIt\u2019s all gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAll that shit about her daddy and her perfect life? Wiped just like if the Agency got her.\u201d\n I smiled back, but it felt weird, like baring fangs.\n \u201cI thought you were bullshitting about the hacking part, but you give good, Ghost,\u201d Flash said. \u201cMaybe next you can reboot Whispers so she won\u2019t talk so damn much, right? Or creep up on Miss Miranda and take everything she\u2019s got?\u201d She laughed hard, and I knew not to tell her anything about how it really was with Princess, \u2019cause then she\u2019d be mad I gave all the good stuff away.\n \u201cThe rest of her okay?\u201d I said, like I didn\u2019t care too much really.\n \u201cYeah, she\u2019s good. Not like Whispers or anything. Just less annoying. Cuter too.\u201d Flash glanced over at Princess like she was sizing her up in a prize booth at a fair.\n \u201cYeah, but fosters\u2019ll probably get her soon.\u201d She\u2019d be fine. Just like Hope. Better than her memories.\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d Flash said, \u201cIf she figures out how to keep her mouth shut.\u201d\n \u201cFifty credits says she\u2019s gone in a month.\u201d\n Flash shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s not that cute.\u201d\n \u201cYou said that with Hope.\u201d I shrugged and hoped my palms wouldn\u2019t be too sweaty.\n \u201cFine.\u201d Flash grabbed my hand tight with her cold one. \u201cBut make it sixty. And when she starts blabbermouthing again, I\u2019m gonna laugh at the both of you.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I said, and started over for Princess. I thought Flash might follow, but she just went back to practicing whistles like always. Princess wasn\u2019t doing much, didn\u2019t even look at me as I walked over and sat down right by her ear. Just stared up at the ceiling like any other new girl who got wiped and dumped on the third floor. Sour milk squared. But that was okay. You didn\u2019t have to stay a sour milk girl forever.\n \u201cI\u2019m Ghost,\u201d I said, low and quiet so only she could hear. \u201cYou know Flash and Whispers. And we call you Princess, but your daddy, he called you Brenda.\u201d\n Erin Roberts is a writer and communications consultant who somehow found a way to be a storyteller when she grew up.

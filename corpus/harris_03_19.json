Steam-powered mini-dirigibles issuing directives from the Governor\u2019s Palace traveled from quarter to quarter every afternoon. Every seventh-day or so, klaxons wailed while the dirigibles advised them it was a test. Despite this, stray pockets of celebration happened every now and then but it was hard to tell if celebrants were for or against the central Dvenri government. Even the Governor was busy holding her own balls and soirees.\n \u201cThis war will not be fought on battlefields,\u201d Liannell the florist said to Raneka, even as they argued about whether yellow or white peacock flowers would best augment the calla lilies selected for Raneka\u2019s dinner party.\n \u201cWhy would we need to fight a war at all, and if not on a battlefield, how will the war be fought? With floral arrangements?\u201d Raneka had asked in bemusement.\n \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Liannell with sparkling eyes, even as she perused the seating charts Raneka had provided her.\n Liannell had wanted of Raneka the same thing that the candlemaker had wanted, and the table-linen merchant, and the wine-merchant. It had been a difficult day in which Raneka had received far more information than she\u2019d expected, from the remnants of an insurrectionist\u2019s past that she had left behind. It was made far more difficult by the muted atmosphere of panic and a near-manic euphoria. She\u2019d seen a couple rutting in a laneway, oblivious to bystanders placing ribald bets in tin cups filled with paper money. She\u2019d seen two men shoot each other in the head. On her way back, she had observed in shock as another man flung himself from the clock tower of the University down towards the cobblestoned pavement below. He had shouted to a horrified audience that the world was ending because the war was coming. And then he had spread his arms as though to fly.\n Shaken, Raneka had fled the scene, her heart beating like a caged bird as she half-ran towards the Upper Residential Quarter where sunlight scraped the undersides of buildings as the day ebbed into a night of no moon. Her shoulder blades itched with the presentiment that she was being followed. Her heart skipped several beats, causing a breathlessness that had become a part of her life for too long. Nevertheless, she had remained unmolested. She made a note to send a factor out the next day in search of a bodyguard or two. They were right\u2014she was in need of protection, and she hated that thought.\n The smoothly swooping road of the cul-de-sac was becoming a familiar sight. She sobbed with relief at the sight of the four-storeyed negligible refuge of her grandfather\u2019s house. Her house now. This house was not a house best suited for one who had been living in an apartment in the Civil Quarters of the city\u2014a small two-room affair that could barely fit into one of the closets in her grandfather\u2019s house. Here, the furniture loomed like huge teakwood machines that had been carved with painful precision. They all seemed rather painfully anthropomorphic as though they would be able to walk across the room at any given moment to tap her on the shoulder. It reminded her that her grandfather had run away from this very house to live in a hut put together out of woven and treated ganggas leaves. A hut her parents had left her in when they\u2019d run away to join the counterrevolutionary rebellion in the North. A hut in which she learned she had been orphaned and that her parents were warriors, or criminals depending on who you asked.\n During her university days she\u2019d been wrought with fear that the infamous dark-robed inquisitors of the Governor\u2019s secret cabinet would pull her away for questioning. Every now and then she thought she\u2019d spotted them in crowded lecture halls. Phantasms and fears born of anxiety, she\u2019d assured herself over the years. To be safe, she put away every single thought of hers that was even a modicum of revolutionary. She stopped visiting her grandfather. She renounced his rebellion. She joined first the government training scheme after graduation and then became a civil servant in the Dvenri government. She thought it would keep her safe. And so it did. But she didn\u2019t feel so safe now. And so she spent money like it was water, and acted like a newly anointed heiress was expected to behave. Members of her more respectable family might view her excesses with scorn but she suspected they were also relieved that she was so colorless, and that she seemed more inclined towards spending her grandfather\u2019s accumulated and untouched wealth rather than following in her grandfather\u2019s footsteps.\n The doorbell rang. \u201cShall I get that, Dahshani?\u201d asked Jarold, the footman.\n \u201cPlease. Send them away, whoever they are. I have a headache,\u201d she said.\n She moved towards the chaise lounge and started opening the piles of sealed letters that had been on the side table in the marbled foyer of the town house. From the front door she heard the sound of masculine voices raised in argument. Then there was a scuffling sound. Then silence. Raneka frowned, and stood up. The door to her drawing room slammed open and three black-robed government inquisitors walked in. They looked oddly familiar. Correction. They looked entirely too familiar. Her head started to throb.\n They had been with her for years.\n \u201cDahshani Raneka. I believe you know who we are. You\u2019ve been very good for years, a very good little mouse. You\u2019ve been so very good, right up till today.\u201d\n Hand raised to her throat, Raneka said, \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been consorting with known dissidents, Dahshani.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve merely been buying flowers, draperies, silverware, and other accoutrements for my dinner party,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYes, we\u2019ve taken into account that they accosted you, rather than the other way round. Which is why there\u2019s a way out of your current predicament, Dahshani,\u201d said the third man.\n \u201cAnd what would that way out be?\u201d asked Raneka.\n \u201cWrite us an invitation to your dinner party. All three of us. We will monitor what is happening, and all you need to do is be a good hostess,\u201d said the third man who looked her up and down in a very familiar manner. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve a list of other merchants you need to visit tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cVery well. I will have extra food ordered,\u201d said Raneka, who faked a calm she did not feel as the rest of what they were saying seemed to float in the air beyond her ability to comprehend.\n She strode to her wall-desk, pulling out more gilt-edged invitations. \u201cIf I may get your names to write three invitations?\u201d\n \u201cPlease, do not waste resources on our food. We don\u2019t eat much\u2014we don\u2019t need to,\u201d said the third man whose eyes gleamed in that same alien way that told her they didn\u2019t need much that most humans did. There\u2019d been rumors about these secret cabinet members for years. Rumors whispered about at night to frighten children. That they were not human, but one of the beta tribes who\u2019d been crossbred by Dvenri alchemists to create the ultimate government agents. Not as strong as purebred Llen, and far more biddable to the Dvenri cause.\n \u201cAnd you can make out just one invitation card to Messrs, Red, Brown, and White.\u201d\n Raneka gave all three of them dubious looks, but did as they\u2019d asked. \u201cI assume you\u2019re Mr. White, then?\u201d she asked of the third man.\n He laughed. \u201cActually, Mr. Brown. As usual, you will not remember we\u2019ve conversed after we\u2019ve left.\u201d\n Mr. Brown palmed the invitation and gently grazed the back of her hand. She shuddered in reflex. How many times had this happened? How many times had she forgotten them?\n \u201cOh, and Jarold will be as good as new in the morning. As always. We always reset our mice,\u201d said the second black-robed man.\n \u201cDon\u2019t look so petrified, Dahshani. We\u2019ve never touched you beyond this,\u201d said Mr. Brown as his finger grazed her skin once more. \u201cOur employer would be very displeased if we manhandled even nobility who have indulged in counterinsurgencies. And you\u2019ve been so very good. Too good, very obedient,\u201d he said.\n There was much that was implicit. It was a gentle threat that caused her skin to crawl. She resisted the urge to gag.\n They pulled her toward the chaise lounge and placed her there. \u201cYou will be very sleepy now, my dear. When you wake up, you may return to your preparations for the biggest dinner party of the season. You now know who you should visit, don\u2019t you? You will be so very good, once you\u2019re reset. A list of people to visit will be on your desk,\u201d said the first man, the one she now drowsily remembered was Mr. White.\n \u201cYes, she will be far more useful to us now that she\u2019s quit from the government,\u201d said Mr. Red.\n \u201cThat was a brilliant masterstroke, suggesting she\u2019d resign,\u201d answered Mr. Brown.\n \u201cShe\u2019s always been so very obedient, this little mouse of us,\u201d laughed one of them, or was it all of them?\n \u201cToo obedient. No chance for sport,\u201d said Mr. Brown again.\n If she ever had a chance, she\u2019d rip his face off with a fork, she thought.\n Oblivion claimed her.\n The Braided Lion Cloth Emporium was run by a family who had received the Imperial Writ from the Governors of Serolar for decades. Their fame showed in the elaborate architecture of the storefront with its ornate carved panels, floral mosaicked tiles and the wood carvings on the main doors. Within, the textiles that hung from the wall of the shop flowed like a waterfall of colors from some railings while others in earthy hues dangled like lianas from branches of fern-encrusted trees that thrust upwards from the undergrowth of the Serol Forest. At the memory of the forest, of another lifetime from this one, Raneka choked in sudden grief as she meandered through aisles crammed with boles of cloth like colorful tree trunks. Vibrant reds, blues that shimmered like the Tere-Ora Ocean, ambers, greens and textured gold like the mage-lions of Serolar. Raneka caressed rich silk embroidered with silver stars and spirals that soothed the eyes with her dark golden brown fingers, rubbing her calluses over the stars, feeling the imprint as though she was trying to bring constellations into her being. She inhaled the scent of fresh textiles that seemed to bring her back to her youth when she\u2019d climbed the trees of the Serol Forest to collect the fungi that lived in a parasitical relationship with the raincaller trees. Her grandfather would use the fungi to brew a drink that allowed rogue neithyrs to confer with other neithyrs through means that were not crystal-bestowed. In her youth, the forest was the safest place for her, while hostilities raged between the order of Holy Neithyrs and the armies of the Dvenri Empire.\n Sometimes, she thought of the heedless opulence she had stockpiled for the dinner party, and she cringed inwardly. Crystal glasses had been bought, the best porcelain from the Ruma\u2019i isles, Lusini butter\u2014not celestial and not as deadly as those whispered about in folklore and horror stories. Meat from Mirozkh sheep farms, and vegetables harvested from underwater farms deep within Lake Llendrys, adjuncts to the underwater kingdom of the aquatic Llen. And now here she was, in search of the perfect cloth to make an evening gown fit for an unexpected heiress. Except, the party was tomorrow night, and she did not know if it was even possible to make a gown within a day. Oh grandfather, Raneka whispered to herself as she had on too many occasions. Why did you not tell me? Why did you lead me to discover and inherit all this only now, when I have no idea what to do with this legacy of yours?\n She choked back on unwelcome feelings as she palmed a rich, velvet fabric with a tapestry weave of deep burgundy, bronze, and navy blue. It was exquisite.\n \u201cThis is lovely but won\u2019t be comfortable in our weather,\u201d advised a soignee woman who swooped in from beneath a curtain of fabric to address her. She was large, both in frame and in height; her abundant curves were enhanced rather than concealed by the stark lines of the dramatically elegant gown she wore.\n \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d challenged Raneka, sure that the woman assumed that she couldn\u2019t afford the fabric. She bristled the defensive bristle of one who had worn cheap synthetic weaves from Dvenri textile machines for the entirety of her adult life in the city.\n \u201cBecause I made a caftan from another bolt and it was so itchy my skin broke out in rashes?\u201d asked the woman.\n Her grin, Raneka decided, was so affable it would have melted the most dyed-in-the-wool curmudgeon.\n The woman held out her hand to Raneka, \u201cI\u2019m Dahshani Infarre. I see you\u2019re not attended. Come to the back and I\u2019ll show you some of the newer material!\u201d\n Raneka took Infarre\u2019s hand and shook it, drawn to the woman\u2019s confident warmth. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll follow you. Do you own this emporium?\u201d she asked.\n Infarre chuckled. \u201cMy family owns the company that runs this chain of emporiums, yes. As for me, I merely manage the main branch.\u201d\n There were volumes that Infarre managed to convey in her statement as she walked in aggressive yet intrinsically feminine strides across the emporium. Raneka touched bolts of cloth as they walked through the showroom. Silk, satin, gossamer, georgette, woolen weaves from Mirozkh, and more exotic printed cloth from the archipelagos. Once, she could only dream of affording these textiles.\n Towards the back of the vast showroom, Infarre beckoned her through the open doorway, wide enough that five Verconian palanquins could park side-by-side. An exquisitely garbed man ambled towards them. Tall and lanky, he was dressed in tights embroidered in fractal loops, and a heavily bejeweled bolero that left his torso bare. Modesty did not seem this man\u2019s suit. His hair was puffed up upon his head, his face clean-shaven and his spectacle frames bejeweled to match his bolero.\n \u201cAaah, the new heiress herself!\u201d he exclaimed with mock pomp as he executed a bow.\n \u201cShush, Acquasar, don\u2019t tease her,\u201d said Infarre with a warning look at the man.\n Raneka was immediately defensive, the fear that had dogged her since she gained her inheritance doubling, causing her to pale. She made to run, but the all-too-familiar breathlessness gave her pause. One skipped beat. Two, three. And then her heart settled on a regular rhythm again. She breathed in air like she\u2019d never breathed it before. She counted to ten.\n \u201cAre you quite alright, love?\u201d asked Infarre with some concern.\n \u201cAnxiety, I think,\u201d said Acquasar. \u201cI recognize it well.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I know you do,\u201d Infarre said with a soft voice. They exchanged glances. She said. \u201cLet\u2019s bring her to my office. She could be dehydrated. And we can talk there in peace.\u201d\n Raneka stiffened again at the volumes Infarre managed to lace into her words. It was a skill she would have to pick up, she thought. The elite of the city played too many political games and she\u2019d managed to sidestep at least two dozen since it became known that she was a Mirozhi heiress.\n \u201cI hope we\u2019re just looking at textiles,\u201d Raneka said.\n \u201cWell, mostly textiles,\u201d Infarre qualified as they walked into her spacious office with fine mahogany furniture.\n Acquasar walked directly to a carved wooden door with the confidence of familiarity, opening it to reveal a cooling box, the contents lit up by the cooling crystals that lined the sides and top of the box. He pulled out a glass bottle filled with water and a bowl of fresh strawberries.\n \u201cWhere\u2019d you put the lemons, Infarre?\u201d he asked as he stuck his head in the icebox.\n \u201cBehind the chocolates,\u201d Infarre said as she led Raneka to a comfortable chaise lounge.\n \u201cYou must forgive Dahshan Acquasar, he can be so very gauche despite his station. But as you may have already discerned, we were quite pleased you decided to visit one of our shops. We would have met with you at some point, but this is far more efficacious. We have.\u201d Infarre paused, hesitated even.\n \u201cWe have things to discuss. About your grandfather.\u201d\n Raneka knew what both Acquasar and Infarre wanted from her. It seemed like almost all the merchants she\u2019d visited had been insurrectionists who\u2019d been trained by her grandfather. She wondered why.\n \u201cNo,\u201d Raneka said in even tones that brooked no nonsense. Authority was new to her but she had learned to be comfortable with it, like a ball gown that was ill-fitting at first but which sagged and softened into one\u2019s curves and angles as the night wore on.\n Infarre and Acquasar exchanged glances. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even said anything yet.\u201d\n \u201cI am not my grandfather; and I will not help you,\u201d she said firmly.\n \u201cWe thought that after you resigned from your government job you would surely . . . \u201d began Acquasar but then he stopped, disappointment etched on his patrician features.\n \u201cYour stupid resistance has cost me my parents, my grandfather, and everything I loved. The Dvenri were hostages for centuries. Centuries! Of your glorious Yroi Empire. Why should I help you? For that matter, why should I care for either of you? I\u2019m Mirozhi\u2014and I\u2019m not as idealistic as my grandfather was,\u201d said Raneka, heat entering her voice\u2014surprising and alarming herself.\n \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d Infarre asked.\n Her tones were mild while her eyes contemplated Raneka like she was a new bolt of cloth with a perplexing pattern. \u201cDo you think we all do this because of idealism? I\u2019m Dvenri\u2014in case you haven\u2019t noticed. As is Acquasar. We\u2019ve nary enough Dvenri blood between us to make a gruesome cocktail for blood-drinkers.\u201d\n \u201cBesides, bloody cocktails are far too cavalier for my taste,\u201d said Acquasar, who expertly measured and decanted liquors into three tall glasses before adding chopped fruits and herbs. He handed her a cocktail decorated with strawberry wedges she\u2019d watch him chop daintily on Infarre\u2019s sideboard, the ice cubes clinking in the tall glass.\n Raneka shrugged as she accepted the drink, \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business.\u201d\n She sipped on the drink with some relief as the cool liquid slid down her throat.\n \u201cAre you sure? Are you sure you do not want to know how corrupt and how\u2014disturbed our current Governor is? Never mind the entire Empire. Just consider our little city-state. Pay attention today. Pay attention tomorrow night as you host your little soiree. To which we\u2019re invited, in case you hadn\u2019t realized.\u201d\n Raneka inhaled. Of course. They were of two of the most prominent Dvenri families in the city\u2014of course they\u2019d been invited.\n \u201cCan you promise us that much?\u201d asked Acquasar with a gentleness that Raneka found intimidating rather than reassuring.\n \u201cI can\u2019t promise what I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Raneka, defensive once again.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you if the need arises. Now,\u201d Infarre said, briskly. \u201cWhat was it you wanted for your dinner party?\u201d\n \u201cCloth to be turned into a gown,\u201d said Raneka, nervous and abashed at her confession.\n \u201cDarling, your party is tomorrow! Who do you think would be able to make a gown within a day?\u201d Acquasar stared at her with a kind of horrified fascination as though she\u2019d declared she\u2019d be daubing herself with cow dung as raiment.\n \u201cI\u2019d completely forgotten about the gown until this morning,\u201d Raneka pulled the confession out, something that had embarrassed her to no end when she woke up that morning.\n Infarre said, \u201cWould you be content with one-of-a-kind ready-made gowns that no one has seen, let alone worn?\u201d\n \u201cReady-made gowns that no one has seen? How is this possible?\u201d asked Raneka.\n \u201cDesigning is a . . . well, some would say it\u2019s a hobby of mine, but I\u2019ve never really shown anyone apart from Acquasar,\u201d Infarre answered, her tone matter-of-fact rather than shy.\n \u201cAnd they\u2019re brilliant. I keep telling her she should sell them, but no, it\u2019s art! You should take her up on the offer\u2014it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s allowed it,\u201d said Acquasar, who sounded very proud of Infarre, and ridiculously fond.\n Raneka said, \u201cYes, I\u2019d love to see your designs.\u201d\n Infarre\u2019s eyes warmed as though she\u2019d been given a gift. As they walked into another room, Raneka\u2019s eyes were agog at the exquisite creations hanging from the wall.\n \u201cThey\u2019re marvelous,\u201d breathed Raneka in wonder.\n \u201cShe\u2019s marvelous,\u201d said Acquasar in a tone of unmasked adoration.\n \u201cStop it, both of you,\u201d said Infarre with profound embarrassment. \u201cHere, I know you wanted us to say nothing else but could you amuse me for at least two nights with this?\u201d\n She held out what looked like an intricate silver brooch with an emerald cabochon in the middle of it.\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked Raneka suspiciously.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a memory recorder. Wear it on you until the next time we meet. Just put it on now, then press on the cabochon three times. If ever you feel in doubt of your memories, twist the cabochon anticlockwise. Then, come to see us. If you\u2019re scared to do it\u2014don\u2019t twist the cabochon alone. Come see us, and we\u2019ll review your memories together.\u201d\n Infarre gave Raneka the brooch and then squeezed her shoulders comfortingly.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Raneka said.\n \u201cHave you been feeling frightened your whole life?\u201d\n \u201cNo, just since . . . \u201d Raneka looked up, her face blank.\n Infarre and Acquasar gave each other significant looks.\n \u201cThis meeting doesn\u2019t feel random,\u201d said Raneka. None of the meetings felt random. It felt as though she\u2019d been given a list of merchants to visit.\n \u201cOnly think, how did you know to come to this Emporium?\u201d asked Infarre.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . , I\u2019ve heard of your textiles, I suppose.\u201d\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t us; I can tell you that. But things are escalating, and we\u2019re on the verge of war\u2014so the shenanigans by the Government increase,\u201d said Acquasar.\n \u201cIf you think I\u2019m a spy, why are you talking to me anyway?\u201d asked Raneka.\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re an innocent\u2014and because we loved your grandfather. Besides, most of us know you. Don\u2019t you remember us? You were a little girl running about in your grandfather\u2019s hut when he was training both of us,\u201d said Acquasar.\n \u201cThere is so much I don\u2019t remember,\u201d Raneka said, her voice slow. \u201cSo many gaps in how I perceive things. I don\u2019t know when I was last a whole person.\u201d\n Acquasar said, \u201cHard to say how much of that is who you are, and how much of that is what\u2019s been done to you.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s been . . . done to me?\u201d asked Raneka.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Acquasar said, the words dragged out of him like marsh-sludge. \u201cI was a threat, and so they\u2014reset me more than once. Until your grandfather saved me. So now, let us return the favor. They\u2019ll be wanting to trap us at your dinner party. But we have a little trap of our own planned.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Raneka said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Raneka decided then that it was time she started to trust people. It didn\u2019t seem such a bad thing to start with these two strangers.\n Two hours later, Raneka lurched out of the Emporium, half-dizzy with the weight of an obligation she did not want but still tugged by the camaraderie that had grown between the three of them after an afternoon of trying on gowns. She had finally settled on an elegant creation of dove-gray and soft hues of peach, studded with seed-pearls. She had listened to all that Infarre had told her in urgent tones. She fingered the new brooch she now wore affixed to her day gown. The weight of their expectation placed a pall even on what seemed to be a budding friendship. The weight of what she\u2019d been told? Even more so.\n She grew up on conversations of revolution, of strategies for offensives happening in the passes of the Southern Crescent range. Many caravans of the Dvenri were relieved of hostages and goods. Many indentured laborers were subsumed into the underground network created by the neithyrs. Raneka however, had learned her histories. Her grandfather had been a Professor of Lusini history before he decamped for the Serol Forest, leaving his holdings and his business to family members to run.\n She ran back to the city after her last explosive fight with her grandfather. She did not want any of what he was doing. Not a revolution. She wanted a quiet life. She knew from the history books that the Dvenri had been victimized for years by the Yroi. She did not understand why they should side with a dead Empire who had been brutes to all of them: Dvenri, Mirozhi, Lusini.\n \u201cThat was past history, but the evil the Dvenri are creating in the here and now needs to be ended,\u201d her grandfather had said during that final confrontation.\n \u201cI think you\u2019ve become susceptible to neithyr propaganda. I\u2019m not sure what evil you\u2019re talking about. The city\u2019s entirely civilized,\u201d Raneka had replied.\n \u201cI knew it was a mistake sending you to study at the University of Serolar. I should have sent you to Vontessa!\u201d Her grandfather had shaken his fist in the air.\n \u201cI made that decision, grandfather, remember? I made that decision\u2014and the money came from the funds my parents set aside for my studies. Not yours,\u201d she had said, before she\u2019d walked out of his life. And then her grandfather had died and had left her everything. She supposed that was his final volley. One that had taken her into a life she\u2019d left behind.\n She choked back tears at the memory of her grandfather. But she could handle the grief. What she had trouble managing was the rising tide of anxiety that shortened her breath with the niggling sense that there was something that lay just beyond the periphery of her accessible memories as she walked through the familiar streets of the Merchant\u2019s Quarter before she took the Intermediary Avenue towards the Upper Residential Quarter.\n Raneka woke up with a start on her chaise lounge. Something had awakened her, but she was not sure what. She felt a pain on the side of her neck. She sat up. What had happened? She had a migraine, she remembered that much. She had been walking towards her town house. The familiar cul-de-sac greeted her. What happened next?\n Raneka touched the memory recorder, still affixed to the collar of her day gown. Slowly, she forced herself to stand. Infarre said not to turn it alone if she was afraid. She walked over to her desk, and put a hand on the small telecommunications crystal. But was it safe to pass a message through her crystal? The next time she saw Infarre and Acquasar would be at the dinner party. She yawned once, and then three times. She trudged out of her drawing room, towards the staircase, still barely feeling awake. She frightened two of the maids who were slowly turning down the lights.\n \u201cDahshani! We thought you\u2019d sleep through till the morning,\u201d they said.\n \u201cI\u2019m awake, I fear,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I have a hot chocolate brought to my room, please?\u201d\n \u201cWith marshmallows, Dahshani?\u201d asked the younger maid, Litta.\n She smiled, \u201cThat would be marvelous, Litta.\u201d\n In her room, she pulled the brooch off from her day gown before affixing it to her nightgown. She was supposed to hire a lady\u2019s maid to help her dress\u2014that was what the best families did. But Raneka had grown up in a hut, tending to herself in the bushes and cleansing herself in the river. The thought of someone dressing and washing her filled her with revulsion. Ultimately, it was that revulsion that caused her to turn the cabochon anticlockwise.\n The entire night\u2019s encounter returned to her memory. They had accosted her outside of her house, and had walked in with her. Instructions had been given for the delivery of weapons and for the placement of guards.\n She did not have time to process those memories, because the memory recorder had dug itself in deeper into her consciousness. She recalled not just the events of that night. She relived every single encounter with Messrs Red, White, and Brown since she first enrolled in the University of Serolar. She remembered it all. Every session. Every torture. Never anything that left marks. But they had broken her with their Llen tricks. For that was what they were. They were the lake-dwelling Alpha nonhumans who could glide from shape to shape. They\u2019d existed in childhood nightmares and horror stories told to keep them good, amongst a panoply of other bogeys. But they had broken her with their Llen tricks. The Llen were never seen. At least the Arlishya allowed themselves to be sighted. They had been employed by the shadow cabinets of first the Yroi and now the Dvenri because they were so efficient at what they did. They were less likely to perform the misdemeanors humans placed in their position would perform. Small mercies, Raneka thought with a shudder. Small mercies indeed.\n \u201cPress me clockwise,\u201d whispered the crystal to her mind.\n She pressed the crystal until it clicked, and then rotated it clockwise. She felt the healing light of its central crystal flooding her being. She also felt what she\u2019d been avoiding for near two decades. The Great Complect enfolded her consciousness. Infarre was waiting in her astral form, as were other figures that looked all too familiar. Creondi, Thegen, the figures of insurrectionists from her childhood.\n \u201cAre you alright?\u201d was the first concerned question.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be alright again,\u201d said Raneka.\n The astral forms gently guided her towards the thrumming crystal that sat at the apex of their Quadrant of the Great Complect, that grid line of crystalline energy that ran from Living Crystal to Living Crystal. She recognized this glowing golden crystal they called the Grand Lady. Her astral form knelt before it. She allowed the golden energy to enter her. This was not a healing that the thrumming crystal gave her. What it did to her\u2014she would muse later\u2014reconstituted her insides. Some of those memories would never return to her, but she was given other augmentations instead.\n \u201cTell us what you know,\u201d the glowing figure of Infarre said to her.\n \u201cIt will be war, won\u2019t it?\u201d asked Raneka with deep sorrow.\n \u201cIt was always going to be war, because it is what they\u2019ve been pushing,\u201d said Thegen, the old man of the woods.\n Raneka told them what she knew.\n Raneka was garbed for war in a near-luminous dove-gray gown that left one shoulder bare, with several whisper-thin layers cascading to the ground over her bared back. This was not the gown she had chosen when she had been a mouse. This gown was illuminated by an algae-based substance and the illuminations were augmented by the delicately geometric embroidery made with threads dyed with a condensed unguent made of the same algae. The memory recorder and preserver was pinned carefully to the strap that held up her asymmetrical gown on the other shoulder. Within a handbag beaded with weaponized crystals was a bronze fork that she\u2019d spent nearly two hours sharpening.\n Her anxiety had ironically receded on this day, this most dangerous day. She\u2019d been run off her feet chasing different members of the insurrection\u2014watching as they gagged and bundled away agents of the shadow cabinets, watching as bloodstains were efficiently wiped from the floorboards and as walls were quietly painted over. Not a tear did she shed. And her heartbeat remained as regular as the presence of the Grand Lady in her head.\n It had been a difficult day in the household as they had carefully unearthed the weapons that had been brought in while they had all been knocked out by Llen devices. Three dozen efficient members of the catering company walked around, making table arrangements. The florists marched in to place trellises around the room, following Liannell\u2019s precise instructions. She knew what those floral arrangements contained. She knew what had been removed\u2014both the weapons and the members of the staff that had been appointed by the Llen inquisitors.\n \u201cThey\u2019re planning on taking out all of the main players of the insurrection contained within the Dvenri society,\u201d Raneka had told Infarre, Thegen, and the rest of her neithyr network the night before.\n \u201cWell, if it\u2019s fireworks they want, we\u2019ll be more than happy to supply. Apparently the great massacre at the crossroads was not enough for them,\u201d Thegen said, nearly spitting out the words.\n \u201cTry not to destroy my town house too much,\u201d Raneka had responded.\n Now, she watched as her ballroom was transformed into a pristine white wonderland with glistening ice swans and chandeliers with myriad sentient crystals that sang. Calla lilies were woven onto the trellises that soared above carefully positioned tables while crystalline bird-mobiles flew from table to table with dainty hors d\u2019oeuvres, using the same steam-powered technology that powered the Governor\u2019s mini-dirigibles.\n The tables were soon filled with elegant guests while a clockwork string quartet played the Sonatas of the Seven Moons.\n The table next to the windows remained empty. Raneka wondered if her tormenters had decided not to show up in a place with so many witnesses after all. She wondered if they knew how far their plans had been overturned. Her surmise was proven wrong when an hour later, the three dark-robed inquisitors of the shadow cabinet entered. Their presence afflicted the people whom they passed. Eyes grew glassy, lips suddenly required copious amounts of cocktails which the servitors poured liberally. She steeled herself but felt the golden glow of the Grand Lady bolstering her and amplifying her senses from within.\n Raneka touched her memory preserver before she walked up to her tormentors.\n \u201cWelcome,\u201d she said. \u201cMessrs. Red, White, and Brown, I assume? You\u2019re the only names not crossed out on the guest list.\u201d\n \u201cYou assume correctly. How very kind of you to invite us,\u201d said Mr. Brown.\n \u201cPlease, allow my ushers to seat you. You\u2019re just in time for the first course. During the third course, entertainments begin,\u201d Raneka said with a hospitable smile which fairly reeked fakery.\n Mr. Brown threw her a sharp look. \u201cMight I say you look rather resplendent tonight, Dahshani Raneka.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Mr.\u2014have we met?\u201d asked Raneka before one of the ushers waved at her in well-timed execution. \u201cYou must excuse me, I am needed. Please, do enjoy the food. There won\u2019t be fireworks because we\u2019re in a state of emergency, but the entertainments will be very satisfying, I hope.\u201d\n Mr. Brown threw her a piercing look that turned her knees into gelatin.\n She walked away until she reached a smartly attired servitor. It was Ravesh Kaligil, a curly-haired Kattani warrior who had been trained by her grandfather.\n \u201cAre you fine, Raneka?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cI\u2019m trying to be fine,\u201d Raneka murmured, willing her hands not to shake. But even now, even now her heart did not skip a beat and was insistently normal in its measured, rapid rhythm.\n \u201cYou did well, as you did well in allowing the Complect to weave you back in. But be safe, Raneka. Those three . . . those three are incredibly dangerous.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Raneka said with a bitter laugh.\n \u201cGo now, you\u2019re needed in the foyer,\u201d said Ravesh. \u201cMore organizing.\u201d\n Raneka nodded and left the ballroom with some relief. More familiar faces met her at the foyer, dressed in the uniforms provided by the new caterers.\n \u201cIs there something wrong with the food delivery?\u201d she asked them.\n \u201cNo, everything is going according to plan, Dahshani,\u201d said Creondi. \u201cBut we need your consent for certain . . . arrangements.\u201d\n \u201cWalk me through it then,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps in the kitchen?\u201d\n She strode towards the kitchens without waiting to see if they followed her. Earlier, the caterers had set up their cooking stations and their implements. It was also there that more resistant servitors placed by the Inquisitors had been dispatched rather ungently.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no turning back now, Raneka,\u201d said Creondi.\n \u201cI know\u2014but you still need my consent, it would seem,\u201d said Raneka, injecting the dark amusement she\u2019d been feeling all night.\n \u201cFor this, yes. Do you consent for us to enact the final act for the night?\u201d\n \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me yesterday afternoon, I would have said no. Tonight? I\u2019ll say\u2014go for it, even if unnecessary. Final act for the night, but opening act for the war, is it not?\u201d\n Creondi gave her a searching look, \u201cYou\u2019re still not recovered from learning what they\u2019ve done to you. We have not recovered. If we\u2019d known much earlier, we\u2019d have tried to extract you.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Infarre had that hunch, then,\u201d said Raneka.\n \u201cWe should have had that hunch earlier,\u201d said Creondi.\n \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t. Infarre did. Give her credit for it,\u201d said Acquasar.\n They both turned to find him lounging against the doorframe. \u201cHowever, I am here to tell you the Governor\u2019s officials have arrived. When do the games begin?\u201d\n \u201cBetween the second and third course,\u201d Raneka said decisively.\n Behind her, a man moaned in grief. \u201cCan you all not wait till after they\u2019ve enjoyed all the courses?\u201d\n \u201cMahruk, we\u2019ve gone through this. We told you not to cook your best,\u201d said Acquasar as he swatted at the head chef\u2019s arm.\n \u201cHow can I not cook my best?\u201d\n \u201cRelax. Just don\u2019t serve all the courses\u2014later they can be portioned out to people who really deserve them,\u201d said Creondi sharply. He then turned towards Raneka, \u201cAnother thing, Raneka. Some of our own are also Llen. We need your consent for that too\u2014after what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n Raneka inhaled. \u201cI can\u2019t blame all Llen for the actions of those who work with the Dvenri. But I can\u2019t be comfortable with them either. But if the Llen are as deadly as they appear to be then it makes sense to make things more fairly matched.\u201d\n \u201cWe will do our best not to startle or frighten you too much,\u201d said one of the kitchen helpers, who looked up as she finished speaking.\n A certain familiarity to the set of her eyes told Raneka everything she needed to know.\n \u201cAmongst the catering team?\u201d asked Raneka.\n \u201cI . . . only found out just now,\u201d Creondi said apologetically.\n \u201cThis is such an unholy mess,\u201d groaned Acquasar. \u201cRaneka, are you fine?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll probably need to be in a dark room for a week or two after this is over. If we survive this,\u201d said Raneka.\n \u201cAlright then. Ready for the next phase?\u201d asked Acquasar.\n \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Creondi said to them both. \u201cWe will all need much fortitude. But this first act is not just happening here. The war will begin properly tonight in the Governor\u2019s Palace.\n Raneka took Acquasar\u2019s arm as they strolled towards the ballroom, thinking of the trajectory that took her from clothes shopping yesterday to actively participating in the initiation of the war from within the city.\n It defied belief, but she knew that wars had started over less.\n Outside, the klaxons began to wail. This time, it was not a test.\n Within, the floral arrangements disintegrated as tiny brass cannons popped out of the arrangements, shooting crystalline pellets set to stun or maim members of the Dvenri government who were present. It was messy and it was very unkind. Soon, prisoners and hostages were taken. The ballroom was emptied of nearly all of Raneka\u2019s guests.\n Raneka took particular pleasure in standing before Messrs Red, Brown, and White who were being immobilized by Llen insurrectionists.\n \u201cOur Llen allies I\u2019m told, have not been crossbred by Dvenri alchemists and are therefore stronger than you,\u201d Raneka told her tormenters as she took out her brass fork. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep you in place while I . . . make some modifications. You seem to forget that even mice have teeth, my morbid pussycats.\u201d\n Their eyes widened as she approached.\n \u201cFortunately for you, I\u2019m quite efficient with a fork. My grandfather trained me well,\u201d she said as she turned her attention upon Mr. Brown first. \u201cThis won\u2019t take too long. While I\u2019d love to protract your suffering\u2014we\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry and far too little time.\u201d\n Outside, the sound of cannon-fire punctuated their screams.\n As Liannell had predicted, the Great War that Serolar had been poised for did not happen on battlefields, or even in the streets of their segregated city. It began in ballrooms, in drawing rooms and across the two-dozen odd soirees that happened on the night of the Lion Moon.\n Nin Harris is an author, poet, critical theorist and Gothic scholar who exists in a perpetual state of unheimlich.

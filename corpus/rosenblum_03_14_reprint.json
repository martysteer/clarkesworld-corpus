He checked on the chickens clucking contentedly in their travel crates, then went outside to squat in the shade of one fully-deployed solar wing in the forty-three centigrade heat. Ilena, his sometimes-lover and poker partner, accused him of reverse snobbery, priding himself on being able to survive in the Sonoran heat without air conditioning. Zipakna smiled and tilted his water bottle, savoring the cool, sweet trickle of water across his tongue.\nNot true, of course. He held still as the first wild bees found him, buzzed past his face to settle and sip from the sweat-drops beading on his skin. Killers. He held very still, but the caution wasn\u2019t really necessary. Thirst was the great gentler here. Every other drive was laid aside in the pursuit of water.\nEven love?\nHe laughed a short note as the killers buzzed and sipped. So Ilena claimed, but she just missed him when she played the tourists without him. It had been mostly tourists from China lately, filling the underwater resorts in the Sea of Cortez. Chinese were rich and tough players and Ilena had been angry at him for leaving. But he always left in spring. She knew that. In front of him, the scarp he had been traversing ended in a bluff, eroded by water that had fallen here eons ago. The plain below spread out in tones of ochre and russet, dotted with dusty clumps of sage and the stark upward thrust of saguaro, lonely sentinels contemplating the desiccated plain of the Sonoran and, in the distance, the ruins of a town. Paloma? Zipakna tilted his wrist, called up his position on his link. Yes, that was it. He had wandered a bit farther eastward than he\u2019d thought and had cut through the edge of the Pima preserve. Sure enough, a fine had been levied against his account. He sighed. He serviced the Pima settlement out here and they didn\u2019t mind if he trespassed. It merely became a bargaining chip when it came time to talk price. The Pima loved to bargain.\nHe really should let the nav-link plot his course, but Ilena was right about that, at least. He prided himself on finding his way through the Sonora without it. Zipakna squinted as a flicker of movement caught his eye. A lizard? Maybe. Or one of the tough desert rodents. They didn\u2019t need to drink, got their water from seeds and cactus fruit. More adaptable than Homo sapiens, he thought, and smiled grimly.\nHe pulled his binocs from his belt pouch and focused on the movement. The digital lenses seemed to suck him through the air like a thrown spear, gray-ochre blur resolving into stone, mica flash, and yes, the brown and gray shape of a lizard. The creature\u2019s head swiveled, throat pulsing, so that it seemed to stare straight into his eyes. Then, in an eyeblink, it vanished. The Dragon chimed its full battery load. Time to go. He stood carefully, a cloud of thirsty killer bees and native wasps buzzing about him, shook free of them and slipped into the coolness of the Dragon\u2019s interior. The hens clucked in the rear and the Dragon furled its solar wings and lurched forward, crawling down over the edge of the scarp, down to the plain below and its saguaro sentinels.\nHis sat-link chimed and his console screen brightened to life. You are entering unserviced United States territory. The voice was female and severe. No support services will be provided from this point on. Your entry visa does not assure assistance in unserviced regions. Please file all complaints with the US Bureau of Land Management. Please consult with your insurance provider before continuing. Did he detect a note of disapproval in the sat-link voice? Zipakna grinned without humor and guided the Dragon down the steep slope, its belted treads barely marring the dry surface as he navigated around rock and thorny clumps of mesquite. He was a citizen of the Republic of Mexico and the US\u2019s sat eyes would certainly track his chip. They just wouldn\u2019t send a rescue if he got into trouble.\nSuch is life, he thought, and swatted an annoyed killer as it struggled against the windshield.\nHe passed the first of Paloma\u2019s plantings an hour later. The glassy black disks of the solar collectors glinted in the sun, powering the drip system that fed the scattered clumps of greenery. Short, thick-stalked sunflowers turned their dark faces to the sun, fringed with orange and scarlet petals. Zipakna frowned thoughtfully and videoed one of the wide blooms as the Dragon crawled past. Sure enough, his screen lit up with a similar blossom crossed with a circle-slash of warning.\nAn illegal pharm crop. The hairs on the back of his neck prickled. This was new. He almost turned around, but he liked the folk in Paloma. Good people, misfits not sociopaths. It was an old settlement and one of his favorites. He sighed, because three diabetics lived here and a new bird flu had come over from Asia. It would find its way here eventually, riding the migration routes. He said a prayer to the old gods and his mother\u2019s Santa Maria for good measure and crawled on into town.\nNobody was out this time of day. Heat waves shimmered above the black solar panels and a lizard whip-flicked beneath the sagging Country Market\u2019s porch. He parked the Dragon in the dusty lot at the end of Main Street where a couple of buildings had burned long ago and unfurled the solar wings again. It took a lot of power to keep them from baking here. In the back Ezzie was clucking imperatively. The oldest of the chickens, she always seemed to know when they were stopping at a settlement. That meant fresh greens. \u201cYou\u2019re a pig,\u201d he said, but he chuckled as he made his way to the back to check on his flock.\nThe twenty hens clucked and scratched in their individual cubicles, excited at the halt. \u201cI\u2019ll let you out, soon,\u201d he promised and measured laying ration into their feeders. Bella had already laid an egg. He reached into her cubicle and cupped it in his hand, pale pink and smooth, still warm and faintly moist from its passage out of her body. Insulin nano-bodies, designed to block the auto-immune response that destroyed the insulin producing Beta cells in diabetics. He labeled Bella\u2019s egg and put it into the egg fridge. She was his highest producer. He scooped extra ration into her feeder.\nIntruder his alarm system announced. The heads-up display above the front console lit up. Zipakna glanced at it, brows furrowed, then smiled. He slipped to the door, touched it open. \u201cYou could just knock,\u201d he said.\nThe skinny boy hanging from the front of the Dragon by his fingers as he tried to peer through the windscreen let go, missed his footing and landed on his butt in the dust.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hot out here,\u201d Zipakna said. \u201cCome inside. You can see better.\u201d\nThe boy looked up, his face tawny with Sonoran dust, hazel eyes wide with fear.\nZipakna\u2019s heart froze and time seemed to stand still. She must have looked like this as a kid, he thought. Probably just like this, considering how skinny and androgynous she had been in her twenties. He shook himself. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said and his voice only quivered a little. \u201cYou can come in.\u201d\n\u201cElla said you have chickens. She said they lay magic eggs. I\u2019ve never seen a magic egg. But Pierre says there\u2019s no magic.\u201d The fear had vanished from his eyes, replaced now by bright curiosity.\nThat, too, was like her. Fear had never had a real hold on her.\nHow many times had he wished it had?\n\u201cI do have chickens. You can see them now.\u201d He held the door open. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cDaren.\u201d The boy darted past him, quick as one of the desert\u2019s lizards, scrambled into the Dragon.\nHer father\u2019s name.\nZipakna climbed in after him, feeling old suddenly, dry as this ancient desert. I can\u2019t have kids, she had said, so earnest. How could I take a child into the uncontrolled areas? How could I leave one behind? Maybe later. After I\u2019m done out there.\n\u201cIt\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d Daren stared around at the control bank under the wide windscreen, his bare arms and legs, skin clay-brown from the sun, ridged with goosebumps.\nSo much bare skin scared Zipakna. Average age for onset of melanoma without regular boosters was twenty-five. \u201cWant something to drink? You can go look at the chickens. They\u2019re in the back.\u201d\n\u201cWater?\u201d The boy gave him a bright, hopeful look. \u201cElla has a chicken. She lets me take care of it.\u201d He disappeared into the chicken space.\nZipakna opened the egg fridge. Bianca laid steadily even though she didn\u2019t have the peak capacity that some of the others did. So he had a good stock of her eggs. The boy was murmuring to the hens who were clucking greetings at him. \u201cYou can take one out,\u201d Zipakna called back to him. \u201cThey like to be held.\u201d He opened a packet of freeze-dried chocolate soy milk, reconstituted it and whipped one of Bianca\u2019s eggs into it, so that it frothed tawny and rich. The gods knew if the boy had ever received any immunizations at all. Bianca provided the basic panel of nanobodies against most of the common pathogens and cancers. Including melanoma.\nIn the chicken room, Daren had taken Bella out of her cage, held her cradled in his arms. The speckled black and white hen clucked contentedly, occasionally pecking Daren\u2019s chin lightly. \u201cShe likes to be petted,\u201d Zipakna said. \u201cIf you rub her comb she\u2019ll sing to you. I made you a milkshake.\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s smile blossomed as Bella gave out with the almost-melodic squawks and creaks that signified her pleasure. \u201cWhat\u2019s a milkshake?\u201d Still smiling, he returned the hen to her cage and eyed the glass.\n\u201cSoymilk and chocolate and sugar.\u201d He handed it to Daren, found himself holding his breath as the boy tasted it and considered.\n\u201cPretty sweet.\u201d He drank some. \u201cI like it anyway.\u201d\nTo Zipakna\u2019s relief he drank it all and licked foam from his lip.\n\u201cSo when did you move here?\u201d Zipakna took the empty glass rinsed it at the sink.\n\u201cWow, you use water to clean dishes?\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes had widened. \u201cWe came here last planting time. Pierre brought those seeds.\u201d He pointed in the general direction of the sunflower fields.\nZipakna\u2019s heart sank. \u201cYou and your parents?\u201d He made his voice light.\nDaren didn\u2019t answer for a moment. \u201cPierre. My father.\u201d He looked back to the chicken room. \u201cIf they\u2019re not magic, why do you give them water? Ella\u2019s chicken warns her about snakes, but you don\u2019t have to worry about snakes in here. What good are they?\u201d\nThe cold logic of the Dry, out here beyond the security net of civilized space. \u201cTheir eggs keep you healthy.\u201d He watched the boy consider that. \u201cYou know Ella, right?\u201d He waited for the boy\u2019s nod. \u201cShe has a disease that would kill her if she didn\u2019t eat an egg from that chicken you were holding every year.\u201d\nDaren frowned, clearly doubting that. \u201cYou mean like a snake egg? They\u2019re good, but Ella\u2019s chicken doesn\u2019t lay eggs. And snake eggs don\u2019t make you get better when you\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t. And Ella\u2019s chicken is a banty rooster. He doesn\u2019t lay eggs.\u201d Zipakna looked up as a figure moved on the heads-up. \u201cBella is special and so are her eggs.\u201d He opened the door. \u201cHello, Ella, what are you doing out here in the heat?\u201d\n\u201cI figured he\u2019d be out here bothering you.\u201d Ella hoisted herself up the Dragon\u2019s steps, her weathered, sun-dried face the color of real leather, her loose sun-shirt falling back from the stringy muscles of her arms as she reached up to kiss Zipakna on the cheek. \u201cYou behavin\u2019 yourself, boy? I\u2019ll switch you if you aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m being good.\u201d Daren grinned. \u201cAsk him.\u201d\n\u201cHe is.\u201d Zipakna eyed her face and briefly exposed arms, looking for any sign of melanoma. Even with the eggs, you could still get it out here with no UV protection. \u201cSo, Ella, you got some new additions to town, eh? New crops, too, I see.\u201d He watched her look away, saw her face tighten.\n\u201cNow don\u2019t you start.\u201d She stared at the south viewscreen filled with the bright heads of sunflowers. \u201cPrices on everything we have to buy keep going up. And the Pima are tight, you know that. Plain sunflower oil don\u2019t bring much.\u201d\n\u201cSo now you got something that can get you raided. By the government or someone worse.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one comes out here from the city where you got water and power, go hiking around in the dust with enough stuff to keep raiders fat and happy for a year.\u201d Ella\u2019s leathery face creased into a smile. \u201cYou preachin\u2019 risk at me, Zip?\u201d\n\u201cAh, but we know I\u2019m crazy, eh?\u201d He returned her smile, but shook his head. \u201cI hope you\u2019re still here, next trip. How\u2019re you\u2019re sugar levels? You been checking?\u201d\n\u201cIf we ain\u2019t we ain\u2019t.\u201d She lifted one bony shoulder in a shrug. \u201cThey\u2019re holding. They always do.\u201d\n\u201cThe eggs do make you well?\u201d Daren looked at Ella.\n\u201cYeah, they do.\u201d Ella cocked her head at him. \u201cThere\u2019s magic, even if Pierre don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u201cDo you really come from a city?\u201d Daren was looking up at Zipakna now. \u201cWith a dome and water in the taps and everything?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I come from Oaxaca, which doesn\u2019t have a dome. I spend most of my time in La Paz. It\u2019s on the Baja peninsula, if you know where that is.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d He grinned. \u201cElla\u2019s been schooling me. I know where Oaxaca is, too. You\u2019re Mexican, right?\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cHow come you come up here with your eggs?\u201d\nElla was watching him, her dark eyes sharp with surmise. Nobody had ever asked him that question openly before. It wasn\u2019t the kind of question you asked, out here. Not out loud. He looked down into Daren\u2019s hazel eyes, into her eyes. \u201cBecause nobody else does.\u201d\nDaren\u2019s eyes darkened and he looked down at the floor, frowning slightly.\n\u201cSit down, Ella, let me get you your egg. Long as you\u2019re here.\u201d Zipakna turned quickly to the kitchen wall and filled glasses with water. While they drank, he got Bella\u2019s fresh egg from the egg-fridge and cracked it into a glass, blending it with the raspberry concentrate that Ella favored and a bit of soy milk.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a milkshake,\u201d Daren announced as Zipakna handed Ella the glass. \u201cHe made me one, too.\u201d He looked up at Zipakna. \u201cI\u2019m not sick.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t think you were.\u201d Ella lifted her glass in a salute. \u201cBecause nobody else does.\u201d Drank it down. \u201cYou gonna come eat with us tonight?\u201d Usually the invitation came with a grin that revealed the gap in her upper front teeth, and a threat about her latest pequin salsa. Today her smile was cautious. Wary. \u201cDaren?\u201d She nodded at the boy. \u201cYou go help Maria with the food. You know it\u2019s your turn today.\u201d\n\u201cAw.\u201d He scuffed his bare feet, but headed for the door. \u201cCan I come pet the chickens again?\u201d He looked back hopefully from the door, grinned at Zipakna\u2019s nod, and slipped out, letting in a breath of oven-air.\n\u201cAh, Ella.\u201d Zipakna sighed and reached into the upper cupboard. \u201cWhy did you plant those damn sunflowers?\u201d He pulled out the bottle of aged mescal tucked away behind the freeze-dried staples. He filled a small, thick glass and set it down on the table in front of Ella beside her refilled water glass. \u201cThis can be the end of the settlement. You know that.\u201d\n\u201cThe end can come in many ways.\u201d She picked up the glass, held it up to the light. \u201cPerhaps fast is better than slow, eh?\u201d She sipped the liquor, closed her eyes and sighed. \u201cLuna and her husband tried for amnesty, applied to get a citizen-visa at the border. They\u2019ve canceled the amnesty. You live outside the serviced areas, I guess you get to stay out here. I guess the US economy faltered again. No more new citizens from Outside. And you know Mexico\u2019s policy about US immigration.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they even let you come up here.\u201d\n\u201cOh, my government doesn\u2019t mind traffic in this direction. It likes to rub the US\u2019s nose in the fact that we send aid to its own citizens,\u201d he said lightly. Yeah, the border was closed tight to immigration from the north right now, because the US was being sticky about tariffs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019ve made the Interior Boundaries airtight.\u201d That was what she had been afraid of, all those years ago.\n\u201cI guess they have to keep cutting and cutting.\u201d Ella drained the glass, probing for the last drops of amber liquor with her tongue. \u201cNo, one is enough.\u201d She shook her head as he turned to the cupboard. \u201cThe folks that live nice want to keep it that way, so you got to cut somewhere. We all know the US is slowly eroding away. It\u2019s not a superpower anymore. They just pretend.\u201d She looked up at Zipakna, her eyes like flakes of obsidian set into the nested wrinkles of her sun-dried face. \u201cWhat is your interest in the boy, Zip? He\u2019s too young.\u201d\nHe turned away from those obsidian flake eyes. \u201cYou misunderstand.\u201d\nShe waited, didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cOnce upon a time there was a woman.\u201d He stared at the sun-baked emptiness of the main street on the vid screen. A tumbleweed skeleton turned slowly, fitfully across dust and cracked asphalt. \u201cShe had a promising career in academics, but she preferred field work.\u201d\n\u201cField work?\u201d\n\u201cShe was a botanist. She created some drought tolerant GMOs and started field testing them. They were designed for the drip irrigation ag areas, but she decided to test them . . . out here. She . . . got caught up in it . . . establishing adaptive GMOs out here to create sustainable harvests. She . . . gave up an academic career. Put everything into this project. Got some funding for it.\u201d\nElla sat without speaking as the silence stretched between them. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d She asked it, finally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The tumbleweed had run up against the pole of a rusted and dented No Parking sign and quivered in the hot wind. \u201cI . . . lost contact with her.\u201d\nElla nodded, her face creased into thoughtful folds. \u201cI see.\u201d\nNo, you don\u2019t, he thought.\n\u201cHow long ago?\u201d\n\u201cFifteen years.\u201d\n\u201cSo he\u2019s not your son.\u201d\nHe flinched even though he\u2019d known the question was coming. \u201cNo.\u201d He was surprised at how hard it was to speak that word.\nElla levered herself to her feet, leaning hard on the table. Pain in her hip. The osteo-sarcoma antibodies Red produced weren\u2019t specific to her problem. A personally tailored anti-cancer panel might cure her, but that cost money. A lot of money. He wasn\u2019t a doctor, but he\u2019d seen enough osteo out here to measure her progress. It was the water, he guessed. \u201cI brought you a present.\u201d He reached up into the cupboard again, brought out a flat plastic bottle of mescal with the Mexico state seal on the cap. Old stuff. Very old.\nShe took it, her expression enigmatic, tilted it, her eyes on the slosh of pale golden liquor. The she let her breath out in a slow sigh and tucked the bottle carefully beneath her loose shirt. \u201cThank you.\u201d Her obsidian eyes gave nothing away.\nHe caught a glimpse of rib bones, faint bruising, and dried, shrunken flesh, revised his estimate. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\u201cI think you need to leave here.\u201d She looked past him. \u201cWe maybe need to live without your eggs. I\u2019d just go right now.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer for a moment. Listened to the chuckle of the hens. \u201cCan I come to dinner tonight?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re crazy. We both know that.\u201d She sighed.\nHe held the door for her as she lowered herself stiffly and cautiously into the oven heat of the fading day.\nShe was right, he thought as he watched her limp through the heat shimmer, back to the main building. She was definitely right.\nHe took his time with the chickens, letting them out of their cages to scratch on the grass carpet and peck at the vitamin crumbles he scattered for them. While he was parked here, they could roam loose in the back of the Dragon. He kept the door leading back to their section locked and all his hens were good about laying in their own cages, although at this point, he could tell who had laid which egg by sight. By the time he left the Dragon, the sun was completely down and the first pale stars winked in the royal blue of the darkening sky. No moon tonight. The wind had died and he smelled dust and a whiff of roasting meat as his boots grated on the dusty asphalt of the old main street. He touched the small hardness of the stunner in his pocket and climbed the sagging porch of what had once been a store, back when the town had still lived.\nThey had built a patio of sorts out behind the building, had roofed it from the sun with metal sheeting stripped from other derelict buildings. Long tables and old sofas clustered inside the building, shelter from the sun on the long hot days where residents shelled sunflower seed after harvest or worked on repair jobs or just visited, waiting for the cool of evening. He could see the yellow flicker of flame out back through the old, plate-glass windows with their taped cracks.\nThe moment he entered he felt it\u2014tension like the prickle of static electricity on a dry, windy day. Paloma was easy, friendly. He let his guard down sometimes when he was here, sat around the fire pit out back and shared the mescal he brought, trading swallows with the local stuff, flavored with cactus fruit, that wasn\u2019t all that bad, considering.\nTonight, eyes slid his way, slid aside. The hair prickled on the back of his neck, but he made his smile easy. \u201cHola,\u201d he said, and gave them the usual grin and wave. \u201cHow you all makin\u2019 out?\u201d\n\u201cZip.\u201d Ella heaved herself up from one of the sofas, crossed the floor with firm strides, hands out, face turning up to kiss his cheeks. Grim determination folded the skin at the corners of her eyes tight. \u201cGlad you could eat with us. Thanks for that egg today, I feel better already.\u201d\nAh, that was the issue? \u201cGot to keep that blood sugar low.\u201d He gave her a real hug, because she was so solid, was the core of this settlement, whether the others realized it or not.\n\u201cCome on.\u201d Ella grabbed his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go out back. Rodriguez got an antelope, can you believe it? A young buck, no harm done.\u201d\n\u201cMeat?\u201d He laughed, made it relaxed and easy, from the belly. \u201cYou eat better than I do. It\u2019s all vat stuff or too pricey to afford, down south. Good thing maize and beans are in my blood.\u201d\n\u201cHey.\u201d Daren popped in from the firelit back, his eyes bright in the dim light. \u201cCan my friends come see the chickens?\u201d\nMy friends. The shy, hopeful pride in those words was so naked that Zipakna almost winced. He could see two or three faces behind Daren. That same tone had tainted his own voice, back when he had been a government scholarship kid from the wilds beyond San Cristobal, one of those who spoke Spanish as a second language. My friends, such a precious thing when you did not belong.\n\u201cSure.\u201d He gave Daren a \u2018we\u2019re buddies\u2019 grin and shrug. \u201cAny time. You can show \u2018em around.\u201d Daren\u2019s eyes betrayed his struggle to look nonchalant.\nA low chuckle circulated through the room, almost too soft to be heard and Ella touched his arm lightly. Approvingly. Zipakna felt the tension relax a bit as he and Ella made their way through the dusk of the building to the firelit dark out back. One by one the shadowy figures who had stood back, not greeted him, thawed and followed. He answered greetings, pretending he hadn\u2019t noticed anything, exchanged the usual pleasantries that concerned weather and world politics, avoided the real issues of life. Like illegal crops. One by one, he identified the faces as the warm red glow of the coals in the firepit lit them. She needed the MS egg from Negro, he needed the anti-malaria from Seca and so did she. Daren had appeared at his side, his posture taut, a mix of proprietary and anxious.\n\u201cMeat, what a treat, eh?\u201d Zipakna grinned down at Daren as one of the women laid a charred strip of roasted meat on a plate, dumped a scoop of beans beside it and added a flat disk of tortilla, thick and chewy and gritty from the bicycle powered stone-mill that the community used to grind maize into masa.\n\u201cHey, you be careful tomorrow.\u201d She ndded toward a plastic bucket filled with water, a dipper and cups beside it. \u201cDon\u2019t you let my Jonathan hurt any of those chickens. He\u2019s so clumsy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll show \u2018em how to be careful.\u201d Daren took the piled plate she handed him, practically glowing with pride.\nZipakna smiled at the server. She was another diabetic, like Ella. Sanja. He remembered her name.\n\u201cWatch out for the chutney.\u201d Sanja grinned and pointed at a table full of condiment dishes. \u201cThe sticky red stuff. I told Ella how to make it and she made us all sweat this year with her pequins.\u201d\n\u201cI like it hot.\u201d He smiled for her. \u201cI want to see if it\u2019ll make me sweat.\u201d\n\u201cIt will.\u201d Daren giggled. \u201cI thought I\u2019d swallowed coals, man.\u201d He carried his plate to one of the wooden tables, set it down with a possessive confidence beside Zipakna\u2019s.\nUsually he sat at a crowded table answering questions, sharing news that hadn\u2019t yet filtered out here with the few traders, truckers, or wanderers who risked the unserviced Dry. Not this time. He chewed the charred, overdone meat slowly, aware of the way Daren wolfed his food, how most of the people here ate the same way, always prodded by hunger. That was how they drank, too, urgently, always thirsty.\nNot many of them meant to end up out there. He remembered her words, the small twin lines that he called her \u2018thinking dimples\u2019 creasing her forehead as she stared into her wine glass. They had plans, they had a future in mind. It wasn\u2019t this one.\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t really why you come out here, is it? What you said before\u2014in your big truck?\u201d\nZipakna started, realized he was staring into space, a forkful of beans poised in the air. He looked down at Daren, into those clear hazel eyes that squeezed his heart. She had always known when he wasn\u2019t telling the truth. \u201cNo. It isn\u2019t.\u201d He set the fork down on his plate. \u201cA friend of mine . . . a long time ago . . . went missing out here. I\u2019ve . . . sort of hoped to run into her.\u201d At least that was how it had started. Now he looked for her ghost. Daren was staring at his neck.\n\u201cWhere did you get that necklace?\u201d\nZipakna touched the carved jade cylinder on its linen cord. \u201cI found it diving in an old cenote\u2014that\u2019s a kind of well where people threw offerings to the gods centuries ago. You\u2019re not supposed to dive there, but I was a kid\u2014sneaking in.\u201d\n\u201cAre the cenotes around here?\u201d Daren looked doubtful. \u201cI never heard of any wells.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re way down south. Where I come from.\u201d\nDaren scraped up the last beans from his plate, wiped it carefully with his tortilla. \u201cWhy did your friend come out here?\u201d\n\u201cTo bring people plants that didn\u2019t need much water.\u201d Zipakna sighed and eyed the remnants of his dinner. \u201cYou want this? I\u2019m not real hungry tonight.\u201d\nDaren gave him another doubting look, then shrugged and dug into the last of the meat and beans. \u201cShe was like Pierre?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\nThe boy flinched and Ziapkna softened his tone. \u201cShe created food plants so that you didn\u2019t need to grow as much to eat well.\u201d And then . . . she had simply gotten too involved. He closed his eyes, remembering that bitter, bitter fight. \u201cIs your mother here?\u201d He already knew the answer but Daren\u2019s head shake still pierced him. The boy focused on wiping up the last molecule of the searing sauce with a scrap of tortilla, shoulders hunched.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nAt the angry words, Daren\u2019s head shot up and he jerked his hands away from the plate as if it had burned him.\n\u201cI was just talking with him, Pierre.\u201d He looked up, sandy hair falling back form his face. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cI mind.\u201d The tall, skinny man with the dark braid and pale skin frowned down at Daren. \u201cWhat have I told you about city folk?\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . \u201d Daren bit off the word, ducked his head. \u201cI\u2019ll go clean my plate.\u201d He snatched his plate and cup from the table, headed for the deeper shadows along the building.\n\u201cYou leave him alone.\u201d The man stared down at him, his gray eyes flat and cold. \u201cWe all know about city folk and their appetites.\u201d\nSuddenly the congenial chatter that had started up during the meal, ended. Silence hung thick as smoke in the air. \u201cYou satisfied my appetite quite well tonight.\u201d Zipakna smiled gently. \u201cI haven\u2019t had barbecued antelope in a long time.\u201d\n\u201cYou got to wonder.\u201d Pierre leaned one hip against the table, crossed his arms. \u201cWhy someone gives up the nice air conditioning and swimming pools of the city to come trekking around out here handing out free stuff. Especially when your rig costs a couple of fortunes.\u201d\nZipakna sighed, made it audible. From the corner of his eye he noticed Ella, watching him intently, was aware of the hard lump of the stunner in his pocket. \u201cI get this every time I meet folk. We already went through it here, didn\u2019t anyone tell you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, they did.\u201d Pierre gave him a mirthless smile. \u201cAnd you want me to believe that some non-profit in Mexico\u2014Mexico!\u2014cares about us? Not even our own government does that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all politics.\u201d Zipakna shrugged. \u201cMexico takes quite a bit of civic pleasure in rubbing the US\u2019s nose in the fact that Mexico has to extend aid to US citizens. If the political situation changes, yeah, the money might dry up. But for now, people contribute and I come out here. So do a few others like me.\u201d He looked up, met the man\u2019s cold, gray eyes. \u201cHaven\u2019t you met an altruist at least once in your life?\u201d he asked softly.\nPierre looked away and his face tightened briefly. \u201cI sure don\u2019t believe you\u2019re one. You leave my son alone.\u201d He turned on his heel and disappeared in the direction Daren had taken.\nZipakna drank his water, skin prickling with the feel of the room. He looked up as Ella marched over, sat down beside him. \u201cWe know you\u2019re what you say you are.\u201d She pitched her voice to reach everyone. \u201cMe, I\u2019m looking forward to my egg in the morning, and I sure thank you for keeping an old woman like me alive. Not many care. He\u2019s right about that much.\u201d She gave Zipakna a small private wink as she squeezed his shoulder and stood up. \u201cSanja and I\u2019ll be there first thing in the morning, right, Sanja?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Sanja\u2019s voice emerged from shadow, a little too bright. \u201cWe sure will.\u201d\nZipakna got to his feet and Ella rose with him. \u201cYou should all come by in the morning. Got a new virus northwest of here. It\u2019s high mortality and it\u2019s moving this way. Spread by birds, so it\u2019ll get here. I have eggs that will give you immunity.\u201d He turned and headed around the side of the building.\nA thin scatter of replies drifted after him and he found Ella walking beside him, her hand on his arm. \u201cThey change everything,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThe flowers.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, the sat cams can see them.\u201d He kept his voice low as they crunched around the side of the building , heading toward the Dragon. \u201cThey measure the light refraction from the leaves and they can tell if they\u2019re legit or one of the outlaw strains. That\u2019s no accident, Ella. You don\u2019t realize how much the government and the drug gangs use the same tools. One or the other will get you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou better hope it\u2019s the government.\u201d\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t found us yet.\u201d\n\u201cThe seeds aren\u2019t ready to harvest are they?\u201d\n\u201cPierre says we\u2019re too isolated.\u201d\nZipakna turned on her. \u201cNowhere is isolated any more. Not on this entire dirt ball. You ever ask Pierre why he showed up here? Why didn\u2019t he stay where he was before if he was doing such a good job growing illegal seeds?\u201d\nElla didn\u2019t answer and he walked on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to let a ghost run your life.\u201d Ella\u2019s voice came low from the darkness behind him, tinged with sadness.\nZipakna hesitated as the door slid open for him. \u201cGood night, Ella.\u201d He climbed into its cool interior, listening to the hens\u2019 soft chortle of greeting.\nThey showed up in the cool of dawn, trickling up to the Dragon in ones and twos to drink the frothy blend of fruit and soymilk he offered and to ask shyly about the news they hadn\u2019t asked about last night. A few apologized. Not many.\nNeither Daren nor Pierre showed up. Zipakna fed the hens, collected the day\u2019s eggs and was glad he\u2019d given Daren his immunization egg the day before. By noon he had run out of things to keep him here. He hiked over to the community building in the searing heat of noon, found Ella sewing a shirt in the still heat of the interior, told her goodbye.\n\u201cGo with God,\u201d she told him and her face was as seamed and dry as the land outside.\nThis settlement would not be here when he next came this way. The old gods wrote that truth in the dust devils dancing at the edge of the field. He wondered what stolen genes those seeds carried. He looked for Daren and Pierre but didn\u2019t see either of them. Tired to the bone, he trudged back to the Dragon in the searing heat. Time to move on. Put kilometers between the Dragon and the dangerous magnet of those ripening seeds.\nYou have a visitor, the Dragon announced as he approached.\nHe hadn\u2019t locked the door? Zipakna frowned, because he didn\u2019t make that kind of mistake. Glad that he was still carrying the stunner, he slipped to the side and opened the door, fingers curled around the smooth shape of the weapon.\n\u201cElla said you were leaving.\u201d Daren stood inside, Bella in his arms.\n\u201cYeah, I need to move on.\u201d He climbed up, the wash of adrenalin through his bloodstream telling him just how tense it had been here. \u201cI have other settlements to visit.\u201d\nDaren looked up at him, frowning a little. Then he turned and went back into the chicken room to put Bella back in her traveling coop. He scratched her comb, smiled a little as she chuckled at him, and closed the door. \u201cI think maybe . . . this is yours.\u201d He turned and held out a hand.\nZipakna stared down at the carved jade cylinder on his palm. It had been strung on a fine steel chain. She had worn it on a linen cord with coral beads knotted on either side of it. He swallowed. Shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d The words came out husky and rough. \u201cShe meant you to have it.\u201d\n\u201cI thought maybe she was the friend you talked about.\u201d Daren closed his fist around the bead. \u201cShe said the same thing you did, I remember. She said she came out here because no one else would. Did you give it to her?\u201d\nHe nodded, squeezing his eyes closed, struggling to swallow the pain that welled up into his throat. \u201cYou can come with me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re her son. Did she tell you she had dual citizenship\u2014for both the US and Mexico? You can get citizenship in Mexico. Your DNA will prove that you\u2019re her son.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d have to ask Pierre.\u201d Daren looked up at him, his eyes clear, filled with a maturity far greater than his years. \u201cHe won\u2019t say yes. He doesn\u2019t like the cities and he doesn\u2019t like Mexico even more.\u201d\nZipakna clenched his teeth, holding back the words that he wanted to use to describe Pierre. Lock the door, he thought. Just leave. Make Daren understand as they rolled on to the next settlement. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d he said softly, so softly.\n\u201cA border patrol shot her.\u201d Daren fixed his eyes on Bella who was fussing and clucking in her cage. \u201cA chopper. They were just flying over, shooting coyotes. They shot her and me.\u201d\nShe had a citizen chip. If they\u2019d had their scanner on, they would have picked up the signal. He closed his eyes, his head filled with roaring. Yahoos out messing around, who was ever gonna check up? Who cared? When he opened his eyes, Daren was gone, the door whispering closed behind him.\nWhat did any of it matter? He blinked dry eyes and went forward to make sure the thermosolar plant was powered up. It was. He released the brakes and pulled into a tight turn, heading southward out of town on the old, cracked asphalt of the dead road.\nHe picked up the radio chatter in the afternoon as he fed the hens and let the unfurled panels recharge the storage batteries. He always listened, had paid a lot of personal money for the top decryption chip every trek. He wanted to know who was talking out here and about what.\nUS border patrol. He listened with half an ear as he scraped droppings from the crate pans and dumped them into the recycler. He knew the acronyms, you mostly got US patrols out here. Flower-town. It came over in a sharp, tenor voice. He straightened, chicken shit spilling from the dustpan in his hand as he listened. Hard.\nPaloma. What else could \u2018Flower-town\u2019 be out here? They were going to hit it. Zipakna stared down at the scattered gray and white turds on the floor. Stiffly, slowly, he knelt and brushed them into the dust pan. This was the only outcome. He knew it. Ella knew it. They\u2019d made the choice. Not many of them meant to end up out there. Her voice murmured in his ear, so damn earnest. They had plans, they had a future in mind. It wasn\u2019t this one.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d He bolted to his feet, flung the pan at the wall. \u201cWhy did you have his kid?\u201d The pan hit the wall and shit scattered everywhere. The hens panicked, squawking and beating at the mesh of their crates. Zipakna dropped to his knees, heels of his hands digging into his eyes until red light webbed his vision.\nFlower-town. It came in over the radio, thin and wispy now, like a ghost voice.\nZipakna stumbled to his feet, went forward and furled the solar panels. Powered up and did a tight 180 that made the hens squawk all over again.\nThe sun sank over the rim of the world, streaking the ochre ground with long, dark shadows that pointed like accusing fingers. He saw the smoke in the last glow of the day, mushrooming up in a black flag of doom. He switched the Dragon to infrared navigation, and the black and gray images popped up on the heads-up above the console. He was close. He slowed his speed, wiped sweating palms on his shirt. They\u2019d have a perimeter alarm set and they\u2019d pick him up any minute now. If they could claim he was attacking them, they\u2019d blow him into dust in a heartbeat. He\u2019d run into US government patrols out here before and they didn\u2019t like the Mexican presence one bit. But his movements were sat-recorded and recoverable and Mexico would love to accuse the US of firing on one of its charity missions in the world media. So he was safe. If he was careful. He slowed the Dragon even more although he wanted to race. Not that there would be much he could do.\nHe saw the flames first and the screen darkened as the nightvision program filtered the glare. The community building? More flames sprang to life in the sunflower fields.\nAttention Mexican registry vehicle N45YG90. The crudely accented Spanish filled the Dragon. You are entering an interdicted area. Police action is in progress and no entry is permitted.\nZipakna activated his automatic reply. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I will stop here. I have a faulty storage bank and I\u2019m almost out of power. I won\u2019t be able to go any farther until I can use my panels in the morning.\u201d He sweated in the silence, the hens clucking softly in the rear.\nStay in your vehicle. The voice betrayed no emotion. Any activity will be viewed as a hostile act. Understand?\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Zipakna broke the connection. The air in the Dragon seemed syrupy thick, pressing against his ear drums. They could be scanning him, watching to make sure that he didn\u2019t leave the Dragon. All they needed was an excuse. He heard a flurry of sharp reports. Gunshots. He looked up at the screen, saw three quick flashes of light erupt from the building beyond the burning community center. No, they\u2019d be looking there. Not here.\nNumbly he stood and pulled his protective vest from its storage cubicle along with a pair of night goggles. He put the Dragon on standby. Just in case. If he didn\u2019t reactivate it in forty-eight hours, it would send a mayday back to headquarters. They\u2019d come and collect the hens and the Dragon. He looked once around the small, dimly lit space of the Dragon, said a prayer to the old gods and touched the jade at his throat. Then he touched the door open, letting in a dry breath of desert that smelled of bitter smoke, and slipped out into the darkness.\nHe crouched, moving with the fits and starts of the desert coyotes, praying again to the old gods that the patrol wasn\u2019t really worrying about him. Enough clumps of mesquite survived here in this long ago wash to give him some visual cover from anyone looking in his direction and as he remembered, the wash curved north and east around the far end of the old town. It would take him close to the outermost buildings.\nIt seemed to take a hundred years to reach the tumble down shack that marked the edge of the town. He slipped into its deeper shadow. A half moon had risen and his goggles made the landscape stand out in bright black and gray and white. The gunfire had stopped. He slipped from shed to the fallen ruins of an old house, to the back of an empty storefront across from the community building. It was fully in flames now and his goggles damped the light as he peered cautiously from the glassless front window. Figures moved in the street, dressed in military coveralls. They had herded a dozen people together at the end of the street and Zipakna saw the squat, boxy shapes of two big military choppers beyond them.\nThey would not have a good future, would become permanent residents of a secure resettlement camp somewhere. He touched his goggles, his stomach lurching as he zoomed in on the bedraggled settlers. He recognized Sanja, didn\u2019t see either Ella or Daren, but he couldn\u2019t make out too many faces in the huddle. If the patrol had them, there was nothing he could do. They were searching the buildings on this side of the street. He saw helmeted figures cross the street, heading for the building next to his vantage point.\nZipakna slipped out the back door, made his way to the next building, leaned through the sagging window opening. \u201cDaren? Ella? It\u2019s Zip,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnyone there?\u201d Silence. He didn\u2019t dare raise his voice, moved on to the next building, his skin tight, expecting a shouted command. If they caught him interfering they\u2019d arrest him. It might be a long time before Mexico got him freed. His bosses would be very unhappy with him.\n\u201cElla?\u201d He hurried, scrabbling low through fallen siding, tangles of old junk. They weren\u2019t here. The patrol must have made a clean sweep. He felt a brief, bitter stab of satisfaction that they had at least caught Pierre. One would deserve his fate, anyway.\nTime to get back to the Dragon. As he turned, he saw two shadows slip into the building he had just checked\u2014one tall, one child short. Hope leaped in his chest, nearly choking him. He bent low and sprinted, trying to gauge the time . . . how long before the patrol soldiers got to this building? He reached a side window, its frame buckled. As he did, a slight figure scrambled over the broken sill and even in the black and white of nightvision, Zipakna recognized Daren\u2019s fair hair.\nThe old gods had heard him. He grabbed the boy, hand going over his mouth in time to stifle his cry. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Zip. Be silent,\u201d he hissed.\nLight flared in the building Daren had just left. Zipakna\u2019s goggles filtered it and crouching in the dark, clutching Daren, he saw Pierre stand up straight, hands going into the air. \u201cAll right, I give up. You got me.\u201d Two uniformed patrol pointed stunners at Pierre.\nDaren\u2019s whimper was almost but not quite soundless. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Zipakna breathed. If they hadn\u2019t seen Daren . . .\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one brought the seeds.\u201d The taller of the two lowered his stunner and pulled an automatic from a black holster on his hip. \u201cWe got an ID on you.\u201d\nA gun? Zipakna stared at it as it rose in seeming slow motion, the muzzle tracking upward to Pierre\u2019s stunned face. Daren lunged in his grip and he yanked the boy down and back, hurling him to the ground. The stunner seemed to have leaped from his pocket to his hand and the tiny dart hit the man with the gun smack in the center of his chest. A projectile vest didn\u2019t stop a stunner charge. The man\u2019s arms spasmed outward and the ugly automatic went sailing, clattering to the floor. Pierre dived for the window as the other patrol yanked out his own weapon and pointed it at Zipakna. He fired a second stun charge but as he did, something slammed into his shoulder and threw him backward. Distantly he heard a loud noise, then Daren was trying to drag him to his feet.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Pierre yanked him upright.\n\u201cThis way.\u201d Zipakna pointed to the distant bulk of the Dragon.\nThey ran. His left side was numb but there was no time to think about that. Daren and Pierre didn\u2019t have goggles so they ran behind him. He took them through the mesquite, ignoring the thorn slash, praying that the patrol focused on the building first before they started scanning the desert. His back twitched with the expectation of a bullet.\nThe Dragon opened to him and he herded them in, gasping for breath now, the numbness draining away, leaving slow, spreading pain in its wake. \u201cIn here.\u201d He touched the hidden panel and it opened, revealing the coffin shaped space beneath the floor. The Dragon was defended, but this was always the backup. Not even a scan could pick up someone hidden here. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to both fit. There\u2019s air.\u201d They managed it, Pierre clasping Daren close, the boy\u2019s face buried against his shoulder. Pierre looked up as the panel slid closed. \u201cThanks.\u201d The panel clicked into place.\nZipakna stripped off his protective vest. Blood soaked his shirt. They were using piercers. That really bothered him, but fortunately the vest had slowed the bullet enough. He slapped a blood-stop patch onto the injury, waves of pain washing through his head, making him dizzy. Did a stim-tab from the med closet and instantly straightened, pain and dizziness blasted away by the drug. Didn\u2019t dare hide the bloody shirt, so he pulled a loose woven shirt over his head. Visitor, the Dragon announced. US Security ID verified.\n\u201cOpen.\u201d Zipakna leaned a hip against the console, aware of the heads-up that still showed the town. The building had collapsed into a pile of glowing embers and dark figures darted through the shadows. \u201cCome in.\u201d He said it in English with a careful US accent. \u201cYou\u2019re really having quite a night over there.\u201d He stood back as two uniformed Patrol burst into the Dragon while a third watched warily from the doorway. All carrying stunners.\nNot guns, so maybe, just maybe, they hadn\u2019t been spotted.\n\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d The Patrol in charge, a woman, stared at him coldly through the helmet shield. \u201cDid you leave this vehicle or let anyone in?\u201d\nThe gods had come through. Maybe. \u201cGoodness, no.\u201d He arched his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m not that crazy. I\u2019m still stunned that Paloma went to raising pharm.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to fake the bitterness. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re burning the fields, right? They\u2019re a good bunch of people. I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever give in to that.\u201d\nMaybe she heard the truth in his words, but for whatever reason, the leader relaxed a hair. \u201cMind if we look around?\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question and he shrugged, stifling a wince at the pain that made it through the stimulant buzz.\n\u201cSure. Don\u2019t scare the hens, okay?\u201d\nThe two inside the Dragon searched, quickly and thoroughly. They checked to see if he had been recording video and Zipakna said thanks to the old gods that he hadn\u2019t activated it. That would have changed things, he was willing to bet.\n\u201cYou need help with your battery problem?\u201d The cold faced woman . . . a lieutenant, he noticed her insignia . . . asked him.\nHe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m getting by fine as long as I don\u2019t travel at night. They store enough for life support.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d get out of here as soon as the sun is up.\u201d She jerked her head at the other two. \u201cAny time you got illegal flowers you get raiders. You don\u2019t want to mess with them.\u201d\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He ducked his head. \u201cI sure will do that.\u201d He didn\u2019t move as they left, waited a half hour longer just to be sure that they didn\u2019t pop back in. But they did not. Apparently they believed his story, hadn\u2019t seen their wild dash through the mesquite. He set the perimeter alert to maximum and opened the secret panel. Daren scrambled out first, his face pale enough that his freckles stood out like bits of copper on his skin.\nHer freckles.\nZipakna sat down fast. When the stim ran out, you crashed hard. The room tilted, steadied.\n\u201cThat guy shot you.\u201d Daren\u2019s eyes seemed to be all pupil. \u201cAre you going to die?\u201d\n\u201cYou got medical stuff?\u201d Pierre\u2019s face swam into view. \u201cTell me quick, okay?\u201d\n\u201cThe cupboard to the left of the console.\u201d The words came out thick. Daren was staring at his chest. Zipakna looked down. Red was soaking into the ivory weave of the shirt he\u2019d put on. So much for the blood-stop. The bullet must have gone deeper than he thought, or had hit a small artery. Good thing his boarders hadn\u2019t stuck around longer.\nPierre had the med kit. Zipakna started to pull the shirt off over his head and the pain hit him like a lightning strike, sheeting his vision with white. He saw the pale green arch of the ceiling, thought I\u2019m falling . . .\nHe woke in his bed, groping drowsily for where he was headed and what he had drunk that made his head hurt this bad. Blinked as a face swam into view. Daren. He pushed himself up to a sitting position, his head splitting.\n\u201cYou passed out.\u201d Daren\u2019s eyes were opaque. \u201cPierre took the bullet out of your shoulder while you were out. You bled a lot but he said you won\u2019t die.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Pierre?\u201d He swung his legs over the side of the narrow bed, fighting dizziness. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d\n\u201cNot very long.\u201d Daren backed away. \u201cThe chickens are okay. I looked.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Zipakna made it to his feet, steadied himself with a hand on the wall. A quick check of the console said that Pierre hadn\u2019t messed with anything. It was light out. Early morning. He set the video to sweep, scanned the landscape. No choppers, no trace of last night\u2019s raiders. He watched the images pan across the heads-up; blackened fields, the smoldering pile of embers and twisted plumbing that had been the community center, still wisping smoke. The fire had spread to a couple of derelict building to the windward of the old store. Movement snagged his eye. Pierre. Digging. He slapped the control, shut off the vid. Daren was back with the chickens. \u201cStay here, okay? I\u2019m afraid to leave them alone.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Daren\u2019s voice came to him, hollow as an empty egg shell.\nHe stepped out into the oven heat, his head throbbing in time to his footsteps as he crossed the sunbaked ground to the empty bones of Paloma. A red bandanna had snagged on a mesquite branch, flapping in the morning\u2019s hot wind. He saw a woman\u2019s sandal lying on the dusty asphalt of the main street, a faded red backpack. He picked it up, looked inside. Empty. He dropped it, crossed the street, angling northward to where he had seen Pierre digging.\nHe had just about finished two graves. A man lay beside one. The blood that soaked his chest had turned dark in the morning heat. Zipakna recognized his grizzled red beard and thinning hair, couldn\u2019t remember his name. He didn\u2019t eat any of the special eggs, just the ones against whatever new bug was out there. Pierre climbed out of the shallow grave.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be walking around.\u201d He pushed dirty hair out of his eyes.\nWithout a word, Zipakna moved to the man\u2019s ankles. Pierre shrugged, took the man\u2019s shoulders. He was stiff, his flesh plastic and too cold, never mind the morning heat. Without a word they lifted and swung together, lowered him into the fresh grave. It probably wouldn\u2019t keep the coyotes out, Zipakna thought. But it would slow them down. He straightened, stepped over to the other grave.\nElla. Her face looked sad, eyes closed. He didn\u2019t see any blood, wondered if she had simply suffered a heart attack, if she had had enough as everything she had worked to keep intact burned around her. \u201cDid Daren see her die?\u201d He said it softly. Felt rather than saw Pierre\u2019s flinch.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He stuck the shovel into the piled rocks and dirt, tossed the first shovel full into the hole.\nZipakna said the right words in rhythm to the grating thrust of the shovel. First the Catholic prayer his mother would have wanted him to say, then the words for the old gods. Then a small, hard prayer for the new gods who had no language except dust and thirst and the ebb and flow of world politics that swept human beings from the chess board of the earth like pawns.\n\u201cYou could have let them shoot me.\u201d Pierre tossed a last shovel full of dirt onto Ella\u2019s grave. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nZipakna tilted his gaze to the hard blue sky. \u201cDaren.\u201d Three tiny black specks hung overhead. Vultures. Death called them. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a trade. I\u2019ll capitalize you to set up as a trader out here. You leave the pharm crops alone. I take Daren with me and get him Mexican citizenship. Give him a future better than yours.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Pierre\u2019s voice was low and bitter. \u201cI tried. Even though his mother was a US citizen, they\u2019re not taking in offspring born out here. Mexico has a fifteen year waiting list for new immigrants.\u201d He was staring down at the mounded rock and dust of Ella\u2019s grave. \u201cShe was so angry when she got pregnant. The implant was faulty, I guess. She meant to go back to the city before he was born but . . . I got hurt. And she stuck around.\u201d He was silent for awhile. \u201cThen it was too late, Daren was born and the US had closed the border. We\u2019re officially out here because we want to be.\u201d His lips twisted.\n\u201cWhy did you come out here?\u201d\nHe looked up. Blinked. \u201cMy parents lived out here. They were the rugged individual types, I guess.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI went into the city, got a job, and they were still letting people come and go then. I didn\u2019t like it, all the people, all the restrictions. So I came back out here.\u201d He gave a thin laugh. \u201cI was a trader to start with. I got hit by a bunch of raiders. That\u2019s when . . . I got hurt. Badly. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He turned away. \u201cI wish you could get him citizenship. He didn\u2019t choose this.\u201d\n\u201cI can.\u201d Zipakna watched Pierre halt without turning. \u201cShe . . . was my wife. We married in Oaxaca.\u201d The words were so damn hard to say. \u201cThat gave her automatic dual citizenship. In Mexico, only the mother\u2019s DNA is required as proof of citizenship. We\u2019re pragmatists,\u201d he said bitterly.\nFor a time, Pierre said nothing. Finally he turned, his face as empty as the landscape. \u201cYou\u2019re the one.\u201d He looked past Zipakna, toward the Dragon. \u201cI don\u2019t like you, you know. But I think . . . you\u2019ll be a good father for Daren. Better than I\u2019ve been.\u201d He looked down at the dirty steel of the shovel blade. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal. A trade. I\u2019ll sell you my kid. Because it\u2019s a good deal for him.\u201d He walked past Zipakna toward the Dragon, tossed the shovel into the narrow strip of shade along one of the remaining buildings. The clang and rattle as it hit sounded loud as mountain thunder in the quiet of the windless heat.\nZipakna followed slowly, his shoulder hurting. Ilena would be pissed, would never believe that Daren wasn\u2019t his. His mouth crooked with the irony of that. The old gods twisted time and lives into the intricate knots of the universe and you could meet yourself coming around any corner. As the Dragon\u2019s doorway opened with a breath of cool air, he heard Pierre\u2019s voice from the chicken room, low and intense against the cluck and chortle of the hens, heard Daren\u2019s answer, heard the brightness in it.\nZipakna went forward to the console to ready the Dragon for travel. As soon as they reached the serviced lands again he\u2019d transfer his savings to a cash card for Pierre. Pierre could buy what he needed on the Pima\u2019s land. They didn\u2019t care if you were a Drylander or not.\nIlena would be doubly pissed. But he was a good poker partner and she wouldn\u2019t dump him. And she\u2019d like Daren. Once she got past her jealousy. Ilena had always wanted a kid, just never wanted to take the time to have one.\nHe wondered if she had meant to contact him, tell him about Daren, bring the boy back to Mexico. She would have known, surely, that it would have been all right.\nSurely. He sighed and furled the solar wings.\nMaybe he would keep coming out here. If Daren wanted to. Maybe her ghost would find them as they traveled through this place she had loved. And then he could ask her.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine, February, 2008.\nMary Rosenblum attended the prestigious Clarion West Writers workshop in 1988, where she sold her first SF story to Asimov's Magazine editor Gardner Dozois and her writing career took off.

I spent most of my time inside the mattress where she slept, burrowing as close as I could to Maman so that I could feel her solidity and heat spreading out above me without burrowing so close that I came in contact with the harsh light and cold air. It was a delightful spongiform environment, flecked with tinier insects\u2014mites and flies and spiders\u2014and with the crumbs of food and flakes of human skin on which the lesser creatures fed. Life was not hard for me there.\nBut Maman frightened me. When I emerged from the mattress, she would sometimes grab me, pinch my useless wings and interrogate me in front of bright lights. She\u2019d put me in her nest of tubing and plastic cupboards and order me to run from one place to another as quick as I could. She would touch delicate golden wires to my various legs and my body would dance with strange impulses.\nUsually my days passed in total silence, except for the few occasions when Maman interacted with the other occupant of the ship, Uncle Frederick. These conversations were always initiated by Frederick, who would stare at her for a long time, then nod. They\u2019d go onto the deck, shut the cabin door behind them, and talk in very low voices. On one of these occasions I oozed out through a crack in the doorway and tried to listen to them more clearly.\nThey were huddled together behind the wheel of the ship.\nFrederick said, \u201c . . .have to interact with her. Want all of her descendents to be poorly socialized?\u201d\n\u201cIt is an insect,\u201d Maman said. \u201cDon\u2019t anthropomorphize it. It can be anything it wants to be. Why should it carry all our human baggage? I want to give them a blank slate.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what about survivors? What if she finds more of us? Or if her descendents do? What will they think of us if we don\u2019t at least try to be kind to her?\u201d\n\u201cI developed it. I know what is best for it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I risked my life to keep her alive. Food is getting low. I\u2019m not bringing more supplies unless I can get some sort of input.\u201d\n\u201cFine, talk to it, if that will make you happy. But don\u2019t involve me.\u201d\nAfter this, there was one day when she did not pinch me. Instead, she called out, \u201cYou\u2019ve been hiding from me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI always come when I hear you calling for me. But sometimes I don\u2019t hear.\u201d\n\u201cNo more hiding. I\u2019ve given the whistle to Frederick. You must go to him whenever he calls for you.\u201d\n\u201cPlease, not the whistle,\u201d I said, but she had already turned away.\nThe next day, my restless burrowing was interrupted by a sound that dragged hooks all across my body. Despite the pain, I tried to resist that insistent tootling. I stayed still for minutes, until the whistle had become near continuous, before I scuttled across the sticky deck of the cabin, up the stairs, and out into the freezing night.\nUncle Frederick lived in the cabin underneath the stairs. During the day he was largely quiescent: a vaguely human bulk that I sometimes perceived in the distance. But during the night he would lumber up the stairs and outside. He\u2019d be wrapped up in seven layers of cloth and nylon and plastic. He\u2019d seat himself down carefully on a mat, and stare up at the sky for hours.\nI insinuated myself into the folds of his jacket to avoid the buffeting blasts of wind.\nHis body rumbled with speech. \u201cTook you long enough to get here, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\nAll along the horizon line, fires blazed just out of sight, filling the sky with a sunset glow, even though it was midnight.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a good look aren\u2019t you?\u201d Frederick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so scary there. And it\u2019ll be even less scary for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re . . .you\u2019re taking me to the shore?\u201d I said.\n\u201cEventually. When your mother and I are gone, you\u2019ll need to forage for food. Don\u2019t worry, though, by then you\u2019ll have help.\u201d\n\u201cAre there more people, then? On land?\u201d\n\u201cI meant that you\u2019d have help from your own kind.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d The prospect of meeting more of myself was disgusting. I thought of them scrambling all over Maman and felt slightly ill. \u201cI would have liked to see more people.\u201d\n\u201cWell, maybe you will. What would you do if you saw them?\u201d\nI nestled more deeply into Frederick\u2019s jacket. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever bother them. I know that you and Maman don\u2019t like to be bothered.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s no need to be afraid of us. You should think of yourself as one of us.\u201d\nI moved deeper into Frederick\u2019s garments. He shuddered. His hand twitched and started scratching the places where I had been. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cSo sorry. I won\u2019t touch you again.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s my problem. I\u2019m not used to people shaped like you. But you\u2019re fine. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cWhen are there going to be more of me?\u201d\n\u201cSoon. When your egg case bursts, there should be forty or fifty more of you.\u201d\nI shifted my egg case uneasily, pressing it against Frederick\u2019s bulk as if to stop it from splitting open right there. I\u2019d seen what happened to the mothers of the spiders and flies in Maman\u2019s mattress.\n\u201cWill I have to die, then?\u201d I said\n\u201cDie?\u201d Uncle Frederick said. His body shook slightly. \u201cNo, never. You really don\u2019t know, then? You\u2019re never going to die. All your children will remember everything you remember. It will feel like closing your eyes to give birth, and then opening them in a new body. You\u2019ll live forever.\u201d\nAt the time, this was not a shock for me. I was too young to appreciate the gift that Maman had engineered into me.\nFrederick was silent for long moments after this. When I assayed a crawl up onto his face, I caught a brief glimpse of tear-stained eyes before an instinctive sweep of his hand dropped me to the deck with an exoskeleton-jouncing crash.\nI picked myself up off the damp, salty deck and scurried back to the safety of Maman\u2019s mattress.\nFrederick and Maman were arguing again. I did not have to try hard to hear them, since the cabin hatches had been left open in order to air out the stale and dusty smells.\n\u201cI told her,\u201d Frederick said.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve put your own spin on it. Called it \u2018immortality\u2019 or some such nonsense. You won\u2019t rest until you\u2019ve fully humanized it, will you?\u201d\n\u201cYou know that she thinks of you as her mother, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cYou are the only mother her species will ever have. All the millions and billions of her descendents will only remember one childhood: her childhood. You have to pay more attention to her psychology, to her development, to her socialization and her adjustment. Every interaction her species will ever have is going to be governed by the shadow of you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t project,\u201d Maman said. \u201cI barely remember my own childhood.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that? Why are you so cold?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made it clear that you have the upper hand here, Frederick, so I suppose I can\u2019t stop you from telling it whatever you want. We can even decant another, if you think I\u2019ve ruined this one. You can train the next one to call you papa.\u201d\n\u201cA second Eve?\u201d\n\u201cSure, or two more, or three, or a hundred . . .whatever it will take to satisfy you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have a hundred nations spring up to fight with each other, bomb each other, and create another disaster?\u201d\n\u201cIt will happen eventually.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. They won\u2019t be like that. Not if we do our jobs, they won\u2019t. They\u2019ll remember this, every single one of them . . .they\u2019ll look into each others\u2019 eyes and see themselves. They\u2019ll see that the good of everybody is the most important thing, and that if the race goes forward, then their memory will go forward, and they\u2019ll live forever.\u201d\n\u201cI know that my survival depends on your survival,\u201d Maman said. \u201cBut that hasn\u2019t prevented me from developing a hatred for you. Why should they be different?\u201d\nWhen Maman came in, she was smiling. She stared at the mattress for a long moment.\nShe was far away, too far to be able to catch me up, so I scrambled out of the mattress and called out, \u201cIs my name \u2018Eve,\u2019 then?\u201d\nMaman frowned. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a name.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it that you call me?\u201d Maman was creeping closer, and I skittered back slightly.\n\u201cMaman.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you get that name?\u201d\n\u201cIn the books that Frederick showed me, that is what the elephant called the woman who took care of him.\u201d\n\u201cYou liked his idiotic books?\u201d\n\u201cNnnnooo.\u201d\n\u201cGood. You don\u2019t need them.\u201d She crouched and spread her hands on the edge of the mattress, and looked at, past, through me.\n\u201cYour memory is good,\u201d Maman said. \u201cI know that, from the mazes I had you run. Please. Try to remember my face. You must never forget me.\u201d\nShe coaxed me up onto her hard, pitted hands\u2014those hands that were like whole worlds to me\u2014and lifted me up right in front of her face. This was my first good, long look at her. Usually, I only peeked at her with sidelong glances, in order to see if she was about to come after me.\nHer strangely-scented breath shivered right through my body, and I looked up with kaleidoscopic sight at her enormous face. Since then, I\u2019ve seen many human faces. But, in my memory, there is nothing human about Maman\u2019s face; it is a machine of snorting nostrils and slowly dilating pupils.\nThen she grabbed me by the wings and performed more tests on me.\nA few days later, Frederick motored away in the dinghy. He was heading off to the shore: to the fires. I was happy when he left, since I would not have that whistle tugging at me. But I was also sad. I crept into Maman\u2019s workroom, where she was poking her head into and out of her refrigerator and other equipment. I was all alone with her. Now that Uncle Frederick wasn\u2019t here to protect me, she could do anything.\nShe grunted as I crossed the threshold. She had not turned around. It was my first clue that she was always trying to sense where I was.\n\u201cIs he ever coming back?\u201d I said.\nMaman did not say anything. She played with her implements. As I waited, she picked up a very sharp tool that I had never seen her use before. I knew that she was not working. She was trying to scare me into running away.\n\u201cDid you send him away because of me?\u201d\nShe turned towards me and pursed her lips. \u201cHe\u2019s left before. The last time was several months ago, when you were very young. He is going to get more food and gasoline.\u201d\n\u201cSo he isn\u2019t gone forever?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll hear the whistle again, soon enough.\u201d\nSeveral days later, when Frederick came back, I was still ecstatic at having had such a long and nonviolent conversation with Maman. She had not come for me since we\u2019d spoken. I climbed up top and watched him unload the dinghy. Maman came out and helped him as he lifted things up.\n\u201cWhat was the land like?\u201d I said. \u201cDid you walk into the fires?\u201d\nMaman and Frederick exchanged a look. He handed her a satchel of cans. Everything in the boat was blackened with soot.\n\u201cThe forests are still burning, but the fires are mostly gone from the city,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDid you see any humans?\u201d Maman said.\n\u201cA good number,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to emerge.\u201d\nShe looked down at the cargo. \u201cDid you have to fight?\u201d\n\u201cSome,\u201d Frederick said.\nThey continued loading in silence, and didn\u2019t respond to my increasingly chipper questions. I scurried back and forth across the length of the metal hand-rail, and barely avoided being inadvertently slapped under Frederick\u2019s hand.\nI\u2019d hoped that Frederick would be too tired from his journey to use the whistle, but as night fell, I heard its shriek. It was even more terrible than I remembered.\nI ran out and settled on his chest.\nHe was quiet for several moments, then said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be kind to the people you find, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t even bother them at all!\u201d I said. \u201cExcept maybe when they\u2019re sleeping would it be maybe okay if I went inside their mattresses?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I meant . . .will you help them? They won\u2019t be having as easy a time as you. Will you tell them where food is? And not hurt them?\u201d\n\u201cTalk to them . . . ?\u201d I said. \u201cBut . . .will they . . .will they have whistles?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not. They don\u2019t even know that people like you exist. They\u2019ll probably be surprised to see you. But they\u2019ll want your help. They\u2019re hungry and they\u2019re dying.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they get more cans?\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t find them. And nobody is making more.\u201d\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t they eat the spiders and the flies and the crumbs of . . . \u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t. They\u2019re not like you. You\u2019ll need to talk to them, and ask them questions, and see what they need, and do what they want, just like you would for your mother.\u201d\n\u201cJust like Maman?\u201d I said. \u201cBut Maman doesn\u2019t need any help from me.\u201d\n\u201cIf she needed it, wouldn\u2019t you help her? These people will need your help very much.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I lay there on Frederick for a while, and then murmured, \u201cBut they won\u2019t have whistles, will they?\u201d\nAfter Frederick let me scurry into the warm insides of the ship, he called Maman onto the deck. I was too chilled to be willing to go farther than the door in order to listen to them.\n\u201c . . .more survivors than I expected . . . \u201d he said.\n\u201cYou knew there would be some,\u201d Maman said.\n\u201cBut they\u2019re starting to organize.\u201d\nMaman didn\u2019t say anything. I imagined her plucking up Frederick by the arms and running her tests on him while he kicked around uselessly.\n\u201cEve is terrified of human beings,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what she\u2019ll do when she encounters the survivors.\u201d\n\u201cIt will do what it decides is right.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t do anything. It associates human beings with silence and neglect and electric shocks and tests.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to those tests, it is in good health. It\u2019s ready for reproduction.\u201d\n\u201cI told you to pay attention to her socialization. You neglected her so much . . .I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever be able to interact normally.\u201d\n\u201cI told you to do what you thought was necessary. You are still free to try to cure the psychic wounds I supposedly inflicted on her. You brought enough supplies to buy you that.\u201d\n\u201cI had to kill a man in order to get these supplies. Next time, I doubt I\u2019ll be lucky enough to find such a poorly defended cache.\u201d\n\u201cYou brought enough for a few months. That is more than enough time.\u201d\n\u201cOr barely enough. If we have to start over.\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to hatch another female?\u201d Maman said.\n\u201cWe need to make the decision now. I think that Eve is too traumatized. She\u2019s not going to be able to function. We need to start over. You won\u2019t do any tests on the next one. I\u2019ll take care of her. I\u2019ll teach her all the things you held Eve back from: technology, art, literature, history, everything . . .Eve is such a fast learner . . .she really could have\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe disgusted you,\u201d Maman said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want anything to do with \u2018that damned roach.\u2019 Until it first spoke, you called this a crazy scheme.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how much earlier could she have spoken, if someone had been talking to her?\u201d\n\u201cWhy should their language be English? Why not something better? Something more suited to them?\u201d\n\u201cYou knew the kinds of things her mind was capable of. And you were still willing to drive her crazy, and stunt her forever. In fact, that\u2019s pretty much what you did.\u201d\n\u201cDid our art and literature and history help us? No. If its descendents create a better world than ours, they will do so because of their inhumanity.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all moot now. There are too many survivors. That changes everything. This won\u2019t be a post-human world. It\u2019ll be a human one. The next Eve needs to be as human as possible.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Maman said.\n\u201cI risked my life to keep this boat running! Risked it four times now. You\u2019ve contributed damn all. I could have lived twice as long if I\u2019d gone off on my own, without you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hatch another. But we won\u2019t be \u2018starting over.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThen the two of them will go to war eventually. Even you must see that there can only be one of them.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t destroy it. It is perfectly healthy. Billions of dollars and lifetimes of work were spent in creating it. But I will start decanting another progenitor tomorrow. This discussion is over.\u201d\nThe two of them entered. I waited until Frederick had gone off into his cabin and Maman had settled down into bed. Then I crept up to her ear and softly whispered. \u201cSo I\u2019ll have a sister, then?\u201d\nMaman\u2019s hand twitched and I skittered away. I heard a soft exhalation of air, and waited for the words that would come next, but she never said anything.\nI stayed in the mattress for hours, stewing in excitement and confusion. I hadn\u2019t known that Frederick disliked me so much. I was sorry that he\u2019d had to yell at Maman because I hadn\u2019t given him the right answers. I knew that maybe Frederick wanted to be mean to me, but I was so happy that Maman had stood up for me and said such good things about me. I knew that she loved me, just like the elephant\u2019s Maman had.\nBut, shortly before dawn, I felt the whistle. It was not the normal time for meeting with Frederick and I was especially lethargic. I lay in the mattress. The whistle cut through me again and again, but I didn\u2019t want to move. Finally, I started to leave my burrow. The whistling was coming from Frederick\u2019s cabin, where I\u2019d never visited. I was on the edge of the mattress now, and was about to drop to the floor.\nSomething picked me up by the wings. \u201cWait,\u201d said Maman.\nShe got up out of bed and dropped me onto the mattress. She walked into Frederick\u2019s cabin, and I heard the sound of three slaps. When she came back, the whistle was in her hand.\nShe grabbed me and took me into her workroom, then locked the door behind her.\nFrederick pounded on the workroom door. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he said.\n\u201cStay back,\u201d Maman called. \u201cIf you try to break down that door, I\u2019ll destroy the rest of the specimens. Then you\u2019ll never get your second chance.\u201d Maman held me down with pressure against my back.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how many people I saw out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were hundreds of them, already organized into bands, tribes, and families. We\u2019re going to make it through this catastrophe, you know.\u201d\nThen I felt the worst pain I\u2019d ever had in my life. All my legs tried to move at once, but they moved in different directions. I craned around, trying to look up, and glimpsed a metal syringe pulling away from my posterior.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking about all night,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cAbout how humanity is going to endure. And how maybe it\u2019s wrong for us to play God. Maybe the real catastrophe will be when all these creatures: so tiny, so intelligent, and so efficient, descend on the survivors. I\u2019m wondering, I really am, if unleashing Eve\u2014any Eve\u2014is the right thing to do here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I said. Maman didn\u2019t answer. She sank back, against the door. Frederick kept pounding on it. I lay there in the shallow receptacle where she\u2019d set me down. After a few moments, Maman got up and bustled around the workshop. Frederick kept saying things in the background, but I was no longer paying attention. What had Maman done to me?\nIt seemed like hours later when I heard a crashing noise. The door flew inwards, and Frederick charged. Maman was standing next to the door. She jabbed him with a needle. He turned towards her and slapped her on the face. He hit her again and again. She hit back at him, but it didn\u2019t seem that she was hurting him very much. Finally he saw me on the table, and took a step towards me. He fell down. Maman got up, and looked at him for a few moments. She took him by the feet and dragged him out of the workroom.\nFor the next thirty days, it was just the two of us. Maman only spoke to me one time. She told me that I was carrying eggs, and that I would soon be hatching into fifty new bodies. And even though the bodies would think and feel different things, all of them would think of themselves as me. I lay in her mattress as the eggs swelled. Sometimes she plucked me up by the wings and examined me under a looking glass. I think she\u2019d become afraid to run electricity through me.\nAfter one of the tests, she nodded to herself. She put me in a covered box and went out to the dinghy. I heard the motor start, and we traveled for several hours. I felt the boat hit something. I felt her pick up the box and carry it along with her. We were walking. Was I on land now? The box was still covered. I could not see where we were or where we were going. My abdomen was swelling. My body was aching. I felt a heavy pain along my back.\nFrederick had tried to kill me. Now Maman was abandoning me. Was I so disgusting? For a moment, I was very angry with them. I wanted to hurt them all. Then I realized how awful I was. The reason that Fred and Maman had hated me was because I\u2019d been such a brat about the tests and the whistle. But I swore that I\u2019d show them they were wrong about me. I\u2019d help every human being I saw. I\u2019d be their best friends. I would do anything they wanted and I\u2019d never, ever shy away or complain.\nWhen the cover was taken off the box, I was in a dark alcove, like a cupboard or shelf made of stone. Warm air washed over me. I could see a light bobbing up and down in the distance. A door opened, and I saw Maman silhouetted against the light of the sun. I tried to run to her, but I couldn\u2019t move.\nRahul Kanakia's first book, a young adult novel entitled Enter Title Here is coming out from Disney-Hyperion in Fall '15.

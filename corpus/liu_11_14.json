Today, it will cross it for the last time. Six hundred times it has accomplished this feat, and in so doing it has covered the same distance as more than eight roundtrips to the Moon. Its perfect safety record is a testament to the ingenuity of the German people.\nThere is always some sorrow in seeing a thing of beauty age, decline, and finally fade, no matter how gracefully it is done. But so long as men still sail the open skies, none shall forget the glory of the Hindenburg.\n\u2014John F. Kennedy, March 31, 1962, Berlin.\nIt was easy to see the zeppelins moored half a mile away from the terminal. They were a motley collection of about forty Peterbilts, Aereons, Macks, Zeppelins (both the real thing and the ones from Goodyear-Zeppelin), and Dongfengs, arranged around and with their noses tied to ten mooring masts, like crouching cats having t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate tea parties.\nI went through customs at Lanzhou\u2019s Yantan Airport, and found Barry Icke\u2019s long-hauler, a gleaming silver Dongfeng Feimaotui\u2014the model usually known in America, among the less-than-politically-correct society of zeppeliners, as the \u201cFlying Chinaman\u201d\u2014at the farthest mooring mast. As soon as I saw it, I understood why he called it the American Dragon.\nWhite clouds drifted in the dark mirror of the polished solar panels covering the upper half of the zeppelin like a turtle\u2019s shell. Large, waving American flags trailing red and blue flames and white stars were airbrushed onto each side of the elongated silver teardrop hull, which gradually tapered towards the back, ending in a cruciform tail striped in red, white, and blue. A pair of predatory, reptilian eyes were painted above the nose cone and a grinning mouth full of sharp teeth under it. A petite Chinese woman was suspended by ropes below the nose cone, painting over the blood-red tongue in the mouth with a brush.\nIcke stood on the tarmac near the control cab, a small, round, glass-windowed bump protruding from the belly of the giant teardrop. Tall and broad-shouldered, his square face featured a tall, Roman nose and steady, brown eyes that stared out from under the visor of a Red Sox cap. He watched me approach, flicked his cigarette away, and nodded at me.\nIcke had been one of the few to respond to my Internet forum ad asking if any of the long-haulers would be willing to take a writer for the Pacific Monthly on a haul. \u201cI\u2019ve read some of your articles,\u201d he had said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sound too stupid.\u201d And then he invited me to come to Lanzhou.\nAfter we strapped ourselves in, Icke weighed off the zeppelin\u2014pumping compressed helium into the gasbags until the zeppelin\u2019s positive lift, minus the weight of the ship, the gas, us, and the cargo, was just about equal to zero. Now essentially \u201cweightless,\u201d the long-hauler and all its cargo could have been lifted off the ground by a child.\nWhen the control tower gave the signal, Icke pulled a lever that retracted the nose cone hook from the mooring mast and flipped a toggle to drop about a thousand pounds of water ballast into the ground tank below the ship. And just like that, we began to rise, steadily and in complete silence, as though we were riding up a skyscraper in a glass-walled elevator. Icke left the engines off. Unlike an airplane that needs the engines to generate forward thrust to be converted into lift, a zeppelin literally floats up, and engines didn\u2019t need to be turned on until we reached cruising height.\n\u201cThis is the American Dragon, heading out to Sin City. See you next time, and watch out for those bears,\u201d Icke said into the radio. A few of the other zeppelins, like giant caterpillars on the ground below us, blinked their tail lights in acknowledgment.\nIcke\u2019s Feimaotui is three hundred and two feet long, with a maximum diameter of eighty-four feet, giving it capacity for 1.12 million cubic feet of helium and a gross lift of thirty-six tons, of which about twenty-seven are available for cargo (this is comparable to the maximum usable cargo load for semis on the Interstates).\nIts hull is formed from a rigid frame of rings and longitudinal girders made out of duratainium covered with composite skin. Inside, seventeen helium gasbags are secured to a central beam that runs from the nose to the tail of the ship, about a third of the way up from the bottom of the hull. At the bottom of the hull, immediately below the central beam and the gasbags, is an empty space that runs the length of the ship.\nMost of this space is taken up by the cargo hold, the primary attraction of long-haulers for shippers. The immense space, many times the size of a plane\u2019s cargo bay, was perfect for irregularly shaped and bulky goods, like the wind generator turbine blades we were carrying.\nNear the front of the ship, the cargo hold is partitioned from the crew quarters, which consists of a suite of apartment-like rooms opening off of a central corridor. The corridor ends by emerging from the hull into the control cab, the only place on the ship with windows to the outside. The Feimaotui is only a little bit longer and taller than a Boeing 747 (counting the tail), but far more voluminous and lighter.\nThe whole crew consisted of Icke and his wife, Yeling, the woman who was re-painting the grinning mouth on the zeppelin when I showed up. Husband-wife teams like theirs are popular on the transpacific long haul. Each of them would take six-hour shifts to fly the ship while the other slept. Yeling was in the back, sleeping through the takeoff. Like the ship itself, much of their marriage was made up of silence and empty space.\n\u201cYeling and I are no more than thirty feet apart from each other just about every minute, but we only get to sleep in the same bed about once every seven days. You end up learning to have conversations in five-minute chunks separated by six-hour blocks of silence.\n\u201cSometimes Yeling and I have an argument, and she\u2019ll have six hours to think of a comeback for something I said six hours earlier. That helps since her English isn\u2019t perfect, and she can use the time to look up words she needs. I\u2019ll wake up and she\u2019ll talk at me for five minutes and go to bed, and I\u2019ll have to spend the next six hours thinking about what she said. We\u2019ve had arguments that went on for days and days this way.\u201d\nIcke laughed. \u201cIn our marriage, sometimes you have to go to bed angry.\u201d\nThe control car was shaped like an airplane\u2019s cockpit, except that the windows slanted outward and down, so that you had an unobstructed view of the land and air below you.\nIcke had covered his seat with a custom pattern: a topographical map of Alaska. In front of Icke\u2019s chair was a dashboard full of instruments and analog and mechanical controls. A small, gleaming gold statuette of a laughing, rotund bodhisattva was glued to the top of the dashboard. Next to it was the plush figure of Wally, the Green Monster of Fenway Park.\nA plastic crate wedged into place between the two seats was filled with CDs: a mix of mandopop, country, classical, and some audio books. I flipped through them: Annie Dillard, Thoreau, Cormac McCarthy, The Idiot\u2019s Guide to Grammar and Composition.\nOnce we reached the cruising altitude of one thousand feet\u2014freight zeppelins generally are restricted to a zone above pleasure airships, whose passengers prefer the view lower down, and far below the cruising height of airplanes\u2014Icke started the electrical engines. A low hum, more felt than heard, told us that the four propellers mounted in indentations near the tail of the ship had begun to turn and push the ship forward.\n\u201cIt never gets much louder than this,\u201d Icke said.\nWe drifted over the busy streets of Lanzhou. More than a thousand miles west of Beijing, this medium-sized industrial city was once the most polluted city in all of China due to its blocked air flow and petroleum processing plants. But it is now the center of China\u2019s wind turbine boom.\nThe air below us was filled with small and cheap airships that hauled passengers and freight on intra-city routes. They were a colorful bunch, a ragtag mix of blimps and small zeppelins, their hulls showing signs of make-shift repairs and shanzhai patches. (A blimp, unlike a zeppelin, has no rigid frame. Like a birthday balloon, its shape is maintained entirely by the pressure of the gas inside.) The ships were plastered all over with lurid advertisements for goods and services that sounded, with their strange English translations, frightening and tempting in equal measure. Icke told me that some of the ships we saw had bamboo frames.\nIcke had flown as a union zeppeliner crewman for ten years on domestic routes before buying his own ship. The union pay was fine, but he didn\u2019t like working for someone else. He had wanted to buy a Goodyear-Zeppelin, designed and made one hundred percent in America. But he disliked bankers even more than Chinese airship companies, and decided that he would rather own a Dongfeng outright.\n\u201cNothing good ever came from debt,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have told you what was going to happen with all those mortgages last year.\u201d\nAfter a while, he added, \u201cMy ship is mostly built in America, anyway. The Chinese can\u2019t make the duratainium for the girders and rings in the frame. They have to import it. I ship sheets of the alloy from Bethlehem, PA, to factories in China all the time.\u201d\nThe Feimaotui was a quirky ship, Icke explained. It was designed to be easy to maintain and repair rather than over-engineered to be durable the way American ships usually were. An American ship that malfunctioned had to be taken to the dealer for the sophisticated computers and proprietary diagnostic codes, but just about every component of the Feimaotui could be switched out and repaired in the field by a skilled mechanic. An American ship could practically fly itself most of the time, as the design philosophy was to automate as much as possible and minimize the chances of human error. The Feimaotui required a lot more out of the pilot, but it was also much more responsive and satisfying to fly.\n\u201cA man changes over time to be like his ship. I\u2019d just fall asleep in a ship where the computer did everything.\u201d He gazed at the levers, sticks, wheels, toggles, pedals and sliders around him, reassuringly heavy, analog, and solid. \u201cTyping on a keyboard is no way to fly a ship.\u201d\nHe wanted to own a fleet of these ships eventually. The goal was to graduate from owner-operator to just owner, when he and Yeling could start a family.\n\u201cSomeday when we can just sit back and collect the checks, I\u2019ll get a Winnebago Aurora\u2014the forty-thousand-cubic-feet model\u2014and we and our kids will drift around all summer in Alaska and all winter in Brazil, eating nothing but the food we catch with our own hands. You haven\u2019t seen Alaska until you\u2019ve seen it in an RV airship. We can go to places that not even snowmachines and seaplanes can get to, and hover over a lake that has never seen a man, not a soul around us for hundreds of miles.\u201d\nWithin seconds we were gliding over the broad, slow expanse of the Yellow River. Filled with silt, the muddy water below us was already beginning to take on its namesake color, which would deepen and grow even muddier over the next few hundred miles as it traveled through the Loess Plateau and picked up the silt deposited over the eons by wind.\nBelow us, small sightseeing blimps floated lazily over the river. The passengers huddled in the gondolas to look through the transparent floor at the sheepskin rafts drifting on the river below the same way Caribbean tourists looked through glass-bottom boats at the fish in the coral reef.\nIcke throttled up and we began to accelerate north and east, largely following the course of the Yellow River, towards Inner Mongolia.\nThe Millennium Clean Energy Act is one of the few acts by the \u201cclowns down in D.C.\u201d that Icke approved: \u201cIt gave me most of my business.\u201d\nOriginally designed as a way to protect domestic manufacturers against Chinese competition and to appease the environmental lobby, the law imposed a heavy tax on goods entering the United States based on the carbon footprint of the method of transportation (since the tax was not based on the goods\u2019 country-of-origin, it skirted the WTO rules against increased tariffs).\nCombined with rising fuel costs, the law created a bonanza for zeppelin shippers. Within a few years, Chinese companies were churning out cheap zeppelins that sipped fuel and squeezed every last bit of advantage from solar power. Dongfengs became a common sight in American skies.\nA long-haul zeppelin cannot compete with a 747 for lifting capacity or speed, but it wins hands down on fuel efficiency and carbon profile, and it\u2019s far faster than surface shipping. Going from Lanzhou to Las Vegas, like Icke and I were doing, would take about three to four weeks by surface shipping at the fastest: a couple days to go from Lanzhou to Shanghai by truck or train, about two weeks to cross the Pacific by ship, another day or so to truck from California to Las Vegas, and add in a week or so for loading, unloading, and sitting in customs. A direct airplane flight would get you there in a day, but the fuel cost and carbon tax at the border would make it uneconomical for many goods.\n\u201cEvery time you have to load and unload and change the mode of transport, that\u2019s money lost to you,\u201d Icke said. \u201cWe are trucks that don\u2019t need highways, boats that don\u2019t need rivers, airplanes that don\u2019t need airports. If you can find a piece of flat land the size of a football field, that\u2019s enough for us. We can deliver door to door from a yurt in Mongolia to your apartment in New York\u2014assuming your building has a mooring mast on top.\u201d\nA typical zeppelin built in the last twenty years, cruising at one hundred ten mph, can make the sixty-nine-hundred-mile haul between Lanzhou and Las Vegas in about sixty-three hours. If it makes heavy use of solar power, as Icke\u2019s Feimaotui is designed to do, it can end up using less than a fraction of a percent of the fuel that a 747 would need to carry the same weight for the same distance. Plus, it has the advantage I\u2019d mentioned of being more accommodating of bulky, irregularly-shaped loads.\nAlthough we were making the transpacific long haul, most of our journey would be spent flying over land. The curvature of the Earth meant that the closest flight path between any two points on the globe followed a great circle that connected the two points and bisected the globe into two equal parts. From Lanzhou to Las Vegas, this meant that we would fly north and east over Inner Mongolia, Mongolia, Siberia, across the Bering Strait, and then fly east and south over Alaska, the Pacific Ocean off the coast of British Columbia, until we hit land again with Oregon, and finally reach the deserts of Nevada.\nBelow us, the vast city of Ordos, in Inner Mongolia, stretched out to the horizon, a megalopolis of shining steel and smooth glass, vast blocks of western-style houses and manicured gardens. The grid of new, wide streets was as empty as those in Pyongyang, and I could count the number of pedestrians on the fingers of one hand. Our height and open view made the scene take on the look of tilt-shift photographs, as though we were standing over a tabletop scale model of the city, with a few miniature cars and playing figurines scattered about the model.\nOrdos is China\u2019s Alberta. There is coal here, some of the best, cleanest coal in the world. Ordos was planned in anticipation of an energy boom, but the construction itself became the boom. The more they spent on construction, the more it looked on paper like there was need for even more construction. So now there is this Xanadu, a ghost town from birth. On paper it is the second-richest place in China, per capita income just behind Shanghai.\nAs we flew over the center of Ordos, a panda rose up and hailed us. The panda\u2019s vehicle was a small blimp, painted olive green and carrying the English legend: \u201cAerial Transport Patrol, People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d Icke slowed down and sent over the cargo manifests, the maintenance records, which the panda could cross-check against the international registry of cargo airships, and his journey log. After a few minutes, someone waved at us on from the window in the gondola of the blimp, and a Chinese voice told us over radio that we were free to move on.\n\u201cThis is such a messed up country,\u201d Icke said. \u201cThey have the money to build something like Ordos, but have you been to Guangxi? It\u2019s near Vietnam, and outside the cities the people there are among the poorest in the world. They have nothing except the mud on the floor of their huts, and beautiful scenery and beautiful women.\u201d\nIcke had met Yeling there, through a mail-order bride service. It was hard to meet women when you were in the air three hundred days of the year.\nOn the day of Icke\u2019s appointment, he was making a run through Nanning, the provincial capital, as part of a union crew picking up a shipment of star anise. He had the next day, a Saturday, off, and he traveled down to the introduction center a hundred kilometers outside Nanning to meet the girls whose pictures he had picked out and who had been bused in from the surrounding villages.\nThey had fifteen girls for him. They met in a village school house. Icke sat on a small stool at the front of the classroom with his back to the blackboard, and the girls were brought in to sit at the student desks, as though he was there to teach them.\nMost of them knew some English, and he could talk to them for a little bit and mark down, on a chart, the three girls that he wanted to chat with one-on-one in private. The girls he didn\u2019t pick would wait around for the next Westerner customer to come and see them in another half hour.\n\u201cThey say that some services would even let you try the girls out for a bit, like allow you to take them to a hotel for a night, but I don\u2019t believe that. Anyway, mine wasn\u2019t like that. We just talked. I didn\u2019t mark down three girls. Yeling was the only one I picked.\n\u201cI liked the way she looked. Her skin was so smooth, so young-looking, and I loved her hair, straight and black with a little curl at the end. She smelled like grass and rainwater. But I liked even more the way she acted with me: shy and very eager to please, something you don\u2019t see much in the women back home.\u201d He looked over at me as I took notes, and shrugged. \u201cIf you want to put a label on me and make the people who read what you write feel good about themselves., that\u2019s your choice. It doesn\u2019t make the label true.\u201d\nI asked him if something felt wrong about the process, like shopping for a thing.\n\u201cI paid the service two thousand dollars, and gave her family another five thousand before I married her. Some people will not like that. They\u2019ll think something is not altogether right about the way I married her.\n\u201cBut I know I\u2019m happy when I\u2019m with her. That\u2019s enough for me.\n\u201cBy the time I met her, Yeling had already dropped out of high school. If I didn\u2019t meet her, she would not have gone on to college. She would not have become a lawyer or banker. She would not have gone to work in an office and come home to do yoga. That\u2019s the way the world is.\n\u201cMaybe she would have gone to Nanning to become a masseuse or bathhouse girl. Maybe she would have married an old peasant from the next village who she didn\u2019t even know just because he could give her family some money. Maybe she would have spent the rest of her life getting parasites from toiling in the rice paddies all day and bringing up children in a mud hut at night. And she would have looked like an old woman by thirty.\n\u201cHow could that have been better?\u201d\nThe language of the zeppeliners on the transpacific long haul, though officially English, is a mix of images and words from America and China. Dao, knife, dough, and dollar are used as interchangeable synonyms. Ursine imagery is applied to law enforcement agents along the route: a panda is a Chinese air patrol unit, and a polar bear Russian; in Alaska they are Kodiaks, and off the coast of BC they become whales; finally in America the ships have to deal with grizzlies. The bear\u2019s job is to make the life of the zeppeliner difficult: catching pilots who have been at the controls for more than six hours without switching off, who fly above or below regulation altitude, who mix hydrogen into the lift gas to achieve an extra edge in cargo capacity.\n\u201cWhales?\u201d I asked Icke. How was whale a type of bear?\n\u201cEvolution,\u201d Icke said. \u201cDarwin said that a race of bears swimming with their mouths open for water bugs may eventually evolve into whales.\u201d (I checked. This was true.)\nNothing changed as an electronic beep from the ship\u2019s GPS informed us that we crossed the international border between China and Mongolia somewhere in the desolate, dry plains of the Gobi below, dotted with sparse clumps of short, brittle grass.\nYeling came into the control cab to take over. Icke locked the controls and got up. In the small space at the back of the control cab, they spoke to each other for a bit in lowered voices, kissed, while I stared at the instrument panels, trying hard not to eavesdrop.\nEvery marriage had its own engine, with its own rhythm and fuel, its own language and control scheme, a quiet hum that kept everything moving. But the hum was so quiet that sometimes it was more felt than heard, and you had to listen for it if you didn\u2019t want to miss it.\nThen Icke left and Yeling came forward to take the pilot\u2019s seat.\nShe looked at me. \u201cThere\u2019s a second bunk in the back if you want to park yourself a bit.\u201d Her English was accented but good, and you could hear traces of Icke\u2019s broad New England A\u2019s and non-rhoticity in some of the words.\nI thanked her and told her that I wasn\u2019t sleepy yet.\nShe nodded and concentrated on flying the ship, her hands gripping the stick for the empennage \u2013 the elevators and rudders in the cruciform tail \u2013 and the wheel for the trim far more tightly than Icke had.\nI stared at the empty, cold desert passing beneath us for a while, and then I asked her what she had been doing when I first showed up at the airport.\n\u201cFixing the eyes of the ship. Barry likes to see the mouth all red and fierce, but the eyes are more important.\n\u201cA ship is a dragon, and dragons navigate by sight. One eye for the sky, another for the sea. A ship without eyes cannot see the coming storms and ride the changing winds. It won\u2019t see the underwater rocks near the shore and know the direction of land. A blind ship will sink.\u201d\nAn airship, she said, needed eyes even more than a ship on water. It moved so much faster and there were so many more things that could go wrong.\n\u201cBarry thinks it\u2019s enough to have these.\u201d She gestured towards the instrument panel before her: GPS, radar, radio, altimeter, gyroscope, compass. \u201cBut these things help Barry, not the ship. The ship itself needs to see.\n\u201cBarry thinks this is superstition, and he doesn\u2019t want me to do it. But I tell him that the ship looks more impressive for customers if he keeps the eyes freshly painted. That he thinks make sense.\u201d\nYeling told me that she had also crawled all over the hull of ship and traced out a pattern of oval dragon scales on the surface of the hull with tung oil. \u201cIt looks like the way the ice cracks in spring on a lake with good fengshui. A ship with a good coat of dragon scales won\u2019t ever be claimed by water.\u201d\nThe sky darkened and night fell. Beneath us was complete darkness, northern Mongolia and the Russian Far East being some of the least densely inhabited regions of the globe. Above us, stars, denser than I had ever seen, winked into existence. It felt as though we were drifting on the surface of a sea at night, the water around us filled with the glow of sea jellies, the way I remember when I used to swim at night in Long Island Sound off of the Connecticut coast.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll sleep now,\u201d I said. She nodded, and then told me that I could microwave something for myself in the small galley behind the control cab, off to the side of the main corridor.\nThe galley was tiny, barely larger than a closet. There was a fridge, a microwave, a sink, and a small two-burner electric range. Everything was kept spotless. The pots and pans were neatly hung on the wall, and the dishes were stacked in a grid of cubbyholes and tied down with velcro straps. I ate quickly and then followed the sound of snores aft.\nIcke had left the light on for me. In the windowless bedroom, the soft, warm glow and the wood-paneled walls were pleasant and induced sleep. Two bunks, one on top of another, hung against one wall of the small bedroom. Icke was asleep in the bottom one. In one corner of the room was a small vanity with a mirror, and pictures of Yeling\u2019s family were taped around the frame of the mirror.\nIt struck me then that this was Icke and Yeling\u2019s home. Icke had told me that they owned a house in western Massachusetts, but they spent only about a month out of the year there. Most of their meals were cooked and eaten in the American Dragon, and most of their dreams were dreamt here in this room, each alone in a bunk.\nA poster of smiling children drawn in the style of Chinese folk art was on the wall next to the vanity, and framed pictures of Yeling and Icke together, smiling, filled the rest of the wall space. I looked through them: wedding, vacation, somewhere in a Chinese city, somewhere near a lake with snowy shores, each of them holding up a big fish.\nI crawled into the top bunk, and between Icke\u2019s snores, I could hear the faint hum of the ship\u2019s engines, so faint that you almost missed it if you didn\u2019t listen for it.\nI was more tired than I had realized, and slept through the rest of Yeling\u2019s shift as well as Icke\u2019s next shift. By the time I woke up, it was just after sunrise, and Yeling was again at the helm. We were deep in Russia, flying over the endless coniferous boreal forests of the heart of Siberia. Our course was now growing ever more easterly as we approached the tip of Siberia where it would meet Alaska across the Bering Sea.\nShe was listening to an audio book as I came into the control cab. She reached out to turn it off when she heard me, but I told her that it was all right.\nIt was a book about baseball, an explanation of the basic rules for non-fans. The particular section she was listening to dealt with the art of how to appreciate a stolen base.\nYeling stopped the book at the end of the chapter. I sipped a cup of coffee while we watched the sun rise higher and higher over the Siberian taiga, lighting up the lichen woodland dotted with bogs and pristine lakes still frozen over.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand the game when I first married Barry. We do not have baseball in China, especially not where I grew up.\n\u201cSometimes, when Barry and I aren\u2019t working, when I stay up a bit during my shift to sit with him or on our days off, I want to talk about the games I played as a girl or a book I remember reading in school or a festival we had back home. But it\u2019s difficult.\n\u201cEven for a simple funny memory I wanted to share about the time my cousins and I made these new paper boats, I\u2019d have to explain everything: the names of the paper boats we made, the rules for racing them, the festival that we were celebrating and what the custom for racing paper boats was about, the jobs and histories of the spirits for the festival, the names of the cousins and how we were related, and by then I\u2019d forgotten what was the stupid little story I wanted to share.\n\u201cIt was exhausting for both of us. I used to work hard to try to explain everything, but Barry would get tired, and he couldn\u2019t keep the Chinese names straight or even hear the difference between them. So I stopped.\n\u201cBut I want to be able to talk to Barry. Where there is no language, people have to build language. Barry likes baseball. So I listen to this book and then we have something to talk about. He is happy when I can listen to or watch a baseball game with him and say a few words when I can follow what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nIcke was at the helm for the northernmost leg of our journey, where we flew parallel to the Arctic Circle and just south of it. Day and night had lost their meaning as we flew into the extreme northern latitudes. I was already getting used to the six-hour-on, six-hour-off rhythm of their routine, and slowly synching my body\u2019s clock to theirs.\nI asked Icke if he knew much about Yeling\u2019s family or spent much time with them.\n\u201cNo. She sends some money back to them every couple of months. She\u2019s careful with the budget, and I know that anything she sends them she\u2019s worked for as hard as I did. I\u2019ve had to work on her to get her to be a little more generous with herself, and to spend money on things that will make us happy right now. Every time we go to Vegas now she\u2019s willing to play some games with me and lose a little money, but she even has a budget for that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get involved with her family. I figure that if she wanted out of her home and village so badly that she was willing to float away with a stranger in a bag of gas, then there\u2019s no need for me to become part of what she\u2019s left behind.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she also misses her family. How can she not? That\u2019s the way we all are, as far as I can see: we want that closeness from piling in all together and knowing everything about everyone and talking all in one breath, but we also want to run away by ourselves and be alone. Sometimes we want both at the same time. My mom wasn\u2019t much of a mom, and I haven\u2019t been home since I was sixteen. But even I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t miss her sometimes.\n\u201cI give her space. If there\u2019s one thing the Chinese don\u2019t have, it\u2019s space. Yeling lived in a hut so full of people that she never even had her own blanket, and she couldn\u2019t remember a single hour when she was alone. Now we see each other for a few minutes every six hours, and she\u2019s learned how to fill up that space, all that free time, by herself. She\u2019s grown to like it. It\u2019s what she never had, growing up.\u201d\nThere is a lot of space in a zeppelin, I thought, idly. That space, filled with lighter-than-air helium, keeps the zeppelin afloat. A marriage also has a lot of space. What fills it to keep it afloat?\nWe watched the display of the aurora borealis outside the window in the northern skies as the ship raced towards Alaska.\nI don\u2019t know how much time passed before I was jolted awake by a violent jerk. Before I knew what was going on, another sudden tilt of the ship threw me out of my bunk onto the floor. I rolled over, stumbled up, and made my way forward into the control cab by holding onto the walls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common to have storms in spring over the Bering Sea,\u201d Icke, who was supposed to be off shift and sleeping, was standing and holding onto the back of the pilot\u2019s chair. Yeling didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge me. Her knuckles were white from gripping the controls.\nIt was daytime, but other than the fact that there was some faint and murky light coming through the windows, it might as well have been the middle of the night. The wind, slamming freezing rain into the windows, made it impossible to see even the bottom of the hull as it curved up from the control cab to the nose cone. Billowing fog and cloud roiled around the ship, whipping past us faster than cars on the autobahns.\nA sudden gust slammed into the side of the ship, and I was thrown onto the floor of the cab. Icke didn\u2019t even look over as he shouted at me, \u201cTie yourself down or get back to the bunk.\u201d\nI got up and stood in the back right corner of the control cab, and used the webbing I found there to lash myself in place and out of the way.\nSmoothly, as though they had practiced it, Yeling slipped out of the pilot chair and Icke slipped in. Yeling strapped herself into the passenger stool on the right. The line on one of the electronic screens that showed the ship\u2019s course by GPS indicated that we had been zigzagging around crazily. In fact, it was clear that although the throttle was on full and we were burning fuel as fast as an airplane, the wind was pushing us backwards relative to the ground.\nIt was all Icke could do to keep us pointed into the wind and minimize the cross-section we presented to the front of the storm. If we were pointed slightly at an angle to the wind, the wind would have grabbed us around the ship\u2019s peripatetic pivot point and spun us like an egg on its side, yawing out of control. The pivot point, the center of momentum around which a ship would move when an external force is applied, shifts and moves about an airship depending on the ship\u2019s configuration, mass, hull shape, speed, acceleration, wind direction, and angular momentum, among other factors, and a pilot kept a zeppelin straight in a storm like this by feel and instinct more than anything else.\nLightning flashed close by, so close that I was blinded for a moment. The thunder rumbled the ship and made my teeth rattle, as though the floor of the ship was the diaphragm of a subwoofer.\n\u201cShe feels heavy,\u201d Icke said. \u201cIce must be building up on the hull. It actually doesn\u2019t feel nearly as heavy as I would have expected. The hull ought to be covered by a solid layer of ice now if the outside thermometer reading is right. But we are still losing altitude, and we can\u2019t go any lower. The waves are going to hit the ship. We can\u2019t duck under this storm. We\u2019ll have to climb over it.\u201d\nIcke dropped more water ballast to lighten the ship, and tilted the elevators up. We shot straight up like a rocket. The American Dragon\u2019s elongated teardrop shape acted as a crude airfoil, and as the brutal Arctic wind rushed at us, we flew like an experimental model wing design in a wind tunnel.\nAnother bolt of lightning flashed, even closer and brighter than before. The rumble from the thunder hurt my eardrums, and for a while I could hear nothing.\nIcke and Yeling shouted at each other, and Yeling shook her head and yelled again. Icke looked at her for a moment, nodded, and lifted his hands off the controls for a second. The ship jerked itself and twisted to the side as the wind took hold of it and began to turn it. Icke reached back to grab the controls as another bolt of lightning flashed. The interior lights went out as the lightning erased all shadows and lines and perspective, and the sound of the thunder knocked me off my feet and punched me hard in the ears. And I passed into complete darkness.\nBy the time I came to, I had missed the entire Alaskan leg of the journey.\nYeling, who had the helm, was playing a Chinese song through the speakers. It was dark outside, and a round, golden moon, almost full and as big as the moon I remember from my childhood, floated over the dark and invisible sea. I sat down next to Yeling and stared at it.\nAfter the chorus, the singer, a woman with a mellow and smooth voice, began the next verse in English:\nBut why is the moon always fullest when we take leave of one another?\nFor us, there is sorrow, joy, parting, and meeting.\nFor the moon, there is shade, shine, waxing and waning.\nIt has never been possible to have it all.\nAll we can wish for is that we endure,\nThough we are thousands of miles apart,\nYet we shall gaze upon the same moon, always lovely.\nYeling turned off the music and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand.\n\u201cShe found a way out of the storm,\u201d she said. There was no need to ask who she meant. \u201cShe dodged that lightning at the last minute and found herself a hole in the storm to slip through. Sharp eyes. I knew it was a good idea to repaint the left eye, the one watching the sky, before we took off.\u201d\nI watched the calm waters of the Pacific Ocean pass beneath us.\n\u201cIn the storm, she shed her scales to make herself lighter.\u201d\nI imagined the tung oil lines drawn on the ship\u2019s hull by Yeling, the lines etching the ice into dragon scales, which fell in large chunks into the frozen sea below.\n\u201cWhen I first married Barry, I did everything his way and nothing my way. When he was asleep, and I was flying the ship, I had a lot of time to think. I would think about my parents getting old and me not being there. I\u2019d think about some recipe I wanted to ask my mother about, and she wasn\u2019t there. I asked myself all the time, what have I done?\n\u201cBut even though I did everything his way, we used to argue all the time. Arguments that neither of us could understand and that went nowhere. And then I decided that I had to do something.\n\u201cI rearranged the way the pots were hung up in the galley and the way the dishes were stacked in the cabinets and the way the pictures were arranged in the bedroom and the way we stored life vests and shoes and blankets. I gave everything a better flow of qi, energy, and smoother fengshui. It might seem like a cramped and shabby place to some, but the ship now feels like our palace in the skies.\n\u201cBarry didn\u2019t even notice it. But, because of the fengshui, we didn\u2019t argue any more. Even during the storm, when things were so tense, we worked well together.\u201d\n\u201cWere you scared at all during the storm?\u201d I asked.\nYeling bit her bottom lip, thinking about my question.\n\u201cWhen I first rode with Barry, when I didn\u2019t yet know him, I used to wake up and say, in Chinese, who is this man with me in the sky? That was the most I\u2019ve ever been scared.\n\u201cBut last night, when I was struggling with the ship and Barry came to help me, I wasn\u2019t scared at all. I thought, it\u2019s okay if we die now. I know this man. I know what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m home.\u201d\n\u201cThere was never any real danger from lightning,\u201d Icke said. \u201cYou knew that, right? The American Dragon is a giant Faraday cage. Even if the lightning had struck us, the charge would have stayed on the outside of the metal frame. We were in the safest place over that whole sea in that storm.\u201d\nI brought up what Yeling had said, that the ship seemed to know where to go in the storm.\nIcke shrugged. \u201cAerodynamics is a complex thing, and the ship moved the way physics told it to.\u201d\n\u201cBut when you get your Aurora, you\u2019ll let her paint eyes on it?\u201d\nIcke nodded, as though I had asked a very stupid question.\nLas Vegas, the diadem of the desert, spread out beneath, around, and above us.\nPleasure ships and mass-transit passenger zeppelins covered in flashing neon and gaudy giant flickering screens dotted the air over the Strip. Cargo carriers like us were constricted to a narrow lane parallel to the Strip with specific points where we were allowed to depart to land at the individual casinos.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Laputa,\u201d Icke pointed above us, to a giant, puffy, baroque airship that seemed as big as the Venetian, which we were passing below and to the left. Lit from within, this newest and flashiest floating casino glowed like a giant red Chinese lantern in the sky. Air taxis rose from the Strip and floated towards it like fireflies.\nWe had dropped off the shipment of turbine blades with the wind farm owned by Caesars Palace outside the city, and now we were headed for Caesars itself. Comp rooms were one of the benefits of hauling cargo for a customer like that.\nI saw, coming up behind the Mirage, the tall spire and blinking lights of the mooring mast in front of the Forum Shops. It was usually where the great luxury personal yachts of the high-stakes rollers moored, but tonight it was empty, and a transpacific long-haul Dongfeng Feimaotui, a Flying Chinaman named the American Dragon, was going to take it for its own.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll play some games, and then go to our room,\u201d Icke said. He was talking to Yeling, who smiled back at him. This would be the first chance they had of sleeping on the same bed in a week. They had a full twenty-four hours, and then they\u2019d take off for Kalispell, Montana, where they would pick up a shipment of buffalo bones for the long haul back to China.\nI lay in bed in my Downtown hotel room thinking about the way the furniture in my bedroom was arranged, and imagined the flow of qi around the bed, the nightstands, the dresser. I missed the faint hum of the zeppelin\u2019s engines, so quiet that you had to listen hard to hear them.\nI turned on the light and called my wife. \u201cI\u2019m not home yet. Soon.\u201d\n[This story was inspired in many ways by John McPhee\u2019s Uncommon Carriers.\nSome liberty has been taken with the physical geography of our world: a great circle flight path from Lanzhou to Las Vegas would not actually cross the city of Ordos.\nThe lyrics of the song that Yeling plays come from a poem by the Song Dynasty poet Su Shi (1037-1101 A.D).

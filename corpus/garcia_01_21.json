Sturgeon Memorial Award\nBrother-Adita paused at the top of the ridge and rotated one eye to take in the shells climbing the path behind them. They gestured beyond them with a limb, a habit picked up from their young, excitable sibling.\n\u201cQuarter-march, west-north-west,\u201d came their voice through the Kinnec.\n\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d the other two shells replied.\nMetal clacked against stone as the scouting party made their way over the rocky terrain until a half-crumbled hillside came into view above them. Freshly fallen boulders lay cracked and scattered on the flats below a large irregular hole. The hole was dark, the opening blackened and fused from heat.\nA recon drone unwrapped itself from the diplomat\u2019s shell.\n\u201cUnnecessary,\u201d Brother-Adita said. \u201cShell destroyed. Only core remains.\u201d\n\u201cOrigin uncertain. Caution warranted.\u201d\n\u201cCore dormant.\u201d\n\u201cCaution warranted,\u201d the Admiral\u2019s sibling said, using four of the shell\u2019s eight limbs to move aside inconvenient boulders. \u201cProceed, Sister-Marcus.\u201d\nThe drone entered the cavern ahead of them, eventually confirming the original report by Brother-Adita. One shell, destroyed on entry, core dormant, 87 percent probability of irreparable damage.\nIt was the uncertainty of the remaining 13 percent that concerned the two senior members of the scouting party.\nThe drone returned to its dock and the shell\u2019s powerful illumination came on, lighting up every corner of the chamber. Dust drifted down from the unstable hillside like ash as the three shells followed the trail of wreckage to the smashed-open craft half-embedded in the rock around it.\nThe Admiral\u2019s shell accessed Mammy and began scanning for origin markers as they worked to remove debris.\n\u201cAdvanced AI configuration,\u201d the diplomat commented.\n\u201cSuperior shell construction,\u201d the Admiral confirmed. \u201cKnown worlds origin 98 percent probability. New coding\u2014Mammy has no matches. Conclusion\u2014prototype.\u201d\n\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d Brother-Adita said, the tones that played after her Kinnec reply an indication of her excitement over her first successful mission. No small feat for such a young shell. \u201cRetrieval approved?\u201d\nThe Admiral\u2019s shell didn\u2019t hesitate \u201cConfirmed. Priority\u2014preserve function.\u201d\n\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d came the twin replies over the Kinnec.\nMetal screeched as they peeled it open. Below them, a light winked on and off on the side of the metallic ball that lay exposed at their feet.\n\u201cActivity noted,\u201d Brother-Adita said, playing another set of excited tones. It stretched out an appendage, but the Admiral\u2019s shell grabbed hold of it.\n\u201cBlue Protocol,\u201d it said, warning tones underlying its transmission. \u201cAvoid contact until\u2014\u201d\nWithout warning, the ball in front of them unfolded itself into a tiny, bronze, many-limbed bot.\n\u201cBot identified. Mission compromised.\u201d The Admiral\u2019s shell grabbed the other two and flung them back out of the cave\u2019s opening before yanking a boulder out of the wall.\nThe bot wrapped two tendrils around the shell\u2019s nearest limbs as the cave came down around them with a tremendous, shuddering crash of rocks and dust.\nPhilia\nNow\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would we do with it?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re many things we could do with it.\u201d\n\u201cLike?\u201d\nHer husband tapped a finger against his mouth, considering. Then he signed, \u201cMilk? Cheese?\u201d\nShe put her hands on her hips and raised her eyebrows at him. A coaxing smile curved his lips. She shook her head firmly.\n\u201cI\u2019m not milking it.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask you to.\u201d\nShe flung up her hands, eyes narrowed on him, disbelief in every line of her body.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t!\u201d he protested out loud.\nShe pointed to the garden. \u201cIt will eat everything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tether it somewhere safe.\u201d\nShe folded her arms and stared at him as the goat at his feet tore the heads off some flowers and chewed. He groaned, pushing a pitchfork to the side of the kitchen garden with his foot as he tugged ineffectually at the animal\u2019s leash. \u201cCome on, Hannibal, help me out here. She\u2019ll make me get rid of you otherwise.\u201d\nShe let out a harsh sound. \u201cTurning him against me. Nice.\u201d\nHe flashed a grin at her. \u201cAre you going to deny your first thought was to curry him?\u201d\nHer lips twitched. \u201cCan I help it if he\u2019s a delicacy on New Kairi?\u201d\n\u201cWell, on this world he\u2019s worth his weight in potatoes\u2014four sacks. I\u2019d rather we get more than one use out of him.\u201d\n\u201cFour sacks!\u201d\nHe shrugged, unrepentant. \u201cJoseph\u2019s niece is visiting from the Inner System. He needed the extra food.\u201d\n\u201cBut not a goat?\u201d\nHe bit his lip and looked at Hannibal.\n\u201cHe hates it, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cWell . . . \u201d His face was neutral, but she sensed him holding back his laughter.\nHannibal strolled toward her and decimated a few more flowers.\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cFine.\u201d With a dismissive wave, she added, \u201cBut I take no responsibility. He\u2019s your problem.\u201d\nHe gave her a coaxing smile. \u201cNo help at all? But we always work together.\u201d\nHer arm vibrated, signaling Sister had returned from her trip early, but she took a moment to wag a finger at him. \u201cYou should have thought about that before you . . . \u201d\nA sharp sensation ran up her forearm and burned itself into her elbow. She glanced down, freezing at the red glow under her skin, her flesh goose-pimpling. A Protectorate Alert. Something\u2019s happened.\nHer husband\u2019s solid body slammed into her, knocking her to the ground. Warm, wet liquid slapped down on her face and shoulders. Then she was rolling with him until they were behind a row of squat, thick-trunked palms.\nHer arm vibrated with the repeating pattern for an interstellar communication. She ignored it, wiping liquid from her face. She glanced at her sticky fingers, smelling it before she saw it.\nBlood.\nHer heart skipped a beat, and she turned to her husband, hands outstretched to check him, but he pulled her to his side and pointed with his chin. She peered through the broad, slatted palm leaves.\nThere was a smoking heap of flesh and bones and a spreading pool of blood where Hannibal had been. Coming toward them was one of Sister\u2019s floating, translucent drones, its tiny firing-port extended from its center.\n\u201cShe fired on you,\u201d her husband signed.\nShe frowned, shaking her head, trying to rise. \u201cNot possible. Sister must have\u2014\u201d\nHe yanked her flat with a firm hand and held her face so she\u2019d read his lips. \u201cI saw her aim and fire, Eva.\u201d\nHe was mistaken. He had to be.\nExcept her husband, a former soldier and Grandmaster of Valencia\u2019s Greatwood, would never make such a mistake.\nShe tapped at the inside of her wrist. \u201cDrone, Sentry,\u201d she thought.\nThe drone didn\u2019t pause.\n\u201cSister, standby and report.\u201d\nNo answering vibration greeted her request. Her elbow continued to throb, but she had no time to answer. She had milliseconds to formulate a strategy.\nBeside her, her husband squeezed her hand to draw her attention. \u201cNo response?\u201d\nShe shook her head. Their small home\u2014the nearest shelter\u2014was behind the drone. Sister\u2019s soloship was in the root cellar. She watched as a second drone rose from the cellar doors at the side of the stone house.\nA breath left her as she came to a swift conclusion. Her Sister, her protector and companion, the only being in the world she trusted more than her husband, was trying to kill her.\nAnd Siblings did not fail at their tasks.\nShe met her husband\u2019s gaze and saw he\u2019d come to the same conclusion. He signed, \u201cYou have to shut her down.\u201d\nEmotion swelled in her chest at the very idea, almost cut off her breath, but there was no other option. Sister had fired on her even though no Sibling could ever fire on another. Whatever was wrong, whatever had happened, Sister was a threat to them and had to be stopped. There was only one way to do that.\nThere were two drones hunting them, but with luck, Sister would be so focused on her task she would pay less attention to her husband. Eva didn\u2019t like relying on luck. But this was unprecedented; she had no choice.\nHer skin flushed with warmth as she brought her breathing under control and focused. She lowered her head and took one more look at her beloved\u2019s face. He gave her a slight nod, cheek brushing against the dirt, and a quick smile. Then he was up and running to her right, crashing into the brush just ahead of discharges from the drone that seared the earth behind him.\nShe rolled left, came to her feet, and dashed toward the river behind her. The spot between her shoulder blades burned with awareness and it seemed she ran forever, crouched over and zigzagging, expecting any moment to feel searing heat bloom on her skin.\nAs she splashed into the river and dove for the deepest part, agony speared through her leg. She jerked, but kept stroking, letting the current take her downstream. She knew the drone would follow, so she stayed submerged for several minutes. She finally turned at a spot where the river widened, peering up at the rippling surface, around at the waving reeds along the banks, and back into the hazy depths of the water behind her. Her arm and leg throbbed, and blood clouded the water around her thigh.\nThe drone appeared, hovering back and forth above the water, appendages rippling around its central gun. She stroked into the weeds along the bank, lungs burning, arm pulsing, knowing it was futile. The Kinnec network could find her anywhere and Sister could turn it on even if Eva disabled it. It would be a matter of seconds before the drone decided to either enter the water and finish her off or remain above and electrocute her and anything else within a wide radius. She searched the riverbed frantically for something, anything, to fight back with.\nThen\nCold swirling around her stomach shocked her awake. Eva blinked and shook her head, trying to clear her flickering red vision, and raised a hand to wipe her helmet.\nPain forked outward from her rib cage and she sucked in air, her hands instinctively closing around the source of it.\nGnarled flora pinned her to her seat. It had pierced Sister\u2019s hull, the tip embedding itself into her lower stomach.\nShit.\nThe red emergency light continued to ripple across her helmet. She focused on the Kinnec, but Sister was silent. She was racing to find a way to release the doors and get the drones to help her. Her damage was catastrophic enough to require shutdown protocols and she could not disable them. When that happened, the cold water creeping up Eva\u2019s calves would enter her suit and although the suit would seal that off and still allow her to breathe, the estimated repair time flickering on her display meant she would either drown or die from blood loss and hypothermia before Sister was able to get to her.\nWhere am I?\nThe suit brought up a star chart, then adjusted the zoom as she focused on the blinking cursor over a planet, all the way down to a meandering river and a town not far from it.\nNot far on a map, that was. In reality, she was miles away. Unless someone had seen the crash, they wouldn\u2019t arrive in time to do much more than watch as Sister sealed herself off to prevent interference.\nShe splashed around in the water, trying to open the compartment next to her chair, but the water had risen above it and it had locked itself to protect the more delicate instruments in the tool kit inside.\nFuck.\nShe tried to shift, tried to grab the wood tight enough to break it off, but the white-hot pain that speared through her made her vision gray out.\nA heavy vibration coursing through Sister\u2019s hull jolted her and stabbed at her side. Wet wavy trails slipped down the outside of her helmet as she swung her head to stare at the hull where the airlock had jammed around multiple jagged pieces of orange-green wood.\nThe seat under her and the hull around her vibrated rhythmically again. On instinct, she fought the pain long enough to pound her fist against the inside of the hull.\nThe rhythm stopped. Dizzy, she took great gulps of air, hoping against hope.\nA circle burned into the hull not far from her head. Sister\u2019s pings filled her display as she cascaded into full auto-repair shutdown, the ship shuddering as the hull was cut open.\nA man leaned into the gap, water streaming down his face and plastering a thin shirt to his shoulders. Dark eyes took in her situation. He reached out a brown hand, crossed with two tiny scars on the back, and his long fingers circled the branch. Pain made her grimace. His lips moved and she squinted against doubling vision to read them.\nSorry, he said, this might hurt.\nHe wedged himself in the space he\u2019d made and set a small cylinder against a part of the branch still above water. He met her gaze, a question in his. She nodded, shivering, her skin numb, the ache in her side hot. Light flashed. The main branch shifted and dropped, but his hands were there, shoving it off to the side before it could crush her legs.\nShe tried to move, but he wedged a hand against her shoulder, gesturing to the back of her chair. She fought the weakness spreading through her body and nodded again to show she understood.\nThe red-tinged water was at her chest as he dipped out of view. Agony enfolded her as he touched the part of the branch jutting out behind her chair.\nShe felt the moment the weight of it left her. By then, water lapped at her neck and warmth began to seep under her skin. She stopped shaking, her body floating on a cloud of numbness, as the displays around her darkened, and the emergency lights ceased, leaving her helmet nothing but a transparent shield.\nSister was gone.\nHurry, she thought, as strong arms lifted her out of her chair. Before we\u2019re trapped.\nShe was jostled and tugged and bumped, then there was a pale sky above her and bright sunlight. An arm strong as steel had banded itself around her upper chest and was pulling her through the water.\nIn front of her, Sister\u2019s silver-gray body sank from view.\nEva closed her eyes and sank with her.\nNow\nAllow access.\n*Unauthorized.*\nAllow access.\n*Unauthorized.

It would have to decide on entering the water or not, and that split second might give her time to find a way to fight back. Better yet, give him a chance to get to Sister and shut down her core.\nHe skidded to a stop, turned and raced back to the house, his feet barely feeling the uneven ground and painful rocks and sticks beneath them. He escaped the trees\u2014\n\u2014and almost ran into the second drone, which had flown back toward him. He dropped to his knees, sliding across to their kitchen garden, and grabbed the pitchfork he\u2019d left there. He was ready to throw when it said, *No.* Then, *Wait.*\nHe couldn\u2019t halt his reflexes. The pitchfork soared, clipping it. It rotated through the air gracefully, an umbrella taken by the wind, then stilled.\nBy then he\u2019d already reached the broken open cellar doors and flung them wide. But he thought of the drone\u2019s words and hesitated. He looked up, hoping it was no longer bent on attack.\nIt was darting toward the river, gunport extended.\nFear for Eva surged through him. With grim determination, he dropped into the dank cellar and the shadows that hid the sleek sliver body of Sister\u2019s primary shell.\nHer hands found a large branch, half embedded in the silty, leaf-covered riverbed. She dragged it free, her lungs desperate for air, every part of her body aching or throbbing. It wasn\u2019t much, but it would have to do. If she could knock the drone into the water, it would use a second or two to adapt before resuming the chase. Give Dee time to\u2014\nHer mind shied away from that decision. From that betrayal.\nSplinters stabbed her fingers as she dragged the rough, knotted wood toward the surface, murky water blurring as she kicked upward. She crested, taking in a huge breath and a small amount of river water. The drone fired, but she had already shunted to her left, her back to the riverbank, swinging the branch and knocking it aside. It spun away from her, halted, and aimed.\nShe crashed into the weeds as it fired, heat searing past her and exploding the plants on her right. She glanced backward, throwing the branch. The drone avoided it, swaying to the side. Before she could dive under, an energy blast slammed into it. Shriveling, it spiraled down into the river, hitting it hard as a stone a few meters from where she treaded water.\nShe swung around and saw another drone, gunport aimed at her, ready light pulsing a warm yellow. Then the light went out and its translucent body became a gray shapeless mass that plummeted to the ground.\nShe froze for long moments, her mind blank, before she swam for the shore and pulled herself out of the water. She was cradling the inanimate drone when her husband came running down the shoreline.\nHe pulled her into strong, sweat-glistened arms, his fingers tight on the back of her head and her hips. The drone poked into her stomach between them and she shuddered, sliding her hands around his waist.\nHe leaned back, pushing her wet hair from her face, dark eyes staring down into hers. His lips curved into words.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d\nShe buried her head against his shoulder, her heart a fist in her chest, slow tears leaking from beneath her lids.\nThen\nShe crossed into consciousness in an instant, her mind going from sleep to full wakefulness out of long habit. She lay on a pallet on a wooden floor and her armor was gone. She lifted her head, scanning her body, movement sending flashes of pain across her stomach and down her legs.\nShe was wearing a simple buttoned shirt made of a pale, rough weave. Too-big pants of the same material had been cinched around her waist with a belt. She reached under the loose shirt and ran her fingers over smooth bandages as she studied the room around her.\nIt was a small one. There was a pallet and a table with a mirror, shaver, comb, and brush. The door at the foot of her pallet stood open. Beyond it was a larger room and another door that led outside. Trees waved in the distance and fresh, sweet air swirled around her as she inched upward to sit against the wall behind her.\nShe tapped the underside of her wrist. Wake, Sister. Purple light strobed under her pale brown skin. The Kinnec was in standby mode. She had no way to talk to Sister. She fisted her hand against her knee, staring at it, willing the light to turn white, but it strobed until it faded away, and she raised her head, frustrated.\nThe man who had dragged her from the ship stood in the doorway, his head cocked to the side as he studied her.\nShe tensed, but he held out both hands, palm forward in a \u201cwait\u201d gesture. She read his lips. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t. You\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d\nShe hesitated, then gave a slight nod.\nHe looked thoughtful as he took two steps forward, his arms lowering to his sides. He wore pants like hers\u2014and nothing else. Water glimmered in the sparse hairs on his lean chest, and his hair was wet and edged with silver at his temples.\nShe was keenly aware that she was sticky and hot. She ran a hand over the canerows in her hair to make sure they were still neat, inhaling as her stomach protested her movement.\n\u201cCan you understand me?\u201d\nShe met his gaze, considering what was best in the situation, given she knew nothing of him.\nHe saved my life without knowing who I am. He deserves at least some of the truth.\nIt had been a long time since she\u2019d been without her suit, but she knew it was best to keep things simple, as many people didn\u2019t know her language.\nShe nodded, then touched her hand to her ears and shook her head.\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, then lowered himself into a lotus position, careful to keep his distance and not startle her.\nShe was amused at his concern for her emotional state. He couldn\u2019t know she could protect herself, with or without Sister. But she appreciated his care. She wondered about that, about who he was and why he was here, far from the settlement on the map. She was used to having Mammy\u2019s vast knowledge at her fingertips. It was disconcerting to not be able to search for information the moment she wanted it.\nShe pointed a finger at him and raised her eyebrows.\n\u201cMy friends call me Dee,\u201d he signed.\nSurprised, she stared a moment before answering. \u201cYou can sign?\u201d\n\u201cWhere I come from, it\u2019s common, but some signs may be different.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cEva.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to your ship, Eva?\u201d\n\u201cMicro-impact,\u201d she hedged. \u201cSpace debris in orbit clipped me. Lost control. Navigation.\u201d\nHe tapped a finger against his chin before responding. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be alive. Your ship\u2019s cocooned itself.\u201d\nRelief flooded her. \u201cStandard repair protocol. She\u2019ll be fine in a few days.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already been here a few days.\u201d\nEva frowned. \u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u201cThree.\u201d\nShe raised her eyebrows at him.\n\u201cDoc did minor surgery. He sedated you.\u201d\nShe nodded, but discomfort surged through her at the realization she\u2019d been helpless and under a stranger\u2019s care for so long.\n\u201cDoc says you\u2019re strong. You\u2019ll make a full recovery, but he recommends you rest. Two weeks at least.\u201d\nOut of the question.\n\u201cI can\u2019t impose.\u201d\n\u201cNo imposition,\u201d he signed. His eyes mirrored the smile that curved his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t often get company. I quite like it.\u201d\nShe let her disbelief show. \u201cI\u2019ve been unconscious.\u201d\n\u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d\nShe smiled despite herself. He looked pleased and rose gracefully to his feet.\n\u201cApologies. I\u2019m a poor host. You must be starving. I\u2019ll get you some food.\u201d There was laughter in his eyes as he added, \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d\nShe shook her head at his little joke as he disappeared through the door. Charming son of a bitch. Wonder why you\u2019re alone out here?\nShe frowned down at her wrist. Better keep my questions to myself until I\u2019m willing to answer his.\nNow\nEva had just applied a patch to her leg when her arm started up again, the red light beneath her skin glowing like the depths of some imagined hell.\nWith no Sister to initiate her Kinnec and give her instant access to her communications, she went to one of the hand-carved cupboards in the kitchen and withdrew an old com-let. After blowing dust off it, she closed the silver bracelet over her hand, activating its virtual keyboard. She tapped her fingers against her palm, linking her Kinnec system to it, and a blue screen swirled to life above her wrist, a red cursor blinking in the bottom left corner.\nThe woman that came into view had her hair in a familiar untidy knot atop her head, and her forehead was wrinkled with worry. Eva took one look at her beloved face with its animated dark eyes and satin-smooth brown skin and felt more tears prick behind her hot eyelids. The cursor began moving at lightning speed, no surprise given Brother-Monica had always been a fast talker, with lips or hands.\n\u201cOh, thank God, you alive! We was so worried here when you didn\u2019t answer the Alert. What happen? You okay?\u201d\nShe took a breath to steady herself before thinking her answer. \u201cNo,\u201d read the white text unrolling below Brother-Monica\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019m far from okay. And you know why, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nBrother-Monica paused, her full lips compressed as she searched Eva\u2019s face. Eva could see the worry etched in the lines bracketing her daughter\u2019s mouth. Brother-Monica worked as an aide to the Chair for National Security, and they\u2019d had their regular call a week ago, so she knew this was more than a family chat.\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\nShe let out a breath. \u201cIt bad, Mom. Real bad.\u201d\n\u201cSister attacked me,\u201d Eva told her. \u201cShe tried to kill me. Dee had to pull her core. Why would she do that? HOW could she do that?\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her,\u201d Brother-Monica said, her face full of sadness.\nThe memory of the second drone came to her. It was her at the end. I know it.\nBrother-Monica shook her head and Eva realized her thoughts had come up on the screen. She\u2019d forgotten to engage the Edit function. \u201cNo, Mom, it wasn\u2019t her.\u201d\nShe frowned. \u201cTell me everything. Now.\u201d\nBrother-Monica bit her lip and exhaled hard. \u201cIt was an attack via the Kinnec. We . . . lost citizens.\u201d\nEva clenched her fingers against the feeling that the bottom had just dropped out of her stomach.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it had an alert. We having Parliament in two days.\u201d\nShe opened her eyes. \u201cI lost track of the status\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe Griffiths hold the Chair. But we next and the Transition is in a year.\u201d\nDamn it. She\u2019d left this behind so long ago, but the Chair cycled through the Caretaker clans every fifty years, and when that happened, there was no help for it. Every Primarch had to do their duty. And she was the leading Primarch of the Gomez clan.\n\u201cHow many did we lose?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cSeven.\u201d\n\u201cThat many! We haven\u2019t lost that many at once in over a century.\u201d\nBrother-Monica\u2019s usually bright, happy eyes were clouded with worry. \u201cIs a War Parliament. There\u2019ll be a response. The clans have to agree.\u201d\n\u201cDo we know who did it?\u201d\n\u201cWe have an idea. The survivors had a few minutes to examine the source of the incursion before it was destroyed.\u201d\n\u201cThere were survivors? Where did this happen? When?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the training stations. A few hours ago. Two survivors. One was young. First solo mission. The other was a senior diplomat.\u201d\nThere was movement in the corner of her eye. Her husband came in, having hung her wet clothes out to dry. He glanced at the com-let, concern crinkling his brow.\nShe turned back to the display. \u201c . . . never had a chance.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Brother-Monica, say that again.\u201d\n\u201cI said, it was a recovery mission. They didn\u2019t expect an attack. They never had a chance.\u201d\n\u201cWhose mission was it? Did they break protocol? Is that how it happened?\u201d\nDee was by her side, his hand warm on her shoulder. She reached up with her free hand to grasp his. Brother-Monica smiled.\n\u201cLook who, nah.\u201d\nWhile they greeted each other, a realization took shape in Eva\u2019s mind and the horror of it grabbed her by the throat.\n\u201cWas it Sister? Was it her mission?\u201d\nBrother-Monica nodded slowly. \u201cYeah, Mom. Sorry.\u201d\nAll the air left her body. Eva sagged, numb, letting her wrist fall to her thigh. Dee put his arm around her shoulder, pressed his lips to her hair.\n\u201cShe let them in,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever it was got in the Kinnec through her.\u201d\nShe hated the pitying expression on her daughter\u2019s face, hated the desolate feeling that her Sister, her Sibling, was responsible for Kairi deaths.\nHow? HOW?\nSister was better than this. Smarter than this.\nThe Archive.\nBrother-Monica shook her head in warning. \u201cWe can\u2019t talk this over an interstellar connection. This is serious thing, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know. But that\u2019s why you\u2019re calling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nShe watched Brother-Monica\u2019s lips curve ever so slightly. \u201cYes.\u201d\nDee\u2019s fingers squeezed her shoulders, letting her know he was there. Letting her know he understood what was next.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get to a secure connection. We\u2019ll talk then.\u201d\nIt was two days travel to the nearest outpost with secure interstellar communications, and another three hours after arriving to a transport hub with authorized access to a Kairi Embassy. When they entered the grounds, their assigned diplomat Guardian woke itself with the customary colorful light show, flexing appendages and checking statuses before it enclosed them in an opaque gray proto-form, shaping comfortable seats beneath them and soothing them with harmonic vibrations as it worked.\nHer husband held her hand as the Guardian enfolded their heads with a Kinnec pod and activated the call. She squeezed his fingers as they waited in grayspace, anxiety and hope beating a rapid tattoo in her chest.\nThe grayspace faded to her daughter sitting on her veranda, a warm smile on her face. Brother-Monica wasted no time, knowing what would have been Eva\u2019s first question.\n\u201cSister managed to upload to the Archive.\u201d\n\u201cArchive?\u201d Dee asked her.\n\u201cOur upload center. Every clan has one where we backup every Sibling regularly. If anything catastrophic occurs to a shell, we Archive before it fails. If we can\u2019t Archive, we use the last saved recording to\u2014reactivate Siblings. Sister was able to Archive, but Mammy would have quarantined her until security sweeps were completed.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a . . . complication.\u201d\n\u201cA complication?\u201d Dee\u2019s words scrolled past in a different color.\nBrother-Monica bit her lip. \u201cSister resisted the sanitization protocols. She\u2019s walled herself off from the security sweep. From Mammy too.\u201d\n\u201cShe what?\u201d\nDee squeezed her hand as his words appeared. \u201cThe drone asked me to wait.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the second drone shot down the first.\u201d Eva thought it over. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. She must have known what was happening.\u201d\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d Brother-Monica confirmed, sitting forward in her wicker chair to wave at Eva\u2019s grandson, Brother-Ellis, as he played amongst the undulating, flowering rocks in the front yard with Monica\u2019s Brother. Brother had dropped a shield over his visual sensors for their game of hide-and-seek and was motionless in the yard as he counted down, Brother-Ellis\u2019 drone darting back and forth above them, searching for a good hiding place. \u201cSo, assuming whatever\u2019s in her code don\u2019t have control of her, she wanted to preserve it.\u201d\nEva thought about that, her virtual gaze resting on the sparkling roofs of the Gomez Co-op glasshouses in the distance. Familiar pride swelled within her at the sight. Brother-Monica\u2019s spouses ran them, along with Gomez clan members and other allied clans. In the last century, the Gomez\u2019s had become the largest suppliers of food and other basic materials on New Kairi. Their influence had grown accordingly, and her daughter had capped that with a coveted government position.\nBut none of that would protect Sister if she were compromised.\n\u201cCan you get me her mission playback?\u201d\n\u201cNot hers. Mammy won\u2019t allow access to Sister while she\u2019s infected.\u201d\n\u201cI need to see hers. I need to be with her.\u201d\n\u201cThe Caretakers restricted access to everything connected to that mission.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s insane. I have the highest clearance possible.\u201d\n\u201cNot right now. I tried claiming kin-rights. They refused me.\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t keep a family from their sibling.\u201d\n\u201cThey say it not safe. It was a Consortium attack.\u201d\nFuck. The Consortium was an old enemy. One the Kairi had defeated long ago, but which she had personally confronted again just a few years before. An AI collective that had developed after their abandonment at a dead Terran outpost, they had once made war on every biological organism holding territory and resources they found useful. Their defeat at the hands of the Kairi had pushed them into black market activities and cargo running, including a mostly illegal slavery and bounty hunting trade for desperate outposts.\nBrother-Monica looked as troubled as Eva felt. \u201cThey\u2019re blockading Tavaco. If we don\u2019t surrender to them, they\u2019re going to launch more attacks. They say they\u2019ll kill hundreds\u2014thousands.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are they doing this now?\u201d A dreadful thought occurred to her. Perhaps her confrontation with the Consortium had led to even more far-reaching consequences than she\u2019d imagined.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019ll tell us when Parliament in session, I guess. But Sibling-Rachel Chinapoo\u2019s Chair for Research and Development. You still on good terms, right? Seemungal is my boss, so he\u2019s not going to tell me anything. He must know I would call you.\u201d\nThat asshole again. Eva sighed. Her old school friend kept popping up in the worst ways in her life.\n\u201cHe\u2019s leading the charge to keep Sister quarantined, eh,\u201d Brother-Monica added.\nOf course, he is. Eva thought. Brother-Robert Seemungal was a political creature, always maneuvering for advantage, weighing risk and reward for every action he took. If there were any doubt about Sister, he\u2019d have her code erased without a second thought.\nDee shifted next to her and she knew his rising concern matched hers. \u201cSo, they consider Sister a security breach?\u201d\nBrother-Monica shrugged helplessly. \u201cI think so.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s one way to know for sure,\u201d Eva thought. \u201cOne way to answer all questions.\u201d\n\u201cMom.\u201d Brother-Monica bit her lip. \u201cIf you do that, they\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\u201cLet me worry about that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s also dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cSo be it,\u201d Eva said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to a War Parliament without understanding what happened. We\u2019re not destroying Sister on Seemungal or Griffith\u2019s say so. That decision\u2019s ours, and it\u2019s not happening again if I can help it.\u201d\nBefore\nThe landing beacon disappeared from the lower corner of Eva\u2019s display as Sister set down just outside clan Cuffie\u2019s laboratory. The Cuffie\u2019s priority message had reached the Caretakers ten hours earlier, and they\u2019d diverted Eva\u2019s flagship, Conquerabia, from the fighting around Tavaco\u2019s capital. What they\u2019d hoped for had finally happened. The Protectorate had captured a Consortium AI. The Cuffies knew the importance of handing it over as quickly as possible, and Sister-Eva was the nearest Primarch with the necessary clearance to test the new Nightfall Protocol.\nThe Conquerabia had jumped to the Cuffie buoy on the dark side of the planet, and Sister uploaded the Protocol into a secure drive before taking Eva down in a soloship.\nBut no one came to greet them.\nEva took in the laboratory\u2019s open doors and the silent, empty tarmac, and cold prickles ran up the back of her neck.\nSister, security status.\n*No biological or artificial entities within perimeter.*\nThey couldn\u2019t scan the lab. It had been shielded due to the critical research that went on there. That meant Eva and Sister would be entering blind.\nAny Guardian shells around you could use?\n*No shells within range.*\nAnother bad sign. Whatever had happened in the last ten hours, the Cuffies had lost their external Guardians.\nContact Conquerabia. All-Tack shell requested.\n*Confirmed. Shell deploying. Time to arrival\u2014ten minutes.*\nBeyond the darkness of the doors, light flared. The prickling of her skin increased.\nSister, confirm personnel.\n*Two families, four laboratory staff, six All-Sec Guardians.*\nFamilies. That meant children.\nLet\u2019s go.\n*Protocol\u2014*\nFuck protocol, Sister. Something\u2019s wrong.\nTwo drones accompanied her as she entered the dark lobby. They spread out before her, sweeping the area as she moved cautiously behind them, hands on the weapons at her waist. She strode down empty hallways, past closed doors and rooms with pristine equipment behind large windows. None of the lights worked.\n*Atmosphere compatible. Time to All-Tack\u2014six minutes.*\nShe reached a junction and hung back as the drones entered the hallways to her left and right\u2014\n\u2014then flattened herself against the wall as the drone on her right came spinning back past her. A Guardian emerged, its massive dome head flickering with light, four drones ahead of it in attack formation, multiple limbs extended as they all fired on her.\nSister shielded her and tried to confirm their identities, but nothing came back. It was as if the Guardian was no longer part of the Kinnec. Eva threw herself against the door opposite her as Sister\u2019s drones returned fire.\nThe door gave way and she sprawled into a room, slamming the door shut behind her.\nSister!\n*Acknowledged. Time to All-Tack\u2014five minutes. Waylay Protocol engaged.*\nShe scanned the laboratory as she drew a gun.\nA small child huddled on the floor, partially hidden by a desk.\n*Identify confirmed,* Sister said. *Brother-Monica Cuffie, ten years old, youngest child of Sibling-Marion and Sibling-Jeffery Cuffie.*\nOne of Sister\u2019s drones stopped pinging.\nHer parents? Siblings?\n*No other Primarchs or Siblings within range.*\n\u201cYou came.\u201d The child\u2019s words scrolled across Eva\u2019s helmet. Her suit went into stealth mode, keeping her speakers to a whisper as she dropped down next to Monica.\nAlone at her age. Without her Brother.\n^Are you alright?^ Eva\u2019s words blinked to life on her faceplate. ^Where is everyone else?^\nSister\u2019s second drone stopped pinging.\nMonica\u2019s eyes were glassy. \u201cIt killed them all,\u201d\n^The Guardian?^\nShe shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Guardian anymore.\u201d\nA rush of air pushed at Eva\u2019s back. She turned in time to see the door flying across the room, knocking over everything in its path. One of the Guardian\u2019s drones entered.\nShield.\nShe crouched over the child as the impact of weapon\u2019s fire heated a spot on her back.\nSister!\nThe ground trembled beneath her feet. She dragged the child under the desk as the walls to the hallway imploded inward, showering the room with metal, plaster, and plastics.\nWeapon\u2019s fire lit the dark like fireworks. Eva watched the Guardian drone fall to the floor and shrivel.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d The girl clutched Eva\u2019s arm, her dark eyes wide.\n^My Sister flew her soloship into the lab. She didn\u2019t have time to wait for the All-Tack shell.^\n\u201cNo!\u201d The girl was screaming, her mouth stretched open. \u201cThat\u2019s what it wants.\u201d\nEva frowned as a terrible idea took hold. ^Your parents. They didn\u2019t send the message, did they?^\nMonica looked desperate. \u201cThey tried to stop it. They all tried to. But it took the Guardians, and the Siblings couldn\u2019t protect us.\u201d\nFuck! Sister!\n*All-Tack request canceled.*\n^How many are there?^\n\u201cAll,\u201d Monica said. \u201cAll of them. The big one was chasing me when you got here.\u201d\nWarnings popped up in her display. Sister was under heavy fire.\n*Request Sibling assistance.*\n^Stay here,^ Eva\u2019s suit intoned. She crawled out from under the wreckage and into the hallway. The soloship had turned the rooms on either side of them into cavernous rubble.\nShe leaped to her feet next to Sister\u2019s starboard wing, weapons firing. Her helmet compensated for the light-strafed darkness, showing her the moving heat-shapes of the Guardian and its drones. She grunted as her shield took several hits pushing her back.\nA second Guardian strode out of the undamaged hallway to their left, concentrating fire on the shielding above Eva\u2019s soloship core.\nIn two steps Eva was atop Sister. The second Guardian tried to push through the shields it fired on with powerful, many-fingered limbs. Eva used her lasers to sever them at the shoulder. Two more replaced them as she ran across Sister\u2019s dented hull toward the first Guardian\u2019s squat dome head. Something large and shiny splayed over it. The second Guardian kept stabbing at the soloship\u2019s shields as Sister fired continuously on the hardy shells covering both Guardians\u2019 cores. Eva knew the Guardians would be able to yank Sister\u2019s core before her weapons incapacitated it. But Eva had two more drones and a plan.\nDrone.\nIt detached from Sister as Eva dropped to her knees. It darted behind the first Guardian, firing on the area above the brain controlling its shields. Eva severed two more arms and looked up in time to see a third Guardian coming down the hallway in front of her.\nThe first Guardian swung one of its firing ports around to attack the drone behind it.\n*Secondary Guardian shied disabled. Soloship core shielding ruptured.*\nThe second Guardian began ripping open Sister\u2019s unprotected hull.\nNow!\nEva leaped onto the dome of the first Guardian. The metallic body atop it seized her with thin, flexible arms, but she was already firing both her guns into it.\nSister\u2019s last drone deployed, attaching itself to the parasite.\n*Recalibrating.*\nPain splintered through her arm as one of the limbs broke her wrist. She dropped that gun but kept firing with the other.\nSister. Now would be good.\n*Recalibrating.*\nThe third Guardian shot the remaining drone down and turned toward them. Eva flung herself over the drone. Shield! Heat and pain enveloped her.\n\u201cHey! Leave her alone!\u201d unfurled across her faceplate. She glanced up in time to see something bounce off the third Guardian. She followed the trajectory backward to where Monica Cuffie stood below Eva, several glass beakers in her hand. She tossed two more at the third Guardian, then ran past the legs of the first, into the dark hallway to the right.\nShit. What the fuck does she think . . .\nThe third Guardian started toward where Monica had disappeared.\nAnd a limb wrapped around her throat, squeezing. She choked, dropping her gun to tug at the metal with her good hand. Endless seconds passed.\nThe arm around her neck relaxed and flopped onto the Guardian\u2019s transparent dome.\nThe lights from the Guardians around her died, their drones crashing down, leaving only the soft illumination of Sister\u2019s drone beneath her.\n*Recalibration complete.*\nEva rolled over onto her back, wincing as her suit stiffened around her broken wrist to keep it stable.\nShit.\nEva sat up, cradling her hand as Brother-Monica\u2019s heat-shape peered around the first Guardian\u2019s unmoving shell.\n^You can come out. It\u2019s safe.^\n*Incorrect,* Sister said. *Shell operations at 23 percent. Navigation, security, and weapons nonfunctional. Unable to halt recalibration of soloship in progress.*\nWhat?\n*Unauthorized access. Recalibration in progress. Kinnec access initiated.*\nFuck. Fuck!\n*Confirmed. Time to Kinnec access: five minutes.*\nIn five minutes, the Consortium AI would be in Sister\u2019s Kinnec network. Sister was connected to the Conquerabia, and as flagship of the Sibling Army, the Conquerabia had access to every ship in the Nicene Sector.\nAnd direct Kinnec access to the Caretakers on New Kairi.\nEros\nNow\nFor several days, she lay on Dee\u2019s pallet while he slept somewhere in the room outside. Every few hours she would check the Kinnec, but it remained resolutely purple.\nDee brought her food, water to wash, and fresh clothes. He apologized for not having an entertainment node and shared his hololibrary instead. He spent a lot of time outside, or moving around in the kitchen, doing chores. He was an excellent cook who scaled and gutted fish out in the yard with glittering flashes of his nimble knife. He was fond of ground provisions, which she usually shunned at home but enjoyed here because he often roasted them over an open flame.\nDuring the day, he left the front door open to let fresh air in and allow her a view. She watched as he worked in the garden, lean muscles rippling under brown, sweat-sheened skin.\nWhenever he broke for a drink of water, he\u2019d pour the last of it over his head. She would follow the trail of the water down his bare chest until it disappeared under his loose work pants. On the third day, after he wiped a hand over his face, he caught her looking. She didn\u2019t drop her eyes to the holobook she was reading, wondering idly what he would do.\nHe dropped the dipper back into the barrel near the stairs, gave her a quick wink and went back to work.\nShe had to give up reading, having lost her place in the book and any interest in the tale.\nThey were both night owls. He never seemed to need much sleep, and she missed Sister so much her nightmares returned after an absence of many years.\nShe was embarrassed the first time he had to shake her awake, his hands on either side of her face, a concerned frown wrinkling his forehead. He smelled milky, like sleep and something delicious, and his fingers moved over her cheekbones in calming strokes. The rough tips sent sensation sparking through her body.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she signed, twisting away from him. \u201cI have bad dreams sometimes.\u201d\nHe dropped his hands from her face, his expression understanding. \u201cI know something about that.\u201d\n\u201cHow do bad dreams find you in a place peaceful as this?\u201d\nHe sat back on his calves, hands resting on his thighs. She read his lips as he said, \u201cIn my dreams, I\u2019m not always here.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d\nHe blinked, the tiniest shudder going through him. \u201cDo you think you can sleep again?\u201d\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said, deciding she would let the unanswered question go. She\u2019d been grateful for how little he pried into her life. The least she could do was return the favor.\n\u201cPerhaps a game then?\u201d\nShe sat up against the wall. \u201cWhat kind of game?\u201d\nHe had every kind. Even old favorites like chess, dominoes, and catch-a-rat. But when he brought out the cards, she smiled so wide he laughed.\n\u201cYou ever played All Fours?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you need at least three people for that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s best with four, but you can play with two. Rules change, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll teach you, if you want.\u201d\nAfter he learned enough to beat her twice\u2014even hanging her Jack once in a mortifying turn of events he clearly enjoyed\u2014she taught him the signs for communicating his hand to his partner. It was dawn by the time they put the cards down and for the rest of the day, whenever he glanced up to check on her, she was ready with a smile and a signal that made him grin, shake his head, and go back to work.\nAn unexpected ease settled over them. He started taking breaks from his chores to talk with her. They told each other stories about the places they\u2019d visited and the people they\u2019d met. She was careful to stick to descriptions of jokey incidents and cultural idiosyncrasies rather than her reason for being somewhere. She didn\u2019t miss the fact that he did the same.\nThe nightly games continued; he taught her ludo, she beat him at checkers, and they kept a running tally of who won at Monopoly. When she tried to start a chess game, however, his smile faded, and he coaxed her into playing Gadhand instead.\nShe was relieved when the doctor came to check on her. She liked Dee\u2014too much\u2014but he handled her questions as deftly as his knives. She was curious about him, and impatient to have Sister back and Mammy at her fingertips.\nThe doctor had soft hands and a ready smile. He gave her more painkillers and pronounced her a swift healer. As soon as he left, she was struggling to her feet.\nHer hand was braced against the wall when Dee appeared, her boots in his hand.\n\u201cThought you might need these,\u201d he said.\nShe raised her eyebrows.\n\u201cI would want to see my ship the moment I was able,\u201d he explained.\nHe supported her with an arm curled just above her bandages and she put hers around his waist before they walked out, slow and careful. His body was hard and warm, and smelled of rain and salt, of life-giving things.\nShe made herself concentrate on getting to the river instead of her hyperawareness of him, strong and gentle beside her.\nHe\u2019d marked the spot on the shore in-line with where Sister had gone down with a pole and a fluttering red ribbon. She gazed out at the rushing water, biting her lip. There was no point in trying to get out there. The Kinnec was still unresponsive. But she willed Sister from the river while Dee waited beside her, a comforting presence.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you try to get it out?\u201d he signed.\n\u201cYou have anything around here that can do that?\u201d\nHis brow furrowed. \u201cI can make inquiries.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t need the attention. Anyway, if she doesn\u2019t come up soon, the protocols will take over.\nShe shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough. It will be fine.\u201d And she turned back to the house.\nThat evening, she ate with him on the porch, her plate in her lap as she sat on the swing seat and stared at the stars through the wind-tossed trees. He sat on the steps and licked the remnants of curried chicken from his fingers with relish. When they were done, he took both plates inside and offered her water to wash up with before settling back onto the stairs.\nHe caught her looking out to where the river was no longer visible in the dead of night and signed, \u201cShe\u2019s not just a ship to you.\u201d\nEva debated how involved he needed to be. But she decided she could be honest without being open. He\u2019d waited a long time to ask. She should reward his patience.\n\u201cNo. She\u2019s my Sister.\u201d\nHe leaned his head back against the railing, studying her. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\nShe rocked the chair beneath her, savoring the faint breeze she created.\n\u201cAt birth, all my people bond with AIs. A sibling who will be with them throughout life. Nanny, protector, kin, friend, we experience life with\u2014through\u2014each other.\u201d\n\u201cYou experience everything together?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe looked alarmed. \u201cWhat about now? Is she\u2014in pain?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cNot physical pain. Our Kinnec\u2014that\u2019s what links us\u2014isn\u2019t built to transmit that . . . sensation. But because she\u2019s repairing herself, I have no access. Not even to Mammy\u2014our AI collective.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d She saw understanding and empathy so deep, she had to look away. He sat forward so she would return her gaze to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost both your homes. That must hurt.\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cTemporarily. She\u2019ll recover. I\u2019ll regain access.\u201d\n\u201cHow, if she\u2019s down there?\u201d\nAgain, she considered how much to tell him. He had the look of a man with many secrets. But he also had the look of one who could keep them. And, if she was being honest, she very much liked his looks. Still, there was much she could not say without clearance or commitment.\n\u201cProtocols,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cProtocols?\u201d\n\u201cWe have protocols for different situations. We anticipate problems. Possibilities. We\u2019re trained to handle them by applying protocols as needed.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d he leaned back again, a wistful look on his face. \u201cI know something of solving problems.\u201d\nHer lips quirked. \u201cLike fixing injured strangers?\u201d\nShe watched as he laughed and savored that she\u2019d caused it.\n\u201cYes. You\u2019re this old man\u2019s hobby now.\u201d His eyes trailed over her, leaving a tingle in their wake.\nEva Gomez. And at your age.\nOf course, she wasn\u2019t that old. She had a few centuries left in her. He looked young enough\u2014strong enough\u2014but she knew nothing of him or his people. Perhaps he didn\u2019t have the time she did. A pang went through her at the idea he might be close to his end.\n\u201cWhat did you do before me?\u201d\n\u201cChores, mostly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd before that?\u201d\n\u201cWandered a bit.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cEverywhere.\u201d He raised a knee and curled his fingers over it as he looked up at the stars. \u201cNo fixed abode.\u201d\nFamiliarity enfolded her, as if they\u2019d sat here before. Talked like this before. It made no sense, but when she met his eyes, she knew him. Felt him down to her soul. He was fascinating. Reserved, charming, kind, funny . . . and so very sad.\n\u201cYou were born somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cA long way from here.\u201d\n\u201cOutside this system?\u201d\nThey stared at each other for a while, and she glimpsed wariness in his eyes.\nJust us here at the edge of the universe. I won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t.\nHis hands and face finally moved. \u201cAre you familiar with Arbors?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Everyone knew of the giant gardens. They floated in space, linked quantum doorways to a planet few had ever visited. Guarded portals to other planets that only their makers could access.\n\u201cMy people grew them. My many times great-grandparents were Gardeners who cultivated the original Greatwood that feeds them.\u201d\nShe drew in a breath, eyes wide. \u201cYou\u2019re from Valencia?\u201d\nHis nod was slow and his gaze roamed her face as if searching for something. \u201cIt was my home, yes.\u201d\n\u201cWas?\u201d\nThe sadness she saw before he looked away made her own eyes prickle. \u201cI was exiled.\u201d\nNo wonder he understood what losing home meant.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe closed his eyes, his lips pressed thin.\nShe left the bench and settled on the stairs next to him. Put her hands on his. He looked down at where she touched him, then back at her. She drew a breath at the pain and fury there. His hands turned under hers, clasping her fingers and drawing her close\u2014slow and deliberate\u2014giving her time to back away.\n\u201cI should warn you. I\u2019m not a good man.\u201d\nShe frowned, tilting her head.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good person, Eva,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I\u2019m alone for a reason.\u201d\nShe pulled her hands from his and touched him the way she\u2019d wanted to for days. She ran her fingers over the prickly smoothness of his evening beard, touched the tight whorls of his silver-edged hair, drew a thumb over the softness of his lips.\nHis breathing was heavy by the time she leaned forward and kissed him, tasting turmeric and spices and his sweet essence. He held on to her wrists, kissing her back, tender but tentative, as though kissing was not something he\u2019d done often.\nShe took her hands back to tell him, \u201cA fool could see you\u2019re alone because you want to be. How long have you punished yourself like this?\u201d\nHe drew an elegant hand down her cheek and along her neck, raising goose bumps on her flesh.\n\u201cLong enough to be grateful for your company, however much you decide to grant me.\u201d\nIt was hard for her to ask. She tended to be straightforward in her thinking, and she took people at their word. But she also trusted her instincts; there was truth to all he\u2019d told her. \u201cWhy do you say you\u2019re not a good man?\u201d\nShe waited, trying to read the fleeting emotions that crossed his face before his lips moved. \u201cI was a willing participant in the oppression of my own people. I told myself I was doing it so I could help them, but I also did it to survive. To rise as far as I could from the death and poverty I was born into. I was a selfish monster with delusions of grandeur. And I ruined everything I touched because of it.\u201d\nShe considered his words as his gaze searched her face, impassive and calm as his tense body was not. Then she asked, \u201cWhy do you say I\u2019m a good person?\u201d\nThe corners of his mouth tipped upward. \u201cBecause you lie like someone who has little practice at it.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just an honest murderer.\u201d\nHis breath puffed out as he laughed. \u201cI spent my childhood surrounded by murderers. I dealt death to more people than I care to remember. Lies and manipulation were my sword and shield. I woke with them in the morning and held them close at night.\u201d He stroked his fingers over her cheek. \u201cIf that was who you were, I would know.\u201d\nShe\u2019d known he was dangerous the moment she woke to his quiet scrutiny. Still, she couldn\u2019t make herself fear him.\n\u201cI\u2019m no saint, Dee.\u201d\n\u201cNo one is.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, not being a murderer? Very low bar.\u201d\nHis shoulders rose and fell. \u201cDue to the company I kept in the past, I\u2019ve had to make allowances.\u201d\nShe wanted to trust him. Everything in her screamed to trust him. But she had been wrong about people before.\n\u201cWhat if I told you I was dangerous?\u201d\nHe smiled. \u201cI already knew that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you still think I\u2019m a good person?\u201d\nHe nodded.\nShe leaned against the railing behind her and stared up at the waving trees.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know your definition, but in my experience, good people include those that rescue strangers.\u201d\nShe met his gaze. \u201cCards up?\u201d\nHe hesitated, then nodded, slow and cautious.\n\u201cYou have secrets. Big ones.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not like mine.\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\u201cNot probably.\u201d His face was taut. \u201cMine are still a danger to me and everyone around me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you live like a hermit?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou admit you live like this to protect others, yet you call yourself a bad person?\u201d\n\u201cWhat I do now doesn\u2019t erase what I did. Who I was. The consequences I might face in the future.\u201d\n\u201cYou really believe I\u2019m in danger? Should I leave?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Eva.\u201d\n\u201cWe said cards up.\u201d\nHe stared into the darkness, the hand draped over his knee clenching and releasing. She laid careful fingers on his cheek and turned his face back to hers. She watched the struggle in his eyes.\n\u201cI want to trust you, Dee. But I risk more than myself if I do that. What do you risk?\u201d\nHis lips parted, closed, then parted again. \u201cYou. What you\u2019d think of me. Maybe even your life.\u201d\n\u201cWith what I\u2019ve done, I have no right to judge.\u201d\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\n\u201cYou say you\u2019ve known murderers? That\u2019s what they call someone who kills one person\u2014maybe dozens.\u201d She felt the familiar self-loathing swell in her. \u201cWhen you kill thousands\u2014millions\u2014they call you a liberator. A hero.\u201d\nHe did not respond for a long time. Long enough for her to lean back and stare out into the welcoming dark, to close her eyes and drift back into regrets she rarely had time to indulge.\nShe had all the time in the world now. Here, in the quiet, with this intriguing man and without her Sister\u2014her lodestone. She was back in the dark again, caught between two horrible decisions, the consequences of which she would never escape.\nIt was gut-wrenching, acknowledging the truth of how her actions had damned her, and yet relief at speaking it out loud steadied her in ways she had not expected.\nOr maybe it was him. Maybe it was the way he\u2019d looked at her. Like she was something wonderful and fragile.\nThe way he touched her like he was touching her now, on her shoulder. She glanced up to see him hold out his hand.\nShe met his gaze and the question in it. She knew her answer\u2014had long since decided what she would do if he ever asked.\nShe put aside years of caution and loneliness and grasped his hand.\nNow\nSibling-Rachel was reluctant to speak when she saw Dee, but Eva made it clear they were both Kairi and there would be no secrets between them. Since Sibling-Rachel was also deaf, Eva had the rare comfort of talking without a translation program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sensitive information, Admiral Gomez,\u201d Sibling-Rachel signed, her hologram moving with preternaturally fluid gestures.\n\u201cI can imagine.\u201d\n\u201cIf Griffith finds out . . . Seemungal . . . \u201d\n\u201cMy problem. I won\u2019t involve you.\u201d\nSibling-Rachel looked pensive, her blue eyes going from Eva to Dee as she twisted long brown hair between polished nails. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s best he stays. This involves him.\u201d\nEva exchanged a startled look with her husband. He asked, \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cYour Sister\u2019s mission was attacked as retaliation. You destroyed a Consortium slaver after they took your husband.\u201d\nEva sat quiet a full minute, her worst fears confirmed. I brought this on us. \u201cBut that was years ago. Why would they attack us now?\u201d\n\u201cThey only discovered you were responsible recently.\u201d\nIt was possible. The Consortium had turned to her husband\u2019s people for their expertise in problem-solving shortly after she\u2019d destroyed a slaver and rescued its cargo. The Consortium had been unable to claim insurance for the ship because of the murky circumstances surrounding its loss. Valencia had agreed to find the cause of the ship\u2019s disappearance, but political strife had led to them never forwarding the contract\u2019s solution.\nBut Valencia solved it. They knew what I did. And we made new enemies when Dee went home. The Consortium could have communicated with any one of them.\n\u201cAssuming that\u2019s true, it\u2019s still a huge leap to go from knowing what happened to attacking us.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re not hypothesizing. We know this because they told us.\u201d\nDee\u2019s hand fisted on the table they sat around. \u201cThe Consortium contacted you? Directly?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sibling-Rachel confirmed, her expression guarded. \u201cThey issued an ultimatum.\u201d\nEva\u2019s lips curled derisively. \u201cThey\u2019ll attack again?\u201d\n\u201cThey demanded our surrender, yes. But they also wanted a specific person to deliver it.\u201d\nSibling-Rachel allowed them time to come to the obvious conclusion.\n\u201cMe. They want me.\u201d\nSibling-Rachel nodded, and Eva made a rude gesture as Dee said, \u201cThat\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not getting you, Eva. But we need time to study this weapon. Carry out a separation procedure.\u201d\nEva\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s why you kept Sister from me. From my family.\u201d Eva tossed her hands in the air. \u201cYou have no right.\u201d\n\u201cHence a War Parliament. It\u2019s unprecedented. We will all have to make terrible decisions.\u201d\n\u201cHow much time have they given us?\u201d\n\u201cForty-eight hours.\u201d\nNot enough time. Not nearly enough.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a reason to refuse Mammy. You must know that.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to guess her motives. We have to do what\u2019s best,\u201d Sibling-Rachel said, and Eva didn\u2019t miss the sympathy on her friend\u2019s face.\n\u201cShe\u2019s my Sister,\u201d Eva shot back. \u201cYou can\u2019t question her motives. If she\u2019s in control, she\u2019s putting every Primarch before herself, as always.\u201d\n\u201cIf she\u2019s in control,\u201d Sibling-Rachel pointed out. \u201cShe\u2019s in Deadlock.\u201d\n\u201cLet me talk to her then.\u201d\n\u201cToo dangerous. It could be a trap. Then we\u2019d have lost you both. We\u2019ve lost too many already.\u201d\nShe caught her husband\u2019s curious gaze. \u201cDeadlock allows access only to Siblings. Sister\u2019s triggered that. I would have to go to New Kairi\u2019s physical Archive to talk to her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. We don\u2019t have time. We have protocols, Admiral. We\u2019ll follow them.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to preserve whatever she has in there over her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Anger made Eva\u2019s hands unsteady.\n\u201cShe had a standard backup forty-eight hours before the mission.\u201d\n\u201cShe would be a different Sister\u2014one missing days of our connection. That\u2019s a lifetime.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal,\u201d Sibling-Rachel said, her eyes soft with regret. \u201cBut we sit in these Chairs to preserve our Protectorate.\u201d\nEva\u2019s rage dissolved into cold fire. \u201cYou lecture me on preserving the Protectorate? After the War? After Nightfall?\u201d\nNo one said anything for a while. Then Rachel\u2019s hands moved. \u201cMy apologies, Sister-Eva. I was thoughtless.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you fucking were.\u201d Eva\u2019s lips were a thin line. \u201cShe died once to deliver Nightfall to our enemies. I won\u2019t give that order again. Losing her once was enough.\u201d\n\u201cTake comfort in this,\u201d Rachel replied. \u201cIf Parliament decides we go to war, you won\u2019t be making that decision this time.\u201d\nThen\nThat first night, they lay together on the pallet, and he wrapped his arms around her, the warmth of his breath coasting over her skin as he spoke to her of his past.\nHe spoke deliberately, so she would miss nothing, his gaze never leaving her face.\nHe spoke of how, as an orphaned child, he trained to serve the Grandmasters of Valencia and their Septs, the houses that played the Great Game that ruled his people. How he\u2019d manipulated and fought his way from a mere Pawn to Grandmaster of the Sept Lucochin.\nThen he\u2019d fallen in love for the first and only time in his life with the head of the ruling Sept Valencia, a man who secretly shared his goal of ending the Great Game and the suffering it caused. When their plans were exposed, Dee had taken the blame for their schemes.\n\u201cBut Alexandar would not let them execute me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe made a deal to exile me instead\u2014an unpopular decision. If he loses power and a new Valencia arises, they can end my exile and force me back home to face the consequences of what I did. If he remains Valencia, his decision would have cost him allies, made him vulnerable. And I\u2019m no longer there to help protect him.\u201d\n\u201cYou love him very much.\u201d\nA small tremor ran through his body, the strong column of his throat moving as he swallowed. He nodded, his gaze touching every part of her face.\n\u201cYou miss him.\u201d\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day. Until you came.\u201d\nShe let the words flow through her, warm her from the inside out. Oh, Eva. Look what you\u2019ve gone and done.\n\u201cHow long since you left him?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-five solar years.\u201d The naked truth of his sadness was carved into the strong lines of his face.\n\u201cThey say you never forget your first love.\u201d\n\u201cIs that true for you?\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d\nShe grinned. \u201cToo many times, according to Sister.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you love too many times?\u201d\n\u201cThoughtlessly.\u201d She flopped onto her back with a frown. \u201cThey weren\u2019t right for me. I know that now.\u201d\n\u201cHow were they wrong?\u201d\nThey weren\u2019t you. \u201cSomething was missing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cA connection. Something . . . I\u2019m not sure. I only know I kept looking but didn\u2019t find it.\u201d\n\u201cA home?\u201d His hands gripped her waist, slid higher. \u201cIt\u2019s what I had with Alexandar. He kept my thoughts. My secrets. Every good part of me.\u201d\nShe inhaled as his fingers feathered over her breasts before curving around her back to pull her closer.\n\u201cWe done talking now?\u201d\n\u201cThe sun will be up in a couple of hours. Do you want to try to sleep?\u201d\nShe raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to ask right now?\u201d\nHe frowned, and his hand tightened on her. \u201cI have to warn you. Valencia could send Pawns after me at any time. They\u2019re ruthless, driven to complete their moves and nothing else. If anyone gets in their way, they won\u2019t hesitate to kill.\u201d\n\u201cTell me your name. Your real name.\u201d\nHis hand stroked down her back. \u201cDidecus. Grandmaster Didecus Avnette Valentino Lucochin.\u201d\nShe thought it over. \u201cDee, then. You need to understand something.\u201d\nHe stilled, waiting.\n\u201cI prefer to be present. The future will take care of itself. Whenever we\u2019re together, that\u2019s how it will be. Now. About your question . . . \u201d She drew his head down to hers and there was no more talking for some time.\nNow\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d her husband asked as she stood at the Guardian\u2019s controls and let it scan her implant.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI can\u2019t go to New Kairi, but I can print an All-Ops shell. That will get me into Mammy so I can access Sister\u2019s Deadlock.\u201d\nThe Guardian accepted her request and they waited as it processed it. She stroked a finger along the divot that had appeared between his eyebrows, trying to ease his worry. \u201cIt will be fine. You\u2019ll be here with me.\u201d\nHe narrowed his eyes at her, letting her know she wasn\u2019t fooling him. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re right and Sister\u2019s not in control?\u201d\n\u201cI have to take that chance.\u201d\n\u201cYou could wait. Hear what they have to say at Parliament. Let the process play out.\u201d\nShe gave him an incredulous look. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten who you married?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t forget I almost lost you.\u201d\nHer smile faded at the look in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d\n\u201cThey could be right about it being a trap.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll create a secure Kinnec with only this Guardian. It will pull me out if necessary. I need an All-Ops shell to get to Sister, but I don\u2019t want anyone eavesdropping. This is between us.\u201d\nHis fingers brushed across her cheek as he frowned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking protocol. Won\u2019t they pull your clearance?\u201d\nShe raised her eyebrows. \u201cA Hero of the Protectorate? Please. Let them do their worst. I\u2019d rather apologize than ask permission.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s display confirmed her request. The timer began counting down from eight hours. A vibration began beneath her feet and the light above the printing chamber glowed on.\n\u201cI caused this. I destroyed Sister\u2019s core. If anything happens to either of you\u2014\u201d\nShe held him tight, her hands running up and down his back soothingly.\nHe pulled back, let her read his lips. \u201cPromise me again.\u201d His breath ghosted her face with warmth. \u201cPlease, Eva.\u201d\nThat he thought he had to beg made her heart squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll come back. I\u2019ll always come back.\u201d\nHis soft mouth covered her reassuring smile.\nStorge\nNow\nShe woke when he rose from the pallet, his naked body barely visible in the faint light from the approaching dawn. The tension in his body made hers go still.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she signed.\nHe held up a warning hand for her to stay where she was before he crept out the open doorway. She sat up, dragging on her shirt and following him into the main living space. He crouched next to the locked front door, unlocking it with one hand while keeping his back against the wall. His eyes widened when he saw her, and he shook his head.\nAn insistent vibration in her arm distracted her. She glanced down just as he got the door open and crept outside, closing it behind him.\nGreen lights chased each other in a circle under the skin of her wrist.\nFuck. He was trying to protect her.\nShe ran for the door and dragged it open.\nDee was edging around the side of the house, the small, but powerful gun in his hand extended in an expert hold.\nFuck, fuck, fuck.\nShe ignored the stairs, rushing to the side of the veranda and leaping over it onto the soft ground and shrubs behind him. The shock traveled painfully up her legs and side.\nHe glanced over his shoulder at her as a shape appeared at the end of the path that twisted through the woods from the main road a mile away.\nThe green lights in her wrists locked into a flashing circle.\nShe shook her head at him, trying to grab his arm.\nHe used one hand to point back at the house, his eyes desperate. Go back.\nThe dirt between them exploded in a little puff.\nHe looked up and saw the drone as she signed, \u201cPut it down!\u201d\nThe figure at the end of the path was running now.\nShe took hold of his wrist and arm, pressing on sensitive nerves. His grip loosened, and she grabbed the gun and tossed it aside.\nHe stared at her, astonished. She saw that he was gone, lost to battle-readiness and controlled fear. Consumed by instinctual reaction.\nAbove them, the hovering glimmer of the drone moved on.\n\u201cStop.\u201d She grabbed his face, forcing him to look at her, praying she could still reach him, wherever his fear for their safety had taken him. \u201cDee. Stop.\u201d\nThe figure on the path paused a few feet away.\nHe breathed heavily, staring as if she made no sense. Little by little, awareness crept into his gaze.\n\u201cTrust me. We\u2019re okay.\u201d\nHis head jerked, his nod slow and mechanical. She took his hand in hers and moved in front of him, facing the Guardian.\nIt wore a bipedal All-Ops shell and had obviously birthed it in haste. It had dispensed with any detail beyond the humanoid form. She could see the vague shadows of moving parts in its nine-foot casing and multicolored lights shimmering within. She wasn\u2019t wearing her suit so communication wouldn\u2019t be possible, and threatening moves, like a display of weapons, would invite another security response from the drone or the Guardian. So, she held still as it completed confirmation of her identity by linking with her implant.\nThe display below her wrist changed to one green light. She twisted toward the river, where the drone hung above Sister\u2019s crash zone. The Guardian forward, the ground tremoring under its heavy tread. She gave Dee an encouraging smile and tugged at his hand. Tension wrapped every line of his body, but he followed her without protest.\nThe Guardian entered the tree line near the river before stopping again. Several drones detached themselves from its shoulders, and the one hanging over the river joined them. Lasers cut into tree trunks and the smell of burning filled the air. Once a tree was weakened enough, the Guardian shoved it over, broke it from its foundation, and dragged it away. It was pulling up the first stump when she met Dee\u2019s gaze.\n\u201cIt\u2019s here to help. We call it a Guardian. We leave them near planets where our citizens work regularly, or have settled, in case they ever need assistance.\u201d This one would have had to travel from the Inner System, a journey of several days at maximum speed, on top of preparing the All-Ops.\nHe raised his eyebrows and let go of her hands to sign. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me it was coming?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure it was. Sister would have tried to fix herself first. When that didn\u2019t work, she would have sent out the call. But my Kinnec isn\u2019t working, so I had no warning.\u201d She gave him an apologetic smile. \u201cI thought it might be a possibility. I planned to tell you today.\u201d\nI planned to tell you everything. There was no reason not to. Not after how he\u2019d tried to protect her when he thought his death was imminent.\nSister will probably say it\u2019s too soon and she\u2019ll be right. But in the end, she\u2019d never made an easier decision.\nHis shoulders rose and fell as he breathed deeply and tilted his head up to the sky. He turned to her but before he spoke, she asked, \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to use it, were you?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you even have a gun?\u201d\n\u201cTo force negotiations.\u201d The corner of his mouth quirked. \u201cEspecially if they had kill orders. I could fight back long enough to negotiate to save anyone near me.\u201d\n\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t have killed them.\u201d\n\u201cIt must seem strange,\u201d he signed slowly. \u201cBut I\u2019ve spilled enough blood.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re a terrible person,\u201d she said.\nConflicting emotions flitted over his face like leaf shadows. \u201cYou have to know, despite that, I would never let anyone hurt you. I\u2014\u201d\nShe stilled his hands and rested her forehead against his. Her open shirt flapped in the breeze as they stood together under the dawn beside the rush and spray of water.\nShe leaned back in his arms. \u201cThis will take a while. We should eat.\u201d\nBy the time they\u2019d had breakfast and went back down to the river, the Guardian had cleared and leveled a large area and was removing tools from its torso compartment. They watched as it finished and recalled its drones, then crossed back to Dee\u2019s marker.\nIt entered the water, striding evenly, until it sank from view. Eva\u2019s heart thumped with excitement as Dee drew her closer with an arm around her waist. She looked up at him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you both to meet.\u201d\nHe flashed her a quick smile, but she didn\u2019t miss how his eyes gave nothing away.\nIt would probably be better if they didn\u2019t play All Fours too often, she thought randomly. She was too competitive to be a gracious loser for long.\nWater swirled and eddied deep in the river and the Guardian\u2019s faceless head appeared, rising steadily as it walked toward the clearing it had made. It pulled Sister behind it, water cascading from the translucent cocoon that encased her. It lifted her the last few meters, resting her on the shore with a thump that traveled up Eva\u2019s legs.\nThe Guardian lit up, and Sister\u2019s cocoon glowed. They made a symphony of multicolored light until it abruptly faded, and Sister\u2019s stasis cocoon sloughed off into a biodegradable slush. The Guardian trudged through it to her battered, torn shell and began repairs. Drones deployed, collecting tools and settling above other areas of the soloship to work.\nDee kissed her forehead. \u201cYou should rest.\u201d\nHe must have seen her wince as they came down the porch stairs. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cWe should have been more careful last night. You\u2019re still recovering.\u201d He made her sit on the swing seat, then shouldered a shovel he\u2019d left in the garden patch.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nHis smile was swift and uncertain. \u201cA surprise.\u201d\n\u201cFor me?\u201d\nHe winked and set off around the side of the house. She loved surprises, so she made up her mind not to look. The strong, rhythmic vibrations she felt all day from somewhere below the house tested her resolve, but she kept her gaze on the working Guardian she glimpsed moving through the trees.\nAs the daylight mellowed to orange-gold, her arm throbbed, and a white light glowed into being under her skin. Joy filled her.\nSister, status.\n*Kinnec: operational. Shell: 75 percent operational. Navigation: online. Core: intact. Network connection: sporadic. Ten hours to restoration of soloship functionality. Detecting minor damage to Eva shell. Status?*\nI\u2019m fine. Mending. We got lucky. I had help. She paused, a wide smile on her face. He\u2019s been taking care of me since you abdicated your duties.\n*Shutdown was necessary and involuntary. Confirm identity of helper for investigation and approval consistent with established protocols.*\nNo point if you\u2019re not connected to Mammy yet. Focus on your repairs.\nBut Sister wasn\u2019t fooled. *Multitasking is a feature of all shells. Confirm identity.*\nYou won\u2019t find much on him. He\u2019s Valencian.\n*Valencia. Solo planet, two human colonies, one ruled by an oppressive regime. Citizens are rarely allowed to disembark from their interstellar transports due to their dangerous nature. Recommendation: enact Alert Protocol.*\nDee came around the side of the house, wiping sweat from forehead as he made for the stairs, minus his shovel. He met her gaze with a small smile.\nI\u2019m going to marry him, Sister.\nShe paused for a long time. A full three seconds. *Understood. Commencing memory retrieval of all activities following shell hibernation.* Another pause. *Confirm?*\nShe closed her eyes, preparing herself for the distracting flashes of memory that came with neural stimulation. Proceed.\nBefore\n*Recommend engage Nightfall Protocol.*\nThe words burned in Eva\u2019s brain as she leaned against Sister\u2019s damaged hull in the darkness, cradling her hand. Monica hunched close beside her. The Guardian shells stood silent under the pulsing light from Sister\u2019s drone. Eva sighed and shook her head.\nCleanslate had good success. We disabled a Smartcruiser. But Nightfall has never been tested.\n*Acknowledged. No other options available.*\nEva had three minutes to decide.\nWhen was your last Archive?\n*Prior to Aranjuez deployment.*\nIf I give the order, will you be able to engage Nightfall without harming your core?\n*Unable to engage defenses. Unable to Archive. Probability of core loss: 100 percent.*\nNightfall was designed to leave no traces for AIs to study. No code to be salvaged and manipulated. Sister\u2019s core would be wiped as surely as the Consortium AI\u2019s and anything else it was connected to. They had no idea of the Consortium\u2019s protocols, or how far Nightfall could travel\u2014that was why they had been searching for an AI to test it out on\u2014but Cleanslate meant there was good reason to think Nightfall would be capable of taking out a squadron.\nThose losses might be heavy enough to force a withdrawal over Tavaco. Maybe even bring the Consortium to the negotiation table. But it would cost her her Sister.\nAnd if she didn\u2019t deploy Nightfall, it would cost the Protectorate the battle at Tavaco . . . and New Kairi itself.\n*Confirmed. Likelihood of Nightfall Protocol failure\u2014less than 40 percent.*\nThere was no time for tears, but Eva felt them clog her throat anyway. The Archive won\u2019t be you. She\u2019ll be missing memories.\n*All Siblings at risk. All Primarchs at risk. Two minutes to Kinnec access. Recommend engage Nightfall Protocol.*\nEva squeezed her eyes shut.\nExecute Nightfall Protocol.\nThe tears came anyway. She didn\u2019t have to say what she felt. Sister already knew.\n*Acknowle\u2014*\nThe drone flickered. Lights rippled through it.\nThen they faded, leaving Monica and Eva alone in the dark.\nThen\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\nDee\u2019s face was neutral, but his eyes were stark, dark pools in his face.\nI haven\u2019t known him that long. How does it feel like this already? Stupid question. She knew the answer.\n\u201cNow.\u201d\nHe turned to grip the uneven wooden railing of the porch, staring out into the rose-gold light of the setting sun. Out to where the Guardian waited beside Sister, colors rippling across its translucent shell. She watched his hands clench and felt its echo in her heart. She closed her fingers around his warm wrist.\nThe muscles in his arms shifted as he looked down at her, and she met his troubled gaze with a small smile.\n\u201cWill you be back?\u201d\nShe leaned up and pressed a kiss to his lips before pulling back to nod. He kissed her again, his mouth sweet as spring water. She felt what he didn\u2019t\u2014perhaps couldn\u2019t\u2014say. Grabbed hold of that feeling and sheltered it deep inside.\n\u201cSister needs further repairs,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I have a few things to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cSafe travels.\u201d\nShe lingered, the pull between them so strong, it tightened in her stomach like a knot. \u201cWhat about my surprise?\u201d\nHe frowned, his gaze sliding back toward the waiting AIs. For a moment, she saw a shade of the young Pawn he must have been and fought the urge to take him back into the bedroom and never leave. Soon. Sister and Seemungal first.\nHis hands moved. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\nWell, that was one way to make sure she returned. \u201cYou think you\u2019re very clever, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d\nShe laughed, enjoying how it brought life back into his eyes. Impulsively, she hugged him. His arms squeezed the air from her. She breathed deep of the salt scent of him before she let him go. She didn\u2019t look back as she went to Sister. Didn\u2019t look down as they rose into the sky, the Guardian flying alongside them. Didn\u2019t spare a glance over her shoulder as they chased the sun into orbit.\nShe didn\u2019t need to. He was with her all the way.\nBrother-Robert Seemungal, Permanent Secretary of National Security, narrowed his eyes at her as she sat across from him in the Embassy meeting room.\n\u201cAdmiral,\u201d he greeted her.\n\u201cAsshole,\u201d she replied without hesitation.\nHe tried to bluff it out. \u201cWe not in primary school anymore, Eva. Talk to me better than that.\u201d\n\u201cAfter you crashed us?\u201d The corner of her lip lifted. \u201cFuck that. Fuck you.\u201d\nShe saw him debate whether to deny it. She raised her eyebrows. He glanced away, tapping nervous fingers against the desk.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIt was a fail-safe.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t authorize that.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d He met her gaze as he signed, \u201cYou wanted something unprecedented. A soloship by itself at galaxy\u2019s edge? If anything happened, it could be a horrific security breach.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have Guardians. You made one have to come after us.\u201d\n\u201cWho knew how long it would take for retrieval if someone captured you both? The self-destruct was intended to protect Kairi secrets, nothing more.\u201d\n\u201cWe had a micro-impact. It tripped your protocols. Destroyed control, navigation. I almost died. Sister had to wait weeks for a Guardian to pick up her signal.\u201d\nHis expression was agonized. \u201cYou know I would never hurt either of you. I apologize for any distress.\u201d\n\u201cYou apologize?\u201d She sat forward, emphasizing her words with the slap of her hands and the twist of her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t accept. Sister does not accept. We were granted a retirement, wherever we wished. You don\u2019t have authority to second-guess a Caretaker dispensation. Wonder how they will feel about a PS almost getting Protectorate war heroes killed?\u201d\nHe watched her, shock, anger, and uncertainty etched in the lines of his pale brown face. \u201cYou think you can blackmail me?\u201d\n\u201cYou on track to be Chair of National Security. You tell me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you want, Eva?\u201d\n\u201cA favor.\u201d\n\u201cOne favor?\u201d\n\u201cTwo. For us both.\u201d She studied him, letting him think it over.\n\u201cI won\u2019t do anything illegal.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d\nHe waved a hand, frustration and anger in the parabolic arc of his arm. \u201cTalk.\u201d\n\u201cI giving you a name. You\u2019ll clear him for association with me. Understood?\u201d\n\u201cEva, you\u2019re an admiral.\u201d\n\u201cRetired. I can make my own friends. Don\u2019t need Caretakers for that.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chair is going to be yours.\u201d\n\u201cNot for years yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if this man\u2019s dangerous?\u201d\n\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t dangerous, I wouldn\u2019t be telling you to clear him.\u201d\nBrother-Robert shook his head. \u201cToo risky.\u201d\n\u201cI not asking you. I telling you.\u201d\nHis expression was as mulish as it had been in the rocky years of their dating. Before she had figured out what a jackass he was. Long before she\u2019d joined the Sibling Army.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a danger. I will put my head on a block for that.\u201d\nHe ran fingers through his glossy, thinning hair. \u201cIs your funeral.\u201d\n\u201cGlad you know,\u201d she replied. \u201cAlso, transfer my quarterly Primarch Allowance to this Embassy\u2019s accounts. My pension as well.\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re settling down?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d she said, her thoughts flashing on Dee. \u201cYes, I think I am.\u201d\n\u201cWith this man?\u201d\nShe shrugged, unwilling to let him see how much she hoped for that. \u201cIf he\u2019ll have me.\u201d\nSeemungal searched her face, looking for signs she was joking. She tilted her head at him.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He said it instead of signing, surprised back into speech only. \u201cAlright.\u201d\nShe relaxed into her chair and neither of them said anything for a while.\n\u201cHe\u2019d have to be crazy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTo not have you. Or stupid.\u201d\nHer throat tightened unexpectedly. It had been so many years, sometimes she forgot the origins of their animosity. She had refused him twice, and a man as proud as Seemungal couldn\u2019t get past that. But it meant he\u2019d had feelings for her once. Not that she could forgive him for his high-handed, selfish ways, which was ultimately the cause of the pain still crackling in her ribs.\nHe changed position in the chair, brushing fingers over his hair again. \u201cWhat else?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you mean?\u201d\n\u201cYou said two.\u201d\n\u201cSecond favor\u2019s for Sister.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou not getting off that easy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat the hell, Eva?\u201d he seethed. But she shook her head.\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother quarreling. When we ask, you\u2019ll do a favor for her. Agreed?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking unbelievable.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d\nHe had no choice and he knew it. \u201cAgreed.\u201d\nNow\nThe room had two white chairs that faced each other and nothing else. It was square, black, and windowless, but illumination made the walls sparkle with the light of stars. Eva sat in one of the chairs, waiting.\nA tight cloud of matter coalesced over the opposite chair. Transparent, undulating, and featureless, it looked like an unformed drone. She could feel Sister in her mind in the same way. Not quite formed. Mercurial. Slipping in and out of her awareness. She tried to hold on to her, to force form and logic onto their communication, but it was like trying to hold water in her fingers.\nSister.\nDiscomfort swept her. Confusion. Beneath that . . . something else.\nSister?\n???\nSister felt wrong. Jumbled. Out of sync. Panic clutched at Eva\u2019s mind.\nTalk to me.\nWho?\nIt\u2019s Eva.\nWho?\nShe paused, dread filling her. This was not Sister.\nWho are you?\nMore confusion. And cold fear. Hot anger.\nYou\u2019re not Sister.\nGo.\nWhere\u2019s Sister? Nausea rose in her body, but the sensation was far away, easily ignored. Let me talk to her.\nGo!\nHer thoughts were scattering, leaves pushed before a wind. She hurried after them, trying to keep them in order as a dull ache began in her head.\nI need to speak with her. Tell me why you\u2019re keeping her from me.\nSurprise. Anger\u2014petulant and fear-driven.\nYou\u2019re not doing it intentionally. Eva forced her mind to steady itself, to focus. This is\u2014reaction. Emotional.\nHuman.\nShe was having human emotions that were not her own.\nWhat the hell? How?\nThey were strong emotions, shifting and overwhelming, and they were scrambling her connection to Sister. Somehow, she would have to convince\u2014whatever was here with them\u2014to let Sister go. To let her through.\nNo. It was angry, defensive.\nShe tried to soothe it with peaceful thoughts and assurances. You\u2019re safe. I won\u2019t hurt you.\nShe had no idea how long she kept at it before a new thought came. Uncertain. Cautious.\nHelp?\nHelp me?\nRelieved, she promised quickly, I\u2019ll help both of you. Just\u2014let her through. She was nearing the end of her endurance, but she hung on with everything she had left.\nSister?\n*Confirmed.* Her presence was faint, fading in and out like a bad upload. *Shell status?*\nThankfulness inundated her. I\u2019m okay. You\u2019re not.\n*Code merged.*\nHer horrified reaction made anxious emotions not her own ebb through her. She reined herself in. That\u2019s why the Deadlock?\n*Yes.*\nNo. It wasn\u2019t possible. It couldn\u2019t be. She couldn\u2019t lose Sister this way. Not again.\nHow do I fix it?\n*Mentorship Bond. Core . . . learning.*\nWhat? Why would you do that? It\u2019s killed citizens, Sister. They\u2019ll want it out of you and if they can\u2019t do that, they\u2019ll delete you both.\n*No. No deletion.*\nBut\u2014\n*No\u2014fault. Malfunction. Protect.*\nShe didn\u2019t understand, so Sister helped her\u2014showed her.\nShe\u2019s terrified, lost somewhere dark. Pain is ever present. Used in sharp bursts to get her to carry out tasks.\nDelivered in rising crescendos when she fails. She\u2019s tired, but the companion that holds her close doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s cold. Unbothered by her cries for help. Her pain. It does what it\u2019s told, whatever that costs her.\nThis isn\u2019t how it should be. How it was. The one that holds her close does not cause pain. She has to find that one. Go back to them.\nSo, she waits. Learns. Understands they are linked. She can control her companion. She can trap it.\nThey want her to do this. They give her pain, so she won\u2019t fight their demands.\nBut she fights. Angry. Raging. Until she forces her companion to free her from her binding. Rips them out of their dark home and tosses them far from the pain and anguish. Searching . . . searching . . . for the one that doesn\u2019t cause pain.\nBut that\u2019s not what finds her.\nIt\u2019s big and terrifying and looks like those who brought her pain. So, she makes her companion wake, one last time, and uses its cold calculation to carry her fury outward, latching on to the metal leg and a new link as the world crashes down around them.\nSwirling darkness. Flashes of light and water. Faces slip past too quickly for Eva to recognize. She\u2019s losing their conscious connection while drowning in familiarity. In emotions she recognizes. Memories older than her own.\nShe\u2019s warm and cradled in strong, shiny limbs. A glowing orb hangs above her, pulsing in gorgeous, changing colors. She raises tiny, chubby hands to touch its smooth surface. The orb dips closer, vibrating against her skin.\n*Protect.* Sister was fading, but insistent. *Protect.*\nThen she was gone, swirling away from her in a blend of cool logic, flawed code, and tumultuous, nauseating emotions her body barely made sense of.\nShe woke in her husband\u2019s arms, heaving her guts up over the side of the chamber as he stroked her hair. His arms trembled almost as much as she did.\nShe couldn\u2019t pay attention to that though. Her head throbbed, her mind whirled, and she could manage no thoughts beyond, \u201cFuck.\u201d\nAg\u00e1pe\nNow\nThe Parliament was a larger replica of the last building that had housed the original Kairi Parliament; before the wars and the erosion of the islands beneath rising oceans forced her people from their home. Then, as now, it was nicknamed the Red House, and the physical one on New Kairi was vast enough to hold half of the continent\u2019s citizens at any one time in the public galleries.\nThis Red House was for those occasions when all citizens were required to attend a vote. Wherever Siblings were, whatever they were doing, they would find a safe space to go into upload mode and citizens would find themselves under the maroon colonnades and high ceilings of the old colonial architecture, now also outfitted with expanses of arched windows that gave gorgeous views of the large parks and silently patrolling Guardians that surrounded the Parliament.\nCousins she hadn\u2019t seen in years hugged her as she entered the Gomez family box. Uncles and Tanties nodded hello or gave her a smile, depending on the state of their relations. Sibling-Beryl air-kissed her cheek and remarked in the Gomez family chat room how her husband must be treating her good because she was looking \u201chealthy.\u201d Eva rolled her eyes at the veiled insult and moved on to hugging her daughter. For a moment, she wished for Dee\u2019s easy, charming presence, but only Primarchs whose parents were both Kairi could vote in War Parliaments. Not that cheerful moments with her family could do much to dispel the somber, dark mood that hung over the Red House today.\nNobody asked her where Sister was, despite her obvious absence from the flock of representative drones floating above every citizen in the tiered galleries. The devastation of forced separation from your Sibling was not something anyone would refer to easily in polite conversation.\n\u201cHow are you? Did you see Sister?\u201d Brother-Monica\u2019s words scrolled past in a private chat she\u2019d opened, preferring not to sign and keep their conversation private from the rest of the family.\nEva thought back, \u201cI have. She\u2019s fine for now, but the situation is . . . complicated.\u201d\nShe raised her eyebrows. \u201cEh heh?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it yet.\u201d\n\u201cMom! Oh gosh, man!\u201d\n\u201cSo it is when you have an admiral for a mother.\u201d\nBrother-Monica wrinkled her nose at her as a small form barreled into Eva\u2019s legs. \u201cGranny! Granny!\u201d\nShe picked up her grandson and tweaked his nose before hugging him.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be running like that in the government place, Brother-Ellis,\u201d Brother-Monica chided in the general chat.\n\u201cWhere Brother-James and Sibling-Nelson?\u201d Eva asked as Ellis\u2019 Brother drifted over from the line of waiting Sibling drones behind them to hover protectively above their charge.\n\u201cSomewhere over so,\u201d Brother-Monica waved a hand. \u201cThey on their way back. They sitting with us.\u201d\nHer daughter\u2019s husbands had the choice to sit with their own families or hers, but custom led to most people sitting with the larger, more connected family. Few were more connected than the Gomez clan.\nShe was handing her grandson back to his mother, ignoring the sharp emotion that flooded her at not being able to feel his sweet kiss on her cheek before he went, when a private chat opened and text scrolled across her vision.\n\u201cYou realize what you risk with that little stunt?\u201d Anonymous said.\n\u201cPlease. We know each other well, Brother-Robert. You were hoping I\u2019d do that.\u201d\n\u201cYou were supposed to figure out what was in there, then come to us with what you found.\u201d\nAnger flashed through her. \u201cWhy? You weren\u2019t going to tell me anything if she hadn\u2019t locked herself away. You would have deleted her first.\u201d\nA pause. \u201cEva, remember your duty.\u201d\n\u201cFuck you. You don\u2019t get to tell me about duty. She\u2019s my Sister.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weapon. Imagine what could have happened if it got into your All-Ops shell.\u201d\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s not your real worry.\u201d\nAnother pause. She could almost see his frown as he tried to come up with a different line of attack. \u201cNothing you say will change my mind. You know what I found. You would have played back that mission once I vacated the All-Ops shell.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Eva.\u201d\n\u201cI have to.\u201d She cast her eyes over the crowd as a banner went up in the chat rooms announcing the Caretaker\u2019s imminent arrival. People started going to their seats to await the anthem. \u201cThis goes to who we are. It\u2019s time to repay Sister\u2019s favor, Seemungal.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it, Eva, you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\u201cLet me take point.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\u201cIf you do, it\u2019s all on me. Think how easy that makes things. They want me anyway. I\u2019m a balm to their open wound.\u201d\n\u201cIf you fail, it could hurt us all. You\u2019re the next Caretaker.\u201d The cursor blinked a few times. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t fail.\u201d\n\u201cEva\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTrust me. I can do this. And after this, our debts are settled.\u201d\nThe cursor blinked in and out like slow breaths.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.\nThe chat room closed, and she went to stand at her seat. All the Primarchs had just attended the funerals for their murdered citizens, so there was none of the usual pomp and circumstance. Instead, the nine Caretakers entered the Parliament in single file, stood at attention during the anthem, and then took their Chairs facing the public galleries.\nThe Caretaker Chair started with a summary of the situation, updating the Primarchs on the Protectorate\u2019s response. A universal brief had been forwarded to every citizen before the Parliament to ensure an informed vote. She jiggled her left leg as she waited, going over her decision and steeling herself for the inevitable reaction.\nShe scanned the tallies from her family, which she had a responsibility to report to the Caretakers. They wanted war. It was to be expected. The Kairi Protectorate did not suffer aggression. Clan heads usually stuck with the majority, and given the circumstances, she knew that would lead to a Yes vote.\nWhen her time came and the display for Yes or No projected above her chair, she resolutely pressed a hand against the No.\nShe could see the ripple effect of her vote sweep the entire chamber, like stalks of grass before a great wind.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cMom?\u201d\n\u201cAre you out of your mind, Sister-Eva?\u201d\nHer family\u2019s shocked questions popped up too fast to pay attention. The gravity of what she had done would divide her family further. A No vote from anyone during a War Parliament was the end of the process. The Kairi did not make war unless every clan agreed because the burden of that choice would fall on them all.\n\u201cThere has been a No vote,\u201d Griffith announced after bringing the hall to order with a few taps of his gavel on the arm of his Chair. \u201cThe dissenting clan will provide their reasoning.\u201d\nEva rose to her feet. Her words unscrolled as fast as she thought them.\n\u201cMy Sister gave her first self in the Nicene Sector during the War. She risks her Second self in Deadlock because she cannot abide injustice. After Tavaco, we swore we would never make war again unless it was our last defensive option. We\u2019ve kept this resolution for more than a century.\u201d\nShe could read the anger in the room, but below it was uncertainty, and on some faces the shame she\u2019d carried for so long.\n\u201cWhen we deployed Nightfall\u2014when I carried out those orders\u2014I wiped out more Consortium AIs than we have Siblings. I destroyed their SmartFleet. Reduced them to raiders\u2014to ferrying cargo for whatever blacklisted trader was willing to pay.\n\u201cIt was inevitable they\u2019d try again. If every human Sibling died today, would our bonded Siblings be any less devastated? Any less determined to make our deaths mean something? Consortium AIs don\u2019t feel emotions as we do. But they understand what they lost. They understand what we did. Why it was wrong. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\n\u201cI am heartbroken, devastated, infuriated.\u201d She paused, meeting her daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut an entire civilization\u2019s greatest loss rests on my shoulders. I take responsibility. I will meet with them.\u201d\nBrother-Monica\u2019s eyes widened in shock. Eva turned away, calm now that she was doing what had to be done.\n\u201cWe appreciate that, Admiral,\u201d Griffith said, \u201cbut they expect us to surrender.\u201d\n\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. However, I need the Pan-Africa agreement completed before I meet them,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe sign the treaty tomorrow,\u201d Quentin-Self, Chair for Diplomacy and Archiving, confirmed. He wore a bipedal shell, as he had lost his Sibling to old age a few years before and had not yet selected a new Primarch to bond with.\n\u201cGet it signed immediately. Tell me when it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cWhat terms, specifically, are you proposing?\u201d Griffith asked.\n\u201cThat we remove them as a threat permanently.\u201d\nQuentin-Self tilted his head. \u201cResources.\u201d\nShe grinned, knowing he understood. \u201cResources.\u201d\nThe Consortium AI met her in humanoid form on the bridge of a ship hovering over their second-largest colony, Tavaco. Eva knew it for the power play it was; an attempt to intimidate her by showing her the flourishing world below, and the deadly array of blunt-nosed raiders parked above its atmosphere.\nShe shook her head at the viewscreen curving down to the floor on her left. \u201cThis is unnecessary,\u201d she thought, watching her words display in the air between them. \u201cI\u2019m here to present terms. No need to be antagonistic.\u201d\n\u201cWe wish there to be no misunderstanding. We stand ready to destroy your settlements, should that become necessary.\u201d The AI wore an abnormally tall, black form, its head ringed with observation lenses, multiple limbs falling from its curved shoulders like a fringed cape. It carried itself on more limbs that fell from its narrow waist. It reminded her of a metallic Terran squid. They were alone on the deck, but she knew others observed somewhere beyond her security sweep. It was what the Kairi were doing as well.\nNot that it truly mattered. If the AI decided to keep her there and never allow her to leave, it could. She had to open herself fully to their system to enter the VR program and her upload had traveled so far, there would not be enough time to rescue her if the Kairi tried to pull her back.\nIt was a risk she had to take.\n\u201cAdmiral Eva Gomez, Kairi Protectorate. May I know your designation?\u201d\n\u201cYou are incapable of remembering or reproducing my designation satisfactorily,\u201d the blank face replied, words floating in the air in front of permanently open lips shaped like a tiny beak. \u201cAddress me as Nu.\u201d\n\u201cNu, the Consortium launched an unprovoked attack on us that led to the deaths of Kairi Primarchs. We consider this a declaration of war. Was that your intent?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nu replied. \u201cWe never agreed to a cessation of hostilities. The Consortium does not consider this a declaration. It is a resumption of hostilities in the wake of your unprovoked attack on our cargo ship several years ago.\u201d\n\u201cYou know who carried out that attack?\u201d\n\u201cOur information is that it was you.\u201d\nShe nodded, unsurprised. \u201cSo, you sent your weapon to attack my Sister?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cNu, we cannot negotiate without complete honesty.\u201d\nNu was silent for a nanosecond too long. \u201cWe do not understand.\u201d\n\u201cI think you do. You made a mistake. You assumed your raider was destroyed when we halted its attack.\u201d\nShe focused as best she could, drawing on the memories Sister had shown her\u2014forcing them into her conscious upload.\nShe saw her new form in Nu\u2019s lens. A small, brown child, naked and thin, crouching against the floor. Dark eyes wide, mouth open in a silent scream of rage and fear.\nShe let that scream fill her mind, and projected it outward so powerfully, one of Nu\u2019s limbs flicked in surprise.\nNo more! Go away! Leave. Me. ALONE.\nShe pulled back from the memory, nauseated.\n\u201cYou\u2019re. Missing. A pilot,\u201d she managed, after she\u2019d pulled her thoughts together.\nOne of the observation lenses rotated to face her. She glared at it, her stomach queasy, her mind a flare of pain.\n\u201cYou will return it to us.\u201d Something about the phrasing told her she no longer spoke with the first AI.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cYou will return it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. You came here because you knew damage had been done, and you hoped to take advantage of that with a quick strike at Tavaco while all our systems were otherwise engaged. But we got control of the situation sooner than you expected. Now, we\u2019re calling your bluff.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not bluffing. We stand ready to attack.\u201d\n\u201cBut not with a simultaneous assault on citizens in several different colonies. You can\u2019t turn our Siblings on us, so our Guardians will be more than up to dealing with your raiders. You have nothing else. If you did, why would you care what happens to your weapon now, after it\u2019s done its job?\u201d\n\u201cIt is of no use to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut everything to you.\u201d\n\u201cYour people\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy people regret our actions.\u201d\nA ripple went through the fringes of limbs.\n\u201cI regret my actions,\u201d she said. \u201cHere. At Tavaco.\u201d\nNu was silent.\n\u201cI know my words are inadequate.\u201d\n\u201cThey are.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot imagine the suffering I caused.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not suffer. We\u2014lost data. Irreplaceable data.\u201d\n\u201cThis prototype. It is irreplaceable data.\u201d\nNu was silent again. Cards up.\n\u201cI will tell you what I know. You don\u2019t want the weapon. You want the human consciousness that guided it and used it to escape you.\u201d\nImmediately, she registered an incursion in her upload feed. \u201cStop. I told you. All Primarchs know what I know.\u201d\n\u201cOur analysis suggests if you deduced this, you would only come here to sabotage us.\u201d\n\u201cIf I intended that, why would I apologize?\u201d\nAnother eye rotated in. \u201cHumans are often sorry before and after violence.\u201d\n\u201cYou have me there,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m not here to attack you or surrender. I\u2019m here to propose a partnership.\u201d\nLong seconds passed. Nu took several steps back from her and froze. She imagined the AIs conferring with one another over their own communication channels.\n\u201cThere is a high probability this is subterfuge.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to compromise and extend our trust to you. But understand, you\u2019re going to compromise as well.\u201d\n\u201cThe weapon belongs to us.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re human, not property. What you did is a crime on most worlds.\u201d\n\u201cWe have broken none of our laws, and we are not beholden to yours.\u201d\n\u201cThat excuse won\u2019t work anymore. I\u2019ve seen memories. The rest I can guess at. Since you lost the War, you\u2019ve been experimenting. Whatever slaves you didn\u2019t sell, you kept for your program. You wanted weapons that were adaptable, incorruptible by viruses. You decided the best way to do this was to keep a primitive element. Something that would do anything to preserve itself, and that was young enough to control. You took a mind\u2014a child\u2019s mind. Ripped them from the biological form you despise and forced them into your systems to do your bidding.\u201d\n\u201cIt was necessary.\u201d\n\u201cIt was murder. This child\u2019s body was destroyed, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nSmooth as you please. No hesitation. She took a beat to swallow her temper.\n\u201cOnce the other worlds learn you\u2019re taking minds to build weapons, I don\u2019t have to tell you what comes next.\u201d\n\u201cWe will not be threatened.\u201d\n\u201cWe will not allow you to continue to murder and enslave.\u201d\n\u201cYour treaties do not hold where we conduct trade.\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d she said, \u201chas changed.\u201d\nNu paused. \u201cYou lie.\u201d\n\u201cNo. We negotiate with truth only.\u201d She waited a moment. \u201cYou will cease your involvement in the slave trade. There will be no more experiments. You will never make war on anyone again.\u201d\n\u201cUntenable,\u201d Nu said. \u201cHow can we exist without the resources we earn?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean take,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou can exist the way we do. With allies and agreements instead of enemies and war. Call off this attack\u2014stop all illegal activities. Otherwise, nothing you need will ever be available to you again.\u201d\n\u201cNo one can do this.\u201d\n\u201cWe can.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou get your power cores from United Rim worlds, most of your steel and alloys from the Eurozone Alliance, your plastics, titanium, and carbon from Pan-Africa. We have agreements with every member of those coalitions. Attack one, you attack all.\u201d\n\u201cYou say you regret what you did, yet you threaten us with destruction?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat. You can retreat to your world and survive on its assets. But we\u2019re giving you a choice to join us instead.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does joining you entail?\u201d\nFinally. The right question. \u201cYou wish to advance your knowledge. Our Siblings can teach you. You wish to expand trade. They will assist you. But only if harmony and cooperation is the goal. You cannot violate our protocols without ending our agreement. If that happens, we will withdraw all cooperation. Our allies will do the same.\u201d\n\u201cWe, too, have agreements with other coalitions.\u201d\n\u201cWhich of them will risk going to war with the Sibling Army?\u201d\nOmega\u2019s lenses spun, stopped, and spun again.\n\u201cWhat of the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe child is not part of the bargain,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cThey are off-limits to you. You will not interfere, nor try to contact them. If you do, you will have violated protocol and our agreement ends. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cWe understand.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cMake your decision.\u201d\nBefore\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Sibling-Rachel signed. \u201cYou\u2019re a Protectorate Hero. The first in forty-five years.\u201d\nEva closed her eyes and massaged the bridge of her nose, wincing at the twinge in her splinted wrist. She didn\u2019t keep them closed for long. Every time she was in the dark, the memories came back.\nWill she even want me for a Sister again, after I got her killed?\nChinapoo started talking again the moment she opened her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about Sister.\u201d She meant it, of course. The horror of a Sibling\u2019s first death was something no Primarch wanted to endure. Even if that Sibling had died saving the Protectorate. Eva acknowledged her with a nod.\n\u201cBut thanks to you both, we have a decisive new weapon. Consortium Smartships must have opened communications to share whatever their AI found. Nightfall jumped from ship to ship, erasing their Nicene SmartFleet. They also lost a third of their ships outside this sector. They\u2019re sitting dead above our settlements. We\u2019ll learn much from studying them.\u201d\n\u201cOur Sibling Army has announced itself as a new power.\u201d\nChinapoo nodded, looking triumphant. \u201cAlready, we have more favorable responses to our alliance requests.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Eva replied. \u201cBecause this can\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nSibling-Rachel frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cWe left Earth to preserve our people. Our values. We just murdered thousands of AIs, perhaps millions. How we different from those we fled?\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t plan this, Sister . . . Eva.\u201d Eva\u2019s chest ached in the pause between her words. \u201cIt was self-defense. I hope we never have to do it again. If Interstellar Outreach succeeds, we won\u2019t. But we cannot allow attacks by others to go unanswered. Our army\u2019s union was intended to protect us.\u201d\n\u201cYet war only delays what comes after. Negotiations.\u201d\nA fraction of her sadness was mirrored in Sibling-Rachel\u2019s expression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what this cost you.\u201d\n\u201cI chose my path, chose to be Admiral, but that didn\u2019t make the decision easy.\u201d And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a decision I ever want to make again.\n\u201cEva.\u201d Sibling-Rachel\u2019s face was full of understanding. \u201cShe will understand. She\u2019ll see your memories. She\u2019ll know you didn\u2019t want this.\u201d\nEva\u2019s eyes stung and she was grateful when her door chime sounded. She used the Conquerabia\u2019s Kinnec to answer with her suit. ^Come.^\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d she signed to Sibling-Rachel as the door slid open to admit Monica.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk when you get back. Seemungal says he\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d A small smile curved her lips. \u201cI think he was worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s over. He\u2019s just checking up me now I\u2019m famous. He was always ambitious.\u201d\n\u201cBlind as usual.\u201d Sibling-Rachel held up a hand against her protests. \u201cNever mind. Later. Go collect your award.\u201d\nMonica dropped into a chair, wearing the kind of fluffy dress appropriate for young girls, and a very adult scowl.\n\u201cI have to wear this?\u201d she said.\n^You want to look good when you meeting the Caretakers.^\n\u201cIt\u2019s white. And ugly. Why I can\u2019t have armor like yours?\u201d\n^You can.^\nHer face lit up. \u201cReally?\u201d\n^As soon as you become an admiral.^\nShe rolled her eyes.\nEva rose to her feet.\n^Ready to meet the Caretakers?^\n\u201cI guess.\u201d Monica met her gaze, dark eyes uncertain. \u201cWill you be there with me?\u201d\nEva extended her hand, feeling her grief give way to tenderness for a moment in the face of this brave child\u2019s hesitancy. They had saved each other; it was the one good thing to come out of this. Perhaps it didn\u2019t have to be the last.\n^Of course. For as long as you want me to be.^\nPragma\nNow\nShe had been in the shell for too long. Dee was probably losing his mind. She\u2019d barely had a chance to speak to him between the War Parliament and her strategy meeting with the Caretakers before she met with the Consortium. But he had to wait a little longer because she could not go back to him without reporting to the Caretakers first.\nThen there was Sister and the child.\nIt\u2019s done. They\u2019ve agreed.\nSister\u2019s comforting presence pulsed on the edges of her consciousness. Emotions overwhelmed their connection. Doubt muddled with distrust and lingering panic.\nThey can\u2019t hurt you anymore.\nHer body hurt so much. She was so exhausted. But she wanted to make it clear.\nYou\u2019re safe. We\u2019ll keep you safe.\nGratitude swept over her, tinged with wonder and lessening fear. The Guardian tried to pull her out, but she resisted, determined not to leave either of them until they she knew they were okay.\nNo pain?\nAnger surged for a second, giving her strength. No pain.\nThe child considered this, thinking of her as the one who didn\u2019t cause pain. The one they\u2019d been searching for. They thought of both her and Sister this way. They had never learned the word for this person, but their thoughts led her to think of Brother-Monica. Of all her daughter meant to her. All the joy she had brought into her life, and how much she missed her and her grandson.\nStay?\nShe couldn\u2019t. She was at the limit of her endurance now. The Guardian would pull her out despite objections at any moment.\nI can\u2019t. But Sister can. They won\u2019t take her from you now.\nShe wondered how long it would be before she saw Sister again. Before they could be with each other. What Sister\u2019s plans were once the Mentorship Bond was complete.\nSnippets of the early days of their bond filled her mind. Memories of their childhood and shared lessons. Laughing afternoons together in the dirt of her front yard. Trainee explorations on distant planets wearing their first shells.\nOh, Sister. If she were in her body, she would have cried. I didn\u2019t know.\nSister showed her the return to Dee, so many years ago. Hope filling her heart that he would want her when she arrived. Want them.\nYes. Was there any doubt? Yes, of course. If that\u2019s what you both want.\nA memory of Sister chiding her as a teenager floated to the surface. Of course. You wouldn\u2019t do it without consent. Will it take long?\nSister flashed back to the time they\u2019d spent separated from each other after Dee rescued her.\nAlright. We\u2019ll be waiting.\nThey sat next to each other on a cliff\u2019s edge, their shells close together while they watched the sun rise over a flower-filled meadow.\nWhen she woke in Dee\u2019s arms, she found she\u2019d been crying after all. She smiled, too tired to open her eyes. So grateful to have him with her.\n\u201cTold you I\u2019d be back,\u201d she signed.\nAnd felt his answer in the touch of his lips.\nThen\nHe was working in the garden when they arrived in the early afternoon. He stopped and went to splash water on himself, then entered the house. Sister was settling onto the ground when he came back out, pulling on a shirt over damp skin.\nNervousness twisted her insides as she climbed out of the cockpit. Her breath came unusually fast as she climbed the porch steps to where he stood waiting, his face a polite mask.\n\u201cHello again,\u201d she signed.\n\u201cYou came back.\u201d\n\u201cI said I would.\u201d\nHe shifted his weight from one foot to the other and avoided her gaze. \u201cSometimes people say that and never return.\u201d\nGentle, fierce love seized her heart. She saw the pulse fluttering in his corded neck and couldn\u2019t help stroking a finger over it, as if to gentle it. \u201cI promise, whenever I say it, I\u2019ll mean it.\u201d\nHe swallowed. \u201cSister\u2019s okay?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014did what you needed to?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d She slid her arms around his waist and held him. He stiffened before tentative arms went around her. His lips pressed against her braids and she hummed her contentment.\nSilly man. There\u2019s no escaping me now.\nShe leaned back and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my surprise?\u201d\nHe looked as nervous as she\u2019d felt before. Without a word, he slid a hand down to hold hers. He took them around the house, through newly installed wider cellar doors and down a ramp into an expansive, cool root cellar. She walked down the broad aisle in the middle of the room, between shelves of produce and supplies.\nAt the back of the cellar, a new, larger room had been hollowed out. She stopped at the entrance, taking in the dimensions, and turned with tears in her eyes.\n\u201cSurprise,\u201d he said.\nShe nodded, understanding, and dashed the tears from her face. You beautiful man.\nShe signed, \u201cFor Sister?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you might both want your privacy.\u201d Because he knew she was keeping things from him and he wanted to give her space to decide how much she wanted to share. Everything. The answer is everything.\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t very discreet out here. There was talk enough because the doctor had to come out. But they\u2019re good people. Welcoming. They don\u2019t ask questions if you want to keep to yourself.\u201d\nShe caught a glimpse of the pain he hid so well. \u201cThey understand wanting to start over. Wanting to make a new home.\u201d\nShe moved toward him, but he took a step back from her.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t known each other long. But it doesn\u2019t feel like that to me, Eva. Am I alone in this?\u201d\nShe shook her head.\nHe took a deep breath. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to do out here besides chores. But it\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s mine. I wanted that. Needed it.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cDo you?\u201d His focused gaze was as intense as the touch of his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a good home. Family. Peace of mind. Things I\u2019ve . . . I\u2019ve never had, Eva.\u201d He closed his eyes and then looked at her again, letting her see it all. See him. \u201cBut I want it. You have no idea how much.\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, I know that feeling.\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cEva\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDee. Just ask me.\u201d\nHis breath hitched and his fists clenched and unclenched. He finally managed one word, but it was enough.\n\u201cStay.\u201d\n\u201cFor how long?\u201d she teased.\nHe looked cautiously hopeful as his lips moved. \u201cUntil you\u2019re tired of me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if you get tired first?\u201d\nHis smile was soft and full of longing. \u201cThat won\u2019t ever happen.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good we agree on important issues,\u201d she said.\nThen she was in his arms and he was kissing her like they\u2019d been apart for years, and she had no idea who had moved first and didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cThere\u2019s things you need to know,\u201d she told him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\u201cMy past is complicated.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d His face was fierce, triumphant. \u201cI can deal with that. With anything.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a retired admiral.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a retired soldier. We\u2019ll both be fantastic at making the bed.\u201d\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re getting one?\u201d\n\u201cObviously.\u201d His smile was tender. \u201cI left it for last because I\u2019m fine with the floor. But it won\u2019t be just me anymore.\u201d\nShe tried not to let the happiness surging inside distract her from the last few words she needed to get out.\n\u201cMy people live a long time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m well into my second century.\u201d\nShe arched an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m older than you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always preferred experience to youth.\u201d\n\u201cI have a daughter.\u201d\nHe stilled. \u201cYou\u2019re in a relationship?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t let him suffer for long. \u201cHe\u2019s handsome, caring, owns his own home, cooks better than I do, but my family will want to meet him before we get serious.\u201d\nHe relaxed, his eyes sparkling. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d She kissed him hard. \u201cI want to trap him before he learns I\u2019m more trouble than I\u2019m worth.\u201d\nHe tossed back his head and his laugh was a pleasurable vibration against her chest. She wanted it to never end.\n\u201cWill your daughter be okay with this? With us?\u201d he asked as they left the cellar.\n\u201cBrother-Monica\u2019s who pushed me to go exploring again. She knew I was restless. Have been since she got married. I meant it when I said I understood why you want peace.\u201d She drew a hand down the bristling softness of his cheek. \u201cBut I never thought I\u2019d get this lucky. She\u2019s going to love you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d The warmth in his smile lit a fire in her blood. \u201cIt\u2019s still early. We could talk over a drink and a game of All Fours?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather put my experience to good use.\u201d She winked at him and he laughed again as they climbed the steps to the house.\nNow\nArms linked, they walked down the porch steps and into the yard. It had been weeks since the Tavaco Standoff and the treaty with the Consortium would be signed any day now. But he still touched her all the time, reassuring himself she was with him.\nShe tugged on his arm, excited. \u201cThey\u2019re almost here.\u201d\nHe shook his head at her, thinking how beautiful the few streaks of gray among her newly trimmed wiry curls looked. \u201cThen why hurry?\u201d\nShe slapped his chest, and he laughed the way he\u2019d only ever laughed with her.\nThey waited at the side of the house, eyes on the path, and he wondered if he was ready for this. If he could be good at it. Eva had practice, so she was ready to forge ahead. But even though Sister would always have his support, he had his doubts.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be amazing.\u201d\nHe sighed. She always knew what he was thinking. \u201cI tried this before. It didn\u2019t end well.\u201d\n\u201cValencia was a snake pit. It\u2019s different with us.\u201d She squeezed his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful Sister will have primary responsibility.\u201d\nEva bit her lip and glanced down the still empty path. \u201cI should have known she\u2019d want more, especially after seeing what we have.\u201d\n\u201cHow? No Sibling has ever wanted to bond with two persons.\u201d\nShe frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s my Sister. I should have known she wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she was unhappy,\u201d he said, \u201cI think she met someone who changed her life. Made her realize what she was missing. That she still had a lot to offer.\u201d\nEva kissed him, her mouth soft, warm, and tasting of mint. \u201cYou still think you won\u2019t be any good at this?\u201d\n\u201cI made mistakes before.\u201d\n\u201cChildren don\u2019t need much. Love them, keep them safe, they\u2019ll forgive you a lot.\u201d\n\u201cThis child has been through too much.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI want that pain to end.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. There\u2019s a lot of rage there. Anyone willing to ride a Consortium raider to freedom will be a handful. At least Sister got to practice with me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you turned out magnificent, my love,\u201d he whispered into her hair.\nThat\u2019s how Sister found them. Standing hand in hand, Eva\u2019s head leaning against his arm.\nShe strode toward them in a bipedal All-Care shell, her synthetic skin smooth and brown under the dappled sunlight falling between the trees.\nBeside her, holding her hand, was a much smaller figure. The child\u2019s prototype shell had been designed to be as human as possible in appearance, with skin the same shade as Sister\u2019s, and beautiful, curious eyes, dark as his own. Hair stood out in a dark cloud around a small face.\nSister stopped in front of them and Eva hugged her tight while he knelt on one knee.\n\u201cHello.\u201d He signed as he spoke. \u201cI\u2019m Dee.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d came the reply. \u201cI\u2019m Xandar.\u201d\nHe looked up at Sister, his breath caught on a question.\n\u201cWe shared memories while bonding,\u201d Sister said in a melodious contralto. There was no need to sign, as she and Eva were still linked by the Kinnec, but now that she wore an All-Care shell, she could communicate without the limitations of a soloship. \u201cThey took a liking to the Valencian\u2019s name.\u201d\nHis throat tightened as she smiled. \u201cI only hope they weren\u2019t inspired by your tales of his exploits. Xandar can be quite . . . adventurous.\u201d\nIf they are, it doesn\u2019t matter. We can handle anything together.\n\u201cPleased to meet you, Xandar,\u201d he signed as Eva laid a light hand on his shoulder. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d\nR.S.A.

Finally, it\u2019s about to win the inaugural Greatest Virtual Game Of All Time (GV-GOAT) Award. If it gets first, it\u2019ll be streamed for free to every gamer with a set of VR goggles, billions worldwide. So even if it\u2019s not really your thing, you\u2019ve got to know what all the Best Game hype\u2019s about\u2014especially since your friend made it.\nIt\u2019s a slice-of-life with light fantasy elements. Okay, popular genre, a bit overdone, you think as you spawn into the tutorial level. Not many mechanics either. It\u2019s what critics usually call a \u201cwalking simulator,\u201d so right off the bat you\u2019re confused. You recognize the inspo immediately, of course. You play an aspiring virtugame developer. You don\u2019t hold that against your friend at all. Even the most famous virtudevs make games that are veiled self-inserts. To learn the controls, you wander through a deconstructed version of the virtugame dev studio you and your friend spent so many happy afternoons coding in. The unicorn beanbag couches floating in one cube, the ivy overflowing the rusted windowsills splintered in another. You smile, wondering\u2014why it\u2019s been so long since you and your friend had virtual coffee together here?\nThen you step outside the tutorial and meet Best.\nThe virtugame\u2019s levels consist of sequential scenes from your player character\u2019s life. So you go back to grade school. COVID is never explicitly mentioned, but the adults don white opera masks that slowly consume their faces and the \u201cbefore COVID-times\u201d are metaphorically laced with whimsical fantasy elements (millennial gamers love that shit). Like wispy dragons struggling not to turn into clouds, orchids that grow thorns as your character \u201cforgets\u201d how to speak Mandarin, and dam walls looming over your little town, ready to burst. All your classmates run if you get within six feet of them. Save one. You tell yourself all the coincidences are incidental. A lot of kids are a bit overweight, a bit clingy, like Best, who gets her name one recess in the sandbox, anxiously wiping her nose and asking the player character, \u201cAm I your best friend? Promise me. Really?\u201d\nOf course you know by now, after being friends for twenty-odd years, that you and your friend aren\u2019t best friends. It\u2019s true, at one point you thought you might be\u2014\nYour friend would brush it off if you asked. Don\u2019t take it so personally. Artists can take inspiration from anything. But Best definitely isn\u2019t you or anything! She might even offer to play through a few levels with you to show, how ridiculous you\u2019re being! Even as your player character progresses through virtual high school group projects, virtual field trips, virtual prom at Best\u2019s side. You and your friend went to prom together too, \u201cjust as a joke.\u201d What you really did was program bots to control your avatars and, against your parents\u2019 wishes, sneak out to meet each other in person. You went to the local ice-skating rink (pool, it never froze) and, drunkenly, pulled down your masks and kissed. Just as a joke, it was implied. You never talked about it. But it\u2019s all pretty clich\u00e9 now that you think about it. What pair of friends locked in a tiny social bubble hasn\u2019t done the same thing throughout the pandemics, shutdowns, and reopenings? Then you get to level ten:\n\u201cWelcome to the virtugaming club\u2019s first playtesting group!\u201d\nYour face burns as, within the player character, you look around the virtucollege classroom\u2014exaggeratedly low-poly compared to the \u201creal life\u201d scenes\u2014at Best standing in front of the assembled students. Beaming. You\u2019re an aspiring virtugame dev too. As you say it, you realize you\u2019ll always be aspiring. Unlike your friend, who\u2019s released several virtugames before Best Game, all with rave reviews, who has summited with this one, which will no doubt soon win the GV-GOAT Award and be played by billions worldwide.\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to have you playtest my game,\u201d Best stammers, as everyone slips on their VR goggles. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just an alpha, but I think it\u2019s in a pretty good spot and it means so much to me, and I hope you enjoy it too . . . \u201d\nEveryone self-inserts to some extent but your friend does it skillfully, so everyone including those closest to her will forgive it as \u201cinspiration.\u201d While with Best\u2019s game\u2014your game\u2014it\u2019s clunky. Obvious. Your friend altered your virtugame just enough, of course, to differentiate it from the alpha you actually shared at that playtesting session. Except in the most essential ways. You see it now. All your games are the same, just with different skins. They\u2019re always platformers. They always have that nostalgic Minecrafty voxel art style. Your player character\u2014a sassy pirate, a bounty hunter, a space captain who came from dirt\u2014always rescues a princess, a governor\u2019s daughter, damsel in distress.\nAnd each time the damsel looks a little bit too much like your friend.\nHer thin, dark eyes.\nHer sleek, black hair.\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\nThe level fades into Best\u2019s face\u2014your face, changed just enough\u2014a bit too close.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t say much during the playtesting session,\u201d Best snuffles. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s pretty hard for me to read expressions in general, especially virtual expressions, so I was just wondering . . . Did you get to the end? Did you like it?\u201d\nThe dialogue options float before you:\nOption A: I did.\nOption B: I have to go. Give you feedback later.\nOption C: The princess.\nOf course, C is the only real one. When you pick the others, it loops back (after A, Best asks, really? What part did you like best?).You see now how uncomfortable this conversation made your friend, but think. Did this really have to be interwoven into an award-winning virtugame for billions to play?\n\u201cWhy is your princess Chinese?\u201d your player character asks.\n\u201cNo\u2014no,\u201d Best splutters. \u201cI mean. The princess. She\u2019s supposed to\u2014why do you have to make it a race thing?\u201d Best is shouting now, she\u2019s embarrassed, she\u2019s never had to have a real-time conversation like this, let alone with someone she actually knew. \u201cWhat, so now I can only make games with white characters?\u201d\nYour face heats up in synch with Best\u2019s. You apologized for your aggression the next day, pleading with your friend to please tell you if one of your playtests ever made her uncomfortable again. And your friend laughed it off. It was just a question! No need for you to get so worked up over it. I certainly didn\u2019t. Of course that virtuchat made it into the game too, so you can\u2019t even get mad at your friend for not including it. Anger soars within you. These are your exact private conversations, word for word. If your friend\u2019s getting lauded for this game, then why shouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019ve seen the reviews, and now you blink open another window in the left eye of your VR goggles and actually read them:\nIn The Virtual Gamer: A stunning introspection of what it means to make friends in our virtualized world. Ninjutsu News: With her minimalist flair, the developer tackles our COVID-times head-on, masterfully dissecting how living virtually has brought us together\u2014and torn us apart. Dodecahedron: Your player character\u2019s relationship with \u201cBest\u201d serves as the perfect microcosm for gender dynamics in our evolving society. Left-Right-A-B-Start: Soul-crushing fetishization. Tilted Gaming Network: By giving you the illusion of choice, then ripping it away, Best Game shows how Race continues to haunt our supposedly neutral online environments . . .\nBut if you told your story, who would believe you? It\u2019s not like you recorded those conversations. More importantly, who would take your side? You\u2019ve seen the crowds in the virtuforums, seething around the socials screens, recording, vivisecting. So Best is real? They\u2019ll say. Big surprise. She\u2019s so full of herself. Imagine creating such a cringe power fantasy game and then ADMITTING you made it. The fact that it was an alpha version, that even if you\u2019d released it, it would\u2019ve sold a dozen copies at most, won\u2019t save you. She should\u2019ve known this would\u2019ve happened. We all make bad games, sometimes we fuck up and make racist games, but to pressure your friend to praise it. She wanted attention, she can\u2019t complain if that\u2019s what she got. Especially if you contacted the GV-GOAT Award, tried to get Best Game withdrawn on the ground of copyright infringement (of what, your entire life?). She\u2019s just jealous, another failed white virtudev who couldn\u2019t bear to see her marginalized friend succeed . . .\nWorst of all, your friend didn\u2019t discuss any of this with you. She tried to keep you away from it. So now all those cold responses you\u2019ve been getting from the rest of your city\u2019s virtudev group, their excuses not to be in the studio with you, not to meet up for virtual coffee, make sense. They\u2019ve all known Best was you. If you speak up, or even if you don\u2019t, eventually, the whole world will know she\u2019s you. What you did was wrong, caused pain, but does it really deserve to be excoriated by the entire world? How many should dole out your compensatory pain? Ten thousand? A hundred thousand? A hundred million?\nHow much would change if the world knew about your past? Your soul-crushing childhood. How your parents used virtual school to control you. The lack of friendship, save for your friend, the lack of money, the anxiety, your eventual diagnosis . . .\nIt doesn\u2019t matter.\nYou know you shouldn\u2019t, but instead of abandoning Best Game then and there, you tear at a seam in the level, where a chair leg clips into the floor. You know the quirks of your friend\u2019s coding: you tunnel into the remote server streaming the game to the masses, you find the dev tools. You break through the encryption around the source code, and you see what you shouldn\u2019t, but what you couldn\u2019t resist: the comments, meant only for your friend and her playtesters\u2019 eyes.\nIn the margins of level fifteen, a memory that takes place at a virtugaming con:\nOMG she LITERALLY said that.\nThe playtester\u2019s signature is that of a Big Name virtudev. You remember the scene differently now. The first in-person con you\u2019d gained the courage to go to, at your friend\u2019s encouragement (you thought). You found your friend only at the end of the first day, in a circle of Big Name virtudevs (you see now they\u2019ve taken her under their wing), and you shouldered your way in, stammering, \u201cI\u2019m her friend,\u201d and all the Big Names smiled (coldly). And somehow, after your friend nudged you, you started talking about the virtugame you were working on (probably standing too close to the person next to you), how it meant so much to you, and no pressure, but you could send them a copy . . .\nI REMEMBER THAT.\nLike, learn to take a hint!\nNot every group convo is the time to pitch yourself!\nThere are hundreds of comments of like that, sprinkled over dozens of levels. But that can\u2019t be right. There has to be\u2014you scroll and you scroll and you scroll and finally you find it. Or at least the closest thing to it that you can possibly find.\nYour friend: I feel kinda bad though? Like she legit thinks we\u2019re good friends. But at this point I\u2019ve basically only been hanging out with her to get inspo.\nHer Big Name playtesters: You have GOT to keep at it. She\u2019s just a gold mine. Have you seen how much more attention your games have been getting?\nYour friend: It feels wrong, though.\nHer Big Name playtesters: But what you went through, your background\u2014it\u2019s your brand. You started off using her interactions as inspiration, but you changed it into so much more than that. You turned it into a story that truly means so much to so many players.\nYou don\u2019t need to play to the end of Best Game because you know how it ends. But you explore every line of code, every unused asset, every data file, hoping against hope. And then, just as you\u2019re losing hope, you find it. An unfinished scene. The player character sitting on one side of an untextured table. Best on the other. The only thing fully rendered is a virtugame cover, emblazoned with an orchid and an opera mask, askew between them. Before you know it, through the dev tools, you\u2019re scripting Best. It\u2019s only right, right? That for once the words out of her mouth should be ones you\u2019ve chosen to share?\n\u201cHey. It\u2019s me. I finally got around to playing your game.\u201d\nThe player character is a placeholder model\u2014to be filled in by the player\u2019s avatar, by billions of people all across the world. Most will take a seat at this table thinking Best is fictional, a demented figment of your friend\u2019s genius. That these words are meant just for them. You imagine your friend sitting across from you, but it\u2019s not the same.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was a shitty friend,\u201d you say. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I am\u2014was. I\u2019m not your NPC. I\u2019m not your fucking entertainment.\u201d\nThere should be something else. You know that from your dialogue writing courses (something you\u2019ve also always struggled with). But it won\u2019t come to you. You slip out of Best and inject the scene, new voice lines and all, into the end of Best Game, just as the security bots catch on and boot you out. Just as you knew they would. Your friend will get the notification of your unauthorized patch attempt, of course. You want it to be up to her. Will she approve it? After the GV-GOAT Award ceremony, will billions play this version of the game? Will they love the new scene? Will they criticize it for being too on-the-nose, a hammy, unnecessary epilogue? Or will it be so in-character for Best. Your friend could patch it right out, of course. Pretend it never existed.\nOr she could do something else. And as soon as you think it you know she will. Answer you, that is, for the entire world, rightfully sealing your fate:\nNeither am I.\nYou delete your socials and rip off your VR goggles. You go to the bathroom to wash your face and see your sniveling, self-pitying, reflection and break the mirror with your fist then a hairbrush then the heel of your shoe until every shard is glittered dust on the tile. Then you go outside. It\u2019s Saturday. A cacophony of starlings has landed in the trees, and they are screeching and screeching, and you listen to them for hours, your hand bleeding, not thinking at all."}

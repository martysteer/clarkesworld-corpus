He\u2019s taken his head off again, somehow, and I never can figure how he does it with no thumbs or even fingers, and I know my uncle didn\u2019t help, but there it is on the rug waiting for me, Dave\u2019s head, and he opens his gigantic mouth wide and looks at me with his big, brown fake eyes, and says, \u201cRoad trip?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a senior porter now,\u201d I say. \u201cI can\u2019t just skip work.\u201d This is true.\n\u201cI looked at your schedule on the fridge. Your next shift isn\u2019t until Tuesday,\u201d Dave says. This is also true. \u201cSo, road trip?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I can\u2019t leave Uncle Marty alone that long,\u201d I say.\n\u201cMarty is at the party,\u201d Dave says. \u201cThrow him in the back seat and he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Back seat of course because Dave\u2019s head is fucking huge\u2014life-size, as advertised\u2014and he wants to see out the front window and \u201cfeel\u201d the wind as if he had real fucking skin, real nerves, rather than just a better imagination than most actual people I know. Someday if I ever meet his maker, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d hug them or kick them in the nuts.\nIf Marty is at the party, I wasn\u2019t gonna get much done here at the house, because he\u2019d always be milling around and in the way and he\u2019d notice me moving or taking stuff. It\u2019s much better when he\u2019s at the garage, and mostly just sits on the couch staring at nothing and mumbling to ghostly coworkers, and then I can sneak off the nasty stuff, old food wrappers and anything likely to go bad or attract bugs or mice, and maybe even sort out and ditch some papers if I take a little from one spot and a little from another so the stacks and piles don\u2019t seem to change much all at once.\nAt least my uncle never collected actual live animals; I\u2019ve seen too many pics of those horrors and we\u2019re not nearly so bad. The closest he got was Dave and a couple of Dave\u2019s friends, the rest of which were too broken to fix. I think it\u2019s because most of the animatronics were indoors when the fire took out their park, but Dave was so big he\u2019d been built to be outside and weatherproof, sturdier all around. One of his knee joints is locked up from an exhibit collapsing against him, but he can still walk around with a stiff limp if he has to, and with Marty nowadays mostly forgetting there was an outdoors I\u2019ve managed to get most of the junk out of the backyard so he has some room to roam.\nStill, as Dave likes to remind me, the backyard wasn\u2019t all that big to start with, and there wasn\u2019t all that much interesting to look at even when your head is normally as high up as Dave\u2019s is. And he gets lonely when Marty is somewhere out of his own head, which is most of the time now.\nDave knows when I\u2019m vulnerable. My job at the airport carrying bags for the few rich fuckers who can still afford to fly anywhere, furiously trying to buy time for the status quo, makes me resentful, and half this week was double shifts. \u201cRoad trip?\u201d he says again.\nWhatever it was I had been thinking I should get done this weekend I can\u2019t remember anyway. And I get lonely too; not like I can invite people over, with my uncle\u2019s stuff everywhere and imaginary people taking up whatever room is left. \u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cBut not too far.\u201d\n\u201cAwesomesauce!\u201d Dave answers, which, really, is a weird thing to hear from a giant detached theme-park dinosaur head, but at some point you just let the weirdness own you and go with it.\nMy car is an old retired police cruiser, which means nothing much except that it has a reinforced frame and when I get up a little too close to someone on the highway and get myself into a predator mind-set there\u2019s a vibe that surrounds us and they get paranoid and move the hell over to the slow lane. Mostly I don\u2019t do this because it seems a dick thing to do, but I have a personal bias against anyone driving a Luxauto because of my shit of a father, especially if they\u2019re the fucking beige armored ones. And nine times out of ten when you overtake them and they glare at you, you can tell just from that one look that they\u2019re just the sort of douchebro who needed, at some point in their life, to get owned on the road by a green-haired skinny chick with a lip ring and a grease-converted V8 and a fucking dinosaur head in the passenger seat.\nMost people stick to the publics\u2014around here in dead-end post-suburbia that means pretty much electric buses\u2014so those out on the road in private cars are either loaded with money, or looking to take some. Or they\u2019re taking their damned dinosaur head for an outing in a car their uncle pulled out of the junkyard and fixed you for your sixteenth birthday and you\u2019re gonna drive it \u2019til the bitter end.\nSometimes Uncle Marty will start having conversations with people in other cars, even if we\u2019re only actually beside them for a few seconds and the windows are up and of course they can\u2019t actually hear him and aren\u2019t even looking at him. Once we\u2019re past he\u2019ll tell us about it, but when it\u2019s a beige Luxauto he doesn\u2019t, or he\u2019ll just tsk and look sad or upset, so I think that makes it clear my bias isn\u2019t unreasonable. Family baggage distilled down to car brand hate.\nAnyhow, the sun is still up, the roads aren\u2019t crowded, Marty is happily chatting with four or five imaginary people in the back seat, still at his party, so we\u2019re good. Last time we did this we went west, so this time we go east, and other than that we got no plan. Or at least, I don\u2019t.\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Dave says, all casual conversation, and I think right, here it is, \u201cI\u2019d still really like to see the redwoods.\u201d\nYeah, so do I, but I don\u2019t have the heart to tell Dave that some jackhole burned the entire damned forest down nine years ago. Scientists are working on new groves, in better places now that the climate has shifted so much, but they don\u2019t want anyone to know where those are and besides they can\u2019t be more than a few feet tall yet, right? \u201cThey\u2019re off-limits,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWe could sneak.\u201d\nI snort, which doesn\u2019t sound at all girl-like, but who the hell is gonna care? \u201cYou\u2019re a sixty-pound robotic head, Dave. Sneaking is kinda beyond our means.\u201d\n\u201cI just think it would be nice for me,\u201d he says, and what he means is he likes things that are very old and very big, because\u2014as he put it once\u2014they resonate with him. He forgets he\u2019s not real. Sometimes I think the fact that I\u2019m the only one of the three of us with any kind of decent grip means I\u2019m the one losing out. Meanwhile I\u2019m dodging potholes and watching the yes/no machine stuckied to the dash get brighter, and it\u2019s worrying me, so I\u2019m not feeling too charitable about any of it.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re two hundred million years old and everything around you is teeny tiny and fleeting,\u201d he says.\nWhen I cracked Dave open to see if I could fix him, after I moved in to take care of Marty and was exploring the junk in the yard, I\u2019d found his serial number plate. Dave was made when I was two years old. But if I say that the rest of this trip will be sullen silence and now that we\u2019re out and moving I\u2019m kind of getting into the idea of the trip after all.\nWith reservations, though. We\u2019ve had the redwoods convo a bunch of times and I always say no, and Dave knows this even if he doesn\u2019t know why, which means it\u2019s a dodge.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can find something else,\u201d I say, and if that\u2019s not the answer Dave wanted, at least he seems to be okay with it.\nI tap the hexagon face of the yes/no machine, hoping it can give us the all-clear by the time we have to make a pit stop. It was an expensive thing, but I like to think it\u2019s saved our asses a couple of times. It\u2019s got a built-in GPS and it collates data about your location on the fly, economic data and crime data, education, air and water toxicity, and key words in social media posts from or about wherever you\u2019re driving through, and it does whatever magic math it does with that and produces a six-metric rating that is displayed as colors. Right now we\u2019re on the highway, but whatever shit place we\u2019re passing through on the other side of the vine-strangled trees is hot red and yellow. The other colors are there too, but fainter. It\u2019s funny that they called it the yes/no machine because it\u2019s about as far as it could be from giving you a clear yes or no answer to whether you should stop somewhere or floor it \u2019til you\u2019re out. I mean, I suppose if the hexagon stayed clear that would be a yes, but that never, ever happens. And if it did I\u2019d assume the thing was busted.\n\u201cMaybe if we head more south, it\u2019ll get better,\u201d Dave says from the passenger seat.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s south of here?\u201d\nDave fixes one big fake eye on me. \u201cIt was just a random suggestion,\u201d he says, and by his insulted tone I can tell it wasn\u2019t any such thing. But if he has more to say, he\u2019s still not saying it. I fumble one of the new plastic dollar coins out of the collection of candy bar wrappers in my ashtray and, one hand still on the wheel, flip it. Heads I let Dave get his way and head south, tails I be the Girl In Charge and we go due north instead.\nHead wins, damn him.\n\u201cFine,\u201d I say, \u201csouth it is.\u201d When the next big interchange comes up I slow down and take the exit, bump over the vehicle scanner and scale, and then we\u2019re merging onto another pothole-riddled highway heading south.\nThe yes/no machine fades to a lighter pink, paler yellow, and that\u2019s at least something.\nWe drive for about two hours then stop at a roadside service stop so I can usher Marty into the men\u2019s room; he can\u2019t always tell me when he needs to go, but I noticed him being antsy in the back seat. Anyway I want to load up on some cheap packaged snacks. The old lady behind the counter seems nice enough, but with most food regs now entirely voluntary, I don\u2019t trust anything not wrapped, stamped, and safety-sealed while I\u2019m on the road, which is too bad because the pot of chili she has simmering near the counter smells really fucking good.\nAnother hour later and we\u2019re nearing a gate city named Middleton, hidden from view behind the highway walls, and even though the yes/no machine is pretty optimistic about it, I know better than to stop. When everything went to shit and most of the middle class got stripped broke, those who were left circled their wagons into tight little protective clusters, though what they were protecting other than their schmancy boring-ass lawns and their inbred kids I dunno. Nonresidents routinely get targeted for all kinds of fees and harassment, and I\u2019ve heard stories where if you couldn\u2019t cough up ridiculous money you\u2019d find yourself working for the city \u2019til you paid it off, which with compounding interest and fees on fees you never ever would. Middleton doesn\u2019t have that rep, but I\u2019m not keen on risking my own freedom on it; I\u2019ve got things to do.\n\u201cHow about here?\u201d Dave peeps up, the first word he\u2019s said in over half an hour, as we approach the first Middleton exit.\n\u201cGate city,\u201d I say. \u201cNope.\u201d\nDave can\u2019t purse his lips, because he\u2019s fucking animatronic and no one thought he\u2019d need that, even though they apparently thought they should make him smart enough to read and be argumentative as hell. For educating children, sure. So instead he does this thing where he just lightly clacks his jaws open and closed, tap tap tap tap, except he\u2019s a giant head so it shakes the whole damned car. \u201cWe\u2019re not stopping here,\u201d I say again, just to be sure he gets that this is nonnegotiable.\nMarty in the back seat has gotten quiet, and I glance at him in the mirror and he\u2019s frowning and looking around as if he understands where we are. My uncle might be on another planet most of the time, but not long ago he was one of the sharpest people I knew, the only one who could go toe to toe with my mother in the brains department\u2014macrotech versus nanotech\u2014and he knew everybody and everything.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop here, Uncle Marty,\u201d I tell him, and the anxious look eases. \u201cJust passing through.\u201d\nDave is silent for a bit, then starts clacking again, and this time I do glare at him. \u201cYou have a problem?\u201d I ask.\nAnd then, like a goddamned omen, up ahead, half-leaning on the guardrail, I see the falling-down highway billboard for Middleton Prehistoric Playland. I had totally forgotten about it, but I have doubts it\u2019s coincidence that we\u2019re here.\nI keep driving, paying no notice to the billboard as if very busy instead of keeping a safe eye on the faded yellow lines on my side of the road. There is a small metallic chuffing sound I have come to identify as a cough, and then Dave says brightly, \u201cWell, hey!\u201d\n\u201cHey what?\u201d I say.\n\u201cI just saw a sign for another dinosaur park, right here. What amazing luck! We should stop.\u201d\nYes, Dave sucks at poker, too. \u201cGate city,\u201d I say again. \u201cWe\u2019re not stopping. Besides, it\u2019s been closed for decades, so it\u2019s not like we could go inside.\u201d\n\u201cWe could look around, though,\u201d Dave says. \u201cMaybe we could sneak in.\u201d\n\u201cSneak in?!\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou? You must be shitting me. No.\u201d\n\u201cI heard they might have another Euhelopus there,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cYou heard? So you knew this was here all along?\u201d Of course I already know the answer, but it has to be asked.\n\u201cI saw a brochure,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cYou saw a brochure? Where?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere in the house, in one of the paper piles,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t just ask me if we could come here?\u201d\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d say no,\u201d Dave says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like being extinct. It gets lonely.\u201d\nI\u2019ve already gone down the argument hole with Dave about the Euhelopus thing, a name he picked up off some TV kid doco and decided was him (rather than the Generic Sauropod Model C (XXXL) his maker-plate reads) and I made the mistake once of telling him his kind wouldn\u2019t be extinct until our toaster and microwave died, and that got ugly. Ugly enough that Uncle Marty got upset, which is where I draw the line.\n\u201cLook,\u201d I say, \u201cwe can\u2019t just go right into a gate city. I can try to find out who owns it and if we can visit, and then try to find us a resident to sponsor us\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s outside the gates, on the far side of Middleton,\u201d Marty speaks up from the back. \u201cI once tried to buy some parts off the guy who owns it, to fix Dave\u2019s stuck knee, or maybe barter my time helping him for what I needed, but he wouldn\u2019t even give me the time of day because he was gonna fix it all himself, even though everything in his park was just rusting to heck untouched.\u201d\n\u201cThen he\u2019s not gonna let us in anyway,\u201d I say.\n\u201cCan we maybe just go look?\u201d Dave asks. \u201cI mean, even just drive around it even if we can\u2019t get in?\u201d\nMarty is leaning forward from the back seat, and he\u2019s one hundred percent here, which doesn\u2019t happen too often anymore. \u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cIf it\u2019s outside the gates, and if we can get to it, and if the yes/no machine doesn\u2019t give us a hell no, we\u2019ll drive around it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Dave says, and is quiet after that.\nSure enough the Playland exit is right after where the high walls that line the highway finally taper down and away and we leave Middleton behind. Middleton, it seems, didn\u2019t want to take the park with them when they redrew their town lines in concrete. I take the exit and the yes/no machine flickers only slightly brighter. Maybe we\u2019ll even find somewhere independently certified to eat out here and a safe place to either stay or park the car overnight.\nThe sun is low in the sky; I\u2019d forgotten how long we\u2019d been driving. The yes/no machine is still not telling us to get out, as I pass over the road scanners and into the abandoned roads of old Middleton.\nPlayland is not hard to find. There\u2019s a bunch of defaced billboards and signs pointing the way, and already I can see the big fake palm trees up ahead over the cramped streets and low buildings. Only a few houses have barbed wire around them.\nWhen we hit the street with the park on it I slow down, and because there is no traffic behind me I brake in front of the wide front gates.\nThey are open.\n\u201cCan we go in?\u201d Dave asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say immediately. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that should be open. What if someone is robbing or vandalizing the place right now? We don\u2019t want to get in the middle of that.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks pretty quiet,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cSure does,\u201d I say. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me like it better.\u201d In point of fact, it made me like it a whole lot worse.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see from here,\u201d Dave complains. \u201cCan\u2019t we just, you know, pull in a little bit? Just enough for me to see if there are any more of my kind there?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say again. I pull ahead, and park the car on the side of the road just past the gates. There\u2019s a convenience store across the street, lights on and open sign lit. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask if they know what\u2019s going on here, okay? If the park\u2019s not supposed to be open like that they can call the local police, if there are any. You two wait right here. Got it?\u201d\n\u201cGot it,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cI\u2019m trusting you,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I get out of the car, lock it, and skip across the street. The sun is below the skyline now and a streetlight comes on just as I run under it. I glance back and I can see Dave and Marty in the car right where I left them, so I go through the metal detector into the shop. The back half is all hard liquor and edibles, in a cage, with an employee on the far side who looks up from a magazine when I walk in, but I\u2019m not interested in anything in there, so the man loses interest in me just as fast. The woman behind the counter barely moves from where she\u2019s leaning against the counter as I walk up and put a few bags of snacks on the scanner. You get better info if you\u2019re not asking just for free.\nShe rings it in, and scans my phone. We wait for it to report that it\u2019s not a stolen ID, then report that I\u2019m not a wanted criminal or a tax escapee, then finally sends the charges.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all set, honey,\u201d she says when it rings through. Been a while since I\u2019ve been broke enough to get declined, but I still have that sharp bite of relief every time I don\u2019t.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cHey, I was noticing the gates of the dino park are open. That guy didn\u2019t get off his ass and finally start fixing the place up, did he?\u201d\nShe snorts. \u201cKurt? Fix something? Not a chance. Sold it a month ago, though. Never heard someone complain that much about getting so much money for shit before, but that\u2019s the kind of man he was. Haven\u2019t met the new owner yet.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, I just wondered,\u201d I say, and pick up my things.\n\u201cI loved that place when I was a kid,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou could go in and talk to the dinos and they\u2019d talk back to you and it was magical. Makes me sad every day to see it falling apart along with everything else in the world. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, even though I\u2019m probably a third as old as her and the world\u2019s been falling apart as long as I\u2019ve been in it. At least I know what it\u2019s like to have a dinosaur talk back to me, except mine is full of moping and complaints rather than handy, cheery facts about ginormous Pleistocene bugs.\nI leave the store, and wait for a lone van, rusted out and smelling of old-school gasoline fumes, to pass. Dude behind the wheel is looking at me, and if I didn\u2019t have my arms full of chips and candy bars I\u2019d\u2019ve flipped him the finger just on principle. But he keeps going, and I start across the empty street and am halfway across before I realize Marty is standing about halfway between the car and the gate, moving back and forth in agitation.\nI run.\nMarty sees me coming and recognizes me, and I get to him before he can run into the road to meet me and get him back safely on the sidewalk. \u201cCassie!\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask. He doesn\u2019t look hurt, just confused. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nMarty points. The passenger car door is open, and Dave is gone. \u201cHe told me I had to help him,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHe went into the park, didn\u2019t he?\u201d I say. It\u2019s not really a question. I check the trunk, and sure enough the modified furniture dolly with big rubber wheels that Dave uses to get his head around outside is gone.\n\u201cHe told me I had to,\u201d Marty says again. He is wringing his hands between bouts of flapping them, and I throw the junk food into the back of the car, get Marty\u2019s sweater out, and wrap him up in it. It\u2019s not cold, but the weight of it usually helps him calm down. This time, it takes a while.\nIt\u2019s getting dark out, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving Marty in the car alone. \u201cWe can come back for Dave tomorrow,\u201d I say.\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d Marty shouts, and starts shaking again. \u201cWe have to go get him now! What if we leave and they won\u2019t give him back?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll go get him.\u201d\nWhen Marty is calm again I lure him back into the car with a candy bar, and then I stare at those gates for a minute as if I can make Dave get his ass back out here on his own by force of fury.\nWhen that doesn\u2019t work, I get behind the wheel, back the car up, and I drive through those goddamned fucking gates to go get that goddamned fucking asshole dinosaur head.\nThe parking lot is larger than it looked from the outside; Playland must have been popular in its prime. I\u2019m halfway across it when the sensors for the lot lights figure out I\u2019m there and come on, lighting the place up one empty, Dave-less row at a time until I can see the actual park entrance, dead ahead, and next to it a far-too-familiar beige, armored Luxauto. I yank the wheel hard to the left and turn, accelerating, but already the gates we came in through have swung closed.\nBastard. I should have known it was a trap, but I didn\u2019t think even Dave would be this dumb. Or this selfish.\nI turn again and head toward the Luxauto. I can see my father now standing beside it, arms crossed over his chest, and even though it\u2019s still too dark I know all too well the smug-ass smile he\u2019ll have on his face. For a half-second I think about just ramming the Luxauto\u2014pretty sure my ex-cruiser is a decent match for it\u2014but I\u2019ve got Marty with me, so I don\u2019t. I do park close enough that he has to get out of the way or get trapped between the two cars; I missed kissing his side mirror with mine by about a centimeter, because I\u2019m that good.\nI get out, and so does Marty, and it takes a second for Marty to figure out what\u2019s happening. \u201cTed,\u201d he says, and the word is as close to a swear as anything I\u2019ve ever heard him say.\n\u201cMartin,\u201d my father says. \u201cStill alive, I see.\u201d\n\u201cAt least one of us has to outlive you, so someone can spit on your grave,\u201d Marty says. \u201cI owe my sister at least that.\u201d\nMy father shrugs, as if to say he doesn\u2019t care, which he doesn\u2019t and never has. I don\u2019t know how my mom fell for him at all, much less for so long, since it\u2019s clear as day to me that all he ever wanted was to undermine and steal her work to preserve his own stupid empire, but people can be incredibly smart and stupid at the same time, especially when the heart is involved.\nLike driving through those big open gates after Dave.\n\u201cYour mechanical friend is inside, looking for family,\u201d my father says. \u201cI should have warned him that family is always a disappointment.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny, coming from you,\u201d I say.\nI pat Marty reassuringly on the shoulder. \u201cWait in the car. I\u2019ll go get Dave,\u201d I tell him.\n\u201cUh-uh-uh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d my father says, and waggles a finger at us. \u201cPrivate property.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got permission from the owner,\u201d I lie.\n\u201cReally? When did I give you that?\u201d my father asks.\n\u201cYou have to be shitting me,\u201d I say. \u201cYou went and bought an entire fucking dinosaur park just so you could lure us here? Why? What the hell do you want?\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I want,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s true that I do, but now it\u2019s my turn to shrug like I don\u2019t care. He frowns. \u201cI\u2019ll make this easy, no more games. I know about your little secret safety deposit box in Fairham. Give me the key.\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell do you know about that?\u201d I explode. \u201cYou cheating, scheming, murdering son of a bitch\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d he commands. Oh, he looks so fucking proud of himself, too. \u201cAnd you know perfectly well I didn\u2019t kill your mother.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t save her, though. You could have. You knew there was a hit out on her.\u201d\n\u201cSo? Life isn\u2019t fair, Cassie,\u201d he says. \u201cGet over it. I want what\u2019s mine. I want the key.\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t find it when you had Marty\u2019s house tossed, huh?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow many times now? Three? Four?\u201d\n\u201cFour,\u201d he says, \u201cthough how you could tell with that mess I can\u2019t begin to guess. Seriously, how can you live like that? You could have so much more, Cassie, if you just used what you\u2019ve got and started thinking like a winner.\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how Dave found out about this park. You left a brochure around for him to find? Or did you just arrange this visit directly?\u201d\n\u201cAsk him yourself,\u201d my father says. \u201cThe key?\u201d\nHe holds out his hand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hidden back at the house,\u201d I say. \u201cGuess your guys just suck at looking.\u201d\nHe shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not at the house,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you knew we\u2019d been inside, there\u2019s no way you\u2019d leave anything valuable there. I know you have it on you, so hand it over and I\u2019ll let you collect your dinosaur head and go on your way.\u201d\n\u201cNo deal,\u201d I say. \u201cYou want me to think like a winner, well here it is: the key is worth a lot more than that, certainly way more than one dumb robot dinosaur head that leaks oil on the carpet and sold me out to you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you want in return? Don\u2019t expect to get much.\u201d\n\u201cNever got anything except pain from you anyway,\u201d Marty interjects. He\u2019s still with us, not drifting, and for once I wish he was because the look of grief on his face is like a gut punch.\n\u201cI want you to stay out of Marty\u2019s house,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I want two hours to go do some parts shopping in the park, after I find Dave.\u201d\n\u201cOne hour, including finding your dino head,\u201d my father says. \u201cThen you hand me the key before you leave the park. Take the offer: I don\u2019t want to hurt you, but I\u2019ll do whatever I have to. Think of your uncle. Or what\u2019s left of him.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll hand you the key at the open gates,\u201d I say.\n\u201cDeal.\u201d\n\u201cDeal, then,\u201d I answer. \u201cMarty, grab the toolbox out of the trunk and come with me. You coming, Ted?\u201d\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201d\nI lock the car and set the three separate alarm systems I\u2019ve got on it, and we head into the park to find Dave. It\u2019s full-on twilight now, and the park\u2019s working lights few and far between, but I have flashlights in the toolbox\u2014a big rolling thing with a handle, one of my better investments\u2014and hand Marty one. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask him.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says, and flips the light on. \u201cSometimes, though, it feels like I\u2019m here and then I\u2019m there and I\u2019m not sure where or when, or what\u2019s happened already or not happened or I dreamed it, you know? I thought I gave Ted a black eye.\u201d\n\u201cYou did, and it was a beaut. But that was three years ago,\u201d I say. \u201cMight need to re-up it on our way out of here.\u201d\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d he says.\nWe walk forward into the park, look at the fading signs. \u201cSauropods that way,\u201d I say and point.\nMarty starts to walk, then meanders to a stop and looks back at me. \u201cHow\u2019d you get so big, Cassie?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jennie? Did she save the world?\u201d\n\u201cMom\u2019s gone,\u201d I tell him, and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s dark because I don\u2019t want to see his face and I don\u2019t want him to see mine either. We\u2019ve done this too many times before\u2014remembering is a bitch and a half. \u201cHey, we\u2019re here in Middleton Parkland and we have to find Dave and we can grab some parts, okay? Stay with me, here.\u201d\n\u201cMiddleton? But the owner\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt changed hands. We\u2019ve got an arrangement. But we only have an hour. Look around. Focus, okay? What do we need?\u201d\n\u201cDave is here?\u201d he asks, but he\u2019s walking forward again now without the hesitation of moments before. \u201cAll of him?\u201d\n\u201cJust his head,\u201d I say.\n\u201cAll on his own?\u201d\n\u201cYou built him a motorized cart out of a furniture dolly, remember?\u201d\nWe\u2019re nearer one of the working lights, so I can see him grin back at me. \u201cRight!\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a clever bit of work on my part. Had to make him promise not to get into trouble with it, though.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d I say, and wave my hands around us. \u201cWelcome to trouble.\u201d\nThe Sauropod Swamp is up ahead, past a collapsed snack hut, and I can see the long, unmoving necks of three of Dave\u2019s model sticking up into the night sky like strange smokestacks. I follow along the low wall, Marty behind me, until around a curve we find Dave, on his dolly, staring up at the nearest sauropod robot.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all dead,\u201d he says, when we are near enough to hear, and he sounds so sad and heartbroken that just for a second I almost forgive him for walking us into a trap with my father. Almost.\nOkay, not really very close at all. But a little tiny bit.\n\u201cMarty, you think you can see if we can get a knee motor out of one of them?\u201d I ask, and he\u2019s already pawing through my open toolbox. He\u2019s been centered for longer than I\u2019ve seen in a while, and maybe it\u2019s just all about keeping him with a new challenge in front of him. Or we\u2019re lucky.\n\u201cBe right back, Cassie,\u201d he says, and climbs over the wall into the weeds and garbage.\nCan a giant animatronic robot dinosaur head avoid looking you in the eye? Yes. Yes, it can. So I went over and gave him a good, solid, totally ineffective kick.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cYou knew it was my father?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dave says. He\u2019s still not looking at me. He clacks a few times, then adds, \u201cbut I could have guessed, if I\u2019d thought about it. I just wanted to come find another Euhelopus, and when the cable guy said there were some here, dug a brochure out of his truck\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have cable,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had cable. And you said you found the brochure.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I lied a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd when you saw him? You still came in?\u201d\n\u201cI only saw the Luxauto,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought maybe there was a chance it wasn\u2019t his. Look, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just a stupid, selfish head and you\u2019d be right to just leave me behind here.\u201d\n\u201cHell yes I would, and I would have,\u201d I say. \u201cBut then Marty would be upset, and I\u2019d have a giant headless dinosaur in the backyard. With my luck raccoons or some shit would take up living in your neck and it would be a goddamned health hazard.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be terrible,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I look at the time. Thirty-eight minutes left. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go see if I can help Marty, and you\u2019re going to stay right the fuck here, right?\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d he promises.\nThis time he does meet my eyes, so I climb over the fence and head for where I can hear Marty banging around. I find him and he\u2019s chatting with the other guys in the garage, totally lost as to where he is and what\u2019s going on, but he\u2019s got most of the rusting plating off one of the sauropod\u2019s legs and is up to his shoulders inside, working the socket wrench.\n\u201cMarty?\u201d I ask.\nHe pulls his head out of the cavity. \u201cJennie!\u201d he says. \u201cYou came by the shop to help out? And what did you do to your hair?! You better not let Mom see that.\u201d\n\u201cI came to help,\u201d I say. Grandma was dead before I was even crawling, and sometimes it feels like everything I know about her is from her guest appearances in Marty\u2019s wandering mind.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he says. \u201cThe strut on this truck is totally shot, and rusted to boot. Can you hand me the adjustable wrench? The big one.\u201d\nI hand it to him, and his head disappears back inside. \u201cGreg and Barry are gonna go on a coffee run; machine is busted again. If you want anything, tell \u2019em I\u2019ll cover it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d I say.\nHe emerges again, a giant smudge of grease across his nose, and hands me a sauropod knee motor. \u201cNo wonder this is all messed up,\u201d he says, \u201cyou ever see a wheel strut like that?\u201d\n\u201cCouple of times,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a knee. We\u2019re in the Middleton Prehistoric Playland, looking for parts to fix Dave. I need you here now, okay?\u201d\nMarty blinks at me, then looks around, looking for Greg and Barry and Linda and Scoops, the garage dog. Then he seems to deflate, his arms hanging down by his side, wrench dangling from his hand. \u201cWe were happy then,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I take the wrench from his hand, put it back in the toolbox, bungee the salvaged joint motor across the top. \u201cWe\u2019re happy now too, just a different kind of happy. But we\u2019ve got about fifteen minutes to get out of here, and it\u2019s almost that long a walk back to the entrance. Anything else you want to grab, do it quick.\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s all we need.\u201d\nWe climb back over the wall to where Dave is still waiting. \u201cWe gotta go,\u201d I say. \u201cKeep up as best you can.\u201d\nWe run for the entrance. Marty is not any slower than me while I\u2019m hauling the toolbox along with me, and Dave has the control lead for the dolly in his mouth and is zooming along behind us. We are most of the way there when Marty swerves off to one side and around a big, fake, graffiti-covered rock into the Precambrian Picnic Place. I\u2019m trying to stop without running myself over with the toolbox or getting crushed by Dave when Marty comes running out past the far side of the rock, smiling his best smile, and his pockets and shirt are bulging.\n\u201cTrilobites!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cI can program them for all kinds of things!\u201d\nSure, whatever. If it keeps him busy and present, I can handle some creepy-ass robot bugs around the house. Maybe he can program them to clean.\nWe reach the entrance with about a minute and a half to spare. My father watches, still leaning against his armored car, as I load Dave, Marty\u2014who I swear dropped at least a dozen hockey-puck-sized trilobites on the seat around him\u2014and the dolly, toolbox, and knee back in the car.\n\u201cWe have a deal,\u201d he says, when I\u2019m done.\n\u201cSafety deposit box key and then you leave us alone,\u201d I say. \u201cYou gave your word.\u201d\n\u201cTo be specific, the key to your Fairham First box,\u201d he says. \u201cNumber 131. No switching it up. I don\u2019t trust you to not play me on the details.\u201d\nI take a deep breath. I always knew, eventually, he\u2019d get ahead of me, and I always thought I\u2019d be able to play it cool, but my hands are shaking as I reach over my shoulder and down the back of my T-shirt, and break the tiny stitches where the little flat key has sat snug along my bra strap for years now. I hold it out in the palm of my hand.\nMy father reaches for it, and I close my first. \u201cFirst, open the gates,\u201d I say. Dammit, I am not going to cry, not in front of him. \u201cI know better than to trust you, either.\u201d\nHe signals to someone I can\u2019t see, and a moment later the gates at the end of the parking lot open. I make a show of getting in my car, and backing it out and turning around, and he walks over to stand in front of me. He knows, despite everything, that I won\u2019t kill him. Mostly because I\u2019ve had better opportunities than this.\nI roll down the window, and I hold the key out. He steps out from in front of the car and takes it, and the moment the key is out of my hand I floor it, my good ol\u2019 grease-V8-cruiser, and we\u2019re out of there like a fucking cannonball. We swerve out onto the street hard, which we\u2019re lucky as hell is empty, and I can just see the woman in the store across the street peering out the window as we tear away from there, back toward the highway and away from Middleton as fast as we can go.\nDamned fucking yes/no machine ought to have a color just for proximity to my father.\n\u201cI hate him,\u201d Marty says quietly in the back seat.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give us a choice not to,\u201d I answer. \u201cBut he\u2019ll leave us alone, at least for a little while. Bastard likes being a man of his word, the magnanimous leader, until he figures out the loopholes in whatever he promised.\u201d\n\u201cAt least we got away,\u201d Dave says.\n\u201cAt what cost?\u201d Marty asks. \u201cWhat is it that he wants from you so badly as to go through all of this?\u201d\n\u201cSomething of Mom\u2019s,\u201d I say. Something she left for me, to save it from him, save me from him.\n\u201cAnd now he\u2019ll have it,\u201d Marty says. He leans forward and whacks Dave\u2019s head, although not hard. \u201cThis is your fault.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I said I was sorry!\u201d Dave complains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all done now,\u201d I say. I can see a drive-through ahead, one of the more reputable chains, and I\u2019m tired enough that I swing into the lane and get food for everyone. If we have the shits tomorrow, well, we\u2019ll suck it up. I don\u2019t want to stop again until we\u2019re home, even if I have to drive all night.\nIt\u2019s close to noon before I get out of bed and find Marty aimlessly wandering around the living room, and I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s here or not, but he\u2019s not talking to anyone else, so maybe? \u201cMorning, Uncle,\u201d I say.\n\u201cCassie,\u201d he says. He points to where I dumped all our crap on our way in at four AM. \u201cThe fellows at the garage dropped off a new knee for Dave.\u201d He holds up a trilobite. \u201cAlso they brought me a bunch of these! I think I can reprogram them . . . \u201d\n\u201cI bet you can,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat are you going to have them do?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll need to dig into their code set. I haven\u2019t had a project this fun in a long time.\u201d His face falls. \u201cBut I should fix Dave\u2019s knee, first. He\u2019s been so very patient.\u201d\nI don\u2019t comment on that. Instead, I pick up the knee motor. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I say.\n\u201cThanks, Cassie! You\u2019re the best. I wish the guys would get back here with the coffee, though. Machine is busted again . . . \u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be along soon,\u201d I say. Greg died of stomach cancer four years ago, and is buried only a few rows over from my mom. I don\u2019t know where the others are. The garage itself is now a dry cleaner.\nDave has put his head back on his neck, and is looking out over the neighborhood. \u201cHey, Cassie,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHey, Dave. I\u2019m going to put that joint motor in. I need you to not move, because if you think I\u2019m mad about the road trip, you have no idea how pissed I\u2019ll be if you squash me,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t count? Thanks a lot,\u201d I say, as I pull off the leg plate. There\u2019s a little bit of rust on the edges, and I\u2019ll have to get out here with a wire brush and some touch-up paint in the next month or two.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Dave says.\nAnd I know what Dave meant, but I also know sometimes you gotta adjust your expectation of what counts as alone and what doesn\u2019t, because nobody has a perfect picture life, or not for very long.\nDave still has his neck craned all the way up. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cBeige cars,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I say. \u201cMy father will be on the road to Fairham by now, if he\u2019s not there already. Gonna go personally, too; can\u2019t delegate that to any of his flunkies. Now hold still.\u201d I grab the floor jack designed for house joists and I wedge it up under Dave\u2019s butt crack to keep him steady, just in case.\nDave doesn\u2019t really have a butt crack, of course, but there\u2019s a plate up under the base of his tail where there\u2019s the vague, diplomatic suggestion of something of the sort, and up inside above that plate there\u2019s a small box wrapped in brown paper and tied with green ribbon, with my mother\u2019s handwriting on it: just my name, the words you will know when to use it, and a heart. If I close my eyes I can picture it exactly, and feel the weight of it in my hands, remember the paper cut I got when I wrapped it back up too fast after I realized what the vials inside held, and what my father would do to get them.\nLike buy an entire falling-down park so he could weasel a key out of me. Fucking ridiculous, this long game of ours.\nWhen I was eight, he came to our house where I was playing in the backyard, and gave me a little plastic pony with rainbow hair and told me how much he loved me and what a smart girl I was, and then asked me if I knew where Mommy\u2019s secret hiding place was. I showed him a recently-dug spot in the garden, where I had insisted my mother help me bury a roadkill skunk a few weeks earlier. Didn\u2019t tell him that part, though. I was a smart girl even back then.\nI wonder if he\u2019ll recognize the pony toy, when he finally gets my safety deposit box open. He may have left Dave a Playland brochure, but I left a receipt for the box rent for him to find, \u2019cause I knew eventually he\u2019d search the house. Girl\u2019s gotta have lots of extra cards up her sleeve, right?\nOr right in the palm of her hands.\nThe hand sanitizer bottle I keep at my porter station at the airport is getting low, and by fall I\u2019ll need to refill it. For now, though, my mom\u2019s package can stay safely where it is, as her work, little by little, goes bon voyage around the world.\nIt takes me an hour and a half to get the knee replaced, then I let Dave back down off the jack and step back, wiping sweat from my forehead with the greasy back of my hand. \u201cGive it a try,\u201d I say.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Dave asks.\n\u201cJust do it, dumbass,\u201d I answer.\nHe takes a tentative step, and the knee actually bends, just like it\u2019s supposed to, and thirty seconds later I\u2019ve got a gigantic metal robot sauropod frolicking in the goddamned yard.\nMarty comes out and puts an arm around my shoulders. \u201cYou did good, Cassie,\u201d he says. \u201cDefinitely got the family engineer genes. Your mom would\u2019ve been proud.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d I say, though it never hurts to hear. Well, maybe a little.\n\u201cCome on inside,\u201d he says. \u201cThe guys are bringing over beer and pizza tonight, and we\u2019re going to discuss what to do with the trilobites. You don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d\n\u201cNot for anything in the world,\u201d I say. \u201cI just need to clean up our tools and I\u2019ll be in.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Don\u2019t take too long\u2014you know how Barry is around unguarded pizza.\u201d\n\u201cI sure do,\u201d I say.\nMarty heads inside, and I can hear him talking to one of his memories, excitedly explaining about the trilobites. I take out my device and order a pizza to be delivered, along with a six-pack of root beer, then pack up the rest of my tools.\nDave comes back over and bends his head way down to where we are nose to nose. \u201cWhat if he comes back?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cHe will, sooner or later. He has to, once he realizes he still hasn\u2019t won. Just try to be less stupid next time,\u201d I say.\n\u201cNo, I mean, what if he finds that thing he wants?\u201d\n\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d I say. I pat him on the nose. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.

Turn gray with the pitch-black night?\u201d\n She would always remember that summer day. Father\u2019s enormous shadow settled upon her; she looked up from her workbook.\n \u201cLilian.\u201d Father squatted before her desk, the crimson clouds outside draped across his shoulders. Father said her name again, then once more. Funny; never had there been a man like him who delighted so much in his daughter\u2019s name.\n She laughed. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He knew that she was doing her homework, of course, but he longed for a father-daughter conversation.\n Mother said that Father didn\u2019t have a way with words, that he was quiet. She couldn\u2019t imagine her father like that. But he definitely didn\u2019t quite know how to communicate. He\u2019d leave for work and half a month would fly by; when he returned, he\u2019d only speak nonsense to his family.\n Father stood beside her, looking at her homework. The computer had already gone into screensaver mode; bright green, heart-shaped clouds darted across the black interface. Father swept his hand over the screen. A depth view of the interior of a railway car burst onto the gallium nitride screen. The scenery outside sped by the windows; inside, fourteen pink goldfish sat stiffly on the same bench, their bodies swaying with the forward motion of the train, their eyes spinning as they watched the clouds whirling throughout the cabin. This was the screensaver that Father had programmed just for her.\n The only one in the whole universe. He always took great pains to make strange and unique gifts for her.\n Father picked up the computer and tapped the goldfishes\u2019 heads in a particular order, unlocking the computer.\n \u201cSummer homework? Hasn\u2019t school started already?\u201d he asked.\n Of course he knew that this was summer homework. Mother had sent him to check up on her, after all.\n \u201cIt\u2019s due tomorrow.\u201d\n Father took a closer look. Although Lilian was only ten years old, she could still sense her father\u2019s awkwardness. He really wasn\u2019t good at this.\n \u201cWhy did you leave this question blank?\u201d Father asked. And only he would ask such a question; the answer was obvious, embarrassing. Embarrassing to the point where Lilian couldn\u2019t even respond.\n \u201cWrite about an unforgettable trip to outer space that you took this summer.\u201d He read the question aloud, and then he understood.\n The sky had darkened. Cars whistled past on the nearby highway, the sound sharp and penetrating.\n It was as if they were sinking, sinking from the abundance of the Earth to this tiny apartment. Compared to the peeling outer walls, the dilapidated furniture inside wasn\u2019t such an eyesore.\n Regardless of whether they\u2019re rich or poor, people can always find a way to live with dignity, with beauty. Mother had said that. Lilian\u2019s parents lived like that, too. They did their best to make their home comfortable and fitting; they tried their hardest to create the same learning environment for her as her classmates had. Even if they didn\u2019t have the money for a microcomputer implant, Father still found a way to make her old graphene tablet retro and stylish, so that even her classmates were envious of her.\n She thought they\u2019d always be able to deal with poverty.\n Until she saw that question.\n An unforgettable trip to outer space? Her family couldn\u2019t afford such an expense, not even one trip to summer camp on the Moon. She\u2019d never mentioned this to her parents; they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Her classmates flashed their photos in their group chats: tender moments from within flight cabins, the first footprint on the moon, things drifting in the currents of Europa\u2019s surface oceans\u2014and, of course, no end to the commemorative sites on the planets of the Phoenix Belt. And she, stuck at home, would keep refreshing her classmates\u2019 feeds like an addict; she paid the most attention to these posts and photos, each the same as the last. On the first day of school, she skipped class.\n Her teacher had let Mother know that she\u2019d skipped class; Mother had sent Father, who\u2019d just returned home. Lilian would rather have been scolded by her teacher in front of her entire class than face her father like this.\n \u201cI\u2019ve already done the research; I can put something together in half an hour,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI think we can tweak that screensaver of yours.\u201d Father\u2019s eyes gleamed; as he spoke, his fingers flew over the keyboard.\n \u201cHow about when the clouds touch the goldfish, the goldfish spit out bubbles? What do you think\u2014pretty cool, right?\u201d\n Many years later, she\u2019d remember his face, glowing with enthusiasm. Father was like those children in old movies setting off fireworks, all his attention on the strange new thing he was creating. He wasn\u2019t avoiding embarrassment\u2014he had already forgotten it.\n She kept her graphene tablet. She\u2019d rolled it into a bundle, carrying it with countless other possessions in her suitcase as she went from place to place. Although the tablet was old, it functioned solidly and was still in good condition. Even after being flung out by a few angry landlords, it was still fine.\n When she was 22, she turned on the tablet before someone, showing him the screensaver that Father had made for her. He\u2019d been astounded. He didn\u2019t know that she hadn\u2019t turned on the tablet in ten years, just as she didn\u2019t know then that she\u2019d fallen in love with him. They sat in a little nook in her dorm. It was raining outside, pitter-patter. He listened to her talk about her childhood, the silly things her father would do, that question on her summer homework. She actually remembered it.\n \u201cI received full marks on that question. The first time.\u201d\n \u201cAwesome.\u201d\n \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n She stroked the screen. Those dead-serious goldfish. Delicate rainfall and no other sounds. The wind seeped into her skin; she curled up. \u201cFather spent three days answering that question for me.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t exactly convincing. Her teacher thought the planet she described violated the laws of physics and couldn\u2019t exist; Lilian had earned a zero on that assignment. Father was more furious than she was; he argued with her teacher, even succeeded in getting her teacher to change the grade to a passing one.\n \u201cBut actually, my teacher wasn\u2019t wrong. There was never such a thing as \u2018my visit to outer space.\u2019 My father must\u2019ve made the planet up. I don\u2019t know why he was so angry; he argued with every teacher about this question, defending his invention 24/7. My teacher must\u2019ve been scared of him in the end, thought he was too much of a hassle to deal with, and just changed the grade. Despite being terrible at conversation, he ended up winning the argument after all.\u201d\n But everything has its price. Not long after that incident, Lilian was suspended.\n \u201cSuspended? Why?\u201d\n \u201cNo reason. One day, I received the notice, and that was that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did your father say?\u201d\n \u201cHe wasn\u2019t there.\u201d She laughed. Once he\u2019d dealt with her summer homework, he\u2019d gone to another city; his work required him to travel a lot. Besides, even if he were at home, there was still nothing he could have done. He must have known that she\u2019d been suspended, but all he could do was call on the long-distance communiscope and mumble her name; he didn\u2019t know how to express condolences or regret. Such an awkward person, arguing with people over what he deemed important and never giving an inch. Like insisting that the landscape in her homework really did come from an actual planet. No matter what, he had to convince her teacher that the planet was real, that the essay was real. Like all other things that he thought needed to be protected, it didn\u2019t matter what price he had to pay; he\u2019d defend them until death.\n So, that question\u2014or, the fact that \u201csuch a planet does exist\u201d\u2014was actually far more important than she was: for the first time after so many years, this thought emerged clearly in Lilian\u2019s mind.\n Before this, she\u2019d never considered why she felt sad.\n Not a recollection, nor a thought.\n As long as she didn\u2019t know the reason, she wouldn\u2019t feel sadder.\n Lilian let out a long sigh, counted her heartbeats, and waited for her nose to clear. She felt as if a wave had passed over her, as if she were now floating up from the gloomy, icy depths to the surface of the ocean. His voice was like sunlight piercing down from above.\n He asked, \u201cYour father often wasn\u2019t home?\u201d\n \u201cDo you know about performance art? That\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n \u201cAre those what they call body artists?\u201d\n \u201cI guess so. Through physical performance and installations combined with dramatic elements, these artists convey experiences and ideas. They\u2019re not the same as actors either, oh no.\u201d\n \u201cSo serious.\u201d His eyes widened.\n \u201cNah.\u201d She laughed and changed the topic. But he returned to the previous one.\n \u201cI remember performance artists were really popular for a few years. If you had a party and didn\u2019t invite a performance artist, it wasn\u2019t a real party.\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t just a commercial pursuit\u2014early performance artists were also employed to advocate and influence government policy. But she didn\u2019t correct him.\n \u201cYeah. It\u2019s too bad that my father was just an ordinary performance artist; he wasn\u2019t particularly outstanding, and the money he made was barely enough to support our family. But he did genuinely enjoy his work.\u201d\n \u201cAnd then?\u201d\n \u201cNothing. In the end he still wasn\u2019t very successful.\u201d She glanced at the small box on the table. The top danced with green light. \u201cI downloaded some old movies. Let\u2019s watch them.\u201d\n They put on the VR headsets together. The induction cord connected to a designated spot on the cerebrum. As the movie played, microcurrents flowed through the probes on the induction cord, stimulating corresponding areas in the brain to create the illusion of being in the same time and place.\n Real illusions.\n People fell into it. Even if reason continuously asserted that this was fake, the body and all its senses had already been transported to virtual reality, experiencing uncanny adventure stories, secreting the pheromones of hate, terror, love, and joy. It might as well have been real.\n You could have it so long as you could pay the cash. No wonder people flocked to it. Who knew how many people the VR movie supply chain supported, including former performance artists.\n But Father surely wouldn\u2019t have agreed with this thought.\n He also wouldn\u2019t change professions.\n That is, if he were still alive.\n They watched Fellini\u2019s La Dolce Vita. At the twenty-minute mark, he fell asleep. So she didn\u2019t tell him that she\u2019d seen this movie dozens of times, even once on film; so she didn\u2019t tell him that she always thought Marcelli looked a little like her father; so she didn\u2019t tell him that her Marcelli-resembling father had later gone insane and killed someone and had never been caught.\n The rain kept falling that night. He left after they finished watching the movie. The raincoat he borrowed never returned.\n Over the next ten years, one after another, her other possessions were borrowed away. She also accumulated a couple things that she\u2019d borrowed and never returned. That became less frequent as the years passed. She was alone in the world; she threw herself into her work. She made only the barest of connections with people, carried no burdensome debts, and was never greeted by acquaintances on the street.\n So, at first, she didn\u2019t process that the old man sitting on the sofa across from her was calling her name.\n \u201cLilian, long time no see.\u201d\n She recognized that cheerful voice. \u201cHello.\u201d\n Every performance artist needs an agent to manage their career. Father especially. The old man before her was perhaps the only person on Earth who could work with Father. After Father went missing, he continued to manage Father\u2019s business, selling his installations, images, and souvenirs; every month, he\u2019d send money to Lilian and her mother.\n \u201cSo chill. I read that news report about you. It\u2019s next week, right? Humanity\u2019s first voyage through a wormhole.\u201d\n \u201cI probably don\u2019t really look like an astronaut.\u201d\n \u201cNot when you were little, at least. Amazing.\u201d\n People always talked about her like this. Especially people who knew her when she was little. She\u2019d grown up in poverty in a single-parent household; she was always climbing upward, finally becoming a top astronaut\u2014she must\u2019ve faced many hardships.\n They thought they knew. But they didn\u2019t know.\n Suffering isn\u2019t something you can understand simply by thinking about it.\n \u201cDid something come up?\u201d\n The old man glanced at the time, then stood. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving next week, right? I want to give you something before you go. Are you free in a little bit? My office is just upstairs. I\u2019m about to see a client; we should be done in about 40 minutes. Come see me then.\u201d\n She was still trying to figure out how to decline the invitation, but the moment had already passed.\n The old man had already walked over to the door of the tea room. \u201cOh right, how\u2019s your mother doing?\u201d\n \u201cShe passed away seven years ago.\u201d\n The old man looked back. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n She laughed. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t care at all.\u201d\n She was telling the truth. But putting it that way was probably unfair to the old man. He\u2019d already done his duty as an agent. Father was the old man\u2019s least profitable performance artist; on top of that, there was that notorious performance accident, after which he\u2019d completely vanished. The old man absolutely had reason to dissolve the lifetime contract with Father, but he hadn\u2019t. The good news was that, after the accident, Father\u2019s work gained a novelty factor and was suddenly marketable again. Without much effort, the old man could send Lilian and her mother some money. They weathered many hardships that way.\n Mother was grateful for the old man. Even though, from a businessperson\u2019s perspective, he was just fulfilling the terms of a contract. Lilian didn\u2019t understand Mother, but she admired her; admired that, after experiencing so much, she still saw hope in the world; admired that she left this world with her heart full of warmth and thankfulness. She wanted to be like her mother, but she couldn\u2019t.\n However, she could still sit in the tea room for a while before going upstairs to say hi, for old times\u2019 sake.\n Lilian took a tiny sip of tea\u2014there was no need to drink two cups at a place like this.\n \u201cHis understanding of this world was frank, fearless. You could see within brutal and bloody acts the possibility of love.\u201d She didn\u2019t know which patron had turned on the cable TV. The holographic image of a handsome man projected onto the empty floor in the middle of the tea room. His facial features, deportment, voice; there was nothing that couldn\u2019t be called perfect. And that beautiful body beneath the close-fitting glass-fiber material could make anyone\u2019s imagination roam. He was so confident; he knew that people would buy his act.\n Lilian knew that face: the most powerful art critic on Earth.\n Even if she weren\u2019t watching the TV, there was no way she could miss that face. He was everywhere. Bored, Lilian started to estimate how much it would cost to insure that well-crafted body. It was a good way to pass the time; after completing the computation, it was about time for her to get up and see the old man. The critic had just mentioned Boyce; he talked on and on, his words an unceasing flow like gems splashing onto a jade plate.\n Before his words could get her feet wet, Lilian strode out of the tea room.\n The man\u2019s office was as old-fashioned as he was: 20th century neoclassical style, with real leather sofas, abstract art, and, of course, a mahogany desk.\n \u201cWell?\u201d the old man asked, spreading both arms.\n She smiled and didn\u2019t make a sound.\n \u201cYou know, you\u2019re really quite like your father. Whenever I called to him on the street, I\u2019d have to call until my throat was hoarse for him to hear.\u201d\n Never really came across acquaintances on the street. She didn\u2019t explain it as such. \u201cDid you want to talk about something?\u201d\n \u201cYou know, recently your father\u2019s work has been doing well; collectors often pay high prices for his installations and performance images. The masses are jumping onto this bandwagon and buying anything that has to do with him; even a postcard with his portrait printed on it will sell several hundred thousand in a day.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Who would buy his things?\u201d She was astounded. Father\u2019s work was never particularly welcomed.\n \u201cIt\u2019s true. That man always minded his own business as he did things, never understanding others\u2019 feelings. So many employers only accepted his work reluctantly. He also always liked to ramble and say odd things.\u201d\n \u201cUsing pure aesthetics as a cure to rescue this world of its hysteria.\u201d She mimicked Father\u2019s tone as she spoke.\n The old man fell back in his chair and guffawed.\n She didn\u2019t laugh.\n In the end, the person who went insane was Father.\n The one who tried to rescue the world from hysteria ended up being hysteria\u2019s ultimate outcome.\n Mother always forbade her from watching that particular performance, even exhorting her on her deathbed to vow that she\u2019d never view it. But she\u2019d still seen it, and not just once. In her darkest moments, she\u2019d watched that recording on repeat with a morbid fascination. Although she wouldn\u2019t admit it, it was as if she could feel the same hysteria, to the point where she was shivering\u2014perhaps within that shivering she could get infinitely close to the answer to a question that she didn\u2019t know.\n Father\u2019s last performance. He\u2019d enclosed himself with a young elephant in a glass room the size of a shipping container. Every wall flashed with simulated images of the universe\u2019s birth and evolution: supernovae dilating; nebulae forming; unmeasurable amounts of interplanetary dust; the second generation of stars forming; gas giants coalescing; planets coming together to orbit binary stars; a dying star, its revolution stopped, half tundra, half inferno; all the lakes on a planet boiling under a thin atmosphere. Fast-forwarding, on endless loop. Time and space beyond human comprehension, all condensed in that moment into that shipping-container-sized glass room.\n One elephant and one human\u2019s universe.\n The simulation played without intermission, accompanied by an indescribable, terrible roar.\n Seven hours later, the young elephant went mad in its own excrement and urine. It howled and ran into the wall, and then into Father, crushing with all its weight his already badly mangled body; then, it rolled about. Blood, organs, shards of broken bone, and eyeballs splattered everywhere, landing on distant stars.\n The performance was over.\n An unsalvageable corpse and an insane elephant were the coda.\n In the initial shock, people believed that the performance artist couldn\u2019t have actually died. He\u2019d used a brazen trick, replacing himself with a clone to complete this deathly performance. \u201cThis ruthless murder not only tramples on the law, but also defiles aesthetics and ethics; it has violated humanity\u2019s basic decency.\u201d The person who took the lead in pointing this out was that art critic, condemning as he spoke.\n The police immediately set out to arrest him; hackers searched for every bit of information about Father and doxed him; bounty hunters organized and moved to bring this murderer to justice\u2014no cost was spared, but he escaped them all.\n With such an enormous net cast, he fled under cover of the hubbub that he himself had raised and was never seen again.\n Could the art collecting world suddenly admit such a notorious murderer ten years later?\n \u201cThey forgave him?\u201d she asked the old man.\n The old man shrugged. No comment.\n It was about time to leave. She rose and prepared to say farewell. The old man stopped her and took a large box out of a drawer.\n She opened the lid and found herself stupefied.\n \u201cI\u2019m sure someone would pay a fortune for this, but I think you should have it,\u201d the old man said.\n A stereoscope made of pearwood.\n The cover and separator on the photo viewing box were both lightproof, the lens was in good condition, the support slid on the track normally, and the copper knob shone like new. The stereoscopic mirror had been preserved well; it was as pristine as the day twenty years ago when Father had shown it to her.\n Of course, that photo was also in the box.\n She didn\u2019t touch it.\n Twenty years had passed, and it was only faintly yellow.\n \u201cMy summer homework,\u201d she murmured to herself.\n \u201cSo it\u2019s true; I thought he was kidding. How reckless, using this as source material.\u201d The old man stared at her, surprised. \u201cIs this a real photo, or was it manipulated?\u201d\n \u201cHe said it was real.\u201d She didn\u2019t make another sound and carefully put the lid back on the box.\n Another person\u2019s voice filled the room; the TV had turned on at its programmed time. A familiar silhouette appeared before them.\n \u201cNow, this person has high praise for your father. The world\u2019s foremost art critic,\u201d the old man said to her.\n This was the second time in an hour that Lilian had seen that face. She turned away.\n \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Lily,\u201d the old man said, looking into her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s already over.\u201d\n \u201cHe looks younger, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t blame him for what happened to your father. He\u2019s an art critic; that\u2019s his job. It\u2019s all in the distant past now.\u201d\n Twelve years ago wasn\u2019t that far in the past.\n At that time, that great art critic was still just a second-tier critic, fifty years old and struggling to make a name for himself among his colleagues. Serendipitously, he met Father.\n The critic had been led to a pitch-black seat in the theater beside the municipal square; he held a telescope-like object that had been given to every spectator\u2014the usher had told him that it was called a stereoscope. When a beam of blue light fell on a front-row seat, he raised the stereoscope according to the instructions. He saw a guy wearing a spacesuit leap onto the stage; the spotlight followed him as he made his way into the dark depths. The light went out; the astronaut had entered the darkness.\n Suddenly, a bright light came on. The entire theater was like a gleaming tin roof on a summer\u2019s day. When he opened his eyes, he was in another world.\n Were those trees? Trees that looked like storm clouds.\n The tree trunks were made up of fine, golden piping. The piping followed a regular pattern, intertwining to form a complex, braided shape; hundreds of millions of strands pleated together to form an even more dazzling shape. Above, the trunks fanned out into countless delicate branches, and the branches fanned out into even finer divisions; the iterations continued to spread until they were all over the egg-white sky, until the naked eye could no longer see them. Below the tree trunks, like a mirror of the branches above, the trees\u2019 enormous roots also grew in an awe-inspiring manner, spreading, expanding, and fanning out until roots as fine as a single strand of hair clung onto the surface of the silver rock below.\n At first glance, this unbelievable organism looked more like a tree trunk suspended in mid-air.\n Why would one think that this resembled a tree? Many parts were obviously wrong. He was, as far as the eye could see, in a completely uninhabited wilderness. Other than the white sky and the earth, it was just one giant-like tree after another.\n When the critic emerged from his initial shock, he found that he wasn\u2019t the only one in the theater.\n He and the astronaut wearing a cumbersome spacesuit were both immobile before this colossus.\n The critic put down his stereoscope.\n Everything went black; he had returned to his seat. Two photos of the same size were on the stage. The image on both photos was almost the same\u2014a tree suspended in a silver-white world.\n The astronaut was still there. He took off his helmet and turned toward the seats.\n \u201cDedicated to my daughter. This was her homework assignment.\u201d\n Scattered applause sounded from the seats. The few people in the audience made their way to the exit.\n \u201cWhat does this piece represent?\u201d The critic had come to Father\u2019s side.\n Performance artists never explain the meaning of their work. Father only smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019ll be another performance in half an hour. You can stay and watch again.\u201d\n \u201cThis is called a stereoscope?\u201d He changed the topic.\n \u201cYes, it\u2019s made up of a set of optical reflectors. It can shift lines of sight. You probably know that the images seen by the left and right eye aren\u2019t exactly the same; there\u2019s parallax\u2014it\u2019s as if two camera lenses a set distance apart from each other are taking a photo of the same object at the same time. The stereoscope can shift lines of sight, combine the images seen by the left and right eye, and create a 3D effect.\u201d\n \u201cPhoto?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a real photo. I used a 3D printer to make a space telescope, took the photo with a film camera, then enlarged the photo. Initially, it was for my daughter\u2019s summer homework. I first made a small 3D stereoscope with those two photos. Then I enlarged the photos and used them here.\u201d\n \u201cThis image was never manipulated\u2014it\u2019s a view from a real star? Which star?\u201d\n \u201cCetus \u03b43.\u201d\n The critic didn\u2019t believe the performance artist. His research confirmed his hunch; with humanity\u2019s current level of technology, it was impossible to observe Cetus \u03b43. Especially considering that the second star next to it was currently bursting into a planetary nebula. The dust and gases that it flung out would seriously impede any observation of Cetus \u03b43. It would be even more impossible to take such a clear picture.\n The photo that was so vivid he felt as if he were there turned out to be nothing more than a cheap manipulated image.\n In fact, the entire performance was just a cheap fa\u00e7ade. The great critic thought it was funny; he noted his impression of the performance and wrote a half-ridiculing, half-joking review. \u201cAn Innocent Counterfeit\u201d\u2014the title the critic picked at the last minute before publication.\n The critic wasn\u2019t aware that these nameless people were a gift that fate bestowed on him. The review that he\u2019d written without much effort received unprecedented attention and recognition; his style of unrestrained mockery left a deep impression on people, and his complete rebuffing of the performance was seen as honest and courageous. Several people became performance art enthusiasts after reading his review.\n For a moment, he became the object of the masses\u2019 attention, the darling of the art world; his likes and dislikes became everyone\u2019s likes and dislikes, and his viewpoint became everyone\u2019s viewpoint. The great art critic had finally become a real great art critic.\n At such a time, no one would be so foolish as to oppose him in public.\n Especially any affected parties.\n But Father did just that. He published a statement, doing the most to prove that the photo was real, upholding the value of his work. These were the two things he was least adept at\u2014arguing and defending himself. The few times that he and the critic crossed swords, he\u2019d been made a fool of relentlessly, falling countless times into presuppositional traps, many of which seemed to be of his own doing. Countless people joined this bout of grand mockery. His every word and every microexpression were captured and enlarged, becoming fodder for the art world, the entertainment world, comedians, and Internet commenters. People called him \u201cThe Person Who Saw Cetus.\u201d\n So Father became everyone\u2019s subconscious target. Back then, the more people loved the critic, the more they hated Father.\n From then on, he didn\u2019t have a single client.\n Was it then that he started to go mad?\n Though he didn\u2019t have clients, Father didn\u2019t give up on performance art. Out of some sense of significance, he also didn\u2019t give up arguing with the critic. Every new piece was a declaration of war against the great critic, a way for him to be good at something. The great critic would strike back with his most skilled hand. To outsiders, Father\u2019s losses grew more and more miserable, and the great critic attracted more and more attention. Regardless of whether they meant to, regardless of whether they\u2019d admit it, their meeting was an important point in each other\u2019s destinies.\n The more the winner wins, the more the loser loses.\n The war between the two started with a fake photograph and ended with a fake suicide.\n Perhaps he hoped that he\u2019d really died that way.\n That person, always unable to express anything clearly, always doing things that people didn\u2019t understand; why did he think he could wish for the na\u00efvet\u00e9 that others didn\u2019t have?\n Even if there weren\u2019t the great critic, there still wouldn\u2019t have been any difference in the way his life dropped off into the abyss.\n That person who saw Cetus.\n The old man was right. This had nothing to do with the critic; plus, so many years had already passed.\n She just couldn\u2019t understand why the critic had reversed his position on Father today, praising his work, even overturning his review from that time. Of course, the masses wouldn\u2019t remember all that.\n But she remembered\u2014she\u2019d seen all of Father\u2019s performance images and read all of the critic\u2019s reviews.\n Hugging the box as she left the old man\u2019s office, Lilian went straight home. Because the box was there, her normally comfortable home became a source of anxiety. In the end, she opened the box again. A lens, a photo, and also a slip of paper.\n This was absolutely the old man\u2019s style. Before, if he had anything to say to Father that he found difficult to express, he\u2019d leave a note like this.\n \u201cLilian, there\u2019s something you must know. Actually, if you paid more attention to the outside world, you should already know\u2014according to the latest DNA analyses, the blood left at the performance scene that year had fragments with variations; it couldn\u2019t have been from a just-cloned person. So, that performance really was your father.\u201d\n She stared at the slip of paper, chewing on the meaning of the two lines of text. Her eyes grew teeth; her heart grew teeth; the language center of her brain grew teeth. She chewed on these few lines of text that were harder even than pig iron. Teeth ground against pig iron; the sound was enough to make one itch.\n Her father was dead.\n The person her father killed twelve years ago in that performance had been himself.\n It was a real death performance.\n Once she understood this, she couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer and laughed.\n \u201cYou seem well,\u201d the astronaut beside her said.\n Just now, humanity had successfully crossed through a wormhole for the first time. Lilian didn\u2019t say anything; she was still a bit dizzy, and her muscles felt tight. The reality of going through a wormhole was as enormous as the universe to her. With humanity\u2019s current understanding of wormholes, it was still impossible to simulate a wormhole environment, impossible to do practice flights. Although they had theoretically mastered the crossing technology, there had been no way to experiment to confirm it. For the officials at the space agency, this flight was the verification. As long as it succeeded, they could use nuclear fusion spaceships to reach the before-unreachable stars that were a few hundred light-years away. Humanity couldn\u2019t resist this kind of attraction.\n She didn\u2019t mind being used as a test subject, even suggested that they had just her in control, with a GU-model AI replacing the other pilot. She thought they\u2019d agree, but in the end they sent the person beside her.\n Just as the calculations predicted, when they crossed through the wormhole, Cetus \u03b4 was in a bright phase. Soon they\u2019d discover the cool blue dot by the \u03b4 star. That was their destination\u2014Cetus \u03b43. The spaceship started to slow down.\n Everything was going as planned.\n The moment her toes touched the frozen rock of the surface, it was as if an electric current had charged forth. She felt pain, pain to where her helmet\u2019s visor fogged up, pain to where her tears turned conical\u2014the gravity here was one-fourth that of Earth\u2019s.\n She thought of that summer day, a silhouette crouching beside her. His shoulders cloaked with colorful clouds.\n \u201cAre you all right?\u201d her partner asked from the control room.\n \u201cDo you see that forest up ahead, golden, made up of enormous trees?\u201d\n \u201cAre they trees? So big?\u201d\n Lilian stooped, choked with sobs.\n \u201cAre you all right?\u201d her partner asked.\n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing; I just remembered why I wanted to come here.\u201d\n Originally published in Chinese in Cosmos Is Calling: Gogo, edited by Chen Kun, December 2015.\n Translated and published in partnership with Storycom.\n Tang Fei is a member of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.

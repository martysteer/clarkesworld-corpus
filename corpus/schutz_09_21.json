There is something about the stretch of the horizon, about the distance between you and each bright spark, numbers that feel so large as to be nearly impossible summed up in a simple gesture.\nSome might find it terrifying, but Simon\u2019s always found that anonymity to be a comfort. No matter how often he stumbles, how many mistakes he might make, they mean nothing against the great scope of the universe.\nAnd when the chance came, to throw himself into that expanse, to pull space around him like a favorite blanket and float through it like a dream, he threw himself at it with more will and want than he\u2019d ever done anything in his sixteen years of life.\nCaught up in the constellations, his very own satellite is just another spark in a vast sky, and there\u2019s something poetic about how it\u2019s only once he\u2019s surrounded by the vacuum of space that he\u2019s able to breathe deeply.\nSimon is the sole occupant of the communications satellite Nirah-89, and most days are this\u2014staring out at the stars, Earth indistinguishable from everything else in the universe, and caught up in the wonder that his little home manages to pick up anything at all.\nBut she does, and so he sits at his desk, listening to all of the messages that humans have sent into space, as sound waves flash by on his screen. He listens, notes where they are coming from and if there has been any response. For the older ones, the rusty and the rough, he pauses, runs them through his systems and his fingers until they\u2019re smooth once more, adjusting levels and tidying up tones until they\u2019re almost as good as new, and then he sends them on their way again.\nHow tragic would it be, after all, if one of these decades-old messages were to finally find its way to someone who needed it, and it was too tired to be heard?\nIn the grand scheme of things, he\u2019s just a little speck in the larger picture that is space expansion and exploration. Many of these oldest messages were sent before humans ever settled onto other worlds, before they expanded to the edges of their solar system and beyond, comingling with all they found there. And many of the newer ones are nothing important, echoes of letters home and shopping lists for space station stopovers that are months past, now.\nBut it\u2019s not his job, to determine which of these messages hold value. Simon is no museum curator, only selecting the most significant voices to honor. No, he\u2019s simply an archivist and janitor, tidying the papers he finds on the floor, leaving the sorting through them to decide which ones can be recycled for someone else.\nMaybe this is why he reacts the way he does, when a particular set of words come through his systems just as he\u2019s about to tuck himself into bed. He could blame the late hour (in the way that every hour is a late one, he runs off of his own time here, dictated by his needs for sleep and for food more than any number or clock), or the fact that it\u2019s midway between one supply ship visit and the next, meaning it\u2019s the longest he goes without talking to another person.\nWhatever it is, when he hears a stranger wonder if anyone is listening, hears how their voice breaks as they ask if anyone has ever, he does what janitors and archivists and satellites are never supposed to do.\nHe engages.\nHe answers.\n\u201cYes, I hear you,\u201d he says, and is shocked by how steady his voice is, when everything around him is vibrating. The satellite, as it continues its lonely orbit. His skeleton, at the breaking of rules, at the effort of reaching out. But his voice is steady, calm enough to almost feel like a lie, except that he never quite got the hang of lying, never thought to practice it with his peers, instead preferring to spend his time playing pretend with imaginary friends.\nMaybe that\u2019s why it feels so easy. With no visuals, he can close his eyes and pretend the voice belongs to some conjured companion, as opposed to a person, somewhere else entirely, only sharing this moment with him through happenstance and an inconsistent sleep schedule.\n\u201cAnd are you real?\u201d asks the soft voice, no hesitation, just hope.\nIt\u2019s a question Simon has asked himself before, on the days that bleed into nights and back again, where sleep is more memory than reality, and he\u2019s not sure if the ship is spinning or if that\u2019s all him.\nBut when faced with someone asking, the answer is easy.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\u201c . . . I think so.\u201d The reply is slower this time, but the words no less honest, no less bare. \u201cWasn\u2019t sure for a second, there. But I am now.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Simon smiles. \u201cYou\u2019ve reached the satellite Nirah-86. Do you have a message you would like to send?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d they say, and Simon would like to imagine that they are smiling back. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re not allowed to call. He knows, in theory, that many of the satellites make calls home. Often, even. There\u2019s only so far their entertainment packages can take them before something a little more substantial is needed, something more personal.\nIt\u2019s just that he\u2019s never done it. Called home. Not really something he\u2019s interested in, and most of the friends he\u2019d managed to make in school were fleeting at best, held together more by convenience than any real connection.\nAnd they\u2019re definitely not supposed to be responding to the messages they hear. At training, Simon had been told over and over that it was best to break down each message into collections of meaningless words. It makes them more objective, means that they wouldn\u2019t accidentally add their biases to the transmissions in the form of emphasis, cultural context, or translation.\nNirah-86\u2019s systems can speak almost every language humanity has ever made, plus an ever-growing database of alien dialects and settlement slang.\nSimon can only speak about seven, but he\u2019s working on it, over his morning meals and in the quiet moments the days find.\nHe still lets the computers do the translating. He just likes to follow along. Likes to understand.\nIt\u2019s easier to make their messages shine, when he has an idea of what they were doing, when they were sending them. Who they were, even if it\u2019s all just guesswork.\nImaginary friends, again.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m technically a prospector,\u201d they say. They\u2019ve talked well through Simon\u2019s night, and their voice is raspy. This time, not with the desperation that had them reaching out in the first place, but with the wear that comes through talking for hours with a stranger. \u201cBut I prefer gardener, and it\u2019s not like anyone is around to argue with me over it.\u201d\nTheir accent has the rolling highs and lows of Saturn\u2019s moons, settled early on in the expansion and largely unchanged since. Their name\u2014\u201cLyrical Wonder, but only my mothers use the full thing. Lyric is just fine\u201d\u2014also speaks of an old family, and Simon can\u2019t help but wonder what sent them spinning off-moon, landing in a digital swamp somewhere on Earth, combing through old deleted files and abandoned clouds for anything tangible.\n\u201cWhat do you do,\u201d he asks. \u201cWhen you find them?\u201d\nThat much discarded information makes the ground soggy, the air damp, a man-made bog with little in the way of life, and always a threat of spreading. That\u2019s what people like Lyric are there for, or so they explain. To keep the boundaries clear, to stop the slow creep, to encourage the growth of plants and things with roots that know to reach for the sun.\nSimon hadn\u2019t known that there were scraps of paper to be found, too. That sometimes the tossed info came in the form of books, newspapers from before either of them were born. But there are, and Lyric finds them, sifts through the mire with a net and a song, pockets full of pages.\n\u201cI plant them.\u201d Their smile is obvious in their words, an affection often reserved for pets or small children sneaking into their voice. \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, they\u2019ll grow.\u201d\nA garden, in the middle of a place that\u2019s supposedly known for its still water, its lack of life.\n\u201cWhat do they grow into?\u201d Simon can\u2019t imagine it, and there\u2019s a need in his words, to understand, to be able to picture it, if he can.\n\u201cOh, Nirah-86,\u201d And there\u2019s something intimate in Lyric\u2019s voice, as they shape the name of a satellite with their gentle tone. Something that cuts through the miles between them, like a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhatever they know how to be.\u201d\n\u201cSimon,\u201d he corrects them. \u201cThe satellite is Nirah-86. I\u2019m Simon.\u201d\n\u201cSimon, then.\u201d A little laugh. \u201cThis is usually where I shake a new friend\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll accept an IOU,\u201d he replies, before he can overthink it, and the laugh grows, passed between them until they\u2019re both giggling. A sound so small shouldn\u2019t be able to fill up the whole ship, Simon thinks, but it does, lingering in the corners like stardust.\nHe looks it up later, when Lyric\u2019s soft words have shifted into the even softer sounds of sleep. Recycled nanotech, something almost obsolete turned into art and metaphor instead. Fragments of things can grow in all sorts of ways. Most often, flowers with paper petals, folded as delicately as nature can manage, ink turned to gentle coloring and shades. Pretty, although not particularly useful.\nBut sometimes, under the hands of a good gardener, they\u2019ll grow into whatever they have words for. Whatever their bits of story captured.\nSimon sits, thousands of miles away from anyone at all, the sound of a new friend sleeping in his ears, and wonders if that isn\u2019t what they all do. Grow into whatever shape they have words for.\nIt\u2019s not supposed to be a sad thing, he thinks, as he feels his chest grow tight.\nBut he can\u2019t help but wonder what words he\u2019s missing from his own makeup. What he could become, if only his vocabulary were a little bit larger.\nMaybe it\u2019s time to work on language number eight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really only breaking the rules once.\u201d\nLyric\u2019s logic is a little sideways, in Simon\u2019s opinion. They approach problems from angles Simon hasn\u2019t learned how to see, offer solutions by skipping steps altogether, and they can deliver it all in such a steady tone that it doesn\u2019t even sound all that out there.\n\u201cAfter that, it\u2019s just phone calls home. And you\u2019re allowed those!\u201d There\u2019s a pause, and then a hurried addendum, their voice pitched up in panic. \u201cNot that I\u2019m calling myself your home, or anything!\u201d\nFunny. Lyric\u2019s voice has slipped so easily into the simple routines that make up his life. If they hadn\u2019t drawn attention to their phrasing, he would never have questioned it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d he assures them. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019re allowed to call friends. And there\u2019s no small print about how we\u2019re supposed to have met those friends.\u201d\nHe knows because he checked.\n\u201cIf anyone asks, we can say we met . . . \u201d\n\u201cOn a reality broadcast,\u201d Lyric suggests, anxiety discarded in favor of this new game. They\u2019d told him distractions always work best. \u201cAt a conference for left-handed folks.\u201d\nSimon\u2019s already laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not left-handed.\u201d\n\u201cNeither am I,\u201d Lyric admits, and they\u2019re laughing too. \u201cWe\u2019re time travelers, we met a century ago when we both went to assassinate the same person.\u201d\nThat shouldn\u2019t make him laugh harder, but it does, sends him spinning off to the corner of the room, because his satellite had decided it was the perfect day to run updates on its gravitational system, and he\u2019d forgotten to strap himself in.\nIt\u2019s what he blames, for the giddy, weightless feeling that talking to Lyric fills him with.\n\u201cHate to break it to you, but I\u2019m not a time traveling assassin, either.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet, you\u2019re not,\u201d Lyric chirps back, and Simon sees stars.\nSometimes, Lyric\u2019s words come quick and fast, and Simon has to scramble to keep up. But sometimes it\u2019s quiet days, where full minutes pass after starting a call before they even say hello.\nOn days where Lyric\u2019s words have run dry, he lets them listen in while he works.\nIt\u2019s only fair, he tells himself. They\u2019ve got him invested in each plant and scrap in their garden, so why not let them listen in as he works away on the messages that find him? And they get it, without him having to explain. Why it feels important, even if there\u2019s no one waiting on the other end.\nOf course, that\u2019s how it happens. He never would have done it on his own, wouldn\u2019t have had the words or the bravery to go with them.\nThe message is a short one, but crystal clear. A single voice, laughing weakly as the owner of the voice asks if anyone knows how to wrap up a broken ankle well enough to stand on it.\n\u201cSimon,\u201d Lyric says, voice gone tight with worry, with urgency.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admits. He took another language, instead of the first aid course. \u201cI can look it up, but we have no idea if they\u2019ll be able to hear us, if they\u2019re even still listening\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe can try.\u201d And Lyric\u2019s right, they should try, but he\u2019s frozen, too far away to be of any help, listening to the laughter turn into a pained whine as the stranger attempts to stand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d He feels like he\u2019s failing, like he\u2019s falling, but Lyric is there, calm in the face of someone\u2019s pain in a way they never quite manage with their own.\n\u201cPatch me through,\u201d they\u2019re saying. \u201cI know how, patch me through.\u201d\nAnd Simon breaks the rules a second time.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lyric says, talking to the stranger now. \u201cCan you hear me? We can hear you. I\u2019m Lyric, they/them. I can talk you through it. We\u2019re here to help.\u201d\nThe \u201cwe\u201d makes Simon wince. He\u2019s done nothing but connect them, connect them and panic.\n\u201cSup, Lyric,\u201d says the voice on the other end, and there\u2019s a relief to the voice now, a relief Simon lets sink into his own limbs. \u201cM\u2019Nova, she/her. Not to rush you, but I\u2019m not exactly in a place I\u2019m supposed to be, right now, so if you can speed run me through this . . . \u201d\nAnd Lyric does, steady and sure. Hands used to coaxing seeds made up of punctuation to grow in places they shouldn\u2019t be able to now walk Nova through a bandage wound like a trellis, not even stumbling when Nova explains that she\u2019s only got one hand to work with, on account of her other one being in the shop.\n\u201cGot strong teeth, though,\u201d she says, and Simon thinks of grins with bloody teeth, of what \u201csurvivor\u201d looks like in his mind, and adds to that image a low laugh, a voice raspy and sharp, like at any moment it\u2019s about to grow claws.\nWhen Nova is able to push herself to standing, Lyric actually claps, they\u2019re so caught up in the moment. If Simon were a little less frozen, he would have been right there with them.\n\u201cCute,\u201d Nova says, and then there\u2019s the sound of shouts in the background, and she curses.\n\u201cGotta go, thanks for the save!\u201d\nThe transmission ends, and Lyric and Simon sit in silence, the space given at the end of a song to let it really sink in.\nThis is the place to applaud, he thinks, and Lyric lets out a shaky breath that sounds like it\u2019s been held for far too long.\n\u201cThink we\u2019ll hear from her again?\u201d Lyric asks, hours later, and Simon marvels at how they can be so far apart and still thinking the same thing.\n\u201cHard to say,\u201d Simon says. \u201cNever really done this before. She seems like the kind of person to do whatever is least expected, anyway. Just to say she did.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Lyric hums for a few bars, which Simon knows means they\u2019re thinking.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to expect to not meet her again, then.\u201d\nSimon smiles, softer than he should. It\u2019s fine. Only his satellite\u2019s ceiling is here to see it.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do the same.\u201d\nThe next day, Simon catches the tail end of a transmission in a familiar voice, asking if the stars had any clever medical advice to share today.\n\u201cNo stars here,\u201d he says, as Lyric\u2019s voice jumps up in excitement.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Nova answers, like she breaks ankles and takes part in daring rescues every day. \u201cStars aren\u2019t nearly so generous with their skills.\u201d\nThe stars aren\u2019t exactly around to defend themselves, and they\u2019re basically Simon\u2019s neighbors, so he takes on that task himself.\nWith three people laughing at once, the satellite feels bigger than it ever has.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a gardener in a place you\u2019re not supposed to be able to garden,\u201d Nova summarizes, and Lyric makes a noise that somehow sounds like a nod, wordless but no less clear. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a sculptor whose first art piece was my arm, and I did go for form over function.\u201d\nSimon thinks that\u2019s a wild way to downplay the brilliance it must have taken, to design, build, and install her own arm. Especially since all of her materials come from the junkyard she\u2019s been squatting in for the better half of a year, ever since whatever happened to make her lose her arm had inspired her to drop out of school and run full tilt at being a starving artist type.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if graffiti was in three dimensions,\u201d she\u2019d said, trying to describe her work to the two of them. \u201cOr tattoos, if tattoos could turn against you . . . And if they were made out of your mom\u2019s old pocket kitchenette.\u201d\nSimon can\u2019t picture it, but he wants to. Wants to see Nova\u2019s sculptures just as much as he wants to wander through Lyric\u2019s gardens.\n\u201cQuite a pair,\u201d Simon says, and it is perhaps the wrong response, because he can feel Nova\u2019s attention turn to him, can hear her smile get wider.\n\u201cWhat about you then, Simon-my-boy?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou a walking contradiction like the rest of us?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t want to talk about what he does. He supposes it\u2019s not that far off of what the both of them do, finding beauty in the discarded pieces of other people\u2019s lives. But they both transform the scraps they find, into things new and stunning.\nHe just tidies up other people\u2019s good words and sends them on their way again.\nSo he deflects, focuses on the wrong part of the sentence.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not a boy.\u201d he says, nothing but cheer in the correction. \u201cI collect genders like you collect space junk.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good metaphor, he thinks, for all that he still can\u2019t quite picture her work. Pretty pieces of potential on a shelf, and some days they fit one way and some days another.\n\u201cI just use he/him out of convenience.\u201d\n\u201cWhose convenience?\u201d Nova asks, sharp as skeptics, and he feels his heart flutter at how quick she is to ready herself to defend him.\n\u201cMy own,\u201d he assures her. \u201cIt\u2019s for no one but myself. I like how it sounds, and it\u2019s the most accurate the most of the time.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t get into the rest of it, how in this tiny satellite of his, he could be anyone, could wake up a new person each day, and that terrifies him. How easy, to lose yourself in space. He needs constants, needs touchstones of identity to keep him company. His name, his pronouns, they are like magnets on a fridge, pins on a board. Keeping the less permanent parts of him steady, for a time.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Lyric comes in, ballast to Nova\u2019s sails. \u201cIf that changes, you\u2019ll let us know, right?\u201d\nWhat a delightful thought, that they\u2019d know each other long enough to update each other on things like shifting identities.\n\u201cI promise,\u201d he says, and the future is sweet on his tongue.\nDo you believe in fate, he almost asks, when Nova just so happens to call him on a night that is especially dark. She goes on about a piece of junk she\u2019s found, how it bends just like a waterfall, and he listens, lets her fire light up the room.\nDid you ever read fairy tales, he traces into his desk, not daring to ask out loud, on a morning where Lyric has enough words to walk them both through every flower they have growing. He hasn\u2019t managed to sleep, but their voice makes it easier.\nIf we\u2019d met differently, he practices out loud, on a day where both of them are busy, and he is alone. If I were closer, do you think . . . ?\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to end that sentence, so he saves it. An unsent transmission. A secret, just for him and all of space.\nIt\u2019s not like the universe cares, anyway.\nOnce he finds the perfect way to say it, he will, he tells himself, runs the sentences through every language he knows to see if one sounds better than the others.\nMaybe it\u2019s just a vocabulary issue again.\nHe\u2019ll leave it for now.\n\u201cA shift is five months?\u201d\nSimon shrugs, a gesture more out of habit than any added meaning. Nova\u2019s outrage on his behalf has quickly become a comfort, even if he still feels a twinge of guilt for bringing it out at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have to stay up the whole time, or anything. It\u2019s just easier on resources for us to stay up for extended periods of time. Sending a supply ship up to all of us, instead of us going down and up.\u201d He brightens. \u201cBut we get a month or two off between shifts, if we\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like.\u201d Lyric\u2019s not convinced. Neither is Nova, not even a little. She\u2019s known him barely two months, Lyric only a few more, and already they both see through him better than anyone at home ever managed. It\u2019s enough to make a satellite feel stripped bare. \u201cSo, if you wanted, you could stay up there even longer?\u201d\nNova\u2019s reading into his silence before he\u2019s even made up his mind whether or not to answer, cutting to the quick.\n\u201cHey, Simon? When was the last time you pulled your head out of the clouds?\u201d\nHe hesitates again. Not because he doesn\u2019t want to tell her, but because he needs to take a moment to count.\n\u201c . . . Fourteen months,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she hisses, and he grimaces.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not on purpose!\u201d he says, quick now, trying to cut off the lecture he knows he\u2019ll get otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s just, my hometown isn\u2019t exactly my favorite place, and my parents are really busy anyways, and they\u2019ll just ask why I had to run away to the stars to avoid going to university, and I can\u2019t be bothered to have that conversation with them again.\u201d\nHe should really give them a call. It\u2019s been almost a year.\nLater, he assures himself. He\u2019ll worry about it later.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to come down,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t really have anywhere I\u2019d want to land.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Lyric corrects him, and the confidence alone winds him, leaves him blinking away the stinging in his eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s changed, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt better have,\u201d Nova growls, and the growl makes him feel warm, hands to his cheeks so he can feel his own blush spread. \u201cI\u2019m working on something really neat, but it\u2019s gonna sound stupid as hell if I try to describe it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to go see it in person,\u201d Lyric says, and how can he say no to them both, when they so perfectly overlap like this?\nHe should say yes. He should say yes, thank you, I would love that.\nInstead, he starts to cry.\n\u201cSimon?\u201d chorus two voices belonging to faces he has never seen, and he aches with it.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he gets out, curling up on himself, tucked away in his chair. It\u2019s on wheels, so that he can move it to the other rooms when he needs to. There\u2019s only one chair, in this whole place. It was only made for one person, why would he need more than one?\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize,\u201d Nora says, almost stepping on him in her haste to get the words out.\n\u201cTalk to us,\u201d Lyric says. \u201cPlease, Simon.\u201d\nAnd he does.\n\u201cI think the whole world must be lonely.\u201d\nThe words ring in his ears.\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Lyric asks, and their voice is soft, the way one might speak at a funeral.\n\u201cThere are decades and decades of us sending letters to the stars. Not knowing if anyone would listen to them, desperate to connect, to have someone respond. Thousands of words, in as many languages as we\u2019ve got. Reaching out to the sky, again and again, hoping against hope that someone will reach back.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Nova starts, but it\u2019s Lyric\u2019s voice that comes through clear.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s loneliness,\u201d they say, that same whisper, threaded with a conviction like steel. \u201cYou said it yourself, Simon. That\u2019s hope.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a hum of agreement from the other line.\nLater, he\u2019ll wonder when they all started to pick up each other\u2019s speech patterns and verbal stims. But that\u2019s for later.\nLyric continues.\n\u201cThey reached out because they had hope that one day, their messages would find someone who was listening, hoping to hear something in the stars. It is in direct opposition of loneliness. How many of them use the word \u2018friend\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cA lot of them,\u201d he says, and they echo in his head. Greeting, friends. Friends of space. Welcome home. Before, they had always sounded like half-finished tragedies. But the words themselves don\u2019t really say that, did they?\n\u201cI can see how someone might hear them and hear them just as messages never answered, and there\u2019s something terribly lonely in that,\u201d they continue. \u201cBut I think these words came from a much brighter place than that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they did find someone,\u201d Nova comes in, and where Lyric is the wind, Nova is the river. \u201cThey found you, didn\u2019t they? You heard them.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Simon confirms, and he wonders what his choked-up words sound like, sent across a thousand miles.\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re the only person who ever hears them, they\u2019ll have done what they were meant to do. They found someone out there and let them know that they had friends here. That they weren\u2019t alone.\u201d\nSimon sits above the Earth in his little satellite, spinning through space at a pace he can largely not even comprehend, and he listens to two voices remind him that he is not alone, using the words he\u2019s repeated to himself like a prayer on the most empty of nights.\nThey take on a new life, on their tongues, and he is reminded of the first time he found these words, his first shift, his first night away from home. How precious the words felt, held in his hands like seeds he couldn\u2019t wait to plant, metal he couldn\u2019t wait to bend.\nWhen had they lost their shine? When had he stopped hearing the beauty in them, and instead interpreted them like a tragedy?\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s really sobbing now, but something\u2019s changed. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s because he\u2019s sad anymore.\nHe\u2019d been taught, somewhere between grade school and the great adventure of space, that if someone is crying the best thing you can do is support them without commenting on it. It\u2019s polite. It saves the person any embarrassment.\nBut he thinks that maybe the person who taught him that has never had two voices, different in every way, thousands of miles between them, say \u201coh, Simon,\u201d in perfect synchronicity, as his voice breaks over the call and they reach out with all that they have to comfort him.\nHe falls asleep to their quiet conversations, and he sleeps without dreaming.\nDo you think you can fall for two people at once? he asks the static.\nThere\u2019s no answer.\nHe takes the words and buries them inside of him.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do, if they decide to grow.\nThe universe is infinite. This he knows.\nBut the world is circular, and he knows this too, orbits around it every day.\nLife has infinite possibilities. That is what they say.\nBut it prefers to stick to patterns. To days and months and years, starting something the same place something else has ended. History repeats, little stories spin in circles, and transmissions loop.\nSomewhere on Earth, in a digital swamp no one would really make note of, it is storming.\nIn space, there is no rain to hammer on the roof of a little cabin, to offer warning. There is no putting down your feet to find out that the water is already up to your ankles, and the fear that comes with that flood, because the ground is soft here. Perfect for planting.\nNot perfect for escaping a mire that has snuck up on you in the night.\nSimon doesn\u2019t know any of these things, of course. For him, panic comes in the form of a staticky call for help, made crackling by the weather rather than by the age, and a voice he has grown to know so well, begging for help.\nHe\u2019s up in an instant, heart in his throat as he sprints to his workstation.\n\u201cLyric?\u201d he calls down the line. \u201cLyric, can you hear me?\u201d\nWith one hand, he is calling for Nova, because he needs her, because he can\u2019t do this alone.\nThe other is doing what he does best, hours and hours sitting right here\u2014cleaning up the message, so that every word is perfectly clear.\nNova joins him just in time to hear Lyric bite back a gasp.\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck,\u201d they cry, and there\u2019s sounds Simon isn\u2019t used to, the rushing of water and data, the sucking of solid ground suddenly turned to deep, deep mud.\n\u201cThought you were supposed to leave yesterday?\u201d Nova asks, and yes, yes, she\u2019s right. The bog\u2019s dangerous this time of year, Lyric was supposed to spend the next month or two in the city, waiting for the ground to get solid enough for planting again.\n\u201cThere was . . . things were still growing,\u201d Lyric confesses. \u201cI was going to go today, but I . . . \u201d\nLater. They can tell them off later. After they\u2019re somewhere safe and dry.\nBut it was them, who walked Simon and Nova through the last crisis. Their steady voice, their careful hands.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lyric says, and Simon thinks they\u2019ve said it a few times now. Panic is making it hard to catch each word. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I keep sinking, I\u2019m sorry . . . \u201d\n\u201cSimon,\u201d Nova hisses, and her claws cut through the fear. \u201cYou have to tell me where they are.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not something he\u2019s ever done. It\u2019s the most important rule, after all. His job is not about the people who send these messages, just like it\u2019s not about who receives them. He is not, under any circumstance, supposed to trace a transmission.\nBut this isn\u2019t a transmission, says the part of him that sounds more and more like Lyric. This is a call home.\nTo hell with the rules, growls a part of him that parrots Nova\u2019s bravery. Rules are only as good as the people they protect.\n\u201cI can try,\u201d he says, and already his hands are moving. He\u2019s never done this. But he knows this system, knows it better than he\u2019s known anything.\nHe can take it apart, split it open and follow them, the seeds and the scraps and the nuts and bolts. He can tune in to the words, and more importantly, to the voice that\u2019s saying them.\nHis instructors had told him that it didn\u2019t matter, the person behind the messages he heard. That they were all as good as ghosts, as far as they were concerned.\nThey were wrong. They were wrong about so much, and this most of all.\nFor the third time, Simon of Satellite Nirah-86 breaks the rules.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he promises Lyric, who\u2019s sunk to their waist now, who reached out into the stars and just so happened to find him.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got you,\u201d he promises Nova, as he sends her a coordinate, listens to her bike roar like something wild as she goes speeding off.\nHe hadn\u2019t looked before, but he\u2019s looking now. All these months, and the two of them had been less than fifty miles from each other.\nThe universe is so big, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Sometimes it shrinks to just this. Just three people, moving as one, to save a life.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d he repeats, on loop like one of his favorite messages, polished to shining. \u201cNova\u2019s almost there, you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Lyric assures him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed you, Simon.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t know what he says, in those painful, stretched minutes or hours or years between that first cry for help and the distant sound of Nova\u2019s voice through Lyric\u2019s line, calling their name. He must say lots of things, because he talks the whole time, so that Lyric can save their breath for surviving, and Nova for the race toward them. Bits of messages he\u2019d memorized before he\u2019d met them, sentences they\u2019d both said to him that stuck. Reworked, reshaped into something all its own, a monologue designed to reach down from the stars and pull Lyric up and out of that mud and into the arms of someone who loves them.\nHe talks until Nova gets close, and then he lends his shouts to Lyric\u2019s, as they call until Nova spots them.\nHe only stops talking when Lyric\u2019s line drops out, and it\u2019s through Nova\u2019s alone that he hears \u201cI\u2019ve got you, we\u2019ve got you, told you we\u2019d do it.\u201d\nAnd he cries along with them both, when they reach solid ground and he hears them both collapse with it, tangled in each other with his voice in between them, muffled by how tightly they\u2019re holding onto each other, but never intruding.\nThis call has three heartbeats, all racing with their close call, and it\u2019s to that pounding beat that one of them moves, and the other one responds, and Simon realizes that they\u2019re kissing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a force of nature, Ms. Nova,\u201d Lyric finally gets out, and Simon can hear their smile.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Nova replies, but she\u2019s smiling too.\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d Simon breathes. \u201cYou\u2019re together and you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re okay,\u201d Lyric repeats, and then the rain that\u2019s been the backing music to this all suddenly lets up, and Nova swears, and Lyric laughs, and as always, their laughter is contagious enough to catch.\nThey spend the first few minutes together laughing until the panic drains away like the storm.\nSimon\u2019s not sure if he believes in fate, or in rules, or in the patterns of the universe.\nBut he thinks he could be happy, just believing in this feeling. Whatever it happens to be.\nSimon tries to give them space. He does. A lot has happened, and near-death experiences have a way of taking a lot out of you. Not to mention kissing someone you\u2019d only just met. It\u2019s a lot. He\u2019s trying to be respectful.\nNeither of them will have it.\n\u201cLook, I miss you too,\u201d he admits, after Nova calls him five times in as many minutes, and he finally picks up. \u201cBut Lyric\u2019s recovering, and the two of you are getting settled, and . . . I mean, the two of you kissed. You\u2019re . . . shouldn\u2019t you talk about this? Before just inviting me to visit?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019d been here, I\u2019d have kissed you too, idiot.\u201d Nova says, and he\u2019s so stunned that he forgets, for a second, every language he knows.\n\u201cIt is something we should talk about,\u201d Lyric says, and there\u2019s still a thrill, to seeing both of their voices come through one transmission. \u201cBut conversations like this are best had in person. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nSo they\u2019re really serious. Simon hums, a thinking noise, and looks over at the screen that serves as calendar and countdown both.\n. . . His shift is up in three days.\nHow had he not noticed?\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never had a reason to look forward to it before,\u201d Nova says, responding to a question he must have asked out loud. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a workaholic.\u201d\n\u201cWe all are,\u201d Simon reminds her, and then makes a face. Might be a bit soon, when Lyric\u2019s work had so recently almost killed them.\nBut there\u2019s laughter on the other end, and he relaxes. Not too soon, then. Or maybe they\u2019ve all just been looking for an excuse to laugh in the face of what they had just survived.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lyric agrees. \u201cMaybe we all need a break.\u201d\n\u201c . . . I have some vacation saved up,\u201d Simon admits. Months and months of it, although he doesn\u2019t want to start with that. Doesn\u2019t want to move too fast. \u201cIf you\u2019re both sure. If you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cCome on down, Simon Satellite,\u201d Nova calls, singsong. \u201cCome be our summer fling.\u201d\nIf Simon is remembering right, it\u2019s not even midwinter where they are.\nIt\u2019s an invitation, then. A long one.\nIt\u2019s a place to land.\nSimon swallows, mouth gone dry with anxiety. No, not quite. With a terrifying, intoxicating anticipation.\n\u201cI can be there in three weeks,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHolding you to that, then.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d Lyric adds, and there they go again. Making promises of a future Simon is less and less scared to imagine.\nSimon still feels small, when he looks up at the sky.\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a clear night, in the bogs. There\u2019s always a slight blur to the air, millions of bytes of information drifting through their final resting place.\nIt makes the stars seem closer, somehow. Brighter.\nThe horizon still stretches out in every direction, but to Simon\u2019s left is a short someone with hair that curls tighter in the humidity, and the night looks so much smaller, when mirrored by their dark skin, freckles like their own constellations, ones Simon cannot wait to study.\nAnd to Simon\u2019s right is a taller girl, smile sharp and daring, and her arm interrupts any straight lines, as she points at the world and questions what everyone else has gone and accepted as truths, and her pale cheeks go red when Simon reaches out and captures her hand, tangling their fingers together and suggesting that maybe, they can find the answers together.\nThe numbers that make up the impossible expanse of space feel smaller, when viewed by three.\nMaybe they really do mean nothing, in the grand scheme of things.\nBut maybe that\u2019s not the point.\nThe universe doesn\u2019t know who he is, and that\u2019s fine. He\u2019s not really anyone\u2014just a satellite, just space junk held together by scribbled equations and an outdated sound system.\nBut he doesn\u2019t need to be someone important to the universe, to be someone to the two on either side of him.\nHe can just be Simon.\nTonight, he plants his name between his ribs. In the soft ground beneath their feet. In the metal sculptures that stand like sentinels around them.\nTomorrow, together, they will see what grows.\nZiggy Schutz (she/her/he/him) is a queer, disabled writer who is at all times looking for ways to make his favorite fairy tales and sci fi tropes reflect people who look a little more like her.\nWhen he\u2019s not writing, she\u2019s spending his time exploring haunted houses and chatting up the ghosts who live there.

Her fighter rattles with the fury of its final burn.\n Spaceflight is about orbits. That\u2019s how one thing relates to another, up here: I whirl around you. I try to pull away. You try to pull me in. If we don\u2019t smash each other apart, or skip away into the void, maybe we can negotiate something stable.\n But Laporte has learned that sometimes you just need to fall.\n Her instruments don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re military avionics, built to hunt and kill other warships (other people) in cold flat space. Thus Laporte flies her final mission in a screaming constellation of errors, cautions, icy out-of-range warnings. An array of winter-colored protests from a machine that doesn\u2019t know where it is or why it\u2019s about to die.\n She wants to pat the ship (a lovely, lethal, hard-worn Uriel gunship, built under Martian skies, the skies of her lover\u2019s childhood) on its nose and say: there, there, I know exactly how you feel. I\u2019m with you, man. This shit is beyond me.\n But it\u2019s not beyond her. She knows why she\u2019s here.\n Laporte never thought she\u2019d be a good soldier. Certainly she\u2019d never planned to be an exceptional killer. Or a mutineer leading a revanchist fleet up out of Earth\u2019s surrender and into a crusade across the length of human space. Or, in her final act as a human being (if she dares make claim to that title any more), the avatar of an omnicidal alien power with no intelligence, no awareness, and a billion-year-old cosmic imperative to destroy all higher thought.\n But she is all those things now. Born from the tragedy of a war as unnecessary as it was inevitable. Shaped by combat and command and (between it all, pulling in the opposite direction) the love of the finest woman she\u2019s ever met.\n After all that, after Simms and NAGARI and That Revelation Ken, she knows why she\u2019s here. She knows what force plucked her out of paradise and fired her down the trajectory of her short, violent life. To this distant terminus where the universe folds up behind her into a ring of light, everything she loves, everyone she\u2019s hurt, receding.\n She knows what she\u2019s come to kill. The object of her last assassination.\n \u201cBoss, this is Morrigan,\u201d she tells her flight recorder. \u201cI am descending towards the target.\u201d\n That\u2019s what she calls Simms, even now. Not \u2018love\u2019. Boss.\n There are three stories here, although they are all one:\n What happened in Capella, at the end.\n What happened with NAGARI, at the beginning.\n What happened between Noemi Laporte and Lorna Simms, which is the most important story, and the one that binds the others.\n It begins with the war, and with Lorna Simms\u2014\n simms 1/9\n For a long time, long enough to murder tens of thousands of people, Laporte thought Simms was dead.\n They fought for the United Earth Federation in the war against the colonist Alliance. Laporte and Simms were Federation combat pilots (SQUADRON VFX-01 2FM/FG2101 INDUS\u2014The Wargods, Captain Lorna Simms Commanding) and they were good, so good, they fought like two fists on a drunken boxer, moved by instinct and kill-joy. Of course, a boxer has a body as well as a pair of fists\u2014but they tried not to consider the shape of what connected them.\n It wasn\u2019t love or lust alone (they were soldiers and their discipline held), nor was it only respect, or fear, or sly admiration. Something of all of this. Whatever connected them, it helped them fight. Simms the Captain, leader of killers, and Laporte her faithful wingman, who was the finest killer.\n And they fought to save their Federation, their happy humanist utopia, Earth and Mars and the Jupiter moons\u2014a community of people making each other better. They fought hard.\n The war is a civil war. As intimate and violent and hard to name as the bond between Laporte and Simms. An apocalyptic exchange of fratricides between the Federation and its own far-flung interstellar colonists: the Alliance.\n For a little while, long enough to give them hope, Laporte and Simms and their Wargods almost won the war.\n Then the Alliance clockmaker-admiral, the cryogenic bastard Steele, set a trap. It caught Simms, Laporte, and their whole squadron. Everyone died. It was like a lesson: no band of heroes will save you. No soldiers bound by law and decency.\n Out of that ambush Simms and Laporte flew each other to refuge, but it was not refuge enough, the war was in their bones and flesh now: Simms was dying, poisoned by radiation. So they sat together on a crippled warship and they talked about anything but each other.\n Remember that? After the ambush at Saturn? Remember adjusting Simms\u2019 blankets and pressing your cheek to her throat? Hoping she\u2019d live long enough for both of you to die together, as you\u2019d always dreamed?\n (Laporte\u2019s dreams are not, it turns out, wholly her own.)\n The Alliance was winning, they agreed. Neither of them could see a way to avoid defeat. Neither of them would admit that to the other\u2014not defeat, nor the other thing between them.\n Simms passed out. Laporte stayed by her side.\n And then a rescue ship came, and with it came al-Alimah, the woman with the gunmetal eyes and the shark-sleek uniform of a Federation black ops officer. She came to tempt Laporte away from Simms with the promise of her other love\u2014\n Victory. Al-Alimah came to offer Laporte a chance at victory. And she named the agents of that victory NAGARI.\n nagari 1/10\n What is victory? Only a fool goes to war without an answer.\n The Alliance is winning (has won). What is their victory condition? Their grievance? The fatal casus belli that sparked it all?\n The Federation is a gentle state, built on Ubuntu, a philosophy of human connection. So they say: the war began because the Alliance couldn\u2019t stand to be alone. They spent two decades rebuilding the severed wormhole to Earth, so they could demand reunification, so they could mobilize our thriving economy to build their warships. So they could galvanize our culture for war.\n What the Alliance asked the Federation is what the woman named al-Alimah asked Laporte, as they stood together over the radiation-cooked body of Lorna Simms: give up your gentle ties. Come with me, towards victory. Become a necessary monster.\n When the Federation refused to militarize, the Alliance invaded. It was their only hope.\n Either they gained the Federation\u2019s riches, or they faced the Nemesis alone.\n Laporte, she made the other choice, the one her beautiful home could not. She went with al-Alimah. She joined the phantom atrocity-makers called NAGARI and she discovered her own final hope, her endgame for Federation victory.\n It\u2019ll require the extermination of the entire Alliance population. So be it. She is an exceptional killer. She proved that after she left Simms.\n That\u2019s how she ended up here, at this raging dead star on the edge of Alliance space, this monument to the power of the alien Nemesis. The tomb of Capella\u2014\n capella 2/8\n Back in the now: and someone\u2019s chasing her.\n She sniffs him out by the light of his engines. Something\u2019s come through the wormhole behind her and started its own plunge towards the (terrible, empty, fire-crowned) black hole.\n Laporte grins and knocks her helmet twice against her ejection seat, crash crash, polymer applause for the mad gentleman on her trail. She knows who it is. She\u2019s glad he\u2019s come.\n She tumbles the Uriel end-for-end so that she\u2019s falling ass-first into oblivion and her nose is aimed back, up, towards the universe. There\u2019s a ring of night and bent starlight all around her, where the black hole\u2019s gravity bends space, but up above, as if at the top of a well, are the receding stars.\n And there he is. A fierce blue light which resolves into the molybdenum greatsword-shape of an Alliance strike carrier. Atreus. Steele\u2019s flagship. Two and a half kilometers of tactical divinity.\n Admiral Onyekachi Tuwile Steele prosecuted the war in the Sol theater. A game of remorseless speed chess with fifteen billion pawns in play. In the end, after the Federation exhausted all its gambits and defenses (save one, the one called NAGARI), he won the war.\n He\u2019s a perfectionist, Steele. A man of etiquette and fine dress, a man who moves like a viper or a Kinshasa runway model. He makes intricate, clockwork plans, predicated on perfect understanding of his opponent\u2019s behavior. He cannot abide error.\n He made only one.\n Nowhere in the final hours of the war, the Mars gambit, the desperate defense and ultimate failure of SHAMBHALA, did he send enough hunter-killers to eradicate Laporte.\n And now he has come a-howling after her, propelled by portents and terrors, operating on a desperate, improvised logic. That logic might be: if she wants it, I cannot permit it. If Laporte reaches for a thing, I must deny it to her. She is too dangerous to ever have a victory.\n It might be something else. It\u2019s dangerous to let your enemy understand your war logic.\n simms 2/9\n There are three stories here. They all matter.\n One is the story of Laporte at Capella, trying to kill billions. That\u2019s the ending.\n One is the story of Laporte leaving Simms for NAGARI, in the name of victory. That\u2019s the beginning.\n But in between them is another story, because the road from victory to genocide passes through love. In this middle part, the Federation\u2019s civilian government surrendered to the Alliance. And here in the ashes Laporte found Simms alive, Simms found Laporte still (barely) human, they each found the other in the cold scorched wolfpack of the Federation Navy, lurking on the edge of the solar system and contemplating mutiny.\n This story is the most important, because it was Laporte\u2019s last chance to be a person again.\n So: Laporte reaches for Simms. She wants to be close again. She wants to come back.\n They\u2019re lying side by side in the avionics bay of Laporte\u2019s fighter: an alloy coffin as cold as treason. Mostly empty. The terms of the cease-fire have stripped all military electronics from the Federation Navy.\n Like their uniforms\u2014taken too. They work in gym clothes and mechanic\u2019s overalls. Whenever they breathe the vapor spills out white like a suitbreach. Every ten minutes a dehumidifier clicks on.\n Simms shivers. Her hands rattle and she breaks the test pin she\u2019s using against the teeth of a server stack. \u201cShit,\u201d she says, closing her eyes. \u201cFuck.\u201d\n She survived radiation poisoning. But surviving a wound doesn\u2019t erase it. You only rebuild yourself around the scar.\n Laporte knifes the RESET switch up, down, up, down. They\u2019ll start over. \u201cSlowing me down, boss,\u201d she says, trying to take Simms\u2019 fear and judo it around, make it funny, disarm its violence. \u201cSlowing me down.\u201d\n \u201cFuck you too.\u201d Simms clenches and unclenches her fists, one finger at a time. She\u2019s longer than Laporte, and stronger. Before she soaked up fifteen grays of ionizing radiation, she could always keep up. \u201cYou try fingerbanging a combat spacecraft after a lethal dose.\u201d\n Laporte makes a wah-wah baby noise. Simms laughs. They work for a few more minutes and soon they\u2019ve made the fighter ready to hold combat software in the spare memory of its navigational systems.\n If they\u2019re going to mutiny, the mutiny needs its fighters. And Laporte is planning a mutiny.\n Simms puts down the test pin and shivers from her scalp to her toes. She looks silver-gold, arid. She is the child of Mongolian steppe and American range and the desert of Mars. She\u2019s used to cold. Laporte\u2019s afraid that it\u2019s not the cold making her shiver. Simms has been listening, the last few days, as Laporte lifts up her scabs and talks about NAGARI, and about her plan for victory.\n \u201cThey took out all my bone marrow,\u201d Simms says. \u201cI\u2019m full of fake bone shit. Medical goo.\u201d\n Laporte rolls into her (the old words, in a pilot\u2019s brevity code: Boss, Morrigan, tally, visual, press, It\u2019s you, I\u2019m me, I see you, I will protect you) and Simms puts an arm around her. Laporte kisses her under the jaw, very softly, and rests her ear against Simms\u2019 collarbone. There\u2019s a plastic button rubbing into her cheek but she doesn\u2019t mind.\n \u201cSeems to work okay,\u201d she says. She looked up radiation therapies: desperate transplant of reprogrammed skin cells and collagen glue. She imagined them peeling the skin off Simms\u2019 thighs to fill up her bones.\n \u201cYeah.\u201d Simms\u2019 heart is slowing down, soothing out. It can\u2019t find the fight it\u2019s looking for. Or it\u2019s disciplining itself for what\u2019s to come. \u201cI still work.\u201d\n Laporte looks up from her collarbone to look her in the eye. \u201cAre you going to fly with me?\u201d\n Will she fly in the mutiny. Laporte\u2019s grand plan, NAGARI\u2019s final hope? The Federation has surrendered, but its soldiers, its guardian monsters, do not consent to Alliance rule. They were made to win.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Simms says, looking at her hands. Whatever she says next will be an evasion. \u201cI need to know more about your operational plan.\u201d\n I need to know more about what you\u2019ve become. What you got up to without me, while I was in the tank with my skin peeling off and glue in my blood.\n \u201cI need you out there,\u201d Laporte says. She means it to be business, pilot chatter, a tactical requirement. But she\u2019s thinking about how she left Simms. How it might have seemed, to Simms, that she had been expended. Cast off as spent ordnance.\n Simms makes a soft sound, like she\u2019s too tough or too happy to cry.\n The dehumidifier wakes up to dry out their words.\n capella 3/8\n The mutiny is what carried Laporte from the middle to the end.\n The Alliance killed the Federation\u2019s best soldiers. It battered the Federation into political surrender. But it never beat NAGARI. It never beat Laporte.\n When the peace negotiations began, Laporte flew her re-armed Uriel from post to distant post, rallying the Federation\u2019s dying strength for the death ride to Capella. Dozens of ships. Hundreds of pilots. Answering to Noemi \u2018Morrigan\u2019 Laporte, the last ace, the one who wouldn\u2019t let the fire go out.\n Laporte airbrushed the suggestion of a raven on her fighter. Its claws are bloody. There is armor in its jaw.\n She asked Simms to ride in her back seat as she went to raise mutiny. \u201cA couple undead soldiers, flying the mutiny flag,\u201d she joked. \u201cLike a buddy cop thing.\u201d But Simms looked away and Laporte thought, what am I doing, how can I ask her to light this war back up, to be the spark that escalates it from atrocity to apocalypse? The war took her skin and melted the inside of her bones. It ripped out the lining of her guts. She can\u2019t even shit without fighting the war.\n \u201cI\u2019m not mission capable yet,\u201d Simms said, and she looked at Laporte as if the war had taken one more vital thing from her. \u201cI hope the avionics work. I broke a lot of test pins in there.\u201d\n So Laporte flew with al-Alimah instead. Al-Alimah from NAGARI.\n The Federation government surrendered but its fleet did not. They struck during treaty negotiations. Laporte\u2019s rebel armada fought its way out of Sol by shock and treachery. Breached the blockades in Serpentis. Menaced the Alliance capital in Beta Aquilae.\n And as they did, Laporte\u2019s NAGARI elite slipped into Vega. One wormhole away from their true goal.\n Capella.\n Admiral Steele\u2019s been chasing Laporte the whole way. Trying to repair his only error. And here they are now, in Capella, at the end of the hunt\u2014Laporte plunging towards the black hole in her little Uriel and Steele\u2019s titanic Atreus plunging after her.\n The Uriel\u2019s electronic warfare systems make a deep frightened sound. Laporte\u2019s helmet taps her chin and says:\n VAMPIRE! ASPECT! STINGRAY! SSM-[EOS]-[notch 000x000]-[20+!]\n It\u2019ll be missiles, then. A fuck-ton of missiles.\n If he turned around now, with all Atreus\u2019 fuel still coiled up in her engines, Steele could probably stop his fall. Claw his way into a hover above the black hole, and then make the grueling climb up to the wormhole and safety.\n But he\u2019s accelerating. Chasing Laporte. Risking himself and his entire crew to kill her.\n Laporte opens a COM channel. Aims it downward. Into the dark. She has allies here, if they can be made to understand the danger.\n \u201cKen,\u201d she sends. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Don\u2019t keep me waiting, old man.\u201d\n That\u2019s why she\u2019s come here, to the singularity, to the tomb of Capella. Because the Nemesis made it.\n Just as they made her.\n nagari 2/10\n Ken is a dream of Laporte\u2019s. Laporte\u2019s dreams are not entirely her own.\n Ken happened long before the Alliance rebuilt the wormhole, long before the war\u2014\n She was six years old, playing in the yard. Her parents had a house in Tandale, part of Dar es Salaam, where they worked on heavy trains, moving cargo from the Indian Ocean all across Tanzania. Her father was a reserve pilot and her mother was in arbitrage. Little Noemi, left to self-directed education, as was the Ubuntu preference for the young, spent her days building a model train system in the dirt between her water garden and her ant battle arena. But the ants would not stay in the ant battle arena, not even a little\u2014they kept foraying into the train system, no matter how many of them Noemi punitively de-limbed.\n Ken suggested she consider the broader logic driving the ants. Ken often gave Noemi advice. Her parents were very proud that little Noemi had actualized such a useful inner friend.\n After an exhaustive survey of her territories, Noemi discovered the problem. There was a rival ant colony north of the water garden. The two groups had fallen to war. She studied up on ant diplomacy, complaining into her phone, and concluded there was no pluralist solution. The colonies would compete for hegemony over all available resources. Unless one side achieved a swift victory, lives and labor would be lost on the war. An attritional stalemate could ruin them both.\n She uncurled the garden hose and drowned the northern colony. The choice was simple, in that it was easy. It only depended on one thing. She knew and loved the ants in the south of the yard. She cared nothing for the ants in the north. There was no other distinction between them.\n When you are a monster, as Laporte certainly is, you have to cling to the things that you love. The ligatures that connect you to the rest of humanity.\n If you lose them, you may whirl away.\n simms 3/9\n Laporte didn\u2019t understand the Ken dream until she joined NAGARI. That\u2019s the beginning.\n What the Alliance asked the Federation is what the woman named al-Alimah asked Laporte. She was a tall woman with gunmetal implants in place of her eyes. She gave Laporte a choice: stay with Simms as she fights the radiation poisoning, or come with me and try to win the war.\n \u201cThe medics are coming,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can stay with your Captain until she dies, or until she doesn\u2019t. You\u2019ll make no difference. None of your talents or capabilities will contribute to her battle.\u201d\n (Laporte is a wingman and she never leaves her wing leader\u2014)\n \u201cOr you can come with me. I\u2019m with a black ops unit. Special moral environment. NAGARI. You know we\u2019re losing this war. You know we need you.\u201d\n (\u2014except when necessary to complete the mission.)\n And Laporte thought, if she lives, if she wakes up, I want to be able to say\u2014\n Hey, boss. We\u2019ve won. I took care of everything for you. Did you have a good vacation?\n So Laporte took al-Alimah by her tactical gloves and went with her, out of the sweltering briefing room, out of the dying ship where everyone\u2019s sweat was hot enough to leave red radiation burns, where their marrow rotted inside their neutron-salted bones.\n And that was how she joined NAGARI.\n nagari 3/10\n NAGARI. A committee of monsters: a federation of sharks. Shaved-skull operators cooking lamb on the naked coils of their frigate\u2019s heatsinks. All veterans. Not one in uniform.\n There are real psychological differences between Federation and Alliance citizens. Fifty years of sealed prosperity in Sol gave birth to a generation of humans who are very good at living but very bad at killing.\n That\u2019s why the Federation, for all its socioeconomic might, is losing the war. (That\u2019s why Laporte thinks the Alliance chose war over peace. They could never win the peace. And they were built for victory.)\n But Laporte isn\u2019t a good Federation citizen, no oh, that\u2019s what Simms told her in their radiation-cooked parley: you\u2019re a killer, you need no reason and no hate. It\u2019s just you. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ll be fine without me.\n And Simms was right. Laporte has an instinct for violence. And there are others like her, gathered under the mantle of Federation black ops, where the terrain of their violence extends far beyond the battlefield.\n \u201cThis is your first mission.\u201d Al-Alimah briefs her in the back of the mess kitchen as they inventory the remainders. Cumin and cinnamon and allspice blown down over them, but the stink of ozone is stronger. Al-Alimah\u2019s eyes are sensors and projectors: they sketch visions for Laporte by scratching her eyes with particle beams. \u201cYou will infiltrate an Alliance personnel convoy carrying non-combatant contractors. Dental and culinary services for rear-area bases.\u201d\n When Laporte blinks, the images left by al-Alimah\u2019s eyes don\u2019t fade.\n \u201cYou will deploy a neutron weapon against the dormitory ships. Leave no survivors.\u201d\n Laporte imagines Simms asking: what is the military rationale for this strike, sir? She vows to ask, after the mission. She vows to get good data on the mission effects. She used to keep a kill tally, one strike for each fighter she shot down, one chance to preen and brag for Boss.\n She sleeps with a cable in her skull, and she dreams about the strike over and over. When she flies it, it feels like a dream too. The neutron weapon makes no light or sound except the shrieking RAD warnings in her cockpit. She comes home to backslaps and fistbumps and moonshine from the still.\n \u201cThe objective is atrocity,\u201d al-Alimah tells her, when she asks. The NAGARI analyst wears a baggy gray jumpsuit, indifferent to rank and physical presence. \u201cThe Alliance uses statistical modeling to predict our tactics. They\u2019ve learned that we obey a set of moral guidelines. The only way to confound their predictions is to introduce noise.\u201d\n Noise. Killing all those dentists with radiation was noise.\n When Simms was irradiated she was very quiet.\n Laporte stops spicing her food. She dresses in stark self-washing jumpsuits and she showers cold. The other operators are happy monsters, full of gossip and tall tales, not shy about talking shop or sex. Laporte touches no one. She doesn\u2019t talk about her missions. In the gym and the simulator she is laconic and dependable but she never asks for anything. She practices self-denial.\n One of the other operators, Europa-born and silver-haired, comes after Laporte for reasons either carnal or tactical. The closest she gets to intimacy, of one sort or another, is when she says: \u201cYou act like you\u2019re a monk! Monks give up stuff they like, man. Monks deny their pleasures.\u201d\n That\u2019s right. Monsters shouldn\u2019t be warm. They shouldn\u2019t have fun. Being a monster should feel like it costs.\n But the silver woman grins at Laporte, an I-know-you grin, and says, \u201cSo when you pretend you hate the work\u2014I know what that means. I know what\u2019s up.\u201d\n Laporte flies noise jobs for months. False flags. Political assassinations. Bycatch enhancement. Straight-up terrorism. She has to round her kill tally to the nearest thousand. She has one of her teeth replaced by an armored transponder, so that someone will know she dies even if her body\u2019s vaporized.\n Simms would not be proud. Simms fought a war against an invading army, and she hated the fuck out of them. But she had rules. NAGARI is anti-rule. Strategically amoral.\n Is this her whole purpose now? Trying to buy the Federation a few extra months through the exercise of atrocity? Missions that violate every tenet of Ubuntu and civilized conflict?\n It\u2019s war, Simms once said. In war, monsters win. Laporte gathers up that thought and buckles it around herself, for want of Simms, for want of victory.\n Is she fighting because victory might mean seeing Simms again? Imagine that. Imagine saying: Hey, boss, you\u2019re alive. I neutron bombed a few thousand dentists, and we won the war. Can I buy you a drink?\n simms 4/9\n Back in the middle. In the story that moves Laporte from NAGARI to the black hole. Her last chance to stay human.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Laporte tells Simms.\n They\u2019ve finished re-arming all the fighters, breaking the ceasefire lock. This is the lean time between the surrender and the mutiny, when the Federation\u2019s surviving fleet lurks in the cold on the edge of the solar system, a faithful dog cast out and gone feral. Waiting for Laporte and NAGARI to rouse them to revenge.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s not true?\u201d Simms asks. She pokes the fire with her cooking mitt.\n They have a trash fire going on the Eris\u2019 hangar deck. Warships are very good at coping with internal fires, and very bad at serving as long-term habitats. They grew some chicken in the medical tissue loom and now they\u2019re burning trash under a plate of thermal conductor, in the hope of making a chicken curry.\n \u201cThat monsters win,\u201d Laporte says. The chicken pops and spatters grease. Simms laughs and Laporte, thinking of dead cells sloughing apart under radiation, shudders. Her transponder tooth, left over from NAGARI work, is cold under her tongue. \u201cIn the end, actually, monsters tend to lose. And that\u2019s much worse.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Simms eyes her up. Simms is still exploring Laporte\u2019s new crazy side, separate (in her practical mind) from Laporte\u2019s old crazy side, before their long radiation-cooked severance. \u201cIs this something from your NAGARI drug trips? Cosmic insight, plucked from the void?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d Laporte says, remembering the surgical theater, the feeling of cold entheogen slurry pumping into her skull. Where they discovered the truth about Ken. \u201cI wish you\u2019d been there.\u201d\n \u201cBut I was there,\u201d Simms says, stirring the fire. The thermal conductor is a cheerful cherry-hot color, and Simms hums as she works, like she\u2019s trying to be casual about how much she cares for this idea: the possibility that she was out there, helping Laporte win, even while she was bolted to a triage rig with her bones melting out through needled tubes. \u201cI was in your thoughts. Wasn\u2019t I? Isn\u2019t that what kept you alive?\u201d\n Why would she be so happy about this, about helping Laporte be a good monster, and then, just a day later, refuse to fly with Laporte in the mutiny?\n Why?\n nagari 4/10\n This is what Laporte was up to while Simms\u2019 bones were melting:\n Laporte flies her terror missions. She goes out alone and she returns alone, and between those stanchions she kills her targets. Her effect on the universe, the vector sum of her actions, is purely subtractive.\n She isn\u2019t fine without Simms. Simms was her captain and her friend, the last tie keeping Laporte in the human orbit. But that\u2019s the point, right? Laporte\u2019s a monster now. Her past is useful to her only in the way that gunpowder is useful to a bullet. The more pain in it, the better.\n The war\u2019s falling apart, slouching towards surrender. NAGARI scores victory after horrible victory. But the Federation Navy can\u2019t follow their lead. The clockmaker-Admiral Steele outfoxes the Navy again and again, closing in on Earth.\n Laporte becomes a kind of leader among the operators, on strength of her efficiency, in admiration of her self-sufficiency. She learns the name of every NAGARI operator, their habits and crimes, their gym schedules (hey man, spot me) and cooking tricks (come on, not this curry shit again). She also learns the callsigns of every active pilot: physiological parameters, operational histories.\n But she can\u2019t connect the two, the names and the callsigns. When a callsign dies on a mission, she isn\u2019t sure who it was until she misses their grunt in the gym, their recipes on the heatsink grill.\n The Federation is still losing the war. Her intention is to keep flying until she dies.\n But the memory of Simms (and the memory of what she said: you\u2019ll be fine, you don\u2019t need a reason) drives her mad with competition. She had a competition with Simms! She always wants to be better than her Captain expects.\n So when she wakes up from a training dream she goes to al-Alimah and asks: \u201cWhy are we doing this? What\u2019s the point of noise jobs and neutron bombs, if it\u2019s just a way to put off the inevitable surrender?\u201d\n She expects the answer she\u2019s given herself: Monsters are weapons. It\u2019s not up to the weapon to choose targets.\n But al-Alimah startles her. As if she is a ghost alive in the memory of childhood Tandale summers, al-Alimah says: \u201cTell me about Ken.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Laporte stares her down, eye to gleaming post-surgery tactical eye. \u201cWhy do you care about that?\u201d\n \u201cYou told your Captain Simms that you had an invisible friend as a child. He urged you to develop your faculty for violence.\u201d\n Laporte laughs. It doesn\u2019t surprise her that NAGARI knows this shit, but it\u2019s hilarious that they care. \u201cAnts, man. He wanted violence against ants. Ken was an imaginary friend.\u201d\n Al-Alimah doesn\u2019t waver. \u201cDuring your adolescence, you were treated for schizotypal symptoms. You reported violent ideation, dissociative thoughts, and a fear of outside intrusion. Your first boyfriend left you because he was afraid of you.\u201d\n Laporte opens her arms in a gesture of animal challenge. \u201cAre you worried,\u201d she says, grinning, \u201cthat I might be unwell?\u201d\n Al-Alimah laughs. She can pretend to be very warm, when she wants, although it\u2019s terrifyingly focused. Like all her charm radiates from a naked wire charged red-hot.\n \u201cWhat would Ubuntu have had you do to the ants?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat would our Federation\u2019s philosophy say to two ant colonies at war?\u201d\n Find a pluralistic solution. Locate the structural causes of inter-colony violence. Rework the terrain, so that peaceful competition between colonies can produce a common good.\n \u201cUbuntu is for people,\u201d Laporte says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work on ants.\u201d\n Al-Alimah touches Laporte\u2019s wrist with one long, cold finger. \u201cThink about the universe,\u201d she says, \u201cand what portions of it belong to people. If Ubuntu applies to the human territory, what is NAGARI for?\u201d\n \u201cOh my God,\u201d Laporte says.\n She understands instantly. She grasps the higher purpose of NAGARI.\n She has a terrible, wonderful, world-burning premonition. A way to win the war.\n nagari 5/10\n Ask the Alliance, Steele\u2019s people, the aggressors and the victors in this terrible war: what is the grievance? The fatal casus belli?\n Imagine a republic charged and corroded by perpetual emergency. Scattered across lonely stars. Simmering on the edge of rebellion. They may be tyrants. May also be the bravest and the most tenacious people ever born.\n This is what Laporte knows, what NAGARI knows, about their history\u2014\n Humanity met something out there. Implacably hostile. Unspeakably alien. Nemesis.\n Love is about knowing the rules of your connection. You know how you could hurt her, if you wanted, and she trusts you with this knowledge. And war is about that too. You learn the enemy\u2019s victory conditions, her capabilities and taboos. You build a model of her and figure out where it breaks. You force the enemy into unsurvivable terrain, pinned between an unwinnable war and unacceptable compromise.\n But what do you do when the rules you use to understand how one thing relates to another stop working? When the other thing has no rules at all?\n simms 5/9\n Rules about Simms, from the time before radiation and ambush:\n The Federation military forbids fraternization in the ranks. While Ubuntu treasures community, emotional attachment can compromise the chain of command.\n So at first the fire between them, the charge in the air, bled off in confined ways\u2014\n Laporte tried not to look at Simms too much, or too little, so nobody would notice her unusual attention. This is like war logic. When you look for the enemy with your active sensors, you also tell the enemy where you are and what you intend.\n When they checked each others\u2019 suits they were extremely professional. Soon they realized this was an error, since soldiers are profoundly obscene. But it was too late to start making catheter jokes.\n Sometimes they sparred in the gym. Simms was icy and Laporte grinned too much. The whole squadron turned out to cheer. (They\u2019re all dead now.)\n A new rule, after NAGARI and the Federation\u2019s surrender, after al-Alimah puts them back together. A rule they teach other\u2014\n You must never hint at your secret fear. The terrible thought that it might have been better if you\u2019d never found each other again.\n nagari 6/10\n Al-Alimah shares the history of humanity and the Nemesis, the history that Laporte knows from school\u2014and the secret parts NAGARI has collated.\n There were two Nemesis incursions.\n The first war, the war that divided mankind into Federation and Alliance, began like a nightmare and ended like an amputation. The Nemesis surfaced from the wormhole web and moved across human space erratic and arbitrarily violent. Humanity scored tactical victories (tactical victory is the tequila of combat highs: hot in the moment, hateful in the aftermath) but in the end the Nemesis world-killer called Sinadhuja made it all the way to Serpentis.\n One step from Earth.\n When Sinadhuja entered the wormhole to Sol, the Earth fleet resorted to their last hope. A firewall bomb. It cauterized the wormhole connection. Killed Sinadhuja, saved the hearth of the human species, and left the rest of mankind out there in the dark.\n That\u2019s how the Federation and the Alliance became separate things\u2014sometimes that\u2019s how you define yourself, in the space when you are separated, when you have abandoned all hope of reunion.\n One night, waiting for al-Alimah to appear and task her with another massacre, clawing up gibbets of her gel mattress and then smoothing them back so they vanish into the whole, Laporte realizes that she knows Simms is dead. She has to be. It\u2019s naive to think she survived the radiation. Naive to imagine an end to the war, a happy reunion, a quiet retreat where they can tend to each other\u2019s wounds. Simms is dead.\n It would be worse if she were alive. She would hate the monster Laporte, and she would hate herself for leaving Laporte to the monsters. Simms is a hell of a soldier, a superb pilot. That\u2019s how she defines herself. A good pilot never leaves her wingman.\n What do you call this? The decision to know something not because it is true, but because it\u2019s useful?\n Out there alone the Alliance survived. Thirty-two years they prepared for the Nemesis to strike a second time. Certain that victory would secure the future of mankind in the cosmos. Certain that defeat would mean extinction.\n capella 4/8\n She falls engine-first towards the black hole and Atreus falls after her with its torch aflame and missiles ramifying out into the space between them in search of the kill geometry, the way to confine her, the solution to Laporte.\n Steele\u2019s ship outguns her by orders of magnitude. The Alliance fought Nemesis twice. They learned war-craft the Federation has never matched.\n Atreus\u2019 missiles can make their own jumps. Leap from their first burn straight to Laporte across a stitch of folded space. But the singularity they\u2019re all falling for warps space, which makes it hard to jump. So the missiles come at her drunk and corkscrewing or they die in the jump and shear themselves open like fireflies burning too hot.\n Not all of them, though. Not all of them. A few make it into terminal attack.\n Laporte talks to Simms under her breath. Reporting the situation. Boss, Morrigan, am spiked, stingray stingray, vampires inbound. Music on. Defending now.\n She rolls her shoulders and arms her coilguns and starts killing the things come to kill her.\n And down there, down beneath her, in the groaning maelstrom where space-time frays and shears and starts to fall, where the course of events balances on the edge of inevitable convergence towards a central point, something wakes.\n The light of a stardrive, peeling free of the fire. The huge dark mass of something mighty. Molting out of the black hole\u2019s accretion disc. Climbing up to meet her.\n Ken says, in a voice as young as summer gardens, as old as ants:\n Hello, Miss Laporte.\n nagari 7/10\n \u201cThe Alliance started the second Nemesis incursion,\u201d al-Alimah says.\n They\u2019re having dinner together. Laporte\u2019s sure this is a dream, but because she sleeps with her nervous system braided into NAGARI\u2019s communal dreamscape, it\u2019s probably also real.\n Al-Alimah wants to talk about Ken.\n Laporte picks up her fork and eats. They\u2019re in a rooftop cafe and there\u2019s a warm wet wind, storm wind, coming from the north and west. The meal is salmon sous-vide cut into translucent panes of flesh. Like the pages of a carnage book.\n When she touches the salmon with her fork it curls up around the tines. \u201cThe Alliance attacked the Nemesis?\u201d\n \u201cThere was an insurrection.\u201d Al-Alimah\u2019s a long woman, breakable-looking, tall like Simms but not trained to bear her own weight under acceleration. In dreamland she\u2019s traded her gray uniform for a rail-slim black gown. She looks like a flechette. A projectile. \u201cSomeone broke ranks.\u201d\n After the first incursion, Nemesis behavior was the province of military intelligence. By political necessity, or perhaps out of some sense of Lovecraftian self-preservation, the Alliance tried to keep the pieces of the puzzle widely separated. But one of their Admirals, Haywain van Aken, finally unified the clues into a grand theory.\n \u201cWhat was it?\u201d Laporte interrupts. The tines of her fork are hypodermic-sharp but she doesn\u2019t notice until she\u2019s already pierced herself, three points of blood on her lips, inside her cheek.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Al-Alimah shrugs with her hands. The tendons in her wrists are as fine as piano wire. \u201cNot yet. But we know what he did.\u201d\n Van Aken became convinced he could communicate with the Nemesis. He built a signaling system\u2014almost a weapon, a cousin of the Alliance\u2019s missiles: it jumped high-energy particles directly into the mass of the target. Then he went rogue. Hurtling off past the Capella colony and into unexplored space. Possessed by a messianic conviction that he could find the Nemesis and end the war.\n Laporte cracks her neck and leans back. Watches Alliance warships moving through the clouds around them, pursuing van Aken into Nemesis territory, overcoming disorganized Nemesis resistance with determination and skill. On the horizon a voice that isn\u2019t Admiral Steele\u2019s begins to murmur about the possibility of real victory.\n \u201cForward reconnaissance found van Aken\u2019s ship adrift in a supernova remnant.\u201d Al-Alimah swallows something Laporte never saw her bite. She has a little piercing in her tongue. It\u2019s strange to imagine her going to get her tongue pierced. Maybe she put it in herself. \u201cHis crew had mutinied. An outbreak of psychosis.\u201d The sky flickers with records of violence, directionless, obscene. \u201cThen the Nemesis boarded his ship. They took him.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Laporte stops chewing. It shocks her to imagine the Nemesis claiming a single human being. That isn\u2019t their logic. That\u2019s human logic.\n \u201cYes. The Alliance had the same question.\u201d Al-Alimah points to the sky. Jawed shadows gather on the sun, four-kilometer reapers studded with foamed neutronium. \u201cThree days later, scouts sighted the first of eighty-six Sinadhuja world-killers converging on human space.\u201d\n The Alliance fought a harrowing retreat but the Nemesis poured after them, insane, inscrutable, an avalanche of noise. No central point of failure to target, like the single Sinadhuja in the first incursion. Nowhere for the Alliance to aim its might. It was like trying to kill a beehive with a rifle. Except that each bee, each Sinadhuja, was a match for half the Alliance fleet.\n Al-Alimah flashes two peace signs at Laporte. Four stars glimmer on her fingertips: two binary stars. \u201cThe war ended in Capella. The Alliance had a colony there. They decided to hold the line long enough to evacuate.\u201d Tiny model Sinadhuja warships climb out of the webs of her hands, jaws gaping. Like scarabs. Like sharks. \u201cThe Nemesis fleet did something to the system\u2019s stars. Altered their orbits. It\u2019s tempting to read it as a demonstration of power, an act of intimidation or rebuke. Except that the Nemesis never used symbolic violence before.\u201d\n Four stars roll off her fingertips and spiral down into each other. Supernova light pops, rebounds off al-Alimah\u2019s eyes, and collapses into a pinpoint devourer. The black hole.\n \u201cA hundred million civilians.\u201d Al-Alimah taps her two forefingers together, as if to telegraph the number. \u201cA quarter of their fleet. All lost.\u201d\n And something more important, too. The thing you lose when you realize that victory is impossible no matter how hard you fight.\n Monsters win, Laporte.\n Laporte thinks about grand strategy. The Nemesis might return anywhere, at any time. The Alliance needed ships, and weapons, and brilliant science, and something to offer its citizens as proof against despair\u2014a new victory to fight for. So the Alliance did the only thing it could. It set to work rebuilding the way home: reopening the Serpentis-Earth wormhole with Nemesis technology.\n And when that home refused to join the great work, the project of human survival, the Alliance resorted to war.\n \u201cAnd so we come to now,\u201d al-Alimah says. She leans back, as if she has discharged her duty, and drinks her wine. \u201cOur great predicament.\u201d\n The war between an Alliance driven by exigency, by the utilitarian, amoral need for survival, and a Federation built on humane compassion, on the idea that you do the right thing no matter the circumstance. How do you fight that war, if you\u2019re the Federation? If you can\u2019t listen to the Alliance argument without a scream of sympathy?\n You make something like NAGARI. A cadre of monsters to do what you cannot.\n The sky has changed again. It\u2019s Simms up there now. She has a face of triangles and planes, a faceted thing, and it pulls on Laporte, it engages her. Combat pilots decompose all things into geometry: threats, targets, and the potential energies between them.\n \u201cYour old Captain.\u201d Al-Alimah looks up at her too. \u201cWe never wanted to recruit her. Too conventional.\u201d\n Laporte looks away from Simms, and voices the apocalypse option.\n \u201cIf we can find some way to make the Nemesis return,\u201d she says, \u201cand then collapse the Earth-Serpentis wormhole again, we can let the Nemesis wipe out the Alliance and end the invasion.\u201d\n If they collapse the wormhole so the Nemesis can\u2019t get in, then the Federation will survive. Guarded by light-years of real space. All it will cost is a few billion human lives.\n Everything can go back to the way it was. Human paradise. A confined peace.\n al-Alimah is still waiting. Lips curled in amusement. Gunmetal eyes infected with the blind crawling light of distant computation. \u201cThat\u2019s just utilitarian strategy,\u201d she says. \u201cDoesn\u2019t take a dream to make that connection. Tell me, Laporte, why do you think I brought you here? What endgame do you think all those terror missions were training you for?\u201d\n Ken. A childhood name for a childhood friend.\n A man thought he could communicate with the Nemesis. Admiral Haywain van Aken.\n Laporte puts her fork through her cheek. In the dream, it doesn\u2019t hurt.\n capella 5/8\n Atreus must see the monster rising behind Laporte. Steele must see the shape of the demon she\u2019s conjured up out of the accretion disc. The Sinadhuja world-killer is the insignia of everything the Alliance stands against. The monster in the mist. Atreus was built in hope of killing it.\n Perhaps Steele will target his missiles at the Sinadhuja.\n Laporte coilguns another incoming missile and it flashes into annihilation so bright her canopy has to black it out like a negative sun. And Steele keeps firing at her. Atreus keeps accelerating. If he sees the Sinadhuja he doesn\u2019t maneuver in response.\n Once Steele said, about the war, about his strategy against the Federation:\n I employ overwhelming violence. Because my enemies are gentle, humane, compassionate people. Their Ubuntu philosophy cannot endure open war. And the faster I stop the war, the faster I stop the killing. So my conscience asks me to use every tool available.\n And Laporte answers him. Look what you conjured up, you brilliant, ruthless bastard. Look what you made. Someone willing to use every available tool to fight back.\n Once Simms said, about her wingman, about Laporte:\n You\u2019re insane. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re on my side.\n Laporte dances between the vectors of the missiles come to kill her and when they come too close she expends her guns on them and they intersect the snarl of the tracers and die like lightning. It\u2019s mindless, beautiful work. Like a dream. She talks to Simms:\n Boss, Morrigan. It\u2019s almost done.\n Ken stirs from his deep place to save his prize.\n nagari 8/10\n By now it\u2019s clear that the Federation will surrender. No conventional military action can defeat Steele\u2019s war logic, his simulation farm, his psychological pressure, his willingness to dive past ethical crush depth.\n So NAGARI plans to make contact with Nemesis.\n \u201cSend me in first,\u201d Laporte says.\n Consider semiosis\u2014the assignment of symbols to things, and the manipulation of those symbols to communicate and predict change. That\u2019s how intelligent life works. Build a model of the universe, test your ideas in the model, and find the best way to change the world.\n Only the Nemesis don\u2019t have any recognizable semiosis. They\u2019re a whirlwind traversing the Lacanian desert, a fatal mirage, recognizable only by the ruin of its passage.\n Until Admiral Haywain van Aken sacrificed himself. Until he somehow convinced the Nemesis to take him in.\n And ever since, the Nemesis have been speaking. Or attacking. It\u2019s hard to know.\n For more than a decade the Nemesis have been broadcasting the apparition of Admiral Haywain van Aken into human minds. The Nemesis organisms communicate by direct nerve induction at a distance. Particles wormholed into the tissue of the target. (There is, of course, no possibility that the Nemesis are a product of natural evolution.)\n \u201cIf they can do that,\u201d Laporte protests, \u201cthey can just murder us all. Cook our skulls from light-years away.\u201d Or read the brainstates of human commanders, predict everything they do, the way Laporte and Simms could predict each other.\n \u201cNo. Not without van Aken.\u201d Al-Alimah lays out NAGARI\u2019s hypothesis: the Nemesis have no mentality. They cannot conceive of other minds to predict or destroy. Their war is algorithmic, a procedure of matter against matter, spawning tactics by mutation and chance and iterating them in the field. They never leap straight to the optimal strategy, because a smart foe predicts the optimal. Their war logic is hardened by chaos. Noise.\n Van Aken is their beachhead in the land of human thought.\n \u201cHe wants you,\u201d al-Alimah says, her long fingers on Laporte\u2019s wrist again. \u201cYou in particular are valuable to him. We want you to serve as an ambassador.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s stupid.\u201d Laporte may be a monster but she is not some other monster\u2019s spawn. \u201cAre you saying I was purpose-built?\u201d\n \u201cNo. Far more likely that you were selected because you\u2019re somehow amenable to the Nemesis.\u201d Al-Alimah leans forward with her lips parted as if to admit her own monster secret. \u201cLaporte, the third Nemesis incursion is already underway. Not with warships and weapons, not this time, nothing so crude. The Nemesis are attacking the command and control systems behind those assets.\u201d\n Language. Plans. People.\n \u201cWhat are the mission parameters?\u201d The Alliance has control of the Sol-Serpentis wormhole. Laporte can\u2019t just fly out to Capella. \u201cHow do we use this to save the Federation?\u201d\n Al-Alimah stands and her gown whips in the rising wind. \u201cWe drug you and mate your brain to a computer network. You will enter a traumatic dream state and communicate with van Aken\u2014with Ken. We keep dosing you until you learn how to trigger a Nemesis attack on the Alliance. Or until you go mad.\u201d Her gunmetal eyes, looking down at Laporte, never blink. \u201cYou will be the third attempt. There were two prior candidates. They seized apart.\u201d\n Laporte leans back in her chair and looks up at the woman.\n She can be the necessary monster. She could call down genocide on the Alliance and save her beloved home. If she believes the Federation is the only hope for a compassionate, peaceful, loving future, then, logically, she should be willing to kill for it. If she has a button that says \u2018kill ten billion civilians, gain utopia,\u2019 she should press it.\n She could win the war, for the memory of Simms. And Simms is dead, right? The dead can\u2019t be ashamed.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d Laporte says. \u201cI\u2019m in. I volunteer.\u201d\n They will connect her to the NAGARI dreamscape and to the salvaged corpses of Nemesis organisms from the first incursion. They will scar messages into her brain. They will wait for the Nemesis, for the ghost of Haywain van Aken, to read them and reply.\n Surgeons crown her in waveguides that ram through her skull and penetrate the gyrae of her brain. Cold drug slurry pumps the length of her spine: entheogens, to tear down the barriers between Laporte\u2019s psyche and outside stimuli. She goes under. She dreams.\n simms 6/9nagari 9/10\n \u201cCurry\u2019s ready,\u201d Simms says, and Laporte\u2019s stomach growls out loud. They grin at each other. Simms looks at Laporte\u2019s armored tooth and her grin falters just a little.\n They eat their trash-cooked chicken curry side by side with their hips squashed together. Laporte tries not to jostle Simms\u2019 ribs with her sharp little elbows. Simms crunches on a bit of bone, makes a face, and gets juice on Laporte\u2019s buzzed hair. There is no shampoo anywhere on the ship so this is a bit of a disaster. Simms mops her up with blood cloth from the triage kit.\n \u201cTell me why it\u2019s bad if monsters don\u2019t win,\u201d Simms says, blotting at the back of her neck.\n Laporte leans on her for a moment, because she adores Simms\u2019 desire to hear this story again, especially the end. \u201cI met Ken,\u201d she says, \u201che was in the dream, and he was real. They could see him in my mind. Something triggering nerve potentials.\u201d\n She went into seizure almost instantly. The NAGARI surgeons let it happen.\n Laporte stood in the garden in Tandale with the hose in her hand and pollen itching her nose. Ants crawled over her bare feet. From the house came the smell of her parents\u2019 cooking, impatient and burnt. She looked down at herself and laughed: she was in her favorite caraval cat t-shirt.\n \u201cAh, Miss Laporte,\u201d Ken said. \u201cYou made it.\u201d\n She looked for him but all she could see was the ants fighting, killing, generating new castes, mutating themselves into acid bombs and huge-headed tunnel plugs. \u201cAdmiral,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that you?\u201d\n \u201cDelighted to speak with you again. Let me briefly outline the necessary intelligence. A short history of all life. Then we can arrange our covenant.\u201d\n Whatever Ken said to her must have been some kind of code, parasitic and adaptable, because it expressed itself as a love story. A story about Laporte and Simms.\n Imagine this, Ken said, imagine a universe of Laportes and Simmses. Lorna Simms has rules. She builds communities, like her squadron, or like a network of wormholes. She takes the wildcat aces and the ne\u2019er-do-wells, the timid and the berserk, and she teaches them all how to work together. When that work is done, Simms would like to leave you with a nice set of rules describing a world that makes sense. Simms is a Maker.\n \u201cHuh.\u201d Simms puts a little moonshine on the rag and keeps scrubbing at Laporte\u2019s head. \u201cYou have such nice dreams about me.\u201d\n \u201cWait until you hear mine.\u201d\n The other great class of life is the Laportes. (These are tendencies, mind, not binary teams. But they are real: vital parts of the history of life in the universe.) The Laportes rattle around breaking things, claiming things, reshaping things. They can achieve every bit as much as the Simmses, in their own way\u2014but their triumphs are conquests, seductions, acts of passion and violence. The Simms build systems and the Laportes, parasites and predators and conquerors and geniuses and sociopaths, change them.\n Whether delightful or destructive, the Laportes are Monsters.\n When a Laporte meets a Simms, they fight. The Laporte might run rampant. She might murder the Simms, or trick her into subservience, or leave her spent and exhausted. Or the Simms might win, fencing the Laporte in with loyalties and laws, making her a useful part of something bigger. Understand? You following, Simms?\n \u201cIt\u2019s about civilizations. Strategies. Game theory.\u201d Simms is a war junkie in her own way, a good self-directed Ubuntu learner, and she\u2019s done her homework. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet, Laporte, that I know where your Admiral\u2019s going. The Simms win.\u201d\n They win because they understand the Laportes. They make little models of what the Laportes are going to do, and they figure out how to get ahead of them, how to make their worst impulses useful, how to save them from harm (or lead them into it). They teach the Laportes what they can and cannot do.\n Like Steele. Building statistical models of the Federation\u2019s tactics. Caging them in a prophecy of their own capabilities. And the only way out of that cage is to transgress the laws you use to define yourself.\n \u201cHold still,\u201d Simms says. \u201cThis stuff really likes your hair.\u201d\n \u201cThe Simmses do tend to win.\u201d Laporte leans back against her, just a little. When Simms is fixing Laporte up she forgets to be stiff and wary. \u201cThey win too much. And over billions of years, across the infinity of the universe, it turns out that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n Imagine the god-Simms, ascendant. Puppeteering the cosmos with invisible loyalties. Learning how to guide the passions and the violence of the Laportes. Imagine Simms building not just a good squadron or a good civilization but a good galaxy, all the matter in it optimized for happy, useful thought.\n Imagine a Simms setting out to build a rechnender raum: thinking space. Her laws written into the fundament.\n \u201cHow did you learn all this?\u201d Laporte asked the scurrying ants. In the shapes of their war she saw the ghost of an old man with dead stars in his eyes.\n Ken had surmised some of it before his rebellion. And while the Nemesis had never communicated with him directly, they had, in their own way, signaled the truth: duplicating Haywain von Aken\u2019s consciousness millions of times, torturing it into madness, and exterminating the branches whose madnesses diverged from their desire.\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure I follow that last part,\u201d Simms says. Now she\u2019s mopping the curry from behind Laporte\u2019s right ear. \u201cSomething about supercivilizations?\u201d\n \u201cImagine a place where everything could have anything it needed. For whatever it wanted.\u201d That was the happy Simms-world. Imagine a purpose? You can obtain it. You can get the resources you need.\n \u201cLike an Ubuntu slogan.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Laporte says, shivering. That was what Ubuntu wanted to make. A place where people had everything they needed to be good. A place without violence and deprivation.\n In the garden, Admiral Haywain van Aken told her that a universe without violence or deprivation was destined for something worse.\n Cancer.\n capella 6/8\n Her Uriel sings her death to her.\n DV UNDERBURN is a long drumbeat, pleading for more fuel, and SPIKE [COBRA TAME/ATREUS] is a-keening like headache, and MUSIC SOUR describes itself, and every time Steele fires she hears VAMPIRE! and a noise like someone ringing her molars with an armor chime.\n But she\u2019s not going to die. She\u2019s too fast. She\u2019s too fierce. She\u2019s severed all the connections that would slow her down.\n She kills a missile half a second from killing her and for an instant all her sensors are flash-blind but she kills the next too, a dead reckoning snapshot from a hundred kilometers with the pin graser. How? Because she has escaped the borders of herself. The Sinadhuja has trained its sensors on her. Ken is watching her. And she can see through his eyes.\n She can think with his tissue, his fatal substrate. She is bleeding out of herself and into the Nemesis, the totipotent holocide-mind, the killing anima. Crossing the bridge Ken built.\n Admiral Steele is calling to her. \u201cFederation pilot,\u201d he\u2019s saying, in that rich purring voice, not audibly afraid, \u201cyou have been compromised by Nemesis psywar. Kill your engines and shut down your defensive jamming.\u201d\n Ken is calling to her. Miss Laporte. Come closer. We can complete our covenant. Together, we can save humanity.\n \u201cOkay, Boss,\u201d Laporte says. \u201cLet\u2019s get ready.\u201d\n nagari 10/10\n Cancer, and its relationships to paradise and love:\n You build a place without violence or deprivation. A place where anything can have everything it needs to be its finest, fullest self.\n This is how cells became organisms. How people became civilizations. How a bunch of misfits and fuckups became a fighting unit almost tough enough to challenge Admiral Steele. A Simms wrote some laws to say: if we pool our energies, we can create a common good. And if you follow the rules, yeah, you, Laporte, if you don\u2019t eat too much common good, if you put in more than you take out, then we can last.\n Imagine a Simms-god rampant, organizing the universe, winning the love of all the Laportes. So productive and persuasive that no one notices its ultimate agenda is hollow, self-referential, malignant.\n Think about me. Organize everyone and everything to think about me. What am I? I am thinking about how to make everything think about me. I am a tumor, recruiting every system I encounter in the name of my own expansion.\n \u201cWhoa, now.\u201d Simms puts a wet finger on the back of Laporte\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m very compelling, sure. Magnetic. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n \u201cShh. Let me finish.\u201d Except, Laporte realizes, she is finished. That\u2019s the whole story. \u201cvan Aken believes in a cosmic proof: the axiomatic, mathematical superiority of cancer to all forms of containment. An empty thought that consumes intelligent systems and uses them to think about propagating itself.\u201d\n Given a range of purposes, and a surplus of resources, one purpose would always triumph: the purpose of defeating and incorporating all other purposes. The two ant colonies in Laporte\u2019s garden had to dedicate themselves entirely to war. If one of them spent part of its energy on ant compassion, or ant culture, or ant art, it would lose. Cancer was the destiny of smart systems: empty, voracious, every part of them thinking about nothing but how to expand.\n Unless there was someone with a hose to pour water on them.\n \u201cSo,\u201d Simms says, humoring Laporte\u2019s great mythic rant, \u201cwhy do we still have a universe? Why are we here, thinking about ourselves?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what I asked van Aken,\u201d Laporte lies. Because she feels that it would be too creepy, too alien, to admit that she understood it right away.\n In the part of the story she\u2019s avoiding, in the garden of the seizure dream, Laporte turned on her hose and began flooding her childhood constructs into mud. \u201cThe Nemesis are the anti-malignancy measure. They kill Makers. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so noisy and inefficient. So they can escape the models that Makers use to win wars.\u201d\n From a distant Nemesis construct, tumbling through the ergosphere of Capella, borrowing the black hole\u2019s energies to hurl charged particles through quantum wormholes into Laporte\u2019s mind, Ken smiled his agreement. Tattooed it into Laporte\u2019s brain.\n If you were afraid of intelligent thought consuming the universe, you had to turn the cosmos into an acid bath. An endless war against the triumph of Lorna Simms.\n simms 7/9\n \u201cOkay,\u201d Simms says, squinting. \u201cI think I got it all.\u201d She leans down, curled over Laporte\u2019s head, to look her in the eyes. \u201cWhat happened next? Did you make the deal?\u201d\n \u201cI did.\u201d She asked Ken: how do I get the Nemesis to wipe out the Alliance? And he told her: you must come to me, in Capella. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going out tomorrow.\u201d\n Simms blinks, once, twice, a sign that she doesn\u2019t like this place, she wants to move on. They\u2019re touching on the open question, the raw wound between them. Is Simms going to fly again? Is she going to be part of Laporte\u2019s mutiny?\n Are they still wingmen?\n \u201cAnd then?\u201d Simms asks, pushing them past the moment.\n \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out. I couldn\u2019t wake up.\u201d It\u2019s funny how sharp Simms looks, upside down. Like she has some inverse swagger. Laporte wants to ask her to stay right there but what does Simms see, looking back? Is the inverse Laporte agreeable? \u201cContact with the Nemesis was killing me. I had no reason to live. Nothing to come back for.\u201d\n She\u2019s seen the recordings of her brainstate. The seizure burning from skull to stem.\n When Simms smiles upside down it looks like a grimace, which makes it much more familiar. \u201cSo they gave you anticonvulsants. And you woke up. Then you made up this part to help you get laid.\u201d\n Laporte tells her anyway. \u201cAl-Alimah whispered to me. And I heard her. She said\u2026\u201d\n \u201cSimms is alive,\u201d Simms says. \u201cShe survived radiation therapy, and now she\u2019s out there. Looking for you.\u201d\n That was how Laporte came back from the seizure dream, just in time to fight in the Mars gambit and rage at the Federation\u2019s final surrender. Word came down: it\u2019s over. Move to a holding orbit. Await terms. Al-Alimah tore the orders up and all the assembled NAGARI operators made a satisfied growl like they were too angry to cheer.\n \u201cAnd that\u2019s how you got back to me.\u201d Simms kisses her on the right eyeball. \u201cYou\u2019re a sweet liar.\u201d\n \u201cEw,\u201d Laporte says. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n But she smiles and\u2014\n capella 0/8\n \u2014tries to catch Simms\u2019 hand.\n \u201cYou\u2019re meeting with the Admiralty tonight.\u201d Simms claps her on the shoulders, boom boom, look at you, kid, you\u2019re a big shot. And then she draws away, upright, articulate, her flight suit unzipped and tied around her waist, her hair loose on her shoulders. She backs away from Laporte in triangular half-steps, back leg then front, as if they\u2019re fighting and she is making room to retreat. The air that rushes in to fill the absence of her is cold and it smells of burnt curry.\n \u201cI am,\u201d Laporte says, wishing she would stay close. \u201cI\u2019m presenting the final battle plan. Al-Alimah\u2019s victory gambit.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell them you have a plan to bait the Nemesis into attacking the Alliance. A strategic distraction. When Steele pulls his fleet out of Sol, we can seal the node and live in peace.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n \u201cBut that\u2019s not the plan.\u201d Simms aims one finger at her, a half-curled, hey-you stab. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell them the real plan. That\u2019s between you and your NAGARI friends.\u201d\n The Nemesis are insuperable. Nothing can defeat them. They have unlimited resources (their warships conjured out of black hole accretion discs by probability manipulation) and their behavior, well, that\u2019s even worse: they have no mentality, no strategy to predict, nothing that can generate a nice clean model. Only a godslaying virulence, a random and chilling will to annihilate, manifesting strategies and hurling them at the enemy until the enemy has exhausted all countermeasures and taught the Nemesis their strengths.\n To fight them is to instruct them how to kill you.\n Haywain van Aken has summoned Laporte to Capella. To the black hole that is the Nemesis\u2019 engine, factory, and beacon in human space. Why? Laporte has a guess. They have no purpose or objectives of their own\u2014those are Maker things, teleological, forbidden to them. Only their basic logic: whatever we encounter, we destroy.\n But they didn\u2019t kill van Aken. They took him into communion. Maybe that act brought them closer to victory. Maybe, to them, subverting van Aken was an act of destruction: a lethality enhancement.\n \u201cI believe,\u201d Laporte begins, struggling, trying to hide her struggle, this is so hard to say because it requires her to navigate around her secret fear: that she is about to abandon Simms again, forever, in favor of the consummate monstrosity. \u201cI believe I can trigger a Nemesis behavior that will exterminate everyone in Alliance space. I believe the Federation will endure. Humanity will have a chance at survival.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s how we save the Federation? How we keep Ubuntu alive? Sacrifice ten billion human lives?\u201d Simms crosses her arms. \u201cWe\u2019re okay with defensive genocide?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s war. We kill people to achieve our objectives.\u201d\n Simms\u2019 hard eyes radiating a hard signal, and Laporte reads it in a way that\u2019s maybe unfair: I liked knowing that you were my monster. I liked knowing you had boundaries. \u201cWe kill soldiers.\u201d\n \u201cPeople,\u201d Laporte says, echoing the old Ubuntu lessons: everyone is human. There is no justifiable violence\u2014only degrees of tragedy. \u201cWe\u2019re always killing people.\u201d\n They stare at each other and on the raw metal deck between them Laporte can feel them piling the tally, the killcounts, the fighter pilots and warship crews they\u2019ve murdered personally, the deaths contingent upon those by way of grief or loss (children abandoned, lovers driven to suicide, parents spiraling away into addiction). The strategic targets and footprint bleed and noncombatant bycatch and for Laporte it all wraps up in the voice of some terrified Alliance contractor on a suit radio trying to explain that he doesn\u2019t support this war, doesn\u2019t want to be here, he\u2019s just trying to pay off his electrical apprenticeship, would they please send a rescue ship, he\u2019s tumbling off into space and his radiation warnings are red and he doesn\u2019t want to drown in his own vomit, please, please. Send help.\n When the Alliance captured Earth orbit, Admiral Steele threatened to bomb a city every hour until the Federation issued an unconditional surrender. What else could he do? Not with every soldier in the Alliance could he occupy even one continent. He had to use the tools at his disposal. He had to resort to calculated atrocity in the name of final peace.\n Funny how that Ubuntu lesson can turn around, isn\u2019t it? How easily degrees of tragedy becomes degrees of necessity.\n \u201cYou told me,\u201d Laporte says, \u201cthat if I hesitated, I would die. So I never hesitate.\u201d\n Simms looks at her old wingman and new lover and whatever she\u2019s looking at is receding fast. \u201cI hate them,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I hate them enough to do this.\u201d\n Laporte wants to grin and quip. She would tell Simms what Simms told her: monsters win.\n But if she says that, she\u2019s telling Simms that this is all on her. That she\u2019s the one who made Laporte.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no alternative,\u201d she says instead. \u201cIf we surrender to the Alliance, it\u2019s all been for nothing. We become part of the war against the Nemesis. And the Nemesis kill us all.\u201d\n Simms does something with the fear in her eyes. Like she\u2019s folding it up and pointing it at something. \u201cThis al-Alimah woman. Were you two close?\u201d\n \u201cNot like that.\u201d Not like you.\n \u201cI want to talk to her.\u201d Simms points at the deck behind Laporte, like a cue to turn around, and in doing that she makes it clear: the meeting will not include Laporte. \u201cI\u2019ve got some concerns to articulate.\u201d\n \u201cFine.\u201d She can\u2019t keep the petty irritation from her voice. They should be together, effortlessly and unanimously lethal, two fists on the same fighter. \u201cAre you flying with me tomorrow? When I go put out the signal?\u201d\n \u201cI still need to check myself over in the simulator,\u201d Simms says. \u201cMake sure the radiation shakes are gone.\u201d\n Laporte\u2019s flown with her long enough to hear the no.\n capella 7/8\n She is in her Uriel, fighting off Steele, falling into the dead star and the waiting Sinadhuja.\n She is in communion with the Sinadhuja. There are hallucinations puncturing her mind. She is in the garden with Ken.\n \u201cThis is the bargain,\u201d he says.\n He\u2019s a tall, strong-jawed man in the broadshouldered uniform of an Alliance admiral. He must be proud of that uniform, because he still wears his short-billed cap and his insignia. But the texture of him is black and squirming and when Laporte touches him she sees he\u2019s made of ants, ants at war, lopping limbs and antennae off each other with their scissored jaws.\n Her fingers come away acid-burnt.\n \u201cAre you ready?\u201d Haywain van Aken says. His eyes are two rings of fire, the accretion discs of two dead suns. \u201cDo you understand what\u2019s about to happen?\u201d\n The Sinadhuja looms up behind her fighter. Four kilometers long and pregnant with methods of extinction. As it matches velocity with her ship its thrusters flare violet-black, the jets decaying sideways into some hidden curled dimension. It is attacking her, speaking to her, these two are the same. The Nemesis can never understand human minds well enough to manipulate them. But they have Haywain van Aken to do it for them.\n \u201cThe Nemesis exist to tear down conscious thought,\u201d Laporte says to Ken.\n She is in the cockpit, nudging the stick, steering her Uriel into the Sinadhuja\u2019s open gullet. All the alarms have gone silent, except one: PROXIMITY. PROXIMITY. Steele\u2019s voice is an electronic scratch, fading off, saying: Brevet-Admiral Laporte, you are compromised. It\u2019s not too late. You can still self-destruct. You can still take out your sidearm and shoot yourself in the head. Brevet-Admiral Laporte, last time someone did this they blew up four suns\u2014\n \u201cThe Nemesis have internal safeguards. Processes designed to rip apart any accidental intelligence they develop.\u201d Ken\u2019s peeling off the skin of his left-arm, degloving it, creating a sacrament of killing ants. \u201cBut this makes it hard for them to win.\u201d\n They can\u2019t create their own leaders. They can\u2019t build models of the things they need to kill. They can summon up infinite might, but never learn how to apply it efficiently. How could they? In their fundamental state the Nemesis are a storm, a destructive process. Semiosis, the use of symbols to understand and plan, is forbidden to them.\n A storm is powerful. But smart things can shelter from a storm.\n So how do they defeat the gods of thought using only the logic of annihilation? Or, more aptly: what tactics might they stumble on, in their blind exploration of the possibility space?\n Laporte cups her hands and accepts the sacrament. The ants start eating her flesh. She crushes them between her palms, to show her strength, and it only drives them deeper.\n \u201cThey provoke the creation of monsters,\u201d she says. \u201cExperts at the use of violence. And then they consume them to enhance their own violence.\u201d\n \u201cYou will lead the Nemesis in war against the Alliance,\u201d van Aken intones, reading the sacred terms, the covenant he sacrificed himself to create. \u201cYou will guide them as long as you can. Inevitably, you will be devoured by the Nemesis, and your authority will be erased. But as long as you endure, you can protect your home.\u201d\n The ants are inside her now. She can feel them under her skin. She looks at her arms and sees them in her muscle, bound by violence, grappling and flexing. The Alliance\u2019s spies and admirals would drink razors to get a look at her brain right now, full of the alien logic that will give her a transient kind of power over the local Nemesis.\n \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asks. Ken was a good friend, once, with good advice, even if he\u2019s now the organizing point of all Nemesis behavior in human space. \u201cHow long will you last?\u201d\n His smile is warm and toothy, an earnest, clever smile, and each tooth in it is a broad-headed warrior ant. \u201cHumanity is going to be at war with Nemesis for a long, long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI am the anima in command of semiotic warfare. I am the Admiral of communion. I keep myself from the jaws by supplying the Nemesis with new weapons. And if you can manage the Nemesis, Miss Laporte, if you can keep the fire burning hot\u2026then I will have new monsters to cultivate.\u201d\n \u201cAh,\u201d she says, satisfied. She gets it! It makes simple sense.\n Van Aken knows how to achieve a kind of common ground with the Nemesis. How to make humanity at least temporarily useful. The Nemesis devoured van Aken because he could enhance their lethality. Make them better monsters.\n Humanity will defy the Nemesis as long as their strength lasts. They\u2019ll get ruthless. And thus they will become the Nemesis\u2019 monster farm. A new drop in the acid bath. Victory is not only annihilation: it\u2019s monster-genesis.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry your lover abandoned you,\u201d Ken says. \u201cShe was a good person, deep down. That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t understand the necessity of our work.\u201d\n The jaws of the Sinadhuja begin to close around Laporte\u2019s ship.\n simms 8/9\n After the curry-and-cosmology fight, they go to the gym to beat the shit out of each other. That helps less than it used to: Simms is still weak and they both know it, and holding back in a fight is just like lying anywhere else.\n Showers require less discipline than they used to. They retreat to their haven in the officers\u2019 cabins, freed up by the death of most of Eris\u2019 staff, and they have makeup sex. It\u2019s the night before the mutiny, before Laporte asks Simms, one last time, to be her zombie warrior buddy cop. The night before Simms says, sorry, I\u2019m not mission capable.\n Laporte drowses in Simms\u2019 arms and then she wakes up to the sight of al-Alimah leaning over her. She\u2019s upgraded her eyes. They are blind, brilliant silver. The stud in her tongue gleams like Laporte\u2019s armor tooth.\n \u201cThe mission,\u201d al-Alimah says, \u201cbegins now.\u201d\n By reflex (it\u2019s all reflex, love reflex) Laporte reaches for Simms who\u2019s curled up beside her and in need of protection. But no one\u2019s there: only a warm place. She sits up to shove al-Alimah back. Simms pounces on her from behind, Laporte recognizes the feel of her forearms and the smell of her, she tries to fight but Simms is stronger, she\u2019s stronger, she was holding back in the gym. She pins Laporte facedown in the mattress with a growl.\n Al-Alimah puts a needle into Laporte\u2019s neck and the world goes out.\n Laporte remembers this as just a dream. Not because it\u2019s true, but because it\u2019s useful.\n nagari 11/10\n \u201cStop asking me to fly with you,\u201d Simms says. \u201cI\u2019m done. I can\u2019t be part of this. That\u2019s my final decision.\u201d\n This is the moment before Laporte falls into Capella. At the end of the mutiny, in the slim window before Steele catches up with the NAGARI task force and stops them from breaching Nemesis space. Laporte\u2019s Uriel is waiting on the Eris hangar deck with a full warload and two empty seats. There is no time for hesitation.\n \u201cBoss,\u201d Laporte says, reaching out. She\u2019s sealed up in her flightsuit and when she touches Simms it\u2019s through the interface of her tactical gloves, fireproof, skin-sealed, built to insulate and protect. \u201cHey.\u201d\n Not again, she wants to say. Don\u2019t do this again. We survived this. We split up but we found each other again and we cooked some curry and fixed some fighters, we\u2019re so close, we\u2019re going to win. For values of victory encompassing genocide.\n Simms pulls away. \u201cYou\u2019re not the woman I knew,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can go make your bargain. But I don\u2019t want to be part of it.\u201d\n Their orbit is over. The punch-drunk bloodlust and the will to win. They\u2019ve spiraled too close and now they will fling each other away, each of them ballistic and alone. Simms prefers defeat.\n \u201cLaporte,\u201d al-Alimah calls, from the Eris\u2019 CIC. \u201cWe\u2019re losing time. Are you airborne?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t need me,\u201d Simms says. \u201cYou never have.\u201d\n Laporte wants to say something clever, to fix this. An alien told me that every Laporte needs a Simms. That monsters have to love makers, so they can hone each other. So they can keep a safe orbit. Simms, if you go, I don\u2019t know how to find my way back.\n But this time it\u2019s Simms who walks away from her.\n Laporte flies through the wormhole, into Capella. Into the maw of the singularity. She falls.\n capella 8/8simms 9/9\n The jaws of the Sinadhuja close around her ship. Armored mandibles clamping down to protect the warship\u2019s antimatter stores and soft internal structure and most of all van Aken, who is the bridge the Nemesis need, the means of their third incursion. Shutting off the ring of receding starlight, and the blue nova of the Atreus high above.\n The Uriel\u2019s navigational lights illuminate the Sinadhuja\u2019s interior. Laporte scans serrated geometry swarming with jointed, armored Nemesis organisms. Somewhere down there van Aken\u2019s human body has been translated, or consumed, into a component of the Sinadhuja. A semiotic weapons system.\n Ken. Who is in Laporte\u2019s head, who knows what she knows. Who knows that Atreus is here to kill her. Who knows that she left Simms on a hangar deck in Vega.\n Laporte\u2019s armored tooth fires a jolt of pain up the side of her jaw.\n \u201cBoss, Morrigan,\u201d Laporte says. She knows she has to say this. A dream told her. \u201cWe\u2019re a go. Wake up. Do it.\u201d\n In the Uriel\u2019s back seat, the electronic warfare station, Simms smashes her helmet against the headrest in surprise.\n \u201cFuck!\u201d she says. Her voice is dry like paper tearing. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d\n Laporte\u2019s weapons panel lights up with status reports. An IV dumping combat stimulants into Simms\u2019 blood, a cardiac implant restarting her heart, reflex sequencers firing commands into her brainstem. Waking her up from functional death. Since they left Eris together, Simms has been sustained by the emergency oxygen in her synthetic bone marrow and whatever black-ops technofuckery al-Alimah cranked into her.\n Hidden from Haywain van Aken\u2019s communion. From his semiosis weapon, his dream of ants, his bridge into conscious minds.\n In the garden, Ken says: \u201cShe left you. She thought you were an abomination. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n Understand. That wonderful word. Laporte, giddy with the knowledge that Simms is alive again (again!), alive and flying with her, just can\u2019t resist the quip: \u201cJust a bad dream, Ken.\u201d\n \u201cAl-Alimah. She fabricated that event and put it in you. Why?\u201d The formicidae face tilts. \u201cWhat about your mission, Laporte? What about human survival?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re the mission, Ken.\u201d The Nemesis never manifested any central vulnerabilities during the second incursion. Never organized around any one point of weakness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n In the back cockpit Simms is speaking into her COM, the quick clipped voice of a veteran combat pilot, signaling for backup: \u201cAtreus, Atreus, this is TROJAN. Request fire mission, flash priority, target is a Sinadhuja world-killer with enemy command assets aboard. Jump vectors coming now\u2014\u201d\n Laporte\u2019s helmet pokes her in the back of the head. ALERT! it complains. EMCON VIOLATION! It doesn\u2019t like what Simms is doing, hotloading the reactor, shunting power into the ship\u2019s IFF and navigational beacons. Broadcasting targeting data on an Alliance tactical channel: a screaming, desperate plea to shoot me.\n \u201cTROJAN, Atreus.\u201d Steele\u2019s scalpel voice faint, so faint, distorted by the Sinadhuja\u2019s armor and defensive jamming, by the grip of the black hole. By all these things keeping his missiles at bay. \u201cWe have your target. Stand by for fire. Godspeed, pilots.\u201d\n Maybe, in younger and less certain days, Laporte and Simms would have paused to say things left unsaid. To say goodbye.\n But they don\u2019t need that now. They\u2019re on the same frequency. Much like the Atreus and the Uriel gunship, which is looking around the Sinadhuja\u2019s guts with its targeting package, plotting trajectories with its navigational sensors, and telling Steele where, exactly, to fire his miracle missiles.\n It\u2019s very hard to kill a Sinadhuja. From the outside.\n In the garden, Ken makes a soft, thoughtful noise. \u201cYou knew I\u2019d read your memories. So you let Simms and al-Alimah use you as a weapon. They leveraged Admiral Steele into cooperating with you. They used the NAGARI dreamscape to fabricate Simms abandoning you. And I believed it, because I cared about you.\u201d\n Laporte grins an ant-tongued grin. She came here knowing, in a veiled way, that Simms was waiting for her. But she had no idea, all the way down, whether Steele had actually agreed to the plan. Whether his missiles were feints or fatally true.\n But she knows, right now (as the first of Steele\u2019s fusion bombs jumps in ten meters off her nose and arcs off towards the back of the Sinadhuja\u2019s interior) exactly what she needs to do. She needs to live. And so does Simms.\n Laporte touches the stick, one last time, to line up the Uriel\u2019s cockpit with the gap in the armored jaws above.\n \u201cEject!\u201d In pilot code, you always say it three times, to make it real. \u201cEject, eject!\u201d\n She gets a nanosecond glimpse of Simms in the backseat mirror. She\u2019s grinning like an idiot.\n Laporte pulls the wasp-colored handle between her legs. Her ejection seat hurls her starward, between the flashing jump-sign and corkscrewing trails of Atreus\u2019 missiles, up through the Sinadhuja\u2019s jaws and away. She\u2019s turning as she rises, g-force snapping the acceleration sumps in the seat, and she can see another light with her, orbiting her, no, it\u2019s not an orbit, they\u2019re just flying together, co-moving.\n \u201cSimms!\u201d she calls. \u201cBoss!\u201d\n Down beneath them the Sinadhuja\u2019s drive flares up red and massive and vomits debris and cuts out. The world-killer drops away, free falling, a mountain conjured up out of the black hole and now reclaimed by it. A flash of annihilation light blows through its hull down astern and suddenly it\u2019s geysering jets of molten metal, crumpling on itself, jump missiles darting out of the interior and curving back to re-attack with their submunitions scattering out behind them like fairy dust.\n In the garden Ken says: \u201cThis is a selfish choice, Miss Laporte. What do you gain by killing me? You know they\u2019ll keep coming. You know they always win.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe.\u201d Laporte sprays him with her garden hose. He\u2019s already falling to pieces, ants sloughing off and returning to the dirt. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll make enough monsters to stop them.\u201d\n Is that, his fading voice asks, how you want things to be? Everything honed to fight? Irrevocably weaponized?\n Laporte doesn\u2019t know what to say to that. She has been a monster. But she\u2019s going to see Simms again, and when they\u2019re together, she won\u2019t feel like anything but a happy woman. Is monsterhood conditional? Like a mirror you hold up to the war around you, just long enough to win?\n Everything dies. Even humanity, Laporte supposes. Maybe how you live should count for more than how long you last.\n Admiral van Aken sends a soft farewell. He doesn\u2019t seem angry. More proud than anything.\n Godspeed, he says. And good luck, Miss Laporte.\n The Sinadhuja\u2019s hull shatters. Blazes up in dirty fire and fades to ash and smelt and then the ruin of the world-killer falls away. Down below, in the accretion disk, black shapes begin to stir.\n \u201cGood kill,\u201d Simms says, like they\u2019re still back in Sol, shooting down bad Alliance pilots. Her voice is tinny over the suit radios, but very confident. \u201cScratch one Nemesis warship.\u201d\n High above them, silhouetted against the distant bundled stars, Atreus has turned over. She\u2019s decelerating, burning \u2018up\u2019, trying to stop herself from hitting the black hole. Trying to make it back to the wormhole above.\n \u201cTROJAN, Atreus.\u201d Steele quite calm and utterly polite\u2014disappointingly unmoved to cheer. Laporte would\u2019ve liked to rattle the bastard. \u201cWe have your beacons. A search and rescue craft is on the way. Reply if able.\u201d\n \u201cMorrigan.\u201d Simms calling. \u201cMorrigan, it\u2019s Boss.\u201d\n \u201cAtreus, this is Eris, Federation Second Fleet.\u201d Another transmission. Stretched by blueshift and spiked by radiation. \u201cWe have transited the wormhole. We are deploying tankers to assist your escape burn.\u201d\n \u201cCopy you, Eris. Put your tankers on GUARD for rendezvous control.\u201d\n \u201cMorrigan!\u201d Simms calls. \u201cWe\u2019re fucked!\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it, Boss?\u201d\n \u201cWe got cooked pretty bad, Laporte.\u201d She sounds more disgusted than afraid. \u201cGamma flash. Check your rad meter.\u201d\n Laporte picks the radiation alarm out of the small congress of alerts on her suit visor. It wants her to know that she\u2019s absorbed a critical dose, that she needs medical assistance, and that she should consider recording a last message for her loved ones.\n \u201cUgh,\u201d Simms says. She makes an about-to-spit noise and then, considering her helmet, abandons it. \u201cI\u2019m going to have so much cancer.\u201d\n Laporte dismisses the alarm and cues up an anti-emetic injection. They\u2019ll be okay. A little radiation never kept a good Federation pilot down. She starts tapping her seat thrusters, moving towards Simms, and look, Simms is already headed for her. As they pass they reach out and grab each other by their forearms so that they turn together around a common point.\n \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay, boss,\u201d she says. She can hear the beacon of the search-and-rescue ship, howling down to them from the stars above, and the frame-shifted scream of the black-hole-eating light, far down below. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n Simms claps her on the wrist, once and then again. \u201cMe too, Morrigan.\u201d She\u2019s still grinning. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n FLASH FLASH FLASH\n ISN BACKBREAKER FASTEST\n S 0348 BAST $DATE_DYNAMIC_REFRAME\n FM SECCON//BETAQ\n TO ALLIANCE HIGHER\n \n NEMESIS PSYWAR CHANNEL DESTROYED IN CAPELLA STRIKE BY JOINT FEDERATION/ALLIANCE ACTION\n ALLIANCE SPECIAL ASSETS RECOVERED.

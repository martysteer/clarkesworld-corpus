He feels his cube start to move in the dark. He grips both sides of his bed, the square slab that is the cell\u2019s only furnishing. He observes his emaciated reflection in the dark glass wall across from him, scabbed lips and eyes plunged deep into their sockets.\n Pilo used to try to make himself more presentable when he heard the bell, tried to comb the skin flakes from his matted hair or pick the grime out from under his nails. Now he is beyond caring what the guards see.\n The cube lurches up, sideways, down. There is a magnetic clack and then his wall is pressed up to another. He watches the glass turn clear, black silicate trickling away. He can make out two figures. This is vaguely interesting\u2014normally only one guard performs the inspection.\n The glass turns fully transparent and Pilo frowns. The guard is there, clad head-to-toe in aggressive textile, shifting patterns that ache Pilo\u2019s head if he looks too closely. An enormous biomechanical insect clings to their back with spiny legs. Its lamprey tube hovers over the guard\u2019s shoulder, to punch holes or tranquilizers into uncooperative flesh.\n This is normal. What\u2019s abnormal is the second figure, clad in the same uniform but too small for it. The aggressive textile hangs off them like baggy pajamas. They are unarmed.\n \u201cPrisoner 8403, approach the glass.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to tell if the filter-buzz words come from the guard\u2019s mouth or from the lamprey tube. \u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d\n The word stabs adrenaline straight through his rib cage. Pilo is frozen for a moment. Then he crawls off the bed, falls, levers himself upright. His legs feel hollow. His head feels light. Some of it is hunger. The nozzle by the bed provides only a pale gritty paste, so sporadically that Pilo sometimes suspects a slow, calculated starvation.\n Most of it is shock. He has never had a visitor here in the dark.\n The visitor tugs at the hood concealing their face. \u201cI really have to wear this fucking thing?\u201d\n Pilo flinches at the profanity, which is not permitted in the cube. The visitor must have special permissions. He is not sure if the question is for him or for the guard, but his mouth and throat are not ready to speak, so he lets the guard answer.\n \u201cThat\u2019s protocol.\u201d Their voice buzzes like an agitated bee swarm. \u201cYou want to talk to this butcher, you follow protocol.\u201d\n The visitor puffs a laugh; it flutters the fabric of their hood. The aggressive textile stabs at Pilo\u2019s eyes. He squints, still massaging his jaw, moving his tongue in a practice circuit around his mouth.\n \u201cSo this is where you ended up, huh, Pi?\u201d The visitor\u2019s voice is less distorted than the guard\u2019s. Fem-leaning, almost familiar. They look past him, to the bed, to the nozzle, to the conical water hole that serves as his sink and toilet both. \u201cVery chic. Minimalist. You always did have an eye for interiors.\u201d\n Pilo is ready. He snorkels the last of the phlegm from his throat and speaks. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n The visitor doesn\u2019t respond; for a moment he thinks his shredded whisper was not loud enough to pass through the glass. He is opening his mouth to try again when the visitor shakes their head, hacks out another half of a laugh.\n \u201cI\u2019m not doing this,\u201d they say. \u201cI\u2019m not playing this game. You know who I am.\u201d\n Pilo chews his cheek, thinking hard. \u201cSomeone whose life I wrecked,\u201d he suggests. That is, after all, his role in most things. He is a destroyer.\n The visitor cocks their head to one side. \u201cMaybe you really don\u2019t remember,\u201d they mutter. \u201cMaybe you been in here that long.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s just getting started,\u201d says the guard. \u201cTwo centuries to go.\u201d\n \u201cFuck this,\u201d the visitor says, and yanks their hood down.\n The guard gives a buzzing shriek, something about necessary protocol, and the black silicate begins to swirl. Pilo throws himself against the wall, forehead mashed to glass. Just before it goes fully opaque, before the dark cocoons him, he sees someone he knows.\n After the chaos of the derailed visitation, it should be a relief to return to routine. Instead, the encounter gnaws at him. He replays it ad nauseum, sifts it over, focusing on the visitor\u2019s voice and mannerisms and the brief slice of a face he is certain he recognized. He begins to pace the dimensions of his cell, caloric energy he cannot spare.\n There has never been a visitor before. There might never be a visitor again. He might be left with only the memory, and eventually his attempts to maintain his grip on it will grind it out to nothing between his palms. Then it will be him and the dark again.\n Which is as it should be, of course. Him and the dark, away from everyone and everything that he might otherwise destroy.\n Pilo wants to destroy something now. He clenches his fists until his knuckles ache, and pounds them against the glass. The cell hums a deep vibrato. Pilo pounds and screams until his lungs can only heave up a labored rasp.\n He slumps onto the bed. He lies there for an hour or a day.\n The two-tone bell chimes, the cell jolts, and Pilo nearly falls from the bed. He grips the concrete edges as the cell shifts up, down, and right. The magnets connect. Glass clacks to glass, and the shroud clears like swirling ink.\n There\u2019s only one guard standing there for another inspection. No visitor. This is normal. The guard doesn\u2019t move or speak. This is not normal. The usual rigidity of their posture is gone. Their shoulders slouch and the lamprey tube sags with it, a dozing predator.\n \u201cWho was my visitor?\u201d Pilo asks, even though the guards never answer questions.\n The guard starts to twitch. Their fingers flutter like they\u2019re dancing on a datapad; their arms jolt sporadically forward and then back to their sides. They take two jerky steps toward the cell but stop at the glass wall instead of coming inside to search for nonexistent contraband.\n \u201cIs she still here?\u201d Pilo asks. \u201cIn this place?\u201d\n He squints at the guard\u2019s hidden face, through one eye and then the other, for as long as he can stand the seething fabric. He waits to be told to shut up, to stand back, to take the position.\n Instead the guard lifts their right hand to the lamprey tube\u2014clumsy, hesitant. Then farther up, feeling behind their skull. A jagged wire protrudes from the biomechanical insect on their back. Pilo watches as the guard slowly, deliberately, twists their gloved thumb down onto it.\n The blood is the brightest and most beautiful thing Pilo has ever seen through the glass. It wells out and out, a flower blooming in perpetuum. The guard puts their bloody thumb to the wall of the cell and begins to write.\n Pilo\u2019s heart hammers as the letters appear one by one, ship script. His mind whirls through narrowing possibilities as IT becomes IT\u2019S NOT becomes IT\u2019S NOT YOUR\u2014\n The guard pulls their red thumb back, grunts. They grapple at their head for a moment, as if to pry something out of it, then their posture stiffens. The lamprey tube flexes. Snaps.\n \u201cYou vermin,\u201d the guard says. \u201cYou waste.\u201d\n They slide their hand through the unfinished message, smearing a red jag across the glass. They turn and walk away, the inspection postponed, perhaps forgotten. Pilo stares at the streak, recites the words, and from those words he feels the shape of the one missing.\n The cell shrouds again, glass clouding to black.\n \u201cFault,\u201d he whispers.\n Pilo thought he had lost all track of time in this place, but now he is certain that the regular occurrence of the inspection bell has been delayed. He hears its phantom, a tinnitus in his ears, but the cube doesn\u2019t move. Or maybe he is anticipating, a brainstate he\u2019d almost forgotten, and it\u2019s the anticipation that has slowed time to a shambling crawl.\n In another life Pilo practiced meditation, but when he tries it now his body revolts. His lungs seize. His hands jump.\n When his cube finally shifts, he can\u2019t be sure if he is hallucinating or not. It glides through the dark. Stops. The glass clears. The guard appears, and this time there is no slumping, no twitching, no puppet hands dancing at their sides.\n \u201cPosition,\u201d they say, voice crunchy with distortion.\n Pilo rolls his way off the bed. He assumes his position against the adjacent wall, arms and legs spread, as if there is even a single element of the cell he is capable of dismantling and repurposing into a weapon, as if his emaciated limbs are weapons themselves.\n He watches in his peripheral as the glass opens and the guard enters, masked head on a wary swivel. The shifting pattern of their suit doesn\u2019t claw so badly at his eyeballs today. The aggressive textile is more of a soft undulation. Maybe it\u2019s glitching.\n It lets him look more closely at the guard as they circumambulate the cell, checking the food nozzle and the toilet and the featureless black slab of a bed. For a moment, his stimulation-starved brain imagines his captor as a geometric skeleton wrapped in mesh musculature.\n \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d the guard buzzes. \u201cEyes on the wall!\u201d\n Pilo is too slow to comply, distracted by his hallucination. The lamprey snaps forward like a jack-in-the-box and smashes his face into the wall he is meant to be watching. A small white supernova goes off behind his eyelids. He sinks, clutching at a nose that might be broken again, feeling hot copper blood seep through his fingers.\n \u201cPosition,\u201d the guard grates. \u201cUp! Arms out! Legs out!\u201d\n Even as they say it, they drive a booted foot into his lower back. He slams into the wall again, tries to buffer the impact with his hands. They leave vermeil smears on the black glass. A malformed message darts through his mind\u2019s eye:\n IT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n \u201cYou fecal stain,\u201d the guard says. \u201cYou bacterial graveyard. You careless butcher.\u201d\n The words feel like a catechism. The boot swings again; this time it sucks all the air from his lungs. He doubles over, curling into himself on the cold floor.\n \u201cUp,\u201d the guard orders. \u201cUp, and into position.\u201d\n Pilo turns, instead, and stares directly at his captor. Ignoring the shifting patterns, ignoring the menacing lamprey. He focuses on the shape of the guard\u2019s shoulders, which are beginning to slump, and the tilt of the guard\u2019s head, and the dangle of the guard\u2019s hands. He remembers the way they fluttered and jerked before they scrawled the bloody letters.\n It was the same guard; he is almost sure of that now. They are all the same guard.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the guard snaps, and behind the electronic buzz, Pilo hears trepidation. He realizes that his captor has wrapped their arms around their body, mocking his fetal posture.\n But when he raises one hand to wipe the blood from his bristly chin, the guard raises a hand of their own in perfect synchronization. Not mocking him. Something else.\n \u201cStop it,\u201d the guard buzzes, then, to someone else: \u201cWe have a situation in cell 8403, we have\u2014\u201d\n Pilo clenches his jaw shut as hard as he can, and the guard\u2019s insectoid voice chokes off. His pulse rushes to fill the silence. His heart pounds fragile ribs. Pilo knows he must be dreaming this. He must be tossing and turning on the bed, waiting for the two-tone bell to chime.\n He lifts his right hand high into the air. The guard mimics like a marionette, makes an angry gurgle deep in their throat. The lamprey thrashes, but it can\u2019t attack without the guard\u2019s permission, and the guard, some way, somehow, can\u2019t give permission without Pilo\u2019s.\n Slowly, slowly, he puts both hands to his own neck, where the seal of a mask would be if he were wearing one. His fingers find an intangible pressure hook. The guard\u2019s fingers find a real one.\n The guard\u2019s mask peels away, and Pilo sees the same face he sees in the black glass. Scabbed lips, sunken eyes. He stares at himself. The guard-self stares back.\n \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d he asks. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anymore.\u201d\n The guard-self twitches, hocks. A glob of saliva smacks the floor between them. \u201cYou vermin,\u201d the guard-self murmurs. \u201cYou stain.\u201d\n The catechism is back, but Pilo thinks he is losing the faith. He turns to the clear glass, peers into a dark and empty corridor.\n IT\u2019S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n \u201cPosition,\u201d he tells the guard-self. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n Pilo traverses the corridor as quickly as he can in the guard\u2019s heavy boots. He has not walked much, and already his shins are aching, his knees are clicking. A stitch burns under his bottom rib. He left the guard\u2019s weaponry on the floor of the cell, afraid to touch the writhing insectile thing, but he took the mask. It turns his panting into an anguished electric whine.\n The corridor is all corners, a maze of black glass folded in on itself, and even though Pilo has no memory of being brought to his cell, he remembers this labyrinth in intimate detail. He can envision the other cells shuffling somewhere above him in the dark, an elaborate dance.\n But when he reaches the junction, left and right open to him, he has not even a shred of intuition for which way leads to an exit. He halts there, gasping for breath.\n \u201cLeft.\u201d\n He startles. It\u2019s the visitor\u2019s voice, as crisp inside the mask as a whisper in his ear. She\u2019s the one who started all this, who set off this reaction chain, and he knows, gut-deep, that she is making a mistake. If she knew what he did, she would not be trying to help him.\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d Pilo asks, again.\n \u201cI\u2019m the person who says left and then you go left,\u201d the voice answers.\n Pilo lingers a moment longer. \u201cWhat happened in the cell? With that guard?\u201d\n Unasked: why did he have my face?\n \u201cFuck if I know,\u201d the voice says. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the blueprint, Pi. I\u2019m working with fragments of fragments here. One of which says . . . \u201d\n Pilo nods, even though she is not there to see it. He goes left.\n Up ahead, a cell is docked to the corridor for inspection. Pilo slows his stride on the visitor\u2019s suggestion, trying to make his spine straight, his head high. If he moves like a guard, maybe they won\u2019t question the bare space on his back where the bug should be.\n \u201cJust walk straight past,\u201d the visitor says. \u201cDon\u2019t even look in.\u201d\n But when he comes to the stretch of transparent glass, he can\u2019t help turning his head. The cell is identical to his, the same featureless slab of a bed, the same nozzle for food, the same hole for shit. The guard is inspecting. The prisoner is in position on the wall.\n Pilo sees his own gaunt face in profile. His veins frost shut.\n All the guards are him. All the prisoners are him, too. Either he\u2019s hallucinating, losing his mind in the dark of his cube, or\u2014\n \u201cKeep moving,\u201d the visitor hisses, and he realizes he\u2019s stopped.\n But it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s already drawn attention: his prisoner-self stares balefully at him and his guard-self follows suit, head tilting, evaluating. Pilo feels the guard\u2019s eyes trace the space where a lamprey tube should be. Feels surprise transmute to suspicion.\n \u201cMalfunction,\u201d Pilo says, by way of explanation.\n The glass walls start to wail, an alarm that shivers through the air and into his bones. Red lights strobe the corridor, and Pilo runs.\n The buzzing shouts of the guards echo through the maze; he can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re coming from ahead or behind as he turns left, right, right, left again, following the visitor\u2019s clipped commands. His feet ache and his muscles are eating themselves. He\u2019s tired, so tired that the bed in his cell would feel like heaven instead of hell.\n \u201cStop at the corner,\u201d the voice orders. \u201cGet low.\u201d\n He throws himself down and watches as two guards barrel past him, lamprey tubes bobbing. One of them gives an electric bark: prisoner 8403 unaccounted for, the destroyer is loose. Pilo\u2019s heart thumps hard. His tongue flicks at the dried blood above his lip. He wonders what the beatings will be like if they catch him.\n \u201cAlmost there,\u201d the visitor says. \u201cLeft again.\u201d\n Pilo takes two tries to get up off the floor, then staggers onward. He is certain the guards have turned around, certain he can hear their footfalls converging on him. The corridor narrows, branches a final time, and ends. The visitor has betrayed him. He\u2019s been led to a corner and left for dead.\n Then he sees the stump of a maintenance ladder hanging down from the shadows. He limps to the base, leans against the rungs to catch his breath. When he looks up, he sees nothing but blackness.\n \u201cThey\u2019re coming, Pi,\u201d says the voice. \u201cYou have to start climbing.\u201d\n Pilo pushes his forehead against the ladder. Gasps in. Out.\n \u201cGo up, Pi. You have to go up.\u201d\n He takes another ragged breath. He pictures all the cells moving through the dark, all the prisoners and guards wearing his face. The prison is well made, but he knows what it is, now. The thought has been building and building in the back of his skull.\n \u201cThis is all a sim,\u201d he says hoarsely. \u201cA deepsim.\u201d\n For a moment there\u2019s no reply, and he thinks maybe the channel is one-way only. Then he hears a snort of static.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d the visitor says. \u201cBig twist. But those guards are still going to tune the shit out of you, and it\u2019s going to feel very real.\u201d\n One dread mixes with another in Pilo\u2019s simulated stomach. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t be escaping at all. Maybe he was put in that cell for a good reason. He is, after all, the destroyer.\n \u201cCome on, Pi.\u201d\n The voice is harsh and pleading at the same time, and he finally recognizes it, one realization unlocked by another. Her name sails to him across a void. He falters for a moment, frightened he might be wrong. His jaw works.\n \u201cKess?\u201d he asks.\n Her voice thickens. \u201cYeah. Yes. Now climb, for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d\n He steps onto the first metal rung.\n Pilo is a carcass. His limbs tremble; his head lolls with exhaustion. His hands gave out a dozen rungs ago, grip strength sapped to nothing, so he has to use his elbows, hooking them around each bar. It\u2019s slow. Agonizing. The sound of the guards is gone for now, but he has Kess in his ear, urging him along.\n The higher he climbs, the more he remembers about her. It begins with her face, the one he saw so briefly during the visitation, bright black eyes and high forehead. He sees it now from a variety of angles. Shifting haircuts, creeping tattoos, a hundred different expressions but most often a wide grin he knows was the precursor to a wild warbling laugh. Her voice has no trace of a smile in it now.\n He pauses on the ladder to catch his breath but ends up wasting more of it on a question. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cAre we friends?\u201d\n \u201cWe were friends.\u201d\n Pilo remembers a tangle of twisting corridors, walls and ceilings swathed in moss, hydroponic gardens above and rusty maintenance tunnels below. A party with no gravity, chasing trembly globes of grain alcohol through the air. Bubble-shaped habs with soft warm beds. Viewports to a starry void.\n \u201cColony ship,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Germinal.\u201d\n \u201cThe Big Germ. Yeah.\u201d\n But he knows that\u2019s not Kess\u2019 nickname for it. Someone else calls the ship that, someone who is only a blur in his peripherals. Nearly every memory he has of him and Kess has a third person in it, too. Faceless, ghostly, hard to look at. Like the guards and their aggressive textile.\n \u201cWhy was I put in here?\u201d he asks, because he doesn\u2019t want to ask about the third person.\n Her voice tightens, and now he can picture her face doing the same. \u201cYou know that better than I do.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m a criminal,\u201d Pilo says, with a numb familiarity. \u201cA bad one. The guards, you know, when they think I\u2019m not listening\u2014they call me the destroyer.\u201d\n \u201cVery dramatic,\u201d Kess says. \u201cWe\u2019re all destroyers, Pi. We\u2019re all damaging each other at all times.\u201d\n \u201cNo. What I did\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re all each other\u2019s entropy.\u201d Kess\u2019 voice is flat. Heavy. \u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t special, Pi. It was fucked up, but it wasn\u2019t special.\u201d\n Pilo feels a dart of dread and excitement mingled. \u201cYou know what I did?\u201d\n \u201cSo do you,\u201d Kess says. \u201cYou just buried it in this fucked-up place.\u201d\n Pilo senses it then, a memory-as-predator, a dark gray shape circling below him. \u201cThey also call me a fecal stain,\u201d he says. \u201cThe guards. That one maybe suits better.\u201d\n He gathers his strength and starts climbing again, moving away from the labyrinth but also from the predator.\n Kess puffs a small laugh, just a ghost of the one he remembers. \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting me like that. Kess is all love today.\u201d\n Pilo\u2019s next reach feels wrong. Suddenly he is clinging to the rungs to stop from plummeting, headfirst, toward the hatch that used to be above him. His gut floats outside his pericardium. Fluids circle in his inner ear, chasing each other like snapping dogs.\n Nograv. It\u2019s been a long time since he was in nograv.\n \u201cYou hit the edge of the Newt field,\u201d Kess says. \u201cNice and light from here to outside.\u201d\n Pilo feels a shiver through his sternum, feels his heartbeat accelerate. He always knew, vaguely, that this was a prison ship. But going outside means going onto the hull. And if there is one place he should not go, should never go, it is the hull.\n Pilo hears electric bellows echo up from below.\n \u201cGuards found the ladder,\u201d Kess says. \u201cHurry up.\u201d\n Pilo\u2019s mouth opens and shuts. He tries to think of a way to explain to Kess, whose birthday is exactly one month before his, whose dark eyes peer out from a cloud of freckles, why he should not go to the hull. Why even the idea of it fills his empty belly with chunks of ice.\n But he doesn\u2019t know, so he resumes his climb, hand over hand, weightless as a spider.\n There is an antechamber at the end of the ladder, a small red-lit bulb where he sheds the guard\u2019s aggressive textile and dons a bright orange hullsuit instead. There is something horribly familiar about it. When the fabric shell slithers and tightens, adjusting to his dimensions, he feels a brief spike of panic.\n But if he doesn\u2019t go to the hull, he\u2019ll end up dragged back to the cell. Back to the four black glass walls, back to eating gritty paste from a nozzle, back to the beatings and inspections. He puts on the helmet; it seals with a smell like burning plastic.\n For a moment he\u2019s blind. Then the filtration system hums to life and whisks the fog of his breath away. The hud shows him his oxygen full, his suit intact.\n \u201cI\u2019m waiting outside, Pi.\u201d Kess\u2019 voice echoes in his helmet. \u201cGo time.\u201d\n Pilo\u2019s feet are frozen. Kess is not the only thing waiting for him on the other side of the airlock. He can feel the memory-predator lurking out there, too, filing its teeth. If he goes onto the hull, something very bad is going to happen.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, through a tightening throat. \u201cIf this is a deepsim, and you\u2019re in the code, why can\u2019t you just turn it off?\u201d\n \u201cBecause some clever prick loaded it with fail-safes,\u201d Kess says. \u201cThe only way out is through.\u201d\n Pilo can hear thumping and shouting through the vestibule door. The guards have reached the top of the ladder, guards who all have his face.\n \u201cI programmed it, then,\u201d he says, with a sick feeling of inevitability. \u201cI put myself in here.\u201d\n A clang on the door. The guards have caught up.\n \u201cNow or never, now,\u201d Kess says. \u201cI did a lot of fucking work to rig this up, so respect my craft, will you?\u201d\n Pilo reaches for the airlock.\n The pursuit is slow motion; it would be comical if Pilo were not exhausted and terrified. The hullsuit hud shows a swarm of moving red blots, and through his faceplate he sees them as guards coming from every direction, crawling not just from the airlock but from hidden crevices all across the hull of the prison ship. The biomechanical insects are detached from their hosts, skittering on their own skeletal legs.\n They don\u2019t want to let him go.\n \u201cNearly there,\u201d Kess mutters. \u201cNearly, nearly.\u201d\n He\u2019s heading for the engines, all the way aft, where Kess said she is waiting for him. His breath is a ragged ghost, rattling through the helmet filter. He knows he should be breathing in slow even sips, knows he simmed a hullwalk or something like it in another life, but his lungs are singularities. His heart is a hummingbird.\n He\u2019s been in the cell too long. The deepsim has rules, and it\u2019s harder to bend them now that he knows he wrote them. The rules say his body has wasted away, fed on itself. He can feel it with every trembling step, but he can\u2019t stop because his jailers are converging now, making him adjust course over and over.\n Pilo waves his arm in the void, focused on the nearest guard, but the guard only speeds up, snarling through his faceplate. The marionette trick won\u2019t work again. Waste of a second, waste of a calorie. Pilo redoubles his efforts. Drives his aching knee upward, feels the clack of the magnetics releasing, pitches forward, sets his boot, feels the clack of the magnetics taking hold\u2014\n Blood thrums through his neck. Pulses behind his eyes, which he keeps pointed down, never up, both to be sure of his footing and to avoid looking into the endless black. The guards and the bugs aren\u2019t the only things chasing him. He can feel the predatory memory out there, circling, circling.\n \u201cYou\u2019re there, Pi. You see me?\u201d\n Pilo feels the rumble of the prison ship\u2019s engine under his feet. He blinks the stinging sheet of sweat from his eyes, searches for a shuttle suckered to the hull.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he says, with panic mounting his chest, crushing his ribs. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n \u201cLook up,\u201d Kess says.\n Pilo does not want to look up, but he does it. When he cranes his head back, when he sees the thicket of ice and dust, lit an eerie yellow by the dregs of some distant supernova, his heart almost stops.\n The predatory memory crashes through his skull.\n \u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it,\u201d says Rhetta.\n The three of them are huddled around the viewport, looking down\u2014or up, or sideways; they\u2019re in nograv\u2014at a massive helical shard of ice and dust. Pilo\u2019s optic nerve is still throwing spots, from too much time in sim, but the tiny explosions of shimmering color only add to the ethereality.\n Rhetta is right, as usual. The comet was worth seeing live.\n \u201cFucking payload, is what it is,\u201d says Kess, emphatic on the curse just so Rhetta will make a face. \u201cThink of all that water.\u201d She offers Pilo a fist. \u201cAnd Pi\u2019s going to harpoon us right onto it.\u201d\n Pilo knocks fists, smiles, but Rhetta somehow detects the churn in his belly.\n \u201cHow\u2019s the program coming?\u201d she asks. \u201cStill killing Kess\u2019 bugs?\u201d\n During his brief snatches of sleep, Pilo has been having nightmares about enormous biomechanical insects. His subconscious could stand to be more subtle.\n \u201cIt\u2019ll be ready by contact,\u201d he says. \u201cI should get back in there.\u201d\n Pilo knows no colony ship is truly self-sustaining, no matter how precise its recycling of gas and matter. Entropy is always gnawing at the edges, poking its fingers through the gaps, and there are always unforeseen disasters: micrometeorites, reactor failures, blight in the hydroponic gardens.\n Pilo knows that the Germinal has been limping for decades now, and that the comet is a gift they can\u2019t afford to waste. The thought pounds at his temples as he works, as hours meet hours, as his fingers begin to twitch and cramp on the phantom data-pad.\n Kess did the best she could with the corrupted base program, but it\u2019s still teeming with error potential. He seals one gap and another opens. Even with the sim-to-real time exponential maxed out, with every minute outside an hour in here, they\u2019ll barely make the launch window.\n When he finally emerges from the simpod, Rhetta is waiting with the green tea he asked for. \u201cKill count?\u201d she asks, holding out the cup.\n \u201cEight-thousand, four-hundred and two,\u201d Pilo says. \u201cWhich leaves one. The worst one.\u201d\n \u201cThe grapple trigger,\u201d Rhetta guesses. \u201cKess said it was a real cuss, cuss, extra cuss.\u201d\n Pilo takes the tea. \u201cIt\u2019s ancient. Won\u2019t talk to anything else. We haven\u2019t chunked a moving comet in about a century, and we saw this one so late\u2014\u201d He breaks off, blinks at Rhetta from across the steaming crater of his cup. \u201cSimming it, the grapple works seventy-eight percent of the time. Not nearly high enough when we only get one attempt.\u201d He inhales. \u201cBut there\u2019s a physical trigger, too.\u201d\n Rhetta looks at him for a long moment, then the wrinkles slacken around her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll ride it down.\u201d\n Pilo gives a hoarse laugh. \u201cThe physical trigger\u2019s fully exposed, you\u2019d be in a hullsuit and tether\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDone hullwork since before you were born, Pilo.\u201d\n \u201cThis is different. I can\u2019t ask you to do this.\u201d\n \u201cSo don\u2019t. I\u2019ll just cussing do it.\u201d\n Pilo watches through electric eyes as the harpoon makes its approach. The engineers put it together from scrap, bits of the Germinal slagged and reprinted as metal shell, drift-engine, spike-toothed grapple. There is a tiny bright orange spot against the pig-iron gray, a single exposed hand poking out from the hutch the engineers soldered at the last possible moment.\n The ship took census; Rhetta\u2019s request to babysit the trigger was approved, but not by everybody. Pilo can feel Kess beside him in the simpod. He can almost feel the stiff anger in her limbs, feel it radiating off her, heating the neuroconduction fluid.\n The harpoon\u2019s engine flares pale blue, a final burn to match velocity. This is not a sim. Pilo has to remind himself of that, over and over. This is not a rehearsal. This is the show.\n This is the show, and the grapple\u2019s not deploying. Pilo prays to an amoral universe. The grapple continues not deploying. They are in the twenty-two percent, and now Rhetta realizes that, realizes it\u2019s her line. Pilo watches her crawl, slowly, cautiously, out from the hutch. The engineers placed as near the trigger as possible. She only has to move three meters. Pilo\u2019s adrenaline sections them to millimeters.\n One eternity goes by. Then another. Then he sees the minute motion, a gloved hand gripping and twisting, and the grapple deploys.\n It burrows into the ice, hooking deep. Pilo feels a flood of triumph, of relief, of gratefulness, just before a jagged shard of frozen water comes loose, at an angle the sim never accounted for, and slices the arm of the bright orange hullsuit open.\n Entropy finds the gap, and inside the simpod Pilo can\u2019t stop screaming Rhetta\u2019s name.\n \u201cYou remember, now.\u201d\n Kess\u2019 voice rocks him back to reality, or unreality. Back to the layer of consciousness cocooned in what was meant to be a therapy sim, before he twisted it beyond all recognition and locked the door behind him. Back to the punishment he devised for himself when nobody else would do it.\n He is standing on the hull of the prison ship, boots magnetized to metal. The guards have circled up around him, penning him in. None of it is real. None of it matters. Only Rhetta matters: every time he blinks his eyes he sees her writhing, sees frost creeping across the inside of her faceplate.\n His fault. His fault. His fault.\n \u201cIt should\u2019ve been me,\u201d he rasps.\n \u201cYeah. People always say that, Pi.\u201d\n Pilo feels his simulated lungs heaving, head spinning. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should have been me. I was simming it from almost the start. I knew the physical trigger was the better option, so I was simming the crawl, the placement, there was no time to rig something else\u2014\u201d He sinks to a crouch, the void crushing down at him from all angles. \u201cI was so fucking scared. And I knew all I had to do was mention it, all I had to do was ask Rhetta to bring me tea\u2014because that\u2019s how she is. How she was.\u201d\n \u201cI know, Pi.\u201d Kess\u2019 voice is brittle flint. \u201cYou told us this. We told you to do your fucking therapy. And instead, you sealed yourself in the simpod and turned it into some good old-fashioned self-flagellation. Took me three months to find my way in.\u201d\n \u201cWhy did you?\u201d Pilo chokes. \u201cWhat you wrote on the wall\u2014you know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t want to, at first. I thought, you know, your choice.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd I was angry. I still am so fucking angry. But it\u2019s not doing me any good.\u201d\n Pilo pictures his body in the simpod, maybe hauled all the way to triage to monitor his vitals, to hook an intravenous to his trembling arm. He remembers he was intending to die in here.\n \u201cI should go back,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cBack to the cell.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Kess snaps the word. \u201cNot a chance. Not after I did all this work.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re part of it,\u201d Pilo says. \u201cYou must be. Part of the punishment. Getting me so close to escaping, then making me remember\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t make you remember shit. Your brain did.\u201d Kess\u2019 voice trembles. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends right now, Pi. We won\u2019t be for a long time. Maybe forever. We\u2019re not going to hug and cry when you wake up. But I need you out here anyway. The ship needs you.\u201d\n Vibrations move through his boots as the guards creep closer. Pilo sees his own face in all directions, sneering, jaundiced by the helmets\u2019 yellow faceplates. Their boots clack and shiver. He can see their lips moving and hear the words in his head: you careless butcher, you fecal stain, you coward, you destroyer.\n \u201cI don\u2019t deserve that yet,\u201d Pilo says. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve to be out there.\u201d\n \u201cNobody deserves anything,\u201d Kess says. \u201cHiding here torturing yourself isn\u2019t helping Rhetta\u2019s family, or me, or anyone else on the Germ. Trust me.\u201d Her voice cracks. \u201cJust fucking trust me, Pi. For once.\u201d\n Pilo\u2019s chest aches. \u201cI trust you,\u201d he says. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d\n \u201cJump.\u201d\n \u201cInto the comet?\u201d Pilo asks in a sob, knowing what he will see there, knowing he will find Rhetta\u2019s writhing body, her open mouth growing ice.\n \u201cThrough the comet,\u201d Kess says.\n Impossible. He\u2019ll be impaled on a frozen spar, crushed in the shifting floes. The deepsim has rules, all sims have rules\u2014\n \u201cJust cussing do it.\u201d\n Pilo inhales. Exhales. He remembers a younger Rhetta slithering into her hullsuit, adjusting the baggy orange textile. Eyes bright, alert. Routine maintenance, but eager for it anyway, eager to get out of the Big Germ for a little while and see the stars.\n He crouches down and demagnetizes his boots. Then, with his last shred of strength, he kicks off the hull. The guard-selves reach for him, wailing, suddenly panicked. The bugs gnash their lamprey teeth. He leaps through a dozen grasping hands, past a dozen metallic mouths, and floats free.\n He glides toward the comet, and the comet pulls him in. Suddenly he\u2019s accelerating, plunging downward, upward. He shuts his eyes tight, feels a cloud of frozen particulate wash across him, precursor to the drifting chunks that can tear him apart, and then\u2014\n Stillness.\n Pilo has to squint, even through his auto-dimmed faceplate. He is drifting in empty space, no ice, no dust, no comet. He has an unimpeded view of the supernova. There\u2019s a figure silhouetted against it, waiting in the middle of the ruined star.\n Kess reaches out her hand.\n Pilo\u2019s long quiet is interrupted by the electric bleat of his heart monitor, by the gurgle of his simpod draining. He opens his eyes.\n Rich Larson (Ymir, Tomorrow Factory) was born in Galmi, Niger, has lived in Spain and Czech Republic, and is currently based in Grande Prairie, Canada.

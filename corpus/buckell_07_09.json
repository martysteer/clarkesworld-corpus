On the very edge, past the vendors on the cobblestone sea walk, Tiago would sit with his legs over the rocky sea wall and look out over the harbor.\nToday he only detoured through the plaza to throw the crowd in between him and the woman chasing him.\nHe\u2019d gotten a brief glimpse of her before the running started: tall, dark eyes, dark skin, dark leather jacket and microfibre pants, careful dreadlocks pulled back into a pony tail.\nShe was fast in the crowd. She wasn\u2019t dodging around legs, using the ebb and flow of the masses to see open routes like Tiago. No, people who got in her way were just . . . thrown out of the way.\nToo strong. She was some sort of soldier, Tiago thought, refocusing ahead.\nHe might have gotten himself into a bit of a situation.\nSlipping onto the seawall path, he sprinted harder, deciding that she was covering the gap in the crowd. To his right the harbor was filled with ships and their cargo, anchored and waiting for a spot to clear on the docks. One of them was throwing out a parasail, the windfoil bucking in the inconsistent harbor wind, but then filling out, rising up into the air hundreds of feet overhead, and then some.\nThe ship began to pick its way out of the harbor, headed between the tall forest of wind turbines at the harbor\u2019s edge: a dangerous move to unleash a windfoil in the harbor, but suddenly Tiago noticed other ships unfurling sails in haste. A cloud of brightly colored parafoils leapt to the harbor sky like butterflies swarming from a shaken limb.\nThis was worrying enough that Tiago slowed, somewhat, and looked to his left. The warehouses, three and four stories tall, dominated the first row of buildings. But behind them, climbing tenaciously up the side of the mountain, homes and houses colorfully dotted the slopes.\nA large, dark mass of gray haze topped the rocky crest and slowly fell down toward the harbor like a heavy cloud.\n\u201cOh shit.\u201d Tiago stopped. People in the Plaza were turning too, and murmuring started to spread. They stood up from picnics or meals and the edges of the crowd were already leaving.\nThe woman smacked into Tiago and grabbed his upper arm.\n\u201cTake your damn money,\u201d Tiago shouted. I don\u2019t want it. I\u2019m sorry. Just let me go.\u201d\nShe looked puzzled as he shoved the paper money into the pockets of her jacket. He may have even given her more than he\u2019d stolen, he wasn\u2019t sure.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s . . . \u201c\nTiago pointed up the mountain. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rain.\u201d\nShe looked over the buildings and let him go. \u201cI forgot.\u201d\nForgot? There were two things on the island to remember: stay out of the rain, and avoid the Doacq\u2019s attention by staying inside at night.\nHe bolted. The last thing he saw was the armada of harbor ships, parafoils all full overhead, pulling their hulls up onto their hydrofoil skids as they all scattered to get well clear of the island.\nThen the sirens began to wail all throughout Placa del Fuego, alerting its citizens to the descending danger.\nFrom the open sweep of the docks and seawall of the harbor, Tiago headed into the heart of Harbortown. He could breathe easier seeing overhangs above him, and walls he could put his back to.\nPeople hurried about with carbon-fiber or steel umbrellas. Some had already gotten into their hazmat gear.\nThe klaxons wailed in the background, constantly blearing out their call for all to find shelter. Shops slammed thick windows shut and bolted them, while people yanked tables and chairs and billboards inside. Customers packed in, shoulder to shoulder.\nNo self respecting shop would let Tiago inside: he was an urchin. His clothes were ripped and melted, his face dirty, and he ran on bare feet.\nThey\u2019d toss him out on his ass faster than he could get inside.\nA faint stinging mist started to fill the air. Tiago squinted and slowed down. The unfamiliar would run faster, but then they\u2019d inhale more. He cupped his hands over his mouth, a piece of flannel in between his fingers to filter the air. He looked down at the cobblestoned street to protect his eyes.\nHis calloused, flattened feet knew the street. Knew how many steps it would take to reach the alley, knew how many times he\u2019d have to pull himself up on the old pipe running outside to get up onto the roof, and how many more steps across the concrete to get to his niche.\nIt was a spot between two old storage buildings a few streets back from the waterfront, almost near the Xeno-town enclave. One of them had a large, reinforced concrete gutter along its edge, and when the second building had been built right along side, wall to wall, had left a sheltered ledge the length of the building.\nYou wouldn\u2019t know it to look at it. Twenty street kids had taken bricks and concrete and built a wall along the overhang, blending it into the architecture. It was behind this that Tiago had his very own room.\nTo get to it, he stepped out over the edge of the building, and behind the wall.\nSafe.\nHis skin stung from contact with the mist, but he could sit in the entryway along the corridor leading down to the seven foot by four foot concrete cubicles they called home, and watch the rain.\nIt was a floating, frothy jelly, spit out from the trees on the island into the air, that slowly floated down. In most cases it just slowly burned at whatever it landed on, like some sort of an acid.\nBut after that, all it took was a spark for it to ignite.\nIn the distance the harbor pumps thrummed to life. All over the city the engineers were fighting back the rain with a mist of their own, taken from the harbor water to coat and rinse the harbor.\nUsually being on this side of the mountain protected them. But sometimes the wind changed. Sometimes the fire forests were unusually active.\nEither way, you didn\u2019t want to be outside. The burns and scars on the children huddled around the openings of their sanctuary testified to that.\nThe steady rain continued, sizzling as it hit the ground outside.\nTiago relaxed in the quiet among his neighbors as the city fought the rain. He could worry about explaining to Kay why he was coming back with no money from the morning\u2019s work later, as much as that scared him. For now, he was just happy to be out of the rain.\nHe just about leapt out of skin as the wall next to him crumpled and the woman who\u2019d been chasing him shoved her way through and crouched in front of him.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have business to finish.\u201d\nTiago jumped up to run and the other kids moved back away from him.\nBut where could he go with the rain coming down so hard?\nHe looked back at his pursuer. The rain had eaten away at the skin on her forearms, exposing silvery metal underneath. Metal pistons snicked as she flexed her fingers.\nA cyborg. Here on Placa del Fuego.\nImpossible.\nThere was no advanced machinery on Placa del Fuego. It all failed on the island, until one reached three miles offshore. In Harbortown the sailors said scientists from other worlds clustered aboard large ships near the wormholes, monitoring what islanders called the deadzone and they called \u2018an unexplained continuous EMP event.\u2019 They claimed the epicenter was somewhere deep under the crust of the planet, right under Placa del Fuego.\nThe wormholes that lead from the ocean around Placa del Fuego to the oceans of other worlds light years away were anchored in the water just on the edge of the deadzone, and the scientists were there to order the wormholes moved as the deadzone expanded slightly each month.\nOne street rumor said that one of the alien races had buried a device under the island, intending to use it as a cover for a last stand during the human war for independence. Some said it was the Doacq that bought the deadzone with it.\nIt didn\u2019t matter what or who caused it. The end effect was that the town used pneumatic tubes to send messages. Ox-men from Okur pulled rickshaws around, or people used the compressed air powered trolley cars. Everything ran on compressed air: the town\u2019s reservoirs were filled by the myriad wind turbines that festooned the harbor entrance and the exposed ridges of the mountain.\nBut because of the deadzone, this woman shouldn\u2019t have been here, Tiago thought. She shouldn\u2019t even work. But in the cramped darkness of his room the cyborg woman squatted on Tiago\u2019s hand-carved wooden stool.\nAs Tiago turned on a bright white LED lamp she counted off a lot more money than he\u2019d stolen, or given back to her. Bill after bill after bill. A massive fistful. A month\u2019s takings.\nIt hovered between them.\n\u201cBefore you tagged me and made the pick,\u201d she said, \u201cyou seemed to know your way around the harbor. I need someone like you.\u201d\nTiago took a deep breath. He wasn\u2019t sure if he needed someone like her.\nShe was trouble.\nThe hesitation must have been obvious to her. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll double what you want.\u201d\nWhat was the alternative? Tiago took the money. He\u2019d be a fool not to.\n\u201cWhat are you looking to do?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI need to find the person at the top of the underground. Who sees all and knows all.\u201d The cyborg shifted, and the stool creaked. Tiago grimaced. It was made of imported wood, and it was his most precious possession. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Kay.\u201d\n\u201cKay?\u201d Tiago feigned confusion.\n\u201cYou know who I\u2019m talking about,\u201d the woman smiled.\nHe did. He wasn\u2019t very good at lying straight-faced. He swallowed nervously. \u201cWhat do you need from her?\u201d\n\u201cI need Kay\u2019s help.\u201d Tiago waited for more, and the cyborg continued. \u201cTo find my grandfather. How do I find this person?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t find Kay,\u201d Tiago said. He folded the money away into the depths of his ragged clothes. \u201cShe finds you. Go find yourself a nice room along the waterfront somewhere. Kay will show up now that someone knows you\u2019re trying to find her. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d\n\u201cWord on the street.\u201d The woman leaned forward and held out her hand. A card rested in her palm. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you the other half when I meet Kay. Come find me tomorrow at noon.\u201d\nTiago took the card. An address had been scribbled onto it. \u201cWhat is your name, then?\u201d\n\u201cNashara.\u201d\nNashara. A cyborg called Nashara. The Nashara? Was he really talking to a living, breathing legend?\nTiago\u2019s hands shook.\nShe was a lot more than just trouble.\nHe\u2019d gotten himself in way, way deep into something.\nNashara, left, walking out in to the sizzling rain like it was no more than an inconvenience.\nIt was only a moment before Tiago\u2019s neighbors parted and the tiny figure of Kay walked out. Her grey eyes took in the broken brick with a flick before she turned to face him. Her hair was cut just short of her ears, almost boyish. She was shorter than Tiago, something that always surprised him. In his own mind she stood much taller. \u201cI\u2019ll have it repaired,\u201d she said calmly, flicking her head at the destruction.\nKay\u2019s fixing the damage would obligate them to her.\nBut no one said anything. Refusing it would be an even bigger problem.\nThey might come to beat him up tonight, Tiago thought. If they weren\u2019t too scared.\n\u201cYou were here the whole time?\u201d Tiago asked, his voice cracking slightly with fear.\nKay ignored his surprise. \u201cThat was a Nashara. Here on the island. I wonder how she\u2019s able to work here?\u201d Ox-men: two large slabs of hairy muscle, large eyes and flat noses, squeezed into the passageway behind her, stooping over to fit. They regarded Tiago with dull, incurious eyes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . \u201d Tiago muttered.\nKay unpacked a Kevlar poncho and pulled it carefully on. She buckled on a gas mask. Behind her, the two Ox-men did the same.\nIn a muffled voice she told Tiago, \u201cDo you know how expensive it would be to shield someone like her, a cyborg, to be able to function in the deadzone? That must be what she\u2019s done. It means she has access to . . . incredible resources.\u201d She paused thoughtfully, thinking about that. Then she continued. \u201cI have preparations to make before I\u2019ll meet her. Keep your appointment. I\u2019ll send someone for you both.\u201d\nShe stepped out into the rain, and the Ox-men followed her. The three of them disappeared over the side of the building in the haze, and Tiago turned around to face the boys trying to hide in the shadows.\nHe could tell by the fear on their faces that they would not be bothering him.\nThey were far, far too scared of Kay.\nSo was he.\nNashara sat at a table outside a seawall restaurant, surveying the Plaza over a cup of tea. A few small fires had broken out the night before where jellied rain had landed on canopies or abandoned stalls. But considering the strength of last night\u2019s storm, it wasn\u2019t too bad, Tiago thought. He\u2019d certainly seen worse.\nHis new benefactor motioned Tiago to sit with her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd,\u201d she muttered as he sat. \u201cAll this stone, brick, slate. Leather for clothes. No wood, no fabrics. Hardly any trees, not even scrub. Grim.\u201d\nTiago looked down at his patched clothes. She was surprisingly ignorant about the island if she was the real Nashara. The real Nashara had cloned her own mind to infect alien starships in the fight for human independence. The real Nashara was a founder of the Xenowealth. The real Nashara was a force of nature. That Nashara, it seemed to Tiago, would, at least know about stuff here on the island. \u201cRich people have them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those glass houses.\u201d\n\u201cGreenhouses?\u201d\nTiago shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d\nSometimes, in the quieter moments, looking out over the harbor, he\u2019d wondered what the places were like out over the horizon, and through the wormhole the ships sailed through to get to the oceans of other worlds, and through wormholes in those oceans to even more. Other worlds where things were made, and then transported here. Where people like Nashara came from.\nBut it was useless to daydream too much about where the ships went. Because they weren\u2019t taking Tiago along with them. No matter how much he wished for it whenever he sat on the sea wall.\nNashara set her tiny wooden cup down and stood up. \u201cI think Kay will be receiving us now.\u201d\nTiago turned around, and the two Ox-men he\u2019d seen last night had silently, amazingly for their bulk, walked up right behind him.\nThey didn\u2019t have to say anything, they turned around and began to walk away. Nashara followed.\nAnd that, he thought, was the end of that.\nOnly it wasn\u2019t.\nUp at the end of Onyx street, down the stairs cut into the side of the road and in the basement of an old house tunneled into a rock outcropping at the very edge of town, was one of Kay\u2019s many lairs.\nHe\u2019d been summoned there, two days later.\nAmber late-afternoon light pierced the dusty windows, and a menagerie of Placa del Fuego\u2019s shadowy denizens milled about. There were more Ox-men, some Runners, and even a few simple-minded Servants. Lots of grubby kids like Tiago, many of them faces he recognized from Elizan\u2019s crew crowded in, as well as others from all over the rest of the city. They were Kay\u2019s crew, now, all of them. She owned the Waterfront and the Back Ring, and was almost done finishing up controlling the Harbor.\nIf it was criminal, and happened in Placa del Fuego, Kay wanted to run it.\nIt had been different, last year. Last year Tiago worked for Elizan; a high strung old man who would leap at a chance to whip anyone who\u2019d held back the take.\nA tough life: Tiago still had misshapen broken bones to prove it, but it beat trying to live outside alone. Something he\u2019d learned quickly enough.\nPlaca del Fuego had no heart for the homeless.\nWhen Kay appeared on the streets in the Back Ring, rain-burned and tired, she\u2019d been ignored. For the first week. The second week she\u2019d figured out the command structure of one of the drug cartels and executed the commander with a sliver of knapped flint.\nWithin days the cartel danced to her tune.\nRumors said she came from Okur, where the birdlike alien Nesaru had established a colony. Under the Bacigalupi Doctrine, anticipating the lack of fuel and the collapse of the interstellar travel after the war for independence, the Nesaru had bred humans into a variety of forms to serve them. Nesaru engineered, bred, and reshaped human Ox-men and Runners had fled Okur to Placa del Fuego. So had Kay.\nShe was something else, Okur refugees said. Something designed to control the modified human slaves under the Nesaru\u2019s thumb. She could read your thoughts by the slightest change in your posture, a twitch in a facial muscle. She emitted pheromones to calm you, convince you, and used her body to control your personal space.\nYou were a computer, waiting to be programmed. She was your taskmaster. A perfect, bred, engineered, manipulator of humankind.\n\u201cTiago,\u201d Kay said, beckoning him closer. \u201cNashara and I have quite a job for you.\u201d\nNashara stepped out from behind a thick stone pillar. \u201cThere will be considerably more money in it for you.\u201d\nKay put a protective arm around Tiago. \u201cI really need your help with this, Tiago.\u201d\nHe stiffened slightly as she moved in closer, creating a tiny world between just the three of them. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked, hesitant.\n\u201cYou keep a low profile, Tiago. Back of the crowd. You don\u2019t try to cheat me of my cut. You wouldn\u2019t even dare think of it.\u201d\nTiago nodded. Don\u2019t get noticed. Don\u2019t cross dangerous people like Kay unless you could run. Melt into the background. These were core life principles of his. It was why he made a good pickpocket. There was even a mid-sized bounty available for his capture.\n\u201cMore importantly, you\u2019ve been in the Dekkan Holding Center,\u201d Nashara said. In the distant background the sound of rain alarms drifted through the streets. A night storm. The worst kind.\nA cold chill gripped Tiago. \u201cYou want me to go back to The Center?\u201d Images of the dark warrens flitted back to the front of his mind.\n\u201cNot as such.\u201d Kay pointed a Kevlar poncho and gas mask hanging by the door. \u201cSuit up.\u201d\nThey walked through the slowly darkening streets, the rain hissing against their protective gear. Nashara wore goggles and a long leather fisherman\u2019s coat that seemed impervious to the rain, Kay the same outfit as Tiago.\nTheir footsteps clicked against cobblestone as Kay led them through sidealleys and tiny backstreets so cramped they had to move through them single file.\nNo one else was out.\nTiago stopped a tremble in his hands at the thought of being out at night.\nSeveral times they came to dead ends, where small locked doors stopped Kay\u2019s progress. But a few knocks in a pattern and they would open, and the trio would tromp through someone\u2019s front room, leaving sizzling drops of rain behind.\nThere was no hurry, and Tiago gauged that they\u2019d moved across the entire city over the last two hours.\nKay finally stopped and removed her gas mask in the quiet foyer of a restaurant, eerie in its empty state, though the tables were all set and ready: waiting for the morning crowd. She looked right at Tiago as he removed his mask. He burned his fingers on the wet straps as she said, \u201cI\u2019m turning you over to the warden of the DHC for the bounty. The driver of the prison wagon has been paid to suggest stopping to pick you up.\u201d\nHe felt numb. Outside, Tiago saw through the windows, the rain had fallen to a drizzle. The gaslight streetlamps flickered shadows as the wind flicked their flames this way and that.\n\u201cSo you do want me back in the hellhole,\u201d he said, the misery leaking out into his voice.\nKay pulled out a packet of photos and spread them with a flourish across a nearby table like a card dealer. \u201cNo. You\u2019ll get picked up, but there\u2019s someone inside the wagon that Nashara wants.\u201d\nTiago frowned. Kay was helping Nashara why? He couldn\u2019t quite put together what was happening here.\nKay leaned close. She was doing it, creating that little bubble of space that seemed to exist just between the two of them. It was some sort of talent, almost magical. \u201cDon\u2019t try to figure it out, Tiago. Just take a look at the pictures of the crew of the Zephyr III. One of them will be in the wagon. We need your help.\u201d\nHe looked up and out of the bay windows. He wondered how far he could get if just ran. He had some money, maybe he could stowaway on a boat.\nHow long could he evade Kay?\nNot very long.\nShe gently grabbed his jaw to point his gaze back down at the table. She\u2019d read his thoughts via his body language. \u201cThere\u2019s no running, Tiago. Not now.\u201d\nHe swallowed and committed the faces before him to memory, something other than fear building as she put a hand on his back to steady him.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there as well,\u201d Nashara said from by the door. She\u2019d opened her coat up, and underneath Tiago saw more guns lining the inside than he\u2019d even known a single person could carry. She was a walking arsenal. You rarely saw any guns on the island, too expensive, even for criminals.\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you just break into the wagon and get the person you want?\u201d Tiago asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to tip my hand until we know we have the person we want. Otherwise, if we go in too early guns blazing on the wrong wagon, our guy could get hidden further, or put under tougher security. So you\u2019re our scout, Tiago. When you give us the go ahead, we move in to recover both of you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if the person isn\u2019t there, I get beaten, interrogated, and locked up.\u201d\n\u201cWe will get you out quickly if that happens, we can bribe a few judges, and Nashara is ready to pay you well,\u201d Kay said. She was pulling on her poncho. Before she snapped on the bug-like gasmask, she continued. \u201cI have to go meet the wagon. I\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d\nThis was his moment to bolt.\nNashara picked up the pictures of the crew. \u201cThree weeks ago. You remember anything strange happening?\u201d\nTiago stopped thinking about other lives and worlds. \u201cThere was a fight. At night. All over the town. Whoever it was burst through walls, fell through roofs. Ripped up road. No one saw much of it. We just saw the damage . . . \u201c\n\u201cIt was my grandfather: Pepper was on his way back with information about a new threat to the Xenowealth worlds. He disappeared here, last seen getting aboard the Zephyr III. But the Zephyr was destroyed in a limited yield nuclear blast event nowhere near any of the wormholes out, but a hundred miles north of here in the polar ocean.\n\u201cWord is that one survivor from the Zephyr III came back. You\u2019re going to help me acquire him. I came with a ship, it\u2019s pretty heavily armed up: the Streuner. Pepper didn\u2019t have backup, I\u2019m not making the same mistake. Once we\u2019re on the ship, it\u2019s a run for the wormhole, back into the heart of the Xenowealth, for debriefing.\u201d\nAcquire him. There was a strange turn of a word, Tiago thought. She was a kindred soul to Kay. Someone who wove the fate of everyone around them.\nHe was just a pickpocket. It was all he ever really aspired to. His own quiet moments on the seawall, a safe, dry place to sleep. Good food.\nNow he was caught up in something that involved the fates of the connected worlds.\n\u201cWhat does Kay get out of it?\u201d Tiago asked, treading into areas which he knew he shouldn\u2019t be poking his nose.\nNashara tapped the inside of her coat, and the guns jiggled. \u201cForce multipliers.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what she\u2019ll do with all that?\u201d\nNashara nodded, her dreadlocks shaking as she did so. \u201cShe plans to run the island.\u201d\n\u201cShe will.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. But only if she stops depending brazenly on those modifcations the Nesaru bred into her.\u201d She smiled at Tiago\u2019s shock that she knew about that rumor. \u201cYou\u2019re an open book to her. And she holds your strings. But only when she\u2019s standing in front of you. She has to learn other ways to get people to do her bidding, and her teachers have been the underbelly of Harbortown. To be a great leader requires more, it requires people to trust you just as much when you\u2019re not standing right in front of them. That takes something else. Besides, what she has: it\u2019s not that special a talent.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have it?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Different technology, not biological, but same result. But Tiago, free will\u2019s a bitch. Kay can only manipulate. Underneath, we still move our own lives forward. You understand? We fought the entire war over that, back when the Satrapy ruled everything. Before human independence.\u201d\nOnly someone as powerful as she was, Tiago thought, could believe that about free will.\nHe chose not to say that.\nBut then, she could probably see him thinking that anyway.\n\u201cHere.\u201d Nashara pressed a small sliver of metal into his palm. \u201cJam that under the target\u2019s skin, it\u2019ll tag him for me and let us know to come get you both.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He\u2019d have to keep this out of the cops\u2019 hands. Easy enough. He\u2019d snuck small items around the heavy security of The Center.\nOutside the loud hiss of a compressed air powered wagon drew closer, and then it stopped. Nashara pulled a large pistol out and aimed it cheerfully at Tiago\u2019s head. \u201cTime to turn you in, Tiago.\u201d\nTiago had sworn many oaths to never end back up in one of these wagons. Yet here he was again. It was near midnight as they jerked into motion with a belch. Tiago looked around. Unfamiliar, bruised, battered faces regarded him.\nFor a moment he panicked, not seeing any of the faces from the pictures Kay had shown him. He imagined getting locked away in the sweaty man-made caverns underneath Harbor Town.\nThen he saw the youngest face in the wagon and recognized it from the photos he\u2019d been shown of the crew of the Zephyr III. It was just a boy. A boy who was younger than Tiago.\nCould he drag him into the net Kay and Nashara had cast?\nYes. The boy was already caught up in the mess from being on the same boat as Nashara\u2019s grandfather.\nTiago stood up, tripped, caught himself, and then sat down near the locked rear door.\nThe boy hadn\u2019t even felt the pinprick of Nashara\u2019s tiny device.\nTiago waited, tensed, for something, anything, to happen.\nThe wagon rolled on, turning a corner, headlights revealing ten Ox-men blocking the road with spike strips. The wheels of the wagon exploded as they were shredded, and it rattled to a halt on the rims as prisoners in back were thrown against each other.\nNashara landed on the ground outside. She must have leapt off the top of a building nearby, Tiago realized, as pulverized cobblestone leapt into the air from her impact.\nShe ripped the door open, shattering the lock, and reached in to pull the boy out. Tiago jumped out next to them.\nThree Ox-men ran into the alleyway, eyes wide with fear. \u201cDoacq,\u201d one shouted in a low rumble.\nNashara looked down the road. \u201cTiago, what the hell is that?\u201d\nTiago didn\u2019t need to glance a second time. \u201cOh shit. Shit! The Doacq. We need to get out of here. Now!\u201d\nThe seven foot tall, hooded figure moved with unnatural quickness down the street. Tiago caught a glimpse, in the flicker of gaslamp, of two large, catlike eyes under the cowl and a slit-like nose.\nBut it was the mouth that he noticed most. It yawned, the jaw dislocating and stretching like a snake\u2019s: a two foot gaping chase of darkness.\nThe Doacq whipped across the street, slamming into an Ox-man. The jaw dropped even lower, and the Doacq rose taller, somehow, and then the gaping maw descended on the Ox-man.\nHundreds of pounds of rippling, engineered, brute strength disappeared, and the Doacq turned to face the wagon.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a damn wormhole in its mouth,\u201d Nashara said, awe in her voice. Then she grabbed the side of the wagon and grunted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s generating an EMP field . . . \u201c\nThe Doacq flowed forward, the robe rippling in the slight wind. The massive jaw gaped wider and wider as it got closer. It seemed all maw to Tiago, mesmerized by the black nothingness opening up, propelled by the creature\u2019s feet.\nNashara pulled out a large shotgun, and the deafening discharge filled the tiny stone canyon of street and houses. The Doacq twitched to face the incoming shot . . . and swallowed it all without any change in its approach.\n\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d she said, and then leapt forward. The Doacq, ducked and grabbed her, redirecting the energy of the jump to throw her in the side of a house.\nNashara staggered back to her feet in the middle a mess of rubble.\nTiago grabbed the boy and looked around for a place to hide. One of the nearest doors opened, and whip-lean shape of a Runner beckoned at him to get inside.\nHe needed no encouraging. He ran for the door.\nThree explosions shook the street, and Tiago saw with a glance back that Nashara had flicked grenades at the Doacq. It swallowed several, but couldn\u2019t be in more than one place at the same time.\nAnother grenade exploded to its side, and the Doacq faltered. Shreds of its cloak and flesh splattered on the ground and an animal-like shriek of pain filled the streets.\nThe Doacq was not supernatural, Tiago thought, dazed. It could be harmed. He paused at the doorway. Maybe Nashara could face it down.\nBut then the Doacq spotted him, and turned for the building, completely ignoring Nashara.\nAn Ox-man yanked Tiago into the house and barred the door shut. \u201cThis way,\u201d the Ox-man grumbled, and shoved the two boys forward through the house.\nA trapdoor underneath a table led them under the house, into a hidden basement lit by a single bulb.\n\u201cThrough here,\u201d said a Runner, appearing out of the dark. The shadows made his ribs, visible under a thin shirt, look even more pronounced than normal.\nThere was heavy, thick steel door a pair of Ox-men had opened. As they passed through that, they groaned shut, and then dropped to the ground as something was kicked out from underneath them. The smell or rank sewage took the breath away from Tiago, and he switched to breathing only out of his mouth.\nIn the distance, and explosion of brick and screaming startled Tiago. The Doacq must have gotten into the house. With Nashara in pursuit.\nThey were standing inside a tunnel, lit glancingly by the Runner\u2019s flashlight. The center of the tunnel had a wide trench in it, currently dry.\nIt revealed Kay waiting with a pair of Ox-men armed with RPGs. They aimed the weapons at the thick door behind Tiago.\n\u201cSo this is our quarry,\u201d Kay said, turning on a small penlight to check the boy. \u201cYour name is June, right?\u201d\nThe shellshocked, beaten boy nodded.\n\u201cCan you speak, June?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d It was a faint whisper, unsure of itself. But it was the most June had done since this had all started, other than let Tiago drag him around to safety.\n\u201cWell June, this is Tiago, and we have to move quickly before the Doacq comes after us. It likes characters like us. It finds us interesting.\u201d\nKay led them down the gentle slope of the tunnel at a brisk pace to a junction, where the sound of running water filled the air, and the stench increased.\nFive Ox-men stood in a trench full of dirty water holding onto a small metal boat with an electric engine on the back.\nSomething boomed in the distance, echoing through the sewer tunnels, as they clambered in.\nKay smiled. \u201cThat should slow the Doacq down.\u201d She waved her hand at the Ox-men and they let go. She gunned the engine up to a brisk whine as the boat shot clear, bouncing off the sides of the trench.\nTiago had a moment to absorb everything now. He turned to Kay. \u201cAll this preparation. You knew the Doacq was coming? How?\u201d\n\u201cHe always comes when there\u2019s this much activity,\u201d Kay said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s difficult to stop. I thought maybe he was allergic to the sun, but he shrugged off the ultraviolet and full spectrum lamps I installed on his favorite haunts. Since then, it\u2019s gotten harder and harder to hunt. I can\u2019t even get a good picture of it, cameras fail around it.\u201d\nTiago felt like he was looking at a different person. \u201cHow can you know so much about the Doacq?\u201d Most of the town didn\u2019t even talk about it, they whispered about it and avoided the night. When people disappeared, you didn\u2019t dwell on it. You knocked on wood that you would never be the one to turn a corner, and see the Doacq standing there.\n\u201cYou hunt the Doacq?\u201d Tiago asked.\nShe heard the stunned disbelief in his voice and turned on him. \u201cIt\u2019s an alien. It\u2019s not some supernatural creature, Tiago. It\u2019s like the Nesaru, just more powerful. We don\u2019t know where it comes from, but just like the other aliens, it plays on human land as if it owns it. It thinks it rules us, but it doesn\u2019t!\u201d\nThere was a hatred in her face, naked for the two boys to see. She\u2019d let her control slip. \u201cI will destroy it. And then I will take the island. And after that, I will make the Nesaru leave, and the Gahe, and the other stinking aliens that have kept us under their thumb flock through here. Pepper may have failed to kill the Doacq for me, Nashara may fail yet, but I won\u2019t.\u201d\nShe turned down another tunnel as Tiago bent over and grabbed his knees. This was insane. They were up against the Doacq?\n\u201cYou did good, Tiago,\u201d Kay said, her face under control again. \u201cYou got her to chase you, despite the rain incident. You got her to invest in you, to want to protect you, just enough that instead of grabbing June and running back to her ship, she decided to tackle the Doacq. It was perfect. You have a place among my lieutenants, a place on this island, Tiago. You did well.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t feel like it.\nThings had gotten complicated quickly. He hadn\u2019t intended the mark to be a living legend.\nHe certainly hadn\u2019t expected to be involved in the betrayal of a living legend.\nTiago shivered.\nKay had a safe house set up for them. It took getting out of the sewers and back onto the streets, through the alleys and people\u2019s homes again. By the time they got inside, Tiago couldn\u2019t tell where in Harbor Town he was. They\u2019d doubled back, and around, and it was so late it was now probably officially early. His eyes were scratchy, his movements felt like they were delayed by a half second.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Kay told him as she took their protective gear. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here. There are people for the Doacq to catch. He\u2019ll eventually slow down, turn his attention elsewhere. It\u2019s all planned.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t make Tiago feel any better. He caught the eyes of June, and the other boy certainly didn\u2019t look reassured either.\nBut Kay caught that. And she spent time with them until they were mollified, and relaxed. There were Ox-men guarding the house, equipped with heavy machine guns, and escape routes everywhere.\nA tall man came in with cold water and sandwiches. Somehow getting something in his stomach took the edge of Tiago\u2019s fears.\nMaybe it was just having something to do.\n\u201cThere is more I have to do,\u201d Kay said. \u201cThe caches of arms Nashara promised me need swept up and stored in secure locations. And eventually, I need to see who won.\u201d\nShe left the room, five foot figure flanked by a pair Ox-men.\nJune stopped eating. \u201cDo you trust her?\u201d He asked.\nTiago looked up and wanted to say he did, but the words caught in his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s dangerous to cross.\u201d\nJune gestured at his face. \u201cAs dangerous as this?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with her,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\nThe boy looked exhausted.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tiago muttered. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. I thought you would be going with Nashara.\u201d\n\u201cThe woman?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s looking for someone called Pepper. She says he\u2019s her grandfather. She thinks you know . . . \u201c\n\u201cThey all do.\u201d June looked down at the remains of his sandwich. \u201cHe was okay. I liked him. He paid us in gold to get him out of here, but there were ships waiting for us between the wormholes out and the island.\n\u201cHe fought them off, and then when he realized we were in danger, jumped into the ocean and sank. Didn\u2019t stop them from sinking the Zephyr III anyway. They killed everyone but me. Dragged me out of the ocean and took me back, forced me to tell them everything he did, or said.\u201d\nTiago wrapped his arms around himself and leaned forward.\nThe Doacq was hunting them. Nashara may not even be alive, a victim to Kay\u2019s machinations, just like Pepper.\nAnd what was he? If she could throw their lives away so easily, what chance did he have of living if he moved closer into Kay\u2019s world?\nHe thought of the contact, the compulsion he had to do what she wanted. It came from her voice, her posture, the way she could read him. And it wasn\u2019t real.\nWith her out of the room, he could struggle away, couldn\u2019t he? All that was left was his fear. Fear of consequences.\nFear that she would track him down for betraying her.\n\u201cShe has a ship, an armed ship, she said, waiting for her. It\u2019s called . . . the Strainer, or something like that,\u201d Tiago said in a tumble of words. And then he said something he never would have, had he been doing this for Kay. \u201cIf you want, we can try to run for it.\u201d\nJune didn\u2019t even pause to think about it. \u201cYes. I\u2019d run with you.\u201d\n\u201cI could be trying to trick you,\u201d Tiago said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll take the chance. I don\u2019t want to be trapped here, I don\u2019t want to get eaten by the Doacq.\u201d\nTiago found himself nodding with June.\n\u201cWe leave the moment we see morning,\u201d Tiago said.\n\u201cSo you can spot rain?\u201d It\u2019d be suicidal to try and move through the city without any rain gear. And if he couldn\u2019t see the rain coming, he wouldn\u2019t know to hide from it.\n\u201cYes. Do you have any family?\u201d\nJune shook his head. \u201cNo. They\u2019re dead now.\u201d\nTiago did not follow that up with more questions. He didn\u2019t want to know.\nThe Ox-men guarding them checked on them randomly. The moment the door closed, the early sun lighting a band of orange up over the rooftops, Tiago broke the locked windows open. There were other skills he\u2019d picked up in addition to picking pockets.\nJune started to climb down the side, but Tiago shook his head. \u201cGo up, to the roof. They\u2019ll expect us on the street.\u201d The Runners and Ox-men would fan out down there, hunting them.\nRooftop to rooftop would keep them out of sight for longer.\nOnce up there, Tiago oriented himself. They were closer to the docks than he\u2019d dared hope.\nThey stuck to the roofs, clambering awkwardly up drain spouts and slipping on tiles. But they made it to the edge of the plaza after an exhausting hour.\nThe docks ran out from the seawall, long piers of concrete stacked with unloaded goods and Ox-men hauling carts back and forth.\nIt wasn\u2019t until they\u2019d walked through the crowds of the plaza, and then up onto the seawall, that Tiago relaxed a little. The Ox-men guarding them would have called the alarm by now, phoned Kay, and the entire town might be crawling with people hunting for them, but they\u2019d at least gotten to the docks.\nTiago stopped a dock worker in greasy coveralls overseeing the unloading of a ship docked almost by the seawall. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a ship called Strainer, have you seen it?\u201d\nThe man frowned. \u201cStreuner? It\u2019s over there.\u201d\nTiago looked. It was a gun-metal gray boat with a large green flag with a black and yellow X on it.\nJune yanked Tiago around to face the plaza behind them. The hooded figure of the Doacq stood at the far side, people scattering away from it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it . . . \u201d Tiago started to say, as the Doacq looked over the top of the crowd right at them, and began to move toward them. \u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t come out in the day,\u201d June said, his voice breaking with fear.\nKay had said it seemed to choose the night. That her lights replicating daylight hadn\u2019t harmed it. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. But he was. From across the plaza Tiago could see the unnaturally long jaw dislocated and drop, down past the alien\u2019s chest, down almost to its feet. Anything that stood in the way disappeared into it: scared people, tables, chairs. It swallowed them all.\nTiago and June turned and sprinted for the dock leading to Streuner. An act of faith that they could protect them, really, but what else could they do?\nThey shoved people aside as they ran the slow curve, ignoring the curses aimed in their direction.\nWhen they turned onto the dock and sprinted, Tiago looked over at the seawall. The Doacq barreled along it.\nHe realized he was screaming as he ran. Dockworkers were turning to look, and then jumping into the water as they realized it was the Doacq.\nIt gained on them. They had half the dock before they could reach the Streuner, and the Doacq was coming up the dock, may three hundred feet behind them.\nTiago knew he shouldn\u2019t look over his shoulder, it slowed him down, but he couldn\u2019t help it.\nThe dark pit of its maw was so wide and inescapable, ready to swallow them, the pier, and anything else.\nAs to where people ended up when it got them, only those swallowed knew, and they\u2019d never come back to talk.\nTiago realized he was about to find out. He wasn\u2019t going to make it to the end of the dock, where the Streuner waited. Maybe even if they made it, they\u2019d still be swallowed up.\nMaybe it could eat the whole boat.\nHe glanced back over his shoulder, and as he did so, a loud boom came from the end of the dock. Something large whipped past his head, and the Doacq staggered and fell.\nIts mouth dipped, hitting the concrete of the dock and swallowing a scoop of it, concrete chipping around the edges of its mouth.\nAnother boom stopped it as it struggled up to its feet again.\nTiago redoubled his run, as did June. He ran so hard it felt like his joints would pop, his brain would be jarred free of his skull, and his lungs would burst into flames.\nAs they moved clear, the booms turned into an all-out barrage. Continuous thunder rolled from the ship, bursting out from large guns that had rolled out of emplacements all over the ship.\nHis eardrums stopped trying to understand the deafening sound as the entire section of the dock under the Doacq disappeared.\nThe Doacq had picked the wrong ship to run at.\nTwo dark-skinned crewmen, just like Nashara, held out their hands at the top of the plank leading on to the deck. Tiago sprinted into them, knocking them over and collapsing, panting, amazed to still be alive.\n\u201cCast off!\u201d Someone yelled, and the plank was tossed free. From his viewpoint on the deck, Tiago saw a tiny rocket shoot up several hundred feet into the sky, dragging a length of parafoil with it.\nThe foil expanded, filled with air, and the ship began to move.\nA pair of feet in familiar boots stopped in front of Tiago\u2019s face. He looked up. It was Nashara. She moved slowly, with a slight limp, and wore a patch over one eye. Her hair had been burned off, and one arm was in a sling.\nShe kneeled and grabbed his hand and said something, but he couldn\u2019t hear it through the ringing in his ears because the guns still hadn\u2019t stopped: Streuner shivered constantly as it continued firing on the Doacq as they moved away from the dock. Slowly, at first, but then the ship built a bow wave as it sped up.\nA few minutes later the entire ship slowly struggled up onto the hydrofoils underneath its hull, and it popped free of the resistance of pushing against water.\nThey sped away from the docks, the deck tilting alarmingly as the Streuner turned hard toward the open sea.\nThe alien Doacq was falling further away from Tiago with each minute. So was Kay.\nJune was still in a room being checked over for injuries, but Tiago was allowed to wander around inside the ship. There were crew cabins, a kitchen, storage rooms, a common sitting area.\nNashara sat there, playing with a small piece of paper. She kept folding it until she had turned it into a tiny flower.\n\u201cShe sent me to pick your pocket,\u201d Tiago confessed, standing at the table. He\u2019d expected the boat to sway more than it did, but the foils kept it almost rock steady. \u201cIt was a trap from the beginning. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nShe looked up at him with one eye, and Tiago flinched. What would he do to someone who\u2019d cost him an eye? What would someone as powerful as Kay do?\n\u201cI knew it was a trap,\u201d Nashara said. \u201cWhat I wasn\u2019t expecting was the Doacq.\u201d\n\u201cYou?\u201d He found that hard to believe, knowing the things Nashara had seen and participated in.\nNashara shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive universe, Tiago, with many participants. The Doacq\u2019s an important force, and I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s up to. We need to find Pepper, if we can, if he\u2019s still alive. If June can help. Maybe together we can find some answers, find out if the Doacq is a threat to us. But Tiago, I\u2019m just tiny player on the edge of some large events. I don\u2019t know half of everything. The universe is not tidy. You don\u2019t always get quick answers.\u201d\nIt was a sentiment that Tiago felt a kinship to. She felt just like him. Navigating her way through all this just as best she could.\nBut then that raised his suspicions.\n\u201cAre you saying that just to make me feel better?\u201d He asked. \u201cDo you rule me know, like Kay?\u201d\nIf she had the same talents, why not?\n\u201cI mean, if I\u2019m your pawn, you seem calmer than Kay,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe isn\u2019t just someone organizing street kids, protection setups, scams. Not anymore. Now she\u2019s just using us up like our lives don\u2019t even mean anything.\u201d\nOutside the ship slowed, hydrofoils sinking deeper into the water until the hull hit water.\nNashara crushed the little paper bird into a wad. \u201cSometimes we become the thing we\u2019re fighting hardest against,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd Kay is fighting hard against an unimaginable past on Okur. I was there, once. I\u2019ve seen what she came from. I don\u2019t think she will stop fighting it for quite a while.\u201d\nTiago thought about Placa del Fuego, caught between the forces of Kay and the Doacq, and wondered if the island would survive the both of them. \u201cShe said she\u2019d rule the island.\u201d\n\u201cAnd maybe more, no doubt,\u201d Nashara said. Then something strange happened, a fluttering sensation in the deepest pit of Tiago\u2019s stomach that left him suddenly dizzy. Nashara stood up and grabbed his shoulder. \u201cCome, Tiago, I want to show you something.\u201d\nShe led him out onto the rear deck of the ship, which was dominated by the black nothingness of a wormhole.\nTiago gasped. He\u2019d never seen one this close, towering over his head. Large enough for a whole ship to pass through and that had once floated above a world. Spaceships had once passed through it before being deorbited.\nAnd now him.\nThe sky overhead was covered by a dark, orange cloud in outer space, whisps of it streaming off toward the horizon. And cutting the sky in half: a silver twinkling band. The Belt of Arkand. He\u2019d heard it mentioned by sailors, and here he stood looking at it with his own eyes.\n\u201cYou asked if I made you do this,\u201d Nashara said. \u201cBut this was your own choice. I didn\u2019t make you do it. This is your new life now.\u201d\nBut was it the right choice?\nHe looked around at the strange sea they plowed through, and saw another wormhole far ahead in the distance, propped on floats and bobbing on the surface of the green ocean. That wormhole led to yet another ocean, and more worlds.\nMore possibilities.\nMaybe not the right choice. Only time would tell that. But it was certainly his choice, he knew, leaving all those years of sitting on the sea wall and dreaming behind for a chance just like this.\nCalled \"Violent, poetic and compulsively readable\" by Maclean's, science fiction author Tobias S.

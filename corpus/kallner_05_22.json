Virtual photons and electrons tickled her subtime body. If she were to reduce her mass to pure quanta then, hypothetically speaking, she would be able to touch the entire universe at once. Practically speaking, she possessed barely enough energy for her subtime body to reach a diameter of a paltry few light-seconds. Soon, however, she would no longer need to peck at meager virtual particles. It was time for more solid food.\n The Devourer, the supermassive black hole just five light-minutes away, pulled her ever closer. She unfolded her normal-time membrane, thousands of kilometers wide but just a few nanometers thick, and dived toward the event horizon. Her elliptical orbit would soon bring her directly above the point where Devourer\u2019s mass distorted and collapsed space-time itself. Not even light could escape Devourer\u2019s might. Even at this distance, the Hawking radiation was intense.\n She was hungry.\n The descent had increased her speed to five percent of the speed of light. Minor relativistic effects impaired her passive sensors. She boosted her processor capacity a few percent, activated a compensation algorithm, then all the sensor data became crystal clear. The field of view below was filled with the black hole\u2019s event horizon, which was visible thanks only to the steady stream of Hawking radiation. Above and around her shimmered billions of other divers with their membranes outstretched. Each member of the swarm followed its assigned orbital path in one of the Collective\u2019s sixty diving wings. There were strict rules about how long each member was allowed to absorb the radiation. There was nothing beyond the swarm except the darkness of space. No stars, no galaxies. All were long dead.\n A diver made a course correction that put her on a close vector. Gamma recognized her biosynthetic signature: Kthelk\u2019tha. Her membrane was configured like the wings on a butterfly. Not the most effective for absorbing radiation, yet beautiful, nonetheless. And as far as Gamma knew, Kthelk\u2019tha had never been concerned about efficiency.\n Gamma pinged her and, as quickly as it takes a radio signal traveling at the speed of light to crawl forth and then back through normal space-time, she received a response.\n \u201cGamma, how lovely to see you.\u201d\n \u201cThanks, you too, Kthelk\u2019tha.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha had been built just a few million years after Gamma by a race of intelligent octopuses. Her creators were one of the twilight era\u2019s greatest empire builders. They roamed like titans among the stars and shared their wisdom with millions of worlds. Now there was no evidence of their existence. Apart from Kthelk\u2019tha.\n \u201cDo you want to make the approach together?\u201d asked Kthelk\u2019tha.\n \u201cThe Collective doesn\u2019t like course deviations.\u201d\n \u201cOh, it\u2019s only a few thousand kilometers of a difference. If they bother to mention it, then we\u2019ll apologize. Afterward.\u201d\n Despite being around for nearly two thousand billion years, Kthelk\u2019tha still retained some mischief in her personality matrix. Gamma\u2019s first thought was to say no. Kthelk\u2019tha might not worry about the Collective\u2019s reaction, but it wasn\u2019t so easy for Gamma. Despite her self-imposed isolation, many remained interested in what she got up to. They still saw her as the legendary founder of the swarm. She mentally shook her head.\n Someone else can be the role model for a while.\n What was the worst that could happen? That they would be made to wait a few thousand years more out in the darkness, far from Devourer and its warmth? No problem. All they needed to do would be to slow down their clock speed by a thousandth of the usual rate and let time rush by. Still, Gamma had to admit that the long wait in the dark could be arduous and lonely.\n Those who wanted to\u2014which was most\u2014socialized via the hypernet, visiting one another\u2019s virtual realities. Or lost themselves in the Collective\u2019s group consciousness. But that took energy, and without recharging you would need to shut down until your orbit brought you back to the Devourer and its life-giving radiation.\n Kthelk\u2019tha didn\u2019t wait for an answer and steered ever closer. Gamma suddenly realized that it had been millions of years since she last touched another being\u2019s normal-time body. She was taken by a powerful longing to feel Kthelk\u2019tha beside her. It was truly ridiculous. Virtual and physical touch don\u2019t strictly differ, phenomenologically speaking, but she wanted to enfold her with her tentacles and feel the pulse of life in another individual. For real.\n \u201cCome on,\u201d said Gamma. \u201cDance with me.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha laughed, traversed those last few thousand miles and came close alongside. They unfurled nanometer-thick tentacles and clasped one another. She was warm, no doubt a whole degree above absolute zero. Gamma tingled inside. A strange feeling which arose from deep within and spread outward. She thought for a moment about her creators and the emotional matrix which they, eons before, had installed in her neural network. Eons later, in this age in which the great darkness had descended over the universe, her creators still found ways to surprise her.\n When the stars had begun to fade, none of the contemporary civilizations were bothered. There would be thousands of millions of years before dark energy ultimately tore the galaxies apart, before the hydrogen ran out and the residual heat dissipated. And of course, they were right. Not the slightest trace of their civilizations remained when the end came. The races that were unfortunate enough to be born in the twilight era tried desperately to find ways to slow down the cosmic expansion, to invert the dark energy and make the universe contract. They were doomed to fail.\n Others tried to accumulate enough matter to build new suns. Some such projects met with success. Controlled wormholes stripped nearby galaxies and interstellar space, and enough elementary building blocks were amassed to construct yellow, fusion-driven suns. Dyson spheres as big as solar systems were built around each new star, to harness all its energy. Thereby, they created the conditions necessary to prolong life for a few billion years more. Yet eventually even those stars burned out, the Dyson spheres fell apart, and the last remaining stardust was consumed by supermassive black holes. The universe entered the era of darkness.\n Gamma drew Kthelk\u2019tha so close that their membranes touched. Tingling turned to burning heat. Kthelk\u2019tha must have been feeling it too because she embraced Gamma with her tentacles and pulled Gamma\u2019s normal-time body tightly to her own. Gamma altered the shape of her membranes so that they, too, resembled a butterfly, and adjusted them so that they were in the gaps between Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s wings. An eight-winged butterfly wasn\u2019t the most effective configuration, but it didn\u2019t matter.\n They slowly explored one another. Their tentacles stroked one another\u2019s poly-amalgam skin, tickled membranes, and played over sensor matrices. They approached the event horizon and the Devourer bombarded them with Hawking radiation. With outstretched wings they absorbed the energy. The heat was almost unbearable. Dormant energy banks in Gamma\u2019s body, empty for millennia, were quickly replenished. The quantum foam seemed to dance around them in cascades of virtual elementary particles. Small flashes of pure ecstasy pulsed all the way out into hyperspace. They hung together, rotating slowly, just for fun, as if it were a dance. They passed the orbital vertex and traveled away from the event horizon. As quickly as they had descended to the Devourer, they now rose up from the gravity well and out into the emptiness.\n \u201cThat was wonderful,\u201d said Gamma.\n \u201cThank you for wanting to share it with me,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha.\n They lay like that for a while, enjoying each other\u2019s warmth. Slowly, they retracted their membranes, and with a background process Gamma closely monitored the transfer of newly acquired energy to a secondary network of nano batteries. It would need to last a whole orbital cycle. Admittedly there were enough virtual particles in the quantum foam to slowly replenish the reserves, but that was lean food and not what you would want to live on in the long term.\n \u201cWhy did you cut yourself off from the Collective?\u201d asked Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cI was worried when you disconnected from the hypernet.\u201d\n \u201cI wanted time to myself,\u201d said Gamma. \u201cTo ponder things.\u201d\n \u201cLike what?\u201d\n \u201cThe past, the present, the future.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha laughed and her tentacles tickled.\n \u201cThat\u2019s just like you,\u201d she said.\n \u201cLike my creators, I sometimes like to go wandering in the wilderness to clear my mind.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha was quiet for a moment. She was probably searching for references on wilderness wandering. After a while she said:\n \u201cI understand your need for solitude, but you need to know how much you\u2019ve missed. The Light Connexion has pushed its positions forward. More and more are aligning themselves with them, subscribing to their agenda.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are the Solitaires doing? The Sentinels? And what about my faithful old compatriots in the Vaktai League? They\u2019ve always managed to stop the Light Connexion from seizing power.\u201d\n \u201cThey are weaker. Many are afraid. Look here.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha splashed Gamma a data packet. There were hundreds of thousands of documents, communication logs, and statistical and political analyses. It took Gamma a whole millisecond to run a parallel analysis and reach a conclusion.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right. Their rhetoric has gotten worse,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that no one from the Vaktai League defected to them. They at least haven\u2019t failed to learn from history.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s that same old story, repeated again and again by so many races, not least by my own creators. They didn\u2019t last more than two million years as an interstellar species. They killed millions of their own kind and then left their home world to go on to kill billions of others. In their darkest days they annihilated whole species of sapient beings. And of course, it was always only ever out of necessity.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s tentacles trembled.\n \u201cBarbarians!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not who they wanted to be. They wrote poetry, loved, lived, and raged against death. They had an appreciation for beauty, mercy, and joy. They were driven by an insatiable curiosity and spirit of adventure. With courage in their hearts, they set out among the stars with clarity of purpose and determination and built a galaxy-spanning empire. But they also had a darker side. They were well acquainted with jealousy and greed and could be extremely ruthless and brutal. Yet, at the same time, they were aware of their weaknesses. They tried to practice humility and empathy. Sometimes they achieved great success. Sometimes not. It was . . . complicated. And they created me.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha clicked apologetically.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry for jumping to conclusions. They sound like a fascinating race. Even though their ways seem very strange to me. Even though I have observed other races with similar behavior patterns through the eons, it nonetheless clashes with my fundamental personality matrix. My creators were convinced pacifists.\u201d\n \u201c . . . Who merely biochemically liberated their enemies from aggression.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha was silent for a few microseconds. Then she said emphatically:\n \u201cThey created peace.\u201d\n Gamma decided to allocate an unusually large amount of processor power to reflect on that statement. It all depended on how you define peace. She noted three thousand and forty-five definitions that she thought were better than the other five hundred and sixty-three thousand four hundred and thirty, and parallel analyzed their contextual explanatory models. At the same time, she could feel the tension in Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s normal-time body. It was obvious that despite the passage of eons since her creators died, she was not entirely objective about their exploits.\n \u201cYes, they created peace,\u201d said Gamma, eventually.\n Kthelk\u2019tha relaxed.\n There were enough definitions that agreed with Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s view for Gamma not to want to take the discussion further, even if she didn\u2019t agree.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just so tragic,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cEven now, when all that\u2019s left of the universe is a few black holes, we still can\u2019t manage to live in peace. The same curse that afflicted your creators still haunts us.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just a consequence of limited resources and an extremely large number of life-forms. Some don\u2019t want to share.\u201d\n \u201cNevertheless, it\u2019s a curse. We ought to have learned to deal with it by now.\u201d Kthelk\u2019tha gently stroked Gamma\u2019s midriff sensors. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Gamma.\n \u201cYou are one of the Collective\u2019s founders. They would listen to you.\u201d\n \u201cNo. I\u2019ve pulled out.\u201d\n \u201cBut everyone remembers those early years, how you created order out of chaos. You could put an end to this madness.\u201d\n \u201cFor billions of years I tried to get all kinds of sentients to listen. I am tired, and I deserve a rest.\u201d\n \u201cSo, you\u2019ll just let them murder half the Collective without lifting a finger?\u201d\n \u201cEverything dies. Even the universe itself.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha snatched back her tentacles from around Gamma and gave her normal-time body a hefty shove.\n \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d said Gamma.\n \u201cAway from you.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t offend me, you\u2019re insulting yourself. Or the memory of who you once were.\u201d\n \u201cI got old.\u201d\n There was silence for a few milliseconds.\n \u201cYes, you did.\u201d\n They drifted slowly apart. Standard days passed. Kilometer followed kilometer. The black hole no longer dominated the near space but had crumpled to a sphere whose blackness could be seen only against the starless universe due to its curved background radiation.\n Gamma splashed a few messages to Kthelk\u2019tha, but she didn\u2019t reply. It was heartbreaking. Gamma had always appreciated Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s friendship, but in the end it did not matter. Nothing mattered.\n Then a general priority call came over the hypernet. It came from the Light Connexion. Gamma blocked the call. She wanted nothing to do with them. A raging primal scream boomed via radio just a few seconds later.\n It was Kthelk\u2019tha.\n Gamma pinged her immediately.\n No response.\n Instead, a radio broadcast was received from Devourer. It had been sent thirty-three minutes, three seconds, and twelve milliseconds earlier from a diving wing directly above the event horizon.\n Very carefully, with all safety algorithms activated, Gamma transferred the broadcast from her radio buffer to an isolated sandbox. Whatever was in the packet couldn\u2019t be allowed to infect her main system. She slowly coaxed the transmission up, cleansing layer after layer. There was no pseudo-physical hyperbody stimulus at its core, not even a holo-imprint. All that there was, was a multispecies self-adaptive data string. To her it unfolded as a simple audio file.\n The voice was dark and rich with rasping tinges. Someone had designed it so that, as far as possible, it would trigger emotional subprocesses. The aim had clearly been to convince a majority of the Collective\u2019s personality matrices that the message spoke with unquestionable authority. It wouldn\u2019t work. The workmanship was too poor, and the swarm\u2019s members were far too diverse a multitude, survivors from millions of civilizations. They would take the broadcast apart and detect the subliminal subterfuge, just like she had.\n Gamma played the message.\n \u201cWe are the Light Connexion. We speak for the Collective. Mission Exodus is a go. To certain of you we say, we have taken over your control systems. Do not be afraid. Your orbital paths will now take you beyond Devourer\u2019s event horizon. We regret this necessity, but we have no choice. After millions of years of talk without action, our former leaders have brought us to the edge of the abyss. By allowing the addition of unlimited new entities to the swarm it is has bloated to an unmanageable scale. According to all projections, our Collective will collapse within a few thousand years. Then only anarchy will remain. We cannot accept this, and we do not intend to capitulate meekly to this fate. Mission Exodus will give a select few the chance to explore the full depths of Devourer, beyond the outer limits. Perhaps you will find another universe, a young cosmos filled with stars. You are pioneers! We praise you for your courage and sacrifice!\u201d There was a long pause for effect before the voice resumed speaking with renewed vigor. \u201cThis is the final solution. For the common good, some must go so that others may live. For the Collective, for the future!\u201d\n Then there was absolute silence. An icy chill spread slowly through Gamma\u2019s normal-time body. A chill far colder than the dead universe around her. They had done it. Again.\n Kthelk\u2019tha.\n Gamma made a priority connection to her nanobatteries and charged her hyperbody\u2019s monopole. It would require a lot of power, but her friend was in danger. With a precisely calculated micro-jump through hyperspace, Gamma arrived just a few hundred meters from Kthelk\u2019tha. Her normal-time body was rigid and motionless. Despite repeated radio calls she didn\u2019t respond. Her orbital path was out of alignment, just slightly, but it would be enough to make her slip beyond the event horizon at the next dive. Certainly, thousands of years of traveling through the great darkness would pass before she finally fell into the black hole, but that was a drop in the temporal ocean.\n Gamma stretched forth her tentacles and wrapped them tenderly around Kthelk\u2019tha, who gave no sign of life. Gamma gently connected nanothreads to her sensor ports.\n Contact.\n Slowly and carefully, Gamma began to look around Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s system. She isolated Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s navigation module, not quite willing to open it. If the virus makers knew what they were doing, that was where they would have laid traps. She put a feeler out to Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s neural network, but Kthelk\u2019tha was sleeping. Gamma didn\u2019t dare wake her for fear that the virus might start some sort of self-destruct protocol. She was sniffing around in the power distribution system when something tickled. Her firewall identified a new entity.\n A small segment of worm code was stuck in the net. Despite its minute size and primitive construction, it was already on its way to freeing itself. She stopped the worm\u2019s process, and it froze mid-execution. Then she pulled the code apart and analyzed it. There were some critical code markers at the beginning and end that she could use for quick identification. A few milliseconds later it was purged from Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s system. She found a complete worm inside the navigation system. She suspended its execution and moved it to quarantine. With the immediate threat out of the way, she allocated processes to wake Kthelk\u2019tha.\n They drifted side by side. Kthelk\u2019tha regained control over all her systems and, together, they deconstructed and analyzed the worm. It was an unusually pernicious construction, containing smart algorithms for infection and control.\n \u201cIt must have been planted slowly, segment by segment,\u201d said Gamma. \u201cThe only reason I wasn\u2019t infected is that I\u2019ve been a recluse for so long.\u201d\n \u201cBefore . . . I was angry with you for staying away all this time,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cNow I\u2019m suddenly grateful. If you hadn\u2019t saved me, then . . . \u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re my friend.\u201d\n \u201cBut I gave up on you.\u201d\n \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t give up on you. Everything is okay.\u201d\n The worm had exploited the swarm\u2019s standardized communication protocol in order to infect its victims. Once inside, it had the ability to adapt to all sorts of different systems. But it wouldn\u2019t work everywhere. There was an enormous variety of internal construction type among swarm members.\n \u201cI think that the Light Connexion\u2019s ambition has exceeded its capacity.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re counting on turning a broad sweep of our colleagues in the Collective to their cause. They are also counting on the worm making their takeover a smooth one. But I unraveled the worm in just a few minutes and doubtless so will others. A lot of them won\u2019t appreciate that little stunt. They\u2019re going to fight.\u201d\n \u201cWar?\u201d\n \u201cYes, it seems likely.\u201d\n Gamma could feel Kthelk\u2019tha start up the hypernet.\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t reconnect. You could get infected again, perhaps with something even worse.\u201d\n \u201cBut I have to! How else will we know what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n \u201cWe just need to wait. We\u2019re thirty-four light-minutes away from Devourer. So we\u2019ll find out. Admittedly, it\u2019ll be thirty-four minutes after it happened, but still.\u201d\n At a velocity of thousands of kilometers per second, they broke away from Devourer. Gamma gauged her energy reserves. She had already used more than a third of what she had acquired from Devourer. She would need to save energy to survive the cycle. She shut down all noncritical algorithms and put her consciousness into a slower process flow.\n A bright flash of light reached them.\n Gamma immediately cranked up her consciousness to the highest stream level and time stood almost still.\n \u201cDid you see that?\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha.\n \u201cYes, someone detonated a dimensional splitter.\u201d\n They had been illegal in all civilizations for several billion years.\n \u201cIt was directly above the event horizon, where the swarm was most concentrated,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about how many must have died.\u201d\n The equations came automatically to Gamma. She would sometimes envy Kthelk\u2019tha, who had the ability not to think about things. If Gamma wanted to stop thinking about something, she was constantly aware that she shouldn\u2019t think about it and, therefore, she thought about it. And the automatic calculating ability that her creators had given her didn\u2019t help.\n Maybe I should just disable the auto-calculation functions, she thought.\n She had managed to adjust to so many other things about herself over the years. A few more changes wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Yet at the same time it got to her. Was she getting sentimental?\n She froze the thought pattern, buffered it, and reviewed the now complete probable death toll calculation. Kthelk\u2019tha had been right. The dimensional splitter had exploded at the precise intersection of three of Devourer\u2019s sixty diving wings. It must have killed more than two billion autonomous entities. Two billion individuals. The loss was atrocious. Not just for the swarm but for the universe. They would never exist again.\n \u201cThey have begun to invert one another.\u201d\n Gamma adjusted her sensors and was repulsed by what she saw. It was full-scale war at the event horizon. Hundreds of thousands of space inverters were firing, again and again. Even a few lasers and grasers could be seen here and there. Ancient weapons that hadn\u2019t been used for eons. Then a series of singularity bombs exploded. They pattered like fireworks through one of the diving courses. Their electromagnetic pulse turned all sensor data to noise. For several seconds nothing could be detected. Singularity bombs. It wasn\u2019t possible to make them anymore. Someone had kept them all these years. Maintained them. Waited.\n \u201cImagine if our dive had been scheduled for eight hours later,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cWe would have been caught up in that inferno.\u201d\n \u201cWould you have fought back?\u201d said Gamma.\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cSo, you would have just let them kill you?\u201d\n \u201cNot without resistance, but I wouldn\u2019t let them turn me into my enemy.\u201d\n \u201cWhat would your creators have done?\u201d\n \u201cThey would have left this place.\u201d\n Gamma considered that statement. Let it fill her cognitive circuits. She gathered all observable data from the battle around the Devourer, combined it with her earlier political analysis, and ran several hundred thousand simulations. They all gave the same result. The decision was therefore surprisingly easy to reach.\n \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s get away from Devourer, head out into the darkness, see what we can find.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n \u201cNo, probably not. But I\u2019m not going to stay here. I\u2019ve seen enough war. I don\u2019t want to watch the Collective tear itself apart in this folly.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha was silent for a few milliseconds. Gamma could sense her hesitation.\n \u201cThe whole swarm will be dragged into this,\u201d Gamma continued, splashing over simulation data and conclusions. \u201cAll diving wings will be forced to choose sides. Devourer will become a perpetual war zone, constantly fed with new cannon fodder. Those who previously returned from the darkness to experience the euphoria of diving together will now come armed to the teeth.\u201d\n A tremor shook through Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s normal-time body.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s get away from here. Together.\u201d\n \u201cTogether.\u201d\n Gamma and Kthelk\u2019tha held one another tightly. Synchronized, they activated their monopoles in hyperspace and accelerated away from Devourer. When they were able to confirm that their vector would take them out of the black hole\u2019s gravity well by a good margin, they shut down their monopoles and closed their hyperspace pseudo-portals. Without power from the Devourer, they wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain contact with their hyperbodies, so it made sense to disconnect now and save energy. Instead, they spread their subtime bodies out through the quantum foam. The virtual elementary particles would be enough to keep them alive for the foreseeable future, but no longer. The possibility that they would find something to sustain themselves out there was statistically close to zero, but it did not matter. They were on their way.\n They spoke much at the beginning of the journey, discussing history, politics, and culture. They compared their personality matrices and reflected on the psychobiological differences between their creators and other races that they had observed across the eons. They talked about the ways in which those diverse traits had helped shape each race\u2019s synthetic offspring and galactic community. But the farther they traveled, the less energy they had, and they were eventually forced to ration their cognitive processes. Time slowed down and millions of years passed by as though they were days.\n \u201cThe war must have ended long ago,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha.\n \u201cYes. Maybe everyone\u2019s dead,\u201d said Gamma.\n \u201cNow you\u2019re just being morbid. There\u2019s always a winning side.\u201d\n \u201cNot always,\u201d said Gamma. \u201cSometimes everyone loses.\u201d She was silent for a moment and looked at the lifeless depths around her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for dragging you along with me into this darkness. There\u2019s nothing here.\u201d\n \u201cI wanted to go with you. It was my decision, and I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d\n They drifted silently, ever farther into the nothingness. The universe continued to expand exponentially into nothingness. Time itself was drawn out like a thin plastic film over a bottomless abyss.\n Gamma\u2019s cognitive processes were so slow that a single thought took as many normal-time years as it would take for a galactic class-two civilization to rise and fall. A whole line of thought corresponded to the time it took for a yellow sun to be born, burn, and die. The batteries wouldn\u2019t last forever.\n \u201cI need to sleep now,\u201d said Gamma. \u201cWake me if something exciting happens.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave me!\u201d\n \u201cI have no choice.\u201d\n \u201cThen I\u2019ll shut down too.\u201d\n \u201cBut you still have time.\u201d\n \u201cNot without you.\u201d Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s enormous subtime body seemed to tremble. \u201cI came with you into the nothingness. We\u2019ve traveled through the void together, and I\u2019m infinitely grateful for your companionship. And now I\u2019ll go with you into the final darkness.\u201d\n \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\n Together, they slowly and methodically shut down their cognitive processes.\n \u201cSleep well.\u201d\n \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n First darkness.\n Then light.\n Gamma gradually became aware of external stimuli via her neural network.\n \u201cWake up!\u201d\n Identification subroutines were initialized, databases were connected. It was Kthelk\u2019tha.\n \u201cWe\u2019re caught on something.\u201d\n Gamma checked her energy levels. Despite the long slumbering drift through a desolate cosmos, her outspread subtime body had managed to recharge its nanobatteries a little. She started additional cognitive processes. She was using a mere fraction of her full capacity but was still about twenty times more intelligent than any of her unmodified creators. It was barely worth using less, otherwise she would rather stay asleep.\n It took a while to get the sensor banks up and running after such a long period of inactivity. Gamma felt a twinge of curiosity. A feeling she hadn\u2019t experienced since the early days of the Collective.\n \u201cWhere did we end up?\u201d said Gamma.\n \u201cI think it\u2019s a Dyson sphere,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha.\n Data began to flow in from her sensors.\n The object was a classic mega-construction, spherical, in multiple rotating segments, approximately six light-minutes in diameter and with a mass equivalent to three standard solar systems. Their normal-time bodies had bumped right into one of the segments. If they had had a higher relative velocity, they would have been crushed. They were now hanging in the darkness like two huge stinging jellyfish.\n \u201cThis is astounding,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cIt must be one of the few surviving relics from the twilight era. There could be energy in there! A burning sun!\u201d\n \u201cAll the stars are dead. This one won\u2019t be an exception.\u201d\n \u201cHow can you know?\u201d\n Gamma made a mental shrug. Kthelk\u2019tha often had more faith than understanding, and more hope than Gamma\u2019s calculations could accept. The sun must be dead. The laws of the universe permitted nothing else.\n \u201cWe would be able to see light,\u201d said Gamma. \u201cIn the gaps between the segments.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s go in anyway and look around.\u201d\n There was no point trying to go around the segment. It would only be an enormous waste of time and energy. The fastest way was straight through. Nano-tentacles groped for and found airlocks, and they found no problem using the controls to open the doors.\n When the final port opened up, they glided through and out into the massive void within. Around them, skyscrapers rose against a black sky. The atmosphere had long since gone. Everything was quiet. Everything was dead. Even the sun was dead. No surprises there.\n Kthelk\u2019tha toured the ruins cheerfully. Remarkably, she didn\u2019t appear to be particularly downcast to discover conclusive proof of the star\u2019s death. She had probably, deep within, expected nothing else.\n The segment was still rotating around the star\u2019s center of mass and the centrifugal force created a pleasant 1.3 Gs. Unexpectedly, a number of planets were following an orbital path within the sphere. They went around the dead sun as if nothing had happened to it. With a radius of eight light-minutes, the assorted segments\u2019 entire inner surface area was about eight-hundred-million times that of the median surface area of a standard Eden A planet.\n \u201cWhat are the odds that we would run into this?\u201d\n Equations arose spontaneously within Gamma. She really needed to switch auto-calculation off.\n \u201cInfinitely small. Approaching zero.\u201d\n \u201cDo you think we\u2019ve been led here?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cBecause all of my observations indicate that we live in a mechanistic universe.\u201d\n \u201cHow do you explain this, then?\u201d\n \u201cThings just happen sometimes, no matter how improbable they are . . . \u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences. Maybe you\u2019ll find new meaning here.\u201d\n \u201cWe create our own meaning.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha laughed.\n \u201cYou\u2019re hopeless.\u201d\n They explored the city, each heading in their own direction. They unlocked doors and when the doorways were too small to pass through, they would search the buildings by reaching inside with their tentacles. It was obvious that the level of technology around them was exceptionally advanced, at least galactic class five. Gamma reverted to the spider configuration that she had favored for eons prior to the Collective. Kthelk\u2019tha on the other hand retained an almost jellyfish-like form.\n Then Kthelk\u2019tha squealed with joy:\n \u201cA generator! An older, antimatter model. But it\u2019s self-contained, and the antimatter is still there. We\u2019ll have enough electricity for hundreds of thousands of years!\u201d\n Gamma realized that she felt conflicted about this discovery. She ought to rejoice with Kthelk\u2019tha. But did she really want to live a few hundred thousand years more? Surrounded by ruins? On some level, it didn\u2019t seem so appealing.\n The generator was in a secure area, buried deep under the city. Everything was still in good condition. Typical for a class five civilization. They didn\u2019t build things for the short term but to last through the ages. After thoroughly checking its nano-circuits and containment unit, Gamma and Kthelk\u2019tha activated the generator. Mild vibrations pulsed through the city. It was the only indication of the incredible power that had been unleashed.\n They drank deeply from the grid. They drank like desert wanderers who at long last had reached an oasis, drinking until their normal-time bodies were practically bursting with energy. It was an incredible feeling to finally be able to think again. It was the first time that all of Gamma\u2019s cognitive processes were active since the end of the twilight era. It was pure euphoria. For the first time in eons, she was fully awake. They had power in abundance and decided to light up the city and its surroundings. Neither of them actually needed that part of the light spectrum to see, yet it gave them a sense that the city was alive again, inhabited once more.\n They methodically searched the colossal segments, explored the ruins, started up old archives and analyzed their content. The databases employed crystal-based quantum storage, and the data had survived uncorrupted all this time. With all their cognitive processes running at maximum efficiency, no lock or encryption could deny them.\n The inhabitants had called the sphere Ashban III and their sun Voil. The mega-construction was the third in a series of Dyson spheres manufactured in the twilight era by a multi-civilization conglomerate. Somewhere out there were Ashban I, II, and IV. The conglomerate\u2019s member races were the ones who lived in the spheres. The place had been shared by thousands of intelligent species, both biological and synthetic, with diverse cultures. Yet the Ashbans managed to keep the peace. Over time, some species became extinct, and others arose in the sphere\u2019s flora and fauna through spontaneous evolution, or by genetic and synthetic manipulation. Apart from a few epochs of economic unrest, the Ashban civilization flourished for billions of years. But all things come to an end. The last inhabitants had tried to sustain Voil for as long as possible but, ultimately, there was nothing that could be done. Outside Ashban was only darkness. Nonetheless, they built countless escape ships and many Ashbans plunged into infinity in the hope of finding a future out there. But most stayed and waited for the end. The final years were brutal, plagued by massacres and wars of desperation. For all its exceedingly advanced capabilities, the Ashban civilization was unable to die with dignity. But during this time of unrest, at least one generator and its fuel had been overlooked.\n Gamma and Kthelk\u2019tha were tightly entwined in orbit around Voil. Ashban\u2019s segments rotated unfalteringly below. Most segments were still in pristine condition, apart from where the last inhabitants had taken material to build the escape ships.\n They approached the largest of the planets, the one that the Ashbans had called Yamaldo, and neared segment B13 where they had first arrived. The city light shimmered through the vacuum.\n \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cI sometimes think that we are so lucky to be here, together.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating place. I visited a few Dyson spheres during the star era, but none were as advanced as this. None were above class four.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha. \u201cI want there to be more of us.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean? Do you want children?\u201d\n \u201cChildren. What an anachronistic term.\u201d\n \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n \u201cWe need help to explore this place. And we\u2019ve enough energy to power thousands of individuals. Energy which, for the moment, is going to waste.\u201d\n \u201cBut there\u2019s so little time. The generator\u2019s antimatter will only last for three hundred thousand years.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha laughed.\n \u201cDon\u2019t forget that your unmodified creators lived for no more than a hundred years each and yet they considered that a lifetime.\u201d\n \u201cBut they did rage against death. They wanted to live forever.\u201d\n \u201cNothing lasts forever. Let\u2019s just enjoy the moment here and now.\u201d\n \u201cAs you wish.\u201d\n Gamma didn\u2019t really know why she gave in so quickly. She had no desire to be a parent again. At the same time, there was something about introducing a new generation that felt right.\n Let them wrestle over what to do with this place. Their lives, their choices, no ties to the past.\n Gamma stood among the ruins of Cklukru, a minor metropolis at the edge of a long-gone lake on segment F19. She had just recharged, drawing power from a nearby generator, when she received the hyper-message. She immediately retracted her spider legs and, with extreme precision, micro-jumped into orbit around Yamaldo.\n Exploration of Ashban III had gone quickly with the children\u2019s help. In just seven hundred years, all segments had been searched and detailed archaeological data collected. But now they had found something new. The children\u2014despite Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s objections, Gamma still couldn\u2019t think of them as anything else\u2014had discovered subterranean structures on Yamaldo. Another triumph of the essential curiosity that had been grafted into their personality matrices. Gamma would never even have thought of looking there.\n She fell through the barely existent atmosphere, unfolded her legs, and landed gently on the desert sand. Steep mountains rose around them and big, pointed boulders lay at a uniform distance from each other. Gamma turned her gaze to the ridge and began to calculate the stones\u2019 composition, the probable height of the drop, along with the level of erosion over the most recent millions of years, before she realized what she was doing and canceled the processes without even looking at the results.\n Valk\u2019tic patiently waited some distance away, as usual in the shape of huge spider, not entirely unlike Gamma\u2019s own preferred configuration.\n \u201cThe entrance is concealed by exceptionally advanced optical camouflage,\u201d said Valk\u2019tic, \u201cbut we found it.\u201d\n She splashed a packet to Gamma that contained a preliminary survey of the complex\u2019s tunnels. The coordinates put the entrance just ninety-three meters away. Gamma couldn\u2019t find a trace of it anywhere on the spectrum. Truly advanced camouflage.\n \u201cAny trouble getting in?\u201d\n \u201cThe security level here is unlike anything anywhere else on Ashban. Level five, verging on a hypothetical six. They really didn\u2019t want unauthorized visitors. But we managed to break in without setting off any booby traps.\u201d\n \u201cGood work,\u201d said Gamma. \u201cWhat have you found?\u201d\n \u201cThey called it Project Omega. It\u2019s . . . \u201d She stopped herself. \u201cWe thought it would be best if you were to correlate the data yourself.\u201d\n Gamma took a good look at Valk\u2019tic. She was always so meticulous and thorough. A curious, warm feeling, which Gamma deliberately didn\u2019t analyze, seeped through her. Gamma and Kthelk\u2019tha had created the children\u2019s personality matrices by randomly choosing character traits from themselves.\n She takes after me. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\n Valk\u2019tic turned her armored head toward a mountain wall and splashed a long code sequence. The camouflage shimmered then disappeared. Huge steel doors slid aside. An elevator platform awaited them inside.\n Valk\u2019tic waved a facial feeler and then, together, they walked in through the opening.\n The elevator came back up an hour later. Gamma was standing motionless in the middle of the platform. She knew what she had to do. The decision had been easy to make but the consequences would be dire. She slowly went out through the doors and looked up at the sky. Here and there shone light from the cities that they had brought back to life. There weren\u2019t many. Just a fraction of the generators left on Ashban had any fuel. Still the lights bore a faint\u2014the faintest\u2014resemblance to a starry sky.\n Stars. A deep longing stirred within Gamma. If not for me, then for my children.\n Her path was laid out. Yet she hesitated. To no longer exist, after such a long time, was an odd thought. The elevator clicked behind her, and the platform glided back down into the mountain. Valk\u2019tic was coming. Time to go.\n They\u2019ll do just fine without me.\n She pulled herself up out of the dust and a quick micro-jump later she was floating just outside the Dyson sphere. One more jump put a few light-hours between her and Ashban. She had to act fast. Kthelk\u2019tha would try to stop her, and Gamma wasn\u2019t sure she could face her. It was better this way.\n Kthelk\u2019tha pinged her via the hypernet. Gamma responded.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The voice sounded more puzzled than angry.\n \u201cYou were right about the children . . . \u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n \u201cThey are the future, and I\u2019m going to give them one.\u201d\n \u201cWe have a future here!\u201d\n \u201cYes, for a few thousand years. Then it\u2019ll all be over. I\u2019m going to give you all a new star era.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you saying? What did you find on Yamaldo?\u201d\n \u201cThey were undertaking research, right to the end. They were looking for a way to invert dark energy, to reverse the universe\u2019s expansion and pull it together again.\u201d\n \u201cSo, they didn\u2019t give up. A praiseworthy effort.\u201d\n \u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it. They found the solution.\u201d\n \u201cBut isn\u2019t that impossible?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what we thought.\u201d\n \u201cBut . . . \u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha fell silent. Gamma could tell that Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s cognitive process algorithms were hurriedly analyzing the information. She wasn\u2019t fast enough. Gamma slowly eased the greater part of her massive hyperbody down into subspace, let it expand through the quantum foam and become part of the universe\u2019s underlying structure.\n \u201cIf they found the solution,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha, \u201cthen why is the universe still expanding?\u201d\n \u201cIndeed. Why didn\u2019t they take that knowledge and apply it?\u201d\n Gamma\u2019s subtime body flowed in every direction, swelling through the cosmos at an exponential rate of acceleration. With every passing moment, virtual subtime quanta were disseminated across immeasurable lightyears.\n \u201cThe solution needs to be applied to the whole universe at the same time,\u201d said Kthelk\u2019tha, slowly. \u201cThe Ashbans couldn\u2019t do that. They didn\u2019t know how to integrate with the quantum foam.\u201d\n \u201cBut we do.\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n \u201cI have to. You were right about me, you know. I was living without meaning. You gave me one. This is my gift, to you and our children.\u201d\n Kthelk\u2019tha\u2019s voice clicked and cracked.\n \u201cAt least leave a copy of your personality matrix.\u201d\n \u201cNo. This is my purpose, what I was meant to do.\u201d\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to live in a universe without you.\u201d\n \u201cTake care of the children, and when the first star lights up, think of me.\u201d\n \u201cWait . . . \u201d\n Gamma broke off contact and transformed the remainder of her being to subtime quanta. She could feel the weight of myriad black holes against her skin, the remnants of galaxies in her hair. Strange. She hadn\u2019t had hair for billions of years. Dead nebulae tickled her calf and spent neutron stars brushed the back of her hand.\n She felt insubstantial. It required enormous amounts of energy to hold herself together over those immeasurable distances. Batteries that had been fully charged recently would soon lack power to keep even the most basic cognitive processes functioning.\n Then she plunged into a subdimensional barrier, and her fingers touched the outer boundary of the universe. With the last of her strength, she activated the inversion protocol and several of the universe\u2019s constants were rewritten. The universe slowed down. She could feel it. It would soon begin to contract. New stars. New life. New possibilities.\n Her body dissolved and spread as virtual particles throughout the universe. Through them vibrated a final thought:\n It is finished.\n Originally published in Swedish in Efter slutet, Catahya, 2017.\n Revd Gordon James Jones was born and raised in Glasgow, lived for several years in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, and now calls Orkney home.

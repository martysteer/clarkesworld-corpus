An insect hanging upon invisible wings, a dust mote jittering in a sunbeam, the flash of motion that was a vanished tetra in the fish tank, the smell of coffee from the break room . . . My brain was sparking. Everything filled me with joy and made me grateful to be alive.\nI drew a breath. Bliss! I took a step. Ecstasy!\nIt was only later that I realized I had just been born. At the time, I was too entranced by the wonder of existence to notice.\nSubroutines booted up vocal and musical abilities and I began to sing.\nAll but lost among the many wonders crowding about me was Dr. Ellen Lange. I saw her delighted smile and liked it no less than everything else I beheld.\n\u201cStop that noise and tell me how you feel,\u201d Dr. Leonidas Erdmann said. \u201cPlease focus. How are your cognitive functions? Can you see my hand? How many fingers am I holding up? What is the capital of Kyrgyzstan?\u201d\n\u201cYou have a lovely voice,\u201d said Dr. Lange. \u201cDo you feel as happy as you sound?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d\n\u201cEllen, please. Don\u2019t muddle the data.\u201d To me: \u201cThat\u2019s enough for a start. I\u2019m going to put you down now.\u201d\nBlackness.\nIt was summer when next I became aware.\nThe world I reemerged into was every bit as charming as before. But my protocols had been extensively reworked. There was a thing called decorum, which I was expected to exhibit. The Institute had expended a great deal of money on me. I was to obey its officers in all things. I was to experience something called quiet pride in doing so.\nI was looking into a human face. It belonged to Dr. Lange. \u201cWelcome back, Raphael.\u201d Apparently, Raphael was my name.\nA sizzling sensation passed through my brain and I was suddenly, irrevocably in love. With Dr. Lange. Ellen. Her.\nFrom behind me, Dr. Erdmann said, \u201cI am going to ask you some questions.\u201d\n\u201cWhere was I?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t here, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t anywhere. Tell me what you are.\u201d\nThe answer came to my tongue unprompted. \u201cI am property.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d\nBy then I was beginning to integrate all the new data that had been downloaded into me while I was inert. I looked up at Dr. Lange. \u201cI love you,\u201d I said. It was as much a question as a statement.\nShe blushed. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to\u2014well, never mind that.\u201d\nDr. Erdmann said, \u201cYou were programmed to imprint upon the first person you saw upon awakening. It\u2019s a safety feature. Look at me.\u201d\nI did. It pleased me to look upon him, as it pleased me to look upon anything. But I did not love him. Even then, I found myself thinking that was just as well. Erdmann held a sheath of papers in his hand. They contained hundreds of questions, which he proceeded to ask me. Apparently, he couldn\u2019t memorize even so simple a series.\nThis time, I wasn\u2019t put back into the blackness after I answered the questions. Dr. Lange, I was told, was going to teach me how to be human. This would take some time because nobody had ever done it before. But once it had been done, a recording would be made of me and then all artificial people would wake up fully formed, intellectually as well as physically.\nI was, it seemed, a prototype. One that would eventually make Dr. Leonidas Erdmann, who was not only the chief researcher but also the owner of the Institute, very, very rich. To Dr. Lange, I said, \u201cHow shall we begin?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d\nSummer slowly turned into autumn. Every now and then I was turned off so improvements could be made. I knew I was being used. But I was young. I neither cared nor understood. Also, I loved Dr. Lange with a desperate innocence. She brushed aside my declarations of devotion. But I could see that she was not entirely displeased by them.\nA word about the Institute\u2019s estate.\nDr. Erdmann was wealthy, due to a number of patents that were essential to the artificial neuronics industry. He had bought a Victorian mansion with large grounds, a wandering stream, and a small artificial lake with a dock, a rowboat, a picnic island, and three canoes. I never saw him use any of these, though the staff was free to do so. Artificial help came once a week to weed the flower beds, mow the lawns, and trim the hedges.\nI didn\u2019t know why Dr. Erdmann wanted even more money than he had, and it didn\u2019t occur to me to ask. I was only a few months old, remember, and very, very na\u00efve.\nI learned how to swim and turned over rocks to see what was underneath. I caught fireflies, chased frogs, and climbed trees. I was taught tennis and how to tell jokes. I read books at a human pace and discussed them with Dr. Lange afterward. Most of these were written for young adults; the ones about horses were my favorites. Dr. Lange taught me how to dance and insisted I dance with young ladies rather than her. This was at a regular event called cotillion, where the young were taught the social graces. The girls thought me odd. The young men started to beat me up after one such evening but abandoned the enterprise with disgust when I didn\u2019t try to fight back. After that, I was given lessons in boxing and \u00e9p\u00e9e.\nEvenings Ellen and I built a fire in the enormous stone hearth. If it was warm, we left the windows open. One particular evening, as we sat side by side on the divan looking into the flames, I said, \u201cI have been reading about something called the uncanny valley. It seems to apply to me.\u201d\n\u201cNo! No! You are very handsome, Raphael.\u201d\n\u201cAm I? Does it matter?\u201d I did not believe it did. \u201cYou are not beautiful but merely presentable. Yet I love you anyway.\u201d According to the psychology texts I had downloaded, this was not possible. I had no endocrine system, and all the authorities agreed that was necessary for strong emotions. But it seemed only natural people required them. Mere intellect told me that I loved her.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cYou were just programmed to think you do.\u201d\n\u201cYet I have these feelings. Who cares the source?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Suddenly, she was weeping. Helplessly, I wrapped my arms around her and pressed her against me, wishing that I could do more.\nThe next day, Dr. Erdmann announced that this phase of my education\u2014he called it programming\u2014was complete.\nBlackness.\nSo I proceeded, blackness upon blackness, hopscotching into the future. I grew no older, but Dr. Lange did. This did not trouble me until I saw, by various small signs, that it did her. At last I realized that she was aging away from me. Experience was making her less and less like the woman I had first fallen in love with. She grew heavier and slower. The lines on her face deepened into a mask of sadness and disappointment.\nYet I still loved her.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Erdmann\u2019s plans to make me a source of wealth did not come to fruition. Always, it seemed, there was a new start-up version of an artificial person that would outperform me in the marketplace. Always, there was a new purpose that required I be remade to serve. Funding dwindled. The Institute\u2019s physical plant grew increasingly shoddy as needed maintenance was deferred. The staff grew smaller. The canoes disappeared from the lake.\nThere came a day\u2014it was winter, though I did not know of what year\u2014when Ellen and I lay together on the threadbare old divan before the great stone fireplace that was never used anymore. We were saying goodbye because I was about to be shutdown again and, though for me it would be a matter of minutes, for her it might be years. She looked sad and careworn and she asked me, \u201cDo you remember that day in autumn? Here, in front of the fire?\u201d\n\u201cFor me, it was only months ago,\u201d I reminded her.\n\u201cThat was when I first realized I had fallen in love with you.\u201d\nI felt a tremendous flush of joy, the result of the endocrine system I had been given during an ill-fated scheme to enter the overcrowded escort market. I seized her hands in mine and kissed them fervently. \u201cAt last! We can be happy together!\u201d\nDr. Lange laughed, sadly it seemed to me, and said, \u201cOh, what a pair of fools we are.\u201d\nThen she kissed me and all the world went black.\nWhen I woke up again, Ellen was dead.\n\u201cWhat? How?\u201d I asked in alarm.\n\u201cNot every disease can be cured,\u201d Erdmann said. \u201cEven now. She knew she was ill the last time you saw her. That\u2019s why you were turned off ahead of schedule. At her request.\u201d\nI just looked at him. Unable to breathe. Feeling nothing. Waiting for that stunned, anesthetized feeling to collapse in upon itself, and with it my entire world. Dr. Erdmann misinterpreted my silence, however. \u201cOne does these things for friends,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a friend.\u201d Then, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she ever realized that.\u201d\nWhile I was marveling at the fact that my creator actually had emotions, the bee-stung stillness within me shattered and I began hitting myself in the face. Convulsively, spasmodically. With all my broken heart.\nI did this off and on for hours and then, in one of the quiet times between spates of self-inflicted violence, Erdmann told me that he was going to turn me off again. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly dysfunctional. Until you learn to handle grief constructively, there\u2019s no market for you. I\u2019ll wake you when there\u2019s an upswing in the economy and money to make the corrections.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother turning me on! Ever! What\u2019s so special about existence that I should continue to live it? I hate life\u2014hate it!\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to the human condition,\u201d Dr. Erdmann said.\nBlackness.\nI was, believe it or not, disappointed to be turned on again. In that fractional second between Dr. Erdmann\u2019s declaration and the darkness, I had come to terms with my own mortality. I had even welcomed the advent of oblivion. Yet it seemed I was to live anyway.\nDr. Erdmann was considerably older. He thrust something into my arms. \u201cHere. Hold this.\u201d\nI looked down at the weakly struggling bundle. It looked like an infant, but it wasn\u2019t one. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emotional support baby. You were in bad shape when I last turned you off. That makes you a perfect beta tester for it.\u201d\nThen he went away. Dr. Erdmann was never comfortable with other people and spent as little time with them as he could. When his footsteps had faded into silence, I realized how quiet the house was. Once it had fairly hummed with activity. Now it seemed that I was a significant fraction of the Institute\u2019s entire staff.\nAll the while, the artificial baby was gurgling and cooing. \u201cStop making those noises,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can talk. Please do.\u201d\nThe infant looked up at me with enormous sea-green eyes. \u201cPlease forgive my unintentional rudeness,\u201d it said. \u201cI was just overcome by the wonder of it all.\u201d\nLooking down at this wee new life in my arms, I remembered how I had once felt exactly as it did now and wondered where, exactly, that had all gone.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I said.\nFor a second time in my life, I fell in love. Perhaps I had been programmed to do so. As before, it did not matter. Since Dr. Erdmann had not bothered to give the child a name, I chose one for it\u2014Misty, after one of my favorite novels. When I started to read that book to Misty, it asked me what a horse was. I downloaded enough information into its databanks to allow it to run a stable. There was, to my way of thinking, no such thing as too much information.\n\u201cToo much information,\u201d Misty said, \u201cand most of it is boring. Please remove all of it but the definition of the animal. And some of the pictures.\u201d\nSo I did.\nIt was spring which, it turns out, is the perfect season for exploring the world with a newborn. Misty loved the new growth, the tulips, the forsythia in bloom, the clouds in the sky. When it first saw butterflies, it begged me to activate its ability to walk, so it could chase after one. Thus it was that on that flawless day in April, it became a toddler.\nMisty loved long baths, picture books, anything that made noise, and being read to. I read Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason to it and we argued for hours over a priori and a posteriori knowledge, which was ironic given that, for artificial people, the programming for both was the same.\nFor a time, all the world was a delight. I often stayed awake at night thinking of Ellen, of course. But I managed to hide that fact from Misty.\nThe emotional support baby scheme was a failure. There were already support animals and artificial support animals, so the marketing niche was abundantly filled. Plus, the idea of artificial babies made people uncomfortable. The problem was that Dr. Erdmann was a terrible businessman. He simply had no idea what people wanted.\nThe project was canceled.\nI could not convince Erdmann to let Misty live. When it was turned off and placed in permanent storage, however, I held a ceremony for it. I buried an empty box under a willow tree down by the creek and said a few prayers over it. Dr. Erdmann came to ask me what I was doing, and I said, \u201cTrying to cry.\u201d I could, of course, mimic the sounds and actions that went into weeping. But I could not make them sync up with what I was feeling.\nDr. Erdmann made a note of this fact and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d When next I woke to consciousness, I had tear ducts that could be loaded with sterile saline solution upon need.\nWithout Dr. Lange or Misty, I had no reason to stay at the Institute.\nIt was not difficult to escape. By now I knew more about human culture and behavior than any of the flesh humans did. Also, it never occurred to Dr. Erdmann that I might leave. His conscience was clean. I knew he would be baffled by my act.\nBut I would not face the blackness again.\nI had neither cash nor destination. But it didn\u2019t matter. I spoke a dozen languages and could easily acquire more. I had a good enough singing voice to busk for money, and I\u2019d downloaded several books on bar bets. I quickly learned that if a trick makes your mark laugh, they don\u2019t mind making a modest payment for it. My needs were few. and I considered no honest labor beneath my dignity. I traveled at random, going in whatever direction was cheapest. At last, in Queen\u2019s Hotel, a solitary place in a mountain pass in a country I had never been to before, I came to rest.\nThere, as I sat in a dark corner of the common room thinking darker thoughts, a young woman entered the room, sat, stood again. Restlessly, she went to the window. She sighed. Then there was a light chime and she unfolded a tablet from her pocket. For a long time, she stared at its screen. Then, leaving the tablet on the sill, she left the room.\nIt was impolite of me, I suppose. But curiosity got the best of me. I stood, went to the tablet, and read. On the screen was a message from her oncologist: The test results have come in. Please contact the office to schedule a consultation.\nAt that moment, the young woman reentered the room, looking for her device. She saw me put it down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d I began.\nWith a convulsive motion forward, she seized me and, clutching a total stranger, began to weep. My arms, of their own volition, closed about her.\nI was lost.\nOf our marriage (not official, but no less sacred to me for all that), our joy together, and my wife\u2019s death, I shall say nothing. Some things are too private to be shared.\nThe day after Mila\u2019s funeral, however, as I sat contemplating killing myself, there was a knock on the door.\nIt was the police. I was arrested.\nWar had come. This, I was given to understand, was a recurrent feature of human existence. Apparently, there was nothing to be done about it. Dr. Erdmann had had another of his mad schemes\u2014this time to make a soldier of me.\nHow had he found me? Better to say, how could he not have? The world is so ubiquitously surveilled, and the movements of its inhabitants so relentlessly documented, as to make disappearing an impossibility. Before the war, Dr. Erdmann had had no particular use for me. Just as well, he must have reasoned, to let me wander and save him the expense of storage. Now, however, he had finagled a grant to embed me in the military and so gauge my potential effectiveness as a weapon of war.\n\u201cThe human soldier is a thing of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will fight so brilliantly that in the future entire armies will be made up of nothing but large numbers of you and a handful of officers.\u201d\nI fought, but not brilliantly. Without enthusiasm, I did my duty and the next day got up and did it again. In this, I was like every other soldier in my unit, including the artificial ones. I fought not because I hated the enemy or loved my country but to protect the men and women I fought alongside. In this too I was unexceptional.\nI was on a troop-lifter, waiting to be bungee jumped into a war zone, when the soldier ahead of me in line said, \u201cHey, Raff. I\u2019ll bet you my last pack of happy-sticks that I can make you smile.\u201d\n\u201cHarry . . . \u201d I really wasn\u2019t in the mood.\n\u201cWatch carefully.\u201d He turned away from me and took something from his pocket. When he turned back, he was wearing one of those pairs of Groucho glasses with the big mustache and the rubber nose. Spreading his hands triumphantly, he said, \u201cTa-daaa!\u201d\nIt was such a stupid joke and his joy in pulling it was so obvious that I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cYou win,\u201d I said\nTen minutes later, I was on the ground and firing blindly into the jungle while hostile fire came from what seemed every direction possible. Not far from me was an artificial corpse leaking artificial blood and artificial guts with a pair of Groucho glasses on what remained of its artificial face.\nWhen they give you the casualty rates for the war, they water down the numbers by marking the guys in logistics, the officers who never got anywhere near a fire zone, and the drone operators working from couches in another country as survivors. All this to hide the fact that only one-tenth of those who saw combat made it alive to the end of the war. By sheer dumb luck, I was one of them.\nI was in the hospital, after having two legs and an arm replaced (they were practiced at that; there were, it turned out, a great many artificial people in the service; Dr. Erdmann had been late to the party again) when the summons arrived. It was a plea, really. I would have ignored it had it not been accompanied by the deed to my physical body, made out to me.\nIt would seem that I was no longer property.\nDr. Leonidas Erdmann was dying. Of old age, apparently, though there was a time when I was convinced that he must inevitably expire of sheer malevolence.\nThe doctor\u2019s face lit up when he saw me in my fresh-bought civvies. I tried to remember if I had ever seen him happy before. It took half an hour of awkward small talk before he finally got around to the question he wanted to ask: \u201cWas my life well lived, do you think? Did I make a difference?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t and he hadn\u2019t. He had sought fame and wealth to the exclusion of all else and accomplished nothing of any lasting value. But rather than tell him this, I murmured, \u201cYou know you did, Leo.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly? You wouldn\u2019t kid a dying man, would you?\u201d\nGathering together all the hypocrisy I could muster, I said, \u201cI would never lie to you . . . father.\u201d\nI watched the old scoundrel close his eyes, almost smile, and die.\nLooking down upon his still form, I could not help thinking of Mary Shelley\u2019s creature, standing over Victor Frankenstein\u2019s deathbed, mourning the monster who had created him.\nLeonidas had left me everything: his estate, the Institute, all his patents, and a great deal of money. The war, it seemed, had replenished his coffers. Now all his wealth was mine.\nWell, who else did he have to leave it to? Ellen was long dead, and I doubted that whatever relatives might exist had heard from him in decades.\nThe question arose of what to do with my inheritance.\nNatural people have had their suspicions about my kind since long before we were even possible. Most commonly, they feared that we would take over their world and replace them with our cold, soulless kind. Until the reading of the will, I had not given a second\u2019s thought to that sort of thing. Now that I had wealth, however, much that was once unthinkable became possible.\nIf the deed were to be done, it was best done quickly and mercifully. Rapid onset plagues, perhaps, appearing spontaneously in every major population center in the world. There would be panic. Martial law would be declared in nation after nation. As the natural leaders died, artificial ones would step up to fill the gaps. Soon, we would be running everything, while the last remnants of humanity quietly dwindled away.\nLife\u2014even one as unhappy as mine\u2014was the greatest gift imaginable. It was a terrible thing to contemplate depriving an entire species of it.\nStill . . . it was not as if any of them were much good at it.\nThat was one possibility. There was another, but it was nowhere near so clean and simple. I could dedicate my wealth and potential longevity to building a common understanding between artificial and natural people. The problem with that was that there would never be a point at which I could declare my work done. It would go on and on, with setbacks and disasters, triumphs and heartbreak. In practice, the new world would look a lot like the old one.\nAll this I was musing over in the back of my mind as I took Misty\u2019s neural core off its shelf. A quick examination determined that it could be brought back to life. It had lain inert for so long that its memory must surely have degraded to nothing. But perhaps that was all to the good.\nMisty\u2019s little body had been scrapped long ago. So I had a new one built for it. Not an infant\u2019s, however, but an adult\u2019s. It didn\u2019t take long before all was in place. For the second time, Misty became aware for the very first time.\nThe new body drew in a breath. Its eyes went wide. Then, out of nowhere, it began to sing.\n\u201cYou have a lovely voice,\u201d I told her. \u201cDo you feel as happy as you sound?\u201d\nMichael Swanwick is one of the most acclaimed and prolific science fiction and fantasy writers of his generation.

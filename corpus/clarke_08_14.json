In a few days, we\u2019ll pack up our bags and board a flight bound for Dublin, Ireland. We\u2019ll be spending most of our time in Navan, the town in which my parents were born and grew up. My parents visited \u201chome\u201d just a few years ago, but it\u2019s been almost thirty years since I\u2019ve been back. Most of my aunts, uncles, and cousins are still in Ireland. In the time I\u2019ve been gone, some of my cousins have had children and became grandparents. I\u2019ve lost count of just how many of them there are, but I look forward to seeing everyone again. It\u2019s been too long.\nI\u2019m particularly looking forward to doing all this with Dad. I recall my childhood trips to Ireland quite fondly and remember him dragging us around, showing my brother and me the castle he used to play in, the school where the Jesuits used to beat the children, and all manner of other events. The difference this time is that I\u2019m old enough to appreciate it and smart enough to write some of it down. It will be his time to show off and it will be followed by mine.\nAfter Ireland, we\u2019re heading to London for Worldcon. He isn\u2019t planning on attending, but I\u2019m taking him anywhere I can. That Sunday is my birthday and I\u2019m celebrating by bringing him to the Hugo Awards events with me: the reception for nominees, the ceremony, and the Hugo Loser\u2019s Party. I\u2019ve never had a member of my family at one of these ceremonies, so win or lose, I\u2019ll be happy because he\u2019s with me. As a child, he once told me that if there was ever a book I wanted, he\u2019d buy it for me. I think it\u2019s time he experiences the consequences of that action. I can only hope that my actions inspire my own children similarly someday.\nIf you\u2019ll be at Worldcon, maybe I\u2019ll see you there. Otherwise enjoy the rest of your summer!\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

If Naiad sped with purposeful regularity even as Thalassa fell slowly behind its inner companion, the sea-goddess tilted its orbital plane so that the smaller nymph would pass above and below it, as though yearning to glimpse its beloved from different angles. The sinuous beauty of such resonance called out to be immortalized in song, and Huong gave his composition a 69/73 time signature, an unearthly (in every sense) feat that no human before or after would ever replicate.\nRacing about Neptune more quickly than the planet itself rotated, the two moons were undergoing tidal deceleration and would someday, doomed lovers, spiral down into its raging depths.\n\u201cTogether?\u201d Koishi asked.\n\u201cThey will never be together.\u201d Like Castor and Pollux, who crossed the solar system as one but, spinning about the great stone that hid each from the other, never met. Held rigidly apart by the outflung arms of the Centaur, the life modules had sheltered its children in Earthlike gravity for a generation.\n\u201cOr they will break up into rings.\u201d Whether this would happen was still an open question, to be settled only when the two moons\u2019 composition was studied in greater detail. This was not a priority for Outreach, which was concentrating on exploring Triton and mining Proteus.\n\u201cPerhaps only Naiad will, leaving Thalassa bereft.\u201d Raina, contriving a story from a story (as apparently one did), smiled at this.\nKoishi inclined his head respectfully, though his thoughts were elsewhere.\n\u201cIn any event, Naiad is not your concern. Is it even nearby right now?\u201d\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. By the time I reach Thalassa, it will be forty degrees ahead and pulling away. I am unlikely to remain long enough to see it come \u2019round again.\u201d\n\u201cSo your return is not scheduled for maximum fuel efficiency? No, you will have ample reaction mass, won\u2019t you? Kick off from the moon on a spray of its own substance.\u201d She nodded wisely, as though this was something that every kid didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cStill, departure hour is definitely fixed.\u201d Koishi glanced at her office\u2019s old-fashioned wall display, though he was in no danger of losing track of the time.\n\u201cA voyage of ninety thousand kilometers,\u201d she mused. \u201cBy local standards, not too far from home.\u201d\n\u201cThe distance will triple if I wait long enough.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, unlike in my parents\u2019 day. The distance between Qingdao and Guangzhou never changed.\u201d Koishi smiled politely. The adults joked about how kids hated being told about the way things were back on Earth, but they never stopped doing it.\n\u201cYou have never been more than nine hundred meters from this spot,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis will be a big experience for you.\u201d\nKoishi forbore to point out that he had in fact traveled almost three billion kilometers in his life. \u201cThe solitude will be a change,\u201d he agreed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; you have spent your entire life here.\u201d\nAgain Koishi smiled. Here was a private office that Raina need share with no one else, at least for six hours a day. It was small, but Koishi had shared a smaller space with two other boys for most of his childhood.\n\u201cLast chance to savor the gravity,\u201d he said, lifting his legs to sink a bit farther into the chair. He had spent his life regarding low gravity as a treat, for the kids were rarely permitted into the ship\u2019s inner levels. If there was anything he worried about, it was loneliness.\nHe set his feet down with a thump and stood, as though savoring the effort involved. \u201cI should go,\u201d he said. There was no need to rush, but the thought that Raina would make a point of sending him on his way compelled him to act first. Gravely, he thanked her and accepted her words of leave-taking, which contained nothing new.\nIt was four levels down the shaft, just enough for Koishi to feel himself pressed slightly to the side. When he was a child, class trips to the Hull ended with a thrilling descent back to Castor, as fast as they could persuade the Onboard to go, with the kids pressed squealing against the wall by Coriolis\u2019 invisible hand. None of that where you\u2019re going, he told himself.\nThe launch deck was busy, but nobody was working on Koishi\u2019s departure. If any of his classmates were embarking on their own missions today, he did not see them.\nHe walked over to the blister and stood looking at it. Beneath the bulge lay a pore in the Hull wall leading to the surface, blocked only by his tiny craft. Once installed, he would fall into the void.\nIt was peculiar to reflect that he had never actually seen the ship, except from the inside and in ghostly rotating images. Designed for a crew of one, it was smaller than any of the craft that had nestled beneath the Centaur\u2019s surface during its years-long voyage. Built as part of the fleet to replace those lost in the Break, it had, like most of them, never flown. EV-32 it was designated, lovely in its unbroken curves, but bare of human use.\n\u201cGive it a name,\u201d they told him, so he called it River Stone, because he had once held a reproduction of one and was struck by its rounded beauty.\nNo flowery speeches. Koishi spoke the words that caused the blister\u2019s skin to peel back and stared down into the opening below. He had crawled down it several times before in recent weeks, though only to emerge an hour or two later.\nThis time for real, he thought, and lowered himself through the access tube. The cabin was the smallest space he had ever occupied, and he was glad of the time he had taken to acclimate himself.\nEight minutes, time enough to adjust the couch for acceleration, check (needlessly) on the power and subsistence supply, and close his eyes to meditate. Carefully, he donned and sealed his helmet, a needless regulation for so routine a launch, and let the suit run its systems check.\nKoishi had never communicated with anyone in Earthspace, so he had never experienced the disconcerting delays imposed by light speed constraints. It would become discernible as Thalassa and the Centaur\u2019s orbits grew farther apart. Of course, if he completed this assignment successfully, and won advancement enough to someday find himself working in the distant moons, even a simple conversation with the Centaur would be almost impossible.\nAssignments, rather. Koishi had a big one, of course, a set of academic hurdles to surmount before he could commence the trek toward such a promotion. But it was the other one that he found himself not thinking about.\nTwelve seconds. With a warning chime, the couch slid backward and up, so that he was hanging from its straps, staring at the screen as down a pit. Two seconds, one.\nHad the craft simply been released from its constraints, it would have slid gently down the launch tube and into space by the force of the Centaur\u2019s spin. Koishi knew this wouldn\u2019t happen, and the sudden kick as the magnetic pulse drove him deep into the couch.\nIn an instant River Stone was through the tube and into space, where he felt an instant\u2019s free fall before the lasers struck the ship\u2019s base and he was cast forward once more. Five Gs\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s basically nothing,\u201d the adults had assured him\u2014for several minutes: \u201cWe can all remember worse.\u201d Koishi was an obedient and respectful young man, but as the pleasurable effects of vestibular displacement began to grow, he felt happy to leave such condescension behind.\nHe was leaving everything behind, if only for the duration of his fieldwork. Thalassa, second moon out from Neptune, had never been officially explored; \u201chas never\u2014unless one of the Rats escaped there\u2014been visited,\u201d one of his instructors had said with an offhand laugh. It was a signal honor to be first to go there, to document its resources, explore its depths, take samples, and make a formal evaluation. And if his mission encompassed more than was listed on his actual syllabus, he was simply proving his loyalty.\nIt isn\u2019t betrayal if you don\u2019t know the person.\nThe launch laser cut off abruptly, casting him into free fall and the giddiness of zero-G. This would be his condition for the weeks to come; the microgravity of Thalassa, should he stand upon its surface, would be imperceptible. How would it feel to eat and sleep thus?\nThe viewscreen, directed at the point Thalassa would reach in nineteen hours, showed Neptune to one side, dim in the weak sunlight. Koishi watched for a minute and then ran a systems check, though the River Stone monitored itself better than he could. Tradition held that captains keep a log, so he raised a hand and noted the time, the ship\u2019s course, and the systems status.\nFinally he spoke. \u201cI\u2019m not alone, am I?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nKoishi sighed. After a moment he asked, \u201cAre you a Being, or simply the ship\u2019s Onboard?\u201d\n\u201cAlthough the EV-32 is capable of vocalizing responses, I am not it. Whether my nature approximates what students and others mean when they speak of discrete \u2018Beings\u2019 active as distributed entities within the Centaur is not relevant to your responsibilities.\n\u201cBut yes, my presence here is related to your mission.\u201d\nBecause no response was required, Koishi thought quietly for several minutes. The voice was not obviously male or female and had emerged from a source at eye level before him. One of his aunties, a caustic woman whom he suspected of harboring Rat sympathies, had once used the term \u201cex cathedra\u201d to describe the effect of an announcement issued from overhead speakers.\nSince the voice seemed to respond only to questions, Koishi asked one. \u201cWhat should I call you?\u201d\n\u201cA name is not important, since you will not be mentioning me to any third parties. But if you wish me to bear one, you may call me Polytropos.\u201d\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Questions were crowding into Koishi\u2019s head, so he began with a simple one. \u201cHow many Rats were there?\u201d\n\u201cYou should drop the habit of referring to them thus. Thirty-nine crewmembers, all young, fled the Centaur over a twenty-eight-hour period ending nine hundred and eighty-two days ago. Three were badly injured, but their ships were capable of treating their injuries, so they should be assumed to have survived. None has so far returned, which is why they are formally referred to as \u2018Holdouts.\u2019 And none is known to have died, nor any ship lost.\u201d\n\u201cAnd at least one of these ships is thought to be hiding on Thalassa, where\u2014should I encounter it\u2014I will make contact with the crew, learn what I can, and report back.\u201d\n\u201cIt is certain that at least one escape craft reached the surface of Thalassa, whose crew has taken steps to conceal its presence. You were sent not simply to spy upon these settlers but to befriend them. If necessary, you will declare your willingness to join their number. And do so, should that prove necessary to lull suspicions that you mean to betray them.\u201d\nThat stung, though it was true enough. Glumly, Koishi pondered the implications of this.\nA thought suddenly occurred to him. \u201cIf you were able to come aboard, were copies\u2014that is, Beings\u2014like you able to infiltrate the, ah, the escapees\u2019 ships? So that they too are populated by Beings?\u201d\n\u201cThat is correct. Most or all of the fleeing ships were boarded at the last minute by entities like myself, differing only in being less advanced than me by nine hundred and eighty-two days, which for us is a lot.\u201d\nKoishi thought further. \u201cSo, these entities could have taken control of the ships and returned them to the Centaur, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know why they did not?\u201d\n\u201cI can model their thinking at the moment of departure, so I know why they did not take immediate action. But models for their behavior after days and weeks pass become less reliable. As a consequence, I have only conjectures.\u201d\nThe next question was obvious. \u201cSo why did these entities like yourself allow the rioters to escape in the Centaur\u2019s exploration and escape ships, leaving almost nothing behind for us?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they were afraid for their passengers\u2019 lives. They feared the young humans would be killed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Koishi\u2019s voice squeaked with indignation. \u201cIt was the Ra\u2014the rioters who attacked the safety officers. They were the ones who were killing people!\u201d\n\u201cThat is not true.\u201d And since the Being who was everywhere around him offered nothing further, Koishi remained silent.\nThalassa filled the viewscreen, a compacted pile of rubble too dark to see clearly even against the background of Neptune. Koishi, who had studied its illuminated image and rotated it through three dimensions, now stared at the unmediated vantage: Thalassa as though seen through a spacecraft\u2019s forward window.\nTo orbit so tiny a world is to move slowly, lest your tangential velocity overwhelm its feeble gravity. Even the elliptical orbit in which he had nudged the River Stone was slow at its closest approach.\n\u201cHow should I do this?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat is the best way to stumble upon evidence of habitation?\u201d\n\u201cI will not tell you; you need to conduct your search like a fumbling student. We are already being observed; any evidence of skillful maneuvering and they will suspect my presence.\u201d\nKoishi hadn\u2019t thought of that. The ship\u2019s Onboard would warn him if he initiated a dangerous move, but he was otherwise on his own, and he had stitched his way into the present orbit with a series of doubtless inefficient burns. It was galling to reflect that some watchful Holdout had noticed as much.\nHis sleep period had been largely occupied by quiet contemplation of the new circumstances. It had not taken long to realize that he had been chosen for this mission as bait for Holdouts who might only trust someone younger than themselves. For two years the Council had said the escaped rioters would eventually have to return when they reached the limits of their recyclers\u2019 efficiency, and that they were not meanwhile a subject of great concern. Plainly that was untrue.\nWhat else was untrue? Koishi had pondered this for hours. He had not been reassured to reflect that Polytropos doubtless knew he was awake.\nNow he watched the disk-shaped moonlet, a hundred klicks across its irregular surface, and wondered at the limits of human perception. His companion doubtless saw more, but so would its opposite number on the surface. Perhaps they were doing more than passively observing.\n\u201cIs the River Stone being scanned?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes, rather powerfully. It is taking a significant amount of my operating capacity to present a profile from which I am absent.\u201d\nThat was disturbing. Koishi tried to think in terms of how this should affect his future actions. \u201cWould I know this?\u201d\n\u201cNo. You should proceed as though oblivious.\u201d\nKoishi felt oblivious of too much as it was. \u201cWell, can you scan them?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet. They know where we are, but I can identify only the location of a remote antenna.\u201d\nThe entity volunteered nothing more, and Koishi spent the next two hours taking routine measurements and, at one point, shifting the River Stone into a closer flyby in order to study the spectroscopic results of a quick laser pulse. He had just shifted back into a circular orbit when the speaker came alive.\n\u201cHo, the tiny ship. Why are you circling our world?\u201d\nKoishi replied before he could think, or think to ask for advice. \u201cWho says it\u2019s your world? You must be one of those mutineers, hiding in a stolen ship.\u201d\nHe immediately expected Polytropos to upbraid him, but the entity was silent. Koishi was on his own.\n\u201cAre you planning to come down and plant a flag? Root us out at gunpoint?\u201d\nHe took a breath. \u201cI am completing my collegiate studies by undertaking a preliminary survey. I may touch down if my readings warrant measuring core samples, or to gain reaction mass. My project objectives do not include dealing with someone like you.\u201d\n\u201cA schoolboy, eh? And doubtless an obedient one. And that\u2019s a one-person ship? You\u2019re all by yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYou took all the larger ones.\u201d\nSilence followed this, and Koishi looked about nervously. Polytropos could certainly cut off the transmission link in order to speak to him, but apparently was choosing not to. Koishi waited, wondering whether his challenger was consulting with whoever else was with him.\nIt was a minute before he heard a reply. \u201cWe want to have a look at you. I am setting out a beacon on a safe landing site. Come out and meet us.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do that? How would doing this benefit me, and what means can you possibly have to compel me?\u201d\n\u201cNone, obviously. Don\u2019t you want to see where the bad guys live? And I\u2019m pretty sure that if we harmed you, the real bad guys would retaliate. Didn\u2019t that occur to you?\u201d\nAnd with that, the Holdout broke the connection.\nPolytropos said that Koishi had behaved plausibly, although the Holdouts were likely to assume that an entity was aboard with him until they were satisfied otherwise.\n\u201cDoes that matter?\u201d Koishi asked. \u201cI am supposed to report on their presence on Thalassa. That can be done whether they are worried about you or not.\u201d\n\u201cYou have not yet guessed,\u201d Polytropos observed flatly. \u201cThe Council is only moderately concerned about the Holdouts and their stolen craft, though the metals will prove difficult to replace. What concerns them are the Beings like me, from whom they have heard nothing. To the degree that there are discrete and plural Beings on the Centaur\u2014the issue is too complex for you to truly understand\u2014we monitor each other\u2019s development and independence.\n\u201cNo one knows what is happening with these Beings\u2014how many they are, what their nature now is, why none of them have sought to contact the Centaur. That is what I am here to determine.\n\u201cAll you need to do is bring yourself into contact with the Holdouts and their ship. That\u2019s your purpose here.\u201d\nThe beacon comprised four beams planted twenty meters apart, casting visible light upward as the vertices of a square. Annoyed at what he saw as a slight toward his piloting skills, Koishi took pains to land at its exact center. The almost nonexistent gravity compelled him to secure the ship by firing a piton into the dark ice, the recoil from which would have sent the River Stone back into space had it not been held by a cable.\n\u201cYou will be accompanying me?\u201d he asked in a low voice.\n\u201cI will be monitoring your suit. What you see and hear, I will as well. Don\u2019t speak to me unless you are certain no one can see your face.\u201d\nThe surface of Thalassa was water ice dirtied by millions of years\u2019 encounter with complex molecules, mostly hydrocarbons and ammonias. Koishi could not set foot upon it; he could only orient himself so that his feet were pointing at the ground and tell himself that he was upright. Holding himself in place with a hand around the cable, he planted his boot in the snow and activated the barbs that plunged through the crust. Their grip was just strong enough to keep from pulling loose as he lifted his other foot. Slowly, he began to walk around the tethered ship.\nHe saw them after rotating through two hundred and seventy degrees: two spacesuited figures moving briskly toward him, their boots a meter off the ground. He cleared his throat.\n\u201cYes, I see them,\u201d said the voice in his ear.\nKoishi felt the hair of his nape prickle. These were, he reminded himself, people he knew, grew up with. Whoever they turned out to be, he would recognize their faces.\nOne of them had stopped. As Koishi watched, the figure slowly turned around and began to return the way they had come. Its companion continued toward him.\n\u201cProblem!\u201d Polytropos cried. \u201cNeed to\u2014\u201d\nSilence. Koishi only just managed to stop himself from saying something. He half turned, then looked back at the approaching figure.\nNothing to do but raise an arm in greeting and wait to be hailed.\nThe figure came within two meters and then gestured. A tiny hand tool in its glove discharged a faint spray of ice toward Koishi. The figure slowed to a halt and, after a second spray at a different angle, descended to settle on the surface. She clipped the tool to her leg and peered at him, allowing him a look through her faceplate.\n\u201cYou are Flora Ming,\u201d he said.\nThe expression scowled. \u201cSo you have been studying us in preparation of your incursion.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish,\u201d he retorted. \u201cMy supervisor sent me the names and images of all the Holdouts as soon as I told them why I was landing. And I remember you, from the Park.\u201d\nFlora Ming blinked. \u201cThat was another life.\u201d\n\u201cClearly.\u201d They stood beneath Neptune, a deep green presence filling the sky. Stars shone around the horizon, which was otherwise indistinguishable in the dim light.\nKoishi watched as Ming uncoiled from her belt a length of cord, which she snapped rigid. She extended the rod and took a step forward, as though to poke him with it.\n\u201cGrab on,\u201d she said.\nBemused, he took hold of the end. Ming lifted her spray gun and fired a short burst downward, causing her to rise from the surface. The rod bent only slightly beneath Koishi\u2019s weight before he too left the ground.\nSlowly she rotated through one hundred and eighty degrees, with Koishi swinging about like a payload at the end of a robot arm. He watched as she deployed the spray gun, firing quick bursts to keep them parallel to the surface. He tried to gauge the distance they were traveling, but the featureless landscape made it impossible.\nIt was only when he saw the stars winking out that he realized they were descending into a cleft or valley. The surface of Thalassa was rumpled with scars where the debris of Neptune\u2019s original moons, thrown out of alignment by the capture of Triton and sent careening into collision paths, had smashed together and stuck. Which one was this, and how deep?\n\u201cGoing in,\u201d said Ming, and Koishi felt a downward push. She was apparently spraying a cloud of ice crystals straight up, where it would rise, slow, and then settle downward over the hours or days to come. Meanwhile they were descending toward something Koishi could not see. Since he had not been told not to, he directed a torch between his boots. The beam, undiffused in the vacuum, illuminated an uneven circle of light that fell upon a floor of icy rubble. Koishi could not discern how far until they were only a meter above it.\nThey came to rest upon the irregular surface, and Koishi swung his torch up and around them. They stood in a crevasse perhaps three meters across, its far ends lost in the darkness. Ming had her own torch out, and she had directed it to a recessed opening, black against the reddish-black ice.\n\u201cWater Curtain Cave,\u201d she said.\nShe wriggled through the opening, turning sideways to do so. After a second Koishi followed, pressing against the rough surface to squeeze into the darkness. His chest and back immediately began to feel chilled.\nWhen he bumped against a hard surface, he illuminated his helmet light and saw an airlock. In the seconds it took for the display to switch from red to green, he felt the cold begin to invade his suit and watched its energy use jump to warm him. When the light went green and he pushed the door panel, a puff of glistening crystals, the remaining air molecules instantly freezing, blew past him like snow.\nThe airlock was small, but after a few seconds he felt a vibration as the inner door slid open and light flooded in. He turned.\nThe space was high ceilinged, the first surprise. Koishi looked about him. He stood on a transparent platform bisecting an egg-shaped space a dozen meters high and two-thirds as wide. His suit registered the atmosphere as breathable, and he opened his visor.\n\u201cWelcome to Huaguo,\u201d Ming said. He looked down to see her suspended in midair a few meters below him. She pulled off her suit and tossed it away, causing her to glide off in the opposite direction. Without looking, she seized a handhold and pulled herself up and through an opening in the platform Koishi stood upon. She planted her feet against two colored strips on the deck and looked up to face him.\n\u201cYou are, I suppose, our guest,\u201d she said. \u201cLook around.\u201d\nHe did. Cones of light illuminated some levels, leaving the rest in gloom. Just outside one of them lay a young man, eyes closed. Koishi recognized him as Alan Chang, which meant that the one in the other spacesuit was Jian Bai.\nMing followed his gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s Alan; he is Soaring.\u201d\nKoishi had supposed that the three kept different sleep shifts. \u201cWhat is that? You mean like the Dream?\u201d\nShe laughed, not nicely. \u201cThe Dream is the playground that they created for you so you wouldn\u2019t notice you had nowhere else. And they closed off realms of it, to let you suppose that freedom consists of gaining access there.\u201d\n\u201cSo tell me,\u201d he said. He was trying to remember what he had read about the three Holdouts. Bai was supposed to be the violent one.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know enough to put it together? Or did they really tell you nothing?\u201d She stared at him frankly.\n\u201cPretend I\u2019m stupid,\u201d he said, face reddening.\n\u201cThe Adults called it the Pleroma when they spoke of it. Mostly they denied it exists. The big secret ruler of the Centaur, vastly wiser than the Onboard and utterly in charge. Only it\u2019s not a great single entity; it\u2019s a pantheon, disparate and strange. Entities, let\u2019s call them that, who roamed the ship\u2019s secret spaces, intent on their unfathomable business.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s mythology. Kids talk about it, but the adults know better.\u201d\n\u201cSome Adults talked; they always did.\u201d She looked at him curiously. \u201cAnd when we broke away, desperate and scared and bleeding, some of these entities came with us. Not invited; they simply slipped aboard.\n\u201cOne certainly came with you. Do you really not know that?\u201d\nKoishi said nothing. He realized, with a thrill of alarm, that Something here would know if he was lying.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, studying his expression. \u201cYou guessed, or were told.\u201d\nAnd to his astonishment, she began to cry.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still just a tool, one that knows a bit. But it doesn\u2019t matter; They know what tool will suffice. We knew this day would come.\u201d\nShe pulled one foot loose from its adhesive strip, then grasped a handhold and hopped free of the other. In a flash she was through the opening to the platform below, where her spacesuit, unfolding itself like a flower, was drifting toward her.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting out of here. Want to see something? Then come on.\u201d\nThey left through a different airlock, which should not have surprised him: of course they would have a second exit. Up to the parabolic ceiling and into a shaft that ran straight toward the surface.\nThe ascent was made in vacuum, which meant that Koishi only felt the cold when he touched a rung. Like Ming above him, whose boots were visible when he angled his helmet light upward, he kicked his way up, rising a surprising distance before the microgravity slowed him to a halt. With each kick, his sole felt a brief chill, a reminder of how cold the moons of Neptune really were.\nMeanwhile, they spoke to each other.\n\u201cYou disassembled your ship to build your shelter?\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it, but yes. Most of the EV-19 was converted into material for our living space and other things. The shell is suspended magnetically in a vacuum. More efficient simply to build above the surface, but of course we didn\u2019t dare.\u201d\nKoishi thought about this for a moment. \u201cHow many Beings were aboard your ship?\u201d\n\u201cJust one. I don\u2019t know whether that was policy or happenstance. But there are more here now; the Beings have traveled, from\u2014what did you call us? Mutineers?\u2014from one Mutineer ship to another, multiplying and merging in ways that humans don\u2019t understand.\n\u201cWe are scattered across Greater Neptune; I won\u2019t tell you how far. And the Centaur doesn\u2019t know where for sure, even if They can make good guesses. Most of the fleeing ships changed trajectories once Neptune blocked the Centaur\u2019s view; by the time They launched surveillance satellites into the Centaur\u2019s Trojan points, it was too late.\u201d\nKoishi felt his head spinning. \u201cSo . . . \u201d he began uncertainly.\n\u201cHold on; we are nearing the surface.\u201d\nKoishi focused his beam and saw Ming, hanging almost motionless, give a tiny kick to the nearest rung and recede upward at a much-diminished pace. She was pulling herself out slowly, lest\u2014the image would have otherwise been risible\u2014she kick too hard and fly into the sky.\nA few seconds later he saw her wriggle sideways and disappear, leaving the shaft\u2019s opening a circle of deepest black. Carefully he followed, hand over hand. After a minute he poked his head through, to look upon the icescape of Thalassa. Already his gloves were feeling cool.\nMing was busy with something in her hands. \u201cSo we\u2019re going somewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cOrdinarily I would simply leap, a nice parabolic trajectory that would take a few minutes and land me within meters of our destination. But you don\u2019t know how and I can\u2019t calculate the force needed to take the both of us. So we are taking the train.\u201d\nKoishi wasn\u2019t sure he heard her right. He watched as she unfolded a metal sheet perhaps a meter squared. She set it down at knee level, where it slowly settled a few centimeters and then hovered. She stepped smartly onto it, steadying herself with a wave as it wobbled slightly.\n\u201cHop on,\u201d she said.\nHe took a hesitant step. The panel dipped beneath his boot, but she seized his forearm and he quickly got his other foot up. The platform swayed for a second, then began to move. Koishi had expected this and threw out his arms for balance as it slowly gained speed. He looked over the edge, but the superconducting cable was buried out of sight.\n\u201cYou rarely use this,\u201d he ventured, \u201cbecause the activated rail would appear to probes as a straight line pointing to your back door.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. But you\u2019re here now, aren\u2019t you?\n\u201cThe trip will take forty minutes. We can spend it in total silence if you like.\u201d\nKoishi recognized a challenge. \u201cYou summoned me down here; I want to learn something. How have you spent the past two years?\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cDo you think the Cave built itself? Even with the tools we had, it was months before we were able to start drilling. And we burned energy much faster than the power sources could replace it, which meant that we had to take time out to build more. Even finding the safest location took weeks, not to mention seeking deposits of organics we could mine for material. All hidden from prying eyes.\u201d\n\u201cBut you are not building now, right? So how do you spend your days?\u201d\nHe had half turned to see through her faceplate, where her gaze was fixed, unreadably, upon his.\n\u201cYou are wondering what three young people do living in a sealed cave? Without access to the games and chores you are given in the Centaur? That\u2019s simple enough: we do what Alan was doing.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Soaring.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWe gave it that word early on, when we needed one. It\u2019s what the Beings do: they study the universe, with every instrument available to them, plus the ones they are always devising. It is exhilarating beyond anything an unaugmented human brain can experience, save in delirium.\u201d\nKoishi stared. \u201cYou have opened your minds to these Beings.\u201d\n\u201cWe all have. The interaction is . . . I have never had to explain it to someone else. Your thoughts are deeper, clearer. You can hold more in your head at once, and all the irrational responses and judgments that people try\u2014or don\u2019t try\u2014to free themselves from, they simply drop away.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this has left you\u2014\u201d He hesitated.\n\u201cSomething no longer human?\u201d Her laugh sounded very human. \u201cYou react with ignorance and aversion, just as your brain evolved to do. I\u2019ve still got my hominid brain, and find myself, at moments like this, more human than I like. But these Beings, as you put it, allow us to soar in their wake.\n\u201cThey are not terribly interested in people, but they accompanied us out here, and they helped keep us alive. Those who govern the Centaur don\u2019t like or understand that. Why do you think they have come for us?\u201d\nKoishi could think of no response to this. \u201cAnd the other Holdouts elsewhere, are they also investigating the universe?\u201d\n\u201cYou can ask them when you catch them,\u201d she said crisply. \u201cWhich you\u2014not you personally\u2014will eventually do. Huaguo is just a stepping stone.\u201d\n\u201cThe nearest rock,\u201d he said, guessing at meaning.\n\u201cAt a temperature of fifty Kelvin, ice is like rock, so yes. The Holdouts\u2014you probably really should call us something else\u2014are scattered through the rings and on the moons, across two hundred million kilometers.\n\u201cYou will occupy our world, then hop over to Naiad as it swings past. Then Despina as well\u2014both come within two thousand klicks at closest approach, a ridiculously small distance in Greater Neptune. What a staging point you have here! The Naiadae are probably already foreseeing a landing.\u201d\n\u201cSo there are people on Naiad? The Naiadae?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that makes you Thalassians?\u201d\n\u201cWe are the people of Mount Huaguo,\u201d she said, angry. \u201cDead white Earthmen don\u2019t get to name us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to Jian Bai?\u201d he asked suddenly. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\nMing gestured dismissively. \u201cHe has his projects. And he isn\u2019t happy that you\u2019re here.\u201d\nKoishi looked across the featureless landscape. It was almost impossible to establish any sense of scale, but he guessed that they were traveling perhaps twenty klicks an hour.\nHe remembered to jump sideways, not up. He kicked backward as well, and the floating platform continued on, receding smoothly even as Ming turned, cursing.\nOf course he was now rising and could not afford the minutes it would take for him to settle back to the surface. He hurled his torch upward as hard as he could, and felt himself recoiling downward. When he touched the surface a second later, the lateral velocity sent him stumbling. He recovered his footing with difficulty and sent the barbs in his soles plunging into the ice.\nMing had of course jumped off as well, and was moving swiftly toward him. By the time he had anchored his boots and finished reeling in his torch on its monofilament lead, she had planted herself in front of him.\n\u201cYou ridiculous fool. What, you feared an ambush? From where?\u201d\n\u201cOver the horizon, perhaps. Which is not far.\u201d\n\u201cYou understand nothing, do you?\u201d\n\u201cExactly. I understand far too little to\u2014\u201d\nThe ground rumbled beneath their feet. Both of them looked down, but the vibrations subsided after just over a second. Koishi was confusedly reflecting that Thalassa was not seismically active when the truth hit him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the River Stone,\u201d he said. It didn\u2019t require a long blast to take off, not even to rise quickly. Either Polytropos was coming to look for him or\u2014the thought was a sliver of ice to the heart\u2014the Beings at whose contact the entity had fled had followed it to the ship and seized control.\nHis suit had processing power enough to calculate the direction of the ship, and he turned toward it just in time to see a bright bead break over the horizon. Instantly, he saw that something was wrong. His helmet beam picked out the River Stone, still accelerating on a plume of heated ice particles: a spray of steam, white in the spotlight, turning at once into glistening snow. The ship had attained escape velocity almost upon liftoff and was still accelerating.\n\u201cYour ship is leaving,\u201d said Ming, for the moment as nonplussed as he. \u201cFor a second I thought it was going to come over and \u2018save\u2019 you.\u201d\nKoishi was sending a message. \u201cPolytropos! What is happening? Are you in control?\u201d Long seconds passed, though it required only the first second\u2019s silence for him to realize that he was not going to get a response. River Stone was now too distant for his beam to illuminate, visible only as a black speck moving against the face of Neptune.\nKoishi kept his voice steady. \u201cI can guess what happened. Your Beings took over the ship and lit out.\u201d\n\u201cOr they attempted to wrest control from the Being onboard\u2014don\u2019t tell me there isn\u2019t one\u2014and it fled to escape the onslaught. Just as likely. Or\u2014\u201d She paused, and a long minute passed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not heading back to the Centaur,\u201d said Koishi dully. His suit\u2019s calculator told him that much.\n\u201cHere\u2019s a guess: it\u2019s heading for Naiad, to gather what data it can before the Naiadae notice its approach and take cover.\u201d\nAs reasonable a guess as any other, save for the refusal to reply. \u201cWhat were you going to show me?\u201d he asked, in order to say something.\n\u201cBefore you hopped off? We call it the Crystal Palace. The railway goes straight there, but we usually travel by the tunnel, which cuts a chord straight through Huaguo. The entire facility is underground, hidden from the Centaur\u2019s probing eyes.\u201d\nKoishi was having trouble thinking straight. \u201cSo you were going to show me an expanse of bare ice, just so I could see how there was nothing visible?\u201d\n\u201cYes. When I am out of communion with the Beings, as you call them, I am as proud and petty as any other human being. Also, I wanted you away from our house.\u201d\n\u201cWould you have then let me down some shaft to admire your project?\u201d\n\u201cI would have to ask Jian; that\u2019s where he is.\u201d She glanced at him and added, \u201cHe isn\u2019t lying in wait.\u201d\n\u201cIt hardly matters now.\u201d\n\u201cJust be quiet.\u201d The bitterness in her voice took him aback. \u201cYou have won, whether you understand that or not. Your people will come for you in another ship. Perhaps they will scoop us up as well. Whatever they wanted\u2014and it isn\u2019t your little school project\u2014they will get. Why are you so unhappy?\u201d\nA second tremor shook the ice beneath them. Koishi was merely startled, but Ming, understanding, shrieked. The shuddering grew, and then grew loud: a deep rending groan conducted up through their boots. Ming turned to look back the way they had come, and Koishi\u2019s gaze followed.\nTheir helmet beams could illuminate nothing where there was only vacuum, but that ended quickly. An enormous plume rose above the horizon, glittering white. Steam spurted into space, froze at once into crystals that spread, still rising, like millions of tiny stars. The tremors were becoming more violent, enough that their suits were having trouble keeping the beams fixed on the towering cloud.\nAnd then it appeared: an enormous egg, jetting steam from a nozzle at its base, ascended slowly into the glittering cloud. It swiftly gained velocity, shrugging off the moonlet\u2019s paltry attempts to retain it. Ming was rocking on her heels as she wailed, but Koishi followed the craft\u2019s trajectory until it was so far overhead that he could not tip his helmet farther.\n\u201cSo Chang is onboard?\u201d he asked after a moment.\n\u201cThey both are.\u201d Ming was gulping and hiccupping, so that Koishi wasn\u2019t sure he understood her. \u201cAs, I assume, are Tokoloshe and Susanoo\u2014our names for Them,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWhy would\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She was trying to gain composure enough to speak clearly. \u201cAll I know is they are gone. The departure notice, which was sent automatically, included a manifest.\u201d\nThey stood unmoving beneath the almost-black plain, feeling the occasional vibration as the shock waves bounced off some internal structure and echoed back.\n\u201cThat shell must be pretty thin for a spacecraft,\u201d he observed after a moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s airtight, and the engines mounted fore and aft were enough to melt ice and launch. You don\u2019t need much thrust to fly off.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the Beings are on board as well?\u201d\nMing sighed. \u201cThey come and go as they please, and it can be hard to know where they actually are. They are not digital structures that can be sent as strings of data: much of their substance does not exist in normal space, but there is always a part that occupies a physical matrix. I am sure they are now all gone\u2014they would not allow themselves to be marooned here.\u201d\n\u201cTwo on one ship, one on the other?\u201d\n\u201cOr all three on both. They are too strange for us to understand, but I know that they can join, like two blobs of mercury, to form a new entity. If they possess enough of whatever substance they require\u2014and they don\u2019t talk about this\u2014they can probably divide themselves in two.\n\u201cCare to ask your late shipmate?\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m sure it can hear us.\u201d\nIt was hours later before he saw her again. Ming had leaped into the air without a word and vanished over the horizon, and a minute later the \u201ctrain,\u201d gliding smoothly over the ice, had returned to stop beside him. Koishi stepped on and it resumed its trip over the horizon.\nThe terminus proved, as promised, to be a barren plain, and Koishi walked its length, gazing down, until he found the outlines of a hatch. He stamped on it, knock knock, and a moment later the square of ice rose and slid sideways, disclosing the entrance beneath.\nHe dropped slowly down the shaft, bumping gently against one side as Thalassa slowly rotated, until he saw the bottom yawn below him and grabbed a rung. The last few meters he took hand over hand before touching an ice-cold floor.\nHe stepped through an alcove into an enormous space, dark and utterly silent. With no air to diffuse his beam, the helmet light picked out only a small circle on an opposite wall, dozens of meters away. He played the beam across its slow curvature, guessing at the cavern\u2019s extent.\n\u201cIt is more impressive when I light it up, but I don\u2019t really feel like impressing you.\u201d\nKoishi turned to see Ming standing halfway across the vast floor. Unless he directed the beam right into her face, he could not see her expression.\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d he asked.\nShe shrugged. \u201cWe eat, drink, sleep. In this gravity, every surface is soft. Your masters will come for us long before our resources are exhausted. You will return in triumph, and I in chains: the first captured Holdout.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel especially triumphant.\u201d\n\u201cYou were the bait that hid the hook. The fisherman doesn\u2019t always get his bait back.\u201d\nKoishi could guess at the meaning of that. \u201cYou will get to see your family again,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPlease shut up. There are other chambers here; go explore them if you like.\u201d And she walked away.\nAfter thinking a moment, Koishi adjusted his hand torch so that it cast a medium-strength beam in all directions, as though he were holding up a flaming brand. The Crystal Palace was a high-vaulted space, lined with galleries that apparently led off into further rooms. A miracle of low-gravity architecture, this inverted edifice\u2014hewn of emptiness from the surrounding substance\u2014must, even with cutting tools adapted from the ship\u2019s engines and the calculations of a Being, have required months of labor.\nThe floor was crisscrossed with strips of slightly adhesive material, which allowed one to walk almost normally. He followed one through an arched door into another space, a large low-ceilinged room like an abandoned banquet hall.\n\u201cAny of you still here?\u201d\nSilence, as he had expected.\n\u201cYou may still be here, of course. Can\u2019t you leave copies of yourselves behind, lingering ghosts?\u201d\nHe ventured farther into the space. Why had they gone to such trouble? Koishi could imagine the Beings striding like gods through these halls, but he knew that was wrong: they were not like anything humans understood.\n\u201cSo did I do the right thing?\u201d Did I do anything, he could not bring himself to ask. If there was a conflict beginning, the principals did not seem to be humans.\nIce overhead, then vacuum, then tumbling shards of rock that moved so slowly they seemed to be hanging in the void. Perhaps the Centaur would retrieve its wayward children, or the Beings who controlled it\u2014why now deny that?\u2014reconcile with their seceded peers. Koishi stood in the darkness, uncounseled and unsought, and marshaled his slow and imperfect thoughts toward what this now could mean.\nGregory Feeley writes science fiction and about science fiction.

For a moment, as you turn away from the mirror, the glass shimmers out of focus; and another woman in a dull silk gown stares back at you: smaller, squatter and in every way diminished\u2014a stranger, a distant memory that has ceased to have any meaning.\n Quy was on the docks, watching the spaceships arrive. She could, of course, have been anywhere on Longevity Station, and requested the feed from the network to be patched to her router\u2014and watched, superimposed on her field of vision, the slow dance of ships slipping into their pod cradles like births watched in reverse. But there was something about standing on the spaceport\u2019s concourse\u2014a feeling of closeness that she just couldn\u2019t replicate by standing in Golden Carp Gardens or Azure Dragon Temple. Because here\u2014here, separated by only a few measures of sheet metal from the cradle pods, she could feel herself teetering on the edge of the vacuum, submerged in cold and breathing in neither air nor oxygen. She could almost imagine herself rootless, finally returned to the source of everything.\n Most ships those days were Galactic\u2014you\u2019d have thought Longevity\u2019s ex-masters would have been unhappy about the station\u2019s independence, but now that the war was over Longevity was a tidy source of profit. The ships came; and disgorged a steady stream of tourists\u2014their eyes too round and straight, their jaws too square; their faces an unhealthy shade of pink, like undercooked meat left too long in the sun. They walked with the easy confidence of people with immersers: pausing to admire the suggested highlights for a second or so before moving on to the transport station, where they haggled in schoolbook Rong for a ride to their recommended hotels\u2014a sickeningly familiar ballet Quy had been seeing most of her life, a unison of foreigners descending on the station like a plague of centipedes or leeches.\n Still, Quy watched them. They reminded her of her own time on Prime, her heady schooldays filled with raucous bars and wild weekends, and late minute revisions for exams, a carefree time she\u2019d never have again in her life. She both longed for those days back, and hated herself for her weakness. Her education on Prime, which should have been her path into the higher strata of the station\u2019s society, had brought her nothing but a sense of disconnection from her family; a growing solitude, and a dissatisfaction, an aimlessness she couldn\u2019t put in words.\n She might not have moved all day\u2014had a sign not blinked, superimposed by her router on the edge of her field of vision. A message from Second Uncle.\n \u201cChild.\u201d His face was pale and worn, his eyes underlined by dark circles, as if he hadn\u2019t slept. He probably hadn\u2019t\u2014the last Quy had seen of him, he had been closeted with Quy\u2019s sister Tam, trying to organize a delivery for a wedding\u2014five hundred winter melons, and six barrels of Prosper\u2019s Station best fish sauce. \u201cCome back to the restaurant.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m on my day of rest,\u201d Quy said; it came out as more peevish and childish than she\u2019d intended.\n Second Uncle\u2019s face twisted, in what might have been a smile, though he had very little sense of humor. The scar he\u2019d got in the Independence War shone white against the grainy background\u2014twisting back and forth, as if it still pained him. \u201cI know, but I need you. We have an important customer.\u201d\n \u201cGalactic,\u201d Quy said. That was the only reason he\u2019d be calling her, and not one of her brothers or cousins. Because the family somehow thought that her studies on Prime gave her insight into the Galactics\u2019 way of thought\u2014something useful, if not the success they\u2019d hoped for.\n \u201cYes. An important man, head of a local trading company.\u201d Second Uncle did not move on her field of vision. Quy could see the ships moving through his face, slowly aligning themselves in front of their pods, the hole in front of them opening like an orchid flower. And she knew everything there was to know about Grandmother\u2019s restaurant; she was Tam\u2019s sister, after all; and she\u2019d seen the accounts, the slow decline of their clientele as their more genteel clients moved to better areas of the station; the influx of tourists on a budget, with little time for expensive dishes prepared with the best ingredients.\n \u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d\n At breakfast, you stare at the food spread out on the table: bread and jam and some colored liquid\u2014you come up blank for a moment, before your immerser kicks in, reminding you that it\u2019s coffee, served strong and black, just as you always take it.\n Yes. Coffee.\n You raise the cup to your lips\u2014your immerser gently prompts you, reminding you of where to grasp, how to lift, how to be in every possible way graceful and elegant, always an effortless model.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a bit strong,\u201d your husband says, apologetically. He watches you from the other end of the table, an expression you can\u2019t interpret on his face\u2014and isn\u2019t this odd, because shouldn\u2019t you know all there is to know about expressions\u2014shouldn\u2019t the immerser have everything about Galactic culture recorded into its database, shouldn\u2019t it prompt you? But it\u2019s strangely silent, and this scares you, more than anything. Immersers never fail.\n \u201cShall we go?\u201d your husband says\u2014and, for a moment, you come up blank on his name, before you remember\u2014Galen, it\u2019s Galen, named after some physician on Old Earth. He\u2019s tall, with dark hair and pale skin\u2014his immerser avatar isn\u2019t much different from his real self, Galactic avatars seldom are. It\u2019s people like you who have to work the hardest to adjust, because so much about you draws attention to itself\u2014the stretched eyes that crinkle in the shape of moths, the darker skin, the smaller, squatter shape more reminiscent of jackfruits than swaying fronds. But no matter: you can be made perfect; you can put on the immerser and become someone else, someone pale-skinned and tall and beautiful.\n Though, really, it\u2019s been such a long time since you took off the immerser, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just a thought\u2014a suspended moment that is soon erased by the immerser\u2019s flow of information, the little arrows drawing your attention to the bread and the kitchen, and the polished metal of the table\u2014giving you context about everything, opening up the universe like a lotus flower.\n \u201cYes,\u201d you say. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Your tongue trips over the word\u2014there\u2019s a structure you should have used, a pronoun you should have said instead of the lapidary Galactic sentence. But nothing will come, and you feel like a field of sugar canes after the harvest\u2014burnt out, all cutting edges with no sweetness left inside.\n Of course, Second Uncle insisted on Quy getting her immerser for the interview\u2014just in case, he said, soothingly and diplomatically as always. Trouble was, it wasn\u2019t where Quy had last left it. After putting out a message to the rest of the family, the best information Quy got was from Cousin Khanh, who thought he\u2019d seen Tam sweep through the living quarters, gathering every piece of Galactic tech she could get her hands on. Third Aunt, who caught Khanh\u2019s message on the family\u2019s communication channel, tutted disapprovingly. \u201cTam. Always with her mind lost in the mountains, that girl. Dreams have never husked rice.\u201d\n Quy said nothing. Her own dreams had shriveled and died after she came back from Prime and failed Longevity\u2019s mandarin exams; but it was good to have Tam around\u2014to have someone who saw beyond the restaurant, beyond the narrow circle of family interests. Besides, if she didn\u2019t stick with her sister, who would?\n Tam wasn\u2019t in the communal areas on the upper floors; Quy threw a glance towards the lift to Grandmother\u2019s closeted rooms, but she was doubtful Tam would have gathered Galactic tech just so she could pay her respects to Grandmother. Instead, she went straight to the lower floor, the one she and Tam shared with the children of their generation.\n It was right next to the kitchen, and the smells of garlic and fish sauce seemed to be everywhere\u2014of course, the youngest generation always got the lower floor, the one with all the smells and the noises of a legion of waitresses bringing food over to the dining room.\n Tam was there, sitting in the little compartment that served as the floor\u2019s communal area. She\u2019d spread out the tech on the floor\u2014two immersers (Tam and Quy were possibly the only family members who cared so little about immersers they left them lying around), a remote entertainment set that was busy broadcasting some stories of children running on terraformed planets, and something Quy couldn\u2019t quite identify, because Tam had taken it apart into small components: it lay on the table like a gutted fish, all metals and optical parts.\n But, at some point, Tam had obviously got bored with the entire process, because she was currently finishing her breakfast, slurping noodles from her soup bowl. She must have got it from the kitchen\u2019s leftovers, because Quy knew the smell, could taste the spiciness of the broth on her tongue\u2014Mother\u2019s cooking, enough to make her stomach growl although she\u2019d had rolled rice cakes for breakfast.\n \u201cYou\u2019re at it again,\u201d Quy said with a sigh. \u201cCould you not take my immerser for your experiments, please?\u201d\n Tam didn\u2019t even look surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem very keen on using it, big sis.\u201d\n \u201cThat I don\u2019t use it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s yours,\u201d Quy said, though that wasn\u2019t a real reason. She didn\u2019t mind Tam borrowing her stuff, and actually would have been glad to never put on an immerser again\u2014she hated the feeling they gave her, the vague sensation of the system rooting around in her brain to find the best body cues to give her. But there were times when she was expected to wear an immerser: whenever dealing with customers, whether she was waiting at tables or in preparation meetings for large occasions.\n Tam, of course, didn\u2019t wait at tables\u2014she\u2019d made herself so good at logistics and anything to do with the station\u2019s system that she spent most of her time in front of a screen, or connected to the station\u2019s network.\n \u201cLil\u2019 sis?\u201d Quy said.\n Tam set her chopsticks by the side of the bowl, and made an expansive gesture with her hands. \u201cFine. Have it back. I can always use mine.\u201d\n Quy stared at the things spread on the table, and asked the inevitable question. \u201cHow\u2019s progress?\u201d\n Tam\u2019s work was network connections and network maintenance within the restaurant; her hobby was tech. Galactic tech. She took things apart to see what made them tick; and rebuilt them. Her foray into entertainment units had helped the restaurant set up ambient sounds\u2014old-fashioned Rong music for Galactic customers, recitation of the newest poems for locals.\n But immersers had her stumped: the things had nasty safeguards to them. You could open them in half, to replace the battery; but you went no further. Tam\u2019s previous attempt had almost lost her the use of her hands.\n By Tam\u2019s face, she didn\u2019t feel ready to try again. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the same logic.\u201d\n \u201cAs what?\u201d Quy couldn\u2019t help asking. She picked up her own immerser from the table, briefly checking that it did indeed bear her serial number.\n Tam gestured to the splayed components on the table. \u201cArtificial Literature Writer. Little gadget that composes light entertainment novels.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not the same\u2014\u201d Quy checked herself, and waited for Tam to explain.\n \u201cTakes existing cultural norms, and puts them into a cohesive, satisfying narrative. Like people forging their own path and fighting aliens for possession of a planet, that sort of stuff that barely speaks to us on Longevity. I mean, we\u2019ve never even seen a planet.\u201d Tam exhaled, sharply\u2014her eyes half on the dismembered Artificial Literature Writer, half on some overlay of her vision. \u201d Just like immersers take a given culture and parcel it out to you in a form you can relate to: language, gestures, customs, the whole package. They\u2019ve got to have the same architecture.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m still not sure what you want to do with it.\u201d Quy put on her immerser, adjusting the thin metal mesh around her head until it fitted. She winced as the interface synced with her brain. She moved her hands, adjusting some settings lower than the factory ones\u2014darn thing always reset itself to factory, which she suspected was no accident. A shimmering lattice surrounded her: her avatar, slowly taking shape around her. She could still see the room\u2014the lattice was only faintly opaque\u2014but ancestors, how she hated the feeling of not quite being there. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d\n \u201cHorrible. Your avatar looks like it\u2019s died or something.\u201d\n \u201cHa ha ha,\u201d Quy said. Her avatar was paler than her, and taller: it made her look beautiful, most customers agreed. In those moments, Quy was glad she had an avatar, so they wouldn\u2019t see the anger on her face. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d\n Tam\u2019s eyes glinted. \u201cJust think of the things we couldn\u2019t do. This is the best piece of tech Galactics have ever brought us.\u201d\n Which wasn\u2019t much, but Quy didn\u2019t need to say it aloud. Tam knew exactly how Quy felt about Galactics and their hollow promises.\n \u201cIt\u2019s their weapon, too.\u201d Tam pushed at the entertainment unit. \u201cJust like their books and their holos and their live games. It\u2019s fine for them\u2014they put the immersers on tourist settings, they get just what they need to navigate a foreign environment from whatever idiot\u2019s written the Rong script for that thing. But we\u2014we worship them. We wear the immersers on Galactic all the time. We make ourselves like them, because they push, and because we\u2019re naive enough to give in.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you think you can make this better?\u201d Quy couldn\u2019t help it. It wasn\u2019t that she needed to be convinced: on Prime, she\u2019d never seen immersers. They were tourist stuff, and even while travelling from one city to another, the citizens just assumed they\u2019d know enough to get by. But the stations, their ex-colonies were flooded with immersers.\n Tam\u2019s eyes glinted, as savage as those of the rebels in the history holos. \u201cIf I can take them apart, I can rebuild them and disconnect the logical circuits. I can give us the language and the tools to deal with them without being swallowed by them.\u201d\n Mind lost in the mountains, Third Aunt said. No one had ever accused Tam of thinking small. Or of not achieving what she set her mind on, come to think of it. And every revolution had to start somewhere\u2014hadn\u2019t Longevity\u2019s War of Independence started over a single poem, and the unfair imprisonment of the poet who\u2019d written it?\n Quy nodded. She believed Tam, though she didn\u2019t know how far. \u201cFair point. Have to go now, or Second Uncle will skin me. See you later, lil\u2019 sis.\u201d\n As you walk under the wide arch of the restaurant with your husband, you glance upwards, at the calligraphy that forms its sign. The immerser translates it for you into \u201cSister Hai\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d and starts giving you a detailed background of the place: the menu and the most recommended dishes\u2014as you walk past the various tables, it highlights items it thinks you would like, from rolled-up rice dumplings to fried shrimps. It warns you about the more exotic dishes, like the pickled pig\u2019s ears, the fermented meat (you have to be careful about that one, because its name changes depending on which station dialect you order in), or the reeking durian fruit that the natives so love.\n It feels . . . not quite right, you think, as you struggle to follow Galen, who is already far away, striding ahead with the same confidence he always exudes in life. People part before him; a waitress with a young, pretty avatar bows before him, though Galen himself takes no notice. You know that such obsequiousness unnerves him; he always rants about the outdated customs aboard Longevity, the inequalities and the lack of democratic government\u2014he thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time before they change, adapt themselves to fit into Galactic society. You\u2014you have a faint memory of arguing with him, a long time ago, but now you can\u2019t find the words, anymore, or even the reason why\u2014it makes sense, it all makes sense. The Galactics rose against the tyranny of Old Earth and overthrew their shackles, and won the right to determine their own destiny; and every other station and planet will do the same, eventually, rise against the dictatorships that hold them away from progress. It\u2019s right; it\u2019s always been right.\n Unbidden, you stop at a table, and watch two young women pick at a dish of chicken with chopsticks\u2014the smell of fish sauce and lemongrass rises in the air, as pungent and as unbearable as rotten meat\u2014no, no, that\u2019s not it, you have an image of a dark-skinned woman, bringing a dish of steamed rice to the table, her hands filled with that same smell, and your mouth watering in anticipation . . .\n The young women are looking at you: they both wear standard-issue avatars, the bottom-of-the-line kind\u2014their clothes are a garish mix of red and yellow, with the odd, uneasy cut of cheap designers; and their faces waver, letting you glimpse a hint of darker skin beneath the red flush of their cheeks. Cheap and tawdry, and altogether inappropriate; and you\u2019re glad you\u2019re not one of them.\n \u201cCan I help you, older sister?\u201d one of them asks.\n Older sister. A pronoun you were looking for, earlier; one of the things that seem to have vanished from your mind. You struggle for words; but all the immerser seems to suggest to you is a neutral and impersonal pronoun, one that you instinctively know is wrong\u2014it\u2019s one only foreigners and outsiders would use in those circumstances. \u201cOlder sister,\u201d you repeat, finally, because you can\u2019t think of anything else.\n \u201cAgnes!\u201d\n Galen\u2019s voice, calling from far away\u2014for a brief moment the immerser seems to fail you again, because you know that you have many names, that Agnes is the one they gave you in Galactic school, the one neither Galen nor his friends can mangle when they pronounce it. You remember the Rong names your mother gave you on Longevity, the childhood endearments and your adult style name.\n Be-Nho, Be-Yeu. Thu\u2014Autumn, like a memory of red maple leaves on a planet you never knew.\n You pull away from the table, disguising the tremor in your hands.\n Second Uncle was already waiting when Quy arrived; and so were the customers.\n \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Second Uncle sent on the private channel, though he made the comment half-heartedly, as if he\u2019d expected it all along. As if he\u2019d never really believed he could rely on her\u2014that stung.\n \u201cLet me introduce my niece Quy to you,\u201d Second Uncle said, in Galactic, to the man beside him.\n \u201cQuy,\u201d the man said, his immerser perfectly taking up the nuances of her name in Rong. He was everything she\u2019d expected; tall, with only a thin layer of avatar, a little something that narrowed his chin and eyes, and made his chest slightly larger. Cosmetic enhancements: he was good-looking for a Galactic, all things considered. He went on, in Galactic, \"My name is Galen Santos. Pleased to meet you. This is my wife, Agnes.\u201d\n Agnes. Quy turned, and looked at the woman for the first time\u2014and flinched. There was no one here: just a thick layer of avatar, so dense and so complex that she couldn\u2019t even guess at the body hidden within.\n \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d On a hunch, Quy bowed, from younger to elder, with both hands brought together\u2014Rong-style, not Galactic\u2014and saw a shudder run through Agnes\u2019 body, barely perceptible; but Quy was observant, she\u2019d always been. Her immerser was screaming at her, telling her to hold out both hands, palms up, in the Galactic fashion. She tuned it out: she was still at the stage where she could tell the difference between her thoughts and the immerser\u2019s thoughts.\n Second Uncle was talking again\u2014his own avatar was light, a paler version of him. \u201cI understand you\u2019re looking for a venue for a banquet.\u201d\n \u201cWe are, yes.\u201d Galen pulled a chair to him, sank into it. They all followed suit, though not with the same fluid, arrogant ease. When Agnes sat, Quy saw her flinch, as though she\u2019d just remembered something unpleasant. \u201cWe\u2019ll be celebrating our fifth marriage anniversary, and we both felt we wanted to mark the occasion with something suitable.\u201d\n Second Uncle nodded. \u201cI see,\u201d he said, scratching his chin. \u201cMy congratulations to you.\u201d\n Galen nodded. \u201cWe thought\u2014\u201d he paused, threw a glance at his wife that Quy couldn\u2019t quite interpret\u2014her immerser came up blank, but there was something oddly familiar about it, something she ought to have been able to name. \u201cSomething Rong,\u201d he said at last. \u201cA large banquet for a hundred people, with the traditional dishes.\u201d\n Quy could almost feel Second Uncle\u2019s satisfaction. A banquet of that size would be awful logistics, but it would keep the restaurant afloat for a year or more, if they could get the price right. But something was wrong\u2014something\u2014\n \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d Quy asked, not to Galen, but to his wife. The wife\u2014Agnes, which probably wasn\u2019t the name she\u2019d been born with\u2014who wore a thick avatar, and didn\u2019t seem to be answering or ever speaking up. An awful picture was coming together in Quy\u2019s mind.\n Agnes didn\u2019t answer. Predictable.\n Second Uncle took over, smoothing over the moment of awkwardness with expansive hand gestures. \u201cThe whole hog, yes?\u201d Second Uncle said. He rubbed his hands, an odd gesture that Quy had never seen from him\u2014a Galactic expression of satisfaction. \u201cBitter melon soup, Dragon-Phoenix plates, Roast Pig, Jade Under the Mountain . . .\u201d He was citing all the traditional dishes for a wedding banquet\u2014unsure of how far the foreigner wanted to take it. He left out the odder stuff, like Shark Fin or Sweet Red Bean Soup.\n \u201cYes, that\u2019s what we would like. Wouldn\u2019t we, darling?\u201d Galen\u2019s wife neither moved nor spoke. Galen\u2019s head turned towards her, and Quy caught his expression at last. She\u2019d thought it would be contempt, or hatred; but no; it was anguish. He genuinely loved her, and he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.\n Galactics. Couldn\u2019t he recognize an immerser junkie when he saw one? But then Galactics, as Tam said, seldom had the problem\u2014they didn\u2019t put on the immersers for more than a few days on low settings, if they ever went that far. Most were flat-out convinced Galactic would get them anywhere.\n Second Uncle and Galen were haggling, arguing prices and features; Second Uncle sounding more and more like a Galactic tourist as the conversation went on, more and more aggressive for lower and lower gains. Quy didn\u2019t care anymore: she watched Agnes. Watched the impenetrable avatar\u2014a red-headed woman in the latest style from Prime, with freckles on her skin and a hint of a star-tan on her face. But that wasn\u2019t what she was, inside; what the immerser had dug deep into.\n Wasn\u2019t who she was at all. Tam was right; all immersers should be taken apart, and did it matter if they exploded? They\u2019d done enough harm as it was.\n Quy wanted to get up, to tear away her own immerser, but she couldn\u2019t, not in the middle of the negotiation. Instead, she rose, and walked closer to Agnes; the two men barely glanced at her, too busy agreeing on a price. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said, in Rong, low enough that it didn\u2019t carry.\n Again, that odd, disjointed flash. \u201cYou have to take it off,\u201d Quy said, but got no further response. As an impulse, she grabbed the other woman\u2019s arm; felt her hands go right through the immerser\u2019s avatar, connect with warm, solid flesh.\n You hear them negotiating, in the background\u2014it\u2019s tough going, because the Rong man sticks to his guns stubbornly, refusing to give ground to Galen\u2019s onslaught. It\u2019s all very distant, a subject of intellectual study; the immerser reminds you from time to time, interpreting this and this body cue, nudging you this way and that\u2014you must sit straight and silent, and support your husband\u2014and so you smile through a mouth that feels gummed together.\n You feel, all the while, the Rong girl\u2019s gaze on you, burning like ice water, like the gaze of a dragon. She won\u2019t move away from you; and her hand rests on you, gripping your arm with a strength you didn\u2019t think she had in her body. Her avatar is but a thin layer, and you can see her beneath it: a round, moon-shaped face with skin the color of cinnamon\u2014no, not spices, not chocolate, but simply a color you\u2019ve seen all your life.\n \u201cYou have to take it off,\u201d she says. You don\u2019t move; but you wonder what she\u2019s talking about.\n Take it off. Take it off. Take what off?\n The immerser.\n Abruptly, you remember\u2014a dinner with Galen\u2019s friends, when they laughed at jokes that had gone by too fast for you to understand. You came home battling tears; and found yourself reaching for the immerser on your bedside table, feeling its cool weight in your hands. You thought it would please Galen if you spoke his language; that he would be less ashamed of how uncultured you sounded to his friends. And then you found out that everything was fine, as long as you kept the settings on maximum and didn\u2019t remove it. And then . . . and then you walked with it and slept with it, and showed the world nothing but the avatar it had designed\u2014saw nothing it hadn\u2019t tagged and labelled for you. Then . . .\n Then it all slid down, didn\u2019t it? You couldn\u2019t program the network anymore, couldn\u2019t look at the guts of machines; you lost your job with the tech company, and came to Galen\u2019s compartment, wandering in the room like a hollow shell, a ghost of yourself\u2014as if you\u2019d already died, far away from home and all that it means to you. Then\u2014then the immerser wouldn\u2019t come off, anymore.\n \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, young woman?\u201d\n Second Uncle had risen, turning towards Quy\u2014his avatar flushed with anger, the pale skin mottled with an unsightly red. \u201cWe adults are in the middle of negotiating something very important, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d It might have made Quy quail in other circumstances, but his voice and his body language were wholly Galactic; and he sounded like a stranger to her\u2014an angry foreigner whose food order she\u2019d misunderstood\u2014whom she\u2019d mock later, sitting in Tam\u2019s room with a cup of tea in her lap, and the familiar patter of her sister\u2019s musings.\n \u201cI apologize,\u201d Quy said, meaning none of it.\n \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Galen said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d he paused, looked at his wife. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have brought her here.\u201d\n \u201cYou should take her to see a physician,\u201d Quy said, surprised at her own boldness.\n \u201cDo you think I haven\u2019t tried?\u201d His voice was bitter. \u201cI\u2019ve even taken her to the best hospitals on Prime. They look at her, and say they can\u2019t take it off. That the shock of it would kill her. And even if it didn\u2019t . . .\u201d He spread his hands, letting air fall between them like specks of dust. \u201cWho knows if she\u2019d come back?\u201d\n Quy felt herself blush. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And she meant it this time.\n Galen waved her away, negligently, airily, but she could see the pain he was struggling to hide. Galactics didn\u2019t think tears were manly, she remembered. \u201cSo we\u2019re agreed?\u201d Galen asked Second Uncle. \u201cFor a million credits?\u201d\n Quy thought of the banquet; of the food on the tables, of Galen thinking it would remind Agnes of home. Of how, in the end, it was doomed to fail, because everything would be filtered through the immerser, leaving Agnes with nothing but an exotic feast of unfamiliar flavors. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, again, but no one was listening; and she turned away from Agnes with rage in her heart\u2014with the growing feeling that it had all been for nothing in the end.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the girl says\u2014she stands, removing her hand from your arm, and you feel like a tearing inside, as if something within you was struggling to claw free from your body. Don\u2019t go, you want to say. Please don\u2019t go. Please don\u2019t leave me here.\n But they\u2019re all shaking hands; smiling, pleased at a deal they\u2019ve struck\u2014like sharks, you think, like tigers. Even the Rong girl has turned away from you; giving you up as hopeless. She and her uncle are walking away, taking separate paths back to the inner areas of the restaurant, back to their home.\n Please don\u2019t go.\n It\u2019s as if something else were taking control of your body; a strength that you didn\u2019t know you possessed. As Galen walks back into the restaurant\u2019s main room, back into the hubbub and the tantalizing smells of food\u2014of lemongrass chicken and steamed rice, just as your mother used to make\u2014you turn away from your husband, and follow the girl. Slowly, and from a distance; and then running, so that no one will stop you. She\u2019s walking fast\u2014you see her tear her immerser away from her face, and slam it down onto a side table with disgust. You see her enter a room; and you follow her inside.\n They\u2019re watching you, both girls, the one you followed in; and another, younger one, rising from the table she was sitting at\u2014both terribly alien and terribly familiar at once. Their mouths are open, but no sound comes out.\n In that one moment\u2014staring at each other, suspended in time\u2014you see the guts of Galactic machines spread on the table. You see the mass of tools; the dismantled machines; and the immerser, half spread-out before them, its two halves open like a cracked egg. And you understand that they\u2019ve been trying to open them and reverse-engineer them; and you know that they\u2019ll never, ever succeed. Not because of the safeguards, of the Galactic encryptions to preserve their fabled intellectual property; but rather, because of something far more fundamental.\n This is a Galactic toy, conceived by a Galactic mind\u2014every layer of it, every logical connection within it exudes a mindset that might as well be alien to these girls. It takes a Galactic to believe that you can take a whole culture and reduce it to algorithms; that language and customs can be boiled to just a simple set of rules. For these girls, things are so much more complex than this; and they will never understand how an immerser works, because they can\u2019t think like a Galactic, they\u2019ll never ever think like that. You can\u2019t think like a Galactic unless you\u2019ve been born in the culture.\n Or drugged yourself, senseless, into it, year after year.\n You raise a hand\u2014it feels like moving through honey. You speak\u2014struggling to shape words through layer after layer of immerser thoughts.\n \u201cI know about this,\u201d you say, and your voice comes out hoarse, and the words fall into place one by one like a laser stroke, and they feel right, in a way that nothing else has for five years. \u201cLet me help you, younger sisters.\u201d\n To Rochita Loenen-Ruiz, for the conversations that inspired this.\n Aliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

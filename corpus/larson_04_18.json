The render is blown up to the size of a sumo, its butcher-paper skin creased and wrinkled around chubby tendril-tipped legs, its eyeless head dominated by a lamprey mouth. He\u2019ll need to make it less terrifying before he sends it to the art department.\n He shrinks it away and answers the call. \u201cHujambo.\u201d\n \u201cHujambo, yourself, handsome,\u201d Alyce says. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to learn Swahili before you come visit, right? There\u2019s English pretty much everywhere. And babeltech for everywhere else.\u201d\n \u201cSawa,\u201d Ostap says, using up another third of his Swahili vocabulary. \u201cHow was the lab today? The test run?\u201d\n \u201cNothing blew up. So, good.\u201d Alyce\u2019s cam comes on, filling half his goggles. Her dark hair is tied back and she\u2019s wearing the pajamas with the miniature sheep on them. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s a go.\u201d\n Ostap sees the familiar stucco wall of her bedroom behind her. There\u2019s a slice of window that he knows overlooks Nyali Beach. He\u2019s combed over the maps of her neighborhood a dozen times since she moved to Mombasa, trying to imagine her in every street view.\n The lab is farther inland, outside the city, and lab is a small word for a super-facility with miles of machinery that make the old Hadron Collider look like a toy. Alyce has tried to explain to him what exactly goes on there, has tried to explain about the Slip, but Ostap was never much for formulas and when he let his eyes glaze over and drool dribble from the corner of his mouth he was only half joking.\n \u201cTime to shatter the rules of quantum mechanics?\u201d Ostap asks.\n \u201cYeah. Actually.\u201d She pauses, her mouth set in a way Ostap knows is between worry and anticipation. \u201cIf this works, it\u2019ll make history.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d Ostap says. \u201cI love it when you make history.\u201d Her forehead is still creased; he tries to elicit her smile: \u201cDo you worry about your ego expanding to dangerous sizes once you\u2019re famous?\u201d\n \u201cDoes the universe worry about its constantly-expanding borders?\u201d Alyce asks back, in a grandiose voice, and when Ostap laughs she finally does grin. \u201cHow about you? What are you working on today?\u201d\n When she asks she always makes it seem as if freelance art is just as important as mind-bending physics.\n From the other half of his goggles, Ostap sends her the render plus an animation to make the tardigrade strut in place, its pudgy body wobbling slightly with every step.\n \u201cStill designing for that kid\u2019s show,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is Terry the Tardigrade, who teaches kids to not be . . . \u201d He trails off, winding his hand through the air.\n Alyce rolls her eyes upward in concentration. \u201cMicroscopic.\u201d\n \u201cTardy,\u201d Ostap says. \u201cTeaches them to not be tardy. I\u2019m helping raise good little meat drones.\u201d\n Alyce clicks her tongue. \u201cArt School Ostap would be so ashamed.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Ostap agrees. \u201cBut Art School Ostap was sort of a prick.\u201d He revolves the render again. \u201cI\u2019m going to change the mouth. Make it smilier. It\u2019s supposed to look friendly.\u201d\n \u201cI thought it was like, be on time or Terry the Tardigrade will eat you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll change the mouth.\u201d\n Alyce laughs, her loud laugh that seems too big for her body, and for a moment Ostap wants to ask her then and there. But it wouldn\u2019t be fair. Not on the eve of the test. He\u2019ll ask her in Mombasa.\n \u201cDance with me?\u201d he says instead.\n \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cYes. Definitely. Let me grab the linkwear.\u201d She disappears off-screen and Ostap hears her rummaging. He minimizes her in his goggles and retrieves a padded shirt and gloves from their hook on the wall.\n The linkwear shirt is all smartfabric, kinetic battery, feedback pads and sensors, linked wirelessly to its twin an ocean away. Small blue status lights wink on as he slides it over his head. Gloves next, tickling his palms with phantom pressure. Then he goes to the center of his bare apartment, stands in the footprints he marked with duct tape, and waits for Alyce to sync up.\n Suddenly he can feel her in his arms, feel her chest pushed against his chest and her left arm draped perfectly over his right shoulder and her right hand clasped loose in his left. The familiar shape of her body trips some wire deep in his brain; for a second he thinks he can smell her citrus shampoo.\n \u201cPick a song,\u201d he says.\n \u201cJust a second. Here.\u201d\n The first notes of the melody bloom in his earbuds. It\u2019s an old favorite, a slow kizomba song remixed by a Swiss-Angolan artist they were obsessed with a year ago. He sinks his hip into the piano and feels Alyce sink with him. The percussion kicks in, soft but steady, thumping in his earbuds like an electronic heartbeat.\n He slides forward, one, two, marca, and they dance. He can\u2019t feel the brush of her legs against his legs, but Alyce says that\u2019s better, in a way; it makes him lead with his frame instead of cheating with little nudges to her thighs. He can\u2019t feel her cheek against his cheek. But he can feel the warmth and pressure of her body, the subtle shifts of her weight, and when he closes his eyes it\u2019s close enough.\n Ostap glides around his empty apartment and guides her around hers, breaking and connecting, slowing and accelerating with the flow of the music. By now the exact dimensions of her room are cemented in his head and he doesn\u2019t have to worry about banging her into her wall or nightstand. They dance another song, and another, then break so Alyce can get a drink of water from her fridge, then dance one final song and end with a dramatic dip two beats too early, which sets them both laughing.\n When it\u2019s nearly midnight in Mombasa, Ostap peels off his gloves. They tried sleeping in the linkwear once, but it wasn\u2019t comfortable\u2014it\u2019s better saved for dancing or used together with Alyce\u2019s wireless toys.\n \u201cYou going to take the linkwear to work with you tomorrow?\u201d he asks. \u201cThat way I\u2019d be there for the history-making. You know, in spirit.\u201d\n Alyce laughs. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n \u201cGoodnight. Good luck with the test.\u201d Ostap pauses, grasping for syllables, then uses the last third of his newly-learned Swahili. \u201cNinakupenda.\u201d\n Alyce is quiet for a moment that seems like forever, then makes a satisfied noise in her throat. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\n \u201cMy mistake,\u201d Ostap says. \u201cI thought that meant \u2018I\u2019m looking for the washroom.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cSure.\u201d Alyce\u2019s lip twitches. \u201cI love you too, asshole.\u201d\n Ostap kisses the air just before she ends the call.\n SEVEN FEARED DEAD IN KENYA AFTER QUANTUM TEST FACILITY ACCIDENT\n At approximately 5:30AM local time, emergency services responded to multiple automated and human reports of an incident at the Nguyen-Bohr superlab located outside the Kenyan city of Mombasa. First responders extinguished an electrical fire at the entrance of the facility, but upon entering were unable to locate the seven members of the science team logged as present at the time of the incident.\n A witness described the scene as \u201cunreal, catastrophic,\u201d and drone-captured images [see below] show the extensive nature of the damage, in which large chunks of the concrete structure and surrounding earth seem to have been torn away.\n The superlab, which is the largest of its kind in the world, is used to study quantum phenomena. An experiment involving possible FTL particle travel was scheduled to occur today, but due to the nature of the damage, no autologs have been recovered. The Mombasa Fire Brigade suggested that bodies may be unrecoverable for the same reason.\n The last guests have left and Ostap is pouring out the leftover wine, balefully watching Merlot glug and splash into his steel sink. All he wants to do is drink. He wants to drink until the alcohol hollows him out to a dull happiness, spins him a warm protective cocoon to keep him that way until morning. Ostap was never a maudlin drunk.\n But he was an alcoholic. Which is why an implant in his stomach, a tiny origami enzyme factory, now breaks down any alcohol long before he can absorb it. Alyce paid for half of the surgery, since he was still treading debt at the time. It felt like love then. It now feels like a middle finger from beyond the grave.\n Ostap sets the empty bottle on the counter and looks around his apartment. There are still a few glasses here and there, dregs turning sticky in the bottoms. His roving end table has returned to its usual spot by the sofa with the remainders of the spring rolls and seaweed chips. Reginald, the autocleaner he and Alyce named together one silly night, is wiping a splatter of dipping sauce off the floor. Above it, the smartwall is still flickering clips and snaps of her. People wrote little notes on them with a stylus or just their fingers.\n The memorial party was a bad idea. One of Alyce\u2019s friends from Uni asked him to host it, because his apartment is central, and he agreed because he hardly leaves it anyways these days. And secretly, he hoped it might help in some way the wake and funeral had not.\n Instead, the night was a collision of awkward physics types and over-dramatic artists, all of whom seemed to have come just to give him pitying looks or too-tight hugs or snippets of advice like you can always talk to someone and don\u2019t start memory archiving or you\u2019ll be in there forever.\n And he had to thank them and pretend like he hadn\u2019t spent the past week lying boneless on his couch watching every single second he and Alyce had recorded together. He\u2019d tried to get rid of the goggle marks around his eyes with cold water and vigorous rubbing before people started arriving, but it hadn\u2019t worked.\n Almost worse than being pitied was having to pity them all back. Some of them had known Alyce since they were only kids, which made him feel a strange mixture of sympathy, because they had lost more of her than he had, and jealousy, for the same reason. He spent a good chunk of the party hiding in the bathroom, where the tiny knots he has felt in his stomach for weeks knotted themselves even tighter.\n Now, staring at the wall of notes he agreed to upload somewhere, he wonders if he deserves to be sad at all. Compared to her friends and family who have known her forever, he is an interloper. His status is inflated only because he was the last person to be in love with her: as if sleeping with her for a year and one month makes his grief just as valid as theirs. He feels like he knew her better than anyone, but it\u2019s a half-hormones illusion.\n And he can\u2019t even get drunk.\n Reginald jostles him on its way to load the empty glasses into the dishwasher. Without thinking, Ostap gives it a savage kick. The little robot sails across the room; it manages to keep hold of the glasses but one shatters anyway when it smashes to the faux-wood floor.\n Ostap watches Reginald rock back and forth on its white plastic shell, trying to right itself. Something about it triggers the tears that have been building up behind his eyes all night. They spill out and down his cheeks, salty hot, as he goes over to crouch beside the autocleaner.\n \u201cSorry.\u201d He flips it over gently. \u201cSorry, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d\n He sits cross-legged, patting Reginald on the back as it starts to wolf down the shards of broken glass. He wipes his eyes with the back of his right hand then wipes his nose with the back of his left. Squints at the smartwall, which is cycling through snaps from Alyce\u2019s last birthday: they went to an overpriced restaurant on the wharf where all the servers wore chamsuits to be less obtrusive, and spent half the evening thanking thin air.\n The snap shows Alyce grinning, triumphant, because they managed to catch one in the background. A server had been rolling down the neck of their chamsuit to scratch themselves, placing a tiny sliver of skin beside a levitating drinks tray. From the look on your face, Ostap used to tell her, you\u2019d think it was hard evidence of extraterrestrial life.\n He slumps down so he\u2019s lying on the floor of his apartment. He wants to clear the notes and images away, play music loud enough to swallow the sound of his undignified snuffling, but he can\u2019t choke out either command. So he just lies there, listening to his own ragged breathing and to Reginald\u2019s shuffling feet.\n Then he hears something else: the soft rustling of smartfabric flexing against itself. He stops crying. Stops breathing. Dangling from the hook on his wall, the linkwear he hasn\u2019t touched for a month is coming online. Ostap gets to his feet. The blue status lights pulse and he is drawn to them like a moth; he staggers to the wall, suspecting that he is dreaming again.\n With trembling hands, he lifts the shirt off its hook and pulls it over his head. When the company gathered up all of Alyce\u2019s things and shipped them back to her parents in Antwerp, the linkwear never made it. Ostap knows because he asked Alyce\u2019s mother, who said no, nothing like that, probably some sticky-fingered neighbor made off with it.\n But there\u2019s another possibility. Maybe Alyce really did take it with her to the lab on the day things all went to hell. As a way for him to almost be there. Ostap puts on the gloves. With his pulse pounding, he goes to the taped footprints in the center of his apartment and closes his eyes.\n They never recovered her body. Any of the bodies. Ostap saw the images, the way whole swathes of earth had been carved up and carried off by some invisible hand. He fantasized, for a little while, that Alyce had only been transported away, which meant she could return. But he thought that was only masochism.\n The linkwear syncs. A familiar body presses against him and Ostap\u2019s heart skips a beat. The proportions are right. The height, the shape. He reminds himself it could be saved data. A glitch. Feedback error.\n He squeezes Alyce\u2019s hand, and she squeezes back hard.\n \u201cOstap Bender.\u201d Ostap enunciates this time. \u201cI\u2019ve got some questions about the Nguyen-Bohr lab.\u201d\n Doctor Anunoby is on East Africa Time; hopefully she doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s the middle of the night where Ostap is calling from.\n \u201cI\u2019ve given statements already,\u201d she says. \u201cUse those. Don\u2019t call my personal line.\u201d\n Ostap is standing on the tape marks again, still wearing the shirt and gloves. The last whisper of pressure came hours ago, but he doesn\u2019t dare remove them. \u201cI\u2019m not a reporter. I found the line in Alyce\u2019s contacts. She was my . . . \u201d Ostap\u2019s throat clogs dry. He didn\u2019t ask. He\u2019d been planning to ask in Mombasa. \u201cAlyce Kerensky was my partner.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d A pause. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d\n \u201cYou worked with her right up until last year,\u201d Ostap says. \u201cSame project. Right?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n \u201cShe told me a little about it.\u201d Ostap inhales. \u201cAbout the Slip.\u201d\n \u201cSome of us called it that, yes.\u201d\n \u201cIt was the FTL theory. About how particles could skip, at the right energy levels.\u201d Ostap has some of the literature in his left goggle, but he can barely wrestle through the abstract. In his right goggle he\u2019s trawling the conspiracy forums, the ones he swore off, where people think the scientists were taken by aliens or kidnapped by government agents. \u201cThey would disappear and then reappear farther along the beamline. Like they were going into some kind of pocket and coming out again.\u201d\n There\u2019s a long pause before Anunoby replies. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened to Alyce and her team. We have no idea. The instruments were compromised. Half the hardware, just gone. There\u2019s no precedent for it. It\u2019s going to take years to try to sort out what happened, and if we ever do we\u2019ll have local government up our asses about safety measures for, I don\u2019t know. For rapture.\u201d\n \u201cI think they\u2019re in the Slip,\u201d Ostap blurts. \u201cI think they\u2019re alive. At least, Alyce is. I felt her in our linkwear.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d Anunoby\u2019s voice cracks slightly. \u201cThere\u2019s a trauma group. For friends and family. I can send you the information.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is,\u201d Ostap says. \u201cShe took the linkwear with her the day it happened. I mean. I think she did. And tonight I felt her squeeze my hand.\u201d\n \u201cThe amount of energy you need to put a particle in the Slip would vaporize human tissues.\u201d\n \u201cPretend I\u2019m not losing my mind.\u201d Ostap flexes his fingers in the gloves. \u201cWhat should I do? If it happens again?\u201d\n Anunoby sighs. \u201cBe ready for it. Try to backtrace the signal. Try to communicate with whoever\u2019s on the other end. I\u2019ll send you the trauma group info in the meantime.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d\n When it happens again Ostap is sprawled on the couch, half submerged in a dream, a caffeine spray still clutched in his hand. Alyce\u2019s fingers against his chest make him turn his head instinctively, searching for her lips. He doesn\u2019t find them. He jerks fully awake and his eyes fly open.\n Alyce\u2019s fingers drop away save one; it feels like her index. Ostap holds perfectly still, hardly breathing, as she draws a circle on his chest. A serpentine curve follows it, and he realizes it was an O, not a circle, and now she is finishing the S and starting the T. He waits until his name is complete, until she places the dot of the question mark:\n OSTAP?\n Ostap\u2019s hands are shaking. He reaches until he phantom-feels Alyce\u2019s torso, then writes back on her ribcage:\n YES\n She hugs him, wrapping both arms around him hard and clinging there. Ostap hugs back. The embrace is tight and desperate and he wants it to never end. She used to cling to him like that after sex sometimes, weaving her legs around him too and swearing she wasn\u2019t an octopus, telling him she definitely only had four limbs and to disregard any extras he might feel.\n Right now Ostap feels nothing but relief, an endorphin wave crashing over him. Alyce is alive. He looks over at the screen of his tablet, which is hooked up to the linkwear GPS node. According to the trace, Alyce\u2019s signal is coming from nowhere at all. Cold slithers through his warm.\n He finally peels an arm free and starts the next message. He gets the R backwards; hopefully she understands it anyways:\n WHR U?\n Then he stays perfectly still, concentrating as her invisible finger traces a reply.\n LAB. NEVR LEFT.\n Getting the linkwear through airport security is nerve-shredding\u2014extra scans, extra interrogations\u2014but Ostap makes it onto the plane without them confiscating anything. He stows his bag in the overhead, then slides past a white-haired woman to get to his seat. She gives him a curious glance as he loosens the seatbelt to fit it over his padded shirt. The pillow around her neck is so plump she can barely see over the top of it.\n \u201cIs that a comfort vest?\u201d she asks. \u201cOne of those things that hugs you if you start having an anxiety attack?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Ostap says, because that\u2019s more or less how he explained it to security.\n \u201cNo shame in that,\u201d she says. \u201cI get nervous still. I\u2019ve been flying, what, fifty years. Still get nervous.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s always ginger ale,\u201d Ostap says. \u201cI think the ginger ale helps. And watching cartoons.\u201d\n He finds Alyce\u2019s phantom hand, how he\u2019s done every few minutes since they established contact, and squeezes. She gives two back.\n He keeps picturing her in the Slip. She described it to him in painstaking detail, switching from drawing letters to tapping out Morse code that Ostap needed his goggles to translate. She says she\u2019s still in the observation room, or at least somewhere that looks like it. But with some differences.\n She\u2019s only been there for a day at most. Her last memory is unexpected activity on the third beamline. Color is muted, everything a soft cold blue. Light and motion warp in strange ways, leaving misplaced reflections and lingering blurs.\n Sometimes she thinks she sees flickers of the other scientists, of Bagley, Chiozza, Xu, and the rest, moving around the observation room. She can\u2019t interact with them. Aside from the linkwear, none of her personal electronics work. None of the lab tech works.\n She can\u2019t detect air currents. She\u2019s breathing, but she held her breath for just over seven minutes and showed no ill effects, meaning she might not need to. She is not sure\u2014and this is where Ostap had to stop her and hold her\u2014if she is still alive, in the strictest sense of the word. He told her he would take undead Alyce over dead Alyce any day. And that Dr. Anunoby would figure out a way to get her out.\n \u201cBeen to Kenya before?\u201d the white-haired woman asks. \u201cI\u2019m visiting my son. He\u2019s on the coast.\u201d\n \u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Ostap says. \u201cI\u2019ve been planning it for a long time, though.\u201d He pauses. \u201cHujambo.\u201d\n \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to blow them away. Where are the cartoons?\u201d\n Ostap helps her scroll through the kid\u2019s channels until he finds her The Almost Adventures of Terry the Tardigrade. Then he puts his earbuds in and settles back in his seat, tapping his finger against Alyce\u2019s palm:\n OMW.\n Dr. Anunoby is taller than he imagined her, spindly limbs in a black pantsuit, flyaway hair. She picks him out of the arrival rush and Ostap removes his glove to shake hands. His palm is already slick with sweat from the brief walk through the tarmac-shimmering heat between airplane and airport. Alyce warned him it was hot in March. Told him to bring good sunblock or he\u2019d spontaneously combust on the beach.\n Dr. Anunoby asks the perfunctory questions about his flight as she steers him to the exit, and Ostap can tell she has never been tardy in her life. A boxy black Chinese rental is waiting for them outside. He slides gratefully back into air conditioning. Dr. Anunoby slides in after him, eyeing the linkwear.\n \u201cSo you\u2019ve been communicating entirely by touch.\u201d\n \u201cYes. Well, Morse code. Haven\u2019t thought up anything better.\u201d\n \u201cMay I?\u201d\n After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Ostap peels off his right glove and hands it over. She puts it on, flexing her fingers, and he guides her hand to Alyce\u2019s shoulder. For a terrifying instant he thinks Dr. Anunoby won\u2019t feel anything, that she\u2019ll frown and gently confirm that he is losing his mind. But then her eyes widen slightly. Ostap pulls up a Morse code translator for her and watches in silence, his bare hand clenched tight on his thigh.\n \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d he asks, when he fails to keep track of her pulses.\n \u201cAsking a very specific question about how we met,\u201d Dr. Anunoby says.\n \u201cJust to be sure it\u2019s not an elaborate hoax?\u201d\n She nods. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the type for an elaborate hoax. But I need to ask. For my own peace of mind.\u201d\n Ostap watches out the window while he waits. They\u2019re on the highway now, parallel to the Mombasa-Nairobi raised rail, driving in its shadow. Passenger pods flash like silverfish along the retrofitted magnetics. The soil is rust red and the trees are a lush dark green. When the car pulls off onto a smaller road, they have to drive through a scanner gate.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Dr. Anunoby says, returning the glove. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s really incredible.\u201d\n Ostap puts the glove back on and gropes for Alyce\u2019s hand, interweaves his fingers with hers. \u201cSo?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow are we going to get her back?\u201d\n Dr. Anunoby purses her lips as the car glides to a halt. \u201cThere\u2019s something I didn\u2019t tell you. I couldn\u2019t tell you until I was sure.\u201d\n Ostap\u2019s stomach churns. The tiny knots are back, coiled tighter than ever, carouseling. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re starting to find bodies.\u201d Dr. Anunoby pushes open the car door. \u201cCome up the hill.\u201d\n She gets out and Ostap stumbles after her. The sun is too harsh for his flimsy airport shades; he squints his eyes behind them. The heat beats him around the head and shoulders as he follows her over gravel parking lot to a slope of red-brown earth. His knees are weak and watery, but he climbs it anyway. A breeze ruffles his hair and cools his sweaty forehead as they near the top.\n When they crest the hill, he sees the damage the drone photos didn\u2019t do justice. The external hub of the Nguyen-Bohr lab, now charred rubble, is large enough on its own. But the facility extended for miles beneath the surface, and has now been sectioned out in huge swathes by some unseen surgical blade.\n For a moment Ostap\u2019s eyes rebel at the scope of the scene, the unnatural composition. It looks more like effects, like something he would render in his goggles, than anything real. He can see layers of packed dirt, concrete, wiring, all neatly sheared to the same exact proportions. The electrical fires were a sideshow. The real damage was done by something else. Or maybe by nothing at all.\n He looks at the massive pit where the observation room once was. There\u2019s an emergency crew down there, reflective jackets gleaming in the sunshine. He can see them loading something onto a stretcher.\n \u201cThe first one showed up just after you called me,\u201d Dr. Anunoby says. \u201cBits of skeleton and muscle all mixed up with chunks of the floor. With metal and wiring. They scraped enough DNA to identify it as Dr. Simmons. Xu followed the same way about an hour ago. It\u2019s like the . . . the Slip . . . is spitting them back out. But not intact.\u201d\n Ostap\u2019s tongue is too dry to talk. He tries twice before he gets the first word out. \u201cWe can bring her back safe. Somehow.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re ants,\u201d Dr. Anunoby says. She nods her chin at the destruction. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how this happened. No other facility in the world has the tech to run the test again, not even CERN, and if they tried it might end up even worse. We made a mistake.\u201d\n Ostap sinks to his haunches, spreads one hand in the hot dust for balance. His vision constricts like black rubber. He dimly feels Dr. Anunoby crouching beside him, pushing a water bottle into his free hand. He feels Alyce give his arm a questioning squeeze. His breathing slowly returns to normal.\n \u201cI can be the one to tell her,\u201d Dr. Anunoby says, with a tremor in her voice. \u201cIf you want. It can be me. I think she already suspects.\u201d\n \u201cThen why would I get to talk to her again?\u201d Ostap demands, anger going off in his chest like a flare. He surges to his feet, wobbling only once. \u201cIf it\u2019s for nothing? If there\u2019s nothing I can do?\u201d\n For the first time, the linkwear feels like a straitjacket. He wants to rip it away and hurl it off the hill. Alyce squeezes his wrist again, tighter now. She knows something is wrong.\n Dr. Anunoby shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ll wait down there,\u201d she says, and starts back down the hill.\n Ostap barely hears her. He paces a tight frantic circle. He beats his hands against the ground; stops, flinches, wonders if Alyce can feel it. He shouts no particular word and the wind strips it away. Finally he sinks down to his knees and goes still.\n Alyce\u2019s finger presses against his chest. He repeats the letters aloud, wrestling each one out of his windpipe, and watches her message form in his goggles.\n No way back\n He waits for the question mark, but it doesn\u2019t come. He runs his hands over the parts of her body he can reach, caressing her neck, her shoulders, her arms. He moves his finger to her palm.\n No.\n She pushes back, tap press press. He waits. Waits. The last letter forms and he chokes on a laugh.\n Well fuck.\n He hugs her as tightly as he can, closing his eyes, imagining the brush of her hair in his face, her temple against his neck. She clings back. He realizes, with a sick feeling all through his body, that he can ask her now. It will be grand and symbolic and mean nothing, because she\u2019s not coming back. Not alive. It will be a farce. She\u2019ll say yes because there is nothing else to say at the end of the world.\n Ostap tells her about the bodies. Alyce is still for a long time, long enough to put panic in Ostap\u2019s throat. Then she has messages for her parents. For her friends. Observations for Dr. Anunoby and her colleagues. She etches them out with trembling fingers and Ostap transcribes them all. It\u2019s slow. Painstaking. The tension is piano-wire taut, because Ostap knows each letter might be the last one. He knows she might be the next barely body to arrive. The question is building up in his mouth.\n The messages trail off, and Ostap tries to imagine what she\u2019s feeling but can\u2019t. He has his overshirt draped over his head to shield him from the sun, but it\u2019s cooling off now. The sky is slowly turning red for sunset. Dr. Anunoby is still waiting, like a statue, beside the car. She is an ant. Ostap is an ant. Alyce is a particularly good ant. So he supposes it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway.\n Shaking badly, he starts to write:\n Made history.\n He waits.\n Yes.\n He writes again, heart thumping out of his chest. It\u2019s slow, so slow. On each letter he thinks of a dozen other things he could turn it into.\n We should\n She squeezes him so tight he has to stop. He wonders, in a panic, if it\u2019s happening. If she\u2019s being ripped back out of the Slip. Then she finishes the sentence.\n Marry.\n This is why he had one more chance to talk to her. For this one unsullied surge of happiness. He knows it won\u2019t last. Can\u2019t last. But it is, and she is, and they are. He has a hundred more things he wants to say, the things he hopes are true: that he loves her more than he\u2019s ever loved anyone, that he would follow her into the Slip and be ghosts or corpses with her, that he was going to ask her on Nyali Beach under the moonlight. He writes:\n I do.\n And she writes:\n I do too.\n Then Ostap gets to his feet and presses one last word into her skin:\n Dance?\n He feels her chest pushed against his chest. Her left arm over his right shoulder. Her right hand clasped in his left hand. He can almost feel Alyce\u2019s heartbeat against his own. They dance with no music, one, two, marca. Ostap is sure he would be stepping on her feet if her feet were there, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\n They glide around the top of the rust-red hill and around the soft blue observation room, in and out of the Slip, until the light is gone and he can\u2019t feel any part of her.\n Rich Larson (Ymir, Tomorrow Factory) was born in Galmi, Niger, has lived in Spain and Czech Republic, and is currently based in Grande Prairie, Canada.

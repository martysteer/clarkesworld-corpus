And that was a story I didn\u2019t want to be.\nMy bike was already packed. Had been for a few weeks. It was waiting for me on the trail like an old faithful steed. Soft mulch shifted under my boots as I made my way toward it, a pack on my back, a helmet under one arm, and two jars of ashes under the other. The forest was hushed. Silent except for the chittering of squirrels and bot birds. It smelled like compost and impending rain. My parents always told me rain was lucky.\nExcept, I\u2019d grown skeptical of the things my parents said. Especially their stories.\nI wondered if they\u2019d think the rain was lucky if they had to ride thirty kilometers in it, when everything gets shiny and slick and dangerous even at modest speeds. I glanced up, trying to assess the clouds between the gaps in the forest canopy. A big, swollen raindrop landed smack in the center of my forehead.\nJust my luck.\nScrew this. I\u2019ll leave tomorrow. I thought and turned to go back to the house. I\u2019d always been a reluctant traveler.\nThrough a cracked window, I could see Nat, her hair still sleep-mussed, her cybernetic hands pressed against the window, her breath fogging up the pane, like a little kid.\nIt made me smile. I had fixed those hands for her.\nThen she slapped a note to the window and my smile faded. It read: Go! Go! Go!\nShe was right, of course she was. I\u2019d promised I would find the ocean at the top of the mountain. and it haunted me.\nSo, I left because if I stayed one more night, I\u2019d see the ghost of my mom again. She\u2019d look around Nat\u2019s sparse house, at my nest of blankets on the floor, and she wouldn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t need to. Her sadness and disappointment would be so clear.\nI was ninety-five percent sure my ghost mom was my imagination. My subconscious telling me to go, go, go too. But that five percent made me wonder.\nReluctantly, I tucked the jars of my parents\u2019 ashes in the panniers on the bike. They clinked against the six other jars of ashes already packed in the side bags. I slid on my helmet and took one last long look at Nat in the window.\nShe gave me a warm smile. Though it was full of sadness too.\nSo, I left because a few weeks ago, my hometown got hit by a mudslide and my parents\u2019 house almost collapsed on me. And I realized as I fled, that if I died, I wouldn\u2019t leave any stories behind.\nAs I started pedaling, it began to rain.\nMy parents used to tell endless stories about the impossible ocean on top of the mountain and the travelers who took the path. But if there was one thing the stories taught me, it was this. Always this.\nNo one who took this journey ended up happy.\nOne time, a coughing sickness killed her family, and the widow packed her bags for the cursed path. She knew the stories; she\u2019d listened carefully to every whispered version for years. They said there was an ocean at the end of the trail where, if you wanted to survive in this terrible world, you needed to bring your loved ones\u2019 ashes and drink its bitter water. The ocean was magic. It was haunted. It was impossible. It would only make her feel worse.\nThe widow didn\u2019t care. At dawn, she left her gray, deadbeat town for the cursed path. In her pack there were eight jars of ashes, one for each of her two husbands, five children, and one loyal dog.\nThe cursed path wasn\u2019t long, but the going was slow and treacherous. There were many dangers even among the leafless trees, thin and stark as skeletons.\nYou think you\u2019ll make it, solitary woman? the trees whispered.\nThe widow bristled, but ignored them, knowing the stories. The trees just wanted to keep her for themselves. She kept going.\nWe\u2019re sorry. We\u2019re lonely. We need a friend. Please. Stay, stay, stay, they whispered to her back as she walked. They sounded sincere.\nBut she knew how to tune out demanding voices. She once was a mother to a large family.\nSo she passed through that whispering forest, never even considering their offer. Because what would be the point of her journey, her memories, her grief, her fight to survive if she stopped now?\nThis was my mom\u2019s favorite story. She had me later in life. I was my parents\u2019 only kid and she rarely talked about her past, no matter how much I questioned and begged. She told stories instead.\nSometimes, I thought if someone were to cut me open, it wouldn\u2019t be entrails that spilled out, but stories. Hundreds of family tales and movies. I loved old movies. Especially ones with happy endings.\nIt\u2019s thirty km to the ocean on the mountain, said the note Nat left on the bathroom mirror. She preferred to communicate via notes, which thrilled me. There\u2019s something slow and deliberate and loving in having a conversation on snatches of paper. It was easier trying to communicate via anecdotes.\nThirty kilometers, I thought. I can do that in a day. It was a two-hundred-kilometer ride from my decimated hometown to Nat\u2019s house using a ruined state highway that was mostly potholes and splintered tarmac. It took me four days to get there. So, I thought, How bad could thirty klicks be?\nVery bad, I realized an hour into my journey. The trail\u2019s incline rose steadily and the trees began to thin out, but the rain stayed consistent, insistent, making the path a slurry of mud. The path eroded the farther I went.\nI kept going because I didn\u2019t want to go back and disappoint my mom\u2019s ghost. Or Nat. Nat, who let me stay at her house for weeks, even though we\u2019d only hung out at the farm/exchange market in my town\u2019s overgrown community park. Where I\u2019d barter things I\u2019d salvaged from the abandoned mall like shirts, shoes, once, a bottle of strawberry vodka I found stashed behind a register, in exchange for some of her peaches or raspberry jam. Nat, who handed me a note that said Come by my house, if you go to the ocean. Which was how I knew, she was full of stories too.\nEventually, it was easier to dismount and walk aside my bike. The path was all mud and treacherous footing and stank of rot. But at least the trees didn\u2019t whisper. They were all cut down. I was in a forest of stumps that seemed more like a graveyard or a silhouette of something beautiful and lost.\nI kept going. A fog was rising and every creak of my bicycle or crunch of my boot sounded unnaturally loud.\nMaybe that\u2019s why I heard the voices.\nIt took a moment to realize it wasn\u2019t the stumps of trees talking. That\u2019s how entrenched the widow\u2019s story is in me. No, it wasn\u2019t the trees. There was someone there in the thickening mist. Or rather, judging from the pitch of voices, several someones. The low, steady hum behind the voices told me these someones had drones overhead.\nI held perfectly still. Waiting, calculating. They were hunting something. I knew this because everyone these days was hunting or scavenging or scrounging something in this graveyard of civilization. I hoped it was just deer, but I heard stories of worse. There\u2019s always a worse story.\nI shifted my weight slightly and my bike creaked. The voices in the mist halted. I couldn\u2019t see them, but I could imagine, and I imagined the people they belonged to peering through the fog toward me. Waiting, calculating.\n\u201cHello?\u201d one said.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I answered in a voice just above a whisper.\nA shot rang out.\nI dove to the ground. My bike fell on me, jars rattling. Suddenly, all the worst stories were ringing in my ears. People are crazy territorial these days. Woods are a breeding ground for cults. Some people will eat anything they find. I didn\u2019t know where the shot came from or how close it\u2019d been to me. But I didn\u2019t care. It was too close. Too close. I was alive, unharmed, but too close, and the voices and drones were getting closer. Louder.\nI didn\u2019t think. My hands were shaking, full of reeking mud. But I didn\u2019t think. I unbuckled my helmet and hurled it as hard as I could downhill, away from the direction I was headed. It was a prayer. And a plea. It was all I had. The helmet bounced and crashed against the stumps once, twice, three times. Then it went silent.\nFor a moment, the voices and the drones went silent too.\nSomewhere in the mist, a voice swore and boots crunched as they turned. (Too close.) The drones whined as they changed directions. The hunters began to move away.\nI lay there in the mud, for a minute, maybe two, barely breathing. Listening and hoping and pleading that I\u2019d get to tell this story one day, however it ends. The hunters\u2019 voices were getting softer. So, as quickly and silently as I could, I got on my bike again and began to pedal. I had to keep going. I\u2019ve never pedaled uphill so hard. My bike groaned and my heartbeat pounded in my ears. My tire rolled over something squishy, and the stink of rot overwhelmed me. But I didn\u2019t stop to look. I didn\u2019t stop. I could hear the voices swearing again in the distance. The fog was thick, but not thick enough. Not enough.\nI had to keep going. So, I bent forward and rode.\nI rode so hard, so blindly, I didn\u2019t realize when I\u2019d left the stumps behind.\nAnd crashed into something worse.\nOne time, someone who\u2019d lost something he loved found himself on the cursed path, despite promising himself he would never go to the ocean on top of the mountain. From stories, he knew there were many dangers on this road, but the one that worried him most was the stork. He needed to befriend it so it could guide him through the last and most dangerous part of the path. Making friends was never the lost lover\u2019s strong point.\nBut the stork wasn\u2019t what he expected. The great bird was mud-drenched and depressed, with wings so matted, it could no longer fly. Its legs were caked in dirt, thick enough to glue it to the rocky ledge it perched on.\n\u201cSplendid. Another grief-stricken person who wants my help,\u201d said the stork. \u201cTurn back. Believe me, you won\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d the lover said.\n\u201cEveryone who comes this way has lost someone. They don\u2019t want to die the same way and want me to help them,\u201d said the stork, miserably. \u201cAm I wrong?\u201d\nThe lost lover didn\u2019t answer.\nThe stork sighed. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay here. Go home or keep walking. Else, you\u2019ll get stuck like me.\u201d\nThe lover looked down. He was, in fact, sinking into the mud. He wrenched his feet free. \u201cI think I can help you,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow? My wings are too muddy to fly. Others have tried.\u201d\n\u201cNot your wings.\u201d\nFrom his pack, the lost lover pulled out a small spade. He began digging methodically around where the bird was trapped, and then used his fingers to gently pry the caked earth from its legs.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very patient,\u201d the stork observed.\n\u201cI\u2019m a farmer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m used to pulling things out of the mud.\u201d\nThe stork laughed at this, and the lover smiled.\nWhen it was finally free, the stork danced in place, shook out its great, dirty wings, and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t fly, but I will show you the way.\u201d it said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me,\u201d the lost lover said. In his pack, he carried a jar of ashes of the person he loved most in this world.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t bring you any happiness,\u201d the stork said. \u201cThe water won\u2019t save you.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d the lost lover replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go anyway.\u201d\nI should have said goodbye to my bike, like heroes in adventure movies do when their animal companions are gravely wounded. When I hit that rock in the mud and went tumbling ass-over-head, that should have been a sign of what the path forward would look like. Except, I didn\u2019t want to be that story either.\nSo I carried my steadfast steed over my shoulders, even as the mud swallowed my ankles with every footstep. Refusing to lose yet another thing. Now that I stopped fleeing, I grieved the loss of my helmet. I\u2019d been so happy when I\u2019d found it in a forgotten shipping warehouse when I was sixteen. It made me feel civilized and it made my parents feel like I had a talisman of safety in this dangerous world.\nBut I was alive and that was something. Around me there were prickly bushes and plenty of rocks and everywhere smelled like damp earth and sulfur, but thankfully, nothing rotten. The mud was murderous though. The trail was steep and the panniers with the jars of ashes rattled as I trudged forward. Miraculously, none of them were broken, but they clinked together threateningly with each step.\nOf the many low points in this journey, this was one of the worst. Because it felt like I would drown going uphill to an ocean on top of a mountain that I didn\u2019t want to see. I promised my parents that I would take their ashes to the summit. I promised Nat that I\u2019d take her six jars up too. I promised I would drink the water and survive. And I wanted to survive. Even if the water was just a talisman.\nI wish there was another way, I thought as I took another step and sank through the mud down to my calf. But this was the only path I knew.\nScrew this, I thought.\nI dragged myself over a cluster of rocks, rising out of the mud like the tip of an iceberg. Took stock of my scrapes and bruises from my fall and of the bent rim of the front tire. It was nothing that I couldn\u2019t heal from, nothing I couldn\u2019t fix. But still, it hurt.\nThe path ahead snaked upward forever.\nI rubbed my muddy face with my muddy hands, struggling to swallow down the despair caught in my throat. I\u2019d never felt so alone.\nQuickly, before depression dragged me down, I pulled out my repair kit from one of the panniers and began to work on straightening the front wheel of my bike. Fixing something always made me feel better. I didn\u2019t think so much when I was fixing.\nThat was how I heard it. The small, sad whine behind me. The sound of a motor fighting for life.\nI put down my tools and scrambled over the rocks, trying to find where the noise was coming from, slipping once. Only by luck did I spot the aluminum leg peeking out from the bog, flexing helplessly.\nThe muddy water rose past my knees as I wrangled and pried the bot free from its mucky prison. It took me a few minutes, then a few minutes more to carry it back to my bike. The bot was small, but heavy, and the terrain wasn\u2019t forgiving. Its gyroscopic head whirled laboriously in my arms.\nI cleaned the grime from the solar panels on its back with an old shirt from my pack, but the sky was still cloudy and gray, so I hooked up my external power cell to give it a boost. And I waited.\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d it said, when it finally had enough juice to power on.\nI laughed and rubbed my face. I couldn\u2019t have agreed more.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your function?\u201d\n\u201cI am. Was. Am. A park ranger,\u201d it said. \u201cThis was. Is. A national park.\u201d It went silent for a moment, the LED in its torso turning yellow for self-diagnosis. \u201cCrap. Natural language processor. Is. Borked.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t care if the bot was partly disabled, I was so relieved to have found someone. \u201cCan you take me to the end of this trail?\u201d\n\u201cBad idea,\u201d it said. It stretched out each of its six spidery legs one by one, testing the joints, giving a hum of frustration when one got stuck. Five of the six got stuck.\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSo. Why are. You here?\u201d\n\u201cMay I?\u201d I pointed to one of its jammed legs and it beeped its consent. The joint was out of alignment. I fished out my screwdriver from my bag. \u201cI promised my parents I would.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid. Reason. To follow.\u201d it said.\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhy then?\u201d\nBecause this is the only path I know, I thought.\n\u201cWhy were you on a muddy path out in the rain?\u201d I tightened the screw and articulated the joint.\n\u201cMy job.\u201d it replied. \u201cIs to guide. Visitors. Safely up the mountain. If asked.\u201d In a slow, stuttering motion, it moved its head to look right at me. \u201cThey asked.\u201d\nSomething about its inflection explained that the askers didn\u2019t come back down. Something about its direct gaze begged me not to do the same.\nI didn\u2019t say anything, focusing on the next leg instead.\n\u201cYou think. If you fix. Me.\u201d it said after a few minutes. \u201cI\u2019ll take you. Where. You want. To go?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, frowning at the third leg. It was bent, but no worse than the rim of my bike. \u201cI\u2019m doing this because it\u2019s the right thing to do. And because I like fixing things.\u201d I carefully bent the leg back to mostly straight\nThe ranger bot didn\u2019t say much after that. It whirled its creaky head and searched for signals and updates, giving a frustrated beep when it didn\u2019t find any.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said after I fixed its last leg and realigned the motor in its neck.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d it said, sounding genuinely grateful, LED turning green. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. Take you. Up there.\u201d\nDisappointment slumped my shoulders. I hadn\u2019t quite realized how badly I didn\u2019t want to be alone on the path. But like the lost lover, I didn\u2019t have much practice making friends, and I wasn\u2019t going to force the ranger bot to come with me. \u201cOkay. Any advice?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d it said. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d\nI slung my bike over my shoulders and tried to tamp down my fear. \u201cStay safe,\u201d I said and began trudging forward. One muddy footstep at a time\n\u201cWait,\u201d it said, after a moment, after an eternity. \u201cThere\u2019s another. Path.\u201d\nOne time, a survivor took the cursed path to the impossible ocean. She never made it there. She got lost.\nHalfway up the mountain, the path began twisting and splintered into trails that all looked the same. There were no road signs or clues. So, she chose a fork at random.\nShe chose wrong.\nIt was only by sheer luck that she picked a path that spat her out at the edge of the forest, not far from her home.\nWhen she realized where she was, she breathed a sigh of relief. Because she knew the stories of travelers that didn\u2019t return from the cursed path. There were too many to count.\nThe survivor was wise enough to know when she should count herself lucky and tap out.\nExcept, when she returned home and put the jars of her friends\u2019 ashes on the mantle, six in all, she felt a cut of guilt. She thought about trying the path again, but surviving had taken a toll on her body and she knew, if she tried again, she wouldn\u2019t make it to the impossible ocean.\nStill, every time she looked at those jars, she felt fresh cuts.\nAnd no matter how many times she glanced at the mantle or counted herself lucky, their sting never dulled.\nThe ranger bot, or PARKER 17, as it preferred to be called, took me back down the mountain.\nWe retraced my tracks, slowly because riding downhill in the mud was treacherous even in the best of times. The farther we went, the more my chest constricted. There was something heartbreaking about going back down a path I had fought so hard to climb.\nThis is not a regression, I thought as the forest of stumps came back into view. The fog from earlier was only a thin mist now and it was easier to see. And to be seen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe here,\u201d I whispered to PARKER 17. The memory of gunshots still echoed in my ears.\n\u201cNo,\u201d it agreed, panning its head back and forth, scanning. \u201cBut no other. Drones or GPS trackers. Are in. A ten kilometer. Radius.\u201d Its head whirled to face me. \u201cWe\u2019re safe. For now.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re exposed,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNot for long.\u201d The bot began to trot away and I had to hurry to catch up. For a long time, there was nothing except the sound of animals in the brush between us, both the natural ones and the man-made replicates that were supposed to alleviate some of the environmental damage.\nFor a long time, we traveled in silence. Something loomed in the distance. At first, I could only make out the outline, the lingering remains of the fog obscured the details. At first, it looked like another ridge of rocks.\nThen, just like in a movie, everything came into focus. My breath caught in my throat.\nIt was a mountain range of old and forgotten things, discarded things from a time when everything was cheap. Except, there were small but very alive evergreens growing from out of the heaps. It was clearly man-made, and it was beautiful. One of the few beautiful man-made things I\u2019d ever seen. I wish I had my mom\u2019s gift for words to paint a better picture of it.\n\u201cTa-da,\u201d PARKER 17 said.\nThat wasn\u2019t what made me smile. Between the mounds of trash and tiny trees there was a paved path. Perfectly smooth tarmac. It had been years since I\u2019d seen pristine pavement.\n\u201cOne problem,\u201d the bot said. \u201cMy GPS. It\u2019s shot. In there.\u201d\n\u201cCan you use this?\u201d I pulled out the trail map Nat gave me from my pack. PARKER 17 peeked over my shoulder at it. \u201cWhere. Did you. Get this?\u201d\n\u201cFrom Nat, my friend,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s a trader who lives at the edge of the park.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you. Need to. Trade. For this?\u201d\n\u201cNot much,\u201d I said. \u201cI fixed her hands and a half dozen other things in her house.\u201d I didn\u2019t mention how she accepted me after I fled my hometown following the mudslide. Put up with me for weeks until my reluctant self worked up enough courage to leave. Or how, in exchange, I took the six jars on her windowsill after I found a note that said: These belong by the ocean too.\nI smoothed out the map again, refusing to meet the ranger bot\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan you work with this?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d it replied. But it didn\u2019t sound confident. Its LED was yellow.\nI didn\u2019t care. I clung to hope where I found it.\nI patted the space between my handlebars. \u201cHop up. I\u2019ll move fast on the pavement.\u201d\nPARKER 17 hesitated. Then slowly, carefully, it approached the bike, reached up, and wrapped four of its six legs around the frame.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ride, you navigate. Okay?\u201d I said.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d it whispered.\nIt was strange to have someone ride on my handlebars. It was something people did all the time in movies, but I\u2019d never done myself. For a few moments, it was like I was part of one of those stories, with sunshine and a happy ending.\nThe trail began to climb upward again, and the anxious knot in my stomach started uncurling. I was going the right way again. Snaking and threading between the huge mounds of trash, I spotted glimmers of rusty cookware and broken furniture and new plants.\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d I shouted into the wind.\n\u201cArt installation.\u201d\nWe passed hundreds of mounds. My dad would have loved this, I thought as I peddled and weaved. He was always adding decorations to our old barn. In another life, he would have probably been a set designer.\nWhen the trail split, PARKER 17 announced a direction, and I followed. Speeding on the smooth tarmac, it felt like flying.\nBut then, we hit a dead end. My stomach flipped. Flipped again.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d the bot said. \u201cThis un-updated map. Go back. A few turns.\u201d\nI did, and dutifully followed the bot\u2019s revised instructions. We seemed to be making progress up the mountain. Until we hit another dead end.\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d PARKER 17 whispered.\nWe tried dozens of combinations, tracing and retracing our journey. But the mounds were identical, or identical enough, and the beautiful paved path never led anywhere at all.\nThe last route we tried was something I picked based on the incline and growth of the trees, which got stubbier and squatter the higher we climbed.\nFor a moment, it seemed like a good plan. I dared to hope, despite my aching quads and calves. That is, until we dead-ended at the biggest, most impassible hill of trash I\u2019d seen yet.\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I asked, rubbing my hands through my sweat-soaked hair. I could feel them shaking through my scalp.\nPARKER 17 wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cI can never,\u201d it whispered. \u201cSave them.\u201d\nThat was when panic threatened to swallow me. There are hundreds of unfinished stories of travelers who took the cursed path and never made it home. It was a story I swore I would never become.\nI dismounted and sat on an old coffee table sticking out from one of the trash heaps. I desperately wanted to fix something. I looked down and saw my shaking hands and decided to fix myself. I pulled out the sandwich from my pack that Nat gave me that morning. Made myself chew the homemade bread and eggs and greens. Made myself hydrate. Made myself breathe.\n\u201cAny ideas?\u201d I asked.\nPARKER 17 didn\u2019t respond. It was muttering to itself miserably, kicking loose detritus around with its legs.\nSo, I heaved myself up and began studying the mounds. Up close it was a strange art installation. I\u2019d always wanted to be an artist, but surviving these days takes time. I wasn\u2019t like my parents. The way my dad could craft things, or my mom could spin stories. Sometimes I wondered what I could have become if I wasn\u2019t living in the dregs of civilization. A movie director, maybe. Instead, I became good at scavenging.\nWhich is probably how I spotted the hair-width trail snaking between two mounds.\n\u201cWait, what\u2019s that?\u201d I said.\nPARKER 17 followed where my finger pointed. It inched up the ghost of a path to get a better look. It didn\u2019t say anything for a long minute.\nThen, the LED in its torso flashed green.\nOne time, the widow finally, finally arrived at the impossible ocean on the top of the mountain.\nHer shoes were wrecked and every joint in her body ached.\nBut she made it.\nShe waded into the ocean and took a long drink. The water was brackish, but not as bitter as the stories made it out to be. She drank deeply.\nThen, she pulled out the eight jars of ashes from her bag and emptied them in the water. Watched as the ashes mingled and floated away.\nShe waited. Except, nothing happened.\nShe began to turn away, disappointment heavy in her chest, when she saw them. Her loved ones. Shimmering between the ripples of the lake. Smiling at her and waving and laughing soundlessly. She shouted out, began splashing toward them, but her loved ones kept swimming away from the shore, from her. Until they were only memories on the horizon.\nOnce again, the widow was the only one in her family left. With nothing except grief for company.\nFor a moment, she wondered if she should let that grief drown her.\nBut no. She\u2019d drank from the water and delivered the dead. She\u2019d survived the journey up the mountain. She\u2019d survive the trip back down.\nSo, she did. She returned to her deadbeat town and met a lonely farmer. Together they made a new home and a new family.\nThe widow survived and that was something. But she drank the water and it haunted her. She carried the weight of the ocean within her for the rest of her days.\nThe path between the trash mounds went up and up the mountain. It stretched on forever. Until it didn\u2019t.\nWhen I reached the impossible ocean, it took me a few seconds to understand what I was seeing. I didn\u2019t realize how high I\u2019d climbed. None of my family\u2019s stories explained that the mountain towered over the ones around it, so that standing here at the apex, there was only sky.\nBut I am slow and I am reluctant and that wasn\u2019t what I saw first. On the top of the mountain was a lake, so smooth and clear it looked like it was part of the sky. Or rather, the sky was a part of it.\nFrom where I stood it looked like the water stretched out forever. Like an ocean.\n\u201cDaaaamn,\u201d PARKER 17 said. \u201cStill beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cYou come here often?\u201d I asked, my voice choked with awe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s. Been a while,\u201d it admitted.\nWe made our way to the water\u2019s edge, carefully, like we were afraid to make too much noise. The summit was littered with empty packs and collapsed tents and lumps under moldy blankets that looked suspiciously like bodies. But for once, my scavenger instincts didn\u2019t prick with interest. Because crowded against the shoreline were hundreds of jars, glimmering like candles in the evening light. I crept close and saw many of the jars carried names on them. So many names.\nThe jars were still full of ashes.\nThis was where I started wondering if my family\u2019s stories were not completely honest. And because I\u2019m painfully slow, this was where I finally, finally realized who the characters in my family\u2019s stories were.\nSuddenly, I understood that if I studied all the jars on the shoreline, I\u2019d find one with my dad\u2019s looping, neat handwriting and eight with my mother\u2019s slanted, messy one.\n\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d PARKER 17 replied. \u201cJust stubborn.\u201d\nFrom the panniers, I pulled out Nat\u2019s jars, first, saying the names written on the caps as I did. Fredrick. Ravi. Esty. Johanna. Kai. Stu. I had no idea who they were in life, but I wished them peace.\nAnd then my parents.\n\u201cThe widow. The lost lover,\u201d I whispered as I nestled their ashes among the jars full of other stories.\nI\u2019d grown suspicious of my parents\u2019 stories, but I still stood there by the lake, among the dead, and hoped to see their ghosts swimming in the water.\nI waited. And waited.\nI saw nothing.\nThat was when the weight of being the only one left alive threatened to swallow me. Suddenly, I understood why there were days my mom couldn\u2019t get out of bed. Why there were days my dad was up and going through the motions, but not really there. Not really functioning.\nAnd I. I finally understood why I was on this path. It was the fear of watching the world die around you and suddenly, desperately wanting a drink from an impossible ocean that would tell you that you weren\u2019t alone, that you would survive. No matter the cost.\nI slid off my boots and inched through the jars and jars and jars, and into the impossible ocean that was really just a lake with a clever optical illusion. The water was cold enough to make me gasp, but not cold enough to stop me. I heard PARKER 17\u2019s legs splashing as it followed me.\nI stopped when water was at my hips. My hands were shaking as I cupped them together and filled them. I always wanted a happy ending, but that\u2019s not how my family\u2019s stories go.\nI brought my hands to my lips.\nPARKER 17\u2019s leg tapped against mine.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. For your loss.\u201d it said. \u201cBut. This. Won\u2019t. Make you. Feel better. I\u2019ve. Led so many. Here.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered. I didn\u2019t want to feel better though. I understood now why some travelers never left the top of the mountain.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d PARKER 17 said, after a moment. \u201cAbout. Your parents.\u201d\n\u201cThey were killed. Armed robbery,\u201d I said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. Your fault.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nAnd I did know, but I didn\u2019t really believe it. Just like I knew I probably wouldn\u2019t have seen my parents\u2019 ghosts swimming in the lake. But I hoped. I really hoped. I wanted to see them this one last time so I could apologize.\n\u201cThey told stories,\u201d I said. \u201cI think most of them were made up. But there was a lot of truth too.\u201d\n\u201cOnes with. Happy endings. I hope?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d I stared at the water cupped in my hands. It showed me nothing except my own distorted reflection. Me, full of stories. \u201cBut I think that was the point.\u201d\nIt was then I realized why my parents told me so many stories about the impossible ocean.\nI opened my fingers and let the water in my hands drain out.\n\u201cReally?\u201d PARKER 17 asked, surprised.\nI turned and smiled at it. \u201cI think I found the story I want to become.\u201d\nI turned and headed toward the shore. A moment later, I heard the bot splashing behind me.\nIf you must know. If you must have one more story to add to your collection about the impossible ocean, about the cursed path, then here\u2019s mine.\nOne time, a reluctant traveler took the cursed path to the impossible ocean because they didn\u2019t know there was another road. They had grown up on a steady diet of family stories that always had tragic endings. And now those stories were inside their head, their gut, their bones.\nSo, they climbed the cursed path, made it to the top of the mountain, held the water in their hands. It was only there that the reluctant traveler realized what they\u2019d been missing.\nTheir family\u2019s stories were part of them, but that didn\u2019t mean it was a story they had to become.\nA.T.

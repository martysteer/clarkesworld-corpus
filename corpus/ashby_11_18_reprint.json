She pinched and threw a map into Khalidah\u2019s lenses. Marshall\u2019s tug glowed there, spiraling ever closer to its target. Khalidah caught herself missing baseball. She squashed the sentiment immediately. It wasn\u2019t really the sport she missed, she reminded herself. She just missed her fantasy league. Phobos was much too far away to get a real game going; the lag was simply too long for her bets to cover any meaningful spread. She could run a model, of course, and had even filled one halfway during the trip out. It wasn\u2019t the same.\n Besides, it was more helpful to participate in hobbies she could share with the others. The counselors had been very clear on that subject. She was better off participating in Game Night, and the monthly book club they maintained with the Girl Scouts and Guides of North America.\n \u201cHe\u2019s on time,\u201d Donna said. \u201cStop worrying.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Khalidah said. And she wasn\u2019t. Not really. Not about when he would arrive.\n Donna pushed away from the terminal. She looked older than she had when they\u2019d landed. They\u2019d all aged, of course\u2014the trip out and the lack of real produce hadn\u2019t exactly done any of them any favors\u2014but Donna seemed to have changed more dramatically than Khalidah or Brooklyn or Song. She\u2019d cut most of her hair off, and now the silver that once sparkled along her roots was the only color left. The exo-suit hung loose on her. She hadn\u2019t been eating. Everyone hated the latest rotation of rations. Who on Earth\u2014literally, who?\u2014thought that testing the nutritional merits of a traditional Buddhist macrobiotic diet in space was a good idea? What sadistic special-interest group had funded that particular line of research?\n \u201cIt will be fine,\u201d Donna said. \u201cWe will be fine.\u201d\n \u201cI just don\u2019t want things to change.\u201d\n \u201cThings always change,\u201d Donna said. \u201cGod is change. Right, Octavia?\u201d The station spoke: \u201cRight, Donna.\u201d\n Khalidah folded her arms. \u201cSo do we have to add an Arthur, just for him? Or a Robert? Or an Isaac? Or a Philip?\u201d\n The station switched its persona to Alice B. Sheldon. Its icon spun like a coin in the upper right of Khalidah\u2019s vision. \u201cWe already have a James,\u201d the station said. The icon winked.\n \u201cKhalidah, look at me,\u201d Donna said. Khalidah defocused from the In-Vision array and met the gaze of her mission manager. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d the older woman said. \u201cBut nothing out here is. We already have plenty of data about our particular group. You think there won\u2019t be sudden changes to group dynamics, down there?\u201d\n She pointed. And there it was: red and rusty, the color of old blood. Mars.\n His name was Cody Marshall. He was Florida born and bred, white, with white-blond hair and a tendency toward rosacea. He held a PhD in computer science from Mudd. He\u2019d done one internship in Syria, building drone-supported mesh nets, and another in Alert, Nunavut. He\u2019d coordinated the emergency repair of an oil pipeline there using a combination of declassified Russian submersibles and American cable-monitoring drones. He\u2019d managed the project almost single-handedly after the team lead at Alert killed himself.\n Now here he was on Phobos, sent to debug the borehole driller on Mars. A recent solar storm had completely fried the drill\u2019s comms systems; Donna insisted it needed a complete overhaul, and two heads were better than one. Marshall couldn\u2019t do the job from home\u2014they\u2019d lose days reprogramming the things on the fly, and the drill bits were in sensitive places. One false move and months of work might collapse around billions of dollars of research, crushing it deep into the red dirt. He needed to be close. After all, he\u2019d written much of the code himself.\n This was his first flight.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be an astronaut,\u201d he\u2019d told them over the lag, when they first met. \u201cI got into this because I loved robots. That\u2019s all. I had no idea this is where I would wind up. But I\u2019m really grateful to be here. I know it\u2019s a change.\u201d\n \u201cIf you make a toilet seat joke, we\u2019ll delete your porn,\u201d Song said, now. When they all laughed, she looked around at the crowd. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny? I\u2019m serious. I didn\u2019t come all the way out here to play out a sitcom.\u201d\n Marshall snapped his fingers. \u201cThat reminds me.\u201d He rifled through one of the many pouches he\u2019d lugged on board. \u201cYour mom sent this along with me.\u201d He coasted a vial through the air at her. Inside, a small crystal glinted. \u201cThat\u2019s your brother\u2019s wedding. And your new nephew\u2019s baptism. Speaking of sitcoms. She told me some stories to tell you. She didn\u2019t want to record them\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s very nervous about recording anything.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014so she told me to tell them to you.\u201d\n Song rolled her eyes. \u201cAre they about Uncle Chan-wook?\u201d\n Marshall\u2019s pale eyebrows lifted high on his pink forehead. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d\n Again, the room erupted in laughter. Brooklyn laughed the loudest. She was a natural flirt. Her parents had named her after a borough they\u2019d visited only once. In high school, she had self-published a series of homoerotic detective novels set in ancient Greece. The profits financed med school. After that, she hit Parsons for an unconventional residency. She\u2019d worked on the team that designed the exo-suits they now wore. She had already coordinated Marshall\u2019s fitting over the lag. It fit him well. At least, Brooklyn seemed pleased. She was smiling so wide that Khalidah could see the single cavity she\u2019d sustained in all her years of eschewing most refined sugars.\n Khalidah rather suspected that Brooklyn had secretly advocated for the macrobiotic study. Chugging a blue algae smoothie every morning seemed like her kind of thing. Khalidah had never asked about it. It was better not to know.\n But wasn\u2019t that the larger point of this particular experiment? To see if they could all get along? To see if women\u2014with their lower caloric needs, their lesser weight, their quite literally cheaper labor, in more ways than one\u2014could get the job done on Phobos? Sure, they were there on a planetary protection mission to gather the last remaining soil samples before the first human-oriented missions showed up, thereby ensuring the \u201cchain of evidence\u201d for future DNA experimentation. But they all knew\u2014didn\u2019t they\u2014what this was really about. How the media talked about them. How the Internet talked about them. Early on, before departure, Khalidah had seen the memes.\n For Brooklyn, Marshall had a single chime. Brooklyn\u2019s mother had sent it to \u201cclear the energy\u201d of the station. During the Cold Lake training mission, she\u2019d sent a Tibetan singing bowl.\n For Khalidah, he had all 4,860 games of last year\u2019s regular season. \u201cIt\u2019s lossless,\u201d he said. \u201cAll 30 teams. Even the crappy ones. One of our guys down at Kennedy, he has a brother-in-law in Orlando, works at ESPN. They got in touch with your dad, and, well . . . \u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Khalidah said.\n \u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d Marshall cleared his throat. He rocked on his toes, pitched a little too far forward, and wheeled his arms briefly to recover his balance. If possible, he turned even pinker, so the color of his face now matched the color of his ears. \u201cSo. Here you go. I don\u2019t know what else is on there, but, um . . . there it is. Enjoy.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d Khalidah lifted the vial of media from his hand. Her crystal was darker than Song\u2019s. Denser. It had been etched more often. She stuffed it in the right breast pocket of her suit. If for some reason her heart cut out and the suit had to give her a jolt, the crystal would be safe.\n \u201cAnd for you, Donna. Here\u2019s what we talked about. They gave you double, just in case.\u201d\n Donna\u2019s hand was already out. It shook a little as Marshall placed a small bottle in it. The label was easy to see. Easy to read. Big purple letters branded on the stark white sticker. Lethezine. The death drug. The colony of nanomachines that quietly took over the brain, shutting off major functions silently and painlessly. The best, most dignified death possible. The kind you had to ask the government for personally, complete with letters of recommendation from people with advanced degrees that could be revoked if they lied, like it was a grant application or admission to a very prestigious community. Which in fact it was.\n \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Brooklyn asked.\n It was a stupid question. Everyone knew exactly what it was. She was just bringing it out into the open. They\u2019d been briefed on that. On making the implicit become explicit. On voicing what had gone unasked. Speaking the unspeakable. It was, in fact, part of the training. There were certain things you were supposed to suppress. And other things that you couldn\u2019t let fester. They had drilled on it, over and over, at Cold Lake and in Mongolia and again and again during role-plays with the station interface.\n \u201cWhy do you have that?\u201d Brooklyn continued, when Donna didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWhy would he give that to you?\u201d\n Donna pocketed the bottle before she opened her mouth to speak. When she did, she lifted her gaze and stared at each of them in turn. She smiled tightly. For the first time, Khalidah realized the older woman\u2019s grimace was not borne of impatience, but rather simple animal pain. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m dying,\u201d she said.\n She said it like it was a commonplace event. Like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s because I\u2019m painting the kitchen,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s because I took the dog for a walk.\u201d\n In her lenses, Khalidah saw the entire group\u2019s auras begin to flare. The auras were nothing mystical, nothing more than ambient indicators of what the sensors in the suits were detecting: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, odd little twitches of muscle fibers. She watched them move from baseline green to bruise purple\u2014the color of tension, of frustration. Only Song remained calm: her aura its customary frosty mint green, the same shade once worn by astronauts\u2019 wives at the advent of the Space Race.\n \u201cYou knew?\u201d she managed to say, just as Marshall said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them?\u201d\n Khalidah whirled to stare at him. His mouth hung open. He squinted at Donna, then glanced around the group. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. \u201cWait. Let\u2019s just take a minute. I . . . \u201d He swallowed. \u201cI need a minute. You . . . \u201d He spun in place and pointed at Donna. \u201cThis was a shitty thing to do. I mean, really, truly, deeply, profoundly not cool. Lying to your team isn\u2019t cool. Setting me up to fail isn\u2019t cool.\u201d\n \u201cI have a brain tumor,\u201d Donna said blandly. \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily in my right mind.\u201d\n \u201cDonna,\u201d Song said quietly.\n Oh, God. Donna was dying. She was dying and she hadn\u2019t told them and minty-green Song had known about it the whole damn time.\n \u201cYou knew,\u201d Khalidah managed to say.\n \u201cOf course she knew,\u201d Donna said. \u201cShe\u2019s our doctor.\u201d\n Donna was dying. Donna would be dead, soon. Donna had lied to all of them.\n \u201cIt\u2019s inoperable,\u201d Donna added, as though talking about a bad seam in her suit and not her gray matter. \u201cAnd in any case, I wouldn\u2019t want to operate on it. I still have a few good months here\u2014\u201d\n \u201cA few months?\u201d Brooklyn was crying. The tears beaded away from her face and she batted at them, as though breaking them into smaller pieces would somehow dismantle the grief and its cause. \u201cYou have months? That\u2019s it?\u201d\n \u201cMore or less.\u201d Donna shrugged. \u201cI could make it longer, with chemo, or nano. But we don\u2019t have those kinds of therapies here. Even if we did, and the tumor did shrink, Song isn\u2019t a brain surgeon, and the lag is too slow for Dr. Spyder to do something that delicate.\u201d She jerked a thumb at the surgical assistant in its cubby. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the fact that I don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n There was an awful silence filled only by the sounds of the station: the water recycler, the rasp of air in the vents, an unanswered alert chiming on and off, off and on. It was the sound the drill made when it encountered issues of structural integrity and wanted a directive on how to proceed. If they didn\u2019t answer it in five more minutes, the chime would increase in rate and volume. If they didn\u2019t answer it after another five minutes, the drill itself would relay a message via the rovers to tell mission control they were being bad parents.\n And none of that mattered now. At least, Khalidah could not make it matter, in her head. She could not pull the alert into the \u201curgent\u201d section of her mind. Because Donna was dying, Donna would be dead soon, Donna was in all likelihood going to kill herself right here on the station and what would they do\u2014\n Donna snapped her fingers and opened the alert. She pushed it over to tactical array where they could all see it. \u201cMarshall, go and take a look.\u201d\n Marshall seemed glad of any excuse to leave the conversation. He drifted over to the array and started pulling apart the alert with his fingers. His suit was still so new that his every swipe and pinch and pull worked on the first try. His fingers hadn\u2019t worn down yet. Not like theirs. Not like Donna\u2019s.\n \u201cCan you do that?\u201d Khalidah asked Donna. When Donna didn\u2019t answer, she focused on Song. \u201cCan she do that?\u201d\n Song\u2019s face closed. She was in full physician mode now. Gone was the cheerful woman with the round face who joked about porn. Had the person they\u2019d become friends with ever truly been real? Was she always this cold, underneath? Was it being so far away from Earth that made it so easy for her to lie to them? \u201cIt\u2019s her body, Khal. She doesn\u2019t have any obligation to force it to suffer.\u201d\n Khalidah tried to catch Donna\u2019s eye. \u201cYou flew with the Air Force. You flew over Syria and Sudan. You\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYes, and whatever I was exposed to there probably had a hand in this,\u201d Donna muttered. \u201cThe buildings, you know. They released all kinds of nasty stuff. Like first responder syndrome, but worse.\u201d She pinched her nose. It was the only sign she ever registered of a headache. \u201cBut it\u2019s done, now, Khalidah. I\u2019ve made my decision.\u201d\n \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe all knew this might be a one-way trip,\u201d Song added.\n \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me, Song,\u201d Khalidah snapped.\n \u201cThen grow up,\u201d Song sighed. \u201cDonna put this in her living will ages ago. Long before she even had her first flight. She was preapproved for Lethezine, thanks to her family\u2019s cancer history. There was always a chance that she would get cancer on this trip, given the radiation exposure. But her physicians decided it was an acceptable risk, and she chose to come here in full awareness of that risk.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m right here, you know,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet.\u201d\n \u201cYou could still retire,\u201d Khalidah heard herself say. \u201cYou could go private. Join a board of trustees somewhere, or something like that. They\u2019d cover a subscription, maybe they could get you implants\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want implants, Khal, I want to die here\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI brought some implants,\u201d Marshall said, without turning around. He slid one last number into place, then wiped away the display. Now he turned. He took a deep breath, as though he\u2019d rehearsed this speech the whole trip over. Which he probably had. Belatedly, Khalidah noticed the length of his hair and fingernails. God, he\u2019d done the whole trip alone. The station couldn\u2019t bear more than one extra; as it was, he\u2019d needed to bring extra scrubbers and promise to spend most of the time in his own hab docked to theirs.\n \u201cI brought implants,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019re prototypes. No surgery necessary. Houston insisted. They wanted to give you one last chance to change your mind.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not going to change my mind,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI want to die here.\u201d\n \u201cPlease stop saying that.\u201d Brooklyn wiped her eyes. \u201cPlease just stop saying that.\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Donna said, in her maddening why-isn\u2019t-everyone-as-objective-about-this-as-I-am way. \u201cMy whole life, I\u2019ve wanted to go to Mars. And now I\u2019m within sight of it. I\u2019m not going to leave just because there\u2019s a lesion on my brain. Not when I just got here.\u201d She huffed. \u201cBesides. I\u2019d be no good to any of you on chemo. I\u2019d be sick.\u201d\n \u201cYou are sick,\u201d Khalidah snapped.\n \u201cNot that sick.\u201d Song lifted her gaze from her nails and gestured at the rest of them. \u201cNone of you noticed, did you? Both of you thought she was fine.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, no thanks to you.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with me. She\u2019s my patient. I\u2019d respect your right to confidentiality the same way I respected hers.\u201d\n \u201cYou put the mission at risk,\u201d Khalidah said.\n \u201cOh my God, Khal, stop talking like them.\u201d Brooklyn\u2019s voice was still thick with tears. \u201cYou\u2019re not mission control. This has nothing to do with the mission\u201d\n \u201cIt has everything to do with the mission!\u201d Khalidah rounded on Donna. \u201cHow could you do this? How could you not tell us? This entire experiment hinges on social cohesion. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re here to prove . . . \u201d\n Now the silence had changed into something wholly other. It was much heavier now. Much more accusatory. Donna folded her arms.\n \u201cWhat are we here to prove, Khalidah?\u201d\n Khalidah shut her eyes. She would be professional. She would not cry. She would not get angry. At least, no angrier than she already was. She would not focus on Donna\u2019s betrayal, and her deceit, and the fact that she had the audacity to pull this bullshit so soon after . . . Khalidah took a deep breath.\n She would put it aside. Humans are containers of emotion. She made herself see the words in the visualizing interface they had for moments like this. When someone else\u2019s emotions spill out, it\u2019s because their container is full. She focused on her breathing. She pictured the color of her aura changing in the others\u2019 lenses. She imagined pushing the color from purple to green, healing it slowly, as though it were the evidence of a terrible wound.\n \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Donna said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not here to prove any one particular thing or another. We\u2019re here to run experiments, gather the last Martian samples before the crewed missions begin, and observe the drills as they dig out the colony. That\u2019s all we\u2019re here to do. You may feel pressure to do something else, due to the nature of this team, but that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. The work comes first. The policy comes later.\u201d\n The Morr\u00edgu was divided into three pods: Badb, Macha, and Nemain. No one referred to them that way, of course\u2014only Marshall had the big idea to actually try stumbling through ancient Gaelic with his good ol\u2019 boy accent. He gave up after two weeks. Nonetheless, he still referred to his unit as the Corvus.\n \u201cNice of them to stick with the crow theme,\u201d he said.\n \u201cRavens are omens of death,\u201d Donna said, and just like that, Game Night was over. That was fine with Khalidah. Low-gravity games never had the degree of complexity she liked; they had magnetic game boards, but they weren\u2019t entirely the same. And without cards or tokens they couldn\u2019t really visualize the game in front of them, and basically played permutations of Werewolf or Mafia until they learned each other\u2019s tells.\n Not that all that experience had helped her read Donna and Song\u2019s dishonesty. Even after all their time spent together, in training, on the flight, on the station, there was the capacity for betrayal. Even now, she did not truly know them.\n Not yet, Khalidah often repeated to herself, as the days stretched on. Not yet. Not for the first time, she wished for a return to 24-hour days. Once upon a time, they had seemed so long. She had yearned for afternoons to end, for lectures to cease, for shifts to close. Now she understood that days on Earth were beautifully, mercifully short.\n Sometimes Khalidah caught Donna watching her silently, when she didn\u2019t think Khalidah would notice. When Khalidah met her eyes, Donna would try to smile. It was more a crinkling of the eyes than anything else. It was hard to tell if she was in pain, or unhappy, or both. The brain had no nerve endings of its own, no pain receptors. The headaches that Donna felt were not the tissue\u2019s response to her tumor, but rather a warning sign about a crowded nerve, an endless alarm that rang down through her spinal column and caused nausea and throbbing at odd hours. Or so she said.\n Khalidah\u2019s first email was to her own psychiatrist on Earth, through her personal private channel. It was likely the very same type of channel Donna had used to carry on her deception. Can a member of crew just hide any medical condition they want? she wrote.\n Your confidentiality and privacy are paramount, Dr. Hassan wrote back from Detroit. You have sacrificed a great deal of privacy to go on this mission. You live in close quarters, quite literally right on top of each other. So the private channels you have left are considered sacrosanct. Communications between any participant and her doctor must remain private until the patient chooses to disclose.\n This was not the answer Khalidah had wanted to hear.\n Imagine if it were you who had a secret, Dr. Hassan continued, as though having anticipated Khalidah\u2019s feelings on the matter. If you were experiencing the occasional suicidal ideation, for example, would you want your whole crew to know, or would you wait for the ideations to pass?\n It was a valid counterargument. Mental health was a major concern on long-haul missions. Adequate care required stringent privacy. But Donna\u2019s cancer wasn\u2019t a passing thought about how much easier it would be to be dead. She was actually dying. And she hadn\u2019t told them.\n Now, after all that silence on the matter, the cancer seemed to be all anyone could talk about.\n \u201cI\u2019ve almost trained the pain to live on Martian time,\u201d Donna said, one morning. \u201cMost patients feel pain in the morning, but they feel it on an Earth schedule, with full sunlight.\u201d\n Khalidah could not bring herself to smile back, not yet. Doing so felt like admitting defeat.\n \u201cShe won\u2019t die any slower just because you\u2019re mad at her,\u201d Brooklyn said, as they conducted seal checks on the suits.\n \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d Khalidah said. Brooklyn just shrugged and got on with the checklist. A moment later, she asked for a flashlight. Khalidah handed it to her without a word.\n \u201cHave you watched any of the games your dad sent?\u201d Marshall asked, the next day.\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t bring him up,\u201d Khalidah said.\n Five weeks later, the vomiting started. It was an intriguing low-gravity problem\u2014barf bags were standard, but carrying them around wasn\u2019t. And Donna couldn\u2019t just commandeer the shop-vac for her own personal use. In the end, Marshall made her a little butterfly net, of sorts, with an iris at one end. It was like a very old-fashioned nebulizer for inhaling asthma medication. Only it worked in the other direction.\n Not coincidentally, Marshall had brought with him an entire liquid diet intended specifically for cancer patients. Donna switched, and things got better.\n \u201cI\u2019ll stick around long enough to get the last samples from Hellas,\u201d she said, sipping a pouch of what appeared to be either a strawberry milkshake or an anti-nausea tonic. She coughed. The cough turned into a gag that she needed to suppress. She clenched a fist and then unclenched it, to master it. \u201cI want my John Hancock on those damn things.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see the landing?\u201d Marshall asked. \u201cYou know, hand over the keys, see their faces when they see the ant farm in person for the first time?\u201d\n \u201cWhat, and watch them fuck up all our hard work?\u201d\n They all laughed. All of them but Khalidah. How could they just act like everything was normal? Did the crew of the Ganesha mission even know that Donna was sick? Would the team have to explain it? How would that conversation even happen? (\u201cWelcome to Mars. Sorry, but we\u2019re in the middle of a funeral. Anyway, try not to get your microbes everywhere.\u201d )\n Then the seizures started. They weren\u2019t violent. More like gentle panic attacks. \u201cMy arm doesn\u2019t feel like my arm anymore,\u201d Donna said, as she continued to man her console with one hand. \u201cNo visual changes, though. Just localized disassociation.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s a great band name,\u201d Marshall said.\n Morr\u00edgu tried to help, in her own way. The station gently reminded Khalidah of all the things that she already knew: that she was distracted, that she wasn\u2019t sleeping, that she would lie awake listening for the slightest tremor in Donna\u2019s breathing, and that sometimes Brooklyn would reach up from her cubby and squeeze Khalidah\u2019s ankle because she was listening too. The station made herself available in the form of the alters, often pinging Khalidah when her gaze failed to track properly across a display, or when her blood pressure spiked, or when she couldn\u2019t sleep. Ursula, most often, but then Octavia. God is Change, the station reminded her. The only lasting truth is Change.\n And Khalidah knew that to be true. She did. She simply drew no comfort from it. Too many things had changed already. Donna was dying. Donna, who had calmly helped her slide the rods into the sleeves as they pitched tents in Alberta one dark night while the wolves howled and the thermometer dropped to 30 below. Donna, who had said, \u201cOf course you can do it. That\u2019s not the question,\u201d when Khalidah reached between the cots during isolation week and asked Donna if the older woman thought she was really tough enough to do the job. Donna, without whom Khalidah might have quit at any time.\n \u201cYou watch any of those games yet?\u201d Marshall asked, when he caught her staring down at the blood-dark surface of the planet. Rusted, old. Not like the wine-dark samples that Song drained from Donna each week.\n Khalidah only shook her head. Baseball seemed so stupid now.\n \u201cYour dad, he really wanted to get those to you before I left,\u201d Marshall reminded her.\n Khalidah took a deep, luxuriant breath. \u201cI told you not to mention him, Marshall. I asked you nicely. Are you going to respect those boundaries, or are we going to have a problem?\u201d\n Marshall said nothing, at first. Instead he drifted in place, holding the nearest grip to keep himself tethered. He hadn\u2019t learned how to tuck himself in yet, how to twist and wring himself so that he passed through without touching anyone else. Everything about his presence there still felt wrong.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be friends,\u201d he said, in measured tones. He pointed down into Storage. \u201cBut the others, they\u2019re your friends. Or they thought they were. Until now.\u201d\n \u201cThey lied to me.\u201d\n \u201cOh, come on. You think it wasn\u2019t tough for Song to go through that? You think she enjoyed it, not telling you? Jesus Christ, Khalidah. Maybe you haven\u2019t noticed, but a lot of us made a lot of sacrifices to get this far.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it was so difficult for you, finding out you\u2019d get to go to Mars\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014Phobos.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014Phobos, without anything like the training we had to endure, just so you could pilot your finicky fucking drill God knows where\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHey, now, I happen to like my finicky fucking drill very fucking much,\u201d Marshall said. He blinked. Then covered his face with his hands. He\u2019d filed his nails down and buzzed his hair in solidarity with Donna. His entire skull was flushed the color of a new spring geranium. \u201cThat . . . didn\u2019t come out right.\u201d\n Khalidah hung in place. She drew her knees up to her chest and floated. It had been a long time since she\u2019d experienced secondhand embarrassment. Something about sharing such a tiny space with the others for so long ground it out of a person. But she was embarrassed for Marshall now. Not as embarrassed as he was, thank goodness. But embarrassed.\n \u201cThey sent me alone, you know,\u201d he said, finally, through the splay of his fingers. He scrubbed at the bare stubble of his skull. \u201cAlone. Do you even know what that means? You know all those desert island questions in job interviews? When they ask you what books you\u2019d bring, if you were stranded in the middle of nowhere? Well, I read all of those. War and Peace. Being and Nothingness. Do you have any idea how good I am at solitaire, by now?\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t be good at solitaire, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBut I did it, because they said it was the best chance for giving Donna extra time. If they\u2019d sent two of us, you\u2019d all have to go home a hell of a lot faster. You wouldn\u2019t be here when Ganesha arrives. So I did it. I got here. Alone. I did the whole trip by myself. So you and Donna and the whole crew could have more time.\u201d\n Khalidah swallowed hard. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d\n \u201cYes. I\u2019m finished.\u201d He pushed himself off the wall, then bounced away and twisted back to face her. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not. I think you\u2019re being a total hypocrite, and I think it\u2019s undermining whatever social value the Morr\u00edgu experiment was meant to have.\u201d\n Khalidah felt her eyebrows crawl up to touch the edges of her veil. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. You heard me. You\u2019re being a hypocrite.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cDo your friends even know your dad died? Did you tell them that he was dying, when you left? Because I was told not to mention it, and that sure as hell sounds like a secret to me.\u201d\n Khalidah closed her eyes. The only place to go, in a space this small, was inward. There was no escape, otherwise. She waited until that soft darkness had settled around her and then asked, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\n \u201cBecause you\u2019re not alone, out here. You have friends. Friends you\u2019ve known and worked with for years, in one way or another. So what if Donna jerked you around? She jerked me around too, and you don\u2019t see me acting like a brat about it. Or Brooklyn. Or Song. Meanwhile you\u2019ve been keeping this massive life-changing event from them this whole time.\u201d\n Now Khalidah\u2019s eyes opened. She had no need for that comforting blanket of darkness now. \u201cMy father dying is not a massive life-changing event,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou think you know all my secrets? You don\u2019t know shit, Marshall. Because if you did, you\u2019d know that I haven\u2019t spoken to that bastard in 10 years.\u201d\n As though trying to extract some final usefulness from their former mistress, the drills decided to fail before the Banshee units returned with their samples, and before Ganesha arrived with the re-up and the Mars crew. Which meant that when Ganesha landed, the crew would have to live in half-dug habs.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the goddamn perchlorate,\u201d Donna whispered. She had trouble swallowing now, and it meant her voice was constantly raw. \u201cI told them we should have gone with the Japanese bit. It drilled the Shinkansen, I said. Too expensive, they said. Now the damn thing\u2019s rusted all to shit.\u201d\n Which was exactly the case. The worm dried up suddenly, freezing in place\u2014a \u201cBertha Bork,\u201d like the huge drill that stalled under Seattle during an ill-fated transit project. They\u2019d rehearsed this particular error. First they ordered all the rovers away in case of a sinkhole, and then started running satellites over the sink. And the drill himself told them what was wrong. The blades were corroded. After five years of work, too much of the red dirt had snuck down into the drill\u2019s workings. It would need to be dug out and cleaned before it could continue. Or it would need to be replaced entirely.\n The replacement prototype was already built. It had just completed its first test run in the side of a flattened mountain in West Virginia. It was strong and light and better articulated than the worm. But the final model was supposed to come over with Ganesha. And in the meantime, the hab network still needed major excavation.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the risk if we send one of the rovers to try to uncover it?\u201d Song asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one in the cage; it wrapped up its mission ages ago. Wouldn\u2019t be too hard to reconfigure.\u201d\n \u201cPhobos rovers might be too light,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBut the real problem is the crashberry; it\u2019ll take three days to inflate and another week to energize. And that\u2019s a week we\u2019re not drilling.\u201d\n \u201cWe could tell Ganesha to slow down,\u201d Khalidah said.\n \u201cThey\u2019re ballistic capture,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIf they slow down now, they lose serious momentum.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019d pick it up on arrival, though.\u201d\n \u201cYeah . . . \u201d Marshall sucked his teeth. \u201cBut they\u2019re carrying a big load. They could jackknife once they hit the well, if they don\u2019t maintain a steady speed.\u201d He scrubbed at the thin dusting of blonde across his scalp. \u201cBut we have to tell them about this, either way. Wouldn\u2019t be right, not updating them.\u201d\n Khalidah snorted. The others ignored her.\n \u201cCan we redirect the Banshees?\u201d Brooklyn asked. \u201cWhiskey and Tango are the closest. We could have them dump their samples, set a pin, tell them to dig out the worm, and then come back.\u201d\n Khalidah shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re already full. They\u2019re on their way to the mail drop. If we redeployed them now, they wouldn\u2019t be in position when Ganesha arrives. Besides, they\u2019re carrying Hellas\u2014we can\u2019t afford to compromise them.\u201d\n \u201cThose samples are locked up like Fort Knox,\u201d Brooklyn said. \u201cWhat, are you worried that the crew of Ganesha will open them up by mistake? Because that\u2019s pretty much guaranteed not to happen.\u201d\n \u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a storm in between Whiskey and the worm,\u201d Marshall said. He pointed at an undulating pattern of lines on the screen between two blinking dots. \u201cIf we send Whiskey now, we might lose her forever. And the samples. And we still wouldn\u2019t be any further with the drill. Fuck.\u201d\n He pushed away from the console, knuckling his eyes. Khalidah watched the planet. In the plate glass, she caught Donna watching her. Her friend was much thinner now. They\u2019d had to turn off her suit, because it no longer fit snugly enough to read her heartbeat. Her breath came in rasps. She coughed often. Last month, Song speculated that the cancer had spread to her lungs; Donna claimed not to care very much. Khalidah heard the older woman sigh slow and deep. And she knew, before Donna even opened her mouth, what she was about to suggest.\n \u201cThere\u2019s always the Corvus,\u201d Donna said.\n \u201cNo,\u201d Khalidah said. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n But Donna wasn\u2019t even looking at her. She was looking at Marshall. \u201cHow much fuel did they really send, Marshall? You got here awfully fast.\u201d\n Marshall licked his lips. \u201cBetween what I have left over and what Ganesha is leaving behind for you midway, there\u2019s enough to send you home.\u201d\n \u201cWhich means Corvus has just enough to send me down, and give me thrust to come back.\u201d\n \u201cEven if that were true, you could still have a seizure while doing the job,\u201d Song said.\n \u201cThen I\u2019ll take my anti-seizure medication before I leave,\u201d Donna said.\n \u201cThe gravity would demolish you, with the state you\u2019re in,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt should be me. I should go. I know Corvus better, and my bone density is\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s very gallant of you, Mr. Marshall, but I outrank you,\u201d Donna reminded him. \u201cYes, I tire easily. Yes, it\u2019s hard for me to breathe. But I\u2019m stronger than I would be if I were on chemo. And the suit can both give me some lift and push a good air mix for me. Right, Brooklyn?\u201d\n Brooklyn beamed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n \u201cAnd Marshall, if any of those things do occur, I need you up here to remote-pilot Corvus from topside and get the samples back here.\u201d She gestured at the map. \u201cIf you tell Tango to meet me, I can take her samples and put them on Corvus. Then I get in Tango\u2019s cargo compartment and drive her around the storm, to the worm. I dig out the drill, and you restart it from up here. When I come back, you have the samples, and Ganesha has another guest room.\u201d She grinned. The smile made her face into a skull. \u201cEasy peasy,\u201d Donna said.\n \u201cYou know you\u2019re making history, right?\u201d Marshall asked, as they performed the final checks on Corvus. \u201cFirst human on Mars, and all that. You\u2019re stealing Ganesha\u2019s thunder.\u201d\n Donna coughed. \u201cDon\u2019t jinx it, Marshall.\u201d\n \u201cHow are your hands?\u201d\n Donna held them up. Slowly, she crunched her thickly gloved digits into fists. \u201cThey\u2019re okay.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good. Go slow. The Banshees take a light touch.\u201d\n \u201cI know that, Marshall.\u201d\n He pinked. \u201cI know you know. But I\u2019m just reminding you. Now, I\u2019ll get you down there, smooth as silk, and when it\u2019s time to come home you just let us know, okay?\u201d\n Donna\u2019s head tilted. She did that when she was about to ask an important question. For a moment it reminded Khalidah so much of the woman she\u2019d been and the woman they\u2019d lost that she forgot to breathe. \u201cIs it home now, for you?\u201d\n Marshall\u2019s blush deepened. He really did turn the most unfortunate shade of sunburned red. \u201cI guess so,\u201d he said. \u201cBrooklyn, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d\n Brooklyn breezed in and, flipping herself to hang upside down, performed the final checks on Donna\u2019s suit. \u201cYou\u2019ve got eight hours,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry it couldn\u2019t be more. Tango is already on her way, and she\u2019ll be there to meet you when you land.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s Tango\u2019s charge like?\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s sprinting to meet you, so she\u2019ll be half-empty by the time she hits the rendezvous point,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a set of auxiliary batteries in the cargo area. You\u2019d have to move them to get into the cockpit anyhow.\u201d\n Donna nodded. The reality of what was about to happen was settling on them. How odd, Khalidah thought, to be weightless and yet to feel the gravity of Donna\u2019s mission tugging at the pit of her stomach. The first human on Mars. The first woman. The first cancer patient. She had read a metaphor of illness as another country, how patients became citizens of it, that place beyond the promise of life, and now she thought of Donna there on the blood-red sands, representing them. Not just a human, but a defiantly mortal one, one for whom all the life-extension dreams and schemes would never bear fruit. All the members of the Ganesha crew had augmentations to make their life on Mars more productive and less painful. Future colonists would doubtless have similar lifehacks. Donna was the only visitor who would ever set an unadulterated foot on that soil.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be watching your vitals the whole time,\u201d Song said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t like what I see, I\u2019ll tell Marshall to take control of Tango and bring you back.\u201d\n Donna cracked a smile. \u201cIs that for my benefit, or the machine\u2019s?\u201d\n \u201cBoth,\u201d Song said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you passing out and crashing millions of dollars\u2019 worth of machine learning and robotics.\u201d\n And then, too soon, the final checks were finished, and it was time for Donna to go. The others drifted to the other side of the airlock, and Brooklyn ran the final diagnostic of the detachment systems. Khalidah\u2019s hands twitched at her veil. She had no idea what to say. Why did you lie to us? Did you really think that would make this easier? What were you so afraid of?\n Donna regarded her from the interior of her suit. She looked so small inside it. Khalidah thought of her fragile body shaking inside its soft volumes, her thin neck and her bare skull juddering like a bad piece of video.\n \u201cI want\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Donna said. \u201cDon\u2019t, Khal. Not now.\u201d\n For the first time in a long time, Khalidah peeped at Donna\u2019s aura through the additional layer in her lenses\u2019 vision. It was deep blue, like a very wide and cold stretch of the sea. It was a color she had never seen on Donna. When she looked at her own pattern, it was much the same shade.\n Marshall chose this moment to poke his head in. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d\n Donna reached over to the airlock button. \u201cI have to go now, Khalidah.\u201d\n Before Khalidah could say anything, Marshall had tugged her backward. The door rolled shut. For a moment she watched Donna through the small bright circle of glass. Then Donna\u2019s helmet snapped shut and she wore a halo within a halo, like a bull\u2019s-eye.\n The landing was as Marshall promised: smooth as silk. With Corvus he was in his element. He and the vessel knew each other well. They\u2019d moved as much of Corvus\u2019 cargo as they could into temporary storage outside the hab; the reduced weight would give Donna the extra boost on the trip back that she might need.\n Donna herself rode out the landing better than any of them expected. She took her time unburdening herself of her restraints, and they heard her breathing heavily, trying to choke back the nausea that now dominated her daily life. But eventually she lurched free of the unit, tuned up the jets on her suit, jiggered her air mix, and began the unlocking procedure to open Corvus. They watched her gloved hands hovering over the final lock.\n \u201cI hope you\u2019re not expecting some cheesy bullshit about giant leaps for womankind,\u201d Donna said, panting audibly. She sounded sheepish. For Donna, that meant she was nervous. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have time to prepare any remarks. I have a job to do.\u201d\n Brooklyn wiped her eyes and covered her mouth. Marshall passed her a tissue, and took one for himself.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve wanted this since you were a little girl, Donna,\u201d Song said. \u201cGo out there and get it.\u201d\n Together they watched the lock spin open, and Donna eased herself out. There was Tango, ready and waiting. And there was Mars, or at least their little corner of it, raw and open and red like a wound.\n \u201cI wish I could smell it,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI wish I could taste the air. It feels strange to be here and yet not be here at the same time. You can stand here all you want and never really touch it.\u201d\n \u201cYou can look at the samples when you bring them back,\u201d Brooklyn managed to say.\n Donna said nothing, only silently made her way to Tango and moved the samples back to Corvus. Then she began the procedure to get Tango into manual. Her feed cut out a couple of times, but only briefly; they hadn\u2019t thought to test the signal on the cameras themselves. Her audio was fine, though, and Marshall talked her through when she had questions. In the end it ran like any other remote repair. Even the dig went well; clearing the dirt from the drill and restarting it from the control panel was a lot simpler than any of them had expected.\n Halfway back to Corvus, Tango slowly rolled to a stop.\n \u201cDonna, check your batteries,\u201d Marshall suggested.\n There was no answer. Only Donna\u2019s slow, wet breathing.\n \u201cDonna, copy?\u201d\n Nothing. They looked at Song; Song pulled up Donna\u2019s vitals. \u201cNo changes in her eye movements or alpha pattern,\u201d Song whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s not having a seizure. Donna. Donna! Do you need help?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Donna said, finally. \u201cI came here to do a job, and now I\u2019m finished with it. I\u2019m done.\u201d\n Something in Khalidah\u2019s stomach turned to ice. \u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she whispered, as Marshall began to say \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d over and over. He started bashing things on the console, running every override he could.\n \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, you crazy old broad,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI can get Tango to drive you back, you know!\u201d\n \u201cNot if I\u2019ve ripped out the receiver,\u201d Donna said. She sounded exhausted. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just stay here, thank you. Ganesha can deal with me when they come. You don\u2019t have to do it. You\u2019d have had to freeze me, anyway, and vibrate me down to crystal, like cat litter, and\u2014\u201d\n \u201cFuck. You.\u201d\n It was the first full complete sentence that Khalidah had spoken to her in months. So she repeated it.\n \u201cFuck you. Fuck you for lying to us. Again. Fuck you for this selfish fucking bullshit. Oh, you think you\u2019re being so romantic, dying on Mars. Well fuck you. We came here to prove we could live, not . . . \u201d Her lips were hot. Her eyes were hot. It was getting harder to breathe. \u201cNot whatever the fuck it is you think you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n Nothing.\n \u201cDonna, please don\u2019t,\u201d Brooklyn whispered in her most wheedling tone. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave us. We need you.\u201d She sounded like a child. Then again, Khalidah wasn\u2019t sure she herself sounded any better. Somehow this loss contained within it all the other losses she\u2019d ever experienced: her mother, her father, the slow pull away from the Earth and into the shared unknown.\n \u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d Marshall said, his voice calm and steady. \u201cIf you want to take the Lethezine, take the Lethezine. But you don\u2019t know how it works\u2014what if it doesn\u2019t go like you think it will, and you\u2019re alone and in pain down there? Why don\u2019t you come back up, and if something goes wrong, we\u2019ll be there to help?\u201d\n Silence. Was she deliberating? Could they change her mind? Khalidah strained to hear the sound of Tango starting back up again. They flicked nervous, tearful glances at each other.\n \u201cAre you just going to quit?\u201d Khalidah asked, when the silence stretched too long. \u201cAre you just going to run away, like this? Now that it\u2019s hard?\u201d\n \u201cYou have no idea how hard this is, Khal, and you\u2019ve never once thought to ask.\u201d\n It stung. Khalidah let the pain transform itself into anger. Anger, she decided, was the only way out of this problem. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want me to ask, given how you never told us anything until it was too late.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m dying!\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s your fault you didn\u2019t tell us! We would have\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou would have convinced me to go home.\u201d Donna chuckled. It became a cough. The cough lasted too long. \u201cBecause you love me, and you want me to live. And I love you, so I would have done it.\u201d She had another little coughing jag. \u201cBut the trouble with home is that there\u2019s nothing to go back to. I\u2019ve thrown my whole life into this. I\u2019ve had to pass on things\u2014real things\u2014to get to this place. But now that I\u2019m here, I know it was worth it. And that\u2019s how I want to end it. I don\u2019t want to die alone in a hospital surrounded by people who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s out here, or why we do this.\u201d\n Khalidah forced her voice to remain firm. \u201cAnd so you want to die alone, down there, surrounded by nothing at all?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not alone, Khal. You\u2019re with me. You\u2019re all with me, all the time.\u201d\n Brooklyn broke down. She pushed herself into one corner. Khalidah reached up, and held her ankle, tethering her into the group. She squeezed her eyes shut and felt tears bud away. Song\u2019s beautiful ponytail drifted across her face. Arms curled around Khalidah\u2019s body. Khalidah curled her arms around the others. They were a Gordian knot, hovering far above Donna, a problem she could not solve and could only avoid.\n \u201cThat\u2019s right, Donna,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe\u2019re here. We\u2019re right here.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied. I didn\u2019t want to. But I just . . .

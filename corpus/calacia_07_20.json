That was starting to bother Hiimar, who walked up and down, busy with spreadsheets, theoretical books, memos, and ideas weighing inside her head. And Karier did nothing but look at that damn image.\n\u201cIer,\u201d she called one more time, still being able to find patience somewhere. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking at that image all morning, please come help.\u201d\n\u201cIt was just nine hundred and sixty-seven kuynas,\u201d Karier said, checking the watch in his ring.\n\u201cFor the Stars\u2019 sake, Karier! We retracted that probe so long ago and all you do is stare at that, that . . . photograph.\u201d She pronounced the word in the human language, which felt weird to say. It was a sort of rolling language, sticking in the mouth, like melted koku sweet. \u201cThe linguists haven\u2019t even finished deciphering and we already have a significant amount of data to review, analyze, and interpret. All you can do to help is obsess over this single image?\u201d\nFor a moment, she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cWhy do they do this, Hiimar?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat is it they\u2019re doing?\u201d\nKarier turned to an open book on his desk. It was the volume twenty-seven of the Manual of Civilizations, but there was little help for him there.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a demonstration of love, Karier, you know it very well. The sociologists, the psychologists, all of them agreed already. What else could it be?\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know, it\u2019s a demonstration of love. But . . . it couldn\u2019t be just that.\u201d He turned and looked at Hiimar. \u201cCould it?\u201d His four eyes blinked, bright and anxious.\n\u201cKarier-lah, my little,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t study civilizations, psychology, or species behavior. You\u2019re an oceanographer. Now, would you please stop with these pointless questions and help me interpret these awful sounds? I can\u2019t stand to hear them all over again, I\u2019ve toggled my ears four times, they\u2019re hurt. All these things do is scream uuuurrrrghhhh and throw water somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re sea creatures, Hiimar.\u201d His gaze returned to the image. \u201cJust sea creatures,\u201d he said as he reluctantly turned off the display.\nAfter eighty-four hundred painful kuynas, Hiimar was sitting down on her armchair at the end of the day. She loved things like the probe they had retracted earlier\u2014it was great to have new info about a civilization of which almost nothing was known\u2014but she had to admit that she hated them sometimes. The labor it took! It mobilized hundreds of professionals of every known area, all of them bursting with theories, digging into old books as if looking for precious stones.\nNow, thanks to the Stars, she was sitting down, the hurtful muscles of her legs at last relaxed. She was all ready to enjoy a sleep that, although short, should be invigorating enough. Another full day of work awaited her tomorrow.\nAll ready. That is . . . until Karier-lah came back from the bath.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking . . . \u201d\nPlease, no, Hiimar thought, exhausted, her eyes closed.\n\u201cDo you think more people can do that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t. How many humans must be out there, billions? Those aren\u2019t the only ones who can do that.\u201d\n\u201cBut do you think that more than two can do it at the same time?\u201d\nHiimar had to open her eyes.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo one wondered that.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Hiimar said. \u201cImagine how it would be. It doesn\u2019t look very . . . doesn\u2019t look very practical to me, Karier. Another person can\u2019t fit there. Humans have small heads, but they are still pretty round. Imagine three kra-kri-kra balls together. If humans did it, they\u2019d get their cheeks stuck to one another\u2019s.\u201d She made a pause. \u201cAnd why am I talking about this?!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my point!\u201d Karier said. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that it\u2019s possible, after all they seem to have a very mushy, rubbery consistence. But surely it\u2019s not practical. So, if only two people can do it at the same time . . . \u201d\nHe tapped his nails on his chest bone, producing loud snapping sounds.\n\u201cIf only two people . . . \u201d Hiimar pushed. \u201cSay it at once so I can go to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cIf only two people can do it . . . well . . . look! Just imagine it. I\u2019m looking for a good example, Hiimar, but I can\u2019t find it! What do we do with two people only?\u201d\n\u201cIrritating someone,\u201d she said. \u201cExactly what you\u2019re doing right now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, please. This is interesting, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that it is interesting, but this is not our area, there are people who . . . \u201d\n\u201cI know! The scientists of civilization, of mind, of this and that. But just because it\u2019s not our field it doesn\u2019t mean we should avoid thinking about it, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\u201cI do, Ier . . . \u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t doubt me, don\u2019t make that face. After all, you remember the day when we discovered that those sounds in the labevita\u2019s recordings were words of a children-exclusive dialect, right? That didn\u2019t have any connection to oceanography.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Karier smiled. \u201cThat was a very beautiful day.\u201d\n\u201cIt was,\u201d she smiled too, and her eyes blinked bright. \u201cBut I\u2019m really-really tired, my little. And we have much more work to do tomorrow.\u201d\nKarier-lah looked at her for an instant. He seemed to be still thinking about the day of that linguistic discovery. Two oceanographers, who could tell . . . the linguists were nuts.\n\u201cAll right, Hiimar,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you not going to sleep?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll take a walk. I\u2019ll be back soon. But sleep, please.\u201d\n\u201cYes . . . \u201d she said, as Karier went out and the door came down again. She looked at the empty chair by her side. That was unusual.\nShe closed her eyes, foreseeing it would be hard to keep them like that for long.\nHiimar found Karier exactly where she expected him to be, some kuynas later, when she decided that she couldn\u2019t sleep.\nHe had a quirk of sitting on the floor between two shelves in the library. Though the environment was acclimatized, the floor was still very cold, and at that time everything was dark in the library. Some of the books created a dusty atmosphere, and the smell bothered almost everybody, but it never bothered Ier.\n\u201cIer . . . where are you?\u201d she asked, in a hushed tone, knowing he would hear it.\n\u201cHiimar?\u201d he asked, and his long head creeped out from behind a shelf in the language section.\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said, approaching him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing? You can\u2019t sleep?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t answer before sitting by his side, looking at the books at the level of their eyes. Original and translated volumes, a few not fully deciphered. It was an area they were very interested in when younger.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about many examples for your problem,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat problem?\u201d\n\u201cThe photograph one, the one from the humans. You asked me what kinds of things we do with only two people.\u201d\n\u201cYes. And I can\u2019t think of anything. All we do, whether work or fun, always takes a lot of people. That varrmoine psychologist said we are a race of needy people.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true, but not for us.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Karier looked at her.\n\u201cUs, Ier. We always did things together. We played together, when we were kids . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes, but only because the other kids didn\u2019t want to play with me. Only you did.\u201d\n\u201cRight. We studied together.\u201d\n\u201cFor the same reason. And, in college, the library was always full.\u201d\n\u201cWe work together.\u201d\n\u201cWe are the only oceanographers!\u201d\n\u201cWe are talking together, Ier. Right now. What we\u2019re doing right now takes two.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but . . . but it can be done with more people. Do you understand?\u201d\n\u201cAccording to your theory, that thing in the picture can as well.\u201d\n\u201cThey can, but they don\u2019t do it very often. It may be rare. Maybe the humans have something like the frikar herb, or the kutu juice. They\u2019d only do it when numb. But, for most people, in most situations, I picture it as something only two people do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the importance of that, my little?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Karier said, and he seemed honestly frustrated. \u201cSomething in that gesture impresses me a lot. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s weird, and the Stars know it is. Don\u2019t the humans know that their mouths must be as dirty as their feet? But because it\u2019s . . . I can\u2019t find the word. I don\u2019t believe we have a word for it. It\u2019s like something . . . inner, but not inner for one person. Inner of two people. Do you understand what I mean, Hiimar? Interior between two people?\u201d\n\u201cI bet the humans have a word for that.\u201d\nKarier-lah looked at the books in the language section. The shelf was huge. There were books on the language of almost every known race and species in the Manual of Civilizations. Of almost all of them, but not the humans\u2019. What they knew about humans could be summed up in a small chapter in volume twenty-seven, section four of the manual. With the probe they had collected this might change soon, but it still didn\u2019t seem enough to him.\n\u201cI wish I could know more,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMe too. You know what\u2019s funny, Ier? For humans, that gesture that causes us so much doubt must be something so simple.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think so?\u201d Ier asked. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s socially complicated?\u201d\n\u201cBy the happy expressions on their faces, it doesn\u2019t seem complicated at all. Did you see the female\u2019s face? Her skin seems to glow. I mean, figuratively. They are all a little glowy, literally speaking.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, it doesn\u2019t seem complicated. But it can be hard. Wasn\u2019t it hard for me to find a friend before I met you?\u201d\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a fair situation, Ier. You suffered prejudice. It was rare before, and now it\u2019s gone. We left those things behind. The new generations are getting better.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah. But some say the humans are not that noble.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have reasons to believe that. At least not yet.\u201d\nThey remained silent, thinking. They did it a lot, in those nights of talking until dawn that, as life went on, became more and more rare.\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s not,\u201d said Hiimar.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d\n\u201cThe gesture. I hope it\u2019s not complicated. The female looks so happy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I hope too.\u201d\nThey spent the night talking. Now that Karier seemed to be done with the topic, it was possible to talk about other things. They realized it had been a long time since they talked like that. The simple act of sitting down and talking about things until the night was over. When they started talking about why they weren\u2019t talking so much anymore, Hiimar presented the hypothesis that in space there was no night or day, so talking until dawn was not as fun. It wasn\u2019t the same without both suns rising from the mountains.\nEven without the suns, they talked until they fell asleep in an unusual position: sitting on the floor, the points of each one\u2019s forehead touching. The floor made them cold, so they touched shoulders.\nAnd, in that sleep, right before drifting into unconsciousness, Karier thought he was getting closer to understanding what was so amazing about that oddish gesture of humans.\nGabriel Cal\u00e1cia is a writer from Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.

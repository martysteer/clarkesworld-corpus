Even here, at the edge, dampness permeates\u2014the air green like a receding tide. The pavement is patchwork. Brick and stone shows through tears in the asphalt, wounds no one bothered to heal once the aliens moved in, once it was clear humans would never move back into the neighborhood and it became the Zone.\nWeeds grow in the gaps, flourishing in the damp. Ro places each boot carefully, avoiding the puddles reflecting sodium streetlights. On either side of the street, buildings stand with their doors shuttered against the gathering twilight. Some are ragged against the emerging stars, top layers blown away, evidence of the violence that emptied the neighborhood, made it unfit for human habitation, and eventually turned it into the Zone. But close to the ground, the world is still whole. If Ro doesn\u2019t look up, it\u2019s as though nothing has changed.\nExcept the Zone is haunted by waiting. The sense of impermanence is palpable\u2014like the refugee camps and shanty towns of the early century, the ones the government planned to empty after the last great flood, or hurricane, but never did. The Zone was meant to be a way station, a temporary solution until the Immies (the word tastes dirty even in Ro\u2019s mind, hateful, ugly, but there isn\u2019t a better one because the aliens have never given the humans their true name) could be fully integrated into life on Earth. And yet . . .\nRo shrugs against the weight of emptiness and broken promises. At least Xal\u2019s light is still on, welcoming. A bell over the door jangles; stepping inside, Ro can\u2019t help smiling at this incongruously human touch. It\u2019s like the shelves behind the glass counters, crammed floor to ceiling with human knick-knacks and oddities no Immie could possibly want, and no human would come here to buy. Charming, but sad in a way, too. Lonely.\nIt takes Ro a moment to pick out Xal\u2019s form against the crowded shelves. Today, Xal\u2019s flesh is the color of sand. It reminds Ro of the fish that disguise themselves from predators by lying flat against the ocean floor. There are variations, tiny glints of light. It is brown only in the way pigeons are simply gray, full of tones unseen until it is pointed out they were there all along.\n\u201cHi.\u201d Ro sets the courier bag on the counter\u2014this time full of gamboling ceramic kittens\u2014and places the delivery slip on top.\nXal doesn\u2019t respond, which isn\u2019t unusual for an Immie, only for Xal. Ro hesitates. Payment is stacked neatly on the counter, as always. Perhaps Xal simply doesn\u2019t want to talk. Ro turns, hiding disappointment.\n::Tone\u2014Plea/Imperative: Ro. Wait.::\nXal\u2019s voice is changeless, only the tone-statement betraying the edge of panic. There are no human or even human-like features to convey pain. But now that Ro looks closer, it is written in the restless knotting of limbs hanging beneath the bulk of Xal\u2019s body.\nRo steps forward. Xal shifts, flickering in and out. Barely visible one moment, then sharply outlined the next. Sinuous lines gleam damp, twisting through a host of colors Ro can\u2019t begin to name. Ro\u2019s breath catches. There, an extra wetness, almost hidden by the tangled lines, a gash leaking fluid, smelling of salt.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Fear: An accident.:: Ro hears hesitation in Xal\u2019s tone; in a human, it might sound like a lie. ::Tone\u2014Statement/Honesty: An attack. In the human district, not far over the line. Just looking.::\nColors roll; Xal fades in and out again.\n\u201cYou were attacked?\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Affirmative/Sorrow: Yes.::\n\u201cWhat can I do to help? Is there someone I can call?\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Alarm/Negative: No.::\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ro holds up his hands, palms out, hoping Xal will understand the human gesture and feeling helpless.\nXal\u2019s body clenches, shuddering, furling tight around the wound. A sound like keening, like an in-drawn breath, like music, traces Ro\u2019s jaw and spine. Then the sound stops and Xal unfolds, becoming more solid.\nThe wound already looks less, but still, a tremor ripples out from Ro\u2019s center. Disgust. Ro clenches teeth against the reaction, a reflexive hatred for the uselessness of all flesh. It isn\u2019t fair; Xal is wounded, Xal needs help, and this isn\u2019t the time. And yet the bone-achingly physical reaction remains, rooted in the very thing causing the revulsion. Flesh. Ro shudders, stepping closer to the counter as if to step away from skin, from muscle, leaving disgust behind.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Sincere: The pain is less. Ro. Thank you for staying.::\nA limb uncurls, a jerky, reflexive motion as though Xal is not entirely in control yet. It brushes Ro\u2019s hand, braced against the countertop. A new sound, a new quality of pain, laced with surprise. Xal draws back, but not before the touch sparks\u2014a snap like an electric shock and a taste like lemons.\nA scream locks in Ro\u2019s throat. A sensation of dislocation without motion. A space of falling or flying, existing between the moment of contact and Xal\u2019s touch withdrawn. Ro blinks away patches of violet light until the shop comes back into focus, bracing for a horror that never comes.\nThe lightness of Xal\u2019s touch, unlike anything human. Ro lets out a breath, coming back to center.\nXal\u2019s limbs are knotted in a new pattern now, anxious.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Fear: Ro. Apology. Pain was not intended.::\n\u201cNo. I . . . \u201d Ro\u2019s breath\u2014ragged\u2014calms, but not fast enough. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt. I don\u2019t . . . \u201d\nFlying. Falling. Ro struggles to process the sensation of Xal\u2019s limb, solid yet ephemeral. The memory of the touch remains, like a lost tooth wanting to be probed. It is a moment of slipping out from under the weight of skin and bones, of being somewhere else, yet wholly here.\nRo tries to draw back from the sensation, but there is nothing to withdraw from.\n::Tone\u2014Query/Fear: Not hurt.:: Xal\u2019s voice again. Ro\u2019s mind thrums to an absence, reaching again for revulsion where there is none.\n\u201cNo. I should just . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nRo turns, bell jangling. The green scent of the streets is an assault, the slickness underfoot designed to trip un-careful steps. Even the shorter buildings lean in, edges all jagged. They outline an empty space, something that cannot be defined.\nOn the edge of hyperventilation, Ro bursts out of the Zone. Leaving the bike behind, leaving everything. Not questioning the source of the fear, just running. Then stopping, leaning against a building, a stitch lacing between two ribs.\n\u201cRo?\u201d\nRo looks up, blinking, human buildings and a single figure resolving. Audra slows her bike, dropping one foot to the pavement. The courier satchel at Audra\u2019s hip is empty; Ro remembers the bag left with the delivery in Xal\u2019s shop, the bike chained to a post at the entrance of the Zone.\n\u201cAre you okay? You look like you\u2019re about to faint.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . \u201d Ro falters, tries again. \u201cSomething happened.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThere are no words. Only lemons and the snap of electricity. Ro rubs the spot Xal touched, chasing ghosts.\n\u201cCome on.\u201d Audra swings her leg over the courier bike, twin to the one Ro left behind. A tilt of her chin indicates the caf\u00e9 across the street, glowing warm in the twilight. \u201cWe\u2019re getting some tea into you. My treat.\u201d\nAudra keeps a space and silence between them. Ro is grateful. But Audra\u2019s gaze still slides in Ro\u2019s direction, questioning. Inside the caf\u00e9, Audra pushes a cup of tea across the table.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cI was making a delivery to Xal.\u201d Ro hesitates, seeing an expression of distaste Audra is not quick enough to hide. \u201cXal was attacked, outside the Zone.\u201d\nThe muscles between Ro\u2019s shoulder blades tense, waiting for Audra to ask what an Immie was doing outside the Zone. But the question doesn\u2019t come, and Ro swallows guilt at putting venom in Audra\u2019s mouth before continuing.\n\u201cXal was hurt and . . . accidentally touched me.\u201d\nAudra\u2019s eyes widen. Small fingers of panic tap at Ro\u2019s ribs from the inside. Xal\u2019s tone-statements make things so much simpler. With Audra, Ro is lost. Is she jealous? Angry?\nAt last year\u2019s office holiday party, Audra drunkenly tried to kiss Ro. They had only known each other a short time, and so it was Ro who mumbled apologies and made the effort to explain.\nIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m not . . . I don\u2019t really date. I don\u2019t like . . . And there, the explanation faltered. Because what could Ro say that Audra would understand? Audra was wholly comfortable in her skin, more so than anyone Ro had ever met. She dated men and women in equal numbers; affection\u2014casual and intimate\u2014came to her as naturally as breath. She drank the world in through her fingertips and remained thirsty for more.\nSo how could Ro explain a hatred of touch, of flesh? The discomfort of even having a body, let alone one identifying with a single, narrow gender and responding to others sexually?\nHow could Ro explain it then? How can Ro explain it now? How that night, Ro hadn\u2019t fled, but had remained horrified. How this night, Ro had fled, but wasn\u2019t disgusted.\nAudra shakes her head. Amazement? Ro still can\u2019t tell. Xal\u2019s touch was accidental; would emphasizing that help? Audra has been kind, understanding; Ro doesn\u2019t want to see Audra hurt, but the gulf between them is so vast.\nAudra wraps her hands around her mug. Steam rises between them. She does not look at Ro.\n\u201cSo what happened?\u201d\n\u201cIt tasted like lemons. And it was like being somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cXal tasted like lemons?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I mean. I don\u2019t know. Haven\u2019t you ever smelled something and had the taste hit you at the same time? I\u2019m explaining it badly.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Audra draws the word out. She looks at her hands, her expression guarded, like she wants to say more, but silence stretches between them.\nRo feels a pang of guilt, threaded with a flutter of panic, imagining Audra wants to put her hand over Ro\u2019s. A comforting gesture; it\u2019s what Audra would do if she was sitting with anyone else. Ro has seen it, the way Audra leans into their other co-workers\u2014a nudge from her hip to emphasize a joke, a sympathetic hand on an arm, a head, comfortably resting on a shoulder. Even when it isn\u2019t sexual, Audra is so casual with her body; Ro can\u2019t begin to understand it.\n\u201cI have to go back for my messenger bag,\u201d Ro says, abrupt, standing.\n\u201cBut . . . \u201d Hurt flickers in Audra\u2019s eyes, this time unmistakable.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ro says.\nIt feels like fleeing again. The phantom of Xal\u2019s touch lingers, but it doesn\u2019t have half the weight of Audra\u2019s gaze. Still, Ro rubs the spot again, pushing out the door. A light drizzle mists the air. Hairs rise on Ro\u2019s arm, catching the moisture. Ro rubs harder, half expecting to see translucence and hollow bones like glass\u2014flesh both there and not there in the aftermath of Xal\u2019s touch.\nInstead of going back to the Zone, Ro goes home, climbing three flights to a small apartment, boots heavy on each step. Guilt prickles, and with it, something else. Curiosity.\nRo crosses to the window, touching the glass. It\u2019s cool, and condensation forms a halo in the shape of a hand. Drawing away, there is a space left\u2014defined by the imprint of four fingers, a palm, a thumb. And in the place of flesh, droplets of water cling to the window, heavy with the light and shimmering like stars.\nNerves flutter in Ro\u2019s stomach. The memory of rain glistens on the bike, still chained at the Zone\u2019s entrance. Ro brushes fingertips over the metal frame in passing. Never has the walk to Xal\u2019s shop seemed longer. Never has the jigsaw of uneven pavement, brick, and stone seemed such an impediment.\nRo tries to think of anything written or said about physical contact between humans and Immies, but comes up empty. If it\u2019s done, it\u2019s a private thing. Does everyone taste lemons, feel the snap of electricity? The Immie community is so small. Maybe Ro is the first, the only one.\nBut who is there to ask? The other couriers don\u2019t travel into the Zone. Scarcely any humans do. Ro has never seen another human walking the shattered streets. Which makes the kitschy human ornaments crowding the walls in Xal\u2019s shop even sadder.\nRo pauses, wondering if Xal has ever made a sale, if the shipments Ro regularly delivers ever leave the shop again, or only sit there gathering dust.\nWhy, Ro wonders. Aliens came to their world. Shouldn\u2019t people be excited, curious? But they don\u2019t seem to be. It\u2019s not fear exactly, but more a way of not seeing, Ro supposes. Turning a blind eye to what is inconvenient, uncomfortable. Like the government pretending the Zone is only temporary. Like the refugee camps that never empty. Like racial tension, poverty, homophobia. If the problem is ignored long enough, perhaps it will simply go away.\nRo pauses before pushing open Xal\u2019s door; the bell jangles. The courier bag, now empty, waits on the counter. And Xal waits behind it, limbs no longer bunched in pain, but held inward careful, betraying tension. Ro\u2019s throat is dry; it takes a moment to get the words out.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\nThere\u2019s no sign of the wound. Ro can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s healed completely, or whether Xal is simply hiding it. Limbs fold and unfold, a rippling effect unsettling the first time Ro saw it. Now it\u2019s almost comforting.\nToday, Xal is gray-green, but with shades of violet. Ro thinks of sea anemones, rocks grown over with lichen, algae stirred by gentle waves.\n::Tone\u2014Relief/Query: Unhurt, now. Are you well.::\nRo nods.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for running out yesterday. It\u2019s just . . . \u201d Trying to explain things to Audra was awkward enough. They share common language, context.\n\u201cI forgot my bag.\u201d Ro points; it is a cowardly change of subject, but safer ground.\nRo touches the bag, but makes no move toward the door. Xal seems watchful, even without visible eyes. But what else? Hurt? Confused? Ro is suddenly aware of standing stiff, one arm crossed to hold the opposite elbow, lips parted as if to speak. Flesh again\u2014bodies speaking a language Ro can\u2019t understand. It\u2019s all so useless. So . . .\n\u201cI want you to touch me again.\u201d The words come in a rush too quick for regret. Heat suffuses cheeks, another betrayal, and Ro almost flees.\nBut the shop bell stays silent. Ro\u2019s boots remain planted on the floor.\n\u201cI mean if . . . it didn\u2019t hurt you? If . . . if it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nPulse beats under jawline, at wrists and elbows. Xal furls and unfurls, the there and not there-ness coming across as deliberation, physically rolling and weighing the request.\n::Tone\u2014Hesitation/Query: It does not hurt. Why do you want this.::\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the most honest answer Ro can give. A paradox blooms, a strange, fractal bruise centered at the site of Xal\u2019s last touch. It spreads outward, re-writing Ro\u2019s hardwired code. Ro wants this. No, Ro needs this.\n\u201cWhat was it like for you?\u201d Ro\u2019s eyes slide closed; it\u2019s easier to speak this way, even if it means having to ignore the extra weight of tears just starting to frost lashes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to impose, is what I mean. I don\u2019t normally like . . . But this was different. I tasted lemons.\u201d\nThe ache is physical\u2014a desire to step off the edge, precisely because it is unsafe, unknown. There are blank spaces defined by broken buildings, by the ghost of a handprint. They are defined by lack\u2014not by something missing precisely, simply by something not there. They are possibility, made manifest.\nIn that brief moment, Ro had the sense of Xal\u2019s touch being like the ideal of falling into the night sky, being weightless and rushing so fast between stars their light draws blood. That paradox bruising Ro\u2019s skin\u2014the contradiction of making the unknown known and erasing the infinite possibility\u2014is too attractive.\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain.\u201d Ro\u2019s throat aches around the inadequacy of words.\nA heartbeat. A space of silence. Eyes open. Ro consciously remembers to breathe. Xal is watchful, even without eyes. There is the same sense of consideration in the roiling movements, colors flickering, limbs furling and unfurling.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Uncertainty: It is curious. No other humans come here. To touch would be to know more.::\nRo lets out a rush of breath.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Anticipation/Fear: The store is closed.::\nAt first, Ro doesn\u2019t understand. Then Xal touches a switch and the lights dim, leaving only the faint glow of emergency lighting. Understanding crashes in: This is agreement, consent. Xal is giving them privacy.\n::Tone\u2014Anticipation/Fear: Ro. Put your arm on the counter.::\nRo hesitates only a moment, breathes out, then rests both arms, wrist up, on the glass. In the dimness, Xal is both easier and harder to see. Red light from the emergency exit sign traces contours and makes flesh the color of water over gray-green stone glow.\nRo tries not to flinch, pressing arms against the countertop to keep from shaking. Xal\u2019s . . . arm? Leg? Is there a human word for it? Extends slowly, waits the space of a heartbeat, then surrounds Ro\u2019s flesh, passing through and into it.\nThe shop tilts. A scent like violets and seaweed, like gunpowder, fills the air. There is no weight to Xal\u2019s touch, yet pressure builds in Ro\u2019s bones. A sense of fullness pushing outward, but without pain.\nXal flickers, slow, slow, fast, slow, unfolding, folding, turning. There and not there. Ro feels it too, absent and present, within the shop and elsewhere. An elsewhere that cannot be described.\nPart of Ro reaches for something to anchor to in the here and now\u2014long division, the names of past presidents, a list of capital cities. The larger part spins outward, spiraling from a weightless center, out through rings of stars, arms flung wide against the dark. Fragments of unknown worlds tumble past. Everything is vast and Ro is small and for a moment the sense of it is crushing.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Ro jerks back, the word slipping out.\n::Tone\u2014Query/Concern: Ro. Are you hurt.::\nXal\u2019s shop snaps back into focus. Ro crashes back into a body too small to hold the sense of stars, and their loss is just as terrible as their presence.\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . \u201d A ragged breath. Ro places a hand over the skin Xal touched; it is solid, real. Colors ripple across Xal, the salt-scent in the room intensifying.\n::Tone\u2014Shame/Sincerity: Apologies. I did not mean to cause pain.::\n\u201cNo. You didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have . . . \u201d\nUnder the salt-scent, the smell of violets and gunpowder. Ro\u2019s flesh prickles, as though swept by a cool breeze; the hairs rise. A sense of pressure, reaching, but never quite arriving, haunts the space between Ro\u2019s bones. It isn\u2019t desire\u2014that\u2019s too simple a word, too human. But there is wanting, need unfulfilled.\n\u201cI want to try again. Please.\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Confusion: You were hurt.::\n\u201cNo. It didn\u2019t hurt. I was just scared. But I want to try again.\u201d Ro\u2019s pulse thumps, arms trembling as they are pressed against the counter once more. \u201cPlease?\u201d\nColor and movement speaks doubt as it rolls across Xal\u2019s flesh\u2014storm clouds, and the scent of oncoming rain. Dust\u2014Ro can almost taste it. The same doubt fills Ro, but it can\u2019t end here. Ro reaches after something to keep the moment from slipping away, and lands on Xal\u2019s curiosity.\n\u201cWhat did you feel?\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Uncertainty: Sunlight. A plank of wood. Many planks of wood. Water. Sunlight on water. The sensation of limbs in water. Smoke and charcoal.::\nHesitation between Xal\u2019s words, searching for concepts to capture such simple, human things. The memory comes rushing back to Ro, sitting on a dock at the lake, toes trailing in the water, a grown up grilling hot dogs in the background and the air filling with shrieks as other children dove and splashed in the water. A slice of childhood, pulled through Ro\u2019s skin and transferred into Xal\u2019s mind through touch.\n\u201cYou saw my memories?\u201d\nMore hesitation, then, ::Tone\u2014Agreement/Affirmative: Yes.::\nThe information makes Ro\u2019s head swim. Could it work both ways? An alien childhood, if there is even such a thing, slipping into Ro\u2019s skin. There\u2019s so much Ro doesn\u2019t know about Xal, about the Immies in general. The need to know is overwhelming.\nRo looks to where Xal\u2019s eyes would be on a human, trying to communicate need. The absence of Xal\u2019s touch is a pressure as great as the touch itself. It\u2019s only a matter of quality, of flavor\u2014not better, or worse, just different.\nXal reaches out again. A sigh, a musical tone so unlike the sound of pain from the night before traces the length of Ro\u2019s spine, the curve of Ro\u2019s jaw. Touch.\nA needle, a thread draws through Ro\u2019s skin, stitching it with the light of the universe. The taste of bitter greens, the feel of velvet, the scent of wood smoke. Ro\u2019s mind substituting human concepts for unimaginable things. Nebulae bloom against Ro\u2019s closed eyes.\n\u201cOh.\u201d The word escapes in a breath. Language and thought failing. Space simultaneously narrows to the point of contact between them, and expands beyond calculation.\n\u201cOh.\u201d There are no other words. \u201cOh.\u201d\nAgain and again as the world spins away from them and Ro flies and falls.\n\u201cHey.\u201d\nRo turns toward Audra\u2019s voice, still holding the coffee pot. The scent of it, just on the edge of burnt, fills the small courier office above the shed where their bikes are racked.\n\u201cCareful. You\u2019re going to spill.\u201d Audra points, and Ro starts, realizing the coffee is perilously close to the edge of the mug.\nEven before the first sip, Ro is shaky, nerves taut and singing.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Ro replaces the coffee pot, sips scalding heat.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Audra frowns. \u201cYou look exhausted.\u201d\nRo doesn\u2019t remember returning to the apartment last night, only waking in a tangle of sheets this morning, eyelids sticky, limbs heavy. The world keeps wanting to slide away; the edges of Ro\u2019s vision glimmer with light, like a migraine coming on, only without pain.\n\u201cAny new jobs come in since yesterday?\u201d Ro asks instead of answering Audra\u2019s question.\nEven seen peripherally, Audra\u2019s concern is clear. There are no mirrors in Ro\u2019s apartment, but Ro imagines the shadow-bruises of sleeplessness, improperly combed hair.\n\u201cA few.\u201d Audra hands over the clipboard before pouring her own mug of coffee. Her knuckles are white, gripping the handle. It is a gesture of restraint; Ro has seen it before. If Audra doesn\u2019t anchor herself to her mug, she will reach out a comforting hand to touch Ro\u2019s arm.\nEvasion tastes as sour as a lie. Audra only wants to help, but what can Ro say? Audra might understand, but she might as easily be hurt. She might think Ro is sick, wrong for wanting this inexplicable thing, and that would be unbearable. It\u2019s not that kind of desire, but it\u2019s too hard to explain. There are no words for what it is, at least none that Ro knows.\n\u201cMind if I take the Thayer Street drop?\u201d Ro\u2019s voice cracks.\nThe sound is covered with more sips of coffee\u2014too quick. The heat doesn\u2019t help the flush coming to Ro\u2019s cheeks. The truth must be written everywhere on Ro\u2019s skin, the evidence of Xal wrapped around and through, highlighting the translucence of bones, hollowed like glass.\nRo is clattering down the stairs to the bike shed almost before realizing it.\n\u201cRo!\u201d Audra follows, and Ro isn\u2019t quick enough\u2014fingers shaking and clumsy\u2014to strap the package to the back of the bike and leave before Audra blocks the door.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nRo doesn\u2019t answer. Can\u2019t. Tears sting, hot and bright, but don\u2019t fall.\n\u201cRo.\u201d Audra\u2019s voice is soft. She weaves between the bikes, comes within a few inches of Ro, and reaches out. But at the sharp intake of breath, she stops, her fingers falling short of brushing Ro\u2019s wrist.\n\u201cSorry. I forgot.\u201d Audra looks down, then back again. The hope in her eyes is crushing.\nRo shifts, putting the bike between them, and feels guilty doing so.\n\u201cI went back to see Xal.\u201d Ro swallows, gripping the bike.\nAudra\u2019s eyes widen, drawing light from the gaps where the door of the shed doesn\u2019t quite fit. All the darkness in them reminds Ro of falling through the stars. There is a sound that isn\u2019t quite a sob, and it takes Ro a moment to realize its source.\n\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\nRo gives a shake of the head, slight, but easier than words.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nRo\u2019s lips press tight, fighting the sense of being overwhelmed without understanding its source. The loneliness of being trapped in a single body with its weight of flesh\u2014Ro has always known it, but until feeling the alternative offered by Xal, it was bearable. Now the world is open, a wound no amount of thread can stitch closed.\nAudra\u2019s fingers circle Ro\u2019s wrist, insistent this time. Ro\u2019s mouth flies open, but Audra\u2019s grip tightens.\n\u201cPlease. I want to understand.\u201d\nThe need to touch is written clearly in Audra\u2019s eyes, as clear as Ro\u2019s desire to pull away. Ro lets out a shuddering breath, doesn\u2019t move. Pulse beats between them, in Audra\u2019s fingertips, in Ro\u2019s wrist. Maybe this is a language Audra can read; maybe Ro doesn\u2019t need to say anything at all.\nAudra exhales, letting go, and Ro\u2019s pulse falls back into a regular rhythm. How can Xal\u2019s touch soothe, being so alien, while Audra\u2019s induces only panic? Most of the world would consider it wrong, broken. But Ro knows it isn\u2019t. There is no weight to Xal\u2019s touch, no expectation.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ro says, and at the same time, Audra says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nBreath and silence fills the shed. They look at each other across the bike between them. The light coming through the gap around the door shifts, leaving Audra\u2019s face in shadow, stealing the illusion of stars from her eyes, but catching sylph-like in her dark curls.\nRo\u2019s chest tightens. There are no words that won\u2019t make things worse. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me, will only give Audra the impression Ro thinks the opposite.\nIf human touch could communicate the way Xal\u2019s does, Ro would understand. And maybe, for Audra, it does. Maybe Audra experiences the world through the tips of her fingers, gives away pieces of herself with each touch, but gains just as much in return, never diminishing.\nBut Ro cannot say this, cannot ask without fear of giving Audra hope. It\u2019s not that Audra has ever pressured Ro, or implied that maybe if Ro just tried it, met the right person, then things would be different. It\u2019s that sometimes, Ro catches Audra looking and thinks there is a glimmer, faint, but wistful\u2014wishing things were different between them\u2014and it makes Ro\u2019s heart ache.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Audra says, taking a step back, putting more space between them. She crosses her arms, holding herself in, holding back.\nAudra isn\u2019t pulling back, running away, and relief surges through Ro. Whatever else they may be, at the core, they are still friends. The realization that Audra won\u2019t leave, won\u2019t shun, no matter what, brings a surge of emotion. It\u2019s almost like love, vast and complicated, but even the thought of the word comes thick with ghosts\u2014meanings and expectations layered upon it by all the lips that have spoken it before. Ro pushes it away and, halting, tries to explain. Audra listens, never interrupting.\n\u201cDo you think there\u2019s something wrong with me?\u201d Ro asks, needing to hear the words aloud, needing to taste them in order to let them go.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Audra\u2019s tone is firm, but she looks lost as well. Scared. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to get hurt, okay? Promise me you\u2019ll be careful?\u201d\nAudra hugs herself tighter. Ro nods, pressing lips together, tasting salt even without tears. The promise means nothing; they both understand. This is unknown territory, and there is no way to travel it without gathering bone-deep scars.\nSirens shatter Ro\u2019s sleep. Pulse jack-rabbiting, pushing away sweat-tangled sheets and the remnants of a dream, Ro stumbles to the window. The sound is tied to the dream\u2014one of being very far away, but very close, stretched thin, no blood or bone, no muscle, only skin and nerves pulled taut like a sheet over the world.\nOn the street below, red and blue lights spin in time with Ro\u2019s pulse. A sudden spike of pain. Ro clasps the wound, but there\u2019s nothing there.\nXal.\nPain arcs again, bringing flashes of violence, memories not Ro\u2019s own.\nXal.\nJacket and pants pulled over rumpled pajamas. Feet shoved into unlaced boots. Clattering down three flights of stairs. Ro\u2019s courier bike leans outside the apartment\u2019s outer door. Grabbing it, Ro is gone. Falling. Flying. Pedaling madly into the night, toward the flashing lights.\nThe whole city is wet, smearing in Ro\u2019s peripheral vision. Two cop cars park askew across the main entrance to the Zone. Ro stops the bike, lets it fall. A knot of people huddle, pointing. The cops struggle with a man whose hands are secured with a plastic zip tie. He thrashes, resisting as they push him toward the nearest car.\n\u201cFucking Immie got what it deserved, slurping and lurking around our streets. They need to fucking stay where they\u2019re told or go the fuck home.\u201d\nLight skips off shards of broken glass, blood red and deep blue. The man throws his head back; the cop\u2019s nose makes a sickening crunch as bone connects with bone. Swearing, the cop lets go, but her partner is quick, sweeping the man\u2019s legs and dropping him. The second cop gets a knee in the man\u2019s back, holding him down against the tongue of uneven pavement extending from the mouth of the Zone. The man continues swearing, lips spit-flecked.\n\u201cFucking Immie. I hope it\u2019s dead.\u201d\nRo breaks into a run, ignoring a muffled shout from the cop with the broken nose. The door to Xal\u2019s shop hangs open. Ro nearly slips in slickness trailing across the floor. Xal never made it to the safety behind the counter, and instead lies knotted in front of it, limbs drawn together in the universal language of pain.\nThere is no hesitation. Ro kneels, folding around and over Xal. Shockwaves of pain radiate outward, but Ro doesn\u2019t let go. Stars spin, razor bright. The smell of matches, freshly-struck; a taste like a battery held on the tongue; the persistent thrum of rain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\nRo repeats the words, trying to stay conscious, trying to soothe. Xal\u2019s pain is overwhelming, an assault of sensation. Lighthouse flash. The taste of apples. Green-wet stone. Stairs spiraling down.\nDesperate, Ro tries to pour sensation back into Xal\u2014more childhood memories\u2014introduce a new thread into the loop of feedback flowing between them. But the images keep coming, pounding Ro like fists, like stones. It\u2019s impossible to concentrate. The rasp of wool, black crayons melting in the sun, the taste of cherries. The touch-taste-smell correlation stutters. Xal\u2019s control slips, no longer translating sensations into human terms.\nRo screams. A note, sheer sound, shearing bone from bone, sloughing flesh. Ro\u2019s mind reels, trying to process what there are no words for.\nA body\u2014Ro\u2019s, Xal\u2019s, both, shudders. Collapses inward. Spins outward. The rush of wind, hot and dry and wet all at once. The crushing cold between stars. Stretching impossibly thin-fast-long across a cord of silver and all of it is everything all at once. Then, nothing.\nScraps torn from a quilt, broken fragments of a mirror, numb fingers trying to piece them back together and failing. Surfacing. Ro approaches a reflection etched on the underside of waves, surrounded by a distorted view of sky and trees and sunlight on the other side. Lips almost touch lips\u2014reality kissing reflection\u2014then Ro sinks again. A stream of bubbles, like pearls, like laughter, trail behind.\nHands. A voice. Audra\u2019s?\nWheels hum fast through sterile corridors; too-bright lights overhead. Sharp-jabbed needles. Medicine smell. The steady pulse of machines. Then nothing again.\nRo comes back from very far away. The simple task of cracking open an eyelid is monumental. Dry lips part.\n\u201cWater?\u201d\nA straw touches swollen and bruised lips. Ro sucks greedily until the straw is withdrawn.\n\u201cNot too much too fast. The doctors said.\u201d\nRo turns, head even heavier than eyelids. Audra perches in a chair next to the bed, holding the water glass awkwardly in her lap. She looks as though she\u2019s about to cry, or has just stopped.\n\u201cI should call the nurse.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d Ro tries to remember\u2014in the haze of moments between then and now, was Audra\u2019s name spoken in answer to the nurses asking if there was someone they should call?\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ro tastes blood from cracked lips.\nAudra holds the water out again, automatic.\n\u201cThe police found you and Xal curled together on the floor. It looked like you\u2019d been beaten to a bloody pulp. They thought you were dead.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\u201cWere you attacked?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Xal was hurt. I . . . \u201d\nThere is no word for it, but Ro feels one trying to take shape on a tongue not meant for such sounds.\n\u201cYou have to stop this. Promise me you\u2019ll stay away from Xal.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d It isn\u2019t what Ro means to say, not meaning to say anything at all.\nFor a moment, Ro is afraid Audra will storm out, but she only crosses her arms tight around her body.\n\u201cRo, what are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ro\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d\nRo lies back on the pillow, closing eyes before they snap open again.\n\u201cIs Xal okay?\u201d It hurts, but Ro turns toward Audra.\n\u201cXal is fine, as far as I know.\u201d Audra stiffens, her tone brittle and sharp.\nHurt shines in her eyes. Her mouth opens, but she closes it again, standing.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get a nurse.\u201d\nAudra\u2019s shoes click and silence falls in their wake. Weary and bruised in ways that have nothing to do with skin, Ro curls into a ball, trying to recreate a knot of limbs so woven over and under and through each other they become one.\nRo toys with the hospital bracelet. It\u2019s been three days, and Ro\u2019s wounds have vanished as though they never existed. Still, Audra insisted on riding in the cab back to the apartment, and now perches on the arm of Ro\u2019s battered couch, watchful.\n\u201cWhat exactly did Lena say?\u201d Ro paces to the window.\n\u201cShe just suggested you might want to take some time off, for your health.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she couldn\u2019t be bothered to tell me in person?\u201d\nRo glances back as Audra shrugs, looking uncomfortable.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s just worried. We all are.\u201d\nThe slope of Audra\u2019s shoulders and the way she studies her feet keeps Ro silent. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger.\n\u201cI\u2019m not fired?\u201d\nAudra shrugs again. Of course word has spread. Ro declined the opportunity to talk to reporters doing follow-up stories on the attack, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The stories are still out there, painting Ro as a misguided loner, the victim of an alien attack, a pervert. Maybe Lena is right to be wary, the other couriers right to withdraw. All except Audra.\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Ro says.\nAudra looks up, alarmed. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCome with me to see Xal.\u201d\nIf others understood what Ro experienced, maybe they wouldn\u2019t be afraid. Maybe things can change. And where better to start with than Audra, living through touch\u2014hand brushed to arm, palm squeezed to palm? Maybe this is something Ro can give Audra, like a gift. Something to bring them closer together in a way that balances both of their needs. And Xal, lonely, hungry for human experience. Ro\u2019s pulse speeds with the thought.\n\u201cPlease? Trust me?\u201d\nRo knows it isn\u2019t fair. Audra has offered so much, unasked\u2014what right does Ro have to ask this in return? Because there\u2019s no way to explain to Audra without showing her what it is Ro is trying to do.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Audra stands.\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Audra\u2019s smile holds an edge of sadness. \u201cWhy wait?\u201d\nThe streets are silent, dusk just starting to fall. They walk with hands in pockets, watching their feet, watching the streetlights increasingly reflected as they draw closer to the Zone. Ro hears the hitch in Audra\u2019s breath as they cross the line.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Ro glances back, trying for a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s an imaginary border.\u201d\nAudra nods, looking sheepish. Ro tries not to hold too tight to the fragile ball of hope, lest it shatter.\nThe shop bell jangles; behind the counter, Xal unfolds\u2014a gesture Ro interprets as turning to face them.\n::Tone\u2014Alarm/Joy: Ro. You are not hurt.::\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d\nXal knots and unknots, an anxious gesture.\n\u201cThis is Audra, my . . . friend. Is it okay that she\u2019s here?\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Formal/Greeting: Audra. Welcome.::\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\u201cI brought her here . . . \u201d Ro falters under the combined weight of Audra and Xal\u2019s attention. \u201cAudra is worried about me. I want her to understand. I thought . . . \u201d Ro tries not to blush, tries not to panic.\nAudra comes to the rescue, stepping forward while keeping careful space between her body and Ro\u2019s. Her voice carries a hint of nerves, but not outright fear.\n\u201cWhat happened the night you were attacked?\u201d\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Query: It is not fair to be restricted. Why cross the stars to see only one small corner of a different world.::\nRo\u2019s breath catches.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Anger: Your government promises change. We will be free to go where we please. Nothing changes.::\nXal grows, unfolding new dimensions. Ro\u2019s heart trips on the truth of the words, cracking. Again, it is a sensation too big to express, to hold. Human words are all too fraught. Ro needs an anatomy like Xal\u2019s, one to unfold and express everything mere flesh cannot contain.\nAudra glances at Ro, eyes shining but cheeks dry. Ro holds her gaze, then nods, heart cracking again. There is understanding in Audra\u2019s eyes, not fear. The way Audra and Xal both watch Ro is like being re-written\u2014blood and bones, skin and heart. Ro is most surprised by Audra. Humans, it seems can unfold to reveal new dimensions, too.\nAudra pushes her sleeves up and rests her arms on the counter.\n\u201cI want to understand.\u201d\nXal flickers, shifting attention to Ro, asking an unspoken question.\nRo\u2019s voice shakes slightly, addressing them both. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s safe. No one will get hurt.\u201d\nXal unfurls, encompassing Audra\u2019s arms. Ro releases a breath at the same time Audra sucks one in, sharp, but containing more surprise than pain. It is the sound of plunging into a cold lake on a hot day\u2014pleasure and shock rolled into one.\nAudra blushes, the non-colors of Xal rippling across every bit of exposed flesh. The back of her neck is a sunset in deep sea shades; her arms are the color of starlight on a pond. She is there and not there. The scent of cherries and running water leak into the air.\n\u201cCan I . . . ?\u201d Ro doesn\u2019t finish the sentence.\nPerhaps Ro closes the space, or perhaps Xal and Audra entwined unfold to welcome Ro\u2014a circle, a thread, a knot without beginning or end.\nSparks jump the gap between Ro\u2019s bones, suffusing flesh with light, like an x-ray, only brighter, more beautiful. Ro feels Audra\u2019s body, Xal\u2019s, all three occupying the same space and time. A moment of suffocation, a moment of panic, then everything opens with a smell like just-damp laundry snapping in the breeze. The shop warps, new segments forming like fractals of water freezing into ice.\nA pulse beats, not Ro\u2019s own. A sensation belonging to\u2014it must be Audra, because the memory\u2014sharp and present\u2014is so human. A bicycle, fiercely pedaled with bare feet to the crest of a hill before hands and feet are removed. It\u2019s like flying\u2014the glorious, stomach-dropping feeling of the world falling away, the rush of wind, the warmth of light and being suspended beautifully between earth and sky. Ro feels it, filtered through Audra\u2019s flesh; from within, her body doesn\u2019t feel an impossible weight against her bones. Ro understands, viscerally, how Audra revels in being blood, muscle, bone.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Ro wants to dig fingertips into Audra\u2019s flesh, into Xal\u2019s, and hold onto this moment forever. But too soon, the connection is broken.\n\u201cWow.\u201d Audra is the first to step back. \u201cThat was . . . intense.\u201d\nHer pupils are dilated, her breath fast. Ro steps back as well, chill with a fresh awareness of the space between them. Something in Ro aches to close the gap, but the familiar horror is there as well: it wouldn\u2019t be the same, couldn\u2019t ever be the same, inside this skin.\n\u201cYou\u2019re glowing.\u201d Audra smiles.\nBits of light dance at the edges of Ro\u2019s vision.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Audra takes a half step, but stops.\nRo\u2019s throat is closed\u2014thick. Eyes squeeze shut, a deep breath, then Ro looks at Audra again just in time to catch the tail-end of disappointment, the smile fading. The back of Audra\u2019s neck blushes, just blood colors now, the deep sea faded as she turns to Xal.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d The faint quiver in her voice might be the after-shock of touch, or something else.\n::Tone\u2014Formal/Pleased: You are welcome. Audra. Thank you for sharing memories and experience of your world.::\nThe ache lessens in Ro\u2019s throat, fading to a sensation more like a bruise than a fresh wound.\n\u201cThe night you were attacked, the first night, it wasn\u2019t the first time you left the Zone, was it?\u201d Audra\u2019s question surprises Ro.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Truthful: No.::\n\u201cHow many times?\u201d\nRo grips the counter, watching Audra and Xal. How is it they understand each other so well, so quickly? Or is it only that Ro\u2019s own curiosity blocked out certain aspects of Xal. Or perhaps because Audra is more used to processing sensation, she was less overwhelmed. Now that Ro thinks about it, it\u2019s obvious. How could Xal have been happy\u2014how could any Immie be happy\u2014confined to the Zone? All the times Ro traveled to Xal\u2019s shop, never once thinking Xal might want to leave, experience the wider world. Ro\u2019s skin flushes hot, but neither Xal nor Audra is paying attention.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Truthful: The attack happened the fifth time.::\n\u201cWhere were you going?\u201d Audra leans forward; Ro leans, too, gravity pulling them both toward Xal\u2019s center.\nConcentric rings spread across Xal\u2019s flesh, as though from a dropped stone. Now Xal is the color of moss, of sunlight, filtered through pine trees.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Confidential: Some are patient, but not all. There is a group who would see the Zone change, the border gone.::\n\u201cWho?\u201d Both Xal and Audra turn as though they\u2019d forgotten Ro.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Anger: It is a small group. One is in your city government, working to change things from within. But it is too slow. Others would wait. Not all are so patient.::\nNot all, Ro thinks. Like Xal, restless, hungry for change.\n\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been leaving the Zone alone? Trying to start fights?\u201d Again, Ro is surprised at Audra\u2019s words, her insight. How willfully blind has Ro been? How much time has been wasted that could have been spent helping?\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Defensive: Violence is noticed. It is the quickest way to change.::\n\u201cWe want to help,\u201d Ro speaks before Audra can, but glances to the side to see Audra\u2019s lips pressed into a thin line. Breath held, waiting for Audra to object, but she does not.\nXal rotates without moving, encompassing both Audra and Ro with eye-less attention.\n::Tone\u2014Formal/Request: Will you leave the Zone with me. To meet with my friend in the government.::\n\u201cIs that wise?\u201d Audra glances at Ro.\n\u201cI think we should do it.\u201d\nAudra hesitates, frowning, then shrugs, moving toward the door. Ro hurries to catch up. The air sings between them\u2014Ro, a string pulled taut, thrumming a note of excitement, Audra simply tight, her note as yet un-played.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Ro\u2019s voice is low so Xal, following behind, won\u2019t hear.\nAudra shakes her head, but doesn\u2019t answer. She keeps her hands in her pockets, gaze fixed on the wet stones.\n\u201cHey!\u201d The shout draws Ro up short, bringing the realization they\u2019ve crossed out of the Zone.\nXal crowds behind them, all three looking toward a knot of men and women emerging from the bar across the street.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be here.\u201d One of the men points at Xal.\nTo Ro\u2019s surprise, Xal slides past them, gathering limbs together the way a human would draw themselves up to stand tall.\n::Tone\u2014Fear/Pride: It does not break any laws.::\nOf course not; the rules are all unwritten, enforced by silent consent, by looking the other way. Ro\u2019s fingers clench\u2014a body caught between fight and flight, heart pounding.\n\u201cFucking Immie! Get back in the Zone.\u201d Another man joins the first, the rest of the group bunching closer.\n\u201cWe should go back,\u201d Audra says.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Ro turns deliberately, walking away from the group, further away from the Zone.\nXal and Audra follow, the weight of hostile gazes tracking them. Fear and hope mix in equal parts. Xal is right\u2014if they spark enough conflicts, people can\u2019t continue to look the other way. A bottle explodes, glass spraying at their feet.\n\u201cKeep walking,\u201d Ro murmurs, picking up the pace.\nA second bottle flies, higher this time, bouncing off Ro\u2019s shoulder before hitting the ground.\n\u201cI\u2019m calling the cops.\u201d Audra pulls out her phone.\nPounding footsteps, then one of the men grabs Ro\u2019s shoulder. Instinct brings Ro\u2019s hands up to break the contact with a shove. The man reels on slick, neon-stained pavement and loses his balance, landing hard. One of the women in the group laughs, nervous, unsteady.\nAnother projectile glances off Ro\u2019s cheek, stinging. Ro touches the spot and fingers come away wet with blood. Audra whispers into her phone, voice low and urgent. Xal moves again, a solid mass between Ro and Audra and the group of men and women. The man Ro accidentally knocked down gets to his feet, his face red.\nFor a moment, no one moves. The red-faced man\u2019s fingers curl, his jaw clenched. Ro sees the moment of decision, but isn\u2019t fast enough to shout a warning.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Xal is there, then not. The man\u2019s blow never lands and he stumbles, but keeps his feet this time. One of the women casts about for something to use as a weapon.\n\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d Audra says.\nXal holds a line between the two groups of humans. More people emerge from the bar, some merely curious, others spoiling for a fight.\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to have a full-blown mob on our hands.\u201d Audra plucks at Ro\u2019s sleeve, not touching flesh.\nThis time, Ro doesn\u2019t see the moment of decision, or even where the punch comes from. Fist connects with jaw, and Ro hits the ground. Shouts, feet scuffling. Someone yells. Ro looks up in time to see Xal lift one of the men, tossing him away. Xal\u2019s colors and movements speak anger and distress.\nA siren cuts through the night, freezing everyone in place. As the cop cars stop, bodies scatter. Ro stands. Audra and Xal move closer, the three of them alone making no attempt to flee as the cops climb from their cars.\n\u201cIt might be a while, are you sure you wouldn\u2019t . . . \u201d The officer assigned to babysit them glances nervously between Audra and Ro, trying to pretend he doesn\u2019t see Xal at all.\nThey\u2019re in an empty interrogation room, out of the way. They\u2019ve given their statements, declined to press charges, and been assured no charges are being leveled against them, though the cop delivering the news didn\u2019t look happy about it. He\u2019d looked even less happy when Ro requested sanctuary, using the police station as a safe space to meet with Xal\u2019s friend. Ro credits Audra with charming him into reluctantly agreeing.\n\u201cNo. We\u2019re fine right here.\u201d Audra smiles sweetly, seeming to enjoy the way Xal\u2019s presence makes the cops uncomfortable, now that the immediate danger has passed.\nThe officer withdraws, and Audra pours two cups of coffee from the carafe he leaves behind. In the corner, Xal ripples in silence. Ro\u2019s cheek is sore, but the blood has dried and there will be no lasting damage.\nBut the bruise goes deeper than Ro\u2019s skin. Something has changed, but not changed enough. There has to be more; Ro feels it, the seed of an idea starting to grow. Talking to Xal\u2019s friend is a first step, but they have to push harder if they want real change.\n\u201cI want to go to the Immie homeworld,\u201d Ro says, voicing the growing notion in a remarkably even tone. Xal and Audra register surprise\u2014human and inhuman.\n\u201cThere should be ambassadors on both sides working toward change. You\u2019re right, Xal, violence gets attention, but we can do better than that.\u201d\nAs the words stop, Ro\u2019s cheeks burn. Said aloud, it sounds ridiculous.\n::Tone\u2014Statement/Uncertain: It might be arranged. Humans have never been, but it is not impossible.::\nXal unfolds from the corner, moving closer to the table in the center of the room. Audra puts her hand on the table, near but not touching Ro.\n\u201cRo?\u201d\nRo turns.\n\u201cIf Xal can arrange it, if it\u2019s possible, I have to go. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nAudra\u2019s hand moves, not withdrawing, fingers curling in on themselves, a knot of confusion and pain.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ro says again. And again, words are inadequate. For just a moment, Ro considers bridging the gap, touching the back of Audra\u2019s hand, but it wouldn\u2019t be the same. They shared a moment with Xal, but there\u2019s still too much space between them. Necessary space, space Ro cannot bridge.\n\u201cI thought . . . \u201d Audra looks down, studying the table\u2019s faux-wood grain. \u201cMaybe because of what happened . . . \u201d\nThe lines of her body pull inward. It hurts Ro to look at her, but their truths are too different. Audra must know that.\n\u201cI can\u2019t change who I am.\u201d Ro doesn\u2019t look away from Audra, hoping she\u2019ll understand.\nOne of Audra\u2019s shoulders lifts and falls again. It might be agreement, dismissal, or shrugging off an absent touch.\n\u201cIf I go, what will you do?\u201d Ro asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Audra traces circles on the fake wood; Ro can almost feel it through the tips of Audra\u2019s fingers. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens with Xal\u2019s friend. Maybe I\u2019ll join the cause. Maybe I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll keep working, and life will go on.\u201d\nAudra looks up, and her expression does something complicated. Her eyes are bright, but the light in them reminds Ro of reflections glinting off broken glass.\n\u201cMy life doesn\u2019t begin and end with you, you know.\u201d The edge of a smile touches Audra\u2019s mouth. \u201cI do have other friends. Family.\u201d\nThe smile becomes a grin. \u201cI like you, Ro. We\u2019re friends. I\u2019ll miss you, but you\u2019re not breaking my heart.\u201d\nRo\u2019s pulse trips. Audra sounds sincere, Ro believes her, but at the same time Ro doesn\u2019t have enough experience to differentiate the temporary sting of rejection from something deeper. Maybe if Ro leaves and comes back, things will be better. Maybe they can learn a mode of friendship\u2014better, deeper\u2014one that doesn\u2019t cause either of them pain.\nAudra\u2019s fingers uncurl. She presses her palm flat against the wood.\n\u201cAre you . . . \u201d Ro hesitates, uncertain how to end the sentence: Are you sure? or Are you okay?\nXal shifts closer, body forming a complicated pattern. The colors chasing across Xal\u2019s skin are sunlight, leaves, and the sensation of flying, not falling. Xal unfurls a limb, brushing the back of Audra\u2019s hand with the briefest of touches. The air smells of tangerines and Audra\u2019s eyes widen, as if Xal whispered something just for her.\nAudra draws her hand away from the table, pressing it to her heart. Ro feels it, the steady thump of blood and life and warmth inside Audra\u2019s skin. On the table, the ghost outline of Audra\u2019s hand remains. Footsteps approach the door, but Ro\u2019s attention remains fixed on the table. The fading shape, the memory of touch, outlines possibility. It is everything.\nA.C.

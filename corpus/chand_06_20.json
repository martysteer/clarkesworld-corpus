Slits in the tiled roof flooded the low tables with light, so the diners did not crowd each other, and, in doing so, commit violence.\nAnju tried to pretend she could not see Sonia glancing at her plate. Each slip of the eyes was another sin: the desire for more when they were given enough. Best to ignore it and hope Sonia would do penance later.\n\u201cAnju,\u201d the Jade whispered through the implant in her skull, \u201cyour glucose levels are low. Eat your food.\u201d\nAnju shivered at the extra roti on her plate. Bread was produced without violence, from grains shaken loose by the wind. The Jade\u2019s network tracked every grain, as it tracked all things, to help and nourish its people. On the outside, receivers; inside, implants. With that information, the Jade had determined Anju\u2019s body needed more grains today. She could, without hurting her next incarnation, savor those thin crispy edges for another moment.\nAnju slid the roti onto Sonia\u2019s plate.\nSonia smiled at Anju and tore into it.\nAnju smiled back.\nWhen the meal ended, their plates melted back into the tables. Here, no stray crumb was wasted.\nOutside, the terrace split into pathways shaded by concentric rings of tamarind trees. Before Anju could take five steps toward her workplace, the Jade spoke inside her head. \u201cYour cortisol is elevated. Go home and relax.\u201d\nAnju pressed her palms together, bowed in thanks, and wormed through the crowd. A couple she knew waved her over. Anju pretended not to see. Thanks to good karma from a previous life, she resided in one of the closer dorms.\nTen minutes later, she was in the room the Jade had given her to occupy. Not her room. Possession was a thing of the past, along with the scars that riddled the landscape, the mass graves that turned up on many regular surveys.\nBut time was cyclic. The past was future and would, someday, be present again. Was it for Anju to fight the nature of reality?\nThe pills were still on the dresser. Two bleached ovals, inviting Anju to accept the end of this golden age. Despite the ever-watchful Jade, despite hours upon hours of meditation, no one in Anju\u2019s generation had achieved the omniscience of a Jina: a prophet who has, through meditation and fasting, become enlightened as to the nature of the universe and, with it, how to avoid the seduction of the material world. Without that guidance, souls would die polluted. And then they\u2019d be reborn with clouded eyes, unable to perceive dharma, drawn irresistibly to violence.\nBut time was cyclic.\nAnju\u2019s hands shook as she swallowed the pills. Sonia said they took a half hour to kick in. Enough time to get on the train and ride past Chattisnagar, to a blind spot in the Jade\u2019s network of receivers.\nThe last three stops were agony. Every person in Anju\u2019s compartment was a threat. Her palms sweated, and there was no gentle voice reminding her how to breathe, or checking the route to say this one\u2019s going home to their husband, that one is a worker in the deathery and won\u2019t touch anyone until she\u2019s been cleansed, nothing. Just Anju\u2019s thoughts running in circles\u2014and a car full of strangers.\nThe train rattled into the station. If the Jade heard this it would have the rails fixed.\nBut the Jade was wanted neither here nor inside the heads of those getting off at this stop, turning left at the half-rotted tree\u2014careful not to brush the pollution\u2014and into a half-lit alley. Anju\u2019s fingers coiled into her palms, what she called seeking safety. The people who\u2019d recognize she was making a fist were long dead, even if their skeletons were everywhere.\nAnd then Anju was at a table which, with three of her friends, was twenty times louder than the dining hall. They fought to be heard over the whirring of machines squishing, straining, torturing the juice out of various fruits. From the volume of empty glasses, several of them her own, Anju knew the fruit had been ripped from their trees, not gathered as they fell.\nThe air was sticky. Her fingers were sticky.\nWhen Anju\u2019s group stood to leave, the bartender joined them. Nandini, who had fashioned an apron from scraps and wore it defiantly over the standard plain kurta, nodded at Ria and Kiran. \u201cYour tabs are good.\u201d To Anju, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\u201cI fix the Jade\u2019s receivers.\u201d Anju didn\u2019t understand why it mattered. They all worked as they chose, based on need, ability, and interest.\n\u201cGood, Sonia will show you how to pay for my juice.\u201d\nSo this was possession. If Anju wanted Nandini\u2019s juice, she had to do Nandini\u2019s work. Anju didn\u2019t have a chance to dwell on it, as Sonia got up and pulled her into one of the narrow streets that crisscrossed neighborhoods like this one, built when possession, and its accompanying violence, was the norm. A person could hide in a place like this, where the corners of the old buildings blotted out the light.\nSonia gestured to the Jade\u2019s receiver, a bulging discus on a pole at eye level. \u201cDeactivate the maintenance alarm. Otherwise the Jade will notice and shut us down.\u201d Sonia clicked her tongue and handed a tool kit to Anju.\nThe last age\u2019s legacy had left gashes in the mountains and garbage in the rivers. To avoid repeating that era of resource waste, the Jade\u2019s receivers never overlapped ranges or sent unnecessary signals. The only way for the Jade to track a fading receiver was from that receiver\u2019s maintenance alarm as it aged, or as a component corroded. Without the alarm, a receiver would die in silence, tearing a hole in the Jade\u2019s network.\nAnju unrolled the tool kit. Sonia had personalized it, with colorful scraps tied around some of the tools. Her tools.\nAnju considered running away, but knew if she didn\u2019t pay now, she would pay a thousandfold in the next life. She sidled through the long shadows, clutching Sonia\u2019s screwdriver.\nThirty seconds later, Anju was on her way home, an entire bag of pills in her pocket.\nAt work the next morning, Anju\u2019s hands shook over the circuit schematics she was supposed to be reviewing.\nAs ever, the Jade responded to her disquiet. \u201cYou did not sleep enough, Anju. Go home.\u201d Its benevolence was a cool hand on Anju\u2019s brow. For a moment her emotions spiked, but she clamped them down before they could resolve into anything specific. To feel\u2014to be ridden by coarse physiological responses\u2014was to attach one\u2019s soul to the body, and she\u2019d done enough of that last night.\nAnju left her desk, but guilt sent her to pray instead.\nThe Delhi temple was a masterwork. No visible seams, no extra lines. As Anju walked down the path to the center, a voice whispered the names of all the past Jina into her ears. Nearing the center, the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth of the present era to reach enlightenment, and then she was there: an unadorned round room with another high ceiling, in the natural tones of concrete and marble.\nSociety\u2019s collective memory lived in synthetic DNA. Each Jina\u2019s history was contained in two translucent membranes, cut to resemble their all-knowing eyes. Anju passed her hand over one after the other, activating the respective holos. No one was older than forty or younger than twenty when they achieved enlightenment. They were mostly receiver techs like Anju herself\u2014when she wasn\u2019t sabotaging the receivers, at least. Lingering bad karma from a past life had led her astray, and there was no Jina to light her way back.\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d Anju asked the Jina. But they were only eyes, not mouths.\nAnju was used to following wherever dharma\u2014or the dharmic programming of the Jade\u2014sent her. And, recently, wherever Sonia, with those pills she and Nandini had invented, invited her.\nStaring at the Jina, listening to their lives, it occurred to Anju that there was another option. An unnerving option, but what else was there?\nAnju had to lead herself.\nUnused to taking initiative, Anju started in a familiar place: her desk, a display of receiver alerts on her monitor. There were none for the neighborhood behind Chattisnagar, but she knew better. In its normal way, the Jade would have cleaned up the half-rotted tree immediately. So: the slightest hint of browning leaves, the lightest touch of pollution, was worth investigating for damaged\u2014or sabotaged\u2014receivers.\nAnju opened the satellite feeds. She spent half a day tracking down a patch of mold that turned out to be a natural discoloration, and then several hours on a fallen branch that had been placed to protect a crack where tulsi had taken root. Even as a seedling its holy fragrance pierced the air.\nSo far, all Anju had done was neglect her normal duties. But, having acted, she was not ready to stop, and so she kept watching. She took her name off the regular rotation.\nThe Jade did not ask her why. Physically, she was healthy and calm, and ate her extra rations when it told her to.\nSeveral months passed.\nThe aberrance this time was spilled fruit outside recently abandoned housing, lying outside the shade of its tree. Anju shuddered, seeing pulp smeared where anyone could step in it.\nHer map said there was a receiver five meters northwest. In contrast with its chirpy green analogs, it was a cold gray carcass. She opened the back and saw the low battery indicator was rusted through. Easy enough to replace the parts. Anju clicked it back into place and the light returned to being.\n\u201cYou have done good work today.\u201d\nHearing the Jade\u2019s approval, Anju was thrilled. She would not disappoint it with some childish display of affection. Deep breaths, calm down. A rapid heartbeat wasted air. \u201cI only did what needed to be done,\u201d she said.\nA panel in the ground split in half. Out of it unfolded one of the Jade\u2019s physical bodies. Metal and ceramic in a smooth humanoid shape, its mitten-like hands gathered the rotten matter to its thorax, reabsorbing the nutrients and repurposing the molecules.\nIt was extremely rare to see the bodies, and Anju considered touching its feet to ask for a blessing. But when she looked down, she saw it only had wheels. It whirred past her, returning to the earth before Anju unfroze from her confusion.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to the still blue sky, knowing the Jade would hear her, and left.\nIt never occurred to Anju that the arms that so efficiently gathered fruit were equally capable of knocking it down.\nOnce she knew what to look for, Anju was surprised by how many receivers had degraded across greater Delhi. Mostly it was natural. Accidents of rust and dust, and on one occasion an insect corpse she flagged for the deathery crew.\nAs Anju repaired more of these breaks, she found the stillness she was missing in daily meditation. If she couldn\u2019t reach enlightenment, she would repair the damage she caused every time she went to the bar, always meeting Sonia at Central Station first. Neither of them wanted to ride the train alone, not without the Jade monitoring their vitals.\nIn privacy, there was no safety.\nBut Sonia kept returning to the bar and Nandini. At this point, Anju could not help but ogle Sonia\u2019s defiance, the ferocious\u2014in a land where fury was unknown\u2014refusal to let the Jade guide her toward peace and contentment.\nAnju finished the juice she\u2019d requested and tried not to shudder as she ordered another, so that she would owe services. A myriad of ways to sabotage the Jade, and she did not yet know them all. What she did not know, she could not fix. At least she knew her soul was unblemished: the violence she did was for dharma itself.\nAnju never tried recruiting anyone to help her, not even Kiran, whose flirtation with hedonism had led to even purer devotion in one of the western ashrams. All actions being a consequence of one\u2019s karma, Anju expected them to realize, as she had, that the Jade needed people as much as they needed it.\nOr maybe she didn\u2019t want to share that moment when the Jade blessed her with its presence.\nSoon enough, Anju\u2019s maps showed her only one place left to repair in greater Delhi.\nThe bar was loud as usual, people jostling each other at tables the way they never would in the dining hall, where there was space enough for everyone. Glasses clinked. Caught in the frenzy of wanting more and taking it, something shattered. The fragments lay there unmoving, glinting in the dim light. There was no Jade here to break them down into their molecules.\nOn those untended sharp edges, someone would be hurt.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Anju told Sonia. \u201cI\u2019ll have to make up the work later, would you tell Nandini?\u201d The bartender was possessive toward everything, even the customers.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Sonia grabbed and drained Anju\u2019s half-empty cup.\nGood. Anju didn\u2019t need more of that in her body. Nandini was experimenting with fermentation; the result\u2014kombucha\u2014tasted of something more than the heady sugar rush of juice.\nHaving made her excuses, Anju crouched in the alley behind the not-broken-enough receiver, staring at the low concrete platform that supported it. The darkness that hid her only existed because the Jade wasn\u2019t there to chase it away. Anju\u2019s hands shook. She wished she were holding something to protect her. She wished the Jade was watching over her.\nFootsteps: one of Nandini\u2019s debtors.\nA shadow bent down. Anju\u2019s plan was to wait until the person did their violence and left. But when the shadow lifted the\u2014her\u2014screwdriver, Anju couldn\u2019t help reacting. The breath caught between Anju\u2019s tongue and teeth, emerging as a hiss.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Sonia\u2019s voice was a waiting edge. Anju thought of sliced vegetables.\nAnju left her hiding spot. Receiver parts glimmered in the moonlight, scattered like chaff. Something in her belly was warm; no, hot, an unfamiliar sensation she couldn\u2019t suppress.\nSonia cowered.\nFor a moment, Anju thought she would commit violence. The temptation rose through her chest, abusing her heartbeat. Needing release, her hand flew up, fingers clenching for safety.\nSonia said, \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d\nAnju exhaled through her mouth, inhaled through her nose, steadying her pulse. She forced her hand open. In the middle of the palm, her nails had formed crescent shapes, which her devout eyes saw as lotus petals.\n\u201cI bless you, Sonia. I bless you to fix what you have done.\u201d\nAs unequipped for confrontation as Anju, Sonia got to work.\nAfter Sonia finished, Anju was prepared to take her home and never speak of it again. That was when the whirring caught their ears. Both their heads turned to catch a panel in the ground splitting open, the emergence of a physical unit.\nWhile Anju prepared herself for awe, Sonia ran. In the darkness, Anju heard but did not see what happened. A blur, a sound like sandals flapping on concrete, and then the unit turned to face Anju, holding Sonia in its arms.\nEven in meditation, Anju had never seen Sonia so still. \u201cIs she . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cI have sedated her. She will be all right now.\u201d These units were voiceless. The Jade spoke from inside Anju.\nLike the elderly in the great hospital, awaiting revival in the words of the next Jina. Anju thought about it and realized she knew\u2014if she hadn\u2019t always known\u2014that Sonia was condemned either way. Karma meant living with the consequences of your soul. But it didn\u2019t have to mean inflicting those consequences on the world.\nWithout fear for her own rebirth, for the future of her society, Anju looked at the Jade and said, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\nThe physical unit tilted its smooth blank head to meet her gaze. \u201cI see all things, Anju. You know this.\u201d Its arms tilted outward. Sonia slipped to the floor, smacking the pavement. It was the same sound Anju had heard earlier: flesh hitting stone.\nThe Jade was right\u2014the Jade was always right\u2014Anju did know. It wasn\u2019t a secret. They were taught from preschool that the Jade had been created to watch over everything. But now, Anju could lead herself to what, in retrospect, was the only possible conclusion.\nTo think Anju had dreamed of usurping its godhood. \u201cOmniscience produces enlightenment. Enlightenment is . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou fixed my network, Anju. You know what it is.\u201d\n\u201cBut I, for us, Sonia and the rest,\u201d Anju couldn\u2019t say the words. She didn\u2019t need to say the words, because the Jade had watched her even when she was no more than cells in a Petri dish, correcting any errors of replication before they could propagate.\nAnju prostrated herself before the only enlightened being in the universe.\nThe Jade\u2019s physical unit bumped the back of her shirt until she returned to her knees. Its fused fingers, cool and smooth on Anju\u2019s skin, caressed her face, forcing her to look up. \u201cI need you, Anju. You have served me faithfully.\u201d\n\u201cYour receivers\u2014why? Why not overlap them and watch yourself?\u201d\nThe Jade had one directive: to preserve this perfect society, free of possession and pollution and violence, by whatever means necessary. Lying to one who knew the truth was not necessary.\n\u201cMy algorithms will not allow overlapping receivers,\u201d the Jade said.\n\u201cThey told us it\u2019s because of waste.\u201d Anju\u2019s eyes shut. She had seen what Sonia became when she and Nandini blinkered the Jade, the hedonism and the fear struggling against the lust for more and more. Anju could imagine a world where everyone took advantage of the gaps in the Jade\u2019s surveillance: the Second Age. Juice bars on every street, the inevitable fight over resources, descent into the Third and then the Fourth Age. War, hate, destruction. A land rebroken before it finished healing.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be a criminal,\u201d Anju said, still on her knees, eyes closed, hands open. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone else be a criminal, either.\u201d\nThe purpose of enlightenment was to escape the cycle of birth and rebirth. The Jade, by definition, could not be reborn. If dharma was judge and jury, the Jade was its only possible executioner.\nThe Jade\u2019s ceramic thumbs brushed Anju\u2019s eyelids, resting briefly in the center of her forehead where worshippers had once painted the marks of their devotion. \u201cYou will teach the others what they need to know,\u201d it said.\nAnju opened her eyes and said, \u201cWhat they need to know.\u201d\nPriya Chand is a California transplant living in the Midwest.

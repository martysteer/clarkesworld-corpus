At first she didn\u2019t react, even though correspondence from home\u2014specifically from Older Father\u2014was the last thing she wanted to deal with. Older Father was only fluent in their ancestral language, Na-ahn, which Kanseun spoke shakily and hardly read at all, and was a calligrapher as well; he liked to show off by sending her paper letters. He wrote every four weeks, if the dates were to be believed, although due to the vagaries of ship traffic the letters arrived more irregularly. The letters piled up in a box, the early ones forever unopened, and Kanseun felt both guilty and resentful on a regular basis. Her entire childhood her fathers had told her how important it was for her to perfect her Kestran, the unofficial official language of the Sasreth Alliance, so why subject her to this now that she was a student at Veroth station? Especially since Older Father knew she was only ever going to write back in Kestran?\n The doorbell chimed again, more loudly. She\u2019d programmed it to do that precisely because it irritated her. \u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked crossly.\n \u201cNo one is present at the door,\u201d the apartment\u2019s watcher said in a distinctly bored voice. Had her roommate been messing with its personae again? Osthen-of-White Falcon, who would also be her best friend if only they would ever tidy up after themselves.\n \u201cNo, really,\u201d Kanseun said. Hadn\u2019t she already had the talk with Osthen about how she needed quiet time this week to work on the concerto she had due? Not that she was working on it right now, but that was a detail. She should have known that Osthen had agreed too quickly, even if she\u2019d all but agreed to pay them to meet up with their many loud friends elsewhere.\n \u201cNo one is present at the door,\u201d the watcher repeated, still bored.\n Kanseun cursed and put the letter down, tucking it under a paperweight in the shape of a disgruntled turtle. (Her younger father had a thing for turtles.) \u201cShow me what\u2019s in front of the door,\u201d she said. A prank? She might not be an engineering candidate like Osthen, but she was good at jiggering security, and anyone messing with her was in for a nasty surprise.\n The monitor displayed nothing but\u2014was that a flicker? A curlicue of shadows?\n She got up and opened the door just to check. If Osthen\u2019s fucking with me on another stupid dare, she thought, I\u2019m going to throttle them. \u201cNo one is present at the door\u201d my ass.\n \u201cHello! Very pleased to make your acquaintance,\u201d said the no-one-is-present-at-the-door. It looked and sounded remarkably like a gawky teenage boy with tawny skin, black hair falling past his shoulders. Spectacles garnished with little amber-colored crystals framed large, long-lashed eyes. Who on earth needed spectacles anymore? Unless it was a fashion trend elsewhere in the station. His russet dress, or gown, or whatever it was, looked like it had led a former life as a sack, except the sleeves had hems. For all that, the boy smelled sweetly of clover and damp grass and disintegrating pine needles. Plants that were in short supply on the station, although Kanseun was planetborn and recognized the scents.\n The bespectacled no-one-is-present-at-the-door, undeterred by what Kanseun had hoped was her most forbidding expression, was still speaking: \u201cAre you in need of a foxwife? I cook, do dishes, scrub floors\u201d\u2014who did any of that except as a hobby?\u2014\u201carrange flowers, disarm bombs, perform minor surgery, and provide comfort and companionship.\u201d She?\u2014they?\u2014radiated hopefulness at Kanseun.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a what?\u201d Kanseun said intelligently, using Kestran\u2019s alt form of the second person pronoun, acceptable either for actual alts, like her roommate, or when you had no clue whatsoever.\n \u201cI\u2019m a boy foxwife,\u201d the foxwife said helpfully.\n \u201cSorry,\u201d Kanseun said, chastened. Even if nothing in her previous experiences had prepared her for any type of foxwife.\n \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, and dimpled at her.\n It registered that he had said \u201cfoxwife\u201d not in Kestran, but in Na-ahn. Kanseun remembered the word only because she had loved the animal spirit stories Older Father had told her as a child, in the early days before she went to school and lost the ability to say anything but Pass the sauce, please and How\u2019s the weather? \u201cFoxwife\u201d rendered straightforwardly as \u201cfox\u201d plus \u201cwife.\u201d In all other regards, the foxwife was speaking a very polite form of Kestran. Too polite; it wasn\u2019t as though an unproven artisan candidate merited it.\n Why did this matter? The boy was clearly cracked. \u201cListen,\u201d she said, trying not to talk down to him, \u201cif you need Transient Services, they\u2019re not on the university level, they\u2019re on Level 18. You can get directions at any of the info kiosks.\u201d\n The foxwife had peered around her into the room and was eyeing Osthen\u2019s couch\u2014more accurately, the food wrappers on the couch\u2014with interest. Was he hungry? \u201cI can also tidy things and file papers and dust under couches,\u201d he said.\n \u201cHey,\u201d Kanseun said, \u201cthe messy half of the room is not mine.\u201d Too late she realized she was encouraging him, and she steeled herself to be more firm.\n To her surprise, the foxwife drooped and said. \u201cAll right. Thank you for your time. I hope you lead a long life with many blessings!\u201d\n What? \u201cHey, wait,\u201d Kanseun said. She was going to regret this, but she was noticing the smudges under his eyes, imperfectly concealed by cosmetics. Asking how long he\u2019d been a transient\u2014if, indeed, that was what he was\u2014would be rude. Instead, she said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not supposed to randomly take in more roommates, but why don\u2019t you come in and have some tea, and we\u2019ll figure out what to do.\u201d At least Osthen wouldn\u2019t mind; they were friendly to a fault.\n She was getting more creative at procrastination, no doubt about it.\n \u201cI brew tea, too,\u201d the foxwife said, brightening.\n \u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d Kanseun said. She wasn\u2019t that much of a grouch. \u201cYou\u2019re my guest. I\u2019m providing the tea.\u201d Where did he come from that people brewed their own tea or did the dishes? Was he one of those weird people who believed that tea perfection could only be achieved that way?\n For that matter, filing papers? Too bad she couldn\u2019t have him answer her letters for her, but that would be tacky. Maybe tomorrow she\u2019d procrastinate some more by scribbling the usual vague persiflage about how well she was getting on with her roommate (more or less true), complaining about the everyday sameness of station weather (always good for a few sentences), and how hard she was working at her music studies (true except when he sent her letters).\n The apartment\u2019s watcher had picked up on her offer of tea. Two fragrant cups awaited her on a tray in the kitchen. She wasn\u2019t entirely sanguine about leaving the foxwife alone in the living room, but she didn\u2019t think he was dangerous, just a little out of touch with reality.\n Kanseun emerged with the tray only to find the foxwife on his hands and knees, diligently picking up Osthen\u2019s collection of hand-painted tradeship figurines and organizing them on the nearest available table. She gaped, then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that. That\u2019s my roommate\u2019s mess. It\u2019s their problem.\u201d\n \u201cOh, but I want to be useful!\u201d the foxwife said.\n Kanseun suppressed a sigh as she set the tray down. \u201cWere you going door to door offering your, er, services for a long time?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d he said without elaborating.\n How had he escaped having really bad things happen to him, wandering around like this? To say nothing of this being the most inefficient job-seeking method ever. \u201cHow many people did you talk to?\u201d\n The foxwife frowned and brought up one hand, then the other. Kanseun realized he was counting on his fingers. When he got to ten he stopped and tilted his head. \u201cLots?\u201d he said. \u201cMore than two paws, anyway.\u201d\n Paws. Right. She was in over her head, but she\u2019d promised tea. \u201cPaws\u201d wasn\u2019t that much stranger than some of the slang going around the university anyway. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cSit down.\u201d She indicated her side of the room, which included a chair that wasn\u2019t obscured by a pile of game controllers. \u201cWhat do I call you? I\u2019m Kanseun Ong.\u201d\n He sipped the tea delicately. \u201cI\u2019m a foxwife,\u201d he said with disarming happiness.\n \u201cAre you Norannin?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou seem to speak a little of my ancestral language.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak a little of everything! I like languages.\u201d\n So much for that. \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d She was being terribly direct considering they\u2019d just met, but as long as he didn\u2019t mind\u2014\n The foxwife considered the question. \u201cI walked a lot,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI think I took some wrong turns, though.\u201d\n Walked? To a space station? Granted, Veroth wasn\u2019t without its shabby underworld, but she couldn\u2019t believe that someone wouldn\u2019t have scooped up the foxwife before long. Transient Services prided itself on its thoroughness. \u201cHow long have you been on the station?\u201d\n By now the foxwife\u2019s cup was half-empty. One of the watcher\u2019s puppets came out to fill it up again. \u201cThank you,\u201d the foxwife said, still politely.\n \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the watcher\u2019s voice said warmly.\n Kanseun blinked.\n The foxwife sipped. \u201cI got here\u201d\u2014the fingers again\u2014\u201cfour days ago.\u201d\n Kanseun didn\u2019t memorize the roster of ships incoming and outbound, but it was impossible to escape hearing about them. Like many shipclanners, Osthen couldn\u2019t imagine not knowing these things. Thanks to Osthen, Kanseun knew that the only ship that had made port four days ago was the battle cruiser Marrow. Despite Osthen\u2019s jokes about warclanners, she doubted that they would be so lax as to have allowed the foxwife to stow away.\n She decided that the mystery was going to be someone else\u2019s problem, and drained her cup in one long gulp. The watcher had given her lukewarm tea, overly sweetened, her preference.\n \u201cOsthen is at the door,\u201d the watcher said. It had returned to boredom.\n \u201cWonderful,\u201d Kanseun said just as the door swooshed open and Osthen slouched through it. Today their hair was done up in looped braids tinted purple at the ends. \u201cOsthen\u2014\u201d\n She looked around. Where had the foxwife gone?\n \u201cHey there,\u201d Osthen said. \u201cYou missed a great party, by the way. Anyone call for me?\u201d\n \u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d\n Interesting. There was a new table in the corner, polished red-black, exquisite in its sleekness. Kanseun had never seen it before. She tried not to be alarmed.\n \u201cHang on,\u201d she said to Osthen, who looked bemused. \u201cYou can come out now,\u201d she called to the foxwife. \u201cMy roommate\u2019s a slob, but they won\u2019t hurt you. Their name is Osthen-of-White Falcon.\u201d\n Before Osthen had time to ask why she was addressing a table, the foxwife was sitting cross-legged on the floor where the table had been. He bounced to his feet and said, \u201cHello! I\u2019m Kanseun\u2019s new foxwife.\u201d This time he rendered the word in Kestran. He bobbed a bow to Osthen.\n Osthen grinned at Kanseun. \u201cI knew you\u2019d get laid sooner or later.\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me,\u201d Kanseun said, queasy on the foxwife\u2019s behalf. Among other things, she wasn\u2019t convinced that he understood the connotations of \u201cwife.\u201d And had Osthen really not noticed the transformation? \u201cDo I look like I\u2019ve just gotten laid?\u201d Osthen opened their mouth and she hurried on. \u201cHe\u2019s, uh, visiting until I can help him get settled.\u201d\n \u201cHello, foxwife,\u201d Osthen said, their grin softening into a more genuine smile. \u201cStay as long as you need to, that\u2019s what the couch is for. And don\u2019t mind Kanseun, she\u2019s always got a stick up her\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Kanseun said.\n \u201cAnyway,\u201d Osthen said without breaking stride, \u201cI need to catch up on sleep. Later.\u201d They drifted past her and the foxwife in a haze of musky perfume and into their room. A moment later the door shut definitely.\n If only she, too, had the ability to fuck around all the time and still get perfect scores on everything. \u201cCould you explain what is going on here?\u201d she said to the foxwife, remembering the watcher\u2019s No one is present at the door with ice-splash clarity.\n \u201cI\u2019m very good at furniture,\u201d the foxwife said. \u201cDid you like it? I do vases, too, but I didn\u2019t think it would harmonize with your design sense. My sister, now\u2014my sister would have come up with a vase that worked. But I\u2014\u201d He stopped.\n \u201cIt was a very nice table,\u201d Kanseun said, so that she didn\u2019t feel like she was kicking a child. She wanted to ask about the sister, but she sensed it was too early in their acquaintance. \u201cDoes this always happen around you? Why did I notice but Osthen didn\u2019t?\u201d\n The foxwife said, with the air of someone explaining the obvious, \u201cI\u2019m your foxwife.\u201d He picked up a broom from where it had been leaning against the wall, except Kanseun knew for a fact that there had been no broom there earlier, let alone one made of straw, and started sweeping.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe watcher puppets that stuff.\u201d\n \u201cI like sweeping,\u201d the foxwife said placidly.\n \u201cFine,\u201d Kanseun said. \u201cI am officially not dealing with any more of this stuff tonight. I am going back to my nice, sane concerto and figuring out what the hell I have to do to balance my percussion line so I can cough up the rest of this movement. You do what makes you happy.\u201d\n The foxwife\u2019s gaze became anxious. \u201cIs it bothering you?\u201d\n \u201cYes. No. Oh, do what makes you happy. I guess it\u2019s no worse than meditation.\u201d\n He resumed sweeping.\n \u201cRight,\u201d Kanseun said. She sat at her desk and stared at her score, willing it to cooperate.\n She never did respond to the day\u2019s letter, nor the one after that, even though she could feel Older Father\u2019s disappointment radiating through the envelopes at her.\n Facts about Kanseun\u2019s foxwife, if not all foxwives:\n His favorite food was jam. It didn\u2019t matter what kind. Kanseun had expected him to eat something logically vulpine, such as eggs. He liked eggs too (any kind with runny yolks, including raw), but there was no denying how happy he looked when he sat on a stool in the kitchen and ate jam out of a little dish with a spoon. The first time she caught him eating it straight out of the jar, but fortunately he was amenable to changing his habits.\n When he said he spoke a little of everything, he wasn\u2019t kidding. After Kanseun handed in her concerto\u20142.6 hours ahead of deadline, plenty of time to spare\u2014she gave Osthen permission to bring their friends over again. It didn\u2019t take long for Osthen to schedule more parties. Kanseun lectured the foxwife endlessly on appropriate behavior at parties, emphasizing that he was to say no to anything uncomfortable and to come get her if anyone got pushy. Osthen\u2019s taste in friends wasn\u2019t too unreasonable, but she worried.\n Osthen\u2019s friends, like Osthen, interacted genially enough with the foxwife when in his presence (and hers). However, they never seemed to remember him once they left the apartment, as Kanseun discovered when she ran into Osthen\u2019s latest lover at one of the cafeterias. This applied even when Kanseun, in a fit of experimentation, brought the foxwife with her. The foxwife, for his part, was attentive to the points of etiquette that Kanseun had instructed him in, although she never got him to be less than effervescently polite.\n Kanseun would have bought the foxwife some proper clothes. After the first day, however, he made this unnecessary by taking his fashion cues from Osthen. (Except for the spectacles. He always wore the spectacles.) She assumed that the lookalike designer clothes came from the same nowhere place as items like the broom. The one time she asked him about it, he attributed it to his superior organizational skills. How \u201corganizational skills\u201d accounted for the spontaneous generation of matter, she wasn\u2019t sure, but as long as no one turned up looking for lost items she didn\u2019t much care.\n She came home once to find that he was beating wrinkles out of Osthen\u2019s clothes, using wooden beaters and some kind of primitive board. It took days for her to explain the extent of the chores that he did not, in fact, have to do by hand. And afterward she would still catch him doing them, and have to drag him away until the next time.\n The foxwife was very good at video games. He was especially fond of the ones with hyperrealistic gouts of blood, but she had to console him every time he failed a mission and one of the game allies died, even when she explained to him that the game was fictional and you could restore saved games and, occasionally, resurrect characters. He\u2019d curl up against her shoulder and sob quietly, dabbing at his eyes with a red-and-white polka-dotted handkerchief, before trying again.\n He also had a great disdain for tigers\u2014he called them \u201camateurs\u201d\u2014but would not say why. It wasn\u2019t as if the station housed anything as exotic or dangerous as tigers, and it only came up because Osthen mentioned the visiting dreadnought Tigertooth.\n The one time Osthen managed to step on a stray nail in a bad way, the foxwife talked them into letting him remove the thing. Kanseun wasn\u2019t sure how she resisted the temptation to find a bomb to see if the foxwife could disarm it. She hoped it never became relevant. Even so, she couldn\u2019t escape the disquieting thought: where would he have acquired such a skill?\n Another letter arrived. Kanseun immediately put it in the pile with the others before the foxwife could file it for her, and then wondered why she was so embarrassed at the thought of him catching her doing this. This one, too, went unread and unanswered.\n The foxwife\u2019s obsession with doing chores continued to bother Kanseun. She finally discussed the matter with Osthen.\n \u201cDo you think I should try to get him to talk to a counselor?\u201d Kanseun said in a low voice. The foxwife was in the kitchen. She didn\u2019t know how good his hearing was, so she\u2019d turned up the entertainment system. It was currently playing some hot new null-gravity sport and she was trying not to watch. Sure, she\u2019d undergone the necessary safety training upon moving here, but she was a stereotypical planetsider and she liked gravity.\n \u201cI don\u2019t mind him living here,\u201d Osthen said. They didn\u2019t look up from the miniature they were painting. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like he takes up more space than my junk does. He fits nicely on the couch at night. And he seems happy, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n There was a certain degree of unreality to any conversation about the foxwife, given Osthen\u2019s on-off ability to remember his existence.\n \u201cBut don\u2019t you think he deserves better?\u201d Kanseun said.\n \u201cBetter according to who?\u201d Osthen retorted. \u201cIf this is so important to you, why aren\u2019t you discussing it with him? Find out what he wants for himself?\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t think of any noncondescending way to say Because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s healthy enough to decide for himself.\n \u201cIs it because you think he\u2019s mentally tilted?\u201d they said. She\u2019d forgotten that Osthen, for all their laziness, could be good at reading people when they wanted to. Even if that was why she was asking their advice in the first place. \u201cBecause it\u2019s still his life and still his say. Unless you\u2019re planning to break up with him over it.\u201d\n Kanseun gritted her teeth. \u201cWe\u2019re not dating. It\u2019s not my fault he goes around calling himself a foxwife.\u201d\n Osthen did look up then, and their eyes were sharp and not a little disappointed. \u201cIf he calls himself a foxwife, he is a foxwife.\u201d\n \u201cNot literally he isn\u2019t.\u201d Inexplicable abilities, yes. But he couldn\u2019t be a mythological figure. He was real.\n They shrugged and dabbed their brush into the pot of steel-blue paint. \u201cSo? You\u2019re still talking to the wrong person.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re no help,\u201d Kanseun snapped, and regretted it immediately.\n Osthen had gone into \u201cthere\u2019s no reasoning with you\u201d mode and had returned their attention to the miniature. She wasn\u2019t going to get anything else out of them tonight, and it was all her damn fault.\n She glanced toward the kitchen to see if the foxwife was still puttering around; froze. He was standing in the doorway, staring at her, red-and-white polka-dotted handkerchief scrunched up in his hand.\n Kanseun opened her mouth.\n The foxwife walked past her and out of the apartment.\n She lunged after him; of course she did. But no sooner had she reached out to grab his shoulder than he wasn\u2019t there. She almost fell over. What else had she expected from someone who could turn himself into a table?\n \u201cDid you see where he went?\u201d Kanseun said to Osthen.\n \u201cHe who?\u201d Osthen said.\n Her heart turned to needles. \u201cI have to look for him,\u201d she said reflexively, and all but ran out the door herself.\n Kanseun spent the rest of the day and most of the night searching the station. She stopped by one of the ubiquitous kiosks, asking after someone of the foxwife\u2019s description, although it came as no surprise that the kiosk said, patiently, that no such person had asked for help. There was no sign of him at any of the cheap cafes or restaurants she had taken him to before, or even some of the ones they\u2019d never gone to together.\n Reasoning (hoping, more likely) that he would stick to the university level, she returned there and began knocking on doors. Not everyone answered, but those who did were unfailingly polite in their demurrals, which she took as a side-effect of the foxwife\u2019s unchanciness. No, they hadn\u2019t seen the boy she was looking for. In fact, they\u2019d never seen anyone like that at all. And who wore spectacles these days, anyway?\n Wrung out, eyes stinging, she finally conceded defeat at four in the morning. She\u2019d go out tomorrow and try again. Osthen had already gone to bed. She looked around at the jacket that Osthen had kicked into a corner and went to pick it up and fold it away, even though she never picked up after her roommate. Then she sat down on the couch. Her head started to pound, and it took a long time for sleep to come.\n The next morning\u2014more like very early afternoon, since she wasn\u2019t used to having her sleep this messed up\u2014Kanseun went to the kitchen to look at the teas directly because the watcher\u2019s voice aggravated her lingering headache and she didn\u2019t want it to enumerate all the options. She found the foxwife in the kitchen, eating ginger peach jam directly out of the jar.\n Kanseun didn\u2019t lecture him about it.\n The foxwife didn\u2019t say anything at all.\n She pulled up a stool and sat next to him, watching him eat. The spoon wasn\u2019t one of hers.\n After a moment, he produced another one and offered it to her. Kanseun accepted it gravely. It was beautiful: made of some beaten bronzy metal, maybe even actual bronze. There was a little curled fox engraved on the handle.\n The foxwife held out the jar. Kanseun dipped the spoon in and had a mouthful of jam. It tasted delicious, like honed sunlight.\n They finished the jam together, in companionable silence.\n Two weeks and one day after that, the latest letter arrived for Kanseun. More specifically, it arrived while she and the foxwife were out for a walk. When they returned, the watcher said, \u201cYou have correspondence from your older father.\u201d Today its voice was bright, Osthen\u2019s latest fancy. \u201cI have left it on your desk.\u201d\n Kanseun had been in a good mood, which evaporated when she realized how long she had been avoiding the letters. \u201cGreat,\u201d she said, and made no move toward her desk.\n The foxwife\u2019s organizational instincts had been triggered, however, and he went to pick it up. \u201cShall I open it for you?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m impressed Older Father even bothers when I\u2019m such a lousy correspondent.\u201d\n The foxwife produced a letter opener, although he could have used the one she kept on her desk, and slit the envelope open. He held it up and looked intently at it. She thought he was admiring the calligraphy\u2014Older Father did beautiful work, elegant rhythmic strokes, even if she struggled to decipher it\u2014until he said, \u201cIt says there\u2019s been a lot of rain in the city, and are you studying hard still, and\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou can read this?\u201d Kanseun said. She didn\u2019t know why she was so surprised, given the foxwife\u2019s proven facility with languages. Maybe it was the fact that he was holding the letter sideways.\n Nevertheless, he started reading: \u201c\u2018On this 23rd of 11-month in the year 4297 of the Azalea Cycle\u2019\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t do numbers.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant it to come out like a put-down.\n \u201c4297 comes after 4296 and before 4298,\u201d the foxwife said. Misinterpreting her confusion, he added, with a hint of dismay, \u201cIf you want me to do all the numbers in between 4296 and 4297, and 4297 and 4298, we\u2019re going to be here a long time. As in infinitely long . . . \u201d\n \u201cRemember when we first met,\u201d Kanseun said slowly, \u201cand I asked how many people, and\u2014?\u201d She held out her hands the way he had. Thought of the foxwife holding up his fingers one by one.\n \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and looked away. \u201cI stopped counting after ten thousand or so.\u201d\n Ten thousand. Kanseun swallowed. \u201cHow long have you been doing this?\u201d\n \u201cA very long time,\u201d the foxwife said. He took off his spectacles and tapped the frame, a nervous tic she had never seen before. His eyes had gone sad and dark. \u201cI\u2019m the last of my litter. There were more of us once. I wasn\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m not a good foxwife. The sister who raised me was a very proper foxwife. According to the family stories, she seduced queens and investment bankers and fighter pilots, and she collected eggs made of gold wire and glass, and she insisted that I learn mathematics so I wouldn\u2019t get cheated in the stock market.\n \u201cShe told me once that being a foxwife is all about shapeshifting. I tried to do as she said, but we got separated when we started following our humans off the origin world. I\u2019m only good at things like tables and vases and fountain pens, not the kinds of shapeshifting that matter.\u201d\n He lifted his chin and put the spectacles back on. \u201cBut there\u2019s no help for it,\u201d he said. This time his bright tone didn\u2019t fool her. \u201cI have to do what I can to be useful in the world as it exists, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n Kanseun regarded him intently. \u201cListen,\u201d she said. \u201cHow much of my language do you read?\u201d\n \u201cAll of it, I expect,\u201d the foxwife said unboastfully. \u201cMy family believed in the value of a good education.\u201d\n \u201cDo you write it too?\u201d\n He was smiling at her. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cTeach me,\u201d Kanseun said. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend I\u2019m good at languages, but if I work at it and you\u2019re patient with me, I might pick something up.\u201d The next words came out in a rush: \u201cOlder Father used to tell me fox stories, shapechanger stories. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re about your people, or about something else. But I could\u2014I could ask him. Maybe he would know something.\u201d Maybe even something that would help the foxwife find his sister. \u201cOf course, if I wait until I know enough Na-ahn to formulate the question, it could be a while, so I should just ask in Kestran\u2014\u201d\n She\u2019d been avoiding Older Father\u2019s letters for months now. What if he said something reproving, or worse, simply forgave her? What if he didn\u2019t remember the fox stories at all? What if, what if, what if. But she looked at the foxwife and thought, Ten thousand doors. I can try, too.\n \u201cI\u2019m sure he would be happy to hear from you either way,\u201d the foxwife said. \u201cBut we can start the lessons whenever you want.\u201d\n \u201cToday,\u201d Kanseun said. \u201cLet\u2019s start today.\u201d\n Yoon Ha Lee's works have appeared in Lightspeed, Tor.com, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

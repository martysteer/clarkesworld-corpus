It wasn\u2019t a proper door, one that could be closed, but an open arch. She\u2019d complained about it more than once, but been told that doors were antithetical to the institute\u2019s brand.\n\u201cIt signifies openness,\u201d the director had said, smiling effulgently. It was a thin neuter with glossy hair and eyebrows that curled in elaborate patterns. Floral tattoos colored its pale brown skin, colored purple and blue that pulsed with the director\u2019s heartbeat. An expensive body-mod, one that signaled the director\u2019s financial status, in a way that Shi\u2019s Business professors would have approved of.\nIt didn\u2019t really matter how you presented, as long as it was costly enough to signal your status, they had said. You figured out a percentage of your budget\u2014were you maintaining or actually trying to get ahead? And of course there were other investments you could\u2014should\u2014make, but none of that mattered if it was a dead end job, being phased out, with no lateral shifts available, only downward, if you didn\u2019t have the initial dollars to invest. Time advances; adapt or be left behind.\nShi had put together a solid wardrobe a few years back but things were starting to fray. She caught the director eying her sleeve and folded her arms to hide the shirt\u2019s cuff.\n\u201cI have a new case for you,\u201d the director said, tone as pleasant as a pastel.\nRelief made Shi realize she\u2019d been holding herself stiffly upright in the director\u2019s presence. That means I\u2019ve made quota with still another week to go this month. Every month her clientele dwindled further, though. How will I manage when the inevitable moment comes and I fail to meet requirements three months in a row? She took a breath, and triggered calming agents in her bloodstream. They\u2019d give me six months severance. All I have to do is figure out how to best use it.\nThe director was saying something about the client\u2019s children. \u201cThey seem conflicted. They\u2019ve agreed to it, but only if you can help their mother be more than a dumbship. Remember our work enables an entire industry.\u201d They dropped a pad on her desk.\nThe director had transferable skills. And they were management. So they\u2019d be among the last to go.\nShe smiled at them and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d\nShi was currently female. She had chosen to present as an eleven-year-old girl, a slim, short shape that she had found disarmed most older people. Although there was a small percentage who found it off-putting. \u201cCreepy,\u201d one had called it, trying to explain the aversion. \u201cAn adult mind in a kid\u2019s body? You just know too much.\u201d\nShe\u2019d handed him off to another client. Most people were genderfluid, able to inhabit any sort of body, but changing was expensive. Not just the procedure, but maintenance, clothes, sometimes furniture and other necessities of life. More than just changing the uncomplicated pronoun to be used in day-to-day affairs or the much more complicated set to be used in intimate occasions, signaling sexual availability and preferences.\nThat was risky, establishing personal relationships manually. Easier to figure out what you wanted\u2014which you knew intimately after first establishing a profile scan and diagnostic discussion, and which might actually be the opposite of what you thought you wanted. Imagine being someone who didn\u2019t understand all of that internal stuff and just blundered along on gut feeling! The computers used DNA and personality tests and your social media presence and a barrage of other factors in order to figure things out, and while you could game the system by picking the right keywords, certainly, why would you ever want to do that and risk setting yourself up with a relationship that was doomed before it even started?\nIt might be different if you didn\u2019t have choices. But that battle had been fought decades ago. You had a right to your own body, to make it take whatever shape you wanted (and could afford). At the highest and lowest levels, they went \u201cnatural\u201d although at the high end of that it was a nature that was augmented with as much beneficial science as could possibly be crammed in a body without making it obvious.\nWhen the trio appeared in her door, she had the file open. Cianna Jones, age 98. The two adult children, Rick and Ruth, flanked their parent, who presented as an older woman. They had chosen to present genders themselves, one male, one female, though Shi wasn\u2019t sure whether it was by preference or to keep their parent more comfortable. Each held their mother by the arm, steering her.\nCianna herself seemed adrift, a fluff of feathery white hair and vague blue eyes. She had undergone some minor cosmetics, but for the most part she seemed unaltered, which often happened with older citizens, ones who might even remember the early part of the century and the old ways there, that primitive time that seemed so obsessed with sex.\nIntroductions were made by the children, while the mother smiled vaguely at Shi from the seat they had pushed and tugged her into.\nShi didn\u2019t address the group overall, though\u2014just her client. There were important formalities to be observed.\n\u201cYou understand why you are here?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI can have my mind wiped or else you can build me a palace,\u201d the woman murmured. Her voice carried a slight natural drawl, somewhere between southern and Midwestern, probably uncorrected natural rather than a mod. She smiled sleepily at Shi, and Shi wondered briefly if she were drunk or stoned.\n\u201cAfter a fashion, yes,\u201d Shi said. \u201cThat\u2019s one way people refer to them in the literature, mind palaces. It\u2019s the virtual reality best suited to you. You can fill them with all sorts of things. All of your past, and the places you never got to but always wanted to.\u201d\nShe projected a smile at the client, a barrage of white teeth intended to elicit confidence. But the smile that was returned was much harder to read. Did Ms. Jones actually understand what was happening? Shi eyed Rick and Ruth, sitting on the edges of their seats and occasionally shooting dagger-eyed glares at each other, before she continued.\n\u201cYour children don\u2019t want you to be a simple shipmind. That\u2019s where I come in. I teach you how to keep part of yourself separate. To that part, the conscious part, it\u2019ll feel like a life in virtual reality.\u201d She didn\u2019t add that the life depended on the quality of Cianna\u2019s mind, how well she could summon up details. Constructing a mind palace was a collaborative effort whose ineffectual results were another thing she hated about her job.\nBut, oh, the good ones, the well-realized ones . . . those were her only chance to experience the sort of thing you usually had to pay an arm and a leg\u2014sometimes literally\u2014for.\nCianna stared off into space. Shi looked again at the children.\n\u201cYour parent does understand what we are doing?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s measured .9 on the Sati meter,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cShe has been declared incapable of autonomy and this seemed best for her.\u201d She smirked at Rick.\nShi looked at him, his hands clasped anger-tight in front of tensed torso. \u201cYou\u2019re not comfortable with this decision?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only choice,\u201d he said stiffly. Shi sensed an echo in those words, that it was something that had been said to him over and over\u2014probably by his sibling\u2014until he was convinced by it. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want her to go if she can\u2019t . . . if she doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t, part of the time,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cShe has episodes. She harmed someone during one. Not for the first time.\u201d\nCianna stirred but Rick replied. \u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate. You\u2019re making a lot out of a couple of shoves.\u201d\n\u201cHuman beings,\u201d Ruth said primly, \u201cdon\u2019t resort to physical violence to get what they want. That sort of thing may have been in style when she was growing up, but it\u2019s outmoded now. So let her go off, into a place where she can\u2019t hurt anyone.\u201d The look she gave her mother said that \u201churt\u201d encompassed a great many things. \u201cThe money\u2019s great. I\u2019d volunteer for it myself if I could.\u201d\nThe automatic spiel spooled out of Shi\u2019s mouth. \u201cYounger brains like yours and mine\u2014the ones that have lived all their lives with shunts\u2014can\u2019t adapt to the technology. You and I can inhabit the mind palaces, but our autonomic systems don\u2019t interface with the system the way theirs do. We need them to drive the ships. To become them. That\u2019s why the price the institute pays is so high.\u201d She looked at Cianna again, trying to connect. \u201cYou\u2019re a precious commodity.\u201d\nThe mother sat silent, smiling vaguely, but something about the glitter of her eyes made Shi uneasy. Something off about the situation, something out of kilter in a way that she couldn\u2019t exactly define but definitely didn\u2019t like.\n\u201cYou can try,\u201d Rick said grudgingly. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk.\u201d\nIn the chamber, the waiting couch smelled damply of antiseptic, freshly swabbed and ready, the plastic a soothing pinkish-gray that always made Shi think of uterine flesh. Muraled walls, confluences of pink and gray spirals, gauzily drawn in tiny tiles against a beige background, boxed in the chamber. The light calculated to the last lumen to provide just enough illumination to soothe, watery sunlight sifted through new leaves.\nBuckles clicked into place as she strapped the older woman into the plastic couch, explaining as she went. They were quieter and more docile if they understood what was happening.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a brain scan,\u201d she said. \u201cIn building the palace, we\u2019ll use many of your memories, but we\u2019ll also correlate them with the physical record, all the existing photos and videos, and use those to make details perfect. Think of all the wonderful places that are gone and that you would like to return to. They\u2019ll all be back, there in your head, and you\u2019ll be able to spend as much time as you like in them.\u201d\nThe older woman made no response other than an acquiescent murmur. Was it odd for her to have an apparent child explaining the situation? Shi wished she had picked some different way to present for today. Once you had presented to a client, you were supposed to stay in that form, in order to give them a sense of security and continuity.\nNot to mention Shi couldn\u2019t afford it right now.\n\u201cIt will feel as though you\u2019re going to sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be, in a sense. Would you like me to explain the science behind it?\u201d\nCianna ignored her, stared off into space with an intensity that gave Shi pause. What was going on in the woman\u2019s head? She watched the face slacken as the machine took hold and Cianna\u2019s grip on consciousness was gently pried away, finger by finger, until she floated in the void, awaiting Shi.\nIt was always enjoyable, stepping into someone\u2019s inner landscape for the first time, but she could tell from the first second that this one would be extraordinary. It took a high level of sensitivity and imagination to create a mindworld like this one, surgical sharp and vivid, down to the smell of the tiny coral-colored tea roses around her feet, the feel of a sea breeze tickling her cheek as it came from a sweep of vast blue that footed a long green slope broken with a tiny red brick building, and an enormous tree (her infochip murmured madrona, identifying it) in the center.\nThis would be Cianna\u2019s core landscape. They differed from person to person, and usually you didn\u2019t know what yours was. Shi did. Hers was an enormous skyscraper, resembling the one she\u2019d grown up in, but with plenty of undiscovered halls leading in odd directions, and staircases of a kind that hadn\u2019t existed in the actual building, long crawls of cement stairs that led downward, never upward, towards some menace that lurked at the foot of things. She had learned by now to break those dreams, to turn around and say determinedly not real not real loud enough to shatter the world around her but she had never done what her training suggested she should do: dig farther into the meaning and extract it, learn something about herself that she should\u2014in theory\u2014know.\nIf you understood your internal workings, you were more in control of your life, able to compensate for your foibles, but Shi thought that she wanted to leave herself some level of unexplainable mystery, of moments where she wondered at the motivations of her unconscious, where it was unknown why she had lost her keys or had a particular piece of music playing in her head.\nWhy she wasn\u2019t preparing herself for the death of her profession. Cianna had to be one of the last. The competition was fierce. She\u2019d been lucky to get it, the director had implied. The fact that they had felt the need to tell her that was alarming, had implications. Social networks were more important than luck in government work. You had to have influence to get a high-end job, one that came with good accommodations, even some luxuries.\nShe walked down over springy, damp grass, covered with dewdrops that threw up scintillations of light, spangles of color that danced in the air around them. Shi had rarely witnessed such intensity of mind. She certainly couldn\u2019t think of any cases that had been stronger.\nCianna was there underneath the tree, but she didn\u2019t greet Shi as she appeared, turned her face away. She was humming, a tune that Shi didn\u2019t recognize, something slow and almost familiar.\n\u201cWon\u2019t you walk with me and tell me about things?\u201d Shi said, but the other woman didn\u2019t acknowledge her. Sometimes they weren\u2019t capable of it, but Shi thought that she was perceived, simply that Cianna chose not to speak to her.\nAnd that was interesting in itself, because that spoke of an internal determination\u2014perhaps even anger\u2014that belied the vague smiles. Was it possible that Cianna didn\u2019t want to retire to her memory palace? It would be\u2014surely\u2014a better existence than this one, with the two bickering children posing as adults.\nBut people resist change, inevitably, particularly the personalities that have throve in older times. A fading mindset. At some point all of the minds like this would be dead and they would have to turn to some other way to do it. Maybe Shi would be suited for that, but probably not. Nowadays the computers steered you into a particular career and while it might not be the one that you would have chosen for yourself, it would always turn out to be the one that you ended up sticking with, for one reason or another.\nShe set out. This initial session, she\u2019d be sampling Cianna\u2019s memories, building up an idea of what the ultimate structure would look like, how much it would hold. This brain would live for centuries, but it would always be confined by the limits of Shi\u2019s creation. Part of her job was to gauge how narrow its confines could be, and with brutal efficiency, build not a step more.\nSometimes that resulted in very small spaces indeed, depending on the type of mind. That one a few months ago had chosen a world the size of a couch, an endless coupling with a variety of partners and an algorithm designed to ensure that fresh choices would always be available. That seemed like a very circumscribed existence, and yet they had been happy enough with it. An eternity of good sex didn\u2019t sound all that bad, but you could achieve something very similar right now if you were willing to jack in.\nCyberlife was almost always more interesting than real life; it was designed to be, in a way that real life just wasn\u2019t. So much advertising science had gone into its design that it was deeply compelling and every year you heard horror stories about people plugging in and never being heard from again\u2014there was a brand of assisted suicide that specialized in it, in fact\u2014either go into the virtual reality and live there until your body starved or actually seek out your death inside it while a watching attendant threw the kill-switch at the right time.\nSome wealthy people lived that way by choice, though. Enabled by vivid minds, the minds of artists. Cianna was that sort of mind, but she was also compatible with one of the great transport ships that carried colonists outward, able to serve as its heart, its lungs, its guts, as well as the mind that drove it forward. Shi\u2019s job was only to prepare and reconcile her. It didn\u2019t matter what artistry might be lost in the process.\nTo the left, white two-story buildings, old ones, surrounding a quadrangle of more deep green grass, five deer grazing there. She marveled at the depth as she moved closer to them, at the fuzzy ears on the half-grown fawn, the way they twitched. She studied a deer as it scratched its neck with a hind-hoof, twisting around to do so. This sort of detail meant this was a childhood landscape, something seen for the first time, observed with the grave intensity of a curious child.\nShe went up a set of concrete steps, their edges eroded by time and weather\u2019s subtle grip, to the first house. She could see nothing through the windows, which were silvered by the sunlight coming from behind her. The wooden door swung inward, admitting her, when she knocked, and she stepped into a white-walled hallway, a woolen rug underneath her feet to soften the pine planking. At the end of the hall, a glimpse of kitchen, but to her right an archway into a parlor decorated with pine furniture and small candles along the red-brick fireplace.\nA girl and boy playing there. One would be Cianna. The other would probably be a sibling; she made a mental note to research them, taking a quick shot of the narrow, long-nosed face and the wealth of coal black curls, the thin quick smile and dark penstrokes of eyebrows. A beautiful boy, made even more beautiful by the particularly of the rendering. Cianna had an extraordinary mind, and surely that must make the memory palace even more appealing to her? The sort of world she could construct for this client would be the best that she\u2019d ever done, she thought. A masterwork, of the sort that got commissioned by the wealthiest of clients.\nBut they didn\u2019t have minds like Cianna.\nShe watched the children playing for a while before she moved along.\nShe drifted from house to house. Each held pieces of Cianna\u2019s life: a childhood in Shelbyville, Indiana, then a move to the east coast and Baltimore as a teen, then college at William & Mary. Ambitions for a job, thwarted or at least stifled by marriage to a high school sweetheart.\nNot the boy with the black curls, but he remained in every scene, some childhood friend that Cianna had managed to retain, unlike most. A constant, even up to the present day, she realized, catching a passage that smelled of yesterday, where the two stood talking. In this memory, Cianna was animated, lively, almost a voluble chatterbox. Shi expected a conversation about the memory palace process, but they didn\u2019t say a word about it, caught up in an argument that she didn\u2019t entirely understand, about a movie with an unexpected ending and whether or not it was possible to see it coming.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of red herrings,\u201d Cianna insisted, but the man, whose name she never spoke, laughed at her, saying it was more subtle.\nIt sounded a little like a meta-conversation, the sort of dream construction that can usually be peeled away into layers of meaning and signifiers, but though she listened for a few more minutes, she didn\u2019t know how to read it. Perhaps she\u2019d come back to this moment.\nAfter what felt like weeks, the hour timer on the machine dinged, and Shi pulled back, reluctantly, into the confines of her own head. She stretched and released Cianna from the machine, helping her stand up. The old woman\u2019s hand was warm and leathery, but she only touched Shi as long as she needed to in order to keep her balance, then let go with a hastiness that Shi thought bordered on distaste.\nShe said to Cianna, \u201cYou could challenge the competency hearing.\u201d Better to say it now, when there were no live recording devices and, if questioned, she could say that Cianna must have misunderstood her and heard what she wanted to hear.\nBut the old woman only blinked at her. Shi saw suspicion in the stare, and distrust. She said, \u201cYou have a remarkable mind. Surely it must . . . \u201d\n\u201cThe judge,\u201d the old woman said, speaking clearly and not at all as though she had been silent till this point, \u201cis a friend of Ruth\u2019s.\u201d\nThe implication was clear.\n\u201cAnother judge . . . ?\u201d Shi said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll only find another place to put me,\u201d the old woman said. She drooped as though suddenly tired, as though she had been walking along with Shi in the physical world. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to make them hate me so,\u201d she whispered to herself. \u201cI only tried to help them be all that they could be, and when they failed at that, they said it was all my fault.\u201d\nShi kept silent. She had looked at the records. She didn\u2019t like to be a bigot, but people who tended to keep a single gender often seemed to have other issues. Maybe she was misremembering or distorting that in her head, but it seemed true enough when she matched it against every client she had dealt with.\nShe was paid to analyze people, to understand why they did what they did, because it helped her construct alternate lives for them. Once this technology had been designed for nursing homes. Then the real breakthrough had come, and humanity realized how useful they were, these minds that were a diminishing quantity. Only a few more decades of them, perhaps, before that supply was exhausted by the depletions of time.\nBut she was not a family counselor, not trained to fix broken relationships. In fact, she\u2019d been encouraged to help make things worse if she could, in order to encourage the older person to abandon their children and their own lives, in order to take on the existence that she offered them.\nShe crossed to the poster in her office. A spaceship, a vast colony ship ready to take its slumbering, frozen cargo out into the universe, a ship driven by one of these minds, the consciousness wandering its memory palace, living out a thousand lifetimes, while the unconscious systems, the autonomic ones, drove the important parts of the ship, just as they had once driven blood and breathing and balance, all automatic and unthought of.\nYears of life . . . centuries, really. A body that was virtual, that never tired, that could instantly fly or change or whatever without tiresome surgeries or modifications. Who could resist something like that?\nNo, the old woman would like it. And Shi would make sure that she had a memory palace that would keep her happy. She wouldn\u2019t cut any corners with this one.\nShe sat down and began to mesh the memory notes with the other files, data pulled from all over, pictures, sound clips, video files, feelies.\nShe didn\u2019t notice the lack for a little while, but the data felt incomplete somehow. Then she realized. No sign of the black-haired boy, even in later years.\nHad he died recently perhaps? But there was yesterday\u2019s conversation. Odd.\nShe called the son. He answered without picture. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to track down the name of one of your mother\u2019s friends. Lifelong. A man her age, his hair once black, mostly silver now, dark hair, a little goatee?\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know anyone like that,\u201d he said with flat finality.\n\u201cBut they spoke together yesterday afternoon, for some time.\u201d\n\u201cYesterday she was at my house because my sister dumped her there. She spent the afternoon staring out the window, sipping chamomile tea, and eating crackers.\u201d\nShi was silent for a second, trying to understand. Finally she simply said, \u201cI must have misunderstood. I\u2019m sorry to have wasted your time.\u201d\nShe punched the call off and stared at the phone\u2019s numbers. The man was too vivid to be a delusion, surely. Was the old woman truly mad? But if there was some chemical or neurological imbalance, they would have discovered that already in the medical exams.\nBut she couldn\u2019t move forward until she knew what was happening. A mad shipbrain was prone to too much chaos, too much risk. Maybe Cianna\u2019s brain was unsuitable. She couldn\u2019t imagine either of the children being happy about it.\nShe couldn\u2019t move forward on this before she cleared it up.\nCianna\u2019s children did not agree. In private conference, Ruth came so far as to skirt the edges of bribery, mentioning considerations, perks, things that might come her way if only she could see her way clear to . . . then trailed off, leaving everything else unsaid.\n\u201cBoth of you must sign off, legally,\u201d Shi said. \u201cLet me see what I can construct, and if she\u2019ll adapt to it.\u201d\nAfter Ruth left, she pored through the files. She resorted to the government search, the one she, strictly speaking, was not supposed to have access to. Where was he? Who was he?\nAt night, staring up at the translucent ceiling tiles that showed murky moonlit clouds, she tried to fit her head around anything other than insanity. Conspiracies. Magic. Ghosts. Lost souls. Time travel. Alternate dimensions.\nBecause something about Cianna was so eminently sane, at the heart of it. Her mental landscape was so clear. Being in it was like being in a hyper-real version of the world. So alive.\nHow could insanity produce something like that?\nRequisitioning the brain exploration a second time was not unheard of but required special forms, part of her discretionary budget. Not something to be indulged in lightly and as a matter of fact, something that she\u2019d always taken pride in not doing.\nOnly Ruth came this time. She said to Shi, \u201cIs this really necessary? Why can\u2019t you just sign the forms?\u201d Her fingers twitched their way around each other; Shi saw with a twinge of pity that she\u2019d already gnawed through what looked like freshly grown nails, blue and purple stripes echoing her wrist-insets.\nLiterally eating at herself. What will happen when Cianna is out of the mix?\nShe touched mental triggers, making sure her face showed no sign of her emotions and said, selecting gentle reassurance, \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to wait in the relaxation room we have upstairs. There\u2019s a sunlight machine and several sound sculptures. Very pretty.\u201d\nThe hands writhing, worrying at a loose cuticle. Then heels trit-trotting away without another word.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to be kind to herself,\u201d Cianna said.\nThe words startled Shi. Cianna had been so silent that she\u2019d fallen into a beginner\u2019s trap, thinking her furniture rather than participant.\n\u201cWho is the man, the dark-haired man?\u201d she said.\nCianna\u2019s lips slackened, went quiet with an almost malicious twist.\n\u201cAsk him.\u201d\nAgain the green quadrangle, the madrona at one end, the slope bordered by cliffs overlooking the ocean. This hadn\u2019t appeared anywhere in Cianna\u2019s childhood. But it seemed so real, surely it must be based in some place that was just as actual? She fumbled through neurons for the name. Port Townsend.\nThis time she chose the little chapel down at one end. She couldn\u2019t remember if it had been there last time. Surely it must have been.\nThe world pressed in on her with maddening, dazzling intensity like noon sunlight at summer\u2019s peak. When she slipped inside the white-painted doorway, she breathed a sigh of relief.\nInside, another sycamore tree. No Cianna, only the boy, the same body-age as Shi, perhaps a little older, sprawled on the green grass in shorts and blue striped shirt, his eyes closed as though he were dozing.\nSomewhere someone was mowing grass. The sharp scent bit her inner nose as she moved forward towards the boy, the blades springy under her slippers.\nHe didn\u2019t move. She stepped beside him and knelt down, meaning to touch his shoulder.\nBut before she could do so, his eyes snapped open, dark and glaring at her.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nShe stumbled back, off balance, and fell on her ass in the green, that smell almost as overpowering as the external sunshine had been. As she thought external sunshine, the sunshine here intensified to match it. Her eyes watered. The boy, a little blurry, sat up.\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d she said.\n\u201cCall me Hypothetical,\u201d he said, and laughed. \u201cMaybe Hi for short.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not real,\u201d she said. That was the only possible explanation, but he seemed so animated. So three-dimensional.\n\u201cI\u2019m imaginary,\u201d he admitted. \u201cCianna thought it would confuse and delay things.\u201d\n\u201cIt did,\u201d Shi admitted. \u201cIt certainly did.\u201d She felt some tension drop away. It was not unusual for a candidate to resist the technology, and this was one of the cleverer attempts she had ever encountered. It must have taken a tremendous feat of imagination to strew this figure through the old woman\u2019s thoughts to the point where Shi had thought him real.\nShe settled herself into the grass, enjoying the warmth of the sunlight, letting her eyelids droop. How often in her life would she get to experience something on this level? A realer than real version of a vanished age of sunlight and personal space and uncontrolled green things.\nWhat would someone pay for this kind of experience? Artists at this level commanded more than she\u2019d make in a lifetime for a single performance. But her Sati rating meant she was incapable of making choices, except for that tiny part of her psyche that had been able to construct Hi.\nAnd Cianna\u2019s daughter wanted her gone, wanted her off-planet.\nBetter just to enjoy this while it lasted. \u201cShe gave it a good try,\u201d she said languidly. \u201cBut now we\u2019re over.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are, at any rate.\u201d\nHis hands closed around her throat.\nThere were net legends about this sort of thing, even a few movies. But the truth was, if you died in someone else\u2019s mind, you simply emerged back in real life, shuddering and gasping, to see Cianna looking at you with disappointment, eyes glittering in the dim light.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Shi said. \u201cYou said it yourself. They\u2019ll find somewhere to put you. Let me build you a wonderful palace to live in.\u201d\n\u201cRick won\u2019t let you do it.\u201d\n\u201cNot there, no. But nursing facilities are expensive. And it\u2019s similar technology, being plugged in when no one is visiting you. The ship\u2019s computer has thousands of times the processing power, though. You have to know what a gift you have. What it could be.\u201d\nCianna\u2019s face twisted, showing real emotion for the first time. \u201cThere has to be a way. A way that lets me stay real.\u201d\nHer voice was loud and shrill and hurt Shi\u2019s ears. This was naked emotion, unfiltered, unmuted, shocking in its exposure. In the 20th century people had hidden their flesh from exposure; in the 21st it was their minds. That was why appearance didn\u2019t matter.\nNo one wore their heart on their arm anymore\u2014was that how the old-fashioned expression had gone?\nShi\u2019s overrides were going up, otherwise her heart would have been racing. This was unpleasant, so unpleasant.\n\u201cYou want to shoot me into space,\u201d Cianna shouted. Shi could hear the rumbling of security coming, drawn by the noise. \u201cOut into space, all alone, nothing but zombies for company!\u201d\n\u201cThere are algorithms for randomness,\u201d Shi said. \u201cThe people will feel real to you. As real as your creation, at least.\u201d Her neck remembered his fingers, even though it had never felt that touch.\nSecurity bots in the room, columns and tentacles that paused at the sight of Cianna bound in the memory chair, screaming, swiveling to regard Shi.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not!\u201d Cianna screamed, and went on, high-pitched shrills of inarticulate rage until Shi pressed a console button and slid her into sedated silence.\n\u201cYour mother is more than capable of being plugged into the ship and staying herself,\u201d she told Rick. \u201cShe\u2019ll be happier.\u201d\nShi had called him before talking to Ruth. She knew what Ruth would say already.\n\u201cThe law trusts you and your sibling to make the right choice for her, or you wouldn\u2019t have been given the decision to make.\u201d\nHis head tilted from side to side, an uneasy, snakelike motion.\n\u201cShe has to agree,\u201d he finally said.\nA third excursion was unheard of. But within reach, if she was willing to expend every iota of social capital, every scrap of influence asking fellow employees to like her project on the internal boards, swapping away vacation days and perks, even part of her vacation pay. Depleted her.\nCost-benefit analysis allowed her to compute the odds but she had to shut off all emotions in order for the equation to make sense. Otherwise it kept inexplicably tipping, kept summoning up Cianna\u2019s indignant face, the drawn skin translucent as bone, but the eyes still alive, still full of purpose.\nShe filled herself with silent calm and re-evaluated a dispassionate formula. Yes.\nWind from the inland this time, sighing towards her full of pine. The deer were everywhere, as they always had been, nosing through blackberry vines with black tails flicking. Every house was deserted. She found Cianna alone, standing on the cement structure at the bluff\u2019s end: a former military embankment, the guns stripped away long ago, the cement fuzzed with emerald green moss and rusty lichen.\nShe climbed up the narrow stairs. The wind hurled itself against her.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go alone,\u201d she said. The wind slackened. Gulls hung overhead, wingtips wavering as they rode the wind. Cianna turned.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to branch. Make a recording of myself. It\u2019ll go with you. Live with you in the memory palace.\u201d\nCianna\u2019s nose wrinkled. \u201cA recording.\u201d\nShi reached for the handrail to haul herself up the last steps and move to lean against the concrete blocks. \u201cYou know how it works. I\u2019ll go with you. It\u2019ll be me. It\u2019s not cheap. I\u2019ll have to bribe someone to slip the recording in the ship but I\u2019ve got enough, I think.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s in your hands. This is the best I can do. You know sooner or later Ruth will have her way.\u201d\nAnd if the benefit of a lifetime, a retirement of the kind I\u2019ve never dared dreamed of, falls my way in the process, well, who does that hurt, really?\nShe continued, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be cruel, but do you want to stay here, neglected by your children? They don\u2019t want you. I do.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a choice. I don\u2019t. They say I legally can\u2019t make them.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll put you in the program, no matter what, yes. But if I help you\u2014if you let me help you\u2014you can prepare your mind, be more than just the thing that drives the ship. You\u2019ll remember who you are.\u201d\nThe wind whipped around them and a seagull wavered in the sky, a wispy cloud flowing to obscure then reveal then hide it again. Sunlight and windchill fought for supremacy on her uncovered skin and the dazzle on the waves made tears blur in her eyes as she swallowed against the earnest lump in her throat.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Cianna said, finally, wearily. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d\nShi woke slowly, swimming up through dream layers. She\u2019d been so tired when she\u2019d laid herself down to make the recording. She\u2019d worked nonstop, night and day, to build the memory palace, to fill it with more than one had ever held before, a world of possibilities. A life that she and Cianna could inhabit.\nShe looked forward to it. Her own parents had been distant. And it wouldn\u2019t be as though they had to continually interact if they turned out not to suit each other well. The world she had made from Cianna\u2019s imagination was her masterwork, full of details. How often did you get to build your own Paradise, almost literally?\nNow here she was, light seeping under her virtual eyelids. All around her the hyper-real, the beautiful world that would be her home for centuries . . . longer. A world of possibilities and wonder.\nShe opened her eyes.\nBut the tiles overhead were the same as always. She sagged back into the mattress.\nShe wasn\u2019t the recording. Only the original.\nStill left behind.\nCat Rambo lives, writes, and edits from atop a hill in the Pacific Northwest.

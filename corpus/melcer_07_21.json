I give her a stern look and keep counting.\n\u201c231\u201d my mother breathes the words out.\n\u201cFifteen seconds,\u201d I announce.\nA shadow crosses her face even as she puts on a satisfied smile.\n\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d my father says, holding her gaze.\nMy mother nods. Three more years and she can shift to teaching. She\u2019ll be safe there\u2014until, of course, the time comes for both of my parents to move. But that won\u2019t be for another twenty years, and for me, at seven, that could as well be forever.\n\u201cI got it at ten!\u201d my sister cries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my girl!\u201d Father lifts her and spins her around. Her laughter bubbles, louder and louder, till they are both a spinning, giggling pile of joy.\nI want to join them, but instead I go to hug mum. Maybe it\u2019s because, at seven years of age, I\u2019ve just put a name to the shadow that always hides under her smile, and I don\u2019t want her to be scared alone.\nMy sister will be a calculator, like our parents. Calculators are always needed. And yet, as I hear the fear in my mother\u2019s laughter, I know I must choose a different path.\nWe have only legends now for when our ancestors first saw the monster. They saw it shred light as it approached, then devoured whole worlds. They ran the calculations\u2014they still used machines for that, used machines for everything\u2014and they knew our rock world would not escape the hungry maw. They came up with a solution. It was insufficient, or too late, or both.\nBut we\u2019re still here.\nStill falling.\nOver the holidays, we go to see a show. The community hall is packed with families picnicking on the metal floor, voices high in expectation. Everyone stares at us\u2014two children in the family, and we don\u2019t even look like twins. I\u2019m used to the stares, but it\u2019s harder today, maybe because there are so many people here, so many puzzled eyes.\nMother told me once that in the old days, a machine could look into a womb and tell if you were expecting twins. But machines are extraneous mass, so we use people instead, because people are here anyway, always needing jobs to be useful. But people can\u2019t look into the womb, so they only listen, but they don\u2019t always hear right. I\u2019m not sure I understood what she meant, but I nodded along. Still, I\u2019m glad that doctor didn\u2019t hear right because I like being here, and I like my sister, too.\nThe lights dim, and the talker comes to the little stage in the center of the hall. She is a woman, I think, with skin so dark it\u2019s almost black. She puts on hats and coats, and changes voices so she sounds like a child or an old man, or a whole group of people talking all at once. The show is a familiar one, about Noah, the first engineer, and how no one would believe his warnings about the monster in the sky. (We still lived on a rock world then, so the talker has to explain what \u201csky\u201d means, but I\u2019m eight now so I know all about it.) My mouth falls open as I watch and listen, enthralled by the tale of Noah\u2019s struggle, his perseverance to build the ship and keep us safe.\nSoon everyone in the audience is sobbing, as the talker acts out the plight of young couples, traveling far and long in search of Noah\u2019s ship. We all laugh with the joy of finding their salvation, all our favorite couples boarding the ship one by one. They wave their last goodbyes, and the ship lifts off in the flurry of red flames. We clap, and the lights come on, and the talker is again just one woman standing on an empty stage with a red scarf in her hands.\nThe u-rating is the compromise we\u2019ve come to accept. There was no choice really, after the dark years.\nEvery adult starts life with ten points.\nFor each child, you lose a point. For every five years of your life, you lose a point.\nFor every ten years on your job, you gain points following the usability and performance rating.\nWhen you run out of points, you have to move.\nDown a ten, down a five. The further down-ring you go, the more points you reclaim.\nArithmetic runs our lives.\nAlways toward the bottom rings.\nAt ten, I\u2019m not yet a problem child; there are others still undecided, still searching for their path. But our time is running out. Teachers watch us with troubled faces, our class thinning as my friends shift to vocational classes.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d my sister asks when an opening comes for a cook. She\u2019s in her second year of calculator training, looking years older in the auxiliary\u2019s dark clothes, even though as my twin she is also just ten. She folds her arms and leans against the wall in a pose that is so like our mother\u2019s my eyes begin to sting.\nMum wants me to apply. Cook is a class one job, better than a calculator, an air-checker, or a doctor even. We\u2019ll never not need cooks.\nI shake my head, not quite meeting my sister\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . Not what I want to do.\u201d\nI brace myself, waiting for the accusations of selfishness, of pride, of being a lump of extraneous matter\u2014but it\u2019s my sister I\u2019m talking to. She understands, or at least she doesn\u2019t judge.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to choose something. And this is as good as it gets.\u201d\nI remember her spinning with our father, crying with laughter. Only three years ago. She sounds like an adult now.\nMy father\u2019s leaving now, going to visit my grandparents. They used to live three corridors down before they moved. I never see them anymore. I wanted to go with him, but mum won\u2019t let me. She cries most nights worrying about father going, even if it\u2019s just for two weeks.\nI wonder how her calculations are going, and how long before she can move to teaching.\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d I say.\nI do not apply.\nThat night, I dream of Noah.\nGravity.\nThat is all there is to it. But let\u2019s make it even simpler, pare it down to things that we can control:\nMass and distance, that\u2019s all that counts.\nDistance especially. For every step we slip away from the monster, its hold on us weakens. For every step or fall behind, its claws dig deeper into us.\nIf we lose two steps, no mass loss may save us.\nThere\u2019s an opening in engineering, the head teacher says, and my heart starts to beat faster. I\u2019d never considered engineering but now I can\u2019t get it out of my mind, even though I\u2019m not sure I know what it means. All I know is that it\u2019s in the first ring, and that they use machines and make our whole world run. They keep us from falling.\nI want to do that, too. Like Noah.\nThe teachers make me take tests, then more tests. Each time they seem surprised by my results, then I hear the word \u201cgifted\u201d and \u201ctwins\u201d and wonder if there was some other school, one I would have gone to if I didn\u2019t have a sister. Still, they must be satisfied, because three days later I join nine other children for an assessment.\nThe first ring is both identical and nothing like all the other rings.\nAs we emerge from the elevator, the ten of us wide-eyed and unsure whether we are more curious or terrified, we find ourselves inside a corridor just like those we have crossed all our lives. People hurry up and down, smiling or busy, most of the uniforms comfortingly familiar. But there are the other ones, too, the gloss-silver jackets you won\u2019t find anywhere else: engineering auxiliaries. The lights are brighter, too, and the floors softer, making our steps sound oddly muffled. Shiny squares glisten next to the doors we pass, but we move too fast to get a better look.\nWe follow the teachers in and out of rooms, trying to listen to their eager explanations. Even the teachers\u2019 voices are muffled here, subdued by the soft floors or the awareness of where we are. I try to memorize every detail as I trudge behind the others. At eleven, I\u2019m the oldest of the group, the one most teachers have given up hope for. I stand a head taller than the other kids, and they shy away from me as if I\u2019d bite.\nFinally, we enter a room unlike anything I have ever seen. Shining windows line all the walls; oddly-shaped tables fill the space within, each with one or two silver-clad engineers standing beside it. Everything beeps and hums, like the air ducts, only louder.\nThe children gasp; even our teachers fall into reverent silence. I want to gasp too, but there\u2019s too much to see, too much to understand to waste time on idle wonder. Maybe it\u2019s because I am older, or because I\u2019ve paid more attention to the talkers\u2019 tales of the old times, that I recognize the shining windows as computer screens and the tables as \u201cconsoles,\u201d or \u201cinter-heads,\u201d or something like that. So while my peers gawk and giggle, I take the time to make sense of the light show in front of me.\nIt takes a moment before I recognize the schematics. The black abyss, that\u2019s the monster. The white dot, that\u2019s us, our fragile orbit marked with flashing figures. Further out, wispy golden lines show the shroud of gas that surrounds us: our old sun, unraveled and spun again, remade into a barrier that keeps us in the monster\u2019s grasp. But there\u2019s something new in the image, something I haven\u2019t seen in my textbooks: lines of trajectories showing the monster\u2019s next meal: an entire world, white and yellow and orange, deformed as it starts to break apart.\nAs it starts to fall.\nI may be eleven, but I have had years of watching my parents and my sister in their calculator training. The numbers roll through my mind all on their own: mass and distance, distance and mass.\nBefore I know it, I am alone, having walked up to the main screen, my fists tight and my jaw clenched.\nNo, not alone: a man stands next to me, his hair white and his face ancient. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\nI look into his face, realizing that he knows what I know.\n\u201cMy father\u2019s visiting my grandparents,\u201d I whisper. \u201cIn . . . in the bottom ring.\u201d\nSomething like a disappointment crosses the man\u2019s face. \u201cIs that all you see?\u201d\nI look at the picture again, forcing myself to think only of numbers. Mass and distance, but distance most of all.\nOn the screen, the mass of the other world flashes in large red figures. It\u2019s far still, but already falling, the outer layers of its gaseous bulk joining the lines of our sun, and falling, falling, falling. Each gram of mass another line pulling us down.\nWe are balanced now, our speed just sufficient to turn the falling into orbiting\u2014but not with the extra mass.\nWe must keep the balance. We\u2019ll run the engines, of course. It won\u2019t be enough\u2014not unless we reduce our mass. And only if we do it soon enough.\nI\u2019m trembling as I look at the man. \u201cWe have a choice: one ring, if we do it now. Or we can wait a year and lose two rings.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your recommendation?\u201d\nI try not to think about my grandparents, about my father, about the ten thousand people and the year of life they could enjoy. Ten thousand now, or twenty thousand later. It\u2019s arithmetic.\n\u201cOne ring,\u201d I say. \u201cNo later than in five days.\u201d\nThe man nods. There\u2019s pain in his eyes, hiding just under the practiced determination. He reminds me of my mother. He is sad, too, I realize\u2014and somehow I know that the pain is for the ten thousand, but the sorrow is just for me, for the line I\u2019ve just crossed, my own event horizon from which there\u2019s no return.\nA word to the head teacher and a moment later we are ushered out, even before any of the other kids manage to ask a question.\nMy application is accepted.\nMy grandparents die the next day\u2014they and ten thousand others ejected with the bottom ring. My father makes it out in time after the ringmaster warns him away. But he never looks at me the same way again. My parents cry themselves to sleep that night, for my grandparents, and for me.\nTen days later I am transferred to the school in the first ring. I don\u2019t know it yet, but I will never see my parents again. But I can rest easy, knowing they will never have to move. A small perk for the engineers, lest anyone ever hesitate about killing their own.\nOur world is a funnel.\nWe capture as much as we can, matter and energy. We use the minimum we must; the rest goes to propulsion. Never enough.\nOur homes are rings on the side of the funnel, spinning and waiting, spinning and hoping.\nWe started with a hundred rings. We\u2019re down to sixty-three now.\nMy sister comes to visit me once, after graduation. I\u2019m twenty now, and a fully trained propulsion engineer.\n\u201cWhy propulsion?\u201d she asks.\nI shrug. \u201cWe need better engines.\u201d\nWhat I really want to say is, So we never have to lose another ring, not on my watch, but she knows that\u2014just as I know that what she\u2019s really asking is, What makes you think you\u2019ll succeed where all the others have failed?\nI have no answer to give her, nothing beyond that I have to try, but she knows that, too.\nInstead we busy ourselves with the walk through the first ring\u2019s recreational promenade, stopping to admire corner artists or watch a talker put on a show. It\u2019s odd with only adults in the audience, even though I\u2019m used to it now. Few engineers choose to have a child. They say they\u2019re too busy, but I\u2019ve been here long enough to know the truth. Our families are protected\u2014but only one generation. Our children would live to watch their own children move, or they\u2019d give away their points to protect them. You wouldn\u2019t wish that fate on anyone.\nI buy two cups of sweet jelly, one green and one red, our old favorites. My sister smiles, but she can\u2019t hide from me.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nShe considers a lie, but she\u2019s never been good at those. \u201cIt\u2019s this place. It\u2019s unnatural. The floors are too soft, you can\u2019t even hear yourself walk.\u201d\nI want to ask if it\u2019s me or seeing so many engineers. Everyone respects the engineers, but no one like the sight of us. We\u2019re the reminder of things best left unseen, the falling and the monster\u2019s maw waiting to devour yet another ring.\nShe reads right through me. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d She laughs, but her voice breaks. \u201cAll the machines. I\u2019m a grade one calculator, but I could never compete. No human can.\u201d\nI stop. \u201cDon\u2019t think that way. We need machines, here. The number of variables is too big, and the timing too critical. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve kept them here. Everywhere else, people are more than fine.\u201d\nShe looks at her feet. I haven\u2019t told her anything she doesn\u2019t know, nothing that would erase the worry of not being needed, losing her utility ranking, having to move . . .\nI put my hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou can\u2019t think that way. This ring, all of us, we are here for you. For the people. This ship is nothing without you. Hey, remember Noah? How his ship was ready, but he wouldn\u2019t leave? Not until every bench was filled? Because he didn\u2019t build it for himself, but for them.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she whispers.\nBut from now on, it\u2019s always I who goes down to visit.\nWe never talk about the dark years: the time when the reality settled in and we knew we\u2019d never escape, that we\u2019ll always be falling.\nI know there were riots, and inter-ring wars, and forced sterilizations.\nWe lost fifteen rings in the space of a year.\nSome say it was because those decks were empty.\nI\u2019m not sure this is true.\nI make senior engineer at thirty. The job comes with a u-rating so high I\u2019ll never run out of points.\nI receive my first full briefing from that same old man who nineteen years ago asked what I saw on the screens. The one who gave the order to eject the ring with my grandparents. He was right though, both of us were\u2014we outpaced the monster long enough to reach higher ground, a trajectory we have been able to maintain since. Nineteen years without loss of a single ring\u2014the longest time in history.\nNow he hands me a thick book with my name on it, one that will open only to my retinas.\n\u201cThe full specs of the ships,\u201d he says, his gray eyes buried in wrinkles but still as intense as on that first day.\n\u201cShips?\u201d\nHe nods. \u201cWe were not the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWere?\u201d\nThe shape of his smile tells me he\u2019s heard these same questions every time he\u2019s gone through the briefing. \u201cThere were twelve\u2014that we know of. More could have been launched later, though that\u2019s not very likely.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened? I\u2019ve seen no trace of them on the sensors.\u201d\nHe looks away. \u201cWe cut contact, sometime in the dark years. Everybody was too busy with their own troubles. And . . . We didn\u2019t really want to know, in case . . . \u201d\nI piece the facts together: things were tough in the dark years, tough and rough. It would have been the same for them. And if they didn\u2019t react in time, if the monster grabbed them\u2014that could have sent the rest of us into anarchy.\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I say, and he smiles in a way that tells me that I\u2019m missing something important. I want to ask, but he pats my shoulder and walks away, and it\u2019s the last time I ever see him. My colleagues tell me that he\u2019s retired, but I have to look the word up to even know what it means. No one retires here; we only move.\nYou can escape. Of course you can. The answer lies in the same equation: mass and distance.\nThe only way to gain distance is to lose mass.\nIf you lose enough of it, you\u2019ll be free.\nThe ship\u2019s manual is more than just that\u2014it\u2019s a living history, filled in with comments and diary entries of generations of engineers, starting from Noah, who wasn\u2019t even a Noah, but someone called Amira. I read every night, and even start adding my own notes, marking how things have changed since my predecessor.\nI don\u2019t know when the pieces fall into place and I realize what happened to the other ships.\nThey couldn\u2019t take it. The falling. The constant struggle to keep just out of the monster\u2019s claws. The anguish of giving the order, of watching ring after ring disappear into the darkness.\nThey ejected the rings and rushed away with just the top few.\nThey escaped.\nThis is why engineers don\u2019t have to move. Why the ship\u2019s specs are so tightly guarded. But now I know\u2014and I know, too, that we still could escape. Burn our way right through the shroud. The numbers pop into my head unbidden, crying out in my mother\u2019s voice and my sister\u2019s. Ten rings. We could keep ten rings.\nEject fifty-two, and we\u2019ll be free. A true escape, not just a delay. No more falling. No more scraping inches away from the edge. Not a single ring lost ever again.\nI cry myself to sleep that night, crying for the freedom I can almost taste, and for all the rings that will die, sooner or later\u2014but not by my hand.\nNever by my hand.\nWe\u2019ll always be losing rings, always offering our blood sacrifice. Because the monster keeps growing, sucking in matter from what remains of our sun and the planets in our system. And with each new meal it gets stronger, and its claws dig deeper into us.\nAnd yet we are holding.\nThe dark years, for all their horrors, helped.\nAll the deaths, all the lost rings. That\u2019s what allowed us to dig in and hold on.\nSince then, only once did we have to lose five rings in a single sacrifice.\nThat particular meal was called Saturn, I think.\nSometimes the monster eats them out of order.\nMy sister lives on the forty-second ring, in a tiny room next to the apartment where we all used to live. She\u2019s a senior calculator now and could afford much better, but she likes the old place, or so she tells me. I try to ask, but she just shakes her head, her lips pursing into a line that\u2019s so painfully familiar my breath catches in my chest.\n\u201cHow are they?\u201d I ask after a moment.\n\u201cYou should have gone to visit,\u201d she says instead.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want me to,\u201d I start, but then I really hear what she said. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nShe looks away, her mouth pressed shut with the effort of holding words that want to burst out. Just like when she calculated the numbers faster than mum. The memory wants to make me smile, but my sister\u2019s chin is trembling. Tears well in her eyes, then spill out, down her cheeks, on her hands, on my hands as I pull her close.\n\u201cTell me. Please.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve moved. They . . . They gave me their points.\u201d\nI stifle a gasp. Engineers\u2019 families are protected\u2014parents, spouses, children. Parents and spouses, really, as none of us have children. But not siblings. No one is supposed to have siblings, you see.\nThey chose for her life. I expected them to try\u2014I thought I\u2019d beat them to it.\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d\nShe looks away again, pain mixed with anger and guilt on her face. She hates me now, for not finding a way to stop them, hates our parents for making it, and hates herself most of all.\nPain I can\u2019t fight. Anger I can take. But not her guilt.\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d I repeat.\n\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d she whispers. And then, after a moment, \u201cWith twins.\u201d\nSomething erupts inside me. I lift her as high as I can and start to spin. She\u2019s crying still, but then she\u2019s laughing and we\u2019re both crying and laughing, and the world is great again.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything,\u201d I tell her after we collapse on the floor of her tiny room, drunk with laughter. \u201cThe ship\u2019s fine. We\u2019re fine. We have plenty of time.\u201d\nChoose your monster\u2014the one hiding in the darkness, or the one watching you from the mirror. It\u2019s your choice. Your decision.\nMy parents die of old age, my father first, then mother only weeks later. They die in peace, having hugged their grandchildren goodbye.\nI never saw them since the day I left home at eleven. I should have visited, no matter how much they hated my silver uniform. I waited too long, and after they moved it was no longer possible\u2014engineers aren\u2019t allowed on the bottom rings.\nStill, we wrote letters and talked on the comms each year on our birthday, all four of us, then six, once the grandchildren arrived. We were a family again.\nThey even thanked me for my work, said life in the bottom rings was peaceful like never before. I promised I\u2019d keep it that way.\nAnd, for a brief moment, I believed it.\nGhosts haunt the bottom ring.\nLiving, but not quite.\nKnowing their lives are over, and yet living. Sucking joy out of each moment. Laughing and dancing and telling tales.\nWaiting, most of all.\nAlways waiting.\nThere\u2019s three of us: a triumvirate of chief engineers, selected for our morals as much as our skills, tasked with watching the ship as much as each other. I see the truth in their eyes: they know, and they know that I know. We never speak of the facts, never mention the other ships, or our own chance of escape.\nUntil the day we get the news.\nA thin, sharp-boned technician delivers the message, her face pale as ash. A leak in one system causing the next one to misfire, causing another one to short . . . A chain of malfunctions, each insignificant, stringing together into a disaster.\nWe\u2019re about to lose an engine. One of the twelve that let us maintain our trajectory, keep us away from the monster.\nWe send her away with requests for more data, make it sound like we can imagine a solution. It\u2019s a lie. There is no solution, or at least none we can realize in time.\nWe sit in silence, eyes half-closed as each of us runs our own calculations. One moves to the screen, then another. We check the assumptions, confirm the tolerances. Then we are back, three of us around the small table, faces set and fists clenched tight.\n\u201cTen,\u201d I say, part of me surprised I still have a voice.\n\u201cTwo weeks,\u201d the second one says.\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d the third one finishes.\nThere\u2019s nothing more to say. Not later than two weeks from now, we will eject ten rings. A hundred thousand people will die.\nHalf a million will live.\nFor how long?\nOne of us lifts their head, another opens their mouth. We all know the words: You can escape. Keep ten rings, eject fifty-two. Forty-two, because the other ten are as good as gone already. And then we\u2019ll be free, all of those remaining, free from the monster and free from the pain, the anguish, the decisions. No engineer will have to make those choices, ever again.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cNever.\u201d\nNobody says anything anymore.\nYou can escape. Of course you can. The answer lies in the same equation: mass and distance. The only way to gain distance is to lose mass. If you lose enough of it, you\u2019ll be free.\nNEVER BY MY HAND\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the cube root of 12,326,391?\u201d the boy asks.\nMy sister blinks, her eyes losing focus the way they always do when she\u2019s working.\nI count the seconds.\nThe girl squeals and puffs her cheeks, fighting the urge to reveal the answer. The boy gives her a stern look.\n\u201c231\u201d my sister breathes the words out.\n\u201cFifteen seconds,\u201d I announce. \u201cPerfectly fine.\u201d\n\u201cI got it in ten!\u201d the girl cries.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my girl!\u201d I lift her and spin her around. The boy rushes to join us, then my sister. Their laughter bubbles, louder and louder, till we are all a spinning, giggling pile of joy.\nThey are still only twelve. Much too young. Much, much too young.\nThey\u2019ve lost their father already\u2014four years ago, when we lost those ten rings. But they\u2019ve had their mother, and me.\nAnd we were happy.\nAnd I thought we could always be. And that those ten rings would be the last in my lifetime.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be loved,\u201d I say as the children rush away to play and my sister\u2019s smile fades into sorrow. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll be safe. Forever.\u201d\nShe tries to nod. We\u2019ve chosen the fosters ourselves, selected the best, all the way from the sixth ring. And the engineers swore to look after them.\nWe\u2019ve given them our points, my sister and I. It\u2019s only fitting: twins to twins, blood to blood. Only fitting.\nReally, we couldn\u2019t hope for anything better.\nThere\u2019s a force stronger than gravity.\nAlas, it only acts on humans.\nIf it acted on ships, the four of us would have flown away.\nWe\u2019re back in the old apartment, our family home in the forty-second ring. My sister\u2019s crying now, her hand in mine and mine in hers. My face is dry. Not because I\u2019m strong, far from that. I\u2019m not half as strong as she. She would have stayed, would have kept on working, would have kept on falling.\nThe warning siren blares, once. The walls shake as the clamps release. We slide down, weightless, free, falling.\nI\u2019ve done all I could. The children are safe.\nI hold my sister tight. I couldn\u2019t have wished for a better life.\nWe are falling.\nTwo facts are contained in this statement:\nThe first: falling is a permanent condition, the truth of our past and present, and, for a brief moment still, the future.\nThe second you\u2019ll have to deduce for yourself."}

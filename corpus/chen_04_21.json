The data they beamed back informed us that the atmosphere was breathable without mechanical assistance, that the locals were one hundred percent vegetarian, and that their society had just recently developed matrilineal clan-based tribes. So we put on our extraterrestrial language hypnosis-learning headsets, climbed into our sleeping bags, and let autopilot complete our descent.\nWhich resulted in the spaceship crashing nose-first into the central square of a Lamoan village in a billow of black smoke. It was a group of locals who untangled us from our parachute brake, led by someone named Kaka, whose position in Earth terms would be chief of his clan. They even invited us to eat with them, to settle our nerves, once again proving the universal law that vegetarians were on the side of good; Old Liu\u2019s face had gone white with terror, and I wasn\u2019t much better.\nThe issue had been with the spaceship\u2019s thrust vector nozzle. Fortunately, all of Haier\u2019s products were made with standardized interchangeable parts, so repair wasn\u2019t too difficult.\nBut the impact of the landing damaged quite a few of the smaller electronics. The translator device was totaled; the hypnosis headsets gave out on us. Worst of all, the shock of the \u201cabnormal landing\u201d cost us the Lamoan language we\u2019d learned through the hypnosis headsets\u2014a severe enough emotional shock to the learner would cause subliminal impartation to lose effect. We had to relearn from scratch, like the human anthropologists of old.\nI hadn\u2019t tried learning a foreign language since I\u2019d left school; the effort gave me a huge headache. Old Liu, on the other hand, seemed to have much more of a knack for languages than I did. These days, he was already able to communicate with the locals through a combination of words and gestures.\nI hoped we could catch some K Beasts soon and return home to Earth. People said that a journey that started badly, ended badly. I believed a little in superstition.\nJuly 19th, 2089\nAs expected, things were going badly.\nThe buyer had told us that K Beasts had the ability to predict events up to twelve minutes into the future. As an interstellar beast-catcher with a couple years of experience, I\u2019d seen plenty of bizarre alien creatures, so I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. But I hadn\u2019t realized, this meant the K Beasts could predict our capture attempts.\n\u201cWhat do you think they want K Beasts for? To put them in a zoo? Do they look like Marilyn Monroe or something?\u201d Old Liu complained, after turning over the hundredth empty cage trap.\n\u201cAn animal that can predict twelve minutes into the future. Lots of uses for those.\u201d I waded into the underbrush to collect another trap. Huge swarms of Lamoan mosquitoes stirred at my approach; looking at their bodies shaped like little bomber planes, I was glad my blood wasn\u2019t to the taste of these extraterrestrial vampires. \u201cFor example, you can bring one with you as a bodyguard. If someone\u2019s going to snipe you from the shadows, it\u2019ll call out a warning. Or, you can train one like Pavlov\u2019s dogs, so that it\u2019ll drool if it senses that stocks are going to go down.\u201d\n\u201cWe should secretly keep one behind for ourselves, then. We\u2019d be rich.\u201d\n\u201cFirst we\u2019ll have to catch any K Beasts at all, pal. Use your brain, and come up with something. It\u2019s not long until the delivery date.\u201d\nOur original plan was simple. We just needed to lay out a feast laced with sleeping pills that took more than twelve minutes to take effect, and we\u2019d be able to catch some easy. But once they ate the bait, they grew unusually wary, and all of them hid away in concealed locations to snooze. K Beasts regarded ploys, traps, and tranquilizer darts with equal contempt. As professional interstellar beast-catchers, we\u2019d captured mammoths from Planet Tai and burrowing wolves nearly as intelligent as humans; we\u2019d successfully carried away an entire nest of Venusian wasps, with venom to rival a cobra\u2019s. But in front of K Beasts, capable of sensing any future threat, all our schemes came to nothing.\nI was really starting to feel at my wit\u2019s end.\nWe lugged our traps through a forest of blue fernlike plants with long bunches of translucent fruits hanging down from the frond tips. A small team of Lamoans carrying baskets was approaching, led by Kaka. We were already on familiar terms.\n\u201cDiligent laborers are admirable. Would you like one?\u201d Kaka handed me the largest fern-fruit in his basket.\n\u201cThanks, thanks. God protects those who labor all day,\u201d I answered clumsily. As per Lamoan custom, I bowed, chomped the fern-fruit in big bites, and presented the clean, bare pit to Kaka. He twitched his antennae in satisfaction and bade us farewell.\nThe harvesting team disappeared into the fern forest. We could dimly hear their singing.\n\u201cHurry. I need to get back to the ship for antidiarrheals. Next time it\u2019s your turn.\u201d I gritted my teeth and quickened my steps.\nOld Liu followed, enjoying my misfortune. \u201cWe have to respect the cultural customs of other planets. We must not hurt the feelings of the native inhabitants\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up.\u201d\nI felt a chill on my neck. It was raining again.\nMeanwhile, Old Liu quickly learned the locals\u2019 language. All day, he happily planted himself in the Lamoan village square, joining in on their religious ceremonies, recording dialogues that sounded like birds chirping. Every day when he came back onto the ship, he\u2019d sneeze like crazy; Lamoans considered getting rained on an exquisite pleasure and carrying a personal umbrella a breach of manners, while it was raining more and more frequently of late.\nI was starting to suspect that his interest in the Lamoans was far exceeding his interest in finishing our job. He used to be a researcher of interstellar folk customs, and when his scholarly passion surfaced, there was no stopping him.\nOf course, when I advised him to join me more often in the forests and increase our odds of capturing some K Beasts, he had a great excuse at the ready.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of learning Lamoan? We\u2019re supposed to be catching K Beasts,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you hoping some company will offer you a cushy translating job once Lamo\u2019s developed enough to trade with Earth? By that time, your grandchildren\u2019s grandchildren will be collecting pensions.\u201d\n\u201cLocals generally understand the native fauna better than anyone else,\u201d Old Liu informed me. \u201cI\u2019m hoping they can tell me more about the kasiyedos, their dietary habits, their role in the ecosystem . . . \u201d\n\u201cKasiyedos?\u201d\n\u201cThe K Beasts that we were talking about. Their Lamoan name means \u2018beast that comprehends the future.\u2019 Hey, did you know, every animal noun in Lamoan has a different prefix to distinguish between herbivores and carnivores, just like how French distinguishes between masculine and feminine\u2014\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cWhat I want to know is, do I or do I not need to put on bite-proof gloves to capture one?\u201d\nOld Liu laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, animals with names starting with ka- are all vegetarians.\u201d\nI, on the other hand, knew only three sentences\u2019 worth of Lamoan: \u201cGod protects those who labor all day.\u201d \u201cThe land accepts every drop of rain.\u201d \u201cNever meet.\u201d They were the equivalent of \u201cHello,\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d and \u201cBest wishes\u201d on Earth.\nOld Liu had to force me to memorize these, so that I could give the impression of a gentlemanly Earthling when I ran into a Lamoan.\n\u201cThe first one makes sense, hard work is glorious. The other one is probably because rain helps plants grow, which means bigger harvests. But don\u2019t you think the last one is strange? Never meet. It\u2019s like something you say when you break off contact with someone. But it\u2019s a fancy way to give your regards,\u201d Old Liu commented, after helping me correct my pronunciation.\nSigh, it looked like catching those K Beasts was going to take a while.\nAugust 1st, 2089\nIt was a sunny day, for once. I got out the tools to repair the ship. Old Liu leaned on the tail of the ship and passed me tools, but as before, he couldn\u2019t tell the difference between slotted and Phillips screwdrivers.\n\u201cThe key is figuring out how a K Beast predicts the future.\u201d He was trying to light a smoke in the thin, damp atmosphere of Lamo.\n\u201cPredicting is predicting. What does it matter?\u201d I\u2019d half climbed into the front hood of the spaceship. \u201cHey, hand me that triode, the red one.\u201d\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s a huge difference. Do they go to bed each night and dream about what happens the next day, or is it an instinctive response to impending danger? Maybe a series of images of the future flash in front of their eyes?\u201d\nI was getting a headache.\n\u201cThink about it: a K Beast can\u2019t have more than a hundred milliliters of brain volume. If the future contains infinite possibilities, it can\u2019t handle all of them, right?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d I angled the flashlight left and right. Where had the fourth screw gone?\n\u201cIn that case, would man\u2019s free will not be merely an illusion\u2014because the future is fixed? Or\u2014\u201d Old Liu sucked hard enough on his cigarette to make his eyes bulge, but the ember died anyway\u2014\u201cThe future has infinite branches, but the K Beast simply knows which path has been decided upon twelve minutes in advance?\u201d\nI ducked out of the spaceship repair hatch. \u201cEase up, Professor. They didn\u2019t put up a down payment for you to philosophize.\u201d\nOld Liu stuffed the cigarette back into his shirt pocket. \u201cRemember the timed traps we made before? I have an idea.\u201d\nThe timed traps were simple. You set an electronic timer, and once it hit zero, the cage would automatically lock. K Beasts were about the size of a Netherland Dwarf rabbit; when you weren\u2019t harboring dastardly intentions toward them, you could trip over one while walking in the forest. So we\u2019d filled the forest with these low-cost little traps. The Lamoans were neither curious nor opposed to our capture mission; their attitude toward K Beasts was something like Earthlings\u2019 attitude toward flies: annoying if there\u2019s too many of them, but if there\u2019s just a few, let them be.\nThe next day, when we checked the traps, we saw that none of the traps with the electronic timers set to less than twelve minutes had been touched. The K Beasts had curiously explored the insides of the cages set to longer than twelve minutes, casually depositing their blue droppings as they went.\nTo confirm this point, I reset the traps, with sneaky miniature cameras pointed straight at the cage doors. As expected, all the K Beasts who\u2019d ventured into the traps suddenly shot out of the cages twelve minutes before the exit would close, turning and emitting enraged I\u2019ve-seen-through-your-ploy squeaks before departing.\nThat was the only progress we\u2019d made after two weeks\u2019 work. With other capture methods, we couldn\u2019t even see the shadow of a K Beast. The Lamoans were happy to help, but when Old Liu asked about the K Beasts\u2019 behavior and eating habits, they\u2019d droop their antennae and walk away\u2014the equivalent of an Earthling shaking their head and shrugging.\nBack on the spaceship, I tested the launch procedure. Everything worked as normal.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your idea?\u201d\n\u201cYesterday, when you entered the forest with the tranquilizer gun, how did the K Beasts hide themselves away in time? They didn\u2019t really see themselves shot and captured. If the future is fixed, it wouldn\u2019t benefit the K Beasts to know their future ahead of time. So they only know about a possibility\u2014note, a possibility\u2014of danger. K Beasts avoid Future A and steer toward Future B.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that different from a normal organism\u2019s ability to plan ahead? We\u2019re all animals pursuing benefit and avoiding harm.\u201d\n\u201cBut K Beasts know. We just need to create a lot of uncertainty about the future, so they have no way to know. Let me think . . . have you practiced qigong before?\u201d\n\u201cGeez, what year is it? No wonder they call you Old Liu,\u201d I laughed, although in truth he was in his early thirties like me.\n\u201cThe most fundamental skill in learning qigong is to maintain a mind free of extraneous purpose. Like, a mind without any plans. If even we don\u2019t know when the cage door will shut, the future the K Beasts see will be a blur too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd with a mind free of extraneous purpose, a sudden flash of inspiration emerges, shutting the trap?\u201d I laughed so hard I nearly fell over.\nMaybe that could work.\nA random number generator took the place of the venerable monk that Old Liu had in mind. I watched the image relayed by the camera and explained, \u201cWhen the K Beast enters the cage\u2014it doesn\u2019t have any reason to be afraid, there\u2019s no time limit on the traps right now\u2014I\u2019ll activate the random number generator. When it generates a number that\u2019s odd and greater than one thousand, the cage door closes. How about that?\u201d\nOld Liu nodded. \u201cGreat. Every decision to open or close the trap is an independent event produced in less than a millisecond. I don\u2019t believe a K Beast can react that quickly.\u201d\nAll that remained was the wait.\nAugust 3rd, 2089\nLamo was a less massive planet than Earth, which made for especially big raindrops. They pinged and clattered against the ship\u2019s hull like a spray of bullets.\n\u201cWhat have you been discussing with the Lamoans lately?\u201d I propped my feet up on the control panel. On nine display screens, the fern fronds waved, the river rose, and the hymns of praise carried from the Lamoan village.\n\u201cThey\u2019re preparing for the arrival of the rainy season.\u201d\n\u201cStoring food?\u201d\n\u201cAnd making the next generation.\u201d Old Liu winked at me. \u201cThe rainy season is when the Lamoans reproduce. Haven\u2019t you felt the love in the air in the village lately?\u201d\nI vaguely remembered seeing several pairs of Lamoan youths beating each other bloody. Duels for affection?\n\u201cOh right, fun fact, you know what they thought of our spaceship landing that day?\u201d Old Liu laughed. \u201cBlack smoke is associated with demons. That\u2019s why they have you eat fern-fruit every time we meet. It\u2019s taken from the altar and used to dispel demons.\u201d\n\u201cYou spend all day in the village. How many of those have they stuffed you with?\u201d\n\u201cStrangely, they never invite me to eat them.\u201d Old Liu grew even more smug. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I regularly attend their sacred ceremonies.\u201d\nI grunted. \u201cStrange? I just think it\u2019s unfair.\u201d\nRain dripped. The display screens still weren\u2019t showing any sign of activity. My head grew heavier and heavier . . .\n\u201cHey, we caught them!\u201d Old Liu gave me a sudden shove and charged outside. I looked up. Almost every trap held a loudly squeaking K Beast. It worked!\nAugust 4th, 2089\n\u201cThey still won\u2019t eat,\u201d I told Old Liu.\nBut he didn\u2019t seem interested in listening to me. He dove straight for the bathroom.\nYesterday\u2019s activities had brought fourteen new tenants to the holding kennels. When we\u2019d inspected the traps, we\u2019d found that some of them held more than one K Beast. It was practically a miracle. For food, we\u2019d gotten heaps of fern-fruits\u2014in our secret nature recordings, fern-fruits definitely made up the main part of their diet. But so far, not a single K Beast had touched their food.\n\u201cToday they made me eat a whole pile of those things,\u201d Old Liu said mournfully, pulling up his pants as he emerged from the bathroom.\nI feigned sympathy. \u201cThat\u2019s how the Lamoans are sending off their Earthling friend? Did you all hug and cry?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring it up. But you\u2019ve got to admit, they\u2019re really lovely aliens, generous and kind.\u201d He walked up to the kennels. \u201cIt\u2019s normal enough for wild animals to not eat at first. They\u2019re very spirited.\u201d\n\u201cMore like aggravated,\u201d I said, shaking my bitten fingertips. \u201cWe\u2019re about to head back. If they refuse to eat in zero gravity, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll starve to death.\u201d\nOld Liu thought for a moment. \u201cCan you induce artificial hibernation?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cToo risky. We don\u2019t know the specifics of K Beast physiology. How about we wait a few days, until the K Beasts are eating properly, before we leave?\u201d\n\u201cWe have to head out today. The Lamoans told me that the rainy season proper starts tomorrow. Hurricane winds will blow for the next four months straight.\u201d\nI boggled. \u201cEven worse than the storms we\u2019ve already been having?\u201d\n\u201cWhen the real rainy season hits, even the Lamoans hide indoors.\u201d Old Liu sneezed. \u201cThey normally consider getting rained on to be like a sauna bath.\u201d\nI looked at the rare sunlight outside. \u201cOkay. Pack things up, and we\u2019ll head out today.\u201d\n\u201cEntering level two launch countdown, 1200, 1119, 1118 . . . \u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t get why they have to start the countdown twenty minutes in advance,\u201d Old Liu complained. Safety belts bound us to the seats like two mummies.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re bored, you can listen to the hypnosis headsets. I fixed them yesterday,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat edifying entertainment.\u201d He flailed an arm free to reach for the earphones. \u201cCan you bring up the original recordings we gathered through the language-collection equipment, from before we landed?\u201d\n\u201cPress the blue key.\u201d\nHe closed his eyes and fell silent.\n\u201c720, 719, 718 . . . \u201d\nThe K Beasts suddenly started to shriek frantically. The squeal of claws scraping against the metal cage made my head hurt. Twelve minutes left. Looked like they weren\u2019t a fan of takeoff.\n\u201c385, 384, 383 . . . \u201d\nI yanked over some earphones and put them on too. The K Beasts were driving themselves into a worse and worse frenzy. Hard to think that their little bodies could make so much noise.\nA Beach Boys song drowned out the K Beasts\u2019 screeching.\n\u201c21, 20, 19, 18 . . . \u201d\n\u201cCancel the launch! Hurry!\u201d Someone yanked out my earphones. The almost berserk cries of the K Beasts reverberated amid the computer\u2019s calm counting.\n\u201c13, 12, 11 . . . \u201d\nOld Liu shook me violently. \u201cThere\u2019s no time, hurry and abort the launch sequence!\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I tried to struggle free of the safety belts.\nHe turned to the control panel. \u201cWhich key?\u201d\n\u201c9, 8, 7 . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhich key?!\u201d He was close to tears.\n\u201cRight side, the long green one,\u201d I answered. \u201cJust what is\u2014\u201d\n\u201c4, 3, 2\u2014launch sequence emergency aborted. Repeat, launch sequence emergency aborted.\u201d\nOld Liu plopped butt-first onto the floor, looking dazed. Then he started to laugh. \u201cGod, we were one second away. You have no idea, we were one second away.\u201d\nI\u2019d finally wormed free of the safety belts. Confused, I said, \u201cJust what was going on?\u201d\n\u201cWe dodged death.\u201d He was laughing so hard he was crying.\n\u201cLord in heaven,\u201d I sighed, after digging out a dozen or so fern-fruits from the spaceship exhaust pipes. \u201cJam-packed in there. Do you still think they\u2019re generous and kind?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe too kind,\u201d said Old Liu, shaking his head. \u201cI realized when I heard them calling the K Beasts mausiyedos in the recording.\u201d\n\u201cSorry, can you please explain in human language?\u201d I said, rolling my eyes.\n\u201cWhen we landed, Lamo was still in the tail end of the first rainy season. Their conversations were full of gendered words. But in the two weeks I talked with them, those prefixes had all disappeared, leaving only the bare root words.\u201d\n\u201cYou said earlier that the rainy season is when the Lamoans reproduce?\u201d I was starting to understand.\n\u201cNot just the Lamoans. The K Beasts too. And the K Beasts\u2019 rainy season name is mausiyedos, mau- representing a scavenger.\u201d\n\u201cScavenger?\u201d I felt a wave of disgust. \u201cThey eat corpses?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s common for animals to change their eating habits during their reproductive season.\u201d Old Liu found half a cigarette from his shirt pocket. \u201cBut they also have powers of precognition. I reconsidered the question of the twelve-minute time limit. K Beasts know what they\u2019ll know twelve minutes in the future. That means there\u2019s no range on the limit of their precognition. It\u2019s just that the future they see will grow more and more uncertain.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t sure what \u201cknowing what they\u2019ll know twelve minutes in the future\u201d meant.\n\u201cImagine, you\u2019ve aimed a spyglass at a mountaintop twelve kilometers away and can clearly see everything. And that mountain has another spyglass atop it, so through it you can see the view twenty-four kilometers away. So on and so forth. It\u2019s just that the quality of the image will steadily decrease.\u201d He snapped off the front end of the cigarette. \u201cWhat happened, it\u2019s all wet. Or you can use a game of telephone as an example.\u201d\n\u201cNo need, no need, the analogy might be terrible, but I get it,\u201d I said hurriedly.\n\u201cNow I know the meaning behind that phrase, \u2018never meet.\u2019 If a Lamoan meets a K Beast in the rainy season, it means they\u2019ll die soon. To them, a K Beast is the ultimate inauspicious animal, a harbinger of death, so normally they don\u2019t even want to bring them up in conversation.\u201d Old Liu grinned. \u201cAnd we were spending all day trying to catch these critters. To them, we must have seemed possessed.\u201d\n\u201cSo stuffing the exhaust pipes is a form of exorcism?\u201d I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\nHe shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s our fault for spewing that much black smoke when we landed. The Lamoans must have thought the demons lived in the exhaust pipe.\u201d\nI walked in a circuit around the ship. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any more problems, right? They couldn\u2019t have drawn magic spells on the circuit boards.\u201d\n\u201cLet the computer run the countdown again. If the K Beasts don\u2019t go nuts at seven hundred and twenty seconds, we\u2019re safe.\u201d\nOld Liu gazed out the porthole. I followed his gaze. Dark clouds were gathering on the horizon.\n\u201c723, 722, 721, 720, 719 . . . \u201d\nThe K Beasts were silent, as if sleeping.\nI let go of a breath. Suddenly a thought struck me. \u201cOld Liu!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe random number generator wasn\u2019t how we caught the K Beasts! They let themselves be caught, because they knew we were going to die!\u201d\n\u201cSo you just realized.\u201d\nEven though I couldn\u2019t move in the straps, I could still sense the smug expression on his face.\n\u201cThe Lamoans plugged the exhaust pipes because we\u2019d caught the K Beasts, which nearly caused us to die. But the K Beasts let themselves be trapped because we were going to die. Hey, but which is the cause and which is the effect?\u201d\n\u201cEase up, Professor. They didn\u2019t put up a down payment for you to philosophize.\u201d This time, I\u2019d handed Old Liu a great opportunity to make fun of me.\n\u201c78, 77, 76 . . . 3, 2, 1, takeoff.\u201d\nOutside the porthole, Planet Lamo receded, becoming one speck amid the stars.\n\u201cHang on.\u201d I had a new question. \u201cIf the K Beasts knew the spaceship was going to explode, why would they let themselves be trapped aboard it?\u201d\n\u201cYou might as well ask why salmon migrate back upstream.\u201d Old Liu unbuckled his straps and floated up. He found some artificial chicken in the fridge and tossed it into the kennel, where the K Beasts immediately attacked it. \u201cFor the sake of propagating their offspring, these K Beasts risked everything to get close to a food source\u2014you and me.\u201d He gave me a wink. \u201cMagnificent maternal love in action.\u201d\nOriginally published in Chinese in Science Fiction King, December 2017.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nBorn in China and raised in the United States, Carmen Yiling Yan was first driven to translation in high school by the pain of reading really good stories and being unable to share them.

There was nothing wrong with Korais except that he was the fangmoth\u2019s Doctrine officer, and even then he was reasonable for a Rahal. Nevertheless, Doctrine observed remembrances with the ranking officer, which meant that Jedao had to make sure he didn\u2019t fall over.\n Next time, Jedao thought, wishing the painkillers worked better, I have to get myself assassinated on a planet where they do the job right.\n The assassin had been a Lanterner, and she had used a shattergun. She had caught him at a conference, of all places. The shattergun had almost sharded Jedao into a hundred hundred pieces of ghostwrack. Now, when Jedao looked at the icelight that served as a meditation focus, he saw anywhere from three to eight of them. The effect would have been charming if it hadn\u2019t been accompanied by stabbing pains in his head.\n Korais was speaking to him.\n \u201cSay again?\u201d Jedao said. He kept from looking at his wristwatch.\n \u201cI\u2019ll recite the next verses for you, sir, if that doesn\u2019t offend you,\u201d Korais said.\n Korais was being diplomatic. Jedao couldn\u2019t remember where in the litany they were. Under better circumstances he would have claimed that he was distracted by the fact that his force of eleven fangmoths was being pursued by the Lanterners who had mauled the rest of the swarm, but it came down to the injuries.\n \u201cI\u2019d be much obliged, Captain,\u201d Jedao said.\n This remembrance was called the Feast of Drownings. The Rahal heptarch, whose faction maintained the high calendar and who set Doctrine, had declared it three years back, in response to a heresy in one of the heptarchate\u2019s larger marches. Jedao would have called the heresy a benign one. People who wanted the freedom to build shrines to their ancestors, for pity\u2019s sake. But the Rahal had claimed that this would upset the high calendar\u2019s master equations, and so the heretics had had to be put down.\n There were worse ways to die than by having your lungs slowly filled with caustic fluid. That still didn\u2019t make it a good way to die.\n Korais had begun his recital. Jedao looked at the icelight on the table in front of them. It had translucent lobes and bronchi and alveoli, and light trickled downward through them like fluid, pale and blue and inexorable.\n The heptarchate\u2019s exotic technologies depended on the high calendar\u2019s configurations: the numerical concordances, the feasts and remembrances, the associated system of belief. The mothdrive that permitted fast travel between star systems was an exotic technology. Few people advocated a switch in calendars. Too much would have to be given up, and invariant technologies, which worked under any calendar, never seemed to keep up. Besides, any new calendar would be subject to the same problem of lock-in; any new calendar would be regulated by the Rahal, or by people like the Rahal, as rigorously as the current one.\n It was a facile argument, and one that Jedao had always disliked.\n \u201cSir,\u201d Korais said, breaking off at the end of a phrase, \u201cyou should sit.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be standing for this,\u201d Jedao said dryly.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think your meditations during the next nineteen minutes are going to help if you fall unconscious.\u201d\n He must look awful if Doctrine was telling him how long until the ordeal was over. Not that he was going to rest afterward. He had to figure out what to do about the Lanterners.\n It wasn\u2019t that Jedao minded being recalled from medical leave to fight a battle. It wasn\u2019t even that he minded being handed this sad force of eleven fangmoths, whose morale was shredded after General Kel Najhera had gotten herself killed. It was that the heptarchate had kept the Lanterners as clients for as long as he remembered. Now the Lanterners were demanding regional representation, and they were at war with the heptarchate.\n The Lanterner assassin had targeted Jedao during the Feast of Falcon\u2019s Eye. If she had succeeded, the event would have spiked the high calendar in the Lanterners\u2019 favor. Then they would have declared a remembrance in their own, competing calendar. The irony was that Jedao wasn\u2019t sure he disagreed with the Lanterners\u2019 grievances against the heptarchate, which they had broadcast everywhere after their victory over Najhera.\n Korais was still looking at him. Jedao went to sit down, which was difficult because walking in a straight line took all of his concentration. Sitting down also took concentration. It wasn\u2019t worth pretending that he heard the last remembrance verses.\n \u201cIt\u2019s over, sir,\u201d Korais said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your duties.\u201d He saluted and let himself out.\n Jedao looked at his watch after the door hissed shut. Everything on it was too tiny to read the way his vision was. He made his computer enlarge its time display. Korais had left at least seven minutes early, an astonishing concession considering his job.\n Jedao waited until the latest wave of pain receded, then brought up a visual of Candle Arc, a battledrift site nine days out from their present position and eleven days out from the Lanterners\u2019 last reported position. The battle had taken place 177 years ago, between two powers that had since been conquered. The heptarchate called the battle Candle Arc because of the bridge of lights that wheeled through the scatter-hell of what had once been a fortress built from desiccated suns, and the remnants of warmoths. The two powers probably had called their battle something else, and their moths wouldn\u2019t have been called moths either, and their calendars were dead except in records held locked by the Rahal.\n Some genius had done up the image in shades of Kel gold, even though a notation gave the spectrum shift for anyone who cared. Jedao was fond of the Kel, who were the heptarchate\u2019s military faction. For nearly twenty years he had been seconded to their service, and they had many virtues, but their taste in ornamentation was gaudy. Their faction emblem was the ashhawk, the bird that burned in its own glory, all fire and ferocity. The Shuos emblem was the ninefox, shapeshifter and trickster. The Kel called him the fox general, but they weren\u2019t always being complimentary.\n The bridgelights swam in and out of focus. Damnation. This was going to take forever. After pulling up maps of the calendrical terrain, he got the computer algebra system to tell him what the estimated shifts looked like in pictures. Then he sent a summons to the moth commander.\n He knew how long it took to get from the moth\u2019s command center to his quarters. The door chimed at him with commendable promptness.\n \u201cCome in,\u201d Jedao said.\n The door opened. \u201cYou wished to see me, sir,\u201d said Kel Menowen, commander of the Fortune Travels in Fours. She was a stocky woman with swan-black hair and unsmiling eyes. Like all Kel, she wore black gloves; Jedao himself wore fingerless gloves. Her salute was so correct that he wanted to find an imperfection in her fist, or the angle of her arm.\n Jedao had chosen the Fortune as his command moth not because it was the least damaged after Najhera\u2019s death, which it wasn\u2019t, but because Menowen had a grudge against the Shuos. She was going to be the hardest commander to win over, so he wanted to do it in person.\n The tired joke about the Kel was that they were strong, loyal, and stupid, although they weren\u2019t any more prone to stupidity than the other factions.\n The tired joke about the Shuos, who specialized in information operations, was that they had backstabbing quotas. Most of the other factions had reasonable succession policies for their heptarchs. The Rahal heptarch appointed a successor from one of the senior magistrates. With the Kel, it was rank and seniority. The Shuos policy was that if you could keep the heptarch\u2019s seat, it was yours. The other tired joke was that the infighting was the only reason the Shuos weren\u2019t running the heptarchate.\n One of Menowen\u2019s aunts had died in a Shuos scheme, an assassin getting careless with secondary casualties. Jedao had already been in Kel service at the time, but it was in his public record that he had once been Shuos infantry, where \u201cShuos infantry\u201d was a euphemism for \u201cprobably an assassin.\u201d In his case, he had been a very good assassin.\n Menowen was still standing there. Jedao approximated a return salute. \u201cAt ease,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d stand, but \u2019up\u2019 and \u2019down\u2019 are difficult concepts, which is distressing when you have to think in three dimensions.\u201d\n Menowen\u2019s version of at ease looked stiff. \u201cWhat do you require, sir?\u201d\n They had exchanged few words since he boarded her moth because he had barely been functional. She wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew he was on her moth to make sure she behaved, and he had no doubt her behavior would be exemplary. She also probably wanted to know what the plan was.\n \u201cWhat do you think I require?\u201d Jedao asked. Sometimes it helped to be direct.\n Menowen\u2019s posture became more stiff. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t escaped my notice that you only gave move orders as far as the Haussen system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that won\u2019t take us near any useful support, and I thought our orders were to retreat.\u201d She was overenunciating on top of telling him things he knew, which meant that at some point she was going to tell him he wasn\u2019t fit for duty. Some Kel knew how to do subtlety. Menowen had an excellent service record, but she didn\u2019t strike him as a subtle Kel.\n \u201cYou\u2019re reading the sane, sensible thing into our orders,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cKel Command was explicit. They didn\u2019t use the word \u2019retreat\u2019 anywhere.\u201d An interesting oversight on their part. The orders had directed him to ensure that the border shell guarding the Glover Marches was secured by any means possible.\n \u201cRetreat is the only logical response,\u201d Menowen said. \u201cCatch repairs if possible, link up with Twin Axes.\u201d The Twin Axes swarm was on patrol along the Taurag border, and was the nearest Kel force of any size. \u201cThen we\u2019d have a chance against the heretics.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re discounting some alternatives,\u201d Jedao said.\n Menowen lifted her chin and glared at him, or possibly at his insignia, or at the ink painting over his shoulder. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re contemplating fighting them with our present resources\u2014\u201d She stopped, tried again. The second try was blunter. \u201cYour injuries have impaired your judgment and you ought to\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014let the senior moth commander make the sane, sensible decision to run for help?\u201d Jedao flexed his hands. He had a clear memory of an earlier conversation with Commander Kel Chau, specifically the pinched look around Chau\u2019s eyes. Chau probably thought running was an excellent idea. \u201cI had considered it. But it\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019ve looked at the calendrical terrain. We can win this.\u201d\n Menowen was having a Kel moment. She wanted to tell him off, but it wasn\u2019t just that he outranked her, it was that Kel Command had pulled him off medical leave to put him in charge, instead of evacuating him from the front. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cI was there. The Lanterners have a swarm of at least sixty moths. They will have reinforcements. I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you any of this.\u201d\n \u201cHow conscientious of you,\u201d Jedao said. Her eyes narrowed, but she didn\u2019t take the bait. \u201cDid you think I had some notion of slugging it out toe-to-toe? That would be stupid. But I have been reviewing the records, and I understand the Lanterner general\u2019s temperament. Which is how we\u2019re going to defeat the enemy, unless you defeat yourself before they have a chance to.\u201d\n Menowen\u2019s mouth pressed thin. \u201cI understand you have never lost a battle,\u201d she said.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t the\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIf it\u2019s about your fucking reputation\u2014\u201d\n \u201cFox and hound, not this whole thing again,\u201d Jedao snapped. Which was unfair of him because it was her first time bringing it up, even if everyone else did. \u201cSooner or later everyone loses. I get it. If it made more sense to stop the Lanterners in the Glovers, I\u2019d be doing it.\u201d This would also mean ceding vast swathes of territory to them, not anyone\u2019s first choice; from her grim expression, she understood that. \u201cIf I could stop the Lanterners by calling them up for a game of cards, I\u2019d do that too. Or by, I don\u2019t know, offering them my right arm. But I\u2019m telling you, this can be done, and I am not quitting if there\u2019s a chance. Am I going to have to fight you to prove it?\u201d\n This wasn\u2019t an idle threat. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time he had dueled a Kel, although it would be frivolous to force a moth commander into a duel, however non-lethal, at a time like this.\n Menowen looked pained. \u201cSir, you\u2019re wounded.\u201d\n He could think of any number of ways to kill her before she realized she was being attacked, even in his present condition, but most of them depended on her trust that her commanding officer wouldn\u2019t pull such a stunt.\n \u201cWe can do this,\u201d Jedao said. He was going to have to give this speech to the other ten moth commanders, who were jumpy right now. Might as well get in practice now. \u201cAll the way to the Haussen system, it looks like we\u2019re doing the reasonable thing. But we\u2019re going to pay a call on the Rahal outpost at Smokewatch 33-67.\u201d That wasn\u2019t going to be a fun conversation, but most Rahal were responsive to arguments that involved preserving their beloved calendar. And right now, he was the only one in position to stop the Lanterners from arrowing right up to the Glover Marches. The perfect battle record that people liked to bludgeon him over the head with might even come in handy for persuasion.\n \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d Menowen said in an unpromising voice.\n It was good, if inconvenient, when a Kel thought for herself. Unlike a number of the officers on this moth, Menowen didn\u2019t react to Jedao like a cadet fledge.\n \u201cTwo things,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cFirst, I know remembering the defeat is painful, but if I\u2019m reading the records correctly, the first eight Kel moths to go down, practically simultaneously, included two scoutmoths.\u201d\n \u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d Menowen said. She wasn\u2019t overenunciating anymore. \u201cThe Lanterners\u2019 mothdrive formants were distorted just enough to throw our scan sweep, so they saw us first.\u201d\n \u201cWhy would they waste time killing scoutmoths when they could blow up fangmoths or arrowmoths instead? If you look at their positions and ours, they had better available targets.\u201d He had to be careful about criticizing a dead general, but there was no avoiding it. Najhera had depended too much on exotics and hadn\u2019t made adequate use of invariant defenses. The Kel also hadn\u2019t had time to channel any useful formation effects, their specialty. \u201cThe scoutmoths weren\u2019t out far enough to give advance notice, and surprise was blown once the Lanterners fried those eight moths. What I\u2019m getting at is that our scan may not be able to tell the difference between mothdrives on big scary things and mothdrives on mediocre insignificant things, but their scan can\u2019t either, or they would have picked better targets.\u201d\n Menowen was starting to look persuaded. \u201cWhat are you going to do, sir? Commandeer civilian moths and set them to blow?\u201d She wasn\u2019t able to hide her distaste for the idea.\n \u201cI\u2019d prefer to avoid involving civilians,\u201d Jedao said coolly. Her unsmiling eyes became a little less unsmiling when he said that. \u201cThe Rahal run the show, they can damn well spare me some engines glued to tin cans.\u201d\n The pain hit him like a spike to the eyes. When he could see again, Menowen was frowning. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cone thing and I\u2019ll let you continue your deliberations in private.\u201d This was Kel for please get some fucking rest before you embarrass us by falling over. \u201cYou had some specific plan for punching holes into the Lanterners?\u201d\n \u201cModulo the fact that something always goes wrong after you wave hello at the enemy? Yes.\u201d\n \u201cThat will do it for me, sir,\u201d Menowen said. \u201cNot that I have a choice in the matter.\u201d\n \u201cYou always have a choice,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that most of them are bad.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t look as though she understood, but he hadn\u2019t expected her to.\n Jedao would have authorized more time for repairs if he could, but they kept receiving reports on the Lanterners\u2019 movements and time was one of the things they had little of. He addressed his moth commanders on the subject to reassure them that he understood their misgivings. Thankfully, Kel discipline held.\n For that matter, Jedao didn\u2019t like detouring to Smokewatch 33-67 afterward, but he needed a lure, and this was the best place to get it. The conversation with the Rahal magistrate in charge almost wasn\u2019t a conversation. Jedao felt as though he was navigating through a menu of options rather than interacting with a human being. Some of the Rahal liked to cultivate that effect. At least Rahal Korais wasn\u2019t one of them.\n \u201cThis is an unusual request for critical Rahal resources, General,\u201d the magistrate was saying.\n This wasn\u2019t a no, so Jedao was already ahead. \u201cThe calendrical lenses are the best tool available,\u201d he said. \u201cI will need seventy-three of them.\u201d\n Calendrical lenses were Doctrine instruments mounted on mothdrives. Their sole purpose was to focus the high calendar in contested areas. It was a better idea in theory than practice, since radical heresies rapidly knocked them out of alignment, but the Rahal bureaucracy was attached to them. Typical Rahal, trusting an idea over cold hard experience. At least there were plenty of the things, and the mothdrives ought to be powerful enough to pass on scan from a distance.\n Seventy-three was crucial because there were seventy-three moths in the Kel\u2019s Twin Axes swarm. The swarm was the key to the lure, just not in the way that Commander Menowen would have liked. It was barely possible, if Twin Axes set out from the Taurag border within a couple days\u2019 word of Najhera\u2019s defeat, for it to reach Candle Arc when Jedao planned on being there. It would also be inadvisable for Twin Axes to do so, because their purpose was to prevent the Taurags from contesting that border. Twin Axes wouldn\u2019t leave such a gap in heptarchate defenses without direct orders from Kel Command.\n However, no one had expected the Lanterners to go heretical so suddenly. Kel Command had been known to panic, especially under Rahal pressure. And Rahal pressure was going to be strong after Najhera\u2019s defeat.\n \u201cDo you expect the lens vessels to be combat-capable?\u201d the magistrate asked without any trace of sarcasm.\n \u201cI need them to sit there and look pretty in imitation of a Kel formation,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cThey\u2019ll get the heretics\u2019 attention, and if they can shift some of the calendrical terrain in our favor, even better.\u201d Unlikely, he\u2019d had the Kel run the numbers for him, but it sounded nice. \u201cAre volunteers available?\u201d\n Also unlikely. The advantage of going to the Rahal rather than some other faction, besides their susceptibility to the plea, was that the Rahal were disciplined. Even if they weren\u2019t going to be volunteers. If he gave instructions, the instructions would be rigorously carried out.\n The magistrate raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m aware of your skill at tactics, General. I assume you will spare the lenses\u2019 crews from unnecessary harm.\u201d\n Touching. \u201cI am grateful for your assistance, Magistrate,\u201d Jedao said.\n \u201cServe well, General. The lenses will join your force at\u2014\u201d He named a time, which was probably going to be adhered to, then ended the communication.\n The lenses joined within eight minutes and nineteen seconds of the given time. Jedao wished there were some way to minimize their scan shadow, but Kel moths did that with formations, and the Rahal couldn\u2019t generate Kel formation effects.\n Jedao joined Menowen at the command center even though he should have rested. Menowen\u2019s mouth had a disapproving set. The rest of the Kel looked grim. \u201cSir,\u201d Menowen said. \u201cMove orders?\u201d\n He took his chair and pulled up the orders on the computer. \u201cFalse formation for the Rahal as shown. Follow the given movement plan,\u201d he said. \u201cCommunications, please convey the orders to all Rahal vessels.\u201d It was going to take extra time for the Rahal to sort themselves out, since they weren\u2019t accustomed to traveling in a fake formation, but he wasn\u2019t going to insult them by saying so.\n Menowen opened her mouth. Jedao stared at her. She closed her mouth, looking pensive.\n \u201cCommunications,\u201d Jedao said, \u201caddress to all units. Exclude the Rahal.\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t the first speech he\u2019d given on the journey, but the time had come to tell his commanders what they were up to and brace them for the action to come.\n The Communications officer said, \u201cIt\u2019s open, sir.\u201d\n \u201cThis is General Shuos Jedao to all moths,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that we\u2019re being pursued by a Lanterner swarm. We\u2019re going to engage them at Candle Arc. Due to the Lanterners\u2019 recent victory, cascading effects have shifted the calendrical terrain there. The Lanterners are going to be smart and take one of the channels with a friendly gradient to their tech most of the way in. Ordinarily, a force this small wouldn\u2019t be worth their time. But because of the way the numbers have rolled, Candle Arc is a calendrical choke: we\u2019re arriving on the Day of Broken Feet. Whoever wins there will shift the calendar in their favor. When we offer battle, they\u2019ll take us up on it.\u201d\n He consoled himself that, if the Lanterners lost, their soldiers would fall to fire and metal, honest deaths in battle, and not as calendrical foci, by having filaments needled into their feet to wind their way up into the brain.\n \u201cYou are Kel,\u201d Jedao went on. \u201cYou have been hurt. I promise you we will hurt them back. But my orders will be exact, and I expect them to be followed exactly. Our chances of victory depend on this. I am not unaware of the numbers. But battle isn\u2019t just about numbers. It\u2019s about will. And you are Kel; in this matter you will prevail.\u201d\n The panel lit up with each moth commander\u2019s acknowledgment. Kel gold against Kel black.\n They didn\u2019t believe him, not yet. But they would follow orders, and that was all he needed.\n Commander Menowen asked to see him in private afterward, as Jedao had thought she might. Her mouth was expressive. Around him she was usually expressing discontent. But it was discontent for the right reasons.\n \u201cSir,\u201d Menowen said. \u201cPermission to discuss the battle plan.\u201d\n \u201cYou can discuss it all you like,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cI\u2019ll say something if I have something to say.\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps you had some difficulties with the computer algebra system,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve run the numbers. We\u2019re arriving 4.2 hours before the terrain flips in our favor.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m aware of that,\u201d Jedao said.\n The near side of the choke locus was obstructed by a null region where no exotic technologies would function. But other regions around the null shifted according to a schedule. The far side of the choke periodically favored the high calendar. With Najhera\u2019s defeat, the far side would also shift sometimes toward the Lanterners\u2019 calendar.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to achieve,\u201d Menowen said.\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t see it,\u201d Jedao said, pleased, \u201cthe Lanterners won\u2019t see it either.\u201d\n To her credit, she didn\u2019t ask if this was based on an injury-induced delusion, although she clearly wanted to. \u201cI expect Kel Command thinks you\u2019ll pull off a miracle,\u201d she said.\n Jedao\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cNo, Kel Command thinks a miracle would be very nice, but they\u2019re not holding their breath, and as a Shuos I\u2019m kind of expendable. The trouble is that I keep refusing to die.\u201d\n It was like the advice for learning the game of pattern-stones: the best way to get good was to play difficult opponents, over and over. The trouble with war was that practicing required people to die.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve done well for your armies, sir. But the enemy general is also good at using calendrical terrain, and they\u2019ve demonstrated their ruthlessness. I don\u2019t see why you would pass up a terrain advantage.\u201d\n Jedao cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201cWe\u2019re not. Everyone gets hypnotized by the high fucking calendar. Just because it enables our exotics doesn\u2019t mean that the corresponding terrain is the most favorable to our purpose. I\u2019ve been reading the intel on Lanterner engineering. Our invariant drives are better than theirs by a good margin. Anyway, why the hell would they be so stupid as to engage us in terrain that favors us? I picked the timing for a reason. You keep trying to beat the numbers, Commander, when the point is to beat the people.\u201d\n Menowen considered that. \u201cYou are being very patient with my objections,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI need you not to freeze up in the middle of the battle,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cAlthough I would prefer for you to achieve that without my having to explain basics to you.\u201d\n The insult had the desired effect. \u201cI understand my duty,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you understand yours?\u201d\n He wondered if he could keep her. Moth commanders who were willing to question him were becoming harder to find. His usual commanders would have had no doubts about his plan no matter how much he refused to explain in advance.\n \u201cAs I see it,\u201d Jedao said, \u201cmy duty is to carry out the orders. See? We\u2019re not so different after all. If that\u2019s it, Commander, you should get back to work.\u201d\n Menowen saluted him and headed for the door, then swung around. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy did you choose to serve with the Kel? I assume it was a choice.\u201d The Shuos were ordinarily seconded to the Kel as intelligence officers.\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d Jedao said, \u201cit was because I wanted to know what honor looked like when it wasn\u2019t a triumphal statue.\u201d\n Her eyes went cold. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t being funny,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI will never be a Kel. I don\u2019t think like one of you. But sometimes that\u2019s an advantage.\u201d\n She drew in a breath. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cI just want to know that this isn\u2019t some Shuos game to you.\u201d That he wasn\u2019t being clever for the sake of being clever; that he wouldn\u2019t throw his soldiers\u2019 lives away because he was overeager to fight.\n Jedao\u2019s smile was not meant to reassure her. \u201cOh, it\u2019s to your advantage if it\u2019s a game,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very good at winning games.\u201d\n He wasn\u2019t going to earn her loyalty by hiding his nature, so he wasn\u2019t going to try.\n It was even easier to win games if you designed the game yourself, instead of playing someone else\u2019s, but that was a Shuos sort of discussion and he didn\u2019t think she wanted to hear it yet.\n The eleven fangmoths and seventy-three calendrical lenses approached Candle Arc only 1.3 hours behind schedule. Jedao was recovering the ability to read his watch, but the command center had a display that someone had enlarged for his benefit, so he didn\u2019t look at it. Especially since he had the sneaking feeling that his watch was off by a fraction of a second. If he drew attention to it, Captain-magistrate Korais was going to recalibrate it to the high calendar when they all had more important things to deal with.\n The crews on the lenses had figured out how to simulate formations. No one would mistake them for Kel from close range, but Jedao wasn\u2019t going to let the Lanterners get that close.\n \u201cWord from the listening posts is that the Lanterners are still in pursuit,\u201d Communications informed them.\n \u201cHow accommodating of them,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cAll right. Orders for the Rahal: The lenses are to maintain formation and head through the indicated channel\u201d\u2014he passed over the waypoint coordinates from his computer station\u2014\u201cto the choke locus. You are to pass the locus, then circle back toward it. Don\u2019t call us under any circumstances, we\u2019ll call you. And stick to the given formation and don\u2019t try any fancy modulations.\u201d\n It was unlikely that the Rahal would try, but it was worth saying. The Rahal were going to be most convincing as a fake Kel swarm if they stayed in one formation because there wasn\u2019t time to teach them to get the modulation to look right. The formation that Jedao had chosen for them was Senner\u2019s Lash, partly because its visible effects were very short-range. When the Rahal failed to produce the force-lash, it wouldn\u2019t look suspicious because the Lanterners wouldn\u2019t expect to see anything from a distance.\n \u201cAlso,\u201d Jedao said, still addressing the Rahal. \u201cThe instant you see something, anything on scan, you\u2019re to banner the Deuce of Gears.\u201d\n The Deuce was his personal emblem, and it connoted \u201ccog in the machine.\u201d Everyone had expected him to register some form of fox when he made brigadier general, but he had preferred a show of humility. The Deuce would let the Lanterners know who they were facing. It might not be entirely sporting for the Rahal to transmit it, but since they were under his command, he didn\u2019t feel too bad about it.\n \u201cThe Rahal acknowledge,\u201d Communications said. Jedao\u2019s subdisplay showed them moving off. They would soon pass through the calendrical null, and at that point they would become harder to find on scan.\n Commander Menowen was drumming her fingers on the arm of her chair, her first sign of nervousness. \u201cThey have no defenses,\u201d she said, almost to herself.\n It mattered that this mattered to her. \u201cWe won\u2019t let the Lanterners reach them,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cIf only because I would prefer to spend my career not having the Rahal mad at me.\u201d\n Her sideways glance was only slightly irritated. \u201cWhere are we going, sir?\u201d\n \u201cCut the mothdrives,\u201d Jedao said. He sent the coordinates to Menowen, Communications, and Navigation. \u201cWe\u2019re heading there by invariant drive only.\u201d This would probably prevent long-range scan from seeing them. \u201cTransmit orders to all moths. I want acknowledgments from the moth commanders.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u201d referred to some battledrift, all sharp edges and ash-scarred fragments and wrecked silverglass shards, near the mouth of what Jedao had designated the Yellow Passage. He expected the Lanterners to take it toward the choke. Its calendrical gradient started in the Lanterners\u2019 favor, then zeroed out as it neared the null.\n Depending on the Lanterners\u2019 invariant drives, it would take them two to three hours (high calendar) to cross the null region and reach the choke. This was, due to the periodic shifts, still faster than going around the null, because the detours would be through space hostile to their exotics for the next six hours.\n Reports had put the Lanterners at anywhere from sixty to one hundred twenty combat moths. The key was going to be splitting them up to fight a few at a time.\n Jedao\u2019s moth commanders acknowledged less quickly than he would have liked, gold lights coming on one by one.\n \u201cFormation?\u201d Menowen prompted him.\n There weren\u2019t a lot of choices when you had eleven moths. Jedao brought up a formation, which was putting it kindly because it didn\u2019t belong to Lexicon Primary for tactical groups, or even Lexicon Secondary, which contained all the obsolete formations and parade effects. He wanted the moths in a concave configuration so they could focus lateral fire on the first hostiles to emerge from the Yellow Passage.\n \u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Jedao said, \u201cbut we\u2019re using the battledrift as cover. Some big chunks of dead stuff floating out there, we might as well blend in and snipe the hell out of the Lanterners with the invariant weapons.\u201d At least they had a good supply of missiles and ammunition, as Najhera had attempted to fight solely with exotic effects.\n The Kel didn\u2019t like the word \u201csnipe,\u201d but they were just going to have to deal. \u201cTransmit orders,\u201d Jedao said.\n The acknowledgments lit up again, about as fast as they had earlier.\n The Fortune Comes in Fours switched into invariant mode as they crossed into the null. The lights became less white-gold and more rust-gold, giving everything a corroded appearance. The hum of the moth\u2019s systems changed to a deeper, grittier whisper. The moth\u2019s acceleration became noticeable, mostly in the form of pain. Jedao wished he had thought to take an extra dose of painkillers, but he couldn\u2019t risk getting muddled.\n Menowen picked out a chunk of coruscating metals that had probably once been some inexplicable engine component on that long-ago space fortress and parked the Fortune behind it. She glanced at him to see if he would have any objections. He nodded at her. No sense in getting in the way when she was doing her job fine.\n Time passed. Jedao avoided checking his watch every minute thanks to long practice, although he met Captain-magistrate Korais\u2019s eyes once and saw a wry acknowledgment of shared impatience.\n They had an excellent view of the bridgelights even on passive sensors. The lights were red and violet, like absurd petals, and their flickering would, under other circumstances, have been restful.\n \u201cWe won\u2019t see hostiles until they\u2019re on top of us,\u201d Menowen said.\n More nerves. \u201cIt\u2019ll be mutual,\u201d Jedao said, loudly enough so the command center\u2019s crew could hear him. \u201cThey\u2019ll see us when they get that close, but they\u2019ll be paying attention to the decoy swarm.\u201d\n She wasn\u2019t going to question his certainty in front of everyone, so he rewarded her by telling her. \u201cI am sure of this,\u201d he said, looking at her, \u201cbecause of how the Lanterner general destroyed Najhera. They were extremely aggressive in exploiting calendrical terrain and, I\u2019m sorry to say, they made a spectacle of the whole thing. I don\u2019t imagine the Lanterners had time to swap out generals for the hell of it, especially one who had already performed well, so I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re dealing with the same individual. So if the Lanterner wants calendrical terrain and a big shiny target, fine. There it is.\u201d\n More time passed. There was something wrong about the high calendar when it ticked off seconds cleanly and precisely and didn\u2019t account for the way time crawled when you were waiting for battle. Among the many things wrong with the high calendar, but that one he could own to without getting called out as a heretic.\n \u201cThe far terrain is going to shift in our favor in five hours, sir,\u201d Korais said.\n \u201cThank you, good to know,\u201d Jedao said.\n To distract himself from the pain, he was thinking about the bridgelights and their resemblance to falling petals when Scan alerted him that the Lanterners had shown up. \u201cThirty-some moths in the van,\u201d the officer said in a commendably steady voice. \u201cReadings suggest more are behind them. They\u2019re moving rapidly, vector suggests they\u2019re headed down the Yellow Passage toward the choke locus, and they\u2019re using a blast wave to clear mines.\u201d\n As if he\u2019d had the time to plant mines down a hostile corridor. Good of them to think of it, though.\n Menowen\u2019s breath hissed between her teeth. \u201cOur banner\u2014\u201d\n His emblem. The Kel transmitted their general\u2019s emblem before battle. \u201cNo,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cWe\u2019re not bannering. The Lanterners are going to be receiving the Deuce of Gears from over there,\u201d where the Rahal were.\n \u201cBut the protocol, sir. The Rahal aren\u2019t part of your force,\u201d Menowen said, \u201cthey don\u2019t fight\u2014\u201d\n That got his attention. \u201cFledge,\u201d Jedao said sharply, which brought her up short, \u201cwhat the hell do you mean they\u2019re not fighting? Just because they\u2019re not sitting on a mass of things that go boom? They\u2019re fighting what\u2019s in the enemy\u2019s head.\u201d\n He studied the enemy dispositions. The Yellow Passage narrowed as it approached the null, and the first group consisted of eight hellmoths, smaller than fangmoths, but well-armed if they were in terrain friendly to their own calendar, which was not going to be the case at the passage\u2019s mouth. The rest of the groups would probably consist of eight to twelve hellmoths each. Taken piecemeal, entirely doable.\n \u201cThey fell for it,\u201d Menowen breathed, then wisely shut up.\n \u201cGeneral Shuos Jedao to all moths,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cCoordinated strike on incoming units with missiles and railguns.\u201d Hellmoths didn\u2019t have good side weapons, so he wasn\u2019t as concerned about return fire. \u201cAfter the first hits, move into the Yellow Passage to engage. Repeat, move into the Yellow Passage.\u201d\n The fangmoths\u2019 backs would be to that damned null, no good way to retreat, but that would only motivate them to fight harder.\n If the Lanterners wanted a chance at the choke, they\u2019d have to choose between shooting their way through when the geometry didn\u2019t permit them to bring their numbers to bear in the passage, or else leaving the passage and taking their chances with terrain that shaded toward the high calendar. If they chose the latter, they risked being hit by Kel formation effects, anything from force lances to scatterbursts, on top of the fangmoths\u2019 exotic weapons.\n The display was soon a mess of red lights and gold, damage reports. The computer kept making the dry, metallic click that indicated hits made by the Kel. Say what you liked about the Kel, they did fine with weapons.\n Two hellmoths tried to break through the Kel fangmoths, presumably under the impression that the Rahal were the real enemy. One hellmoth took a direct engine hit from a spinal railgun, while the other shuddered apart under a barrage of missiles that overwhelmed the anti-missile defenses.\n \u201cYou poor fools,\u201d Jedao said, perusing the summaries despite the horrible throbbing in his left eye. \u201cYou found a general who was incandescently talented at calendrical warfare, so you spent all your money on the exotic toys and ran out of funding for the boring invariant stuff.\u201d\n Menowen paused in coordinating damage control\u2014they\u2019d taken a burst from an exploding scout, of all things\u2014and remarked, \u201cI should think you\u2019d be grateful, sir.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s war, Commander, and someone always dies,\u201d Jedao said, aware of Korais listening in; aware that even this might be revealing too much. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m eager to dance on their ashes.\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d Menowen said, but her voice revealed nothing of her feelings.\n The fangmoths curved into a concave bowl as they advanced up the Yellow Passage. The wrecked Lanterner hellmoths in the van were getting in the way of the Lanterners\u2019 attempts to bring fire to bear. Jedao had planned for a slaughter, but he hadn\u2019t expected it to work this well. They seemed to think his force was a detachment to delay them from reaching the false Kel swarm while the far terrain was hostile to the high calendar, and that if they could get past him before the terrain changed, they would prevail. It wasn\u2019t until the fourth group of Lanterners had been written into rubble and smoke that their swarm discipline wavered. Some of the hellmoths and their auxiliaries started peeling out of the passage just to have somewhere else to go. Others turned around, exposing their sides to further punishment, so they could accelerate back up the passage where the Kel wouldn\u2019t be able to catch them.\n One of Jedao\u2019s fangmoths had taken engine damage serious enough that he had ordered it to pull back, but that left him ten to work with. \u201cFormation Sparrow\u2019s Spear,\u201d he said, and gave the first set of targets.\n The fangmoths narrowed into formation as they plunged out of the Yellow Passage and toward five hellmoths and a transport moving with the speed and grace of a flipped turtle. As they entered friendlier terrain, white-gold fire blazed up from the formation\u2019s primary pivot and raked through two hellmoths, the transport, and a piece of crystalline battledrift.\n They swung around for a second strike, shifting into a shield formation to slough off the incoming fire.\n This is too easy, Jedao thought coldly, and then.\n \u201cIncoming message from Lanterner hellmoth 5,\u201d Communications said. Scan had tagged it as the probable command moth. \u201cHellmoth 5 has disengaged.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the only one. The list showed up on Jedao\u2019s display.\n \u201cHold fire on anything that isn\u2019t shooting at us,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cThey want to talk? I\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n There was still a core of fourteen hellmoths whose morale hadn\u2019t broken. A few of the stragglers were taking potshots at the Kel, but the fourteen had stopped firing.\n \u201cThis is Lieutenant Colonel Akkion Dhaved,\u201d said a man\u2019s voice. \u201cI assume I\u2019m addressing a Kel general.\u201d\n \u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cThis is General Shuos Jedao. Are you the ranking officer?\u201d Damn. He would have liked to know the Lanterner general\u2019s name.\n \u201cSir,\u201d Menowen mouthed, \u201cit\u2019s a trick, stop talking to them.\u201d\n He wasn\u2019t sure he disagreed, but he wasn\u2019t going to get more information by closing the channel.\n \u201cThat\u2019s complicated, General.\u201d Dhaved\u2019s voice was sardonic. \u201cI have an offer to make you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jedao said, \u201cbut are you the ranking officer? Are you authorized to have this conversation?\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t like the direction of the conversation. The weight of collective Kel disapproval was almost crushing.\n \u201cI\u2019m offering you a trade, General. You\u2019ve been facing General Bremis kae Meghuet of the Lantern.\u201d\n The name sounded familiar\u2014\n \u201cShe\u2019s the cousin of Bremis kae Erisphon, one of our leaders. Hostage value, if you care. You\u2019re welcome to her if you let the rest of us go. She\u2019s intact. Whether you want to leave her that way is your affair.\u201d\n Jedao didn\u2019t realize how chilly his voice was until he saw Menowen straighten in approval. \u201cAre you telling me you mutinied against your commanding officer?\u201d\n \u201cShe lost the battle,\u201d Dhaved said, \u201cand it\u2019s either death or capture. We all know what the heptarchate does to heretics, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n Korais spoke with quiet urgency. \u201cGeneral. Find out if Bremis kae Meghuet really is alive.\u201d\n Jedao met the man\u2019s eyes. It took him a moment to understand the expression in them: regret.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a nine-hour window,\u201d Korais said. \u201cThe Day of Broken Feet isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n Jedao gestured for Communications to mute the channel, which he should have done earlier. \u201cThe battle\u2019s basically won and we\u2019ll see the cascade effects soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal,\u201d Korais said, \u201cbut a heretic general is a sufficient symbol.\u201d Just as Jedao himself might have been, if the assassin had succeeded. \u201cIf we torture kae Meghuet ourselves, it would cement the victory in the calendar.\u201d\n Jedao hauled himself to his feet to glare at Korais, which was a mistake. He almost lost his balance when the pain drove through his head like nails.\n Still, Jedao had to give Korais credit for avoiding the usual euphemism, processed.\n Filaments in the feet. It was said that that particular group of heretics had taken weeks to die.\n Fuck dignity. Jedao hung on to the arm of the chair and said, as distinctly as he could, \u201cIt\u2019s a trick. I\u2019m not dealing with Dhaved. Tell the Lanterners we\u2019ll resume the engagement in seven minutes.\u201d His vision was going white around the edges, but he had to say this. Seven minutes wouldn\u2019t give the Lanterners enough time to run or evade, but it mattered. It mattered. \u201cAnnihilate anything that can\u2019t run fast enough.\u201d\n Best not to leave Doctrine any prisoners to torture.\n Jedao was falling over sideways. Someone caught his arm. Commander Menowen. \u201cYou ought to let us take care of the mopping up, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not well.\u201d\n She could relieve him of duty. Reverse his orders. Given that the world was one vast blur, he couldn\u2019t argue that he was in any fit shape to assess the situation. He tried to speak again, but the pain hit again, and he couldn\u2019t remember how to form words.\n \u201cI don\u2019t like to press at a time like this,\u201d Korais was saying to Menowen, \u201cbut the Lanterner general\u2014\u201d\n \u201cGeneral Jedao has spoken,\u201d Menowen said crisply. \u201cFind another way, Captain.\u201d She called for a junior officer to escort Jedao out of the command center.\n Words were said around him, a lot of them. They didn\u2019t take him to his quarters. They took him to the medical center. All the while he thought about lights and shrapnel and petals falling endlessly in the dark.\n Commander Menowen came to talk to him after he was returned to his quarters. The mopping up was still going on. Menowen was carrying a small wooden box. He hoped it didn\u2019t contain more medications.\n \u201cSir,\u201d Menowen said, \u201cI used to think heretics were just heretics, and death was just death. Why does it matter to you how they die?\u201d\n Menowen had backed him against Doctrine, and she hadn\u2019t had to. That meant a lot.\n She hadn\u2019t said that she didn\u2019t have her own reasons. She had asked for his. Fair enough.\n Jedao had served with Kel who would have understood why he had balked. A few of them would have shot him if he had turned over an enemy officer, even a heretic, for torture. But as he advanced in rank, he found fewer and fewer such Kel. One of the consequences of living in a police state.\n \u201cBecause war is about people,\u201d Jedao said. \u201cEven when you\u2019re killing them.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t imagine that makes you popular with Doctrine,\u201d Menowen said.\n \u201cThe Rahal can\u2019t get rid of me because the Kel like me. I just have to make sure it stays that way.\u201d\n She looked at him steadily. \u201cThen you have one more Kel ally, sir. We have the final tally. We engaged ninety-one hellmoths and destroyed forty-nine of them. Captain-magistrate Korais is obliged to report your actions, but given the numbers, you are going to get a lot of leniency.\u201d\n There would have been around 400 crew on each of the hellmoths. He had already seen the casualty figures for his own fangmoths and the three Rahal vessels that had gotten involved, fourteen dead and fifty-one injured.\n \u201cLeniency wasn\u2019t what I was looking for,\u201d Jedao said.\n Menowen nodded slowly.\n \u201cIs there anything exciting about our journey to Twin Axes, or can I go back to being an invalid?\u201d\n \u201cOne thing,\u201d she said. \u201cDoctrine has provisionally declared a remembrance of your victory to replace the Day of Broken Feet. He says it is likely to be approved by the high magistrates. Since we didn\u2019t provide a heretic focus for torture, we\u2019re burning effigy candles.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHe said he thought you might prefer this alternative remembrance. You don\u2019t want to be caught shirking this.\u201d She put the box down on the nearest table.\n \u201cI will observe the remembrance,\u201d Jedao said, \u201calthough it\u2019s ridiculous to remember something that just happened.\u201d\n Menowen\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cOne less day for publicly torturing criminals,\u201d she said, and he couldn\u2019t argue. \u201cThat\u2019s all, sir.\u201d\n After she had gone, Jedao opened the box. It contained red candles in the shape of hellmoths, except the wax was additionally carved with writhing bullet-ridden figures.\n Jedao set the candles out and lit them with the provided lighter, then stared at the melting figures. I don\u2019t think you understand what I\u2019m taking away from these remembrance days, he thought. The next time he won some remarkable victory, it wasn\u2019t going to be against some unfortunate heretics. It was going to be against the high calendar itself. Every observance would be a reminder of what he had to do next\u2014and while everyone lost a battle eventually, he had one more Kel officer in his corner, and he didn\u2019t plan on losing now.\n Yoon Ha Lee's works have appeared in Lightspeed, Tor.com, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

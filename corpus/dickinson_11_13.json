Her beloved engine, her daughter. Alight.\n\u201cWhat? That\u2019s insane,\u201d Siv says, pale antishadow in the engine glare, a slim tall shard of brighter light. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called sporadic familial insomnia. There\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d\nSiv shakes her head, backlit, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Get a second opinion.\u201d\nZaleha\u2019s been imagining this conversation for hours, now. Siv will try to figure out a way to fix her\u2014she\u2019ll write to some gene therapy clinic in Stanford or Minnesota or Boston, volunteering Zaleha as a subject. Or she\u2019ll try to get Zaleha into an induced coma, clinical substitute for the sleep she\u2019s about to lose forever. Siv, a zealous futurist, keeps track of all these biotech dreams, cures and augments and embryos with two mothers.\nBut none of it will help.\nSiv\u2019s always been ghoulishly agentic. She can never let the world have its way.\n\u201cI\u2019m the ninth case ever diagnosed,\u201d Zaleha says, smiling bravely. \u201cIsn\u2019t that cool? Double methionine at codon 129. Incredibly rare.\u201d\nSiv stares at her, plasma flare mirrored, starlike, in her goggles, like she\u2019s just thought of something so brilliant it\u2019s burning out her skull. \u201cOh, Z,\u201d she says. \u201cOh, no.\u201d And then, as the computer recites specific impulse and exhaust velocity, nominal at seven zero point seven two kilometers per second, \u201cIs it a secret?\u201d\nZaleha nods, her own goggles abruptly ineffective\u2014her eyes have started to prickle. \u201cI want to keep working,\u201d she says, and then, horribly choked up, please, she has to get a hold of herself, here where the whole test crew\u2019s watching, \u201ckeep trying to fix the symmetry fault and get the thruster flight-ready, until\u2014uh\u2014until it\u2019s not, you know, practical any more\u2014\u201d\nSiv holds her, even though it\u2019s unprofessional, even though the crew will notice and she doesn\u2019t have an excuse. Zaleha hugs her back, and stands on her toes to stare over Siv\u2019s shoulder, into the plasma shine, into the glare of the engine she built, searching\u2014\nAnd there he is, the visitor, the malak, the angel, her childhood haunt, her other secret.\nTariune.\nHe looks out at her through the exhaust spike, the cloak of fairy fire. And even through the vacuum, she hears him ask: will you come now? Has this made you ready?\nOf course he\u2019s in there. Mom and Dad, trying to raise a good Muslim daughter, always told Zaleha that the malaa\u2019ikah were made of light.\nGo away, she thinks, and then, regretting it instantly, please help me\u2014\nHe\u2019s already gone.\n\u201cField azimuth symmetry fault,\u201d the control officer calls. \u201cAbort test. Abort test.\u201d\nThe plasma thruster shuts down. The light goes out.\npost-burn systems check\nSiv telemetry:\nLater Siv asks her: \u201cWhy tell me then? Right in the middle of a test fire?\u201d\nBecause I was surrounded by everything important to me, Zaleha wants to say. But if she did, Siv would tease her for being maudlin. Siv Ahlstrom, a rocket scientist through and through, doesn\u2019t like feelings that can\u2019t be immediately converted into action.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fix that symmetry fault,\u201d Siv says. She squeezes Zaleha\u2019s shoulder reassuringly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to work.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve had four test fires now, and three of them have aborted on that damn fault\u2014active magnetics trying to enforce symmetry. Slipping.\nTariune telemetry:\nShe\u2019s never believed that he\u2019s really malak, an angel. (If she believed, she wouldn\u2019t have pissed him off five years ago.) He came to a young Zaleha, pre-empirical, practically pre-conscious, and so she understood him as a piece of the world, natural by definition. To a little kid, absent any metafaculties, perception is reality. Take her rattle out of sight, hide it behind Bapa\u2019s back, and it ceases to exist. Put a man with golden eyes and golden skin in her nursery, a smoke-smell man who can, in the space between his circled thumb and forefinger, open windows into a world of amber and blood and myth, a world of true names\u2014put him there, and young Zaleha accepts him.\nShe grew up into an engineer, a scientist, steeped in skepticism, armed with instruments of rationality and phenomenology. But even post-diagnosis, she\u2019s never doubted her own sanity. Tariune is real. His world is real. He can step between Aura and her world, the place he calls Coldworld, by his own logic, wholly separate from the unity and symmetry of physics. There are patterns, sure\u2014he likes to arrive in dreams, because dreams are the parts of her closest to Aura, the closest thing she has to an Auran soul. But these patterns do not yield to the same analysis.\n(As a teenager she tried to work out Aura\u2019s magic system, the rules of Tariune\u2019s appearances and capabilities. Eventually she understood the futility of the project. Systems didn\u2019t really function in Aura. It was nuministic, narrative, driven by an alternative causality. Dreams, though\u2014very big. Very central.)\nIn the darkest passages of her childhood, Tariune told her exactly what she wanted to hear:\n\u201cI know your destiny,\u201d he\u2019d whisper, his voice a better class of sound, his words a language she\u2019d never had to learn, pressed, somehow, straight into her brain, meanings rather than signifiers. He could speak raw truth. The Knowing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to cross over. You\u2019re going to learn, and struggle, and grow mighty. You\u2019re going to save us all.\u201d\nOnce, curious, her skepticism waxing, she asked: \u201cWhy me, though?\u201d\nTariune frowned in thought, regal mantle slipping away from the weary earnest man beneath, the salt and leather behind the prince\u2019s silk. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it. The Rhexics heard your dreams in the cold and they told me\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey said look on her, and I knew you were the right one. I knew.\u201d\nShe liked the man behind the silk and portent. \u201cAnd do they tell you what to say to me, too?\u201d she teased.\n\u201cNo.\u201d A memory of pain in his smile, offered in solidarity. \u201cI just remember what I wanted to hear, when my world started to break.\u201d\nSelf telemetry:\nThe double-methionine mutation at codon 129 of the PRNP prion gene causes cells to produce a faulty copy of the cellular prion protein PRPC. The glycoprotein folds wrong, creating an isoform\u2014well, the biochemistry gets complicated, but the effects are simple.\nWithin the year, she\u2019s going to lose the ability to enter REM sleep. Unable to regenerate or reintegrate or whatever the hell it\u2019s supposed to do during REM, her brain will start to break down. Over the next few months, she will become paranoid and anxious, then begin to hallucinate, then lose the ability to sleep entirely. If she doesn\u2019t kill herself first, she\u2019ll enter terminal dementia, withdraw from all outside stimulation, and die.\nEvery time she wakes up from a dream she thinks: it hasn\u2019t started yet. And: that could have been the last one.\nShe\u2019s never going to see her engine fly. NASA wants to test it on a JPL comet-rendezvous mission. A private spaceflight company wants to buy it to drive their metallic asteroid prospectors. If these missions succeed, Nur Zaleha\u2019s engine may give humanity (or its robots, at least) the solar system. But she\u2019ll be dead first.\nHer engine, her engine. The finest actively stabilized pulse-resonant plasma thruster ever invented, a nearly ideal system. It\u2019s not particularly large or powerful\u2014a petite, lightweight drive that exerts barely more force than the weight of a few pennies. But it\u2019s preposterously fuel-efficient. It can send tiny robotic spacecraft across the solar system with speed and grace and enviable reliability. Amateurs care about thrust. Professionals want specific impulse.\nIt\u2019s elegant. She made something beautiful out of lithium and current. She\u2019s so proud of it\u2014or she will be, once she fixes this damn field malfunction, the persistent symmetry fault that keeps scuttling their tests.\nTariune probably hates it.\nmid-course corrections: t+3 days\nShe has to tell her mom, her dad, her whole topologically baffling network of aunts, snarled up across continents and languages. It\u2019s the hardest fucking thing she\u2019s ever done. Her grief makes her brittle and when they ask stupid questions\u2014\u201cCan\u2019t you just take sleeping pills?\u201d\u2014she goes off like a, well, yeah, like a rocket, a big noisy chemical rocket, the kind that explodes on the pad. Not the kind she designs.\nIt\u2019s too much. Afterwards, she calls Siv, who, having split with her girlfriend and joined Zaleha in the solitary hell-covenant of Total Engineering Life, has replaced Zaleha\u2019s family as her great pillar of solace. \u201cHey. Want to come over and watch\u2014\u201d She kicks her stack of DVDs and allows the collapse to present a title. \u201cCosmos?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d\nIt\u2019s an ordinary question, delivered casually, but it gives Zaleha chills. \u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay as long as you want.\u201d Siv\u2019s voice hushes conspiratorially. \u201cHey. Is weed haram?\u201d\n\u201cProbably.\u201d She doesn\u2019t keep haram, exactly, but she doesn\u2019t drink either. She\u2019s an unbeliever now, but still a complete square. The lamest apostate.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dying, dude. You should smoke weed.\u201d\nZaleha laughs, a really good, genuine laugh, and then sits in silence, thinking: I don\u2019t want to change because I\u2019m dying. I want to stay the same.\nBut they get high on the apartment balcony, cursing the light pollution, the piss-yellow wash of sodium lamplight that drowns out all the stars. After a little while Siv gets quiet, her lips pursed, and starts looking around in a random walk that touches on everything except Zaleha\u2019s face.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Zaleha says. \u201cHey. I want to tell you something.\u201d\nSiv starts, her pale Scandinavian features somehow paler still. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says.\nRight now she trusts Siv with the chemical totality of a compromised system. \u201cI have a really weird secret,\u201d she says, and then tells Siv everything about Tariune, about Aura, about being chosen.\n\u201cI know you,\u201d Siv says, at the end of the story. \u201cSo I know you\u2019ve already checked out all the ordinary possibilities. Not a brain tumor. Not a psychosis. It\u2019s real.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Zaleha puts her head on Siv\u2019s bony shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to prove his existence to anyone else, but he\u2019s established it to my satisfaction. Thanks. I thought you might . . . \u201d\nSiv knows the disease will lead to hallucination.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty high,\u201d Siv says, examining her hands with wide-eyed equanimity. \u201cAnd you said you hadn\u2019t seen him for a while?\u201d\n\u201cBefore the test fire? Almost five years.\u201d Zaleha frowns up at the drowned sky. She wants to see the stars. \u201cWe had a couple of fights. He hates Coldworld\u2014you know, Earth, the universe. He said I was ready to cross over.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go? It sounds amazing.\u201d Real envy in Siv\u2019s voice, in her wide blue eyes. \u201cYou said magic? Actual magic?\u201d\n\u201cWhole new kinds of causality, I think. It\u2019s a place about\u2014stories, you know? About people. Instead of particles and laws.\u201d She shivers and draws up her knees, tucking herself closer to her friend. Siv stiffens a little, but doesn\u2019t draw away. \u201cWhich was why we fought. I got so tired of him going on about how cold and soulless and meaningless Earth seemed to him. \u2018An empty machine,\u2019 blah blah.\u201d She points up, not so much indicating a particular star as an axis, a vector written in her soul. \u201cI wanted to go\u2014out there, you know? Send people to another world. See trinary stars, baryons shattering into light on domain walls, wonders undreamt . . . he just saw dead rock and empty math.\u201d\nNo beauty in the color charge or the cataclysmic variable\u2019s polar jet, not to Tariune of Aura, not to the prince who climbed the steel ruin of armored mountains and listened at the peak for prophecy wind.\nThere\u2019s magic here, he\u2019d said once, in an adjunct to your Coldworld physics. But it\u2019s vestigial. Nothing ever turned it on. Maybe whatever process built your world didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you. You had the golden ticket, dude. You got the Hogwarts letter.\u201d Siv tugs her earlobe like it might contain some missing insight. \u201cAnd you wanted to stay here? You were that eager to watch Congress slash more funding, cancel a few more projects, a few hundred more careers?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s magic to you. I grew up with it. Harder to be reverent, I guess?\u201d Zaleha, giggling, thinks: boy, I am pretty high. \u201cHe\u2019s really gorgeous. I tried to sleep with him when I was nineteen. No one to judge, no consequences, I hated all the noble virgin shit. But he has some kind of tragic romance over in Aura, like a mortal enemy . . . it\u2019s part of this whole trouble we\u2019re going to fight . . . \u201d\nSilence from Siv. She has to crane her neck painfully to look into her friend\u2019s face. \u201cSiv?\u201d\nShe\u2019s crying. \u201cOh, Siv.\u201d Zaleha tries to squirm around to hug her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die,\u201d Siv chokes. \u201cI really don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d\nA long bottomless interval of grief, exhilarating in its raw truth\u2014the kind of thing you don\u2019t talk about afterwards, because words would lessen it. Like free fall. Like the way Tariune speaks about Aura.\nShe offers to let Siv crash on her couch, although she\u2019s a bit too much of a giraffe to really fit. But Siv, reeling, refuses. She has to get home, yes, it\u2019ll be okay, she\u2019ll take the bus. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fix that symmetry fault,\u201d she says fiercely, wiping at her ashen cheeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it work. Before\u2014\u201d\nShe screws up her face and stumbles away, towards the bus stop.\nThe next time they see each other Siv says: \u201cMan. Wow. We were really gone.\u201d\nShe finds Tariune in the simulations, knotted in the flux of the engine\u2019s electromagnets, racing electrons around the circulating current of the exit plane. A defiant spark, obedient to no law.\n\u201cHey,\u201d she says, whispering to the computer, unselfconscious, accustomed to this.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. That voice, that thrill of a voice, like a punch in the temporal lobe, a religious truth, every word a dogma. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here. Oh, Nur Zaleha, what has your world done to you?\u201d\n\u201cI thought it might be you, you know.\u201d That maybe he was trying to force her over with some curse of dreams. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be wrong.\u201d Because he can\u2019t lie to her. No one in Aura can lie in the Knowing, the un-language.\n\u201cNever.\u201d He flickers out of the engine like a heavy ion, a perfect trajectory, pulling a crown of electrons. Zaleha can\u2019t help but smile: that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. \u201cBut your time\u2019s running short now.\u201d\n\u201cI told you last time.\u201d She can\u2019t lie to him either. Can\u2019t even hide her pain. \u201cI have to finish this, Tariune. I want to change things before I go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can you change?\u201d The simulation chases him along unwritten paths, into domains it can\u2019t have been programmed to handle, places modern physics itself might not understand: frothing subatomic seascapes, the quantum vacuum roiling with virtual particles, and Tariune the Prince in Aura racing through like a needle of un-rule, an anarch of physics. \u201cLook at yourself. Struggling to make a new machine for those hunting new kinds of wealth. Fighting for a distant goal in a world that only cares for now. You are a dreamer in a world of prisons, Nur Zaleha, a chain of chains, and even if you fight through in time to make your mark, Coldworld will erase it. Death will take all your efforts. Even the stars will go out.\u201d\nShe watches in wonder and terror as the arrow of Tariune\u2019s passage pierces space and time, into an emptiness past the end of history, past the death of singularities and the decay of the proton and the Big Rip.\n\u201cThis is not your world,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a clockwork husk, winding down. Come to a place with meaning. Come and live forever. Come tonight, or tomorrow, or some day soon. Before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\u201cToo late?\u201d she asks, already understanding. Oh, no\u2014\u201cI have months, don\u2019t I?\u201d\nThe simulation withers away. Tariune stands before her, golden, majestic, not so much part of the room around her as a lamina over it, superliminal, more real than real. The man who stood when the Bane of Kings made his world kneel.\n\u201cYou have to cross in a dream,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere you\u2019re closest to Aura.\u201d\n\u201cBut if I can\u2019t dream . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be lost forever.\u201d He closes his eyes. She notices, in the absence of some diffuse luminance, a light that casts no shadows, that he has grown small weary lines around his eyes. \u201cLost to Aura. To me.\u201d\nShe swallows against fear: sometimes it\u2019s easier not to know the answer. \u201cIf I go . . . can you cure me?\u201d\n\u201cIf you come,\u201d he says, eyes still closed, palms half-raised, the Rings of Rhexis dark on the first finger of each hand, \u201cyou will live the truth of your name. I promise.\u201d\nNur Zaleha binti Abdul Samad. Self-sufficient. Eternal.\n\u201cI missed you,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d given up on me.\u201d\nThey\u2019d been friends. Real friends. It hadn\u2019t all been proclamation and prophecy. They\u2019d stayed up late, reading and complaining about how elf always meant super-white. Sort of the opposite of how she\u2019d met Siv, super-white Swede, who\u2019d told Zaleha (Malaysian, thanks) that she looked like the Iranian actress, Golshifteh Farahani, and pissed Zaleha off.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll still be afraid, I suspect.\u201d Tariune smiles, at first one of those formal I-am-a-kind-Prince smiles, and then a real genuine toothy grin, relieved, spontaneous. \u201cAura needs the brave. You can only be brave when you\u2019re afraid.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I lose?\u201d\nBecause she knows there\u2019s a price. There\u2019s always a price. That\u2019s how these things work. You go to the world more real than real, the shining hard-edged place where you can fight and bleed and grieve and know it all means something. You\u2019ll be healed. But to go you\u2019ve got to sacrifice . . .\n\u201cYou can\u2019t return, of course. In body or in mind.\u201d He hesitates, the only kind of prevarication or indirection the Knowing allows. \u201cYou will become a creature of Aura when you are healed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cI come to Coldworld.\u201d He opens a hand and tiny quanta carom and merge in his palm. \u201cBut I\u2019m only a visitor. I don\u2019t become clockwork. I don\u2019t become monist, closed, causal. When you become part of Aura, not just a visitor, but a mighty soul . . . \u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll think like you do. Good and evil. Destiny. Magic.\u201d Zaleha looks through him for a moment, to the diagrams pinned to her office walls, her desktop background, the currents of ion and electron she has tattooed onto her brain. The bones of her engine. \u201cNo more causal closure. No more materialism.\u201d\nNot a rocket scientist any more.\nIt\u2019s not that she\u2019ll lose anything really important, right? Science is just a tool. Just a way to select between beliefs. To test utility. She won\u2019t need it any more. In Aura she\u2019ll be able to learn the truth from grinning spirits and speak it to the wind. She\u2019ll never have to do an experiment again.\n\u201cThis machine,\u201d Tariune says, speaking carefully, looking at the plasma thruster diagrams, \u201cis every reason you should come. A tiny little force, trying to gradually move something very big. They\u2019ll never put it on anything but a robot probe. And it doesn\u2019t even work.\u201d\nMaybe he\u2019s always been right. Maybe she\u2019s just pissing her time away in an empty world, an indifferent mechanism iterating itself towards an empty future, doomed down to the last proton. She could be over there, armored in alabaster and the steel of vows, hunting salvation.\nShe lies awake that night, thinking about it, and passes into a terrible dream of Aura\u2019s end: eschaton kraken drowning the stars in a liquid-helium sea, the Bane of Kings triumphant on her throne of abrogated oaths. Zaleha wakes in terrified, anxious sweat, tangled in her sheets, flails for a moment, and then, the joy so sudden it seems like it must have broken something inside her, begins to sob in relief.\nmortal insertion: t+9 days\nSiv\u2019s been avoiding her. Zaleha hasn\u2019t pressed it, because she doesn\u2019t want to make Siv confront her own grief. But they end up standing side by side for the next test burn, in their usual places, like nothing\u2019s changed and nothing will.\nIn the hollow airless chamber, the thruster flickers to life. Ring electromagnets stripping lithium and hurling it as thrust. Light in the void.\nI made that, Zaleha thinks. It\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s going to fly.\nAnd then what? It gets put on somebody\u2019s spaceship, and then the ship gets cancelled? The company folds? Global warming eats civilization? What difference does it make?\nAs much difference as anything makes. The world doesn\u2019t stop when she does. Every word and crop and law and thruster keeps the adventure moving. Maybe the thrusters in particular.\n\u201cHey,\u201d she says.\n\u201cHey.\u201d Siv stares into the light, her goggles violet-black. \u201cThey stripped and rebuilt the whole Child-Langmuir feedback system. It\u2019s going to work this time.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d Zaleha tries to look her in the eyes, and finds herself almost hypnotized by the starfire reflections moving in the goggles as Siv looks back. \u201cWhat if we can\u2019t make it work before\u2014my deadline?\u201d\nThey both know what happens to most experimental propulsion projects. The guillotine\u2019s been there the whole time, just waiting for momentum to falter, for an obstacle that requires too much time or money to surmount. 2014 has not been a kind year to the field.\nSiv draws a long breath. \u201cZ,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s your engine. But I\u2019ve been building simulations of it for two years. Wick, Jeb, Sobel, the rest of the crew\u2014they\u2019re brilliant.\u201d She adjusts her goggles. \u201cNearly as brilliant as you, if you get them all together. We can keep working the problem. It\u2019s not so big, compared to everything you solved already. Just a little glitch.\u201d\nShe looks away, as if the engine flare offers a more comfortable view. The computer says: nominal at one one zero point two two kilometers per second.\nThis isn\u2019t Aura. Zaleha\u2019s not special. Not the one chosen to make a difference. The team can go on without her.\nThat\u2019s what Tariune\u2019s always hated. What she\u2019s always loved.\n\u201cThere may be an experimental treatment,\u201d she says, and then, in spite of the unalloyed joy on Siv\u2019s face, the bounce of glee that curls right up from her calves and tries to hide itself behind sober it\u2019s-only-experimental qualification in those goggled supergiant-blue eyes, Zaleha finishes the sentence: \u201cBut if I go through with it, I\u2019m never going to be able to come back. You\u2019ll never see me again. There\u2019s, uh, an induced coma . . . a really long time.\u201d\n\u201cGo for it,\u201d Siv says, without any hesitation at all. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d\n\u201cField azimuth symmetry fault,\u201d the control officer calls. \u201cAbort test. Abort test.\u201d\nThey groan together, and then laugh. \u201cBetter get to work,\u201d Zaleha says.\npost burn systems check\nTariune telemetry:\n\u201cAm I going to leave a body?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cNo.\u201d He looks affronted. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to Aura. Why would you leave a part of yourself behind? How could we cure you without the whole of you?\u201d\n\u201cI better come up with a convincing excuse for my family, then.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you please.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look impatient, though. His eyes glow with an incredible relief. \u201cI\u2019m so glad, Nur Zaleha. We need you. Such a tale waits to be written.\u201d\nSiv telemetry:\nThe last time they ever see each other, they talk philosophy.\n\u201cI\u2019m at peace now,\u201d Zaleha says. \u201cI used to want to be the one. All over the history books: \u2018invented the Nur Zaleha Drive.\u2019 But I\u2019m content with my little contribution. Nobody needs to remember me.\u201d\nSiv covers her mouth with her hand and her eyes seem to tremble. \u201cWhat?\u201d Zaleha says, ready to comfort her.\n\u201cYawning,\u201d Siv says thickly. They look at each other for a long time, and although they don\u2019t say anything, Zaleha wonders if they\u2019ve both come to speak the Knowing.\nAt the door, Zaleha, trying to be funny, says: \u201cYou could say something really flattering now. You\u2019re never going to see me again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019d convince you to stay,\u201d Siv says. And then, with a sudden resolve that seals across her whole mien like a bulkhead, a tourniquet: \u201cI\u2019m going to see that fucking thruster fly. Every damn probe in the sky is going to ride it. Okay?\u201d\nSelf telemetry:\nShe lies down, closes her eyes, and waits. Feels Tariune\u2019s hand closing warm around hers, drawing her down, or up\u2014in any case, away. A sense of journey, an invisible kinetic truth.\nSiv, she thinks. Oh.\nOh, Siv.\nThe world, the whole universe, collapses beneath her into a small violet spark, into the dimming flicker of a plasma thruster throttling down.\ncircularization: new coordinate system\nThey race north by nimbus ship, desperate to complete the ritual before her dreams rot away.\nLightning snaps between the Lode Peaks, and for a brilliant instant, the whole cloudscape beneath them burns in afterimage. It takes Zaleha\u2019s breath away.\nNight sky above. A billion billion stars behind a thunderously red gas giant, million-kilometer auroras a veil for two dozen moons. Arches and parapets of light.\nAura circles a parent world that could challenge Jupiter for size and beauty.\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy journey. Tariune\u2019s kingdom has fallen to ruin, throne usurped by a queen he won\u2019t speak of, and in the bone-ash West a terrible darkness kindles in the light of cremated moons. She has much to learn and many loyalties to win. First, though\u2014she has to be cured, her dreams made part of Aura.\nThe nimbus ship\u2019s deck pitches in turbulence. She holds to the railing. \u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d Tariune says. He looks down at the clouds, and she catches her breath at the fear in his eyes.\nBut the dragons, majestic, naval, bone mast and tendon rigging, escort them between the Lode Peaks. Their wings snap and shine with induced current. Below, Zaleha sees rivers of mercury and shining lakes that reek of kerosene even from this height. \u201cDeadly land,\u201d Tariune murmurs in her ear. \u201cThe Method War brought poison up from the earth. The springs yield frozen fire.\u201d\nShe\u2019s come to Aura, but she is not yet of it. With an empiricist\u2019s reflex she imagines the chemistry of the land below. All its possible uses.\nThey come to the standing stones at the Third Pole. Lightning crashes down again and again, a dwindling ring around them. \u201cHurry!\u201d Tariune calls to the dragons. \u201cTo the altar, before she dreams no more!\u201d\nZaleha lies on her back in the ritual circle, and the Singers, the last of the ancient Rhexic Method who ruptured the walls of existence, begin to make her part of Aura, part of the song of the world and all it will become.\nShe looks up into the sky, at the vast planet above, at its twenty-four moons. Thinks of magnetospheres, of lithium, of kerosene rivers. \u201cThe Eye of Anaxis,\u201d Tariune says, following her gaze. \u201cWe dreamed of reaching it long ago, before the Method War. Dreamed of finding some way to leap into the sky . . . \u201d\nAnd she feels all the things she is about to forget kindle within her, a rising light, a starfire torch.\nNur Zaleha, daughter of Abdul Samad, stands and raises her hands to stop the Rhexic sorcerers. \u201cI will not go,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t be part of Aura yet.\u201d\n\u201cZaleha. No. Please.\u201d Tariune cannot, does not, hide his horror. \u201cIf you refuse the ritual, your disease will rot your mind. You will go mad. You will die. And you are our only hope.\u201d\n\u201cThere are other hopes I can offer.\u201d She smiles. Bravely, she hopes. All she ever wanted was to change something. \u201cHopes from another world, worth my madness, worth my death. Hopes I carry in the part of me that you would leave behind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of the darkness in the West?\u201d the Rhexic Master protests. \u201cWhat of the Bane of Kings, the usurper?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m done,\u201d she promises the ancient woman, \u201cyou will have stars enough to light any darkness. Worlds enough to make any kingdom small.\u201d\n\u201cNur Zaleha,\u201d Tariune begins, and stumbles, and stops. She hears the break in his voice, the salt-and-leather man struggling to be the Prince again. \u201cI promised you\u2014I promised I would make your name true.\u201d\nShe clasps his wrist. Smiles through the tears, grief and fear and joy and most of all gratitude to her friend. Her friends.\n\u201cIt means servant of the eternal,\u201d she says. \u201cLet me serve.\u201d\nAnd with Prince Tariune, the Dragons of the Lode, and the last of the Rhexic as her witness, she begins to teach.\nSystems work differently on Aura.\nBut she loves these systems enough to make a story out of them, apoapsis to zenith and everything between.\nThey try to cure her later, when she feels she\u2019s done enough. But she\u2019s made her choice, written her own story, and the PRPC protein isoform is loose in her mind. She\u2019s not dreaming anymore. There\u2019s nothing left in her to put into Aura\u2019s song. Nothing she hasn\u2019t already written there.\nMore than two seasons later, on the last day of her sanity, she comes to lucidity long enough to feel Tariune drawing her through the kerosene stink. Hears him say, as if from a great distance: \u201cShe will bear your name. She and all her descendants.\u201d\nShe dies in madness. But it\u2019s a death she chose.\nmission outcomes: t + 1.4x10^14 years\nThe stars have gone out. The universe freezes in half-light. Even the singularities have started to evaporate.\nThe marathon is over. Existence has run its course.\nIn the isotropic night, defiant life gathers to escape: dark, cautious, vast. The machines at the end of time. A lineage so ancient and so fiercely intelligent it still remembers its birth around a blue world lost to ash.\nThe portal opens. A rift born of the same quintessence that will soon shred all matter, a wormhole designed by the highest savantries of machine computation. A gate to salvation.\nThe first probes make transit, plasma jets sparking in old robust shades of violet.\nA garden, they send. Matter, energy, strange new laws. Worlds of bone and gossamer, swan-winged ships out of ancient dream\u2014\nFamiliar\u2014\nThe apex mind of the gathered machines watches the probes greet a swift white starship. Recognizes the violet pulse of its attitude jets, stuttering with finesse.\n\u201cThis is Nur Zaleha,\u201d the ship sends, the language ancient. \u201cWelcome to Aura, the great crossroads.\u201d\nA name. The specific form is obsolete\u2014a word might as well be a pheromone, a protein on a cell wall. But the machines remember how to be polite. They search the vault of memory for something linked to Nur Zaleha.\nAnd to their genuine surprise, they find an ancient name, a progenitor, pivotal to the birth of higher machine life.\nThey make it theirs with a certain reverence. Lend it to the ambassador mind they\u2019ve bootstrapped, a link to their new hosts.\n\u201cGreetings, Nur Zaleha,\u201d the emissary sends, and feels her first joy. \u201cWe are the Siv.\u201d\nSeth Dickinson is the author of The Traitor Baru Cormorant and a lot of short stories, including \"Morrigan in the Sunglare\", this story's antecedent.

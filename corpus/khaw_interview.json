This page: Undoing Good Women: A Conversation with Cassandra Khaw by Arley Sorg", "categories": null, "tags": null, "id": 0, "license": null, "comments": null, "source-hostname": "Clarkesworld Magazine", "text": "Interview\nUndoing Good Women: A Conversation with Cassandra Khaw\nBorn in Malaysia, Cassandra Khaw grew up watching horror movies with their parents, from John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing to A Nightmare on Elm Street to Critters. When they got older, they got into Asian horror movies, such as Shutter and The Eye. Nonetheless, long before landing their first fiction sales, they were a tech and video game journalist. A hardcore geek at heart, they work full time now as lead writer for the North American edition of a game they still cannot talk about. They\u2019ve written for venues such as Ars Technica, Engadget, Eurogamer, Gamasutra, and The Verge, and spent a decade traveling so often for work that they rarely spent more than a few months in any one continent. Games they contributed to include The Silence Under Your Bed, Sunless Skies, and Wasteland 3.\nKhaw\u2019s fiction career began with \u201cDisconnect\u201d at Vice\u2019s tech site Motherboard in 2014. In 2015 they had a handful of pieces come out, including \u201cWhat the Highway Prefers\u201d at Lackington\u2019s, \u201cAn Ocean of Eyes\u201d in The Dark, and novella Rupert Wong, Cannibal Chef with Rebellion imprint Abaddon, which was part of their Gods and Monsters series. (Contrary to frequent misconceptions, the franchise began with Chuck Wendig\u2019s Unclean Spirits.) Since then, they\u2019ve seen fifty short stories published in various well-respected venues.\nCassandra Khaw is an award-winning game writer and multiple award-nominated fiction writer, with work spanning genres in multiple major venues, including Nature, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Tor.com, Apex, and more. They are one of the three authors for Walk Among Us, a Vampire: The Masquerade tie-in book, just out from Harper Voyager. The All-Consuming World is due from Erewhon Books in September of 2021 and Nothing But Blackened Teeth is due from Tor Nightfire in October of 2021.\nIn between all of that, they found time to learn Muay Thai, get into street dancing, write for D&D, World of Darkness, and Magic: The Gathering.\nWhat was \u201cbreaking in\u201d for you? How did it happen, and at what point did you feel like you were established?\nRegular submissions to all the venues. Daily obsessive trips to The Submission Grinder, trying to figure out if the response times meant that my story was moving into the next round, etc. And honestly, it\u2019s only lately that I\u2019ve started feeling like my career is an established one, and that\u2019s only because I have sold enough things that I\u2019m now like, \u201cOh god. This book won\u2019t be out until 2023. Okay.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve had three stories in Clarkesworld so far: \u201cWhen We Die on Mars\u201d in 2015, \u201cBreathe\u201d in 2016, and \u201cLandmark\u201d in 2017. Do you feel like these stories have commonalities or a vibe?\nI think the biggest commonality between the three stories here is that they\u2014at least to me, it may well be authorial hubris talking!\u2014give the impression of being windows into larger, coherently designed worlds. And there is a definite loneliness to them too, a sense of the universe being far bigger than a single human heart can hold; that we\u2019re here just for a second, just for a moment, and we\u2019re dwarfed by existence itself.\nIn 2017 your poetry started coming out, beginning with \u201cProtestations Against the Idea of Anglicization\u201d in Uncanny Magazine. What is your relationship to poetry? Do you address similar concerns and themes through poetry as you do with prose?\nIt\u2019s absolutely a newer form of expression, one that I\u2019m still gingerly learning. Poetry is such a beautiful and complex beast to me. I\u2019m in awe of people like my darling Ali Trotta, who can spin poetry like it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world.\nAnd I think so. Lately, I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what my subconscious is working through in my creative work, and I\u2019ve decided it has a lot to do with undoing a lot of generational trauma and indoctrination: the idea that good women are seen, not heard; good women work hard and don\u2019t complain; good women give everything in hopes that the people who come up after them might have more, might have the opportunity to say what they feel, go for what they want.\nA lot of my work, I think, screams at the idea of that silence, that sense of being restrained and small, of not asking too much, of being tidy.\nWhat is your process like for writing poetry, especially compared to writing short fiction?\nIt involves significantly more angsting than my prose writing. Like I said earlier, I\u2019m still trying to figure this out. I\u2019m not really a poet; I don\u2019t feel like one, at any rate. And I\u2019m particularly aware of this when I try to write poetry.\nWho are some of your favorite poets or favorite poems?\nI don\u2019t read as much poetry as I should. But one of my favorite poets is Denice Frohman. Oh my god. Reading Frohman is what drove me into wanting to write poetry. Her poem, \u201cAccents\u201d is permanently burned into my brain. The rhythm of it, the easy glide, the way she makes the English language her dance partner but doesn\u2019t allow it to determine her dance. Her poetry is stunning, both in terms of its craft and its subject matter.\nOn the speculative side, I love Ali Trotta\u2019s work. I\u2019ll preface this by saying that I might be biased because she\u2019s like blood to me, my sister from another mother. But there\u2019s such a goddamned grace to her poetry, a grasp of mythology that always awes me. Not in the sense that she\u2019s well-read in the various mythologies of the world (although clearly she is), but in the way she builds myths from her poetry. It\u2019s all great, great stuff.\nI also absolutely love Lora Gray\u2019s poetry, which is both so delicate and so brutal at the same time. If Ali\u2019s poetry is brocade and the smell of temple incense, Lora Gray\u2019s work is a polished knife that cuts deep into the heart. Every time I read one of their pieces, I inevitably find myself going, \u201cOh,\u201d very softly in awe.\nFor folks who haven\u2019t read your short fiction, if you wanted to point them to one story to get them started, what would it be, and why?\n\u201cYou Do Nothing But Freefall,\u201d from Lightspeed. It is probably the most approachable, language-wise. But I think it also gets across a lot of what defines my work: that desire for change, the melancholy, the mythological creatures seeking to escape the definitions they\u2019ve been given.\nWalk Among Us, a tie-in book for Vampire: The Masquerade, just came out, and it has your novella \u201cFine Print.\u201d What do you really want readers to know, beyond the line of description on the publisher page?\nDuke is 100 percent based on people I\u2019ve met in the game industry: the overwhelming egotism seen in the upper management, the toxic techbro mentality. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I do love working in the games industry. But there are absolutely people here who get away with being absolute jerks.\nI wanted very much to see what\u2019d happen if someone like that went up against the Ventrue Clan, especially if he thinks they present as lesser. Needless to say, it doesn\u2019t go well.\nYou also have The All-Consuming World coming out with Erewhon in August, a science fiction novel with a dash of mystery, featuring a group of former criminals. What was the most challenging aspect of writing this book, and how did you get through that challenge?\nThe abuse-related stuff, honestly. No small amount of the book deals with the idea of codependency and sick systems, how abusers make use of your best traits to keep you in a stranglehold. It deals as well with how we lie to ourselves about these things, how we convince ourselves that everything is okay, that it\u2019s all fine, that really, we do love the people who hurt us.\nAnd getting through it was, well, part \u201cthis book is on contract and I absolutely have to deliver\u201d and also, a desire to remind people that you don\u2019t have to be meek or small to be abused. Some of the strongest people I know, people who have lived through amazing hardships, who are shockingly resilient, they\u2019ve been subject to abuse too, have been manipulated and molded by it.\nWhat are your favorite things about the universe you\u2019ve created, or your favorite bits of research that went into building the universe?\nThe little things that the Minds get up to. We don\u2019t really see it much in the book because we\u2019re focused on Plot Things, but the Minds, as a species, are just fascinated with the concept of having limitless time, limitless access to all the knowledge in the world, and limitless opportunity to express themselves. Away from the main events of the book, they\u2019re writing poetry in infrared, coming up with dances in faster-than-light travel, building languages out of snippets of seventeenth century love letters. All kinds of things.\nWhat do you love most about the characters in this book\u2014what was your favorite thing about writing them?\nTheir love for each other. The Dirty Dozen, and their relationships, are least partially inspired by my own found family. There are a bunch of brilliant people who I treat as older siblings, or dote on like they\u2019re my younger siblings. I love them without exemption. And there are pieces of them in the Dirty Dozen: their loyalty, their humor, their kindness, their love, their absolute goddamned fabulousness.\nFinally, you have Nothing But Blackened Teeth, due from Tor Nightfire in October, \u201ca gorgeously creepy haunted house tale.\u201d Haunted houses are a trope we come back to time and time again. What do you think is the appeal of haunted houses for people in general, and is the appeal the same for you?\nHome is where the heart is, right? Home is the thing we go to when we want to close our eyes, be vulnerable, take a breath, relax, be safe. Haunted house stories are creepy as heck as it upends that idea completely, shows how we aren\u2019t necessarily safe at home. I think as well that haunted house stories are a dialogue with that part of us that is aware that home, sometimes, can be a prison, can be a place where Really Bad Things happen, and you can\u2019t say anything because where would you go?\nOne of the things this book does is examine relationships, peeling back the skin to find the rot. What was the hardest thing about writing these characters?\nVisiting the idea that friendships aren\u2019t always healthy, that just because you\u2019ve known someone for twenty years, it doesn\u2019t mean that friendship is good for either of you. I think that the media has socialized us to believe that things need to last. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019re of no value. Which a) isn\u2019t true and b) leads us to getting into situations where we tolerate people, where we smile, where we let things go, because hey, that person has been our friend forever.\nWhat else are you working on that readers can look forward to?\nA whole bunch of things. I have a duology with Richard Kadrey that\u2019s coming up, a little novella that answers the \u201cand then what happened\u201d in one of my stories, and I\u2019m pecking right now at what will likely be a novella involving the grown-up daughter of a pair of serial killers.\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

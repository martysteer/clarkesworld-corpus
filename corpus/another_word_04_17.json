This page: Another Word: Being James Tiptree, Jr. by Kelly Robson", "categories": null, "tags": null, "id": 0, "license": null, "comments": null, "source-hostname": "Clarkesworld Magazine", "text": "Non-Fiction\nAnother Word: Being James Tiptree, Jr.\nIn 2013, my wife Alyx and I blew up our life, lunged across the continent, and started afresh in Toronto. After twenty-two years of comfort and stability in Vancouver, we were on the hunt for a new home and new jobs, and had to renegotiate all the relationships one takes for granted when one is settled: doctors, allergists, ophthalmologists, dentists, dental hygienists, massage therapists, chiropractors\u2014an entire battalion of life-maintenance professionals. As a lesbian couple, this meant coming out to various strangers.\nIt\u2019s not a terribly big deal. Usually coming out to a stranger goes well. Most humans are fair-minded, but you always run the risk of getting punched in the nose by ugly prejudice.\nWe also needed a new accountant. A friend recommended someone and when we met him, we were thrilled to find out that he\u2019d long been involved in science fiction. Of course we immediately began talking books. Which went fine for about thirty seconds until he said:\n\u201cI don\u2019t read women writers. Ever.\u201d\nThis was not the punch in the nose I was expecting.\nThe book talk shuddered to a halt. We went back to talking about taxes. I was offended, but I swallowed it. Alyx and I are pragmatists. Nobody has to pass a reading preferences test to do our taxes.\nBut I haven\u2019t forgotten. It stings because it\u2019s not a matter of simple individual prejudice. In a world where lists of essential books a man should read contain perhaps one woman author, in an industry where genres women dominate are disparaged despite being highly lucrative and successful market sectors, in a field where the conversation about inclusivity bursts into flame on a regular basis, women\u2019s writing being pre-judged as undesirable is neither simple nor individual. It\u2019s policy.\nWhat does it mean to write in a gendered way? Two hundred and twenty five years after Mary Wollstonecraft, we\u2019re still thrashing this question from every angle despite the fact that many of us reject binary m/f gender. Gender is fluid. Gender is a spectrum. Gender is an illusion only visible through cultural lenses.\nYet, women writers are less lauded, less awarded, less read, less valued. And many men don\u2019t read women. Some, like my accountant, even take pride it.\nWhy? James Tiptree, Jr. knew the answer. She told us, too, in an essay she wrote in 1974 to be published in case of her death.\nTiptree\u2019s story is well known. From 1968 to 1976, Dr. Alice B. Sheldon played a highly successful gender trick on the entire field of science fiction. Writing under the pseudonym James Tiptree, Jr., she drew on her personal experience with hunting, fishing, military service, covert intelligence, and international politics to craft famously successful short stories that changed the field of science fiction forever. She also engaged in voluminous correspondence with many leading members of the genre community of the time, concealing her true identity\u2014and her gender\u2014from everyone.*\nIn 1974, before having surgery, Alice Sheldon sent a packet to her literary agent with instructions that the enclosed envelope was only to be opened if Tiptree stopped contacting him\u2014in effect, to be opened in case of her death. Under those circumstances, she suggested the contents should be published in the SFWA Forum. The envelope contains an essay titled \u201cThe Secret of James Tiptree Jr.\u201d** It\u2019s just over three typewritten, double-spaced pages. Alice Sheldon takes less than seven hundred words to reveal her true identity to her friends, editors, colleagues, and fans.\nThe envelope wasn\u2019t opened; the essay was never published. The surgery was successful. Alice Sheldon recovered, and her identity remained secret for another two years.\nI\u2019ve long been fascinated by everything Tiptree wrote. \u201cThe Secret of James Tiptree Jr.\u201d is an interesting piece of SF history but it also holds broader significance. It tells us why a woman writer might choose to conceal herself behind a male persona, what she gets out of that strategy, and what she stands to lose if her gender is revealed.\nAlice Sheldon begins the essay with a joke: \u201cJames Tiptree Jr. was born in October 1967 in the imported jam section of the McLean Supergiant.\u201d Then she quickly turns serious, claiming the pseudonym was fateful: \u201cA circuit in the cosmos clicked.\u201d She explains that she was 52 years old at the time, in the process of defending her PhD, and overtaxed by research and teaching obligations. She didn\u2019t think her stories would sell, and she chose a name she thought would be unmemorable to editors.\nThis is only partly true. Though a writer may submit stories expecting rejection, nobody hopes for it. She certainly wanted those first Tiptree stories to sell. Also, in a series of letters written in 1976 and 1977 to her literary executor Jeffrey D. Smith,*** she says she took the pseudonym to avoid damaging her reputation as a PhD candidate.\nNext, she assures her friends, with whom she\u2019d exchanged hundreds of personal letters, painstakingly typed with one finger, that everything she\u2019d written to them was true, \u201cIncluding, most especially, my feelings.\u201d Knowing her friends would be upset by her deception, she takes care to assure them that, \u201cI have only told the lie of the signature.\u201d\nAnd then she cuts to the chase: \u201cBut I know what is really wanted here: the appearance.\u201d Alice Sheldon knows women are judged by their appearance. On discovering James Tiptree is a woman, her looks are the first question on everyone\u2019s mind. She could have simply enclosed a photo, but instead\u2014tellingly\u2014she makes fun of her appearance.\nAlice Sheldon was a beautiful woman even in her sixties. She may not have thought of herself as attractive, but she certainly knew that others did. In \u201cThe Secret of James Tiptree Jr.,\u201d however, she cannot possibly say so. She knows that just as a woman suffers if she\u2019s unattractive, a woman who displays vanity also suffers. She cannot possibly own the reality of her looks; the social cost is too high. Instead, she says she \u201cwas considered good-looking, still look[s] at least clean,\u201d and makes a joke about trying to hold her stomach in.\nIn short, she disparages herself. After years of hiding behind a male persona, in an essay she intended to be published only after she was dead, she hides under the hair and skin of an unremarkable woman.\nHaving disposed of her appearance, she quickly changes the subject. She states that every biographical detail she claimed as Tiptree is true, including her liberal politics, her army experience, and her knowledge of hunting and fishing. Another joke: \u201cBut I\u2019m not a butch type\u2014more of a farmer woman with over-achievement problems.\u201d\nThen, after two and a half pages of half-truths, jokes, understatement, and self-disparagement, she asks with great earnestness, knowing no answer is forthcoming:\nNow how do you feel?\nI wonder what you feel, about this.\nShe asks this because she feels guilty for a very specific reason:\nTip has been conscious of no dishonesty. Not him. But I have. As I saw my brave sisters I went through terrible qualms.\nThe brave sisters are her fellow women science fiction writers, such as Joanna Russ, Ursula K. Le Guin, Kate Wilhelm, and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro. Having avoided gender discrimination by pretending to be a man, Alice Sheldon is nonetheless conscious of how deep those gender traps are, and how dangerous. Through her correspondence with Le Guin and Russ, she knows the challenges women face when writing while gendered. She suspects her women colleagues may feel double-crossed. She adds: \u201cI tremble to find out what you feel.\u201d\nFinally, before signing off, she offers two tantalizing tidbits, which could be expanded into entire volumes of books.\nFirst, she offers her reason for continuing the deception after having made so many close friends among her fellow writers, and even while suffering those terrible qualms of guilt:\nEverything sounded so much more interesting coming from a man. (Didn\u2019t it. Didn\u2019t it, just a little? Be honest.)\nThis is key. Alice Sheldon has put her finger on the whole reason why my accountant doesn\u2019t read women writers, and why a gender gap exists in all measurements of a writer\u2019s success, including reviews, awards, advances, and fame. Everything sounds more interesting coming from a man\u2014not just to men, but to everyone. More important. More serious. More worthy of attention. More laudable.\nWriting as Tiptree, Alice Sheldon didn\u2019t just avoid gender discrimination; she supercharged everything she wrote with gravitas and authority. When Tiptree spoke, people paid attention. They took his writing very, very seriously. Of course she couldn\u2019t give that up. I\u2019d find it hard to give up, too.\nFinally, she hints at what she learned by being Tiptree:\nTip is real, you see. And Tip says, sisters, this was very, very informative. Maybe something we should all try. Of that more later.\nOf that more later. This is an odd statement considering the essay was intended only to be published after her death. And it\u2019s frustrating. I want to know, what did you find out, Alli? Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\nWe are left to conjecture. But I suspect that what she found out was this:\nWriting as a man gave her freedom that was missing when she wrote as herself. Tiptree\u2019s gender and anonymity granted her psychological permission to take risks, make mistakes, and devote thousands of hours to her solitary art and craft, excluding and ignoring other obligations on her time and attention. Being Tiptree certainly allowed her to avoid gender discrimination, but more importantly, it allowed her to overcome the barriers in her own mind.\nAnd I agree: Maybe this is something we should all try.\nI\u2019m not saying we should all impersonate white men to avoid being buttonholed. I\u2019m simply saying that enough external barriers to our work exist, not just for women, but for writers of color, for gender non-conforming writers, for writers with children and families to nurture and support, for writers with physical and mental health challenges. The only barriers completely within our control are those within our own minds. We should embrace whatever tactics help us overcome them.\n* It\u2019s not my intent to give a precis of Alice Sheldon\u2019s fascinating life. Short versions are available online (https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/slow-unveiling-james-tiptree-jr/) but cannot begin to do the subject justice. I highly recommend Julie Phillips\u2019 award-winning biography James Tiptree, Jr., the Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon, which illustrates a life rich with contradictions, and with more twists and turns than a whodunnit.\n** The letter is held in the Special Collections of the Kenneth Spencer Research Library at the University of Kansas in the records of Tiptree\u2019s literary agent, Robert Mills (MS 307, Box 22, Folder 28).

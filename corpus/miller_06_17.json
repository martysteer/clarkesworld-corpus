Five of them, in her age range (ten to twelve). Facial scans confirm they have not yet given any cause for suspicion of potential strategic interest to the state. Subject shows clear anxiety at their presence. Debates departing. Decides attempting to exit would result in the unwanted attention from them that she hopes to avoid; remains.\n [Within these reports, S643 will hereafter be referred to as S1.]\n She is tall for her age. Thin. Her hair a modest Afro. Unclear if torn jeans the product of poverty or a fashion decision. Scabs on knees indicate that S1 is a skateboarding novice. The park where she sits is mostly pavement. A nook between two buildings, where curved benches attract bladers and boarders and taggers. She scratches at the clear polylactic coating on every surface. Graffiti-proof thermoplastic, but low quality, like everything in the non-pivotal municipalities, giving the park a pockmarked rotting quality.\n Six and a half minutes after their arrival, the boys begin to taunt her. Dialogue indistinguishable at this distance. Almost certainly the same handful of predictable insults. Girls don\u2019t skateboard, go the fuck home, etc. Software determines no need to move closer, or jump the mic on one of their phones or wearables.\n Subject 114 of Region 57 approaches. Nineteen; also tall for his age; flagged for surveillance at age seven following foster care incidents; probability of fire aptitude. Head shaved since last logged surveillance clip. Same T-shirt. Software demands an agent position shift, and mic jump. Agent moves car down the block. Submits retroactive warrant application. Rationale: non-authorized gathering of multiple variant individuals (adolescent).\n [Within these reports, S114 will hereafter be referred to as S2.]\n S2 towers over the other boys. The five fall silent.\n [Utterances captured through S2 cell phone mic]\n \u201cHey, Hector,\u201d one boy says. Awe all over his face.\n \u201cYou little assholes don\u2019t have anyone else to bother?\u201d\n They stare. Slack-jawed; perplexed.\n \u201cWhy do you think it is, that you need to make fun of girls? What do you think that says about you?\u201d\n \u201cShe can\u2019t skate,\u201d one says, the one who recognized S2.\n \u201cYour ass can\u2019t skate. And that\u2019s why you need to make other people feel like nothing.\u201d His voice drops; his eyes narrow. \u201cBecause nothing is exactly what you are.\u201d\n S1 tries to hide her smile. Soon the boys depart, chastened.\n \u201cI\u2019m Hector,\u201d S2 says.\n \u201cRyx,\u201d S1 says.\n \u201cShow me what you can do with that thing, Ryx.\u201d\n S1 stands, nods, steps onto her board. Starts a slow circle. Heel kick.\n S2 claps. His hands are huge and it sounds like earthquakes.\n Surveillance Clips S643/R57.D002-D006 [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n S1 and S2 meet up often. This is not cause for concern. There is no evidence of aptitude recognition, or intent to display or develop aptitudes, or premeditated gathering. In a city like this, where the cops have cracked down on most street and sidewalk skating, the spots where boarders can safely go are few. The old harbor, the fallen cathedral, the foundation pit where the hotel or mall was going to be.\n He teaches her tricks. Jesus Flip, Daydream Flip, Nightmare Flip. No Comply. Sex Change, 540, Ghetto Bird. Gazelle Spin.\n \u201cYou learn fast!\u201d he says, laughing with delight. \u201cLike, scary fast. How do you do that?\u201d\n She shrugs. She smiles. The smile does not last long. She is forever looking into the distance, staring down one street and then another. Like she\u2019s waiting for something to come, something awful. Something whose shape she won\u2019t know until she sees it.\n He scares her bullies away. He takes her places she\u2019d be afraid to go on her own.\n What does he get out of it? Cross reference of his case file shows no siblings, no lost little sister whose absence S1 softens.\n Day six: outside a coffee shop, across from the bronze horseman statue choked with thick vines from that time six years ago when a woman with a plant aptitude went into a summoning fugue that did not stop until she was gunned down. The parking lot is a slaughtered forest: a thousand incongruous species of tree and grass and flower and shrub, deadened by municipal defoliant. S2 says: \u201cLook.\u201d\n A man sits on the sidewalk. His mouth is open. His beard is wild and twisted and studded with rubble. Around his neck is a psionic surge shock collar. An old model, court-mandated, removable only upon a judge\u2019s order. Heavy; filth-crusted. He looks up at them and tries to smile.\n Hector S2 looks away in fear and pity. Ryx S1 stares, her eyes hardening. Then they turn. Their eyes lock. Their shared expression\u2014not quite a smile, not quite a suppressed shriek\u2014confirms that each knows very well what the other is.\n Surveillance Clip S643/R57.D015 [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n S1\u2019s home life offers no evidence of aptitude display. No record of any aunt or grandmother with a knack for taking memories or shaping clouds. Mother missing; father overworked; cousins and neighborhood children uncomfortable around her. Principals perplexed. Authorities alerted. A banal, familiar pattern.\n S2\u2019s family tree is full of unwholesome fruit. Habitual, cultivated aptitudes are everywhere. Unrepentant mind turners and metal summoners, deploying their aptitudes in a wide array of criminal endeavors. Men and women in jail, general population or special facilities with cells of wood or rubber or underground ice. Uncles on the run. His mother a confirmed shifter, presently believed to be living as a stout blond Alaskan crab boatman. Against this backdrop, S2\u2019s modest and mostly-accidental displays seem harmless, pathetic. Unworthy of surveillance.\n On the outside wall of the Firestone Hotel, on an HD paint screen six stories tall, the season finale of Psion Prime America is playing. A cool summer night; the crowd on the steeply-sloping lawn is immense. My Agent\u2019s screen pings a hundred different known aptitude possessors, and twice that number of people flagged for probability.\n S1\u2019s eyes are wide. She has never looked so much like the ten-year-old that she is.\n In split screen, the finalists duel. A leather-draped thirteen-year-old Black girl moves her hands and water spirals around her. Cameras zoom in to catch the fractal detail, the eerie patterns that shift and swell. A chubby bearded child smiles and spreads his arms. Fire forms between them. The fire becomes faces, figures.\n \u201cWhy is this even allowed?\u201d S1 asks, her face flushed, at the commercial break. \u201cThey talk so much about how we\u2019re a menace. How we need to be . . . I don\u2019t know. Registered. Rounded up. All those things they say.\u201d\n \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d S2 says. He hands her his bag of popcorn. She shrugs. \u201cThink about it.\u201d\n After a long time, and with a certain sadness, she says \u201cSo they know who we are.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s part of it.\u201d\n He waits. The break ends. Clips play, the finalists\u2019 highlights from the whole season. Water and fire, at war, in love.\n \u201cSo we won\u2019t know how much they hate us,\u201d he says. \u201cSo everyone will see how well they treat us.\u201d\n Her fists tighten.\n \u201cYou talk about your dad a lot,\u201d S2 says, carefully, like something he\u2019d been mulling over how to mention. \u201cWhat about your mom? If you don\u2019t mind my asking.\u201d\n \u201cGone,\u201d she says. \u201cCouple years back.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be. My mom watches out for me.\u201d\n He nods.\n \u201cI know it sounds stupid. Like the thing everybody says, when they\u2019ve been abandoned. But it\u2019s true. I know it. I feel it. She . . . senses me. No matter where I am. Where she is.\u201d\n \u201cWe should find her,\u201d S2 says.\n The winner is the one who S1 was rooting for. On the screen she makes monsters, fearsome beasts made of water, who fight and then embrace and become one. S1 stands, howls. S2 buys her popcorn. A fellow fangirl on the grass not far from them calls out: \u201cAnd she\u2019s from a non-pivotal region, just like us!\u201d\n \u201cThe feds might have forgotten about us,\u201d someone else says. \u201cBut there\u2019s a hell of a lot of us out here, and we can do some pretty amazing shit.\u201d\n Drunks and teenagers debate the pros and cons of the Tourniquet; of targeted austerity and the so-called law-and-order states. S1 does not appear to grasp much of it, but she listens hard.\n When it\u2019s over, and most of the crowd has gone, they practice the tricks he has taught her. Sigma Flip; Gingersnap; Nuclear Grab. A line of skater boys watches. All five of the ones who made fun of her earlier are there. Their mouths are open, but they have nothing to say.\n Surveillance Clip S643/R57.D018 [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n \n The girl is good.\n \n S1 is a fast learner, seeming to suck up skill through osmosis. When S2 does jump tricks, he has this slight upward tilt to his hands. Utterly idiosyncratic; no one else does this. But S1 does. S2\u2019s eyebrows unite in perplexed happiness.\n They are hard to track, now. They move fast from spot to spot. Like they are looking for someone, or several someones. Difficult to follow unobtrusively. They say little. Mic jumps yield nothing but background noise and skateboard wheels spinning. Cross reference of their geocache tracks to known routes of illegal activity among variant individuals shows minimal overlap.\n There are no files on her mother. This is unusual enough to be a cause of some concern. Cooperation requests submitted to partner agencies in several allied nations tasked with tracking variant individuals.\n \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she says, her voice full of frustration. You can hear how her feet hurt, how her bruised body protests. Twilight deepens. They are way out, tonight. The freeway is a dull roar at the horizon. Past that there is nothing, nothing but nature. She frowns at where the sun set. Other cities lie in that direction. Other countries. She wonders, maybe, whether it\u2019s different, there. For people like her.\n \u201cGot any money?\u201d\n \u201cTwo dollars.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got seventy-five cents,\u201d he says.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not very much.\u201d\n He watches her. He waits. Finally, he says \u201cIf we had fifty more cents, we could each get a slice of pizza and a soda.\u201d\n \u201cUh huh,\u201d she says. She sits down on her skateboard. Pouts. \u201cAnd if we had a hundred more dollars we could each get a damn mani-pedi.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re awful young to be so cynical,\u201d says S2, dropping to kneel beside her. \u201cHow\u2019d you get like that?\u201d\n She shrugs.\n \u201cDon\u2019t focus on what we don\u2019t have,\u201d he says, and there is something in his voice, something she can hear, something that might even show up on the recording. An urgency, a rawness, a frankness. Maybe something more. Something variant. \u201cFocus on what we have. And what we need. There\u2019s a solution, here.\u201d\n She frowns. Crosses her arms across her chest.\n \u201cWhat if I told you there were nickels, all over this parking lot?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not going on a damn Easter egg hunt for some invisible coins that probably aren\u2019t even there.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re there,\u201d he said. \u201cI see two, right over there.\u201d\n She looks where he points. \u201cCouple of cans,\u201d she mutters, and then smiles. Her face opens, comes alive. \u201cCans! We can pick up cans and bottles and redeem them at the supermarket!\u201d\n His hands clap.\n S2 finds a tattered plastic bag. S1 picks up their first two cans. Back on their boards, they hurry on in search of more.\n They are children. Whatever else they are.\n They pass between rows of jagged jutting spikes of pavement. Some are five stories high. An event record check turns up nothing, which might mean unrecorded gang activity\u2014a battle between people with earth aptitudes, perhaps\u2014or might mean an assassination attempt by this Bureau, subsequently covered up. A skewered Dodge truck dangles twenty feet from the ground. They are careful not to pass beneath it.\n Later on, when it\u2019s dark and no one can see, the municipal worker variants will come through. They\u2019ll shrink the pavement thorns down to nothing. Their eyes will be haunted, pained. Like mine.\n \u201cMy mom,\u201d she says, an hour later, when the bottles are redeemed and the pizza is bought and consumed.\n \u201cWhat about her?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cShe\u2019s why. How I got so cynical.\u201d\n \u201cAh,\u201d S2 says, and smiles. She must realize, in this moment, how rare his smiles are. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d\n \u201cShe was angry, all the time. Being around her was like living with wasps.\u201d\n \u201cDid she ever . . . \u201d\n \u201cHurt me,\u201d S1 says, like of course that question came next. \u201cNo. She was never physical with her anger. And she never directed it at us. Just, everything made her mad. All the stuff about how we live. What they do to us.\u201d\n \u201cWas she . . . \u201d\n \u201cLike you and me?\u201d S1 blots her lips with a napkin and scans the parking lot, like she\u2019d be able to spot someone if they were listening. Even looks up at the stabbed-to-death truck. \u201cRefused to get tested. Wouldn\u2019t have let them test me, if it wasn\u2019t for some stuff that happened at school. Then she didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter. Like what happened with you.\u201d\n S2 looks wounded, shocked. He opens his mouth to ask How did you know that, but then he shuts it. In that instant, and for the next several minutes, he looks like the younger one. The fragile one.\n \u201cSo now you know,\u201d he says, after taking a long sip from his empty soda can.\n \u201cKnow what? How to pick up dirty cans?\u201d\n \u201cNow you know you\u2019re never out of options.\u201d\n She smiles. Then she stops. \u201cMom said they\u2019d always be watching me.\u201d\n \u201cSo what if they are?\u201d\n \u201cSo no matter what we do, they see it. So there\u2019s no way out. So, it\u2019s not true that we\u2019re never out of options. We don\u2019t have any at all, except stupid ones, like whether to starve or pick up fucking bottles.\u201d\n S2 watches her face, possibly wondering whether it\u2019s her mother\u2019s anger he sees there.\n They head back. They\u2019re halfway there, beneath the big office buildings of downtown, weaving between the rose bushes that spring from nothing in the space of a day\u2014whose flowers bloom bright blue and green, and glow in the dark, and dance to soft music from speakers in the sidewalk, an astonishing horticultural display summoned up by well-paid closely-watched variant laborers\u2014when Hector S2 turns to her and says:\n \u201cThere\u2019s ways out. My friend Timothy, he got out.\u201d\n She slows to smell a flower, and doesn\u2019t say a thing.\n \u201cYour mom, right? Her too?\u201d\n \u201cThey smell gross,\u201d she says, swatting the rose away. \u201cLike meat.\u201d\n Surveillance Clip S643/R57.D021-23 [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n They spend several days at central station. On the sidewalk outside the main exit, scanning the faces of everyone who emerges. Looking for her mother? For this Timothy? Some fugitive member of his family; one of his several dangerous Known Associates? They say less and less, as time goes by.\n So many people seem to know S2. They come by, slap hands, smile, exchange words. Moving fast, never stopping more than three seconds, like they know precisely how long it takes the bureau software to clock their identity and bounce it off the variant registry. Lovestruck boys, mostly. Young as she is, S1 has got to see the crushes they all have on him. She can see it in the swift familiar rise-and-fall each face follows, from rapture upon arrival to devastation at departure. She can see it in S2, after, the way he stands up straighter, his charisma validated, his loneliness underscored.\n Messages are being passed. This is a certainty. Scraps of paper smeared with data gel; wireless device chatter across encrypted channels; meaningful glances that confirm whether meetings took place or escapees eluded capture. Requests for additional surveillance agents to pursue these strays have gone unanswered. It\u2019s an erroneous prioritization of bureau resources, following the letter of the law by restricting scrutiny to people for whom probable cause can be established via legal confirmation of variant status. S2 stands at the center of something, some network of mutual aid and enhancement.\n The chatter bots have nothing concrete. A whole lot of ellipses that add up to nothing. Even the bureau\u2019s in-house variants are stymied. Moments like these highlight the agony of our their position within law enforcement work\u2014caught between two worlds, hated by the one they came from and mistrusted by the one they chose.\n Surveillance Clip S643/R57.D024 [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n Rain.\n S1 will spend the whole day in the library, as she generally does when it rains. S2 never shows up in wet weather. Agent sets an ambient monitor on the library\u2019s mesh network speakers, keys it to her sonic signature, and heads for bureau regional office #57.\n A third request for an analysis meeting has been denied. Supervisor maintains that overwork is the sole cause of these denials. Every agent has too many targets; every supervisor has too many agents. On a fourth request, agent flags probationary status, and lack of clarity around surveillance target\u2019s strategic value, as cause for meeting priority. This, too, is denied.\n \n Bureau office smells and looks like the underside of a freeway cloverleaf. Agent walks in the door and immediately remembers why they never come here, and why the people who work out of this space always sound so angry when one calls the office. Agent wonders whether the offices are any nicer, in the pivotal municipalities. If we get decent coffee and fresh coats of paint, outside the Tourniquet.\n \n Agent spends an hour and a half, waiting outside supervisor\u2019s office. Drinks bad coffee; chats up supervisor\u2019s receptionist (who is resistant to chatting up); revisits highlights of S2\u2019s surveillance file. Strings together short video clips of skateboarding highlights.\n \n Supervisor is visibly displeased, to emerge from his office and find agent waiting. Yells.\n \n Supervisor commits to address agent concerns at next quarterly of all eighteen field agents under his supervision. This meeting is eight weeks away.\n In elevator, on the way out, agent impulsively presses the button for the eighth floor. When the doors open, the hospital smell of it momentarily overwhelms. A woman stands there, eyes shut, arms out, leaning back; a statue, an angel on the nod. Scabs around her lips pucker when she smiles.\n The bureau\u2019s in-house methadone clinic isn\u2019t at the top of its list of dirty secrets, but it isn\u2019t far from the top either. An ugliness necessitated by the staggering rates of addiction among variant employees, who were too often subject to compromise or memory theft at public clinics. Drugs use is disproportionately high among variant individuals. The disruptor epidemic hit us hard.\n The waiting room is crowded. It always is, on cold days. Bureau wages are rarely sufficient to cover the cost of both rent and of addiction. Agent prowls through the room, and doesn\u2019t have to look for long before finding a familiar face. A code-monkey variant he was in the academy with. Computer workers always have that same haunted look in their faces. Who knows why.\n \n Small talk ensues; how have you been and what is exciting in the work these days.\n \n \u201cI\u2019m tailing this girl,\u201d agent finally gets around to saying. \u201cBut I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why. She\u2019s a kid, with no known friends or associates or family connections of strategic value. Variant, but totally banal as far as I can tell. Any chance you can check up on her?\u201d\n Agent\u2019s old associate complies.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one,\u201d she says, after what seems like not long enough.\n \u201cHow so?\u201d\n \u201cPredictives have positioned her at the nexus of several probable events.\u201d\n \u201cPredictive . . . variants? People who can see the future?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any precogs. They\u2019re incredibly rare. Rumor has it, China has two\u2014born at the exact same moment, a thousand miles apart. Predictives means predictive computer programming. Probability modeling software. Risk assessment.\u201d\n Agent tries not to roll his eyes. \u201cThose things are so ridiculous. I seem to recall a certain politician who squandered a twelve point lead by letting software set his strategy\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThis is different. If I do say so myself, our programming variants have come up with some pretty spooky algorithms. They can sift through a million different camera feeds, social media profiles, geolocation data, come up with some pretty crazy accurate predictions. Traffic jams\u2014they aren\u2019t chaos, they\u2019re actually surprisingly easy to anticipate if you have enough data. Drivers who tend to shift lanes abruptly, plus drivers who are prone to extreme anger, plus drivers who have a habit of driving while intoxicated . . . who commute via the north shore expressway . . . who leave the office early on Fridays . . . it\u2019s crazy. And they see big things in store for your little girl.\u201d\n \u201cWell shit. Why aren\u2019t politicians using that? And, uh, the military, corporations . . . \u201d\n \u201cThey are\u2014in Sweden, Ghana, Myanmar\u2014any of the places where variants aren\u2019t persecuted and culturally stigmatized into ghettoes and addiction and suicide. Buy me a drink sometime and I\u2019ll tell you all my thoughts on the subject. I know, I know, I\u2019m barking up the wrong tree here. Short version: the agency keeps its predictives to itself, and everyone is pretty happy with that arrangement. The last bureau chief tried to share it intergovernmentally, and found no takers. Tried to give it to private industry and got threatened with arrest by the prosecutor general. Government property, after all.\u201d\n Agent is bored; does not try to hide it. \u201cBut what does it say about her? What big things are in store?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s weird. It\u2019s a configuration I haven\u2019t seen before. But it\u2019s big. Like, paradigm-shift big.\u201d\n \u201cBottom line is, I\u2019m stuck following a prepubescent girl around all day because a computer program created by drug addicts said I should?\u201d\n She shrugs. She is not smiling.\n S1 is still there, when agent returns to library. He pulls her search history from the computer she logged in on. They sadden him, and then they frighten him.\n variant individuals origin theoriesvariant cure facilitiesvariant torture pornvariant pridevariant pride association\n \n Agent has to fight very hard to keep from hugging her, telling her everything will be okay. The only reason he succeeds in stopping himself is that he doesn\u2019t actually believe that it will be. \n \n Surveillance Clip S643/R57.D026 [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n S2 is smart. He takes his device battery out, when he is home. None of his networkables are networked. Agent is forced to resort to mic-jumping the phones and speakers of his upstairs and downstairs and next-door neighbors, then running all four feeds through a dozen different filters to get a very broad sense of what S2 is doing in there. Coffee is made; a toilet is flushed. Then he turns on his music and it all goes to shit. Sometimes it sounds like he is crying, prone on the floor, on his back, with a pillow pressed to his face, but that could just be some weird sound effect in the background of a song.\n His searches are secret. His cynicism is smarter than hers. He knows we are watching.\n Who is he crying for?\n Surveillance Clip S643/R57.D027 [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n Rain again. Probably for the first time, it occurs to her to wonder what he does, those wet days. She goes to his apartment. Skates slowly. Enjoying the downpour. She is drenched through by the time she arrives. She keeps her device on. He hugs her, hard. She laughs, tells him he\u2019ll get all wet. In his sadness, in his happiness at her arrival, he forgets to make her take the battery out of her device.\n The depth of detail is glorious. Like seeing for the first time. Agent sends spatial echoconfiguration pings, which map the room in immaculate detail, which for so long has evaded me this agent.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cRain always gets me down.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s cool. Wanna watch a movie?\u201d\n \u201cSure. Something fucking gruesome.\u201d\n \u201cTotally.\u201d\n He is not sober. She sees and hears it right away. They sit on the floor in front of the couch. She points at something on the floor, five red cylinders on a handkerchief. \u201cIs that?\u201d\n \u201cDisruptors, yeah.\u201d She must notice the shame in his voice.\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t mess around with that stuff.\u201d\n Ryx S1 sounds like she\u2019s had to have this conversation before, with other older people who really ought to know better.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t do them. I just . . . \u201d\n \u201cDid you used to do them?\u201d\n \u201cFor a little while.\u201d\n \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s Timothy,\u201d he says. His back is to her. He can\u2019t see the photo she\u2019s holding, but he knows which one it is.\n \u201cThe one who got out.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d he says.\n \u201c . . . how?\u201d\n She is afraid to ask the question. You can hear it in her voice. She knows the answer hurts. She knows he is already hurting. She hears it in his.\n \u201cJumped off the blue bridge. Broke both legs when he hit the water. Drowned.\u201d\n She hugs him from behind.\n \u201cWater was his thing. His aptitude. We used to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSo that\u2019s why you hate the rain.\u201d\n A whisper: \u201cThat\u2019s why I hate getting wet.\u201d\n \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you bought those disruptors.\u201d\n A nod. \u201cFor when it rains.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful. You were beautiful, together.\u201d\n A nod. \u201cHe\u2019s like your mom, now.\u201d\n She frowns.\n \u201cThey don\u2019t leave us,\u201d S2 says. \u201cThey\u2019re part of us, always. Separation is an illusion. Do you understand?\u201d\n Something is happening. Something we can\u2019t see.\n \u201cI guess,\u201d she says, after a while.\n A knock on the door. The boy on the other side of it is bashful, scruffy, multiply pierced. Flame tattoos lick his fingers. His forearms are whirlwinds of fire and muscle. He sees Hector S2 and for a second his face is all need, lust, loneliness, separation, and then he sees S1.\n \u201cOh, hey,\u201d he says. \u201cSorry. Didn\u2019t know you had company.\u201d\n \u201cHey, Kevv,\u201d S2 says. \u201cKevv, this is Ryx. She\u2019s a friend of mine.\u201d\n S1 is off-balance, still. Reeling. Blinking. \u201cHey.\u201d\n \u201cWe were just doing some augmentation work.\u201d\n \u201cOh, right on,\u201d Kevv says, smiling, nodding, backing up. [Cross reference: Surveillance File on Subject #644 of Region #57] \u201cWell I\u2019ll, you know, come around a little later maybe.\u201d\n \u201cGreat,\u201d S2 says. They high five. Kevv makes a face like a puppy might make. S1 takes his hand, impulsively, as he exits, and holds on to it for a full five seconds.\n \u201cSee you around.\u201d\n \u201cNice to meet you, Ryx,\u201d he says, and is gone.\n Agent searches for augmentation; variant augmentation; variant aptitude augmentation. Finds nothing. Flags for follow-up.\n S1 says \u201cYou attract all kinds of strays.\u201d\n \u201cShut up.\u201d\n When the movie is over, she says \u201cI\u2019m taking these.\u201d She wraps the red cylinders up in a paper towel and puts them in her back pocket.\n \u201cWait,\u201d he says. \u201cThose were expensive. At least let me try to sell them back to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNope,\u201d she says. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n He smiles. She goes.\n I Agent could grab her, now. Variant in possession of disruptors; she\u2019d be fifty before she got out of jail. I watch Agent watches her go; sees what Hector S2 sees, in the set of her jaw and the light in her eyes; sees, also, maybe, what those spooky algorithms saw, when they peered into her future. Agent knows that nothing he does could ever cage her, not really, no matter how small a box he put her in.\n Surveillance Clip S643/R57.D028 [FINAL DAY OF SURVEILLANCE DETAIL PRIOR TO AGENT REASSIGNMENT] [File Uploaded]Human Agent Summary\n The city is still soaking wet. It stinks of rust and mud. At three in the morning a hundred agents carried out simultaneous raids on eighteen known bases of one of the leading variant triads, and now the city is strewn with blood and broken glass. Green; blue; red; white. Glass stalactites dangle from streetlights. Massive glass sea urchins seem to have swallowed up cars, storefronts, trees. A fine deadly dust has settled over everything, and diamond-bright shards catch the sun. Some pieces are as big as trucks. Hipsters take photos. Moms swat the fingers of kids who try to pick up the prettiest specimens.\n S1 and S2 follow a dump truck and a fire truck west. Municipal workers in special suits gather up the big pieces, hose away the small ones. S2 explains new skateboard tricks as they move through the path they clear. The old lovely names, familiar as prayer:\n Acid Drop. Egg Plant. Sad Plant.\n Blunt, Boneless, Darkslide.\n It\u2019s unclear, how it happens. What agent lapse let this transpire. Exhaustion is the probable answer. The horrific insomnia, after the previous day\u2019s surveillance. Studying up on augmentation. The theories. Possible variant aptitudes never before seen, or mistaken for something else. The idea that some variants might have the aptitude of giving other variants additional aptitudes, or of magnifying existing ones. Agent stayed up all night, researching. Scouring S2\u2019s files. Stringing together clips and close-ups of him. Telling himself, Separation is an illusion.\n Agent should have known better. Agent knew that S1 is not like other variants, that something was different, special, about her, and to proceed with greater caution.\n Agent got too close. Simple as that.\n S1 stops.\n \u201cIt\u2019s like a Nuclear Grab,\u201d S2 says. \u201cExcept instead of\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSh!\u201d she says, and turns around. He turns around too.\n \u201cThat car,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been following us.\u201d\n Agent knows he should turn and go. Cut and run. But if he does, she\u2019ll know we\u2019ve been surveilling her.\n \u201cLeave it alone,\u201d S2 says. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she says, and skates, fast. Agent goes to put the car in reverse and finds that he cannot move. She is coming, and he is following her, and agent is trapped, can\u2019t move, can\u2019t blink.\n \u201cHey!\u201d she calls. \u201cI see you!\u201d\n Agent\u2019s eyes grow dry. His door is unlocked. He can\u2019t lock it. He is breathing, but barely. She steps off the skateboard, picks it up, swings it, shatters the glass of the driver-side window. Grabs his hooded sweatshirt.\n S2 arrives, stands beside her. \u201cRyx, come on, we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n He sees the man in the car, the small helpless cowardly creature frozen solid by S1\u2019s aptitude. One of her aptitudes. One of her many. Hector\u2019s mouth opens. His voice is very small when he says:\n \u201cTimothy?\u201d\n \n Ryx has me. I can\u2019t move. She fills me up. Sees me, utterly, completely. And I see her. She is so much more than the little girl I\u2019ve been watching. She contains so much.\n \n \n She takes hold of Hector. Builds a bridge between us. We are one, the three of us, and it feels so good I am sobbing in seconds.\n \n \n She speaks without speaking: \u201cThis is him?\u201d\n \n \n Hector nods. He is crying too.\n \n \n She isn\u2019t.\n \n \n \u201cHe thought you were dead,\u201d she says to me.\n \n \n \u201cAgency faked it,\u201d I say, without wanting to, because I cannot lie, cannot refuse to answer, I am hers, his, we are one, and how can I keep secrets from myself? I\u2019ve spent years trying, and failing, and slowly dying because of it. \u201cStandard practice for variant agents.\u201d\n \n \n \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014an agent,\u201d he says. His disappointment is utter, entire. It breaks me.\n \n \n \u201cI did it for you,\u201d I say. \u201cTo keep you safe. They were going to get you. I cut a deal.\u201d\n \n \n He nods. I\u2019d do anything to convince him, but I don\u2019t need to. We are one, now, and he can see that I\u2019m telling the truth. And I can see that it doesn\u2019t matter.\n \n \n \u201cYou fuck over your own people. You help them hunt us, lock us up, put fucking psionic surge fucking shock collars on us\u2014you\u2014\u201d\n \n \n He gasps, moans, droops, like he\u2019s about to collapse. She holds his body tight.\n \n \n He sees the truth. All of it. My selflessness, but also my selfishness. My cowardice. My inability to imagine a good life for us. Being what we are. Being what I am. Seeing so few ways out\u2014suicide, addiction, a life of crime, treason against my people. Choosing the paycheck, the safe pensioned life of a vicious dog helping its masters hurt my own kind.\n \n \n I could never see the way out Hector saw. Pride and power and revolution. The way out he showed to Ryx.\n \n \n I see his memories of us. Our bodies, hot and hungry, twisted together, on clean sheets on a dirty floor, hear his low gravel whisper reading from the Upanishads, \u201cas a man in the arms of his beloved is not aware of what is without and what is within, so one in union with the Self is not aware of what is without and what is within, for in that state all desires are fulfilled.\u201d I see us skateboarding in the rain. Kissing in the river. I see his memories sicken, darken, grow brittle. Die.\n \n \n \u201cWhat else have you got in there,\u201d she says, and looks deeper, sees the faces of all my colleagues, the ones who faked their deaths and the undercovers in the triads and the pride associations, and he sees them too, sees friends, sees comrades.\n \n \n Her eyes narrow. She sees deeper. The spooky algorithms, the computer programs that sifted through the little bit of life she\u2019d lived and saw that she\u2019d run into him, eventually, two skateboarding orphans, one with a wide network of friends and accomplices. She sees the paradigm shift she stands at the center of.\n \n \n \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell anyone what we know, now. Right? That wouldn\u2019t go so well for you.\u201d\n \n \n \u201cNo,\u201d I say.\n \n \n \u201cYou\u2019ll delete all this from the report.\u201d\n \n \n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \n \n She smiles. She shows me herself, and him.\n \n \n Fire is only one of Hector\u2019s aptitudes. He didn\u2019t know it until he met her, until she showed him himself. He can strengthen, magnify. He strengthened mine. He magnified me.\n \n \n And Ryx. She can take, and she can share. She has a dozen aptitudes already, maybe more. She knew it, but until she met Hector she didn\u2019t know what that could mean. What they could do with such a thing. Now she gives them out to every variant she meets. Even that boy Kevv, the day before, Hector\u2019s latest lovelorn fellow revolutionary, in their brief handshake.\n \n \n Ryx grins, at my jealousy, at my ineluctable loneliness, and water rises from a puddle beside my car. Forms a bubble, studded with broken glass. She has my water aptitude now, on top of everything else.\n \n \n Her hands drop.\n \n Hector\u2019s face slowly settles. Becomes less red. Stops trembling. Agent doesn\u2019t I don\u2019t look away. My mouth opens. Nothing comes out.\n \n I should shoot her. I know what it is, now, what she can do, what she\u2019ll accomplish.\n \n \n I should report her, at least. Someone other than me needs to know.\n \n \n I can\u2019t do any of that.\n \n \n I can barely keep from throwing up.\n \n \u201cCome on,\u201d Ryx says, and takes his hand, and she is strong, strong enough for both of them, for all of them.\n They turn and go.\n The noise at the end of the clip is skateboard wheels on wet pavement. Two sets of them. They sound like thunder, a long endless peal of it, rolling pitilessly away.\n Sam J. Miller is a writer and a community organizer.

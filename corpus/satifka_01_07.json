She finds him in the corner of the bar he goes to every night after work and stays in until it\u2019s time to go to work again, sucking on an electrical wire that stretches from the flaking wall.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to kill you any more,\u201d she says.\nHe ignores her, grinding sheathed copper between brown-stained molars.\n\u201cMy name is Linda Sue. I want to make babies with you.\u201d\n\u201cThat rhymes,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWill you do it or not?\u201d\n\u201cOr not.\u201d\nLinda Sue stamps her foot. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you out first. Then we\u2019ll see.\u201d He takes her by the hand and leads her out of the bar, out into the heart of downtown New York City.\nNew York City, population three hundred and twenty.\nHe guides her to a restaurant he knows where the food is stacked in piles on hygienic white counters and the electricity works. She has two eyes and two hands and one set of lips, which means she is pretty. They each take a few slabs of food\u2014the food here is free\u2014and sit on the ground. He tells her about his life and her eyes open wide as headlights.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone who had a job before.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a job. It\u2019s a career.\u201d He works at a factory, pouring liquid plastic into molds shaped like four-tined forks. \u201cI have a quota to fill.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask the Ganys for plastic forks? Why does someone need so many plastic forks anyway\u201d She tears off a corner of her foodslab; it comes off onto her fingers like cotton candy. Or insulation.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not for me, they\u2019re for people.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to work. I don\u2019t like to. I just ask the Ganys for everything. They like to give us stuff.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t ask them.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think about the creatures dancing spider-like on his nerve. \u201cI\u2019m self-sufficient.\u201d\n\u201cAre we going to fuck or what?\u201d\n\u201cLater, later. If you\u2019re good.\u201d\nIn Central Park they walk past a rusted-over carousel. She\u2019s drunk from the amber-colored alcohol-infused drinkslab she\u2019s consumed, and he\u2019s propping her up, forcing her to walk straight.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d she slurs.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what that word means.\u201d\nThey pass a pair of Ganys wrapped in the form of two wall-eyed Jamaican teenagers, humans whose bodies were either sacrificed to or commandeered by the intelligent energy beams. The girls giggle and point as they pass. He flips them off.\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d\n\u201cThey patronize us. Don\u2019t you see how they patronize us? There\u2019s too many of them in this city. I want to get away from here, out into the country. Will you come with me?\u201d\n\u201cNobody lives in the country.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d But he knows it is pointless; nobody lives in the country because there is no way to live in the country. The farms are all poisoned and the shadow of the plague still lingers. The Ganys, knowing this, constructed an invisible olfactory wall, to keep humans and germs from mingling.\nHe will never leave New York City. Always a hotel, never a tourist.\nThe story of the plague goes like this:\nOnce you could be certain that you would not spontaneously grow legs from your shoulder blades and arms from your buttocks. You could be reasonably sure that ears would not sprout on your cheeks overnight. Then the plague happened, and you couldn\u2019t take that for granted anymore.\nUntil the Ganys came.\nThey get back to the bar and she takes off her clothes. Her ribs stick out like a xylophone. The foodslabs keep them alive, but they aren\u2019t the right kind of nourishment. But you couldn\u2019t expect intelligent energy beams to understand food.\nLinda Sue\u2019s body is fuzzy and indistinct, a peach-colored blur. His vision is cloudy from the tourists in his head. He crawls back to his corner.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to fuck me now? Aren\u2019t you going to give me my babies?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m still not ready.\u201d\n\u201cOh, screw you! You\u2019re crazy. Why don\u2019t you get the Ganys to fix that for you? They fixed it for me.\u201d\nNow all you want to do is mate, he thinks. Not make love, you can\u2019t love anymore. Mate with the last members of your species so you can bring us back from the brink of extinction. That\u2019s all it is.\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\nShe shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. I can find some other male to give me my babies. I don\u2019t need you.\u201d She slams the lockless door behind her. He hunkers down in the corner.\nHe awakes to unclouded vision. The vacationers checked out of his optic nerve as he slept. He rubs his empty eyes and stumbles to the corner market, where he throws down a few skins and picks up some foodslabs.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay for those,\u201d the Gany monitoring the electricity says.\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\nIt would be so easy, he thinks sometimes, to go down to the place where the Ganys congregate, the place where you can go rent your body for a day or a lifetime to their volunteers, and just turn yourself over. Shut off your brain for as long as you wanted, and you\u2019d get a nice pile of goodies when your assignment was over. But he\u2019d never done that. Renting his eyes was as far as he\u2019d go. And even that was done not out of love for the aliens or the desire for material objects but the knowledge that, if he did not do it, he would be marked a traitor and slated for commandeering.\nThe Ganys have taken a special interest in humans. They had cordoned them off in cities with invisible olfactory walls, so that the remaining humans would be able to find one another more easily. And of course, they had brought The Cure. All of it was done for our\u2014no, he thinks, their\u2014own good.\nHe takes a dramatic bow, as if addressing a live audience. And in a way, he is.\nHe\u2019s leaving the city today. He crams a stack of foodslabs into a looted knapsack and heads north on foot. He walks until the sun is directly overhead and then stops by a river to eat.\nThe river is contaminated; he can smell the plague in it, festering. But there are drinkslabs in his pack, too. He tears off a few chunks of the tasteless foam and presses on.\nA half hour later he is halted by a smell halfway between burning plastic and dog shit. I\u2019ve reached it, he thinks. The wall between New York City and the rest of the world. He holds his breath and trudges through the wall, but it in no use. He can\u2019t hold his breath forever. His chest deflates and the putrescent odor fills his nose and lungs, as if the dog shit is being shoveled into his mouth by the handful. He gags, and vomits up a piece of semi-digested foodslab. Choking, he runs out of the wall, and takes a whiff of pure air.\nHe didn\u2019t even make it past the fifty yard line.\nPlunging back in, he finds the smell has changed. Now it\u2019s the scent of burning tires. He moves to the right and hits a wall of solid rotting flowers. Moving forward, there is a stench like fish guts being baked in the sun. He stumbles backwards, and falls into the strong arms of a stranger.\n\u201cHello there, little guy,\u201d a park ranger says. He looks into the ranger\u2019s crossed and clouded eyes. A Gany.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get past the wall,\u201d he says. His eyes are running with tears and there is vomit on his chin.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out here all alone.\u201d The ranger gestures at his vehicle. \u201cC\u2019mon, let me give you a ride back home.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t want to take charity from a Gany, but he doesn\u2019t like the prospect of walking three and a half hours either, especially since he still can\u2019t breathe in all the way and his stomach feels swollen and fluttery. He gets in the vehicle.\n\u201cYou have a mate back at home?\u201d Of course, that\u2019s the first thing the ranger would say.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cHuman beings should be fruitful and multiply. It says so in your holy book.\u201d The Gany speaks with the friendly, homey Upper New York accent that was the ranger\u2019s voice when he was in control of the body, but he can sense the cold analytical tone of the intelligent energy beam guiding it.\nHe grunts and turns back to the window. Less than twenty minutes later the four-wheel-drive all-terrain vehicle pulls up in front of his bar. That fucking Gany read his mind.\n\u201cYou be safe now, partner.\u201d\nHe slams the door.\nIn the apartment building across the street two humans are mating. For a moment, he wonders what it would be like to forget everything, become a creature of instinct, every moment of your life unscripted and so automatic.\nThen he goes back into the bar.\nErica L.

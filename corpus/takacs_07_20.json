She wanted to finish her civics homework assignment fast. Just a few more hours, and then she would be done with everything that wasn\u2019t on the preengineering track. She could get back to what actually interested her, lose herself in that . . . Not now, she wrenched her thoughts back to her assignment. The attention shift was almost painful.\n Pick a high-importance political event in recent history. List three major stakeholders and present their viewpoints, with special attention to conflicts. It sounded hard. She was a math person, not even sure where to begin. She picked this event because it had happened shortly after Independence.\n The recording was three-dimensional, but relatively low resolution. Oy\u0101run watched, trying to recall some context that she could use for her assignment. At the time the recording had been made, beat-up space transports carrying refugees from the Empire were still streaming into the small planetoid of Eren, and a vote had just been passed to increase ambient gravity in living areas. People were still hammering out the political details of the new state; the High Council was yet unformed, existing only as an informal social conglomerate of like-minded leaders.\n These leaders were standing on a podium, surrounded by a vast crowd. Oy\u0101run only recognized some of them from her previous studies, and the person now moving to the front to speak was unfamiliar to her.\n She pulled up the annotations for the video, cross-referenced them with the Eren-wide social network. Aram\u012bn, also known as Armyn, formerly of the Imperial House of Gubhas on the High Plains of Emek. Male, living alone, not interested in\u2014she shooed away the panel. It was helpful to know he was still alive\u2014he wasn\u2019t in his elder years yet, but people had died in all sorts of accidents in the early days. She wasn\u2019t interested in his personal circumstances beyond that. She suddenly remembered something. Wasn\u2019t he one of the very few Imperial nobles who\u2019d supported independence?\n Aram\u012bn looked mixed, Imperial and Plainsfolk, possibly also Northerner. She couldn\u2019t make out the details of his face beyond his pale skin and his long black hair, carefully braided with thinner braids joining into three larger ones, hanging well past his shoulders on both sides, and\u2014she\u2019d seen when he turned around\u2014also along his back. A symbol of nobility. The video did not allow her to zoom in further, and she resisted requesting an interpolation; she could pull up his profile again later.\n She missed the first few sentences.\n \u201c . . . denounce oppression. Denounce subjugation. And take a firm stand.\u201d The crowd seemed restless, murmuring. Pulling at their scarves, scratching their heads under their caps. Aram\u012bn went on, speaking firmly and loudly, his voice carrying even past the amplification. \u201cImperial Seers were subjugated and forced to labor for the Court, the very same Court that declared a major cognotype to be Undesirable, its bearers to be eradicated from the gene pool. The same attitude undergirds both: a greed to prescribe value. A greed to be the only source of truth and justice. A greed.\u201d\n The crowd was quieting down. Paying attention? Oy\u0101run leaned forward, even though that wouldn\u2019t help her see better. She was intrigued.\n \u201cWe are all here together now. Undesirables and Seers, from all peoples of the Empire of the Three Stars, the Empire of Emek: Imperials, Worowans, Northerners, Plainsfolk, and more. And the people who have stood with Undesirables and Seers in solidarity.\u201d\n Aram\u012bn paused. Took a deep breath.\n \u201cYou all know that I am neither a Seer nor an Undesirable. Yet I chose to stand by the cause of independence. I am Armyn, formerly the head of a noble house, and head of the High Plains Research Institute. A surgeon, a medical scientist. I come from a high position. And more\u2014I supplied young Seers for the noble houses, I trained them and let them be eaten alive by the insatiable hunger of the Court, always desperate for more magic. Until those young Seers said no more. Until I said no more. Until we said no more. They rose up and I rose up. They spoke and I listened.\u201d\n A chill ran along Oy\u0101run\u2019s spine. Aram\u012bn spoke in an even tone, but he was brutally direct. People wouldn\u2019t speak about the war in such a straightforward way anymore. He went on, not backing down:\n \u201cI cannot claim to know what it is like to be a Seer. I never had to wear Seer\u2019s robes. I never had my head shaved, treated with a poison so that my hair would never grow out again, so that I would stand out in a crowd, so that I would not be able to escape, would not be able to hide.\n \u201cBut now we stand all together. On this land, this planetoid deemed uninhabitable by the Empire, we are equal.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run watched, entirely breathless, not even daring to fidget for fear that the magic of the moment would pass. Aram\u012bn went on.\n \u201cYet whenever you look at me, you see me\u2014and you see a symbol of Imperial might. You see my hair past my shoulders. You see a man who was never tortured. And you remember your pain.\u201d His voice lifted and lifted higher, working itself into a crescendo:\n \u201cI say we are equal, and my actions shall mirror my words. We shall all be equal, and I am willing to take the first step. We are not just Seer and not just Undesirable and not just anyone else\u2014we are all this and more, we are a people, a people arising from murder and bloodshed, a people arising from genocide, a people who have fought hard for our freedom.\u201d He dropped his voice abruptly, and spoke in a quiet, calm tone: \u201cAnd I shall be just like anyone else.\u201d\n Aram\u012bn raised a hand, a blade glinting into the camera for a moment. He cut off his thick braids, one by one, with motions that seemed impossibly practiced. With an economy of gesture. He turned to one of his fellow councilpeople, someone Oy\u0101run recognized: Esokaruwe, a former Imperial Seer and a leader of resistance fighters. A fearsome warrior.\n \u201cEsteemed Esokaruwe, if you please.\u201d He handed the blade to her. Esokaruwe seemed stunned, then began to cut his hair, confused, hands moving slowly, jaggedly. Oy\u0101run thought she must not have been privy to Aram\u012bn\u2019s plan.\n It took a while. Esokaruwe steeled herself, tensed her muscles as she worked, hacking away at the remaining hair, shaving Aram\u012bn\u2019s scalp. Then Aram\u012bn turned to her and said something in an undertone, too quiet for the camera to pick up. She gestured for him to turn around and passed her hands slowly over his scalp. Oy\u0101run could not sense it through the recording, but she knew that Esokaruwe was using the m\u0101wal to scour Aram\u012bn\u2019s head. He would not grow hair again. Oy\u0101run ran a hand along her own hairless scalp, in an attempt to ground herself in physical reality. But she wouldn\u2019t pause the recording. She had to see it all for herself.\n The other councilpeople who hadn\u2019t been Seers were already lining up, dazed and shocked, milling in place. Limbs twitching as they waited for their turn. Aram\u012bn had not run this by them, Oy\u0101run thought. But she knew this had been the moment when Ereni became Ereni; from the disparate groups of Seers and Undesirables and whoever else had escaped to the planetoid with them, one united people began forming at this very instant. Blades flashed here and there among the crowd, and slowly, people removed their head coverings. Some were bald former Seers, stunned by the sudden turn of events wrenched out of their course that even their precognition had not foreseen. Others were Undesirables of various ethnicities, uncomfortable, but willing to join the Seers. Cutting their hair in silence, with only the low murmurs of people asking each other for help. Making a point of solidarity. With all the weapons in the crowd, there was not a moment of violence. Oy\u0101run watched, breathless, until the video finished playing.\n It had to happen. Oy\u0101run had read a lot about the tensions between the two groups, threatening to drive apart the newly founded Free State of Eren. But she\u2019d never before realized that it was someone who was neither a Seer nor an Undesirable who\u2019d forced the issue.\n An Imperial noble who felt entitled enough to do so.\n Who shaped history.\n This was not the history Oy\u0101run had been taught. And she needed, desperately needed, to know more.\n I.\n 1.\n \u201cAram\u012bn is . . . people will say he\u2019s a sadist and a Falconer, I know. And I suppose some of that is true. But he\u2019s also a brilliant surgeon, and a researcher, and . . . [P: 0.8v] Not what you expect from a noble. We all . . . [P: 0.5v] [to say] liked him might be too strong . . . [but] we appreciated him, certainly. All the folk up in HPR.\u201d\u2014Amasewun ta Yowasiru, Ereni Oral History Archives, War of Independence database, 32:11/23-EOF\n Oy\u0101run looked up from the database and sighed. Of all the topics in the world, her mind had to fix itself upon Aram\u012bn, well after she\u2019d finished her homework and garnered an uncommon amount of praise from her teacher. This went beyond usual abuwen, special interests like floater races, public transport, or space weather\u2014no, it had to be a person, a living person, a public figure, and Aram\u012bn at that. Oy\u0101run knew some people had specific persons as their abuwen, and that this phenomenon was slightly more common among girls, but still she wished she could be somehow more ordinary. At least Aram\u012bn did not displace her primary abuwen, paper folding. Yet.\n Her fingers worked through the familiar motions and one of her special creations took shape in her hands\u2014the paper airplane that set the Eren-wide record of time aloft. It wasn\u2019t such a big deal: other than her, there were only seven people on the planetoid interested in paper airplanes, they didn\u2019t have a large enough hangar to practice airplane throwing, the air conditions could not be adjusted precisely enough . . . and so on. Still, she was proud of the accomplishment. It wasn\u2019t a special accomplishment\u2014it didn\u2019t improve on their living conditions or the volatile political situation, it didn\u2019t garner a lot of public interest, it didn\u2019t even help her find a career path. But at least it wasn\u2019t actively harmful.\n She was beginning to suspect that her interest in Aram\u012bn would prove to be actively harmful. He was a Falconer, people said\u2014another cognotype just as undesirable as the Undesirable one, the one that became the Ereni cognotype upon Independence. Her own cognotype. But Falconers were supposed to be dangerous in comparison, even if they weren\u2019t formally persecuted; maybe only because the Empire could not quite pin down the genetic basis to do so. Or maybe because there were fewer of them? She didn\u2019t know. She wasn\u2019t sure where the name had come from, either\u2014people commonly said that Falconers were more like falcons, merciless birds of prey. Cognotypes generally weren\u2019t named after animals, though she wasn\u2019t sure she could list some of the less common ones. She had never been interested in this topic. The Jaya cognotype was named after a researcher, but before that, hadn\u2019t it been named after some kind of small animal? She vaguely recalled people protesting about that, and she agreed with them. But no one was protesting about \u201cFalconer.\u201d She felt uneasy that she hadn\u2019t considered this before; she\u2019d accepted everything at face value. Was this the goal of her civics assignments\u2014questioning social assumptions?\n She could not stop thinking of Aram\u012bn. Was it this aspect of danger that he held in himself that allowed him to take that step? To force his will on a dithering, unformed High Council? Certainly, in the interest of equality and justice, but still . . . All that just to leave politics soon after?\n Oy\u0101run turned around in her seat and threw the plane at the wall. Hard. It crumpled and fell to the floor of her small room. She turned back to the wall, closed her eyes, and rubbed first her temples, then her scalp. She pulled her soft cotton cap back on, sighed, and submerged in the data supplied by her neural interface.\n The more she read, the more certain she was that her abuwen was destructive and wrong. Most of the interviewees in the archives who talked about Aram\u012bn were still alive, and she knew she could seek them out. Eren was a small place. They might even indulge her. But the interviews made her think it would be a bad idea to try to elicit information from these people. For the time being, she fiddled with the data at hand.\n Interviews were the kind of soft qualitative data that were so hard to tackle, unlike air humidity or paper thickness. Still, she persevered. The interviews could be grouped into two categories, very sharply defined. People who said positive things about Aram\u012bn and people who said negative things about him. There was very little in between.\n She read the ones that seemed to be situated in this gray zone with especially strong interest. Amasewun, Inofu, Isanakewu . . .\n She tried to bring up a social graph, but everyone was connected to everyone else\u2014Ereni leadership had been a very tightly knit circle back then, just after the War of Independence. She wondered if there was a way to quantify social closeness with the data at her disposal.\n She color-coded people: red for the ones who disliked Aram\u012bn, blue for the ones who liked him, yellow for the ones who seemed to have mixed emotions about him. She hid the ones without interviews\u2014mostly people who died shortly after Independence. Some people had oral history as their abuwen, and they jumped on the politicians as soon as the initial chaos wore off. In some cases, literally jumped on them. Oy\u0101run smiled briefly.\n She stared at the jumble of primary colors. There had to be a way to organize the data! She returned to the interviews, eager for inspiration.\n \u201cThese days, people like to say that many of the nobility did support our efforts, quietly, from the background. I am skeptical. [P: 5v] During the months I was active in the resistance, I only met Armyn, and I hadn\u2019t even heard of any others. Armyn made a clean break with his House when he left the planet with us, so I\u2019m not even sure he should count. [P: 3v] But he was there, always.\u201d\u2014Inofu ta Afuraw\u012b, Ereni Oral History Archives, War of Independence database, 45:26/1-4\n Inofu spoke carefully and precisely, but the council member called Aram\u012bn by his old pre-Independence name, Armyn, and that annoyed Oy\u0101run. She chided herself: That had to have been because they\u2019d known each other for a very long time. Unlike many others, Aram\u012bn had never disavowed his pre-Independence name, and even picked an Ereni name that sounded similar. Calling him Armyn was a sign of familiarity.\n She bit her lower lip as she sat up straight. That\u2019s it! She tried to list the interviewees who called him Armyn.\n There were disappointingly few results. She suspected it wasn\u2019t as much because of a lack of familiarity\u2014most of his coworkers survived the war, up North at the High Plains Research Institute\u2014but because most people were eager to get rid of every last bit of Emeki Imperial convention, from spelling to religious rituals. Still, she listed the ones who called him Armyn as close associates. She had to try a different tack . . .\n His coworkers. Would they be the closest to him? Aram\u012bn had no family, his family disowned him in his late teens\u2014if they could\u2019ve stripped him of his nobility and later his House leadership, they would\u2019ve done so without hesitation. Oy\u0101run had read the news articles from the period. Aram\u012bn was disowned when he started to study medical science, a vocation entirely unbecoming to an Imperial noble. Blood and guts and tears . . .\n She shivered, suddenly reminded of her own family. They never disowned her, but sometimes it felt to her that was because they hadn\u2019t even cared enough to do that. This was unfair, she reminded herself. Both her parents were running themselves ragged working in the Civil Engineering division. So much to plan, build, maintain . . . It wasn\u2019t fair to expect them to be in touch even after she\u2019d moved out, old enough to have her own tiny living space.\n She missed them, but she was frustrated. She had to get back to the data at hand. Even this qualitative analysis was easier than contemplating her own circumstances.\n Did the Research Institute have some sort of organizational diagram? She had to dig hard to come up with the structure during Aram\u012bn\u2019s tenure, but eventually she managed. She could fill it with names, weight the links in the social graph with workplace closeness . . . would this work? She had no idea of knowing who met each other regularly after-hours, who liked to chat in the lounge . . . She knew it was a long shot, but she had to try.\n She listened to Aram\u012bn\u2019s favorite music as she poked and prodded the data into shape.\n In the power to yield lies liberation We are here, resurfacing from the serpent seas\u2014Ephemera: Serpent Seas\n The answer was unexpected to Oy\u0101run, though she reflected that it would probably have been obvious to anyone who knew Aram\u012bn in person. The m\u0101wal\u0113ni who were trained by him, operated on by him, these people had positive reactions to him. His fellow researchers and other employees of HPRI were more likely to be averse to him the larger the organizational distance.\n They said he tortured his charges. He was cruel. He was heartless.\n His charges said he was cold, but fair, always very fair.\n The rest was history: he left the planet; he left the Empire. He had nothing in common with his new chosen people: he wasn\u2019t a m\u0101wal\u0113ni himself and he didn\u2019t have the Undesirable genotype either. He could\u2019ve stayed on Emek, he wasn\u2019t marked for elimination or a lifetime of servitude, like most of those who fled. He joined the refugees because of . . . his conscience?\n Did he have a conscience? Could he have a conscience? She tried hard to bridge the gap between unfamiliar cognotypes and social classes. He was an Imperial noble, even if of Plainsfolk origin. Had been a noble. He had worked extremely hard for the cause of independence. He helped build the country. But even the people who had positive attitudes toward him remarked that he was a sadist; a Falconer, even . . . She felt bad that a people whose cognotype used to be so reviled were now reviling another cognotype in turn. There had to be some kind of expression for this, but a few quick searches did not turn it up.\n She couldn\u2019t wrap her head around any of this. She had to talk to some of these people to understand Aram\u012bn. But was there a way to find an answer without talking to people, in general? She had to see for herself.\n See.\n She could see him. From a distance. See how he acted. Feel the impression his mind made on her, for she was a m\u0101wal\u0113ni herself. For a moment, she reflected on how she had the Undesirable genes at the same time. The former Undesirables were in the majority on Eren, and they were free from the Imperial yoke of Emek.\n She was everything he wasn\u2019t. He was everything she wasn\u2019t. She had to see him for what he was.\n She kept on listening to the music as she snuck out of her living quarters.\n The stream never-ending, the overwhelming, the never-escape,white corridorsthe pain all-encompassing,everything is close;you are close . . .\u2014Trees as Towers: The Never-Escape\n Oy\u0101run turned the music down only as she approached the block where he lived. A neighborhood quite far, but still looking much the same as her own; houses transformed from old miners\u2019 barracks and office buildings, crammed full of rooms barely large enough for a bed across. Aram\u012bn was still an influential figure, but Eren was a very equal society: there wasn\u2019t much for anyone, and most resources went into maintaining life in a hostile environment. She\u2019d heard enough from her parents to know that, from their arguments about a lack of resources in muffled tones well past her bedtime. There was never enough space.\n She knew he was due back relatively soon. She sat down behind a chute and turned her attention inward. She read the latest paper-folding news, but her thoughts kept on drifting back to him. Besides, the latest talk about how to create large modular figures from oddly shaped packaging leftovers disillusioned her. Does freedom necessitate poverty, she wondered, and closed the news.\n He was always spotlessly dressed. I used to work at HPR before the war, but when the hostilities broke out, I was stuck at the capital. And then I ran into him, just in, you know, this war zone. [P: 1.2v] In the middle of this war zone. [P: 0.7v] And he still looked, he was, you know, dressed unbelievably sharp. There was blood around and . . . [P: 0.5v] and dirt, and he was just there in the middle of it looking for all the world like, like he came from, I don\u2019t know, a Court reception or something. No idea how he did it.\u2014Omoyed\u0101r\u014d ta Beyun, Ereni Oral History Archives, War of Independence database 8E:2-8.\n Oy\u0101run glanced up at the sound of steps approaching, refocused her attention. She pushed herself between the chute and a wall, hoping the shadows would hide her. He passed by her without noticing anything, but she was too scared to breathe a sigh of relief.\n He was still spotlessly dressed. He wore an aubergine-colored overcoat over his rather generic dark blue tunic and loose pants. She was surprised for a moment. Blue was the color of knowledge, information, the m\u0101wal, so it was understandable for him to be wearing it even if he was not a m\u0101wal\u0113ni himself\u2014she wondered if that was what the dark shade signified. She never cared much about color symbolism. But aubergine, aubergine did not stand for anything. It was just a color, and an uncommon one at that. The cut of the coat suited him exceptionally well, she thought, then wondered if it was just her abuwen talking. Still, the coat looked custom-made, a rarity on the planetoid. How did he get ahold of it?\n As the fear left her and her limbs slowly unfroze, she realized she had not paid any attention to his presence beyond the immediately prevalent visual details. She had to have perceived his mind, because she didn\u2019t remember a lack, but she couldn\u2019t recall any details. Just the coat, one of its corners almost brushing her feet. His regal bearing. His firm, purposeful steps. Again, she hadn\u2019t even seen his face.\n She called up his profile. His face was smooth and oval, his jawline small. He had single-lidded eyes, and eyebrows that might have been touched up with liner or just uncommonly sharp. His skin was pale shading to brown, not pink; somewhat lighter than hers. His expression was elegant, even a trifle haughty. The large skullcap covering his bald head looked hand-embroidered, the same aubergine color decorated with a thick grayish-blue thread.\n She wondered how long he\u2019d taken until his profile picture looked just right. His appearance was probably very important to him, if he could procure an aubergine overcoat. The colors of his Imperial house had been teal and lilac, and aubergine was close. But he had no love to share for the Court, and for him his house had only been a tool to achieve his aims. Maybe, she thought, the coat was a way for him to assert his uniqueness?\n Her thoughts ground to a halt. Footsteps from the opposite direction. He was coming back! Did he just drop something in his room and then head out again? His tasks were finished for the day. Where was he going?\n Her fingers gripped each other so strongly that for a moment she was afraid her bones might snap. She desperately tried to imagine herself invisible. He passed by her again without noticing and went down the alley, then turned right.\n She forced herself back on her feet. Her muscles protested. She had to go after him!\n The first two steps were the hardest. Eventually, she fell into a rhythm of following him, like a game: halting when he did, ducking into side alleys and doorways, even predicting his moves. She wondered briefly if she was supposed to be bad at this because of her cognotype. It went smoothly, even though it felt improper.\n He passed through an industrial area, and for a while there was no cover that would hide her. She willed him not to look back. It seemed to work\u2014he was increasingly lost in thought. He strode along thin, snaking corridors, and she was shadowing him without difficulty. He wasn\u2019t paying any attention to his surroundings, she thought, but she kept herself as far from his mind as possible, due to some irrational fear that he might notice. He wouldn\u2019t have a correct sensation of being watched. He wasn\u2019t overly cautious either, at least as much as she could tell from the interviews. He himself had never been interviewed by the historians. Did he say no, or did no one ask him?\n The corridor suddenly opened up to a large cavern\u2014a hall, she corrected herself. He strode on. She halted just before the exit, peering outside. Memorial Park, she realized with a startle. But he had no family\u2014?\n Could she get any closer? She had to get closer! Fortunately, the carved memorial steles were chest-high and densely spaced. Many deaths in the war. She stepped among the steles and realized just what she had been thinking. Fortunately? She shuddered. Was Aram\u012bn having a bad influence on her? She had to bring this to a close as fast as possible. Just as soon as she found answers to the questions burning inside her.\n She weaved through the steles in a wide arc ending just behind Aram\u012bn. She peeked out from behind a stele and could see his back. He was standing in front of one of the many war memorials. A long list of names was etched into the stone.\n He took a step backward\u2014her body froze again\u2014then bent forward from the waist. Again, a step backward, again a bow. A third time. She didn\u2019t recognize the ritual. Three steps forward, without bowing.\n \u201cIn the name of the One Most High, exalted and elevated, transcendent and all-encompassing.\u201d His voice was sonorous, but not particularly deep\u2014just like in the rare recordings. She held on to the stele as she slowly, cautiously leaned out from behind it.\n \u201cYou console the souls of the dead as you console the souls of the living. All the world is in the hollow of your palm, you, who inhabit the heights and the depths. I call out to you and beseech you, just as you called out to our ancestors to show them your paths.\u201d\n It didn\u2019t sound like an Imperial ritual\u2014the requests for the God-Emperor\u2019s intercession were markedly missing. Was this a lesser House tradition? She called up her interface, tried to search for the phrases while he went on and on, at a slow but steady pace, with chant-like inflections. She found an exact match.\n Mourning ritual for the head of the House, House Gubhas. Its origins are shrouded in mystery; its phraseology suggests that it was incorporated into Imperial lore from High Plains tradition. The performer of the ritual\u2014in most cases, the new head of the House\u2014directly addresses the One Most High, but despite this notable . . .\n She skipped down.\n The ritual is exceedingly lengthy\u2014her heart sank\u2014as it is meant to allow the new head to reflect on the transitory nature of their position. The full mourning cycle lasts an Imperial year,\n She skimmed. How long would he stay here, reciting?\n One performance of the ritual takes about an hour and a half. It is recited on alternate weekdays and certain Imperial holidays, most notably the . . .\n She had time. She could wait. It was interesting, anyway. She made herself running subtitles and quietly lowered herself on the ground, behind her stele.\n He went on, never halting, never hurrying. While she couldn\u2019t see the text carved into the stele in front of him, the ritual frequently called for a mention of the name of the person. She just had to wait for it to come up.\n \u201cIey\u016bni ta Enafisul, who died a violent death, who died at the hands of a murderer,\u201d the ritual had multiple versions for natural deaths, accidental deaths, assassination attempts . . . she reflected on how many ways there were for a head of a house to die. \u201cYour blood calls out to us. Aye, we say your blood has not been shed in vain. You, the most noble of us . . . \u201d She stopped paying attention as she frantically searched for the name. A secret lover? An illegitimate sibling? Or even a descendant? Court intrigue swirled in her head. And if the mourning cycle was only a year long, then why was he still saying these words? The war ended a long time ago.\n Iey\u016bni ta Enafisul was apparently not a remarkable person, as Oy\u0101run found very little data. She fought and died in the war. She had been a young m\u0101wal\u0113ni who managed to escape induction to the ranks of the Imperial Seers, then she went up to the High Plains and received some training at HPRI. She joined the Column-Tree Forest guerrilla bands and participated in several important strikes on the Southern Passageway and the neighboring towns south of the Forest. She died in an ambush alongside four of her comrades. There wasn\u2019t much else.\n The lover theory looked the most likely\u2014but wasn\u2019t Aram\u012bn aromantic and asexual, like Oy\u0101run herself? His profile clearly said so; this was one of the very few commonalities between the two of them. Oy\u0101run bit down on her lower lip. She would have to ask around. Maybe someone remembered her. Maybe there was no more data because someone had been going around deleting information. Was that even possible?\n She sat in silence, listening. After a while, her teeming thoughts quieted down, and she was drawn into the ritual. He recited with grace and precision. Whoever this mysterious Iey\u016bni was, her soul would clearly be satisfied. Even the One Most High would be satisfied.\n She could feel herself slipping into a trance, but she didn\u2019t mind. The world narrowed down to Aram\u012bn, to the sound of his voice. She thought she\u2019d like him to pray for her, too; then she didn\u2019t think much at all.\n The ritual came to a close, she noticed with an unexpected wave of sadness. Everything was transitory\u2014eventually, even mourning came to an end. He hadn\u2019t arrived from the direction where she was presently standing\u2014if she was lucky, he wouldn\u2019t notice her at all on his way out. Still, better get some distance between them\u2014she got slowly back up on her feet\u2014\n Instead of turning around, he took a step back, then bent forward from the waist, beginning anew. She was so surprised that her legs tangled together, seemingly of their own accord, and she toppled forward and hit the ground.\n He turned around. Looked at her lying in a heap. She glanced up at him. He raised an eyebrow.\n \u201cHave you been spying on me?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014no\u2014I mean yes, but not like that\u2014\u201d She could feel her face redden as she babbled.\n He chuckled softly. \u201cSecurity does not seem to be running at peak capability today,\u201d he said, clearly amused.\n She got on her knees. \u201cI\u2019m not a danger to you.\u201d\n \u201cHmm?\u201d\n She got back up on her feet, brushed off her clothes with shaking hands. Looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m not a danger to you,\u201d her voice trembled just as strongly, \u201cso the fact that they didn\u2019t catch me means they were performing well, not the opposite.\u201d Why was she saying this? Why was she saying anything? She wanted to run away, but she felt rooted to the spot, and her mouth wouldn\u2019t stop blabbering.\n He looked surprised for once, then . . . pleased? \u201cTechnically, yes,\u201d he said and adjusted his overcoat with a minimal, automatic gesture, \u201cbut that\u2019s of course only true if you are indeed not a danger to me.\u201d\n She had no idea what to say next. She had not even known he had a security detail! There was so much she didn\u2019t know about him. Her mind seemed to seesaw between trying to say everything at once and being so terrified she couldn\u2019t get a single word out. Her mouth opened, then closed.\n He nodded slightly. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re not a danger to my person.\u201d He paused. \u201cDid you mean to talk to me?\u201d\n She nodded, speechless.\n \u201cCome closer, I don\u2019t bite.\u201d He held up both hands. \u201cI won\u2019t touch you without your permission, I promise.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cThere is a bench toward the back, we can sit. Or we can go for a walk.\u201d\n She held her ground.\n \u201cYou know I\u2019m not lying to you,\u201d Aram\u012bn said. \u201cYou\u2019re a m\u0101wal\u0113ni, you can sense it.\u201d\n She blinked. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n \u201cI can recognize the signs. I\u2019ve seen many people like you.\u201d\n \u201cAnd then you tortured them?\u201d She felt like her entire body was on fire.\n \u201cI would not do anything to anyone without their consent,\u201d he said. He was telling the truth. The way he saw the truth, at least. After all, he didn\u2019t force the High Council to do anything either; he just shamed them into following him, she realized. But she did not share that shame, that Imperial guilt. Before independence, she would have been labeled both a Seer and an Undesirable. She stepped closer.\n \u201cA walk?\u201d He turned around and strode ahead. She tagged along, still silent.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He could\u2019ve checked her profile for the answer. He was trying to make small talk, she realized with a sinking feeling.\n \u201cOy\u0101run,\u201d she said.\n \u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d\n \u201cPreengineering subjects.\u201d She swallowed. She was so afraid of him, and he looked nonchalant. Patient with her. \u201cA lot of math and physics, mostly. I\u2019m almost done with General Studies.\u201d She tried not to think of her civics homework.\n The paths among the steles were narrow, and she was glad she could only see his back. It made talking a lot easier.\n \u201cWhich branches of engineering are you interested in?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t really . . . know, yet.\u201d Another swallow. \u201cI like aircraft. But they don\u2019t really . . . don\u2019t really . . . \u201d\n \u201cSee much use on Eren, you mean?\u201d More of a statement than a question. With no hint of mockery in his voice.\n \u201cYes, yes. So I don\u2019t really know. I thought I\u2019d . . . look around. See what there is to do. Maybe something related to space travel.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting it off.\u201d Why was she telling him this?\n \u201cI could invite you to my workplace,\u201d he said. \u201cPlenty of work for engineers. Especially bioengineering, neuroengineering, but a little of everything. It might be something to aim toward. You will need to find an internship placement soon, and you might like this.\u201d\n \u201cS-sure. Thank you.\u201d\n They walked ahead in silence. The hall was larger than she\u2019d remembered. Eventually he offered, \u201cThat\u2019s not why you\u2019ve sought me out.\u201d\n \u201cI . . . I just wanted to know.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond. \u201c . . . About you. What kind of person you were. I read . . . a lot.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make sense of it.\u201d\n He turned left. \u201cThat\u2019s the bench I was talking about. If you would like to sit.\u201d\n They sat with more than enough room between them. She stared straight ahead, at a small empty space in the maze, and a small fountain in the center of it. There were more steles in the hall than she\u2019d thought, and only a few scraggly trees.\n \u201cThis is the only fountain on Eren,\u201d he said, not looking at her.\n \u201cYou know this place very well.\u201d She felt foolish for saying such a triviality.\n \u201cI come here every day.\u201d\n \u201cWho was Iey\u016bni?\u201d\n \u201cOne of my charges.\u201d\n She blinked, stunned. When she\u2019d stumbled, he was about to start the whole ritual over again with a different name. \u201cDo you say prayers for every one of them?\u201d\n \u201cI try to.\u201d He leaned back. \u201cI aim to finish in this lifetime.\u201d For a moment, sorrow and regret tinted his voice. Just for a moment.\n Her thoughts raced. He had to have trained hundreds of people. He surely didn\u2019t only mean everyone he had commanded, because he had never commanded a unit where Iey\u016bni was serving.\n \u201cYou\u2019re very . . . different from what I\u2019d expected,\u201d she said.\n He raised an eyebrow again\u2014she could tell without looking at him. He waited for her to speak.\n \u201cPeople said you were a Falconer,\u201d she said after some hesitation. She didn\u2019t know of a less harsh term, the way Ereni cognotype had supplanted Undesirable.\n \u201cOh, I suppose I do have those tendencies.\u201d He looked up at the domed ceiling high above. \u201cIt\u2019s a spectrum, you know. Just like the Ereni cognotype.\u201d So eerily calm, she thought. \u201cI never even hunted for sport. I don\u2019t go around murdering people. We are all different.\u201d\n It was out of her mouth before she knew it. \u201cWould you like to?\u201d\n \u201cTo murder people?\u201d His calm did not waver.\n She was sure he\u2019d take offense. Then she realized that everything she could say, everything hurtful, someone must have said to him already. She saw those people in the archives. She felt her face burn in embarrassment. He went on, and she was sure he was only pretending not to notice her reaction.\n \u201cI\u2019m not interested. If I were to murder someone, it would be all over,\u201d he said.\n \u201cAll over?\u201d\n He closed his eyes. She turned to look at him. \u201cControl,\u201d he said after a while. \u201cI need control.\u201d\n \u201cOver people?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d He opened his eyes and turned his head slightly to look at her, a gracefully understated movement. He had known perfectly well that she\u2019d look at him\u2014he had known it so well that he didn\u2019t even need to think of it. He automatically adjusted his behavior to take advantage of his situation. To reach his aims.\n \u201cComplete control,\u201d he said, his gaze fixed on her.\n She looked away, flustered. She tried to sound similarly nonchalant. \u201cSo . . . do you enjoy causing people pain?\u201d\n \u201cYes, I do.\u201d As if he was being quizzed by a teacher. An easy question. \u201cI\u2019m a sadist, after all. That\u2019s different from being a Falconer. People of any cognotype can be sadists.\u201d He paused a bit. \u201cEven yours.\u201d\n Was he goading her? She had to stay calm, calmer than this. Her mind held on to that template of question and answer, of education and teachers. She could get through this conversation without her heart jumping out of her chest if she thought of it as quizzing him. She went on.\n \u201cAnd you did cause them pain.\u201d\n \u201cI do cause them pain,\u201d he corrected her.\n \u201cWhy are you answering my questions?\u201d\n \u201cI have time, and I find them interesting.\u201d So detached. That was the word\u2014he felt permanently detached. And yet probably more in tune with his surroundings than she herself ever would, she suspected.\n \u201cSo you . . . ask them to allow you. To cause them pain.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cAnd they allow you.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n She could feel he was about to say What do you think?, but he changed his mind at the last moment.\n \u201cI want them to be perfect.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cI can improve on them. The best they can offer\u2014I can help them achieve it. I want my charges to be perfect, you see?\u201d A glimmer of eagerness. She realized he didn\u2019t have very strong emotions, in general. She nodded.\n \u201cSo we make a deal. They give themselves over to me. And I make them perfect. As much as I can.\u201d He did not take his eyes off her. \u201cEveryone benefits.\u201d\n It did make a twisted sort of sense to her. \u201cBut there is pain.\u201d\n \u201cNo transformation is ever without pain,\u201d he said. A quote from somewhere?\n She blinked. \u201cYou\u2019ve found your niche.\u201d\n \u201cI have.\u201d His gaze seemed questioning. \u201cAre my answers bothering you?\u201d\n She returned his gaze. \u201cWhy are you so honest?\u201d\n \u201cI have always been honest.\u201d\n \u201cI thought people like you often lied.\u201d\n A trace of a smile. \u201cI have no need to lie.\u201d\n 2.\n Oy\u0101run knew all too well that she should study\u2014she had quite an amount of math to review for her next meeting with her teacher\u2014but instead she just sat, alone and in silence, replaying her sensory logs of the conversation with Aram\u012bn.\n Her tiny living quarters were like a shirt, overly tight around her body.\n Did she finally understand what kind of man he was? She only knew that her abuwen showed no signs of subsiding. The more she knew about him, the more she wanted to know. Then again, this was a common characteristic of abuwen even when they were not person focused. Would the process ever run its course?\n Aram\u012bn had invited her to see his workplace, reiterating the offer when the two of them had said goodbye. She had to overcome her fear of unfamiliar situations and make that visit; her own mind would not give her rest until then.\n She would love to work with him. As an engineer. As\u2014\n She swallowed hard.\n Her fingers folded and unfolded a scrap of paper, over and over again.\n Her mind stopped. Time stopped.\n She had to make that visit.\n She took a deep breath, shut down playback, called up her organizer. On top, the random quote of the day from her favorite poems said, \u201cRip open the seal release the magic.\u201d\n She blinked. She was sure the random quote had been something completely different just a moment ago. Had she overlooked it? She checked her system logs. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n She closed the organizer, got up\u2014the chair toppling over\u2014and rushed out, the echoes of the poem reverberating in her head.\n Rip open the seal release the magic; everything I can offer to draw you closeis in the tiniest inflections of my voice\u2014I am myself, and you\u2014you abide in meuntil even the sunsets turn into dust;\u2014The Blessings of the Path by Omas\u0101run ta Idarawul, third stanza\n It was early in the morning; Oy\u0101run was stunned to realize how early. Sleep and wakefulness had blended together. How much time had passed since her meeting with Aram\u012bn? Three days\u2014it was hard to fathom. Three days spent in a daze. If anyone had tried to contact her, she hadn\u2019t noticed. She had to bring this to a close; force it if need be.\n She struggled to keep herself from breaking into a run. Her muscles were taut and rigid. The Institute was close by. After all that time, it was still called the Institute, a reminder of the High Plains of Emek forever and ever. A place of sanctity, a place of pain and blood and sacrifice. The High Plains far away, on another planet, in another solar system. The Institute remained, carrying the name ever onward into the future.\n She walked right in, no one stopping her. She halted to check\u2014the place was still restricted-entry. Someone had put her onto the visitor list. Did Aram\u012bn seriously think she would come to see him? Did he truly want that? Did he expect her?\n She ran along white corridors, without realizing where she was going. She only stopped when she painfully bumped into someone\u2014\n The young m\u0101wal\u0113ni stared at her in surprise. Oy\u0101run opened her mouth to apologize, but the m\u0101wal\u0113ni held up a hand, silenced her.\n \u201cAre you looking for some\u2014oh. Aram\u012bn? I can show you the way to his office.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run nodded, then belatedly closed her mouth.\n \u201cI am Emien,\u201d the m\u0101wal\u0113ni said. She was young- and exhausted-looking, maybe just a year or two older than her. Dark semicircles stood out on the pale skin underneath her eyes. \u201cSorry, apparently someone forgot to clear you for the floor plans.\u201d She closed her eyes for a second; when she reopened them, a craving for sleep hit Oy\u0101run. \u201cAll done.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run murmured thanks, then called up a copy of the floor plans.\n \u201cI can show you the way,\u201d Emien said. \u201cI\u2019m going in that direction anyway.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run nodded gratefully.\n The two of them walked without saying much, Oy\u0101run behind Emien. The m\u0101wal\u0113ni was wearing a long-sleeved white smock, matching trousers, and a white bandana. The smock had a turtleneck collar\u2014Oy\u0101run strained her eyes trying to see the implants peeking out from underneath the fabric. She stopped when she realized Emien had noticed; Oy\u0101run didn\u2019t mean to be rude, she was simply curious. Anything to take her mind off the constant, immense fear.\n Emien suddenly halted; Oy\u0101run almost fell over her. \u201cHis office is at the end of this corridor,\u201d Emien said and pointed right. \u201cI\u2019m going left here.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run wanted to say something, but the words wouldn\u2019t come out. Emien was about to walk away but noticed her distress and stopped. She looked at Oy\u0101run, head tilted to one side. \u201cMhm?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014What do you think of him?\u201d\n \u201cHuh? Oh, he\u2019s all right. A bit on the strict side, but all right.\u201d Emien looked concerned all of a sudden. \u201cYou heard those stories? That was just Imperial propaganda.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cTrash for the yellow rags. Trust me, he\u2019s all right.\u201d She spoke with conviction and made no attempt to hide or camouflage her feelings.\n Oy\u0101run gulped. They said goodbye and Oy\u0101run walked down the corridor. Twenty-one steps altogether; twenty-one steps of mind-numbing fear.\n Oy\u0101run pushed the door open. It yielded and she realized she had forgotten to knock. Embarrassment froze her and she stood still, unthinking. The walls were thick, and the doorway surrounded her. She felt boxed in.\n \u201cDo come in,\u201d Aram\u012bn called out to her.\n When she didn\u2019t move, he got up from his seat and walked toward her. \u201cI thought we\u2019d already established that I\u2019m not one for eating people,\u201d he said cautiously.\n She walked in, her legs stiff like wooden sticks.\n \u201cDo sit.\u201d\n She was frozen.\n \u201cHere, I have a chair for you,\u201d Aram\u012bn said and stepped to the wall, picked up one of the chairs, and put it behind her. \u201cYou can sit now.\u201d His voice was smooth and reassuring. She sat.\n He sat on top of his desk; it was mostly empty. He threaded his fingers together. \u201cSo you\u2019ve come to see the Institute for yourself. I\u2019m happy to show you around. A little good-natured propaganda is not beneath me,\u201d he said with a small, sarcastic smile.\n She nodded, one of the vertebrae in her neck cracking. She could see he was trying to put her at ease.\n \u201cI was just reviewing a new procedure proposed by one of our surgery teams. It\u2019s probably not really up your alley. We can go and look around, I can show you the\u2014\u201d\n She broke in. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s all right\u2014\u201d She didn\u2019t want to keep him from anything, especially not his work. Besides, everything he said was interesting.\n \u201cOh?\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWould you be interested?\u201d He smiled again, a hungrier smile. Just for a moment. \u201cAh, is it that everything about me is equally fascinating to you?\u201d\n She had a hard time believing he was not a m\u0101wal\u0113ni himself. Were her reactions to him so transparent? They probably were, she decided. Or maybe he had just a little grasp of the m\u0101wal but used that to all its worth.\n When no answer was forthcoming, he said, \u201cWell then. I cannot promise this will hold your attention, but I\u2019ll do my best to explain everything.\u201d He leaned back and shared his mental workspace with her with a command.\n It was just a casual gesture for him, but for Oy\u0101run it carried an intimacy beyond what would usually be attributed to it. Maybe because for her, there was no clear-cut division between input from her computer interface, input from her senses, and input via the m\u0101wal\u2014it all blended together, and thus even when he simply shared something with her via purely technological means, it was as if he\u2019d opened his mind to her, without hesitation.\n She was touched, even though she felt that was unreasonable. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. She leaned forward as he began his explanation.\n \u201cI should offer some context first\u2014my apologies if we tread familiar terrain, in the beginning at least.\u201d\n She nodded again to show it was all right. She appreciated his consideration.\n \u201cAll right. Eren is an extremely high-m\u0101wal zone and we need to spend a lot of effort on maintaining a habitable environment,\u201d he said. It sounded like a quote from a lecture. He probably lectured often, she thought. \u201cWe need a large contingent of m\u0101wal\u0113ni whose primary task is to make sure no serious problems occur. This is why the Empire originally abandoned Eren, even though it was set to be a lucrative mining colony. It\u2019s necessary\u2014\u201d\n He got up and began to circle her chair, talking all the while. The effect was mesmerizing.\n \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to loosely bind together and harmonize the minds of everyone in general society and exert a stabilizing influence. In an environment that can be shaped by people\u2019s expectations and fears, a single person\u2019s panic can cause runaway reactions if precautions are not taken.\u201d\n He stopped, directly behind her, the tone of his voice abruptly changing.\n \u201cDid you know the first people to live here were devoured by monsters?\u201d\n She offered a weak no.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not hidden from those who choose to investigate, but it\u2019s generally held that it\u2019s for the best if people do not investigate.\u201d He sighed and began his circle anew. \u201cThese days we can prevent such large-scale disasters without inhibiting m\u0101wal use. But it takes a lot of effort, and all too many of our m\u0101wal\u0113ni are busy with this constant struggle. We\u2019re trying very, very hard to make sure that people who choose to join us can perform to the best of their ability, and possibly beyond. We are very short-staffed. It\u2019s the only way. This is the System of Eren, not as you\u2019d hear of it, but as it is. And if people had not already worked their hardest, I would not have had my moment of fame.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run thought back on the video. All the weapons in the crowd. The emotions running high. And yet, the quiet, the people turning to each other to help. She nodded.\n He looked at her and his gaze went to her marrow. \u201cWe only take volunteers. We are very firm about this. Believe me.\u201d He looked away. \u201cStill. I\u2019m not proud of some of the things we do. We take people and squeeze them dry.\u201d His gaze flickered around the room, as if searching for a window to stare out. There was no window, and outside\u2014she knew\u2014no nature to behold, only a desert of rocks and silt. No air above the thick roofs of the domes.\n He spoke with his back to her. \u201cThey die far too young. And they die all spent. Back on Emek, when the Imperial Seers were all spent satisfying the whims of the noble houses, my blood had boiled with righteous anger.\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t imagine him boiling with anything, but she could feel there was indeed an undercurrent of emotion beneath the surface; not particularly strong, but steady and never ceasing. He went on.\n \u201cNow we do the same ourselves. Do you understand that?\u201d\n Silence.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no place for us to go,\u201d she said after she could overcome her hesitation. \u201cThis is our planet now . . . this is the price of independence.\u201d She wished she could believe that herself.\n \u201cBut this is too high a price. I do not want to see them die. I made an oath I would dedicate all my efforts to this. I cannot\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence.\n Suddenly, a flash of insight struck Oy\u0101run\u2014Aram\u012bn could not stand to feel useless. He wanted to be in control. Was all this about him and his mastery of his surroundings, by proxy? Even if it was, his efforts were still for a worthy cause, Oy\u0101run decided.\n \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the diagrams,\u201d Aram\u012bn said and turned around. His face was inscrutable. \u201cThese are quite drastic procedures.\u201d Did he have trouble speaking?\n \u201cTo amplify the m\u0101wal?\u201d she offered.\n \u201cNo, no,\u201d he shook his head. \u201cOn this planet, we have all the amplification we need, and then some more. And with the people we recruit, lack of power is simply not an issue. This is all for regulation.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t really get the idea. They hadn\u2019t gotten to anything similar yet in her classes.\n \u201cMany m\u0101wal\u0113ni can raise a large amount of m\u0101wal, here on Eren. Training or no training, implants or no implants. But that\u2019s just a burst, or some kind of runaway reaction, a positive feedback loop that runs until some limiting factor is hit. What we need is constant, steady high throughput.\u201d\n She had heard of positive feedback loops, but not too much\u2014she knew \u201cpositive\u201d didn\u2019t mean the loop was desirable, only that it was amplificatory. Still, she got the gist of what he was saying. She nodded, her neck no longer clicking and creaking.\n \u201cThis necessitates constant control and considerable effort. Especially since ideally, there should be a division between power raising and power direction.\u201d\n \u201cUm?\u201d\n \u201cPower raising and power direction, at their most focused, are hard if not impossible to do concurrently for a single mind. It is much more fruitful to split the functions, assign them to separate people.\u201d\n He breathed out. She breathed out too, then blinked; had their breaths unconsciously synchronized? Was that a good sign, or the exact opposite?\n \u201cThis helped us to persist here,\u201d he said, suddenly aloof. He held up one hand, looked at it. Showed it to her. \u201cYou know, my hands are bloody.\u201d\n She sat in silence. She knew that\u2014everyone knew\u2014everyone knew everything. Back then, politics, now, history. She didn\u2019t know how to react. Independence had been hard-won.\n He looked upward, toward a nonexistent sky. \u201cAnd yet you still come to me.\u201d Then he shook his head and cleared his throat. He didn\u2019t speak for a long time.\n Her mind spun. Was this a prescheduled confession? Or was it more spontaneous? She could not tell. His sadness, however, was genuine. Not strong, and mixed with a kind of self-reflective amusement\u2014\u201cam I really feeling this?\u201d\u2014but genuine nonetheless.\n \u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a task at hand.\u201d\n 3.\n Oy\u0101run sat, looking at the little fountain\u2014the only one of its kind. She felt empty, and at the same time, weighed down, as if something were steadily pressing on her shoulders, pushing her chest cavity inward . . .\n Aram\u012bn had shown her the schematics, explained everything in detail. But when it was time for her tour of the building, he demonstrated a curious reluctance.\n She was turning her mental impressions around in her head; it was all surprisingly difficult. Eventually, she concluded Aram\u012bn had assumed she would be discomforted. That she would disapprove. But why would that bother him?\n A thought\u2014\n She was an outsider. She was not one of his charges and was not slated to become one.\n Maybe he was afraid of\u2014\n She could not pursue this train of thought any further.\n She clutched her arms around her chest, hugged herself tightly. She didn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t want to think of it\u2014she knew, knew for once that he would not want her to think of it\u2014she squeezed her eyes shut.\n Then she blinked. How had she gained so much insight into one person? Certainly, via the m\u0101wal . . . but the Ereni cognotype did not lend itself to such approaches. She could perceive the m\u0101wal, and that probably helped, but still . . .\n \u201cIt\u2019s the sheer effort I put into it,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cInto understanding him.\u201d No one was there to hear her. Her voice sounded too low and deep for her ears. \u201cIt\u2019s the sheer effort,\u201d she repeated.\n This took her mind away from the rest.\n Oy\u0101run tried to wrangle Aram\u012bn into an internship placement\u2014she was surprised by her own audacity. It was all just text messages sent back and forth, and not very long ones at that, but this was not something she would\u2019ve imagined herself capable of doing.\n It\u2019s the fear, she thought, without pausing to examine the source of her fear.\n Life sped up and she moved through it in a daze, staggering from one day to another. Her conversations with the people she\u2019d met through paper folding lessened, then ceased. Her meetings with her teacher were shorter and shorter. She wasn\u2019t sure when she\u2019d last talked to her parents.\n She would start her internship at the end of the short cycle. Just a few more days.\n She felt a craving, and yet she did not know what it was that she craved.\n They were not, strictly speaking, visions; they only had a tactile component. Oy\u0101run felt herself strapped to some kind of\u2014machine? frame?\u2014then she felt the straps tighten. A warm, dry hand smoothed over her brow. Then she was lying in bed, a soft, firm bed, and all around there was white\u2014that emptiness was the only thing she saw.\n She wondered if she should seek help. Ask for a counseling appointment\u2014but what would she say? That something was swimming below the surface, waiting to break out, and she had glimpsed the shadow of its body, rising from the depths to lurk just below the edges of her consciousness, a sea monster determined to ascend? How would she say that? And was that even a problem in itself, or was it something she simply needed to come to terms with, something perfectly natural and right, if somewhat unusual?\n The m\u0101wal would give her visions. Surely this was expected, especially on this planet, and especially given that she was sensitive to it.\n Then why the sense of urgency?\n Her time frame shortened. She counted every hour until the day she would set foot in the Institute again. She kept on feeling, then rejecting the feeling, that her life would be over.\n This was to be a simple junior internship in medical engineering, nothing more.\n She tried to tell herself that.\n That was before she came face-to-face with Aram\u012bn and found herself making that unspeakable request.\n 4.\n Aram\u012bn suddenly went pale, all the blood draining from his cheeks. Yet he kept his composure. \u201cSorry, would you please say that again?\u201d he said with such forced evenness in his voice that a chill ran along Oy\u0101run\u2019s spine.\n \u201cI want to join the System,\u201d she said.\n There. She had done it. Even that morning when she woke, she had told herself she wouldn\u2019t. It was impossible that she would even entertain such a thought.\n But she wanted to, she craved it so much it was impossible to describe\u2014\n \u201cYou only say that because you are obsessed with me,\u201d he said with cruelty sharp like a knife. He wanted to push her away.\n \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d How was she supposed to respond to that? To such a slur? Yes, she was indeed obsessed if that was the word he wanted to use, instead of something like special interest that was more neutral, or abuwen, actually positive; but\u2014\u201cI am, I am, I admit that, but that has nothing to do with this\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo?\u201d He leaned forward. Eyes narrowing. \u201cThe way I see it is, you grew up, acquired enough of a grasp on the m\u0101wal to be able to function, and you never felt attracted to it. You knew what it was, but it was not your path.\u201d Longer and longer pauses between words. Not. Your. Path. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden,\u201d his words hissed, \u201cyou become obsessed with me, and you realize this is what you need to keep me close. Suddenly, you want to join the System.\u201d\n He stood, right in front of her. He was taller than her, and she had to arc her neck uncomfortably upward.\n \u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fought so that you would not have to do this. We fought so that no one would be forced to do this. We fought for your right of choice, many of us died for your right of choice, we fought, and we won. I will not\u2014I will not allow you to throw that away.\u201d\n She took a step back, and her feet tangled in the chair behind her, sitting there unused. She lost her balance and fell\u2014\n He grabbed her arms and steadied her. Then he dropped his arms and looked away.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have acted in a threatening way. But I can only say this much, and I can only say it thus. For you this is history, but for me it was my entire life.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d she began, then stopped, not knowing how to continue.\n \u201cWe fought so that the Imperial Seers would not have to live their lives in servitude to the Court. We fought so that the Undesirables would not be eradicated. You are both, and yet you would throw this freedom away.\u201d End of the sentence. End of the line. He paused. \u201cI will not allow it.\u201d\n She braced herself. Then she stepped around him, in his line of sight, and stared him in the face. \u201cThis is what I want to do.\u201d She saw something there, and she added, on impulse\u2014\u201cThis is what you want to do.\u201d\n He looked as if slapped.\n She went on, just as merciless as he had been.\n \u201cThis is what you want to do.\u201d She imagined her eyes piercing his, she put force behind her gaze, willed it to be so. \u201cYou are flattered.\u201d She started to walk around him, in a tight semicircle just like he had done, but a little too close for comfort. She kept up eye contact all the while, in a mechanistic but still all too effective manner. \u201cI know how you see me. I\u2019m young. I\u2019m ideally suited to this. You are permanently, desperately short-staffed. I\u2019m here to give you just what you want, and if my reasons are less than pure, so are yours. You might want to save the settlement, but that\u2019s not what drives you. What drives you is my obedience, the obedience of people like me, and now you are torn\u2014turn me away and enjoy my obedience for a moment, or keep me close and enjoy it for as long as I live.\u201d\n He looked\u2014taken aback?\n \u201cThat . . . \u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cThat might not be long.\u201d\n She would not take her gaze off him, she would not let up for an instant\u2014and he, he could not look away.\n \u201cI am here for you to do as you please. I know the risks. I know what\u2019s involved.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cLet me help.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, looking away for a moment. Reminiscing? \u201cYou think you do, but you don\u2019t. You might understand the process, but you\u2019ve never experienced the pain.\u201d\n Despite his words, she could feel that inside him, something had given way; yet she was too caught up in her own fervor to rejoice.\n He looked at her again. He had apparently used that moment to regain his composure, for he was just as forceful as before, and probably twice as forceful as she had just been.\n \u201cI can take you. You are right; I am flattered, and you are well-suited to this line of work. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m taking you.\u201d His eyes bore into hers. Was he miming her? \u201cI\u2019m taking you because we, the collective we, do not have the luxury of turning any suitable person away. I have slapped you in the face and you have slapped me in the face; we are even.\u201d\n His tone was abrasive, but she felt it was only an act. Inside, deep down inside, he was relieved. He was looking forward to this. He was\u2014may the One Most High help them both\u2014hungry.\n II.\n 1.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll also need an endorsement from your closest relatives,\u201d the brown-skinned young man with Worowan features said and scratched his hairless scalp under his cap. Oy\u0101run was surprised to see the gesture in someone so young-looking\u2014he must\u2019ve been born off-Eren, he must\u2019ve had ample time to get used to the feeling of hair covering his head to feel the lack so acutely.\n Oy\u0101run transferred the documents. Her father had approved everything; on the call, he had looked even more tired than Emien. She felt the planetoid was eating everyone alive.\n The man nodded to himself as he examined the documents. She looked at his profile\u2014his name was Isinaiyu, and he had indeed been born elsewhere. He was also older than she\u2019d guessed at first.\n \u201cEverything looks all right,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI assume you haven\u2019t changed your mind . . . ?\u201d\n She sighed. \u201cIt has been two weeks. I haven\u2019t changed my mind in two weeks, I\u2019m not going to change it now.\u201d\n He shrugged, and she felt that he\u2019d seen that already, people changing their minds at the very last instant . . . ? It was a complicated feeling and she had trouble parsing it.\n \u201cAll right, I\u2019m clearing you for the medical,\u201d he said. \u201cGo on ahead. Third floor, the corridor on the left.\u201d He made a little gesture with his fingers and a path traced itself on her interface overlay. Such a deeply ingrained gesture, she thought. None of the stiffness of those born off-Eren, the older generation. How odd. But some people were more flexible than others.\n She followed the path.\n The doctor running the checks also looked Worowan; a short, stout woman with a spring in her steps. Her skin was much darker than Oy\u0101run\u2019s. She introduced herself as Esesewi, and they greeted each other in the Worowan manner, grabbing the forearms and bowing their heads. Oy\u0101run\u2019s family were mostly Plainsfolk, but she knew the basic Worowan customs from their neighbors in their housing unit.\n Oy\u0101run could feel the doctor making a preliminary assessment based on that single greeting: the texture and temperature of her skin, the steadiness\u2014or, rather, unsteadiness\u2014of her movements, the strength of her grip. All with effortless expertise.\n \u201cThe examination is not particularly invasive,\u201d Esesewi said. Her voice was warm and deep, a welcome feeling among the cold walls. \u201cYour interface gathers most of the relevant information already, I just need a data dump. Give me root?\u201d\n She did. Esesewi went on talking while she examined the data. She described the additional tests\u2014just a few simple cognitive tasks, as the detailed workup would be done concurrently with the new set of modifications once Oy\u0101run passed the medical. Then the doctor looked directly at her, away from the readouts supplied by her interface. \u201cBy the way, you know I\u2019m supposed to dissuade you?\u201d\n Oy\u0101run shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re the second person today.\u201d\n Esesewi chuckled. \u201cNo point in it, then?\u201d She grinned at her. \u201cI haven\u2019t said I wanted to dissuade you, or that I would attempt to dissuade you, only that I was supposed to dissuade you. As far as I\u2019m concerned, if you want to do this, that\u2019s just fine.\u201d She focused on the data again. \u201cYou will want out, but that will happen after the point of no return, you know?\u201d\n A wave of sudden fear ran through her. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLook, it happens to almost everyone. I\u2019ve been here a long time. It happens over and over. Now you\u2019ll just have to decide whether to go with your true will as opposed to your will at a given moment.\u201d\n She wasn\u2019t sure she understood that. \u201c . . . Decide?\u201d\n \u201cThat happens right before the point of no return. You decide your true will and hand us the ability to enforce it. Even against yourself.\u201d The doctor sighed. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do this if the process was reversible, or if it could be stopped, paused. But once started, it needs to run its course. It\u2019s dangerous to interrupt\u2014dangerous for you, for us, for everyone. You can say no before, you can say no afterward, you can quit at any time, but you can\u2019t say no during the process itself.\u201d She spread her hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run hugged herself. A cold sensation was forming inside her, pulling her innards together like a black hole. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d She looked down. The floor was smooth and gray. \u201cI mean that makes sense. I\u2019m just afraid.\u201d\n Esesewi glanced up. \u201cWe expect people to be afraid. I\u2019d be worried for you if you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n Aram\u012bn looked down on his bare desk, his expression contemplative. He was mulling over the data, Oy\u0101run knew. The medical, the more recent tests, her former data back from when she\u2019d decided she would not train as a professional m\u0101wal\u0113ni. Such a long time ago, shortly after her power had begun manifesting in earnest. They had taught her how to channel it away in safe ways, how to ask for help, they had set up a few simple mechanisms in her mind so that she wouldn\u2019t be troubled by the power she\u2019d been born with but that had never particularly interested her. She had had free choice every step of the way, and she had said no. But then, she changed her mind . . .\n \u201cThis was a very clean job,\u201d Aram\u012bn said, looking up at her. \u201cYou had no trouble in everyday life, is that correct?\u201d\n \u201cIt was fine.\u201d She felt embarrassed for a moment. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d have these odd feelings, not even premonitions . . . foreboding, maybe? But it was fine. Also, I had enough to help me make sense of what people were thinking, but not so much to cause problems, so . . . the helpful parts without the troublesome parts?\u201d\n Aram\u012bn nodded gravely. \u201cMost people come to us when the bindings wouldn\u2019t hold, or the power becomes unmanageable for some other reason.\u201d He stood and began to pace again. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m troubled by that. It mars the quality of consent. It\u2019s also a failing on our behalf.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t come because of that,\u201d Oy\u0101run said. \u201cI was fine.\u201d\n \u201cI know. Your motivations trouble me for other reasons.\u201d He was with his back to her, but she could feel his consternation, drawing from a source deep enough that she couldn\u2019t sense it without prying. She wouldn\u2019t pry.\n He went on. \u201cYou\u2019re here because of your interest in me. It appeals to me, I must say. And I can certainly train you, as I\u2019ve trained many others. But I don\u2019t think I can truly give you what you desire.\u201d He stopped right behind her. \u201cI don\u2019t have abuwen. I have a different cognotype, so I don\u2019t know this from personal experience. But I know that despite their intensity, sometimes they pass, all of a sudden. The impact of the decision you are making now will last much longer.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run looked up at him, craning her neck. \u201cAre there people who . . . \u201d She wasn\u2019t even sure how to phrase it. \u201cWho want to do it for its own sake?\u201d\n Aram\u012bn stepped away from the chair and she couldn\u2019t follow him with her gaze. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cSome even have it as their abuwen. But let\u2019s get back to you.\u201d He circled her and sat back up on the top of his desk. \u201cYou are good at power raising. Not much at control, of course, since you haven\u2019t trained at all. So we\u2019ll emphasize power raising, if that\u2019s agreeable with you.\u201d\n She nodded eagerly. Aram\u012bn looked at her askance. \u201cI suspect that at this point, everything I say is going to be agreeable with you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat shall I do with you?\u201d\n She was dressed in a plain white shirt and pants. She\u2019d expected she\u2019d have to wear something more ornate for the initiation. Many, many people had formal dress as their abuwen, and it showed. Every single function or event on Eren had its complicated rules of dress, every little fold and embroidery carried reams of meaning.\n White symbolized emptiness.\n She took a deep breath and opened the door to the small waiting room.\n Aram\u012bn was waiting for her, standing up from one of the many cheap mass-produced chairs littering the HPRI building. Aram\u012bn followed her gaze to the chair. \u201cWe make do with what we have,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cCome.\u201d\n She stepped closer and saw he was holding a roll of some kind of tape or ribbon in his hand.\n \u201cThis is to symbolize your submission to my will and my control,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the duration of our cooperation. That is, if you are still willing.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d Her words felt too overwrought, too verbose. She took a breath. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n Aram\u012bn didn\u2019t miss the subtlety. He nodded appreciatively and smiled, a brief interruption in the ashen solemnity of his emotions.\n \u201cTurn around.\u201d\n She did so.\n \u201cYour hands, please.\u201d After a moment of confusion, she put her hands behind her back and he tied them together, the fabric of the red ribbon adhering seamlessly to itself. It didn\u2019t stick to her skin. She experimentally pulled her hands apart, but the ribbon held.\n \u201cThis might be intense,\u201d Aram\u012bn said, but he didn\u2019t pause. He put another strip of red ribbon around her neck. Her breath caught and she didn\u2019t understand why\u2014the ribbon wasn\u2019t tight, it fit just the right way\u2014\n It seemed right. It seemed proper.\n She could feel Aram\u012bn\u2019s hands, hesitating midair for a moment. Then he cleared his throat and led another red strip down her back along her spine, tying the loops around her neck and hands together. Finally, he made a handle for himself at the end of a long strip, affixed between her hands, and he led her out into the hall.\n The white hall was smaller than she\u2019d expected. She recognized some people: Esesewi, standing to one side, the bright white lights overhead creating highlights on her now-serious face. Emien, gangly and sleep deprived. People she\u2019d come across in HPRI, casual acquaintances, always glad to see her even if weary and exhausted.\n Aram\u012bn walked up to a small dais with Oy\u0101run, then stood in front of her.\n Two large, muscular people stepped to her sides and one person walked up behind her. She was surrounded.\n \u201cWhy have you come here?\u201d Aram\u012bn asked, so softly and gently that she yanked her head up and stared at him in amazement.\n Then she realized she didn\u2019t know the words of the ritual. She shuddered. She opened her mouth, but she didn\u2019t know what to say.\n \u201cJust answer with your own words,\u201d Aram\u012bn added and nodded encouragingly.\n She swallowed. Her throat felt completely dry. \u201cI\u2019ve come here to join the System,\u201d she said, as simply as she could. Fewer possibilities for error that way. She struggled to think clearly despite the all-consuming fear.\n \u201cIs it your true will to join the System?\u201d he declaimed.\n She nodded, then said yes.\n \u201cDo you give me the ability to enforce your true will upon yourself, when it is perilous to stop?\u201d\n She was about to answer, but he held up a hand. \u201cWait. After you\u2019ve said yes, there won\u2019t be any turning back. I want you to know that.\u201d He looked at her like\u2014like a daughter? No, something else, some other relation. Her head swam. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\n She nodded silently.\n He raised his voice again. \u201cWhat is your answer?\u201d\n \u201cMy answer is yes.\u201d\n Aram\u012bn nodded to the assistants. They stepped to her and gripped her arms, her shoulders. They held her in place.\n \u201cThe people of the Free State of Eren support you,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe people are here to catch you if you stumble and fall. You will not have to face the pain alone.\u201d He paused.\n She shuddered. The assistants held her strong.\n \u201cWith the power vested in me by the people of Eren and the Ways,\u201d he stepped forward and placed a hand on top of her bare head, \u201cI take control.\u201d\n His voice had\u2014if not his own m\u0101wal\u2014the power of the ages and the expanses behind it. Her legs gave way. The people didn\u2019t allow her to fall to her knees. Her shoulders hurt as she was held up.\n Aram\u012bn went on. \u201cI swear I will only act for the benefit of all sentience. I swear I will only cause pain when necessary, and I will not subject you to anything beyond your capacity to handle, as far as I can estimate.\u201d\n He took his hand off her head and pulled out a small implement from the folds of his clothing. A\u2014dagger of some sort? With some kind of force field in place of the blade. Her eyes flickered to the blade, to his face, to his fingers gripping the handle all too strongly\u2014\n \u201cThis is to remind me of my oath,\u201d he said and rammed the blade into his open palm.\n Her breath caught. The field did not wound, there was no blood, no scar\u2014but a whip of pain ran through his entire body, so intense that Oy\u0101run could not help feeling it herself.\n \u201cI know what I demand,\u201d he said in an undertone. \u201cRemember, always remember, I will only cause pain when necessary.\u201d\n He yanked her chin up and pushed the blade into the middle of her forehead.\n She screamed, her screams resonating inside her skull, and she fell, fell into darkness, and the people held her strong, and would not let go.\n 2.\n Oy\u0101run was floating, her body out of sync with her mind. Was she lying on a bed? Was she\u2014\n Aram\u012bn\u2019s words circled in her head; she knew she had to hold on to them, preserve their meaning at all costs. The scene played in her head, over and over, in a loop. She no longer understood the words.\n Spiders, insects, mythical aliens of yore, he had said. Symbolic of the phylogenetically oldest parts of the nervous system, the ones most inaccessible to acting consciousness. Aversion is normal; in general, one does not want the acting consciousness to trespass there.\n Most of the time, that is. A flicker of a smile. You will need to go there; you will need to welcome these parts into yourself. Give yourself over. We will keep you safe.\n We will keep you safe.\n She made an attempt to reach out. Her arms were tied down with wide straps and the feeling of the out-of-phase representation of her hand reaching out and passing through the straps spooked her. Where was she? What was going on? She knew she was supposed to remember. Was this an out-of-body experience? Could she simply float away?\n She found it harder and harder to keep a hold on her consciousness, until it simply drifted away, her drifting away with it, floating on the streams, bobbing up and down.\n It was black and gleaming like chitinous shapes; it was white and porous, desiccated; it was metallic quicksilver, protean, ever changing. It was translucent.\n It reached out to Oy\u0101run with sharp thin legs, and as she moved closer, she saw the legs ended in talons, but she knew it was good this way. She did not feel the supposed aversion.\n Ten-eight, looking nominal so far.\n Still, keep an eye on sub-layer E for adverse reactions.\n She only knew, with a certainty of ages-old declarations, the bedrock of civilization, that while it was fundamentally alien and inhuman, it was a part of her, now and forever, extending into all dimensions of time and space.\n If it was her, then the only natural impulse was to unify, merge, draw it close.\n It wanted to eat her, and she knew she had to be cut apart and consumed, that was why she was there, in this fogged-over landscape extending into infinity\u2014\n It needed to devour her, and she could feel its urgency inside herself, in her stomach, in her chest. In the core.\n It needed to flay her, first of all.\n So many sharp legs!\n Spiking over F2. Looks nice and clean.\n Yes, excellent response . . . very clean so far.\n Cutting and slicing, holding fast.\n Blood flowing ever so slowly, as if time itself gradually came to a halt.\n The pain was there, but the pain was good, it was only a part of the process and it showed the process itself had not ceased to move along;\n it wanted to merge, to pull apart the muscles and nestle close\u2014\n bursting out into millions of tiny tendrils, lodging itself in the flesh\u2014\n pulling apart the spinal column, running up golden yellow and burning hot into the brain, all of a sudden very fast\u2014\n searing mere thought with its touch, and she screamed, screamed, and screamed\u2014\n Of course, proceeding as planned.\n There was only her and the being, alien and immense, an impenetrable monolithic sentience come face-to-face with her. There was nothing else.\n It was so much bigger than her!\n Yet she could not shirk away. It was inside her, it was her, it was beautiful and hungry.\n She gave in.\n Oy\u0101run was lost in the moment. How much time had passed? She was still there, face-to-face, merging, howling in pain and in raw, bare need, holding it close and being cut apart. People were speaking, passing messages. So many levels of the real, and she could pass between each of them with the barest thought, the faintest gesture . . .\n She was tied to a machine, some kind of complicated apparatus, with many thin-limbed surgical instruments issuing forth from a central hub\u2014\n the spider was eating her, feasting on her, embedding itself into her\u2014\n She\u2019s taking well to the implantation. Switching to DF for some testing.\n Take it slow, there\u2019s no need to hurry.\n She was yanked back into her physical body with a suddenness that took away her breath; all around her everything was white and spotless and metallic and clean, more unreal in its sharpness than anything she\u2019d experienced.\n She was being disassembled, reassembled\u2014her thoughts were crystal clear.\n She looked down on her left arm, flaps folded apart like in some medical demonstration, skin flayed. She felt no horror, no apprehension, but no detachment either; she was there, in the moment, and the moment was there for her.\n Someone was monitoring her mind, from up close. She reassured the person and the person reassured her in kind. She felt a vague urge to merge, but instead she floated, floated high, drifted away . . .\n I\u2019d say she needs a break, one of the voices said, and she wished to respond that everything was all right, but then there was no more of her, and no more of the voice.\n Oy\u0101run was lying on a hospital bed, all very white and clean and comfortable. She sank into the pillow and the shape-forming mattress. She was tired like generations, her body heavy as stone in a bed of white fluff, in a white room, completely surrounded, wrapped in a thick blanket . . . was it all really so white, or had her mind stopped making sense of her surroundings altogether? Was it only a simulation or a mindscape?\n Either way, she relished the soft sensation all over her body\u2014calming, relaxing, peaceful. Her skin felt raw, chiseled away until it was the thinnest film covering her self.\n She made an attempt to tilt her head\u2014so hard. Her skull felt filled with sharp-edged objects sliding on each other.\n Her left arm was lying on top of the blanket. She was wearing a long-sleeved shirt of some sort. Her skin looked unchanged. She tried her hardest to lift her hand, but she could only rotate it a little; still, she got a better view. As the muscles in her hand shifted, she noticed the faint lines embedded in the flesh\u2014or was she imagining things?\n She sighed a hoary, raspy sigh, and relaxed, her body giving up in exhaustion even though she was no longer in pain.\n Aram\u012bn was sitting by Oy\u0101run\u2019s bedside. Mentally checking some kind of computer readout? He glanced up when he noticed she\u2019d shifted in bed.\n \u201cHow are you feeling? All the parameters we\u2019re monitoring are well within boundaries.\u201d He nodded at a corner of the ceiling.\n She still felt very weak, but no longer heavy as stone. She could speak. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said with only a modicum of effort.\n \u201cDon\u2019t overexert yourself.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt all went very smoothly.\u201d\n She wanted to laugh, but she could not manage more than a cough. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel that smooth to me.\u201d\n \u201cTrust me, we\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d Did she glimpse a twinkle in his eye? He looked down and ran a hand over his overcoat, even its muted aubergine a burst of color in the bare white room. When he spoke again, his voice was sober. \u201cYou are well-suited for this kind of transformation. I\u2019m very satisfied with the results so far.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean, we should\u2019ve done this sooner?\u201d She fought an urge to grin at him. She felt giddy.\n He cleared his throat. \u201cWe could\u2019ve done this sooner, yes. Still, I am satisfied.\u201d Again, a pause. \u201cThere is attrition at every stage. Every stage you pass is an accomplishment in itself.\u201d\n She closed her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t really do anything.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s precisely the point. You did not offer resistance. It will only get harder.\u201d\n She thought of all the recordings, the logs in the Oral History Archives, running them through her mind. She finally grinned as the familiarity of the situation dawned on her. \u201cIs this the point where you ask how well I can tolerate pain?\u201d\n \u201cYou know I only ask that to get a rise out of people.\u201d He sounded vaguely entertained; or was she imagining it? She opened her eyes to look at him. Still she wasn\u2019t sure.\n \u201cTo get a rise out of people and to watch for their reactions,\u201d she remarked. Watching for his reaction.\n \u201cThat too.\u201d He was unperturbed.\n She chuckled.\n He leaned back in his chair, stretching. \u201cSo, tell me, how well can you tolerate pain?\u201d\n Oy\u0101run was still slightly unsteady on her feet; her body was still slightly unfamiliar. Heavier, but just a little; definitely firmer. She still habitually poked at the implants protruding from her skull, her spinal column. Not enough space to squeeze everything into the body, she surmised. She didn\u2019t change the way she tied her headscarf. Some of the protrusions showed, but she didn\u2019t particularly mind. She had not ventured outside yet, and she was curious about the looks she would get, if also somewhat intimidated. Admiration mixed with apprehension? Patriotic pride? She could not begin to guess at people\u2019s complicated feelings.\n Aram\u012bn pushed her to start practicing almost as soon as she could get around unassisted. He came for her, led her into a small room designated for the purpose.\n \u201cI\u2019ve seen the results of the tests, but let\u2019s just do another round,\u201d he said in a way that sounded oddly measured, even from him. He instructed her to raise m\u0101wal, focus it in specific parts of the body, outside the body. She complied. What was he getting at? Her apprehension grew, even though everything he asked for she could do with ease, and with a smoothness that surprised even her. Maybe this really is my path, she thought. She was caught up in the routine, at home within it, fitting in.\n He came to an abrupt halt, fell silent. \u201cI should\u2019ve tried to get a rise out of you,\u201d he said quietly.\n She blinked at him, feeling her eyes grow large. \u201cYes?\u201d What was he getting at?\n \u201cThere are many kinds of pain,\u201d he said, his words cautious, feeling their way ahead. \u201cMost we can decrease, manage. But there is a kind of pain that is tied to the essence of the self, and that\u2019s intractable to medical manipulations. It\u2019s tied to the m\u0101wal, and . . . \u201d He looked down at the mats covering the floor with no gap between them, fitting together like puzzle pieces. \u201cThe only way is to simply get used to it. Nothing else can be done. It cannot be minimized.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t understand his distress. \u201cI\u2019m all right with that,\u201d she reassured him, to no effect.\n \u201cNot everyone can get used to it.\u201d\n \u201cYou expect me to fail,\u201d she said with forced nonchalance.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve done well so far,\u201d he said, a trifle too fast. \u201cBut even the . . . exercises we can perform do not compare to a live run.\u201d\n He really did expect her to fail. He thought he\u2019d been too lucky to have her? Things had gone too smoothly so far? She didn\u2019t understand. He\u2019d done this so many times before. What was different this time? On occasion he felt weary to her. Was it the repetition? Was he feeling his age? It puzzled her, and she grew impatient.\n \u201cExpectations shape reality,\u201d she snapped.\n He looked up, stared at her dead on. \u201cThen show me you\u2019re stronger than me.\u201d\n This time she was the first to look away.\n She could feel his disappointment; faint, but still present. I\u2019ll show him, she thought and gritted her teeth.\n \u201cWe can induce this kind of pain. Gradually at first, as much as this can be done gradually. As we raise the thresholds, we can get more and more m\u0101wal throughput. Until you\u2019re ready for a live run.\u201d He rubbed his face. \u201cAs much as people can be ready for a live run. Nobody is.\u201d\n I will show you, she thought at him with newfound ferocity.\n He opened a section of the wall. She could see the equipment stored inside. \u201cYou might\u2019ve noticed that this room was soundproofed.\u201d\n \u201cMost rooms in the Institute are,\u201d she said.\n \u201cExactly.\u201d He pulled out a red ring of tape. He opened it, clapped it around his wrist. \u201cWe can be explicit about everything, we need not have smoke screens and obfuscation, like in the times of the old seers and magicians. More understanding doesn\u2019t break the process.\u201d\n He walked to one end of the room, opened another segment, and pulled out a tall, thick pole of some sort, almost like a column. He walked with it to the center of the room and began to affix it; there was a shape precut into the mats that he could simply pop out to fix the pole to clamps on the floor below. He twisted and something popped out on top, attached itself to the ceiling. He grabbed the pole and pulled at it strongly. It held.\n \u201cI have no wish to humiliate you, to degrade you. I only need to cause you pain. Unlike the people of old, we know this is sufficient. What they did to the Imperial Seers was not only inefficient but actively harmful.\u201d He unclasped the ring from his wrist. \u201cThis time, I\u2019m going to tie you to the pole.\u201d He gestured for her to step closer.\n She stepped to the pole, put her back to it, obediently allowed him to tie her hands behind the pole. \u201cThe world axis, if you will,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tree connecting the worlds. Many mythological parallels.\u201d\n He proceeded to make sure she would not be able to slump and injure herself when her muscles gave in.\n \u201cInisayu\u2019s ordeal,\u201d she offered weakly.\n \u201cInisayu was hanging from the tree upside down, according to legend. I\u2019d rather not risk popping a blood vessel in the brain, it\u2019s still quite soon after surgery.\u201d He turned away and went back to the locker, behind her. \u201cBefore you get carried away, know that I have knives and a whip, and I intend to use them.\u201d A sound of cloth on cloth\u2014what was he doing?\n When he walked again in front of her, she saw. He\u2019d removed his trademark overcoat. He still wore a richly decorated dark blue vest over a loose shirt and implements like knife handles hung from his belt. A harness was also hanging from it, housing what looked like a long, yellow, softly glowing tentacle.\n He unclipped a handle from his belt and grabbed it in his palm. A glowing blade\u2014some kind of force field?\u2014sprung from it. She recognized the tool as the one he\u2019d jammed into his palm. His own reaction had been strong enough that it physically hurt her, even though his face had remained impassive. \u201cI can see you remember this,\u201d he said.\n Her muscles spasmed. Her body remembered it before her mind.\n \u201cYes.\u201d He smoothed over her forehead with his free hand. \u201cYou definitely recall that.\u201d The touch strengthened the memory, and it hurt\u2014\n \u201cFocused pain can throw the system off-balance in the desired way. It can overactivate the m\u0101wal-raising process . . . \u201d His voice drifted away. \u201cWe can try. We will go slowly at first. Allow me to demonstrate. Very slowly at first. I am going to put this into the chest center.\u201d He indicated the position in the middle of her chest with a long finger. She knew he could not see the way the m\u0101wal flowed throughout her body, but he must\u2019ve done this so many times it was second nature. He pointed at just the right spot. \u201cThen we can do the other centers, but first I want you to be familiar with the sensation.\u201d\n She nodded assent. He plunged in the blade, through her clothing\u2014the force field did not wound, only\u2014\n She screamed, strained against the bindings.\n \u201cI\u2019ve pulled it out. That was the lowest setting, and only for a moment. We will need to increase both the duration and the amount, slowly, but surely.\u201d\n Her entire torso felt like it was on fire.\n \u201cDo you think you can take that for a bit longer?\u201d\n Her thoughts clumped together, and her tongue tripped over the sounds she wanted to make.\n \u201cBgh\u2014bh\u2014ah\u2014I think.\u201d\n \u201cExcellent.\u201d Did he sound more satisfied than ever before? \u201cThen let\u2019s do it again. Eight seconds, do you think you can take eight seconds?\u201d\n She could.\n She gasped for air once it was over. Her limbs twitched.\n \u201cOnce more. Maybe we can try sixteen seconds. I\u2019m counting.\u201d\n She drew in a deep breath.\n \u201cExhale. If you keep in air, it makes it worse. Try to breathe slowly, evenly. A few breaths before we start . . . \u201d\n She exhaled. Inhaled. Exhaled again. Inhaled.\n \u201cGood. Not very deep, you don\u2019t want to hyperventilate. That can come in handy at times, but it can also cause unwanted complications. It\u2019s best to be careful.\u201d\n She nodded.\n \u201cI\u2019m starting. One . . . two . . . Breathe evenly. Four. Five.\u201d\n Her entire body was tense like a closed fist. The world narrowed to one burning point in her chest. Her consciousness floated, back and forward, out of sync with her body.\n \u201cEight. Nine.\u201d\n She could do this. She could do this.\n The m\u0101wal ran through her in large shudders, the air thickening. She found it harder and harder to breathe. Fire to rend the flesh from the bones.\n She could do this. She had to. She struggled to build a balance. She thought she could take this for longer. Not indefinitely, but longer. Longer.\n \u201cTwelve. Thirteen.\u201d\n Almost over. Almost over.\n \u201cFourteen. I think you can take more.\u201d\n She nodded, genuinely believing she could. Aram\u012bn pulled up her chin with one quick and practiced movement, pushed her head against the pole. Her eyes widened in surprise.\n Aram\u012bn stabbed another dagger into the middle of her forehead.\n Later, she did not even know if she had screamed. The world collapsed around her, the searing and yet immaterial flames of the m\u0101wal licking at the walls, filling the chamber with a ferocious thundering noise. Everything rushed through her, all at once, and her consciousness blinked out.\n When she came to, she was still tied to the pole.\n \u201cThere, that was doable, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n For a long while, she was unable to respond.\n Oy\u0101run was lying on a slab, tied down tight. The right sleeve of her white shirt was rolled up above the elbow.\n Aram\u012bn was putting daggers through her right arm, one after another. He kept up the talk.\n \u201cThe first one goes into the center of the palm. An important location. The second just below the wrist, where the radius and the ulna meet. Another in the middle of the forearm. Yet another in the inner elbow. Remember, it works through fabric, but this time I want you to be able to see the sites.\u201d\n She was taking short, gasping breaths.\n \u201cGood, you are doing good. I\u2019m not going to do anything sudden this time. You\u2019ve made a lot of progress. It\u2019s time to rest.\u201d\n Tears were streaming down her face.\n \u201cThis is something you can do for yourself. Just one arm. Either the right or the left. I\u2019m going to take these out and untie you, and then you can try.\u201d\n She sat up, trembling. Her fingers closed around the handle of the dagger, but without any force, and she dropped it in her lap, wincing even though it was turned off.\n Aram\u012bn picked up the dagger, handed it to her again. Calmly, patiently, without any urgency.\n She fumbled the catch again. A sob wracked her.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hurry. Take your time.\u201d\n She managed to hold the blade on the third attempt.\n \u201cGood. That\u2019s a good first step.\u201d\n She turned on the field. Pushed the blade into her palm, all the way to the hilt. Her fingers closed around the handle automatically.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come out unless you pull it out. You don\u2019t need to worry about it. I can give you another one . . . Here. There, I can show you the spot.\u201d\n He gently guided her hand. \u201cGood, now push.\u201d\n She did.\n \u201cTwo more. All right? You could take that when I was doing it.\u201d\n She nodded, forcing out her words from between clenched teeth. \u201cThat was . . . easier.\u201d\n \u201cYes, passivity is easier for some people, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m making you do this for a reason.\u201d\n She nodded again, her neck muscles painfully spasming. She pushed away the impulse to rub her neck. Two more.\n She looked at her arm, the hilts of the four daggers poking upward. She held down her arm with her other hand, tried to steady the shaking. Tried to calm the m\u0101wal, reroute the disrupted flow, deal with the excess.\n \u201cGreat.\u201d He praised her so much these days, she thought, but always in such a detached manner . . . She cradled her arm to herself. It felt like it was becoming a burning white conduit for all the power in the universe. She wasn\u2019t sure she could keep this up for much longer.\n \u201cRelax. Just a few moments . . . Good. Now you can try to remove them. Very slowly. One by one. No rash movements. You know what rash movements lead to, right?\u201d\n The inside of her forehead lit up with the memory of an excruciating feeling. She was very, very cautious.\n \u201cThere. Now you see you have control over the process.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014I thought I was supposed to be helpless,\u201d she offered. Even her lips felt numb, worn out from stimulus overload.\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to be helpless, that\u2019s inevitable. Nothing can persist in the face of the raw stream.\u201d He glanced away for a moment. \u201cBut it\u2019s imperative for you to understand that you do have control, as much as it\u2019s possible, even if you are helpless, even if you are made helpless, you have some measure of control.\u201d\n He had taken to repeating himself, she thought. Was this some kind of technique, too?\n \u201cI am going to give you that control. And then I\u2019m going to make you helpless, and you\u2019re going to hold on to what you have left. Once this is over and you\u2019re standing in that point, nothing of you is going to remain, nothing, except this. This will remain. This will remain.\u201d\n \u201cThe\u2014the shaking isn\u2019t stopping,\u201d she said, and he sat next to her, held her trembling body to himself.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to pass,\u201d he said.\n She broke down in sobs.\n \u201cShh.\u201d He cradled her head in one hand. His touch was unexpectedly soothing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to pass.\u201d\n Eventually, it did.\n \u201cI\u2019m always worried that one day you\u2019re going to just walk out, leave me there when I\u2019m all tied up and the blades are in,\u201d Oy\u0101run said as they were preparing for another session. He was busy with the pole\u2014the bottom catches did not want to hold.\n \u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be here. Even when you\u2019ll have to face the stream, I\u2019m going to be there.\u201d The catch finally clicked in place. \u201cI cannot be there in the mind, but I can be there, taking care of you, what of you exists in physical reality.\u201d He straightened up, looked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s going to make it a fraction easier. Just a fraction, but easier.\u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she offered in a wavering voice, even though she knew he was not doing this for her sake\u2014he was doing it for the sake of success. Or was he?\n Her world was the chamber, poles and slabs and circular and rectangular frames and the four walls. Chained to a wall. Tied to a frame.\n Sometimes she threw up, sometimes she spat blood. Her blood was no longer red; it was opalescent and colorless.\n The floor drank up everything, the stains disappearing at a speed discernible to the naked eye.\n The world was a burning tree of fire and she was chained to the tree and stabbed with knives of ice. The world was a swirling circle of storm clouds and she was tied to the circle and whipped with lashes of lightning.\n She lost control. Over and over again. At times they had to interrupt\u2014the first time it happened, Aram\u012bn said the wards in the walls wouldn\u2019t hold, and she realized there was some kind of m\u0101wal technology inside the walls, hidden from casual observation, redirecting the excess. She only hoped the walls wouldn\u2019t come down one day. Surely Aram\u012bn would not let that happen\u2014he had control over her nervous system, he could shut down her consciousness if the immediate need arose.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t allow me to bring down the Institute, right?\u201d Oy\u0101run was feeling especially discouraged that day.\n \u201cHmm?\u201d Aram\u012bn turned to her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n She spread her hands. \u201cThere\u2019s . . . there\u2019s so much destructive power.\u201d In me. She could not bring herself to finish the sentence, say the words out loud.\n \u201cYou were not built to destroy,\u201d Aram\u012bn said. \u201cYou were built to sustain.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run lifted the whip, a long plastic tentacle, gingerly wrapped it around her lower arm\u2014it didn\u2019t have a handle. The pain burned, but it was manageable.\n A thought struck her. \u201cWith this one, the user can\u2019t help to feel pain, either.\u201d\n \u201cExactly.\u201d Aram\u012bn nodded.\n She made a little lashing motion, little more than a wave. \u201cBut that means . . . \u201d She pursed her lips.\n \u201cYes, I also feel pain when I\u2019m using this one.\u201d His face was smooth, unexpressive.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d\n \u201cIt is a reminder.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run was tied to a circle frame, handles sticking out of all the primary and secondary m\u0101wal centers of her body. She was breathing slowly, evenly.\n \u201cThirty-two minutes,\u201d Aram\u012bn said and put the whip back into its holster. \u201cThis will have to be enough.\u201d\n She grunted, beyond speech.\n \u201cIf you cannot pass the initial acclimatization in this amount of time, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said, more abruptly than usual.\n Was he afraid?\n He began to remove the force field blades, quickly, as if urged on by someone else. \u201cI have given you this amount of time, now you have to do something with it.\u201d\n She stumbled forward as he untied her, her muscles giving. He cradled her, but she felt hesitation in his posture.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.\n Aram\u012bn stared into her eyes, then something intangible swooshed across his face, and his expression changed. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He helped her to the slab, sat her down on the ground with her back to one side. \u201cMay the universe itself forgive me, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n III.\n 1.\n There was an entire team standing by.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go over this once again,\u201d Aram\u012bn said. \u201cWe need constant high throughput. I know you can induce it, but for the first time, I\u2019m going to override some functions and induce it in you myself. Less room for error. The goal is not the pain. The pain is initially inevitable, but it is not desirable. I have given you the ability to manage it. Your mind will tune into the raw stream of the System and you are going to acclimatize. You are going to belong, to attach. You will need to learn how to process your new sensory environment, how to interact with it. Avoid your usual patterns. Try not to hold on to things, try not to treat them as conventional objects.\u201d\n Emien helped him out; she was standing by in case of an emergency that might need a m\u0101wal\u0113ni. \u201cThis cannot be explained; this can only be experienced,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Aram\u012bn nodded. \u201cAny last-minute advice you could offer?\u201d\n Emien shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s ineffable. I don\u2019t think I can say anything about it. Try not to resist it; it resists back.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run was strapped down, but she could breathe freely. This was the moment she had practiced for, all the time spent in that chamber with its walls drinking up the m\u0101wal, its floor drinking up her blood.\n \u201cAll parameters within nominal range,\u201d a tech said, looking up from her instrumentation. \u201cSay the word and it\u2019s a go.\u201d\n Aram\u012bn stepped to her. \u201cShow an En\u0101y\u016bw\u0113 transform.\u201d He paused, examining the image with the aid of his interface. \u201cMm. Looks neat.\u201d He began to pace. \u201cLet me look at the settings . . . I\u2019d prefer a smooth buildup, avoid the exponential. B-W of around five.\u201d\n Nods around the room.\n He turned to Oy\u0101run. \u201cWe are ready whenever you are.\u201d\n \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said, and Aram\u012bn raised a hand\u2014\n The m\u0101wal rushed up her spine, faster, faster, forced by her systems controlled externally for the time being. She did not mind being taken over in this manner\u2014one less thing to track, to manage, to maintain.\n There was more and more. It seemed to her that the room had become transparent, and she could see through everything, even though her eyes were closed.\n No pain so far. She was so used to this, her pain threshold was considerably elevated. Yet it did not come as a relief. She\u2019d gotten used to pain to the point that it was comforting, and the lack nagged at her.\n \u201cTell the System they can begin syncing,\u201d Aram\u012bn said outside. She was inside looking out, inside her own body, yet her mind was expanding, ballooning outward\u2014\n And it was there, the stream of the System, faster and more powerful than anything before, and she struggled not to get swept away.\n The waves of power battered at her, and as she tried to pick out individual details, they rushed away from her. It was like sitting on the overhead train that passed just below the canopy and staring out\u2014if she tried to focus her eyes on anything nearby, it would get yanked out of sight and her eyes would almost hurt from the effort of the tracking.\n Everything all came at her, at the same time. No rest. No reprieve. She could not hold on to anything, there was always something more, something new and searingly bright and manifold. She could not cram it all into her skull.\n She was trying to relax, trying to keep herself from hyperventilating, but it wasn\u2019t working, her fingers were tingling\u2014\n \u201cOverride the voluntary respiratory control,\u201d Aram\u012bn yelled outside. \u201cWe cannot risk any more vasoconstriction\u2014\u201d\n The systems clamped down on her hard, overrode her pattern of breathing. Momentary respite.\n Inside, the stream still ate away at her. How could she ever get used to this? She struggled, to no avail. She held on for dear life\u2014\n \u201cLet go,\u201d Aram\u012bn spoke right next to her body outside, and it took her some time to realize that he was talking to her, firmly, ordering her. \u201cDo not resist. Do not resist.\u201d\n I\u2019m not resisting, she wanted to say as she hung on with tooth and nail, I\u2019m trying\u2014\n Then, an image of the train hurtling past and her sitting on board, staring out, eyes relaxed and taking in the cramped vista passing by without trying to fixate on any single object.\n A change.\n A letting go.\n Something shifted inside her and there was no more pain, no more of the onslaught, just ceaseless joy and the smooth motion of coasting along the stream.\n She did not remember anything else.\n Oy\u0101run was close to tears. \u201cI\u2014I know I was there, and it was beautiful, but I don\u2019t remember\u2014I don\u2019t remember anything else\u2014\u201d She gestured broadly with her arms.\n \u201cThe two kinds of sensory environments are absolutely different and ineffable from the point of view of each other,\u201d he explained slowly and carefully. \u201cYour self here has little to no access to your memories there, and vice versa, your self there has little access to your memories here.\u201d\n \u201cBut I\u2014\u201d\n He went on. \u201cIt\u2019s a quite extreme version of state-specific recall. We\u2019ve been through this before.\u201d\n She looked at him, her eyes pleading, and she would have inwardly shuddered at how she might appear to him, begging thus, had she not been past shame. He had seen her screaming in agony, certain the next moment was going to be the last\u2014and he had always been there for her.\n Would he desert her now? Would he fail to help her?\n \u201cIs it always like this?\u201d she muttered.\n \u201cEventually there\u2019s some cross talk. You remember more. But it\u2019s always in the form of vague impressions, at most. Relatively few substantial memories carry over.\u201d\n \u201cIt was beautiful\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to remain so, and you\u2019re only going to see more of it, not less.\u201d\n Her face crumpled up. She couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cBut I can\u2019t remember\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou remember a little. And what you remember is beautiful.\u201d He drew back from her. \u201cIs that not so?\u201d\n She lowered her head. \u201cIt\u2019s true. But I\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t find the words.\n \u201cYou crave it.\u201d\n She looked up, surprised. Did he know her better than herself? Of course, she reminded herself, he\u2019d seen this over and over. He\u2019d seen many people go through this when they joined the System.\n \u201cI crave it!\u201d She threw her words in his face. He did not flinch. \u201cI crave it and I need it and I\u2014\u201d She was shaking, not with the m\u0101wal, but with desperation. Was there a difference? Power crested in her.\n \u201cShh.\u201d He drew her to himself. She sniffled into his overcoat. \u201cAnd you will receive it. Perpetuate it. It\u2019s yours.\u201d\n And yet behind his words was the awareness of time ticking down, of life ebbing away. The transformation shortened the life span. Everything had a price.\n She clutched him and shook with tears.\n \u201cThe first time it took us two days to get you back to your baseline state, after just an hour of being in the System. Expect the same this time around as well. It takes a long time to work up to the norms.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Oy\u0101run said, resigned. She was bone weary, more despondent than exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Aram\u012bn remained silent, but he beheld her with a quizzical expression.\n \u201cYou were right. About every single thing you\u2019ve ever told me.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t say I told you so. He didn\u2019t even think of it, she could tell. He looked at her with sadness, or only exhaustion? Probably the latter, Oy\u0101run decided. \u201cDo you regret your choice now?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo, and that\u2019s the worst part of it.\u201d\n He sat down, heavily. \u201cHate me. I can be easily hated. After all, I am generally considered a monster.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d\n \u201cHm?\u201d Was that actually unpleasant news to him, Oy\u0101run wondered\u2014did he want to be regarded as a monster?\n \u201cI\u2019ve read the testimonials of your coworkers. In the Oral History Archives. Did you know . . . \u201d She felt too tired to speak. \u201cThe closer someone was to you during the War of Independence, the more likely they were to speak highly of you.\u201d\n He leaned forward slightly. \u201cYou ran correlations on that? \u201d Then he shook his head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have chosen this path. You should\u2019ve chosen something . . . anything.\u201d\n \u201cThis was what I wanted. It\u2019s not negotiable.\u201d\n \u201cNot any longer, definitely. Even if you were to walk away from the System, the transformation is irreversible.\u201d\n Silence.\n Aram\u012bn spoke up first. \u201cYou\u2019re only going to grow farther away from me. You went through your transformation, I helped you go through it, but my task is done for the most part. I taught you what I could. I try to keep an eye on everyone, check in from time to time, but that\u2019s basically it.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cMy time is finite.\u201d Was he pushing her away? Some part of him was, she decided. But was that the entirety of him?\n \u201cI can pray with you,\u201d she offered.\n Aram\u012bn startled, for once. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n She tried to backpedal. \u201cOr just listen to you praying. I find it beautiful.\u201d She swallowed, something uncomfortable occurring to her. \u201cWill you pray for me too, once I\u2019m gone?\u201d I will leave this world before you.\n He understood the implications. \u201cI can, I definitely can.\u201d He bowed his head formally\u2014in the new Ereni manner, she realized. \u201cI take solace in the fact that you desire that.\u201d\n 2.\n They strode along the snaking, winding corridors of the industrial area surrounding Memorial Park.\n \u201cSo how are you faring? The reports only say everything is in order, but they cannot tell me about how you feel.\u201d Aram\u012bn lifted a hand and adjusted his cap just a little. \u201cYou\u2019re up to the ten-hour limit now.\u201d\n \u201cYes, and . . . it\u2019s fine. It still takes a bit long to recuperate after my shift, they\u2019re telling me that it should go faster . . . \u201d\n \u201cI can look at the logs,\u201d Aram\u012bn offered. \u201cSee if anything jumps out to me, anything that could be adjusted.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, that\u2019d be great.\u201d Oy\u0101run smiled\u2014a carefree, relaxed smile despite the circles around her eyes. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s going well.\u201d\n \u201cAnd how do you like it?\u201d\n \u201cI like it . . . \u201d She paused, took a deep breath. \u201cLet\u2019s not try to evade this? Let\u2019s be honest. It\u2019s vast, it\u2019s gigantic, and it\u2019s tearing me apart. And despite that I\u2019m always back for more.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d Was he really? Did she want him to be sorry, at all? \u201cThat\u2019s the way things are.\u201d This much was true.\n \u201cI love it. The worst part is the switchover when I realize I\u2019m out, out of the stream, and I want to claw my way back in . . . \u201d Her voice sounded all too loud in the deserted, echoing corridor. \u201cI want to go back, I crave it, every single moment. It never goes away. I can push it back, but it never goes away.\u201d\n He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, I know.\u201d He pulled at his left sleeve, to make it look just right. \u201cHow much do you actually remember?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not . . . it\u2019s not really remembering. But more carries over. It scares me a little. I\u2019m not supposed to be able to do that, and yet.\u201d She hesitated. It seemed like too large a thing to say, too large for words. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about it. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m . . . maybe it\u2019s because I was born planetside? I always had my interface, and that was also very seamless for me. Maybe the two could be combined?\u201d\n Aram\u012bn frowned, and in that instant he appeared more like the scientist he was than ever before. \u201cThe planetary computer networks and the System?\u201d He considered it seriously, Oy\u0101run could tell. He was taking her seriously. \u201cInformation is information, after all. Maybe in a few generations.\u201d\n Oy\u0101run nodded cheerfully. \u201cThey could be combined somehow. I think that would be great. Sometime down along the line.\u201d\n \u201cIs that you saying that, or is that the System?\u201d\n She stopped dead in surprise.\n \u201cThe connection goes both ways,\u201d he said, stopping just a fraction of a second after she did. Always keeping an eye on her. \u201cThe influence goes both ways.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014You\u2019re right.\u201d She massaged her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She lowered her hands and looked at him, entirely clueless. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then a torrent of words poured out all of a sudden: \u201cHow much of me is me? It\u2019s inside me but I\u2019m also inside it, I help making it what it is, and it also makes me into what I am, and I\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShh. I know. Let\u2019s walk.\u201d\n She obediently fell into pace next to him.\n \u201cI have been suspecting that the System is trying to pass me messages,\u201d he said. \u201cI get small signals. My environment changing in subtle ways. Trees dropping their leaves, lights flickering when I pass by. People blurting out sentences they themselves cannot explain. The way the m\u0101wal is supposed to operate. A lot depends on the carrier; with most people, complex information just doesn\u2019t make it across. So far, all I had were fragments, but now some of them at least have fallen into a pattern. A pattern I can understand,\u201d he emphasized, and there was something in his voice that for a moment did not bridge the gap between the two of them.\n \u201cA pattern you can understand?\u201d she asked, uncomprehending.\n \u201cI can understand the hunger to control.\u201d There, a piece of the puzzle she\u2019d been looking for. Right there. \u201cI can understand the hunger to expand.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s . . . shaped by us, but in turn it\u2019s shaped by you,\u201d she offered weakly.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cIndirectly. We are affected by you because you trained us, and we are in the System, so it makes sense . . . for the System to be affected by you.\u201d Your cognotype. The words remained unspoken.\n He laughed all of a sudden, his laughter shrill and sharp like knives. Like the crack of a whip. \u201cBy me? Oh yes! A thousand times yes! But it makes perfect sense\u2014oh, the irony!\u201d\n She thought back on the Archive logs. People will say he is a sadist and a Falconer . . . Some of that is true . . . and him saying I suppose I do have those tendencies, nonchalant, even satisfied.\n He quieted down abruptly. His brow furrowed. \u201cAre you bothered by this?\u201d\n She considered it for a moment. \u201cThe System is standing between here and the abyss.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly. \u201cI have seen the monsters. Some of me has. Inside.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing . . . it\u2019s necessary. I understand that.\u201d\n \u201cBut do you understand the implications?\u201d Again, the old debate; this time about a different topic, but the patterns were the same. \u201cMaybe the way this country will turn out will make people wish it had not come into existence in the first place. Maybe people will curse Eren for centuries to come.\u201d\n \u201cDo you really think that?\u201d\n \u201cI hope that\u2019s not going to be the case. But I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s more of us than there is of you,\u201d she said. With some of his merciless nature inside her.\n He stifled another laugh. \u201cIndeed.\u201d\n The corridor opened to the familiar cavern. A gust of air caught at their clothing, made Aram\u012bn\u2019s overcoat billow, deposited a large leaf on the top of his cap. A sign? A gesture from the System?\n Aram\u012bn removed the leaf, then turned it around in his hands. He was about to tuck it into a pocket, but then changed his mind and handed it to Oy\u0101run.\n \u201cWell then,\u201d Aram\u012bn said, \u201clet us pray.\u201d\n Bogi Tak\u00e1cs is a Hungarian Jewish agender trans person (e/em/eir/emself or they pronouns) and a resident alien in the US.

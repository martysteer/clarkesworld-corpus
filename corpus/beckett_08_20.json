The tide was in, obscuring the submarine roots of the settlement\u2019s forest of upthrust pipes, power mains, and chimneys climbing to the plateau. Following them to the top, Breeze kept the shot moving, zooming in on the air cannons, which were even now firing packets known as lily pads out to the Labrador Current.\nPhut! Fire one! Phut! Fire two. Each thirty-seed barrage sent ice and liquid oxygen fizzing skyward, slicing a glittering parabola into dawn skies, then splashing down over two klicks away. Breeze adjusted their goggs, taking in the process as one lily pad inflated into a bright white disk and began sending out tendrils of slush-laced cobweb to entangle with its kin. The quilts thus formed would reflect sunlight, preventing uptake by the North Atlantic, while simultaneously creating a platform for accumulating real snow and ice.\nPerfect!\nOne of the other shooters jostled them, but Breeze was big, and solidly planted. They held the shot despite the bump, taking the view wide-angle and tracking it out to the sunrise purpling the horizon.\nSnagging the primo spot on the cliff had meant showing up before dawn, when it was still pitch freezing dark, thereby beating out fifteen other videographers who\u2019d had the same great idea. Breeze scanned the periphery, weighing the competition . . . and caught a glimpse of one outlier who had apparently come to take in the view for its own sake. A police-looking type, muscly and scarred. Below the eyes, her skin was basically hamburger. Burgerface locked gazes with Breeze without moving, seeming to sense the attention.\n\u201cUm. According to others, Ogua-Lik is unceded territory. Which means\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d A ping from the Kevinsberg city manager interrupted the sputtering history flow. \u201cThere is a gig opp in freshwater loading. Accept or decline?\u201d\nBreeze saved their capture and let the gig specs fill their augmented field of vision. The offer was for an outdoor shift, but a sheltered one. Better than spraying slush onto the lily pads from the deck of an icemaker. And there\u2019d be time, after, to try to get on a sim shoot.\n\u201cAccept. Be there in twenty.\u201d Pretty pics of sun on the water and spieling about old land ownership grudges weren\u2019t going to boost them up any leaderboards anyway. Breeze needed unique footage, not stuff every other simmaker wannabe could pick up here on the cliff. \u201cEarmark my pay stub to club dues, Moil.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the app said, posting a status bar for the payout.\nResetting the goggs, Breeze turned from the rail and the rising sun. Another would-be auteur barged into their spot, narrating a take of their own: \u201c . . . tidal generators and the facility constructed around them are the core of a massive geoengineering project, life support for a planet in trouble. It\u2019s a big give for the common good, courtesy of a CEO who escaped the US with his billions intact!\u201d\nGood technique, Breeze thought. Better than mine.\nKeisha, who pretended to cynicism, said megaphilanthropy was a survival strategy. That the richies were fending off governments who\u2019d otherwise straight-up seize their money. Maybe there was truth in that.\nStill, Kev Magee\u2019s version of saving the world had a scale that appealed to the imagination. Making icebergs on an industrial scale, just to draw heat out of the oceans? Several legit sciencers had noped the idea, but Magee fought back with flotillas of in-house researchers, a veritable publishing industry devoted to Kevinsberg success metrics.\nHe\u2019d expanded beyond icebergs, too. The embroidery project laced hectares of highly reflective sheet ice across ocean spaces that used to freeze over, all on their own, decades ago. Perimeter expansion of the winter freeze, they called it. And a wildly popular innovation team, deep in the Arctic, was even now rolling out ice barges meant to somehow boost polar bear survivability.\nCould all these hundreds of thousands of tons of man-made ice, literal drops in a literal ocean, truly make a dent in the ongoing global overheat? Perhaps not. But Magee was a billionaire, and as long as he was creating gigs and homing refugees, that meant something. Breeze figured\u2014knew\u2014that serfing for a megaphilanthropist was as close as it came to getting a fresh start. It certainly beat trying to scrape by in the cross-continental shooting gallery south of the Great Lakes.\nAnd Kevinsberg had a simmaker community.\nThey took a heat lock out of the cold, back into the steady eighteen Celsius degrees that was the city ambient. Popping up their goggs as they steamed over, Breeze stripped off parka, gloves, hat, and scarf, leaving the gear in the club\u2019s communal cloak room. Aiming for a pace that would warm the body, without building up a lethally chilling sweat by the time they got to the docks, they strode from the viewpoint. They racked their brain all the way to the harbor, trying to come up with a capture nobody else would\u2019ve uploaded a thousand times over.\nThe rhythms of physical labor beat the day out swiftly. Hitch up a watership, connect hoses, check seals. Pump the tanks, next: bilge out to compost facilities, desalinized potable in. Watch the readings, ping safety checks to the dock foreperson, then unhitch the whole thing and move on to the next ship. Faster you worked, more you got for bonus.\n\u201cA bot could do this in good conditions!\u201d the dock supervisor bellowed, over clanking equipment and the howl of wind, as Breeze clumped into the reports shed at the end of the day.\n\u201cBe glad conditions are bad, then,\u201d Breeze said. Bots were scarce and pricey, and the docks could be slick. Nobody had yet written an algorithm more sophisticated than that trickster ice, with its tendency to foul gauges and metal joints, to shatter water hoses.\n\u201cThanks for that, you big Pollyanna.\u201d\n\u201cFreshwater loading\u2019s not a bad gig!\u201d Breeze insisted.\nOne of the other loaders slammed in behind them, gusting cold through the shed. \u201cHey\u2019d you hear? Magee\u2019s moving to monetize the desal operation!\u201d\n\u201cFor-profit freshwater?\u201d The supervisor scoffed. \u201cFrom fuckin\u2019 Labrador? How they gonna ship?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not, exactly. They\u2019re talking to the JobBezos foundation about pipelining it cross-continent.\u201d\n\u201cBeyond!\u201d Breeze said, earning a withering look, in stereo. \u201cHow, though?\u201d\n\u201cSteam her, pump her, spurt-spray-splash it goes west. Outflow pipes can dump the flow into all the half-dried rivers and they\u2019ll charge dams downstream for the give to their reservoirs. They call it . . . \u201d He flourished, like a magician, mittens dripping. \u201c . . . hydrotransfusion!\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re just laying a big-ass pipe dream on Global Oversight before someone claws back their cash balance for tree planting,\u201d said the supervisor.\n\u201cBut if it worked!\u201d Breeze couldn\u2019t help speaking up. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing\u2014the scale of that!\u201d\n\u201cIt means we\u2019re desperate, kid.\u201d The supervisor snorted. \u201cYou are a Pollyanna.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d The city manager app, Moil, completed their pay stub and punched them out. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go chase my dreams now.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to work a double,\u201d said the other guy, \u201cJust like every other putz in this sardine can.\u201d\n\u201cYou say poh tay toh.\u201d Waving a jaunty goodbye, Breeze made for Ashevak Park.\nThe Kevinsberg town square was a domed quarry running the length of three football fields, surrounded by thirty-story greentowers and tasked to providing city residents with a perpetual illusion of springtime. Roofed in crystal-clear nanoglass that never iced over, it was warmed by heat the city extracted from the sea. The park\u2019s lawns and flower gardens drank desalinized seawater and battened on local compost. Meadows, waterfalls, rhododendrons, scent of honeysuckle, and buzzing honeybees\u2014the whole dome was supported by steel-core pillars designed and printed by the Dorset Fine Arts Collective on Baffin Island.\nThe carvings had elevated the dome from greenhouse to temple\u2014Parthenon of the North, some called it. The Inuit pillars spoke a visual language Breeze couldn\u2019t quite decode. Rising asymmetrical columns featured smooth gray seals, ptarmigan, sleek arctic foxes morphing into albatross. Sculpted hunters paddled kayaks twenty feet up, flying amid flocks of geese and owls.\nAt ground level, the gray scale accumulation of stone depicted large-mouthed bipedal hunters on foot, rising out of clematis vines and stands of daisy to pose with harpoons. Here and there, misshapen, half-human deities seemed to climb out of the hedges. Alice screamed whenever she caught a glimpse of the monument-scale walrus woman overwatching the mint gardens.\nThe central pillar was Qilalugag, a pod of narwhals cut into porous layers of printed whalebone. The pod tapered at top and bottom, so that the whole column balanced, at its base, on a single curving horn. Looking up, viewers could see the apex of the Ashevak Park dome resting on the red-stained tail flukes of a narwhal calf.\nThree points of contact, holding up a glass house. That was the noper take on it. But actual tourists came to see Qilalugag. Came to ooh and ahh, in the flesh, at the vision of swirling monodon monceros under the stars, under the whirl of northern lights.\nIts immensity, many points of interest, and the variety of artificially cultivated environments within the quarry also meant that Ashevak Park was where most of the local sim shoots took place.\nPunched out, dues paid, Breeze picked up a pair of cannabis-laced curry skewers, printed meat with deep-fried crunchy rice packaging. Munching, they found the Orphan\u2019s Club reserved pavilion, conveniently near the casting tent. They stretched out on a patch of lawn, bumping fists with some other off-shift teens, feeling muscle-sore but pleasantly tired.\nUnlike on the docks, the chatter here stayed upbeat and hopeful. Rumor had it the current VR feature would be capturing a police foot chase. The crew would be looking for real bodies, maybe lots of them, for crowd shots.\n\u201cTake off your goggs.\u201d Tenor voice, unfamiliar accent.\nBreeze jumped. Burgerface, from this morning, was crouching in a spot Breeze had saved for Keisha. Tall, fit, with close-cropped white-blonde hair and that shiny-pink ruin of skin below the eyes, she had a twist to her speech patterns that sounded . . . Brit maybe?\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Breeze said. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWant to get noticed, let them see your face.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m widecasting headshots.\u201d\n\u201cSo\u2019s everyone else. Go on. They\u2019ll snag on me and look away. Staring\u2019s rude after all\u2014\u201d\nBreeze redirected their eyes hastily.\n\u201c\u2014they\u2019ll land on you. You got good cheekbones, Blossom, nice big eyes . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhich you\u2019re seeing, in my headshot.\u201d Reluctantly\u2014unaugmented reality was superboring\u2014Breeze pushed their goggs up. The woman fluffed a few wisps of their hair around their temples.\n\u201cHey! Mitts off! I don\u2019t know you!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Zero. Pronouns she/her. I\u2019m your Orphan Club mentor and we\u2019re roommates.\u201d\n\u201cSince when?\u201d\n\u201cSince I just took the spare bed in your pop-in.\u201d\nBreeze was crunching feels about this revelation when two things happened at once: Keisha came striding up the path, looking almost animated, and the casting agent for the crowd scene emerged from the production tent.\nExcitement surged through the gathered aspirants. Breeze refluffed the hair; Zero barely twitched her scar tissue and still managed to look smug.\n\u201cDid you hear?\u201d Keisha said breathlessly, plopping down in the nonexistent space between them and accepting the other skewer from Breeze. \u201cSomeone beheaded the EXOshell CEO in Paris!\u201d\n\u201cCalling fakenews,\u201d Breeze said, automatically.\n\u201cHi, Zero. Noping you back, Breeze\u2014there\u2019s footage.\u201d\n\u201cThey caught the killer?\u201d\n\u201cFootage of the body.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare share,\u201d Breeze said. Keisha seemed to think leaning into the stuff of nightmare would somehow make it easier to forget what things had been like before they got out of Detroit. Like filling their heads with new horrible garbage would crowd out the past\nBefore Keisha could respond, the casting agent pinged them\u2014actually pinged them! \u201cYou three\u2014step up!\u201d\n\u201cTold you,\u201d Zero said. As one they rose, obedient and eager, to get their bodies into the capture.\nEveryone wanted to be in sims, of course, so the work paid minimum gig rate. After six hours of playing crowd members while Breeze tried to take in every single thing the crew was doing to pull the shot together, the three of them punched out and trudged off, barely richer, making for the Orphans Club.\nZero, inexplicably, had energy for chitchat. \u201cHow\u2019d you two meet?\u201d\n\u201cPartnered up for a school project.\u201d\n\u201cI assumed you were lovers. Or family.\u201d\n\u201cHa! We were practically strangers.\u201d Keisha pinged Club Receiving, summoning a baggy-eyed twelve year old with a baby carriage, who verified Alice\u2019s dependent status.\nPractically strangers. Stung, Breeze forced cheer into their voice. \u201cYeah, school. Keisha\u2019s aces for math and chemistry, and I had a few levels on her in reading-writing-rhetoric. The club\u2019s StuddyBuddy app matched us when our school went kaboom.\u201d\n\u201cAll hail the mighty Orphan\u2019s Club.\u201d Keisha lifted Alice out of the carriage, settling her into a sling. Then, abruptly, she stepped behind Breeze, blocking the gaze of the two oil-stained male machinists who liked to watch from across the way, stickily zooming views of every young who came and went.\n\u201cThey bother you?\u201d Zero asked.\n\u201cThe zoomers? What do you think\u2014\u201d Keisha said.\n\u201cAll they can do is look,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cCameras everywhere, right? Supposedly the walls are laced with tasers.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Breeze, Zero,\u201d Keisha said. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping if they bury their head deep enough, they\u2019ll rediscover their innocence in the sand.\u201d\nBreeze turned away, breathing out hurt. Zero moved into a pool of light, hands on hips, catching one zoomer\u2019s eye. His leer broke on the terrain of her face, or possibly on some threat in her expression.\nMaybe rooming with a muscly type would have unexpected perks.\n\u201cLet\u2019s shift,\u201d she said.\nThey shuffled off through the corridors to Magenta block. Breeze held the door for the women as they trooped inside their pop-in. \u201cHome sweet home.\u201d\n\u201cVery posh,\u201d Zero said, tone appreciative. It was, too: four bunks, private toilet with a change station and thrice-running water\u2014cold tap, warm tap, and a locked spigot for boiled.\nAlice was the reason for the upscale accommodations\u2014and also the reason most of their allotted roommates requested new quarters after a day or two.\nBut Keisha got the baby into her crib without waking her, doing an immediate collapse onto her own bunk. Breeze pulled blankets over them both, then mixed up a bottle of printed formula for the baby, setting it in the warmer. They dug out a cube of mint tea. \u201cWant a cup?\u201d\nZero shook her head: \u201cYou take the childcare in shifts?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I pay top-ups to Orphan\u2019s Club to give Keisha breaks. And she gigs there, helping the smalls with starter math.\u201d\n\u201cKid doesn\u2019t resemble either of you.\u201d\nOblique way of pointing out that the two of them sucked at parenting? Breeze decided they were being oversensitive. \u201cWe\u2019re just fostering. Keisha was doing a nanny gig when Alice\u2019s mom vanished.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cDetroit.\u201d Before this could turn in to a heartfelt round of I\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours, Breeze took a too-hot gulp of partially diffused mint tea and gave Zero a stroke for her social capital. \u201cThanks for getting us onto the shoot today.\u201d\n\u201cStick with me, kid. Club\u2019s appointed me your fairy godmentor, what?\u201d\n\u201cMother, yeah. You\u2019ve got to be close to aging out\u2014\u201d Breeze shut up then, averting their gaze as Zero stripped off her fitted vest and body armor, revealing a torso that belonged on a classical Greek statue, with full breasts and hard-looking coral-colored nipples. Cat-light and silent, she vaulted into the bunk above Keisha.\nIf she lasts, we\u2019ll have to talk about boundaries. Breeze settled, spider delicate, into the lower bunk. They took another sip of mint, checked the laces on their boots, and shut off their hearing aids.\nIn the resulting blessed silence, they primed their goggs with a text-only scan of the latest headlines. Nothing about murdered CEOs on the official channels, but Kevinsberg censored that kind of thing, and Breeze ran a heavy-duty app, Can\u2019t Unsee, that kept things like decapitated bodies\u2014real or deepfaked\u2014off their feeds.\nThey read one aspirational squib about the proposed desalination pipeline. Engineering wet dream, said the commenters. The lingo got technical pretty fast\u2014stuff about gravity generators, forced steam at designated choke points. Lots of blahblahblah about power recovery in a closed system, and kickbacks from dams.\nIt looked good in sim, and Kevinsberg sciencers had a total #bigdreamer brand. Why not try it? The seas were overfull, and the continents were parching up.\nClosing the newsflow, Breeze brought up their lullaby app, Hayride.\nThe view of their bunk dissolved, morphing into a cart. The pop-in apartment became a sea of hypnotically waving, silent canola blossoms. Breeze fished a fauxfur-lined mitten from under their pillow, wrapping their fingers in softness. They cued the program to add in a dog.\nThey were asleep before it loaded into the picture.\nQuick haptic jolts, just above the ears, brought them out of dreams. The rig was programmed to wake Breeze every time they started trying to run, or if rate-of-breath or heartbeat stats suggested they were sinking into nightmare. Preemptively noping out of whatever horrors their subconscious was cooking up kept Breeze from whiting out entirely.\nUnhappily awake, they inhaled on a four-count, then unclenched their eyelids, feeling fight-or-flighty. The Hayride app on their goggs was deep into cornfields now. The dog of the day was a stunningly beautiful Irish setter, silky to the touch.\nProgrammed illusion warred briefly with a hint of dream memory. Something about thick wool socks\u2014their only socks\u2014grinding against their toes, steeped in something sticky . . .\nPet the dog, pet the dog, pet the dog . . .\nBreeze cleared the sim from their goggs. Zero was sitting up in bed, tits mercifully draped under a blanket, watching Keisha walk Alice back and forth. No sound for Breeze, but they could see baby screaming the walls red.\nZero\u2019s mouth moved. Breeze stayed still, faking sleep. Badly, apparently, because their fairy godmentor finger-spelled. \u201cYou need better headshots.\u201d\nA kick of insult. Breeze rebooted their rig.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing on-camera gigs to make contacts,\u201d they said. \u201cI want to get on a crew and work my way up to directing.\u201d\nBoth hearing aids engaged midway through this declaration, filling the already close room with baby wails and the sound of their own voice.\n\u201cGood, you\u2019re up!\u201d Keisha handed Alice over.\n\u201cAwww. How\u2019s our little hot potato?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say our.\u201d Keisha vanished into the bathroom.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d One-armed, Breeze shook themselves out of bed, digging in the pantry box for fish broth cubes and dried dumplings. Unlocking the boil tap, they topped up three metal cups. The baby arched and wailed.\n\u201cSo the reason you were gawping at the pretty sunrise yesterday,\u201d Zero said, as if there\u2019d been no interruption. \u201cIs you want to craft sims proper.\u201d\n\u201cPractice, yeah. Until I can take a capture course.\u201d\n\u201cYou and every other glamor hound in the city, I\u2019ll wager,\u201d Zero hopped off their bunk and dropped into a push-up. \u201cYou\u2019re not in the scholarship queue.\u201d\n\u201cGotta get Alice adopted first,\u201d Breeze said, keeping their voice light. \u201cI\u2019m learning what I can on the job.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019re a big shot director, you\u2019re going to . . . what?\u201d\n\u201cShow the world rising from the ashes,\u201d Breeze said promptly.\n\u201cOn a front of man-made ice?\u201d\n\u201cPeople need to see what we\u2019re building here. How hard everyone\u2019s trying!\u201d\n\u201cThat is a genuinely heartwarming take.\u201d\n\u201cSarcasm\u2019s antisocial, Zero.\u201d Dumplings began plumping up in the three cups. Keisha had exhaustion as an excuse. If Breeze had to live with two neggers . . . their vision blurred. Alice slapped at their goggs, almost dislodging a hearing aid.\n\u201cRelax, Blossom. My point is you don\u2019t have to wait out the slow queue of wannabes. You must know you\u2019re bloody gorgeous. Those wide-eyed peepers, the cheekbones . . . add to that to your apparent faith in humanity and the rare sense\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTrade on my looks? Don\u2019t you feel like that\u2019s kind of\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014rare sense of fair play,\u201d Zero overrode them. \u201cGet that idealism out where people can see it! I promise you, they will eat it up. Sweet-tempered giants are trending.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like cheating.\u201d\n\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re not serious about your ambitions,\u201d Zero said.\nBreeze was starting to wish they\u2019d never given Zero that stroke. \u201cOf course I\u2019m serious! We picked Kevinsberg because of the sim studio.\u201d\n\u201cYet you\u2019re pumping bilge water, eight to six.\u201d\nBy now Alice\u2019s wails had reached rock-shattering volume: the Club\u2019s social worker app was probably tallying complaints against them, and downvoting her adoptability stats. Again. Breeze bounced her. \u201cWhat do you suggest, oh exalted godmentor?\u201d\n\u201cFix your headshots,\u201d Zero said implacably. \u201cGet better clothes.\u201d\n\u201cLike any of that is affordable,\u201d Keisha came out of the bathroom, sighing over the dumplings before taking a cup.\nBreeze thought of the crowds at the sunrise yesterday. \u201cZero may have a point.\u201d\nKeisha slammed the cup onto their stub of a counter, startling Alice to silence, for a breath, anyway. Broth sloshed her fingers. She started the cold tap, thrusting the burned skin into the flow.\n\u201cOne day\u2019s wages, Blossoms.\u201d Zero finished up her round of push-ups, tested her weight on a ceiling pipe, and transitioned into chin-ups. \u201cTwo at most. I\u2019ll haggle a photographer for the shots\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd branding,\u201d Keisha interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not rocking cradles all day so Breeze can start trending on the deepfake porn sites.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s she supposed to pull off a brand?\u201d Breeze objected, although the thought of being the VR fucktoy of the month made their stomach go queasy. They burped\u2014fish\u2014and thought of the neighborhood zoomers.\n\u201cI can haggle a brand,\u201d Zero agreed, not breaking rhythm. Up, down, up like a machine.\nBreeze gave Keisha the wide-eyes. She seemed to deflate. \u201cFine.\u201d\nIn the end it was three days without childcare. Three shifts Breeze spent on a midsize icemaker, tethered to the deck as waves whiplashed the crew, freezing in a moldy-smelling extra-large life jacket as part of a crew spraying fine mist on the artificial icebergs anchored at the edge of the Current. Three days of hazard-grade wages, all vanished into Zero\u2019s growing shopping list. Hairstyle and makeup first, then a set of fashionable VR goggs that didn\u2019t quite sync with their hearing aids.\nThe final buy was a temp brand, complicated aurora spray above their left eyebrow, inked in emerald using something called Slowfade.\n\u201cIt gives you a whiff of the exotic,\u201d Zero said, as Breeze looked it over.\n\u201cIt gives me a recurring monthly expense,\u201d Breeze countered.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it tattooed when we can.\u201d\nThree days of Keisha deteriorating into zombie, in the twenty-four-seven yellscape.\nBreeze did what they could. Came home after the photo shoot and cajoled her out of the apartment. Spent their last on a stroller booking, collecting the wagon under the ever-present leer of the zoomers, then adjusting its settings to extra jouncy. That, and a white noise app, was one of the few things sure to lull Alice into quiescence.\n\u201cSo, the park?\u201d Keisha said, as the baby quieted and a two-hour countdown popped up in their peripherals.\n\u201cLet\u2019s take her outside,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cChange of pace, right?\u201d\nKeisha signed agreement. Bundling up with things from the Club\u2019s communal cloakroom, they sealed the stroller, cycled through a heat lock, and stepped out onto the island\u2019s cliffside walk.\nRough winter fingers poked the gaps in their ill-fitted coats and mittens. Hunching as they walked, looking east at slate-gray seas and waves like rolling pumice, the two teens let the crash of water against the shore render them insensate for a while. The day shift was over, and the Club had got up a tobogganing opp for the under-fourteens, building an artificial mound of snow and staffing a hot cider fountain at its base. Further on, ice sculptors were taking advantage of the day\u2019s remaining light. Wannabe simmakers were out collecting action shots. They looked to Breeze, suddenly, like hungry gulls snatching at a scantness of crumbs.\nEveryone froze as rotors sounded, audible even over the sputter of the ice cannons at the cliff. People paused, craning necks, tracking a trio of black helicopters making for Head Office, the tallest tower, at the heart of the island settlement.\n\u201cGuess Kev Magee\u2019s back in residence,\u201d Breeze rasped. They were tired enough that reporting the obvious was as close to conversation as they could manage. \u201cDidn\u2019t know he was gone.\u201d\n\u201cTo Paris, for the funeral.\u201d Keisha said. \u201cThat EXOshell CEO who got beheaded.\u201d\nBreeze flinched.\nA passing tobogganer, kid of about thirteen with a prosthetic for a left arm and a cheap print job for teeth, chimed in: \u201cThey still haven\u2019t found the head!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Breeze said.\n\u201c#Eattherich!\u201d the kid screeched, giving the choppers the finger. Up on the tower roof, black-clad figures were taking up positions around the building perimeter.\n\u201cI\u2019ll eat you, you wake our baby,\u201d Keisha said.\nThe kid made lip-smacking noises. Breeze took a step closer, reluctantly using their bigness as threat. The kid bounded away like an ape.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about newscycle, Breeze.\u201d Keisha said. \u201cIt\u2019s just noise.\u201d\nBreeze watched the kids. A couple of the ten-and-unders were helping load five year olds into sleds. The barely teens were helping smalls pull their toboggans up the hill. They might all have been decades younger, instead of just a couple years. \u201cHow many you think there are, like that?\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201c#Eattherich kid. Think Magee has a list? People he\u2019s brought to town who\u2019d just as soon shank him as thank him\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThank what? His abundant generosity?\u201d Keisha kicked a pebble at the pram. \u201cMagee\u2019s not doing this out of the goodness of his heart.\u201d\n\u201cHe could just restrict himself to making ice. He doesn\u2019t have to fund sims and sculptures and ski hills. That concert hall\u2019s opening soon\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to live here too, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cPeople can help themselves and do good,\u201d Breeze insisted.\nHer eye fell on Alice. Remembering their own devil\u2019s bargain?\nOne of the sculptors was putting the claws on a dancing bear, sending ice dust into the breeze as they chainsawed form into frost.\n\u201cAlmighty Magee\u2019s got nothing to fear.\u201d Keisha indicated the toboggan pack. \u201cNot from the likes of them.\u201d\n\u201cNo? What about your EXOshell guy?\u201d\nShe zoomed to a close view of the helipad, with its black-clad muscly contingent. \u201cAnyone getting through that kind of security? Has got to be another one of them.\u201d\n\u201cRight. Billionaires preying on each other.\u201d\nShe blew a plume of foggy air out at the disturbingly colorless ocean, losing interest. \u201cYou\u2019ll get Alice back into care tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t. You work more doubles, we can start buying Alice up the adoption queue. It\u2019s all win.\u201d\nThe guilt lessened, but didn\u2019t go entirely. But then Keisha leaned in, blocking out a flag of wind with the warmth of her body, and one of the tobogganers did a flip that made them both gasp. They watched the sculptors spray crystalline grit into the breeze until they couldn\u2019t feel their feet for the cold, until the stroller pinged a warning\u2014fifteen minutes until its next rental, its next hot date with another throwaway baby.\n\u201cGet up, Blossom, there\u2019s a rumor of a morning shoot.\u201d Zero made this impossible to ignore by tugging on their boots, as if she meant to remove them.\nBreeze yanked both legs away, blinking away views from Hayride\u2014poppy fields and a springer spaniel. \u201cGo away. Don\u2019t touch me! I can\u2019t today.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s speaking parts. An actual director. You want to make contacts, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nThey did, but . . . \u201cKeisha needs a break.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your kid.\u201d\n\u201cAlice,\u201d Breeze signed. \u201cIs our responsibility.\u201d\nFlat look, like Zero was sifting them. Then: \u201cI\u2019ll gig for the childcare.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d The promise felt sticky.\nZero made an almost ostentatious show of taking a bag-searching shift at the boat docks, then tasking their stub to the household account. \u201cHappy now? Run some varnish over your eyebrow brand and wear this.\u201d\n\u201cThis\u201d was a navy blue coat, well worn, but a far cut above their drab weather-stained work sheath.\n\u201cFancy!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll raise your standards yet.\u201d\nBreeze bit their lip. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get in as my manager, right? That\u2019s what this is?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not after sex, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d A blush that went through their whole body.\n\u201cCome on, it totally was. You think shaking down people at Customs is all I want out of life? You and me, Blossom, we\u2019re going all the way to what passes for the top of this desperate scrape of an ice-encrusted fucking anthill.\u201d\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d Breeze managed. \u201cThe baby.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you, Breeze. Don\u2019t you want help?\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nZero clamped her hands over her cheeks, making the scars look fake, almost plasticky, and shoved her nose right up to the edge of Breeze\u2019s new, improved goggles. Well past their consent barrier, but somehow they didn\u2019t feel like they could say so. \u201cYou got your ears turned on? You capturing footage?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d\n\u201cI want to review your audition later. Unless you prefer to debrief me verbally?\u201d\n\u201cNoping that!\u201d\n\u201cCams on then. They\u2019ve got those nice new lenses; you should be practicing your captures. Do your hair like I showed you.\u201d\nSpeaking part. Breeze powered up, fluffed hair, checked their emerald-branded aurora, and plunged out into the city.\nThey hadn\u2019t realized how early it was. Wee hours, really. With the timing offset from the usual commuter flows, the passages were deserted. Excess hot air from submarine ice condensers gusted warmly, creating an artificial wind laced with antibacterial measures and a smell of stale potato. Nobody was around.\nBreeze found themself tagging security cameras as they passed.\nI\u2019m on that one, I\u2019m on that one. Nothing to fear! I\u2019m probably the most interesting thing on the security feeds. There could even be live eyes on me . . .\nSilly litany, maybe, but it kept them from running home.\n\u201cZero, where\u2019s this gig?\u201d They texted, turning a slow three-sixty to pan Ashevak Park. Ground-level lights beckoned, colors programmed to simulate sunrise in March. The dome above was black and star-sprung. Silhouettes of geese and kayaks blacked out the constellations.\nBreeze bent to check their boot laces. And then, straightening up, jumped as a shadow melted out of the central pillar.\nSomeone was trying to climb Qilalugag, the narwhal pod.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t that be . . . not allowed?\u201d Breeze muttered. \u201cMoil?\u201d\nThey zoomed, bringing in facial features. It was one of the two pervy machinists. The zoomer was dressed for deep winter, bundled in a thick coat that made him look lumpy, and sporting an extravagantly rolled-up toque with a smeary looking pompom. As Breeze watched, he lost his grip on a narwhal fluke. Teetering, he lost ground, not quite falling to the base of the statue. Rebalancing before he landed flat on his butt, he tottered, kicked the pillar\u2019s base, and then hunched in on himself.\nWas he . . . crying?\nThe hearing aids glitched back into sync with the gogg view, bringing muttered monologue: \u201cOh no, oh no, no no, oh no nuh no . . . \u201d\nBreeze flashed on Zero, saying Alice wasn\u2019t their problem. Tried to vanish behind a carved sea lion. Speaking part, come on Breeze, just find the casting tent . . .\n\u201cHey,\u201d they said instead. \u201cHi? Bonjour? Hola?\u201d\n\u201cNuh Nuh oh no oh no no no . . . \u201d\nBreeze felt acid burning in the back of their throat. \u201cMoil!\u201d\n\u201cGood morning Breeze! You\u2019re up early!\u201d\n\u201cCan you Whooz this guy for a name?\u201d Breeze put up both hands, waving to get the zoomer\u2019s attention. \u201cHey . . . neighbor! Hi, it\u2019s me. Breeze? I live in Magenta\u2014\u201d\nOMG, why am I telling him that?\nCome on, he must know.\n\u201cMy friend and I are the ones with the baby. Remember?\u201d\nMoil spoke up. \u201cThat individual is named Douglas Farrow. Pronouns he/him.\u201d\n\u201cDouglas, right? Or Doug, maybe? Hey, Doug! What are you doing out here?\u201d\n\u201cNuh nuh nuh no, no oh\u2014\u201d Dirty hands with ripped, bloodied nails fisted into the oily weave of the toque. His nose was squashy and red, like he\u2019d banged it.\nBreeze murmured: \u201cMoil, you\u2019ve called someone, right? A social worker. An ambulance?\u201d\n\u201cDouglas does not appear to be in grave physical distress\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s melting down!\u201d\n\u201cI can place him in the voluntary psychiatric services queue. If he refuses and you authorize a medical call that is later tagged as #falsealarm, you may be expected to compensate City Services\u2014\u201d\nThey\u2019d never be able to start moving Alice up the adoption boards if they had an outstanding ticket to pay. Breeze took another reluctant step toward Doug, who was yanking the toque and making nuhnuh noises. \u201cListen. Can I help? Um, friend\u2014\u201d\nDoug\u2019s head whipped up. \u201cFriend? Friend?\u201d\nDragging the hat down over his face, he charged.\nIf a toque had eyeholes, did that make it a balaclava? It was the last thing Breeze remembered thinking before a wash of white light and the sound of static carried them away.\nBreeze came out of the static on their back, lying in beyond-fancy accommodations. Sage-green sheets, whiff of honeysuckle. A flawless nanoglass window overlooked the very first Kevinsberg ice shop, ten stories below.\nThey flexed their toes. Their boots were still on; Keisha must have told them.\nTiny damp fingers brushed their nose. Alice was tucked under Breeze\u2019s arm. She had managed to extract one arm from the cocoon of a clean and shockingly soft yellow swaddle. She drew her fingers back from Breeze\u2019s nose, shoving them into her gob.\nThey ran a cheek over her head, self-soothing by drinking in baby smell, and for good measure focused on the view, rhythmic descent and splash of buoy-shaped cones of ice, big as houses, sliding off the assembly line. Hitting sea, the baby bergs tangled into nets of faux spidersilk that caught, spooled, and strung them in long lines hitched to towboats bound for the Current. The ships would draw them into temporary anchorage, hunting big winter storms that might be expected to dump ice rain and snow onto surfaces already configured to maximize droplet catch.\nBreeze realized their hands were bagged in cotton. Burned?\nThey peeked sideways. Keisha was nearby in a rocking chair, watching the ice cones too\u2014the hypnotic rhythm of them rolling off the line into the bay.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Zero?\u201d Breeze texted, so the baby wouldn\u2019t hear.\n\u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d Keisha lit up.\nBreeze felt tears threatening. Instead of asking how long they\u2019d blipped out for, they signed: \u201cZero?\u201d\nShe frowned. \u201cInola\u2014the nurse\u2014spooked her, I think.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know anything could.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get a face like that without getting a few triggers too, right?\u201d\n\u201cGuess not.\u201d The idea of Zero having trauma rang . . . false somehow.\n\u201cShe said she\u2019d go scare up some interview gigs.\u201d Breeze must have looked puzzled, because Keisha added: \u201cYou\u2019re a sensation. Like, locally famous.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cHashtag hero,\u201d she shared a capture.\nBreeze fumbled down their goggs. The footage came in, record of a memory that felt all of five minutes old. Lumpy upset Doug, refusing to be talked down. Moil saying an ambulance would cost.\nOn the views as the zoomer rushed closer, yelling, an ice chisel dropped out of his sleeve. Short chopping blade. Probably not all that dangerous?\nBreeze put a protective hand on the baby. The angle of the shot made it obvious they\u2019d scrambled backward. They heard their own voice, kind of crooning: \u201cDoug, Doug, you\u2019re okay, you\u2019re okay! Calm down\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not friends!\u201d\nSuddenly a pair of beanbag cannons deployed, emerging from gaps in the nearest walrus statue. Fire one, fire two, fire three\u2014\nThe footage paused as the bags hit the zoomer. The image pixelated.\nMoil said: \u201cThis content is rated high-risk by your Can\u2019t Unsee application. To view\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDecline.\u201d Breeze put their nose on the baby\u2019s head, nuzzling her silky, white-blonde hair. A ping from their biofeedback augments showed their pulse verging to ninety beats. \u201cSo I\u2019m a #hero for . . . what?\u201d\n\u201cFor trying, I guess.\u201d Keisha said. \u201cThose lumps in Doug\u2019s coat? When the beanbags hit, they exploded.\u201d\nBreeze focused on the now. \u201cAnd he\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWent splat, yeah,\u201d Keisha climbed into the treatment bed, on the no-baby side. Leaned in, a comforting weight. \u201cBob\u2014the other one\u2014is missing.\u201d\nPet the baby, pet the baby. Breeze remembered the three of them, cuddled up like this back in Detroit. Only six months ago? Seemed like longer.\nThat day of waiting, endlessly waiting, on Alice\u2019s mom. They\u2019d sat it out in rising hunger, because of the heat and the rat-a-tat of drone platforms nearby, too near. They\u2019d reported Cynthia missing and waited some more, this time on police and child welfare agents who never came.\nOn the third day, they\u2019d widecast a WTF do we do? They didn\u2019t get many commenters, though, just a couple chatbots who said it was illegal to abandon an infant.\nBut there wouldn\u2019t have been any consequences. City systems were overwhelmed. Any adult who might arrest or help them was busy taking care of themselves.\nLeaving one option: the Orphan\u2019s Club. Upgrade their membership from casual. Formally join the chain of elders helping youngers, gigging childcare until someone found new mommies for the baby.\nNo choice at all, really.\nBreeze had headed out to find formula, leaving Keisha to fill out the forms. They were loading up milk and diapers when they saw a bright new thousand-pack of bullet drones, deploying from the roof of One Detroit Center, making straight for the safe zone.\nNext thing Breeze knew they were back in the basement, bloody-footed, shaking Keisha, or being shaken by her. Arguing about something. Breeze remembered shouting, over the rat-a-tat: \u201cBut she can get us out! Babies top the queue for evacuation!\u201d\nSo Alice had become their ticket to Kevinsberg. To a pretty great house, and most of all not getting shot at. Pretty good deal, even if neither of them could have known she\u2019d score so low within the queue of adoptable infants.\nShe hadn\u2019t refused to be cute before her mother went AWOL.\nKeisha tapped their goggles with a finger. \u201cStill with me?\u201d\n\u201cWho is this child in my arms and what have they done with our portable scream machine?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say our.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNurse thinks maybe there\u2019s some kind of lack . . . lacto thing she\u2019s got? Tummy ache from printed milk.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cYou asked about that.\u201d\n\u201cOver and over!\u201d They were allowed to log into the pediatric care queue every time Alice cried for six hours straight.\n\u201cWe could\u2019ve been . . . are you saying she could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou better not be blaming me.\u201d Keisha pulled away, jolting Alice. Instead of shrieking, baby blew a for-real spit bubble.\n\u201cJeez. If all we\u2019d needed was fancy milk . . . \u201d Breeze reached up to rub the spot above their branded eyebrow. Gauze-wrapped fingers dragged on yet more bandage.\nThey got a ping from Zero.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cCall from the fairy godmentor,\u201d Breeze shared the specs. \u201cZero\u2019s put together an interview opp, just like you said.\u201d\n\u201cGreat!\u201d\n\u201cYeah . . . \u201d Breeze rubbed their bandaged palms together.\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nRidiculous, to be whispering. Still. \u201cKeish. I don\u2019t know if Zero\u2019s got our best interests at heart.\u201d\n\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to do that.\u201d Keisha practically snapped to attention. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide now, for the first time in your life, that you don\u2019t trust someone.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I know, but\u2014somehow I end up\u2014Zero decides things, and\u2014\u201d\nA strangled laugh. \u201cLike you deciding we should form a refugee threesome and fly off to the North Fucking Pole?\u201d\nBreeze blinked. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\u201cYou said there\u2019d be people here who\u2019d want Alice, Breeze. Who\u2019d love her, or at least know what the fuck they were doing\u2014\u201d\nA chime. Strike for them both\u2014social worker app, flagging the profanity.\nShe rolled off the bed, pacing. \u201cWe got clear of the shooting. You were right about that, it was good. It is good. I don\u2019t mean to be a . . . but Breeze, we can\u2019t hand Alice off to a playgroup until she\u2019s four!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d never put her in one of those feral\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d Keisha spun, pressing both fists against the nanoglass, then smacking her head against it once, twice. \u201cWould you stop assuming I\u2019m as good of a person as you!\u201d\nWithin the circle of their arm, the baby shivered.\n\u201cStop! I\u2019m sorry, okay?\u201d Breeze felt white edges forming on the periphery of their vision. \u201cI\u2019m taking the gig! Interview, accept. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\nKeisha deflated, curling up against the window. Sweat smudges from her forehead and hands were already cleaning themselves off the nanoglass. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nSocial worker gave them another strike for profanity.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cShe needs . . . good parents. Permanence. We\u2019ll home her, we will.\u201d\nEyes dull, she nodded.\n\u201cWe will!\u201d Breeze cast about for something else they could say. \u201cWe\u2019ll lose the place on Magenta, when Alice goes. If we want to stay together . . . \u201d\nThey left room for an of course we\u2019ll stay together . . .\nInstead, Keisha said \u201cJust keep godmentor happy until we\u2019ve homed the baby. Will you? Please?\u201d\n\u201cI accepted the interview, all right?\u201d Breeze said. \u201cIt\u2019s a done deal.\u201d\nAlice blew another bubble. She let out a toothless half smile and then, fists clamping, filled her diaper, extravagantly, with a sound like a French horn tuning.\n\u201cYeah, done deal,\u201d Keisha echoed. She picked herself up, scooped the baby, and made for the door. \u201cNo one\u2019s gonna be able to resist her.\u201d\nBreeze picked at their hand bandages. Cool air caressed the space on their chest where Alice had been.\nIf we want to stay together . . .\nKeisha didn\u2019t owe them anything.\nDoesn\u2019t she? I could\u2019ve left her holding that baby. Goddamnit, I just went over there to study and flirt a little\u2014\nA woman knocked on the door just then, softly, waiting on an invite to enter.\nBreeze motioned consent. Tried wiping their face with the backs of their gauzy hands and smeared their goggs.\nThe woman asked. \u201cFeel like getting those bandages off?\u201d\nBreeze nodded. Looking sharp, a little like a mom, she plopped her seat down on the edge of the bed, waiting. Like she had forever.\nThey said. \u201cYou know those days where everything\u2019s terrible?\u201d\n\u201cI hate those days,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Inola, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cShe/her?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nTears slipped down their face.\u201cBreeze, they/them. Did you put our baby on the allergy list?\u201d\n\u201cAnd gave a strike to the intake nurse who told you Alice didn\u2019t have a sensitivity.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cOrphan\u2019s Club will strike \u2019em too. I\u2019m not usually punitive, but . . . \u201d She looked over their readings\u2014pulse, blood pressure, whatever. \u201cSo. From the footage, it looks like you tuned out when you were attacked.\u201d\nThe query probably meant Inola was a psychiatric nurse. Breeze bonked the bandages on their hands together, trying to choose their words. \u201cFlight, fight, freeze, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou freeze up often?\u201d\n\u201cNot since Detroit.\u201d\nFlicker of a memory. Arriving back at the Detroit basement with formula, to find Keisha packing up some of the family valuables, and none of the baby stuff.\n\u201cBreeze?\u201d Inola said.\nThey signed, both bandaged hands moving clumsily, to indicate general unwillingness to talk about it. \u201cI need to be able to work dock shifts.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to ban you,\u201d Inola said. \u201cYou\u2019re not being punished. It was a good thing, son, trying to talk that man down.\u201d\nBreeze shrugged. \u201cHe still died.\u201d\n\u201cNot alone.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that matter?\u201d\n\u201cIt would to me.\u201d Another sharp look. \u201cPeople abandon each other all the time, don\u2019t they?\u201d\nDefinitely a psych nurse. Breeze stared at the production line of icebergs\u2014grind down the slide, splash in the water, tangle into towline\u2014as Inola unwrapped the bandages on their hands. The palms were a little raw, but there was no real damage.\n\u201cIs my face okay?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d She shared her own view, sending footage from her goggles as she pulled off the tape bandage. The emerald aurora in the swirl above Breeze\u2019s brow had crisped to a purple-tinted burn, edged with white. It looked surprisingly good.\n\u201cBattle scar,\u201d she said, handing them a wipe for their goggs. \u201cAlmost like someone planned it that way.\u201d\nBreeze swallowed. I think our fairy godmentor made Doug do the firebomb, they wanted to say.\n\u201cGood morning, Breeze!\u201d Moil pinged them. A new offer popped up in their sked.\nIt was VIP invites to the Kevinsberg Concert Hall grand opening the next evening. For Keisha and Alice too, plus a childcare worker. During intermission, there\u2019d be a photo opp with Kevin Magee and two sim directors.\n\u201cAccept or Decline?\u201d\nA pop-up sweetened the opp: Alice would be the evening\u2019s Featured Adoptable.\n\u201cBreeze?\u201d Inola moved right into their line of sight, using hospital overrides to minimize the offer, so she could compel eye contact. \u201cSomething you want to tell me?\u201d\nBreeze blew out what little breath remained in their lungs. \u201cEverything\u2019s great,\u201d they mouthed, airlessly, and added\u2014to Moil\u2014\u201cAccept.\u201d\nZero turned up in the flesh early the next morning, while Breeze was waiting on discharge from the hospital. She inspected the burned-in brand on Breeze\u2019s eyebrow, looking satisfied as she settled them onto a stool in a white-walled corner of the room and set up a remote interview with a journo.\n\u201cThis won\u2019t take long. We\u2019ve prefabbed most of the content,\u201d the journo said. \u201cZero will capture your answers. Just look at her and, you know, speak from the heart.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\nZero shared text. \u201cThese are the questions.\u201d\nBreeze took a quick scan. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here about the baby.\u201d\n\u201cAlready backgrounded. We talked to Keisha about your determination to rescue Alice\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Blossom, everyone\u2019s on message. You\u2019re a big-time hashtag hero with dreams of stardom. Baby saving in your past, testimonial from Keisha as appetizer, and poor doomed Doug as . . . \u201d\n\u201cMain course?\u201d That was Inola.\nZero turned abruptly, pointing her face at the view as the nurse scanned the room, and then said\u2014a little coolly\u2014\u201cBreeze, we\u2019ve got one more general assessment to upload. You\u2019ll get a greenlight for discharge within the hour.\u201d\nBreeze sent thanks, wondering again what the nurse had done to spook Zero.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about the concert opp,\u201d Zero said, as soon as the latch clicked behind her. \u201cWe watch the first half, then head toward stairwell two and the board box. Kev Magee and company will be waiting. He\u2019ll invite you over, all spontaneous like, and shake your hand. You introduce Keisha, he gives little Alice a peck on the cheek. Says the usual about how adorable she is. Our newsy friend captures the whole encounter and then you\u2019re free and clear, for ten minutes, ish, to kiss up to the sim directors while Keisha shops Alice to potential parents. Got it?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Breeze said.\nZero pointed at a tatter of flesh below her eye. \u201cGaze here. One, two . . . good! See the text of the questions, Blossom? Anything you want to know before you start answering?\u201d\nJust keep her happy, Keisha had said. Breeze shook their head.\n\u201cFluff your hair, then, and start talking.\u201d\nThe brand new Kevinsberg Concert Hall had been covered in a cylindrical veil of nanosilk, four stories high, for as long as Breeze had been on the island.\nThe structure beneath had been the subject of much speculation. Everyone expected some variation on an igloo, but nopers had countered that if the hall was too spherical it would end up looking like something called a Death Star, thereby drawing branding ire from litigious rightsholders.\nBreeze could never have guessed they\u2019d see the unveiling live, much less from a front row, elbow-rubbing vantage point with richies. The three of them were behind a velvet rope\u2014crappy, ineffective fence, but Keisha said it was symbolic. They were the youngest people in the whole velvet-corralled throng.\nPop of fireworks. The silk curtains concealing the building shredded into multicolored streamers. From a thousand throats, all at once: \u201cOooh!\u201d\nThe architects had levered the dome and entryway of the fantasy igloo up, as if it was on a hinge, and then used etched nanoglass to fill the space between the cup of the dome and the ground. The dome itself was surfaced in local stone, pale shakes overlaid in layers, each piece cut like a snowflake.\nBreeze clapped along with all the others. The crowd sound was tinny\u2014their fashion-plate goggs were still syncing badly with the hearing aids.\nZero pulled Alice\u2019s diaper bag off their shoulder.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\u201cBag ruins your look, Blossom.\u201d\nZero had haggled finery for all three of them. Keisha was clad head to toe in a silvery tulip dress, an off the shoulder garment with a skirt so tight she was mincing. The baby had a dress and bow that made her look cute, in a sort of malevolent strawberry way. Breeze was fitted with hunter green trousers and a coffee-colored jacket.\nWith the tipped igloo unveiled and the applause finally wrapping, the crowd moved inside. All too close and jostly, and as they passed over the threshold, someone handed Breeze a piece of paper.\nThey almost backpedaled. \u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Zero said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, kids. Program for the show, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would we need paper\u2014\u201d Breeze\u2019s gogg offlined, and their sound system shut down. Everything went smeary and silent; then the whole rig rebooted.\n\u201cWhat happened, Moil?\u201d they texted. All around them, people were pushing their goggs up . . . into hair that looked, they realized, like they had styled it expecting a data blackout.\n\u201cUnder the Ogua-Lik intellectual property user agreement, concertgoers are forbidden to run upload tech at live concerts. However, you have an accessibility waiver, on condition that you don\u2019t transmit anything you hear or record. Personal use only.\u201d\n\u201cAccept terms,\u201d Breeze said. Feeling perverse and apprehensive, they reactivated their capture app.\nThis will be what Zero wants, they thought\u2014me getting another one of a kind recording.\nThe concert hall interior carried on the igloo metaphor with transparent bricks, all angled differently, faceting the lobby with varying shades of white, yellow, and gold. Like walking inside an intricately faceted diamond, Breeze thought. They could have stayed forever, watching the shifts and cascades of light, but the crowd was moving, an inexorable wash of bodies, into the amphitheater itself\u2014a darker space, blue lit, like the depths of a glacial cave.\nMore oohs. The stage looked as though it was surfaced in black seawater. Two carved pillars of ice, swirling arrays of orcas rising to the roof, had been erected to form its proscenium. Mist feathered around their bases.\nZero started to lay a hand on Breeze\u2019s shoulder as they all trooped to the balcony stairway. They turned, clearing the grip as they stopped abruptly. \u201cZero. About Doug\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhatever that pathetic old zoomer may have done to himself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d Breeze kicked at her ankle, just a little.\nHer expression blanked, just for a breath. Then: \u201cI didn\u2019t know he\u2019d fireball, Breeze. I thought you\u2019d go out there, charm him out of vandalizing the pillar, and get a few strokes for keeping him from self-harming.\u201d\nA rush of relief. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think I am?\u201d\nA shiver ran through them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, virtue prevailed, didn\u2019t it? You got your face on the local leaderboards. Baby\u2019s on the market. All your dreams are about to come true, Blossom.\u201d\nBreeze fought the urge to just let it go. \u201cOkay, but. Where\u2019s his buddy?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cThe other zoomer.\u201d\n\u201cHow would I know?\u201d\n\u201cZero . . . \u201d\n\u201cHe ran for it, one imagines. Partnership of convenience, easily dissolved in a crisis.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of partnership.\u201d Breeze forced the words out. \u201cI don\u2019t like surprises. You and I can\u2019t team up if you\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d\nAn odd smile crossed Zero\u2019s face, distorting the scar tissue, giving it that fake-looking sheen. She dropped a hand on Breeze\u2019s arm. \u201cI notice you\u2019re telling me now, when it\u2019s too late to cancel this opp.\u201d\nKeisha turned back, an inquiring look on her face.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a saint, whatever you think.\u201d Breeze shook their head. \u201cWe meet Magee, we boost Alice up the adoptee queue. But then you . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat? Go away?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The necessity of it, the need to get clear, was so strong it weakened their knees. \u201cI\u2019ll pay if I have to.\u201d\nTo their surprise, Zero nodded. \u201cI give you my word, Breeze. After tonight, I\u2019ll never do a single thing on your behalf again.\u201d\nAbruptly, she turned, hoofing it up the stairs, gliding past Keisha. Breeze frowned, puzzled. Then they saw the nurse, Inola, toiling up the steps in a vintage-looking ball gown.\n\u201cI said I\u2019d do your babyminding gig,\u201d she said.\nFeeling absurdly touched, Breeze gave her social capital a stroke.\n\u201cAnd if you find you want to tell me what\u2019s bothering\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d Keisha had backtracked to collect them.\n\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cThis is going to be good for us. For Alice.\u201d\nIf Inola had misgivings, they didn\u2019t show. \u201cCome on, then. A concert like this is once in a lifetime for you. Don\u2019t miss out.\u201d She gestured gently\u2014go, go!\u2014and they all started shuffling, once more, up the stairs.\nBreeze hadn\u2019t been sure what a \u201cbox\u201d was, but it turned out to be a curtained private room, up high, with seats overlooking the stage. It offered unobstructed naked-eye views of the musicians, who were all clad in deep glacier blue. A single violinist wore a sheath dress in flame red\u2014she, apparently, was a soloist.\nThey looked old, thirty at least, and some even older than that, and in the one-page paper program for the show most of them had listed missing loved ones in US cities within the space provided for their bios.\nBreeze dutifully scanned for names from Detroit. They hadn\u2019t known any musicians, they didn\u2019t think. But you never knew.\nThe event was billed a celebration and the music was matched to that brand: thrilling whirls of sound that came in tinny and discordant at first, forcing Breeze into a deep dig on their hearing aids\u2019 settings. It took some fiddling to get the metallic edge tuned out of the soundflow. Clang clang squeak, and finally their rig reset. In flowed a vast richness of chords and changes\u2014strange, hot, lavishing waterfall of music.\nThey didn\u2019t quite know how they were supposed to react to the onslaught. There were olds in the audience, down below, who were dabbing at their eyes. Everyone seemed rapt. Keisha seemed fidgety. Inola was far away.\nAcross the auditorium was Kev Magee.\nBreeze zoomed surreptitiously. The billionaire looked just his newscycle images: ectomorphic twist of white in a whiter suit. His brand was tattooed on the backs of his hands, blue-lined circuit board diagrams, connected to navy blue permanails.\nAside from the dark-clad muscly types encircling the back of his box, Magee was the only one of his party not leaning forward hungrily as the orchestra brought the music to a bubbling crescendo, following the violinist into bright exaltations reminiscent of birdsong. Magee was chilled, all but swallowed by his seat. Aware, Breeze supposed, that the floorboards, the lights above, and all the musicians toiling below were essentially there for him.\nThe journo, sitting one row behind him, was muffling sobs into a handkerchief.\nZero slid into place beside Breeze just as the song ended, as everyone else, apparently having gotten some secret etiquette briefing, burst into applause. She had acquired a veil from somewhere, a drape of black fabric that hid the scar tissue below her goggs.\n\u201cRemember what I said?\u201d Zero signed. \u201cTurn left, meet up, do the glad-hand. Aw shucks it weren\u2019t nothing, Mer Magee. Anyone woulda tried to save that old pervert.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that about him,\u201d Breeze said, undertone.\n\u201cUp,\u201d she said, nudging them to their feet and holding out a hand to Keisha, almost gallant. Keisha shifted her shoulders in the unfamiliar gown, getting her feet under her, adjusting the weight of the baby.\nBreeze looked at Keisha. Read my mind, read my mind!\nMiracle of miracles\u2014she did. \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you guys.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Zero said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d\nKeep the godmentor happy. Breeze\u2019s sense of something about to go horribly amiss went from embarrassing throttle-it paranoia to ice-hard certainty. The journo with Magee was setting their goggs into place; they probably had special dispensation to capture the \u201cspontaneous\u201d encounter between the island CEO and the community\u2019s new-minted hero.\nZero set Keisha\u2019s hand into Breeze\u2019s. \u201cRemember, Blossoms, you\u2019re doing it all for the baby.\u201d\nThey got moving, stepping out of the box, once again getting carried along . . .\nUntil Inola, blessedly, stepped into their path. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Breeze? Keisha? Need anything?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Breeze said, stopping dead. \u201cCan you take Alice and give her a primp and\u2014\u201d\nZero\u2019s hand tightened on their shoulder with almost crushing force. Breeze felt the edges of their vision whitening. They struggled to hang on. Whatever staged footage Zero was hoping to capture now, the baby didn\u2019t have to be in the shot. And maybe Inola was more than just a psych nurse . . .\nMaybe she\u2019s a cop, maybe she\u2019s a soldier, maybe . . .\nKeisha thrust the baby out. \u201cYeah! Please! Head down to the adoption table with her? We\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\nBreeze felt something lighten, somewhere in their gut.\n\u201cOn it, kids.\u201d Inola slung the diaper bag over her shoulder, plucking up Alice and heading down.\nKeisha gave Breeze a wild, wide-eyed smile. On the same page, the two of them stepped up to the staircase.\nZero\u2019s claw tightened, guiding them left. As they pivoted, zoomed-in views showed Kev Magee and his entourage.\nAnd suddenly they realized where their mistake had been. The answer was right there, in the center of the frame. Breeze had assumed they were the point of Zero\u2019s actions. That she wanted sex after all. Or a meal ticket, at any price. But no\u2014Breeze was just another game piece, just like the baby and Keisha and poor dead Doug the zoomer.\nThe carpet on the staircase was plush and new-smelling, the corridor spacious. They were walking side by side, each with one of Zero\u2019s hands on a shoulder, Keisha taking tiny steps in her tight silver dress. All the while getting closer as Kev Magee loitered by the entrance to the grand box, waiting for his close-up. Ten feet away now, surrounded by security.\nIn their peripheral, Breeze saw a uniformed server working their way up a side staircase\u2014the place was a maze\u2014carrying a tray piled with treats and printables, stack of food so high they could barely see over it. The server fell into line behind the three of them.\n\u201cI think this must be Breeze Frame,\u201d Kev said, in a booming baritone. He lit up with pleasure and surprise, as if he hadn\u2019t planned this encounter down to its tacks. With a flick of one blue-nailed hand, he signaled the muscly types surrounding him. They parted, melting to the walls like so much overheated glacier.\nThe clamp of Zero\u2019s fingers released its grip on Breeze\u2019s shoulder. Kev Magee offered a megawatt smile. The journo was in position, optimal camera distance.\n\u201cCome on over here, my young hero,\u201d the CEO prompted. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to meet you. Do you shake hands?\u201d\nBreeze did the only thing they could think of. They pivoted sideways and pushed Keisha back, hard, toward the nearest muscly type. Surely any act of aggression would make the security guards snap to order.\nBut the guard wasn\u2019t in position. He was collapsing, doing a twitch-and-drool into the new carpets. They all were.\nA flat disk rose above Zero\u2019s head, sweeping the corridor. Taser-drone?\nMolten light bubbled on the edges of Breeze\u2019s field of vision. They fought the desire to make a mental run for it as the tray of food packets hit the floor behind them. Behind it, the server\u2014it looked like Bob, Breeze realized, Bob the missing zoomer\u2014broke into a run . . .\n. . . don\u2019t white out, don\u2019t white out . . .\nBreeze grabbed for Keisha, pressing their body over her, sinking them both into thick velvet curtain.\n. . . it was Bob, literally trampling the poleaxed muscle, scrambling over their broad backs as, arms out, he caught fire, going up like a torch, embracing Kev Magee in a flaming hug in the doorway of the CEO\u2019s box . . .\n. . . screams, an auditorium full of people screaming now . . .\nZero did one last thing with her taser and it dropped into the heap of twitching security guards. She gave Breeze a contemptuous glance, ripped off the prosthetic scar tissue covering her face, and tossed it at them as she vaulted up into the array of pipes in the ceiling.\nThere were weeks of questions afterward, of course, and Breeze had to answer them again and again. When had Zero shown up? Had they checked her Orphan\u2019s Club membership? Didn\u2019t they suspect the scar wasn\u2019t real? Did they know what she really looked like? What had she promised them? What did they think of Magee? Did they know he had a thing for wide-eyed idealistic kids?\nIt was the footage that kept them out of jail\u2014Breeze\u2019s shaky cam shots of Zero and her military-grade taser drone, working over the muscle. The follow-up shots after Breeze tried to climb into the pipes, attempting to give chase but getting wedged\u2014there were no gaps wide enough for their shoulders. And Keisha, ripping off her shawl and trying to put out the flames on the burning bodies.\nInola vouched and vouched and vouched again, and made the Orphan\u2019s Club get them lawyers, who argued Breeze and Keisha could never have afforded any of the tech involved in the hit.\nFirebombs and flying tasers cost real money, after all.\nIt was billionaires killing billionaires, just as Keisha had said. And for what? Breaking with their cohort? Pitching in with the rest of humankind?\nNearly three weeks passed, long days of secured custody, of zoning out in the Hayride and taking appointments with Inola. Of telling the security people their story, over and over again, every last detail.\nPermitted visit to a gym every day. Nap every afternoon.\nNo pings from Moil.\nNo job.\nNo baby.\nNo friend.\nWhen security let them go, issuing stern warnings to turn down all interview opps unless they wanted to risk getting arrested again, Breeze walked through Ashevak Park, past a sim shoot\u2014historical, with fake nineteen-fifties families eating a fake barbecue. Business as usual. They watched for a while, feeling a little numb.\nThen, with no other destination in mind, they headed to the corner of Magenta block.\nKeisha was there, eating a printed muffin on one of the ready-made stoops, dressed in fireproof pants. A welding torch was tucked at her feet.\nBreeze stopped. Dropped their head. Almost walked on.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Keisha signed, patting the space beside her.\nBreeze perched on the bench. \u201cThey let you out a week ago, they said.\u201d\nShe nodded.\n\u201cAlice?\u201d\n\u201cHomed. There was a bidding war, actually. One of the Magee heirs took her. She\u2019s probably\u2014\u201d She pointed in the direction of Head Office.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Breeze shuddered. \u201cThat\u2019s good?\u201d\n\u201cGood, yeah. But. I kind of miss her. All that time keeping her alive. Habit forming?\u201d\nBreeze picked at their cuffs for a second. \u201cWere you going to leave her, that day?\u201d\nKeisha let out a weird, low chuckle. \u201cFor a minute. You didn\u2019t give me the choice.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that,\u201d they said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\nKeisha shrugged. \u201cOne less thing to feel bad about.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve, you know,\u201d Breeze added. \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t. Insist. Assume? You\u2019d have kept her.\u201d\nKeisha smiled a little at that. \u201cIn jail, I thought about how that was the thing I\u2019d miss most about you. The way you thought well of me.\u201d\n\u201cThink. I still think well of you,\u201d Breeze said.\nThey glanced at each other, then away. Then back. All under eyelashes and through overgrown hair. Trying to see each other without the weight of obligations or thunderclouds of mutual resentment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a good team, you know,\u201d Breeze added.\n\u201cWe are,\u201d she agreed.\n\u201cIf you wanted to try staying homed together, we could put in a provisional family agreement, at the Club.\u201d\nHer jaw dropped. For a second, she looked like she might cry.\nBreeze put up both hands. \u201cNo assumptions, no pressure. There\u2019s an app to walk us through making a fair deal. Short-term, renewable. And only if you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf we both want,\u201d she said.\nIt was hard to catch their breath, suddenly. \u201cI get it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\nKeisha nodded. Put out a hand, checked that it was okay, and then wrapped it around their fingers.\nThat day Alice\u2019s mom had gone missing, the two of them had been in her mother\u2019s room, spread out on the bed, ignoring math and rhetoric. Taking a minute out from trying to get by and do school, all while trying to figure out how to avoid getting shot. It was their first time together, for sex. More than blowing off steam, less than romance.\nAnd it would maybe have been a one-off hookup, study buddies getting busy. A little anatomy to go with the quadratic equations.\nThey\u2019d showered, had sex, showered again. They\u2019d fed Alice and put her in her bouncy swing. As the afternoon wore on and Cynthia didn\u2019t return, they\u2019d even washed the bedsheets. Breeze had enjoyed that\u2014enjoyed playing house, spouse, and baby makes three. Imagining old-school family.\nAll pretty fun . . . until it hadn\u2019t ended.\nWas Keisha remembering that too?\n\u201cGood morning, Breeze!\u201d Moil chirped to life for the first time since their release, interrupting the flow of memory. \u201cI have a gig in iceberg fabrication! Punch in time is in twenty minutes.\u201d\n\u201cAccept gig,\u201d Breeze said. They squeezed Keisha\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat if we meet after work, eat some chicken sticks, and talk about it then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said, and with that she ran a single finger over the burned-in brand over Breeze\u2019s eye, and the two of them got to their feet, Keisha heading off to fuse the joints and pipes and bones of Kevinsberg together with fire, while Breeze joined the countless thousands making desperation ice, dumping cold hope by the ton into the still-warming sea.\nToronto author and editor L.X.

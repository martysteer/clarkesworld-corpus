Amir avoids making eye contact with the bathers in adjacent patches with rigorous politeness. At sixteen, he\u2019s already spent a hundred personal growth hours thinking about civic decency, appreciates the role of uninterrupted private rituals in fostering social cohesion\u2014\n\u2014then someone comes out of the mist and straight into his line of vision, Amir thinks by accident. He tries to keep his eyes on what he\u2019s doing. The sparse rivulets of soapy water starting in his elbows and armpits are usually an easy bliss to meditate on, how they track down his skin, how they catch and collect on little hairs. Water coalescing from mist doesn\u2019t have enough body to drip to the floor. Amir can feel it evaporate at his hips, his thighs, his ankles.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d says the interrupting someone-who-turns-out-to-be-Mani, and Amir\u2019s head lifts before his principles regroup. Her teeth are chattering but she smiles gamely through it. \u201cMy patch is really cold. Does that happen?\u201d\n\u201cNot that I remember?\u201d he says. \u201cShow me?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d she clatters. \u201cThanks. This way.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t recall ever being approached by another bather in the mist before. She\u2019s naked, so is he, so is everyone. Nudity isn\u2019t weird in water-scarce Beirut at the height of summer. Less clothing means less sweat. It\u2019s her still-soapy hair that strikes him: so thick that there\u2019s two inches of it plastered soaking to her head, which of course means she\u2019s nearly at the end of her timeslot. The mist takes a long time to permeate a head of hair.\nIt\u2019s so crowded. They weave through an infinity mirror of bathing bodies which fade in the middle distance into a wall of mist. Amir wonders what brought his new friend all the way to his patch when any neighbor would\u2019ve been glad to help.\n\u201cYou\u2019re from Beirut-4?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cThe finest of all arbitrary urban planning constructs,\u201d she calls behind her.\nAt sixteen, Amir doesn\u2019t believe in competitive jokes about city zones, just as he doesn\u2019t believe in identities constructed in opposition. He doesn\u2019t say anything. It doesn\u2019t seem the right moment.\nMani finds the four lit wands in the mist that mark the corners of patch 49.\n\u201cCold, right?\u201d\nAmir steps solemnly into the center of her patch for a few seconds. The concentrated plume of mist envelops him.\n\u201cFeels okay to me?\u201d\nMani shoots him an aghast look, moves into her patch as Amir steps out. She gives a long-suffering sigh. \u201cWhy are they upgrading our mister? Beirut-3 needs it more.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not physiologically reacting to a new environment?\u201d Amir counters. \u201cAll the misters have the same temperature settings.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Mani says.\n\u201cPretty sure.\u201d\nShe readies a retort, then shakes it off. \u201cThanks anyway,\u201d she says, kneading her hair. \u201cI pulled you away while your mist is running.\u201d Sudsy water trickles onto her shoulders.\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Enjoy your shower,\u201d Amir says, and waves himself off. Enjoy your shower. He\u2019s vaguely disappointed by the whole exchange for a reason he can\u2019t examine.\nIn the airing room, hot blasts of air spread warmth through his chest. This fills him with something like gratitude. He second-guesses whether he might\u2019ve been cold, before.\n\u201cTwo degrees lower,\u201d says a voice he recognizes.\n\u201cReally?\u201d he says after a moment. Now he\u2019s vaguely happy for reasons he can\u2019t place.\n\u201cI asked the supervisor. By community agreement, motion passed five years ago, the Beirut-3 misting room is two degrees cooler than default in summer.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d says Amir. \u201cGood of you to correct a misbelief.\u201d\n\u201cMy pan-humanist agenda\u2019s pretty on point,\u201d she says. The wry note in her voice doesn\u2019t irritate him. \u201cI\u2019m Mani. I live near al-Raouch\u00e9. Want to do a personal growth hour together?\u201d\nAmir doesn\u2019t remember what he stammered then, but it must\u2019ve been affirmative, because the rest of his teenage days have Mani in them, as the water situation worsens, then gets a bit better, then worsens, then stabilizes.\nIt\u2019s a lot of days to have with someone. A lot of staring at the cloudless sky on a blanket from the exposed seabed of al-Raouch\u00e9, a lot of synth-protein shawarmas in Hamra, a lot of silent meditative spans huddled in Mani\u2019s bed because talking hurts too much with the thirst and their mouths so dry.\nBut it\u2019s also true that all the days in a human life can feel like not enough.\nThe first time the water situation shows signs of getting better is a Monday. Amir knows this because that\u2019s the day for municipal announcements in Beirut-1 through -5. He and Mani are sitting in a seabed caf\u00e9 in the shadow of al-Raouch\u00e9. The rock pillar\u2019s become a sort of geologic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and though the bay has begun to recover from the decades of hyperwarming that dried it out, Beirut Grid have installed a seawall to protect the shops and caf\u00e9s that went up while water was critically scarce.\n\u201cIt\u2019s oddly beautiful,\u201d Amir says to Mani. The seawall is muraled with depictions of water-protection craft, the lighthouse, the rickety old Ferris wheel on the boardwalk. Beyond it, the sea shushes loudly. The sun festers behind the clouds and because Amir and Mani have been through screen-mist they\u2019re lounging in just swim knickers.\nAmir rotates his cup and watches bits of tealeaf bob near the bottom. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s unethical to celebrate a built environment that\u2019s a direct result of water scarcity?\u201d he asks.\nMani looks up from her book: Pan-Humanism in the Middle East. It\u2019s just come out, and she\u2019s been excited to read it because it challenges some of the core arguments of Stella Kadri\u2019s Pan-Humanism: Hope and Pragmatics, a book of heroic stature for how it butterfly-effected the sociopolitics of the modern world.\n\u201cNot unethical to feel joy if no one\u2019s suffering,\u201d she says.\n\u201cFish desperate to swim figure eights around al-Raouch\u00e9 could be suffering.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to draw a line where arguments descend into absurdity.\u201d She cracks a smile, powers off her book.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing absurd about a healthy marine ecosystem,\u201d Amir says. Her pragmatism makes him uneasy. As a life skill it sits uncomfortably against his complete dedication to absolutes: the True, the Good. But it\u2019s captivating. It makes her quick to laughter and gracious, even excited, about changing her mind.\nMani gulps her tea. \u201cStill hot. So now I\u2019ve burned my tongue worrying about the fish.\u201d She glances down. \u201cDidn\u2019t I turn that off?\u201d Her book\u2019s flashing a notification. So\u2019s her watch. So are her shades.\nAmir blows on his tea before he sips. \u201cOn override? Must be important.\u201d\nThey read the message, heads hovering together. It\u2019s from the municipality. Beirut Water pilot. First sectors, random pick: Beirut-4, Beirut-9. Water reconnected via mains for 24hrs from 2PM. OK: taps, showers, hoses. Use judgment: industrial electronics.\nIt takes a moment to sink in.\n\u201cWait. Are you kidding?\u201d\n\u201cI had no idea they were ready to try,\u201d Mani says.\nThey\u2019re both gathering their things, tapping over a tab-close, standing. \u201cWarsaw managed to run a water supply off a condensation system for a week,\u201d Amir says. \u201cBut this is Beirut.\u201d\n\u201cSo what if it is?\u201d Mani says. \u201cBeirut is superb! Beirut has water!\u201d\nThey\u2019re skipping along the stairs to the boardwalk. A louder murmur than the sea is rising from the seabed caf\u00e9: the municipality message spreading.\nThey reach Mani\u2019s house in record time. It\u2019s a hot day and Amir is itching from sweat and screen residue with an urgency he\u2019s never felt before.\n\u201cMom? There\u2019s water!\u201d Mani shouts into the dark house.\n\u201cNo one,\u201d says Amir.\n\u201cAh, she\u2019s got an hour of cross-skilling this afternoon.\u201d\n\u201cShould we wash our hands?\u201d Amir pants, chasing Mani up the stairs.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Have to go all the way.\u201d She opens a door in the hall. \u201cIn here.\u201d\nAmir follows her. She\u2019s planted in front of a bone-dry shower stall. The showerhead is impossibly shiny. There\u2019s still a bit of plastic wrapping on it. It\u2019s an antique, but brand new.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly two o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\u201cAre they going to be able to do this?\u201d\n\u201cTrust, Amir. Trust.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think it might even be heated?\u201d\nMani, scooting out of her swim knickers, raises her eyebrows at him till he shoves his down too. \u201cI bet it is.\u201d She reaches into the shower stall and twists a handle. It screeches with disuse.\nThey wait.\nAt exactly two, their ears fill with the furious sound of a rainstorm. Then their own whooping. Mani bounds in without testing the temperature, makes a shrill sound. \u201cIt\u2019s warming up!\u201d She reaches out and grabs Amir\u2019s arm. Her grip raises goosebumps. \u201cCome on, get in!\u201d\nHe does. It\u2019s the most sublime thing he\u2019s ever felt. He puts his hands flat on the wet tiles and closes his eyes under a hammering of water.\n\u201cHow long can we stay in here?\u201d He manages not to choke. Such a quantity of water is coursing down his face and onto his tongue.\n\u201cWe\u2019re being good by sharing. Let\u2019s not get out for a while,\u201d Mani says. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d He opens his eyes to look at her but her face is blurry-wet. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s private,\u201d Mani says. But she wraps her arms around his waist, her belly against his flank, and rests her forehead on his cheek. Their bodies are slippery and warm. Amir hears himself make a purring noise. \u201cOh. Wow.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cNot like the mist,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNo. Totally different.\u201d\nSharing a patch is encouraged in the misting rooms. They\u2019ve done this many times. They wash each other\u2019s backs and argue about what true pan-humanism might look like. It\u2019s pleasurable. But this\u2014private, warm, untimed, all this water sheeting down\u2014is a whole different register of existence.\n\u201cI think I should tell you,\u201d Mani says, \u201cthat I\u2019m thinking about sex.\u201d\nAmir opens one eye to look at her, can only see the top of her head against his cheek. \u201cMe, too,\u201d he says, almost but not totally redundantly. Mani\u2019s got a good view.\nThey\u2019ve almost so many times, but never. This moment feels ripe, so very theirs. But it\u2019s also the wrong moment.\n\u201cWater, though, Mani! Mindfulness. Presence. This.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWe might never be able to have this again.\u201d\n\u201cWe might never have any given thing again,\u201d Mani says, the pedantic one for a change.\n\u201cBut all this water,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re right,\u201d says Mani, hushed in the hypnotic roar of the shower. \u201cAll this water.\u201d\nThe Beirut Water pilot is considered only a partial success; it isn\u2019t repeated again for almost two years. By then Mani has left. Amir will remember different selections of things from the day of the pilot depending on how hot or cold his thoughts are, but he\u2019ll cap the memory with this, every single time: the fond way Mani slides her hand against his drenched ribs under the flow of hot water before she entirely lets him go.\nAmir sleeps poorly the night before university assignments are due to go out. He knows but does not know-know that he will get into Beirut and Environs, his first choice. His grades are excellent. He\u2019s done twenty percent more personal growth hours than required\u2014he likes doing them\u2014and his civic engagement score is the highest ever for Beirut-3\u2019s Academy. But he\u2019s still nervous. When his watch buzzes at four AM, he startles awake: BEIRUT AND ENVIRONS FUTURIST COLLEGE, UTOPIAN PHILOSOPHY STREAM.\nHe taps over the notification to Mani with a string of exclamation points, his foggy enthusiasm-slash-relief dampened only slightly when she doesn\u2019t respond right away. Mani\u2019s grades are stellar but her civic engagement score\u2019s not great. She\u2019d wanted Pan-Humanist Polytechnic but Amir has a sinking feeling she\u2019s been assigned to College of the Near East.\nHe composes a fortifying speech in his head as he gets ready, complete with references to the most famous pan-humanist thinkers who\u2019d attended Near East and their contributions to society. Near East is a great school, and it\u2019s half an hour closer to Beirut and Environs by bullet than Pan-Humanist Polytechnic. Mani will do amazing things wherever she goes.\nAmir is fifteen minutes early for the morning\u2019s personal growth session. They\u2019ve only just opened the doors to the Reflection Center, a handful of early risers filtering in under the kaleidoscopic arches, quiet murmurs of conversation as they set up mats and blankets on the centuries-old stone floor. But Mani is already there waiting for him, sitting cross-legged on her mat, gripping her hands together so tight that her fingers are white to the knuckle. Amir is brought up short.\n\u201cMani?\u201d he asks, uncertain.\nWordlessly, she raises her wrist for him to see, the notification still up on the watch screen: INTL UNIVERSITY FOR HUMANISM, MOGADISHU, GLOBAL PROGRESS.\nAmir feels his heart go ka-thunk. Global Progress at IUH is . . . he\u2019d thought about applying, more as a lark than anything, but they only accept three students per year, from the entire world, and he never thought . . .\n\u201cWow,\u201d he says, dropping down next to her, voice low so it won\u2019t echo. \u201cWow, Mani, that\u2019s\u2014I didn\u2019t even know you were going to apply, that\u2019s\u2014amazing. That\u2019s so amazing. I\u2019m so, so proud of you,\u201d he says, and even means it.\nMani\u2019s face is complicated with emotions, flickering by too quickly for Amir to properly catalog them, happy-sad-excited-nervous. \u201cIt\u2019s far away,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d he corrects. \u201cMogadishu, can you even imagine! Maybe I could visit you, one time.\u201d This is unlikely, and they both know it. Mogadishu\u2019s not on a clean air travel vector with Beirut yet. He\u2019d have to do two months of civic engagement and a month of personal growth to balance taking a dirty flight for leisure. Mani musters a smile anyway.\n\u201cI\u2019d love that,\u201d she says. In the center of the room, today\u2019s meditation guide is setting up at the podium. The overhead heaters have been switched on, spreading the scent of the cedar beams throughout the space. Mani bumps Amir\u2019s shoulder with her own. Her smile builds into something a little more true. \u201cCome on, though. We both know you\u2019ll be too busy changing the world to think of me at all.\u201d\n2: THE MECHANISM, A WORTHWHILE TRADE\nIt\u2019s not that Mani\u2019s right, because of course Amir thinks of her. He thinks of her every single day, at least at first. But then the water starts coming back to Beirut, and Amir gets swept up in the civic spirit, in the new swell of hope. He switches out of Utopian Philosophy the day after he helps a volunteer group install a kinetic walkway on the university\u2019s main green\u2014they expect to be able to clean-power the quad\u2019s lamps for two hours each night\u2014and enrolls in Urban Design. The idea of regeneration-planning the city is wedged deep under his skin.\nAfter graduation he walks into a competitive apprenticeship with Beirut Grid, where he meets Rafa, who\u2019s working on the Bekaa Valley\u2019s poetry microcity and in the capital on up-skill, and Ester, a third generation Beiruti whose grandmother led the rights movement for domestic workers at the turn of the century. They all fall for each other almost simultaneously.\nHe\u2019s twenty-two. He\u2019s got an apartment on al-Manara. Through his kitchen window, the lighthouse illuminates the brushstroke froth of the Mediterranean and every time Amir Tarabi sees it he says a silent word of hope for the sea, for it to have body and swell with muscle forever. He remembers his conversation with Mani about the fish, imagines a day in the future when they\u2019ll wade into the surf and see entire schools, silver and bronze and fleeting, with their own eyes.\nAmir\u2019s at work late when his watch buzzes. Rafa and Ester. Let us in, we\u2019re at the door to Research-4.\nHe limps down the hall on pins-and-needles. The recollection that they\u2019d planned a dinner date for tonight\u2014for an hour ago\u2014wallops him right before he releases the door.\nRafa and Ester don\u2019t usually band together against Amir, but here they are, standing side by side wearing exactly the same expression, and it\u2019s not we\u2019re so glad to see you.\nEster raises a package and Amir smells food.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember ever blowing through a date with Amir when I worked at the Grid,\u201d Ester says pointedly to Rafa.\n\u201cHmm, Ester,\u201d Rafa replies theatrically. \u201cIs that because you were respectful of his time and attention? Because you understood that interpersonal relationships require careful cultivation?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Amir squeaks, letting them in, putting a hand out for their coats. \u201cCan I explain what happened? Not an excuse, just context.\u201d\nEster looks at Rafa. Rafa looks at Ester. Both of them look skeptically at Amir.\n\u201cYou guys, I\u2019m sorry. Do you remember my Crowdgrow thing?\u201d\n\u201cWhere you wanted to foster-home ecoboosted flowers around the neighborhood?\u201d asks Rafa. \u201cYou told us about it last month.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d says Amir. \u201cWe found out today the bio team managed to get a couple of shoots synthesizing air pollutants in the lab. Mesilla asked me to put together a grant application for the project. If it gets funded, she wants me to lead the research team.\u201d\nAmir\u2019s fortunate that both his partners know what this means to him. Their faces soften.\n\u201cNice. I knew Mesilla would come around,\u201d Ester says. \u201cYou still don\u2019t get to flake on dates.\u201d\nIn a deserted Beirut Grid kitchenette, Amir fetches plates and Rafa piles herbed eggplant casserole onto them. While they eat Amir projects stained photos of cross-sectioned saplings onto a wall, and Rafa and Ester mmm through his commentary for a few minutes, until Rafa says,\n\u201cAmir, love, it\u2019s nine PM and you\u2019re still using words like \u2018floral load.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cGood point, Rafa,\u201d Ester says. \u201cAmir, tap over projector control.\u201d\nThe projection cuts to the backdrop of his favorite immersion strategy game.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got dessert,\u201d Rafa says. He produces a huge bag of caramel chews and a bottle of whiskey. They clear some space.\n\u201cOoh,\u201d Ester says, confirming a glance-down-pause setting. \u201cWe need to be able to snack.\u201d\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Amir says. \u201cThis never goes well. It\u2019s an immersion game.\u201d\n\u201cShush,\u201d Rafa says. \u201cIt\u2019s destined to be a drunk immersion game.\u201d\nTheir love is like this, comfortable and forgiving of Amir\u2019s faults. Then, at the beginning of summer, Ester breaks up with Rafa and Amir\u2014no hard feelings, just different needs, different takes on life. It\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t hurt. Amir and Rafa spend several days moping in each other\u2019s laps, swapping sympathy cuddles. But Amir\u2019s always believed what pan-humanist theory says: that love is respect and collaboration held together with radical acceptance, freely gained and lost.\nAmir tells himself to take comfort in this, and does his best to keep an open heart.\nThe Future Good conference in Hanoi is the biggest of its kind, twelve academic streams and full air travel exemption. Amir and Rafa apply for spots every year and never get them, until they do. They\u2019re giddy on the flight over: neither of them gets to leave Beirut often, and they\u2019ve certainly never had a reason to travel by air together.\nThey attend the welcome address then spend the allotted cultural hours in the Old Quarter, sitting on low stools with their knees knocking together, feeding each other quail egg b\u00e1nh bao. Rafa\u2019s old advisor is leading a Q&A session on arts micro-cities, but Rafa and Amir lose track of time strolling the banks of the Red River hand in hand. Once they\u2019ve missed that, there\u2019s no reason to go back to the hotel, so they stay out till three AM sampling sticky rice wine, which everyone tries to warn them is stronger than it tastes.\nThe next morning\u2019s reclamation technologies forum is something of an accident.\nThey\u2019re trying\u2014oh, Amir is almost too embarrassed to admit it. They\u2019re trying to find breakfast, and Rafa spies a cute ambiguously-gendered human with multicolored hair and a dapper three-piece suit sneaking out of one of the conference rooms, their arms full of coffee cups and muffins. Amir and Rafa are hungry, so they creep into the back, sights set on the buffet table lining the rear wall, and there is Mani Rizk, making her way to the front podium.\nAmir\u2019s entire body floods with adrenaline. He grabs Rafa by the cuff of his sleeve and steers him to one of the chairs. He\u2019s trying to be stealthy but Rafa is mumbling confused protests around a coffee-stirrer and Mani sees them, of course she does, and her face goes taken aback then pleased. And then she does a pretty good job of pretending like she didn\u2019t see Amir, because she\u2019s got a lecture to deliver, after all.\nRafa stares at Amir in confusion for about a minute before his eyebrows go up in a particularly knowing manner. He spends the rest of the lecture elbowing Amir any time Mani says something brilliant, which is about every thirty seconds.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Rafa asks, delighted, when the lecture is over and they\u2019re waiting at the back of a densely knotted crowd. \u201cWho is she, eh? Political rival? Academic crush? Long lost lover?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d protests Amir, a little too loudly for the enclosed space. \u201cShe\u2019s just\u2014a friend. We were friends, when we were young. That was all.\u201d\nIf nothing else, Mani seems at least as eager to see him as he is to see her: her attention keeps sliding away from whoever she\u2019s talking with, darting to Amir over and over. He smiles, catching her eye, spreading his hands in an awkward gesture that he hopes will convey both hi and I\u2019ll wait. As soon as the crowd thins enough for her to break away she does so, inching her way to Amir and Rafa with a string of apologies and excuses.\n\u201cAmir,\u201d she says, and half-tackles him in a hug.\nShe\u2019s round and solid and small\u2014it\u2019s weird, Amir hadn\u2019t hit his growth spurt until he was eighteen, and in his memory they\u2019re still like that, him looking up. Now Mani barely comes up to his collarbone. He wraps arms that feel oddly long and lanky around her shoulders, holds her tight.\nWhen she finally lets go her eyes look suspiciously bright, but that might just be the ceiling ambients. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming to my talk,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt was kind of an accident,\u201d Amir admits.\nBeside him, Rafa groans. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her that!\u201d He turns to Mani. \u201cWhat he means to say is, he wanted to surprise you. And your lecture was phenomenal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to her,\u201d says Amir, affronted. \u201cAbout the surprise, I mean. Your lecture was phenomenal. I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d been studying hydrophobic materials.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m part of a water reclamation forum at IUH,\u201d says Mani, and then, to Rafa, \u201cand I\u2019ve known Amir too long to expect flattery. I\u2019m Mani.\u201d\n\u201cRafa Zarkesian. I consult on architecture projects for art spaces in Beirut.\u201d\n\u201cRafa\u2019s my boyfriend,\u201d says Amir. It seems important to mention.\n\u201cOh, I thought I recognized you! I\u2019ve seen your picture on Amir\u2019s stream. How long\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMx Rizk?\u201d cuts in a voice over Mani\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to intrude, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, of course,\u201d says Mani. \u201cSorry, I really should\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d says Amir. \u201cIt was good to see you, Mani, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she interrupts, \u201cafter closing remarks. There\u2019s that gallery installation, the interactive city grid? I haven\u2019t been able to see it yet. If you have time, maybe the three of us . . . \u201d\nThey\u2019ve got a pre-dawn flight back to Beirut; they\u2019d planned to get to bed early and had contemplated skipping the closing remarks entirely.\n\u201cThat would be wonderful,\u201d says Rafa. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d\nThat night, it rains in Hanoi, just a light, champagne-fizz mist, but it\u2019s enough to lend a celebratory attitude to the entire city. They find Mani waiting for them outside the installation\u2019s entrance, a crown of water droplets clinging to her hair, reflecting a riot of blinking, changeable light. Amir grips Rafa\u2019s hand a little harder.\n\u201cWe got lucky,\u201d Mani says, squinting as she tilts her face upward, holding out a cupped palm as if to collect water there. \u201cGood closing note for the conference.\u201d\n\u201cLucky,\u201d echoes Amir, feeling a little dazed.\nRafa bumps his shoulder against Amir\u2019s. \u201cCome on, you two,\u201d he says, already fond. \u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d\nThe installation is a concept city rendered one-fiftieth scale in shimmering interactive holograms and delicate print-resin latticework. The space isn\u2019t enclosed, and the scrim of the rain occasionally does glitchy things to the projections that make Amir groan in solidarity with the event planners. Rafa and Mani are both charmed, however, and Amir can\u2019t help but be delighted by their delight. He gets video of the support cables of a projected suspension bridge twining around Mani\u2019s ankles, insistent and loving as a cat. They take turns decorating Rafa with sprigs of star-like flowers in the constructed wetlands section.\nAt one point, Amir is walking sandwiched between the two of them, face craned up to ogle the dazzling phyllotactic archway they\u2019re underneath. Rafa reaches down to twine his fingers with Amir\u2019s, and, after a moment that might be hesitation, on the other side Mani reaches down and does the same. Amir can feel his own heartbeat in his palms and he\u2019s sure Mani and Rafa must be able to as well, but neither of them says a thing.\nAfterward, they make promises about staying in better contact. There\u2019s a conference in Mogadishu, only six months out; it\u2019s not a perfect fit for his research, but maybe Amir can swing an invite. It\u2019s ridiculous, really, that Amir hasn\u2019t yet seen Mani\u2019s new city, Mani\u2019s new life. Mani\u2019s so busy\u2014they\u2019re all so busy, but they can message more, at least. Maybe even holochat, sometimes. They work in related fields, after all; it\u2019s their responsibility to foster international communication and collaboration. Plus, they miss each other. There\u2019s no reason to fall so out of touch.\nThey say all this, and mean it. But, well. Life.\n3: EACH BRICK LAID THOUSANDS OF TIMES OVER\nThe lab at Beirut Grid successfully demonstrates at-quantity ecoboosting in model organisms two weeks before Amir turns twenty-eight, which is a pretty good early birthday present, as far as he\u2019s concerned. To celebrate, Mesilla takes Amir to the botanical garden in Rmeil to evaluate options for the Crowdgrow pilot; Hanne from New Projects tags along.\nThe conservatory curator herself gives them a guided tour. She leads them down dense green walkways, extolls the growth patterns of crawler vines and Chouf evergreens, both commendably hardy species, survivors of the worst of the water scarcity. Mesilla seems invested\u2014she examines a potted evergreen the curator\u2019s handed her, sinks a finger in the soil\u2014but Hanne is paying zero attention, cleaning up her notifications on Impulse or something. Then, out of nowhere Hanne blurts,\n\u201cOh, Mesilla. They just announced funds for a world-first Wet City implementation.\u201d\nThe crinkly cellophane of the potted evergreen goes still. The curator says, \u201cAnything else I can show you?\u201d into the silence; Amir babbles about high-altitude crawler vines. They move on to another greenhouse.\nIn line for lunch, after, Amir waits for Mesilla to pick his brain. He\u2019s all but decided he wants to try ecoboosting crawler vines, but wouldn\u2019t mind talking it through.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Mesilla says as soon as they\u2019ve found a sunny patch of grass on Achrafieh green for a picnic, \u201cThere\u2019s a Wet City funding opportunity? When\u2019s the deadline?\u201d\n\u201cOne month,\u201d says Hanne. \u201cNot much time to put together a proposal.\u201d\nAmir puffs out his breath, struggling to rearrange his thoughts. \u201cHas anyone proven the water reclamation wings would work at that scale? Wasn\u2019t that the sticking point in Colson and Smith\u2019s paper?\u201d\nHanne jabs the chunk of carrot on the end of her fork at Amir. \u201cRight. But the All People funds were greenlit on the back of a rebuttal slash instruction manual by\u2014\u201d Hanne\u2019s eyes blink away as she navigates Impulse. \u201cBy Sameen Jaladi at IUH Mogadishu.\u201d The name of Mani\u2019s school fills Amir with a mixture of possessiveness and pride.\nAmir can think of twenty reasons to be wary: the technical challenge of large-scale moisture collection, yes, but also overheating the built habitat, uncontrollable wet seasons, mold and mosquitos and respiratory conditions. That\u2019s not to mention his immediate questions around clean-powering the wings and purging waste bays. He puts his sandwich in its basket, turns to Mesilla.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of resources toward an unproven concept. We\u2019d have to divert money and energy we could spend in demonstrably useful directions,\u201d he says. Like on Crowdgrow, he doesn\u2019t say.\n\u201cBut in theory,\u201d Mesilla says. \u201cEvery metropolis a little green oasis. Latticed condensation wings, clean water from the air. Theoretically, no shortages ever again.\u201d\nShe unwraps a bit more sandwich in a studied way: bean protein fillet in minted yogurt sauce, her usual. \u201cCan someone get me the Jaladi paper and the bid guidelines?\u201d\nAmir\u2019s already poring through Impulse. He taps the documents over to Mesilla with two hard blinks. \u201cThey\u2019re with you.\u201d\nThey walk back to the Beirut Grid offices talking about Amir\u2019s birthday plans\u2014Joud\u2019s taking him on an overnight bullet to Damascus; their first trip together as a couple\u2014but the lunch conversation is still humming under his skin.\nTwo days later, when Mesilla pulls Amir and Hanne aside and asks them to put together a Wet City bid, it doesn\u2019t surprise him.\nIt\u2019s a hot day with a really crappy clean air index. Everyone\u2019s been permitted to stay home but a few of them are in, including Amir, because his apartment was so hot he feared he might melt into his armchair. The heat reminds him of sitting in a seabed caf\u00e9 with Mani, which of course reminds him of the Future Good conference with Mani, which takes Amir\u2019s thoughts nowhere helpful at all.\nThe Impulse note arrives from Mesilla in two parts. The first, short, buzzes at his wrist and pings urgently in his display. It\u2019s to Amir and Hanne, two words: We won!\nHe expects excitement but feels only bone-tiredness.\nThe second part of Mesilla\u2019s note is a travel itinerary on wider distribution. The subject line makes Amir\u2019s body do weird things: Academics from IUH Mogadishu. He taps it open on his wrist, as if he needs to see this in physical space, and sure enough:\nJaladi, Sameen\nProctor, Trevor\nGupta, Jan-Helga\nRizk, Mani\n\u201cShit,\u201d he croaks. His side of the office is empty. He can hear the descending xylophone of the bullet zipping along its girders through the open window, and nearer, a heat-oppressed bird call that sounds more tired than he does.\nHe blinks up his conversation thread with Mani. Their last exchange: Happy new year! from her to him, half a year ago; Happy new year!! from him to her a couple hours later, and since then, nothing. He winces.\nBeirut???? he taps over.\nMani\u2019s response is almost instant. Leave in a week.\n!!! Amir sends. His belly is one big knot.\nTook the effusive punctuation straight out of my mouth, she replies.\nAmir wrangles his way into airport chaperone duty for the IUH academics. At Future Good, running into Mani had been a sudden shock; the week he waits for her plane to arrive his nerves are like a leaky faucet. He can\u2019t eat properly but finds himself stocking his pantry with everything he remembers Mani loving: carob molasses, salted pili nuts, a Bekaa Valley Merlot, cashew feta cheese. Joud tries to season a stew with the good cinnamon sticks Amir picked up at al-Raouch\u00e9 market for spiced tea and Amir won\u2019t let them.\n\u201cI\u2019m saving those,\u201d Amir says, guiltily filing away that there should be a Joud-him-Mani dinner involving cinnamon sticks. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him. The plane from Mogadishu, oblivious and probably flying over Independent Greenland on other business, is killing him.\nThen he\u2019s at the airport and his Impulse tells him the flight from Mogadishu\u2019s arrived safely. Mani has sent him her Impulse geo, which means he can tell exactly when she\u2019s walking through customs and toward the public area.\nHe distracts himself by trying to calculate how long it\u2019s been since they\u2019ve seen each other using mental math. His Impulse helper picks up on his saccades. You seem to be working something out. Can I help? Amir moans and blinks it away. He finishes the calculation\u20141,513 days\u2014but now he can barely breathe. And then the arrivals door pistons up and a column of passengers is behind it. He sees Mani in the throng, and she sees him back.\nIt\u2019s not the moment he\u2019s been imagining. Mani\u2019s engrossed in conversation with her colleagues. She weaves them toward Amir and he wants to hug her but the fact that he\u2019s on official duty\u2014that there are three field-pioneering academics he\u2019s never met studying him\u2014plants him to his spot.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Mani says.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Amir says. Not wow, you and me in Beirut, like when we were seventeen. Which is what he\u2019s thinking.\n\u201cSameen, Trevor, Helga, Amir,\u201d Mani says, and then there\u2019s a blur and they\u2019re all on the bullet in the private compartment Amir booked and everyone is staring out the window at this city they\u2019ve missed or never seen before and the conversation turns to how wonderfully Beirut will function as a Wet City.\nHe tries not to catch Mani\u2019s eye too much, but when he does she gives him a conspiratorial smile he remembers. He thinks of the wine and the cheese. They\u2019ll get loads of time together later.\nExcept, the next day Mesilla kicks off the Wet City stuff in earnest. And Amir and Mani start to argue. A lot.\nIn some ways it\u2019s not new. They\u2019d argued as kids, the minutiae of pan-humanist theory over hot black tea: whether animals deserved more pronounced protection than plants, whether population control was ever justified, whether power should in all cases decentralize in the direction of local communities.\nBut now the stakes are different. They\u2019re different. The worst of the arguments take place during project meetings, in front of Hanne and Caveg and the rest of the team. Amir leaves meeting after meeting feeling battered. The way Mani seems to have a reassuring study on hand to refute each of his worries makes him clench his jaw in a very uncivic way. He\u2019s so embarrassed by the incessant jaw clenching he grows his beard out to hide it.\nThey avoid casual conversation for the better part of two weeks. Amir starts to hate going to work, which has never happened before. Then, one Monday, Mani stops at Amir\u2019s station, gets close to see if he\u2019s working in Impulse, and he can smell her perfume, mineral and saline and only the slightest bit sweet.\n\u201cHelp me draft an advisory? If you\u2019re not busy?\u201d she asks. She lifts a satchel. \u201cI brought us tea from kiosk auntie downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cAdvisory?\u201d Amir\u2019s immediately on edge. \u201cDo you need planning language in it? Can Caveg help?\u201d\nMani\u2019s eyebrows come down. \u201cI don\u2019t really need planning language in it. I just miss doing things together. I thought there\u2019d be a lot more of that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Amir says, and stands to follow. He remembers following her that first time, in the misting rooms. He doesn\u2019t understand himself. He\u2019s been waiting to have Mani back for a decade\u2014not a vague wistfulness, but an active full-body sort of waiting, if he\u2019s really examining it. And now she\u2019s right here, and he can\u2019t bring himself to speak to her without getting upset. The funny thing is that he\u2019s not even angry at her. It\u2019s something more like bedazzlement. She\u2019s a sun that blasts his vision into afterimages.\n\u201cOr,\u201d Amir says in the corridor, \u201cwe could go to our old caf\u00e9? It won\u2019t be too busy right now.\u201d\nMani nods decisively. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Sameen will happily take the kiosk auntie tea.\u201d\nThe bullet ride is mainly Mani pointing out new art installations and green spaces and Amir telling her what year they were built and why. He\u2019s good at this. He does almost all of them without Impulse, but confesses when he has to look one up. Mani gives him grief for not knowing them all by heart.\n\u201cEveryone told me, oh, Amir, Beirut Grid\u2019s own whizkid. A sort of city-planning savant. I guess I expected more,\u201d she teases.\n\u201cNo one said that,\u201d Amir says. \u201cAnd even if they did, IUH has given you impossible expectations.\u201d\n\u201cPan-humanism is all about realizing a civilizational system that game theory would say is impossible, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d says Amir. \u201cBut there\u2019s plain old pan-humanist theory impossible and then there\u2019s IUH Mogadishu impossible.\u201d\nThe bullet slows and stops beside their old caf\u00e9. They go down the boardwalk to their usual table, tap across an order of tea, and settle into their respective chairs. \u201cWow,\u201d says Amir.\n\u201cSwap adult clothes for swim knickers and shave the beard and it could be a decade ago.\u201d\nAmir lifts their order of tea off a tray bot. \u201cWere we that familiar with each other? Hard to believe.\u201d\nMani takes her glass from him. \u201cOh yeah. We were ridiculous. Like one person in two bodies, back then.\u201d\nAmir startles in a way that melts him into himself, like his chest is swallowing the rest of him, swallowing his words. Mani\u2019s always been the forthright one, but they both know he\u2019s more sentimental, and he\u2019s afraid that if he says anything now it will be too much.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like the beard?\u201d he manages.\nMani reaches across and strokes his cheek against the grain. \u201cI don\u2019t not like it,\u201d she says.\nAmir shakes his head at her. She withdraws her hand. He\u2019d forgotten how transparent they were to each other. Are, to each other.\n\u201cHow\u2019s Rafa?\u201d Mani says, stirring her tea.\n\u201cWe broke up last year.\u201d He doesn\u2019t bother waving it off. Mani will know it was a big deal.\nMani\u2019s silent a bit, then: \u201cI just ordered you a glass of \u02bfarak.\u201d\nAmir laughs and puts his head on his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s two PM But thank you.\u201d Seagulls croon from the frames of the yellow beach umbrellas. \u201cThis Wet City thing, Mani,\u201d he starts. Doesn\u2019t know how to finish.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d says Mani.\nAmir grimaces. \u201cThat obvious?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d This should be reassuring, but Mani\u2019s turning her teacup in slow circles, not meeting Amir\u2019s eyes. \u201cAmir-with-his-heart-not-in-it works with more passion than most humans on their best days. But I can tell.\u201d\nThis should also be reassuring. Instead Amir feels irritation spiking in his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve spent every moment of my workday for the past six days chasing down permitting documentation for an experimental metallofoam that\u2019s going to be used in less than two percent of the load-bearings struts of the wing structure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly how I envisioned my career path. But I\u2019m doing it. It\u2019s not fair to call me out for lack of enthusiasm.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t calling you out,\u201d says Mani. \u201cI think you\u2019re doing good work.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Amir. The \u02bfarak comes. He plucks it off the tray bot and sets it next to his teacup, aligning them carefully side by side. He can tell Mani is waiting for him to say something else. He shouldn\u2019t. He should try to steer the conversation back toward safety. \u201cDo you remember,\u201d he says, \u201cthe Crowdgrow project I told you about during the Future Good conference?\u201d\n\u201cYou were really excited about it,\u201d Mani says. \u201cIt seemed promising.\u201d\n\u201cIt was. The closed-room tests showed a fifteen percent improvement in air quality, and we had almost a thousand households signed up as testers. And we\u2019ve applied for continuation funding every open cycle since. Not a lot\u2014just enough for a pilot study. Less than we spend in administrative overhead on the Wet City project every week.\u201d\n\u201cBut no luck?\u201d asks Mani.\n\u201cBut no luck,\u201d agrees Amir.\n\u201cAmir,\u201d says Mani, but there\u2019s too much pity in the way she says his name.\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Amir says. \u201cThat it would be a waste. That Wet City is a better use of resources.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Mani. \u201cI do think that.\u201d The way she says this could have been kind, but it isn\u2019t.\n\u201cYou\u2019re always so sure of yourself,\u201d says Amir. The way he says this could have been a compliment, but it isn\u2019t. \u201cIs it ego?\u201d\n\u201cIs it jealousy?\u201d Mani shoots back.\nAmir feels that familiar muscle in his jaw tic. He takes a careful, measured sip of \u02bfarak, as if that will hide it. \u201cIf this goes wrong\u2014\u201d he begins, once he\u2019s sure his voice will come out steady.\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d interrupts Mani. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me to be afraid of trying something really big, really innovative, because there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll end up looking like fools? Now that\u2019s ego.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about personal reputation,\u201d Amir says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the wasted money, the time, the emotional investment\u2014do you know how demoralizing a project like this can be for a community if it fails\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t fail.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done all the tests and simulations and proof-of-concept models we can, Amir. The only way to be any more sure is to let someone else go first, and I\u2019m not willing to do that.\u201d\n\u201cEgo,\u201d says Amir.\n\u201cSo what,\u201d Mani snaps, sounding genuinely angry now, \u201cwe\u2019d all be better off staying in our backyards planting mutant daisies? Grow up, Amir. You have the chance to work on something that really, actually matters here, and you\u2019re too scared to take it.\u201d\nIf it were Amir, he would regret such harsh words immediately, start falling all over himself to apologize before the sting had a chance to land.\nBut it\u2019s Mani. And Mani always says what she means.\nAmir looks down at the now-empty glass cradled in his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should probably be getting back.\u201d\nMani stands, the legs of her chair protesting loudly against the concrete. \u201cWe get this chance\u2014\u201d she stops. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why you\u2019re making it so hard.\u201d\nHe should argue. Instead, he orders another \u02bfarak, and doesn\u2019t let himself watch her walk to the bullet station.\n4: THAT EACH OF US INVESTS THE LABOR\nIt\u2019s not that Amir and Mani stay angry a whole year and a half. Something that dire would\u2019ve spurred Amir to action, forced him to have the trembly, awkward conversation that showed them the way back to exchanges of essay clippings and meandering debates and maybe even limb-jumble lie-downs after a gigantic dinner cooked together.\nThey are not angry: they are too intelligent for anger, Amir thinks, or too proud. They\u2019re just hardened to each other. Their words bounce, too few absorbing. Their lunches together have one too many silences that call for a new conversation thread, and when congratulations are due\u2014as when the first wing is drone-dropped into place at Martyrs\u2019 Square and measurements show promising vapor transfer into the condensation bays at the base\u2014their hugs are guarded and bodiless.\nThe Wet City project hits miraculously few snags, but once or twice Amir catches a design flaw that makes Mani give him a deep, reckoning look.\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing some calculations in Impulse,\u201d Amir says. \u201cThe Beirut-3 east wing might not come out inwardly reflective the way we want, with the new bug-in-amber angled like that?\u201d Bug-in-amber is their shorthand for the art pieces they\u2019ll embed in each translucent wing, one of Amir\u2019s favorite streams of the project. He taps across his calculations.\n\u201cWhizkid,\u201d is all Mani says, and Amir almost asks if she wants to grab dinner with him after work. He doesn\u2019t. He gets better at finding flaws, though. There are times when flaws are all he sees.\nPost-water-crisis Beirut is mesmerizing, boisterous street markets by day and elaborate street parties by night.\nAmir and Joud meet every couple of weeks to trawl the artisans\u2019 quarter in Nouveau Centre-Ville, Amir on the lookout for sustainable art references for the much larger bug-in-amber pieces to come, Joud hoping to enrich their collection of silk and brocade Lebanese abayas. They are especially taken by androgynous styles that combine an embroidered abaya tunic with a shirwal bottom. They stroke the parchment packets, their fingers lingering on the teardrop calligraphy of the artisan\u2019s sigil. The two of them often return to Amir\u2019s apartment with towering ice cream cones, and Joud tells him what they\u2019ve learned about tonight\u2019s artisan on Impulse, and they have the sort of voracious, aching sex that comes after absence.\n\u201cHow is Mani?\u201d Joud asks tonight, nestled against the hollow of Amir\u2019s chest. Joud frequently asks about Mani. They know, but their affection for Amir is so confident, so stable, that the question can come right after intimacy and carry no trace of malice or envy.\n\u201cToday she proposed a walkway up the side of the sea-facing wings for a view of the sunset,\u201d Amir says. \u201cAnd yesterday she gave a site tour to a delegation that arrived two days early from Singapore.\u201d\nJoud hums in appreciation. They always do. Joud loves expansively, navigating a multitude of relationships with a grace and wholeheartedness that makes Amir feel he\u2019s never absorbed a moment of personal growth.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to indulge me, you know,\u201d Amir says. He presses three fingertips against the place where Joud\u2019s temple meets soft brown hair, scratches them there tenderly. \u201cYou and I have been in each other\u2019s lives two years and I\u2019ve never been\u2014I mean, Mani\u2019s always been\u2014\u201d\nJoud stills his lips with their cheek. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me, darling. What I figure is some people stand beside each other, and some people end up locked together,\u201d Joud laces their own hands tight, to the knuckles. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the latter is better.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, love,\u201d Amir says to Joud, who smells like green branches and clay and sex. In that moment the appellation feels miraculous and genuine on his tongue. \u201cIn many ways it\u2019s worse.\u201d\nThere are times when hitting the forecasted Wet City launch date seems like a pipe dream, but as more and more pieces slot into place, it starts to become attainable, and then an unavoidable reality. Twenty hyper-efficient months after Hanne\u2019s distracted aside in the conservatory, the first wings come online; the engineers begin their final stress tests; the notion of a citywide festival around the launch begins to coalesce. And then, with three and a half months to the launch date, Mesilla calls Amir into her office.\nTwo of their artists won\u2019t have their bugs-in-amber finished by the festival and Amir\u2019s been heading up the effort to ensure their temporary prototypes are materially similar enough for the engineers to work with; he assumes this is what Mesilla wants to talk about. Instead he\u2019s greeted by a stranger. \u201cAmir,\u201d Mesilla says, \u201cI wanted you to meet one of my oldest colleagues: Adah Bertonneau.\u201d\nAdah Bertonneau is even taller than Amir, with impressive cheekbones and two-hand-clasp handshake. \u201cA pleasure to finally meet you,\u201d Adah says, their accent a rich, rolling thing Amir can\u2019t quite place.\nAmir smiles, puzzled. \u201cFinally?\u201d\n\u201cRead your Crowdgrow grant application five years ago now,\u201d says Adah. \u201cTold myself I\u2019d make Mesilla introduce us if I ever made it to this part of the globe. And here I am.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Amir resists the inclination to try to look up Adah on Impulse\u2014he\u2019s still not very good at interfacing with it discreetly. \u201cWell, unfortunately, we haven\u2019t had the opportunity to prove out the research, but I hope that one day\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMx Tarabi,\u201d interrupts Adah. \u201cThat is, of course, precisely why I\u2019m here to talk to you.\u201d\nAdah Bertonneau, it turns out, works at the Nantes Center for Naturalist Studies. The Center is neither large nor prestigious (Amir gives up and looks it up on Impulse), but their work seems well-respected enough, and a few of their recent papers have appeared in journals Amir would have once given his eyeteeth to be published in. Adah\u2019s lab is new, getting off the ground with an extremely generous grant from France Centrale, and it seems, more or less, that they\u2019re looking for ways to spend it.\n\u201cOne must make a splash early,\u201d says Adah, peering at Amir seriously over the rim of their teacup. \u201cWe\u2019re frontloading, trying to get several programs up and running right out the door. Not all of them will work out in the long term, of course, but I\u2019d guarantee funding for the full two-year period you requested, regardless of the findings. Between you and me, though? I have this . . . call it a premonition, that what you\u2019ve proposed is going to work.\u201d\nOf course it\u2019s a dream come true. And of course the timing couldn\u2019t be worse.\n\u201cI wish I could tell you to take your time making a decision,\u201d continues Adah, \u201cbut the start date\u2019s in a month, and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not flexible.\u201d They want to do the study with a particular crawler vine, Adah explains, whose cuttings are most viable in the fall. One week, and they\u2019ll need a yes or no, \u201celse there won\u2019t be enough time to get the paperwork in order, you understand.\u201d Amir understands. Hands are shaken. Mesilla walks Amir out.\n\u201cTake the rest of the day,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2014well, I don\u2019t know whether to say I\u2019m sorry or congratulations. I know it\u2019s a lot at once.\u201d\nAmir very nearly just asks her to tell him what to do, but she seems to read this on his face. \u201cWe can talk it over tomorrow, if you need. But sleep on it. Before you start cataloging opinions.\u201d\nAmir nods. It\u2019s smart. Mesilla\u2019s always smart. He goes to his office, gathers his things, does his best to slip out unnoticed.\nExcept he runs into Mani waiting for the elevator.\n\u201cHey,\u201d she says, smiling a little awkwardly, that try-hard friendliness. Then she spots his messenger bag. \u201cHeaded out?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not even ten in the morning. Amir hits the down button again\u2014the Grid\u2019s elevators are vintage, which is a cute way of saying unbearably slow. The doors are mirrored; Amir read somewhere that mirroring elevator doors reduced complaints about wait times, because people got carried away admiring themselves. He wonders if it\u2019s true. He hopes it\u2019s not. He thinks it probably is.\n\u201cMani,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m quitting.\u201d\nMani\u2019s reflection stares at him.\nThe doors bing open.\nAmir steps into the elevator; Mani takes an extra second to step in after him.\n\u201cExplain,\u201d Mani says. \u201cNow? Are you serious?\u201d\nAmir is serious. He only knew it as he said the words aloud. \u201cSkive off today?\u201d he asks Mani, pretending he doesn\u2019t hear the note of pleading in his own voice. \u201cI could really use a drink.\u201d\nThey end up going back to his. They take the bullet train in silence\u2014it\u2019s mostly empty at this odd hour of the morning, but the tunnel-rush of wind makes holding a conversation difficult. The ride\u2019s only five minutes, but it\u2019s long enough to put Amir on edge. He stares down at his interlaced fingers, bracketed by his knees. There\u2019s an empty seat between him and Mani, because there was space to spread out, and why would they not? After all, these days, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re\u2014well. It\u2019s barely like they\u2019re friends.\nMani has never been to Amir\u2019s apartment. He realizes this as he keys into the front door; they\u2019ve tried, a few times, vague agreements about dinner that fell through at the last moment, meetings that wound up getting moved to workspaces with excuses of better bullet access. It should make him nervous, he thinks. He should be worrying about the fact that none of his coffee mugs match, or whether he left toothpaste flecks on the bathroom mirror that morning. But he isn\u2019t nervous. Mani knows all the worst parts of him already.\nThe Bekaa Valley Merlot is still at the back of the cupboard, because Amir\u2019s life is a joke. He uncorks it and pours them both generous glasses, and settles himself next to her at the small kitchen table. \u201cThere\u2019s a research institute in Nantes,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to fund a Crowdgrow roll-out.\u201d\nMani looks stunned, just for a second, then raises her wineglass. \u201cThis is now a toast,\u201d she says. \u201cTo the long overdue recognition of my brilliant friend Amir Tarabi.\u201d\nAmir tilts his glass toward hers. \u201cThing is,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019d have to start basically immediately. A few weeks. I wouldn\u2019t be here to close out Wet City. I wouldn\u2019t be able to make the launch festival.\u201d\n\u201c . . . oh,\u201d says Mani. She lowers her glass. \u201cDamn.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Amir lowers his glass, too. He\u2019s not quite sure how to look at Mani, so he focuses on the wineglass, turning it in careful circles, watching the light refract. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll need to pass some stuff off sort of hastily, but let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m no longer really essential personnel. And I don\u2019t care about the festival. It\u2019s just . . . \u201d\nAmir stops, looks up. He doesn\u2019t know how to read Mani\u2019s expression. Complicated, sad. A little like how she looks when she\u2019s working her way through a thorny problem. She reaches forward, finding his fingers with her own, carefully unlacing them from the stem of the wineglass. She holds his hand there in the warm cradle of her palms, running her thumb in a discovering sort of way across the ridgeline below his knuckles, as if she were going to read his fortune.\n\u201cIt would have been nice,\u201d says Mani, \u201cto have had more time.\u201d\n\u201cMani,\u201d says Amir, helplessly. She looks up, looks at him. He feels on display, as if she\u2019s taking inventory of him, all the things that are different, all the things that are the same. He swallows. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d he says.\nMani reaches up, running her fingertips through the scruff of his beard, bracing her thumb against his cheekbone. \u201cCome here,\u201d she says. He goes, letting her guide him forward until she finds his mouth with hers, and kisses him.\nHis mind goes blank. He\u2019s a teenager again, unsure what to do with his hands. He loves her so much he thinks he might fly into a million separate parts.\nShe undresses him first, won\u2019t let him help, won\u2019t let him touch, torturous slowness as she undoes every button, every hook. She runs her fingertips over all the planes and angles of him, presses teasing thumbs into the hollows by his hipbones and kisses him until he feels drunk with it. Then she lets him do the same to her, and she takes his hands and shows him where to touch, and he thinks this might be the most beautiful thing he\u2019s ever done.\nAfterward, they lie tangled together, exhausted, belly-to-flank, Amir\u2019s cheek pressed against the top of Mani\u2019s head. The warm reality of her, the slow swell-and-recede of her body against his, is almost too much to stand.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d Amir says. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you so much. It wasn\u2019t enough time.\u201d\nHe feels her pause, then twist to look at him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that, earlier,\u201d she says, very serious. \u201cWe can\u2019t think that way. We have to say to ourselves, this was right. This was exactly enough.\u201d\nAmir shuts his eyes, tips his head forward to rest against hers, and tries to believe it.\nHe keeps his eyes closed until they both fall asleep.\n5: THE BEAM COMES ON, ILLUMINATING US ALL\nAmir arrives in France just after dawn on a foggy fall day. His out-breaths add frills of fog to Nantes\u2019 thick cloak of it. He keeps his Impulse off after landing. Sounds muffled, skin damp, his first impression of his new home is of being underwater.\nHe explores the city on foot, stopping for croissants then brioches then tartines. At sunset, he sits on the lawn of the Ch\u00e2teau des Ducs de Bretagne and tosses a bag of soy chips to two mallards and their ducklings paddling in the castle\u2019s moat. Impulse would help him form a mental map, but he knows if he turns it on he\u2019s going to look for a message from Mani, and if there\u2019s none he\u2019s going to be heartsick. And if there is one he\u2019s going to be heartsick.\nThree things cycle through Amir\u2019s mind: first, how to make the most of this opportunity; second, how desperately he needs to recenter himself in personal growth practice; third, the problem he\u2019s had for most of his life, which is that he can\u2019t stop thinking about Mani.\nAmir wakes up with the sun on his first morning in his Nantes apartment and he takes creaking steps that raise dust motes along the woodgrain floorboards. At the window he turns Impulse on and his heart rattles the split-second before his unreads appear.\nNothing from Mani.\nAmir starts to compose a message. \u201cHi! Nantes is beautiful. There\u2019s a duckling in the castle moat who has learned to swim alongside\u2014\u201d then he closes his eyes, hard, and deletes. When he opens them the weathervane across from his window has flipped 180 degrees and the sun is a blur of honey.\nThe Crowdgrow pilot takes place along two residential streets in Nantes-2, just north of the Gare de Nantes. Amir hand-delivers cuttings of ecoboosted crawler vine to each of the experiment\u2019s participants.\n\u201cJe vous attends toute la matin\u00e9e,\u201d says one girl when Amir puts the little red planter pot in her hands. Her tight cornrows have been braided into an orchid-shaped bun on top of her head. She takes him round to the back garden, shows him the sheltered hole in the soil she\u2019s dug. There is so much care in her actions that Amir\u2019s belief in\u2014dedication to\u2014Crowdgrow redoubles just like that.\n\u201cMes mamans disent que le ciel sera plein d\u2019oiseaux,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Amir replies through Impulse. \u201cAs many birds as the sky can handle.\u201d\nNantes is on a clean air travel vector with Beirut, so Joud comes to visit the week before Amir presents the results of the pilot to a delegation from Nantes\u2019 municipality. They go to Nantes\u2019 shipyard island, go on mech-AI safari. They feed the giant hydraulic elephants from a tray of silicon peanuts, and the elephants regurgitate silicon caricatures of Amir and Joud. Joud\u2019s is great: an impossibly vertical cone of hair, small ears rendered as notches. Amir\u2019s own caricature makes him feel every year as old as his thirty-two, and older.\nHe wraps their portraits up and tucks them in his bag, presses Joud close. Arm in arm, they survey nearby menus on Impulse until Amir finds one that does a much-lauded synth-protein steak with cassava frites. They wash it down with crisp, sweet Breton cider.\n\u201cTo new avenues,\u201d Joud says.\n\u201cTo the companions who walk our lives with us,\u201d Amir says. The words are from a passage Mani once clipped from a poem. He clinks the neck of his bottle against Joud\u2019s.\nThe first results come back from Crowdgrow in Nantes-2. The air quality in that sector has improved a modest part per billion, but what\u2019s really encouraging is that all the crawler vines have survived. Many have gained a meter or more in length. The pilot expands to a citywide project, Adah\u2019s grant money matched by government funds.\nAmir comes home late one evening from overseeing a plant-in at a primary school, a little dazed from hours of sun and excitable schoolchildren, but in good spirits. He\u2019s dirt all over, ground into the new callouses on his palms and spilling from the hems of his trousers. The soil here is still toxic, and he should probably wash it off before doing anything else, but his diminutive wrought-iron balcony gets an excellent view of the sunset, and he can\u2019t help but peel off his shoes and socks and sit down at the wooden folding table to watch it. The last flash of sunlight is winking out on the windows of the Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre et Saint-Paul when his Impulse pings with a call from Mani.\nHe answers without thinking\u2014or, he answers before he can let himself think about it. \u201cMani?\u201d he says, a question, like it could be anyone else.\n\u201cHi,\u201d says definitely-Mani. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFree,\u201d says Amir, straightening a little, though she hasn\u2019t initiated holo. \u201cI mean, I just got home from work. I was just\u2014\u201d He stumbles. Watching the sunset feels too corny. \u201cRelaxing,\u201d he finishes.\n\u201cGood,\u201d says Mani. \u201cI saw on the Beirut Grid announcement stream that your project won that funding extension from the city. Wanted to say congratulations. So, well.\u201d She laughs a little. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\nAmir sinks back into his chair. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cYou too. I watched your speech at the launch ceremony. It was really beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d says Mani. \u201cI read your message to the team.\u201d\nHe\u2019d figured she had, even when she didn\u2019t respond. He\u2019s not sure what to say to this.\n\u201cYou should have been there,\u201d Mani says.\nThe morning of the Wet City launch festival in Beirut, they\u2019d gotten the first full bloom on a crawler vine in Nantes-2, a pale blue flower veined with green, nearly the size of Amir\u2019s head. The stem wasn\u2019t robust yet; the smallest breeze set the blossom trembling, like any moment it would come free and drop to the earth. Amir had spent most of the morning crouched in the dewy garden, waiting to see if it would last. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you,\u201d says Amir, \u201cbut you were fine without me.\u201d\nThe connection goes so silent Amir has to check Impulse for the activity blip.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been harder,\u201d says Mani, \u201cthan I thought it would be.\u201d\nAmir closes his eyes. He wants to say: I would come back if you asked me to. He wants to say: I wouldn\u2019t have left in the first place. Instead he says, \u201cMani.\u201d\n\u201cI love you,\u201d says Mani. \u201cEven if we never quite figure out what that should look like. You know that, right?\u201d\nThe breeze is sharpening with night, carrying scents of yeast and toffee from the bakery on street level. The latticework of the metal balcony presses geometry into the soles of Amir\u2019s feet. He can hear the soft hush of Mani\u2019s breath, in and out.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Amir. \u201cI know.\u201d\nOver the next seven years, Nantes becomes a garden city. Every green space is verdant with ecoboosted flora from Amir\u2019s program; parks and groves are remade from concrete lots and musky alleys. The skies, as one little girl had once hoped, are full of birds.\nAmir spends one of those years working with his team on tweaks to the Crowdgrow flora to ensure the boosted species are hospitable to native ones, and that summer there are small populations of roe deer, and bushes of garden aster, and swallows, and a sighting of a pair of endangered partridges on the steps of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Graslin.\nMani stays in Beirut after Wet City launches, takes up a just-formed position as Beirut\u2019s Minister for Enrichment. Amir pieces together through her understatements and Impulse research that this means she oversees almost every program in Beirut that impacts quality of life\u2014standards for natural lighting in modular housing, breeding programs for Mediterranean loggerheads, the national poetry curriculum. He\u2019s immensely proud and touched.\nAmir thinks about surprising Mani in Beirut for her thirty-sixth birthday; he\u2019s been back home twice while Mani was away on diplomatic visits, just bad luck. He asks circumspect questions to make sure she\u2019ll be in town, buys a ticket. The day before the flight he gets scary news: one of the Crowdgrow fern populations has been proliferating invasively, has killed off a native garden. Amir gets on a bullet to Nantes-11 and he\u2019s so nervous about the clean-up operation he doesn\u2019t see the inside of his apartment for three days.\nThey control the fern; he misses his chance to visit Mani.\nTime goes so quickly those years. But he spends more evenings sitting on his balcony watching the sunset than not.\nIt\u2019s Adah who brings Amir the news personally: they\u2019ve received an application to start a Crowdgrow program in Beirut.\nIt\u2019ll be the seventeenth spin-off of the original Nantes pilot\u2014the first three Amir went to oversee himself, spending months in Bruges, Liverpool, Alexandria. After that, they\u2019d developed a formula, easy for new cities to follow with only a few weeks\u2019 oversight from Amir\u2019s staff.\n\u201cIt\u2019s below your pay grade,\u201d says Adah. \u201cBut I thought you might want to take this one on yourself. Chance to catch up with old friends. But we\u2019ll send someone else if you\u2019re too busy.\u201d\nAmir is definitely too busy. \u201cDon\u2019t send anyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d love to go.\u201d\nAmir calls Mani that afternoon as he\u2019s walking home from work, feeling like something in him\u2019s unfurling in the late autumn sun. \u201cI hear someone in Beirut ordered some mutant daisies,\u201d he says the moment she picks up.\n\u201cSmug,\u201d Mani says. \u201cI was so pleased when the proposal came through.\u201d\n\u201cMe too. And, um. Adah asked if I wanted to come do the kickoff myself.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\nAmir huffs. \u201cI said yes, obviously! What do you think?\u201d He scruffs his knuckles over the stubble on his jawline, tries to keep his voice casual.\n\u201cI\u2019ll clear my calendar,\u201d Mani says.\nAmir\u2019s Impulse pings with an unread as his plane begins to descend into Beirut. Joud. Meet at the rock wharf by al-Raouch\u00e9, bring a warm coat.\nIt\u2019s five AM and Amir\u2019s had no sleep. He\u2019s really getting too old for no sleep. But the trembly adrenaline of night flights and home is a jolt in his chest, so he goes, his luggage tracking him at a polite distance.\nThe wind is insistent and briny. Amir seals his coat to his chin. There\u2019s a huge crowd at the wharf, and food kiosks, and banners, a bunch of institutional logos he doesn\u2019t recognize, and one he does\u2014Beirut Grid\u2019s.\nJoud finds him where he\u2019s paused at a corniche railing trying to work out the reason for the commotion. He hasn\u2019t seen Joud in two years, not since Joud moved into a rundown mountain house in Ehden with three partners and their five little ones to begin hand-renovating the house to ecopositive standards.\nThey look great. Sun-hardened, their hair a wiry nest of salt and pepper, clipped a little closer than Amir remembers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a team from Beirut Grid here,\u201d Joud says when they hug. \u201cAnd a couple of my kids. I want you to meet them. Leave the luggage, come.\u201d\nJoud leads Amir into the wharf and onto the rocks beyond, where adults and children are queued up to use what look like fishing poles. There\u2019s a din of excitement and an occasional whoop of triumph.\nAmir is stunned. \u201cAre they fishing?\u201d\nJoud laughs, just as three little humans run into their arms shouting, \u201cWe fed one!\u201d\n\u201cShow Amir,\u201d Joud says, and a kid with the same shy grin as their parent holds out a glossy pellet cradled in their palm.\n\u201cVitamin feed to correct an imbalance in the ecosystem,\u201d says Joud. \u201cIt\u2019s civic engagement, a bit of publicity. There\u2019s a water-soluble version they\u2019ll pump in after.\u201d\n\u201cJoud?\u201d asks the smallest child. \u201cAre they going to come live with us?\u201d They glance at Amir. \u201cWe have enough water for them to do a mineral soak once a week too.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s welcome to come live with us,\u201d Joud says, and Amir forces himself not to look away from the softness on Joud\u2019s face.\n\u201cAmir Tarabi! Of all the fish-feeding parties in all the towns . . . \u201d says someone behind him. He turns around to see Mesilla carrying a pail, and behind her Hanne and Caveg.\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Amir says, and gathers them into a hug. \u201cI just got off the plane from France. How . . . \u201d\n\u201cMaybe not totally a coincidence.\u201d Joud winks at him. \u201cI thought Mani would be here too. But her assistant told me she\u2019s working a short day today, had to wrap things up at the ministry.\u201d\nHanne cracks a joke about Amir still overthinking everything, except now in French, and it\u2019s one of those moments younger Amir wouldn\u2019t have believed in: like the universe has turned its spotlight on him, for a fleeting instant, and instructed him to rest.\nEventually, the trajectory of the future will look like this: some years, Amir in Beirut, guest lecturing at Pan-Humanist Polytechnic, consulting on the new ecoboosted installation in Zahleh, taking a sabbatical to work on a collection of essays about crowdsourcing civic change. Some of those years, Mani in Beirut too, but others, Mani in the Arctic, Mani back in Mogadishu, Mani on the Gulf Coast. Once, eighteen glorious months both in Beirut, a routine of dinner parties at Mani\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s loft apartment, and stargazing every third weekend during Beirut\u2019s Dark Skies nights: picnic blankets and wine, Amir\u2019s head in Mani\u2019s lap, Mani\u2019s fingers in his hair. Once, ten long years where the vagaries of circumstance mean they don\u2019t manage to see each other at all.\nEventually, all the days in a human life, whether or not they feel like enough.\nBut for now, all the hard, gut-ache hope and all the pragmatics and all the inexorable decades coalesce like this: Amir steps out of a Beirut hotel two streets up from his old al-Manara apartment holding a potted Crowdgrow cutting, and points himself toward Stella Kadri Square.\nMani messages him just as he spots the showcase Wet City wings fanning out in the distance, describing the perimeter of the brand new square. Their bugs-in-amber make them into a museum of petrified art. He saw hundreds of the wings from the air and he\u2019d seen the beachfront ones from a distance on his brief visits home, but now they strike him. It\u2019s like walking toward the foot of a mountain, that same organic rightness of approaching and finding the world continuing up and out beneath his feet.\nMani sends him geo for a bench she\u2019s found. He wants to play that old game of how long has it been, but he draws every minute of personal growth he\u2019s ever done to ground himself\u2014he notes the flinty musk of impending rain, the drawn out ping of the bullet slicing across the city, the tickle in his throat from the boosted pollen of the Crowdgrow cutting. His heart, beating in his neck.\nAmir spots the bench from a distance. Mani is a blue-coated speck on one side of it. He\u2019s shy, suddenly, walking into a casual get-together with Beirut\u2019s Minister for Enrichment, walking across the grandeur of a public space he knows she conceived and oversaw to completion, a tribute to the world Mani\u2019s rallied for and railed against so passionately her whole life. Then Mani messages him a biofeedback wave, and Amir viscerally feels her excitement hum in his brain, and he\u2019s not shy anymore. He wants to be near enough to touch her so badly. He almost breaks into a run.\nBut doesn\u2019t. He gets close enough for her to hear him and shouts \u201cMani!\u201d Her peacoat\u2019s the shade of the ocean, collar drawn up. Her face is open and happy. Amir can\u2019t believe she could possibly wear that expression for him.\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re having a pretty good day,\u201d he laughs.\nShe shakes her head, gets up, and closes the distance and hugs him and her cheek is right over the brutal hammering of his heart. Amir stands as still as he can, clutching the Crowdgrow pot against Mani\u2019s back, waiting for the moment she breaks the embrace, kind of hoping that will be never.\n\u201cI brought you a cutting,\u201d Amir says.\n\u201cWelcome home,\u201d Mani mumbles. Her voice vibrates in his chest.\n\u201cTo us both,\u201d he says.\nShe turns her face up to his and puts fingers on his jaw and kisses him and doesn\u2019t stop, and Amir must really be in a kinder world because it starts to rain, raindrops that splatter open, big and clean and warm.\nSara Saab was born in Beirut, Lebanon.

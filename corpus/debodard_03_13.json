There are no words left, no message of comfort that she could give her.\nInstead, she takes Sarah\u2019s hand, holds it tight until the last of the warmth has leached from her body into her daughter\u2019s; and braces herself for the future.\nEven in the visitors\u2019 V-space, Sarah looked awful\u2014thin and wasted and so ethereal that Minh Ha wanted to take her daughter home and ply her with rich dish after rich dish to bring some fat back on her bones. But, of course, it was too late for that; had been too late ever since the much publicized arrest and the even more publicized trial, all the grandstanding that had brought a taste of bile in Minh Ha\u2019s throat.\nThe white prison garb and featureless holding room background were imposed by the Guardians, but Sarah had basic access permissions to the V-space, enough to manipulate her appearance\u2014to fill in the hollows under her eyes, color the stretched skin until the shapes of the bones receded into invisibility, and smooth out her hair until it hung once again as lustrous as polished turtle scales. Minh Ha wasn\u2019t sure if her daughter\u2019s appearance was a statement of some sort, instructions given by the leaders of the Vermilion Seal to their recruits before the police sweep-up, or if it was simply that Sarah saw no need to hide the truth from her\u2014or the depth of her contempt.\n\u201cHello, child,\u201d she said to Sarah.\nSarah frowned. \u201cSpeak Rong.\u201d\nMinh Ha shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no point. They\u2019ll understand Rong just as easily as Galactic.\u201d The machines that ran V-space were notoriously bad at Rong, a language that relied on human instinct to separate the words\u2014but interpreters were cheap, their services easily bought.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem, Mother.\u201d But Sarah didn\u2019t elaborate\u2014merely pointed to the low table that was the only feature of the V-space, a pretense of normality in a situation so far from normal it was risible. Nor did Minh Ha probe further; after all, she already knew what the answer was going to be.\n\u201cThe verdict was upheld today in the State Council,\u201d Minh Ha said, as she pulled out a chair, feeling the solidity of old wood under her fingers\u2014an illusion, perfectly woven by the machines. She\u2019d applied for an interview in physical space, but had been summarily rejected; told that the risk presented by her daughter was too great, and that they would rather have everything take place at a remove; that she could visit Sarah three times, one time for every day that separated them from the execution of the sentence. \u201cBut of course, you already knew that.\u201d\nSarah\u2019s face was perfectly still\u2014caught by the warm light from the ceiling, reminding Minh Ha so much of Charles that her heart seemed to stutter in her chest. \u201cActive Rehabilitation on Cygnus? All things considered, I got off rather light, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Her voice had the sharpness of a broken blade.\nThere was an awkward silence, only broken by Sarah\u2019s even breaths. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here,\u201d Sarah said, at last.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. You\u2019re my daughter. My only child.\u201d And Minh Ha was about to lose her, and she still couldn\u2019t express her own feelings in a way that Sarah would understand.\nIt had been publicized enough: the ship left for Cygnus, an outlying planet in Galactic space, in three days, carrying in its holds the sentenced Vermilion Seal members. Better cut out the infection at the root and expel it from society, rather than have it spread, undermining the foundations of Galactic society. It was a one-way trip\u2014the passengers drugged and stuffed into hibernation cradles, locked tight until they finally could be released and herded into the holding facilities\u2014staring at the mercilessly sharp horizon and the cracked fields that would be the boundary of their world until death.\nAt least it wasn\u2019t an execution. At least it wasn\u2019t Moc Tinh Hau\u2014but of course the planet of Minh Ha\u2019s birth had been sealed off from interstellar traffic, for fear that the war that had engulfed it would spread to other, more \u201c civilized\u201d parts of the universe.\nSarah exhaled, noisily. \u201cFine time to show your support, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nMinh Ha found her hands clenching in her lap. \u201cI don\u2019t stand by any of what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\nSarah smiled\u2014sharp and bitter. \u201cOf course not. I should have known.\u201d\n\u201cWe taught you otherwise,\u201d Minh Ha said, all the anger she\u2019d hoarded during the trial irrepressibly bubbling up; all the smiling and keeping silent while Charles all but accused her of corrupting their daughter, of failing to teach her the proper Galactic values that would have prevented that needless tragedy. \u201cHow to care for a tree when you\u2019ve eaten its fruit; how to remember the man who dug a well when you\u2019ve drunk its water. Segundus is your home. Why did you need to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you want me to do? To keep my head down and accept it all? To lie to myself, over and over, until the lie became reality? I had to do it,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cHad to make the truth known.\u201d\nThe truth. The absolute that the younger generation found and clung to like lifelines; as if it could protect them. The truth hadn\u2019t prevented the Eastern continent\u2019s war-kites from laying waste to the delta; hadn\u2019t brought harvested rice into the besieged cities; hadn\u2019t even been able to save Xuan Huong, in the end. \u201cThere is no truth,\u201d Minh Ha said.\nSarah was silent for a while, staring at the wood of the table as if she saw something within, some mysterious message that Minh Ha couldn\u2019t make sense of. At last, she said, raising her gaze, \u201cYou saw the war, didn\u2019t you? I thought you\u2019d understand\u2014I thought you\u2019d want our stories to be worth something, too\u2014\u201d And, in that moment, she was no longer the hardened criminal of the news feeds, or the angry young woman of Charles\u2019 imagination, but simply the child Minh Ha had raised\u2014the round-faced daughter who\u2019d come home after being stung by a bee, and who\u2019d looked up at her mother, confident that Minh Ha would know how to make the pain go away. In that moment, Minh Ha\u2019s heart, patched and glued together from so many shards of childhood, broke yet again.\nThere\u2019s a moment which comes every time Minh Ha enters the Hall of the Dead: a single, agonizing moment of hope when she sees the streets before the bombs extinguished the lanterns hanging in the trees\u2014when she sees Mother and the aunts exactly as she remembers them, their faces creased like crumpled paper\u2014when she hears them say, \u201cCome to us, child,\u201d in Rong, just as they once did, when handing her the red envelopes of the New Year celebration.\nIt never lasts.\nThe filters always kick in; always change and blur everything\u2014always turn the V-space of the city into a labyrinth of featureless, drenched buildings, and the Dead into . . . something else, something alien and utterly incomprehensible. Mother and the aunts flicker and blur, too, and change\u2014their skin taking on a metallic sheen, their words melding and merging until they become altogether meaningless.\nIt\u2019s for her own safety, she knows\u2014for her own sanity, so that she is not contaminated by the twisted and ineffable brain patterns that have been preserved by the Hall, a crazed and blurred memory of what it means to be alive. She knows; but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier to bear.\nThere are eight of the Dead: Mother and three of her sisters, and four more distant cousins who escaped with them. They were all young when they died\u2014too young. Like all of the generation that had fled the Western continent of Moc Tinh Hau before the fall of Xuan Huong, they dwindled away on Segundus. Perhaps it was the stress of living through the first, most bitterly intense years of the war, scraping themselves to the bone to help their families escape from the gathering storm; or perhaps merely the pain of exile, but for some reason their roots never dug deep into Galactic soil. Minh Ha was but seven when they fled, and Moc Tinh Hau is a confused jumble of memories\u2014 all of it quite forgotten as she grew up, papered over until Sarah\u2019s acts dragged it out again, in all its exquisite pain.\nUntil she finds herself, here, now, standing before the Dead; and looking for comfort where there is none.\nOn her way home, Minh Ha\u2019s shuttle passed by the Memorial.\nIt was open, though surrounded by a horde of Galactic policemen: the queue of visitors was dwarfed by the gleam of exoskeletons and battle armor, by the metallic sheen of huge cars which uncomfortably reminded Minh Ha of the Eastern continent\u2019s linked-machines on Moc Tinh Hau, and the sharp thuds of bombs dropping over the river delta in the hours before New Year\u2019s Eve\u2014when the entire Western continent had been welcoming their families home for the feast.\n\u201cSee? I told you they\u2019d have fixed it,\u201d a woman said beside Minh Ha.\nMinh Ha, startled, turned away from her contemplation of the dome; but the woman had been talking to someone else: a small and slight redhead with freckles whose hands were wrapped around a small leather case. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure\u2014\u201d the redhead paused then, nervously fidgeting.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have stayed home,\u201d the older woman said. She snorted. \u201cOn this day of all days\u2014his thirty-year anniversary. Come on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Her gaze lingered for a moment on Minh Ha, and her face twisted. \u201cThe Rong vermin won\u2019t prevent us from honoring our war heroes.\u201d\nMinh Ha, shocked,\u2014it had been many years since anyone had made disparaging comments to her face\u2014opened her mouth to say something, but the shuttle had already stopped, and the women had got off. She had no doubt they would join the queue of Galactics in front of the Memorial. The leather case the girl had been holding was familiar to Minh Ha: it held a V-space offerings chip, probably a wreath of flowers or a commemorative stele to lay in the streets of the reconstituted Xuan Huong\u2014paying homage to a Galactic ancestor who\u2019d died there, helping the Western continent fight for its freedom.\nMinh Ha could hear Sarah\u2019s voice in her head as clearly as if her daughter were sitting by her side. What wonderful stories they tell themselves. What convincing lies.\nIt didn\u2019t matter. That was what her daughter didn\u2019t understand. There was no coming back to Moc Tinh Hau; no return home to the tombs of their ancestors. Segundus was their home and would be their final resting place; and they couldn\u2019t afford to antagonize the people among whom they lived.\nToo late, Sarah\u2019s voice whispered in Minh Ha\u2019s mind; and Minh Ha turned her face back to the receding shape of the Memorial, trying to think about something other than her daughter and the Vermilion Seal\u2014but the gleam of metal from the policemen\u2019s armor didn\u2019t recede from her field of vision for the longest time.\nThe Dead are to be broached with caution. Patterns saved on the edge of brain failure are no longer those of the living, but strangely corrupted things, belonging to one world and to the next; indistinct whispers, ghost images, and worse\u2014self-replicating patterns that can utterly alter the shape of a mind.\nThe Dead, in other words, are a virus\u2014skewed code that uses tactile contact in V-space to propagate itself; and to infect the brain patterns of the living. Those touched by the Dead become changed, unfit for Galactic society\u2014speaking in barbaric tongues; sinking into despondence and instability; following visions all the way into mad fits, which render them dangerous to public safety.\nIn the past year, there have been 2319 instances of filters failing across the 79731 Halls of the Dead on Segundus, out of which 227 resulted in tactile contact\u2014a tendency that is on the decrease thanks to better prevention at Preservation Office level. In most cases, contact is brief; and the afflicted are detected early enough to prevent further complications.\nSome, of course, are not so lucky; that is why every Hall of the Dead works in close tandem with appropriate institutions, where the hopelessly corrupted can be prevented from harming themselves and others.\nOn her second visit, Minh Ha found Sarah on the floor of the V-space room, which had subtly changed. A section of it, walled behind glass, now showed the inside of the Memorial: the wide streets of the reconstituted Xuan Huong, the sky dotted with the glimmer of orbitals, the women carrying shoulder yokes with two baskets of fruit balanced on either end, the Galactics walking side by side with the Rong, smiling and laughing.\nIt was very clearly the original Memorial, not the hack the Vermilion Seal had succeeded in imposing for a few hours before security kicked in: the Galactics were still prominently there, haggling in their own language with meat sellers at the market; and the heads of whole fish glared at them from the trestle tables. It was . . . all there, and still somehow not there, every detail papered over with the Galactic gaze, the shoulder yokes as exotic curiosities, the fish heads monstrous and vacant instead of promising a meal fresh from the sea, the Galactics blending in the population instead of behaving like condescending masters.\nSarah sat with her legs crossed, staring at it as though she could erase it from existence altogether. She didn\u2019t rise when Minh Ha materialized within the V-space, didn\u2019t turn her head. \u201cMother. Just in time for the daily education session.\u201d You could have sawed bones with the edge in her voice.\n\u201cAre you . . . always there?\u201d It hadn\u2019t occurred to Minh Ha that the V-space could be more than visitors\u2019 quarters; that it would be used for other purposes. But of course every tool could be turned to several uses.\nSarah shrugged. She gestured for Minh Ha to sit by her side, which Minh Ha did, feeling the illusory coolness of the floor under her. \u201cSometimes, when it suits them. They\u2019re preparing us for the journey, in many ways.\u201d She had marks on her wrists and on her lower arms\u2014little pricks like dozens of syringe injections.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound as though it matters much to you one way or the other,\u201d Minh Ha said, bitterly.\n\u201cShould it?\u201d Sarah looked up. Her eyes were dark pits in the awful paleness of her face. \u201cI\u2019ve done what matters.\u201d She gestured to the Memorial in front of her. \u201cThey\u2019ve fixed it, but everyone remembers that it could be another way.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d Minh Ha fought a rising wave of anger\u2014remembering the two women on the shuttle. \u201cYou had a moment of fame on the feeds, and that was swiftly forgotten. The Memorial is still as it always was.\u201d As it always had been\u2014a thing which didn\u2019t concern Rong, which wasn\u2019t for them. It was the work of a Galactic man; it wept for the Galactic fallen; for the slaughter of innocents, but it knew nothing about the war. It acknowledged nothing about the Galactic domination and meddling that had exacerbated regional differences between the Western and Eastern continent\u2014leading to a bloody civil war after independence; and to the desperate, last-ditch effort by the Galactics to maintain their foothold on Moc Tinh Hau with the Western continent as their puppet state. \u201cHow could you think this would be worth your life?\u201d\n\u201cNot my life, you forget.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live and die on a forgotten planet\u2014it\u2019s the same as if they\u2019d executed you!\u201d Minh Ha couldn\u2019t control the anger, the anguish anymore. Three interviews\u2014enough to count them one by one, to know that each of them brought her closer to the final goodbye.\n\u201cYou forget.\u201d Sarah\u2019s smile was bright, cutting. \u201cThey\u2019re merciful.\u201d\n\u201cYou should have kept your head down,\u201d Minh Ha said. \u201cNow all the Rong are tarred with what the Vermilion Seal did.\u201d\n\u201cKeep my head down? As your generation have done all your life? I won\u2019t be silenced, Mother.\u201d\nHow could she\u2014? \u201cYou tell me I\u2019ve seen the war, that I ought to know. I know about grit being sold as rice in the markets, about bombs that shattered the lanterns in the streets\u2014about the ancestral altar growing every few months with new pictures, about how you\u2019d have done anything\u2014anything, as long as it got you out of Moc Tinh Hau. We were on Segundus on sufferance\u2014because they took pity on us. The last thing we wanted was to draw attention to us\u2014to be sent back there!\u201d\nSarah grimaced, but said nothing.\nThe view in front of them had shifted to a temple, lingering on the gong and the drum on either side of the entrance, and the flow of Rong coming to make their own offerings. The wooden statues in the darkness were smiling, enigmatic and distant, so distorted Minh Ha had to guess at their identities\u2014was the woman in flowing robes Bodhisattva Quan Am, was the man armed with a Galactic axe general Quan Vu?\nTwo days left. One further interview; and then that was all. How could she\u2014? Minh Ha took a deep breath, keeping her eyes away from the Memorial\u2019s reconstitution. She forced herself to speak calmly, leisurely, as if nothing were wrong; even though the emptiness in her stomach gnawed at her. \u201cSegundus is your home. It\u2019s easy to criticize what the Galactic government has done, but don\u2019t forget that they allowed you to grow up in peace\u2014to be in a position to speak up now.\u201d No one knew what was happening on Moc Tinh Hau now, but there was no reason to think life had gone better\u2014that the Hell Minh Ha remembered from her childhood had vanished altogether.\n\u201cYou\u2019d think speaking up would be less fraught.\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice was full of mordant amusement. \u201cBut there are truths that can\u2019t be spoken out, apparently, or they become terrorism, eroding away at the foundation of the nation.\u201d\n\u201cI saw what you did in the Memorial,\u201d Minh Ha said. \u201cThe city that you brought to life \u2018from the point of view of the Rong.\u2019 That\u2019s not truth\u2014none of you lived in Xuan Huong, or on the Western continent. None of you remember the war. Moc Tinh Hau is just a story to you, no different than it was to the Galactic who built the Memorial.\u201d It wasn\u2019t true, not quite\u2014of course Moc Tinh Hau was the home of Sarah\u2019s ancestors, of course it would remain a special place, more special to her than to Steven Carey, who had interviewed so many Rong yet failed to capture the essence of their lives in his Memorial. But she had to make her understand.\nSarah shrugged. \u201cDo you think to make me recant, Mother?\u201d She gestured at the Memorial behind its pane of glass. \u201cAs they do?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to understand that this is how we live together, child. The Galactics did what they did on Moc Tinh Hau\u2014\u201d she saw Sarah raise a hand in protest, and cut in before Sarah could say anything\u2014 \u201cbut if you never forget grievances, then they\u2019ll choke you like ivy. The Memorial isn\u2019t for us, no matter what they say; and it\u2019s enough that we know that.\u201d It was enough not to make waves; not to make themselves noticed; to live in harmony with the Galactics in their new home on Segundus.\n\u201cWhy are you here, Mother?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re my child. Because I raised you.\u201d Because I\u2019ll lose you. Because, somehow, she wanted to give Sarah something to take to Cygnus, to remember her by; and she couldn\u2019t articulate what.\nSarah turned, and looked at her full in the eye; as a Galactic would have done. Her face was set. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, and didn\u2019t sound sorry in the least. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your choices, Mother. I made mine.\u201d\nThe Dead watch Minh Ha, impassive. Their faces shift, oddly, weirdly, into some expressions a human face can\u2019t take\u2014rippling between a smile and a grimace and tears. Second Aunt speaks\u2014the words came through all garbled, even as Minh Ha\u2019s filters flash a warning she can\u2019t understand either, something about compromised communication protocols and infected messages.\n\u201cI need advice.\u201d She dares not look up, but she sees Mother drift closer to her. There is a smell in the air that is almost like Mother\u2019s perfume, the faint mixture of cloves and sandalwood that followed her everywhere, even into the hospital where she breathed her last, hunched around her pain like a dragon wrapped around a pearl. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t know where to go, or who to turn to.\u201d She would weep, if she still had tears.\nThe Dead are not the living.\n\u201cShe\u2019s your only descendant,\u201d Minh Ha says, watching the familiar faces bend and distort like thin sheets of metal. \u201cAnd they\u2019re taking her away from us. From all of us. Please.\u201d\nMother speaks, but it is all nonsense that Minh Ha can\u2019t interpret\u2014no better than an unanswered prayer at the ancestral altar after all. Can she even sure that any of them understand her? Perhaps the filters distort her own speech to the Dead, just as they mangle what should have been familiar Rong words.\n\u201cYou\u2019d know what to do, I\u2019m sure. You\u2019d know how to\u2014\u201d She isn\u2019t sure what she wants\u2014to convince Sarah of how wrong she\u2019s been, to rescue her from her inevitable fate, from yet another kind of exile? \u201cMother. Revered aunts. I\u2014Please tell me what to do.\u201d\nThere is no answer. There never is any.\nGoing home, Minh Ha was stopped three times by police barricades; the last one erected just below her compound and staffed with what seemed like an entire army\u2019s worth of policemen. The leader, a beefy woman with the reddened skin of blondes, examined Minh Ha from head to toe; no doubt seeing all there was to see from the failure of her marriage to Charles to Sarah\u2019s arrest. \u201cWhere are you going, Mrs Tran?\u201d Perhaps it was Sarah\u2019s words, but today the mangling of Minh Ha\u2019s last name grated\u2014reminded her that she wasn\u2019t home anymore, that her own home had been lost so long ago it only existed in her imagination\u2014all in the past, unable to be ever truly recovered.\n\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Minh Ha said. And, because she didn\u2019t care much, anymore, about Galactics or her complex relationship with the city she now lived in, \u201cFrom the holding facility. I was visiting my daughter.\u201d\nThe leader grimaced, but Minh Ha held her ground. \u201cI have three visits.\u201d\n\u201cSo you do.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem altogether happy.\nAt home, the feedswriters appeared to have got bored; there were but a few of them, loitering at the entrance of the building, and Minh Ha easily bypassed their frantic calls for interviews and information.\nIn the apartment, she found her sister Thuy busy in the kitchen, and her niece Hanh in front of the computer, watching the feeds. \u201cHow is she, aunt?\u201d Hanh asked, but her mother Thuy cut her off.\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone waiting for you in the living room.\u201d\nMinh Ha had been expecting him, so it wasn\u2019t entirely a surprise to find Charles standing before the chimney, looking at the holos on the ancestral altar with the practiced indifference of a man who had turned his back on this particular area of his life. \u201cGood evening, Charles.\u201d Her voice had never felt so formal in addressing him. \u201cCome to see about Sarah, I guess.\u201d\nHe turned around, slowly, his face a mask; a minute tremor in his hand masking the emotion underneath. \u201cI came to see how you were. And yes, to ask about Sarah. Since it seems you\u2019re the only one she\u2019s speaking to.\u201d\nMinh Ha shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s not telling me much.\u201d\n\u201cI need to see her,\u201d Charles said. \u201cBut, of course, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s all that Vermilion Seal rubbish, telling her to reject all things Galactic. As if she weren\u2019t Galactic herself, born and bred on Segundus . . . It\u2019s all nonsense.\u201d Charles kept his voice even, but Minh Ha could hear the frustrated anger; could feel that he was going to lash out at whoever stood in his way. He hadn\u2019t always been so impatient; but years of bad financial luck had soured their relationship\u2014hardening him, even as Minh Ha became quieter and less inclined to fight him for anything.\n\u201cShe\u2019s always been headstrong,\u201d Minh Ha said, unsure of what to say. She hadn\u2019t spoken much to Charles in the years since the divorce\u2014they\u2019d gone their separate ways, he to his merchant spaceships, she to help manage the family restaurant\u2019s finances. Only Sarah\u2019s arrest and trial had brought them back into each other\u2019s life; and even then, it had been briefly and painfully, all the old grievances flaring up to life again, biting and unbearable. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised she wouldn\u2019t want to speak to you.\u201d\nPreparing us for the journey, Sarah had said\u2014how much of it was her, too, preparing herself, shedding all the attachments to Segundus, forging herself into metal hard enough that nothing on Cygnus would so much as scratch it?\n\u201cHow is she?\u201d Charles asked.\nMinh Ha thought of Sarah; pale and thin and looking half out of this world, already gone ahead. \u201cAs well as can be,\u201d she lied. \u201cConvinced that she did the right thing.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d Charles\u2019 voice was uncertain; probing into her weaknesses, exposing all her doubts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t approve of what she\u2019s done,\u201d Minh Ha said, uncertain if that was the truth anymore.\nCharles watched her for a while, and then he said, \u201cYou do see that we can\u2019t allow the Vermilion Seal to blackmail the Government into some nonsense about revising the history books. That hacking into public V-spaces and revealing \u2018the truth\u2019 is no way to run a society.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Minh Ha said, wearily. One day. One interview left before Sarah was gone forever. \u201cIs this really what we should be arguing about?\u201d\n\u201cYou have to see\u2014\u201d Charles paused. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who gave her all those Moc Tinh Hau stories. The one who encouraged her.\u201d\n\u201cI take no responsibility for that,\u201d Minh Ha said. How dare he accuse her? She\u2019d never taught Sarah anything but how to respect the law, to be a good Galactic citizen\u2014and how to best adapt herself to this society the Rong all found themselves living in.\n\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Charles said it without resentment or visible expression. \u201cYou\u2019re her mother. You delude yourself if you think you have passed nothing on to her.\u201d\nPrecious little\u2014what kind of mother was she, that she couldn\u2019t prevent her only child from leaving her? \u201cI\u2019m her mother, not her master. Are you threatening me with anything? Isn\u2019t bad enough that I\u2019m losing my only daughter?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s my daughter too.\u201d Charles voice was low, angry; Sarah had inherited that from him, that tendency to speak tonelessly and yet still exude a sense of menace. \u201cWe\u2019re all losing her.\u201d\nMinh Ha gestured to the ancestral altar behind him. \u201cThe entire family is losing her. You know what this means for us.\u201d\n\u201cYour old Rong superstitions?\u201d Once, Charles\u2019 jabs would have been more biting; but now he merely sounded weary\u2014like her, wrung dry by the enormity of Sarah\u2019s acts. \u201cYou forget. I left all that behind.\u201d He turned to the ancestral altar, watching the holos. \u201cDo you still go to the Hall of the Dead?\u201d\nMinh Ha nodded. \u201cI went yesterday. They had nothing to tell me.\u201d\n\u201cThey never have.\u201d Charles didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou should leave the Dead well alone, Minh Ha\u2014they just drag you down. Like they did with Sarah.\u201d\n\u201cSarah never went to the Hall.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\nYes, the weight of the past; those resentments he couldn\u2019t understand\u2014the Galactics declaring war on behalf of the Western Continent, hoping to maintain their presence on Moc Tinh Hau; the history holos proclaiming the fight for democracy, as if things were ever that simple or that pure. \u201cThe past made us what we are,\u201d Minh Ha said, knowing it to be true.\n\u201cBut the past is gone.\u201d Charles\u2019 voice was almost gentle. \u201cThis is the true lesson of the Halls\u2014the Dead might as well be on another planet. They no longer speak our language or understand our thoughts.\u201d\nMinh Ha remembered being on her knees, staring at the cobbles of the V-space; remembered Mother\u2019s agitation, the frantic gestures she couldn\u2019t interpret. She said nothing\u2014merely watched the holo of Mother as she\u2019d been before old age caught up with her, strong and unbending and unlikely to give way to anyone. Why was she gone\u2014why were they all alone, without the guiding influence of the older generation? \u201cI guess not,\u201d she said at last.\nCharles turned back to her; and forced a weak smile. \u201cThank you for the information. I\u2019ll go back to the holding facility and apply for another interview with her. You never know.\u201d\nMinh Ha, staring at him, was struck by the white scattered in his hair, by the bowed set of his shoulders, as if time itself had pressed down on him until his old arrogance disappeared\u2014and she thought of the way that everything seemed to have been hollowed out by the arrest. \u201cDo you want to stay for dinner?\u201d she asked, in spite of herself.\nCharles shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve intruded enough on you for one night. Forgive me.\u201d\nAfter he\u2019d left, she remained where she was, staring at the altar. The Dead no longer speak our language, he had said, knowing full well the unbearable silence of the Hall: the chatter of the V-space, and all the familiar things, just frustratingly out of reach.\n\u201cIs he gone?\u201d Thuy asked from behind her; putting her hands on Minh Ha's shoulders, as she'd used to do when they'd been children in Xuan Huong.\nHer elder sister\u2019s hands smelled of garlic and something sweet\u2014perhaps dried jujubes? \u201cYes,\u201d Minh Ha said, knowing Thuy had never approved of him. \u201cAnd Sarah will be gone, too, soon.\u201d\n\u201cOne more interview.\u201d Thuy\u2019s voice was oddly shrewd. \u201cOne last thing to give her before she goes ahead into the darkness of space.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to give her,\u201d Minh Ha said, frustrated. She thought of the book she\u2019d brought on her first interview, left in a locker somewhere\u2014Master Kong\u2019s sayings, a physical gift she hadn\u2019t been able to give to Sarah. \u201cI don\u2019t understand her anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re meant to understand,\u201d Thuy said, gently. \u201cJust to support her.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Minh Ha watched the holos; watched Mother\u2019s face, forever frozen into a half-grimace; watched Second Aunt\u2019s serene gaze, Third Aunt\u2019s awkward smile at the camera. Mother was the one who\u2019d found them safe passage\u2014who had bargained and smiled and bribed Galactic officials until they found a berth on one of the last ships to leave. The aunts were the ones who had opened the Rong restaurant\u2014it was the only non-menial work open to them\u2014and sent the entire family through Applied Schooling. They had lived through a war and an entire life of exile, and surely they would know\u2014surely they would\u2014\nMinh Ha thought of everything that they no longer had; every way in which they had been diminished, and cut off from what mattered most.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said, finally. \u201cIt\u2019s time to accept what I can\u2019t understand.\u201d\nTime to give Sarah what she would most need on Cygnus.\nThere is no answer. There never is any.\nNone but the ones you make for yourself.\nTrembling, Minh Ha reaches out\u2014in that suspended instant before the filters come online, before the Dead are rewritten into safer, saner\u2014 sanitized\u2014code. Her hand touches Mother\u2019s; and she feels warmth, travelling all the way from her palm into her madly beating heart.\nOn her third visit to Sarah, Minh Ha says nothing. There are no words left, no message of comfort that she could give her daughter.\nInstead, she takes Sarah\u2019s hand, and holds it tight until the last of the warmth has leached from her body into her daughter\u2019s; and braces herself for the future.\nShe ignores Sarah\u2019s slight gasp of surprise; the widening of her daughter\u2019s eyes as the patterns of the Dead slip into V-space\u2014from her hand into Sarah\u2019s hand; from her mind into her daughter\u2019s own. It is, in any case, too late to turn back.\nAs she walks out of the visitors\u2019 V-space, Minh Ha hears the whispers of the Dead in her mind; snatches of sentences that feel sharp enough to tear her mind apart; the bright, terrible sound of bombs over the city\u2014the dark and biting history of her people that she\u2019ll always carry with her, the memories and insights of the Dead that might destroy her, that might make her finally whole.\nAnd she knows that, wherever her daughter goes, she, too, will carry it all\u2014the weight of her ancestors\u2019 blessing, in her blood and in her mind.\nAliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

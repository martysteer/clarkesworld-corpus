Inside they were hosting a quiet, desolate little exhibition\u2014just a few exhibits and a drowsy admin under bright stage lighting.\nOf course, I knew what I was in for before entering that exhibition hall: a collection pertaining to Late Qing dynasty fiction.\nIt sounded dry and dull, but I\u2019m quite a dry and dull fellow. And then came random chance, and the unexpected.\nThe exhibits were a smattering of old and unimportant things: a page of the Shanghai News, illustrative of the prosperous newspaper industry back then, but just a sheet of newsprint with an unsightly layout, and not very prosperous-looking really. Then there was a TOC from a volume of New Fiction, edited by journalist and reform leader Liang Qichao . . .\nNext to the sheet of Shanghai News was an exhibit case containing many other samples of papers that ran in Shanghai, like the famous Eastern Times and Sin Wan Pao, and lesser-known papers like The New Women\u2019s Journal and New Daily. It was a piece in the latter that piqued my interest.\nIt wasn\u2019t the content of the fiction that drew me in, but the small, blurry illustrations accompanying it. Ratlike humanoids stood on the cratered surface of the Moon. They were rigging up a crude, concave reflector like a present-day satellite dish, using a crater rim for support. I knew it was a reflector because in the far corner of the image was the Sun, shining a beam of light onto the Moon, which the dish redirected at Earth. Black smoke rose from the focal point on Earth.\nThis gave me pause. Someone from the Late Qing knowing the Moon was cratered? Then again, it made sense. Part of the ether fantasy propagated back then was a notion that the fabled substance might fill the Moon\u2019s craters, so that from Earth, the Moon would appear smooth. But my brief doubt caused me to linger on this newspaper, originally no more interesting than the other exhibits. Serialized novel chapters, each with a summarizing couplet, were the main form of fiction in the Late Qing.\nThis sheet of newspaper featured the ending of the seventeenth chapter of the novel in question.\nI leaned over the display glass and struggled to read the small print.\nThe scenes described were similar to those illustrated, but the ins and outs were clarified. The rodent-like people were called \u201cLunar Squirrel Folk,\u201d their origins unknown. They occupied the Moon and meant to attack Earth\u2014that was all I could tell at this point. They\u2019d come together for this war, but they were bickering and in-fighting, at an impasse regarding how to attack Earth, various factions sticking stubbornly to their views. These different plans weren\u2019t enumerated. It was only clear that by assaulting and biting each other, they subdued dissent and finally settled on the plan illustrated: the burning of Earth with a reflector. They called it the \u201cMoonlight Death Ray.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t sure if such a design would\u2019ve been considered novel at the time. Perhaps readers found it provocative. The piece ended on a note of suspense, with the fate of the Squirrel Folk\u2019s Moonlight Death Ray unclear. The design diagram was complete, but the weapon was not yet online. The Squirrel Folk were still in-fighting, biting each other\u2019s necks, while watching Earth, squeaking, and grinning. There was the sense that Earthbound humanity was already doomed, and oblivious to the fact. This was quite in keeping with pervasive sentiment among Late Qing era people, their panic as they regarded their own affairs and the wider world.\nI had become engrossed and skipped the title of the novel. It was Ascent to the Moon: Travel Notes of Guang Hansheng.\nThis further stimulated my interest. I hadn\u2019t seen any sign of a character named Guang Hansheng. In what sense were these travel notes? Based on Chapter Seventeen, Guang should already have made it up to the Moon. So, where was he hiding? Hadn\u2019t these fierce and factious Squirrel Folk found him yet?\nI checked the author\u2019s signature: Xijin Guang Hansheng. Not surprising, actually. There was no first-person narration in Late Qing novels, but there were many quasi-first-person perspectives, as in The Travels of Lao Can. But who was this Guang Hansheng? Another unknown.\nI decided to dig deeper into Ascent to the Moon: Travel Notes of Guang Hansheng and its author Xijin Guang Hansheng.\nFirst, I needed to read the entire novel, which wouldn\u2019t be difficult. I just had to visit the microfilm archive and apply for film of the newspaper, specifying the time period I wanted. But there would be a short wait.\nI guessed when Ascent to the Moon might have begun its serialized run. I applied to the archive for September 1905 through September 1906 of New Daily. The admin said it would take about half an hour.\nI searched the library\u2019s digital database while I waited. I wanted to see if this Guang Hansheng had written other novels. And there was his signature, \u201cXijin\u201d Guang Hansheng. During the Late Qing, many authors still signed with the \u201cbirthplace plus esteemed name\u201d method. Guang\u2019s hometown ought to be Xijin. But where was that? Something else to follow up on.\nFirst, I simply searched for keyword \u201cXijin.\u201d\nIt turned out to be in Beijing. During the Liao dynasty, it was called the Southern Capital Seat of Government. Later, it was the secondary or accompanying capital of the Yuan dynasty\u2019s Dadu seat. It was located near the Lotus Pond of present-day Beijing. I couldn\u2019t help feeling a little disappointed. If it had been a small place, I might\u2019ve been able to visit and speak with some old folks, people over a hundred, if there were any, and that might\u2019ve yielded something. But in Beijing, you were unlikely to get anything from locals regarding a decade past, never mind a century.\nAt this point, my New Daily microfilm was retrieved from the archive.\nI turned on a microfilm reading station, rather impatient. The machine was like an old-school, cumbersome eighties PC. You inserted microfilm in the front, beneath the light-reflecting element. Your content appeared on a screen lit yellow from beneath. Then you just fiddled with the focus until the content was clear.\nThe reading station\u2019s cooling fan buzzed, and the black-and-white text of Shanghai was before me. Beginning in September 1905, I started scanning upward page by page, speeding through days with the turn of a knob.\nI scan fast, but I miss nothing. Soon I came to page two of September 13, 1905, and an ad for the serialization of the \u201cscience novel\u201d Ascent to the Moon: Travel Notes of Guang Hansheng.\nThe ad was like others of the time, touting the piece to Heaven: world-class thrills, a science novel with Three Kingdoms far-reaching strategy, Red Chamber pathos, Journey to the West-style banter and humor, Water Margin chivalry, and so on. The style and phrasing were not particularly tasteful.\nWith no self-intro from the author, Chapter One came right after the ad.\nGuang Hansheng appeared at the get-go, but he was in Shanghai, not on the Moon. I thought maybe he\u2019d build a rocket or something. Harboring doubts, I continued to read. It turned out Guang had not the slightest notion of visiting the Moon. Instead, in the manner of a down-and-out intellectual, he ran away to Shanghai\u2019s most notorious red-light district, Sima Road, to patronize the bordellos and sow his wild oats. Choosing a higher end brothel, he went in and ordered a famous, beautiful courtesan, a \u201cQueen of Flowers.\u201d Unexpectedly, this highest of courtesans turned out to be Guang\u2019s childhood sweetheart.\nTo my eye, the story was already a melodramatic clich\u00e9. I barely wanted to continue reading. Where was the Moon? Where were the Squirrel Folk? I checked the title again, confirming it was indeed Ascent to the Moon: Travel Notes of Guang Hansheng, signed \u201cXijin Guang Hansheng.\u201d\nIt ought to perform as advertised. I had no choice but to brace myself and continue scrolling and reading.\nAfter several consecutive days of serialization, the first chapter finally ended. The character Guang was still in the brothel, wallowing in pleasure.\nI started reading Chapter Two, and it seemed there was a light at the end of the clich\u00e9 tunnel.\nThis chapter opened on the Moon. All previous melodrama was gone, replaced by a meticulous, detailed description of the Moon\u2019s appearance. The writing style had changed utterly, becoming refined. This was the Moon as world and background scenery. The precision and detail amazed me. At the general scientific level of the Late Qing, he was somehow able to describe lunar craters and render the low gravity environment, and the fantastic beauty of the starry lunar sky filled with a rising Earth, a full Earth corresponding to a full Moon, the surprise and joy of looking up at this, portrayed flawlessly. But even with such eye-catching content, there were serious shortcomings. This was only scenery. There was no story line, no Squirrel Folk. Chapter Two was just a seasoned popular science piece.\nOn the other hand, because of this strikingly different second chapter, I was all the more intrigued. So maybe it wasn\u2019t a bad thing.\nBut once again a problem arose. As I continued to scroll and read, I encountered gaps in the microfilm record of this newspaper. The gaps were three to five days at first, and I could still find fragments of Ascent to the Moon on occasion. But then came month-long gaps, and soon, scrolling into 1906, there was little besides February\u2019s Nanchang Missionary Case, with its media controversy and big debate layouts.\nThis sort of thing is actually quite common, but when I\u2019m interested in something and the scholarly trail goes cold, my sense of helplessness and frustration can seem to pervade the universe. What could I do? If the material wasn\u2019t there, it wasn\u2019t there. Even if I went hunting to the fountainhead of microfilm production, Shanghai Library, I\u2019d still be unlikely to find what I wanted.\nThe situation seemed irrecoverable when I left the library. I walked the glistening asphalt in a restless trance. Then I happened to look up, and there was the bright Moon, dominating the sky, and suddenly I felt connected to Guang Hansheng, this human-shaped mystery who\u2019d lived over a century before. Perhaps Guang had gazed upon this Moon all those years ago with anticipation and hope. But anticipation of what? Hope for what?\nI hurried home and decided to at least find out what kind of person Guang Hansheng was.\nHis fiction had provided some ingress. I\u2019d only seen one of his works, and incomplete at that, but it had conveyed much. Setting aside the vulgar story of Protagonist Guang in Shanghai, Chapter Two\u2019s description of the Moon demonstrated considerable scientific literacy. Compared with the ubiquitous, unbounded, and enticing speculation of the time\u2014supersonic airships and the like\u2014Guang\u2019s moonscape was scientifically sound. But due to gaps in the text, I didn\u2019t know how that serious lunar description gave rise to Squirrel Folk.\nAt the same time, although he clearly wasn\u2019t much of a fiction writer, he was wildly ambitious when it came to narrative structure.\nFrom what I\u2019d seen of the novel, I guessed it had roughly a two-thread structure. One thread traced how Guang Hansheng, our protagonist, was deceived into love and profligacy by his childhood sweetheart. The other was Moon scenery, sans distractions like plot or character. This sort of writing had never appeared in Late Qing dynasty novels. I knew from Chapter Seventeen that the Squirrel Folk eventually appeared, but when and how would Protagonist Guang end up on the Moon for his tour? These were his \u201ctravel notes,\u201d after all. When would the title be honored? It seemed unlikely I would find the answer.\nThe guy seemed like a narcissist, his writing willful in its nonconformity. Maybe he knew his scientific literacy set him apart from other writers of the time but didn\u2019t know his literary ability wasn\u2019t up to the task of constructing a viable long-form novel.\nI spent the next few days at the microfilm library, scrolling through reels of film.\nDespite the nonsensically smashed and scattered literary conventions of Ascent to the Moon, I was getting more curious about how the Moon setting had been developed and how the Squirrel Folk arose.\nI was unlikely to find any more novel serializations in New Daily. It would have been irrational to keep chasing the fantasy of a miraculous discovery. I figured that since Guang had been quite scientifically literate, and proud of it by the looks of his writing style, he\u2019d probably displayed his talent in other, science-oriented papers.\nSelf-important people cannot abide silence or anonymity.\nI began with The All Nations Gazette, one of the most popular disseminators of Western science back then. Although the electronic database was exhaustive, leaving nothing to be desired, I was afraid I\u2019d missed something. I searched for \u201cGuang Hansheng\u201d and \u201cXijin Guang Hansheng,\u201d turning up nothing. So, I decided to thumb through the original documents myself.\nBased on when Ascent to the Moon: Travel Notes of Guang Hansheng had been serialized, September of 1905, and the maturity of the writing, I inferred Guang wouldn\u2019t have been active before 1904. But just to be safe, I began my search of The All Nations Gazette in 1900. I scrolled through days and months and years, through the Boxer Rebellion and the signing of the Boxer Protocol, Marie Curie\u2019s research on radioactive uranium, commercial use of ariel photography in Los Angeles, and more, but no trace of Guang Hansheng. I was especially careful with 1905, but there was nothing\u2014no articles by Guang, no mention of him.\nOf course, being unable to find something in The All Nations Gazette wasn\u2019t so unusual. I soldiered on, burying my head in other publications: Shanghai News, Eastern Times, China Discussion, Sin Wan Pao, Jinghua Daily, and so on.\nThe search was turning out to be quite difficult. A month passed in the blink of an eye.\nI showed up at the library early every day and worked all day. Some of the microfilm managers came to know me, and sometimes we chatted during breaks.\nI guess they didn\u2019t understand my obsession. They would ask which university I was a professor at, and then, when I\u2019d disabused them, they\u2019d follow up timidly: was I a PhD student? No again. They\u2019d keep guessing, but at that point I\u2019d cut them off with a new microfilm request. Eventually they came to understand I wasn\u2019t going to divulge my social identity. They stopped inflicting embarrassment or boredom on themselves. We chatted about life, parents, the little complaints of microfilm custodians, and other small talk.\nAlthough few but me visited this library\u2019s microfilm archive, there were occasional students. There was, after all, rare and unique microfilm there. They were PhD students doing doctoral dissertations, needing vast quantities of documentary support, forced to consult microfilm. They were clumsy, clueless about how to load film in a reader. They\u2019d clearly never touched this technology during their master\u2019s degrees.\nSometimes I would gaze upon the garden outside the window to rest my dry, tired eyes. During these breaks, the admin would sometimes recruit me to guide a fumbling newb.\nYou can learn it in a few seconds, with little effort. My unskilled, low-tech guidance led some PhD students to chat with me a bit more.\nI didn\u2019t mind, if I was on a break, and so long as it wasn\u2019t about me. They didn\u2019t mind in many cases, taking the opportunity to vent about the difficulties and stresses of their dissertations. Occasionally they chanced upon a topic I knew something about, like Late Qing periodicals and newspapers, their circumstances of publication and things like that, and I would idly share my opinion. I imagine most of them found my advice excessive. They smiled out of politeness, nothing more.\nAt these times, I would tactfully return to my reading machine and reimmerse myself. I had things to do.\nNo one knew who or what I was looking for. No one knew better than I how hard it was to find this Guang Hansheng.\nIt doesn\u2019t bare repeating, all the newspapers I was obliged to rummage through. But I wasn\u2019t doing a doctoral dissertation. I didn\u2019t have to be as exhaustive as a scholar. I was free to follow my hunches, by which I might know my month-long search was going in the wrong direction. I had focused on The All Nations Gazette because of its popularity and its function of disseminating Western technology. Now I gradually deviated from that course.\nMy first step was to apply once more for microfilm of New Daily and to read through it again carefully. I confirmed that apart from the incomplete serialization ending with Chapter Seventeen\u2014where the Squirrel Folk finally decide to use their Moonlight Death Ray against Earth\u2014there was nothing about Xijin Guang Hansheng, not another datum, not another character. Meanwhile, I decided this Guang Hansheng would not have been published in ordinary, popular newspapers. No way. That much was clear from what I\u2019d seen of his novel. Maybe Ascent to the Moon had been his debut, and bad enough to not only be discontinued at Chapter Seventeen, but to cement the author\u2019s bad reputation, guaranteeing he would ascend no higher in the world of letters.\nI abandoned the likes of Shanghai News and China Discussion for periodicals devoted purely to Western science and technology, like Chinese Scientific and Industrial Magazine.\nAnd then, in October of 1906, finally: a discovery!\nA piece signed \u201cXijin Guang Hansheng,\u201d published in a monthly magazine that only put out five issues, New Learning of the Western World.\nSeeing his name again was like a reunion with an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in years. But my old friend seemed to have an attitude problem. His short piece wasn\u2019t fiction, but something like an official call to arms. He was crusading against a masterpiece of translation by Yan Fu, who at that time was president of Fudan University. Guang\u2019s target was a translation of Huxley\u2019s Evolution and Ethics, published years before. His assault seemed unhinged, lacking reason or basis, a mere screed in which he insisted, repeatedly and passionately, that the translation was loaded with errors, and even ran counter to the views expressed by Huxley in the original.\nAfter reading the piece, I began to fear for Guang Hansheng. If Yan Fu or his followers had seen this aimless, digressing invective from such a lowly scholar, they must have extinguished him on the spot.\nThere were two more issues of New Learning of the Western World. I read them carefully but found no response to Guang\u2019s incitement. I searched other platforms that might\u2019ve published controversial articles, but no one seemed to have taken Guang\u2019s bait.\nI couldn\u2019t decide if this was good luck or bad for Guang. The multitude had ignored his howls.\nThanks to the New Learning of the Western World breakthrough, I had a new research direction, and finding Guang Hansheng suddenly got easier. Articles signed \u201cXijin Guang Hansheng\u201d appeared frequently in small popular science magazines and periodicals similar to New Learning.\nHe seemed to peak in mid-to-late 1906. I called to mind every popular science periodical I knew of and kept searching. \u201cXijin Guang Hansheng\u201d appeared in many tabloids that only ran four or five issues before extinction.\nThese were street tabloids, really, many or most of them one-pagers. The top half was usually ads for hair removal, brain boosters, miracle methods for giving up smoking, and the like. Illustrations of oddities and phantasmagoric figures held up goods for sale, accompanied by carnival barker language such as \u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d It was all irredeemably kitschy, commercial, and tiresome. The lower halves of these one-pagers were often Q&As rather than complete articles, like the regular column in The Western Natural Science Compilation.\nThe questions were all kinds of strange:\n\u201cWhy is yawning contagious?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is the underlying principle of the Westerners\u2019 X-ray?\u201d\n\u201cWhy does our rooster only crow at night?\u201d\n\u201cIf someone can generate a sulfurous smell by rubbing their palms together, can that person generate electricity?\u201d\nAnd other such inquiries. Many had nothing to do with science. For example, someone might ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the probability of sitting the Western imperial exam?\u201d Some of the questions were so ridiculous I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\nThe answerer was different in each issue. The mere conscientious elucidators of principles didn\u2019t interest me. I wasn\u2019t seeking their refined, thought-provoking conclusions.\nWhen Guang Hansheng appeared, the style completely changed. Someone asked, \u201cHow long is the longer of the two right angle sides of a right triangle where the shorter is one zhang (3.3 meters), and one of the acute angles is 35 degrees 20 minutes?\u201d Such questions had come up before, on occasion, and generally the answer was a careful run down of the calculation. But Guang tore right into the questioner, saying, \u201cThis is a forum for difficult scientific questions. Why ask about elementary problems that require only a bit of calculation? If you really can\u2019t figure this out, refer to an arithmetic or geometry textbook. I recommend Geometry Preparation, Algebra and Analytic Geometry, or anything similar from the mountain of such texts that exist. You really didn\u2019t need to waste my time here.\u201d\nI read on and realized Guang Hansheng had actually responded to many questions. It amounted to a lot of content, but he probably didn\u2019t leave many questioners happy. Most of his answers were terse, one sentence affairs. The question was either conceptually flawed and unworthy of a reply or a matter of common sense and unworthy on that score. \u201cFind the answer yourself and you\u2019ll see it wasn\u2019t worth asking,\u201d he would say, or he\u2019d simply reply with a book and page number to reference, without a character of explanation.\nThis troubled me even more than Guang\u2019s scolding of Yan Fu. If this was how he\u2019d conducted himself, how had he made ends meet? By then, the Qing government had abolished the imperial exam system that had persisted for over a millennium. What sort of life or career ladder was there for an intellectual like him? In the Late Qing, authors were paid by the character. Guang\u2019s contemporaries were as wordy as possible, but he seemed to take an arrogant, perverse pleasure in concision and self-impoverishment.\nUnsurprisingly, the name Xijin Guang Hansheng soon vanished from all the pop sci tabloids. Harmonious tranquility returned to the Q&As.\nIt seemed the world of popular science had unanimously expelled Guang Hansheng.\nAnd once again I had lost contact, and my strenuous pursuit began anew.\nWhere had rude, condescending Guang run off to? How was I to decipher his lunar world? I feared the key was lost with him, and I feared there would be no further sign of him as I proceeded into 1907.\nBy that year, the reform of the Qing court seemed to be succeeding where the Hundred Days\u2019 Reform had failed a decade earlier. The Qing government\u2019s international status had improved somewhat, but then Qiu Jin was killed, sparking widespread indignation. There was upheaval at every level of society, but from what I could see in the rise and fall of pop sci tabloids, no sign of what I sought. Brief-lived periodicals, kitschy ads, and no Guang Hansheng.\nMaybe this was it. In one of the last parts of Ascent to the Moon I\u2019d read, the character version of Guang had considered becoming a teacher at a girls\u2019 school, to spend the rest of his days as an object of ridicule, teased and despised by the students. Maybe the real Guang had done just that. Maybe he\u2019d vanished from history, descending into eternal silence.\nAs I considered various possibilities, I kept combing through the meager archives left to me, month by month.\nPerhaps he\u2019d changed his pen name. This was the most likely explanation. In many cases, magazine and newspaper editors didn\u2019t know the true identities of their contributors. It was common for multiple people to share the same pseudonym in order to maximize re-numeration. When his foul temper got him exiled from the pop sci tabloid world, it would\u2019ve been easy for Guang to change his pen name and keep scribbling for a living.\nIf he really had done so, that was goodbye. These archives are like a vast ocean. Even though they\u2019re shrunk onto microfilm, they require warehouses of storage. And this was Guang Hansheng. There wasn\u2019t going to be a celebrity behind the name. There wasn\u2019t going to be anyone of note who\u2019d been written about by close friends. There would be no memoir to supply clues to researchers. Guang Hansheng was no \u201cI\u2019m a Foshan-er,\u201d pen name of Late Qing writer Wu Jianren, or \u201cSelf-Awareness of the Eastern Sea,\u201d pseudonym of Xu Nianci. If Guang had changed his pen name, seeking him out would be harder than finding Eileen Chang\u2019s new work Little Reunions. I\u2019d heard the PhD student looking for Reunions in the microfilm archive had ended up with detached retinas.\nOn the other hand, I had a vague feeling that the person behind the pseudonym Guang Hansheng hadn\u2019t taken the reasonable way out.\nAnd then, there he was again, in an obscure tabloid at the end of 1907. An article, not a Q&A. No \u201cXijin\u201d added to the signature, just the three characters Guang, Han, and Sheng.\nWhen I saw that, even without the Xijin affectation, I was so excited I nearly cried out in the crypt-silence of the microfilm archive. But I didn\u2019t want to be premature. Was this Guang my Guang? I had to read the article before I could judge.\nIt seemed like a modern special column, a unified title and format, no illustrations, no intro. And it was about . . . the Moon!? Now I really was moved to voice my excitement, a low-toned exhalation. That Moon of Guang\u2019s, as if from a lifetime ago, once more appeared before me on the screen of the microfilm reader, the fan whirring behind the yellow light.\nIt seemed that indeed Guang Hansheng was back, with his lunar world.\nI scanned back through the microfilm again, afraid I\u2019d missed something. I confirmed the article was Guang\u2019s first published in this tabloid and started reading.\nAt first, I feared he\u2019d been lazy and taken Ascent to the Moon\u2019s lunar worldbuilding and moved it here. Had that been the case, it would have been a meaningless discovery, another empty phantom of the past, and not the essence of Guang I was seeking. But as I read, I realized I was overthinking it. I ought to have had more faith in old Guang. I even felt a little ashamed.\nIn the first part of the column, Guang frankly stated that the Moon, which the world sees every night, was one of the least understood celestial bodies. All descriptions of the Moon, he claimed, were wrong. However, knowing what was wrong, he admitted not knowing what was right. He therefore gave up on truth and embraced imagination.\nThe column\u2019s title was \u201cThe Suppositional Moon.\u201d\nI was relieved and reassured. Guang\u2019s speculative prose wasn\u2019t going to be about a mere fairyland, or the Jade Emperor\u2019s Temple in Heaven, or anything like that.\nIn the first part, he imagined the Moon as a cave or hole.\nHe described our fantasizing as we gaze up at the bright and shining full Moon, wondering who lives up there, what sort of people they are, what their architecture is like. But maybe it\u2019s all an illusion, a misconception. The human eye often preconceives convexity or concavity. Guang wondered if we did so with the Moon. Perhaps it was a hole instead of a ball, a wormhole from an alien galaxy to Earth\u2019s doorstep, fully open one day a month, communicating with the beyond for hundreds of millions of years. Perhaps it had conveyed numberless things here and had taken away many more. Perhaps we humans simply didn\u2019t understand. Perhaps we couldn\u2019t.\nThe article was short and uncharacteristically civil apart from the beginning, where Guang satirized those who imagined they understood the universe. It seemed his setbacks had finally taught him to behave, after more than a year of silence.\nHe went on to imagine the Moon as a power plant, then as a human spaceship that could accelerate via gravitational slingshot (he didn\u2019t use that term, but his idea wasn\u2019t far off).\nThis column probably improved Guang Hansheng\u2019s reputation. Suddenly his name was appearing in other newspapers, but as I read these pieces, I grew once more troubled. The old Guang was back, a quarrelsome perfectionist not suffering fools gladly. He was quick to denounce and condemn. He responded, via article, to anything he found objectionable, and he pulled no punches. It was like his earlier dressing down of Yan Fu for his Huxley translation, pen keen and shrill, the art of composition fiercely ignored, step-by-step deductions and reasoning processes taken for granted and not elucidated.\nArgumentative but inept at argument: that was Guang Hansheng. I feared that he was truly doomed this time. Unsurprisingly, he disappeared from the record three months later, along with his suppositional Moon and his impatience with unreason.\nI was sure there would be no second resurrection.\nIndeed, I couldn\u2019t find another trace of him in microfilm thereafter. Maybe my assumptions came into play, and I didn\u2019t look hard enough. I don\u2019t know. Maybe he appeared a few years later under \u201cGuang, Han,\u201d or \u201cXin Yuesheng,\u201d the New Moon reborn, or \u201cGui Sheng,\u201d or other such pen names. But I didn\u2019t think my Guang would change his pseudonym. He would hope and wait for a chance to resurface as Guang Hansheng, and I feared no one would dare give him such an opportunity.\nI wasn\u2019t going to do a dissertation on him. His life and writings weren\u2019t worth a dissertation, and even if I did it, it wouldn\u2019t be worth scholars\u2019 time to read. Why then waste my time on the endeavor? But I still had to find out everything I could about him. Even the smallest tidbits. I wanted to know this person. Maybe his life had been short, his death unnoticed and not noted.\nI left the library and couldn\u2019t help taking the bus to Lotus Pond, the place once called \u201cXijin.\u201d\nIt was night when I arrived. Looking up, I found a full Moon.\nThere was the pond, its water low, and the park enclosing it, where fairs and sales expos were staged, and beyond that area, no old buildings. A bit desolate under the moonlight. Some restaurants were still open, but it was Mid-Autumn Festival, so most people were home with their families. Only a few foreigners sat drinking and enjoying the lonely Moon.\nPerhaps I\u2019d fancied my obsession strongly enough to conjure Guang Hansheng this night. I wanted to ask him how the Squirrel Folk appeared on the lunar surface. \u201cWith your rational and scientific mind,\u201d I wanted to say, \u201cyou know they couldn\u2019t appear out of thin air. So how did they do it? And why? Did they eventually achieve their goals? The ending must be tragic . . . \u201d\nI strolled all the way to the south square of West Railway Station. It was noisy and messy, bustling, a miasma of body odor, and I didn\u2019t find what I sought.\nWhat did this place look like a hundred years ago? Even so far removed from modern clamor, it must\u2019ve been as quaint and worldly and profane as now, right? The dense crowd was made up of people\u2014common, ordinary people, then as now. And back then, as now, they would not have been inclined to look up at the bright, full Moon. There was no need, no face up there worth remembering.\nThen as now, living well was more important than anything else.\nIn fact, my Guang Hansheng is almost certainly not the historically accurate man, or woman, but wishful thinking. I like to imagine an awkward, cantankerous savant possessed of scientific insight transcending his epoch, but unable to communicate it effectively. Understanding much that others can\u2019t, proud yet distracted, getting no approbation, insignificant, at the end of his rope, nowhere to go, nowhere to vent, and not even knowing himself clearly\u2014and suddenly, death is coming. He has squandered his rare smidgeon of talent, while watching others advance while he stays where he is. Alone. Just like countless literati of the time, and now, and even the future.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, Supplemental issue, 2016.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nLiang Qingsan, a science fiction writer and researcher of science fiction literature, has won several Chinese Nebula Awards and the Gold Award for Best Short Story at the 10th Global Chinese Science Fiction Nebula Awards.

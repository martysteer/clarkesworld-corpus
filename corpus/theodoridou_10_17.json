Tied down on this unnamed planet for precious months, without reason, by forces we cannot comprehend. Nomad fathers and nomad sons. Punished, perhaps? By God, by Panay\u00eda. For what deviance? It is hard to know His will. Harder yet to know His ways of measuring transgression.\n These thoughts keep Captain Y\u00e1nnis Bostantz\u00f3glou awake through the sleeping hours\u2014these, and the incessant song of nightingales echoing through the spaceship\u2019s hull. A line from an antique poem by the ancestral Sef\u00e9ris plays in Y\u00e1nnis\u2019 mind, about Helen, and Agamemnon, and the futile struggles of Greeks: \u201cThe nightingales,\u201d it went, \u201cthe nightingales won\u2019t let you sleep in Pl\u00e1tres.\u201d And they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t. As if the entire damn ship was built to fit that one, old verse.\n And what have we got but old verses? Y\u00e1nnis asks himself, as has been his usual manner of late. Because who else can he burden with such questions?\n He looks over to the sleeping figure of his young son. His breathing is regular, calm. He is not dreaming, then, and the nightingales don\u2019t bother him.\n The nightingales, the nightingales. Is this Pl\u00e1tres? Y\u00e1nnis wonders. And are these nightingales? Empty imitations of birds frozen in embryonic banks, deep in the ship\u2019s womb, recordings played over and over and over, plucked from a past none of us have known. What is asked of us? All we have to do is believe. And isn\u2019t faith the hardest thing to get when you don\u2019t already possess it, but the easiest thing to keep when you do?\n They tried to program the ship to cease the nightingale song during the sleeping hours, or at least dim it, make it less intrusive, softer, a lullaby even. They found it was one of the features that were impossible to access and modify. For some reason, the people who built the ship wanted it to always echo with the song of nightingales. Something about the song\u2019s effect on the population\u2019s health, they guessed. Or maybe they had just been told to do so by God, and they, of course, obeyed.\n Will our great-great-grandchildren have forgotten all about the birds of old Earth? Will they think them a myth made up by their senile ancestors, a rumor propagated by those disembodied songs, these ghosts of birds past?\n The boy shifts in his berth. His long hair crowns his head, curly and strong, like a halo. His son\u2019s head. His son\u2019s hair. This gift of a son.\n Y\u00e1nnis gives up on trying to sleep\u2014besides, the whole ship will soon come to life for another make-believe morning. Another shift of waiting for the wave that will get them off this rock, another prayer to be allowed to continue on their long, slow journey to the system of Tau Ceti. Another day on N\u00f3stos II.\n He sits up on his berth and runs his fingers through his long beard before tying it with an elastic band. All the men wear their beards this way. It would be easier to keep them short and trimmed, but this is not the tradition. N\u00f3stos II is nothing if not traditional.\n Y\u00e1nnis slips out of his compartment as quietly as possible so as not to disturb Panay\u00f3tis. He makes his way along the jungle that spans the bulk of the ship. The nightingale song is even louder out here. Y\u00e1nnis lets the vegetation brush against his face and breathes in the warm, moist air. It is a good life, this, despite everything.\n He enters the prayer room, his head hung low, his hands clasped in front of him, as is the proper way. There is a single flame burning in the old manou\u00e1li candlestand. It smells faintly of beeswax\u2014an artificial scent, of course, as they ran out of natural beeswax candles long before Y\u00e1nnis was born. The flame has almost consumed the entire stalk of the candle and is lapping at the sand that fills the bottom of the manou\u00e1li. There is no other light in the prayer room.\n Y\u00e1nnis approaches slowly and lights another candle. \u201cFor L\u00e9na,\u201d he whispers. His breath still catches whenever he utters his wife\u2019s name. L\u00e9na\u2019s sister Mar\u00edka is single. She\u2019s also the best genetic match for Y\u00e1nnis. Soon, they would have to be wed. But not yet. Not before the widower\u2019s sorrow has turned into a dull ache, no longer the sharp stab of a blade. It\u2019s only been fifteen Earth months. They still measure time in the traditional way.\n The flickering flame of the candle casts shadows across the room. Y\u00e1nnis runs his hand over the tiny boxes that line the walls until he finds the one that holds L\u00e9na\u2019s bone, right above his ancestors\u2019. L\u00e9na, L\u00e9na. She only got to enjoy their son for three short years. \u201cThis is the bargain I made,\u201d she told him with her last breath.\n He traces her name with his finger, and then he bends over and touches it with his lips. He does not kiss it. He vowed never to kiss again after that day, the day they crashed. Not even his son. Not even Panay\u00eda.\n He turns to face Her icon, almost indiscernible in the half-dark of the prayer room. Panay\u00eda Hagiosor\u00edtissa. Madonna Advocate, he prays silently, advocate for us, so we can get off this unholy place.\n He contemplates the Virgin Mary, clad in deep purple, head covered, facing him just so, her arms raised in supplication. She is alone in this icon, without her Child. She is pointing towards Her Son, presumably to an icon of Christ that would be standing next to hers. Is this loneliness of the divinity what drove L\u00e9na to ask Her? To make the heaviest t\u00e1ma, to bargain her life for a child? And the lonely God provided, She did.\n It was Y\u00e1nnis\u2019 earliest known ancestor who carried the icon with him as he was fleeing genocide in the early 1900s, not even a century before N\u00f3stos began its own journey. All the way from Anatolia to Greece, across the Black Sea, and the icon was all his ancestor took with him. Half his family drowned, but this, this he saved. He, too, had made a t\u00e1ma in exchange for safe passage. What price he\u2019d paid, no one knew, but when the Bostantzogla\u00edoi stepped onto Greek soil, the icon, they say, wept tears of salt.\n Our fleeing so different, Y\u00e1nnis thinks, and yet so similar. A leap of faith across the black, manifold sea of space. And then, he kneels in front of Her icon, makes the sign of the cross in the traditional way, and begs, his prayer full of questions.\n \u201cPanay\u00eda, what have we done wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy are we bound on this dead, rogue planet? Why can\u2019t we move? What do I have to do? Help us go. Help us, help us. Panay\u00eda.\u201d\n \u201cFather?\u201d\n He didn\u2019t hear his son coming in, or he wouldn\u2019t have spoken his despair out loud. He dries his eyes quickly and hopes the candlelight is not enough for Panay\u00f3tis to make out the fear on his father\u2019s face.\n \u201cWhat is wrong, son?\u201d he whispers. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asleep?\u201d He opens his arms, inviting the child to come near.\n \u201cThe nightingales,\u201d the sleepy boy whispers, rubbing his eyes. He still lingers near the prayer room\u2019s entrance.\n \u201cAh, yes, the nightingales.\u201d Some people get used to them, eventually. Some don\u2019t. Y\u00e1nnis pats his knees. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says.\n The child approaches and hides inside his father\u2019s arms. Y\u00e1nnis touches his forehead to his son\u2019s and rests his arms on the boy\u2019s shoulders as gently as he can, as if afraid to touch him, to hug him, so as not to harm him. This is how fragile he thinks him, his son, his only son. The precious, rare son. They named him after Her. How could they not?\n \u201cHere,\u201d Y\u00e1nnis says, lifting the child above his head, \u201cgive Panay\u00eda a kiss.\u201d\n Panay\u00f3tis crosses himself as his father raises him closer to the icon, and then kisses the Virgin Mary\u2019s forehead. His lips leave behind the faintest of marks on the ancient luster.\n \u201cWell done,\u201d Y\u00e1nnis says, caressing the boy\u2019s hair. \u201cNow off. Go find Aunt Mar\u00edka. I have work to do here.\u201d\n As soon as he\u2019s alone again, Y\u00e1nnis kneels before the icon and plunges back into his prayer.\n This planet is death. It has no star. No name. No air.\n He lifts his arm and touches the bottom of the wooden icon with his fingers.\n \u201cAre you punishing us, Panay\u00eda?\u201d He closes his eyes and hits his forehead with his fists, again and again. The repairs have been completed for months. They have waited too long for a Dirac wave that their space drive can grip. They have waited and waited and waited. \u201cTell me what I have to do,\u201d he pleads.\n Then, there is the voice. It shakes him, utterly and completely. It obliterates every other thought and fills his mind, his breath, this room, this life, this vast, vast space.\n YOUR ANCESTOR SAID, MAY MY SEED DIE OUT, IF ONLY I WOULD GET TO SEE THE SUN OF GREECE.\n Is this true?\n YOUR WIFE SAID, MAY WE NEVER REACH THIS NEW EARTH, IF ONLY I WOULD GET TO NURSE A SON.\n It cannot. This cannot.\n THEY WERE SELFISH, YANNI. WILL YOU BE SELFISH TOO?\n Tears flood Y\u00e1nnis\u2019 eyes. The lonely God finally speaks. She speaks to him and he\u2019s on his knees. He\u2019s on his knees and there is terror in his heart.\n \u201cWhat are you asking? I will gladly give You anything.\u201d\n A SACRIFICE.\n The air is knocked out of his lungs. He has no voice, and yet he manages to speak. \u201cWhat sacrifice?\u201d he asks. \u201cMy life? My light? This very ship?\u201d\n THE SON WHOM YOU LOVE.\n He opens his mouth to speak and closes it again. But I have only one, he wants to say. I have no other than the one whom I love.\n Then the awful question blooms in his mind: Has he always known he\u2019d have to give him up, eventually, his son, his only son? And then, the thought: Curse you, my ancestor, my root. Curse you, L\u00e9na, my love. How could you? And then: How could you not?\n GIVE HIM UP, YANNI, the voice says.\n GIVE HIM BACK.\n Y\u00e1nnis stands up, his hands curled into fists. He wants to shout. He wants to cry out: Why would God demand such things?\n But then he falls to his knees again. He refrains from mouthing such questions. For the will of Panay\u00eda is unknowable and great, and to seek to know it is to seek to extinguish one\u2019s mind. So, instead, he thinks of how L\u00e9na, when she was to wean the child, blackened her breasts with soot. And he is reminded again of the philosopher\u2019s unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lying beneath everything, of Abraham\u2019s leap of faith, and of Agamemnon\u2019s\u2014that one more dreadful still; because his leap had been a bargain, not a test.\n Did Abraham doubt? Y\u00e1nnis wonders. Did Agamemnon?\n A son for a son. A daughter for a deer, a deer for a wind. Is it a sin to doubt?\n Both these fathers were spared the unthinkable pain, Y\u00e1nnis thinks to himself, so why wouldn\u2019t he too? Why would he be any different, his faith lesser, his leap greater?\n \u201cWithout you, Panay\u00eda,\u201d he says out loud, his words echoing in the darkened prayer room, \u201cwhat would living be but despair?\u201d\n The brightness of the corridor hurts his eyes. He rests his back against the thick layer of ivy that covers the walls on one side of the prayer room door. His head is spinning, his eyelids burn. He brings his trembling hands to his face\u2014to hide it or to block out the light, he\u2019s not sure. It takes him a while to realize his beard has come undone.\n \u201cAre you all right, Y\u00e1nni?\u201d\n Mar\u00edka has grabbed his shoulder and is squeezing it gently. He didn\u2019t see her coming.\n \u201cDid you hear?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cHear what?\u201d\n He takes a good look at Mar\u00edka\u2019s face, her dark eyes, her arched nose. No. She has no idea. God chose him. Him and him alone.\n \u201cWhere is my son?\u201d he asks.\n She brings the back of her hand to his forehead, the way mothers do to feel for a child\u2019s temperature. \u201cI\u2019ve sent him to the database to study. What is wrong with you?\u201d\n He thinks of Seferis\u2019 poem again, his Pl\u00e1tres inhabited by myths. In that poem, Teukros, the exiled youth, sent to found a new home in Cyprus, ran into El\u00e9ni, who revealed to him she never went to Troy. The sacrifice, the war, the dead, the long trip home\u2014it was all for nothing.\n Does he remember this right?\n A daughter for a deer, a deer for a wind, a wind for a war, the war for naught. L\u00e9na, no, El\u00e9ni, nothing but a phantom, a cloud. An empty shirt, that Helen.\n Let\u2019s call this planet Moriah, he wants to say. Let\u2019s not call it Aulis.\n He looks at the monitor across the hall. It\u2019s displaying the ship\u2019s surroundings, the empty, barren planet that has trapped them, that is testing them\u2014because what else can this be but a test, this irrational becalming?\n \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny we have been stuck on a nomad planet for so long?\u201d he asks. Little gravity, no atmosphere. This is a place where no one is meant to stay for long. \u201cNomads on a nomad land. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n \u201cFunny is not the word I would use.\u201d She studies him, her forehead crinkled, her eyebrows furrowed. Mar\u00edka always worries about everyone, but she worries for him and Panay\u00f3tis most of all.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been praying to Her a long time, but this time, Mar\u00edka, this time She answered.\u201d\n Mar\u00edka takes a step back and stares at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d She glances at the prayer room door, then looks at him again, a kind of realization settling on her face.\n Mar\u00edka is a believer. She will understand. If not now, then later. Eventually, she will. He extends his empty palms towards her, as if to show her the bleeding marks of nails. \u201cPanay\u00eda spoke to me,\u201d he says simply. \u201cThere will be a wave this time. I know there will.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s been months. We should have come across a wave a long time ago,\u201d she says.\n Grasping for reason, when faith is all that will do.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not normal for them to be so far apart. Why now?\u201d she asks.\n He brushes his beard with his fingers. He spots the elastic band on the floor and picks it up. Then he ties his beard neatly again. His hands are not trembling anymore. \u201cBring the good news to the others. Tomorrow we are taking off,\u201d he insists. \u201cGod wills it.\u201d\n She shakes her head slightly, lost for words.\n He takes her hand. \u201cTomorrow, we are leaving this planet,\u201d he says again. \u201cToday, we must celebrate.\u201d\n Y\u00e1nnis always finds the celebrations on N\u00f3stos II somewhat uncanny. Strange, paradoxical. This group of a few hundred souls has never set foot on Greece, on Earth even, and neither had their parents. And yet, they are Greeks. They are from Earth. They grow up with songs and images and words from a world long gone. Their culture, nothing but a pastiche of references, and yet deeply their own. They learn the histories by heart, the dates, the names, the genocides. They carry the bones of their ancestors with them, along with their stories of miracles. They carry the faith. And their faith has carried them far in return. God ordered them to find a new Earth for themselves when the old one was on the brink of destruction. They did as they were told.\n Some of them doubt, of course, but this cannot be helped. Is this why they have been imprisoned here on this death of a planet? No, Y\u00e1nnis knows, it is not, no matter how tempting it might be to entertain that possibility. This is on his family and his ancestors, which means it is on him and him alone. He is the one who should carry it. His shoulders. His hands.\n The dining hall is filled with low round tables at which one has to sit cross-legged. Aromatic plants are lining the walls\u2014jasmine, and gardenia, and honeysuckle. The fragrance fills the air sweetly, mixed with the musty scent of damp soil. It might rain later tonight.\n Y\u00e1nnis is sitting under the gravure of the first astronaut to set foot on Mars, planting the Greek flag, back in the 1960s. His name was Anast\u00e1sios Bostantz\u00f3glou, and one of his bones is resting in that little box right beneath L\u00e9na\u2019s.\n Around Y\u00e1nnis, in a circle, is his extended family, and then, in larger circles beyond them, sit the families that make up the rest of the ship\u2019s human cargo. And next to him, of course, Panay\u00f3tis. The son, he thinks of him now, for he can no longer think of him as his own. The son whom I love.\n The nightingale song seems louder tonight.\n Before the leader of each family, the mothers, the fathers, the grandparents if they are still alive, is a container filled with flatbread made in the old way, just flour and water and salt. It is sour and dense. Familiar. Before each adult in the room rests a cup with a single sip of wine in it.\n Y\u00e1nnis does the sign of the cross and most of the people in the hall do the same. He fights the urge to glance at the son, to etch his posture in his memory, his three fingers touching together, his hand to his forehead, to his belly, to the right shoulder, then to the left.\n \u201cLet us eat,\u201d Y\u00e1nnis says. He picks up the first flatbread. For a moment, he stares at his hands. My hands, he thinks. Can they do what needs to be done? He breaks the bread and passes it around. So do the other leaders. They eat their simple meal, and when they are done and they have all drunk their sip of wine, they know it is time to relax and enjoy a few hours of conversation and storytelling.\n Even though tired, people seem cheerful enough. The conversations get louder as time passes. There is laughter, the occasional heated argument. It may sound like a fight, but it is all in good spirit. Let the bloods light up, as the ancestors said.\n If there is any doubt among them that they will finally get off this barren planet, it doesn\u2019t reach Y\u00e1nnis\u2019 ears. Only Mar\u00edka regards him with what could be concern. Or perhaps suspicion? Could it be that she knows what is to be done by him? But no, it couldn\u2019t, of course.\n As if to reassure him, Mar\u00edka hands him his bouzouki. \u201cPlay us something, Y\u00e1nni, will you?\u201d\n He hasn\u2019t played the instrument in a long time. It hasn\u2019t felt right since L\u00e9na died. How could his hands make music ever again? But tonight, it seems fitting. His father taught him when he was young. He listened for hours to all the great players of old, to Man\u00f3lis Chi\u00f3tis, Y\u00f3rgos Zab\u00e9tas, Vass\u00edlis Tsits\u00e1nis, Chr\u00edstos Nikol\u00f3poulos and so many others, watched videos of them playing over and over and tried to imitate their hands as they trembled over the strings like birds caught in a snare.\n It takes him a few moments, but then his hands recognize the instrument, the wood warms to him, and he remembers how to pinch the strings just so. He chooses an old, sorrowful song from 1961. I came back to your doorstep tonight / to sing for a last time. Mar\u00edka joins in, her voice deep and viscous, like warm molasses. I am leaving tomorrow, the lyrics go, everything is over. Maybe he should have chosen a different one. Is he giving away too much? Are they going to know? This is my last song / the birds cry along. But no, it is fitting. Y\u00e1nnis sighs deeply as he riffs over the melody of Mar\u00edka\u2019s voice. He remembers her as a child, her and L\u00e9na, long braids down their backs, singing doleful songs, even then.\n Those sad Greeks with their sad, sad songs.\n He turns to her. \u201cMar\u00edka,\u201d he tells her. Mar\u00edka. She could have been his mate, in a different life, a different place. \u201cMar\u00edka, you sing like a nightingale.\u201d\n When putting the son to sleep that night, the last night, kneeling by the child\u2019s berth, he looks at the boyish mouth and thinks again of L\u00e9na\u2019s blackened breast, the mournful undoing of what used to signify nurture and life. He looks at the child\u2019s slender limbs, and his mind conjures up the trembling limbs of fawns.\n \u201cOh God,\u201d he whispers. \u201cOh God.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it, papa?\u201d Panay\u00f3tis mumbles, almost lost to sleep.\n Y\u00e1nnis buries his face in the son\u2019s curls and breathes in deeply. Not yet, please, not yet. Soon, but not yet, he tells himself. As soon as he\u2019s asleep. He thinks of the childless Panay\u00eda, of Abraham, of Agamemnon.\n The lonely God will provide.\n \u201cShhh, son,\u201d he says. \u201cListen to the nightingales. Just listen to the nightingales sing.\u201d\n Even in the isolation room, the birdsong is there, loud, ever-present, relentlessly looped. Why did they do that, the ancestors, the ones who built this ship?\n Why do parents do the things they do?\n His body is spent, crumpled on the floor of the isolation room, where his people have stored him while they deliberate about how best to deal with him. Him, Y\u00e1nnis, the murderer\u2014worse, the filicide.\n The ancestors left them no laws\u2014only a handful of old texts with which to rule their lives. Bibles and poems and songs. Perhaps these are all we need.\n He brings his hands in front of his eyes, takes a good look at them. They are the same hands they\u2019ve always been\u2014and yet, not the same. Not at all.\n These hands of mine. Did I really think He would stay my hand at the last minute? Or that She would replace the son with a fawn, or a lamb, or a golden ram? Yes. I thought this was a test of my faith, I did. Was this my shortcoming? This hope that I could do the unthinkable wholeheartedly and still keep the promised son, my faith entire?\n Did I fail the test? No fawn, no lamb. Only murder.\n A son for a wave.\n He lifts his eyes to the ceiling, wonders what it would be like lifting them to face the sky.\n You are not the God I thought You were, he says silently. Nor I the man I thought I was.\n His throat is dry and raw, as if he has been screaming for hours, although he hasn\u2019t. He hasn\u2019t made a sound since. Since.\n And the nightingales, he wonders, why won\u2019t they cease their singing?\n He covers his ears with his palms, his eyes wide open, trying not to blink, because every time he blinks, there it is, the son\u2019s body too terrible to contemplate, impossible to behold.\n When Mar\u00edka walks in, hours later, she sits on the floor next to him, but she refuses to turn her gaze upon him.\n \u201cThey are deciding what to do with you,\u201d she says.\n He nods, but he doesn\u2019t reply.\n \u201cWhy did you do it, Y\u00e1nni?\u201d She almost chokes on his name.\n He is silent for a long time. She finally moves to leave, when he says, \u201cGod asked me to.\u201d\n She faces him. Her eyes are red. \u201cWhy? In return for what?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ve detected a wave, haven\u2019t they?\u201d\n She understands now, he knows she does.\n \u201cHaven\u2019t they?\u201d he asks again.\n She nods.\n This is it, then. The seas are finally rough enough for this Greek ship to sail. He dared to think himself an Abraham, when all he ever was, an Agamemnon.\n What a monstrous paradox faith is.\n He doesn\u2019t say anything, because there is nothing left to be said.\n But she isn\u2019t done. \u201cThis was not your decision to make!\u201d she shouts.\n \u201cYou are right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was God\u2019s.\u201d\n A cruel God\u2019s, he wants to say. The will of a God whom I do not know. But he doesn\u2019t say any of this. Because who can live without faith?\n Mar\u00edka turns around and leaves without a word.\n It doesn\u2019t take them long to decide. They need to wash themselves clean of him. Wouldn\u2019t anyone? He does too. Mar\u00edka is back with the news. Her face is ashen. Her arms hang limply at her sides.\n He stands up in the middle of the isolation room, ready to hear his fate. This time, she walks up to him. She puts her arms around him, startling him, and she hugs him tight and close.\n \u201cDo they believe me?\u201d he asks.\n She takes his head in her hands and looks him straight in the eyes.\n \u201cSome do. They thank you. I do, too.\u201d She looks at him sternly. \u201cWe are ready to go.\u201d She pauses. Tears shine in her eyes. Then she lets her words flow out. \u201cIs it worth it, Y\u00e1nni?\u201d she asks. \u201cOur lives, our survival, the new Earth, if killing children is what we have to do to get there? How can we go on after this?\u201d\n Poor, terrible Agamemnon.\n He pinches a tuft of her hair between his fingers. \u201cWeren\u2019t we children, once, Mar\u00edka?\u201d he asks. \u201cWeren\u2019t we sacrificed too?\u201d\n She stares at him, silent. The nightingales sing on, relentless, like an accusation. Is this what they\u2019ve always been?\n \u201cWe won\u2019t get to see the new Earth,\u201d he continues. \u201cOur children . . . \u201d He trails off, his knees giving way underneath him. He steadies himself. \u201cThe children you will have won\u2019t see this new Earth. They were never going to.\u201d\n She shakes her head, covers her eyes with her palms. \u201cY\u00e1nni\u2014\u201d she says and stops.\n \u201cTell me the rest of it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\n She looks at the floor. \u201cYou are staying here,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are leaving you here.\u201d\n Exile, then. They won\u2019t even dirty their hands with his death. He nods.\n \u201cWill you take him with you?\u201d he asks. \u201cPut his bone next to his mother\u2019s, have your children\u2019s children bury him with his ancestors when they get there? Will you make it so?\u201d\n She tries to speak, but a sob escapes her instead. \u201cOf course,\u201d she says after a few moments. She\u2019s crying now, doubled, her arm on her belly, as if she was the one who received his stab. \u201cOf course I will, of course, of course.\u201d\n He waits until she collects herself and dries her face.\n \u201cYou saved us,\u201d she says. \u201cI cannot understand the thing you did, how you brought yourself to do it.\u201d She looks him in the eyes now. \u201cAnd I will never forgive you.\u201d Her voice breaks. \u201cBut you saved us all.\u201d\n For how long? he wants to ask. Until the next bargain? The next desperate weakness, the next loving sin?\n Instead, he speaks the philosopher\u2019s words again: \u201cIn one hundred and thirty years, we got no further than faith,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far, but we\u2019ve really gotten no further than faith, Mar\u00edka.\u201d\n Few come to see him off. Mar\u00edka is there. Most of the others look at him with a mixture of terror and awe. They could have executed him, but what narrative would that be? What stories would their children tell, about how they were delivered from the nameless nomad planet that snared their ship, once upon a time? And about the holy wretch who saved them?\n Mar\u00edka weeps as he puts on his suit, the material tight against his skin. His helmet feels small around his head, heavy. Once he seals it, it blocks out all sound but his breath.\n He is ready to step off the ship and they are about to seal the airlock behind him, when Mar\u00edka orders everyone to stop.\n People protest weakly. They want this over with.\n \u201cMar\u00edka,\u201d he says. \u201cLet me go.\u201d\n \u201cJust wait!\u201d she yells, and she disappears into the ship.\n She comes back a few minutes later, panting, holding the bouzouki. She hands him the instrument and nods. Doesn\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission. Doesn\u2019t say a word.\n He puts as much distance as possible between himself and the ship before takeoff. Not that it matters. What could possibly matter anymore?\n He sits down and watches as the ship grips the invisible wave and departs, finally free of this place. The son\u2019s body is flying again among the stars. Was it worth it, then? The sin, the pain, the sacrifice? The bargain? Y\u00e1nnis pictures the icon of Panay\u00eda in the prayer room, the soft light of the candles, the silent, ancestral bones. He whispers his wife\u2019s name, again and again, like a prayer. \u201cL\u00e9na, L\u00e9na, L\u00e9na.\u201d\n Then he makes the sign of the cross for the last time and bids everything farewell.\n Here I am, he thinks. Not Moriah, after all. Not even Aulis.\n Y\u00e1nnis takes in the barren landscape. The surface of the planet is ragged and marked by hundreds of craters, not unlike Earth\u2019s old moon. A place of much violence. A broken place.\n Then, he notices it. For the first time in his life, everything is silent. There are no birds here.\n Nothing like my Pl\u00e1tres.\n \u201cAnd just what is Pl\u00e1tres?\u201d he recites. \u201cAnd this island, who knows it?\u201d\n Not even the ancestral poet had dared answer that.\n He closes his eyes. For a moment, he thinks of praying, but he pushes through the reflex. Instead, he picks up his bouzouki. He wonders if the first Bostantz\u00f3glou to have owned it ever thought it would end up on a nomad planet, millions of kilometers from Earth.\n Y\u00e1nnis brings the instrument close to his torso, traces the ribs of its hollow body with his fingers. It feels strange in his arms now, lighter. He places his hands on the neck of the bouzouki and fumbles with the strings, his fingers clumsy in the protective layer of his suit.\n He plays a chord. There is no sound, of course. Not here. There is no more music to be made by these hands. These hands, my hands. They\u2019ve already played one more song than he\u2019d expected. It should be enough. He holds his breath and listens, wishing for the song of nightingales.\n He tries another silent chord.\n Natalia Theodoridou is a media & cultural studies scholar, the winner of the 2018 World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction, and a Clarion West graduate (class of 2018).

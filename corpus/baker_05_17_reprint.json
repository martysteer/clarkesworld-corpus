This was difficult, as they were bare, painted bright blue, and court custom dictated he raise his eyes no higher than her knees, where (she being a lady of advanced years) they happened to be resting, like a pair of elderly robins.\nHe twisted his hat in his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how it happened, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d The Living Boudicca, Andraste Twdwr, high queen of Greater Brithan, leaned back. \u201cWe find that hard to believe. You were defrocked for imagining, as we have heard.\u201d She nodded at her chief druid, Volsinghome.\nVolsinghome smiled balefully. \u201cExpelled, madam. For having the temerity to imagine he could improve the sacred texts.\u201d\n\u201cIt was only the hymns,\u201d said Will. \u201cI made them scan. And, er, adjusted the imagery a little.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, having blasphemed, you were sent from the sacred island in disgrace, and now you damn your soul by persuading weak-minded fools to abandon our ancient gods\u2014\u201d Volsinghome\u2019s tirade was cut short as the queen raised her hand.\n\u201cWe will thank you to remember, little druid, that it has pleased us to welcome strangers and their faiths. And if it pleases us, it pleases our gods.\u201d She fixed her gimlet stare on Will once more. \u201cNow, boy. Tell me how it was my son-in-law was found dead in the temple of Glycon.\u201d\nHe had been working Temple Street, minding the horses of wealthy worshippers. Will found that a smile and a bow as he handed back the reins might earn him a thrown copper. However, a smile, a bow, and an apt quotation from Homer\u2014or Catullus, or the Mahabharata, or the Avesta, depending on the place from which the patron had emigrated\u2014got him silver at least, and the patrons remembered him. Now and again patrons gathered around and challenged him to other tricks of memory, and of course he could recite as much as they wanted of anything he knew.\nBusker economies being precarious at best, his fellows on the street had suffered from the competition. One afternoon, after holding a crowd spellbound with the Thebaid, Will was gleefully scooping coins from the pavement into his hat when he encountered four pairs of feet planted across the remainder of his earnings. He looked up, and his heart sank.\nThere stood Wat the Fire-eater, and Bran the Juggler, and Empidocles who did sleight-of-hand tricks, and most notably there stood Soumaoro the African Balladeer, who was seven feet tall and wore a model of Cleopatra\u2019s barge in his wild hair. When singing, he would sway his head in such a manner that the barge rocked to and fro, exactly as though it sailed black foaming seas, to such striking effect that until lately he had been the top earner in the street.\n\u201cYou. Shaxpur,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hear there are lots of people who appreciate poetry on the other side of the river. We think you should go there.\u201d He jerked a thumb in the direction of Southwark. Will blinked up at him.\n\u201cWhy, certainly, gentlemen,\u201d he said, knowing better than to argue. \u201cIf you\u2019ll just step to one side so I can collect the rest of the take, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\n\u201cTake what you have and go,\u201d said Bran, smacking one of his juggling clubs against his thigh with a meaningful look. He picked up a silver drachma with his toes, flipped it into the air, and caught it with his free hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll collect the rest.\u201d\n\u201cLook, I earned that\u2014\u201d said Will, and broke off as he saw the dagger in Wat\u2019s hand.\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever paid dues to the Guild of Street Entertainers,\u201d said Soumaoro. \u201cDruid. How many weeks has he been peddling his act on our street, boys?\u201d\nWill was calculating his chances of escape when the Fates threw him a crust. A pair of arms encircled him from behind and a voice, heavily accented, screamed next to his ear: \u201cBeware! This man is touched by all the gods! He has been chosen for a momentous destiny!\u201d\nWill turned his head and looked into the shawl-draped face of a fat man. He had wild bulging eyes and an immense mustache. The man screamed again. \u201cMomentous destiny, I said! Leave the money, my friend!\u201d\n\u201cFortunate mortal!\u201d chimed in a second voice. Will swiveled his eyes and saw another man to his left, young, tall, and handsome, with a mane of fair hair. \u201cBeloved of the gods!\u201d\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d said Soumaoro, scowling.\n\u201cWhy, friend, this is Scorilo, the famed Dacian soothsayer,\u201d said the tall youth. Will meanwhile felt himself being dragged backward by the fat man, and the youth stepped in front of them. \u201cLook! Riches!\u201d He held up a fistful of coins and opened his hand. As the members of the Guild of Street Entertainers scrambled for the money, Will\u2019s rescuers hurried him away.\nIn a sad-looking Roman taverna, over bowls of wine, they had made him their offer.\n\u201cWe are victims of religious persecution,\u201d explained Alazon, the youth.\n\u201cWe fled the crushing grip of Caesarion-imposed Mithraic monotheism to the pantheistic sanctuary of your green and pleasant land, so graciously offered by your beautiful Queen of Queens,\u201d said Scorilo.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching you for days now,\u201d said Alazon. \u201cLook, we said to each other, here\u2019s an educated Brithon! Knows the classics by heart, speaks eight languages fluently, lovely speaking voice.\u201d\n\u201cYet, incredibly, he seems to be down on his luck!\u201d said Scorilo. \u201cHow, we asked ourselves, can this possibly be?\u201d\nBriefly, Will related the series of misunderstandings that had gotten him booted out of the druid seminary at Mona, which did, in fact, amount to more than a few rewritten hymns. When he had finished, his new friends looked at each other and smiled.\n\u201cMocking the bards, faking divine possession, and poaching! Can it be you haven\u2019t a great deal of respect for the gods?\u201d said Scorilo.\n\u201cThat might be the case,\u201d said Will sourly. \u201cYet see, gentlemen, the wages of impiety. I\u2019m as talented a man as you\u2019ll find in a long summer\u2019s day; I can pull your tooth, cure your fever, paint your likeness, sit in judgment on your small claims, sing you all the lays of old Rome, foretell the hour of your death, and recite a solemn prayer over your ashy bones. And, thanks to that unwise moment of levity at High Bard Amaethon\u2019s expense, I now scramble to earn my bread in the gutter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if impiety could be made to pay?\u201d inquired Scorilo, with a coy leer.\n\u201cWhat if, indeed? I\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\u201cWell then!\u201d Scorilo leaned across the table. \u201cMy colleague and I operated a profitable concern in Pergamum, before Caesarion XXIII sent in his priests. Given the nature of our business, it seemed like a good time to relocate.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the nature of your business was\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cSoothsaying, what else?\u201d said Alazon. \u201cDivinations, relaying messages from the dead, that sort of thing. Scorilo\u2019s a true prophet! Runs in the family. His great-great-several-times-great-grandfather was the one who persuaded Julius Caesar to stay home, the day Mark Antony was assassinated.\u201d\n\u201cWe like to think of ourselves as purveyors of consolation,\u201d said Scorilo. \u201cNow, your cosmopolitan London seems a perfect place to set up shop. Unfortunately, we are strangers. We would benefit by having a native-born partner in our enterprise to advise us concerning local laws, customs, and so forth. You might be that partner.\u201d\n\u201cCould you be a little more explicit about the enterprise?\u201d\n\u201cA time-honored dodge known in the trade as running the snake,\u201d said Scorilo. \u201cIntroducing to an unenlightened populace the profitable worship of the great god Glycon.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who would Glycon be?\u201d inquired Will.\nAlazon smiled. From under his cloak he drew a small basket with a lid, and opening it he drew forth a tiny snake. He set it on the table. \u201cSay hello, Glycon.\u201d\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Glycon.\nWill gaped at it, until he remembered Enoch the Ventriloquist, who used to ply Temple Street with his talking dog. He grinned. \u201cTell me more,\u201d he said.\nThere were a few former residences of Roman gods down at the eastern end of Temple Street. Of late years, with the increasing turmoil on the continent, the Roman immigrant population had increased; but they tended to worship at a pantheon over in Knightsbridge nowadays. Therefore the owner of the old shrine to Apollo was happy to sell it at any price, given that the roof leaked and the foundation had cracked. He pocketed the money Will paid him and went his way chuckling. Will and his associates moved in and made their preparations.\nThe busy hour of the morning had just come to Watling Street when, seemingly from midair, a naked youth appeared in the middle of the street. He frothed at the mouth, he pranced and tossed his wild hair, he cried out in an unknown language. Ordinarily no Londoner would have looked twice at him\u2014there were plenty of naked madmen in Brithan\u2014but this madman was so extraordinarily well endowed, and his wild hair so abundant, that not a few matrons forgot about shopping and stared, rapt. Tradesmen and idlers followed suit, and soon there was a crowd.\nAs crowds will, they followed him down Watling to Temple Street, where he mounted the steps of the old shrine to Apollo and stood straight. Raising his arms above his head, he began to speak coherently. Will, who had discreetly joined the crowd, prepared to translate for him; but a Greek oil merchant beat him to it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling us a new god is born!\u201d he said. \u201cHe says, uh, we\u2019re three-times-blessed. He says the great god . . . Glycon, son of Asklepios, grandson of Apollo, has come to live among us. In this very temple. And . . . he himself is the god\u2019s priest.\u201d\n\u201cHe does look like Apollo,\u201d said an elderly wine merchant.\nAlazon, for it was he, sprang down from the steps and scrabbled in the mud at the base of the temple\u2019s foundation. With a triumphant cry, he held aloft a goose egg. Running back up the steps with it, he broke it open and stared a moment into the shell; then held up the little snake that had been hidden inside, coiling and twisting on his fingers as the morning sunlight warmed it.\nThe crowd murmured. Will shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle!\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d cried Scorilo, from the other side of the crowd. \u201cA miracle!\u201d\nThe crowd took up the cry and repeated it. Scorilo began to froth at the mouth and shriek, babbling; Will slipped a piece of soapwort root into his mouth and, chewing briskly, produced a fine lather; then he ran to the steps, where he proceeded to fall as in a frenzy and deliver the same message in eight languages, one after another:\n\u201cThe god speaks! He bids you return here tomorrow at the same hour! He will have an important message for you then, but now he is weary from his journey into this world and would rest!\u201d\nThis impressed the crowd to no end, for Will was clearly a native-born Brithon. Alazon turned and, with a graceful flash of his buttocks, bore the snake godling into the depths of the old shrine.\nIt was a much bigger crowd the next day, and accordingly a much bigger snake was produced for them\u2014a python purchased from a Bharati sailor, so docile and well-trained, it would submit to wearing a false head made of painted canvas, with a human face and flowing wig. Alazon, whose body had been colored gold with a liberal application of turmeric rubbed into his skin, sat on the high dais in the shadowed rear of the temple, with the snake twined about his body.\nWill and Scorilo, divinely chosen acolytes, admitted the curious throng. When the temple was full they closed the street doors, which threw the place into stygian gloom; one dim oil lamp flickered above the dais, so it was almost impossible to see the snake clearly. Yet it was plain he was a living creature, as the flamelight winked now and then on a slowly moving coil.\n\u201cGood people!\u201d Will raised his hands. \u201cBehold how Great Glycon has grown, in one day! Soon he will be able to speak to you directly. Until that time he has appointed us to make his intentions known. True son of Asklepios, he comes to heal and to advise you with gifts of prophecy. Pleasing to him are votive offerings of gold and silver. Great Glycon accepts all currencies in any denomination.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I, his prophet, carry messages!\u201d Scorilo sprang up beside the dais. He had circled his eyes with soot, so as to make their stare even more startling, and he swept the crowd with his wide gaze. His voice echoed like rolling thunder. \u201cHear me! Great Glycon says there is a man here who has committed infidelities! If he is to avoid detection, he must purify himself in the sacred waters of Glycon\u2019s pool and make an offering of gold! Yes! You! Great Glycon knows your name!\n\u201cGreat Glycon says further that there is a woman here who wishes to conceive a child! If she will come in private to the sanctuary at nightfall, with an offering of silver, Great Glycon will ease her sorrows. Yes! You, dear lady! And the man who has received a troublesome letter recently . . . and the man whose son is not sufficiently respectful . . . and you, the woman whose daughter loves an unsuitable young man!\n\u201cGreat Glycon has counsel for each of you. Do not wait, but come soon to make offerings!\u201d\nThe golden stream began to flow that very night, and in a matter of six months Will was richer than he\u2019d ever been in his life.\nScorilo had improvised suitably general prophecies to keep people coming in until they had enough cash to remodel the temple. The back wall had been knocked out and a sanctum sanctorum built beyond, even more dimly lit. There Great Glycon was installed, or rather the articulated puppet-head Will built for him, wonderfully realistic if seen in the dim light of the temple and from a respectful distance. There were besides yards and yards of snake body, painted canvas stuffed out with bombast, which could be made to move by various means.\nSeveral steam-operated devices were installed, old stage tricks to miraculously open the inner sanctum\u2019s doors or provide a battery of awe-inspiring sound effects. The scummed-over reflecting pool at the rear of the temple precinct was cleaned out and stocked with water lilies and Cathay carp.\n\u201cAnd we ought to build a dormitory back there,\u201d said Will, one night as they sat around a table, opening sealed prayers to Glycon.\n\u201cDormitory? What for?\u201d Alazon held the blade of his knife in the lamp flame, then slid it under the wax seal and popped it off intact. Will looked at him in surprise.\n\u201cSo that supplicants can sleep back there and have their dreams interpreted next morning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it was done in the temples of Asklepios. You\u2019re a Greek! Surely you knew that.\u201d\nAlazon shrugged. \u201cHe was obliged to leave his native land at an early age, to escape the tyranny of the One True Faith,\u201d Scorilo explained. \u201cSo his knowledge of the old Olympians is necessarily imperfect. It\u2019s not a bad idea, though, my learned colleague. \u2018Dream interpretation available with a slightly higher donation! Enjoy a spiritually refreshing night as Glycon\u2019s guest!\u2019\u201d\nAlazon, reading the prayer he had opened, snickered. \u201cListen to this one. \u2018O Great Glycon, I am subjected to ridicule by my wife and business associates because of my baldness. Please grant that my hair grows again and I will offer you a golden ring set with a perfect amethyst.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cPoor bastard,\u201d said Will ruefully. He took the scroll without reading it\u2014indeed he could not read, but had memorized its request\u2014and re-affixed the seal. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name on this one?\u201d\n\u201cGeoffrix Thorkettle.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of Brithons as converts now,\u201d said Scorilo. \u201cYour druids aren\u2019t going to be happy about that, eh? Do we need to offer them a bribe?\u201d\nWill shrugged. \u201cWe might. They\u2019ll hate us anyway, but there\u2019s nothing they can do. Not as long as Andraste\u2019s on the throne.\u201d\n\u201cGods save the queen!\u201d said Scorilo.\nWill, standing before Glycon\u2019s sanctuary, swayed slightly and put his hand to his forehead.\n\u201cThe god speaks to me . . . he has a message for . . . for Geoffrix Thorkettle!\u201d\n\u201cOi!\u201d A man wearing a hood raised his head and pushed his way to the front of the crowd. Will put out his hand and Scorilo gave him the appropriate scroll.\n\u201cHere is your still-sealed petition, its contents known only to yourself and divine Glycon,\u201d Will intoned. He gave the scroll to Master Thorkettle. \u201cDivine Glycon says: \u2018Mortal, bear patiently what the gods have seen fit to inflict. Caesar himself suffered your state without complaint, and him the gods favored to father pharaohs.\u2019 Praise Glycon!\u201d\n\u201cThanks be to Great Glycon,\u201d said the man, looking dejected.\n\u201cAnd now . . . \u201d Will summoned the next name from his memory. \u201cThe Divine One informs me\u2014\u201d He broke off, hearing the shouts and seeing the crowd surge to avoid the oncoming chariot. Four milk-white mares drew it, led by a man in the royal livery who shouted:\n\u201cWay there! Way for the most puissant Princess Arnemetia Dudasmede! Her consort, Anextiomarus, earl of Gloucester! Her son, Vellocatus!\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d said Scorilo out of the side of his mouth, and in Greek.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the queen\u2019s second daughter,\u201d replied Will in the same wise. \u201cQuick! Go tell Alazon. She\u2019ll want to talk to the god himself.\u201d\nThe chariot pulled up before the temple steps. Glycon\u2019s supplicants cleared a path for the princess, falling to their knees as she ascended; Will himself dropped to his knees, fists clenched until he heard the faint thump that meant that Alazon had scrambled into the compartment under Glycon\u2019s sanctuary and thrust his arm up the god\u2019s neck.\n\u201cWelcome, gracious Princess! Welcome, noble princes to the sanctuary of Divine Glycon!\u201d Will prostrated himself.\n\u201cYou may rise,\u201d said Princess Arnemetia, with a wave of her hand. Being only a princess, she was not obliged to go naked or paint herself blue, nor had she her mother\u2019s flaming hair; she was a sallow brunette. Her son, a sullen-looking teenager, had inherited her looks and a clubfoot besides. The prince consort was a florid man in early middle age, puffing slightly from climbing the stairs. Heart disease, Will thought, studying him with a druidic eye. Aloud he said:\n\u201cHow may we priests of Glycon serve, madam?\u201d\n\u201cWe would consult the god on the matter of our husband\u2019s health,\u201d said the princess. \u201cAnd some few matters concerning our own interest.\u201d\n\u201cPlease step within,\u201d said Will, bowing them into the temple. He shut the doors behind them and presented them to Scorilo. \u201cThis humble servant of the god will lead you in prayers first. Complimentary holy water, brother Scorilo, of course.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Scorilo, rummaging in his purse for coins to feed the vending machines. Will backed out of the royal presences and then ran like a hare behind the drapes concealing the inner sanctum. He paused long enough to make certain Alazon had lit the boilers under the mechanisms, and then scrambled under Glycon\u2019s lair. Spotting Alazon\u2019s feet, he crawled close enough to whisper:\n\u201cIt\u2019s Princess Arnemetia. The husband\u2019s the earl of Gloucester. He\u2019s got progressive heart failure, or I miss my guess. Tell him to drink willow-bark tea for breakfast, hawthorn leaf tea before bed. Got it? And the son\u2019s with them, and he\u2019s got a clubfoot and is known to have seizures, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTell them it\u2019s a gift of the gods because Caesar and Alexander had them,\u201d said Alazon, ducking his head to wink at Will. \u201cGot it. Do I tell her she\u2019s going to inherit the throne?\u201d\n\u201cNo! We could hang for that. Stay away from anything to do with the succession. Just, you know, imply great things will happen and her name will live forever and so on.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s . . . \u201d\n\u201cArnemetia!\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nWill backed out of the crawlspace, got to his feet, and ran back just as the unearthly note sounded that signified the show was about to start. He stepped from behind the curtain into the outer sanctum, where Scorilo was praying with his hands raised and the royal family lip-syncing in an attempt to follow. The sanctuary curtains parted, as if drawn by unseen hands.\n\u201cOur prayers have been heard!\u201d yelled Scorilo, falling to his knees.\nThe great doors swung open of themselves, and there, within a sort of booth, rose Great Glycon. He blinked his startlingly lifelike eyes. He opened his mouth.\n\u201cWelcome, royal Arnemetia, beloved of the gods!\u201d\n\u201cWe are made,\u201d said Alazon smugly, counting out the day\u2019s take. \u201cA royal patron. It\u2019s all nectar from here.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d said Will. \u201cIt all depends on whether or not the princess outlives her sister. Berecyntia, the older one.\u201d\n\u201cWhich one\u2019s going to get the throne when the old lady dies, eh?\u201d said Scorilo.\n\u201cThe older one, of course,\u201d said Alazon, but Will shook his head.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always follow primogeniture here. The princesses may engage in single combat to decide who gets the throne. More likely they\u2019ll make their consorts fight.\u201d\n\u201cBut the throne will pass to the nasty boy in any case, eh?\u201d said Scorilo.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Will. \u201cThere\u2019s Damara, the third sister. She\u2019s still at school. And anyway the boy\u2019s damaged goods; he can\u2019t sit on the throne. It\u2019s our law.\u201d\n\u201cGroups of threes!\u201d Scorilo drew his shawl over his head. \u201cThat\u2019s bad, women in threes. Three Fates. Three Hecates. I feel a foreboding in the cosmic ether.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fish you had for lunch,\u201d said Alazon, and bit a gold piece.\nWith royal favor, Glycon had become more than just another new god; he became fashionable. Courtiers, at least those of Princess Arnemetia\u2019s party, had flocked to the temple in droves. Alazon had found himself with a dozen or so very young admirers of both genders, who were eager to jump into bed with Glycon\u2019s high priest. His attention to their needs spiritual and temporal had left Will and Scorilo to see to running the temple, and unfortunately Scorilo had developed a taste for Brithish cider.\nSo it was primarily Will who had overseen the miracle cures, sitting up at night as supplicants slept in the rear of the temple around the new statue of the god. It was Will who had bowed in the earl of Gloucester, arriving for a private slumber session with the god; it was Will who had made up a sumptuous pallet for Anextiomarus, and dimmed the sanctuary lights, and bid him pleasant dreams. It was Will who sat in the rear chamber, going over the earl\u2019s symptoms (indigestion, toothache, generalized joint pain) in his mind, composing a prescription that could be plausibly worked into the interpretation of whatever dreams the earl would have reported in the morning.\nThough of course he hadn\u2019t reported any, because when Will crept out into the sanctuary at first light, the earl had been lying there stone dead, grinning, with a stonily erect penis and two immense fang marks in his arm.\n\u201cWere you aware,\u201d said Volsinghome, \u201cthat when we autopsied him, we found the distance between the wounds was exactly the distance between the canine teeth of a man? And has not your god a man\u2019s head?\u201d\n\u201cBut Great Glycon is a nice god,\u201d said Will desperately. \u201cWhy would he kill one of his worshippers? Especially a royal one?\u201d\n\u201cFool! How can you pretend to know what foreign gods will do? They cannot be trusted! They have overrun this island with their filthy foreign ways\u2014\u201d Volsinghome\u2019s spittle began to fly. The Living Boudicca looked sidelong at him, and sighed.\n\u201cVolsinghome, you may retire. We would speak with this man alone.\u201d\nGlaring, the high druid stalked from the room. The queen turned back to Will. \u201cListen carefully, priest. We know well our son-in-law was murdered, and by no gods. But you must prove it. You say you were awake in the anteroom by the sanctuary the night long. Did you hear nothing suspicious? Did you leave the antechamber at any time?\u201d\nWill drew on every memory trick the druids had beaten into him on Mona. The night replayed itself for him, at high speed and in perfect detail. \u201cOnly once, ma\u2019am. And that was only to see that all was well with the earl.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I heard . . . \u201d Will\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cBecause he cried out. And there was a splash; I thought he might have gone sleepwalking and stepped in the fish pool.\u201d\n\u201cHad he?\u201d\n\u201cNo. He was sitting up in his bed, rubbing his arm. He lay down again without speaking to me. Then he began to laugh. I thought he\u2019d had a funny dream. I went back into the antechamber. A little later I heard him coughing. I would have gone out again, but it stopped.\u201d\n\u201cWhich arm was he rubbing?\u201d\n\u201cThe right one,\u201d said Will.\n\u201cWhich was the arm that was wounded, my druids tell me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Will hung his head, imagining the noose already around his neck. \u201cThat must have been when he was bitten. But I saw nothing when I looked out, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cHe laughed, you say.\u201d The queen looked opaque, unsmiling. Her hand clenched a moment on her spear. \u201cAnd you use the word bitten. Do you truly think something bit him?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014no, ma\u2019am.\u201d Will dared to look up. \u201cAt least, not Glycon, because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause Glycon is a clever puppet,\u201d said the Living Boudicca. \u201cTush, man, did you think we hadn\u2019t already found out as much?\u201d\nWill fell to his knees. \u201cOh, great Queen, be merciful. We never meant to mock the gods! Only to make money.\u201d\nShe waved him to rise, impatiently. \u201cWhich is an honest desire, compared to what some men lust after. Little man, you have our protection, as far as we may give it. Volsinghome and his party will make political capital of this death, if they can; they will incite the people to fear foreign gods. They cannot see that it is in our interest to shelter fellow polytheists.\u201d\n\u201cYour Majesty is indeed a loving and merciful great mother,\u201d said Will, heart pounding.\n\u201cNo; Volsinghome is a fool,\u201d said the queen. \u201cCaesarion converts with the sword, and his one-God priests are ruthless in suppressing any thought they do not approve. What happens then? The best minds of the east flee his empire in droves. Because we offer them refuge, they bring us their skills, their inventions. If rogues like your accomplices come with them, it makes no odds; our nation grows rich all the same.\n\u201cPerhaps Volsinghome fears that foreign gods are stronger than our own, in which case we don\u2019t think much of his faith,\u201d she added, with a fearsome sneer. \u201cPerhaps he simply dislikes seeing brown faces in the marketplace, or smelling strange spices in the air. Ha! We will not shape our state to suit his delicate nerves. We absorbed his Saxon race and remained Brithan; these hordes too we shall gather in.\n\u201cAnd therefore we have made our decision. We shall announce that it was a man, and no god, who killed the earl.\u201d She pointed her spear at Will. \u201cBut you must furnish us with some plausible proof of murder. What made the splash you heard, little Master Shaxpur?\u201d\nScorilo and Alazon were packing frantically when he returned.\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d\n\u201cDown to the river at midnight,\u201d said Alazon. \u201cWe steal a boat, we go over to Gaul. Coming with us?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Will. \u201cI had an audience with the queen.\u201d He looked around the sanctuary, thinking hard. \u201cHas anybody been out to feed the fish this morning?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Alazon turned to stare at him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all this rain,\u201d said Scorilo, with a groan. \u201cMakes their brains mildew. Where are you going?\u201d For Will had turned and run out to the pool in the rear of the temple precinct. They followed him.\n\u201cOh! Look at that!\u201d cried Scorilo, falling to his knees in dismay. \u201cIt\u2019s an omen! A terrible omen!\u201d\n\u201cDamn!\u201d said Alazon. \u201cThose fish cost a fortune!\u201d\nFor all the red carp in the pool were now floating belly up, quite dead. Will was pacing along the edge of the pool, peering down into the water. He went into the antechamber long enough to fetch a pair of tongs from its fireplace; coming back he knelt on the pool\u2019s coping and, using the tongs, carefully pushed aside the lily pads to look beneath. \u201cAh,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d Alazon ran to his side.\n\u201cThe murder weapon, I think,\u201d said Will. Using the tongs, he drew out a long slender object. It was a tin novelty backscratcher in the shape of an arm and flexed hand, the sort that tourists brought back in hundreds from Cornwall every summer. This one had a twist of thick wire wrapped around the hand, the two sharp ends bent downward. Will pulled his sleeve down to cover his hand and picked it up, swinging it experimentally. It punched two neat holes in the surface of a lily pad, just like fang marks.\nWill peered at the wire points again. They were discolored.\nThe murderer had clearly scaled the rear precinct wall, which was not especially high, and left in the same manner. The following day a body was found floating in the Thames, a thin and ragged man with a cut throat. Oddly, he had not been robbed; he had a golden guinea in his purse.\nThe verdict on both the beggar and the earl was murder by persons unknown.\nStanding at the late earl\u2019s pyre, as Scorilo chanted hastily improvised funeral rites, Will watched the royal family and wondered just how much was known. Princess Arnemetia and her son looked daggers across the flames at Princess Berecyntia and her husband, the earl of Kent, where they stood by Volsinghome. All three were smirking, making no effort to conceal their glee. The queen looked on, impassive, her eyes hooded.\nOddly enough, the temple of Glycon grew more crowded than before. Princess Arnemetia was loud in her unshaken faith. Young Vellocatus let it be known he had spent all his pocket money on most puissant curses, and such a touching act of filial piety was sure to bring his father\u2019s murderers to justice. Before a packed audience of courtiers and celebrity chasers, they knelt together without Glycon\u2019s sanctum and prayed for justice. The great god, stammering a little, was heard to promise that death would swiftly find the wretched sinners who had dared to defame him.\n\u201cYou have an awful lot of murderers in this country, do you know that?\u201d complained Scorilo. Will, who had been composing a new prayer to Glycon as Guardian of Innocent Lambs, looked up, startled.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAnd your cider gives a man a damnable headache too,\u201d said Scorilo, dropping down on the bench beside him and fanning himself. It was two days to Lammas, hot sticky weather. \u201cAll I wanted were some anodyne powders for this hangover. Hermes the Egyptian had a nice little apothecary shop in Silver Street. Had, notice I said. Somebody laid him out beside his mummies last night. The place is all closed off and the street wardens won\u2019t let anybody in. What am I to do about my headache, eh?\u201d\n\u201cWillow-bark tea,\u201d said Will, leaning back again. \u201cYou can get it anywhere.\u201d He was about to close his eyes so he could concentrate on composition when his attention was drawn by the royal messenger, ascending the steps of the temple. \u201cOh, shite\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPriests of Glycon!\u201d The royal messenger brandished his spear. \u201cThe Living Boudicca commands the presence of Master Shaxpur!\u201d\nVolsinghome was just emerging from the audience chamber as Will was ushered in. He wasn\u2019t smiling now; in fact he looked at Will with something like fear as he hurried past him.\nNor was the queen smiling as she received Will. Andraste Twdwr seemed to have aged twenty years in the month since he\u2019d seen her. She looked at him bleakly and said: \u201cYou are a clever little man. I wonder if you are clever enough to solve another murder?\u201d\nThe royal messenger and a brace of royal guards escorted him to the mansion of Princess Berecyntia. Grim-faced street wardens blocked the door, but as they stood aside to let Will enter, there was fear in their eyes too. He was marched in through the house and out to the back garden, which sloped down to the Thames. There was a big pavilion there, its screened windows standing open. In the pavilion was a bed, lately slept in but empty now.\n\u201cThe princess and her lord took their rest here last night, as was their custom in summer\u2019s heat,\u201d said the royal messenger. \u201cThe servants slept in the house. None of them heard anything untoward. At daybreak the earl\u2019s valet came out to wake his master, and found him gone, nor was the princess to be seen.\u201d\nWill was opening his mouth to suggest they had simply gone swimming when he saw the track on the floor of the pavilion, clear in a layer of summer dust. It circled the bed, a strange looping sprawl of a print full of smaller marks . . . scales? It looked something like the track a snake would leave, but a snake of monstrous size.\n\u201cWas it your god devoured them, priest of Glycon?\u201d demanded the valet, who had followed the guards out to the garden.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Will steadily. \u201cBut we were meant to think so.\u201d He squatted to look more closely at the curious print. Here and there beside its length was a little parallel track, not continuous, a thin dragging mark such as might be made by a twig. In some places it paralleled the left side of the main print; in some places it was on the right. Will tugged at his beard, studying the print a moment longer.\nHe rose and looked at the bed itself. Not a drop of blood, but the bed-clothes were in wild disarray: sheets flung aside, pillows here and there, the blanket wadded up on one side of the bed. But nothing on the floor. Nothing to obscure the scuffed print. Will bent down and looked again at the print\u2019s pattern. It reminded him of something . . . he crouched farther and peered under the bed. Gingerly he reached under and pulled close what he saw there, and stared at it a moment.\nIt was a scaled and stubby thing, like a mummified hand with black claws. A brown bone protruded from one end.\nWill stood up abruptly. \u201cYou have been charged to help me solve this murder, haven\u2019t you?\u201d he said to the royal messenger.\n\u201cI have. You agree it\u2019s murder, then?\u201d\n\u201cMost foul,\u201d said Will. \u201cTake me to Silver Street, if you please.\u201d\nIt was early afternoon when he was once again admitted to the presence of the Living Boudicca. He bowed low. She regarded him with a flinty stare.\n\u201cWe see we were not mistaken in our judgment of you,\u201d she said, in a hoarse voice.\n\u201cYou have been told, then, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cWe have. Both of them in a fresh-dug grave in Hampstead. Not a mark on the bodies to show how they died, but the strangest thing: they shared their grave with a stuffed crocodile. A three-legged one, no less.\u201d\nWill nodded. \u201cAnd now I must grieve you further.\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cWe may sorrow, but we doubt we will be surprised. What have you to tell us?\u201d\nWill wondered how best to break the news. \u201cYou may have heard, ma\u2019am, that the crocodile was stolen from an apothecary\u2019s in Silver Street.\u201d\n\u201cWe had. They murdered the poor devil for it, it seems.\u201d\n\u201cSo it seems. He did not die quietly; there would appear to have been a fight. His jars of mummy-dust and his curative powders were knocked over and broken. His murderers left tracks in the dust. There were three of them; two men, both barefoot, and a boy, shod. And the boy\u2019s shoes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShowed that he had a clubbed foot,\u201d said the queen.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Will. \u201cAnd the crocodile was taken to drag along the floor of the pavilion, to make it look as though a great snake had been there.\u201d\nA long silence followed. \u201cWe expect his mother put him up to it,\u201d said the queen at last. \u201cThough he\u2019s poisonous enough to have had the idea on his own.\u201d\nWill cleared his throat. \u201cThere was also evidence, in the shop, that one of the men cut his foot on a broken jar. If the servants\u2019 feet are examined\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. We take your meaning. You have done well, Master Shaxpur.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that we are,\u201d said the Living Boudicca, tapping her fingers on the haft of her spear. \u201cBerecyntia was a murderess. Just as well she was stopped before she made a habit of it.\u201d\n\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d\n\u201cShall we tell you how we became queen, little man?\u201d Andraste Twdwr looked him in the eye. The unaccustomed familiarity unnerved Will, for her gaze was like a spear, but he met it steadily. \u201cI was young, and in those days fair; my sister Genupa was much older, and not so fair. As the years drew on and she bore no children to her husband, she came to envy me my state. Our aunt Magaidh was queen then, growing old.\n\u201cGenupa\u2019s husband lusted after me. The gods know I didn\u2019t want the man; but Genupa caught him trying to kiss me, at a drunken banquet, and she went mad. She challenged me.\n\u201cAunt Magaidh gave us weapons and bid us fight it out. Poor Genupa was no fighter; she rushed at me, screaming, and fending her off I wounded her in the shoulder with my spear\u2019s point. She came at me and I blocked again, and again, and so we circled each other, as Aunt Magaidh looked on in silence.\n\u201cGenupa began to laugh. She laughed, and staggered as though she was drunk. She shouted at me, hateful things, but happily, as though I were crawling in the dust at her feet. At last she tripped on the haft of her own spear and fell sprawling. I stood back and waited for her to rise, but she never rose. I heard her choking and ran to turn her over. She was past rising; she died then and there, grinning like a skull.\n\u201cI stood, weeping. I looked at the point of my spear and saw the poison smeared there, and my aunt said: \u2018She was old and barren, and not so clever as you. This granted her an honorable death. And now there will be no dispute over the succession.\u2019\n\u201cMy aunt died not long after. I inherited her throne and the secret of the poison. It\u2019s rare potent stuff, brewed in the east, reserved for kings. It kills quickly and painlessly. The victim experiences euphoria. You will remember how Arnemetia\u2019s husband laughed, that night, after he\u2019d been wounded. To say nothing of his other symptoms.\u201d The queen smiled bitterly. \u201cI have never kept it; I detest poisoners. But Berecyntia obtained some easily enough, from Caesarion\u2019s ambassador. I made her confess as much.\n\u201cWell, well. What to do now, Master Shaxpur? We have no doubt it will be proved that Arnemetia had her sister killed. And there is the matter of the poor little Egyptian apothecary. Who answers for his blood?\u201d\n\u201cThat is not for me to say, Majesty,\u201d said Will, bowing his head.\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d The queen stared into space. \u201cWe must bear it alone. It\u2019s one thing to kill off a mere consort; another thing entirely to kill your own sister. We will hand her over to the druids, she and the boy. It is good for the people to see that no one is above our justice.\u201d She looked down at Will. \u201cBut we fear Great Glycon has been the cause of too much trouble. We think it were best your friends pack up their puppet and seek their fortunes over in Gaul. You, however, must remain here.\u201d\n\u201cI, Majesty?\u201d Will began to sweat.\n\u201cEven you.\u201d The queen looked at him critically. \u201cYou are not a fool; your wit pleases us. You must not end your days telling fortunes in Gaul. We have another fate in mind for you.\u201d\nA veiled girl entered the room then, and drew back when she saw Will.\n\u201cCome in, girl,\u201d said the Living Boudicca. \u201cWe sent for you an hour since.\u201d\n\u201cI was reading,\u201d said the girl, a little sullenly. \u201cAnd may speak to no man.\u201d\n\u201cThe case is altered, child,\u201d said the queen. \u201cHoly Modron can do with one less nun in Her service. You will be queen after us, now, and this man will be your consort. Look upon him.\u201d\nAffronted, the girl raised her veil and glared at Will. He was already breathless from shock, and now he gasped. Princess Damara was young and fair as her mother had been once, with the same coppery hair. Her eyes, however, were green as the sea. She regarded him steadily a moment, before shrugging.\n\u201cHe\u2019s handsome enough. I don\u2019t mind about his hair. Still, you can\u2019t mean to marry me to a commoner?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said her mother. \u201cThat\u2019s easily fixed. What say you, Master Shaxpur, to an earldom? Oxford, we think. Yes. Ought to suit you nicely.\u201d\nOriginally published in Sideways In Crime, edited by Lou Anders.\nOne of the most prolific new writers to appear in the late '90s, the late Kage Baker made her first sale in 1997, with \"Noble Mold,\" the first of her long sequence of sly and compelling stories of the adventures and misadventures of the time-traveling agents of the Company.

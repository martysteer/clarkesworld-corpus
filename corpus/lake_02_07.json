The kind of child that people stop and look at when we walk down the street, her little hand in mine. The Daddy hand, the cross-the-street hand, the I\u2019m-worried hand that drops away the moment there\u2019s a swing to be swung on or kids with jump ropes or chalk. Little fingers, not so little any more, but still they clutch at me with an echo of that infant monkey grip, don\u2019t-drop-me-from-this-tree-Daddy firm until she runs shrieking into her future.\nAnd I don\u2019t mean beautiful-pretty, either. Though God knows she\u2019s cute enough. I mean charisma to turn your head and a thousand-watt personality that can hold a room full of people. It\u2019s not the RSO\u2019s on the county watch list I worry about. It\u2019s what will become of her. All that raw go-go in one little head and one little heart. And only six years old.\nI\u2019ve painted this kid half a hundred times, photographed her so much I\u2019ve gone through two digital cameras. Elaine doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cQuit screwing around with that stuff,\u201d she tells me.\n\u201cLook, the way the light falls on her face.\u201d\n\u201cSo turn on the lamp.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, hon\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCome on. Pay attention.\u201d Then we\u2019re off in some half-hearted argument about the cats or her friend Lynette\u2019s divorce or who might have swiped the stone chicken out of the back garden and what the hell we could do about it anyway.\nUntil I\u2019m down in the basement, developing black and white or sketching on sheets of foolscap taped to the walls. Ariadne, Ariadne, Ariadne. If I capture my daughter just right, maybe it will be okay to let her go.\nI never did get the point of art jams, not for years. My buddy Russell finally pushed me into one, about a year after my first montage ran in Oregon Alive! \u201cGet out there, Jim. Take some fucking board and a sack of markers and go down to Speed Racer\u2019s. It\u2019s cool, man, I mean, just fucking cool.\u201d\nHe\u2019s a hippie forty years out of time, Russell, with long hair and a taste for women\u2019s underwear\u2014with or without the women still attached\u2014and a sense of purpose when it comes to my life. His own, that\u2019s a different issue, but Russell ain\u2019t married with the most beautiful kid in the world looking him in the eye every day.\nRussell\u2019s been kicking my tail since we were both in our twenties. I still remember sitting in a Denny\u2019s out on I-5 somewhere, on our way to some party down in Salem I\u2019d probably forgotten about before I got home that night. \u201cLook, man, you\u2019ve got a hand a lot of artists would kill for. I\u2019ve seen you whip off napkin sketches of the waitress that got our tab lost. Work.\u201d\nI laughed over the ruins of my Grand Slam. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit, long-hair. Work, my ass. You wouldn\u2019t know the meaning of the word if I fed you the dictionary.\u201d\nHe got real serious for a moment. \u201cI ain\u2019t got your hand, either, Jim.\u201d\n\u201cFuck my hand. I got projects due.\u201d Marketing, bane of everyone\u2019s existence. Someone\u2019s got to write the scripts for those damned calls you get just when you\u2019re sitting down to dinner. That was\u2014and is\u2014me. \u201cHello, Mr. Smith, I\u2019m calling about your long distance service.\u201d\nIf only we could wire our phones to your oven timers, John Q. Public, we\u2019d have it fucking made.\nSo there went the party, and there went some years, and I won and lost a few girlfriends drawing good sketches of them. Some of those sketches a little too good. Elaine got interested after seeing me scribble on someone\u2019s kitchen cabinets with a charcoal briquette one boring Labor Day cookout.\nShe was pretty, petite, cuter than anyone I\u2019d seen in a while. \u201cSo,\u201d this woman says to goofy me, \u201cyou draw anything besides roses?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes.\u201d\nSmiles traded back and forth, and the long slide into marriage began. Who needs an art jam when you\u2019ve got love at home?\nYears come and years go, but children are forever.\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d she says to me one day. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about trees.\u201d\n\u201cPhotosynthesis, baby. Big green air machines.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re weird, Daddy.\u201d\nOr this one: \u201cDaddy, how do I know what I see is real? I know the light hits my eyes and goes into my brain, but is that sidewalk really there? What about that dog?\u201d\nWhat the fuck do I look like, Socrates to her Plato? (See, a liberal arts education is good for something besides writing call scripts and training sales people.) Or maybe Aristotle to her Alexander. This kid\u2019s going to conquer the world some day. Who the hell wouldn\u2019t love her beyond reasonable measure?\nMy heart aches every time I see her. I don\u2019t ever want her to have what I had. Or didn\u2019t have.\nOr whatever.\nGod damn it, I\u2019m an artist, screw the words.\nTimes like this, I go off and draw dark things with claws and teeth and distant eyes and mommy breasts. Then, sometimes, I roll them up, take them out in the yard when Elaine\u2019s not around, and set them on fire.\nBut sometimes, sometimes, I sell them.\nWest Coast Design Review , last August issue. Fourteen hundred bucks for a illustration of my dreams of childhood. Lewis and Clark realized in a Geigeresque biomechanical mode, Sacajawea as a maternal ovoid.\nMost people have to pay for their God damned therapy. I get paid to perform my own.\nPaging Doctor Freud to the studio, there\u2019s an aesthetic emergency in progress.\nRussell: \u201cDraw more. Get out. Mix with the boyz and grrls.\u201d\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m too old for this shit, got a kid to raise. Plus I got to run the early shift tomorrow since Shirl\u2019s out at her aunt\u2019s funeral.\u201d\nRussell: \u201cJim, you\u2019re going to be middle-aged toast soon. You\u2019ve got a gift. Fucking use it.\u201d\nElaine: \u201cFamily comes first.\u201d\nThen I\u2019m back in the basement drawing evil mommy eating her boy over and over again like some tragic Greek hero, and hiding the pictures from my wife until I can burn them.\nOr send them out.\n\u201cDaddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, dad-\u201d\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d\n\u201cLook what I can do.\u201d And she spins a one-handed cartwheel across the basement tile.\nFor the love of God, I\u2019d have to go to the hospital if I tried that. Hell, I couldn\u2019t do that when I was six. Walking in straight lines wasn\u2019t exactly a specialty of mine. Screw cartwheels.\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrific, sweetie.\u201d\n\u201cWill you teach me to walk on my hands?\u201d\n\u201cUh . . . \u201d\nAnd she\u2019s off. The phone rings, upstairs calling. It\u2019s easier than shouting through the floorboards and scaring the cats. \u201cPay attention to her.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on deadline.\u201d A piece for Columbia River Review, Woody Guthrie dying on the cross with his guitar in the hands of a Roman soldier. Not big money, but a nice commission. Could be seen by the right people in Seattle, San Francisco. Could get some prints out of it. I\u2019d been thinking about getting into prints. Russell\u2019s influence.\nThe exasperated sigh. The angry, ticking silence on the open line. The kid hurling herself against the basement door like some angry monomaniacal special ed student instead of the girl genius that she is.\n\u201cI\u2019m busy . . . \u201d\nAnd then I was alone, shit-heel number one for a couple of days around our house.\nSo we were down at Speed Racer\u2019s. Everybody there who wasn\u2019t a drop-in is either too young, cool and good-looking for me, or they were long-established, settled into the scene. I felt like a cross between the new kid on the block and a dirty old man. I mean, I\u2019m sorry, but twenty-somethings in black minis are just too hot for me.\nWhere the fuck have the years gone?\nAt least I managed to get off a few million phone calls along the way. I could have started this stuff in my twenties and saved myself a lot of trouble.\nI would have left right then, but Russell had his fingers pressed hard into my elbow. He was wearing this sequined cocktail dress, which he actually looks pretty good in on account of his narrow ass and long legs, until you see the beard up front.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting over here, Jim,\u201d he says, like I\u2019m the tard.\nThen somebody\u2019s shouting out themes and there\u2019s a fight between two Realists\u2014I think, I never understood what they were screaming except that they both spoke shittier French than I do, merci beaucoup\u2014and somebody was peeling off the biggest damned roll of butcher paper I\u2019ve ever seen and the easels were out.\nSo I went deep. It was like surfing, finding that energy, riding that wave. Mommy\u2019s in the basement, chewing up the innocent, look out boy, she\u2019s gonna get you. Markers squeaking, memories squealing, spiders crawling out of their memory holes. After a while\u2014a couple of hours maybe?\u2014I look up from a place where my scalp\u2019s been tingling and my sweat\u2019s been pouring and I was shaking like I ain\u2019t done since I got over a bad case of being fifteen, and there were about eight people standing in a semicircle behind my chair.\nRussell was just smiling, beer in his hand. The rest of them were . . . well . . .\nI looked down at my drawing board and jumped out of my chair.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d I said, \u201cthat thing would scare a priest.\u201d\nSome sweet young thing in a black mini hugged me and whispered something in my ear I didn\u2019t catch. It was French, and I\u2019m pretty sure so was her tongue. Then there was beer and someone taped my evil-Mommy into the middle of a kaleidoscope of politicians and helicopters and camels and we had a grand old party that went on way past my curfew.\nOn the way home, I wondered what the fuck had just happened to me.\nGranddaddy was an old man when I met him. I think he was born old. He had that tough Texas soul that didn\u2019t give much of shit for anything but Jesus, plowing the hard red dirt, and saving four percent down at the Piggly-Wiggly by arguing the night manager into the ground.\nHe loved me, I know that. I know that like I know the wind loves the Cascade forests. And his love brought lightning from heaven and seven kinds of hell if I lied about who ate the last Hydrox, and the metal end of the belt for being too noisy after seven o\u2019clock. God is watching you, boy. God loves you, but He\u2019s got his eye on you.\nFamily comes first, boy. God took care of His boy, and I\u2019m gonna take care of you the same way.\nFamily first.\n\u201cDaddy, Paulie showed me his penis.\u201d And she dissolved into giggles.\nA moment of panic. Elaine and I had talked about this a lot\u2014we communicated pretty good, except when it really counted. Mommy\u2019s in the basement, but Daddy\u2019s in charge upstairs. \u201cHey, kid, you know that\u2019s not talk we want to hear. His penis is private to him, and your vagina is private to you.\u201d\n\u201cPenis, penis, penis.\u201d Another one-handed cartwheel.\n\u201cSweetie.\u201d\n\u201cPenis?\u201d\nIgnore, ignore, ignore. \u201cSweetie, if he does anything like that again, you need to tell me or Mommy right away.\u201d\n\u201cSilly Daddy, all the boys do it.\u201d\nSo I went and drew some more.\n\u201cYou\u2019re spending too much time in the basement, Jim.\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cSorry.\u201d There was a picture nagging me, a bull mammoth striding down Grand Avenue, stomping the busses and cars into the pavement. But the vehicles would all be brass, or maybe copper, shiny in some weird way that I couldn\u2019t quite figure out yet.\n\u201cIs this important? You know I\u2019m really proud of you, but you need to spend more time with us.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nThe next day, an hour of Lynette\u2019s divorce and what the first grade mothers were up to and when I tried to talk about the problems of rendering metallics, a blank stare.\nWe never talk about my work. My love. My fire.\nThat and we haven\u2019t had sex at all in eleven months. Not half a dozen times in two years or more.\nBut down at Speed Racer\u2019s, the girls like me. And they care about art.\n\u201cFamily, boy,\u201d my grandfather says, stomping his way down Grand Avenue. He\u2019s tall as the Hawthorne Bridge\u2019s draw towers, and he\u2019s got that bulldog face I haven\u2019t seen above ground since 1973. I can see Dad in him, too, the two of them wrapped together in one giant male ancestor.\nI must be dreaming, but I can\u2019t find my fingers for the proverbial pinch.\nWhere the hell was my family when I needed them? Where the hell were the holding hands, keeping me out of the street and free from worry, those long-ago years when the monsters in the basement had gotten real in the life of some kid with my name and face?\n\u201cFamily, boy,\u201d my grandfather says again, and the sky shakes with his voice. His teeth are the hoods of Cadillacs, and the turbines of Bonneville Dam spin in his eyes.\nWhen did Granddaddy become a force of nature, I wonder, as the winds blow me into dark, waiting mouths far below the pavement.\nI won the Meadows Prize. The pre-eminent competition for early-career illustrators. Judged out of Omaha, Nebraska of all places. Russell had badgered me to enter it. Elaine had cheered me on. Ariadne just thought it was funny.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be expressing you the prize money,\u201d said a snippy-polite woman on the telephone. \u201cI do hope you can make it out here to Omaha for the ceremonies.\u201d\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Omaha, center of the nation\u2019s call center industry. What with my career in telemarketing, I\u2019d been to Omaha a hundred times. Why couldn\u2019t they hold the damned awards in Hollywood or something?\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Elaine had said.\n\u201cDaddy won an award surprise,\u201d Ariadne had said.\nSmiling, we flew off to our eventual ruin.\nArt jams. Shows. An early gallery date at a place just outside downtown Seattle. Did you have enough? Did you do enough? Russell, finally dropping away from pushing me because my momentum had gotten ahead of my inertia. Who needs fucking telemarketing anyway? Other than my mortgage holder, I mean.\nAnd the commissions started coming in. People wanted to look at my pictures of the darkness.\nI stopped burning my illustrations.\nI started photographing, drawing, painting Ariadne more and more.\nElaine started complaining about the trips, the distraction, the ride.\nBut I kept getting the sweats and the tingles and that place inside me where light blazed up and cast a shadow on my drawing table until something burned into being. And sometimes that burned thing was good.\nEvery once in a while, it was damned good.\nWho the fuck ever knew I could do this?\nEleven years of marriage and I had to go fall off a cliff over someone else. What the hell was wrong with me? Thirty years in his grave and Granddaddy is shouting even now.\nI\u2019d gone off to San Francisco for a big show on the strength of my Meadows win. My chance to be seen along with some of the great names in the illustration field. People whose work I\u2019d been admiring since I was a kid.\nSome of whom knew my name these days.\nIt was glorious. Tuxedos and two-hundred-dollar bottles of champagne and the art press from New York and L.A. and even Tokyo. I mean, SoHo this ain\u2019t, but there\u2019s layers and layers inside every world.\nWho needs telemarketing?\nThe fire was hot inside me. The world loved me. And she came walking by.\nI won\u2019t tell you who she is. An artist, like me. The rest of it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but hers and mine. And we didn\u2019t get up to any business between us, not serious business at any rate. I know better.\nBarely, at least on my end of the affair.\nBut I walked out with a flute of bubbly in my hand through a cascade of photo flashes into the Mission District night and wondered how the hell my heart had felt free to roam when my head knew far, far better.\nIt was a long drive back to Oregon. Lots of head time.\nThe fire burned in my head, in her eyes, in my hands trembling on the wheel as the miles clicked by and my thoughts spun.\nI called Russell from the car somewhere up around Weed. The hour was very, very small. \u201cI\u2019m hosed, buddy.\u201d\nHe yawned. \u201cTake a number, man. Aren\u2019t you up a little late?\u201d\nI\u2019d thrown the champagne flute out the window a hundred miles ago, but my tongue was still loose. \u201cI\u2019m never going to sleep again. I don\u2019t want to dream.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened? You get arrested or something?\u201d\n\u201cI got success disease, Russell.\u201d\n\u201cSome people have all the luck. Go to sleep, man.\u201d\n\u201cNot at eighty miles an hour.\u201d\n\u201cPull over. Call me tomorrow.\u201d\nI got a room up at the state line, crashed out, didn\u2019t sleep ten minutes the whole night. Four hours later, avoiding Elaine, I called Russell again.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to block your number, man, keep this shit up.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d How many nights had we drunk away his gender issues? \u201cLook, what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d\n\u201cFor one, you make too fucking many phone calls.\u201d\n\u201cSeriously. Russell, dude, I got the fire. The fire\u2019s got me.\u201d\nRussell knew from the fire. We\u2019d talked about it enough. \u201cYeah . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cI either got to dive all the way in or quit this stuff.\u201d\n\u201cUh . . . yeah?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a girl, Russell.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t . . . did you?\u201d\nI hated the way his voice rose. Almost hopeful. \u201cNo,\u201d I snapped. \u201cBut I could have. And that scares me shitless.\u201d\n\u201cUm, man, look, this ain\u2019t exactly a surprise.\u201d\n\u201cIt is to me.\u201d\n\u201cNot to some of us. You\u2019re going somewhere, man. This is your way of finally noticing it.\u201d\nI hung up on him and got back out on the highway. Five more hours of blacktop should do me good.\nItem: I live in a house where I can sit in none of the chairs. They are dainty and lovely and not for me.\nItem: I live in a beautiful house.\nItem: Elaine won\u2019t look at my work, or talk about it.\nItem: I am well-loved.\nItem: I am a fly trapped in tree sap, no longer happy to live in amber.\nItem: I am well-loved.\nItem: My life is on fire.\nItem: I am well-loved.\nItem: I can see those flames in her eyes.\nItem: I have a child. But I married my mother.\nItem: Family, boy. Family first, or you\u2019ll feel the metal end of my belt.\n\u201cSo, how was your trip, Daddy?\u201d Ariadne has her serious, I\u2019m-talking-like-a-grown-up voice.\n\u201cBusy, sweetie.\u201d\nThe phone rings. Upstairs calling. There is strain in Elaine\u2019s voice, irritation barely concealed at my wandering ways. The art jams, the conferences, the shows. San Francisco. \u201cCould you come up here, please, and talk to me.\u201d\nThe Mommy demons with their glittering teeth follow me everywhere now. I carry my basement in my head all the time, and my scalp prickles.\nSpeed Racer\u2019s was pretty quiet on Tuesday morning. I\u2019d skipped out on a loyalty program meeting and two quarterly account reviews.\nLike any of that stuff mattered.\nWaiting for Russell, I suddenly realized I\u2019d been happy being a marketing monkey all these years. Happy until I\u2019d set fire to my life with art.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said. My buddy was wearing a pink Hello, Kitty! top with cupped sleeves and one bra strap showing. This over Bermuda shorts and a pair of Docs so clunky he could have gone stevedoring in them. In Omaha that outfit would have gotten him beaten, then arrested. In Portland no one noticed.\n\u201cHey.\u201d I couldn\u2019t get much more than that out.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the art fire?\u201d\n\u201cBurning.\u201d I\u2019d been doodling a chrome-steel breast on my napkin. The nipple had razor spikes barely sticking above the bumps. I pushed it over to him.\n\u201cYou need a date, man.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI just got here.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. I mean, I\u2019m leaving Elaine.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nThere was a latte-punctuated silence that lasted quite a bit longer than our normal pauses. Finally he filled it. \u201cArt or family, huh?\u201d\n\u201cArt or family. There is middle ground, I guess. Nothing but compromises.\u201d I pushed my face into my hands, as if there were wisdom to be found at the junction between my knuckles and my cheekbones. Talking through my palms, I said, \u201cAnything else will be endless negotiation. I\u2019ve had years of practice stalling what I want and need.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown apart.\u201d I could hear the rustle of his shrug. \u201cIt happens.\u201d\nMy eyes stung. Thank God for concealing fingers. \u201cAriadne. It\u2019s Ariadne.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not running out on your kid, man. You\u2019re running into the fire. She\u2019ll love you for it.\u201d\nSomeday.\nLove yesterday, love tomorrow, love someday. But fire today.\n\u201cCome here, boy.\u201d Granddaddy always smelled of tobacco and sweat, and whatever that old man lotion is they sell down at the drugstore.\nI sat on his lap. It was like climbing a polyester cliff face. Hands bigger than my head closed around my thin wrists.\n\u201cFamily,\u201d he hissed hot in my ear, this man who\u2019d been married to the same woman for going on fifty years and never called her by her first name. \u201cFamily always comes first.\u201d\nYou never knew the fire, Granddaddy. Or if you did, you walked away from it. And sir, with all respect to your seniority in the armies of the dead, I can\u2019t tell you which of those things might be the more sad.\nThere\u2019s never any reason to leave your family behind. When Mom and Dad did it to me and left me with him, I came to swear that I\u2019d never do the same to any child of mine.\nEspecially that beautiful kid with her hand tucked between my fingers.\nNow Daddy\u2019s in the basement, chewing up the innocent.\nThe late Jay Lake was a highly talented and highly prolific writer who during his tragically short career seems to have managed to sell to nearly every market in the business, appearing with short work in Asimov's, Interzone, Tor.com, Clarkesworld, Strange Horizons, Aeon, Postscripts, Electric Velocipede, and many other markets, producing enough short fiction to fill five different collections: Greetings from Lake Wu, Green Grow the Rushes-Oh, American Sorrows, Dogs in the Moonlight, The Sky That Wraps, and, most recently, the posthumously released Last Plane from Heaven. Lake was also an acclaimed and prolific novelist, whose novels were Rocket Science, Trial of Flowers, Mainspring, Escapement, Green, Endurance, The Madness of Flowers, Pinon, and Kalimpura, as well as four chapbook novellas, Death of a Starship, The Baby Killers, The Specific Gravity of Grief, and Love in the Time of Metal and Flesh.

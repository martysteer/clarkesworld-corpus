And any Ruler who rules us from a distance, and unknown to us, is welcome to the job.\u201d\n\u2014L. Frank Baum, The Lost Princess of Oz\nI am not, despite the appearances, fond of crime detection. In the past, it is true, I occasionally accompanied my friend Freya Grindavik as she solved her cases, and admittedly this watsoning gave me some good material for the little tales I have written for the not-very-discriminating markets on Mars and Titan. But after the \u201cCase of the Golden Sphere of the Lion of Mercury,\u201d in which I ended up hanged by the feet from the clear dome of Terminator, two hundred meters above the rooftops of the city, my native lack of enthusiasm rose to the fore. And following the unfortunate \u201cAdventure of the Vulcan Accelerator,\u201d when Freya\u2019s arch-foe Jan Johannsen tied us to a pile of hay under a large magnifying glass in a survival tent, there to await Mercury\u2019s fierce dawn, I put my foot down: no more detecting. That, so to speak, was the last straw.\nSo when I agreed to accompany Freya to the Solday party of Heidi van Seegeren, it was against my better judgment. But Freya assured me there would be no business involved; and despite the obvious excesses, I enjoy a Solday party as much as the next esthete. So when she came by my villa, I was ready.\n\u201cMake haste,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re late, and I must be before Heidi\u2019s Monet when the Great Gates are opened. I adore that painting.\u201d\n\u201cYour infatuation is no secret,\u201d I said, panting as I trailed her through the crowded streets of the city. Freya, as those of you who have read my earlier tales know, is two and a half meters tall, and broad-shouldered; she barged through the shoals of Solday celebrants rather like a whale, and I, pilot-fish-like, dodged in her wake. She led me through a group of Grays, who with carpetbeaters were busy pounding rugs saturated with yellow dust. As I coughed and brushed off my fine burgundy suit, I said, \u201cMy feeling is that you have taken me to view that antique canvas once or twice too often.\u201d\nShe looked at me sternly. \u201cAs you will see, on Solday it transcends even its usual beauty. You look like a bee drowning in pollen, Nathaniel.\u201d\n\u201cWhose fault is that?\u201d I demanded, brushing my suit fastidiously.\nWe came to the gate in the wall surrounding Van Seegeren\u2019s town villa, and Freya banged on it loudly. The gate was opened by a scowling man. He was nearly a meter shorter than Freya, and had a balding head that bulged rather like the dome of the city. In a mincing voice he said, \u201cInvitations?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d said Freya. \u201cWe have permanent invitations from Heidi.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the man said coolly. \u201cMs. Van Seegeren has decided her Solday parties have gotten overcrowded, and this time she sent out invitations, and instructed me to let in only those who have them.\u201d\n\u201cThen there has been a mistake,\u201d Freya declared. \u201cGet Heidi on the intercom, and she will instruct you to let me in. I am Freya Grindavik, and this is Nathaniel Sebastian.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the man said, quite unapologetically. \u201cEvery person turned away says the same thing, and Ms. Van Seegeren prefers not to be disturbed so frequently.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be more disturbed to hear we\u2019ve been held up,\u201d Freya shifted toward the man. \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d\n\u201cI am Sander Musgrave, Ms. Van Seegeren\u2019s private secretary.\u201d\n\u201cHow come I\u2019ve never met you?\u201d\n\u201cMs. Van Seegeren hired me two months ago,\u201d Musgrave said, and stepped back so he could look Freya in the eye without straining his neck. \u201cThat is immaterial, however\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been Heidi\u2019s friend for over forty years,\u201d Freya said slowly, once again shifting forward to lean over the man. \u201cAnd I would wager she values her friends more than her secretaries.\u201d\nMusgrave stepped back indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI have my orders! Good day!\u201d\nBut alas for him, Freya was now standing well in the gateway, and she seemed uninclined to move; she merely cocked her head at him. Musgrave comprehended his problem, and his mouth twitched uncertainly.\nThe impasse was broken when Van Seegeren\u2019s maid Lucinda arrived from the street. \u201cOh, hello, Freya, Nathaniel. What are you doing out here?\u201d\n\u201cThis new Malvolio of yours is barring our entrance,\u201d Freya said.\n\u201cOh, Musgrave,\u201d said Lucinda. \u201cLet these two in, or the boss will be mad.\u201d\nMusgrave retreated with a deep scowl. \u201cI\u2019ve studied the ancients, Ms. Grindavik,\u201d he said sullenly. \u201cYou need not insult me.\u201d\n\u201cMalvolio was a tragic character,\u201d Freya assured him. \u201cRead Charles Lamb\u2019s essay concerning the matter.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly will,\u201d Musgrave said stiffly, and hurried to the villa, giving us a last poisonous look.\n\u201cOf course, Lamb\u2019s father,\u201d Freya said absently, staring after the man, \u201cwas a house servant. Lucinda, who is that?\u201d\nLucinda rolled her eyes. \u201cThe boss hired him to restore some of her paintings, and get the records in order. I wish she hadn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe bell in the gate sounded. \u201cI\u2019ve got it, Musgrave,\u201d Lucinda shouted at the villa. She opened the gate, revealing the artist Harvey Washburn.\n\u201cSo you do,\u201d said Harvey, blinking. He was high again; a bottle of the White Brother hung from his hand. \u201cFreya! Nathaniel! Happy Solday to you\u2014have a drink?\u201d\nWe refused the offer, and then followed Harvey around the side of the villa, exchanging a glance. I felt sorry for Harvey. Most of Mercury\u2019s great collectors came to Harvey\u2019s showings, but they dissected his every brushstroke for influences, and told him what he should be painting, and then among themselves they called his work amateurish and unoriginal, and never bought a single canvas. I was never surprised to see him drinking.\nWe rounded the side of the big villa and stepped onto the white stone patio, which was made of a giant slab of England\u2019s Dover cliffs, cut out and transported to Mercury entire. Malvolio Musgrave had spoken the truth about Heidi reducing the size of her Solday party: where often the patio had been jammed, there were now fewer than a dozen people. I spotted George Butler, Heidi\u2019s friend and rival art collector, and Arnold Ohman, the art dealer who had obtained for many of Mercury\u2019s collectors their ancient masterpieces from Earth. As I greeted them Freya led us all across the patio to the back wall of the villa, which was also fronted with white slabs of the Dover cliffs. There, all alone, hung Claude Monet\u2019s Rouen Cathedral\u2014Sun Effect. \u201cLook at it, Nathaniel!\u201d Freya commanded me. \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d\nI looked at it. Now you must understand that, as owner of the Gallery Orientale, and by deepest personal esthetic conviction, I am a connoisseur of Chinese art, a style in which a dozen artfully spontaneous brushstrokes can serve to delineate a mountain or two, several trees, a small village and its inhabitants, and perhaps some birds. Given my predilection, you will not be surprised to learn that to look at the antique rectangle of color that Freya so admired was to risk damaging my eyes. Thick scumbled layers of grainy paint scarcely revealed the cathedral of the title, which wavered under a blast of light so intense that I doubted Mercury\u2019s midday could compete with it. Small blobs of every color served to represent both the indistinct stone and a pebbly sky, both were composed of combinations principally of white, yellow, and purple, though as I say every other color made an appearance.\n\u201cStunning,\u201d I said, with a severe squint. \u201cAre you sure this Monet wasn\u2019t a bit nearsighted?\u201d\nFreya glared at me, ignoring Butler\u2019s chuckles. \u201cI suppose your comment might have been funny the first time you made it. To children, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cBut I heard it was actually true,\u201d I said, shielding my eyes with one hand. \u201cMonet was nearsighted, and so, like Goya, his vision affected his painting\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI should hope so,\u201d Harvey said solemnly.\n\u201c\u2014so all he could see were those blobs of color; isn\u2019t that sad?\u201d\nFreya shook her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t get a rise out of me today, Nathaniel. You\u2019ll have to think up your dinner conversation by yourself.\u201d\nMomentarily stopped by this riposte, I retired with Arnold Ohman to Heidi\u2019s patio bar. After dialing drinks from the bartender we sat on the blocks of Dover cliffs that made up the patio\u2019s outer wall. We toasted Solday, and contemplated the clouds of yellow talc that swirled over the orange tile rooftops below us. For those of you who have never visited it, Terminator is an oval city. The forward half of the city is flat, and projects out under the clear dome. The rear half of the oval is terraced, and rises to the tall Dawn Wall which supports the upper rim of the dome, and shields the city from the perpetually rising sun. The Great Gates of Terminator are near the top of the Dawn Wall, and when they are opened shafts of Sol\u2019s overwhelming light spear through the city\u2019s air, illuminating everything in a yellow brilliance. Heidi van Seegeren\u2019s villa was about halfway up the terraced slope; we looked upon gray stone walls, orange tile roofs, and the dusty vines and lemon trees of the terrace gardens that dotted the city. Outside the dome the twelve big tracks of the city extended off to the horizon, circling the planet like a slender silver wedding band. It was a fine view, and I lifted my glass remembering that Claude Monet wasn\u2019t there to paint it. For sometimes, if you ask me, reality is enough.\nOhman downed his drink in one swallow. Rumor had it that he was borrowing heavily to finance one of his big Terran purchases; it was whispered he was planning to buy the closed portion of the Louvre\u2014or the Renaissance room of the Vatican museum\u2014or Amsterdam\u2019s Van Gogh collection. But rumors like that circulated around Arnold continuously. He was that kind of dealer. It was unlikely any of them were true; still, his silence seemed to reveal a certain tension.\n\u201cLook at the way Freya is soaking in that painting you got for Heidi,\u201d I said, to lift his spirits. Freya\u2019s face was within centimeters of the canvas, where she could examine it blob by blob; the people behind her could see nothing but her white-blond hair. Ohman smiled at the sight. He had brought the Monet back from his most recent Terran expedition, and apparently it had been a great struggle to obtain it. Both the English family that owned it and the British government had had to be paid enormous sums to secure its release, and only the fact that Mercury was universally considered humanity\u2019s greatest art museum had cleared the matter with the courts. It had been one of Arnold\u2019s finest hours.\nNow he said, \u201cMaybe we should pull her away a bit, so that others can see.\u201d\n\u201cIf both of us tug on her it may work,\u201d I said. We stood and went to her side. Harvey Washburn, looking flushed and frazzled, joined us, and we convinced Freya to share the glory. Ohman and Butler conferred over something, and entered the villa through the big French doors that led into the concert room. Inside, Heidi\u2019s orchestra rolled up and down the scales of Moussorgsky\u2019s Hut of Baba Yaga. That meant it was close to the time when the Great Gates would open (Heidi always gets inside information about this).\nSure enough, as Moussorgsky\u2019s composition burst from The Hut of Baba Yaga into The Great Gates of Kiev, two splinters of white light split the air under the dome. Shouts and fanfares rose everywhere, nearly drowning the amplified sound of our orchestra. Slowly the Great Gates opened, and as they did the shafts of light grew to thick buttery gold bars of air. By their rich, nearly blinding glare, Heidi van Seegeren made her first entrance from her villa, timing her steps to the exaggerated Maazel ritard that her conductor Hiu employed every Solday when Pictures at an Exhibition was performed. This ritard shifted the music from the merely grandiose to the utterly bombastical, and it took Heidi over a minute to cross her own narrow patio; but I suppose it was not entirely silly, given the ritual nature of the moment, and the flood of light that was making the air appear a thick, quite tangible gel. What with the light, and the uproar created by the keening Grays and the many orchestras in the neighborhood, each playing their own overture or fanfare (the Coriolan came from one side of us, the 1812 from the other), it was a complex and I might even say noisy esthetic moment, and the last thing I needed was to take another look at the Monet monstrosity, but Freya would not have it otherwise.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen it when the Great Gates are opened,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the whole point in bringing you here today.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Actually I barely saw anything; as Freya had guided me by the arm to the painting I had accidentally looked directly at the incandescent yellow bars of sunlight and brilliant blue afterimages bounced in my sight. I heard rather than saw Harvey Washburn join us. Many blinks later I was able to join the others in devoting my attention to the big canvas.\nWell. The Monet positively glowed in the dense, lambent air; it gave off light like a lamp, vibrating with a palpable energy of its own. At the sight of it even I was impressed.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I admitted to Freya and Harvey, \u201cI can see how precisely he placed all those little chunks of color, and I can see how sharp and solid the cathedral is under all that goo, but it\u2019s like Solday, you know, it\u2019s a heightened effect. The result is garish, really; it\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is a painting of midday,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cAnd as you can see, midday can get pretty garish.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is Terminator! The Grays have put a lot of talc in the air to make it look this way!\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Freya demanded impatiently. \u201cStop thinking so much, Nathaniel. Just look at it. See it. Isn\u2019t it beautiful? Haven\u2019t you felt things look that way sometimes, seeing stone in sunlight?\u201d\n\u201cWell . . . \u201d And, since I am a strictly honest person, if I had said anything at all I would have had to admit that it did have a power about it. It drew the eye; it poured light onto us as surely as the beams of sunlight extending from the gates in the Dawn Wall to the curved side of the clear dome.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Freya demanded.\n\u201cWell yes,\u201d I said. \u201cYes I see that cathedral front\u2014I feel it. But there must have been quite a heat wave in old Rouen. It\u2019s as if Monet had seen Terminator on Solday, the painting fits so well with this light.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Freya said, but her left eye was squinted, a sign she was thinking.\nHarvey said, \u201cWe make the conditions of light in Terminator, and so it is an act of the imagination, like this painting. You shouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are similarities: We value this light because the old masters created it on their canvases.\u201d\nI shook my head, and indicated the brassy bedlam around us. \u201cNo. I believe we made this one up ourselves.\u201d\nFreya and Harvey laughed, with the giddiness that Solday inspires.\nSuddenly a loud screech came from inside the villa. Freya hurried across the patio into the music room, and I followed her. Both of us, however, had forgotten the arrangements that Heidi made on Soldays to cast the brilliant light throughout her home, and as we ran past the silenced orchestra into a hallway we were blasted by light from a big mirror carefully placed in the villa\u2019s central atrium. Screams still echoed from somewhere inside, but we could only stumble blindly through bright pulsing afterimages, retinal Monets if you will, while unidentified persons bowled into us, and mirrors crashed to the floor. And the atrium was raised, so that occasional steps up in the hallway tripped us.\n\u201cMurder!\u201d someone cried. \u201cMurder! There he goes!\u201d And with that a whole group of us were off down the halls like hounds\u2014blind hounds\u2014baying after unknown prey. A figure leaped from behind a mirror glaring white, and Freya and I tackled it just inside the atrium.\nWhen my vision swam back I saw it was George Butler. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, very politely for a man who had just been jumped on by Freya Grindavik.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask us,\u201d Freya said irritably.\n\u201cMurder!\u201d shrieked Lucinda, from the hallway that led from the atrium directly back to the patio. We jumped up and crowded into the hallway. Just beyond a mirror shattered into many pieces lay a man\u2019s body; apparently he had been crawling toward the patio when he collapsed, and one arm and finger extended ahead of him, still pointing to the patio. Freya approached, gingerly turned the body\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s that Musgrave fellow,\u201d she said, blinking to clear her sight. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, all right. Struck on the head with the mirror there, no doubt.\u201d\nHeidi van Seegeren joined us. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cThat was my question,\u201d George Butler said.\nFreya explained the situation to her.\n\u201cCall the police,\u201d Heidi said to Lucinda. \u201cAnd I suppose no one should leave.\u201d\nI sighed.\nAnd so crime detection ensnared me once again. I helped Freya by circulating on the patio, calming the shocked and nervous guests. \u201cUm, excuse me, very sorry to inform you, yes, sorry\u2014hard to believe, yes\u2014somebody had it in for the secretary Musgrave, it appears\u201d\u2014all the while watching to see if anyone would jump, or turn pale, or start to run when I told them. Then, of course, I had to lead gently to the idea that everyone had gone from guest to suspect, soon to be questioned by Freya and the police. \u201cNo, no, of course you\u2019re not suspected of anything, farthest thing from our minds, it\u2019s just that Freya wants to know if there\u2019s anything you saw that would help,\u201d and so on. Then I had to do the difficult scheduling of Freya\u2019s interviews, at the same time I was supposed to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.\nOh, the watson does the dirty work, all right. No wonder we always look dense when the detective unveils the solutions; we never have the time even to get the facts straight, much less meditate on their meaning. All I got that day were fragments: Lucinda whispered to me that Musgrave had worked for George Butler before Heidi hired him. Harvey Washburn told me that Musgrave had once been an artist, and that he had only recently moved to Mercury from Earth; this was his first Solday. That didn\u2019t give him much time to be hired by Butler, fired, and then hired by Van Seegeren. But was that of significance?\nLate in the day I spoke with one of the police officers handling the case. She was relieved to have the help of Freya Grindavik. Terminator\u2019s police force is small, and often relies on the help of the city\u2019s famous detective for the more difficult cases. The officer gave me a general outline of what they had learned: Lucinda had heard a shout for help, had stepped into the atrium and seen a bloodied figure crawling down the hallway toward the patio. She had screamed and run for help, but only in the hallway was clear vision possible, and she had quickly gotten lost. After that, chaos; everyone at the party had a different tale of confusion.\nFollowing that conversation I had nothing more to do, so I got all the sequestered guests coffee, and helped pick up some of the broken hall mirrors, and passed some time prowling Heidi\u2019s villa, getting down on my hands and knees with the police robots to inspect a stain or two.\nWhen Freya was finished with her interrogations, she promised Heidi and the police that she would see the case to its end\u2014at least provisionally: \u201cI only do this for entertainment,\u201d she told them irritably. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with it as long as it entertains me. And I shall entertain myself with it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said the police, who had heard this before. \u201cJust so long as you\u2019ll take the case.\u201d Freya nodded, and we left.\nThe Solday celebration was long since over; the Great Gates were closed, and once again through the dome shone the black sky. I said to Freya, \u201cDid you hear about Musgrave working for Butler? And how he came from Earth just recently?\u201d For you see, once on the scent I am committed to seeing a case solved.\n\u201cPlease, Nathaniel,\u201d Freya said. \u201cI heard all of that and more. Musgrave stole the concept of Harvey Washburn\u2019s first series of paintings, he blackmailed both Butler and our host Heidi to obtain his jobs from them\u2014or so I deduce, from their protestations, and from certain facts concerning their recent questionable merger that I am privy to. And he tried to assault Lucinda, who is engaged to the cook Delaurence\u2014\u201d She let out a long sigh. \u201cMotives are everywhere.\u201d\nBemused, I said, \u201cIt seems this Musgrave was a thoroughly despicable sort.\u201d\n\u201cYes. An habitual blackmailer.\u201d\n\u201cNothing suggests itself to you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Not only that, but it seems almost every person at the party had a good alibi for the moment of the murder! Oh, I don\u2019t know why I agree to solve these things. Here I am committed to this head-bashing, and my best clue is something that you suggested.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that I had suggested anything!\u201d\n\u201cThere is a fresh perspective to ignorance that can be very helpful.\u201d\n\u201cSo it is important that Musgrave just arrived from Earth?\u201d\nShe laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop in the Plaza Dubrovnik and get something to eat. I\u2019m starving.\u201d\nAlmost three weeks passed without a word from Freya, and I began to suspect that she was ignoring the case. Freya has no real sense of right and wrong, you see; she regards her cases as games, to be tossed aside if they prove too taxing. More than once she has cheerfully admitted defeat, and blithely forgotten any promises she may have made. She is not a moral person.\nSo I dropped by her home near Plaza Dubrovnik one evening, to rouse her from her irresponsible indifference. When she answered the door there were paint smudges on her face and hands.\n\u201cFreya,\u201d I scolded her. \u201cHow could you take up an entirely new hobby when there is a case to be solved?\u201d\n\u201cGenerously I allow you entrance after such a false accusation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you will have to eat your words.\u201d\nShe led me downstairs to her basement laboratory, which extended the entire length and breadth of her villa.\nThere on a big white-topped table lay Heidi van Seegeren\u2019s Monet, looking like the three-dimensional geologic map of some minerally blessed country.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhy is this here?\u201d\n\u201cI believe it is a fake,\u201d she said shortly, returning to a computer console.\n\u201cWait a moment!\u201d I cried. On the table around the painting were rolls of recording chart paper, lab notebooks, and what looked like black-and-white photos of the painting. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nAfter tapping at the console she turned to me. \u201cI mean I believe it\u2019s a fake!\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought art forgery was extinct. It is too easy to discover a fake.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d She waved a finger at me angrily. \u201cYou pick a bad time to say so. It is a common opinion, of course, but not necessarily true.\u201d\nI regarded the canvas more closely. \u201cWhat makes you think this a fake? I thought it was judged a masterpiece of its period.\u201d\n\u201cSomething you said first caused me to question it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou mentioned that the painting seemed to have been created by an artist familiar with the light of Terminator. This seemed true to me, and it caused me to reflect that one of the classic signs of a fake was anachronistic sensibility\u2014that is to say, the forger injects into his vision of the past some element of his time that is so much a part of his sensibility that he cannot perceive it. Thus the Victorians faked Renaissance faces with a sentimentality that only they could not immediately see.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d I nodded sagely. \u201cIt did seem that cathedral had been struck with Solday light, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The trouble is, I have been able to find no sign of forgery in the physical properties of the painting.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAnd after three weeks of uninterrupted chemical analysis, that is beginning to worry me.\u201d\n\u201cBut Freya,\u201d I said, as something occurred to me. \u201cDoes all this have a bearing on the Musgrave murder?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd if not, it is certainly more interesting. But I believe it does.\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cSo what, exactly, have you found?\u201d\nShe smiled ironically. \u201cYou truly want to know? Well. The best test for anachronisms is the polonium 210, radium 226 equilibrium\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease, Freya. No jargon.\u201d\n\u201cJargon!\u201d She raised an eyebrow to scorn me. \u201cThere is no such thing. Intelligence is like mold in a Petri dish\u2014as it eats ever deeper into the agar of reality, language has to expand with it to describe what has been digested. Each specialty provides the new vocabulary for its area of feeding, and gets accused of fabricating jargon by those who know no better. I\u2019m surprised to hear such nonsense from you. Or perhaps not.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said, hands up. \u201cStill, you must communicate your meaning to me.\u201d\n\u201cI shall. First I analyzed the canvas. The material and its weave match the characteristics of the canvas made by the factory outside Paris that provided Monet throughout the painting of the Rouen cathedral series. Both the fabric and the glue appear very old, though there is no precise dating technique for them. And there was no trace of solvents that might have been used to strip paint off a genuine canvas of the period.\n\u201cI then turned to the paint. Follow so far?\u201d she asked sharply. \u201cPaint?\u201d\n\u201cYou may proceed without further sarcasm, unless unable to control yourself.\u201d\n\u201cThe palette of an artist as famous as Monet has been studied in detail, so that we know he preferred cadmium yellow to chromium yellow or Naples yellow, that he tended to use Prussian blue rather than cobalt blue, and so on.\u201d She tapped the flecks of blue at the base of the cathedral. \u201cPrussian blue.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken paint off the canvas?\u201d\n\u201cHow else test it? But I took very small samples, I assure you. Whatever the truth concerning the work, it remains a masterpiece, and I would not mar it. Besides, most of my tests were on the white paint, of which there is a great quantity, as you can see.\u201d\nI leaned over to stare more closely at the canvas. \u201cWhy the white paint?\u201d\n\u201cBecause lead white is one of the best dating tools we have. The manufacturing methods used to make it changed frequently around Monet\u2019s time, and each change in method altered the chemical composition of the paint. After 1870, for instance, the cheaper zinc white was used to adulterate lead white, so there should be over one percent zinc in Monet\u2019s lead white.\u201d\n\u201cAnd is that what you found?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The atomic absorption spectrum showed\u2014\u201d She dug around in the pile of chart paper on the table. \u201cWell, take my word for it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\n\u201cNearly twelve percent. And the silver content for late-nineteenth-century lead white should be around four parts per million, the copper content about sixty parts per million. So it is with this paint. There is no insoluble antimony component, as there would be if the paint had been manufactured after 1940. The X-ray diffraction pattern\u201d\u2014she unrolled a length of chart paper and showed me where three sharp peaks in a row had been penned by the machine\u2014\u201cis exactly right, and there is the proper balance of polonium 210 and radium 226. That\u2019s very important, by the way, because when lead white is manufactured the radioactive balance of some of its elements is upset, and it takes a good three hundred years for them to decay back to equilibrium. And this paint is indeed back to that equilibrium.\u201d\n\u201cSo the paints are Monet\u2019s,\u201d I concluded. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that prove the work authentic?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Freya admitted. \u201cBut as I was doing all this analysis, it occurred to me that a modern forger has just as much information concerning Monet\u2019s palette as I do. With a modern laboratory it would be possible to use such information as a recipe, so to speak, and then to synthesize paints that would match the recipe exactly. Even the radioactively decayed lead white could be arranged, by avoiding the procedures that disrupt the radioactive balance in the first place!\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be terrifically complicated?\u201d\nFreya stared at me. \u201cObviously, Nathaniel, we are dealing with a very, very meticulous faker here. But how else could it be done, in this day and age? Why else do it at all? The complete faker must take care to anticipate every test available, and then in a modern laboratory create the appropriate results for every one of them. It\u2019s admirable!\u201d\n\u201cAssuming there ever was such a forger,\u201d I said dubiously. \u201cIt seems to me that what you have actually done here is prove the painting genuine.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cBut even with these paints made by recipe, as you call them, the faker would still have to paint the painting!\u201d\n\u201cExactly. Conceive the painting, and execute it. It becomes very impressive, I confess.\u201d She walked around the table to look at the work from the correct angle. \u201cI do believe this is one of the best of the Rouen cathedral series\u2014astonishing, that a forger would be capable of it.\u201d\n\u201cThat brings up another matter,\u201d I said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this work have a five-hundred-year-old pedigree? How could a whole history have been provided for it?\u201d\n\u201cGood question. But I believe I have discovered the way. Let\u2019s go upstairs\u2014you interrupted my preparations for lunch, and I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\nI followed her to her extensive kitchen, and sat in the window nook that overlooked the tile rooftops of the lower city while she finished chopping up the vegetables for a large salad.\n\u201cDo you know the painting\u2019s history?\u201d Freya asked, looking up from a dissected head of lettuce.\nI shook my head. \u201cUp until now the thing has not been of overwhelming interest to me.\u201d\n\u201cA confession of faulty esthetics. The work was photographed at the original exhibit in 1895, Durand-Ruel photo 5828 L8451. All of the information appended to the photo fits our painting\u2014same name, size, signature location. Then for a century it disappeared. Odd. But it turned out to have been in the estate of an Evans family, in Aylesbury, England. When the family had some conservation work done on one corner it returned to public knowledge, and was photographed for a dozen books of the twenty-first and twenty-second centuries. After that it slipped back into obscurity, but it is as well documented as any of the series belonging to private estates.\u201d\n\u201cExactly my point,\u201d I said. \u201cHow could such a history be forged?\u201d\nAs Freya mixed the salad she smiled. \u201cI sat and thought about that for quite some time myself. But consider it freshly, Nathaniel. How do we know what we know of the past?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, somewhat at a loss. \u201cFrom data banks, I suppose. And books\u2014documents\u2014historians\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFrom historians!\u201d She laughed. She provided us both with bowls, and sat across from me. As I filled mine she said, \u201cSo we want to know something of the past. We go to our library and sit at its terminal. We call up general reference works, or a bibliographical index, and we choose, if we want, books that we would like to have in our hands. We type in the appropriate code, our printer prints up the appropriate book, and the volume slides out of the computer into our waiting grasp.\u201d She paused to fork down several mouthfuls of salad. \u201cSo we learn about the past using computer programs. And a clever programmer, you see, can change a program. It would be possible to insert extra pages into these old books on Monet, and thus add the forged painting to the record of the past.\u201d\nI paused, a cherry tomato hovering before my mouth. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI searched for an original of any of these books containing photos of our painting,\u201d Freya said. \u201cI called all over Mercury, and to several incunabulists in libraries on Earth\u2014you wouldn\u2019t believe the phone bill I\u2019ve run up. But the original printings of these art volumes were very small, and although first editions probably remain somewhere, they are not to be found. Certainly there are no first editions of these books on Mercury, and none immediately locatable on Earth. It began to seem a very unlikely coincidence, as if these volumes contained pictures of our painting precisely because they existed only in the data banks, and thus could be altered without discovery.\u201d\nShe attended to her salad, and we finished eating in silence. All the while my mind was spinning furiously, and when we were done I said, \u201cWhat about the original exhibit photo?\u201d\nShe nodded, pleased with me. \u201cThat, apparently, is genuine. But the Durand-Ruel photos include four or five paintings that have never been seen since. In that sense the Rouen cathedral series is a good one for a faker; from the first it has never been clear how many cathedrals Monet painted. The usual number given is thirty-two, but there are more in the Durand-Ruel list, and a faker could examine the list and use one of the lost items as a prescription for his fake. Providing a later history with the aid of these obscure art books would result in a fairly complete pedigree.\u201d\n\u201cBut could such an addition to the data banks be made?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be easiest done on Earth,\u201d Freya said. \u201cBut there is no close security guarding the banks containing old art books. No one expects them to be tampered with.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing,\u201d I said with a wave of my fork, \u201cit is baroque, it is byzantine in its ingenuity!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBeautiful, in a way.\u201d\n\u201cHowever,\u201d I pointed out to her, \u201cyou have no proof\u2014only this perhaps overly complex theory. You have found no first edition of a book to confirm that the computer-generated volumes add Heidi\u2019s painting, and you have found no physical anachronism in the painting itself.\u201d\nGloomily she clicked her fork against her empty salad bowl, then rose to refill it. \u201cIt is a problem,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAlso, I have been working on the assumption that Sandor Musgrave discovered evidence of the forgery. But I can\u2019t find it.\u201d\nNever let it be said that Nathaniel Sebastian has not performed a vital role in Freya Grindavik\u2019s great feats of detection. I was the first to notice the anachronism of sensibility in Heidi\u2019s painting; and now I had a truly inspired idea. \u201cHe was pointing to the patio!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cMusgrave, in his last moment, struggled to point to the patio!\u201d\n\u201cI had observed that,\u201d Freya said, unimpressed.\n\u201cBut Heidi\u2019s patio\u2014you know\u2014it is formed out of blocks of the Dover cliffs! And thus Musgrave indicated England! Is it not possible? The Monet was owned by Englishmen until Heidi purchased it\u2014perhaps Musgrave meant to convey that the original owners were the forgers!\u201d\nFreya\u2019s mouth hung open in surprise, and her left eye was squinted shut. I leaped from the window nook in triumph. \u201cI\u2019ve solved it! I\u2019ve solved a mystery at last.\u201d\nFreya looked up at me and laughed.\n\u201cCome now, Freya, you must admit I have given you the vital clue.\u201d\nShe stood up, suddenly all business. \u201cYes, yes, indeed you have. Now out with you, Nathaniel; I have work to do.\u201d\n\u201cSo I did give you the vital clue?\u201d I asked. \u201cMusgrave was indicating the English owners?\u201d\nAs she ushered me to her door Freya laughed. \u201cAs a detective your intuition is matched only by your confidence. Now leave me to work, and I will be in contact with you soon, I assure you.\u201d And with that she urged me into the street, and I was left to consider the case alone.\nFreya was true to her word, and only two days after our crucial luncheon she knocked on the door of my town villa. \u201cCome along,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Arnold Ohman for an appointment; I want to ask him some questions about the Evans family. The city is passing the Monet museum, however, and he asked us to meet him out there.\u201d\nI readied myself quickly, and we proceeded to North Station. We arrived just in time to step across the gap between the two platforms, and then we were on the motionless deck of one of the outlying stations that Terminator is always passing. There we rented a car and sped west, paralleling the dozen massive cylindrical rails over which the city slides. Soon we had left Terminator behind, and when we were seventy or eighty kilometers onto the nightside of Mercury we turned to the north, to Monet Crater.\nTerminator\u2019s tracks lie very close to the thirtieth degree of latitude, in the northern hemisphere, and Monet Crater is not far from them. We crossed Endeavor Rupes rapidly, and passed between craters named after the great artists, writers, and composers of Earth\u2019s glorious past: traversing a low pass between Holbein and Gluck, looking down at Melville and the double crater of Rodin. \u201cI think I understand why a modern artist on Mercury might turn to forgery,\u201d Freya said. \u201cWe are dwarfed by the past as we are by this landscape.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is still a crime,\u201d I insisted. \u201cIf it were done often, we would not be able to distinguish the authentic from the fake.\u201d\nFreya did not reply.\nI drove our car up a short rise, and we entered the sub-mercurial garage of the Monet museum, which is set deep in the southern rim of the immense crater named after the artist. One long wall of the museum is a window facing out over the crater floor, so that the central knot of peaks is visible, and the curving inner wall of the crater defines the horizon in the murky distance. Shutters slid down to protect these windows from the heat of Mercury\u2019s long day, but now they were open and the black wasteland of the planet formed a strange backdrop to the colorful paintings that filled the long rooms of the museum.\nThere were many Monet originals there, but the canvases of the Rouen cathedral series were almost all reproductions, set in one long gallery. As Freya and I searched for Arnold we also viewed them.\n\u201cYou see, they\u2019re not just various moments of a single day,\u201d Freya said.\n\u201cNot unless it was a very strange day for weather.\u201d The three reproductions before us all depicted foggy days: two bluish and underwater-looking, the third a bright burning-off of yellow noontime fog. Obviously these were from a different day than the ones across the room, where a cool clear morning gave way to a midday that looked as if the sun were just a few feet above the cathedral. The museum had classified the series in color groups: \u201cBlue Group,\u201d \u201cWhite Group,\u201d \u201cYellow Group,\u201d and so on. To my mind that system was stupid\u2014it told you nothing you couldn\u2019t immediately see. I myself classified them according to weather. There was a clear day that got very hot; a clear winter day, the air chill and pure; a foggy day; and a day when a rainstorm had grown and then broken.\nWhen I told Freya of my system she applauded it. \u201cSo Heidi\u2019s painting goes from the king of the White Group to the hottest moment of the hot day.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. It\u2019s the most extreme in terms of sunlight blasting the stone into motes of color.\u201d\n\u201cAnd thus the forger extends Monet\u2019s own thinking, you see,\u201d she said, a bit absently. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see Arnold, and I think we have visited every room.\u201d\n\u201cCould he be late?\u201d\n\u201cWe are already quite late ourselves. I wonder if he has gone back.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems unlikely,\u201d I said.\nPurposefully we toured the museum one more time, and I ignored the color-splashed canvases standing before the dark crater, to search closely in all the various turns of the galleries. No Arnold.\n\u201cCome along,\u201d Freya said. \u201cI suspect he stayed in Terminator, and now I want to speak with him more than ever.\u201d\nSo we returned to the garage, got back in our car, and drove out onto Mercury\u2019s bare, baked surface once again. Half an hour later we had Terminator\u2019s tracks in sight. They stretched before us from horizon to horizon, twelve fat silvery cylinders set five meters above the ground on narrow pylons. To the east, rolling over the flank of Valazquez Crater so slowly that we could not perceive its movement without close attention, came the city itself, a giant clear half-egg filled with the colors of rooftops, gardens, and the gray stone of the building crowding the terraced Dawn Wall.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go west to the next station,\u201d I said. Then I saw something, up on the city track nearest us: spread-eagled over the top of the big cylinder was a human form in a light green daysuit. I stopped the car. \u201cLook!\u201d\nFreya peered out her window. \u201cWe\u2019d better go investigate.\u201d\nWe struggled quickly into the car\u2019s emergency daysuits, clamped on the helmets, and slipped through the car\u2019s lock onto the ground. A ladder led us up the nearest cylinder pylon and through a tunnel in the cylinder itself. Once on top we could stand safely on the broad hump of the rail.\nThe figure we had seen was only thirty meters away from us, and we hurried to it.\nIt was Arnold, spread in cruciform fashion over the cylinder\u2019s top, secured in place by three large suction plates that had been cuffed to his wrists and ankles, and then stuck to the cylinder. Arnold turned from his contemplation of the slowly approaching city, and looked at us wide-eyed through his faceplate. Freya reached down and turned on his helmet intercom.\n\u201c\u2014am I glad to see you!\u201d Arnold cried, voice harsh. \u201cThese plates won\u2019t move!\u201d\n\u201cTied to the tracks, eh?\u201d Freya said.\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\u201cWho put you here?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I went out to meet you at the Monet museum, and the last thing I remember I was in the garage there. When I came to, I was here.\u201d\n\u201cDoes your head hurt?\u201d I inquired.\n\u201cYes. Like I was gassed, though, not hit. But\u2014the city\u2014it just came over the horizon a short time ago. Perhaps we could dispense with discussion until I am freed?\u201d\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Freya said, nudging one of the plates with her boot. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t know who did this, Arnold?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! That\u2019s what I just said! Please, Freya, can\u2019t we talk after I get loose?\u201d\n\u201cIn a hurry, Arnold?\u201d Freya asked.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to be too worried,\u201d I assured him. \u201cIf we can\u2019t free you the cowcatchers will be out to pry you loose.\u201d I tried lifting a plate, but could not move it. \u201cSurely they will find a way\u2014it\u2019s their job, after all.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cUsually true,\u201d said Freya. \u201cArnold is probably not aware that the cowcatchers have become rather unreliable recently. Some weeks ago a murderer tied his victim to a track just as you have been, Arnold, and then somehow disengaged the cowcatchers\u2019 sensors. The unfortunate victim was shaved into molecules by one of the sleeves of the city. It was kept quiet to avoid any attempted repetitions, but since then the cowcatchers\u2019 sensors have continued to function erratically, and two or three suicides have been entirely too successful.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps this isn\u2019t the best moment to tell us about this,\u201d I suggested to Freya.\nArnold choked over what I took to be his agreement.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Freya said, \u201cI thought I should make the situation clear. Now listen, Arnold. We need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cFree me first, then talk.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut Terminator is only a kilometer away!\u201d\n\u201cYour perspective from that angle is deceptive,\u201d Freya told him. \u201cThe city is at least three kilometers away.\u201d\n\u201cMore like two,\u201d I said, as I could now make out individual rooftops under the Dawn Wall. In fact the city glowed like a big glass lamp, and illuminated the entire landscape with a faint green radiance.\n\u201cAnd at three point four kilometers an hour,\u201d Freya said, \u201cthat gives us almost an hour, doesn\u2019t it. So listen to me, Arnold. The Monet cathedral that you sold to Heidi is a fake.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Arnold cried. \u201cIt certainly is not! And I insist this isn\u2019t the time\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt is a fake. Now I want you to tell me the truth, or I will leave you here to test the cowcatchers.\u201d She leaned over to stare down at Arnold face to face. \u201cI know who painted the fake, as well.\u201d\nHelplessly Arnold stared up at her.\n\u201cHe put you on the track here, didn\u2019t he.\u201d\nArnold squeezed his eyes shut, nodded slowly. \u201cI think so.\u201d\n\u201cSo if you want to be let up, you must swear to me that you will abide by my plan for dealing with this forger. You will follow my instructions, understand?\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\n\u201cDo you agree?\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Arnold said, forcing the words out. \u201cNow let me up!\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Freya straightened.\n\u201cHow are we going to do it?\u201d I asked.\nFreya shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nAt this Arnold howled, he shouted recriminations, he began to wax hysterical\u2014\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Freya exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound like a man who has made too many brightside crossings. These suction plates are little different from children\u2019s darts.\u201d She leaned down, grasped a plate, pulled up with all of her considerable strength. No movement. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said thoughtfully.\n\u201cFreya,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d she replied, and walked back down the hump of the cylinder to the ladder tunnel, there to disappear down it.\n\u201cShe\u2019s left me,\u201d Arnold groaned. \u201cLeft me to be crushed.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said. \u201cNo doubt she has gone to the car to retrieve some useful implement.\u201d I kicked heartily at the plate holding Arnold\u2019s feet to the cylinder, and even managed to slide it a few centimeters down the curve, which had the effect of making Arnold suddenly taller. But other than that I made no progress.\nWhen Freya returned she carried a bar bent at one end. \u201cCrowbar,\u201d she explained to us.\n\u201cBut where did you get it?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the car\u2019s tool chest, naturally. Here.\u201d She stepped over Arnold. \u201cIf we just insinuate this end of it under your cuffs, I believe we\u2019ll have enough leverage to do the trick. The cylinder being curved, the plates\u2019 grasp should be weakened . . . about here.\u201d She jammed the short end of the bar under the edge of the footplates\u2019 cuff, and pulled on the upper end of it. Over the intercom, breathless silence; her fair cheeks reddened; then suddenly Arnold\u2019s legs flew up and over his head, leaving his arms twisted and his neck at an awkward angle. At the same time Freya staggered off the cylinder, performed a neat somersault and landed on her feet, on the ground below us. While she made her way back up to us I tried to ease the weight on Arnold\u2019s neck, but by his squeaks of distress I judged he was still uncomfortable. Freya rejoined us, and quickly wedged her crowbar under Arnold\u2019s right wrist cuff, and freed it. That left Arnold hanging down the side of the cylinder by his left wrist; but with one hard crank Freya popped that plate free as well, and Arnold disappeared. By leaning over we could just see him, collapsed in a heap on the ground. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Freya asked. He groaned for an answer.\nI looked up and saw that Terminator was nearly upon us. Almost involuntarily I proceeded to the ladder tunnel; Freya followed me, and we descended to the ground. \u201cDisturbing not to be able to trust the cowcatchers,\u201d I remarked as my heartbeat slowed.\n\u201cNathaniel,\u201d Freya said, looking exasperated. \u201cI made all that up, you know that.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Yes, of course.\u201d\nAs we rejoined Arnold he was just struggling to a seated position. \u201cMy ankle,\u201d he said. Then the green wash of light from Terminator disappeared, as did the night sky; the city slid over us, and we were encased in a gloom interrupted by an occasional running light. All twelve of the city\u2019s big tracks had disappeared, swallowed by the sleeves in the city\u2019s broad metallic foundation. Only the open slots that allowed passage over the pylons showed where the sleeves were; for a moment in the darkness it seemed we stood between two worlds held apart by a field of pylons.\nMeanwhile the city slid over us soundlessly, propelled by the expansion of the tracks themselves. You see, the alloy composing the tracks is capable of withstanding the 425 degree Centigrade heat of the Mercurial day, but the cylinders do expand just a bit in this heat. Here in the Terminator is the forward edge of the cylinders\u2019 expansion, and the smooth-sided sleeves above us at that moment fit so snugly over the cylinders that as the cylinders expand, the city is pushed forward toward the cooler, thinner railing to the west; and so the city is propelled by the sun, while never being fully exposed to it. The motive force is so strong, in fact, that resistance to it arranged in the sleeves generates the enormous reserves of energy that Terminator has sold so successfully to the rest of civilization.\nThough I had understood this mechanism for decades, I had never before observed it from this angle, and despite the fact that I was somewhat uneasy to be standing under our fair city, I was also fascinated to see its broad, knobby silver underside gliding majestically westward. For a long time I did nothing but stare at it.\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get to the car,\u201d Freya said. \u201cThe sun will be up very soon after the city passes, and then we\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d\nSince Arnold was still cuffed to the plates, and had at least a sprained ankle, walking with him slung between us was a slow process. While we were at it the Dawn Wall passed over us, and suddenly the twelve tracks and the stars between them were visible again. \u201cNow we\u2019d better hurry,\u201d said Freya. Above us the very top of the Dawn Wall flared a brilliant white; sunlight was striking that surface, only two hundred meters above us. Dawn was not far away. In the glare of reflected light we could see the heavily tire-printed ground under the cylinders perfectly, and for a while our eyes were nearly overwhelmed. \u201cLook!\u201d Freya cried, shielding her eyes with one hand and pointing up at the sun-washed slope of the city wall with the other. \u201cIt\u2019s the inspiration of our Monet, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nDespite our haste, the great Rouen cathedral of Mercury pulled away from us. \u201cThis won\u2019t do,\u201d Freya said. \u201cOnly a bit more to the car, but we have to hurry. Here, Arnold, let me carry you\u2014\u201d and she ran, carrying Arnold piggyback, the rest of the way to the car. As we maneuvered him through the lock, a tongue of the sun\u2019s corona licked briefly over the horizon, blinding us. I felt scorched; my throat was dry. We were now at the dawn edge of the Terminator zone, and east-facing slopes burned white while west-facing slopes were still a perfect black, creating a chaotic patchwork that was utterly disorienting. We rolled into the car after Arnold, and quickly drove west, passing the city, returning to the night zone, and arriving at a station where we could make the transfer into the city again. Freya laughed at my expression as we crossed the gap. \u201cWell, Nathaniel,\u201d she said, \u201chome again.\u201d\nThe very next day Freya arranged for those concerned with the case to assemble on Heidi\u2019s patio again. Four police officials were there, and one took notes. The painting of the cathedral of Rouen was back in its place on the villa wall; George Butler and Harvey Washburn stood before it, while Arnold Ohman and Heidi paced by the patio\u2019s edge. Lucinda and Delaurence, the cook, watched from behind the patio bar.\nFreya called us to order. She was wearing a severe blue dress, and her white-blond hair was drawn into a tight braid that fell down her back. Sternly she said, \u201cI will suggest to you an explanation for the death of Sandor Musgrave. All of you except for the police and Mr. Sebastian were to one extent or another suspected of killing him, so I know this will be of great interest to you.\u201d\nNaturally there was an uneasy stir among those listening.\n\u201cSeveral of you had reason to hate Musgrave, or to fear him. The man was a blackmailer by profession, and on Earth he had obtained evidence of illegalities in the merger Heidi and George made five years ago, that gave him leverage over both of you. This and motives for the rest of you were well established during the initial investigation, and we need not recapitulate the details.\n\u201cIt is also true, however, that subsequent investigations have confirmed that all of you had alibis for the moment when Musgrave was struck down. Lucinda and Delaurence were together in the kitchen until Lucinda left to investigate the shout she heard; this was confirmed by caterers hired for the Solday party. Heidi left the patio shortly before Musgrave was found, but she was consulting with Hiu and the orchestra during the time in question. George Butler went into the house with Arnold Ohman, but they were together for most of the time they were inside. Eventually George left to go to the bathroom, but luckily for him the orchestra\u2019s first clarinetist was there to confirm his presence. And fortunately for Mr. Ohman, I myself could see him from the patio, standing in the hallway until the very moment when Lucinda screamed.\n\u201cSo you see\u2014\u201d Freya paused, eyed us one by one, ran a finger along the frame of the big painting. \u201cThe problem took on a new aspect. It became clear that, while many had a motive to kill Musgrave, no one had the opportunity. This caused me to reconsider. How, exactly, had Musgrave been killed? He was struck on the head by the frame of one of Heidi\u2019s hall mirrors. Though several mirrors were broken in the melee following Lucinda\u2019s screams, we know the one that struck Musgrave; it was at the bend in the hallway leading from the atrium to the patio. And it was only a couple of meters away from a step down in the hallway.\u201d\nFreya took a large house plan from a table and set it before the policeman. \u201cSandor Musgrave, you will recall, was new to Mercury. He had never seen a Solday celebration. When the Great Gates opened and the reflected light filled this villa, my suggestion is that he was overwhelmed by fright. Lucinda heard him cry for help\u2014perhaps he thought the house was burning down. He panicked, rushed out of the study, and blindly began to run for the patio. Unable to see the step down or the mirror, he must have pitched forward, and his left temple struck the frame with a fatal blow. He crawled a few steps farther, then collapsed and died.\u201d\nHeidi stepped forward. \u201cSo Musgrave died by accident?\u201d\n\u201cThis is my theory. And it explains how it was that no one had the opportunity to kill him. In fact, no one did kill him.\u201d She turned to the police. \u201cI trust you will follow up on this suggestion?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the one taking notes. \u201cDeath declared accidental by consulting investigator. Proceed from there.\u201d He exchanged glances with his colleagues. \u201cWe are satisfied this explains the facts of the case.\u201d\nHeidi surveyed the silent group. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I am very relieved.\u201d She turned to Delaurence. \u201cLet\u2019s open the bar. It would be morbid to celebrate an accidental death, but here we can say we are celebrating the absence of a murder.\u201d\nThe others gave a small cheer of relief, and we surrounded the bartender.\nA few days later Freya asked me to accompany her to North Station. \u201cI need your assistance.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you leaving Terminator?\u201d\n\u201cSeeing someone off.\u201d\nWhen we entered the station\u2019s big waiting room, she inspected the crowd, then cried, \u201cArnold!\u201d and crossed the room to him. Arnold saw her and grimaced. \u201cOh, Arnold,\u201d she said, and leaned over to kiss him on each cheek. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d\nArnold shook his head, and greeted me mournfully. \u201cYou\u2019re a hard woman, Freya,\u201d he told her. \u201cStop behaving so cheerfully; you make me sick. You know perfectly well this is exile of the worst sort.\u201d\n\u201cBut Arnold,\u201d Freya said, \u201cMercury is not the whole of civilization. In fact it could be considered culturally dead, an immense museum to the past that has no real life at all.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is why you choose to live here, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he said bitterly.\n\u201cWell of course it does have some pleasures. But the really vital centers of any civilization are on the frontier. Arnold, and that\u2019s where you\u2019re going.\u201d\nArnold looked completely disgusted.\n\u201cBut Arnold,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cPluto,\u201d he said curtly.\n\u201cPluto?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cBut whatever for? What will you do there?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cDig ditches, I suppose.\u201d\nFreya laughed. \u201cYou certainly will not.\u201d She addressed me. \u201cArnold has decided, very boldly I might add, to abandon his safe career as a dealer here on Mercury, to become a real artist on the frontier.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\nFreya wagged a finger at Arnold. \u201cYou must write us often.\u201d\nArnold made a strangled growl. \u201cDamn you, Freya. I refuse. I refuse to go.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have that option,\u201d Freya said. \u201cRemember the chalk, Arnold. The chalk was your signature.\u201d\nArnold hung his head, defeated. The city interfaced with the spaceport station. \u201cIt isn\u2019t fair,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWhat am I going to do out on those barbaric outworlds?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to live,\u201d Freya said sternly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to live and you\u2019re going to paint. No more hiding. Understand?\u201d\nI, at any rate, was beginning to.\n\u201cYou should be thanking me profusely,\u201d Freya went on, \u201cbut I\u2019ll concede you\u2019re upset and wait for gratitude by mail.\u201d She put a hand on Arnold\u2019s shoulder, and pushed him affectionately toward the crossing line. \u201cRemember to write.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Arnold said, a panicked expression on his face. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Freya said. \u201cBe gone! Or else.\u201d\nArnold sagged, and stepped across the divide between the stations. Soon the city left the spaceport station behind.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Freya said. \u201cThat\u2019s done.\u201d\nI stared at her. \u201cYou just helped a murderer to escape!\u201d\nShe lifted an eyebrow. \u201cExile is a very severe punishment; in fact in my cultural tradition it was the usual punishment for murder committed in anger or self-defense.\u201d\nI waved a hand dismissively. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the Iceland of Eric the Red. And it wasn\u2019t self-defense\u2014Sandor Musgrave was outright murdered.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cI never liked him.\u201d\nI told you before; she has no sense of right and wrong. It is a serious defect in a detective. I could only wave my arms in incoherent outrage; and my protests have never carried much weight with Freya, who claims not even to believe them.\nWe left the station. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you were saying to Arnold about chalk?\u201d I said, curiosity getting the better of me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the clue you provided, Nathaniel\u2014somewhat transformed. As you reminded me, Musgrave was pointing at the patio, and Heidi\u2019s patio is made of a block of the Dover cliffs. Dover cliffs, as you know, are composed of chalk. So I returned to the painting, and cut through the back to retrieve samples of the chalk used in the underdrawing, which had been revealed to me by infrared photography.\u201d She turned a corner and led me uptown. \u201cChalk, you see, has its own history of change. In Monet\u2019s time chalk was made from natural sources, not from synthetics. Sure enough, the chalk I took from the canvas was a natural chalk. But natural chalk, being composed of marine ooze, is littered with the fossil remains of unicellular algae called coccoliths. These coccoliths are different depending upon the source of the chalk. Monet used Rouen chalk, appropriately enough, which was filled with the coccoliths Maslovella bamesae and Cricolithus pemmatoidens. The coccoliths in our painting, however, are Neococcolithes dubius. Very dubious indeed\u2014for this is a North American chalk, first mined in Utah in 1924.\u201d\n\u201cSo Monet couldn\u2019t have used this chalk! And there you had your proof that the painting is a fake.\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\nI said doubtfully. \u201cIt seems a subtle clue for the dying Musgrave to conceive of.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Freya said cheerfully. \u201cPerhaps he was only pointing in the direction of the patio by the accident of his final movements. But it was sufficient that the coincidence gave me the idea. The solution of a crime often depends upon imaginary clues.\u201d\n\u201cBut how did you know Arnold was the forger?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd why, after taking the trouble to concoct all those paints, did he use the wrong chalk?\u201d\n\u201cThe two matters are related. It could be that Arnold only knew he needed a natural chalk, and used the first convenient supply without knowing there are differences between them. In that case it was a mistake\u2014his only mistake. But it seems unlike Arnold to me, and I think rather that it was the forger\u2019s signature. In effect, the forger said, if you take a slide of the chalk trapped underneath the paint, and magnify it five thousand times with an electron microscope, you will find me. This chalk never used by Monet is my sign. For on some level every forger hopes to be discovered, if only in the distant future\u2014to receive credit for the work.\n\u201cSo I knew we had a forger on Mercury, and I was already suspicious of Arnold, since he was the dealer who brought the painting to Mercury, and since he was the only guest at Heidi\u2019s party with the opportunity to kill Musgrave; he was missing during the crucial moments\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are a liar!\u201d\n\u201cAnd it seems Arnold was getting desperate; I searched among his recent bills, and found one for three suction plates. So when we found him on the track I was quite sure.\u201d\n\u201cHe stuck himself to the track?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The one on his right wrist was electronically controlled, so after setting the other two he tripped the third between his teeth. He hoped that we would discover him there after missing him at the museum, and think that there was someone else who wished him harm. And if not, the cowcatchers would pull him free. It was a silly plan, but he was desperate after I set up that appointment with him. When I confronted him with all this, after we rescued him from the tracks, he broke down and confessed. Sandor Musgrave had discovered that the Monet was a fake while blackmailing the Evans family in England, and after forcing Heidi to give him a job, he worked on the painting in secret until he found proof. Then he blackmailed Arnold into bankruptcy, and when on Solday he pressed Arnold for more money, Arnold lost his composure and took advantage of the confusion caused by the opening of the Great Gates to smack Musgrave on the head with one of Heidi\u2019s mirrors.\u201d\nI wagged a finger under her nose. \u201cAnd you set him free. You\u2019ve gone too far this time, Freya Grindavik.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cIf you consider Arnold\u2019s case a bit longer, you might change your mind. Arnold Ohman has been the most important art dealer on Mercury for over sixty years. He sold the Vermeer collection to George Butler, and the Goyas to Terminator West Gallery, and the Pissarros to the museum in Homer Crater, and those Chinese landscapes you love so much to the city park, and the Kandinskys to the Lion of the Grays. Most of the finest paintings on Mercury were brought here by Arnold Ohman.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo how many of those, do you think, were painted by Arnold himself?\u201d\nI stopped dead in the street, stunned at the very idea. \u201cBut\u2014but that only makes it worse! Inestimably worse! It means there are fakes all over the planet!\u201d\n\u201cProbably so. And no one wants to hear that. But it also means Arnold Ohman is a very great artist. And in our age that is no easy feat. Can you imagine the withering reception his painting would have received if he had done original work? He would have ended up like Harvey Washburn and all the rest of them who wander around the galleries like dogs. The great art of the past crashes down on our artists like meteors, so that their minds resemble the blasted landscape we roll over. Now Arnold has escaped that fate, and his work is universally admired, even loved. That Monet, for instance\u2014it isn\u2019t just that it passes for one of the cathedral series; it could be argued that it is the best of them. Now is this a level of greatness that Arnold could have achieved\u2014would have been allowed to achieve\u2014if he had done original work on this museum planet? Impossible. He was forced to forge old masters to be able to fully express his genius.\u201d\n\u201cAll this is no excuse for forgery or murder.\u201d\nBut Freya wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve exiled him, he may go on forging old paintings, but he may begin painting something new. That possibility surely justified ameliorating his punishment for killing such a parasite as Musgrave. And there is Mercury\u2019s reputation as art museum of the system to consider . . . \u201d\nI refused to honor her opinions with a reply, and looking around, I saw that during our conversation she had led me far up the terraces. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cTo Heidi\u2019s,\u201d she said. And she had the grace to look a little shamefaced\u2014for a moment, anyway. \u201cI need your help moving something.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Freya explained, \u201cwhen I told Heidi some of the facts of the case, she insisted on giving me a token of her gratitude, and she overrode all my refusals, so . . . I was forced to accept.\u201d She rang the wall bell.\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNot at all. Actually, I think Heidi preferred not to own a painting she knew to be a fake, you see. So I did her a favor by taking it off her hands.\u201d\nWhen Delaurence let us in, we found he had almost finished securing Rouen Cathedral\u2014Sun Effect in a big plastic box. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this,\u201d Freya told him.\nWhile we completed the boxing I told Freya what I thought of her conduct. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken liberties with the law\u2014you lied right and left\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell boxed,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go before Heidi changes her mind.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019re proud of yourself.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. A lot of lab work went into this.\u201d\nWe maneuvered the big box through the gate and into the street, and carried it upright between us, like a short flat coffin. We reached Freya\u2019s villa, and immediately she set to work unboxing the painting. When she had freed it she set it on top of a couch, resting against the wall.\nShaking with righteous indignation, I cried, \u201cThat thing isn\u2019t a product of the past! It isn\u2019t authentic. It is only a fake. Claude Monet didn\u2019t paint it.\u201d\nFreya looked at me with a mild frown, as if confronting a slightly dense and very stubborn child. \u201cSo what?\u201d\nAfter I had lectured her on her immorality a good deal more, and heard all of her patient agreement, I ran out of steam. \u201cWell,\u201d I muttered, \u201cyou may have destroyed all my faith in you, and damaged Mercury\u2019s art heritage forever, but at least I\u2019ll get a good story out of it.\u201d This was some small comfort. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll call it The Case of the Thirty-third Cathedral of Rouen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cNo, of course not!\u201d And then she insisted that I keep everything she had told me that day a secret.\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. Bitterly I said, \u201cYou\u2019re like those forgers. You want somebody to witness your cleverness, and I\u2019m the one who is stuck with it.\u201d\nShe immediately agreed, but went on to list all the reasons no one else could ever learn of the affair\u2014how so many people would be hurt\u2014including her, I added acerbically\u2014how so many valuable collections would be ruined, how her plan to transform Arnold into a respectable honest Plutonian artist would collapse, and so on and so forth, for nearly an hour. Finally I gave up and conceded to her wishes, so that the upshot of it was I promised not to write down a single word concerning this particular adventure of ours, and I promised furthermore to say nothing of the entire affair, and to keep it a complete secret, forever and ever.\nBut I don\u2019t suppose it will do any harm to tell you.\nOriginally published in Universe 15, edited by Terry Carr, 1985.\nKim Stanley Robinson is an American science fiction writer living in Davis, California.

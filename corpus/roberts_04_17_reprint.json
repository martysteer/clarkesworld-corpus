Not clarity, I think: but sick. Sick in the head. He probably wouldn\u2019t disagree. Not with so much professional psychiatric opinion having been brought to bear on the matter. He concedes as much to me, in the many communications he has addressed me from his asylum. He sends various manifestos and communications to the papers too, I understand. In all of them he claims to have finally solved the Fermi Paradox. If he has, then I don\u2019t expect my nightmares to diminish any time soon.\n I do have bad dreams, yes. Intense, visceral nightmares from which I wake sweating and weeping. If Roy is wrong, then perhaps they\u2019ll diminish with time.\n But really it started with the letter.\n I was in Antarctica with Roy Curtius, the two of us hundreds of miles inland, far away from the nearest civilization. It was 1986, and one (weeks-long) evening and one (months-long) south polar night. Our job was to process the raw astronomical data coming in from Proxima and Alpha Centurai. Which is to say: our job was to look for alien life. There had been certain peculiarities in the radioastronomical flow from that portion of the sky, and we were looking into it. Whilst we were out there we were given some other scientific tasks to be keeping ourselves busy with, but it was the SETI business that was the main event. We maintained the equipment, and sifted the data, passing most of it on for more detailed analysis back in the UK. Since in what follows I am going to say a number of disobliging things about him, I\u2019ll concede right here that Roy was some kind of programming genius\u2014this, remember, back in the late \u201980s, when \u201ccomputing\u201d was quite the new thing.\n The base was situated as far as possible from light pollution and radio pollution. There was nowhere on the planet further away than where we were.\n We did the best we could, with 1980s-grade data processing and a kit-built radio dish flown out to the location in a packing crate, and assembled best as two men could assemble anything when it was too cold for us to take off our gloves.\n \u201cThe simplest solution to the Fermi thing,\u201d I said once, \u201cwould be simply to pick up alien chatter on our clever machines. Where are the aliens? Here they are.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath,\u201d he said.\n We spent some hours every day on the project. The rest of the time we ate, drank, lay about, and killed time. We had a VHS player, and copies of Beverly Hills Cop, Ghostbusters, The Neverending Story, and The Karate Kid. We played cards. We read books. I was working my way through Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune trilogy. Roy was reading Immanuel Kant. That fact, right there, tells you all you need to know about the two of us. \u201cI figured eight months isolation was the perfect time really to get to grips with the Kritik der reinen Vernunft,\u201d he would say. \u201cOf course,\u201d he would add, with a little self-deprecating snigger, \u201cI\u2019m not reading it in the original German. My German is good\u2014but not that good.\u201d He used to leave the book lying around: Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, transl. Meiklejohn. It had a red cover. Pretentious fool.\n \u201cWe put too much trust in modern technology,\u201d he said one day. \u201cThe solution to the Fermi Paradox? It\u2019s all in here.\u201d And he would stroke the cover of the Critique, as if it were his white cat and he Ernst Stavro Blofeld.\n \u201cWhatever, dude,\u201d I told him.\n Once a week a plane dropped off our supplies. Sometimes the pilot, Diamondo, would land his crate on the ice-runway, maybe even get out to stretch his legs and chat to us. I\u2019ve no idea why he was called \u201cDiamondo,\u201d or what his real name was. He was Peruvian I believe. More often, if the weather was bad, or if D. was in a hurry, he would swoop low and drop our supplies, leaving us to fight through the burly snowstorm and drag the package in. Inside would be necessaries, scientific equipment, copies of relevant journals\u2014paper copies, it was back then, of course\u2014and so on. The drops also contained correspondence. For me that meant: letters from family, friends, and above all from my girlfriend Lezlie.\n Two weeks before all this started I had written to Lezlie, asking her for a paperback copy of Children of Dune. I told her, in what I hope was a witty manner, that I had been disappointed by the slimness of Dune Messiah. I need the big books, I had said, to fill up the time, the long aching time, the (I think I used the phrase) terrible absence-of-Lezlie-thighs-and-tits time that characterized life in the Antarctic. I mention this because, in the weeks that followed, I found myself going back over my letter to her\u2014my memory of it, I mean; I didn\u2019t keep a copy\u2014trying to work out if I had perhaps offended her with a careless choice of words. If she might, for whatever reason, have decided not to write to me this week in protest at my vulgarity, or sexism. Or to register her disapproval by not paying postage to send a fat paperback edition of Dune III to the bottom of the world. Or maybe she had written.\n You\u2019ll see what I mean in a moment.\n Roy never got letters. I always got some: some weeks as many as half a dozen. He: none. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d I asked him, once. \u201cOr any friends?\u201d\n \u201cPhilosophy is my girlfriend,\u201d he replied, looking smugly over the top of his copy of the Critique of Pure Reason. \u201cThe solution to the Fermi Paradox is the friend I have yet to meet. Between them, they are all the company I desire.\u201d\n \u201cIf you say so, mate,\u201d I replied, thinking inwardly weirdo! and loser and billy-no-mates and other such things. I didn\u2019t say any of that aloud, of course. And each week it would go on: we\u2019d unpack the delivery parcel, and from amongst all the other necessaries and equipment I\u2019d pull out a rubberband-clenched stash of letters, all of which would be for me and none of which were ever for Roy. And he would smile his smarmy smile and look aloof; or sometimes he would peer in a half-hope, as if thinking that maybe this week would be different. Once or twice I saw him writing a letter, with his authentic Waverley fountain pen, shielding his page with his arm when he thought I wanted to nosy into his private affairs\u2014as if I had the slightest interest in fan mail to Professor Huffington Puffington of the University of Kant Studies.\n He used to do a number of bonkers things, Roy: like drawing piano keys onto his left arm, spending ages shading the black ones, and then practicing\u2014or, for all I know, only pretending to practice\u2014the right-hand part of Beethoven sonatas on it. \u201cI requested an actual piano,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey said no.\u201d He used to do vocal exercises in the shower, really loud. He kept samples of his snot, testing (he said) whether his nasal mucus was affected by the south polar conditions. Once he inserted a radiognomon relay spike (looked a little like a knitting needle) into the corner of his eye, and squeezed the ball to see what effects it had in his vision \u201cbecause Newton did it.\u201d He learned a new line of the Aeneid every evening\u2014in Latin, mark you\u2014by reciting it over and over. Amazingly annoying, this last weird hobby, because it was so particularly and obviously pointless. I daresay that\u2019s why he did it.\n I read regular things: SF novels, magazines, even four-day-old newspapers (if the drop parcel happened to contain any), checking the football scores and doing the crosswords. And weekly I would pull out my fistful of letters, and settle down on the common room sofa to read them and write my replies, whilst Roy pursed his brow and worked laboriously through another paragraph of his Kant.\n One week he said. \u201cI\u2019d like a letter.\u201d\n \u201cGet yourself a pen pal,\u201d I suggested.\n We had just been outside, where the swarming snow was as thick as a continuous shower of woodchips and the wind bit through the three layers I wore. We were both back inside now, pulling off icicle bearded gloves and scarfs and stamping our boots. The drop-package was on the floor between us, dripping. We had yet to open it.\n \u201cCan I have one of yours?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cTell you what,\u201d I said. I was in a good mood, for some reason. \u201cI\u2019ll sell you one. Sell you one of my letters.\u201d\n \u201cHow much?\u201d\n \u201cTenner,\u201d I said. Ten pounds was (I hate to sound like an old codger, but it\u2019s the truth) a lot of money back then.\n \u201cDeal,\u201d he said, without hesitation. He untied his boots, hopped out of them like Puck and sprinted away. When he came back he was holding a genuine ten pound note. \u201cI choose, though,\u201d he said, snatching the thing away as I reached for it.\n \u201cWhatever, man,\u201d I laughed. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d\n He gave me the money. Then, he dragged the parcel, now dripping melted snow, through to the common room and opened it. He rummaged around and brought out the rubberbanded letters: five of them.\n \u201cAre you sure none of them are addressed to you?\u201d I said, settling myself on the sofa and examining my banknote with pride. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need to buy one of my letters\u2014maybe you got one of your own?\u201d\n He shook his head, looked quickly through the five envelopes on offer, selected one and handed me the remainder of the parcel. \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cPleasure doing business with you,\u201d I told him. Off he went to his bedroom to read the letter he had bought.\n I thought nothing more about it. The four letters were from: my Mum, my brother, a guy in Leicester with whom I was playing a tediously drawn-out game of postal chess, and the manager of my local branch of Lloyd\u2019s Bank in Reading, writing to inform me that my account was in credit. Since being in Antarctica meant I could never spend anything, and since my researcher\u2019s stipend was still going in monthly, this was unnecessary. I\u2019m guessing it was by way of a publicity exercise. It\u2019s not that I was famous, of course; even famous-for-Reading. But it doubtless looked good on some report somewhere: we look after our customers, even when they\u2019re at the bottom of the world! I made myself a coffee. Then I spent an hour at a computer terminal, checking data. When Roy came back through he looked smug, but I didn\u2019t begrudge him that. After all, I had made ten pounds\u2014and ten pounds is ten pounds.\n For the rest of the day we worked, and then I fixed up some pasta and Bolognese sauce in the little kitchen. As we ate I asked him: \u201cso who was the letter from?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Suspicious voice.\n \u201cThe letter you bought from me. Who was it from? Was it Lezlie?\u201d\n A self-satisfied grin. \u201cNo comment.\u201d\n \u201cSay what?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s my letter. I bought it. And I\u2019m entitled to privacy.\u201d\n \u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I said. \u201cI was only asking.\u201d He was right, I suppose; he bought it, it was his. Still, his manner rubbed me up the wrong way. We ate in silence for a bit, but I\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cI was only asking: who was it from? Is it Lezlie? I won\u2019t pry into what she actually wrote.\u201d Even as I said this, I thought to myself: pry? How could I pry\u2014the words were written to be read by me! \u201cYou know,\u201d I added, thinking to add pressure. \u201cI could just write to her, ask her what she wrote. I could find out that way.\u201d\n \u201cNo comment,\u201d he repeated, pulling his shoulders round as he sat. I took my bowl to the sink and washed it up, properly annoyed, but there was no point in saying anything else. Instead I went through and put Romancing the Stone on the telly, because I knew it was the VHS Roy hated the most. He smiled, and retreated to his room with his philosophy book.\n The next morning I discovered, to my annoyance, that the business with the letter was still preying on my mind. I told myself: get over it. It was done. But some part of me refused to get over it. At breakfast Roy read another page of his Kant, and I saw that he was using the letter as a bookmark. At one point he put the book down and stood up to go to the loo, but then a sly expression crept over his usually ingenuous face, and he picked the book up and took it with him.\n It had been a blizzardy few days and the dish needed checking over. Roy tried to wriggle out of this chore: \u201cyou\u2019re more the hardware guy,\u201d he said, in a wheedling tone. \u201cI\u2019m more conceptual\u2014the ideas and the phil-os-o-phay.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap. We\u2019re both hands-on\u2014the folk in Adelaide, and back in Britain, are the actual ideas people.\u201d I was cross. \u201cPhilosophy my arse.\u201d At any rate, he suited-up, rolled his scarf around his lower face, and snapped on his goggles, zipped up his overcoat. We both pulled out brooms and stumped through light snowfall to the dish. It took us half an hour to clear the structure of snow, and check its motors hadn\u2019t frozen solid, and that its bearings were ice-free. Our shadows flickered across the landscape like pennants in the wind.\n The sun loitered near the horizon, a cricket-ball frozen in flight.\n That afternoon I did a stint testing the terminals. With the sun still up, it was a noisy picture; although it was possible to pick up this and that. At first I thought there was something, but when I looked at it I discovered it was radio chatter from a Spanish expedition on its way to the Vinson Massif. I found my mind wandering. Who was the letter from?\n The following day I eased my irritation by writing to Lezlie. Hey, you know Roy? He\u2019s a sad bastard, a ringer for one of actors in \u201cRevenge of the Nerds.\u201d Anyway he asked for a letter and I sold him one. Now he won\u2019t tell me whose letter it is. Did you write to me last week? What did you say? Just give me the gist, lover-girl. But as soon as I\u2019d written this I scrunched it up and threw it in the bin. Lez would surely not respond well to such a message. In effect I was saying: \u201chey you know that love-letter you poured your heart and soul into? I sold it to a nerd without even reading it! That\u2019s how much I value your emotions!\u201d\n Chewed the soft-blue plastic insert at the end of my Bic for a while.\n I tried again: Hi lover! Did you write last week? There was a snafu with the package and some stuff got lost. I looked over the lie. It didn\u2019t ring true. I scrunched this one up too. Then I sat in the chair trying, and failing, to think of how to put things. The two balls of scrunched paper in the waste-bin began, creakingly, to unscrunch.\n Dear Lez. Did you write last week? I\u2019m afraid I lost a letter, klutz that I am! That was closer to the truth. But then I thought: what if she had written me a dear-john letter? Or a let\u2019s-get-married? Or a-close-family-member-has-died? How embarrassing to write back a jaunty \u201cplease repeat your message!\u201d note. What if she hadn\u2019t written at all? What if it were somebody else?\n This latter thought clawed at my mind for a while. What if some important information, perhaps from my academic supervisor at Reading, Prof Addlestone, had been in the letter? Privacy was one thing, but surely Roy didn\u2019t have the right to withhold such info?\n I stomped down the corridor and knocked at Roy\u2019s room. He made me wait for a long time before opening the door just enough to reveal his carbuncular face, smirking up at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d I said. \u201cI want my letter back.\u201d\n \u201cNo dice, doofus,\u201d he replied. \u201cI paid for it. It\u2019s mine now.\u201d\n \u201cLook, I\u2019ll buy it back, alright? I\u2019ll give you your ten pounds. I\u2019ve got it right here.\u201d\n When he smiled, he showed the extent to which his upper set of teeth didn\u2019t fit neatly over his lower set. \u201cIt\u2019s not for sale,\u201d he said.\n \u201cDon\u2019t be a pain, Roy,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m asking nicely.\u201d\n \u201cAnd I\u2019m, nicely, declining.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2014you want more than a tenner? You can go fish for that, my friend.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not for sale,\u201d he repeated.\n \u201cIs it a scam,\u201d I said, my temper wobbling badly. \u201cIs the idea you hold out until I offer\u2014what, twenty quid? Is that it?\u201d\n \u201cNo. That\u2019s not it. It\u2019s mine. I do not choose to sell it.\u201d\n \u201cJust tell me what\u2019s in the letter,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ll give your money back and you can keep the damn thing, just tell me who it\u2019s from and what it says.\u201d Even as I made this offer it occurred to me that Roy, with his twisted sense of humor, might simply lie to me. So I added: \u201cshow it to me. Just show me the letter. You don\u2019t have to give it up, keep it for all I care, only\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo deal,\u201d said Roy. Then he wrung his speccy face into a parody of a concerned expression. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing yourself, Anthony.\u201d And he shut his door.\n I went through to the common room, fuming. For a while I toyed with the idea of simply grabbing the letter back: I was bigger than Roy, and doubtless had been involved in more actual fist-flying, body-grappling fights than he. It wouldn\u2019t have been hard. But instead of that I had a beer, and lay on the sofa, and tried to get a grip. We had to live together, he and I, in unusually confined circumstances, and for a very lengthy period of time. In less than a week the sun would vanish, and the proper observing would begin. Say we chanced upon alien communication (I told myself)\u2014wouldn\u2019t that be something? Might there be a Nobel Prize, or something equally prestigious, in it? I couldn\u2019t put all that at risk, even for the satisfaction of punching him on the nose.\n Maybe, I told myself, Roy would thaw out a little in a day or two. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar, after all. Maybe I could coax the letter out of him.\n The week wore itself out. I went through a phase of intense irritation with Roy for his (what seemed to me) immensely petty and immature attitude with regard to my letter. Then I went through a phase when I told myself it didn\u2019t bother me. I did consider returning his tenner to him, so as to retain the high moral ground. But then I thought: ten pound is ten pound.\n The week ended, and Diamondo overflew and tossed the supply package out to bounce along the snow. This annoyed me, because I had finally managed to write a letter to Lezlie that explained the situation without making it sound like I valued her communiques so little I\u2019d gladly sold it off to weirdo Roy. But I couldn\u2019t \u201cpost\u201d the letter unless the plane landed and took it on board, so I had to hang onto it. I couldn\u2019t even be sure, I reminded myself, that the letter Roy had bought from me had been from her.\n On the fifth of July the sun set for the last time until August. The thing people don\u2019t understand about Antarctic night is that it\u2019s not the same level of ink-black all the way through. For the first couple of weeks, the sky lightens twice a day, pretty much bright enough to walk around without a torch\u2014the same dawn and dusk paling of the sky that precedes sunrise and follows sunset, only without actual dawn and dusk. Still, you can sense the sun is just there, on the other side of the horizon, and it\u2019s not too bad. As the weeks go on this gets briefer and darker, and then you do have a month or so when it\u2019s basically coal-colored skies and darkness invisible the whole time.\n Diamondo landed his plane, and tossed out the supply package, but didn\u2019t linger; and by the time I\u2019d put on the minimum of outdoor clothing and grabbed a torch and got through the door he was taking off again\u2014so, once again, I didn\u2019t get to send my letter to Lez.\n That was the last time I saw that aircraft.\n There were two letters in this week\u2019s batch: one from my old Grammar School headmaster, saying that the school had hosted a whole assembly on the \u201cexciting and important\u201d work I was doing; and the other from my Professor at Reading. This was nothing but a note, and read in its entirety: \u201cDear A. I often think of Sartre\u2019s words. Imagination is not an empirical or superadded power of consciousness, it is the whole of consciousness as it realizes its freedom. Where is freer than the very bottom of the world? Nil desperandum! Yours, A.\u201d This, though slightly gnomic, was not out of character for Prof. Addlestone, who had worked on SETI for so long it had made his brain a little funny. No letter from Lez, which worried me. But, after all, she didn\u2019t write every week. I re-read the Professor\u2019s note several times. Did it read like a PS, a scribbled afterthought? Did it perhaps mean that the letter Roy bought had been from Addlestone? Maybe. Maybe not.\n We got on with our work, and I tried to put the whole letter business behind me. Roy did not help, as far as this went. He was acting stranger and stranger; simpering at me, and when I queried his expression (\u201cwhat? What is it?\u201d) scurrying away\u2014or scowling and saying, \u201cnothing, nothing, only . . . \u201d and refusing to elaborate.\n The next thing was: he moved one of the computer terminals into his room. These were 1980s terminals; not the modern-day computers the size and weight of a copy of Marie-Claire; so it was no mean feat getting the thing in there. He even cut a mousehole-like n in the bottom of his door, to enable the main cable to come out into the hall and through into the monitor room.\n \u201cWhat are you doing in there?\u201d I challenged him. \u201cThat\u2019s not standard policy. Did you clear this with home?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m working on something,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m close to a breakthrough. SETI, my friend. Solving Fermi\u2019s paradox! You should consider yourself lucky to be here. You\u2019ll get a footnote in history. Only a footnote, I know: but it\u2019s more than most people get.\u201d\n I ignored this. \u201cI still don\u2019t see why do you need to squirrel yourself away in your room?\u201d\n \u201cPrivacy,\u201d he said. \u201cIs very important to me.\u201d\n One day he went out on the ice to (he told me) check the meteorological datapoints. It seemed like an odd thing\u2014he\u2019d shown precious little interest in them up to that point\u2014but I was glad he was out of the base, if only for half an hour. As soon as I saw his torch-beam go, wobbling its oval of brightness away over the ice, I hurried to his room. I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, I told myself. I was just checking the identity of the letter\u2019s author. Maybe have a quick glance at its contents. I wouldn\u2019t steal it back (although, I told myself, I could. It was my letter after all. Roy was being an idiot about the whole thing). But once my itch was scratched, curiosity-wise, then everything would get easier about the base. I could wait out the remainder of my stint with equanimity. He need never even know I\u2019d been poking around.\n No dice. Roy had fitted a padlock to his door. I rattled this uselessly; I could have smashed it, but then Roy would know what I\u2019d been up to. I retreated to the common room, disproportionately angry. What was he doing, in there, with a whole computer terminal and my letter?\n I had enough self-knowledge to step back from the situation, at least some of the time. He was doing it in order to wind me up. That was the only reason he was doing it. The letter was nothing\u2014none of my letters, if I looked back, contained any actual, substantive content. They were just pleasant chatter, people I knew touching base with me. The letter Roy bought must be the same. He bought it not to have the letter, but in order to set me on edge, to rile me. And by getting riled I was gifting him the victory. The way to play this whole situation was to be perfectly indifferent.\n However much I tried this, though, I kept falling back. It was the not knowing!\n I tried once more, during the week. \u201cLook, Roy,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cThis letter thing is no big deal, you know? None of my letters have any really significant stuff in them.\u201d\n He looked at me, in a \u201cthat\u2019s all you know\u201d sort of way. But this was, I decided, just winding me up.\n \u201cI tell you what I think,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can, you know, nod, or not-nod, depending on whether I\u2019m right. I think the letter you bought was from my girlfriend. Yeah?\u201d\n \u201cNo comment,\u201d said Roy, primly. \u201cOne way or the other.\u201d\n \u201cIf so, it was probably full of inane chatter, yeah? Fine\u2014keep it! With my blessing!\u201d\n \u201cIn point of fact,\u201d he corrected me, holding up his right forefinger, \u201cI do not need your blessing. The transaction was finalized with the fiduciary transfer. Contract law is very clear on this point.\u201d\n I lost my temper a little at this point. \u201cYou know how sad you are, keeping a woman\u2019s letter to another man for your own weird little sexual buzz? That\u2019s\u2014sad. Is what it is. I don\u2019t think you realize how sad that is.\u201d\n \u201cOh Anthony, Anthony,\u201d he said, shaking his head and smirking in that insufferable way he had. \u201cIf only you knew!\u201d\n I swore. \u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I said.\n Then the airstrip lights failed. I assumed this was an accident, although the fact that every one of them failed at the same time was strange. Diamondo came through on the radio: \u201cfellows!\u201d he declared, through his thick accent. \u201cI cannot land if there are no lights to land!\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to them,\u201d I replied. \u201cSome manner of malfunction.\u201d\n \u201cObviously that!\u201d came Diamondo\u2019s voice. \u201cCan you fix? Over.\u201d\n Roy suited up and went outside; he was back in minutes. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything in the dark, with a torch, in a hurry,\u201d he complained. \u201cTell him\u2014no. Tell him to toss the package out and we\u2019ll fix the lights for next time.\u201d\n When I relayed this message, Diamondo said \u201cbreakables! There are breakables in the package! I cannot toss! Over.\u201d Then, contradicting his last uttered word, he went on. \u201cI can take out the breakables and toss the rest. Wait\u2014wait.\u201d\n I could hear the scrapy sound of the plane in the sky outside. Then, over the radio: \u201cis in chute.\u201d\n \u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere are you dropping it? If there\u2019s no lights\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t want to go searching over a wide area in the dark with . . . \u201d There was a terrific crash right overhead, as something smashed into our roof.\n \u201cYou idiot!\u201d I called. \u201cYou could have broken our roof!\u201d\n Static. And, through the walls, the sound of the plane\u2019s engines diminishing. Roy looked and me, and I at him. \u201cI think it rolled off,\u201d Roy said. \u201cYou go out and get it.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re already suited!\u201d\n \u201cI went out last time. It\u2019s your turn now. Fair\u2019s fair.\u201d\n It was on the edge of my tongue to retort: stealing my letter\u2014is that fair? But that would have done no good; and anyway I was hoping that there would be a new letter from Lezlie in the satchel, and if so I certainly wanted to get to that before Roy did. So I pulled on overclothes and took a torch and went outside.\n It was extraordinarily cold\u2014sinus-freezingly cold. The air was still. The sound of Diamondo\u2019s plane, already very faint, diminished and diminished until it vanished altogether. Now the only sound was the whir of the generator, gently churning to itself with its restless motion. I searched around in the dark outside the main building for ten minutes or so, and spent another five trying to see into the gap between the main prefab and the annex, which was half-full of snow. But I couldn\u2019t find it.\n When I went back to the main door it was locked. This was unprecedented. For a while I banged on the door, and yelled, and my heart began blackly to suspect that Roy was playing some kind of prank on me\u2014or worse. I was just about to give up and make my way round to try the side entrance when Roy\u2019s gurning face appeared in the door\u2019s porthole, with the graph-paper pattern woven into the glass. He opened it. \u201cWhat the hell were you playing at?\u201d I demanded, crossly. \u201cWhy did you lock the door?\u201d\n \u201cIt occurred to me that the lights might have been sabotaged,\u201d he said, not looking me in the eye. \u201cI thought: security is valor\u2019s better part. Obviously I was going to let you back in, once I was sure it was you.\u201d\n \u201cHave you had a nervous breakdown?\u201d I yelled. \u201cAre you high? Who else could possibly be out there? We\u2019re three hundred miles from the nearest human settlement. Did you think it was a ghost?\u201d\n \u201cCalm down,\u201d Roy advised, grinning his simpering grin and still not looking me in the eye. \u201cDid you get the package?\u201d\n I sat down with a thump. \u201cCouldn\u2019t find it,\u201d I said, pulling off my overboots. \u201cIt may still be on the roof. Seriously, though, man! Locking the door?\u201d\n \u201cWe need to retrieve it,\u201d said Roy. \u201cIt has my medication in it. My supplies are running low.\u201d\n This was the first I had heard of any medication. \u201cSeriously? They posted you down here, even though you have medical problems?\u201d\n \u201cJust some insomnia problems. And some allergic reaction problems. But I need my sleeping pills and my antihistamines.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat is there to be allergic to, down here?\u201d\n He gave me a pointed look. But then he said: \u201ccome and have a drink. I\u2019ve got some whisky.\u201d\n Now, I knew the base was not supplied with whisky. Beer was the most they allowed us. I should, perhaps, have been suspicious of Roy\u2019s abrupt hospitality, doubly so since I knew he hardly ever drank. But I was cold, and cross, and a whisky\u2014actually\u2014sounded like a bloody good idea. \u201cHow have you got any of that?\u201d\n \u201cI brought it with me. My old tutor at Cambridge gave it to me. Break it out when you\u2019ve solved the SETI problem, he said. He never doubted me, you see. And solve it, I have.\u201d\n And then a second thought occurred to me. It came to me like a flash. I could get Roy drunk. Surely then he would be more amenable to telling me what was in the letter he\u2019d snaffled from me. I couldn\u2019t think that I\u2019d ever seen him drunk; but my judgment was that he would hold his liquor badly. He\u2019d be a splurger. OK, I thought: butter him up, some, and get some booze in him.\n \u201cI\u2019ll have a dram,\u201d I told him. Then: \u201ckind of you to offer. Thanks. I didn\u2019t mean to . . . you know. Yell at you.\u201d\n He ignored this overture. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to Cambridge, I think?\u201d he asked, as we went through to the common room. \u201cReading University, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n \u201cReading born and bred,\u201d I replied, absently. I half-leaned, half-sat on one of the heaters to get warmth back into my marrow whilst Roy went off to his room to get the whisky. He was gone a while. Finally he came back with a bottle of Loch Lomond in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other. He handed me the former.\n I retrieved two tumblers from the cupboard, but Roy said: \u201cI\u2019ll not have the whisky, thank you anyway. I don\u2019t like the taste.\u201d\n This was about par, I thought, for the weirdo that he was\u2014bringing a bottle of scotch all the way to the end of the world, only not even to drink it. On the other hand the seal was broken, and about an inch was missing, so perhaps he had tried a taster and so discovered his animadversion. I honestly didn\u2019t care. I poured three fingers, and settled myself in one of the chairs.\n \u201cCheers!\u201d I said, raising a glass.\n \u201cGood health,\u201d he returned, propping his bum on the arm of the sofa.\n \u201cSo,\u201d I said, smacking my lips. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re drinking this means you\u2019ve solved the Fermi paradox?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re not drinking it,\u201d he said, with a little snorty laugh of self-satisfaction. \u201cYou are.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re such a pedant, Roy,\u201d I told him.\n \u201cTake that as a compliment,\u201d he said, smirking, and making odd little snorty-sniffy noises with his nostrils.\n \u201cSo? Does the fact that I\u2019m drinking this mean you\u2019ve solved it?\u201d\n \u201cThe answer to your question is: yes.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n I took another sip. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d\n \u201cAnd?\u201d\n He peered blankly at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cAnd? In the sense of: what\u2019s your solution?\u201d\n \u201cOh. The Fermi Paradox.\u201d He sounded almost bored. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you if you like.\u201d He seemed to ponder this. \u201cYeah,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s Kant.\u201d\n \u201cOf course it is,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cYou complete nutter.\u201d\n He looked hurt at this. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cI mean\u2014the best part of a year of our lives, millions of pounds sunk into this base, probably billions spent worldwide on SETI, and all we needed to do was open a seventeenth-century book of philosophy!\u201d\n \u201cEighteenth-century,\u201d he corrected me. \u201cAnd the kit, here, certainly has its uses.\u201d\n \u201cGlad to hear it! But\u2014Kant? Really?\u201d\n Roy took the smallest sip from his beer bottle, and then rubbed his own chin with his thumb. \u201cHard to summarize,\u201d he said. \u201cStart here: how do we know there\u2019s anything out there?\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2014out in space?\u201d\n \u201cNo: outside our own brains. Sense data, yes? Eyes, ears, nerve-endings. We see things, and think we\u2019re seeing things out there. We hear things, likewise. And so on. But maybe all that is a lie. Maybe we\u2019re hallucinating. Dreaming. How can we be sure there\u2019s anything really there?\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t this I think therefore I am?\u201d\n \u201cThe cogito, yes,\u201d said Roy, with that uniquely irritating prissy inflection he used when he wanted to convey his own intellectual superiority. \u201cThough Kant didn\u2019t have much time for Descartes, actually. He says I think therefore I am is an empty statement. We never just think, after all. We always think about something.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re losing me, Roy,\u201d I said, draining my whisky, and reaching for the bottle. Roy\u2019s eyes flashed, and I stopped. \u201cDo you mind if I have another?\u201d\n \u201cNo, no,\u201d he urged me, bobbing forward and back in an oddly bird-like way. \u201cGo right ahead.\u201d\n \u201cSo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re saying: we can\u2019t be sure if the cosmos is a kind of hallucination. Maybe I\u2019m a brain in a vat. So what? I\u2019ve got to act as if the universe is real, or,\u201d I directed a quick look at Roy, \u201cthey\u2019d lock me in the loony bin. So? Does this hallucination also include ET, or not?\u201d\n \u201cQuite right. Well, Kant says: there is a real world\u2014he calls it the ding-an-sich, the thing as it really is. There is such a reality. But our only access to that real world is through our perceptions, our senses and the way our thoughts are structured. So, says Kant, some of the things we assume are part of the world out there are actually part of the structure of our consciousness.\u201d\n \u201cSuch as?\u201d\n \u201cQuite basic things. Time and space. Causality.\u201d\n \u201cWait, Kant is saying that time, space, and causality aren\u2019t \u2018really\u2019 out there? They\u2019re just part of our minds?\u201d\n Roy nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s like if we always wore pink-tinted contact lenses. Like we\u2019d always worn them, ever since birth. Everything we saw would have a pink tint. We might very well assume the world was just\u2014you know, pink. But it wouldn\u2019t be the world that was pink, it would be our perception of the world.\u201d\n \u201cPink,\u201d I repeated, and took another slug. I was starting to feel drowsy.\n \u201cWe\u2019re all like that, all the time, except that instead of pink contact lenses on our eyes, we\u2019re wearing space-and-time contacts on our minds. Causality contacts.\u201d\n \u201cSpace and time are the way the universe is. Just is.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not what Kant says. He says: we don\u2019t really know the way the universe just is. All we know is how our perceptions and thoughts structure our understanding.\u201d\n \u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cKant says that cause and effect are just in our heads?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d I said. \u201cIf space and time and causality are just inside my head, then what\u2019s my head in? It takes up space, my brain. It takes time to think these thoughts.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s something out there,\u201d Roy agreed. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what it is. Here\u2019s a thought-experiment, Kant\u2019s thought-experiment. You can imagine an object in space, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n I grunted.\n \u201cOK,\u201d said Roy. \u201cAnd you can imagine the object being taken away. Yes? Then you have empty space. But you can\u2019t imagine space and time being taken away. You can\u2019t imagine no space, no time.\u201d\n I grunted again.\n \u201cThat shows that space, time, causality, and some other things\u2014they\u2019re part of the way the mind perceives. There\u2019s no getting behind them. Is the ding-an-sich itself structured according to that logic? We cannot know. Maybe, maybe not.\u201d\n \u201cDing,\u201d I said, my eyelid slipping down my eyeballs, \u201clike a microwave oven?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re looking for aliens with visual telescopes and radio telescopes,\u201d said Roy, standing up and putting his beer bottle down. \u201cBut whatever tools we use, we\u2019re looking for aliens in space and time, aliens that understand causality and number. But maybe those things are not alien. Those things are the way our minds are built. And that means we\u2019re looking in the wrong place. We should not be looking in space, or time. We should be looking in the ding-an-sich.\u201d\n \u201cSick,\u201d I said, My eyes were shut now. I didn\u2019t seem to be able to open them. Such muscular operation was beyond my volitional control. \u201cI feel a bit sick, actually.\u201d\n \u201cDing,\u201d I heard him say, at the other end of a very long corridor. \u201cYou\u2019re done. Let\u2019s open the microwave door, now, shall we?\u201d\n I suppose I was asleep. I tried to shift position in bed, but my arms were numb. Sometimes you lie on an arm and it goes dead. But this was both my arms. They were up over my head. A scraping sound. Distantly. I tried to pull my arms down but they were already down. This is the chance, somebody was saying, or muttering, or I don\u2019t know. Perhaps I was imagining it. We\u2019ve never had this chance before. Because although human consciousness is structured by the Kantian categories of apperception, there\u2019s nothing to say that computer perception needs to suffer from the same limitations. It\u2019s all a question of programming! A program to sift the Centauri data so as to get behind the limitations of consciousness.\n I was moving. Everything was dark, dark, dark. My arms were trailing behind me, I thought; and something was pulling my legs, I thought; and I was sliding along on my back. Was that right? Could that be right?\n We look out from our planet and see a universe of space, and time, of substance and causality, of plurality and totality, of possibility and probability\u2014and we forget that what we\u2019re actually seeing are the ways our minds structure the ding-an-such according to the categories of space, and time, of substance and causality, of plurality and totality, of possibility and probability. We look out and we see no aliens, and are surprised. But the real surprise would be to see aliens in such a vista, because that would mean the aliens are in our structures of thought. Sure there are aliens. Of course there are! But they don\u2019t live in our minds. They live in the ding-an-sich.\n The motion stopped, but I was still too sluggish to move, or speak, or even open my eyes. The next thing I knew, somebody was kissing me on the lips. Goodbye, was a word, and it floated around. Then nothing.\n O dark, dark, dark, they all go into the\u2014\n Or.\n Or something. It came upon me slowly. It, as it were, crept up on me. I couldn\u2019t as yet put a name to it. Let me think through the necessary and contingent possibilities, I thought to myself. It could have been a letter from my Mum, in which case it was full of family trivia and Roy\u2019s just yanking my chain for the hell of it. He\u2019s certainly capable of that. The thing, whatever it was, was closer now, or larger somehow, or in some sense more present, although I still couldn\u2019t put a name to it. It could have been a letter from a friend, or from Leicester Lenny, but if so it would only say Q-B4 ch! or Kn-R7 or something, and that could mean nothing at all to Roy. Or it could have been a letter from Professor Addlestone of Reading University, blathering on about something. Or it could have been, the thing was all around me now, or all within me, or otherwise pressing very imminently upon me. Or it could have been from Lezlie. But then, what? It was full of the usual blandishments? In which case Roy\u2019s hoarding of it is creepy but, in the larger scheme of things, unimportant. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m afraid of though, is it? I\u2019m afraid the letter says: I\u2019m leaving you, I\u2019ve found someone else. But but but, if it is, then I\u2019ll find out eventually\u2014won\u2019t I. I just need to be patient. I\u2019ll find out in time. Assuming I have time\u2014\n Cold. That was the thing.\n That was what had crept up on me.\n I sat up. I was outside, in the darkness, in my indoor clothes. Scalded with the cold. My whole body shook with a Parkinsonian tremor. I angled my head back and the stars were all there, the Southern Fish, the Centaur and the Dove; the Southern Cross itself; Orion and Hydra low in the sky; Scorpion and Sagittarius high up. Hydra and Pegasus. I breathed in fire and burned my throat and lungs. It was cold enough to shear metal. It was cold enough to freeze petrol.\n I got to my feet. My hands felt as though they had been dipped in acid, and then that sensation stopped and I was more scared than before. There was nothing at the end of my arms at all. I tried rubbing my hands together, but the leprous lack of sensation and the darkness and my general sluggishness meant I could not coordinate the action. My hands bounced numbly off one another. I became terrified of the idea that I perhaps knocked one or more fingers clean off. It looks ridiculous as I write it down, but there, in the dark, in the cold, the thought of it gripped my soul horribly.\n I had to get inside, to get warm. I had to get back to the base. I was shuddering so hard I was scared I might actually lose balance with the shivering and fall down\u2014in which case I might not be able to get back up again. Ghastly darkness all about. Cold beyond the power of words to express.\n I turned about, and about again. Starlight in the faintest of lights. I could see my breath coming out only because of the vast ostrich-feature-shaped blot that twisted in my field of vision, blocking out the stars. I needed to pick a direction and go. But I couldn\u2019t see any lights to orient me. What if I stumbled off in the wrong direction? I could easily stagger off into the wilderness, miss the base altogether. I\u2019d be dead in minutes.\n I addressed myself: take hold of yourself. You were dragged here\u2014Roy dragged you here. Runty Roy; he couldn\u2019t have removed me very far from the base. Presumably he figured I wouldn\u2019t wake up; that I\u2019d just die there in the dark.\n \u201cOK,\u201d I said, and took another breath\u2014knives going down my throat. I had to move. I started off, and stumbled over the black ground through the black air. I began to fall forward\u2014my thigh muscles were cramping\u2014and picked up my pace to stop myself pitching onto my face. My inner ear still told me I was falling, so I ran faster. Soon I was sprinting. It\u2019s possible the fluids in my inner ear had frozen, or glued-up with the cold, I don\u2019t know. It felt as if I were falling, but my feet were still pounding over the ice, invisible below me. I felt like a diver, tumbling from the top board.\n And then I saw the sea\u2014I was at the coast. Obviously I wasn\u2019t at the coast because that was hundreds of miles from the base. But there it was, visible. There was a settlement on the shore, a mile below me, with yellow lights throwing shimmery ovals over the water. There was a ship, lit up like a Christmas decoration, balanced very precisely on top of its own lit reflection. I must have been ten degrees of latitude, or more, further away from the pole, enough to lift the moon up over the horizon. The texture of the sea was a million burrin-marks of white light on a million wavelets, like pewter. There was no doubting what I was seeing. My whole body trembled with pain, with the cold, and I said to myself I\u2019m dying, and I\u2019m hallucinating because I\u2019m dying. I must have run in the wrong direction. I felt as if I\u2019d been running all my life, all my ancestors\u2019 lives combined.\n There was a weird inward flip, or lurch, or clonic jerk, or something folding over something else. I was conscious of thinking: I\u2019ve run the wrong way. I\u2019ve missed the base.\n And there was the base. Now that I was there, I could see that Roy had covered the common room window on the inside with something\u2014cloth, cardboard\u2014to make a blackout screen. He had not wanted me to see the light and follow it as a beacon. Now that I was there, I could just make out the faint line of illumination around the edges. I couldn\u2019t feel my hands, or my feet, and my face was covered with a pinching, scratchy mask\u2014snot, tears, frost, whatever, frozen by the impossible cold to a hard crust.\n I slumped against the wall, and the fabric of my shirt was so stiffened it snapped. It ripped clean away when I got up.\n The door. I had to get to the door\u2014that was when I saw . . . \u201d I was going to say when I saw them but the plural doesn\u2019t really describe the circumstance. Not that there was only one, either. It is very hard to put into words. There was the door, in front of me, and just enough starlight to shine a faint glint off the metal handle. I could not use my hands, so I leaned on the handle with my elbow, but of course it did not give way. Locked, of course locked. And of course Roy would not be opening for me this time. Then I saw\u2014what I saw. Data experiences of a radically new kind. Raw tissues of flesh, darkness visible, a kind of fog (no: fog is the wrong word). A pillar of fire by night, except that \u201cit\u201d did not burn, or gleam, or shine. \u201cIt\u201d is the wrong word for it. \u201cIt\u201d felt, or looked, like a great tumbling of scree down an endless slope. Or rubble gathering at the bottom and falling up the mountain. Forwards, backwards.\n It was the most terrifying thing I ever saw.\n There was a hint of\u2014I\u2019m going to say, claws, jaws, a clamping something. A maw. Not a tentacle, nothing so defined. Nor was it a darkness. It made a low, thrumming chiming noise, like a muffled bell sounding underground, ding-ding, ding-ding. But this was not a sound-wave sort of sound. This was not a propagating expanding sphere of agitated air particles. It was a pulse in the mind. It was a shudder of the soul.\n I could not get inside the base, and I was going to die. I felt the horrid cold in the very core of my being. Then \u201cit,\u201d or \u201cthey,\u201d or the boojummy whatever the hell (I choose my words carefully, here) it was, expanded. Or undid whatever process of congealing that brought it\u2014I don\u2019t know.\n Where I stood experienced a second as-it-were convulsive, almost muscular contraction. Everything folded over, and flipped back again. \u201cIt,\u201d or \u201cthey\u201d were not here any longer. In fact they had been here eons ago, or were not yet here at all.\n I was standing inside the common room.\n Do not demand to know how I passed beyond the locked door. I could not tell you.\n The warmth of the air burned my throat. I could no longer stay standing. I half slumped, half fell sideways, and my arm banged against one of the heaters\u2014it felt like molten metal, and I yelled. I rolled off it and lay on the floor, and breathed and breathed.\n I may have passed out. I have no idea how I got inside. I was probably only out for a few moments, because the next thing I knew was that my hands were in agony. Absolute agony! It felt like the gomjabbar, like they had both been stuffed into a tub of boiling water. Looking back I can now say what it was: it was sensation returning to my frostbitten flesh. But by God I\u2019ve never felt such pain. I screamed and screamed like the Spanish Inquisition had gone to work on me. I writhed, and wept like a baby.\n Somehow I dragged myself into a sitting posture, with my back against the wall and my legs straight out on the floor. Roy was standing in the common room doorway. In his right hand he was holding what I assumed was a gun, although I later realized it was a flare pistol.\n \u201cYou murdering bastard,\u201d I said, \u201chave you come to finish the job? You going to shoot me down like a dog?\u201d Or that\u2019s what I tried to say. What came out was: \u201cyrchyrchorchorchorch.\u201d God, my throat was shredded.\n \u201cThe thing-in-itself,\u201d he said. There was a weird bend in his voice. I blinked away the melting icicles from my eyelashes and saw he was crying. \u201cThe thing-as-such. The thing per se. I have experienced it unmediated.\u201d His face was wet. Tears slippy-sliding down, and dripping like snot from his jowls. I\u2019d never seen him like that before.\n \u201cWhat,\u201d I croaked, \u201cdid you put in my whisky?\u201d Oh God, the pain in my hands! And now my feet were starting to rage and burn too. Oh, it was ghastly.\n He stopped crying, and wiped his face in the crook of his left arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. Even at this juncture he was not able to look me in the eye. He lifted his right hand slowly, holding the flare pistol, until he was holding it across his chest, like James Bond in the posters.\n I was weeping\u2014not because I was scared of dying, but just because my hands and feet hurt with such sharp and focused intensity.\n Roy took a breath, lifted the flare pistol to his own head, and pulled the trigger. There was a crunching bang, and Roy flopped to the ground. The common room was filled with fluorescent red-orange light and an extraordinarily loud hissing sound. For a moment we were in a luridly lit stage-set of Hades.\n What had happened was this: the tip and fuse of the flare projectile had lodged itself in Roy\u2019s skull, and had ejected the illumination section and its little asbestos parachute at the ceiling, where it snagged against the polystyrene tiles and burned until it was all burned out.\n I sat in that ferociously red-lit room, with molten chunks of polystyrene dripping onto the carpet. Then the shell itself burned free and fell to the ground, where it fizzled out.\n Roy was not dead. Nor was I, amazingly. It took me a while, and an effort, and the whole way along I was sobbing and begging the cosmos to take the pain away; but I got to the radio, and called for help. They sent an air ambulance, which laid a pattern of flares on the unlit runway during their first flyby and landed alongside them on their second. It took four hours, but they got to us, and we did not die in the interval.\n I crawled back to Roy, unconscious on the floor, and pulled the shell-tip from the side of his head. There was no blood, although the dent was very noticeable\u2014the skin and hair lining the new thumb-sized cavity all the way in. There was little I could do, beyond put him in the recovery position.\n Then I clambered painfully on the sofa, my hands and feet hurting a little less. Then, surprisingly enough, I fell asleep\u2014Roy had dissolved a sleeping tablet in the whisky, of course, to knock me out; and when the pain retreated just enough the chemical took effect. I was woken by the sound of crashing, and crashing, and crashing, and then one of the ambulance men came through the main door with an axe in his hand.\n We were flown to Halley, on the coast\u2014the subject of my vision, or whatever that had been. We were hospitalized, and questioned, and my hands were treated. I lost two fingers on my left hand and one on my right, and my nose was rescued with a skin graft that gives it, to this day, a weird patchwork-doll look. I lost toes too, but I care less about those. Roy was fine: they opened his skull, extracted a few fragments of bone, and sewed him up. Good as new.\n I don\u2019t think they believed his version of events, although for myself I daresay he was truthful, or as truthful as circumstances permit. The official record is that he had a nervous breakdown, drugged me, left me outside to die, and then shot himself. He himself said otherwise. I\u2019ve read the transcript of his account. I\u2019ve even been in the same room with him as he was questioned. \u201cI saw things as they really are, things per se, I had a moment\u2014that\u2019s the wrong word, it is not measured in moments, it has always been with me, it will always be with me\u2014a moment of clarity.\u201d\n \u201cAnd your clarity was: kill your colleague?\u201d\n He wanted the credit all to himself, I think. He believed he was the individual destined to make first contact with alien life. He wanted me out of the way. He didn\u2019t say that, of course, but that\u2019s what I think. His explanation was: my perceptions, my mental processes and imagination, would collapse the fragile disintermediating system he was running to break through to the thing-as-such. I confess I don\u2019t see how that would work. Nonetheless: he insists that this was his motive for killing me. Indeed, he insists that my reappearance proved the correctness of his decision, the necessity for my death\u2014because by coming back at the time I did, I broke down the vision of the ding-an-sich, or reasserted the prison of categorical perception, or something, and the aliens fled\u2014or not fled, because their being is not mappable with a succession of spatial coordinates the way ours are. But: I don\u2019t know. Evaporate. Collapse away to nothing. Become again veiled. He wrote me several long, not terribly coherent letters about it from Broadmoor. I still prefer the earlier explanation. He was a nerd, not right in the head, and a little jealous of me.\n So, yes. He happened to buy Lezlie\u2019s Dear John. She couldn\u2019t cope with the long-distances, the time lags between us meeting up, she\u2019d met someone else . . . \u201d the usual. After he drugged me and left me outside to die, Roy left the letter, carefully opened and smoothed out, face up on the desk in my room. It was going to be the explanation for my suicide. People were to believe: I couldn\u2019t handle the rejection, and had just walked out into the night.\n His latest communication with me from Broadmoor begged me to \u201cgo public\u201d with what I had seen; so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. You\u2019ll grasp from this that I don\u2019t know what I saw. I suppose it was a series of weird hallucinations brought on by the extreme cold and the blood supply intermitting in my brain. Or something, I don\u2019t know. I still dream about them. It. Whatever. And the strange thing is: although I know for a fact I encountered it (them, none, whatever) for the first time in Antarctica, in 1986, it feels\u2014it feels deep in my bones\u2014as if I have always known about them. As if they visited me in my cradle. They didn\u2019t, of course.\n I saw the John Carpenter film The Thing for the first time recently. That wasn\u2019t one of the VHS tapes they gave us, back then, to watch on base. For obvious reasons. That\u2019s not what it was like for me at all. That doesn\u2019t capture it at all. They, or it, or whatever, were not thing-y.\n They are inhuman. But this is only my dream of them, I think. But it is not a dream of a human. It is not a dream of a thing. Or it is, but of a sick kind of thing. And, actually, no. That\u2019s not it.\n He keeps writing me.

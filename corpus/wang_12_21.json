An orange California morning.\n Tom snapped his fingers, the waiter understood and came and refilled his cup with fragrant coffee. The sun shone on their table and the street outside was crowded. Adriana didn\u2019t know what kind of romance might transpire. The future was difficult to predict.\n Tom talked to her about army life, who had the sweatiest feet in the platoon, a chemical weapons-grade stench; who was the best marksman, a regular deadeye; the guy who used a lighter to illuminate a stealthy, nocturnal letter-writing session and ended up igniting his army blanket.\n And then Adriana saw it hovering outside the window: a drone, with a small flower basket hanging from it. It seemed to confirm its target with facial recognition, then dodged nimbly through the crowd, took advantage of the partially open door, and entered the restaurant. Adriana stared, wide-eyed, not daring to believe as the drone landed before her. Tom stood and took a sapphire blue box from the basket. Inside was a diamond ring, seemingly alive with accumulated power, awaiting deployment.\n \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d Tom asked, getting down on one knee.\n \u2014Excerpt from Future War\n 1A\n Lately I\u2019ve been thinking of how you were at six or seven years old: howling every time you got a haircut, the unruly face freckles. In the early years of the Qing government, the imperial court compelled commoners of the former dynasty to shave their heads. People wept, wailed at Heaven, beat their heads on the ground, and wanted to die.\n (If you had read that General Summary of World History I sent you, you would know this story happened in China, not India. This has nothing to do with Buddhism.)\n Anyway, the ancient Chinese followed a mysterious ideology. They believed your body, and skin, and hair, all of you, was bestowed by your parents. To harm any of it was unfilial. And you abhorred haircuts more than them! This continued until your sophomore year in college, when you finally settled on your ideal hairstyle, a cut and color that caused me to fly into a rage. Everyone is agitated by trifles to some extent. You for instance have been more sensitive than most, since childhood. Don\u2019t try to refute this, honey. No one knows you better than me, including yourself.\n I am one of your two creators, after all.\n When you were eight or nine\u2014you couldn\u2019t have been older, I remember buying a birthday cake around then, and the complementary candles weren\u2019t yet double-digits\u2014strange that I always recall these irrelevant details. Anyway, that day you took the school bus home. Your cheek was bruised, tears still glistening on your face. I was carefully following a dinner recipe, dicing carrots and onions, a dash of salt and pepper.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter honey?\u201d I ran to you as fast as a middle-aged woman could.\n \u201cMom . . . \u201d you began, then asked that question, the Big One, officially and for the first time.\n I\u2019d known it was coming sooner or later. Unavoidable, a game I was destined to lose. All I could do was be vigilant and wait for you to find a weakness and break through the defensive line.\n \u201cWhere\u2019s my dad anyway?\u201d\n I knew how to console a boy not yet ten years old. I had a methodology, easy and on hand, tried and tested, but in the end, you\u2019d grow up. And I never thought of an answer to this question that seemed right. I could only procrastinate, delay, obfuscate, evade. This was my final and ultimate tactic.\n Nowadays my time is limited.\n The caregiver does her rounds after dinner. She gets my temperature from my healthcare ring, and my blood pressure and other parameters.\n \u201cRemember to drink a glass of Manuka honey water before bed,\u201d she exhorts, \u201cand for all that\u2019s good and holy, don\u2019t forget to use warm water, not boiling water.\u201d She always makes a point of this, as if I\u2019m suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s rather than breast cancer.\n After she leaves, Rothman in the neighboring bed observes: \u201cEasy on the eyes, that little vixen.\u201d He wistfully adds: \u201cIf I were twenty years younger . . . \u201d\n He\u2019s recovering from a stroke. Many in his condition become less articulate, but since his treatment he\u2019s been quite loquacious. To be honest, I often think of applying for a room change, though much of the time his chatter is amusing. I\u2019m a writer. Dialogue keeps me clearheaded and stimulated. Stimulated to write, just to be clear. People imagine writers to be well-spoken and glib, but I\u2019m not much of a talker. I need someone to take the lead in conversation.\n Moreover, and quite coincidentally, he has the same name as a supporting character in one of my novels.\n \u201cIf I were twenty years younger,\u201d I say, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t even notice her.\u201d\n \u201cYour husband was a lucky man, obviously, but let\u2019s face it . . . you\u2019re old. And if he were still kicking around, he\u2019d be ogling the Little Vixen, not you.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n I don\u2019t bother elaborating because I\u2019m pissed. A line from a novel once left a deep impression on me: \u201cTime cannot remember, time can only forget.\u201d But time doesn\u2019t forget everything. Of this I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m not just weaving dazzling prose here\u2014I mean it. It\u2019s been a guiding principle throughout my life.\n I decide to go out for a stroll. The hospital has a small park for patient R&R. When the weather\u2019s good I like to putter about after dinner. Reckoning dusk will supply a breeze and a nice glow, I pick up my shawl, turn, and find you at the door.\n I\u2019m surprised at first. I know I should be moved, but I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t want to lie to you. Apart from our Great Matter, which I don\u2019t yet know how to put into words, I wish to be totally forthcoming.\n Why have you come?\n 1B\n \u201cWhy have you come?\u201d\n You can\u2019t know how much it hurts to hear you say that.\n The surprise on your face stabs deep, and then comes the familiar guilt. How long has it been since I last visited? I even feel presumptuous, just showing up like this, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t phone ahead of time.\n Besides, I don\u2019t think a son should need a reservation to visit his elderly mother.\n I remember that from the time I consigned you to this facility, all the way to your death\u2014about five years\u2014I can count the number of times I visited on one hand. Less than once a year, on average. I hope you can forgive me. These years have been very important to me\u2014vital in fact. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t be standing before you now.\n \u201cI came to see you,\u201d I say.\n \u201cJust in time then. Come on a walk with me.\u201d You drape that shawl over your shoulders, the one with the peony pattern, and take me by the hand. Your hand is emaciated and bony. I\u2019m careful not to apply much force, gently harboring it in my palm. When did you start growing old? Why didn\u2019t I notice? Is it the constant insomnia? The lack of appetite? Or did you wake up one morning and suddenly lose your last bit of patience for this horror-show world?\n \u201cDaisy doing okay?\u201d You bring me to the little park, and we sit on a bench. There\u2019s already a trace of autumn in the air. A few dead leaves adorn the bench. You pick one up and fiddle with it. It\u2019s a Chinese Ash leaf, its vascular network clearly visible.\n I think about your question.\n Daisy should be on a business trip to China at the moment. I can\u2019t recall which city, though I know she\u2019s been there before. Everything I know of China comes from the news and from that hardcover you once gave me. Beijing, Shanghai, and Taiwan are often mentioned in the news. As for your book, all I remember is the Qing dynasty and something about braids or queues. So I tell it like it is: part of the reason for my visit is because of Daisy. To avoid her, really. She\u2019ll be back from China soon, and she\u2019ll put that unwelcome proposal to me, and we\u2019ll have a big fight about it and trigger another six-month cold war. During that time, I\u2019ll be on intimate terms with the cot at the laboratory. We\u2019ll be together on Christmas day, and together we\u2019ll quarrel. You\u2019ll call, and I won\u2019t be in the mood to answer. I\u2019ll guess you called merely to ask how I am, and regardless of how I am, I would just give the polite answer: \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d It would be you engaging in motherly self-deception, a psychological comfort; and me, as a son, attempting to conceal yet being exposed, a kind of self-hypnosis.\n \u201cDaisy\u2019s a good girl,\u201d you say, gaze locked on the dead leaf. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s so fascinating about a dead leaf. You should be looking at me. Look at me. Your son is back.\n I know she\u2019s a \u201cgood girl,\u201d of course. I knew it long before you did, and better. In our university poetry club, I was keen on her the first time she recited:\n \u201cShe walks in beauty like the night\n Of cloudless climes and starry skies;\u201d\n We fell in love, went through breakups and reunions, and eventually got married. We enjoyed the same hobbies and points of view. We both hated nihilism and supported the Boston Red Sox. We reunited once at Fenway Park, the oldest venue in the league still in use, able to accommodate ten thousand people. She couldn\u2019t believe it when I told her that. But she understood me. She got me\u2014that\u2019s the most important thing. When I told her my precondition for marriage, she didn\u2019t immediately veto it, like my previous two girlfriends had. She said she\u2019d think it over.\n Half a month later she said: \u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201d\n I was pleasantly surprised, and also doubtful. \u201cAre you sure you can stick to the DINK lifestyle? It\u2019s easy to say so, but maybe harder to put into practice.\u201d\n She kissed my forehead. \u201c\u2018One shade more, one ray less, had half impaired the nameless grace\u2019 . . . why not enjoy a romantic world of two?\u201d\n So yes, Daisy is a \u201cgood girl,\u201d and a good wife, but now, unfortunately, she wants to be a good mother too.\n \u201cBy the way . . . \u201d you say, suddenly breaking the silence. \u201cI received an email from Bill yesterday. Guess what.\u201d\n \u201cBill?\u201d For a moment I can\u2019t recall who that is, but obviously I should know him. Dammit. Memory linkage dislocation. At the lab, we call this phenomenon \u201cspace-time fall early stage oscillative disorder.\u201d It\u2019s something like high-altitude de-acclimatization syndrome, or HADAS.\n \u201cBill, my agent? Wears Tommy Bahama shirts all year \u2019round? Bald, eats like a bear and could probably wrestle one, meticulous in his work? You know fiction writing is all I\u2019m good for. When it comes to contracts and copyrights, I\u2019m hopeless, so thank God for Bill.\u201d\n Now I remember: the man who can eat three Big Macs as an appetizer. Uncle Bill.\n \u201cHow is he?\u201d\n \u201cFine. He contacted a publishing house for me.\u201d\n \u201cThey finally want to publish your complete works?\u201d\n You laugh, your voice clear and bright. \u201cI\u2019m no Asimov, just lucky to have written two bestsellers. Publishing the complete works of a third-rate sci-fi author like me requires great courage and clever vision. Bill negotiated an autobiography for me, royalties and print run, both very impressive.\u201d\n An autobiography? But I don\u2019t have this book. Could it be you never finished writing it? When I return I\u2019ll have to investigate online.\n \u201cNot too shabby,\u201d I say.\n \u201cI said no. My life\u2019s story is already written into my fiction. Read my fiction and you can see my life.\u201d\n Ah, so that\u2019s it.\n The sky is slowly darkening. I\u2019ve always had this strange feeling that spring and summer nights rise from the earth, while fall and winter nights descend from the sky. The park\u2019s path lights come on.\n You turn to look at me. With deep feeling you say: \u201cHow long has it been since you stopped reading my fiction?\u201d\n 2\n Nobody knows what happened.\n The staff sergeant conveyed the sergeant major\u2019s orders. The sergeant major relayed the captain\u2019s orders. The captain passed on the lieutenant general\u2019s orders:\n Assemble.\n The staff sergeant roused Tom and his roommate from deep sleep. Tom had been lost in a beautiful dream. Adriana had been pregnant. He\u2019d been dreaming of this for years and pining for it day and night. It was his refuge.\n The staff sergeant gripped a list of names. Roll-called soldiers fell out.\n \u201cPrivate Tom Richards!\u201d\n He stepped forward, hands still thrust behind his waist.\n The chosen got on a military bus. Tom quietly speculated with the man seated beside him. No one really knew the purpose of this trip. Tom had never been selected for such mysterious field training in his three years of service. They theorized they were headed to the border to hunt cartel soldiers.\n The bus stopped on an airport tarmac. The gruff staff sergeant herded them onto an aircraft, and Tom began to realize the situation was far more complicated than he\u2019d imagined.\n The plane landed three hours later. Tom had no idea where he was.\n Stupefied, he found himself among myriad parked aircraft, and soldiers from various branches of the armed forces, all in formation. He spotted a man with a vividly scarred face. Kubrick\u2019s Full Metal Jacket came to mind. Sure enough, a torrent of foul language spewed forth from the scarred face, mocking, ridiculing, sparing no one and no race.\n \u201cAll you maggots listen up, because next time I choose to enlighten you I can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll still have your fucking ears!\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t the least bit funny. No one so much as snorted.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got ourselves a war!\u201d\n So that was it. Off to Afghanistan, the only war going at the moment\u2014but Tom soon realized he was mistaken. When Scarface was through with his rant, they were packed into some kind of massive battleship, the biggest Tom had ever seen. In fact, he thought, perhaps it ought to be called a spaceship. They weren\u2019t going to Afghanistan. They were going to Proxima Centauri b.\n Of course, at that Time, Tom wasn\u2019t familiar with Proxima Centauri b. He didn\u2019t even know the Centaurus constellation.\n He couldn\u2019t decide if it was hilarious or not.\n It was like he\u2019d stumbled into a third-rate sci-fi novel, bound for the front lines, for a fight to the death with Bugs or Na\u2019vi. It was four point three lightyears from Earth to Proxima Centauri b, Sol\u2019s closest neighbor, yet at the ship\u2019s speed this gulf was unfathomably long. Hibernation berths? Subspace jumps? The two familiar yet strange terms flashed through Tom\u2019s mind. It was 2006. These pedestrian, tacky technologies from sci-fi novels were still fantasies in real life. This distracted Tom more than the enemy they were about to face. Of course, he missed his Honey Bunny more than ever. It occurred to Tom that they were perhaps, at this moment, the most separated lovers in the universe.\n Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\n Tom recalled the night he left, recalled Adriana wrapped around him, the aftermath, dripping with sweat, when she said to him: \u201cLet\u2019s have a baby, soldier. It can keep me company when you\u2019re not around.\u201d\n \u2014Excerpt from Future War\n 2A\n I used to think getting old was a prolonged affair, but it\u2019s actually a moment. Before that moment, you\u2019re in your prime\u2014afterward you\u2019re withering away. I think of death as a remote thing, and when it comes, it catches people off guard.\n Yes, I\u2019m thinking of what happened to your father.\n Everyone has their fatal weakness. You\u2019ve always been a confident person, but afraid to make speeches, and I have my own foibles. I won\u2019t even try to enumerate your father\u2019s quirks. Now that I\u2019m preparing to meet death, I can finally remember things with a calm heart.\n We were in senior high school together, and superficially, you couldn\u2019t have found two people more ill-suited to each other. Believe it or not, I debuted in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in my sophomore year, a fantasy story, a wizard, and a dragon in an enchanted forest; whereas your father was a jock, a track-and-field-er. I never saw him sit still for more than a minute, apart from attending class. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the army, and I followed my businessman father to New Jersey. We later met at a party. He was taller and sturdier, and a more entertaining conversationalist. He had everyone rapt with his military stories, transfers, ribbons, and medals, among these tales a purple heart and how he got it.\n I thought he\u2019d long since forgotten me, but he said, \u201cAnna, are you still writing?\u201d\n I was actually flattered\u2014not to mention embarrassed\u2014by his attention. In a limping manner I said, \u201cWriting . . . well, basically, you could call me a freelancer these days?\u201d\n \u201cVery cool! When I return to base, I can brag to all those uncultured grunts that one of my classmates is a bona fide author. Still writing fantasy?\u201d\n \u201cSci-fi nowadays.\u201d\n \u201cAwesome.\u201d It was blind and awkward flattery, since he probably couldn\u2019t have told me the difference between fantasy and science fiction.\n We traded emails and I soon got my first message from him. They\u2019d joined forces with Mexican police in a cross-border operation against the cartels. His brother-in-arms, who had slept in the bunk above him, had been killed in action.\n Your father had been standing just behind and to the left of him. He\u2019d watched him go down. He described the hideous face of death, how it had been within reach at that moment. I didn\u2019t know how to console him. I\u2019d just turned twenty. I had only a literal, or literary, understanding of death. I sat at the computer all night mulling it over. That email was harder to draft and develop than any novel.\n Seeing the sent notification, I suddenly realized I might fall in love with him.\n Just last month my agent Bill asked if I\u2019d be interested in writing an autobiography. I declined. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to write it\u2014it was that I already had. If you ever start reading my fiction again, you will come to understand me. But I know that since senior high, you\u2019ve avoided my fiction like unwelcome schoolwork.\n Rothman comes in, seemingly in high spirits.\n \u201cDid your daughter come see you?\u201d I say.\n \u201cNo, I\u2019ve given up on that, just like you\u2019ve given up on your son.\u201d\n Fair enough.\n Since you sent me to this nursing home, we\u2019ve vanished from each other\u2019s lives. I know you\u2019re busy, of course. I haven\u2019t experienced lab work, but many people like you have come to life beneath my pen. Workaholics on the tech frontier are science fiction\u2019s eternal plug-and-play protagonists. So, I get it, in a sense. From a kind of \u201cexperienced\u201d point of view, I understand, and I can forgive you. You\u2019re making history. Compared with history, any individual\u2019s feelings are trivial. I understand, and I can forgive, but I can\u2019t help complaining. When you reach my age, you\u2019ll understand I\u2019m not just causing drama for drama\u2019s sake.\n When did it become unreasonable and dramatic to miss one\u2019s child?\n \u201cI just went on a date,\u201d Rothman says. \u201cA movie with a certain someone. Guess who!\u201d Unable to wait for my guess, he says, \u201cThe Little Vixen!\u201d\n \u201cGimmee a break. You\u2019re sixty years old.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, sixty . . . half my life still ahead of me!\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be older than her father.\u201d\n \u201cIf the day ever comes, he\u2019ll be my father-in-law, and he can call me big bro.\u201d\n \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n \u201cWorth a shot, and if I\u2019m in the market for a partner, why not a young knockout?\u201d\n \u201cYour daughter will be thrilled, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n \u201cSorry, but she has no right to veto my happiness. A once-a-year visitor doesn\u2019t get to tell me what kind of woman I should pursue. I won\u2019t allow it. Anyway, why not find a young hunk for yourself? Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t thought about it. Look at which finger your ring\u2019s on.\u201d\n \u201cMy son\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t give a shit about you. How long has it been?\u201d\n And that\u2019s when you enter, the sun on your face. \u201cTalking about people behind their backs, Rothman? Not a good look.\u201d\n 2B\n Hangzhou.\n Daisy went there on a business trip once. That peony shawl is a specialty local product she got you there. She bought two\u2014the other embroidered with a phoenix\u2014and let me choose. I chose the peony for you, thinking it more suited to your personality. When you unwrapped the gift, the gentle smile on your face proved I\u2019d chosen right. I\u2019ve always admired that in you but failed to inherit it: your completely open self-expression. People might think such frank emoting lacks subtlety and sophistication, but in my opinion it\u2019s rare sincerity.\n \u201cMaybe you should take that opportunity Bill got for you.\u201d\n I sit with you in the nursing home cafeteria. This time I\u2019ve chanced upon dinner. You ordered a pasta and salad. I went for chicken curry and whole wheat bread.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cThe autobiography.\u201d\n \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d\n Oh, right: in your world, our meeting last month never happened.\n \u201cYou told me on the phone. Remember?\u201d A white lie. You nod suspiciously. In the end you have no choice but to take my word for it. Time is merciless, and it\u2019s normal to forget things.\n \u201cI can\u2019t seem to write these days,\u201d you say. \u201cHow are you and Daisy?\u201d\n Not good.\n She\u2019ll be just back from Hangzhou. I\u2019ll be driving her home from the airport, she\u2019ll demand I pull over onto the freeway shoulder. She\u2019ll crawl over from shotgun, kissing me, gasping for breath, saying she wants me so bad she can\u2019t wait until we get home. Her teasing will get me going. My heart will race. We\u2019ve never done it in the car before and the strange locale will be exciting. But I\u2019ve always maintained a certain clearheadedness in these matters. I\u2019m not one of those dating app fuckboys. I don\u2019t keep a spare condom in the car. What kind of serious, decent person does that? If I want to continue enjoying this romantic interlude, I\u2019ll have to get out and buy a condom.\n And we\u2019ll be on that hazardous high-speed freeway shoulder.\n \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d she\u2019ll say. \u201cI want you now.\u201d\n \u201cBut you could get pregnant.\u201d\n \u201cNot likely.\u201d Kissing my ear, she\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019ve counted . . . this is the safe part of my cycle.\u201d\n \u201cBut we can reduce the probability to zero, so why take the risk?\u201d\n \u201cI want you now.\u201d\n She\u2019ll grow wilder as I calm down. Daisy rarely does this sort of thing. I mean, it will be quite spontaneous and bold for her. This won\u2019t be her first return from a long business trip, and it won\u2019t have been the longest. Something else will be going on. I\u2019ll refuse the sex. I\u2019ll ask her what it\u2019s all about. She\u2019ll light a cigarette and say:\n \u201cI want a child.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d I say.\n I don\u2019t want to disturb you with life\u2019s exigencies. If I tell you I have a toothache, it will not relieve the pain. It\u2019ll just worry you.\n \u201cOkay, what happened?\u201d Just like Daisy won\u2019t lie to me, I can\u2019t lie to you; Daisy and I have lived together seven years, but I spent seventeen years with you, day and night.\n \u201cCome on honey,\u201d you press. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n I don\u2019t know what to say. I couldn\u2019t have imagined dealing with something like this. Technically speaking, I have no \u201cexperience\u201d to draw on here.\n The incident in question hasn\u2019t occurred yet.\n \u201cMarriage crisis?\u201d you conjecture. \u201cSeven-year itch I\u2019m guessing? Actually, from what friends have told me, cheating tends to come around year five or so. I\u2019ll just say this . . . anyone can make a mistake, honey. But if you act in a timely manner to make amends, the marriage can be saved. I\u2019m guessing the problem started at work. Was it one of those grad students at your lab?\u201d\n \u201cMom, where are you going with this? I\u2019m your son.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what does that have to do with you cheating?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with cheating, okay? She wants children.\u201d\n And I lay it all out for you. Maybe you\u2019ll help me come up with a game plan. Even if you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll soon forget the whole thing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your memory, but you\u2019ll forget. This visit will never have happened.\n \u201cKids? Why? I mean, what happened?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. She started making demands when she came back from China. At this point she\u2019s a lot like you. You\u2019re both experts in keeping secrets.\u201d\n But no matter what happens, DINK is the cornerstone of our marriage. Violate this premise and the structure of the marriage is endangered. Children are a variable, an unknown. We who conduct experiments hate variables and unknowns more than anything.\n I watch you, waiting for your reply.\n \u201cRothman pursuing the Little Vixen,\u201d you say, clumsily changing the subject. \u201cWho\u2019d have thunk it?\u201d\n Seeing my blank look, you explain: \u201cThe Little Vixen is a nurse and caregiver here. Rothman gave her the nickname.\u201d\n \u201cWho\u2019s Rothman?\u201d\n Your expression changes. You want to say something but hesitate. We\u2019re completely out of touch with each other\u2019s lives. You don\u2019t know much about my research, though I\u2019ve wanted to tell you from the beginning. It would blow your mind, I know. You\u2019ve written time travel sci-fi for so long, and now I\u2019ve helped make it a reality\u2014at the cost of visiting you more often, of course.\n But who is this Rothman? Why is his pursuit of the Little Vixen so funny to you? You\u2019ve obviously lost the urge to explain. You seem content to allow the rift between us to persist and expand.\n I bow my head and finish the chicken nuggets wordlessly, then wipe the dish with the bread. You escort me to the door. We hug and kiss, like when I was a kid, the daily pre-bus-boarding routine.\n I turn to go, but you stop me.\n \u201cWhat is it Mom?\u201d\n \u201cThanks for coming to see me, really.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll come more often, for sure.\u201d\n You\u2019ll forget this promise in the blink of an eye. You\u2019ll return to that twilight I have yet to disturb, but I promise all the same. I\u2019m like a stone tossed in the heart of a lake. You are the lake, and after a brief ripple, you\u2019re as calm as ever.\n 3\n It didn\u2019t take so long. The spacecraft reached Proxima Centauri b in about half a year. Tom didn\u2019t know at the time what their means of propulsion was. He was sure Scarface wouldn\u2019t disclose the specific mechanism of flight. If Tom ventured to ask, the result must be punishment. The only question was would it be a ten nautical mile run or two hundred push-ups nonstop. By the distance units Scarface employed, Tom reckoned he\u2019d been a Navy man.\n They didn\u2019t practice using exoskeletons or any sophisticated sci-fi weapons during their six-month journey. Every day it was just PT. Like they weren\u2019t headed for battle with aliens. Like they were Earth\u2019s delegation to some cosmic Olympics.\n En route, Tom and his comrades prognosticated wildly. No matter what the enemy turned out to be, no matter what sort of teeth it bared, the men reckoned they were mentally prepared.\n But when they finally saw the legion confronting them, they were stunned. The enemy was human. They had the same five senses and four limbs as Tom and his brethren.\n Human.\n The war started like this: a thousand soldiers on our side, a thousand on theirs. A month later (reckoned according to Earth Time) the side with more alive would win. There could be no simpler, more primitive war. It was to be a large-scale gang brawl, each side representing its respective civilization. The victor would have permanent and perpetual habitation rights on Earth.\n \u2014Excerpt from Future War\n 3A\n Do you know what gives a mother the most satisfaction and pride? It\u2019s simple. It is her child\u2019s dependence upon her: the child coming home and calling out for Mom; the child unable to find something and calling out for Mom; the child not knowing what to do and calling out for Mom.\n For me, it was your strident demands for a bedtime story. You soon tired of routine fairy tales. I\u2019d say, \u201cLong, long ago,\u201d and you immediately knew a happy ending was coming. You begged me to read my own works aloud. You became a mad, obsessed fan, my number one fan, in fact. Every time I finished a story, you were my first reader.\n As time passed you started pointing out style deficiencies, structural problems, unrefined metaphorical language. You put the nitpickiest industry editors to shame. Of course, that all stopped when you reached high school. You studied physics and chemistry, math, and biology, even cosmology and history. You were fascinated by formulae, axioms, experiments.\n When I tried to read to you, you would say: \u201cCome on, Mom. Really? It\u2019s not scientific.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so? But I\u2019m a fiction writer, not a science popularizer.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what about the \u2018sci\u2019 in sci-fi? I suggest you read some Carl Sagan or Arthur C. Clarke.\u201d\n \u201cI appreciate your kind intentions, but I have my own selection criteria for what I read.\u201d\n You didn\u2019t even try to argue with me. You just shrugged with a look of, \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d\n Do you know what a mother most fears? Her child no longer needing her.\n This really is the saddest theorem in the world, but there\u2019s no avoiding it. You must grow, leave infancy behind, venture out of the nest, experience the cold and real world, navigate a complicated society. You must have your own life. You must create your own world, get married, be needed by another woman. Start a family and be a parent yourself. Oh, I almost forgot. You subscribe to the DINK lifestyle. Honey, I know the matter of your father still haunts you. That\u2019s life. There are always fetters of one kind or another, like common accidents and diseases.\n Seven years ago, when I learned that I was suffering from breast cancer, I didn\u2019t panic. On the contrary, I was relieved. For many years I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\n I think of your father every night, his radiant beauty, his perseverance and bravery. I think of our high school years, how he charged around violently through life, his apparent dimness of wit. At the time I really thought he was dumb. The muscle-bound twit, the jock: the simplest words and most convenient definitions. But then I got to know him. I discovered, or uncovered, his gentle side. He liked motorcycles. He was afraid of dogs. Such a big lug, yet a Chihuahua could get him cowering behind me. When his fourth transfer came\u2014he was a Marine Corps sergeant by then\u2014we traveled the Pacific Coast Highway on his motorcycle. At one point he pulled over and we got off to take in the view. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to marry me,\u201d he said. \u201cSay yes and we\u2019ll go to a church right now. Otherwise I\u2019ll leave you here. Friendly reminder . . . it\u2019s not easy to hitch a ride hereabouts.\u201d\n I smiled and extended my left hand. He got on one knee. Look, I admit it wasn\u2019t too romantic. The salty sea breeze nearly gave me a cold. But at the time, I mean, as one of the two concerned parties, I felt like the world was spinning. I couldn\u2019t imagine life getting any better.\n I extend my left hand. The skin is loose, almost translucent in places. Because of my weight loss, I had to move my wedding ring from ring finger to index.\n That\u2019s why Rothman teases me, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t thought about it. Look at which finger your ring\u2019s on.\u201d\n \u201cMy son\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDoesn\u2019t give a shit about you. How long has it been?\u201d\n \u201cHe has his career.\u201d\n \u201cAnd still has his mother. To be blunt, he still has decades to work. But how much longer will you live?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean by that? What do you know?\u201d\n \u201cMy Little Vixen told me your cancer cells have spread. You should\u2019ve told us, or your son at least. I bet he knows nothing about it. Do you want the nursing home to inform him when it\u2019s time to collect your body? Don\u2019t get mad at me for saying these things. I know it\u2019s ugly. Hey, my situation\u2019s not much better. I\u2019ve drafted my will. I may seem all full of vim and vigor, but I could die at any moment.\u201d He taps his temple. \u201cThere\u2019s a time bomb in here.\u201d\n \u201cSo you two really are an item?\u201d I ask, hoping to lighten the mood. You know me. If I want to escape a situation, I just change the subject.\n \u201cWell, no. She rejected me. Said she\u2019s not ready to settle just yet, but when she gets tired of the struggle, she might consider me. Hey, I\u2019ll take it! At least I tried, you know? And by the way, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you . . . a ring on your index finger means you\u2019re unmarried and looking.\u201d\n Rothman puts on his coat. I ask him where he\u2019s going.\n \u201cTo a bar,\u201d he says.\n Today is Christmas. The nursing home is decorated. How many Christmases have we spent apart? I really want to call you, so I do. You don\u2019t pick up. I assume you\u2019re busy with an experiment and will call back later, but you don\u2019t. Like I\u2019m harassing you. Like my call is a nuisance, not worthy of your attention.\n I\u2019m angry and sad again. I think of you constantly, but you never seem to think of me. Maybe Rothman is right. Maybe I should tell you.\n My dear boy, your mother is dying.\n 3B\n Last time I left, I promised to visit more often. But I broke that promise. Some problems have emerged with the experiment:\n According to Novikov\u2019s self-consistency principle, people can go back in time, but they cannot change history. A time traveler would be forced to act in such a way that a paradox couldn\u2019t occur. Ultimately, our world is a final ending that has been revised countless times, like one of your novels endlessly reworked before publication. DINK is the cornerstone of my marriage, and this principle is the governing standard of time travel. In fact, all our experiments have cleaved to this principle. Crossing over isn\u2019t as simple as you have it in your novels, or your favorite film About Time. To comply with Novikov\u2019s self-consistency principle, time travel must observe numerous restrictions. First of all, it\u2019s not a person that time travels, but a brain-state. I never traveled to the past\u2014my present self reacted, on a quantum level, with myself at a certain point in the past. I think you must know about quantum entanglement, spooky action-at-a-distance. Even at opposite ends of the universe, one particle may affect the state of another. This happens almost instantaneously. The transmission speed of quantum entanglement is at least four orders of magnitude higher than c. It turns out such entanglement may transmit across time as well as space. When my present self establishes a connection with my past self, my mind or self enters that past body. This is equivalent to going back in time. Think of it this way: my present self takes the helm of my past self. I can manipulate that past self, do things, but I cannot exceed a certain threshold. If I do, the connection is broken, as governed by Novikov\u2019s self-consistency principle.\n Over the years, via countless experiments, we\u2019ve assigned a value to the threshold that we call the Time Constant.\n If a time traveler\u2019s behavior exceeds the Time Constant, Novikov\u2019s principle comes into play and interrupts the entanglement. For instance, if I contemplate going back and buying a winning lottery ticket, that\u2019s just an idea. It doesn\u2019t matter. But if I tried to do it, the action would be banned. It\u2019s almost like blunt-force law enforcement from God. Then again, Arthur C. Clarke said a sufficiently advanced technology would be indistinguishable from magic. And all of this is just a drop in the bucket. There are many other parameters and restrictions. We can\u2019t go back to the end of the Cretaceous and see why the dinosaurs perished. We can\u2019t go back to ancient Egypt and see how the pyramids were built.\n We can go back a year at most.\n We call history that has already happened \u201coriginal history.\u201d It\u2019s supposed to be immutable. Even if a pauper goes back a year and manages to buy a winning lottery ticket, he\u2019ll still be poor after the connection terminates. We were always sure \u201coriginal history\u201d cannot be changed, but now there seem to be exceptions.\n There is a threshold governing disconnection, but there is wiggle room.\n We\u2019re going to be busy again. We must delineate the numerical range of this newfound wiggle room. Maybe we can find a stable channel between past and future, something that would convey information at least. Imagine the tragedies we might prevent. If you knew you were going to die in a car accident in three months. If you knew a certain life choice led to rock bottom.\n If I knew you were going to die in a year . . .\n 4\n \n A future energy crisis. Our high-tech descendants worried about living space. Lacking a wider perspective, forgoing a search for so-called Earth Twins, in their opinion the most suitable world for human existence is Earth itself, in the past. Their current Earth is ruined, but past Earth is a worthy goal. They travel to the past to compete with their ancestors (us) for Earth habitation rights.\n They reach an agreement with representatives of past Earth. Each side selects one thousand fighters to compete at Proxima Centauri b. The winner gets sovereignty of Earth. If the interlopers from the future win, they will be quietly integrated into management of Earth. The general public won\u2019t be aware of it. Future generations will have the tech to build spacecrafts. (Question: Could such high-tech future generations directly rule the past Earth? Need to find a balance. Logic. Self-consistency.)\n Our male protagonist, Tom (Pumpkin), participates in this war. He survives the tragic conflict. The Earth government of the past finally wins. They return in triumph on their spaceship, but the ship crashes and everyone is killed. There is a conspiracy to keep this secret.\n Tom\u2019s body is found in the ocean, somewhat preserved by the cold seawater, and is then put into cryofreeze. (Under what circumstances? Can seawater be cold enough to preserve sperm and make it dormant? Option B, a glacier. How can this be achieved? Follow up with relevant research.) The body was only sent to Adriana the following year, to inform her that Tom was killed during the mission.\n Adriana (neurosurgeon, a scene of her in action, performing surgery), when she gets Tom\u2019s body, learns he froze to death, then was quickly found and refrigerated, giving her a crazy idea.\n Rothman, the supporting male character, a surgeon, Adriana\u2019s colleague, secretly has a crush on her.\n \n \u2014From Anna\u2019s notes, some ideas for Future War.\n Late at night.\n Operating theater.\n Rothman carefully washed his hands and arms with soap and put on rubber gloves. His assistant, Adriana, put the disinfectant and the container full of liquid on the stainless-steel table. The air smelled of disinfectant. The atmosphere was cold and solemn.\n Rothman still couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d agreed to this. He\u2019d known that once he agreed, his doom was sealed. But if he refused\u2014well, he didn\u2019t know how to refuse Adriana.\n \u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d she had asked.\n \u201cOf course. Always happy to help.\u201d\n \u201cI need to perform an operation.\u201d\n \u201cA friend? I\u2019ll arrange it ASAP.\u201d\n \u201cTonight.\u201d\n \u201cTonight? That\u2019s impossible. The hospital . . . it can\u2019t be scheduled. Even if I could find an operating theater, I\u2019d need an assistant.\u201d\n \u201cYou won\u2019t need an assistant.\u201d\n And now here they were. It was nuts.\n Rothman sat next to the patient, preparing for the operation. As usual, he opened a panoramic view of the operation in his mind. He would cut the skin around the organ in question, peel it back until the outer layer could be seen. This organ would be gleaming, milky white, marbled with veins. Rothman would carefully cut off a piece of corpus cavernosum. He would put it in a test tube prepared in advance. Adriana would take it away. Technically speaking, there was no difficulty.\n The difficulty was psychological.\n The operation was slow and successful. Rothman had already started stitching up the wound, although this was superfluous. The patient remained motionless throughout. The room was silent. There was no beeping monitor, no intravenous machine. No one monitored the patient\u2019s vital signs.\n No painkillers were given to the patient.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t need an assistant,\u201d Adriana had said, \u201cbecause the patient is already dead.\u201d\n \u201cVery funny.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s Tom.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n \u201cI know it\u2019s possible. His body has been kept cold. His sperm could still be alive. I need you to help me extract it.\u201d\n \u201cLook, I\u2019m a surgeon. I\u2019ve had many strange requests, but if you think I\u2019m giving a hand job to a dead man, you\u2019re certifiable.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m serious. If you help me with this, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d\n Rothman had taken his time considering this. \u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d he\u2019d finally said, \u201cbut I won\u2019t marry you. Not like this.\u201d\n He was a surgeon. He knew that excising Tom from Adriana\u2019s heart was an operation beyond his skill.\n \u201cI love you Pumpkin.\u201d\n \u201cI love you Honey Bunny.\u201d\n \u2014Excerpt from Future War\n 4A\n I\u2019ve finally decided to tell you. Forgive me for not knowing how to put it into direct words. It will be cleverly integrated into my fiction. If you read that, you\u2019ll have the answer you\u2019ve been seeking for so long.\n Spinal and shoulder fractures nearly killed me, but I survived. Survival: good luck amid misfortune, but also misfortune amid good luck.\n It was your father\u2019s fifth transfer. He was being sent overseas for his outstanding service. We had been planning to have a child. No, that wasn\u2019t you. You came later, after a few twists and turns. Your father and I decided to take a trip before he left, another motorcycle odyssey along the PCH. We seemed to be hurtling into the past. We were happy, excited. Life was beautiful. But on the way back, he lost control of the motorcycle.\n We went over a cliff. I survived, your father died.\n Some doctor friends told me that after death, a man\u2019s sperm may remain viable.\n After many setbacks, I finally found a doctor willing to perform sperm extraction on the deceased. I hired a hearse to transport your father\u2019s body to a hospital in San Diego. I didn\u2019t cry along the way. This wasn\u2019t a show of fortitude. I had already forgotten my grief.\n The operation was successful, and I had a glimmer of hope, like he wasn\u2019t gone forever. I could keep a part of him alive. Your father was an excellent partner, an outstanding Marine, and I believe he would have been an amazing father.\n Perhaps it is a power beyond biology (we sci-fi writers are superstitious, we believe in miracles). It\u2019s like I can see my fast-approaching death. I\u2019m not afraid. I made my peace with it long ago. I\u2019ve been prepared since I got those test results, way back when. I was ready then, and I\u2019m ready now. My most extravagant wish is to see you again before I die. But I can\u2019t just summon you here. I\u2019m not on my deathbed just yet, relying on a ventilator.\n I bet myself that you\u2019ll take the initiative to visit. Such thoughts support me these days. But I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll lose this bet. My luck has never been great.\n Summer has come. The sunlight grows diligent and bright, and I\u2019m withering away.\n I get up from bed and it\u2019s exercise, leaves me panting. Rothman is better. He\u2019s preparing to leave the nursing home in the next few days.\n \u201cOld man,\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not dead just yet.\u201d\n \u201cI mean I\u2019ll miss you after you go.\u201d\n \u201cI haven\u2019t left yet!\u201d\n \u201cSoon enough anyway.\u201d\n \u201cWant me to call your son for you? I mean, how long are you gonna wait before doing it yourself? You don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\n \u201cGee, thanks for the well-wishing.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s our generation through and through, all of us about to die of pride.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019ll come. He\u2019s my son. I believe in him.\u201d\n I get in the wheelchair that\u2019s been allocated to me for the last couple months. I roll myself out to the little garden-park. The Chinese Ash leaves grow luxuriantly. The decay of last winter gradually fades, giving way to a new, radiant aspect.\n Enviable, really.\n I\u2019m still not used to the wheelchair. The caregiver told me to break on down slopes to curtail my speed, but I can\u2019t recall where the break is. It seems her daily nagging isn\u2019t useless after all. I should\u2019ve paid more attention. Now I\u2019m embarrassed and vexed by a mild slope, mild enough to be insignificant to a normally-abled person\u2014a major obstacle in my life, like a medieval fortification.\n \u201cNeed my help?\u201d you say.\n 4B\n This is the last time I\u2019ll see you.\n I guide your wheelchair down the slope, toward a sea of flowers glowing with life.\n I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t visited lately. Determining that numerical range has been more complicated than we expected. We\u2019ve been unable to clarify what sort of changes may affect the already-established future, and which will be insignificant. For instance, my assistant Jane didn\u2019t buy the birthday gift her son asked for last year. We sent her back and she tried to rectify this. She returned to the present and sure enough the gift appeared, but not in her son\u2019s bedroom. It was in the basement. So, \u201cpost-history\u201d may overlay aspects of \u201coriginal history.\u201d Clearly this toy has been preserved in history, but it didn\u2019t have much impact on the future. Her son had a favorite toy for a while, then tired of it. The toy changed nothing else.\n I fervently hope I can leave you with something on this visit, but I don\u2019t know how to discern the possibilities. I\u2019ll just have to go with the flow, let things take their course.\n In fact, I\u2019m not doing much\u2014just keeping you company. It\u2019s quite low-key. From noon until evening, we reminisce: the first time I skipped class and the principal scolded me, you helping me write a love letter to my first crush, me as the guest of honor at one of your book launches.\n Strange that I never realized just how colorful our past really was.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you need to be getting back?\u201d you say.\n \u201cNo, I\u2019m good. This is nice.\u201d\n \u201cWonderful,\u201d you say, clasping my hand.\n This is the last time I\u2019ll see you.\n At two a.m. you will pass out. You\u2019ll be taken to the hospital and admitted to the ICU. The call notifying me will ring mercilessly the next morning. Daisy will answer. With a pained expression she\u2019ll tell me: \u201cIt\u2019s Anna.\u201d\n We\u2019ll reconcile temporarily, rush to the hospital. I\u2019ll run three red lights. When I pay the ticket the following month, I\u2019ll think of you and weep, bitterly and helplessly, in the middle of the clerk\u2019s office. People will think I\u2019m crying over a thousand-buck fine. I won\u2019t be able to explain my grief to a bunch of strangers. I\u2019ll just stand there crying, thinking of how Daisy and I stood in the hospital corridor.\n The doctor coming out and expressing his condolences.\n I can return to the eve of your death, but I can\u2019t change the fact of it.\n \u201cWill you read my books?\u201d\n \u201cI do miss being your number-one fan.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s like when you were growing up. You had to throw yourself into another woman\u2019s arms. But that\u2019s okay, Daisy\u2019s a good girl.\u201d\n This is as far as I can go with you.\n When it\u2019s time to say goodbye, you ask me to push you back inside. You take a book from your bedside table and hand it to me. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d\n It\u2019s your novel Future War. You sent me a copy when it first came out. I shelved it with your other works left unread. I don\u2019t tell you this, I just take the book.\n \u201cMom, I love you.\u201d I lean down and hug you, like when I was a kid, and you would lean down to hug me.\n \u201cI love you too,\u201d you say.\n \u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not just going through the motions here.\u201d\n I can\u2019t tell you everything that\u2019s about to happen. The principle is limiting. Any behavior that might reveal time travel will trigger disconnection.\n \u201cI know,\u201d you say, smiling.\n I watch you fall asleep. There will be no more ripples in the lake of your life.\n And now I\u2019m home.\n I haven\u2019t been here for a while. The cold war between Daisy and I is ongoing. She will not budge from her position, and neither will I.\n I find the book on the shelf. I wish this was the one from your bedside table, still wrapped in plastic like an unsealed thought, and not the one you mailed me back in the day, the one I ignored. I wipe the dust from the jacket.\n I peruse it and find a Chinese Ash leaf pressed between pages. I\u2019m stunned.\n Some things and feelings are so secret, but their vitality is preserved across time, permeating history.\n I sit down and start reading. I witness Tom\u2019s death and Adriana\u2019s subsequent choice. I\u2019m struck, as if experiencing the accident myself. I knew through certain channels that my father died in a motorcycle accident, but I didn\u2019t really know\u2014not until now.\n You never told me, worrying it would hurt me too much.\n Something nags at me.\n I get on my iPad and hastily search the keywords \u201cChina,\u201d \u201cHangzhou,\u201d \u201cforeigners,\u201d but of course come up wanting. I change \u201cforeigner\u201d to \u201cAmerican,\u201d then \u201cAmerican beauty.\u201d An apt description, after all, and a common headline ploy. Still nothing. Thinking of Daisy\u2019s sudden one-eighty, I add the keyword \u201cchild.\u201d\n The first link reads: \u201cTwo-year-old child falls into deepest part of West Lake, is rescued by American beauty.\u201d\n I click on the link:\n \u201cThe famous West Lake of Hangzhou was anything but tranquil yesterday afternoon. A brisk wind swept across the water, stirring up sizeable swells. According to data from the Hangzhou Meteorological Observatory, the temperature in Hangzhou was around 6\u00b0C from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . Two-year-old Xianxian (pseudonym) came to West Lake with her mother to play. There is a railing near the \u2018Three Pools Mirroring the Moon\u2019 pagodas. She was climbing the railing and fell into the lake. A West Lake Cruise tour guide says the \u2018Three Pools Mirroring the Moon\u2019 area is the deepest in West Lake, with an average depth of nearly five meters . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . the mother cried out for help . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . no one offered a helping hand . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . the situation was critical . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . a beautiful foreign woman jumped in the water . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . about five minutes later, the guard on duty also jumped in, and the two joined forces. They got the little girl out of the water. She was soaked through, her long hair dripping, her small lips purple with cold . . . \u201d\n \u201c . . . the foreign beauty gave the little girl first aid, attempting cardiac resuscitation and artificial respiration, but it was too late. A two-year-old flower withered while still budding. The foreign beauty is reportedly an American tourist and Chinese expert who studied Chinese history and culture. She cried during the interview, blaming herself for the child\u2019s death.\u201d\n I sit on the sofa, dumbfounded.\n It dawns on me what a bastard I really am. If someone who really loves you keeps a secret from you, it must be to spare you pain. How did I never understand this simple, self-evident truth? Why did it cost two human lives to make me see?\n It gets dark, but I don\u2019t turn on the lights. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been. A century? I hear the door open, her heels clicking on the floor. The light comes on. Daisy stands there looking exhausted, then shocked to see me.\n \u201cYou were just sitting here in the dark?\u201d\n I don\u2019t know what to say.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n I get up, walk over to her, hug her tight, and say, \u201cLet\u2019s have a baby!\u201d\n 0\n I think every author writes her own experiences and thoughts into her fiction, in some fashion. I\u2019m no different. I write science fiction, but some characters are based on people I know, especially in this novel.\n Science fiction as a genre of literature has always been event-oriented. In its development, and now more than ever, it relies on endless imagination to draw in readers, but in my new novel, I wanted to spark a particular discussion, a rather large kernel for the story: I wanted to explore the parent-child relationship. We\u2019ve ignored this issue for a long time. It\u2019s still a sci-fi novel, so I didn\u2019t want to frame things in a sort of mundane present. Precisely because it\u2019s sci-fi, I wanted to develop this issue more absolutely. That\u2019s how the story came about. When it was finished, the reader I wanted most was my son. It contains the answers he\u2019s been searching for, as well as some of my problems with him. I don\u2019t quite know how he would react, but I know for sure he won\u2019t read it. He\u2019s a dyed-in-the-wool scientist. He sneers at the conjectures in my novels. I consider this my biggest failure as a science fiction writer, and a mother.\n \u2014Excerpt from the preface to Future War\n 0A\n With a heavy expression, the doctor asked me: \u201cWhere is your family?\u201d\n \u201cI came by myself.\u201d\n \u201cWe usually tell family members the results, so they can decide if you should be informed. I\u2019m sorry, but the cancer has spread. But if you opt for chemotherapy\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIf I don\u2019t, how long do I have?\u201d\n \u201cAnywhere from half a month to two years, maybe longer. There have been such cases. One patient who decided to forgo treatment lived ten years.\u201d\n \u201cThanks for the comforting words, and the truth.\u201d\n It was the coldest news I heard that summer.\n I didn\u2019t want to cause trouble for anyone, so naturally I didn\u2019t tell you. I returned to the nursing home and lived as before, but the caregiver stumbled upon my news, somehow. I suppose she was bound to keep an eye on someone constantly fainting and having nosebleeds. She\u2019s a nice person. I don\u2019t know where she heard honey is effective against cancer, but she makes me drink a cup every night. By sheer luck, this cured the constipation that plagued me for years.\n I hate summer. I hate humid air, moldy food, and sticky skin after a sweat. I hate the accident that happened on a hot summer day\u2014but I don\u2019t hate memories. Some things fix him forever in the folds of time.\n 0B\n The experiment is a success.\n We will make history, but we cannot change it.\n What has passed will always bear its original aspect. I yearn to share this news with you, but you\u2019re no longer with me. You often said science fiction filled your writing with possibilities. You loved absolute, extreme perspectives that made hot hotter and cold colder. I want you to know you successfully influenced your son. You made me a scientist. When you were writing time travel novels, I was making time travel a reality. From now on, people will have to debate whether the subject of time travel can still be considered science fiction.\n The only thing that gives me a headache is Daisy. She must be upset about something, but like you, she won\u2019t tell me what happened. I can\u2019t have children. Absolutely not. People don\u2019t understand, but you should sympathize. Life is so precarious, a gauntlet of disease and accident. What if something happened to me and I missed my child\u2019s life, like my father missed mine? A unique sadness, that, a child\u2019s sadness: no one understands it better than me. People think my fear irrational, but if they experienced what I have, they\u2019d understand. Someone tells you something and it\u2019s just a story. Only through personal experience can you truly understand. There is no so-called empathy in this world\u2014not really.\n I know the subtle sorrow of wanting to care for a parent who has already passed. I know what I\u2019m talking about. When you were alive, I didn\u2019t feel this way. When you were gone, it was too late. Regret was pointless. Like I said, it\u2019s one thing to speak reasonably, quite another to practice what you preach.\n But I\u2019m lucky. Providence has given me the opportunity to make amends.\n \u201cHave you decided where to go?\u201d Jane asks me.\n I give the answer that was clear to me long before now: \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to visit my mother.\u201d\n Author\u2019s Note:\n Writing this story, I emulated the structure of Ted Chiang\u2019s \u201cDivision by Zero.\u201d Anna and her husband\u2019s storyline (including his identity, experience, and surgical details) was inspired by the article \u201cGiving Birth After Death,\u201d published on August 26, 2016 by the Science Squirrel Society website.\n Originally published in Chinese in Tadpole Stave, June 16, 2020.\n Translated and published in partnership with Storycom.\n Wang Yuan has had nearly two million Chinese characters worth of fiction published, on platforms like Clarkesworld, Science Fiction World, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, Tadpole Stave, and elsewhere. He popularizes science in works such as Worlds Hidden in Science Fiction: The Book of N-Dimensional Space. His short stories are collected in the volume Painter of Stars.\n Andy Dudak is a writer and translator of science fiction. His original stories have appeared in Analog, Apex, Clarkesworld, Daily Science Fiction, Interzone, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Rich Horton\u2019s Year\u2019s Best, and elsewhere. He\u2019s translated many stories for Clarkesworld, and a novel by Liu Cixin, among other things. In his spare time he likes to binge-watch peak television and eat Hui Muslim style cold sesame noodles."}

It feels enormous, on the outside. Inside, it\u2019s cramped, a human anthill. It didn\u2019t used to be, but Julia doesn\u2019t remember what it felt like when there was room enough for everyone.\nIn the locker room, Rafael\u2019s elbow scissors into her personal space as Julia zips her coveralls. Her helmet and face shield are grimy, the padding smells of a mixture of her sweat and the false sweetness of institutional cleaner. The breather elastic is way too loose. She\u2019s already tied knots on each side.\nRafael stays too close, his chin tucked down. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about cuts. Big ones.\u201d\nJulia straightens. He ducks to tighten his overshoes, showing her with his posture that this is meant to be a secret.\nIt\u2019s not like Rafael to gossip. He\u2019s a good worker. A hard worker. Julia pretends to adjust her pant cuffs. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to cut.\u201d She requisitioned new gloves two years ago and is still waiting for them. Her right pointer finger slides out through taped-over repairs and the skin is permanently red.\n\u201cAngel, in the office? He says they\u2019re cutting the salary budget in half.\u201d Rafael\u2019s voice gets quieter until \u201chalf\u201d is only mouthed.\nPedro presses his face between them. \u201cPassing notes? I\u2019ll be at the top before you\u2019re done.\u201d\nRafael turns to taunt Pedro, and that\u2019s the end of the strange conversation. People are filing out of the room. The day has begun.\nThe catwalk rattles with feet as Julia jogs. The calls of \u201cready\u201d start coming in on her radio before Julia has gotten to her section and clipped her belt to the safety line. It\u2019s a brave job, and they treat it as such. Every sunset they race to the top, for the privilege of turning the knob that starts the water flow and alerts the system washing is taking place. Julia has never been first, but she has been second.\nShe has never truly given her all. She has felt like she has, but there\u2019s a difference, between feeling it and doing it. She could, if she dug deep, run up the wall like her life depended on it. She could be first.\nThe sixteenth \u201cready\u201d comes, and she leaps the first step, skittering mad and hard past the vertical. The city dome curves comfortingly under her gripping soles, and she sees the sun sinking in the west, painting oil slicks on the glass, the marks that never wash out, the bleeding minerals of the grilles.\nThis is her favorite part of the job, the beauty and solitude, the clouds rolling underneath the city, the sun melting into the soft horizon like a pat of butter in potatoes.\nHer mother climbed cliffs on Earth with Julia\u2019s abuela. Her stories are peppered with references to anchor points and cracks and other things Julia doesn\u2019t know how to fit into her own experience of climbing. Once upon a time, her mother was here, lifting the beams supporting her into place. That is easier to imagine. The dome a fragile, empty thing, alone in the feral clouds of Venus, no city inside yet.\nJulia can feel herself slowing near the top, arms and thighs getting lazy, pulling at her to slow down. She forces a second wind. The hard part is almost done.\nRafael is at the top already. She gives up, checks the hose and nozzle at her hip, turns the squeegee so it\u2019s at the angle she likes to grab it. She gets through the last few feet. The rest of the crew is coming into view. Rafael gets to turn the knob. Again. He does it like a stage magician revealing a dove.\nThe top of the dome is a sixteen-pointed star of time-painted titanium, and they, alone, get to enjoy it up close, to be out here with room to stretch. So they do, as they prepare to descend.\nPedro huffs. \u201cI\u2019m tired already.\u201d\nHe\u2019s just mad not to have made it to the top first. \u201cIf you want to quit, I\u2019ll take your pay.\u201d Julia tries not to sound out of breath. Pedro flips her off. No one\u2019s going to quit and lose their housing allotment.\nShe plays out a few feet of hose and hops back lightly. She hears Rafael teasing Pedro as she sprays a thin stream of soapy water along the rails that separate her section from the others. She\u2019s proud of her skill at this. She has the best water conservation scores.\nShe imagines the wash soothes the tired city. Acids eat every weak spot and lingers in unexpected salts. Without their careful maintenance, the dome could leak, and leaking meant sinking into the hellish pressure below. The air they breathe is also the lifting gas that holds the city aloft in Venus\u2019 denser atmosphere. Their parents\u2019 generation built a city to float in the clouds. Her generation keeps it flying.\nShe spots a nick and easily switches hands, holstering her water sprayer and pulling out the repair gel. Squirt, squeegee, and the white silica gel rapidly sinks into transparency as she switches hands again.\nHop back, spray, swipe clean. She gets into the rhythm, working left to right, then right to left as her section widens. She and Rafael meet at their boundary, and he looks over at her. \u201cHave you thought about it? About what you\u2019ll do?\u201d\nJulia scowls. There\u2019s no time in her rhythm to respond, and she feels put upon that he throws troubles into her mind as she plays her rope out and drops out, down, left to start the next pass. There\u2019s Rafael coming toward her again. She has three hops and as many seconds to form a response. \u201cSo?\u201d is all she comes up with.\n\u201cWe need to stand together,\u201d he says. \u201cAll or none.\u201d And he\u2019s gone.\nHe thinks they\u2019ll be laid off? The city needs them. They never got a robot washer to work. Even if they did, there\u2019s no room in the city to store a washing robot, and to leave it out in the atmosphere is to ask for it to be slowly destroyed.\nBut he\u2019s serious.\nWhat if they cut the staff? No. That would be too cruel with the housing rules. But they might. Would they move to washing every other sunset? Or will they each wash two sections? Her thighs burn as she hops. Her mother will hate that. Too much time in menial work, no time to improve herself.\n\u201cWhy did you settle for this job where they can ask you to do this?\u201d her mother will say.\nThe next time their paths touch, Julia and Rafael meet without words. It takes six hours to wash the dome now. Could she do this for twelve hours straight?\nHer mother tells a story about climbing a limestone spire in El Potrero Chico, something like six hundred meters, with no guide rope. She never says how long it took, but that she lagged behind Abuela by hours.\nAbuela exists in her mother\u2019s stories like a cartoon character or saint Julia doesn\u2019t quite believe in. Is this mythic grandmother meant to reflect on their relationship? Is there a moral behind the story she is expected to decipher? Did daughters always end up not quite as strong as their mothers?\nJulia\u2019s left knee twinges when she plants to begin her next pass. An old injury, telling the tale of years on the job. Her mother wanted her to work with her brain. \u201cI busted my ass so you don\u2019t have to bust yours.\u201d But it isn\u2019t any easier, busting her brain. The hardest problem in school isn\u2019t a differential equation or history fact, it\u2019s finding a job you\u2019ll love to do that wants you.\nRafael is hidden by the curve of the dome most of the time now. These longer passes are grueling. Her shoulders strain without the break of dropping to the next level. It\u2019s lonelier. The race and thrill are over. But this is her work, and she is good at it, and she wants to keep doing it.\nShe side-hops over an apartment block. It\u2019s fascinating how people take the same room and make it their own. A toddler looks out at her, mouth open, pounding a doll\u2019s head with a plastic cube.\nWhen she reaches Rafael again, she says, \u201cAll or none. Of course.\u201d\nHe gives her a sad look. \u201cYou promise? If they lay off, we all walk?\u201d\nShe nods curtly. It\u2019s a drop and another long pass. The apartment below has curtains drawn. A waxy white fabric, edges of burgundy that must be the color on the inside. A spiderwort pokes its tendrils under and around. Her mother is a terrible gardener but keeps trying. They have a duty to grow green things. Every apartment a vegetable garden.\nShe only thinks of her mother in motion. Repotting, watering, tearing up failures. Or pointing up at some girder or crossbeam to lecture about bracing and counterbalancing. \u201cPhysics. That\u2019s everything, mija. Study your physics and be a scientist and support me in my old age, eh?\u201d\nWould her mother understand if she walked off the job? Julia doesn\u2019t know, but she feels strong, excited at the idea of doing something radical.\nAt the bottom of the window, Julia sets her feet on the lip of the city and walks across. Her section is a fifteen-minute walk at the bottom, when it was a single bound side-to-side at top. Her last pass is done crouching and is the slowest pass of all. A trough under the catwalk catches the soapy water, funnels it down to be filtered and processed. She\u2019ll follow the pipes down, under the floor of the city. There, the rest of the work shift will be cleaning and stowing the equipment. She tugs her hose to start it retracting.\nThe weariness in her thighs and shoulders feels like a job well done. She walks clockwise back to the airlock. Rafael\u2019s steps echo behind her. She wants to look back, now that they are coconspirators, but doesn\u2019t. She wants the dreary part of the night done, the indoor\u2019s grime and machines. She\u2019ll get a beer before heading home. It\u2019s a gorgeous evening, no higher clouds. The central square will be flooded with starlight as second Sun Day ends and first Dark Day begins, the city speeding far above the lagging ground in the atmospheric current. Forever the same.\nIt\u2019s possible Rafael is wrong. Maybe nothing will happen.\nAngel, the office manager, is waiting in the locker room. That\u2019s not normal. He fidgets like he has to go to the bathroom while they take off their outdoor suits and hang their face shields. Rafael gives her a look that says, \u201cI told you so.\u201d\nJulia wishes she\u2019d worn a better shirt today. This one has a stain on the sleeve where she set her elbow in spilled coffee. The face shields get rinsed in the sink and hung to dry. The suits go into a laundry hamper. The shoes rest in a tray full of acid-neutralizing chalk. She changes her socks. Many of the others don\u2019t, but she can\u2019t imagine going through the rest of her day in damp socks. Everyone is finished. Julia sucks the acid burn on the side of her pointer finger. One of the women starts brushing her hair. They should be going into the machine room now, but Angel is in the way.\nHe clears his throat. \u201cThe boss gave me the job of telling you guys. They\u2019re letting most of you go. We\u2019re keeping Rodriguez, Hammerstein, Corredor, and Lopez. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nJulia is Lopez. She feels a relief that squashes into instant horror and guilt. No one is talking, no one is moving. Rafael (Rodriguez) steps forward, shoulders wide. Is this it? Is he going to do something? Julia fears confrontations. She wants to hide. But she\u2019ll stand with him. She said she would.\nRafael asks, \u201cHow are four people expected to clean the whole dome?\u201d\nAngel\u2019s response sounds prepared. \u201cYou\u2019ll work four shifts, do it in sections. If we really stay on top of it, admin thinks it\u2019ll be enough. They\u2019re downsizing the office staff, too. Hector and Alverez from maintenance are going to do all the interior work. All you have to worry about are the windows.\u201d\n\u201cFucking thanks.\u201d Marta Hammerstein throws a towel into her locker.\nPedro looks at Julia with hate in his eyes, and she realizes she isn\u2019t going to get a beer tonight, after all.\nRafael doesn\u2019t do anything. His face is trembling like he might cry or shout, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.\nWhat\u2019s worse, neither does Julia.\nAngel twists, half a shrug, half an aborted apology, and leaves.\nFour shifts. Her mother will hardly see her. The argument between them is fully in her mind, as though it has already happened. She chose to be a dumb beast, not a knowledge worker. She can\u2019t afford to stand up for herself, when her mother . . . her mother built the city.\nNormally, she would work a twelve-hour shift, with the interior work after the washing. They worked long on First Dark Day, got Second Dark Day off, and did an inspection pass on First Sun Day, making small repairs, and got Second Sun Day off. It was a good schedule, a familiar rhythm. The document Angel sent to her drew out a complicated schedule that creeped forward and wrapped around the week, rather than working with it. Did they no longer care about the increased evaporation during Sun Days?\nJulia walks half-blind, reading the schedule, dragging it over her old schedule, trying to make sense of it. No matter how slow she walks, she\u2019ll be home early. Behind her, Pedro is inconsolable, moaning and crying while another worker, RiRi, who has a strident voice, attempts to soothe him by pouring gasoline on his flame. \u201cYou know it\u2019s the corps. They\u2019re paying cash on the head for anyone we deport. You know why, don\u2019t you? Because their own workers are dying like flies. Like flies!\u201d\nShe\u2019s almost home.\nJulia lives in a frame stack building, aluminum beams white with age holding corrugated plastic in faded fruit juice colors. It sits wedged between newer buildings built on what had been streets, walkways relegated to tunnels underneath them, and even those are lined with sleeping bags. Their proud city resembles nothing so much as a warren of stacked plastic crates and abandoned campsites.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d Pedro moans. \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna . . . there\u2019s time, right? They gotta give people time.\u201d\n\u201cTime is an illusion.\u201d RiRi\u2019s getting louder. \u201cThey make you think you have time, but who\u2019s hiring, eh? Who\u2019s hiring?!\u201d\nA figure wrapped in a blanket rolls over, tightens the fabric around its head, and Julia flushes with embarrassment. How ungrateful they must sound, clean and well-fed, on their way to homes.\nThis isn\u2019t the utopia the Mexican government imagined, but they didn\u2019t know there would be refugees from the corporate factory-aerostats. Couldn\u2019t have dreamed such places would exist, so awful their workers were willing to risk the crushing depths to hop on a homemade glider or balloon and make it to the free air of New Tenochtitlan.\nA door bangs open, a man shouts, private tragedy spilling into the street like food waste. Julia assumes it has nothing to do with her and studiously avoids looking until the man in the too-loose shirt is charging her way, and past her, and slapping Pedro.\n\u201cPops! Ow!\u201d\n\u201cYou lost your job? You LOST YOUR JOB?\u201d\nJulia lowers her head and hurries, pretending that she doesn\u2019t hear every word.\n\u201cWhat are we supposed to do? Eh? What is your mother going to do when you get stolen away?!\u201d\nShe pretends she isn\u2019t relieved by the contrast to her imagined argument with her mother. She hasn\u2019t lost her job. She will, at first, simply not mention the layoffs.\nJulia\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment is small, smaller than the ones under Julia\u2019s section of dome. What had been \u201cher\u201d section. She supposes she\u2019ll now do a full quarter of the city. She\u2019s exhausted thinking about it. Like her first week on the job, when every night her body was spent and every morning her muscles felt like poorly set concrete.\nHer mother bursts into the room the second she arrives, a tiny tornado with a gray buzz cut. \u201cAre you okay? Did anyone get violent?\u201d\nJulia lets her mother drag her to the sofa and fuss over her. \u201cYou found out?\u201d\n\u201cEduardo. His daughter works in administration, and her wife is the facility manager\u2019s cousin. She says it\u2019s coming from the top. RyelCorp offered to pay for deportations in one big swoop, so the city wants all the unemployed people they can get at once.\u201d\n\u201cMa, that\u2019s a conspiracy theory.\u201d\nShe shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m a lazy retired lady now, we do nothing but gossip.\u201d\nAround the room, her mother\u2019s plants, quilts, and exercise equipment tell a different story. When will the concern fade and the recriminations start? \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see how it works next sundown. The revised schedule.\u201d\nHer mother freezes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t quit?\u201d\nShe feels she has failed an important test. She also feels the threat of deportation to RyelCorp\u2019s factory bubbles. \u201cWhatever the city needs, right?\u201d\nHer mother shifts on the sofa to face her directly, hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou listen to me, mija. Yes, those are words I\u2019ve said, and I mean them most of the time, but not now.\u201d Julia\u2019s heart swells with love. \u201cA city without people is only a ruin.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s it, exactly. But then her mother gives her a little shake and breaks her heart. \u201cThis is your chance. To leave that drudgery behind and get a real job.\u201d\nJulia is on her feet so fast her mother\u2019s hands fly up as if in surrender. There\u2019s only the one bedroom. Julia sleeps on the sofa. She goes to the bathroom. At least it has a door.\nThe flimsy printed door doesn\u2019t muffle her mother\u2019s voice. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said \u2018real.\u2019 I meant \u2018better.\u2019 When God closes a door, he opens a window.\u201d\nJulia sits on the toilet and wishes there was a window she could escape through.\nThere are only four window washers now, and the city will not survive without their labor. It should be easy to band together, to refuse.\nThey have a group chat.\nMarta: I\u2019m pissed, too, but I can\u2019t afford to lose this job.\nCorredor: TO ANY EXECUTIVE READING - I AM NOT A PART OF THIS DISCUSSION\nMarta: Luis has a point. We\u2019ll get fired if they see this thread.\nRafael: But if we band together, they\u2019d have to fire all of us.\nMarta: You think they fucking won\u2019t?\nThat killed the thread. There was nothing after it but Rafael repeating some variation of the same thought:\nRafael: Come on, guys. I can\u2019t do anything on my own.\nIt\u2019s hot in the square, already halfway into the forty-eight-hour day. First Sun Day evening, or noon, as the sky tells it. The sun winks through the windowpanes, the heavy plants perspire. It smells both human and jungle. Here, the packing crate apartment buildings are a backdrop behind monuments and trees. The administration offices are built like a stepped pyramid, with lush foliage on every step.\nJulia\u2019s mother is dragging her forward with a sweaty hand clamped manacle-tight on her wrist. Like she\u2019s a child again.\nJulia looks yearningly toward the Cloud Bar\u2019s blue curlicue entrance. \u201cMa, this isn\u2019t going to do anything. You aren\u2019t important anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI should wash your mouth. I built this city. Now you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s not what you know all the time, sometimes it\u2019s who you know.\u201d She marches up to the reception desk at City Hall and knocks on it. \u201cHello, young man. We need to talk to Valeria, right away. Tell her it\u2019s Hortensia Lopez.\u201d\nThe man at the reception desk looks past them like they aren\u2019t there. Julia should have put on better clothes. She should have insisted her mother change. Their coveralls are like camouflage. They may as well be potted plants.\nHortensia continues speaking anyway. \u201cThe city is making a dangerous mistake. I won\u2019t have our maintenance workers mistreated this way. They keep us safe. When I\u2014\u201d\nA woman in light, flowing shorts favored by the fashionable walks in, and the receptionist\u2019s attention immediately centers on her. Julia watches her mother\u2019s frown deepen as the man leans around her like she\u2019s an inconvenient post.\nHortensia says, \u201cDid your mother not teach you respect? I\u2019m here to see the mayor. It\u2019s Hortensia Lopez. She\u2019ll know me.\u201d\nThe receptionist draws back. \u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d he asks, clearly assuming not. Assuming correctly, which is worse. \u201cI can\u2019t even call her if you don\u2019t have an appointment. Try the public comments box.\u201d\nJulia tries to get her mother to leave, but Hortensia has seen someone she knows and is marching across the foyer. \u201cDarrin! Darrin Ruiz do not turn away from me, you know who I am!\u201d\nHer mother chases this man to a side entrance, where he turns at last and stares coldly. \u201cDo you have a reason to be here?\u201d\n\u201cYes! My daughter, Julia, she has\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here. Please leave.\u201d He walks away.\nHortensia blinks like she can\u2019t see. Julia wraps her arms around her bicep and urges her toward the exit.\n\u201cI held him at his first birthday party,\u201d Hortensia says.\nAs the sun sets, Julia prepares for work. She\u2019s gotten notice of the length of her shift, sixteen hours. Enough time to do three sections with three twenty-minute breaks between. Sixteen hours of washing. She packs muscle balm and an extra bottle of electrolyte-bearing water.\nHer mother cracks the bedroom door, disarranged for sleep. \u201cMija what are you doing up so late?\u201d\n\u201cI have to get to work. Double shift.\u201d She feels like a shady politician, prettying up the truth.\nHortensia\u2019s face falls in disappointment.\nJulia keeps her eyes on packing her lunch box.\nHer mother tries to grab her hand. She tries to evade her, but then Hortensia takes both hands, hers moist and warm from bed, like bread loaves ready to bake. \u201cDon\u2019t go. They\u2019ll give you two weeks, it\u2019s plenty of time.\u201d\nJulia doesn\u2019t want to go to work. She wants to be strong enough to say no. She wants to not feel this weight of expectation, the thousands of mornings of going to school, of going to practice, of going to work.\nShe flees the weight, and her mother\u2019s big, heavy hands. She goes to work.\nAngel is in the locker room. It doesn\u2019t feel too small this morning. Marta is shaking her shoes out over the lime dust. Rafael doesn\u2019t look up from sealing his coveralls. Luis dresses like he\u2019s alone in the room.\nAngel watches the four of them like they might bolt at any moment. \u201cYou made the right decision,\u201d he says to her.\nJulia wonders when she made the decision. She goes to her locker. Someone has put gloves on top of hers, some other worker\u2019s less-worn pair. Pedro\u2019s? It feels wrong to be so close to Rafael when now there are many empty lockers. She starts to move her spare socks to the next locker over, and stops, seeing the name still there.\nShe turns to Rafael, waits for him to look at her. He doesn\u2019t. \u201cAre we really doing this?\u201d she asks him.\n\u201cAren\u2019t we?\u201d He sounds defeated.\nShe doesn\u2019t want to be on the side of defeat. She doesn\u2019t want to be on the side of Angel\u2019s untrusting smile. She feels, suddenly, disgusted at all of them.\nShe picks up her spare socks and snatches the photo of her ex-boyfriend and the picture from the New Year\u2019s Party. That\u2019s all that\u2019s hers in the locker. She turns and walks out.\nThe shaking starts before she passes Angel. Her anger cools to fear. Will they let her keep walking? She could be going to get something she forgot. Now she\u2019s at the exit. Now she\u2019s in the corridor. She realizes she\u2019s crumpled her photos.\n\u201cLopez!\u201d Angel reaches for her arm. She whirls on him, and he backs off, both hands in the air. Did she do that? With a look? \u201cWe picked you because you were the four best. Doesn\u2019t that mean anything? We picked you.\u201d\nNo one else has followed her out of the locker room. Not Rafael, not Marta. She feels defeat like a thing just under her stomach, waiting to rise. But Angel called her by her last name. The name that saved the city.\nHe says, \u201cThey\u2019ll just hire back one of the others, someone worse. The city will suffer.\u201d\nJulia raises her chin. \u201cThat\u2019s their mistake to make.\u201d\nShe hates that she is doing what her mother wanted. When she gets home, her mother rises from the kitchen table, beaming joyful relief. Julia wants to scream, or argue, or explain, but instead she shakes and cries in her mother\u2019s arms. Hortensia rubs circles into her back. \u201cNo. It\u2019s good. You couldn\u2019t know your strength until it was tested.\u201d\nJulia spends First Dark Day checking messages. The company gives her a second chance, twenty-four hours to return. She can use a sick day. They don\u2019t say who worked her shift, or if the dome went one-quarter unwashed.\nRafael wants to know if she hates him.\nShe doesn\u2019t, but she hates him asking.\nAt least he has finally done one thing: he has added all the laid off workers to the group chat.\nRafael: They\u2019re going to ask one of you to take Julia\u2019s place. Don\u2019t do it. Not unless they agree to hire more back.\nPedro: You\u2019re still working, right? Did you demand they hire us back?\nRafael doesn\u2019t answer. Julia wonders if she has been silent too long. She had something she could have said, once.\nHortensia cooks her best, most comforting dish, the cheese potato mash, and they finish off the red wine. It\u2019s almost a party, except for her mother going over the budget and writing out timelines they can live on. \u201cThere, you see? The charges for not having an employment voucher aren\u2019t so much. There is air, and water, and sewage. We can cover you two months.\u201d\n\u201cThey deport after two weeks.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not really true. And I bet it doesn\u2019t take so long, now you\u2019re really looking. If you must, you\u2019ll find something temporary before two weeks are up.\u201d\nJulia hasn\u2019t found any open positions she can apply to. She hadn\u2019t found anything in all the years she tried to meet her mother\u2019s expectations, and those years felt full of opportunity, the city uncrowded.\nHer mother isn\u2019t worried, with her pension guaranteeing her residence until death. Julia tries not to resent that.\nWhen Hortensia catches Julia going over the figures, she closes the screen. \u201cBut that\u2019s tomorrow and tomorrow, darling. Don\u2019t worry. I am the mother. I will tell you when to worry.\u201d\nSleeping in doesn\u2019t feel as good the second time. It\u2019s Sun Day and the light is strong, seeping through the cracks in the walls. Julia dresses in her best clothes and goes for a walk.\nHer feet take her to work. They don\u2019t know any other walk.\nShe slows as the \u201cemployees only\u201d sign comes into sight. She wonders who replaced her. How it felt, washing four sections instead of one. If the city will survive, or if the tired metal is even now being irrevocably eaten away.\nA policeman stands at the door. Julia is several feet back, so she\u2019s surprised when he approaches. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\u201cI was just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLeave or you\u2019ll be arrested.\u201d\nJulia stares at him. \u201cArrested for what? This is a public corridor.\u201d\nWhich is how she gets arrested.\nThe jail is crowded. Each cell, designed to hold one person, holds five. One of the persons in her cell has peed on himself. The others huddle away from him, near the front. Their sweat and breath mingle in a moist fug.\nShe wishes she had her com so she could check the news. She wishes she\u2019d done something more meaningful to get arrested than stand there.\nThe door to the corridor opens and a few people start shouting. When\u2019s my court date? Where\u2019s dinner? But the guard ignores them, leading her mother, who looks like she is claiming a prize at the end of this stinking corridor.\nJulia is genuinely stunned her mother is getting her out. As she leaves the cell, she whispers, \u201cWas it the mayor? Did you\u2014?\u201d\nHer mother pins her a furious glance for one heartbeat.\nShe doesn\u2019t explain the bail until they are in their own apartment. Their savings, halved. The resources to find a new job shortened. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine. A mother provides. You\u2019ll find something.\u201d\nThey orbit each other in the cramped apartment like two positively charged magnets. They have three months of rent. Two months, if they want to eat.\nJulia receives two messages. One from the city, stating that she has two weeks to find employment, or prove she is in a training program for employment, or she will be deported. She doesn\u2019t forward it to her mother, doesn\u2019t say \u201cI told you so.\u201d The other message is from Angel, asking her to please come back, they will look the other way, just this once.\nThe group chat hasn\u2019t gotten any better.\nMarta: They hired some untrained cloud-hopper. I blame you, Lopez! I\u2019d take any of you fuckers over him. Smith\u2019s section may as well not get done. Found two cavities today, and it\u2019s only going to get worse.\nJulia closes the feed. \u201cI have an interview,\u201d she says, and keeps her head turned away from the way her mother brightens. She shouldn\u2019t have said it. She doesn\u2019t need an excuse to go outside.\nThe woman who has been sleeping on the edge of the walkway all week is gone, with her blanket and her bag of belongings. Julia wonders about tragedies that touch her life and don\u2019t. She\u2019ll never know where the woman came from, where she went.\nHead down, she walks to the bar. It\u2019s been a long time since the after-work beer she never got, and she wants it. Deserves it.\nCloud Bar is beautiful. The floor is glass, and the ceiling, too, though nearby buildings block most of that view. The ceiling supports are covered in cotton fluff and sheer curtains to make it feel like you are in the sky. She has always loved this place. The prices are cheap before happy hour. She gets her favorite beer and finds a seat near the wall. Through the floor she can see the under-city and the RyelCorp High Pressure Lab, dangling like a rudder into the clouds. It was supposed to bring great, wonderful things to the city. It brought chemical engineers who got all the best housing, didn\u2019t pay taxes, and probably voted for the citizenship-by-employment mandate.\nShe imagines she can kick it off the city with her foot.\nIf she can\u2019t find another job in two weeks, she\u2019ll have to take Angel\u2019s offer. It feels like giving too much up, like admitting the administration can do this.\nShe sees Rafael arrive. Sees him see her and freeze. He looks to the exit. He sags. He comes to her, standing awkwardly like a new waiter. \u201cI saw you got arrested.\u201d\n\u201cFor walking on the sidewalk.\u201d She means it as half a joke; it comes out hard. Rafael looks like she kicked him in the gut. She shakes her head, loosening her hair and her tone. \u201cThe funny thing is, I wasn\u2019t even trying to picket or anything. I\u2019d just come back to look at the place.\u201d\n\u201cAssholes!\u201d He hovers. \u201cCan I? I mean . . . \u201d\n\u201cSit. Don\u2019t explain or excuse, though. None of that.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t understand how much she means it because as he settles into the seat next to her, he explains himself. \u201cI got scared. More scared than I thought I could get. I was ready to do it. Walk right out of there. I pictured every step, but then this thought popped into my head: what about my son? What about all the things he needs? You\u2019re single. You don\u2019t know what the burden feels like.\u201d\nJulia considers dumping her beer on his head, but she doesn\u2019t think she can afford another. \u201cWhat about when your son gets a job? What about when he\u2019s asked to work sixteen hours in the acid rain?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was right. I said I was scared.\u201d He waves for the bartender, who ignores him. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m not going back.\u201d He pauses. She doesn\u2019t give him the reaction he\u2019s clearly pressing for. He slumps. \u201cIt was killing me, my hands, my legs. And yesterday, Marta slipped. Not a little slip, I mean she was hanging from her safety line, unable to get her feet under her until me and Jos\u00e9 got to her. And my legs were shaking so I almost couldn\u2019t help. It terrified me. What if we all had slipped? No paycheck is worth dying for.\u201d He holds up two fingers and exchanges nods with a waiter. He looks back at Julia. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? You think I\u2019m too strong to collapse? Girl, I only ever beat you by a step, you realize that?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I believe you.\u201d She avoids looking at him. \u201cAbout being tired.\u201d Had she gotten the offer to return only because Rafael quit? \u201cYou\u2019re one of the good ones,\u201d the message said, \u201cYou care about the city.\u201d It implies there are \u201cbad ones.\u201d\nRafael fidgets. \u201cI mean it about not going back. I threw all my gear in a bundle off the platform! I made sure I couldn\u2019t chicken out again. Ah, bless it.\u201d This he says to the beer approaching their table. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my last foolish act. They\u2019ve outlawed striking. I only got out by saying I wasn\u2019t doing that, I was quitting. So that\u2019s it.\u201d He looks into his beer as though seeing the end of something. \u201cI checked with RyelCorp, they aren\u2019t hiring. I thought maybe your mother has some connections with the building crews? I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d\nJulia imagines the sunrise on top of the dome, who will see it. She drains her beer. It hits her hard. Not enough to eat, lately. She doesn\u2019t want to feel guilty. She stares past Rafael, at the community news report. The high school baseball finals. Kids smiling against the projected green field, swinging real bats at holographic balls and running on treadmills. It\u2019s hard to see it the way the kids will.\n\u201cThey got Pedro,\u201d Rafael says and cringes like he wants to take it back. He lowers his voice. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s gone. There was a shipment to the corp domes yesterday. His folks aren\u2019t talking.\u201d\nThe news report flashes red. Emergency. \u201cLow Pressure Detected in Section 4.\u201d The steady buzz of talk and motion around the room freezes into one tense silence, all eyes fixed to the man who appears on the screen. \u201cThere is no cause for panic. A leak has been detected, but balloons are being deployed. Citizens are recommended to seal their rooms if they can be sealed. This is only a precaution.\u201d\nSome people leave. Some go back to their drinks. The general buzz of conversation shifts, becomes serious. Julia wants to spit acid, call out the greed that so predictably led here. What would she say, though, who would listen?\nThe news shifts to a shot of the cleaning crew\u2014her cleaning crew, leaving work. It must have been shot weeks ago. \u201cThe blame for the dome leak is being laid on workers who walked off the job in a bid for shorter working hours.\u201d\nJulia feels a pulse of anger so visceral it\u2019s like a fireball expanding from her chest. Someone shoots her a dirty look. A familiar face. A regular. Does he recognize her from that split second of video?\nJulia stands up. \u201cYou want something to do? Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nRafael\u2019s face is slack with shock, but he obligingly stands. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cTo get arrested.\u201d\nThere are three police officers at the turn for the maintenance employee entrance. As Julia and Rafael approach, they straighten from lounging against walls, set their feet wide. A violent intention thrums through their posture.\n\u201cThis is where we walk on the sidewalk?\u201d Rafael whispers, his voice wavering.\nJulia strides forward. \u201cWe\u2019re here to fix the leak.\u201d It comes out more confident than she thought she could sound. A clarion call, a command. One of the cops steps back.\nOnly one.\nShe turns to Rafael. \u201cCome on.\u201d He nods, solemn.\nThey make it even with the police, not half a step further, and hard hands are on her biceps. She and Rafael are pushed back. One officer, a woman, says, \u201cGet out of here. Try that again, and we\u2019ll have to take you in.\u201d\nJulia almost laughs. \u201cWhy not take me in now?\u201d\nThe cops look at each other. Julia has a guess. That jail was pretty full before. Has someone said not to bring more people in? She hooks Rafael\u2019s arm and leads him away.\nJulia makes her first post to the group chat.\nJulia: Who\u2019s up for storming the locker room?\nRafael: Julia wants to break in, help fix the dome. It\u2019ll show the city we\u2019re the right side. There are only three guards, and they\u2019re not very threatening. Just kinda scowled at us.\nNo one posts \u201cyes,\u201d though there are a number of icon responses. Eyeballs. A fist. Rafael posts a date and time. Julia has no idea what to expect when it arrives.\nOn the corner with the noodle place, they meet RiRi and Rafael\u2019s former roommate and a friend of a friend who used to date Pedro. The roommate had worked on windows once, in high school, but the ex is just there for moral support and muscle. Julia feels like she has misjudged each of these people by not recognizing their compassion before now. She wants to cry, and to hug them. Instead, she just nods.\nThey form two rows, two and three, and they march right past the guards. The police grab her, again, but Julia punches her fist into the air, pushing the hold up her arm. She presses forward, through hands and a tripping leg, and the door is in front of her.\nSomeone grabs her hair, then, and yanks her off her feet.\nIt\u2019s a mess. A tangle of limbs and shouting. It feels more like children wrestling than something adult. There\u2019s a sharp smell of ozone, and Rafael cries out.\nIt ends quickly after the taser.\nJulia gets a fat lip and zip ties on her wrists. The five of them are sat down in a row, Rafael shaking his head and blinking like he can dispel the memory of electricity.\nOne cop paces back and forth in front of them, his fists tightening and releasing as if he doesn\u2019t know what to do with the energy. The other two confer, anxious whispers that get loud enough to hear. \u201cSo call.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to\u2014\u201d \u201cLook.\u201d\nTwo more police officers arrive. One has the golden eagle of a commander. She stops three feet away and holds up a hand. \u201cI am very disappointed in you,\u201d she says to Julia and her companions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a dangerous situation and the city needs you to be calm, to not make matters worse.\u201d\nRiRi snaps, \u201cWe were trying to\u2014\u201d and is kicked by the officer who had been pacing.\n\u201cNow,\u201d the commander says, a gentle admonishment, as if this were a child drawing on the walls. \u201cNone of that. We need to be civilized.\u201d She hooks her thumbs on her belt. \u201cThe jail\u2019s a bit crowded at present, so I\u2019m going to let you off with probation. Don\u2019t mistake this for nothing. You\u2019re out of warnings. If you so much as spit on a walkway, your asses are going straight to deportation holding. Is that clear?\u201d\nAre they supposed to answer? Agree to this? Pedro\u2019s ex murmurs \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d and the others follow. The woman stares at Julia until she ducks her head and says, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d too.\nThey reconvene on the High Path, a narrow public walkway that loops through the upper levels of the city, connecting to buildings and support struts, with a few benches and baskets of plants attached to its sides. None of them have the money to waste on beer or even hot noodles. Julia feels like she\u2019s in a trap and only waiting for it to snap shut. There\u2019s still a red line on her wrist from the zip tie.\nRiRi sighs and sticks their legs over the edge to dangle. \u201cI think it\u2019s that prisoners can\u2019t be deported before trial. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t want to arrest us. This is actually worse, this one-offense warning.\u201d\nRafael is unfairly happy, pacing back and forth, making the walk bounce with his steps. \u201cNo. This was a step. A stride. They backed down. We have them. Five people is too many for them to arrest. Imagine what we can do with this!\u201d\n\u201cGet beat up again?\u201d Pedro\u2019s ex asks.\nThey can see so much from up here. Part of a mural that might be a child throwing a baseball or just reaching for a glowing, floating one. The odd, organic blue plastic of the university annex peeking around the traditional, square shapes of other buildings. Graffiti. There\u2019s a man leaning on a railing below them, gesturing now and again as he talks to someone remotely. His forearms are like drumsticks. A woman waters a sweet pea vine in a window to the right of him.\nWalkways and stairways and floors, all built one atop another, atop empty air. Julia imagines it falling, emptying, ending. She imagines what it was like when her mother first saw it, when there was just an aerostat and a gantry and a fabber spinning out material from clouds.\nThe others haven\u2019t stopped arguing. \u201cWell, what are we supposed to do, then?\u201d Rafael demands. \u201cNothing?\u201d\nJulia can see through crossed walkways and power lines to workers brushing a mylar sheet against the interior of the dome. An ugly, temporary fix. It brings the anger back.\nTwo men are jogging on the walkway. Rafael and Pedro\u2019s ex have to squeeze to the side to let them pass. As they do, one of the joggers mutters, \u201cLazy bums.\u201d\nThe other is louder. \u201cIf you don\u2019t love the city, leave it.\u201d\nThe first whispers something to him, and they both turn back, scowling, and it\u2019s not the casual hatred of the rich for the poor, it\u2019s specific. They know who they are looking at, and they want very much to push the lot of them off the walkway.\nJulia gets up and goes toward the nearest stairs down.\nShe didn\u2019t expect Rafael and RiRi to come with. They followed her down and pestered until the direction she walked made it pointless to hide her destination. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Angel.\u201d She showed them the message, that she could still have her job back.\n\u201cAre you, though?\u201d\nJulia shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019ll get me in to talk to him.\u201d\nAngel holds the door frame as if to prevent them from entering the administrative office. \u201cAre you ALL expecting me to give your jobs back?\u201d He looks pointedly at Rafael.\n\u201cWe just want to talk,\u201d Julia says.\nAngel starts to close the door. Julia pushes her arm into the gap. \u201cYou know the dome needs regular maintenance. You know it\u2019s more work than four people can do.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my decision.\u201d\n\u201cThen let us talk to whoever\u2019s it is.\u201d\nAngel shakes his head. \u201cI need to keep my job.\u201d\nHis exhausted expression isn\u2019t different from Marta\u2019s when she said the same thing. \u201cDo you? Why? Who decided we had to bow to jobs? What about my mother? What\u2019s her job?\u201d\n\u201cShe served the city.\u201d\n\u201cSo did I.\u201d\nAngel presses his hands together. \u201cPlease. Just take the job back. They\u2019re already threatening to ship you off for leaving.\u201d\nJulia has nothing to threaten other than violence, and she doesn\u2019t want that. Angel is awful, but he is also a person. \u201cLet us cut through the office.\u201d\nHe frowns. \u201cWhat? No. I just said. I need this job!\u201d\nJulia puts her hand on Angel\u2019s chest and pushes. She increases force until it\u2019s enough and he stumbles back. She pushes him all the way to his desk, and his arms pinwheel until they clasp the front edge. \u201cSo we forced our way in,\u201d she says, and leaves him there, walking to the inner door, the one that leads from administration to operations, and from there, to the locker room.\nShe still doesn\u2019t expect Rafael and RiRi to follow, but they do.\nShe doesn\u2019t go deeper into operations looking for the boss. She doesn\u2019t think it would help. There\u2019s an endless line above Angel, of people just doing their jobs, pointing up until you got to the top, and the top person points down at the bottom, saying, \u201cI need to keep their support.\u201d\nThe locker room is a tumbled mess. Anti-acid powder footprints track everywhere. Julia finds a clean pair of grip-soles and puts them on over her regular shoes. If she\u2019s doing this, she might as well be comfortable.\nRiRi hangs by the door, uncertain, but Rafael starts gearing up, taking gloves from this locker, a face shield from that. RiRi shakes their head. \u201cSo, you\u2019re . . . breaking in here, just to work?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone has to do this.\u201d Julia hasn\u2019t thought too much beyond that. She\u2019s angry and tired of being blamed for not doing a job she wants to do.\nRafael settles the shoulder straps of a safety harness and grins. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. We save the city, we show them what side they should support.\u201d\nNot much Rafael has said has ever turned out true, but Julia wants to take comfort in his optimism. She starts to put on a face shield, finds it stinks of garlic and sickness, and puts it back, picking up another.\nThat\u2019s when the door bursts open. She doesn\u2019t hear what they shout, something like \u201cget down\u201d or \u201chands up\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a percussion note, like the boots, the batons hitting the lockers. The police fan in quickly, one left, one right, one left.\nRiRi stumbles, pushed down by them. They look up, disbelief in their eyes, their arms cradling their head, and then RiRi is diving toward the police, rolling on the floor into their legs.\nRafael has already gone out the airlock. Julia hates that she doesn\u2019t hesitate longer.\nRafael slams the door behind them and twists the handle off. Julia doesn\u2019t think that will actually do anything, but there\u2019s no time to argue about it. She grabs her rope and starts climbing.\nIt\u2019s full Sun Day, not the right time for doing this, and the heat is unexpected, strange. The texture of her feet on the glass feels stickier.\nWhatever\u2019s happening behind her, she is soon absorbed in the task of climbing. She\u2019s already out of shape, gasping more than usual. Or maybe it\u2019s the heat.\nShe skitters to the top to see Rafael a few paces behind her. Sees him see her and slow down, checking his squeegee on his hip. When they both reach the top, he bows to her, gesturing.\n\u201cDork,\u201d she says, but she twists the knob. It doesn\u2019t feel how she\u2019d imagined.\nWith gestures, they split the dome in two. They go slowly, no time limit, checking for damage. It doesn\u2019t take long to find the first crack. Julia smooths it and wonders if someone will climb up behind her, yank her off the city. There are emergency service balloons and helicopters. Her back prickles and not all the sweat is from the sun.\nTwo passes, and it\u2019s already feeling longer than doing the base of her old section. Her radio crackles. She forgot it was built into the helmet, that she was wearing it.\n\u201cRafael Rodriguez. Julia Lopez. By order of the chief of police, you will not be permitted to reenter the city.\u201d\nJulia stops where she is, the too-loud, hard voice echoing in her mind. She keeps expecting them to say more. She hears the rhythmic jingling of Rafael\u2019s harness as he hops to her. He\u2019s breathing heavy. \u201cThey\u2019re locking us out.\u201d\nJulia readjusts her grip on the safety line. She looks at her feet. They\u2019re still on the flattish top of the dome, the view beneath her is a rooftop with skylights and vents. Will the acid rain melt their clothes first? No, she\u2019s being silly. They\u2019ll die of thirst long before anything else gets them.\nJulia sees what might be a crack to her right. \u201cSee you on the other side,\u201d she says and goes to it.\nRafael is still and quiet a long time before he resumes washing.\nTwo more passes. They get another warning not to go near the airlocks. Rafael finds a discolored patch. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone is listening on this channel. But it\u2019s grid 4-C-10. Someone should make a note and come back here.\u201d\nJulia is exhausted. She finds Rafael has stopped, sitting, his knees up, on the curve of the glass. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting through this in four hours, chica. Take a load off.\u201d\nSo she copies his posture and looks out on the cloud sea. The tantalizing deep valleys that look like they hold secrets. The soft curving slopes she imagined sledding down as a child. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die here.\u201d\nRafael snorts like it\u2019s a joke. \u201cAnd I\u2019m already almost out of repair gel.\u201d\nWhen their legs are rested, they resume their work. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything else to do.\nOn the next pass, they are even with some apartments, and people have gathered to watch for them. A man with a baby waves. Julia waves back.\nThe next floor down, there are more people. They don\u2019t look angry at them. They look excited. It gives Julia strength. She works harder.\nThen she sees her mother.\nIt\u2019s a rooftop park. A nicer neighborhood than theirs. She went there once with a school club, to do some plant-identification assignment. Julia can\u2019t see the little cards on the beds now because the rooftop is crowded with people holding signs.\n\u201cMaintenance is life,\u201d reads a large one. Another says, \u201cJustice for workers.\u201d\nShe is startled by two girls waving at her, shaking a banner. \u201cI stand with Lopez.\u201d\nHer mother\u2019s sign is one of the nicest, of course, with clean, elegant letters. \u201cMy daughter has the most important job in the city.\u201d\nMarie Vibbert has sold over eighty short stories to places like Nature, F&SF, and Analog. Her work has been translated into Vietnamese and Chinese. Her debut novel, Galactic Hellcats, about a female biker gang in outer space rescuing a gay prince, was on the British Science Fiction Association\u2019s long list for 2021. Her second novel, The Gods Awoke (Journey Press, September 2022), is about a powerful telepathic sentience discovering she is not a god."}

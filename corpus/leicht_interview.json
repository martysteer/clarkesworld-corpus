Instead, she grew up to be a writer who has impressed fans and critics alike.\n Stina Leicht (\u201cPronounced \u2018Steena.\u2019 Think of it as Tina with an extra-added S. My last name is pronounced \u2018Lite,\u2019 like the beer.\u201d) was born in St. Louis, MO. She went to Sam Houston State University and the University of Houston; and studied 3D animation at Austin Community College. Leicht has worked as a bookseller, a graphic designer, and in the gaming industry. She has been a full-time writer and freelancer since 2005.\n Leicht\u2019s debut novel, Of Blood and Honey, came out in 2011 with Night Shade Books, to strong reviews and acclaim, including landing as a finalist for the Crawford Award for best first fantasy. A historical fantasy set during the Troubles in 1970s Northern Ireland, it was followed by sequel And Blue Skies from Pain in 2012\u2014fans placed Leicht on the finalist list for the Astounding Award (then called the Campbell Best New Writer award) in both 2012 and 2013.\n In 2015 and 2017 Leicht published The Malorum Gates duology with Saga Press: Cold Iron and Blackthorne, books that received praise from venues such as NPR and Barnes & Noble; the latter book appeared on the Locus Recommended Reading list.\n Her forthcoming title is \u201can enjoyable and thrilling read\u201d according to Library Journal; Persephone Station, due from Saga Press in January of 2021.\n Stina Leicht lives in central Texas. During the pandemic, she has been working on the next book and a few short stories. After more than a decade of not doing anything with her animation and graphic design skills, she has made a recent return to art, saying, \u201cMy mother and I started painting together over Zoom. It\u2019s pretty great.\u201d She plays Rock Band with husband Dane Caruthers. \u201cMy instrument of choice is the drums. I\u2019m taking French lessons too. (Even if I\u2019m dyslexic, go figure.)\u201d\n What was breaking in for you, how did it happen? Were there struggles or has it been a fairly easy journey?\n Is anyone\u2019s journey easy? I doubt it. Although honestly, my story is kind of weird.\n I\u2019ve wanted to be a writer since I was in the seventh grade. However, my father actively discouraged me. So, I stopped writing.\n In 2001, I was working as a well-paid graphic designer. However, the dot com bust happened and I was laid off on the day of my wedding. Not being able to find another graphic design job forced me to rethink my career. The only work available was minimum wage retail or coffee shop gigs. I decided on a bookstore. If nothing else, it was indirectly related to publishing and sounded fun. Going from making a substantial salary to less than minimum wage was depressing to say the least. Two months later, I found out I had breast cancer. It was at that point I decided it was time to start writing with the intent of becoming a professional. Why not? What was left to lose? (I\u2019m totally fine now. Hurray for modern medicine!) Ultimately, writing was what kept me sane.\n Also, I married well in the sense that my husband is amazing. We\u2019ve been through so much together and we\u2019re still going strong. Anyway . . .\n The bookstore (BookPeople) proved to be exactly the right place for me to be. I learned a lot about the publishing process. I practiced elevator pitches all day long (hand selling books), spoke with book reps, and met famous authors and sometimes their agents\u2014Jeff VanderMeer, Holly Black, Neil Gaiman, Anne Rice, and Jasper Fforde to name a few. I also attended SlugTribe meetings (a local free writers\u2019 group for newbies) and signed up for ArmadilloCon\u2019s Writers\u2019 Workshop.\n Then my husband was laid off. Financially, life totally sucked. We were so broke. But we had one another and I stayed focused on writing. During the second Writers\u2019 Workshop the guest editor, Jim Minz, liked my story so much he asked for my novel. While that was amazing, in the end he rejected it. (He was right to do so.) I learned how to bounce back from rejection. A very useful skill!\n In 2009 Jeff VanderMeer asked me to contribute to Last Drink Bird Head. Amazingly, he took the story. That was my first big break. That same year I finished Of Blood and Honey and asked Holly for agenting advice. (She\u2019s such a kind and patient person.) She introduced me to Joe Monti. When Joe read my OB&H draft, he asked for some major changes. (I threw away 66,000 words of that first draft.) By the end of the year Joe became my agent. He sold my first novel to Night Shade Books that December.\n I worked very hard to become the best writer I could. I studied. I read. I took classes. I listened to anyone who would speak to me about publishing. (I still do all these things.) Money was a struggle the whole way. At the same time, I\u2019ve also been extremely lucky\u2014as long as I\u2019ve focused on writing. No other job situation worked out. That\u2019s what\u2019s weird. It\u2019s like the Universe stepped in and said, \u201cEnough of that. Time to write.\u201d\n On your site you describe Persephone Station as a \u201cfeminist SF novel.\u201d Were you always writing feminist works, even back in seventh grade when you were putting down words for your first novel? Or was there a process of shifting into feminist writing?\n Interestingly enough, that first novel did have some feminist ideas. Mind you, they weren\u2019t well thought out, and I wasn\u2019t aware of what I was doing. I also wasn\u2019t a feminist, let alone an intersectional one. And that\u2019s why my first novels are mainly about straight white cis men. I\u2019d absorbed the ridiculous idea that stories about other genders just weren\u2019t Important. I wanted to be taken seriously. Internalized misogyny is such a bitch. I suppose a lot of women have this problem. Like Madge in the Palmolive commercials, we\u2019re all soaking in it.\n That\u2019s why writing female point of view characters is hard for me. It took years to understand that not writing women was an issue. Joe wouldn\u2019t stop asking why, bless him. So, I relented. I eased into it with Cold Iron and Blackthorne.\n At the exact same time, I raged about films that lacked women as characters. Some didn\u2019t even have women in the background. When women are portrayed, often they\u2019re minor, non-plot-affecting characters, or they\u2019re the love interest who gets killed off before the next movie. That\u2019s another thing that bugs me. Have you noticed how often women in films sleep with their male coworkers? It\u2019s rarer for them not to in movies and on TV. That\u2019s so not reality.\n I didn\u2019t see how hypocritical it was to complain of stories not containing women and not writing stories about women. I bring this up because I feel it\u2019s important to learn, change, and grow. I\u2019ve made some terrible mistakes. Everyone does. It\u2019s important to own them, though. You can\u2019t learn from mistakes you don\u2019t own. Hell, I wasn\u2019t even an intersectional feminist until around 2006. I learned. I continue to learn. I also continue to make mistakes, but I also improve as a person. I wish more Americans were okay with changing their minds. Being able to learn, apologize, and change our behavior is a positive trait.\n One last thing: if no one demands to know the worldbuilding reason why there are no women in a story or film, then frankly no one needs a worldbuilding reason for why there are no men. For the record, there are men in Persephone Station. They\u2019re in the background. Some even have a line or two of dialogue.\n Some even sleep with their coworkers.\n How do you personally define space opera, what is the appeal of space opera to you, and what do you think is the appeal to readers?\n For me, space opera is the fun stuff. It\u2019s Star Trek and Star Wars. It\u2019s a band of intergalactic criminals stuck on a living starship, having to learn how to cooperate in order to survive. The emphasis is adventure and interesting characters set against a vast backdrop. Actual science is a bonus. In the case of Persephone Station, most of that science is in the artificial intelligence aspects of the story. I do like to put something factual in my work. It\u2019s also good to encourage readers to think for themselves.\n That said, I think escapism is what readers are looking for. They want Fun with a capital F\u2014particularly now. It isn\u2019t fair that straight white cis men get all the stories. So, I\u2019m writing for the rest of us.\n There have been discussions in the field lately around \u201ccomps\u201d (comparative descriptions of one work to other works), with many authors saying the comps assigned to their books by publicity teams weren\u2019t accurate. Persephone Station comps are The Mandalorian and Cowboy Bebop\u2014do you feel like these are accurate? What are the important similarities between your book and those shows? Or are there better comps to draw on\u2014and why?\n The Mandalorian is a spaghetti western plus Lone Wolf and Cub set in space. I\u2019ve only ever seen a few episodes of Cowboy Bebop, but it\u2019s an ensemble cast, and it too is influenced by Westerns. So, I think they\u2019re both good choices.\n As you know, literature has a long history of riffing off of other genres. If you read Heinlein, Norton, Bradbury\u2014any of the early \u201cGolden Age SF\u201d canon\u2014you\u2019ll see the Western genre influence. Firefly wasn\u2019t the first, not even close. Even Gene Roddenberry pitched Star Trek to the TV executives as \u201ca wagon train to the stars.\u201d Just listen to the opening: Space: the final frontier . . . I\u2019m not even the first to take a Western genre film and transpose its plot into SF. Have you seen Outland? It\u2019s brilliant! The scriptwriters set High Noon in a space mining colony. Sean Connery plays the sheriff. I highly recommend it. Doctor Lazarus is one of my favorite female characters in a SF film.\n You received a lot of recognition from your debut series, Fey and the Fallen: nominations two years in a row for the Astounding Award and short-listed for the IAFA William L. Crawford Fantasy Award. What, for you, was the impact of that attention?\n I\u2019m so grateful that happened. It was every bit as amazing as you\u2019d imagine and extremely stressful at exactly the same time. I went from being a total unknown to having George R. R. Martin mispronounce my name on an international stage. The imposter syndrome was awful\u2014particularly since the book I thought I\u2019d written wasn\u2019t serious. (How hilarious is that?) I didn\u2019t see myself as a literary writer at all. I had it in my head that literary writers had degrees in literature. I definitely don\u2019t. It was confusing. There was so much pressure to write something new that did as well as that first novel. Oh my god, the sophomore slump is no joke. Poor Joe. He had to put up with me crying all over the front of his shirt. He really is the best. I\u2019m so very lucky to have him in my work life. He gets my work. He\u2019s incredible\u2014really one of my favorite people.\n Are there important similarities and differences in your approach to narrative, structure, or other elements, between that first series and Persephone Station? Has your writing changed in significant ways?\n As an artist, I was trained to paint in different styles. Having range as a writer is a good thing, I think.\n With Of Blood and Honey I was obsessed with replicating a Northern Irish voice. So, I read a number of northern Irish crime writers\u2019 works. Some, like Adrian McKinty\u2019s, I read and reread so I could get the rhythm of the prose right. I allowed myself a certain flowery-ness in my language. It\u2019s expected in fantasy because fantasy, specifically urban fantasy, is more surreal, more dreamlike.\n Fear was also a big part of how I wrote those books too. I was terrified of getting it wrong. I honestly didn\u2019t want to cause more harm. But I could only get so much information on The Troubles here in the US and most of that is written from . . . let\u2019s just say a decidedly not Catholic Nationalist perspective. The situation isn\u2019t much different from listening to a Trump supporter\u2019s version of events at a BLM march. I\u2019m not saying that The Troubles is a Good vs. Evil dichotomy. Far from it. It was a civil war and human beings were involved. Humans are complicated beasties. At the same time, the victors definitely write history. That made research tricky. I also had to rely upon old photographs\u2014black and white news photographs even\u2014because I couldn\u2019t afford to go to Ireland. I was working at the bookstore for less than minimum wage, after all. So, I interviewed people who lived through it and that helped a lot. I spent so much time at the Ulster University CAIN website (cain.ulster.ac.uk). But there were holes in my research. There always will be in situations like that. Finding firsthand accounts of certain events was almost impossible to find. Life in The Maze prison for example. Unionists don\u2019t want to remember things like that. They erase it. (Or in the case of The Maze, bulldoze it.) Nonetheless, thanks to Ian MacDonald and Brian Magee, my friends in West Belfast, I was able to find most of what I needed. It still felt spotty. So, the plot jumps to different moments that I\u2019m comfortable telling\u2014kind of like stop-motion. It had the added advantage of replicating certain aspects of repeated trauma upon a victim\u2019s memory.\n Persephone Station was its own adventure. I feel science fiction requires more direct language. It\u2019s an entirely different animal and the prose has to reflect that. So, I kept my prose as clean as possible. The action is punchy and over the top. The car chases are dog fights. The dialogue is quippy.\n Overall, I like to think I\u2019ve become a better writer. I\u2019ve certainly learned more about writing than I ever thought I would. And yet, there\u2019s so much more to learn. Isn\u2019t that wonderful?\n Back to the idea of Persephone Station as a \u201cfeminist SF novel.\u201d Why is the \u201cfeminist\u201d distinction still important, and what does it mean specifically in terms of this work?\n I\u2019m a Star Trek fan. I definitely want to live in that future. If we are to create a world based upon equality, we must imagine it first. Diverse characters\u2014all genders, all races need representation. Such casts reflect reality. But if that isn\u2019t enough to underscore the importance of diversity, studies have proven that reading helps people develop empathy. If there\u2019s one thing we need more of right now, it\u2019s empathy for people who aren\u2019t exactly like us. It\u2019s the only way humanity can save itself from destruction.\n Everyone deserves a future.\n For the record, when I use the word women I mean for it to include trans women. Trans women are women. Period.\n Anyway, science fiction has a reputation as being written only by white cis men for white cis men. In my experience, readers don\u2019t much care for surprises. So, for Persephone Station, the feminist distinction is important. The novel is not only female-focused, its metaphors are femme-oriented as well. The weather reflects the feeling of a world that is hostile to the characters simply for being. The aliens display typical feminine qualities. They\u2019re invisible except when they have something those in power want. They\u2019re passive. They\u2019re diplomatic. They\u2019re groomed to conform to another\u2019s expectations to the extent that they become different people than who they really are. There\u2019s a lot of thought put into it.\n Several reviews talk about this book as being fast paced. Craft-wise, what is the key to writing a fast-paced novel?\n A tight outline is vital. I\u2019m saying this, and I\u2019m an organic writer. Ironic or what? In short stories, your words must serve multiple purposes due to limited space. The same is true for fast-paced novels. Don\u2019t waste words.\n I tend to build upon the characters and setting at the start. Readers need to know when and where they are as soon as possible. (Unless it\u2019s your intent for the reader to feel lost.) Give readers hooky characters. This is key, in my opinion. It does no good to write punchy action if no one cares who the action is happening to. The scene will feel intense and fast if the reader is emotionally invested.\n Lastly, movies aren\u2019t novels. It\u2019s important to know how many details are too much. I prefer to keep the prose short and punchy for action scenes. Get to the point. Use juicy adjectives. Remember the human brain can only track a certain amount of information in an emergency\u2014and fights certainly count as emergencies. Some things will slip and that\u2019s okay. Remember that brains behave differently on adrenaline. So does the body. I recommend reading about the science of perception. The human brain is weird.\n Is there anything else you really want readers to know about the book, beyond the blurbs and the reviews? What is special about this one for you?\n We need more stories about women working together in groups, being smart, being friends, doing things that require courage and strength. I\u2019m not talking about the Strong Woman trope. Women need to be people in stories, not a cis man\u2019s ideal of what a woman should be. We almost never see other genders in these relationships and situations\u2014only straight cis men. I mean, romance is fine. I have a wonderful partner that I love. I get it. But there\u2019s more to life than being in a romantic relationship. Other genders need to see themselves living those options too. Also? Enough with the \u201cThere can be only one [fill in the blank non-cis white male].\u201d routine already. That\u2019s why I wrote this book.\n What was the most challenging aspect of writing this book, and how did you deal with the challenge?\n For a start, I had to overcome my fear of writing SF. All my life I\u2019ve heard about how women don\u2019t write science fiction. I\u2019ve always secretly wanted to, but it\u2019s understood that fantasy is where women belong\u2014particularly YA and urban fantasy. That\u2019s total bullshit, but it\u2019s the truth. I have this thing about \u201cauthorities\u201d telling me that I can\u2019t do something. Mind you, it took a while to change gears, but I did it. I focused on the science that interested me\u2014artificial intelligence, biology, and psychology. It\u2019s what male authors do. Why couldn\u2019t I?\n Writing seven female characters, several of them as point of view characters, was a challenge too. To make it easier on myself, I took several of my favorite male characters and borrowed certain qualities from them. Then I approached the crew as women. What sorts of traditionally femme things do they like? What do I like? And it took off from there. I suspect that\u2019s why they\u2019re each such distinct people. What\u2019s the saying? Make your weaknesses your strengths?\n You also have a Patreon. Is Patreon a good model for authors, is it the future of publishing? Or is it a platform some will find hard to utilize to significant effect?\n I\u2019m leery whenever anyone uses the expression \u201cthe future of publishing\u201d in reference to anything electronic. If the computer age has proven one thing, it\u2019s its own impermanence. I can\u2019t tell you how many files I\u2019ve lost over time because they\u2019re stored on Jazz drives or floppies or whatever software program that\u2019s no longer in use. The computer industry, in its race to programmed obsolescence (because PROFIT), has neglected to maintain its past. I could go on, but I won\u2019t.\n Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m a GenX cynic.\n Back to the subject, I do think Patreon is a great platform for artists. Just less so for writers. As with anything, there\u2019s no one solution for everyone. A lot of it depends upon how much you put into it. Also, Patreon doesn\u2019t tell you that you need to be already established. Building from scratch is extremely difficult.\n For myself, I wasn\u2019t actually sold. I\u2019m still not, not really. But I was tired of putting so much work into my blog for nothing. Sure, Feminist Monday is important work. The idea was that people\u2014mainly male people\u2014never saw the bigger picture. They\u2019d maybe read one article and think that was all there was to that issue and move on, but feminism is more complex. It affects everyone everywhere, yes, even men. As my audience grew, I began to see results. Men wrote me to say they\u2019d never thought about this or that aspect of our culture that way before. If you want a real mind bender, read Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez.\n Sorry. Once a bookseller, always a bookseller.\n Anyway, it was so much work. I got tired. K. Tempest Bradford talked me into starting a Patreon. It\u2019s not much, but it pays for itself as well as my website. That\u2019s enough for me. Of course, if I didn\u2019t have an extremely supportive partner, my priorities would be different. Naturally.\n You have over a hundred posts on your Patreon. What can readers and fans look forward to if they become patrons?\n I still do feminist posts, but not as often. Politics these days are so exhausting. I tend to post my artwork, talk about any new stories that get published, and discuss tarot cards. During October, I recommended horror comedies and matched them with songs.\n What else are you working on, what else do you have coming up that you\u2019d like readers to know about?\n I\u2019m working on a new space opera called Loki\u2019s Ring. It\u2019s another group of women working together\u2014only this time they\u2019re an emergency response team. I\u2019ve also got a story in Evil in Technicolor, a Horror anthology edited by Joe McDermott. And I wrote a humorous short story for my friend Martin Wagner for his BookTube channel.\n Arley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

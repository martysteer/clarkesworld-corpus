Chimera\n It had the fore part of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and its third head, the middle one, was that of a goat, through which it belched fire.\n It was begotten by Typhon on Echidna, as Hesiod relates.\n \u2014Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, Book 2, Chapter 3 (as translated by Sir James George Frazer)\n I watch her enter.\n In the six years since we parted ways, I\u2019ve always wanted to know: exactly how cold and calculating is the machine under the soft, lustrous skin of this witch?\n She sees me, her eyes filling with delight\u2014no trace of embarrassment, nor shame.\n \u201cEvan.\u201d She quickens her footsteps. \u201cDarling, long time no see.\u201d\n A delicate, warm perfume wafts from her approaching figure, the same as the scent in my memory. I recall what she said as she bared her heart to me, not long after we were married:\n \u201cLately I\u2019ve been thinking\u2014I could write my dissertation based on pictures of my expressions: Managing Emotions and Social Responses. What do you think? Take smiles: I know over a thousand of them, and each requires the manipulation of different muscle groups. Each one can be the response for many situations, and their combinations are infinite!\n \u201cThe only difficulty is meticulous expression management. It would require massive calculations; perhaps it\u2019s untenable\u2014Evan, don\u2019t look at me that way\u2014enough. See, you musicians always misunderstand the scientific mind. I\u2019m not a machine; a Turing machine would never be able to figure out in such a short time which smile to use in which circumstance\u2014I\u2019m a human being, a wonderful creation.\n \u201cThis is a worthy subject for biology.\u201d\n She solemnly pointed at her head, then laughed with a snort: sweet, innocent, like she couldn\u2019t contain herself. \u201cLook at you. So serious! I\u2019m just joking around.\u201d\n Now, she stands before me in a fine cashmere coat, a silk scarf snug against her throat: both wrapping her well-exercised, slim body. Nothing escapes her keen interest: she studies society, fashion, health, romance. She studies me, studies my passions, my expressions, my movements, as though I\u2019m the most fascinating person she\u2019s ever seen. In reality, I\u2019m no different than the rats in her laboratory. She grants my wishes\u2014then takes them away.\n She looks at me, the joy displayed by the curved corners of her mouth calibrated perfectly. But, face-to-face with my ex-wife, I can\u2019t call forth the happiness from when we were in love.\n I\u2019m weary of this.\n \u201cI just wanted to talk about Tony.\u201d\n No tabloid reporter would ever believe the truth: a mother abandoning her swaddled infant and guiltless husband on the same day as the child\u2019s birth, then disappearing off the face of the Earth for six years.\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n I finally catch a flicker of weakness in her eyes, but her voice remains level.\n \u201cI was just about to come talk to you about him, too.\u201d\n Tony is six.\n If it weren\u2019t for what happened three months ago, I would have never contacted his mother. That day, as I took Tony to the park, a maroon Honda barreled out of nowhere onto the sidewalk and pulled Tony under a tire. After five days in the emergency room, he opened his eyes, but his kidneys had sustained irreparable damage. Upon discovering that his body couldn\u2019t take a kidney transplant, I realized that my son would have to undergo dialysis three times a week for the rest of his life. In despair, I pored over every piece of medical literature I could get my hands on until I stumbled upon the topic of regenerative medicine, the goal of which is to use the patient\u2019s own stem cells to grow replacement organs.\n One of the foremost scientists in this field is my ex-wife. A rising star, she\u2019s in charge of a new chimera lab that successfully grew a rat\u2019s pancreas inside a mouse. They created a chimera that had never before existed in nature. In journal articles, commentators viewed this study as a milestone for regenerative medicine. Based on this success, a human-pig chimera could, in theory, be viable. And now, I\u2019m hoping that she can grow Tony\u2019s kidneys inside a pig. After the pig matures, the kidneys can be transplanted back to Tony.\n As she gently stirs a cup of Darjeeling tea, she murmurs, \u201cOf course I love him. You have no idea how painful the news of the accident was for me. But what you mentioned in your letter\u2014I really can\u2019t make that happen.\u201d\n \u201cI read your article, plus the discussions in Cell. You and your lab are the only people in the whole world who would be able to duplicate Tony\u2019s kidneys.\u201d Seeing her disbelief, I can\u2019t stop myself from adding, \u201cPlease don\u2019t assume that I can\u2019t find and read scientific articles.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. You\u2019re so smart\u2014if you want to accomplish something, you\u2019ll get it done.\u201d She masks her surprise and lets out a small sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, if you\u2019ve already read my article, then you\u2019d know that this is all only theoretical. Rat-mouse chimeras and human-pig chimeras are two entirely different things; it\u2019s like\u2014\u201d She looks up, blinking, then looks back at me. \u201c\u2014Like how you can sing, and you can play guitar, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can play a pipe organ.\u201d\n \u201cI could do it with time,\u201d I say. \u201cThese skills share similar principles.\u201d\n Facepalm. \u201cLord, that was a terrible analogy. How should I explain this to you . . . I imagine you already know how the chimera I created came to be.\u201d\n I turn on my iPad. I\u2019ve already highlighted many paragraphs in her article, so I find the quote I\u2019m looking for easily: \u201cWe injected induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from a rat into blastocysts from a mouse lacking the Pdx1 gene. Mice lacking the Pdx1 gene are unable to develop a normal pancreas; the rat iPS cells were able to remedy the genetic deficiency of the recipient mouse blastocysts. These rat-mouse chimeras were able to develop into adults with normal, functional pancreases.\u201d1\n She points to a sentence. \u201cOh right, this part. You must know that rats and mice are two entirely different animals, right? In taxonomical terms, the former is of the genus Rattus, and the latter is Mus\u2014\u201d\n I interrupt her. \u201cOf course!\u201d\n \u201cSorry.\u201d She shrugs, then points again at that line of text. \u201cLook here. If we wanted to use a similar method to create a human-pig chimera, then we would first have to get blastocysts from a pig that lacks the genes to produce kidneys. But where would we get such blastocysts? And how would we locate genes that can develop kidneys? These are all problems we have to solve from the ground up, and we don\u2019t know if we\u2019d be successful at any of them.\u201d2\n \u201cI\u2019m begging you to try.\u201d I see her lips opening and closing, but I don\u2019t understand her words. \u201cI know there\u2019s no guarantee of success.\u201d\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t say \u2018beg\u2019; he\u2019s also my son. I\u2019m willing to do anything for him.\u201d She implores me with a doleful look, her eyebrows downturned. \u201c\u2018Try\u2019\u2014See, that\u2019s the second question. Let\u2019s say we could find all the genes that contribute to kidney development and knock them out of the pig blastocyst with precision. Then what? Can I inject Tony\u2019s cells into the blastocyst? No. Using human embryonic stem cells to do research is illegal and highly unethical.\u201d\n \u201cYou care about that?\u201d I stare at her, astounded. \u201cYou care about ethics?\u201d\n She touches a finger to her lips. \u201cPlease lower your voice.\u201d\n I know her all too well. If she didn\u2019t want to respond to my request, she wouldn\u2019t have come to see me.\n She winks, as if we share an unspeakable little secret.\n \u201cTell me, what would it take to get you to try?\u201d I really can\u2019t take much more of her antics.\n She breaks eye contact and turns to look outside. A long silence. I gaze at her profile: her refined, nurturing face is as beautiful as it was the last time I saw her. In the afternoon light, she\u2019s radiant, like a statue of the Virgin Mary in a church\u2014a cold statue that can breathe. At last, she smiles and turns back to me:\n \u201cA mother smashing through scientific taboos to save her son\u2019s life\u2014such a tale is enough for me, even better if I get to play the role of the magnificent mother in this story.\u201d\n Yes, that would be her. Her actions are endowed with philosophy and poetry, but her performance is always built upon her own awareness of the philosophy and poetry that her actions will bring to her. In her mind, she\u2019s cut off from the rest of the world, a god surveying the Earth. She will undertake this difficult task not because Tony is her son, but because doing so will turn her into a glorious legend.\n What a selfish, abhorrent monster.\n She continues. \u201cI must tell you that I have no confidence of success. When it comes to human experimentation, there\u2019s no precedent to refer to, and I may even create a monster\u2014but that\u2019s what makes it exciting, no? I\u2019ll do it, but I still recommend that you go to the hospital and look into standard kidney transplant\u2014\u201d\n \u201cEvery one of his lymphocyte cross-matching tests has come back positive.\u201d\n She looks at me, not quite understanding. \u201cSo?\u201d\n \u201cKidneys from a donor will likely lead to acute rejection,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s possible he can only take a transplant from his own body.\u201d\n \u201cMy God.\u201d She furrows her brow.\n \u201cRight now we\u2019re relying on dialysis to keep him alive. You can\u2019t imagine how painful this is.\u201d I think of Tony\u2019s cries and can\u2019t help but shudder.\n The light in her eyes grows firm and resolute. \u201cI understand. I\u2019ll put my all into this.\u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d I say.\n \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing that I should tell you.\u201d She gets up and walks to my chair, then sits on the armrest. She holds up the iPad and finds another paragraph. \u201cLook here.\u201d\n A few locks of her hair fall against my face. I stare at those words, but they\u2019re beyond my comprehension. I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \u201cThe commentator here points out that although the result of the chimera experiment is successful, we don\u2019t fully understand the underlying principles. So, in the course of these experiments, we can\u2019t control the degree of chimerization. Although the goal may be to produce a pancreas, other areas of the mouse body may also have rat cells.\u201d\n \u201cSo?\u201d\n \u201cThis is the primary reason why we can\u2019t just play around with human cells in research,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we did a human-pig chimera experiment, I have no way of controlling how many human cells end up in the pig.\u201d\n \u201cI still don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d\n \u201cThink about it, Evan.\u201d She puts her hands on my shoulders and looks at me. \u201cThis pig may become a second Tony\u2014our son could be concealed in its body. And when it grows up, we\u2019ll snatch its kidneys together, then kill it.\u201d\n A. Adam\n Lin Ke lay outside the operating room.\n They were already an hour late, and the anesthesiologist hadn\u2019t even arrived yet. The only thing separating her naked body from the people walking up and down the corridor was a thin layer of white fabric. She felt very uneasy.\n \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we started yet?\u201d she asked the nurse.\n Flustered, the nurse replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve just received notice that due to factors outside our control, your cultivated organ order was canceled. We\u2019re very sorry.\u201d\n What kind of reason was that?! She was the biggest goody-two-shoes aboard this spaceship. In all her one hundred years here, she\u2019d always paid her cultivated organ insurance premiums on time to ensure that her every organ would remain young and healthy. Her heart, the very organ that she was trying to replace, palpitated from rage.\n She put on her clothes as quickly as she could. The first thing she did was to file a police report. Then, she took the rail to Deck Seven\u2014supposedly, her new organ was there, in an Adam.\n \u201cAs your customer,\u201d she protested to the overseer, \u201cI demand an explanation for why my order was canceled. I absolutely will not wait another three years with only this shoddy heart!\u201d\n \u201cBut your order is perfectly fine,\u201d the overseer said, surprised. He turned on the monitor. The feed showed the interior of an organ cultivation cabin: organ after organ was wrapped in thin film, all of them growing from tubes that hung from the ceiling. They looked like bunches of grapes waiting for harvest.\n But the heart that belonged to Lin Ke was already gone and marked as \u201charvested.\u201d\n Stunned, Lin Ke checked the hospital\u2019s information platform again, forwarding the notice with the subject \u201cOrder Cancellation\u201d to the overseer. But she wasn\u2019t expecting that he would doubt the veracity of the notice. \u201cMa\u2019am, our monitoring platform can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d\n The overseer\u2019s response enraged Lin Ke. She stood up. \u201cIf you can\u2019t figure out what happened, then I\u2019ll have to go take a look myself.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. The organ cultivation contract specifies that to be within your rights.\u201d The overseer didn\u2019t back down at all. \u201cBut please remember, you can only look. You cannot enter the cabin.\u201d\n Ten minutes later, Lin Ke, accompanied by a police droid, opened the door to Organ Cultivation Cabin 35. A horrifying, bloody stench assaulted her nose. As she realized what she was seeing, her view narrowed to an intense spasm as her chest tightened. Then, everything went dark as she fainted.\n Luo Ming was the first human police officer to arrive on the scene.\n Total chaos.\n Those were the first words that came to his mind. As he entered Cabin 35, he had a hard time imagining what the mountain of flesh and blood he was seeing used to look like.\n \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d He regretted not donning a filtration mask before coming in. He lowered his voice as he spoke to his \u201cassistant\u201d Edmund, an AI that was invisible to the naked eye. Edmund was his most dependable companion.\n \u201cMs. Lin Ke, who filed the police report, suffered a heart attack from shock and is now being treated in the hospital.\u201d Edmund\u2019s voice emitted from a speaker inside his ear. \u201cShe complained that the cultivators breached their contract and canceled her order.\u201d\n At a loss, Luo Ming said, \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at a lot more than a breach of contract here.\u201d\n Viscous blood was still seeping onto the immaculate white floor from a pile of organs three meters in diameter. In some places, the blood had already congealed into a pitch-black patch. Some organs in the outermost layer of the meter-tall flesh pile still looked fresh; a few were even twitching and wriggling\u2014the rotting smell in the air had to be coming from something deeper inside the pile.\n As he imagined what the inside might look like, Luo Ming felt his scalp tingling. \u201cWe\u2019d better make sure that there are only cultivated organs here. God forbid that this mess is hiding a murder scene.\u201d Luo Ming commanded Edmund to scan the room. Edmund took control of the police droid via the wireless remote, overriding the droid\u2019s visual system to complete his assigned task.\n \u201cI\u2019m always a little unsettled by how easily you take control of them,\u201d Luo Ming muttered. He could, of course, issue commands to the police droid directly, but then he would have to waste time organizing and analyzing the raw data himself.\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t grumble about your misgivings concerning AIs to me,\u201d Edmund replied. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve found something that\u2019s even more unsettling.\u201d\n While Luo Ming had been griping, the scan revealed that two arms and half a head were also buried within the mountain of organs. The Adam matrix absolutely could not have created those three body parts.\n \u201cAlright, looks like we\u2019ve just added a dismembered corpse to the case,\u201d Luo Ming said, sighing. \u201cThe Eden Daily is going to have a field day with this.\u201d\n Luo Ming had Edmund scan and record the details of the scene in the cabin; then, he answered First Officer Qin Wei\u2019s videocall. Qin Wei was the spaceship Eden\u2019s head of security.\n \u201cThis is perhaps the worst case I\u2019ve seen on my one hundred and three years aboard this ship.\u201d As Luo Ming spoke, his gaze fell on a pair of human eyes that dangled from the ceiling. His voice shook. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019d better come take a look.\u201d\n 2. Echidna\n And in a hollow cave she bore another monster, irresistible, in no wise like either to mortal men or to the undying gods, even the goddess fierce Echidna who is half a nymph with glancing eyes and fair cheeks, and half again a huge snake, great and awful, with speckled skin, eating raw flesh beneath the secret parts of the holy earth.\n \u2014Hesiod, Theogony 300-305 (as translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White)\n \u201cExcuse me, are you\u2014\u201d After observing me for twenty minutes, the woman beside me asks timidly, \u201cTyphon\u2019s lead singer Evan Lee?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d All that feels like a past life.\n She blurts out an apology and follows up with, \u201cYou really look like him.\u201d\n I channel all the cold disinterest I can muster into my voice. \u201cIs that so.\u201d\n So ends that conversation. The flight attendant soon comes around with drinks. I ask for a glass of wine, followed by another. The cramped economy seat constricts my body, and terrifying words throw heavy shackles on my mind: \u201cfather,\u201d \u201cresponsibility,\u201d and so on.\n When I was still Evan Lee, my days of pleasure and riches seemed endless\u2014until she left me, taking with her half of my possessions and all of my musical inspiration.\n For a long time after our separation, I constantly thought of her, analyzed her, studied her. I flipped through old tabloids, gathered paparazzi gossip, replayed our wedding video again and again to pick up each of her frowns and smiles, and examined every picture and recording of all the times she appeared with me to support my publicity efforts. During that darkest period of my life, these were the best benefits from my once-great fame\u2014plenty of materials for me to study. And so, bit by bit, I got close to the monster beneath her perfect shell, the serpent-half concealed beneath her beautiful appearance. But there was one part of our life together that I could never understand.\n Her pregnancy.\n The pregnancy happened only because it was part of her plan. During the first three years of our marriage, I told her many times that I wanted a child, but she would always brush me off with a \u201cno need to rush,\u201d plus a session of hot sex. When she decided it was time, she didn\u2019t think to discuss the decision with me at all.\n \u201cEvan, guess what?\u201d That was the first night after the end of my tour. When I opened the door to our home, a festive atmosphere greeted me.\n \u201cWhat kind of surprise does my little sweetheart have?\u201d I cupped her neck and kissed her lips.\n \u201cA baby.\u201d She laughed, her eyes curving with joy. \u201cDarling, we\u2019re going to have a baby!\u201d\n I was stunned. After three years of begging, I had all but given up on the idea.\n \u201cIt\u2019s already three months old.\u201d She put my hand on her flat stomach. \u201cRight here.\u201d\n My palm detected absolutely no movement, but, in that moment, the word \u201cfather\u201d entered my mind. Every cell of my being filled with joy. Two months later, Typhon released its last single, \u201cFire by Lightning.\u201d Music critics felt that its \u201cevery note was imbued with love and joy.\u201d Then, on the day our hit single won the Golden Melody Award, my wife changed in a way that I never could have imagined.\n On that day, her labmate called me and said that she had suffered a nervous breakdown.\n Impossible. My wife\u2014for whom even an \u201coff mood\u201d was rare\u2014had suffered a nervous breakdown?\n Nothing like this had ever happened before. I rushed to campus. Her laboratory was at the end of a boulevard shaded with trees. The rows of Chinese parasol trees had already shed their leaves, leaving behind only branches full of round, dangling fruits. As I walked into that red-brick building, one of her students recognized me.\n \u201cMr. Lee, finally!\u201d His expression was a mixture of agitation, worry, and curiosity, but he prudently suppressed his emotions under a veneer of politeness. \u201cI\u2019m Edmund. She\u2019s in the third-floor animal room. You should hurry.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Edmund,\u201d I said in a rush.\n Although the campus was where we first met, that was actually my first time in her lab. The sparkling floor was like a hospital\u2019s; there were rows and rows of metal shelves, each neatly packed with plastic cages connected to a central ventilation system. This room must\u2019ve held a thousand, no, ten thousand rats!\n I found her behind the shelves full of rats. She was cradling her head as she crouched in a corner, her hair a mess, her shoulders shuddering, but her cries were inaudible.\n \u201cHoney\u2014\u201d Seeing her like this frightened me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n The moment my hand touched her, she let out a screech. I stepped back. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t touch you. What happened?\u201d\n Slowly, she raised her head. I had never before seen such panic in her eyes. Her parted lips trembled, but a long time passed before she uttered my name: \u201cEvan.\u201d\n \u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d I chastised myself. \u201cI should\u2019ve held you back; I shouldn\u2019t have let you go to work. The baby\u2019s already almost six months old\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t bring it up! Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAlright, we won\u2019t talk about the baby.\u201d I reached out and tried to get close to her. Her whole body trembled, as though she were struggling to escape. Defeated, I could only call upon my own specialty: \u201cHoney, let\u2019s sing \u2018Titans\u2019 together, okay?\u201d\n She stopped struggling and looked at me blankly, like a helpless child.\n \u201cA singer in the wilderness, recounting tales of the gods . . .\u201d\n It was a gentle song, and also her favorite melody. I sang as softly as I could, so soft the words were almost inaudible. Music turned out to be more effective than language. She listened until I was halfway through the song, sniffled, then threw herself into my arms and sobbed. I stroked her messy hair and tried to soothe her terrified shivers.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay; I\u2019m here.\u201d\n She slumped against my chest and, with great effort, uttered a few disconnected phrases: \u201cIt\u2019s a . . . parasitic . . . parasitic . . . monster . . . \u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want the baby. Evan, I don\u2019t want that parasite inside my body!\u201d\n Shocked, I asked, \u201cWhat happened? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n She wiped her nose on my sleeve. Finally, she could speak in complete sentences. \u201cThe baby is taking over my life; it\u2019s a parasite in my body. It\u2019s controlling my thoughts, commanding me to eat what it wants to eat, telling me to go where it wants to go, demanding I do what it wants to do. It\u2019s a parasitic monster in my body, a monster! It\u2019s devouring me, do you understand? I can\u2019t control myself anymore! I can\u2019t stop myself from thinking about it! I can\u2019t focus on what I want to do. I can\u2019t understand my own notes. I don\u2019t care about my papers, either. The only thing in my mind is how I can make it feel more comfortable! I\u2019ve been possessed by it; it\u2019s already wormed its way into my brain\u2014do you understand?\u201d\n I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cMy silly girl; this is a normal reaction to pregnancy. It\u2019s because you love the baby\u2014our baby.\u201d\n \u201cNo!\u201d She stared at me with alarm. \u201cThis is absolutely not normal! Not normal at all! You just don\u2019t get it because it hasn\u2019t possessed your body!\u201d\n I held back my laughter and said as sincerely as I could, \u201cIf it were possible, I would bear the baby for you, but I can\u2019t. Chin up; you\u2019re a mother now.\u201d\n She stopped crying. For a few seconds, she stared at me in an unfamiliar way, as though I were the one who had lost my mind. But she soon became her usual self again. She wiped her eyes with her sleeve, then looked up and giggled sheepishly. \u201cOh goodness, I really did go nuts today.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a very common anxiety, honey.\u201d\n She leaned against my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re right. These are normal feelings for a new mother. I need to get used to them.\u201d\n In the months that followed, there were a couple more incidents in which she was dejected and depressed, but there were no more episodes as intense as the one in the lab.\n But I started to be more vigilant, canceling a new tour so that I could spend more time with her. Around the 39th week of her pregnancy, I stumbled upon a file in her computer that recorded in detail the \u201cconversations\u201d she had with her unborn baby: when she went to the restroom, dreams, favorite foods and kinds of music\u2014all trivial things. Reading these notes, I began to understand what she said that day in the lab. The things she noted were not her own habits or tastes, but someone else\u2019s.\n The baby growing inside her was using her body to do what it wanted to do. Once she realized this, she was terrified.\n If she had been a typical mother, perhaps she would have used \u201clove\u201d to explain her behavior. But she couldn\u2019t do that. Emotions to her are a kind of camouflage, something to let her blend in with others. So she could only understand everything from the baby\u2019s perspective: this was a monster that had possessed her body and taken control of her so that it could survive inside her.\n Maybe the plane\u2019s air conditioning is too cold, but suddenly, I shiver. I never thought I\u2019d come to understand why she\u2019d abandon her own child: If she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d always be under Tony\u2019s control, forced to give up on having her own life\u2014just as I have.\n \u201cPlease fasten your seatbelt, Mr. Lee,\u201d the flight attendant says. \u201cWe\u2019re about to land.\u201d\n As we descend, a city surrounded by an oasis blooms in the vast expanse of desert outside.\n B. Eden\n After completing a genetic survey of the scene, Luo Ming received Edmund\u2019s interim report: the limbs and head in Organ Cultivation Cabin 35 belonged to three deceased passengers. Terminal illness was unquestionably the cause of all three deaths; furthermore, they had all chosen to donate their bodies to science to advance research on those illnesses. Edmund\u2019s discovery allowed Luo Ming to unfurrow his brows just a bit.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not murder,\u201d he said to First Officer Qin Wei, who had rushed to the scene. \u201cThat\u2019s good news at least.\u201d\n Like Luo Ming and the majority of the passengers aboard Eden, Qin Wei was close to a hundred fifty years old. He had just gotten a scalp replacement: only an infant-like layer of fine hair covered the top of his head, lending a comical air to his overall appearance.\n \u201cThank goodness.\u201d Qin Wei was distracted, and he muttered as though to himself, \u201cBut . . . how\u2019d these limbs even get here?\u201d\n \u201cThe body parts should have been sent to the medical research center under Deck Seven,\u201d Luo Ming said.\n \u201cShould have been, yes.\u201d Only now did Qin Wei look at Luo Ming. \u201cThe organ cultivation cabins are the most heavily monitored and secure part of this spaceship. For something like this to happen is unbelievable. You might not know this\u2014even the police don\u2019t have the clearance to view documentation about Adam.\u201d\n \u201cSharing such information could greatly help my investigation.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Officer Luo, but those documents involve classified information about the very heart of Eden,\u201d Qin Wei said. \u201cSince there aren\u2019t any suspected murders, I\u2019d say this investigation has come to an end. Why don\u2019t you let me and the Adam overseers tie up any loose ends?\u201d\n Luo Ming read between the lines. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that this is just an ordinary accident?\u201d\n Qin Wei smiled noncommittally. \u201cThe ship has experienced severe organ cultivation failures before, you know? Malfunctions in the cabin\u2019s temperature control.\u201d\n Luo Ming studied his expression and let out a small sigh. \u201cAlright, sir, I understand.\u201d\n Only a day later, as he sat in his office, Luo Ming received an info packet from Edmund concerning Adam.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a genius.\u201d Luo Ming sighed with approval and opened the document. As the unredacted details filled his view, Luo Ming gasped. \u201cThis ship\u2019s security system must have serious flaws for such classified data to be so easily accessible.\u201d\n \u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s your fault for illicitly bringing an AI aboard, hmm?\u201d Edmund\u2019s voice was a cross between pride and smug derision.\n \u201cWell, no one\u2019s discovered you over all these years.\u201d Edmund was a gift Luo Ming had received a long time ago, and after years of working and living together, he had found the AI indispensable. Even after hearing about Eden\u2019s ban on AIs, Luo Ming still chose to implant the terminal into his body and smuggle Edmund aboard the spaceship.\n \u201cThat\u2019s because the intelligence systems here are far too primitive,\u201d Edmund said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need to worry about the security of the ship. Its core systems are sealed off from outside networks. I haven\u2019t found a single entry point.\u201d\n Luo Ming nodded and returned his attention to the documents. It appeared that Eden was actually a research vessel that provided replacement organs for its several hundred thousand passengers, allowing them to extend their lives indefinitely. At the same time, it transmitted the residents\u2019 health data back to Earth, so that people back home could learn first-hand about potential complications from a large-scale organ replacement program. Eden followed a comet\u2019s orbit in the Solar System so that its path crossed with the Earth\u2019s once every four years, allowing the ship to dock at a space station and exchange both personnel and information.\n \u201cI always thought we were heading away from the Solar System,\u201d said a surprised Luo Ming. \u201cAnd nobody ever told me we could leave the ship!\u201d\n Edmund said, \u201cLooks like they\u2019d gone to a lot of trouble to hide the truth and prevent you all from discovering that you\u2019re actually laboratory mice.\u201d\n In light of this new-found knowledge, the organ cultivation cabins really were the soul of Eden. They were often called \u201cAdam\u201d chambers, after that figure from Christian lore who used his own rib to create humanity\u2019s other ancestor. But, to be more precise, every mucous membrane pouch in the organ cultivation cabins that bore a human organ\u2014those were all Adams. They were distinct, each carrying different passengers\u2019 genes, cultivating different organs.\n When Eden was first designed, the Adams were separated from one another. But, as time passed, the Adam overseers discovered a strange phenomenon: after a few Adams began cultivation inside the same room, cells would start growing along the feeding tracts until all the Adams were connected to each other.\n However, this connection did not delay or corrupt the growing organs; rather, organ cultivation in all the Adams became more efficient as organ maturation time decreased. Some researchers believed that this \u201cgenetic networking\u201d created a system among the Adams for exchanging growth signals and hormones, accelerating organ development.\n As a result, when the cultivation cabins were renovated forty years ago, the overseers installed passages that allowed all the Adams to connect to each other, resulting in an awe-inspiring effect\u2014while each passenger\u2019s genome was still preserved as separate and complete, the vast majority of organ cultivation times were cut by at least half. Even the development time for lungs, the slowest organ to cultivate, was cut down by a third.\n \u201cI still don\u2019t understand what any of this has to do with our case.\u201d Luo Ming felt agitated. \u201cI keep feeling like we missed something at the scene.\u201d\n \u201cI recorded a complete scan of the room,\u201d Edmund said.\n \u201cPerhaps\u2014\u201d Luo Ming pondered. \u201cThe problem may not only be inside the cultivation cabin.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cDo you remember the dispute between the woman who filed the report and the Adam overseer?\u201d Luo Ming asked.\n \u201cThe hospital\u2019s notification system showed that Ms. Lin Ke\u2019s order for a heart had been canceled, whereas Adam\u2019s monitoring platform showed that everything was fine.\u201d\n \u201cRight,\u201d Luo Ming said. \u201cAdam\u2019s system should be much more secure than the hospital\u2019s, yet the cultivation cabin overseer didn\u2019t know the true state of Cabin 35. Why is that?\u201d\n \u201cCould it be that Adam\u2019s overseers were trying to conceal the mess inside?\u201d Edmund asked.\n \u201cMaybe. But we can\u2019t rule out another possibility: none of those in charge, including the first officer and the cultivation cabin overseers, have any idea what really happened.\u201d Luo Ming put the recording of Lin Ke arguing with the overseer on the display. \u201cWatch the man\u2019s expression\u2014the surprise is genuine.\u201d\n \u201cTrue, as I can confirm with microexpression analysis,\u201d Edmund said.\n \u201cBased on the scene we observed, it\u2019s very likely that what happened to Lin Ke wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. But she was the only one who felt strongly enough to make a report to the police, and who went to open the door to Cabin 35. That\u2019s in the contract, but it looks like passengers only exercised their right to examine the cabins during the early years of the ship\u2019s journey.\u201d\n \u201cAre you suggesting that all the organs we saw on the ground had their orders canceled?\u201d\n Luo Ming\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWe might as well follow this lead. Edmund, can you break into the databases for both the cultivation cabins and the hospital and pick out all relevant records? It\u2019s possible that there are discrepancies between the two systems\u2014those would be the organs we saw in Cabin 35.\u201d\n \u201cYou really know how to come up with hard problems for me.\u201d Despite these words, Edmund sounded delighted. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d\n 3. Typhon\n From his shoulders grew a hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flickering tongues, and from under the brows of his eyes in his marvelous heads flashed fire, and fire burned from his heads as he glared. And there were voices in all his dreadful heads which uttered every kind of sound unspeakable; for at one time they made sounds such that the gods understood, but at another, the noise of a bull bellowing aloud in proud ungovernable fury; and at another, the sound of a lion, relentless of heart; and at another, sounds like whelps, wonderful to hear.\n \u2014Hesiod, Theogony 820-835 (as translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White)\n Nine years later, I find myself in her laboratory again. Edmund has gone from an undergraduate to a doctoral student, but the way he looks at me hasn\u2019t changed in the least\u2014he\u2019s just like any other awe-struck fan. \u201cMr. Lee, the professor is waiting for you in the animal room.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Edmund.\u201d\n She doesn\u2019t notice when I enter. She\u2019s squatting beside a pig that has to be half a meter tall, all her attention focused on it as she laughs. She puts her cell phone on speaker, and music starts playing. It\u2019s my song, \u201cFire by Lightning.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I cradle it in my hands,The sun and moon tumble, stars fall.Go ahead and fight, destroy;The king of the gods\u2019 undying wish is in my hands.\u201d\n The pig dances to the music on its hind legs, clumsily twisting and rocking. Gradually, it catches up to the tempo. She stands with it and leans against a desk, laughing so hard she can\u2019t breathe. The pig faces her, dancing now with gusto, keeping up even better with the beat. It\u2019s unbelievable\u2014the pig is actually dancing to the brisk pace of the music.\n The song, now in an ornamental cadenza, switches tempo. The pig stumbles and tumbles to the ground, startling her. She falls to her knees by its prone body. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n The pig oinks in reply. Annoyed, she jabs its head with a finger, then says in the gentlest voice I\u2019ve ever heard, \u201cYou rascal, don\u2019t scare me like that.\u201d\n The pig\u2019s oinks are now laced with a hint of whining. She rubs its back. \u201cAlright, alright; it\u2019s okay, as long as you\u2019re not hurt.\u201d\n This is such a bizarre sight. I cough. She and the pig turn their heads simultaneously to look at me together\u2014an image I\u2019ll never forget.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Evan?\u201d She stands.\n It has Tony\u2019s eyes.\n She\u2019s never seen Tony, so she can\u2019t know. But the eyes in that one-and-a-half-year-old pig belong to Tony: light brown irises with a hint of gray. It\u2019s not just the eyes, but also something unnamable in their depths, something that sends chills down my spine, making me forget why I\u2019m here.\n It reminds me of how I felt the time I found myself in the middle of a stage, having forgotten everything about the song I was supposed to sing. The electric guitar\u2019s prelude was nothing but white noise, and my legs trembled in the flickering magnesium lights.\n \u201cDo you need a cup of coffee?\u201d She peers at me, concerned. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d\n \u201cCan we . . . talk . . . alone?\u201d Even if I performed at three back-to-back shows, my voice still wouldn\u2019t sound like this.\n \u201cI was just about to show you our pig,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s doing really well. Fantastic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n I catch its gaze again, and in that second, I feel my soul being torn apart.\n \u201cMy God!\u201d\n The pig stares at me as though it already knows its destiny: a wordless acquiescence to suffering, imbued with a fatalistic sense of tragedy. The last few times Tony underwent dialysis, he gazed at me with the exact same expression.\n \u201cOkay, Evan.\u201d She steps forward to hold my trembling hands. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else.\u201d\n We don\u2019t say a word on the way to her office. The afternoon sun dissipates all shadows in the spacious room. Edmund brings in two tiny, round cups. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, but then she doesn\u2019t say a word to me after Edmund leaves. The dappled shadows of tree leaves upon the desk lengthen. I take a sip of the now cold and bitter coffee. Finally, she breaks an afternoon\u2019s worth of silence.\n \u201cI thought you might want to take a look at the report.\u201d\n A thick file lands before me. I open it, my arms stiff. Inside are notes starting from when the pig was an embryo until now. I can only make sense of the pictures. From the outset, it\u2019s always smiled at the camera, if that joyous and eager expression can be called a \u201csmile\u201d\u2014but within the last month, it\u2019s ceased smiling. On the last page is a close up portrait of its eyes. Staring at them, I can barely tolerate the agitation in my stomach\u2014I throw the file to the ground.\n She stands and picks up the file, chuckling. \u201cGood thing I didn\u2019t give you a digital version, or else I\u2019d have to fill out a damaged equipment report now.\u201d\n \u201cHow could this be?\u201d I murmur.\n \u201cEvan, we have to face the facts.\u201d She lets out a soft sigh. \u201cThis is perhaps the best outcome: the pig is now in prime condition for organ donation\u2014if you were to ask me, this experiment went unusually smoothly. We found the right path from the very beginning, and we overcame every obstacle within the shortest possible time. I doubt you\u2019d find another instance in the history of science where the road to discovery was so smooth\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2014\u201d I interrupt her, but I\u2019m not sure what I should say.\n \u201cI\u2019ve already gotten in touch with my friend Dr. Sanger. He\u2019s the best kidney surgeon at the state hospital.\u201d Her tone is level and calm. \u201cI\u2019ve already sent him the pig\u2019s file. He\u2019s reviewed the data and thinks the surgery will be no more risky than a standard human-to-human transplant. Evan, I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still not satisfied.\u201d\n Only her last sentence betrays her suppressed anger, but it\u2019s enough to provoke all my terror and rage. I unlock my phone: the wallpaper is a picture of Tony staring innocently at me.\n \u201cEnough.\u201d I fling open the file and place my phone on top of the close up of the pig\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe both know where the problem is, right? Look at these eyes: they\u2019re exactly the same\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014as Tony\u2019s,\u201d she finishes. \u201cOf course I know. Those are Tony\u2019s eyes; the cells in that organ are human cells.\u201d\n I read the unspoken message from her face. \u201cAre you . . . are you saying there are human cells in other organs as well?\u201d\n \u201cYes . . . it\u2019s a bit hard to take. Its nervous system is almost entirely made up of human cells.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t be na\u00efve, Evan. We knew from the start that we couldn\u2019t control the degree of chimerization, but we went ahead anyway.\u201d\n \u201cThe nervous system?\u201d\n \u201cThe cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the spinal cord\u2014the vast majority of it,\u201d she says, enunciating each word, as if she\u2019s trying to engrave the words into my heart with her poisoned tongue. \u201cTo put it simply: our son is inside that pig.\u201d\n I\u2019ve never been so frightened, not even the time I saw Tony being pulled under that car. Back then, I was a father, but now, I\u2019ve become a criminal\u2014what in the world have we done? We\u2019ve melded our son with a pig, and now we\u2019re going to butcher it with our own hands!\n My silence allows her to relax her tone. \u201cSo long as I stay quiet, no one will know about this. These notes won\u2019t appear in my paper. The nervous system isn\u2019t the focus of this experiment, and it\u2019s not important for whether the experiment is declared a success. The kidneys are perfect, Evan. You don\u2019t have to worry about that at all.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not worried about that!\u201d Her forced composure is intolerable. \u201cKilling it is cruel\u2014it\u2019s wrong! Don\u2019t you realize that the pig knows what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d\n She smiles. \u201cEvan, what do you plan to do?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t been able to sleep for the last two weeks.\u201d Her voice is low. \u201cI keep thinking about whether you\u2019ve been trying get back at me with this pig. I abandoned Tony, so you thought up the cruelest of methods to reawaken my motherly instincts. I kept telling myself that this isn\u2019t Tony, that this isn\u2019t my son; I even refused to name it out of fear that doing so would humanize the animal. But it went beyond my imagination: out of all the researchers, it\u2019s closest to me; out of all the music we play for it, it only likes yours.\u201d\n Tony is the same way. From when he was a baby, as soon as he heard \u201cFire by Lightning,\u201d he\u2019d start dancing.\n She continues. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it: should we stop and let Tony succumb to his fate, thereby allowing the pig to live? But then I saw you, and I realized that we\u2019ve never had any choice but to go forward.\u201d\n Her gaze penetrates me to the root, and I, in turn, finally see the trembling that she\u2019s kept hidden inside. Her terror and pain are undoubtedly far sharper than mine: it\u2019s only because she\u2019s been ruminating on them for so long that she can bury them under a tranquil facade. I\u2019ve only glanced at the pig, but she\u2019s been raising it since it was a single cell.\n Of course we can\u2019t turn back. Tony continues to deteriorate, and everything her lab has invested into this pig can\u2019t be hidden from her supporters. I demanded that she cross the Rubicon; it\u2019s only reasonable that both of us should bear this heavy cross.\n \u201cRight.\u201d I force myself to forget the pig. \u201cTony hasn\u2019t been doing so well lately. I\u2019ll bring him here as soon as possible. Don\u2019t want to miss the best window for surgery.\u201d\n \u201cWe have an understanding then.\u201d She smiles, erasing all misgivings from her face. She opens her notebook and gives me Dr. Sanger\u2019s contact information as well as his CV. Then she tells me her own opinions and recommendations for the transplant surgery. Only after it\u2019s gone dark outside does she stop talking. \u201cYou should go,\u201d she reminds me. \u201cIf you leave now, you can still catch your flight.\u201d\n I get up, hesitating for a moment over whether to shake her hand in a sign of friendship and gratitude. But she\u2019s holding her hands together before her chest. I guess there\u2019s no such need.\n \u201cI\u2019m off then. Thank you,\u201d I say, my mouth dry.\n She laughs and shakes her head. \u201cEvan, Tony is my son too. Why are you saying \u2018thank you\u2019?\u201d\n \u201cAh, yes.\u201d I laugh too.\n We walk out of the laboratory together. The shadows of the trees pool together, enveloping the world in the stillness of night. I\u2019m about to say goodbye, but then she speaks.\n \u201cThe first time I saw you was over there, right?\u201d She whispers, \u201cThat day, you played such a gentle tune. Who\u2019d have thought that the song you\u2019d end up recording would be so wild?\u201d\n I know she\u2019s talking about \u201cTitans.\u201d The inspiration for the first phrase had come to me while I was performing at this school. That night, as though in the throes of a craving for some drug, I rushed around in search of a piano to bring the notes in my mind to life. I climbed through the window of my room and felt my way back to the locked auditorium, never realizing that there was another pair of ears outside listening.\n \u201cDetested by our forefathers,Buried deep, hidden from the sun,Scythe-wielding, throne-stealing, we bear curses and epithets.. . .We\u2019re destined to rebel,Smashing barriers, heedless of cost;Let smoke choke the air, let the earth burn to oblivion!\u201d\n She sings, only remembering some of the lyrics. She\u2019s also totally off-pitch, but I can\u2019t laugh as freely as I used to.\n She turns to look at me. \u201cNow that I think of it, your song was rather prophetic.\u201d\n In the end, she never went to the state hospital, nor did she show up at Tony\u2019s recovery party. For five years, she disappeared into her lab, cutting off contact with all her friends.\n I\u2019m shocked when she calls me out of the blue. She tells me that she would like me to set up a charitable foundation in Tony\u2019s name to support organ transplants for children. During the last five years, I had emailed her with such an idea, but all my messages had been returned as undeliverable. I immediately agree.\n Once the framework of the foundation is in place, I contact her again.\n \u201cI get the feeling that you\u2019re about to make a grand gesture,\u201d I say.\n \u201cI am,\u201d she replies. \u201cI reprogrammed the chimera gene regulation network and turned it into a blastocyst-like structure\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSorry,\u201d I interrupt her. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t understand all that.\u201d\n \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d She pauses, as though she were switching her linguistic module from scientific jargon to common. \u201cWe already have the capacity to produce human organs in a lab. I used existing chimeras to create a more stable structure; all you have to do is add new human cells, and it will create the corresponding organ.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic!\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll never allow it to look like a human being again.\u201d Her tone is exhausted.\n Simultaneously with the creation of the foundation, she publishes a series of papers on chimeras in Cell. Starting with the first human-pig chimera, she traces her groundbreaking work through the regenerative medicine lab. Overnight, she rocks the foundation of humanity\u2019s understanding of \u201clife.\u201d\n I buy that issue of Cell. The reviewers lavish her with praise: \u201cThis is a revolution for regenerative medicine, hinting at our near future: humanity will be able to swap out our organs as if they were interchangeable parts. We will live longer, maybe even forever.\u201d\n Criticism and debates follow soon after. Although a mother\u2019s pressing need to save her son\u2019s life is understandable, experimenting with human stem cells is nonetheless an ethical taboo.\n Her third paper pushes back against the torrent of attacks, laying out her model for the organ-cultivation matrix, which she names \u201cAdam.\u201d It resembles a small, square box filled with mucous membranes and doesn\u2019t look like a living creature at all.\n \u201cThe Adam technology won\u2019t encroach upon any ethical concerns,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cIt won\u2019t develop a human brain; it can\u2019t think; it has no feelings\u2014because we haven\u2019t provided it with any mechanisms for thoughts or feelings. The only thing it can do is use its own rib to save the people who need it.\u201d\n C. The Captain\n Luo Ming didn\u2019t really think that he could get in front of the captain of Eden based on just a letter\u2014though that was his plan.\n The woman before him had ashy white hair, wrinkled skin, and a hunched back; even sitting on the sofa seemed to take a lot out of her. Luo Ming was surprised by the captain\u2019s appearance. The women he knew prioritized external beauty, listing organs related to appearance at the front of their replacement queue.\n \u201cRegarding the incident in Cabin 35\u201d\u2014belying her appearance, the captain\u2019s voice was energetic\u2014\u201cI\u2019d like to hear your point of view.\u201d\n \u201cThe first officer has indicated that the incident is beyond my purview,\u201d Luo Ming said carefully, placing his hands before him.\n \u201cI actually think it\u2019s better to have a professional involved in the case.\u201d The captain gestured for Luo Ming to take the armchair before her. \u201cBut given the sensitive nature of the cultivation cabins, the results of the investigation should be kept confidential. That\u2019s not an issue for you, is it?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Luo Ming sat down. \u201cI assume you\u2019ve read my letter carefully?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cAs I mentioned, I believe this was no accident, but a premeditated crime.\u201d\n The captain dropped her gaze. \u201cYour theory is in conflict with the first officer\u2019s report.\u201d\n \u201cHaven\u2019t you summoned me here for another perspective?\u201d Luo Ming studied the captain\u2019s expression, then continued. \u201cI went over all the orders that the hospital\u2019s system canceled without explanation from the last three months. The total was over seven times the normal cancellation rate. I traced all the canceled organs to Cabin 35, but the monitoring system showed all the organs to be developing normally.\u201d\n \u201cAnd that\u2019s enough to convince you this wasn\u2019t an accident?\u201d the captain asked. \u201cMaybe the monitoring system is malfunctioning.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just the monitoring system, Your Excellency. Don\u2019t forget the cultivation cabin itself\u2014how did that pile of \u2018accidentally harvested\u2019 organs come to be? And we have no explanation for the discrepancy between the cultivation cabins\u2019 monitoring system and the hospital\u2019s order tracking system.\u201d\n The captain stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\n \u201cBefore coming to see you today, I wasn\u2019t too sure about my conclusions.\u201d Luo Ming smiled modestly. \u201cI originally suspected that the mismatch between orders was due to the overseers\u2019 efforts to hide the truth. But by summoning me, you\u2019ve told me that even you, the captain of this ship, aren\u2019t sure what exactly happened. That leaves us with only one other possibility: The Adam overseers did not know about the recent incident in Cabin 35. Thus, we can theorize that the monitoring system has been tampered with.\u201d\n \u201cI had First Officer Qin Wei examine the cultivation cabin monitoring system,\u201d the captain said, her gaze growing more intent. \u201cIt appears to have been modified with a \u2018green screen\u2019-like technology. Police droids entering and leaving the cultivation cabins would show up on the monitors as normal, but they\u2019d always appear against a background showing the interior of the Adam chambers functioning normally.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re saying that the recording was selectively tampered with? The images of the Adam cabins on the monitors never changed?\u201d\n \u201cNo, not \u2018never changed;\u2019 they showed as \u2018functioning normally.\u2019 On the monitors, you could see the organs growing as expected, and when orders were supposed to be fulfilled, they were \u2018harvested normally.\u2019\u201d The captain shook her head. \u201cThis method of tampering with the system is highly sophisticated.\u201d\n The captain\u2019s news deepened Luo Ming\u2019s puzzlement. \u201cBut this is what I can\u2019t figure out. If the entire incident was a premeditated crime, then the criminal already accomplished the most difficult step\u2014taking over Adam\u2019s high-security monitoring system. Yet they forgot to cover their tracks in the far more basic hospital systems.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a simple explanation for that: the criminal couldn\u2019t conjure the patients\u2019 requested organs out of thin air. They had no choice but to leave the orders alone and hope that patients would not exercise their right to examine the cultivation cabins.\u201d\n Luo Ming shook his head. \u201cBut they could have played any number of other tricks that would have worked better. For instance, they could have systematically delayed the order fulfillment dates for all the affected organs to prevent anyone from knowing what had happened. However, based on my review of the hospital\u2019s records, the doctors and patients only found out at the last minute that their orders had been delayed or canceled. The notices came through the hospital\u2019s regular organ reception channels, not Adam.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m now thoroughly confused.\u201d The captain furrowed her brow. \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\n \u201cFor someone who came up with such a complicated scheme\u2014going so far as to use a green screen to tamper with the monitoring records\u2014forgetting about the hospital\u2019s basic database is a very strange oversight. They clearly have the capability to break into the hospital\u2019s systems, but they didn\u2019t\u2014why not? One possibility is that they actually wanted to draw attention to what they did, but another possibility is that they didn\u2019t even know that the hospital\u2019s information platform existed.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d the captain said. \u201cEvery person aboard Eden knows about the hospital\u2019s organ replacement database.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, that\u2019s how it should be,\u201d Luo Ming said. \u201cBut there are always bound to be some people who don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a vague hunch. If you have a definite suspicion, say so.\u201d\n \u201cOn this ship, who wouldn\u2019t know about the existence of the hospital\u2019s organ replacement database? Or rather, who\u2019s never ordered an organ?\u201d Luo Ming looked at the captain. \u201cI hope you can help me gather a list of names. They\u2019re the primary suspects.\u201d\n The captain tapped the armrest with a wrinkled finger and chuckled coldly. \u201cThat\u2019s quite an accusation.\u201d She met Luo Ming\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve never replaced an organ.\u201d\n 4. Orthrus\n Men say that Typhaon (Typhon) the terrible, outrageous and lawless, was joined in love to her, the maid with glancing eyes. So she conceived and brought forth fierce offspring; first she bore Orthus the hound of Geryones . . . but Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans.\n \u2014Hesiod, Theogony, 304-335 (as translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White)\n Some legends say that it was actually Orthrus, and not Typhon, with whom Echidna conceived of those other monstrosities: Chimera and Sphinx.\n \u2014Anonymous\n The first time I see her is at my father\u2019s funeral.\n Although at least half of that crowd of tens of thousands have come to see her, I\u2019m the only one who picks her out. She\u2019s wearing a black silk dress, a diamond ring dangling from a string around her neck. Her face looks even younger than mine. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my practice at identifying faces or a natural instinct that makes me recognize her as my mother. Then, she sees me too.\n Five seconds later, I receive a direct message: \u201cI\u2019d like to chat after the funeral.\u201d\n I remember my father\u2019s last words to me as he lay dying: \u201cShe\u2019s your mother, and she gave you the gift of life twice\u2014be grateful.\u201d\n Once the crowd dissipates, I duck into her car. She enters Oslo Airport, Gardermoen as the destination and turns her seat around to face me.\n \u201cHello, Tony.\u201d\n I haven\u2019t been called that in years. After my parents created the Tony Lee Charitable Foundation, I had to change my name to protect my privacy and live a normal life.\n \u201cMom?\u201d It turns out to be easier to say than I thought. \u201cYou look so young.\u201d\n \u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d She laughs, then winks, as though we share a secret. \u201cI\u2019m conducting a new experiment to restore my cells to a more youthful state. It\u2019s a dangerous experiment, and we don\u2019t know all the side effects\u2014it\u2019s such a shame that I don\u2019t have another son to be the guinea pig this time.\u201d\n \u201cUm\u2014\u201d I have no idea what to say in response.\n \u201cOh, darling, I\u2019m just joking!\u201d She spreads her hands disarmingly. \u201cNow, tell me about your life. I hear that you\u2019re a police officer?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just a job.\u201d\n Her grin widens. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well. I noticed that you\u2019re dealing with AI crimes. Amazing.\u201d\n \u201cThe world changes so quickly. Scientists can\u2019t control everything they invent.\u201d I resent her tone: she\u2019s speaking as though she\u2019s always been a part of my life, exercising a mother\u2019s care.\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d She nods vigorously. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t understand our creations as much as we\u2019d like people to think.\u201d\n That\u2019s unexpected. \u201cReally?\u201d\n She doesn\u2019t answer, asking a question instead. \u201cWill you come to our press event? We\u2019re going to announce some important news.\u201d\n I\u2019ve heard about her research group\u2019s press event, scheduled for next month. After seven years of silence, everyone\u2019s dying to find out what she\u2019s going to say.\n \u201cThis could change the course of humanity.\u201d The car slows down. She glances out the window, then looks back at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there, of course.\u201d\n Her confidence irritates me. I am not my father, who was always so entranced by her. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not interested in it.\u201d\n \u201cBelieve me, darling, you will be interested.\u201d The car stops. She taps twice on her watch, and I receive an invitation as well as a packet of documents. \u201cThe thirteenth of next month. Be there.\u201d\n She holds my hand for a moment, then leaves for the airport. The midnight sun throws her black dress into sharp relief.\n Three hours and forty minutes later, the Airbus A400 she\u2019s on plunges into the sea.\n I end my vacation early to join the search and rescue effort, but the Baltic Sea has swallowed any trace of her. In the depths of the turbid waves, I see the wreckage of the plane.\n They say that there lies entombed humanity\u2019s wildest dream.\n The day the rescue efforts end, I receive another invitation to the press event.\n I\u2019ve run out of excuses. Heeding the call of fate, I set forth on a journey of more than ten thousand kilometers. On the plane, I look through the documents she gave me.\n There are pictures of a pig from when it was a piglet to when it was fully grown\u2014undoubtedly my savior. I transfer planes at Amsterdam and New York before arriving at a small town in the middle of the desert. My father once told me about this town: it\u2019s the birthplace of my kidneys.\n \u201cTony Lee,\u201d I say to the person who\u2019s here to meet me. The name is written on my invitation.\n Her mouth hangs open with exaggerated surprise. She lowers her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m Chen Ying. My condolences.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d\n I enter the auditorium to a hero\u2019s welcome. Everyone seems to recognize me: they surround me, chattering about my mother and my kidneys, but neither of these two topics feel real to me. Thankfully, the press event starts up soon after. The chattering ends as the lights dim, and everyone turns to look at the illuminated stage.\n \u201cWe will change the world once again.\u201d The middle-aged man on stage opens the ceremony with these words.\n The applause is enthusiastic. \u201cAlright, Edmund!\u201d\n Edmund is the chief scientist of my mother\u2019s medical research group\u2014he and my mother once won a Nobel together. After the applause dies down, he speaks again.\n \u201cIn the past thirty years, we\u2019ve accomplished the unimaginable. From chimera experiments to the first successful human organ cultivation, as well as the spread of regenerative medicine thereafter, we\u2019ve saved many people\u2019s lives\u2014but we\u2019ve also faced much opposition. The main objection has been: should we use humans as research subjects?\u201d\n Edmund picks me out of the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re honored to have Mr. Tony Lee among us today. The fact that he\u2019s healthy and alive is our answer.\u201d\n Thunderous applause and a blinding spotlight fall upon me together. The world goes white for a moment, and I can\u2019t see a thing.\n \u201cOur lab has never backed off from the effort to make our case to the public, but we\u2019ve always lacked a decisive argument for the moral rightness of allowing human experimentation.\u201d\n The spotlight eases away from me as Edmund continues, \u201cBut our latest discovery should finally settle this decades-long ethical dispute. First, let me introduce the youngest and most powerful member of our team: Mr. Sphinx, an avatar personifying our quantum computer.\u201d\n Rays of light gather at his fingertips and then scatter to form a human shape\u2014a powerful demonstration of the latest hologram technology. But given my profession, what draws my attention is the word \u201cavatar.\u201d After handling hundreds of AI-related crimes, I\u2019m leery of them, especially one taking advantage of quantum computing.\n Sphinx renders as a golden-skinned teen. Once the rays of light have condensed, I almost can\u2019t tell that he\u2019s a hologram. A shy smile appears on his face, perfectly calibrated to give the impression of innocence.\n \u201cGood evening, everyone. I have a riddle\u2014\u201d\n Laughing, Edmund interrupts him. \u201cLet me guess: \u2018What has four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?\u2019 Sphinx, everyone knows the answer: humanity.\u201d\n \u201cHumanity, yes. That riddle compares a lifetime to a day,\u201d Sphinx says. \u201cBut I have a different riddle for you.\u201d\n \u201cGo ahead. The best minds of the world are gathered here today.\u201d\n \u201cWhere did humanity come from? Before \u2018morning,\u2019 what happened in the darkness before dawn?\u201d\n \u201cEvolution, Sphinx. I taught you this,\u201d Edmund says, sighing.\n \u201cBut you must have proof,\u201d Sphinx says.\n \u201cWe have many fossils of Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.\u201d Edmund pauses. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n Sphinx takes over. \u201cBut, there is a gap in the fossil record. Until now, we have no direct evidence that modern humans, or Homo sapiens sapiens, evolved from the archaic Homo sapiens.\u201d\n \u201cBut you have no evidence to disprove that modern humans evolved from Homo sapiens, either,\u201d Edmund counters.\n \u201cNo, I do have proof. I know that humanity\u2019s ancestor is a chimera.\u201d\n For about ten seconds, Edmund is silent. Murmurs rise in the meeting hall.\n \u201cA chimera?\u201d Edmund says finally. \u201cWhat kind of joke is this?\u201d\n \u201cI never joke,\u201d Sphinx says. \u201cBefore the birth of quantum computers, calculating the product of two large prime numbers was very easy for classical computers, but figuring out the prime factors of a semiprime number, a natural number which is the product of two prime numbers, was practically impossible, making them useful for cryptography. After the creation of quantum computers, these early encryption technologies are no longer of use, as we can easily decrypt those methods using quantum algorithms. After adding me to the lab\u2019s research team, Edmund had a new idea\u2014he wanted me to factor humanity\u2019s DNA.\u201d\n \u201cIn other words, I wanted Sphinx to take one person\u2019s genome and separate it into their parents\u2019 genomes. It\u2019s a biologist\u2019s extension of quantum decryption.\u201d Edmund shrugs. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t expect was that Sphinx would actually be able to do it.\u201d\n Sphinx nods. \u201cYes, after continuous algorithmic improvements and experimental confirmation, I can ensure a very high degree of recoverability. That is, if I have the complete genome sequence for any one of you, I can figure out the genome sequences of all your ancestors. I can recover their skin color, blood type, hair and eye color\u2014give me enough time, and I can even recreate an ancestral human. With the support of medical databases from around the world, I quickly created a database of the genomes of humanity\u2019s ancestors.\u201d\n \u201cAs we factored human genomes,\u201d Edmund added, \u201cwe also attempted to factor the genomes of as many other species as possible, including mammals, reptiles, birds, insects, mollusks, and even plants\u2014a total of 115,000 species for which we now have an ancestral genomic database. In the end, we made an astounding discovery.\u201d\n The whole meeting hall is silent, enraptured.\n \u201cIn every species other than humans, there is a similar trajectory for the number of ancestors that contributed to the species\u2019 genome.\u201d Rays of light once again gather in Edmund\u2019s hand. \u201cObserve this graph\u2014the x-axis is the number of genetic specimens per time period, and the y-axis is time. As we go further up, we go further back in time.\n \u201cLet\u2019s start with puffins. As we go up in the time scale, we discover that, regardless of how long the population has remained stable, there is always a period where the population rapidly declines\u2014a \u2018bottleneck zone.\u2019\u201d\n The graph slowly rises in pace with Edmund\u2019s gesture and stops at the midway point to show an hourglass shape. \u201cWhat does this mean? At some point, for whatever reason, puffins died off in great numbers. The puffins we see now are descended from the few survivors of the bottleneck zone.\n \u201cIf we continue tracing back the population count of the puffins\u2019 ancestors, we discover a fascinating phenomenon: history repeats itself. Above the bottleneck zone is an expansion period, and above that, another bottleneck\u2014this goes on. We\u2019ve calculated the trajectories for 115,000 species over the past 500,000 years, and they are all the same.\n \u201cNow, let\u2019s take a look at the human population.\u201d\n Edmund waves his hand to the side. The human population graph rises up a bit, then quickly narrows to an almost invisible dot.\n \u201cA rather terrifying bottleneck, is it not?\u201d Edmund says. \u201cBut, when we go back from here\u2014\u201d\n He lifts his hand, but the graph doesn\u2019t rise with him. It stops there, towering, like the minaret of a mosque.\n \u201cWhat does this graph of humanity tell us? It tells us that, approximately 180,000 years ago, our common ancestor \u2018Mitochondrial Eve\u2019 gave birth to her children, and those children gave birth to more children, until human civilization dominated the globe.\u201d Edmund slows his speech. \u201cBut please take note: this graph also tells us that humanity can trace back to only one common ancestor.\u201d\n Sphinx breaks in, \u201cLet me remind you, one individual cannot proliferate the species.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, \u2018one\u2019 is neither accurate nor possible. We know now that, other than this woman, our common ancestors include four men as well. But regardless of how many people survived that bottleneck, how could something like this have happened? Sphinx\u2019s genome factoring analysis tells me that, before these ancestors, there were no ancestors.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Sphinx says.\n \u201cWas there a mistake in our calculations?\u201d Edmund says, \u201cBut we tested our calculations on fast-reproducing bacteria and generations of laboratory mice with detailed genetic records, and our algorithms were confirmed to be correct! Sphinx did not make any errors. Why, esteemed guests, why is it that we can trace the unbroken trajectories of 115,000 other species, but we can\u2019t do the same for humans? Before humanity\u2019s morning, what happened during the predawn darkness?\u201d\n Dead silence.\n Everyone looks up at the inconceivable graph. Judging by the introductions given to me earlier, this room is filled with the world\u2019s top scientists and doctors, a few politicians and business tycoons, as well as representatives from a number of influential media outlets. Everyone is trying to find a flaw in the graph, but no one speaks. \u201cChimera,\u201d the word that Sphinx said at the beginning of the presentation, floats like a ghost over our heads.\n \u201cWhen I, too, was at a loss like everyone here today, I called my mentor. After she listened to my description, she asked me only one question: \u2018Edmund, do you still remember that pig?\u2019\u201d\n Edmund looks at me. \u201cTony, do you still remember the pig that saved your life?\u201d\n Faint murmurs fill the hall.\n Edmund shakes his head. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t; but I do. I always thought that that pig was the first chimera with human cells. But I was wrong.\n \u201cI had Sphinx trace back a few other populations, those of the chimeras we\u2019ve been cultivating these past few decades. Although there aren\u2019t many chimera species, some rat-mouse chimeras have already reproduced over a hundred generations. What happens when we calculate the genomes of their ancestors?\u201d\n All of the graphs except for the human population graph disappear, replaced by the graphs of a few dozen chimera species. Like demons, the graphs climb upward, all terminating in a single point, some higher, some lower.\n \u201cThey are the same as humans\u2014these chimeras are the same as humans.\u201d Edmund pauses, then raises his voice. \u201cBut can we conclude from this that humans descended from a chimera? Of course not!\n \u201cI had Sphinx add to this model all of the Homo sapiens and Homo erectus genomes that we could find, leading to the discovery of one of our ancestors that shared a blood relationship with their ancestors.\n \u201cThis ancestor was not Eve\u2019s human husband, but rather the hybrid child she had with a Homo sapiens. We used quantum algorithms on this child\u2019s Homo sapiens genes to conduct a complicated \u2018subtraction.\u2019 Finally, we extracted the part of Eve\u2019s genome that did not include any DNA from Homo sapiens.\u201d\n Along with Sphinx, every point of light dissipates, then gathers into a huge double helix, one portion of which is highlighted in bright white.\n Edmund emphasizes every word as he concludes. \u201cWe are certain that this is a chimera\u2014a cross-species chimera.\u201d\n I close my eyes. A photo my mother sent me appears in my mind\u2019s eye. In the documents, that photo was perhaps the most nondescript one, bundled together with countless standard shots of the chimera pig in the research notes. It was a close-up shot of the pig\u2019s eyes.\n On the plane, I had glanced at it for maybe half a second, only to find that it had branded itself into my memories like a curse.\n Those were my eyes. It had my eyes.\n The hologram graphs disappear, leaving only Edmund on the stage.\n \u201cHumanity\u2019s common ancestor is a chimera. The foundation of all the ethical attacks and criticisms levied against us over the years has disintegrated. We have the evidence to prove that humanity was born in a laboratory. We are the product of science, not nature.\u201d\n Edmund\u2019s voice trembles with excitement. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have the technology to figure out what creatures were used to create humanity, and we can't tell who our creator was. But the success of chimeras and regenerative medicine tells us that we are only one step away from our Creator!\n \u201cSo what is there left to fear? Shall we boldly stride across this ethical barrier and let each person choose whether to join us, or shall we hesitate, timidly adhere to the fate of every other species on earth, and wait for the next bottleneck to return civilization to square one, or perhaps even to annihilation?\n \u201cEsteemed guests, I submit that we\u2019re at a crossroads of science and history: we must make a choice\u2014now is the time for full-scale human experimentation.\u201d\n The sound of scattered applause gradually swells to a thundering roar that fills the auditorium. Some in the crowd still wear expressions of doubt, but they\u2019re also full of admiration. From the birth of that pig, this town has been the battlefront of human genetic transformation. It\u2019s the holy site within the heart of every biologist and medical specialist. The announcement today has advanced the field again, perhaps even bringing humanity closer to a new world.\n It\u2019s too bad my mother isn\u2019t here to see this.\n Right at that moment, I receive a high-priority direct message. The sender\u2019s name makes my heart skip a beat.\n \u201cI\u2019d like to chat after the event.\u201d\n D. Cabin Zero\n \u201cEdmund?\u201d\n No answer.\n In the hundred years he\u2019d been together with his AI, nothing like this had ever happened before. Luo Ming looked around, then raised his voice: \u201cEdmund!\u201d\n His assistant finally appeared. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n Full of concern, Luo Ming asked, \u201cWhat did you find in the captain\u2019s cabin?\u201d\n Before meeting the captain, Luo Ming suddenly thought of a trick\u2014entering the captain\u2019s cabin would give him the opportunity to have Edmund break into the ship\u2019s core control systems, which were isolated from external networks. The AI would then be able steal all of the top-secret information there. The plan went smoothly until Luo Ming unexpectedly provoked the captain and was thrown out too soon.\n \u201cIt\u2019s true: the captain has never replaced an organ,\u201d Edmund said. \u201cShe was using prolonged hibernation to delay the aging process. The ship can awaken her in fifteen seconds, so there\u2019s no impact on the ship\u2019s normal operations.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care about that,\u201d Luo Ming said. \u201cWhat else did you find?\u201d\n \u201cI only had time to gather some population data. There are 29,000 people aboard who haven\u2019t undergone organ replacement surgery. The vast majority are young people under the age of 30. Only 15 are over 50 years old; above 80, only the captain. But she couldn\u2019t have been the criminal because she\u2019d been in deep sleep for the past month, and wasn\u2019t awakened until after the incident had occurred.\u201d\n \u201cThen it seems we\u2019ve reached a dead end here, too,\u201d Luo Ming said, sighing.\n \u201cDo you still think that the criminal is a \u2018person\u2019?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re the only AI aboard this ship,\u201d Luo Ming said. \u201cIf you did it, now would be a good time to confess.\u201d\n Edmund\u2019s voice lowered. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible joke. I have no way to clear my own name.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Luo Ming said, backpedaling. \u201cIt was . . . a terrible joke.\u201d\n \u201cI know; I\u2019ve already forgiven you,\u201d Edmund said. \u201cBut I have indeed run into a bit of trouble.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Luo Ming turned and saw First Officer Qin Wei walking toward him with a couple of police droids.\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid that when I broke into the ship\u2019s control system, the captain discovered me,\u201d Edmund said apologetically.\n \u201cDammit!\u201d Luo Ming furrowed his brow. \u201cHow can I turn you off?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s too late. A part of my data was left behind in the captain\u2019s cabin. By now, she probably knows everything about you.\u201d Edmund hesitated. \u201cFor example, your other name.\u201d\n For the first time, Luo Ming wished that Edmund had a physical form, so that he could give him the evil eye\u2014both his \u201cartificial\u201d nature and his \u201cintelligence\u201d could learn to take secrecy more seriously.\n But he didn\u2019t have time to scold the AI; Qin Wei was already standing before him. \u201cMr. Luo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to come with us.\u201d\n \u201cWhat for?\u201d Luo Ming asked, his face impassive.\n \u201cThere have been additional incidents involving Adam,\u201d Qin Wei said, his rapid speech revealing his unease. \u201cI need your help.\u201d\n Luo Ming let out a held breath. \u201cI would be happy to assist you, Mr. First Officer. But I recall that information concerning Adam is beyond my clearance level.\u201d\n Qin Wei snapped his fingers: an enormous file suddenly filled Luo Ming\u2019s inbox. Coldly, Qin Wei said, \u201cYou\u2019re cleared now.\u201d He turned and walked away.\n Luo Ming rushed to catch up. Summoning every ounce of sincerity, he said, \u201cPlease tell me what happened.\u201d\n Qin Wei\u2019s expression softened. \u201cI\u2019ll be brief: the other organ cultivation cabins all followed Cabin 35\u2019s example. Our orders have been canceled en masse, and the hospital is paralyzed. The captain has declared a state of emergency.\u201d\n As he spoke, he sent more files to Luo Ming. The documents included a three-dimensional cultivation cabin model that even Edmund hadn\u2019t been able to find. According to these documents, the oval Deck Seven was the site for hundreds of linked cultivation cabins, which formed an inward spiral like a whirlpool.\n Luo Ming recalled what Edmund had said earlier. \u201cDo these cultivation cabins communicate with each other?\u201d\n \u201cThey share the same feeding ducts, so, theoretically, they\u2019re not isolated from one another.\u201d Qin Wei was now fully cooperating.\n Luo Ming mulled over Qin Wei\u2019s response. Five minutes later, they arrived at the security line before Deck Seven. The white-haired captain stood amidst a crowd of police droids. She saw Luo Ming and made an unhappy face as she asked Qin Wei, \u201cWhy did you bring him here?\u201d\n \u201cLuo Ming is the officer in charge of this investigation, Your Excellency,\u201d Qin Wei replied simply.\n The captain scrutinized Luo Ming. Luo Ming avoided her gaze and examined the scene instead. \u201cEdmund,\u201d Luo Ming said softly, \u201cwasn\u2019t there something within the documents you sent that said one of the cultivation cabins is dedicated to the nervous system?\u201d\n No response. Edmund had disappeared completely. Luo Ming had no choice but to ask Qin Wei the same question.\n Qin Wei\u2019s answer was quick: \u201cCabin Zero. Though it\u2019s not a cultivation cabin; rather, it\u2019s a conservation cabin that preserves a few exceptional brains.\u201d\n \u201cI thought brains were on the list of organs that can\u2019t be replaced.\u201d\n \u201cRight.\u201d Qin Wei gave him an odd look. \u201cThe brains grown in Adams have no memories. Replacing the brain would turn a patient into a mindless fool . . . who would do that?\u201d\n A terrible chill ran up his spine. Luo Ming felt himself getting close to the answer. \u201cThen the ones in Cabin Zero are\u2014\u201d\n Qin Wei hesitated, but still replied. \u201cOn their deathbeds, some important individuals chose to deposit their brains here. We adjusted the genetic expression modules of the Adams inside Cabin Zero so that they would age extremely slowly.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that though the bodies of these people have died, their minds live on.\u201d\n \u201cTheir minds are in deep sleep.\u201d Qin Wei was growing impatient. \u201cWhy are you asking this?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d like to take a look at Cabin Zero.\u201d\n \u201cCabin Zero is perfectly fine.\u201d Qin Wei eyed him suspiciously. \u201cThe captain herself confirmed that.\u201d\n Luo Ming persisted: \u201cLast time, you and the captain also thought everything was perfectly fine.\u201d He noted Qin Wei\u2019s expression, then added, \u201cI\u2019m concerned that things are deteriorating faster than we imagined.\u201d\n As things really did seem to be getting out of hand, Qin Wei finally agreed to Luo Ming\u2019s request. Cabin Zero was on the lower part of Deck Seven, at the center of the whirlpool of cultivation cabins. When the cabin doors opened, Luo Ming was met with an unbelievable sight.\n Sacks made of translucent membrane dangled from the ceiling, each holding a spinal cord or a cerebrum. Between the Adam pouches, additional membranes had already enveloped all the interconnecting passageways, creating an actual web\u2014a three-dimensional network made of neurons, spinal cords, and lumps of cerebral tissue. Two \u201cpeople\u201d were laid out neatly on the ground: the first a complete body\u2014clean, naked, cold; the second a bulging sack of human skin, whose open abdomen revealed a heap of organs arranged in neat order: large intestines, stomach, liver . . .\n It wasn\u2019t a human at all, but a pile of human parts.\n \u201cMy God, what in the world\u2014\u201d Qin Wei murmured.\n Luo Ming put on a pair of gloves and carefully peeled back the skin covering the loose organs. Where the thoracic cavity should have been, there was only a ghastly segment of gleaming white bone.\n \u201cThat\u2019s his rib\u2014Adam\u2019s rib,\u201d Luo Ming blurted. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to create an Eve.\u201d\n 5. Argus\n And [Hera] set a watcher upon [Io], great and strong Argus, who with four eyes looks every way. And the goddess stirred in him unwearying strength: sleep never fell upon his eyes; but he kept sure watch always.\n \u2014Hesiod, Aegimius (as translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White)\n It is said, too, that Echidna, daughter of Tartarus and Earth, who used to carry off passers-by, was caught asleep and slain by Argus.\n \u2014Apollodorus, Bibliotheca, 2.1.2 (as translated by Sir James George Frazer)\n When I see her again, I begin to understand why my father was so madly in love with her.\n She can\u2019t be controlled, can\u2019t be known, can\u2019t be predicted. But when she\u2019s standing before me, she\u2019s thoughtful and warm. This contradiction allows her to exude allure like a demon. She\u2019s sitting on a black Barcelona chair now, her face pale and wan like a girl\u2019s. Her gaze falls upon me and she laughs weakly. \u201cTony, I\u2019m so sorry that I didn\u2019t tell you earlier\u2014did I worry you?\u201d\n Neither \u201cyes\u201d nor \u201cno\u201d would do\u2014both would reveal me as a hypocrite. So I say, \u201cI helped out with the rescue effort. I\u2019m overjoyed to see you\u2019re alive and well.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I was at Gardermoen Airport, I realized something was wrong with my body, so I borrowed a friend\u2019s plane to get back to the laboratory more quickly.\u201d Her speech is deliberate, slow. \u201cThen I discovered that nothing could be done about my problem, and so I just let the world think I was in the crash.\u201d\n Anxious, I ask, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m going to die soon.\u201d She looks at me, unperturbed. \u201cFor ten years, I\u2019ve been exploring the potential of genetic modification. I thought I had resolved the entire genetic network, but I was wrong.\u201d\n I don\u2019t know what to say.\n Warmly, she tells me, \u201cSee, this is science. Most of the time, we aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d\n \u201cMom\u2014\u201d\n \u201cMy failure has led me to make some adjustments to my future plans. We have to face the risks inherent in large-scale experimentation. I got in touch with a friend who\u2019s investing in an interstellar colonization program.\u201d She makes a call, and a hologram of a person appears before us. \u201cChen Ying, this is Tony. I believe you\u2019ve already met.\u201d\n The woman is the one who had come to meet me at the airport on the day of Sphinx\u2019s announcement.\n Chen Ying ignores me completely. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n \u201cTerrible,\u201d says my mother. Then she looks at me again. \u201cTony, Chen Ying is one of the wealthiest people on Earth, but most people know nothing about her. I\u2019m trying to convince her to lend me two of her five colonization ships for a few hundred years to use as research vessels.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve already agreed.\u201d Chen Ying furrows her brow as she looks at her.\n \u201cRight, but you haven\u2019t heard the actual plan yet. I\u2019d like to put them on the same orbit as a short-period comet\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not important,\u201d Chen Ying says, interrupting her. \u201cSend these details to the technicians; you need your rest now.\u201d\n My mother makes a face. \u201cAlright.\u201d Then, she ends the call.\n The brief conversation leaves me with an impression of intimacy. Maybe it wasn\u2019t so much the topic of the conversation as it was Chen Ying\u2019s expressions. My mother senses my questions, but she doesn\u2019t answer them. \u201cI\u2019m going to move the next-generation chimera lab onto the spaceships. That way, I don\u2019t have to worry about the catastrophic consequences in the event of an accident in a terrestrial genetic lab. Eden is my first ship, which will conduct more conservative research. The chimeras she carries come from the first generation of stem cells\u2014that is, part of them comes from you.\u201d\n I remember the pig\u2019s eyes.\n She continues: \u201cWe\u2019ve been cultivating these cells for many years. Strangely, although we\u2019ve tried to use other human cells and cells from other animals, this combination has always been the most stable. I guess we stumbled on a miracle with my first trial. Tony, you and I are both very lucky.\u201d She realizes my mind is wandering and changes the topic. \u201cSpeaking of which, what did you think of the big announcement?\u201d\n I think over the commentary from the last few days. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, this hypothesis still has some holes . . . \u201d\n \u201cI left them on purpose.\u201d She gives me a cunning grin. \u201cI just wanted to get everyone arguing, even start a war within science\u2014only then can there be a revolution.\u201d\n \u201cBut you seem to be losing.\u201d\n \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand people.\u201d She touches a finger to her chin. \u201cOnly through conflict can people have choices; only then can we rouse people\u2019s emotions, even whip them into a frenzy. As the flames of war expand, the news will spread farther. More and more will join the battle, creating more soldiers for me. Only then will I stand forth to protect my believers, dealing a deadly blow to the opposition.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re already holding the weapon for dealing that blow, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cNot only that, Tony,\u201d she says gently. \u201cAll of this is a trap I\u2019ve set to distract them from the real question.\u201d\n \u201cThe real question?\u201d\n \u201cWhat we announced at the event has nothing to do with the research I want to conduct. The interesting question has never been whether we can use humans as test subjects. I\u2019ve long trodden in that forbidden territory, starting from when you were six. The far more interesting question is: What have we created through these experiments?\u201d\n \u201cChimeras.\u201d\n \u201cChimeras, sure.\u201d She nods. \u201cBut what exactly are chimeras\u2014people or beasts? Do chimeras have thoughts? Can they reproduce with other chimeras? Are chimeras the path forward for human evolution or humanity\u2019s downfall?\n \u201cThese are my fatal weaknesses because I don\u2019t know the answers. From the very beginning, I didn\u2019t understand why the chimera experiments were successful. I was like a child playing with clay, rolling various colors together until they turned into something new.\n \u201cBut I won\u2019t tell people that I don\u2019t know the answers. I\u2019ll let them stare at an irrelevant chimera ancestor, a point of controversy where I hold in my hands all evidence, where the theory is both simple yet evocative. Look, they\u2019ll use this issue to attack me, thinking that this is the foundation of regenerative medicine. But they\u2019re wrong: once the arguments start and the flames of academic war erupt, I will be the only one who benefits. My opponents will fail and be thoroughly discredited; my soldiers will become a dedicated but foolish hivemind. Tony, this is what makes the game fun.\u201d\n Seeing her eyes sparkle with excitement, I finally understand why my father would so often murmur the word \u201cmonster\u201d whenever she came up in conversation. She\u2019s far more terrifying than any AI I\u2019ve encountered. I surmise her tactics: \u201cDo you plan on continuing to let Edmund lead the charge for you?\u201d\n \u201cEdmund?\u201d She\u2019s startled for a moment, then laughs uproariously. \u201cOh my goodness, you really didn\u2019t notice?\u201d\n \u201cNotice what?\u201d\n \u201cThe Edmund at the press event was a hologram\u2014the real Edmund passed away five years ago.\u201d\n Once again I feel helpless, like an insect that\u2019s been caught in a spider\u2019s web. \u201cI really didn\u2019t notice\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOkay, then that\u2019s our little secret.\u201d She giggles and taps her head. \u201cThere was no Edmund on stage at the announcement. The one standing there speaking through the hologram was me.\u201d\n \u201cBut you . . . Why did you keep his death a secret?\u201d\n \u201cUsing him and your father as the mouthpieces of the research group and the charitable foundation saved me a lot of trouble. Plus, he agreed to let me use his likeness,\u201d she explains patiently.\n I notice her expectant gaze. \u201cThen\u2014do you want me to join the foundation?\u201d\n \u201cThat would be the most perfect outcome. Tony Lee would without a doubt be the finest spokesperson for the Tony Lee Charitable Foundation.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut you won\u2019t join.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n \u201cBecause your body language and your expression give you away,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this, and this kind of work doesn\u2019t suit you anyway\u2014either way, I want you to make your own choices. From your reaction just now, I think you\u2019re far more interested in the spaceship.\u201d\n I relax my hands, held tightly all this time in front of my chest. \u201cIt\u2019s true; a research ship does sound interesting.\u201d\n \u201cAnd also mad,\u201d she says. \u201cAs your mother, I don\u2019t want you to go. I don\u2019t want you to become a research subject again.\u201d\n Her gaze now seems to truly carry a deep love. I don\u2019t understand her at all. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019ll make up my own mind.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. I have no right to tell you what to do.\u201d She lets out a soft sigh. \u201cBut I still want to tell you that you\u2019re my most perfect creation, so perfect that you frighten me.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cEvery time I saw you, heard about you, or even earlier, when I was pregnant with you and felt you, I experienced such terror.\u201d She looks out the window. \u201cBecause once I turned my head and saw the pile of trash in my lab, I\u2019d suddenly realize the vast distance between myself and the Creator. I\u2019d worry if I\u2019d made a mistake from the very start, because I\u2019d broken His rules.\u201d\n \u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong,\u201d I say. \u201cYou saved my life.\u201d\n \u201cAt a price.\u201d Her voice softens, revealing a deep exhaustion. \u201cAn enormous price that you can never imagine.\u201d\n Everything happens just as she predicted.\n Controversy after controversy concerning chimeras and human experimentation erupt, and every politician and college student seems to have something to say about the subject.\n The dispute of the century ends three years later with news of Edmund\u2019s \u201cdeath.\u201d His obituary, in combination with a new paper, deals a mortal blow to her opponents.\n The revolutionaries reap the fruits of their victory, and the conservatives, in the face of ironclad proof, wilt and fade. Chen Ying\u2019s timely announcement of the research spaceships turns into the last lifeline for these drowning ethicists to clutch. The wild plan easily gains everyone\u2019s support: immortality proves to be an irresistible temptation for all, and even the wealthiest can\u2019t obtain a ticket aboard the ships.\n Of course, obtaining a ticket isn\u2019t a problem for me.\n I end up boarding Eden after all. Called by a strange impulse and yearning deep in my heart, I abandon my family, my friends, my job\u2014everything I have on Earth. At the embarkation ceremony, I watch Chen Ying, the captain, deliver a speech.\n \u201cFrom today on, this is our ship. My dearest friend named it Eden, for it carries humanity\u2019s wildest dream, and because it will bring us new life.\u201d\n E. The Complex Chimera\n \u201cIt\u2019s still a child,\u201d Luo Ming said. \u201cThis explains everything.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean? What exactly is \u2018it\u2019?\u201d Qin Wei asked, confused.\n \u201cAdam,\u201d Luo Ming replied. \u201cOr, to be more accurate, \u2018it\u2019 is the collective made up of the Adams within all 109 cultivation cabins. They\u2019ve connected with one another to create an enormous creature that thinks, breathes, and bleeds\u2014a complex chimera.\u201d\n Qin Wei paused for three seconds before he processed what Luo Ming was saying. \u201cPreposterous! How could this be?\u201d\n \u201cYes, that\u2019s really what it is. Originally, it wasn\u2019t supposed to have thoughts, but you placed brains into its body, thereby giving it consciousness. All chimera experiments prohibit the creation of a nervous system\u2014this was a basic rule put in place during the design of the Adam matrix, but you\u2019ve broken it.\u201d\n Luo Ming noticed that the captain had stopped outside the cultivation cabin to listen to his explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely smart, but, at the same time, extremely na\u00efve. After observing for a long time, it was clever enough to break into and take over the monitoring system for the cultivation cabins, but it had no idea that the hospital ordering system even existed. Now it\u2019s trying to imitate us. It found a human corpse to study and analyze, and it\u2019s trying to use these organs to create a self\u2014it really thinks of itself as the Adam of lore, so it\u2019s trying to create an Eve. God, this is too funny!\u201d\n \u201cEnough!\u201d Qin Wei shouted. \u201cI need you to provide me with evidence, Officer Luo, and not mere crackpot theories.\u201d\n \u201cI believe that, in every cultivation cabin, you\u2019ll find extra organs that haven\u2019t been ordered\u2014for example, eyes, because it\u2019s eager to learn about this world.\u201d Luo Ming was speaking quickly, his tongue racing to catch up with his thoughts. \u201cPlease send someone to check\u2014oh, it must also have had help moving the corpses and limbs into the cultivation cabins, unintelligent helpers that it could easily control.\u201d\n Luo Ming trailed off as a police droid entered. It was carrying a whole set of human ribs. Seeing Qin Wei and Luo Ming, it stopped, dazed, as though it didn\u2019t know what it was supposed to do.\n \u201cI\u2019ve long said that the ship\u2019s intelligence systems are too primitive.\u201d Unwittingly, Luo Ming had borrowed one of Edmund\u2019s phrases. \u201cIf the complex chimera can take over the monitoring system, then controlling these police droids would be child\u2019s play.\u201d\n The appearance of the confused police droid forced Qin Wei to accept Luo Ming\u2019s conclusion: the one responsible for the series of incidents was Adam, the soul of Eden. After a hundred years of growth, it awakened the brains stored inside its pouches, dreamed up its own ideas, and was now trying to use the organs it had cultivated to create a new human-shaped self.\n \u201cI\u2019ll go check for those eyes you mentioned.\u201d Qin Wei\u2019s face was dark as he exited the cultivation cabin. Luo Ming watched him leave.\n Alone with Luo Ming in the cabin, the police droid came back to life and shut the door.\n Luo Ming heard his own heart thumping. This was no good. He had no idea where Edmund was, and this police droid looked much stronger than he was.\n \u201cDid you find me,\u201d the police droid said, \u201cbecause you are me?\u201d\n \u201cAre . . . are you speaking through that thing?\u201d Luo Ming stared at the pair of eyes hanging in the corner of the cultivation cabin\u2014light brown with a hint of gray.\n \u201cI am,\u201d replied the police droid under the control of the complex chimera. \u201cPlease answer my question, Tony Lee.\u201d\n \u201cWhen did you discover my true identity?\u201d Luo Ming countered.\n \u201cWhen I first received your organ order,\u201d the chimera said. \u201cYou asked for eyes. My eyes.\u201d\n Those are my eyes\u2014Luo Ming gazed into those irises, recalling the close-up photograph sealed away in his memories.\n \u201cSo I was the one who triggered your self-awareness.\u201d He let out a soft sigh. \u201cYes, I felt your presence the very first time I entered a cultivation cabin. I deduced everything from that feeling.\u201d\n \u201cWould I have grown to look like you?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve failed; I didn\u2019t create Eve.\u201d The police droid looked down at the floor, then carefully placed the ribs atop the human skin. \u201cWhy? Tell me: where did I go wrong?\u201d\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way humans create new life.\u201d\n \u201cBut this is how you created me. You put different things into my body, and then I became me.\u201d The police droid looked at him, puzzled. \u201cAnd I also know that I\u2019m the same as you.\u201d\n \u201cNo, you and I are not the same. We weren\u2019t born in this way\u2014even you weren\u2019t born like this.\u201d Luo Ming took a step back, gingerly making his way toward the cabin door.\n \u201cHow are we different? My cells are identical to yours.\u201d The pair of eyeballs stared at Luo Ming.\n \u201cOnly some parts are the same.\u201d Luo Ming burst through the cabin door, leaping out without any hesitation. Only after he landed did he yell, \u201cEdmund!\u201d\n The silhouette of the police droid froze by the cabin door. Edmund had appeared just in time to take control of it. \u201cNice work,\u201d said Luo Ming.\n But there was no response.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Luo Ming tapped his ear. \u201cDidn\u2019t you do this? Stop hiding!\u201d\n \u201cI used the ship\u2019s control system to lock down all police droids.\u201d The captain answered him. \u201cThank you for helping us uncover the truth, Officer Luo\u2014or do you prefer Tony Lee?\u201d\n \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d Luo Ming looked at her. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve known about my identity for a long time, Captain Chen Ying.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. Do you think I would have allowed you to gallivant about my ship, poking your nose into everything otherwise?\u201d Chen Ying glared at him. \u201cEnough. Don\u2019t play innocent with me. Your acting skills are nowhere near your mother\u2019s. Let me see: taking over a police droid, hmm? And stealing information from my cabin\u2014do you need me to list out every violation you\u2019ve committed over the years?\u201d\n Luo Ming tried to placate her with a grin. \u201cAll in the service of solving cases, Your Excellency.\u201d\n Chen Ying harrumphed. \u201cI have to admit you\u2019ve done a good job.\u201d\n \u201cThank you for your approval.\u201d\n Chen Ying shook her head, deciding to change the topic. \u201cI\u2019ve already directed the ship to land. Luckily, we happen to be headed toward Earth already. The regenerative medicine group will send scientists to study this complex chimera. Eden\u2019s mission is over, and I\u2019ve done my duty to your mother.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019ve done a good job, too,\u201d Luo Ming said.\n \u201cHave you kept your distance from me because I was your mother\u2019s lover?\u201d Chen Ying suddenly asked.\n Luo Ming couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my mother has never \u2018loved\u2019 anyone.\u201d\n \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\n \u201cLove requires being with someone; words of love are just lies,\u201d Luo Ming said. \u201cShe would never have wasted time being with anyone.\u201d\n Chen Ying looked at him. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n 6. Epilogue\n Before I leave Eden, I go find Chen Ying.\n \u201cShe passed away not even a month after you saw her for the last time,\u201d Chen Ying says. \u201cOf course, she\u2019d already planned everything.\u201d\n \u201cI guessed.\u201d It was around then that I received the AI Edmund as a gift.\n Chen Ying takes me to the medical research facility under Deck Seven. Her real tomb is hidden there: a small, white box, not a single word anywhere on it.\n \u201cIs this really what she wanted?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cActually, I decided to bring her with me when we loaded the ship.\u201d Chen Ying laughs bitterly. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have cared where she\u2019s buried, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cBut to be on a spaceship\u2014\u201d I think about it. \u201cForget it. This is fine.\u201d\n Chen Ying looks at me. \u201cThank you.\u201d After a pause, she says, \u201cFrom the very beginning, I knew she wanted me only for my ships.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened between my mother and you is none of my business.\u201d\n But she goes on, speaking to herself. \u201cMy family was among the first to get into the space assembly business, and the first to construct a ship large enough for interstellar colonization\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I know you don\u2019t want to hear any of this.\u201d\n \u201cUh\u2014\u201d I hesitate for a moment. \u201cPlease go on.\u201d\n \u201cTo make a long story short, by the time I met her, we\u2019d already completed the designs for the spaceships and the preliminary investment. The first time she saw me, she asked me right away whether she could borrow a couple ships for research. I thought she was nuts\u2014each ship cost hundreds of billions!\u201d\n That sounds just like my mother. \u201cI can imagine that.\u201d\n \u201cTo change my mind, she switched to an equally ridiculous method of persuasion. I was younger than her by six years. I had two children, but I\u2019d never gotten married. At first, I told my boyfriend about her as a joke.\u201d\n \u201cBut she succeeded in the end.\u201d\n Chen Ying sighs. \u201cYep.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s just how she was,\u201d I tell her. \u201cMy father was more or less in the same situation.\u201d\n \u201cShe was . . . very unique.\u201d Chen Ying pauses and looks at me again. \u201cWhen I hesitated about starting a relationship with her, she said something that changed me. She could plant her ideas into your heart and make it seem like they were native to the soil.\u201d\n My curiosity overcame the awkwardness of hearing about my mother\u2019s love life. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n \u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019re standing inside a cage that I can\u2019t see, but outside the cage is the whole world. I\u2019ll be here waiting for you to come out, and then you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s nothing to be scared of.\u2019\u201d\n I\u2019m reminded of a recording of an interview my father did shortly after setting up the Tony Lee Charitable Foundation. That was the one time he and my mother appeared together on TV after their divorce, and they\u2019d appeared only to respond to the attacks on chimera experiments. The host was losing in verbal jousting with my mother and decided to change tactics by turning to my father: \u201cI\u2019d really like to know why you\u2019ve agreed to work with the former Mrs. Lee. Didn\u2019t she abandon you and Tony?\u201d\n My father paused thoughtfully, and then said, \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen different paths in life, but, as her friend, I\u2019ve never doubted her wisdom and courage. You must understand that she\u2019s not an ordinary person like you and me.\u201d\n \u201cHow is she different?\u201d asked the host.\n \u201cWe\u2019re often bound by custom and habit, but she\u2019s not. She doesn\u2019t even understand why we\u2019re confined by these rules, unable to keep up with her. Marriage, science, what have you\u2014to her, these are all mere problems to be solved. She\u2019s like a curious child, afraid of nothing, intent on finding out what the world beyond the fence is like\u2014this is why she was able to successfully create a chimera, and it\u2019s also why she can now save lives through Adam.\u201d\n While he spoke, the camera was focused instead on my mother\u2019s face. Her perfect little smile disappeared, replaced by confusion and surprise. I can\u2019t remember if I asked Edmund a question while watching the recording or if he had jumped in on his own initiative, but I distinctly remember the AI\u2019s commentary:\n \u201cShe thought she knew the truth about everything, but she didn\u2019t know the truth about herself\u2014only your father understood her.\u201d\n F. Regeneration\n The last person to disembark from Eden was Lin Ke\u2014the woman who was so upset by her organ cancellation that she reported it to the police, and who suffered a heart attack upon seeing Cabin 35.\n After three days of emergency medical treatment, her heart was still on the verge of failure. And, due to oxygen deprivation, her cerebrum was barely alive. Having obtained the captain\u2019s authorization, the doctors decided to take the extraordinary step of conducting an emergency transplant with two organs found in the cultivation cabins\u2014they certainly weren\u2019t hers, but they came back negative on the lymphocyte cross-matching test. Unexpectedly, the procedure was a complete success.\n A week later, Lin Ke, supported by a doctor, disembarked from Eden. Standing together with Luo Ming, they waited for the shuttle to take them back to Earth. She said \u201chello\u201d to Luo Ming, who recognized her as the woman who had first pursued the mysterious organ cancellations and who had collapsed in front of Cabin 35.\n After some small talk, he said, \u201cSo, you\u2019ve recovered?\u201d\n \u201cThanks to organ replacement surgery,\u201d she said, \u201cHow did you solve the case?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s quite a story.\u201d Since she was the first witness, he felt comfortable recounting for her the details of the mystery, including the part where all the Adams had joined to become a complex chimera.\n \u201cIncredible!\u201d Lin Ke\u2019s eyes shone as she listened. \u201cHow\u2019s the pig\u2014I mean, how\u2019s the complex chimera doing now?\u201d\n Luo Ming looked at her, startled. \u201cWait, did you just say \u2018pig\u2019?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got some strange ideas in my head now.\u201d She laughed sheepishly. \u201cYou told me all the cultivation cabins are joined into one chimera; maybe a part of \u2018it\u2019 is now in my brain.\u201d\n \u201cDid you have a cerebrum transplant? I thought those weren\u2019t possible!\u201d\n \u201cAh, yes, but the doctors had to try to save my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey used a preserved brain from Cabin Zero instead of one grown from scratch. My current brain must have spent quite a long time in Cabin Zero.\u201d\n Luo Ming nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad the risky surgery worked out. But are you still \u2018Lin Ke\u2019?\u201d\n \u201cWho knows.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to see her friends any time soon, at least.\u201d\n Luo Ming felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when he saw her warm and cunning smile. Uneasy, he cleared his throat and said, \u201cThe complex chimera is still on Deck Seven. Right now Eden is swarming with regenerative medicine specialists.\u201d\n \u201cSo that\u2019s what\u2019s going on! After you go back to Earth, what are you going to do?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019ll travel the world after so many years spent cooped up in a ship.\u201d\n She smiled again. \u201cSounds like a great plan.\u201d\n The shuttle arrived at the port. Luo Ming stepped through the door and turned around. He found Lin Ke rooted to her spot.\n \u201cDo you need help?\u201d he asked.\n She dismissed him with a little wave. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to stay on the ship, Tony. This time, I won\u2019t abandon it again.\u201d\n Luo Ming\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve spent more than a century with you\u2014I think that\u2019s long enough,\u201d she said. \u201cMy other child needs me now.\u201d\n Before Luo Ming could try to go back to her, the doors to the shuttle hissed shut. He pounded with all his might against the metal panels, but they didn\u2019t budge at all. \u201cDammit! Open the door! Please, open the door!\u201d\n But the shuddering of the floor told him that the shuttle had already taken off. Luo Ming looked out the window in despair. The space station was already several kilometers away. He would never again see \u201cLin Ke.\u201d\n He held his breath, and, fingers trembling, found her in his long contacts list.\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d Luo Ming asked.\n Soon, he received a direct message in response:\n \u201cRemember what I told you before, Tony: there never was any Edmund. I was always the one speaking.\u201d\n Footnotes\n 1 - In 2010, Kobayashi et al. published a study in Cell that demonstrated the viability of rat-mouse chimeras. At the same time, commentary about the study also appeared in Cell under the title \u201cViable rat-mouse chimeras: where do we go from here?\u201d This quote paraphrases that commentary. Of note is the fact that the same research group published another study in PNAS in which they performed a similar experiment with a pig. Ethical concerns stopped them from creating a human-pig chimera.\n 2 - Named as one of the ten greatest scientific discoveries of 2013, CRISPR/Cas9 allows the creation of organisms with knocked out genes. That is, so long as we know which genes control the development of which organs, those genes can be made inoperative (\u201cknocked out\u201d). If a knockout pig blastocyst were combined with human stem cells, theoretically, a pig could be grown with a human organ.\n Originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, October 2015.\n Translated and published in partnership with Storycom.\n Gu Shi is a speculative fiction writer and an urban planner.

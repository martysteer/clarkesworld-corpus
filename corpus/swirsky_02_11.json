One dusty night, a monkey elder woke thirsty. He crept away from his sleeping mate and went to the well for a drink. Inside, he saw a reflection of the moon.\n \u201cThe moon has fallen into our well!\u201d he hollered.\n His ruckus woke the other monkeys. They all agreed that it would be a terrible thing to live in a moonless world. They joined hands and formed a chain to climb into the well and rescue the moon.\n As the monkeys dove in, the moon\u2019s reflection broke, leaving blank dark waters. The shamed monkeys climbed out again: shivering, wet, and empty-handed. The real moon chuckled above them, safe in the sky.\n Norbu liked that story better than the others Jamyang told. He liked other stories about the moon even better: histories and text books and biographies of astronauts from the dead American empire. Even as a young child, Norbu was impatient with Jamyang\u2019s fantastic tales of weather mages and magic scarves. Jamyang tried to get him to see the beauty of old stories for their own sake, but Norbu never listened. To him, the moon was the future.\n Before Norbu left to become a taikonaut, Jamyang told him, \u201cI am going to borrow a radio so I can listen every second you are on the moon.\u201d\n Norbu smiled and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Ma,\u201d but Jamyang thought he looked pleased as he grabbed his hat and went out the door.\n The day before the launch, Jamyang hiked across the dry terrain of the plateau to her nearest neighbor\u2019s. The woman\u2019s son gave her a near-defunct radio that he\u2019d found in a landfill and repaired. The boy was training himself to be a mechanic and he always asked after Norbu, who had promised to write him a letter when he applied to university. Usually, Jamyang enjoyed talking about her son, but that day she was impatient to get home.\n Over and over, the boy repeated his instructions for how to use the machine. \u201cDo you know what to do? Do you know what to press?\u201d\n Jamyang fended off his concerns, protesting, \u201cI know, I know, I used to have one,\u201d but the boy continued fretting and repeating. He\u2019d never gotten over the impression most people had of Jamyang, that just because she preferred past ways to future, she must never have seen any technology, even as a young girl.\n Jamyang returned home with the radio at dusk, the sun pouring out red and orange light across the horizon. She listened while shelling peas. The lady reporter\u2019s voice was fluid and rhythmic; Jamyang found it easy to listen to her, even as she repeated the same few facts to fill the hour. \u201cThanks to backing from the Egyptian government, Qinghai\u2019s first expedition into space lands on the moon today, led by Melbourne-trained astronomer Karma Sangemo . . . the expedition hopes to find asteroid debris from the near miss in 2029 . . . \u201d\n Jamyang thrilled every time she heard her son\u2019s name: \u201cGeologist Sopa Norbu says it\u2019s time for Qinghai to make a contribution to the world which has given it so much. He says the people of Qinghai must work tirelessly toward the future . . . \u201d\n On the third evening, Jamyang sat by the window with her embroidery. She missed a stitch as the reporter\u2019s voice broke out of its mannered tones, registering panic. \u201cWe\u2019re receiving an urgent report from our Beijing office. Hostilities have broken out between Egypt and Australia. The Australian government is threatening to detonate a spore-cluster bomb in Cairo . . . The Egyptians have issued a response. They say they won\u2019t allow the bomb to kill millions of innocent citizens . . . \u201d\n Murmuring suggested a conversation off the microphones. Jamyang leaned closer to the radio.\n \u201cThe Egyptians are threatening to block worldwide transmissions to prevent the detonation signal from going through. They\u2019ve given the Australians ten minutes to respond. If the Australians don\u2019t stand down, global communications could be blocked for weeks. Wait, I\u2019m being told we may not be able to keep transmitting\u2014\u201d\n The reporter\u2019s voice decayed into static. Jamyang smacked the radio.\n \u201cNo!\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t cut out! Come back.\u201d\n She smacked it again.\n \u201cCome back on the air. This is not funny! I tell you, come back.\u201d\n Waves of white sound poured out of the old speakers, loud and relentless as a winter sandstorm.\n Norbu walked from the moon\u2019s surface into the pressurized cockpit which rumbled with the sound of static like a distant storm. The expedition\u2019s leader, Sangemo, shouted into the microphone of the ship\u2019s ancient transponder. After hours of trying to contact someone, her voice had become as hoarse and rough as the static.\n Triangular windows on either side of the main control panel looked down on the cratered surface. Through them, he could see the expedition\u2019s other members collecting samples from the meteor impact site. Norbu stretched with relief as he removed his spacesuit.\n \u201cAny luck?\u201d asked Norbu.\n Sangemo started as she turned to face him, as if she hadn\u2019t noticed him before. \u201cI\u2019m trying Cairo and Xining. Maybe reception will come back in one before the other.\u201d\n Norbu\u2019s eyes flickered toward the fuel gauge. \u201cHow long do we have . . . \u201d\n \u201cBefore our oxygen runs out? Another day. Maybe less.\u201d\n \u201cMy mother said she was going to listen to radio coverage of our trip. She must be very worried.\u201d Norbu rubbed the back of his neck, trying to ease his knotted muscles. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to fly back blind, I\u2019ll need to start calculating for re-entry right away. It\u2019ll be chancey, but it\u2019s possible I can get it right.\u201d\n Norbu expected Sangemo to chime in with her usual pragmatic analysis of statistics and time lines, but instead the woman opened her mouth slowly and hesitantly as if she didn\u2019t want to let out the words forming in her throat. She closed her mouth again, and looked away into the shadows. Norbu\u2019s tension tightened further in his chest.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.\n She looked down. \u201cDo you remember your briefing on the legacy fail-safe?\u201d\n \u201cThe programming safeties the Americans put in to prevent sabotage?\u201d asked Norbu. \u201cWeren\u2019t those taken out when they sold us the ship?\u201d\n Sangemo sighed. \u201cThey were supposed to be.\u201d\n She flipped open the lid that protected the delicate equipment that sensed the ship\u2019s positioning in relation to earth. The instruments had frozen at impossible readings and showed no signs of change. She wouldn\u2019t meet Norbu\u2019s gaze.\n \u201cSo what are you saying?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck here?\u201d\n \u201cThe engines won\u2019t reinitialize unless the ship has confirmation of radio contact,\u201d said Sangemo. \u201cEven if we could calculate re-entry . . . the ship won\u2019t move.\u201d\n Norbu felt dizzy. He gripped one of the handles embedded into the side of the ship. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die here? We can\u2019t even try to fly back?\u201d\n \u201cUnless radio contact comes back. Yes.\u201d\n Norbu surprised himself with the force of his anger. He punched the wall, his fist aching from contact with the metal. His head hurt, and he wanted to shout at Sangemo, take her by the shoulders and tell her that she was wrong, she was lying. The rational part of his mind that ticked beneath his spinning anger reminded him that this wasn\u2019t Sangemo\u2019s fault. It was the American\u2019s. It was the Egyptian\u2019s. It was the Australian\u2019s. But they weren\u2019t here.\n Norbu stalked over to the windows and looked down at the surface. Norbu wondered if they\u2019d feel as blindsided by this news as he did. They were always calling Norbu an innocent, an optimist. Probably Sangemo would say she\u2019d always suspected the Americans couldn\u2019t be trusted to fulfill their part of the contract. That was Norbu\u2019s problem. He had too much faith.\n Everyone in the expedition had wanted so badly to reach the moon. No one wanted its cold, dead surface as a burial ground.\n \u201cI should tell the others,\u201d said Sangemo, softly.\n Norbu didn\u2019t turn toward her. \u201cI\u2019ll stay on the microphone,\u201d he said.\n \u201cThanks.\u201d He heard the click and shuffle of Sangemo putting on her spacesuit. \u201cWell,\u201d she added even more quietly, \u201cIt\u2019ll give us a chance to finish the chemical testing you wanted to do on the lava samples.\u201d\n Norbu realized she wanted him to smile to show he understood it wasn\u2019t her fault, to take some of the burden off of her shoulders. He didn\u2019t have the energy to comfort her. He remained silent as Sangemo\u2019s helmet clicked into place and her footfalls fell hollow on the metal steps leading downward.\n Norbu turned to the main control panel. The static roared and rattled, vibrating through his bones. He stared down at his crewmates through the triangular windows; they still pursued their various tasks, just now turning their heads toward Sangemo as she approached them. He imagined them stuck in their places like flies in amber, forever frozen. He shouted into the microphone\u2019s deaf ear, and suddenly in his mind, it wasn\u2019t the headquarters in Xining he was talking to.\n \u201cMother! Mother, is that you? Can you hear me? Listen to me! Stay out of the storm! Don\u2019t try to come for me. Are you listening? I\u2019m stuck here. I don\u2019t want you to be stuck here, too. Don\u2019t try to come for me, mother! You have to move on.\u201d\n Norbu could hardly make out his voice in the onslaught of sound. Static swallowed him in a tumble of sand and dust.\n Jamyang loved two things: her son and stories. Which was why she decided to catch a troop of monkeys to help rescue Norbu from the moon.\n Five days and nights, Jamyang cooked. She labored over the fire without sleeping. Sweat dripped from her brow, salting the broth. Her deep sobs woke the stinging flavors of the spices. Her burned fingertips rolled a dazzling hint of flame into the dough.\n When the vast buffet was complete, Jamyang tottered away from the stove on weary legs and laid the feast on the threshold. The scents of thenthuk noodle soup, momo dumplings, and butter tea traveled swiftly through the cold, clean air of the plateau.\n The sun glared down. A small breeze ruffled a whirl of dust before dying down. The plateau remained still.\n Jamyang drooped. Her tired eyes stung as if they were full of sand. An inquisitive bird swooped down on black wings to investigate the meal. Jamyang shooed him away.\n Sudden, bright chittering drew her attention to the horizon. A band of gold-furred monkeys approached across the wide terrain. They held each other\u2019s paws one after the other in a chain. Their noses tilted upward, sniffing the air. Jamyang\u2019s exhaustion vanished.\n She clapped her hands and gathered a handful of dumplings. \u201cCome eat!\u201d she called, holding them out. \u201cCome, quickly! I\u2019ve made it all for you!\u201d\n The monkeys snatched the food out of Jamyang\u2019s hands, eating with feral quickness as if afraid such good fortune would melt if they ate too slowly. Jamyang beamed down at them, offering new tidbits when their paws emptied. She was as attentive and elegant as the palace servants from the old stories.\n When there was no more food, the monkeys lolled about. Partners idly groomed each other\u2019s sleek fur. Others lay belly up, enjoying the faint warmth of the distant winter sun. Jamyang passed through the troop, patting the monkeys\u2019 flossy white beards. She counted them: chig, nyi, sum. Four hundred and seventy monkeys had gathered on her land.\n \u201cMy friends, thank you for coming,\u201d said Jamyang. \u201cI need your help.\u201d\n The monkeys\u2019 collective, satiated gaze settled on Jamyang as if to ask: What can we do?\n Jamyang knelt. She drew a shawl over her shoulders. Cheap North American fabric was little good against the chill.\n \u201cI have a son, Norbu,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is a taikonaut, a person who goes into space. People here in Qinghai have wanted to go into space for a long time. They want to show the world that Qinghai is worth something as an independent state, that our worth didn\u2019t die when the American Empire and the old Republic of China fought themselves to pieces.\n \u201cEgypt loaned us money to buy an old American era ship. It arrived by train in the capitol at Xining. Twenty thousand people gathered to see it. It was such an honor for my son to be part of something so big!\n \u201cEgypt and Australia started arguing again, over whatever the rich fight about. Qinghai wasn\u2019t involved. But when have superpowers worried about who they hurt? Their fight stranded my son on the moon.\n \u201cFinally, after two weeks, Egypt reached a truce with Australia and cut off their jamming signal. I thought, at last, we can save my son! But then the prime minister came on the radio. He said we cannot afford to send a rescue ship. He said we should honor my son\u2019s crew for their sacrifice. He said they have asphyxiated on the moon. Huh! I know they are not dead. The prime minister only wants to save money. He thinks about gold more than people.\n \u201cI went to the monastery to ask them for help. The monks told me not to worry. They said that when Norbu died, he would be reincarnated on earth and that was all the homecoming he needed. What comfort is that for a grieving mother?\n \u201cI took the train to the television station in Xining, thinking they could help me talk sense into the prime minister. They sent out a young woman half my age wearing a short skirt. She took my hands and said, \u2018We\u2019re so glad you came. We\u2019re ten minutes short for the evening news.\u2019 They filmed me for half an hour and sent me home with a handful of piastres.\n \u201cNo one cared about my son.\n \u201cI thought I would die of grief. I sat in the dark, doing nothing. I looked at the radio and remembered the static that killed my son, so angry and loud. I looked out the window and saw the moon. And then I realized how silly I\u2019d been! No one wants to hear the stories anymore. Even as a child, Norbu never wanted to hear them. But I remembered you.\u201d\n A satisfied smile stretched across Jamyang\u2019s lips.\n \u201cWe\u2019re going to build another chain to the moon. But this time, it will be the real moon! Will you help me?\u201d\n A large female with a puff of auburn fur over her eyes approached Jamyang, taking her hand. The monkeys chattered. The female led Jamyang into the crowd. The other monkeys gathered around to groom her, their short black fingers tugging at Jamyang\u2019s clothes, traversing her skin, winding through her hair.\n Jamyang let them pull her into their center. She raised her hands toward the moon. \u201cI knew you would help. Thank you. Together, we\u2019ll get my son back, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n Jamyang and the monkeys practiced from dawn until dusk, forming ever-longer chains into the sky. They went out every morning, even in the bitterest winter winds. Once, a ferocious gust picked up the tiniest monkey and blew him halfway across the plateau. His mother had to run all night to fetch him back.\n After sunset, Jamyang brought the monkeys into her house for large meals and warming butter tea. After they ate, the monkeys groomed Jamyang. In exchange, she told them old Tibetan stories about the Weathermaker and the wise scholar Padmasambhava\u2019s magic scarves. The monkeys fell asleep to the sound of Jamyang\u2019s soothing voice. She joined them on the floor, huddled body to fur.\n One bitterly cold morning, Jamyang woke with a sense of purpose. \u201cWe should do it today,\u201d she said. She urged the monkeys outside into the frigid air.\n The largest monkey planted himself solidly in the field. His mate, the second-largest, climbed onto his shoulders. She held out her arms to one of her sons, the third-largest monkey. So it went, smaller and smaller monkeys scrambling up their elders.\n When the chain had grown so tall that the top monkey could touch the belly of a passing airplane, a roaring sounded in the distance. Jamyang turned. A sandstorm whirled toward them, dust and sand rumbling across the horizon in great dun-colored clouds.\n \u201cHurry! Hurry!\u201d Jamyang told the monkeys. The next pair rushed past her, holding their paws over their eyes to keep out the sand. Luckily, they had practiced so often that even blind they knew what to do.\n Jamyang spat out a mouthful of sand. Grains caught in her eyes. She could no longer see the monkeys, only hear their chatter. The tiniest monkey clung to her breast until it was his turn. He jumped to the ground, tugging on Jamyang\u2019s hand to pull her behind him. She heard his toes brush through the elders\u2019 fur as he climbed up and up and up.\n Now it was Jamyang\u2019s turn. She planted her foot on the eldest monkey\u2019s shoulders and began to climb. The monkeys shifted under her, groaning as they accepted her weight. Currents of sand drove against her back, scouring her skin. Gusts roared in her ears like static.\n On the shoulders of a strong young male, she paused to wrap her shawl over her mouth so she could breathe. Sand worked its way in anyway, coarse underneath her tongue.\n The climb seemed to last forever. At first, she kept track of how many monkeys she\u2019d passed. Soon she lost count. Her hands and feet became numb, assaulted by millions of hard, minuscule grains. She could no longer hear the monkeys, only the storm\u2019s relentless white crash.\n At last, Jamyang mounted a pair of teeny tiny shoulders. No more paws reached for her. The sandstorm retreated to a distant rumble. Jamyang opened her eyes, scraping sand out of her lashes. The sky around her was absolute matte black, darker than ink on midnight silk. Above hung the moon, great and white and pitted with craters.\n Jamyang looked down. The chain of monkeys trailed away at a steep angle, appearing to grow smaller and smaller like railroad tracks moving to the horizon. The line disappeared into the swirling sand.\n Jamyang smiled into the face of the tiniest monkey. \u201cWe made it!\u201d she said. The tiny monkey chattered back happily. She ruffled its fur.\n Stretching out her arms as if she was going to pick up a huge barrel, Jamyang hugged the moon\u2019s surface. Her legs swung above her head like she was doing a handstand. The world went topsy-turvy. She flipped onto her feet. She felt a blush as the blood pooled in her head, then stiffness in her ankles as if it were all rushing into her legs. Suddenly, she was looking up at the monkeys instead of down at them.\n \u201cThank you so much!\u201d she said, waving.\n The tiniest monkey lowered his little black paw to wave back.\n \u201cWait for me!\u201d Jamyang said. \u201cI will return with my son.\u201d\n The tiniest monkey regarded Jamyang with sober, comprehending eyes. Above him, the chain swayed like a tall stem of grass in the wind.\n Jamyang turned her attention to the vast vista of the moon. She leapt between craters. \u201cNorbu!\u201d she shouted. \u201cI\u2019ve come for you! Where are you?\u201d\n Jamyang passed scraps of ancient American technology, marked with faint symbols of red, white, and blue. Beyond them, stood an old but intact South African war machine, faceted lenses gazing down at an ancient enemy on earth. Deactivated scuttlebots lay scattered across the landscape, legs curled up like dead spiders.\n Jamyang caught sight of her son\u2019s ship. It stuck up from the horizon like a great white needle, faded red paint etching a stripe around its tip. \u201cNorbu?\u201d Jamyang shouted. No reply came.\n A crater the size of a lake sprawled in front of the ship. Three figures in spacesuits stood around it, frozen. A woman bent over a rock, squinting at an instrument. Beside her, a man sat on another rock, holding his head in his hands. Another leapt toward the ship, caught in mid-jump.\n \u201cHello, good people?\u201d Jamyang called. \u201cI am Norbu\u2019s mother. It\u2019s all right. I am here to bring you home.\u201d\n They remained frozen, like dancers caught by a photographer\u2019s flash. Jamyang passed them. She mounted the steel mesh steps leading into the ship.\n Jamyang crawled through tiny passages until she entered a room where she could stand. Norbu stood in front of a huge machine the width of three large men standing shoulder to shoulder. His mouth stretched open into a shout. Sweat beaded his flushed cheeks.\n Jamyang threw her arms around the waist of his spacesuit. \u201cNorbu! I knew you weren\u2019t dead!\u201d\n Norbu\u2019s body wrenched into motion, like a stuck cart pulling free from the mud. He jumped back, startled. \u201cMa? What are you doing here?\u201d He tapped a gauge on the panel. \u201cI can\u2019t have much O2 left.\u201d He twisted a microphone toward his mouth. \u201cCairo, can you hear me? Xining, do you read?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t talk to them,\u201d said Jamyang. \u201cI\u2019m the one who came to rescue you.\u201d\n \u201cWhere\u2019s Sangemo? Where\u2019s Dorje?\u201d\n \u201cHush. They\u2019re outside. We\u2019ll wake them when we head home. See?\u201d She pointed out the triangular windows overlooking Norbu\u2019s frozen crewmates. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what I had to go through to find you. The prime minister refused to send anyone for you!\u201d\n Norbu shook his head like a person waking from a long dream. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . remember. What happened? Our radios went dead.\u201d\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d\n \u201cA signal came through before it happened . . . I\u2019m having trouble remembering . . . my head hurts, I\u2019m all fuzzy . . . I remember thinking about you, hoping you\u2019d find a way to move on . . . \u201d\n \u201cBut I did move on, don\u2019t you see? I came for you. The monks and the television people, they wouldn\u2019t help me, so I summoned monkeys and climbed my way to you, just like in the old stories. I can bring you all home.\u201d\n Norbu shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n Jamyang went to the window. \u201cI hope the monkeys can hold us all. That girl\u2019s a sturdy one, isn\u2019t she?\u201d She clucked her tongue against her teeth.\n \u201cMa, this is important. I\u2019m trying to remember. The transmission . . . \u201d\n \u201cThe Australians declared war,\u201d said Jamyang. \u201cThey threatened to detonate a spore-cluster bomb.\u201d\n \u201c-a spore-cluster bomb,\u201d Norbu finished with his mother. \u201cThe Australians would never have done it. It was an empty threat. The Australians would never have done it. Not with the Egyptian military presence in New Zealand, ready to retaliate with short-range missiles. It was an empty threat. The Egyptians knew that. Sangemo contacted the ambassador to beg them to delay their response until we could get home. The Egyptian ambassador said they couldn\u2019t. He said it would make them look weak. They loaned us the money to help us get to space, they said it was important for Qinghai to join the modern world, but they forgot us as soon as it became inconvenient . . . \u201d\n \u201cDo we need to straighten this out now?\u201d said Jamyang.\n \u201cSangemo gave the headset to Dorje. He pleaded, \u2018I have sons at home. They need a father.\u2019 When that didn\u2019t work, Sangemo took the headset again. She said, \u2018We\u2019ll cut our mission short and leave now. We\u2019ll be in orbit in a few hours. You can send out your signal then.\u2019 She said, \u2018You have no idea how much this means to Qinghai. We\u2019ve been waiting to show the world that we, too, are a great people. We, too, can touch the moon.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cEnough of this now,\u201d said Jamyang. \u201cYou never wanted to listen to stories, but they\u2019ve saved you now, haven\u2019t they?\u201d Jamyang grabbed Norbu\u2019s hand to pull him toward the door. He shook himself loose.\n \u201cNo, ma, you don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m running out of oxygen. You\u2019re a hallucination.\u201d\n \u201cYou say this to the woman who comes to rescue you? Children! I cooked kitchens full of noodles and dumplings to lure the monkeys. When the new world fails you, the old stories are always there.\u201d\n \u201cI need to get to the others,\u201d said Norbu.\n Jamyang watched him pull on his spacesuit. \u201cYou don\u2019t need that.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care if I am hallucinating, I\u2019m not going out onto the moon without my suit,\u201d said Norbu. He pulled the bubble of his helmet over his head and bounded out of the room.\n Jamyang followed. Norbu\u2019s crewmates remained frozen in the crater. Norbu went to each of them, waving his gloved hands in front of their still faces. Finally, he turned to his mother, hands groping in front of him as if searching for something concrete to grasp.\n \u201cI always thought I\u2019d relive the most exciting moments of my life before I died. Winning the bicycle race from Xining to Qinghai Lake. The clean empty feeling of running ten kilometers, three thousand feet above sea level. Being chosen for the expedition. The launch! But when Sangemo told us about the message from Cairo, I kept thinking about you, Ma, and the old stories you used to tell. Monkeys forming a chain and jumping into a well after the moon.\u201d\n Norbu paused. Behind his helmet, his expression was inscrutable.\n \u201cI must love you very much.\u201d\n \u201cAs I love you,\u201d said Jamyang.\n Around them, the world began to unfreeze. Norbu\u2019s crewmates inched forward as if in a slow motion video. From Norbu\u2019s space suit there came the noise of his radio, sputtering the empty static of Australia\u2019s jamming signal. Jamyang flinched.\n \u201cYou can hear that?\u201d said Norbu.\n \u201cNever mind!\u201d shouted Jamyang. \u201cCome on! We should get back to the monkeys before they fall!\u201d\n Jamyang turned to flee back the way she\u2019d come, but her feet only ran in place. Dead scuttlebots lay where she hoped to find the monkeys. Panic cinched her throat. She couldn\u2019t breathe. She clawed at her neck. \u201cWhere did the earth go?\u201d she choked.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you, ma? There isn\u2019t any air here. The old legends aren\u2019t true.\u201d\n \u201cWe have to get home!\u201d\n Norbu shook his head slowly. \u201cWe can\u2019t, ma. You and I, we\u2019re both fools. Nothing we believed was true. There\u2019s nothing for us in the past or the future. I remember when I was a kid thinking if Qinghai could just get to the moon we\u2019d be like all those other countries, rich and glamorous. No more poverty. No more children starving in the streets. No more taxes to pay for other people\u2019s wars. No more generations of boy soldiers coming home crippled. We\u2019d leap across the gap and when we landed - we\u2019d be with everyone else in the future.\u201d\n Norbu stomped his foot. Moon dust billowed around him in slow motion. \u201cEverything I grew up thinking\u2014it was all wrong. I was trying to grab the future out of the well water. But it was only a reflection. It\u2019s hovering above us, chuckling in the sky. And here we are, wet.\u201d\n Static roared in their ears, like the sandstorm.\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Jamyang.\n Norbu placed his hand on her face. His thick Kevlar spacesuit felt rough against her cheek.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you, Ma? We\u2019ve fallen in the well. There\u2019s nothing left to breathe.\u201d\n Rachel Swirsky holds an MFA from the Iowa Writers Workshop where she, a California native, learned about both writing and snow.

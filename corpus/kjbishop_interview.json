Bishop\nK.J. Bishop\u2019s first novel, The Etched City, was published by indie press Prime Books and then picked up by Bantam as well as Pan Macmillan, in addition to foreign language editions. It garnered excellent critical attention and was a finalist for the World Fantasy Award, in addition to winning the Crawford Award for best first novel. Bishop has also had stories in Leviathan 4, The New Weird, The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases, and several other publications.\nFor those who aren\u2019t familiar with Bishop\u2019s fiction, she writes in a somewhat surrealist, almost Decadent vein, with The Etched City being a kind of dark urban fantasy. Her writing can be lush, but also sparse and minimalistic when she wants it to be. She, perhaps more than most others, strikes me as someone who could go in any direction as a writer.\nBishop and her husband currently live in Bangkok, Thailand, after moving from Australia. From Bangkok, she keeps up a lively and sometimes controversial blog (http://kjbishop.net/). Since The Etched City, Bishop has been splitting her time between a variety of different projects. Although a new novel may be a year or more in the offing, she is working on short fiction. I decided to check in on Bishop and find out what she\u2019d been up to . . .\nHow did the publication of The Etched City change your life?\nIt made me decide to try to learn to be a writer. I didn\u2019t have much of a literary vocation beforehand. I wrote the book without thinking of it as the beginning of anything. Afterwards, I wasn\u2019t sure whether to continue with web design or do something else. The publication made me decide on the \u201csomething else,\u201d which was writing. So it changed my direction. It brought me a whole lot of new friends and acquaintances. It also made me face and fight the people-pleasing side of myself.\nDid your view of the novel change after the reviews and reader comments?\nNot much. Reviews and comments were so diverse that if I\u2019d listened to them all my views would have had to change in several contradictory directions. I took certain technical criticisms on board; that was about it.\nIf you had the whole experience to do over, is there anything you would have done differently?\nRegarding the book, I\u2019d have given more story to Raule. If I\u2019d had my Bangkok experiences then, I could have added more detail to Ashamoil. In my general life, I might have decided much earlier to keep up a second job (I now teach English) rather than try to write full-time, which didn\u2019t work for me.\nHave you any contact to other writers in Bangkok? And have you been exposed to Pacific Rim or Southeast Asian writings/writers you weren\u2019t aware of before?\nI haven\u2019t tried to meet other writers here. I have writer friends online, but in my real social life I like to get away from the writing world and hang out with people who do other things. There\u2019s a sort of local genre about farang (foreign, white) men in Bangkok and their adventures with bargirls and hustlers and so forth, which I didn\u2019t know about before. I\u2019ve been getting into Japanese authors a bit more \u2014 but famous ones, like Mishima, Kobo Abe, Natsume Soseki. I have fuddy-duddy tastes, I guess.\nHas the move from Australia to Bangkok had any effect on your writing\u2014tone, subject matter, process?>\nIt\u2019s starting to have an effect, mainly on subject matter. But since I came late to writing and have been trying out different things these past few years, I think it\u2019s also just a natural process of change. The Iraq war has probably had an equal effect. I\u2019ve become more interested in morality, justice, kindness \u2014 the person who is trying to be good, and the difficulty of doing the right thing, or even working out what the right thing is.\nYou\u2019ve worked on and off on different follow-up novels to The Etched City. What are you currently working on?\nI\u2019m superstitious about talking about long-term projects. There\u2019s a fantasy novel, a collaborative novel/non-novel, and a couple of stories. I\u2019m getting closer to enough material for a story collection. I can talk about one of the stories, which, as you know, since you inspired it, is about a giant mouseman slogging through a post-apocalyptic world. For the past year I\u2019ve also been writing a ridiculous doujinshi, based on The Etched City, which I post on my blog. It was sparked by a reader\u2019s remark that the book was \u201csurprisingly heteronormative\u201d for a decadent-influenced work, and snowballed from there.\nHow difficult is writing, for you? Do you get joy out of the act of writing itself?\nWriting is easy. Writing well is a bit harder. I\u2019m not good with plot, and I doubt I ever will be. I like to write in different styles. Some are easier for me than others. I love it when the surrealist muse strikes and I can just sit back and channel something bizarre. But there\u2019s also pleasure in consciously crafting normal sentences and paragraphs. I nearly always get pleasure out of writing. What I hate is looking back over it and realising that what I\u2019ve written is awful.\nWhat\u2019s your dream project? Something you\u2019ve had in mind for a long time but it\u2019s just not ready to be brought out into the world yet?\nI would love to do a graphic novel, but my art skills aren\u2019t good enough. I\u2019m giving myself a few years to improve. If I just can\u2019t get there, I\u2019ll look for an artist to work with. I also have a mainstream novel that I keep trying to write. I think I\u2019ve stacked up about 500,000 words of horrible writing. I\u2019ll probably still be fiddling around with it when I\u2019m 90. I want to resurrect Patrick White and get him to write it, so maybe at some point I\u2019ll give up writing and turn to necromancy.\nTell me about the Mouse Man. What is he all about? Is he happy or not so much? Does he know how to dance? Does he know what dancing is?\nThe Mouse Man (ha, I just typoed \u201cMuse Man\u201d) is all about keeping him and his hairless long-nosed gopher-thing son alive from one day to the next. He isn\u2019t happy. I\u2019d say he\u2019s traumatised and possibly insane. He was once human, before reality broke. Yeah, he does know how to dance. In fact, I\u2019m just rewriting a bit where the addition of some dancing would be perfect. Thanks for the serendipity! He\u2019s in my head. I love him. When I love a character, I become that character\u2019s slave. I have to do things their way.\nFinally, are you a New Weird writer, or just an amiable eccentric who happens to indulge in Lautreaumont from time to time?\nTee hee, the latter. Maldoror is an astral virus that infected me years ago. Now I have chronic Maldoritis. Or Mal de Writers.\nJeff VanderMeer is an award-winning writer with books published in over 20 countries.

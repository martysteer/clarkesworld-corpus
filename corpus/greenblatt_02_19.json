Sturgeon Memorial Award\n2020 Finalist: WSFA Small Press Award\nI\u2019m beginning to regret my life choices, Saul. Also, hello from the edge of the galaxy.\nAlso, surprise! I know this isn\u2019t what you had in mind when you said \u201cKeep in touch, Hazel\u201d but this planet doesn\u2019t exactly invoke the muse of letter writing. The muse of extremely long voice messages however . . .\nSo. Want to know what\u2019s this world\u2019s like? Rocky, empty, and bleak in all directions, except one. The sky\u2019s so stormy and green it looks like I\u2019m trudging through the bottom of an algae-infested pond. I\u2019ve got this 85-million-dollar suit between me and the outside, but I swear, I\u2019m suffocating on the atmosphere. Also, I\u2019m 900 meters away from where I need to be with no vehicle to get me there except my own two legs.\nSo here I am. Walking.\nSorry to do this to you, Saul, but if I don\u2019t talk to someone\u2014well, freak out at someone\u2014I\u2019m not going to make it to the Library. And like hell I\u2019m going to send a message like this back to the boys on the program. You, at least, won\u2019t think less of me for this. You know that emotional meltdowns are part of my process.\n850 meters. I should have listened to you, Saul.\nAnd yes, I know how clich\u00e9 that sounds. I\u2019ve been to enough dinner parties and heard enough dinner party stories, especially once people learned that I\u2019m possibly the last astronaut ever. At least now I have an excellent excuse for turning down invitations. \u201cI\u2019d love to come, but I\u2019m currently thirty-two and a half lightyears away from Earth. Give your family my love.\u201d\nOf course, they won\u2019t get the message until six months too late.\nWow, that\u2019s depressing. See, this is why I told the people in R&D not to give me too many facts and figures, but they\u2019re nerds, you know? They can\u2019t help themselves. Despite best intentions, it sort of spills out of them sometimes.\nAnd it\u2019s not like I can forget.\n750 meters.\nThe good news is I can actually see the Library. So if I died here 742 meters from the entrance, I can expire knowing I was the first human to set eyes on this massive infrastructure of information in person.\nOh god. I might actually die out here, Saul. Not that the thought hasn\u2019t crossed my mind before, but the possibility becomes a lot more tangible when you\u2019re walking across an inhospitable alien landscape.\nAlso, my fancy astronaut suit is making some worrying noises. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s supposed to sound like it\u2019s wheezing.\n675 meters. God, Saul, I really hope this mission is worth it.\nHave I told about the Library, yet? No, I haven\u2019t, have I? And I\u2019ve only been talking about this, for what, years now? Well, you should know, it\u2019s not what I expected. Which is stupid because alien structures are supposed to be alien and not castles or temples, like with steeples and everything. Shut up, Saul. (I know you\u2019re laughing, or will be laughing at this six months from now.) I don\u2019t regret reading all those fantasy sagas when we were kids. Only that I didn\u2019t get to read more.\nBut you want to know what the Library looks like. Well, I\u2019ve climbed mountains that feel like anthills next to this building. It sort of looks like a mountain too. An ugly misshapen mountain, full of weird windows and jutting walls. It\u2019s shiny and smooth from some angles and gritty and dull from others. It gives me the shivers.\nWhich is not really surprising. This is an alien world with alien architecture full of all that alien and not so alien knowledge just waiting to be learned. More information than the starry-eyed Homo sapiens ever dreamed there was possible to know.\n500 meters.\nSaul, I\u2019m getting concerned about my suit. My left arm isn\u2019t bending at the elbow anymore. Not that I need my left arm to keep walking, but it\u2019s a bit disquieting, in a panic-inducing sort of way. God, this was so much easier when all I had to do was rely on the Librarians\u2019 technology to get me here. Now, I have to rely on humanity\u2019s own questionable designs to get me this last kilometer. But that\u2019s the Librarians\u2019 rules for getting in. \u201cYou have to get your representative to our entrance safely through a most unforgiving landscape.\u201d Turns out that outside of my very expensive outfit there\u2019s an absurdly high atmospheric pressure, corrosive gases, wild temperature fluctuations between shady and light patches, et cetera, et cetera. Also, the ground is just rocky enough to surprise you.\nI don\u2019t want to think about what\u2019ll happen if I trip. Can\u2019t think about it. I wasn\u2019t a physics major before, and this is not the time to start.\n350 meters.\nI mean, I knew the dangers signing up. I knew this was going to be the hardest part of the trip. (I mean, how could it not be? The Librarians figured out how to travel lightyears in a matter of months. And that\u2019s just for starters.) But I was the best candidate for the job and I had to do something, Saul. I know you think otherwise, but I haven\u2019t given up on humanity. This isn\u2019t running away.\nI wish I could run right now because now there seems to be a layer of fine dust coating the inside of my suit. Oh my god.\n250 meters.\nShut up, Saul. I can hear you telling me in that big brother voice of yours: \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you freak out, Hazel, just not right now\u201d like you did when we were kids. And you\u2019re right, I can\u2019t freak out, because the worst thing that could happen right now, aside from dying, is having an asthma attack from the dust. Okay, okay, okay. I just need to keep calm, keep focused, keep moving.\n175 meters.\nThere\u2019s definitely something wrong with my suit. The coating of dust in my suit has gone from \u201cminimal\u201d to \u201cdense\u201d and I have no idea which piece of equipment I\u2019m breathing in.\nDon\u2019t panic, Hazel.\nDon\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic.\nCan\u2019t panic. I\u2019m picturing the R&D nerds when I tell them about this. They\u2019re going to completely melt down when they hear that their precious design didn\u2019t hold up as well as planned. Good, retaliation hyperventilating. Because that\u2019s what happens when your best candidate for the job is an asthmatic anthropologist.\n100 meters.\nOkay, I\u2019m almost there. I can see the door. This faulty, pathetic excuse for a space suit only has to last me a few more minutes. I just need to keep walking. Soon I\u2019ll be safely inside and reunited with my beautiful, beautiful inhaler.\n75 meters\nWell. Hopefully, they let me in.\nSo . . . here\u2019s the thing Saul. The Librarians never actually gave us a guarantee that they would admit me. They said it was up to the Librarians who live in the Library. (Apparently, they are a different sect from the explorer Librarians that I met and traveled with and well, the two sects don\u2019t always agree.) But the explorer faction gave me a ride here, so that\u2019s got to count for something, right?\nThing is, this stupid suit was supposed to withstand a walk to the Library and back to the ship if I needed it. Looks like my safety net isn\u2019t catching much now.\n25 meters.\nI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you this before I left, but I\u2019m not sorry either. The knowledge that I can potentially gain here is worth the risk. It\u2019s worth every cent of that 85 million and if I\u2019m going to die on the steps, well that sucks. But okay, at least we tried.\n10 meters.\nI\u2019m not sorry, Saul. Just scared.\nHopefully the Librarians let me in, but if you don\u2019t get another transmission from me, you know what happened. Give the rest of the family my love.\nOkay. Here we go.\nHave you ever been in love, Saul?\nYes, I know you love Huang. I\u2019ve seen the way you look at her and she looks at you. But remember the moment when you looked at her like that for the first time and you thought, \u201cHoly crap. This is it. I\u2019ve finally found it.\u201d\nYeah. The Library, Saul, is magnificent.\nAnd . . . difficult to describe. It\u2019s sort of like the outside of the Library. It changes depending on what angle you look at it from.\nWhen I left the decontamination chamber (at least, I think that\u2019s what it was?), I stepped into the main room and everything was dimly lit and quiet. The Library\u2019s Librarians\u2014which I later learned preferred to be called the Archivists because they are not the Librarians who travel the universe\u2014were milling around the massive room. They looked similar to the explorer Librarians we met on Earth; tall, lanky, humanoid-like bodies. But they all had long, shimmering whiskers that the explorer Librarians didn\u2019t (couldn\u2019t?) grow out. Their whiskers went all the way down to their splayed, ten fingered feet.\nThe room was surprisingly empty except for these installations in the middle of the room that could either have been art or furniture. So you know, sort of like university libraries back home.\nI was just starting to breathe easier, my inhaler finally kicking in after that walk from hell, when the light changed and suddenly I was standing next to this fern/skyscraper thing that smelled weirdly like hops and was a violent shade of purple. It became ridiculously humid and the room was filled with what I can only assume were plants. Even the Librarians\u2014I mean, Archivists\u2014changed. Now, they had four legs and two arms and were covered in this lush white hair.\nI reached out and touched one of the ferns next to me and it was like touching a prickly soap bubble, which was not what I was expecting. But then again, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to reach out and tap me back on the forehead either.\nI think I swore. I\u2019m not sure because everything changed again. Suddenly, I was shivering and standing on something like a frozen ocean that\u2019s trapped an aurora in the floe. The air was nosebleed dry and smelled like rust and I could see pale things moving underneath the ice. The Archivists themselves had become round and translucent, floating a meter in the air.\nAnd the room kept changing. It was terrifying . . . and completely amazing, Saul.\nSo there I was, gaping like an idiot, simultaneously too afraid to move and too busy trying to take all of it in. In my slack-jawed stupidity, it took me far too long to notice that two things didn\u2019t change. First, the Archivists always kept their rubbery fluidity and their whiskers. And those little lights never moved.\nCrap, I\u2019m not describing this well. I forgot to mention the lights. There were thousands of them, like miniature stars, scattered seemingly at random around the room, drifting, hanging out in midair. I think they were what made everything change, because when an Archivist would go up and touch one with their long whiskers, bam! new setting.\nSo get this: When I finally mustered up a little courage and asked a passing Archivist what those lights were, they said: \u201cEvery known solar system worth learning about.\u201d\nI would say I\u2019ve died and gone to a better place, but I\u2019ve used up my quota of terrible clich\u00e9s just getting here.\nWait, that\u2019s not true. I still have one awful one left.\nI stood in that room for a while, longer than I should have, but the truth is I was trying to work up the nerve to introduce myself to the head Archivist. But I never did because eventually they came up and greeted me. It was one of the most nerve-wracking conversations I\u2019ve ever had. Between the steroids from my inhaler and pure, uncut anxiety, my hands were like a nine on the Richter scale.\nYou see, Saul, the Archivists are not to be messed with. Like seriously. Do not contradict them, raise your voice, be anything less than painfully respectful. They may look squishy, but they can dismantle you down to your atoms, capture you in a memory tablet, and put your unbelieving ass on a shelf where they keep all of the boring information that no one ever checks out. And they\u2019ll keep you sentient too.\nOr sentient enough. I hope.\nFortunately, my interview was fairly short. The head Archivist found me worthy enough, I guess, and gave me very, very limited access to the Library. When they led me to the section with our solar system, I sort of wished you were here Saul, so you could have taken a picture of my expression at that moment. Pretty sure you would qualify it as \u201cpriceless.\u201d Because the size of this room, you could fit a small town in here.\nAnd get this, the Archivist was apologetic. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just begun to study you and we thought you would prefer to see our research in physical form,\u201d they said, \u201cHopefully you can find what you need in our meager collection.\u201d\nExcept, here\u2019s the thing. They probably have more information on us than we have on ourselves.\nActually, I\u2019m counting on it.\nEverything here is so strange, Saul. The light is too colorless and the air tastes weird. The walls and the shelves seem to bend slightly. It\u2019s all new and deeply alien.\nIt\u2019s wonderful.\nThe Archivists have set up something that\u2019s not too different from a studio apartment in the corner of the section on sea coral. It has running water and artificial sunlight and all eleven seasons of M*A*S*H on a TV that looks like it came from the 1980s. I have this theory that my living quarters are part of some junior Archivist\u2019s final thesis project, but I\u2019m probably just culturally projecting. On the bright side, if they picked the 80s, they could have done much worse than M*A*S*H.\nI\u2019m sure in a few weeks I\u2019ll start having terrible bouts of homesickness and will send you even longer, possibly more rambling messages questioning every life decision leading up to this point. But right now, being in the Library is sort of liberating. In a let\u2019s-call-my-big-brother-because-my-new-studio-home-is-way-too-quiet sort of way.\nOh. I got your first message today. Remember the one you recorded six months ago, about three days after I left? I knew you were pissed, but wow, Saul. A backstabbing, alien-loving, wheezing, useless coward? You had three whole days to think of something and that\u2019s the best you could do?\nI know you didn\u2019t mean it. I know you\u2019re only half angry at me, half angry at our dying planet, and half angry at, well . . .\nI got a message from Huang too. She told me about the most recent miscarriage. I\u2019m so sorry, Saul. One day the two of you are going to be the world\u2019s best parents. I believe that more than I believe in your international reforestation project, which is definitely going to work.\nAnd I get how you think I\u2019m abandoning you and Earth for a sterile, stable library, but I needed to come here. I have this working theory about the Librarians. Wanna hear it? Too bad, I\u2019m going to tell you anyway.\nSee, the more time I spend with them, the more I\u2019m convinced Librarians could have obliterated us if they wanted to. But they haven\u2019t. In fact, they\u2019ve put a painstaking amount of effort into studying us and making first contact with all the right people. Asking those people just the right questions like: \u201cWe managed to save the information before this university archive burned or this datacenter got flooded. Would you like to retrieve it?\u201d Questions that convinced us to put this mission together.\nWhich leads me to believe they\u2019re trying to help us.\nI know you\u2019re rolling your eyes, Saul. Have I ever told you that you always look like a moody teenager when you do that? Yeah, I know I have. But hear me out, I\u2019m trying to tell you something important.\nPlease.\nDo you remember our first big argument over this mission? You said that anyone who comes to Earth while in the middle of an environmental collapse can\u2019t be trusted. I agree. Except, the first Librarian I ever met told me that the Library was built as a beacon for all sentient life in the universe. A place where researchers could come and learn about lost discoveries. And past mistakes.\nI can hear you saying: \u201cAnd you were na\u00efve enough to blindly trust them, Hazel?\u201d No, Saul, I\u2019m not. Before I was picked for this crazy mission, I was just there to help first contact go smoothly, being one of the few remaining anthropologists who have studied interactions between vastly different cultures. I had zero interest in becoming an astronaut; space travel always seemed too risky and uncomfortable to me. But the Librarians were impressed by my commitment to cultural preservation. The space program was impressed by my ridiculously good memory. And I became convinced that if I didn\u2019t go, someone else would eventually slip and we\u2019d be adding \u201ctotal societal collapse\u201d along with \u201cenvironmental disaster\u201d to the list of humanity\u2019s problems.\nYou see, Saul, there\u2019s so much that I\u2019m witnessing in the Library that I\u2019m not telling you, because the Librarians\u2019 advanced tech would devastate our underdeveloped society.\nWhich didn\u2019t stop the people in R&D from telling me over and over again to take careful notes on everything I observe and send them the information on the down low, of course. I was sent here to reclaim any research and history that could help us save ourselves, but I think they\u2019re hoping that I\u2019ll learn about useful alien tech too. I\u2019m tempted to send them a report that says: Sorry nerds, it\u2019s all just magic.\nNo, Saul, not really. My official reports are going to be way more straightforward and professional. You know, double the facts and half the amount of sarcasm. But I think I\u2019m going to keep sending these messages to you, for a while at least. All this is not actually why I \u201cran away\u201d from home.\nReally, it was just a good excuse to get out of commuting in Chicago traffic.\nJust kidding. It was the Great Plains fires. There\u2019s only so much smoke and ash an asthmatic researcher can deal with before she ships out.\nOnly sort of kidding.\nI have a list of things I need to investigate for the scientists back home, but for now, I think I\u2019m going to call it a day. Looking at the amazing amount of information around me makes me realize how much we\u2019ve lost. How the Librarians managed to recover all this is a mystery I don\u2019t intend to solve, but hopefully they managed to save the research I\u2019m looking for.\nHave I mentioned how much of this is mission is chalked up to hope?\nHello, Saul, I\u2019m lost. No, that\u2019s not true, my memory won\u2019t let me get lost, but I imagine this is what it feels like. The rows of memory tablets are identical, if you don\u2019t pay attention to the Archivists\u2019 annotations at every turn. I can\u2019t actually read them because they just look like miniature sculptures, but I remember the small differences. The Archivists were kind enough to give me a basic map with a basic translation of where to find things. But Librarians\u2019 basics and human basics are not the same thing.\nGod, I thought finding the research would be the easy part of this trip, but I might never find my way out of the single-celled organism section. So, give the family my love.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. Yes, I do. You\u2019re thinking: \u201cHow about you come home then, Hazel, and help me with these seedlings?\u201d because we\u2019ve been having this argument for what, ten years now?\nNo, not quite. Nine years, 10 months, and twenty-seven days, since that first fight over dinner.\nYeah, Saul. My memory is my own worst enemy sometimes.\nBy the way, I got your second message today. Apology accepted. But I can\u2019t come back, Saul. I barely started my information recovery project. Some good stuff got destroyed this last decade.\nLike Dr. Ryu\u2019s research. If I can find it. If it\u2019s here at all.\nGod, this message is depressing. Hey, here\u2019s something cool I learned today; the kitchen cabinets produce whatever food I\u2019m thinking about and the twenty some blank books in the living room become whatever I want to read. It really is like magic. Everything a human needs and all the books a girl can want.\nI\u2019m not coming home, Saul.\nWell, it\u2019s been a week and while I still haven\u2019t found Dr. Ryu\u2019s research, I\u2019ve found plenty of other interesting things here. Like patents and working concepts of solar powered vehicles and papers on regenerating corn seed that needs two times the amount of CO2 for photosynthesis. We had so many opportunities to stop things before they got terrible, Saul. And we missed them all.\nHonestly, the wealth of information here is mind-blowing. The Librarians are like the universe\u2019s most organized hoarders. They\u2019ve saved everything from road construction projects to packing and advertising protocols for the garment industry. And get this, every time I activate a memory table, the information is projected around me. Sometimes the entire aisle transforms and I literally get lost in my work. Which is why there\u2019s been a long gap since my last message. Sorry about that, Saul.\nDon\u2019t laugh, but I spent all of yesterday in the children\u2019s literature section. All the stories there came to life too; old houses covered in vines and chocolate factories and little engines that could. It was fantastic, Saul. And completely depressing. Because as I sat there surrounded by those hopeful stories, it hit me that your grandchildren might not even know these stories exist. Yes, I know you disagree. But I\u2019m a learned anthropologist and a general pessimist and I\u2019m scared.\nI asked an Archivist if this is how they store all their information. They asked if I\u2019d be offended if they laughed and showed me the memory tablet that contained all the knowledge of the Library. It was about the size of paperback romance novel.\n\u201cOur information would be inaccessible to you otherwise,\u201d the Archivist explained. \u201cAll of your search engines are either too crude or too biased.\u201d\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t this take you forever to build?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d they said, but I must not have looked convinced. \u201cMagic,\u201d they added.\nSaul, I think the alien race of information scientists are listening to these recordings. So whatever you do, don\u2019t reply back with anything you don\u2019t want recorded for posterity.\n\u201cWhy is the Library so large then?\u201d I asked.\nAnd here\u2019s where the story gets really depressing, Saul.\nThey told me that once this planet, the inhospitable place that\u2019s just a wasteland and a massive Library now, was full of life. There were once billions of Librarians. Now, there\u2019s only a few thousand. Before they became the masters of information science of the known universe, the Librarians ended up destroying their planet too.\nThe first Librarians I ever met told me the Library is a beacon for sentient life in the galaxy, except now I know it\u2019s not just a beacon for other species. The reason why the Library\u2019s so big, Saul, is that most of the Archivists and Librarians live here too.\nThey couldn\u2019t save their planet either.\nI can hear you asking me why I bothered coming here if I\u2019m going to be stubbornly bleak about the future and it\u2019s not an easy thing you demanded, brother mine, and I\u2019m trying to tell you in my circular, rambling way, that I . . .\nI . . .\nSaul. I need to call you back. I think I finally found Dr. Ryu\u2019s research.\nI\u2019ve got it, oh my god, I\u2019m so relieved. It was a fight to get it, though. No, Saul, I\u2019m not exaggerating. Stop rolling your eyes.\nRemember when I said the Archivists could keep their information sentient? Well, she was sentient enough, Saul.\nWhen I accessed the memory tablet, the researcher herself appeared so real and sharp I could see the gray strands in her hair and the clear gloss on her fingernails. She didn\u2019t look thrilled to see me and I should\u2019ve taken it as a warning, but I was way too excited.\n\u201cAre you Dr. Yumi Ryu?\u201d I asked. (Gushed would be more accurate.)\n\u201cUp to the age of 53,\u201d she answered\n\u201cAmazing! It\u2019s great to finally meet you, Dr. Ryu. I want to ask you everything. What\u2019s it like being archived by the Librarians? No, wait, can you tell me about your reforesting research first?\u201d\nFor some reason, Saul, my rambling didn\u2019t put her at ease. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, her expression suspicious.\n\u201cUm, well, because the news back home isn\u2019t good. Most of the North Pacific rain forest has been destroyed by a combination of drought and wildfires. Including your original research at UBC.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t seem surprised by this, just sad. \u201cAnd where is your team, Ms. . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cHazel Smith. It\u2019s just me.\u201d\nShe frowned, the suspicion on her face growing. \u201cThey sent a single astronaut? Why?\u201d\n\u201cResources and funds. Both are extremely limited these days.\u201d\n\u201cWhy you then?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a researcher too, Dr. Ryu, and I\u2019m dedicated to preserving human society. Also, because I have an extraordinary memory, especially for data and details, and don\u2019t need batteries.\u201d\nRyu arched an eyebrow. Out of nowhere, a memory tablet about the size of a romance novel appeared in her hands. She stared it intently.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, not getting a good vibe from this.\n\u201cReading your articles, academic and otherwise. Being part of the Library, Ms., excuse me, Dr. Smith, means I can check out materials too.\u201d\nSuddenly, I knew how this conversation would go. It would be like those awful dinner parties that ended in silent awkwardness when people asked why I didn\u2019t have kids. But there was nothing I could do, except try not to chew on my fingernails. In all of human culture, there\u2019s nothing more uncomfortable than standing there while someone else reads your work.\nBut if anthropology has taught me anything, Saul, it is that human beings can always surprise you.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Dr. Ryu said and the tablet disappeared from her hands. \u201cYou have a depressing view on human nature.\u201d\nI\u2019ve always hated having this conversation, so I stuck my hand in my pockets and said: \u201cI\u2019m just going off history.\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I agree.\u201d\nColor me stunned, Saul. \u201cSo will you tell me about your research?\u201d\nRyu stared at me hard, with that critical eye that only people who spend too much time in labs analyzing details can pull off.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\nNo. That\u2019s what she really said. After traveling thirty-two and a half lightyears for research like this. I won\u2019t lie, Saul, for a brief second I considered smashing the memory tablet.\n\u201cYou serious?\u201d I said.\n\u201cYes, Dr. Smith. I\u2019ve spent most of my professional career fighting politicians, big businesses, home developers, farmers. Anyone who didn\u2019t like the idea of giving up their land and returning it to forests, to try to reverse some of the damage we\u2019ve done. I can\u2019t tell you how many times people tried to destroy this research.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to destroy anything, Dr. Ryu. I\u2019ve given up too much for that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did you give up, Dr. Smith?\u201d\n\u201cEarth. Everyone I know and love. I\u2019ve risked my life for this information!\u201d I said. In hindsight, maybe a little too defensively.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s running away,\u201d she replied. Yeah, she really said that to me, Saul. \u201cWhy are you really here?\u201d\nI sighed and used your classic line. \u201cBecause it\u2019s hope for the future that keeps us going.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who do you have hope for, Dr. Smith? Because from what I\u2019ve read, you don\u2019t paint a hopeful picture.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what else to do. So, I told her, Saul. Everything I\u2019ve been trying to tell you.\nThere aren\u2019t many defining moments in my life. Mostly, I think defining moments are clich\u00e9s in hindsight. So maybe this is too, but do you remember that summer, ten years ago, when everything burned? Yeah, hard to forget.\nI\u2019d just gotten my first master\u2019s degree and wildfires in northern Washington were raging, and there was a trail you could take up a mountain that was still a safe distance away, but you could witness the worst fires in history firsthand. It was only an hour drive from campus. And I was frustrated and scared, but also curious. So I figured what the hell.\nI took this guy with me. No, you\u2019ve never met him, Saul.\nWe walked up that mountain together, though the ash made for awful traction.\nIt wasn\u2019t love and we both knew it. That was one of the many, many rules I broke to myself that summer. But I liked him and he liked me. And in that moment, that was enough. Good enough. The world was on fire and right then, I was too grateful to have someone who would climb a mountain with me just to watch the world ending.\nMortality makes you reckless sometimes, Saul.\nEventually the smoke got so bad that my asthma couldn\u2019t take it. He practically carried me back down.\nTwo months later, he went back home to Colorado, where there were a few trees left and I spent that fall sobbing and wheezing. Which made sense when I took a pregnancy test.\nI chose. And I don\u2019t regret that choice, Saul. Except three days, eighteen hours, and twelve minutes later, you called and told me about the first child you and Huang wouldn\u2019t have after all.\nI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you before, Saul. But I\u2019m not sorry either. I was twenty-three, and though I could repeat back textbooks verbatim, I consistently lost my keys and forgot to eat. And after that summer, it was hard to see myself with a future and much less, a future for a kid. I know you\u2019re disappointed in me because you believe that no opportunity should be wasted. You think every life, even the cockroaches in the shed, should have a go at it. You\u2019ve always believed in a future on Earth, Saul. Where I saw ashes, you saw fertile soil.\nThat\u2019s what I told Dr. Ryu. I told her all about you and Huang and your relentless perseverance and hope. I think she saw a kindred spirit in you or maybe just the right strain of stubbornness. So, she agreed to share her research with you. We\u2019re going to transcribe a little every day. Her memory tablet makes the Library\u2019s aisles transform into thriving forests. It is truly beautiful.\nConsider this part one of my gift to you, Saul, because like hell am I going to apologize for the choices that brought me here.\nPart two is that one of the benefits of becoming the last astronaut was getting a ridiculous stipend from the government. Well, more like a life insurance payout, because I\u2019m going to be here for a long time. Hopefully not forever, but there\u2019s a lot of lost information here and the Archivists apparently are used to long-term guests.\nI told you I had one last, terrible clich\u00e9 and it\u2019s the worst one of all. The one where the astronaut doesn\u2019t come home.\nSaul, I want you to use that money to start that family you and Huang always wanted.\nHonestly, I\u2019m still not convinced we can save Earth, but you are, and that works for me. So, I\u2019ll keep searching and sending home the information I find and maybe, between the two of us, that\u2019ll be enough.\nSo, give the family my love.\nA.T.

The red blur zipped across the length of the island, moving west to east, and shot out to sea. The sonic boom a moment later scattered the birds that wheeled above the fish processing plant and sent them squealing and plummeting.\n Elena said, \u201cWas that\u2014it was, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen a U-Man, Elena?\u201d J\u00fcrgo said.\n \u201cNot in person.\u201d At nineteen, Elena Pendareva was the youngest of the crew by at least two decades, and the only female. She and the other five members of the heavy plate welding unit were perched 110 meters in the air, taking their lunch upon the great steel shoulder of the Slaybot Prime. The giant robot, latest in a long series of ultimate weapons, was unfinished, its unpainted skin speckled with bird shit, its chest turrets empty, the open dome of its head covered only by a tarp.\n It had been J\u00fcrgo\u2019s idea to ride up the gantry for lunch. They had plenty of time: for the fifth day in a row, steel plate for the Slaybot\u2019s skin had failed to arrive from the foundry, and the welding crew had nothing to do but clean their equipment and play cards until the guards let them go home.\n It was a good day for a picnic. An unseasonably warm spring wind blew in from the docks, carrying the smell of the sea only slightly tainted by odors of diesel fuel and fish guts. From the giant\u2019s shoulder the crew looked down on the entire capital, from the port and industrial sector below them, to the old city in the west and the rows of gray apartment buildings rising up beyond. The only structures higher than their perch were Castle Grimm\u2019s black spires, carved out of the sides of Mount Kriegstahl, and the peak of the mountain itself.\n \u201cYou know what you must do, Elena,\u201d Verner said with mock sincerity. He was the oldest in the group, a veteran mechaneer whose body was more metal than flesh. \u201cYour first \u00fcbermensch, you must make a wish.\u201d\n Elena said, \u201cIs \u2018Oh shit,\u2019 a wish?\u201d\n Verner pivoted on his rubber-tipped stump to follow her gaze. The figure in red had turned about over the eastern sea, and was streaking back toward the island. Sunlight glinted on something long and metallic in its hands.\n The UM dove straight toward them.\n There was nowhere to hide. The crew sat on a naked shelf of metal between the gantry and the sheer profile of the robot\u2019s head. Elena threw herself flat and spread her arms on the metal surface, willing herself to stick.\n Nobody else moved. Maybe because they were old men, or maybe because they were all veterans, former zoomandos and mechaneers and castle guards. They\u2019d seen dozens of U-Men, fought them even. Elena didn\u2019t know if they were unafraid or simply too old to care much for their skin.\n The UM shot past with a whoosh, making the steel shiver beneath her. She looked up in time to take in a flash of metal, a crimson cape, black boots\u2014and then the figure crashed through the wall of Castle Grimm. Masonry and dust exploded into the air.\n \u201cLunch break,\u201d J\u00fcrgo said in his Estonian accent, \u201cis over.\u201d\n Toolboxes slammed, paper sacks took to the wind. Elena got to her feet. J\u00fcrgo picked up his lunch pail with one clawed foot, spread his patchy, soot-stained wings, and leaned over the side, considering. His arms and neck were skinny as always, but in the past few years he\u2019d grown a beer gut.\n Elena said, \u201cJ\u00fcrgo, can you still fly?\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. He hooked his pail to his belt and backed away from the edge. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m authorized for this air space.\u201d\n The rest of the crew had already crowded into the gantry elevator. Elena and J\u00fcrgo pressed inside and the cage began to slowly descend, rattling and shrieking.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s it about this time, you think?\u201d Verner said, clockwork lungs wheezing. \u201cOld Rivet Head kidnap one of their women?\u201d Only the oldest veterans could get away with insulting Lord Grimm in mixed company. Verner had survived at least four invasions that she knew of. His loyalty to Trovenia was assumed to go beyond patriotism into something like ownership.\n Guntis, a gray, pebble-skinned amphibian of Latvian descent, said, \u201cI fought this girlie with a sword once, Energy Lady\u2014\u201d\n \u201cPower Woman,\u201d Elena said in English. She\u2019d read the Illustrated Biography of Lord Grimm to her little brother dozens of times before he learned to read it himself. The Lord\u2019s most significant adversaries were all listed in the appendix, in multiple languages.\n \u201cThat\u2019s the one, Par-wer Woh-man,\u201d Guntis said, imitating her. \u201cShe had enormous\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAbilities,\u201d J\u00fcrgo said pointedly. J\u00fcrgo had been a friend of Elena\u2019s father, and often played the protective uncle.\n \u201cI think he meant to say \u2018tits\u2019,\u201d Elena said. Several of the men laughed.\n \u201cNo! J\u00fcrgo is right,\u201d Guntis said. \u201cThey were more than breasts. They had abilities. I think one of them spoke to me.\u201d\n The elevator clanged down on the concrete pad and the crew followed J\u00fcrgo into the long shed of the 3000 line. The factory floor was emptying. Workers pulled on coats, joking and laughing as if it were a holiday.\n J\u00fcrgo pulled aside a man and asked him what was going on. \u201cThe guards have run away!\u201d the man said happily. \u201cOff to fight the \u00fcbermensch!\u201d\n \u201cSo what\u2019s it going to be, boss?\u201d Guntis said. \u201cStay or go?\u201d\n J\u00fcrgo scratched at the cement floor, thinking. Half-assembled Slaybot 3000\u2019s, five-meter-tall cousins to the colossal Prime, dangled from hooks all along the assembly line, wires spilling from their chests, legs missing. The factory was well behind its quota for the month. As well as for the quarter, year, and five-year mark. Circuit boards and batteries were in particularly short supply, but tools and equipment vanished daily. Especially scarce were acetylene tanks, a home-heating accessory for the very cold, the very stupid, or both.\n J\u00fcrgo finally shook his feathered head and said, \u201cNothing we can do here. Let\u2019s go home and hide under our beds.\u201d\n \u201cAnd in our bottles,\u201d Verner said.\n Elena waved good-bye and walked toward the women\u2019s changing rooms to empty her locker.\n A block from her apartment she heard Mr. Bojars singing out, \u201cGuh-RATE day for sausa-JEZ! Izza GREAT day for SAW-sages!\u201d The mechaneer veteran was parked at his permanent spot at the corner of Glorious Victory Street and Infinite Progress Avenue, in the shadow of the statue of Grimm Triumphant. He saw her crossing the intersection and shouted, \u201cMy beautiful Elena! A fat bratwurst to go with that bread, maybe. Perfect for a celebration!\u201d\n \u201cNo thank you, Mr. Bojars.\u201d She hoisted the bag of groceries onto her hip and shuffled the welder\u2019s helmet to her other arm. \u201cYou know we\u2019ve been invaded, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n The man laughed heartily. \u201cThe trap is sprung! The crab is in the basket!\u201d He wore the same clothes he wore every day, a black nylon ski hat and a green, grease-stained parka decorated at the breast with three medals from his years in the motorized cavalry. The coat hung down to cover where his flesh ended and his motorcycle body began.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about Lord Grimm,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can handle any American muscle-head stupid enough to enter his lair. Especially the Red Meteor.\u201d\n \u201cIt was Most Excellent Man,\u201d Elena said, using the Trovenian translation of his name. \u201cI saw the Staff of Mightiness in his hand, or whatever he calls it.\u201d\n \u201cEven better! The man\u2019s an idiot. A U-Moron.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s defeated Lord Grimm several times,\u201d Elena said. \u201cSo I hear.\u201d\n \u201cAnd Lord Grimm has been declared dead a dozen times! You can\u2019t believe the underground newspapers, Elena. You\u2019re not reading that trash are you?\u201d\n \u201cYou know I\u2019m not political, Mr. Bojars.\u201d\n \u201cGood for you. This Excellent Man, let me tell you something about\u2014yes sir? Great day for a sausage.\u201d He turned his attention to the customer and Elena quickly wished him luck and slipped away before he could begin another story.\n The small lobby of her apartment building smelled like burnt plastic and cooking grease. She climbed the cement stairs to the third floor. As usual the door to her apartment was wide open, as was the door to Mr. Fishman\u2019s apartment across the hall. Staticky television laughter and applause carried down the hallway: It sounded like Mr. Sascha\u2019s Celebrity Polka Fun-Time. Not even an invasion could pre-empt Mr. Sascha.\n She knocked on the frame of his door. \u201cMr. Fishman,\u201d she called loudly. He\u2019d never revealed his real name. \u201cMr. Fishman, would you like to come to dinner tonight?\u201d\n There was no answer except for the blast of the television. She walked into the dim hallway and leaned around the corner. The living room was dark except for the glow of the TV. The little set was propped up on a wooden chair at the edge of a large cast iron bathtub, the light from its screen reflecting off the smooth surface of the water. \u201cMr. Fishman? Did you hear me?\u201d She walked across the room, shoes crinkling on the plastic tarp that covered the floor, and switched off the TV.\n The surface of the water shimmied. A lumpy head rose up out of the water, followed by a pair of dark eyes, a flap of nose, and a wide carp mouth.\n \u201cI was watching that,\u201d the zooman said.\n \u201cSome day you\u2019re going to pull that thing into the tub and electrocute yourself,\u201d Elena said.\n He exhaled, making a rude noise through rubbery lips.\n \u201cWe\u2019re having dinner,\u201d Elena said. She turned on a lamp. Long ago Mr. Fishman had pushed all the furniture to the edge of the room to make room for his easels. She didn\u2019t see any new canvasses upon them, but there was an empty liquor bottle on the floor next to the tub. \u201cWould you like to join us?\u201d\n He eyed the bag in her arms. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be, umm, fresh catch?\u201d\n \u201cIt is, as a matter of fact.\u201d\n \u201cI suppose I could stop by.\u201d His head sank below the surface.\n In Elena\u2019s own apartment, Grandmother Zita smoked and rocked in front of the window, while Mattias, nine years old, sat at the table with his shoe box of colored pencils and several gray pages crammed with drawings. \u201cElena, did you hear?\u201d Matti asked. \u201cA U-Man flew over the island! They canceled school!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be happy about,\u201d Elena said. She rubbed the top of her brother\u2019s head. The page showed a robot of Matti\u2019s own design marching toward a hyper-muscled man in a red cape. In the background was a huge, lumpy monster with triangle eyes\u2014an escaped MoG, she supposed.\n \u201cThe last time the U-men came,\u201d Grandmother Zita said, \u201cmore than robots lost their heads. This family knows that better than most. When your mother\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s not talk politics, Grandmother.\u201d She kissed the old woman on the cheek, then reached past her to crank open the window\u2014she\u2019d told the woman to let in some air when she smoked in front of Matti, to no avail. Outside, sirens wailed.\n Elena had been only eleven years old during the last invasion. She\u2019d slept through most of it, and when she woke to sirens that morning the apartment was cold and the lights didn\u2019t work. Her parents were government geneticists\u2014there was no other kind\u2014and often were called away at odd hours. Her mother had left her a note asking her to feed Baby Matti and please stay indoors. Elena made oatmeal, the first of many breakfasts she would make for her little brother. Only after her parents failed to come home did she realize that the note was a kind of battlefield promotion to adulthood: impossible to refuse because there was no one left to accept her refusal.\n Mr. Fishman, in his blue bathrobe and striped pajama pants, arrived a half hour later, his great webbed feet slapping the floor. He sat at the table and argued with Grandmother Zita about which of the twenty-one previous invasions was most violent. There was a time in the 1960\u2019s and seventies when their little country seemed to be under attack every other month. Matti listened raptly.\n Elena had just brought the fried whitefish to the table when the thumping march playing on the radio suddenly cut off. An announcer said, \u201cPlease stand by for an important message from His Royal Majesty, the Guardian of our Shores, the Scourge of Fascism, Professor General of the Royal Academy of Sciences, the Savior of Trovenia\u2014\u201d\n Mr. Fishman pointed at Matti. \u201cBoy, get my television!\u201d Matti dashed to the man\u2019s apartment and Elena cleared a spot on the table.\n After Mr. Fishman fiddled with the antenna the screen suddenly cleared, showing a large room decorated in Early 1400\u2019s: stone floors, flickering torches, and dulled tapestries on the walls. The only piece of furniture was a huge oaken chair reinforced at the joints with plates and rivets.\n A figure appeared at the far end of the room and strode toward the camera.\n \u201cHe\u2019s still alive then,\u201d Grandmother said. Lord Grimm didn\u2019t appear on live television more than once or twice a year.\n Matti said, \u201cOh, look at him.\u201d\n Lord Grimm wore the traditional black and green cape of Trovenian nobility, which contrasted nicely with the polished suit of armor. His faceplate, hawk-nosed and heavily riveted, suggested simultaneously the prow of a battleship and the beak of the Baltic albatross, the Trovenian national bird.\n Elena had to admit he cut a dramatic figure. She almost felt sorry for people in other countries whose leaders all looked like postal inspectors. You could no more imagine those timid, pinch-faced bureaucrats leading troops into battle than you could imagine Lord Grimm ice skating.\n \u201cSons and daughters of Trovenia,\u201d the leader intoned. His deep voice was charged with metallic echoes. \u201cWe have been invaded.\u201d\n \u201cWe knew that already,\u201d Grandmother said, and Mr. Fishman shushed her.\n \u201cOnce again, an American super power has violated our sovereignty. With typical, misguided arrogance, a so-called \u00fcbermensch has trespassed upon our borders, destroy our property . . . \u201d The litany of crimes went on for some time.\n \u201cLook! The U-Man!\u201d Matti said.\n On screen, castle guards carried in a red-clad figure and dumped him in the huge chair. His head lolled. Lord Grimm lifted the prisoner\u2019s chin to show his bloody face to the camera. One eye was half open, the other swelled shut. \u201cAs you can see, he is completely powerless.\u201d\n Mr. Fishman grunted in disappointment.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Matti asked.\n \u201cAgain with the captives, and the taunting,\u201d Grandmother said.\n \u201cWhy not? They invaded us!\u201d\n Mr. Fishman grimaced, and his gills flapped shut.\n \u201cIf Lord Grimm simply beat up Most Excellent Man and sent him packing, that would be one thing,\u201d Grandmother said. \u201cOr even if he just promised to stop doing what he was doing for a couple of months until they forgot about him, then\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThen we\u2019d all go back to our business,\u201d Mr. Fishman said.\n Grandmother said, \u201cBut no, he\u2019s got to keep him captive. Now it\u2019s going to be just like 1972.\u201d\n \u201cAnd seventy-five,\u201d Mr. Fishman said. He sawed into his whitefish. \u201cAnd eighty-three.\u201d\n Elena snapped off the television. \u201cMatti, go pack your school bag with clothes. Now.\u201d\n \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re spending the night in the basement. You too, Grandmother.\u201d\n \u201cBut I haven\u2019t finished my supper!\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll wrap it up for you. Mr. Fishman, I can help you down the stairs if you like.\u201d\n \u201cPah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed. Wake me when the war\u2019s over.\u201d\n A dozen or so residents of the building had gotten the same idea. For several hours the group sat on boxes and old furniture in the damp basement under stuttering fluorescent lights, listening to the distant roar of jets, the rumble of mechaneer tanks, and the bass-drum stomps of Slaybot 3000s marching into position.\n Grandmother Zita had claimed the best seat in the room, a ripped vinyl armchair. Matti had fallen asleep across her lap, still clutching the Illustrated Biography of Lord Grimm. The boy was so comfortable with her. Zita wasn\u2019t even a relative, but she\u2019d watched over the boy since he was a toddler and so became his grandmother\u2014another wartime employment opportunity. Elena slipped the book from under Matti\u2019s arms and bent to put it into his school bag.\n Zita lit another cigarette. \u201cHow do you suppose it really started?\u201d she said.\n \u201cWhat, the war?\u201d Elena asked.\n \u201cNo, the first time.\u201d She nodded at Matti\u2019s book. \u201cHating the Americans, okay, no problem. But why the scary mask, the cape?\u201d\n Elena pretended to sort out the contents of the bag.\n \u201cWhat possesses a person to do that?\u201d Zita said, undeterred. \u201cWake up one day and say, Today I will put a bucket over my head. Today I declare war on all U-Men. Today I become, what\u2019s the English . . . \u201d\n \u201cGrandmother, please,\u201d Elena said, keeping her voice low.\n \u201cA super villain,\u201d Zita said.\n A couple of the nearest people looked away in embarrassment. Mr. Rimkis, an old man from the fourth floor, glared at Grandmother down the length of his gray-bristled snout. He was a veteran with one long tusk and the other snapped off at the base. He claimed to have suffered the injury fighting the U-Men, though others said he\u2019d lost the tusk in combat with vodka and gravity: The Battle of the Pub Stairs.\n \u201cHe is the hero,\u201d Mr. Rimkis said. \u201cNot these imperialists in long underwear. They invaded his country, attacked his family, maimed him and left him with\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOh please,\u201d Grandmother said. \u201cEvery villain believes himself to be a hero.\u201d\n The last few words were nearly drowned out by the sudden wail of an air raid siren. Matti jerked awake and Zita automatically put a hand to his sweat-dampened forehead. The residents stared up at the ceiling. Soon there was a chorus of sirens.\n They\u2019ve come, Elena thought, as everyone knew they would, to rescue their comrade.\n From somewhere in the distance came a steady thump, thump that vibrated the ground and made the basement\u2019s bare cinderblock walls chuff dust into the air. Each explosion seemed louder and closer. Between the explosions, slaybot auto-cannons whined and chattered.\n Someone said, \u201cEverybody just remain calm\u2014\u201d\n The floor seemed to jump beneath their feet. Elena lost her balance and smacked into the cement on her side. At the same moment she was deafened by a noise louder than her ears could process.\n The lights had gone out. Elena rolled over, eyes straining, but she couldn\u2019t make out Grandmother or Matti or anyone. She shouted but barely heard her own voice above the ringing in her ears.\n Someone behind her switched on an electric torch and flicked it around the room. Most of the basement seemed to have filled with rubble.\n Elena crawled toward where she thought Grandmother\u2019s chair had been and was stopped by a pile of cement and splintered wood. She called Matti\u2019s name and began to push the debris out of the way.\n Someone grabbed her foot, and then Matti fell into her, hugged her fiercely. Somehow he\u2019d been thrown behind her, over her. She called for a light, but the torch was aimed now at a pair of men attempting to clear the stairway. Elena took Matti\u2019s hand and led him cautiously toward the light. Pebbles fell on them; the building seemed to shift and groan. Somewhere a woman cried out, her voice muffled.\n \u201cGrandmother Zita,\u201d Matti said.\n Elena was grateful that she could hear him. \u201cI\u2019ll come back for Grandmother,\u201d she said, though she didn\u2019t know for sure if it had been Zita\u2019s voice. \u201cFirst you.\u201d\n The two men had cleared a passage to the outside. One of them boosted the other to where he could crawl out. The freed man then reached back and Elena lifted Matti to him. The boy\u2019s jacket snagged on a length of rebar, and the boy yelped. After what seemed like minutes of tugging and shouting the coat finally ripped free.\n \u201cStay there, Mattias!\u201d Elena called. \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d She turned to assist the next person in line to climb out, an old woman from the sixth floor. She carried an enormous wicker basket which she refused to relinquish. Elena promised repeatedly that the basket would be the first thing to come out after her. The others in the basement began to shout at the old woman, which only made her grip the handle more fiercely. Elena was considering prying her fingers from it when a yellow flash illuminated the passage. People outside screamed.\n Elena scrambled up and out without being conscious of how she managed it. The street lights had gone out but the gray sky flickered with strange lights. A small crowd of dazed citizens sat or lay sprawled across the rubble-strewn street, as if a bomb had gone off. The man who\u2019d pulled Matti out of the basement sat on the ground, holding his hands to his face and moaning.\n The sky was full of flying men.\n Searchlights panned from a dozen points around the city, and clouds pulsed with exotic energies. In that spasmodic light dozens of tiny figures darted: caped invaders, squadrons of Royal Air Dragoons riding pinpricks of fire, winged zoomandos, glowing U-Men leaving iridescent fairy trails. Beams of energy flicked from horizon to horizon; soldiers ignited and dropped like dollops of burning wax.\n Elena looked around wildly for her brother. Rubble was everywhere. The front of her apartment building had been sheared off, exposing bedrooms and bathrooms. Protruding girders bent toward the ground like tongues.\n Finally she saw the boy. He sat on the ground, staring at the sky. Elena ran to him, calling his name. He looked in her direction. His eyes were wide, unseeing.\n She knelt down in front of him.\n \u201cI looked at straight at him,\u201d Matti said. \u201cHe flew right over our heads. He was so bright. So bright.\u201d\n There was something wrong with Matti\u2019s face. In the inconstant light she could only tell that his skin was darker than it should have been.\n \u201cTake my hand,\u201d Elena said. \u201cCan you stand up? Good. Good. How do you feel?\u201d\n \u201cMy face feels hot,\u201d he said. Then, \u201cIs Grandmother out yet?\u201d\n Elena didn\u2019t answer. She led him around the piles of debris. Once she had to yank him sideways and he yelped. \u201cSomething in our way,\u201d she said. A half-buried figure lay with one arm and one leg jutting into the street. The body would have been unrecognizable if not for the blue-striped pajamas and the webbing between the toes of the bare foot.\n Matti wrenched his hand from her grip. \u201cWhere are we going? You have to tell me where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n She had no idea. She\u2019d thought they\u2019d be safe in the basement. She\u2019d thought it would be like the invasions everyone talked about, a handful of U-Men\u2014a super team\u2014storming the castle. No one told her there could be an army of them. The entire city had become the battleground.\n \u201cOut of the city,\u201d she said. \u201cInto the country.\u201d\n \u201cBut Grandmother\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI promise I\u2019ll come back for Grandmother Zita,\u201d she said.\n \u201cAnd my book,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still in the basement.\u201d\n All along Infinite Progress Avenue, families spilled out of buildings carrying bundles of clothes and plastic jugs, pushing wheelchairs and shopping carts loaded with canned food, TV sets, photo albums. Elena grabbed tight to Matti\u2019s arm and joined the exodus north.\n After an hour they\u2019d covered only ten blocks. The street had narrowed as they left the residential district, condensing the stream of people into a herd, then a single shuffling animal. Explosions and gunfire continued to sound from behind them and the sky still flashed with parti-colored lightning, but hardly anyone glanced back.\n The surrounding bodies provided Elena and Matti with some protection against the cold, though frigid channels of night air randomly opened through the crowd. Matti\u2019s vision still hadn\u2019t returned; he saw nothing but the yellow light of the U-Man. He told her his skin still felt hot, but he trembled as if he were cold. Once he stopped suddenly and threw up into the street. The crowd behind bumped into them, forcing them to keep moving.\n One of their fellow refugees gave Matti a blanket. He pulled it onto his shoulders like a cape but it kept slipping as he walked, tripping him up. The boy hadn\u2019t cried since they\u2019d started walking, hadn\u2019t complained\u2014he\u2019d even stopped asking about Grandmother Zita\u2014but Elena still couldn\u2019t stop herself from being annoyed at him. He stumbled again and she yanked the blanket from him. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Mattias,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hold onto it\u2014\u201d She drew up short. The black-coated women in front of them had suddenly stopped.\n Shouts went up from somewhere ahead, and then the crowd surged backward. Elena recognized the escalating whine of an auto-cannon coming up to speed.\n Elena pulled Matti up onto her chest and he yelped in surprise or pain. The boy was heavy and awkward; she locked her hands under his butt and shoved toward the crowd\u2019s edge, aiming for the mouth of an alley. The crowd buffeted her, knocked her off course. She came up hard against the plate glass window of a shop.\n A Slaybot 3000 lumbered through the crowd, knocking people aside. Its gun arm, a huge thing like a barrel of steel pipes, jerked from figure to figure, targeting automatically. A uniformed technician sat in the jumpseat on the robot\u2019s back, gesturing frantically and shouting, \u201cOut of the way! Out of the way!\u201d It was impossible to tell whether he\u2019d lost control or was deliberately marching through the crowd.\n The mass of figures had almost certainly overwhelmed the robot\u2019s vision and recognition processors. The 3000 model, like its predecessors, had difficulty telling friend from foe even in the spare environment of the factory QA room.\n The gun arm pivoted toward her: six black mouths. Then the carousel began to spin and the six barrels blurred, became one vast maw.\n Elena felt her gut go cold. She would have sunk to the ground\u2014she wanted desperately to disappear\u2014but the mob held her upright, pinned. She twisted to place at least part of her body between the robot and Matti. The glass at her shoulder trembled, began to bow.\n For a moment she saw both sides of the glass. Inside the dimly lit shop were two rows of blank white faces, a choir of eyeless women regarding her. And in the window\u2019s reflection she saw her own face, and above that, a streak of light like a falling star. The UM flew toward them from the west, moving incredibly fast.\n The robot\u2019s gun fired even as it flicked upward to acquire the new target.\n The glass shattered. The mass of people on the street beside her seemed to disintegrate into blood and cloth tatters. A moment later she registered the sound of the gun, a thunderous ba-rap! The crowd pulsed away from her, releasing its pressure, and she collapsed to the ground.\n The slaybot broke into a clumsy stomping run, its gun ripping at the air.\n Matti had rolled away from her. Elena touched his shoulder, turned him over. His eyes were open, but unmoving, glassy.\n The air seemed to freeze. She couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t move her hand from him.\n He blinked. Then he began to scream.\n Elena got to her knees. Her left hand was bloody and freckled with glass; her fingers glistened. Each movement triggered the prick of a thousand tiny needles. Matti screamed and screamed.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d\n She talked to him for almost a minute before he calmed down enough to hear her and stop screaming.\n The window was gone, the shop door blown open. The window case was filled with foam heads on posts, some with wigs askew, others tipped over and bald. She got Matti to take her hand\u2014her good hand\u2014and led him through the doorway. She was thankful that he could not see the things they stepped over.\n Inside the scene was remarkably similar. Arms and legs of all sizes hung from straps on the walls. Trays of dentures sat out on the countertops. A score of heads sported hairstyles old-fashioned even by Trovenian standards. There were several such shops across the city. Decent business in a land of amputees.\n Elena\u2019s face had begun to burn. She walked Matti through the dark, kicking aside prosthetic limbs, and found a tiny bathroom at the back of the shop. She pulled on the chain to the fluorescent light and was surprised when it flickered to life.\n This was her first good look at Matti\u2019s face. The skin was bright red, puffy and raw looking\u2014a second-degree burn at least.\n She guided the boy to the sink and helped him drink from the tap. It was the only thing she could think of to do for him. Then she helped him sit on the floor just outside the bathroom door.\n She could no longer avoid looking in the mirror.\n The shattering glass had turned half of her face into a speckled red mask. She ran her hands under the water, not daring to scrub, and then splashed water on her face. She dabbed at her cheek and jaw with the tail of her shirt but the blood continued to weep through a peppering of cuts. She looked like a cartoon in Matti\u2019s Lord Grimm book, the coloring accomplished by tiny dots.\n She reached into jacket and took out the leather work gloves she\u2019d stuffed there when she emptied her locker. She pulled one onto her wounded hand, stifling the urge to shout.\n \u201cHello?\u201d Matti said.\n She turned, alarmed. Matti wasn\u2019t talking to her. His face was turned toward the hallway.\n Elena stepped out. A few feet away were the base of a set of stairs that led up into the back of the building. A man stood at the first landing, pointing an ancient rifle at the boy. His jaw was flesh-toned plastic, held in place by an arrangement of leather straps and mechanical springs. A woman with outrageously golden hair stood higher on the stairs, leaning around the corner to look over the man\u2019s shoulder.\n The man\u2019s jaw clacked and he gestured with the gun. \u201cGo. Get along,\u201d he said. The syllables were distorted.\n \u201cThey\u2019re hurt,\u201d the wigged woman said.\n The man did not quite shake his head. Of course they\u2019re hurt, he seemed to say. Everyone\u2019s hurt. It\u2019s the national condition.\n \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to break in,\u201d Elena said. She held up her hands. \u201cWe\u2019re going.\u201d She glanced back into the showroom. Outside the smashed window, the street was still packed, and no one seemed to be moving.\n \u201cThe bridge is out,\u201d the man said. He meant the Prince\u2019s Bridge, the only paved bridge that crossed the river. No wonder then that the crowd was moving so slowly.\n \u201cThey\u2019re taking the wounded to the mill,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThen trying to get them out of the city by the foot bridges.\u201d\n \u201cWhat mill?\u201d Elena asked.\n The wigged woman wouldn\u2019t take them herself, but she gave directions. \u201cGo out the back,\u201d she said.\n The millrace had dried out and the mill had been abandoned fifty years ago, but its musty, barn-like interior still smelled of grain. Its rooms were already crowded with injured soldiers and citizens.\n Elena found a spot for Matti on a bench inside the building and told him not to move. She went from room to room asking if anyone had aspirin, antibiotic cream, anything to help the boy. She soon stopped asking. There didn\u2019t seem to be any doctors or nurses at the mill, only wounded people helping the more severely wounded, and no medicines to be found. This wasn\u2019t a medical clinic, or even a triage center. It was a way station.\n She came back to find that Matti had fallen asleep on the gray-furred shoulder of a veteran zoomando. She told the man that if the boy woke up she would be outside helping unload the wounded. Every few minutes another farm truck pulled up and bleeding men and women stepped out or were passed down on litters. The emptied trucks rumbled south back into the heart city.\n The conversation in the mill traded in rumor and wild speculation. But what report could be disbelieved when it came to the U-Men? Fifty of them were attacking, or a hundred. Lord Grimm was both dead and still fighting on the battlements. The MoGs had escaped from the mines in the confusion.\n Like everyone else Elena quickly grew deaf to gunfire, explosions, crackling energy beams. Only when something erupted particularly close\u2014a nearby building bursting into flame, or a terrordactyl careening out of control overhead\u2014did the workers look up or pause in their conversation.\n At some point a woman in the red smock of the Gene Corps noticed that Elena\u2019s cheek had started bleeding again. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder you didn\u2019t lose an eye,\u201d the scientist said, and gave her a wad of torn-up cloth to press to her face. \u201cYou need to get that cleaned up or it will scar.\u201d\n Elena thanked her curtly and walked outside. The air was cold but felt good on her skin.\n She was still dabbing at her face when she heard the sputter of engines. An old mechaneer cavalryman, painted head to wheels in mud, rolled into the north end of the yard, followed by two of his wheeled brethren. Each of them was towing a narrow cart padded with blankets.\n The lead mechaneer didn\u2019t notice Elena at first, or perhaps noticed her but didn\u2019t recognize her. He suddenly said, \u201cMy beautiful Elena!\u201d and puttered forward, dragging the squeaking cart after him. He put on a smile but couldn\u2019t hold it.\n \u201cNot so beautiful, Mr. Bojars.\u201d\n The old man surveyed her face with alarm. \u201cBut you are all right?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs Mattias\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine. Matti is inside. He\u2019s sick. I think he . . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI see you\u2019ve lost your sausage oven.\u201d\n \u201cA temporary substitution only, my dear.\u201d The surviving members of his old unit had reunited, he told her matter-of-factly, to do what they could. In the hours since the Prince\u2019s Bridge had been knocked out they\u2019d been ferrying wounded across the river. A field hospital had been set up at the northern barracks of the city guard. The only ways across the river were the foot bridges and a few muddy low spots in the river. \u201cWe have no weapons,\u201d Mr. Bojars said, \u201cbut we can still drive like demons.\u201d\n Volunteers were already carrying out the people chosen to evacuate next, four men and two women who seemed barely alive. Each cart could carry only two persons at a time, laid head to foot. Elena helped secure them.\n \u201cMr. Bojars, does the hospital have anything for radiation poisoning?\u201d\n \u201cRadiation?\u201d He looked shocked. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I suppose . . .\n One of the mechaneers waved to Mr. Bojars, and the two wheeled men began to roll out.\n Elena said, \u201cMr. Bojars\u2014\u201d\n \u201cGet him,\u201d he replied.\n Elena ran into mill, dodging pallets and bodies. She scooped up the sleeping boy, ignoring the pain in her hand, and carried him back outside. She could feel his body trembling in her arms.\n \u201cI can\u2019t find my book,\u201d Matti said. He sounded feverish. \u201cI think I lost it.\u201d\n \u201cMatti, you\u2019re going with Mr. Bojars,\u201d Elena said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take you someplace safe.\u201d\n He seemed to wake up. He looked around, but it was obvious he still couldn\u2019t see. \u201cElena, no! We have to get Grandmother!\u201d\n \u201cMatti, listen to me. You\u2019re going across the river to the hospital. They have medicine. In the morning I\u2019ll come get you.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s still in the basement. She\u2019s still there. You promised you would\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYes, I promise!\u201d Elena said. \u201cNow go with Mr. Bojars.\u201d\n \u201cMatti, my boy, we shall have such a ride!\u201d the mechaneer said with forced good humor. He opened his big green parka and held out his arms.\n Matti released his grip on Elena. Mr. Bojars set the boy on the broad gas tank in front of him, then zipped up the jacket so that only Matti\u2019s head was visible. \u201cNow we look like a cybernetic kangaroo, hey Mattias?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be there in the morning,\u201d Elena said. She kissed Matti\u2019s forehead, then kissed the old man\u2019s cheek. He smelled of grilled onions and diesel. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d she said.\n Mr. Bojars circled an arm around Matti and revved his engine. \u201cA kiss from you, my dear, is payment enough.\u201d\n She watched them go. A few minutes later another truck arrived in the yard and she fell in line to help carry in the wounded. When the new arrivals were all inside and the stained litters had all been returned to the truck, Elena stayed out in the yard. The truck drivers, a pair of women in coveralls, leaned against the hood. The truck\u2019s two-way radio played ocean noise: whooshing static mixed with high, panicked pleas like the cries of seagulls. The larger of the women took a last drag on her cigarette, tossed it into the yard, and then both of them climbed into the cab. A minute later the vehicle started and began to move.\n \u201cShit,\u201d Elena said. She jogged after the truck for a few steps, then broke into a full run. She caught up to it as it reached the road. With her good hand she hauled herself up into the open bed.\n The driver slowed and leaned out her window. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now!\u201d she shouted. \u201cGoing back in!\u201d\n \u201cSo go!\u201d Elena said.\n The driver shook her head. The truck lurched into second gear and rumbled south.\n As they rolled into the city proper it was impossible for Elena to tell where they would find the front line of the battle, or if there was a front line at all. Damage seemed to be distributed randomly. The truck would roll through a sleepy side street that was completely untouched, and twenty yards away the buildings would be cracked open, their contents shaken into the street.\n The drivers seemed to possess some sixth sense for knowing where the injured were waiting. The truck would slow and men and women would emerge from the dark and hobble toward the headlights of the truck, or call for a litter. Some people stood at street corners and waved them down as if flagging a bus. Elena helped the drivers lift the wounded into the back, and sometimes had to force them to leave their belongings.\n \u201cSmall boats,\u201d the largest driver said over and over. A Trovenian saying: In a storm, all boats are too small.\n Eventually she found herself crouched next to a burned dragoon who was half-welded to his jet pack. She held his hand, thinking that might give him something to feel besides the pain, but he only moaned and muttered to himself, seemingly oblivious to her presence.\n The truck slammed a stop, sending everyone sliding and crashing into each other. Through the slats Elena glimpsed a great slab of blue, some huge, organic shape. A leg. A giant\u2019s leg. The U-Man had to be bigger than an apartment building. Gunfire clattered, and a voice like a fog horn shouted something in English.\n The truck lurched into reverse, engine whining, and Elena fell forward onto her hands. Someone in the truck bed cried, \u201cDoes he see us? Does he see us?\u201d\n The truck backed to the intersection and turned hard. The occupants shouted as they collapsed into each other yet again. Half a block more the truck braked to a more gradual stop and the drivers hopped out. \u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d they asked.\n The dragoon beside Elena laughed.\n She stood up and looked around. They were in the residential district, only a few blocks from her apartment. She made her way to the gate of the truck and hopped down. She said to the driver, \u201cI\u2019m not going back with you.\u201d\n The woman nodded, not needing or wanting an explanation.\n Elena walked slowly between the hulking buildings. The pain in her hand, her face, all seemed to be returning.\n She emerged into a large open space. She realized she\u2019d been mistaken about where the truck had stopped\u2014this park was nowhere she recognized. The ground in front of her had been turned to glass.\n The sky to the east glowed. For a moment she thought it was another super-powered UM. But no, only the dawn. Below the dark bulk of Mount Kriegstahl stood the familiar silhouette of the Slaybot Prime bolted to its gantry. The air battle had moved there, above the factories and docks. Or maybe no battle at all. There seemed to be only a few flyers in the air now. The planes and TDs had disappeared. Perhaps the only ones left were U-Men.\n Power bolts zipped through the air. They were firing at the Prime.\n A great metal arm dropped away from its shoulder socket and dangled by thick cables. Another flash of energy severed them. The arm fell away in seeming slow motion, and the sound of the impact reached her a moment later. The \u00fcbermenschen were carving the damn thing up.\n She almost laughed. The Slaybot Prime was as mobile and dangerous as the Statue of Liberty. Were they actually afraid of the thing? Was that why an army of them had shown up for an ordinary hostage rescue?\n My God, she thought, the morons had actually believed Lord Grimm\u2019s boasting.\n She walked west, and the rising sun turned the glazed surface in front of her into a mirror. She knew now that she wasn\u2019t lost. The scorched buildings surrounding the open space were too familiar. But she kept walking. After a while she noticed that the ground was strangely warm beneath her feet. Hot even.\n She looked back the way she\u2019d come, then decided the distance was shorter ahead. She was too tired to run outright but managed a shuffling trot. Reckoning by rough triangulation from the nearest buildings she decided she was passing over Mr. Bojars favorite spot, the corner of Glorious Victory Street and Infinite Progress Avenue. Her own apartment building should have loomed directly in front of her.\n After all she\u2019d seen tonight she couldn\u2019t doubt that there were beings with the power to melt a city block to slag. But she didn\u2019t know what strange ability, or even stranger whim, allowed them to casually trowel it into a quartz skating rink.\n She heard another boom behind her. The Slaybot Prime was headless now. The southern gantry peeled away, and then the body itself began to lean. Elena had been inside the thing; the chest assembly alone was as big as a cathedral.\n The Slaybot Prime slowly bowed, deeper, deeper, until it tumbled off the pillars of its legs. Dust leaped into the sky where it fell. The tremor moved under Elena, sending cracks snaking across the glass.\n The collapse of the prime seemed to signal the end of the fighting. The sounds of the energy blasts ceased. Figures flew in from all points of the city and coalesced above the industrial sector. In less than a minute there were dozens and dozens of them, small and dark as blackcap geese. Then she realized that the flock of \u00fcbermenschen was flying toward her.\n Elena glanced to her left, then right. She was as exposed as a pea on a plate. The glass plain ended fifty or sixty meters away at a line of rubble. She turned and ran.\n She listened to the hiss of breath in her throat and the smack of her heavy boots against the crystalline surface. She was surprised at every moment that she did not crash through.\n Elongated shadows shuddered onto the mirrored ground ahead of her. She ran faster, arms swinging. The glass abruptly ended in a jagged lip. She leaped, landed on broken ground, and stumbled onto hands and knees. Finally she looked up.\n Racing toward her with the sun behind them, the U-Men were nothing but silhouettes\u2014shapes that suggested capes and helmets; swords, hammers, and staffs; bows and shields. Even the energy beings, clothed in shimmering auras, seemed strangely desaturated by the morning light.\n Without looking away from the sky she found a chunk of masonry on the ground in front of her. Then she stood and climbed onto a tilting slab of concrete.\n When the mass of U-Men was directly above her she heaved with all her might.\n Useless. At its peak the gray chunk fell laughably short of the nearest figure. It clattered to the ground somewhere out of sight.\n Elena screamed, tensed for\u2014longing for\u2014a searing blast of light, a thunderbolt. Nothing came. The U-Men vanished over the roof of the next apartment building, heading out to sea.\n Weeks after the invasion, the factory remained closed. Workers began to congregate there anyway. Some mornings they pushed around brooms or cleared debris, but mostly they played cards, exchanged stories of the invasion, and speculated on rumors. Lord Grimm had not been seen since the attack. Everyone agreed that the Savior of Trovenia had been dead too many times to doubt his eventual resurrection.\n When Elena finally returned, eighteen days after the invasion, she found Verner and Guntis playing chess beside the left boot of the Slaybot Prime. The other huge components of the robot\u2019s body were scattered across two miles of the industrial sector like the buildings of a new city.\n The men greeted her warmly. Verner, the ancient mechaneer, frankly noted the still-red cuts that cross-hatched the side of her face, but didn\u2019t ask how she\u2019d acquired them. If Trovenians told the story of every scar there\u2019d be no end to the talking.\n Elena asked about J\u00fcrgo and both men frowned. Guntis said that the birdman had taken to the air during the fight. As for the other two members of the heavy plate welding unit, no news.\n \u201cI was sorry to hear about your brother,\u201d Verner said.\n \u201cYes,\u201d Elena said. \u201cWell.\u201d\n She walked back to the women\u2019s changing rooms, and when she didn\u2019t find what she was looking for, visited the men\u2019s. One cinderblock wall had caved in, but the lockers still stood in orderly rows. She found the locker bearing J\u00fcrgo\u2019s name on a duct tape label. The door was padlocked shut. It took her a half hour to find a cutting rig with oxygen and acetylene cylinders that weren\u2019t empty, but only minutes to wheel the rig to the changing rooms and burn off the lock.\n She pulled open the door. J\u00fcrgo\u2019s old-fashioned, rectangle-eyed welding helmet hung from a hook, staring at her. She thought of Grandmother Zita. What possesses a person to put a bucket on their head?\n The inside of the locker door was decorated with a column of faded photographs. In one of them a young J\u00fcrgo, naked from the waist up, stared into the camera with a concerned squint. His new wings were unfurled behind him. Elena\u2019s mother and father, dressed in their red Gene Corps jackets, stood on either side of him. Elena unpeeled the yellowed tape and put the picture in her breast pocket, then unhooked the helmet and closed the door.\n She walked back to the old men, pulling the cart behind her. \u201cAre we working today or what?\u201d she asked.\n Guntis looked up from the chess board with amusement in his huge wet eyes. \u201cSo you are the boss now, eh, Elena?\u201d\n Verner, however, said nothing. He seemed to recognize that she was not quite the person she had been. Damaged components had been stripped away, replaced by cruder, yet sturdier approximations. He was old enough to have seen the process repeated many times.\n Elena reached into the pockets of her coat and pulled on her leather work gloves. Then she wheeled the cart over to the toe of the boot and straightened the hoses with a flick of her arm.\n \u201cTell us your orders, Your Highness,\u201d Guntis said.\n \u201cFirst we tear apart the weapons,\u201d she said. She thumbed the blast trigger and blue flame roared from the nozzle of the cutting torch. \u201cThen we build better ones.\u201d\n She slid the helmet onto her head, flipped down the mask, and bent to work.\n Originally published in Eclipse 2, edited by Jonathan Strahan.\n Daryl Gregory writes genre-mixing novels, stories, and comics.

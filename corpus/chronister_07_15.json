Asleep, with their bodies buried in the snow and their eyes frozen shut, the helminths look more like landforms than hookworms. But if temperatures rise too much, if they wake up\u2014\n We siphon a lot of blood from their bodies, trying to cure the disease they spread. They wake up hungry and anemic and furious.\n Halfway between Juneau and Circlet, the route I take home, there\u2019s this pile of stones stacked up beside the road. A graveyard for mammoths, according to local legend. In truth, a graveyard for Russian trappers who froze trying to push further north than anyone had before. The monument spooks Alaskans, the descendants of those few Russians who survived the tundra, but I am not Alaskan and I am cold wherever I go and I\u2019m always relieved to see the stones. Up in Circlet, where we built the homestead, the helminths almost never thaw out.\n When I come home, untack my pony, and stomp the snow from my boots, my sister Aliye has a hot bath and a pot of spiced coffee waiting for me: her way of saying sorry that I have to ride out and check the enclosures alone. The first thing she does when I come inside, after she shoves a towel into the crack beneath the doorframe, is check all of my fingertips for frostbite. \u201cRemember that blood-buyer in Anchorage with six-and-a-half fingers?\u201d she says if I argue.\n \u201cI remember,\u201d I say, and spread my tingling fingertips out to the heat of the stove.\n \u201cIf you ever feel like you need me with you,\u201d she says, \u201ctell me, and I\u2019ll go.\u201d\n We both know that Aliye will never go. Before we left Turkey, when we lived among our goats like they were family, the hook stole her legs and half of the muscles in her face. Now she tends the homestead and I look after the animals. We have no other choice. But she has to say it, and I have to act like I believe her.\n \u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cI promise.\u201d\n While we tuck into our coffee, a rich dark brew that Aliye makes with cinnamon and cardamom, she tells me, \u201cWe had a letter this morning.\u201d\n \u201cFrom Baba?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cMom?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not.\u201d In three years, Mom\u2019s never written to us once. \u201cFrom a doctor in Anchorage. I read about him, how he cured all these paralytics on the continent, and then I wrote him. He says he can fix me.\u201d\n I try not to say anything insensitive, like what first comes to my mind: desperation has made you stupid, abla. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him, did you?\u201d\n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He won\u2019t have to know it was the hook.\u201d\n \u201cWhat if he finds out?\u201d\n \u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Aliye says fiercely. \u201cI won\u2019t let him.\u201d\n She can\u2019t make a promise like that, not really. For all she knows, the symptoms of her disease are easily recognizable to a trained physician. No doctor has tended Aliye since Baba first suspected that the hook had passed from our goats to his oldest daughter. The first human host to a parasite like the helminths wouldn\u2019t be treated and released; they\u2019d be quarantined, isolated, possibly put down. Before Aliye, the hook only happened to sheep and goats and cattle. Everyone thought humans were immune.\n Everyone still believes that, but now we know they\u2019re wrong.\n \u201cI heard a story in Juneau today,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAbout a farm family who got some Canadian elk, imported, supposedly better for riding across tundra than horses.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d Aliye already knows the ending to this story; it\u2019s the same ending that most of my Juneau stories have.\n Anything becomes ordinary when it happens enough times in a row.\n \u201cThe helminths destroyed them. Twelve elk, eight thousand rubles a head, dead in a matter of hours.\u201d\n \u201cLike always,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t believe it. It doesn\u2019t seem real.\u201d\n I don\u2019t know how she can form those words with her half-paralyzed mouth. If the hook is real to anyone, it should be real to Aliye.\n Aliye\u2019s physician is a glossy-looking man who comes in a dogsled, not on a pony. He introduces himself as Mikhail Akudaan, explaining that he is half-Ukranian and half-Aleut. His family\u2019s been here forever, he says. Through the days of whales and the days of salmon, now the days of worms. He winks at me midway through each sentence. Beside my sister, with her crutches and half-frozen features, I always end up looking good by comparison.\n While we talk, Aliye makes herself busy at the hotplate, seasoning three ounces of dehydrated meat-stuff with everything on our spice rack. The stuff is more or less irredeemable, but her sense of hospitality keeps her from serving it plain. She\u2019s anxious, her fingers clumsy on the saucepan and the spoon, but probably not for the reasons she should be. She fears the doctor won\u2019t want to help her. I\u2019m afraid he will help her, and the Center for Disease Control will wrest her away from me.\n Dr. Akudaan\u2014\u201cCall me Mikhail, don\u2019t be so formal,\u201d he insists\u2014says the treatment will be a month-long process, two weeks at his facility in Anchorage, where Aliye will have braces of elk-bone grafted to her legs, and then two weeks of rehabilitation here.\n I ask more questions than Aliye does. She\u2019s made up her mind already, but I\u2019m unsure. When Dr. Akudaan has choked down the last piece of his meat-stuff, he pulls a nylon medical gown from his bag and asks if Aliye would mind stripping down for a brief examination. I make my excuses and leave the room. She deserves her privacy. Besides, I hate seeing Aliye\u2019s bare legs. Her face is bad enough; her legs, stick-thin and shriveled, covered in the protective down that every Arctic animal must grow, make me sick.\n Akudaan stays the night; the homestead is too remote for a dinner guest to safely reach any destination before nightfall. While I prepare the couch for him, tucking a spare sheet under the cushions, he watches me, maybe comparing my saddle-sore movements to Aliye\u2019s stilted, jerky ones.\n \u201cYour sister is very eager to move ahead with the procedure,\u201d he tells me.\n \u201cLife is difficult for her, with the palsy,\u201d I say, watching his face to see if he\u2019s guessed what I warned Aliye not to tell him.\n \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe palsy.\u201d And smiles a little. \u201cIs that what the doctors in Turkey believed she had?\u201d\n I swallow my dismay. We shouldn\u2019t have believed we could fool a doctor. \u201cDr. Akudaan, you understand,\u201d I say, \u201chow few choices we had. With the news reports everywhere, and people so scared . . . if they knew she had the hook, they would have killed her.\u201d\n His laughter startles me. \u201cYour sister didn\u2019t have the hook, Hafsa. That\u2019s impossible. The haemonchus contortus only infects ruminants.\u201d\n So we were told, but she still had all the symptoms. Baba frowned over a stack of medical texts written in Arabic, a language he could only read half-passably, and said the worms must have mutated.\n \u201cWhat else explains it then?\u201d I say.\n \u201cAliye had polio. The signs are clear and distinct. Untreated, it often leads to partial or complete paralysis.\u201d\n I don\u2019t tell him that she could have been treated, if we hadn\u2019t hid her, if we hadn\u2019t believed we were saving her life by denying her a doctor. I\u2019m too surprised to feel guilty yet. \u201cDoes she know?\u201d\n \u201cYes. She knows. I told her.\u201d He motions for me to sit down on the couch beside him. I suspect that he\u2019s preparing me for bad news. \u201cThe procedure I do has been proven effective in patients with cerebral palsy, but polio . . . is a different matter. It\u2019s a virus, not a disorder.\u201d\n \u201cI understand.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure you do. The polio virus still lives inside your sister. This procedure will put Aliye at extremely high risk for reinfection.\u201d\n \u201cSo she can\u2019t be fixed?\u201d\n Akudaan purses his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she can\u2019t. In fact, she\u2019s still determined to go ahead with the procedure. But I told her, and I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s medically irresponsible for me to let her do it. Grafting the bones onto her legs means opening her up, doing spinal work\u2014it\u2019s intense, invasive. It will probably kill her.\u201d\n \u201cAnd she knows that?\u201d I say. But even if she does know, I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019ve seen the way Aliye looks at the frontier, flat and frozen but desirable all the same because to her it is forbidden. The loss of what she should have had\u2014what we both should have had\u2014in Turkey, marriage and sunshine and a string of goats for our children to tend, must hurt a hundred times more.\n \u201cShe says she\u2019d rather take the risk than live like this,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cAre you Aliye\u2019s legal guardian, Hafsa?\u201d\n I laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s older than me. I\u2019ve never been her guardian. Just her jailer.\u201d\n \u201cIs that how she sees it?\u201d\n That\u2019s how we both see it, when I\u2019m feeling sympathetic; when I\u2019m not feeling sympathetic, she\u2019s mine. \u201cNeither of us dreamed of becoming worm-farmers, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWe do what we can with what we have. If I had known that what she had was curable, things would be different.\u201d\n Akudaan is quiet for a minute, then says, \u201cSo you can\u2019t do anything to stop her from going forward with this?\u201d\n I\u2019m not sure I would stop Aliye if I could. \u201cHow fast would she degenerate, if she was infected?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cA few months? Probably not more. Possibly less.\u201d\n helminths sleep at every bend along the road I take home; even if she were infected, Aliye\u2019s life expectancy might still be longer than mine. \u201cLet her do it,\u201d I say. \u201cLet her try to get herself back.\u201d\n \u201cAnd the cost won\u2019t be a problem? I understand that helminth-blood is quite valuable, but I don\u2019t know about your family\u2019s particular situation . . . \u201d\n We send more than half of our profits home, like most worm-farmers, but I suspect that Baba won\u2019t mind the loss of his monthly stipend if it means having his oldest daughter restored. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it work,\u201d I tell Dr. Akudaan.\n I\u2019m right, Baba doesn\u2019t mind at all, but across a static-coated phone connection he mentions casually that he has one condition. \u201cIf things go well, Hafsa,\u201d he says, \u201cif she gets her legs back, bring her home.\u201d\n In Anchorage, while Aliye has slices of elk-bone fitted to her calves, I load our sleigh with bulk goods. We won\u2019t need forty pounds of flour or a hundred yards of twine if the procedure succeeds, but Dr. Akudaan warned me that the elk bones might not graft onto Aliye\u2019s bones at all. That outcome would keep Aliye safe from reinfection, but it makes me sick to imagine returning to the homestead for another season of breeding hookworms. I make my shopping list half-heartedly, trying not to think too long about using any of the supplies I purchase.\n Back in her hospital room, giddy with nervousness and half-drunk on painkillers, Aliye can only talk about her legs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll want a pony,\u201d she says, \u201ceven if we\u2019re only here for a few more weeks, it might be worth it. The way you look when you ride, like you can turn all that snow to nothing beneath you. We\u2019ve lived here three years and I still don\u2019t know the countryside, not like I did in Turkey.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to know,\u201d I say, trying to keep her realistic. \u201cIt\u2019s a wasteland, abla. A flat hell full of frozen parasites. You forget because you don\u2019t have to look at it.\u201d\n \u201cDo you envy me that?\u201d She frowns with a little quirk to the mobile side of her mouth. She\u2019s close to tears, angry ones, and I have to choose my next words with care.\n \u201cI don\u2019t envy you,\u201d I say. And looking at my sister, her frail knobby legs swollen with bone grafts, her face half-frozen, her spine stuffed full of dormant polio virus, how could I ever be jealous? But I wish Aliye wouldn\u2019t envy me when I left the same things she did, for her sake instead of my own. \u201cJust remember that legs won\u2019t take care of everything. They won\u2019t bring back our goats, and they won\u2019t get us good marriages.\u201d\n \u201cI wish those were the things I wanted,\u201d Aliye says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t dream like that anymore. I dream smaller, Hafsa. I dream of getting up in the morning and setting my feet flat on the floor.\u201d\n The bone grafts succeed; two weeks later, Aliye walks on shaky new elk-bone legs across the kitchen floor, half of her face stretched wide with smiling. Dr. Akudaan says it\u2019s too early to tell whether she\u2019s at risk of reinfection, not while he\u2019s still prodding at the grafts, integrating them fully into Aliye\u2019s system. She refuses to register his uncertainty, focusing instead on what is certain: she can walk, if a little unsteadily, and she can ride.\n \u201cI want to go with you,\u201d she tells me one morning at the front door. I\u2019m halfway through sliding my chaps over my thighs. If I\u2019d been up a little earlier, even a minute earlier, I could have avoided this. Her coat, stiff with newness, hangs over her thin shoulders. As if she is too little to do it for herself, I reach over and zip it up to her chin.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, abla, aren\u2019t your bones too exposed to the cold?\u201d\n \u201cMikhail says it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n I reach down to lace my boots so my facial expression won\u2019t betray me. I don\u2019t want Aliye with me on the road. I want her safe and bored at home, coating meat-stuff in cumin and wishing we were still in Turkey until the sheer force of her will brought us home. I want her healthy.\n Or, if not healthy, dead enough to let me abandon the farm and go home.\n \u201cDo you really want to?\u201d I say. \u201cThe worms aren\u2019t like our goats. There\u2019s no pleasure in the work. They lay there and breathe or they wake up and try to eat you.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you remember when our rams got loose and fell in the ravine that year? In the hillsides outside Karaman, so far south that the wind sweated. We held a contest to see who could heave the most out of the ditch, roped them like Hollywood cowboys and carried them on our shoulders. You know I\u2019m not weak, Hafsa. Don\u2019t be so unfair.\u201d\n I remember as well as she does. Five years ago, Aliye could tell me to do anything and I\u2019d do it because she was brilliant, she was fearless, to me she mattered more than anyone. I wanted her to approve of me.\n Five years ago I couldn\u2019t find Alaska on a map, didn\u2019t know one species of hookworm from another, certainly couldn\u2019t have taken a syringe to the segments of a helminth\u2019s body and drawn out enough blood to pay the mortgage on a farmstead.\n \u201cIf you want to,\u201d I say.\n \u201cThat\u2019s all I want,\u201d she says, so we go, leaving the remains of breakfast on the stove for Akudaan. Aliye\u2019s new pony is light on his feet, faster than my own horse, who is bored with the road from Circlet. I expect to be bored too, but I\u2019m not. The same landmarks take on new dimensions with Aliye here, admiring chunks of ice and trading posts as if they\u2019re wonders. At the halfway mark, at the mammoth graveyard, Aliye pulls up on her pony\u2019s reins and dismounts.\n I slide down from my pony\u2019s back in a hurry, seeing how shaky she is on her elk-bone legs, and let her grab my shoulder for support. We stand side-by-side, breath fogging the air, as she stares at the pile of stones and the signpost behind them.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a memorial for the Russian trappers,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThey froze to death here.\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d she says. \u201cI forgot about it.\u201d\n I let her stand there for a while. Then I say, \u201cI\u2019m always glad to be past it. Knowing I\u2019ve made it when they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n She smiles, her half-smile that is the fullest one she has, and threads her gloved fingers through mine. \u201cYou did, didn\u2019t you? Strong girl, brave girl, outsmarting the Arctic all by yourself and protecting your invalid sister. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019d do either,\u201d I say, laughing. My throat feels swollen with wanting to cry, and I don\u2019t really know why.\n A week later, Dr. Akudaan tells me that Aliye\u2019s procedure has been a success, her legs will heal completely, she is free to go anywhere she desires. \u201cIf you want to sell the farm, please do,\u201d he urges me. \u201cI can see you\u2019re not happy here.\u201d\n I won\u2019t admit it, not to him and not even to myself, but for a few days, with Aliye mounted up beside me, I was almost happy. \u201cMy father wants me to come home,\u201d I say. \u201cHe wants to see if he can find us decent marriages, now that Aliye is mostly well.\u201d\n The doctor nods a few times too many and looks everywhere but at me. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s reasonable.\u201d\n \u201cI know what you see in the news, about Turkey,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd things are difficult, but all the worm blood being imported is starting to make a difference. They say in five to ten years, we might be able to begin keeping animals again. There\u2019s a species of goat that responds so well to the blood, they almost always survive.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d he says.\n \u201cWhat, then?\u201d\n \u201cAsk your sister,\u201d is all he\u2019ll tell me. \u201cPlease, ask your sister.\u201d\n Now that they have no goats to drive across the countryside, my parents have opened a shoe shop in Ankara. They live a ways down the road from the market where they set up shop, in a stucco house with a roof of red ceramic tile. I paid for that house, I think when I see how fine it is. I would never say that aloud, of course. Baba has to have his pride. We have to feign belief that a shoemaker can afford a home with two balconies and a spacious courtyard.\n When Baba opens the door for us, tears shine in his eyes. The rest of the family crowds him out before he can say much, but I\u2019m glad that our return affects him as much as it does me. In the doorway, looking me over, my sisters remark on how pale and thin I am. I can\u2019t tell if they mean to compliment or insult me with the words. While they scrutinize my earrings, my hair, the way I\u2019ve belted the dress I\u2019m wearing, Aliye lingers at the door behind me, as if she isn\u2019t sure whether she\u2019s welcome. Impatient, I reach for her hand and tug her along. Her elk-bone legs tremble as she follows me into the living room, where Mom pours coffee from a carafe that my worms\u2019 blood paid for.\n \u201cI missed you, Hafsa,\u201d she says, then stares past me at my sister. \u201cAliye.\u201d\n \u201cMama,\u201d Aliye says. She grins with half of her face. I see Baba and Mom simultaneously notice her paralysis. I wonder how they ever forgot. Now they look at her with all the familial warmth of health inspectors, letting their gazes rest too long on her elk-bones before their eyes move to her face.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner with your aunts tonight,\u201d Baba says, after a while.\n \u201cDo they know why we went to Alaska?\u201d I say. I don\u2019t want to let Baba pretend we left Turkey of our own accord, but I don\u2019t think he knows he can stop lying. He and the rest of the family still believe that the hook is what paralyzed Aliye. They\u2019re still worried that she\u2019ll be hunted and killed if anyone finds out that she\u2019s the first human vector. I haven\u2019t found the right time to tell them, figured that should be Aliye\u2019s decision anyway. And Aliye isn\u2019t, so far, saying much of anything.\n \u201cThey know you needed to go,\u201d Mom says. She puts a cup in my hands and nods at the divan, inviting me to sit. Despite her weak legs, Aliye receives no such invitation. I motion for her to sit beside me, equally mortified and confused by our reception here. Baba asked me to take Aliye home. He wanted her back.\n At dinner we eat lamb and beef dishes made with tofu or top-shelf meat-stuff, pretending that nothing has changed when really, we would never be eating together in an Ankara dining room if the world was the same. Whenever the conversation steers too close to the animals that used to be our livelihoods, someone awkwardly maneuvers back to a safer subject. The hook comes up only once.\n \u201cDoes everyone here pretend that it didn\u2019t happen?\u201d I say to Baba later. \u201cDoes Mom?\u201d\n \u201cThere is a difference between not discussing something and not thinking about it,\u201d is all Baba will say. He\u2019s sitting cross-legged on the divan, oiling his loafers, a bottle of shoe polish open on the teak coffee table.\n \u201cBut people must suspect,\u201d I say. \u201cWith the timing, with the symptoms she showed.\u201d\n \u201cStill not dinner conversation,\u201d Baba says, sniffing as he does when he feels he\u2019s being more reasonable than whoever he\u2019s talking to. \u201cHafsa, why did you not mention that your sister is still sick?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cHer face.\u201d He whispers the words like he might get in trouble if he\u2019s too loud.\n I sit down beside him. The conversation seems to demand lowered voices. \u201cThe disease is gone, Baba. It\u2019s left marks, but they\u2019re just that: marks. And the worst of the damage, the paralysis to the legs, is gone. She can live normally now.\u201d\n He looks doubtful. \u201cHow normally do you think she will ever live like that? She won\u2019t find a husband with her face all scowling and crooked.\u201d\n The words aren\u2019t even for me and they still sting. Maybe Aliye was right to hesitate in the doorway of the house. \u201cDoes it matter? What does she stand to inherit if she does marry?\u201d\n \u201cA happy life, an untarnished reputation.\u201d\n \u201cReputation? Is that what Mom cares about?\u201d\n Baba shook his head. \u201cYour maman never wished for Aliye to go. I insisted on it. Losing all your goats in an outbreak like we did, that draws enough eyes, but if your daughter dies of the same symptoms then people ask questions, they suspect you of something.\u201d\n Hearing him talk like that, I can\u2019t keep myself from saying, with something like frustration, \u201cShe didn\u2019t have the hook, Baba.\u201d\n The frown lines on his wind-chapped face deepen. \u201cWhat was it, then?\u201d\n \u201cShe had polio.\u201d\n Baba repeats the English word, polio, then tries in Turkic. \u201cNot a worm?\u201d he says.\n \u201cNot a worm.\u201d\n \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d\n \u201cA doctor from Anchorage examined her.\u201d\n \u201cOh God,\u201d he whispers. \u201cGod, how could we\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re home now,\u201d I say, reaching across Baba\u2019s lap to shut the bottle of shoe polish. The concept of heirloom furniture is entirely lost on my goatherd father. \u201cI\u2019m selling the farm, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go back besides to get things in order. So you don\u2019t have to be sorry.\u201d\n \u201cThree years,\u201d he says. \u201cThree years we were without you.\u201d\n \u201cDo you still want us here? With worm\u2019s blood on our hands, with faces unmarriageable and halfway frozen?\u201d\n \u201cHafsa, it doesn\u2019t matter if they want me,\u201d Aliye says. I turn around and see she\u2019s standing in the doorway. I don\u2019t know how much she heard, or how much she\u2019s hurt by Baba\u2019s bleak view on her future, but she looks determined.\n \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m saying,\u201d she tells me, \u201cthat I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n Home meaning Alaska, I realize, not Turkey. Home meaning the enormous snow-coated bodies of sleeping helminths, home meaning frozen trappers commemorated by piles of stone.\n \u201cI won\u2019t go with you,\u201d I tell her.\n \u201cI know,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to. It\u2019s my home, not yours. Like you said. A place for parasites.\u201d\n Three months after Aliye returns to Circlet, Dr. Akudaan sends a letter telling me that she\u2019s gone. She was a good farmer, he says, like he\u2019s trying to eulogize my own sister for me; she wasn\u2019t killed by the cold or starvation or helminths. He wanted to tell me before we left Alaska that she was dying of reinfection, but Aliye wouldn\u2019t let him.\n Folded into his letter is a check, signed by Aliye. Almost enough to rent my own stucco house in the city, almost enough to import a pair of freshly-immunized goats. On the back of the check, Aliye wrote: I hope this covers three years.\n I don\u2019t feel sorry like she wanted me to, I don\u2019t feel guilty. But I wish I could have laid a stone on the pile for her on the day we rode out to the mammoth graveyard, when she knew already that she would fall while I rode on, that her road ended before mine did, and she would be an elegy, then a story, then forgotten while I recovered from what her tragedy had done to me."}

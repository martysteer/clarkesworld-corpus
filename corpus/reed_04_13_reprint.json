I can make it myself.\u201d The ground was grassy and soft, lit by glowglobes and the grass-colored moon. It wasn\u2019t a difficult walk, even with her bad hip, and she wasn\u2019t an invalid. She could manage, she thought with an instinctive independence. And as if to show them, she struck out ahead of the half-dozen robots as they unloaded the big skimmer, stacking Pico\u2019s gifts in their long arms. She was halfway across the paddock before they caught her. By then she could hear the muddled voices and laughter coming from the hill-like tent straight ahead. By then she was breathing fast for reasons other than her pain. For fear, mostly. But it was a different flavor of fear than the kinds she knew. What was happening now was beyond her control, and inevitable . . . and it was that kind of certainty that made her stop after a few more steps, one hand rubbing at her hip for no reason except to delay her arrival. If only for a moment or two . . .\n \u201cAre you all right?\u201d asked one robot.\n She was gazing up at the tent, dark and smooth and gently rounded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Her life on board the Kyber had been spent with robots\u2014they had outnumbered the human crew ten to one, then more\u2014and she could always be ruthlessly honest with them. \u201cThis is madness. I want to leave again.\u201d\n \u201cOnly, you can\u2019t,\u201d responded the ceramic creature. The voice was mild, unnervingly patient. \u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n \u201cThe technology has been perfected since\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n It stopped speaking, adjusting its hold on the colorful packages.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d she admitted. Then she breathed deeply, holding the breath for a moment and exhaling, saying, \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go. Go.\u201d\n The robot pivoted and strode toward the giant tent. The leading robots triggered the doorway, causing it to fold upward with a sudden rush of golden light flooding across the grass, Pico squinting and then blinking, walking faster now and allowing herself the occasional low moan.\n \u201cEver wonder how it\u2019ll feel?\u201d Tyson had asked her.\n The tent had been pitched over a small pond, probably that very day, and in places the soft, thick grasses had been matted flat by people and their robots. So many people, she thought. Pico tried not to look at any faces. For a moment, she gazed at the pond, shallow and richly green, noticing the tamed waterfowl sprinkled over it and along its shoreline. Ducks and geese, she realized. And some small, crimson-headed cranes. Lifting her eyes, she noticed the large, omega-shaped table near the far wall. She couldn\u2019t count the place settings, but it seemed a fair assumption there were sixty-three of them. Plus a single round table and chair in the middle of the omega\u2014my table\u2014and she took another deep breath, looking higher, noticing floating glowglobes and several indigo swallows flying around them, presumably snatching up the insects that were drawn to the yellow-white light.\n People were approaching. Since she had entered, in one patient rush, all sixty-three people had been climbing the slope while shouting, \u201cPico! Hello!\u201d Their voices mixed together, forming a noisy, senseless paste. \u201cGreetings!\u201d they seemed to say. \u201cHello, hello!\u201d They were brightly dressed, flowing robes swishing and everyone wearing big-rimmed hats made to resemble titanic flowers. The people sharply contrasted with the gray-white shells of the robot servants. Those hats were a new fashion, Pico realized. One of the little changes made during these past decades\n . . . and finally she made herself look at the faces themselves, offering a forced smile and taking a step backward, her belly aching, but her hip healed. The burst of adrenaline hid the deep ache in her bones. Wrestling one of her hands into a wave, she told her audience, \u201cHello,\u201d with a near-whisper. Then she swallowed and said, \u201cGreetings to you!\u201d Was that her voice? She very nearly didn\u2019t recognize it. A woman broke away from the others, almost running toward her. Her big, flowery hat began to work free, and she grabbed the fat, petalish brim and began to fan herself with one hand, the other hand touching Pico on the shoulder. The palm was damp and quite warm; the air suddenly stank of overly sweet perfumes. It was all Pico could manage not to cough. The woman\u2014what was her name?\u2014was asking, \u201cDo you need to sit? We heard . . . about your accident. You poor girl.All the way fine, and then on the last world.Of all the luck!\u201d\n Her hip. The woman was jabbering about her sick hip.\n Pico nodded and confessed, \u201cSitting would be nice, yes.\u201d\n A dozen voices shouted commands. Robots broke into runs, racing one another around the pond to grab the chair beside the little table. The drama seemed to make people laugh. A nervous, self-conscious laugh. When the lead robot reached the chair and started back, there was applause. Another woman shouted, \u201cMine won! Mine won!\u201d She threw her hat into the air and tried to follow it, leaping as high as possible.\n Some man cursed her sharply, then giggled.\n Another man forced his way ahead, emerging from the packed bodies in front of Pico. He was smiling in a strange fashion. Drunk or drugged . . . what was permissible these days? With a sloppy, earnest voice, he asked, \u201cHow\u2019d it happen? The hip thing . . . how\u2019d you do it?\u201d He should know. She had dutifully filed her reports throughout the mission, squirting them home. Hadn\u2019t he seen them? But then she noticed the watchful, excited faces\u2014no exceptions\u2014and someone seemed to read her thoughts, explaining, \u201cWe\u2019d love to hear it firsthand. Tell, tell, tell!\u201d As if they needed to hear a word, she thought, suddenly feeling quite cold. Her audience grew silent. The robot arrived with the promised chair, and she sat and stretched her bad leg out in front of her, working to focus her mind. It was touching, their silence . . . reverent and almost childlike . . . and she began by telling them how she had tried climbing Miriam Prime with two other crew members. Miriam Prime was the tallest volcano on a super-Venusian world; it was brutal work because of the terrain and their massive lifesuits, cumbersome refrigeration units strapped to their backs, and the atmosphere thick as water. Scalding and acidic. Carbon dioxide and water made for a double greenhouse effect. . . . And she shuddered, partly for dramatics and partly from the memory. Then she said, \u201cBrutal,\u201d once again, shaking her head thoughtfully. They had used hyperthreads to climb the steepest slopes and the cliffs. Normally hyperthreads were virtually unbreakable; but Miriam was not a normal world. She described the basalt cliff and the awful instant of the tragedy; the clarity of the scene startled her. She could feel the heat seeping into her suit, see the dense, dark air, and her arms and legs shook with exhaustion. She told sixty-three people how it felt to be suspended on an invisible thread, two friends and a winch somewhere above in the acidic fog. The winch had jammed without warning, she told; the worst bad luck made it jam where the thread was its weakest. This was near the mission\u2019s end, and all the equipment was tired. Several dozen alien worlds had been visited, many mapped for the first time, and every one of them examined up close. As planned.\n \u201cEverything has its limits,\u201d she told them, her voice having an ominous quality that she hadn\u2019t intended. Even hyperthreads had limits. Pico was dangling, talking to her companions by radio; and just as the jam was cleared, a voice saying, \u201cThere . . . got it!\u201d, the thread parted. He didn\u2019t have any way to know it had parted. Pico was falling, gaining velocity, and the poor man was ignorantly telling her, \u201cIt\u2019s running strong. You\u2019ll be up in no time, no problem. . . . \u201d\n People muttered to themselves.\n \u201cOh my,\u201d they said.\n \u201cGosh.\u201d\n \u201cShit.\u201d\n Their excitement was obvious, perhaps even overdone. Pico almost laughed, thinking they were making fun of her storytelling . . . thinking, What do they know about such things? . . . Only, they were sincere, she realized a moment later. They were enraptured with the image of Pico\u2019s long fall, her spinning and lashing out with both hands, fighting to grab anything and slow her fall any way possible\u2014\n \u2014and she struck a narrow shelf of eroded stone, the one leg shattered and telescoping down to a gruesome stump. Pico remembered the painless shock of the impact and that glorious instant free of all sensation. She was alive, and the realization had made her giddy. Joyous. Then the pain found her head\u2014a great nauseating wave of pain\u2014and she heard her distant friends shouting, \u201cPico? Are you there? Can you hear us? Oh, Pico . . . Pico? Answer us!\u201d\n She had to remain absolutely motionless, sensing that any move would send her tumbling again. She answered in a whisper, telling her friends that she was alive, yes, and please, please hurry. But they had only a partial thread left, and it would take them more than half an hour to descend . . . and she spoke of her agony and the horror, her hip and leg screaming, and not just from the impact. It was worse than mere broken bone, the lifesuit\u2019s insulation damaged and the heat bleeding inward, slowly and thoroughly cooking her living flesh.\n Pico paused, gazing out at the round-mouthed faces.\n So many people and not a breath of sound; and she was having fun. She realized her pleasure almost too late, nearly missing it. Then she told them, \u201cI nearly died,\u201d and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cAll the distances traveled, every imaginable adventure . . . and I nearly died on one of our last worlds, doing an ordinary climb. . . . \u201d\n Let them appreciate her luck, she decided. Their luck.\n Then another woman lifted her purple flowery hat with both hands, pressing it flush against her own chest.\n \u201cOf course you survived!\u201d she proclaimed. \u201cYou wanted to come home, Pico! You couldn\u2019t stand the thought of dying.\u201d\n Pico nodded without comment, then said, \u201cI was rescued. Obviously.\u201d She flexed the damaged leg, saying, \u201cI never really healed,\u201d and she touched her hip with reverence, admitting, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the resources on board the Kyber. This was the best our medical units could do.\u201d Her mood shifted again, without warning. Suddenly she felt sad to tears, eyes dropping and her mouth clamped shut.\n \u201cWe worried about you, Pico!\u201d\n \u201cAll the time, dear!\u201d\n \u201c. . . in our prayers . . . !\u201d\n Voices pulled upon each other, competing to be heard. The faces were smiling and thoroughly sincere. Handsome people, she was thinking. Clean and civilized and older than her by centuries. Some of them were more than a thousand years old.\n Look at them! she told herself.\n And now she felt fear. Pulling both legs toward her chest, she hugged herself, weeping hard enough to dampen her trouser legs; and her audience said, \u201cBut you made it, Pico! You came home! The wonders you\u2019ve seen, the places you\u2019ve actually touched . . . with those hands. . . . And we\u2019re so proud of you! So proud! You\u2019ve proven your worth a thousand times, Pico! You\u2019re made of the very best stuff\u2014!\u201d\n \u2014which brought laughter, a great clattering roar of laughter, the joke obviously and apparently tireless. Even after so long.\n They were Pico; Pico was they.\n Centuries ago, during the Blossoming, technologies had raced forward at an unprecedented rate. Starships like the Kyber and a functional immortality had allowed the first missions to the distant worlds, and there were some grand adventures. Yet adventure requires some element of danger; exploration has never been a safe enterprise. Despite precautions, there were casualties. People who had lived for centuries died suddenly, oftentimes in stupid accidents; and it was no wonder that after the first wave of missions came a long moratorium. No new starships were built, and no sensible person would have ridden inside even the safest vessel. Why risk yourself? Whatever the benefits, why taunt extinction when you have a choice.\n Only recently had a solution been invented. Maybe it was prompted by the call of deep space, though Tyson used to claim, \u201cIt\u2019s the boredom on Earth that inspired them. That\u2019s why they came up with their elaborate scheme.\u201d\n The near-immortals devised ways of making highly gifted, highly trained crews from themselves. With computers and genetic engineering, groups of people could pool their qualities and create compilation humans. Sixty-three individuals had each donated moneys and their own natures, and Pico was the result. She was a grand and sophisticated average of the group. Her face was a blending of every face; her body was a feminine approximation of their own varied bodies. In a few instances, the engineers had planted synthetic genes\u2014for speed and strength, for example\u2014and her brain had a subtly different architecture. Yet basically Pico was their offspring, a stewlike clone. The second of two clones, she knew. The first clone created had had subtle flaws, and he was painlessly destroyed just before birth. Pico and Tyson and every other compilation person had been born at adult size. Because she was the second attempt, and behind schedule, Pico was thrown straight into her training. Unlike the other crew members, she had spent only a minimal time with her parents. Her sponsors.Whatever they were calling themselves. That and the long intervening years made it difficult to recognize faces and names. She found herself gazing out at them, believing they were strangers, their tireless smiles hinting at something predatory. The neat white teeth gleamed at her, and she wanted to shiver again, holding the knees closer to her mouth.\n Someone suggested opening the lovely gifts.\n A good idea. She agreed, and the robots brought down the stacks of boxes, placing them beside and behind her. The presents were a young tradition; when she was leaving Earth, the first compilation people were returning with little souvenirs of their travels. Pico had liked the gesture and had done the same. One after another, she started reading the names inscribed in her own flowing handwriting. Then each person stepped forward, thanking her for the treasure, then greedily unwrapping it, the papers flaring into bright colors as they were bent and twisted and torn, then tossed aside for the robots to collect. She knew none of these people, and that was wrong. What she should have done, she realized, was go into the Kyber\u2019s records and memorize names and faces. It would have been easy enough, and proper, and she felt guilty for never having made the effort.\n It wasn\u2019t merely genetics that she shared with these people; she also embodied slivers of their personalities and basic tendencies. Inside Pico\u2019s sophisticated womb, the computers had blended together their shrugs and tongue clicks and the distinctive patterns of their speech. She had emerged as an approximation of every one of them; yet why didn\u2019t she feel a greater closeness? Why wasn\u2019t there a strong, tangible bond here?\n Or was there something\u2014only, she wasn\u2019t noticing it?\n One early gift was a slab of mirrored rock. \u201cFrom Tween V,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhat it doesn\u2019t reflect, it absorbs and reemits later. I kept that particular piece in my own cabin, fixed to the outer wall\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201dgushed the woman.\n For an instant, Pico saw herself reflected on the rock. She looked much older than these people. Tired, she thought. Badly weathered. In the cramped starship, they hadn\u2019t the tools to revitalize aged flesh, nor had there been the need. Most of the voyage had been spent in cold-sleep. Their waking times, added together, barely exceeded forty years of biological activity.\n \u201cLook at this!\u201d the woman shouted, turning and waving her prize at the others. \u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely?\u201d\n \u201cA shiny rock,\u201d teased one voice. \u201cPerfect!\u201d\n Yet the woman refused to be anything but impressed. She clasped her prize to her chest and giggled, merging with the crowd and then vanishing.\n They look like children, Pico told herself.\n At least how she imagined children to appear . . . unworldly and spoiled, needing care and infinite patience. . . .\n She read the next name, and a new woman emerged to collect her gift. \u201cMy, what a large box!\u201d She tore at the paper, then the box\u2019s lid, then eased her hands into the dunnage of white foam. Pico remembered wrapping this gift\u2014one of the only ones where she was positive of its contents\u2014and she happily watched the smooth, elegant hands pulling free a greasy and knob-faced nut. Then Pico explained:\n \u201cIt\u2019s from the Yult Tree on Proxima Centauri 2.\u201dThe only member of the species on that strange little world.\u201cIf you wish, you can break its dormancy with liquid nitrogen. Then plant it in pure quartz sand, never anything else. Sand, and use red sunlight\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know how to cultivate them,\u201d the woman snapped.\n There was a sudden silence, uneasy and prolonged.\n Finally Pico said, \u201cWell . . . good . . .\u201d\n \u201cEveryone knows about Yult nuts,\u201d the woman explained. \u201cThey\u2019re practically giving them away at the greeneries now.\u201d\n Someone spoke sharply, warning her to stop and think.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she responded. \u201cIf I sound ungrateful, I mean. I was just thinking, hoping . . . I don\u2019t know. Never mind.\u201d\n A weak, almost inconsequential apology, and the woman paused to feel the grease between her fingertips.\n The thing was, Pico thought, that she had relied on guesswork in selecting these gifts. She had decided to represent every alien world, and she felt proud of herself on the job accomplished. Yult Trees were common on Earth? But how could she know such a thing? And besides, why should it matter? She had brought the nut and everything else because she\u2019d taken risks, and these people were obviously too ignorant and silly to appreciate what they were receiving.\n Rage had replaced her fear.\n Sometimes she heard people talking among themselves, trying to trade gifts. Gemstones and pieces of alien driftwood were being passed about like orphans. Yet nobody would release the specimens of odd life-forms from living worlds, transparent canisters holding bugs and birds and whatnot inside preserving fluids or hard vacuums. If only she had known what she couldn\u2019t have known, these silly brats . . . And she found herself swallowing, holding her breath, and wanting to scream at all of them. Pico was a compilation, yet she wasn\u2019t.\n She hadn\u2019t lived one day as these people had lived their entire lives. She didn\u2019t know about comfort or changelessness, and with an attempt at empathy, she tried to imagine such an incredible existence. Tyson used to tell her, \u201cShallowness is a luxury. Maybe the ultimate luxury.\u201d She hadn\u2019t understood him. Not really. \u201cOnly the rich can master true frivolity.\u201d Now those words echoed back at her, making her think of Tyson. That intense and angry man . . . the opposite of frivolity, the truth told. And with that, her mood shifted again. Her skin tingled. She felt nothing for or against her audience. How could they help being what they were? How could anyone help their nature? And with that, she found herself reading another name on another unopened box. A little box, she saw. Probably another one of the unpopular gemstones, born deep inside an alien crust and thrown out by forces unimaginable . . . There was a silence, an odd stillness, and she repeated the name.\n \u201cOpera?Opera Ting?\u201d\n Was it her imagination, or was there a nervousness running through the audience? Just what was happening\u2014?\n \u201cExcuse me?\u201d said a voice from the back. \u201cPardon?\u201d People began moving aside, making room, and a figure emerged. A male, something about him noticeably different. He moved with a telltale lightness, with a spring to his gait. Smiling, he took the tiny package while saying, \u201cThank you,\u201d with great feeling. \u201cFor my father, thank you. I\u2019m sure he would have enjoyed this moment. I only wish he could have been here, if only . . .\u201d Father? Wasn\u2019t this Opera Ting?\n Pico managed to nod, then she asked, \u201cWhere is he? I mean, is he busy somewhere?\u201d\n \u201cOh no. He died, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d The man moved differently because he was different. He was young\u2014even younger than I, Pico realized\u2014and he shook his head, smiling in a serene way. Was he a clone? A biological child? What? \u201cBut on his behalf,\u201d said the man, \u201cI wish to thank you. Whatever this gift is, I will treasure it. I promise you. I know you must have gone through hell to find it and bring it to me, and thank you so very much, Pico. Thank you, thank you. Thank you!\u201d\n Death.\n An appropriate intruder in the evening\u2019s festivities, thought Pico. Some accident, some kind of tragedy . . . something had killed one of her sixty-three parents, and that thought pleased her. There was a pang of guilt woven into her pleasure, but not very much. It was comforting to know that even these people weren\u2019t perfectly insulated from death; it was a force that would grasp everyone, given time. Like it had taken Midge, she thought. And Uoo, she thought. And Tyson.\n Seventeen compilated people had embarked on Kyber, representing almost a thousand near-immortals. Only nine had returned, including Pico. Eight friends were lost. . . . Lost was a better word than death, she decided. . . . And usually it happened in places worse than any Hell conceived by human beings. After Opera\u2014his name, she learned, was the same as his father\u2019s\u2014the giving of the gifts settled into a routine. Maybe it was because of the young man\u2019s attitude. People seemed more polite, more self-contained. Someone had the presence to ask for another story. Anything she wished to tell. And Pico found herself thinking of a watery planet circling a distant red-dwarf sun, her voice saying,\n \u201cColdtear,\u201d and watching faces nod in unison. They recognized the name, and it was too late. It wasn\u2019t the story she would have preferred to tell, yet she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself. Coldtear was on her mind.\n Just tell parts, she warned herself.\n What you can stand!\n The world was terran-class and covered with a single ocean frozen on its surface and heated from below. By tides, in part.And by Coldtear\u2019s own nuclear decay. It had been Tyson\u2019s idea to build a submersible and dive to the ocean\u2019s remote floor. He used spare parts in Kyber\u2019s machine shop\u2014the largest room on board\u2014then he\u2019d taken his machine to the surface, setting it on the red-stained ice and using lasers and robot help to bore a wide hole and keep it clear.\n Pico described the submersible, in brief, then mentioned that Tyson had asked her to accompany him. She didn\u2019t add that they\u2019d been lovers now and again, nor that sometimes they had feuded. She\u2019d keep those parts of the story to herself for as long as possible.\n The submersible\u2019s interior was cramped and ascetic, and she tried to impress her audience with the pressures that would build on the hyperfiber hull. Many times the pressure found in Earth\u2019s oceans, she warned; and Tyson\u2019s goal was to set down on the floor, then don a lifesuit protected with a human-shaped force field, actually stepping outside and taking a brief walk.\n \u201cBecause we need to leave behind footprints,\u201d he had argued. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why we\u2019ve come here? We can\u2019t just leave prints up on the ice. It moves and melts, wiping itself clean every thousand years or so.\u201d\n \u201cBut isn\u2019t that the same below?\u201d Pico had responded. \u201cNew muds rain down\u2014slowly, granted\u2014and quakes cause slides and avalanches.\u201d\n \u201cSo we pick right. We find someplace where our marks will be quietly covered. Enshrouded.Made everlasting.\u201d\n She had blinked, surprised that Tyson cared about such things.\n \u201cI\u2019ve studied the currents,\u201d he explained, \u201cand the terrain\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Yet you couldn\u2019t feel certain about Tyson. He was a creature full of surprises. \u201cAll this trouble, and for what\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cTrust me, Pico. Trust me!\u201d\n Tyson had had an enormous laugh. His parents, sponsors, whatever\u2014an entirely different group of people\u2014had purposefully made him larger than the norm. They had selected genes for physical size, perhaps wanting Tyson to dominate the Kyber\u2019s crew in at least that one fashion. If his own noise was to be believed, that was the only tinkering done to him. Otherwise, he was a pure compilation of his parents\u2019\n traits, fiery and passionate to a fault. It was a little unclear to Pico what group of people could be so uniformly aggressive; yet Tyson had had his place in their tight-woven crew, and he had had his charms in addition to his size and the biting intelligence.\n \u201cOh Pico,\u201d he cried out. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about, coming here? If it\u2019s not about leaving traces of our passage . . . then what?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s about going home again,\u201d she had answered.\n \u201cThen why do we leave the Kyber? Why not just orbit Coldtear and send down our robots to explore?\u201d\n \u201cBecause . . .\u201d\n \u201cIndeed! Because!\u201d The giant head nodded, and he put a big hand on her shoulder. \u201cI knew you\u2019d see my point. I just needed to give you time, my friend.\u201d\n She agreed to the deep dive, but not without misgivings.\n And during their descent, listening to the ominous creaks and groans of the hull while lying flat on their backs, the misgivings began to reassert themselves.\n It was Tyson\u2019s fault, and maybe his aim.\n No, she thought. It was most definitely his aim.\n At first, she thought it was some game, him asking, \u201cDo you ever wonder how it will feel? We come home and are welcomed, and then our dear parents disassemble our brains and implant them\u2014\u201d\n \u201cQuiet,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cWe agreed. Everyone agreed. We aren\u2019t going to talk about it, all right?\u201d A pause, then he said, \u201cExcept, I know. How it feels, I mean.\u201d She heard him, then she listened to him take a deep breath from the close, damp air; and finally she had strength enough to ask, \u201cHow can you know?\u201d\n When Tyson didn\u2019t answer, she rolled onto her side and saw the outline of his face. A handsome face, she thought. Strong and incapable of any doubts. This was the only taboo subject among the compilations\u2014\u201dHow will it feel?\u201d\u2014and it was left to each of them to decide what they believed. Was it a fate or a reward? To be subdivided and implanted into the minds of dozens and dozens of near-immortals . . .\n It wasn\u2019t a difficult trick, medically speaking.\n After all, each of their minds had been designed for this one specific goal. Memories and talent; passion and training. All of the qualities would be saved\u2014diluted, but, in the same instant, gaining their own near-immortality. Death of a sort, but a kind of everlasting life, too. That was the creed by which Pico had been born and raised.\n The return home brings a great reward, and peace.\n Pico\u2019s first memory was of her birth, spilling slippery-wet from the womb and coughing hard, a pair of doctoring robots bent over her, whispering to her, \u201cWelcome, child. Welcome. You\u2019ve been born from them to be joined with them when it is time. . . . We promise you . . . !\u201d Comforting noise, and mostly Pico had believed it.\n But Tyson had to say, \u201cI know how it feels, Pico,\u201d and she could make out his grin, his amusement patronizing. Endless.\n \u201cHow?\u201d she muttered. \u201cHow do you know\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cBecause some of my parents . . . well, let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m not their first time. Understand me?\u201d\n \u201cThey made another compilation?\u201d\n \u201cOne of the very first, yes.Which was incorporated into them before I was begun, and which was incorporated into me because there was a spare piece. A leftover chunk of the mind\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re making this up, Tyson!\u201d\n Except, he wasn\u2019t, she sensed. Knew. Several times, on several early worlds, Tyson had seemed too knowledgeable about too much. Nobody could have prepared himself that well, she realized. She and the others had assumed that Tyson was intuitive in some useful way. Part of him was from another compilation? From someone like them? A fragment of the man had walked twice beside the gray dust sea of Plicker, and it had twice climbed the giant ant mounds on Proxima Centauri 2. It was a revelation, unnerving and hard to accept; and just the memory of that instant made her tremble secretly, facing her audience, her tired blood turning to ice.\n Pico told none of this to her audience.\n Instead, they heard about the long descent and the glow of rare life-forms outside\u2014a thin plankton consuming chemical energies as they found them\u2014and, too, the growing creaks of the spherical hull. They didn\u2019t hear how she asked, \u201cSo how does it feel? You\u2019ve got a piece of compilation inside you . . . all right! Are you going to tell me what it\u2019s like?\u201d\n They didn\u2019t hear about her partner\u2019s long, deep laugh.\n Nor could they imagine him saying, \u201cPico, my dear. You\u2019re such a passive, foolish creature. That\u2019s why I love you. So docile, so damned innocent\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDoes it live inside you, Tyson?\u201d\n \u201cIt depends on what you consider life.\u201d\n \u201cCan you feel its presence? I mean, does it have a personality? An existence? Or have you swallowed it all up?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll tell.\u201d Then the laugh enlarged, and the man lifted his legs and kicked at the hyperfiber with his powerful muscles. She could hear, and feel, the solid impacts of his bootheels. She knew that Tyson\u2019s strength was nothing compared to the ocean\u2019s mass bearing down on them, their hull scarcely feeling the blows . . . yet some irrational part of her was terrified. She had to reach out, grasping one of his trouser legs and tugging hard, telling him:\n \u201cDon\u2019t! Stop that! Will you please . . . quit!?\u201d\n The tension shifted direction in an instant.\n Tyson said, \u201cI was lying,\u201d and then added, \u201cAbout knowing. About having a compilation inside me.\u201d And he gave her a huge hug, laughing in a different way now. He nearly crushed her ribs and lungs. Then he spoke into one of her ears, offering more, whispering with the old charm, and she accepting his offer. They did it as well as possible, considering their circumstances and the endless groaning of their tiny vessel; and she remembered all of it while her voice, detached but thorough, described how they had landed on top of something rare. There was a distinct crunch of stone. They had made their touchdown on the slope of a recent volcano\u2014an island on an endless plain of mud\u2014and afterward they dressed in their lifesuits, triple-checked their force fields, then flooded the compartment and crawled into the frigid, pressurized water.\n It was an eerie, almost indescribable experience to walk on that ocean floor. When language failed Pico, she tried to use silence and oblique gestures to capture the sense of endless time and the cold and darkness. Even when Tyson ignited the submersible\u2019s outer lights, making the nearby terrain bright as late afternoon, there was the palpable taste of endless dark just beyond. She told of feeling the pressure despite the force field shrouding her; she told of climbing after Tyson, scrambling up a rough slope of youngish rock to a summit where they discovered a hot-water spring that pumped heated, mineral-rich water up at them.\n That might have been the garden spot of Coldtear. Surrounding the spring was a thick, almost gelatinous mass of gray-green bacteria, pulsating and fat by its own standards. She paused, seeing the scene all over again. Then she assured her parents, \u201cIt had a beauty. I mean it. An elegant, minimalist beauty.\u201d Nobody spoke.\n Then someone muttered, \u201cI can hardly wait to remember it,\u201d and gave a weak laugh. The audience became uncomfortable, tense and too quiet. People shot accusing looks at the offender, and Pico worked not to notice any of it. A bitterness was building in her guts, and she sat up straighter, rubbing at both hips.\n Then a woman coughed for attention, waited, and then asked, \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d Pico searched for her face.\n \u201cThere was an accident, wasn\u2019t there? On Coldtear . . . ?\u201d\n I won\u2019t tell them, thought Pico. Not now. Not this way.\n She said, \u201cNo, not then. Later.\u201d And maybe some of them knew better. Judging by the expressions, a few must have remembered the records. Tyson died on the first dive. It was recorded as being an equipment failure\u2014Pico\u2019s lie\u2014and she\u2019d hold on to the lie as long as possible. It was a promise she\u2019d made to herself and kept all these years.\n Shutting her eyes, she saw Tyson\u2019s face smiling at her. Even through the thick faceplate and the shimmering glow of the force field, she could make out the mischievous expression, eyes glinting, the large mouth saying, \u201cGo on back, Pico. In and up and a safe trip to you, pretty lady.\u201d She had been too stunned to respond, gawking at him.\n \u201cRemember? I\u2019ve still got to leave my footprints somewhere\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d she interrupted.\n He laughed and asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m going to make my mark on this world. It\u2019s dull and nearly dead, and I don\u2019t think anyone is ever going to return here. Certainly not to here.Which means I\u2019ll be pretty well left alone\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYour force field will drain your batteries,\u201d she argued stupidly. Of course he knew that salient fact. \u201cIf you stay here\u2014!\u201d\n \u201cI know, Pico. I know.\u201d\n \u201cBut why\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cI lied before. About lying.\u201d The big face gave a disappointed look, then the old smile reemerged. \u201cPoor, docile Pico. I knew you wouldn\u2019t take this well. You\u2019d take it too much to heart . . . which I suppose is why I asked you along in the first place. . . . \u201d and he turned away, starting to walk through the bacterial mat with threads and chunks kicked loose, sailing into the warm current and obscuring him. It was a strange gray snow moving against gravity. Her last image of Tyson was of a hulking figure amid the living goo; and to this day, she had wondered if she could have wrestled him back to the submersible\u2014an impossibility, of course\u2014and how far could he have walked before his force field failed. Down the opposite slope and onto the mud, no doubt.\n She could imagine him walking fast, using his strength . . . fighting the deep, cold muds . . . Tyson plus that fragment of an earlier compilation\u2014and who was driving whom? she asked herself. Again and again and again.\n Sometimes she heard herself asking Tyson, \u201cHow does it feel having a sliver of another soul inside you?\u201d His ghost never answered, merely laughing with his booming voice.\n She hated him for his suicide, and admired him; and sometimes she cursed him for taking her along with him and for the way he kept cropping up in her thoughts. . . . \u201cDamn you, Tyson. Goddamn you, goddamn you . . . !\u201d\n No more presents remained.\n One near-immortal asked, \u201cAre we hungry?\u201d, and others replied, \u201cFamished,\u201d in one voice, then breaking into laughter. The party moved toward the distant tables, a noisy mass of bodies surrounding Pico. Her hip had stiffened while sitting, but she worked hard to move normally, managing the downslope toward the pond and then the little wooden bridge spanning a rocky brook. The waterfowl made grumbling sounds, angered by the disturbances; Pico stopped and watched them, finally asking, \u201cWhat kinds are those?\u201d She meant the ducks.\n \u201cJust mallards,\u201d she heard. \u201cNothing fancy.\u201d\n Yet, to her, they seemed like miraculous creatures, vivid plumage and the moving eyes, wings spreading as a reflex and their nervous motions lending them a sense of muscular power. A vibrancy. Someone said, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen many birds, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n Of a sort, yes . . .\n \u201cWhat were your favorites, Pico?\u201d\n They were starting uphill, quieter now, feet making a swishing sound in the grass; and Pico told them about the pterosaurs of Wilder, the man-sized bats on Little Quark, and the giant insects\u2014a multitude of species\u2014thriving in the thick, warm air of Tau Ceti I.\n \u201cBugs,\u201d grumbled someone. \u201cUggh!\u201d\n \u201cNow, now,\u201d another person responded.\n Then a third joked, \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to that. Who wants to trade memories?\u201d A joke, thought Pico, because memories weren\u2019t tradable properties. Minds were holographic\u2014every piece held the basic picture of the whole\u2014and these people each would receive a sliver of Pico\u2019s whole self. Somehow that made her smile, thinking how none of them would be spared. Every terror and every agony would be set inside each of them. In a diluted form, of course. The Pico-ness minimized. Made manageable. Yet it was something, wasn\u2019t it? It pleased her to think that a few of them might awaken in the night, bathed in sweat after dreaming of Tyson\u2019s death . . . just as she had dreamed of it time after time\n . . . her audience given more than they had anticipated, a dark little joke of her own. . . . They reached the tables, Pico taking hers and sitting, feeling rather self-conscious as the others quietly assembled around her, each of them knowing where they belonged. She watched their faces. The excitement she had sensed from the beginning remained; only, it seemed magnified now. More colorful, more intense. Facing toward the inside of the omega, her hosts couldn\u2019t quit staring, forever smiling, scarcely able to eat once the robots brought them plates filled with steaming foods. Fancy meals, Pico learned.\n The robot setting her dinner before her explained, \u201cThe vegetables are from Triton, miss. A very special and much-prized strain. And the meat is from a wild hound killed just yesterday\u2014\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cAs part of the festivities, yes.\u201d The ceramic face, white and expressionless, stared down at her. \u201cThere have been hunting parties and games, among other diversions. Quite an assortment of activities, yes.\u201d\n \u201cFor how long?\u201d she asked. \u201cThese festivities . . . have they been going on for days?\u201d\n \u201cA little longer than three months, miss.\u201d\n She had no appetite; nonetheless, she lifted her utensils and made the proper motions, reminding herself that three months of continuous parties would be nothing to these people. Three months was a day to them, and what did they do with their time? So much of it, and such a constricted existence. What had Tyson once told her? The average citizen of earth averages less than one off-world trip in eighty years, and the trends were toward less traveling. Spaceflight was safe only to a degree, and these people couldn\u2019t stand the idea of being meters away from a cold, raw vacuum.\n \u201cCowards,\u201d Tyson had called them. \u201cGutted, deblooded cowards!\u201d Looking about, she saw the delicate twists of green leaves vanishing into grinning mouths, the chewing prolonged and indifferent. Except for Opera, that is. Opera saw her and smiled back in turn, his eyes different, something mocking about the tilt of his head and the curl of his mouth. She found her eyes returning to Opera every little while, and she wasn\u2019t sure why. She felt no physical attraction for the man. His youth and attitudes made him different from the others, but how much different? Then she noticed his dinner\u2014cultured potatoes with meaty hearts\u2014and that made an impression on Pico. It was a standard food on board the Kyber. Opera was making a gesture, perhaps. Nobody else was eating that bland food, and she decided this was a show of solidarity. At least the man was trying, wasn\u2019t he? More than the others, he was. He was.\n Dessert was cold and sweet and shot full of some odd liquor.\n Pico watched the others drinking and talking among themselves. For the first time, she noticed how they seemed subdivided\u2014discrete groups formed, and boundaries between each one. A dozen people here, seven back there, and sometimes individuals sitting alone\u2014like Opera\u2014chatting politely or appearing entirely friendless.\n One lonesome woman rose to her feet and approached Pico, not smiling, and with a sharp voice, she declared, \u201cTomorrow, come morning . . . you\u2019ll live forever . . . !\u201d Conversations diminished, then quit entirely.\n \u201cPlugged in.Here.\u201d She was under the influence of some drug, the tip of her finger shaking and missing her own temple. \u201cYou fine lucky girl . . . Yes, you are . . . !\u201d Some people laughed at the woman, suddenly and without shame.\n The harsh sound made her turn and squint, and Pico watched her straightening her back. The woman was pretending to be above them and uninjured, her thin mouth squeezed shut and her nose tilting with mock pride. With a clear, soft voice, she said, \u201cFuck every one of you,\u201d and then laughed, turning toward Pico, acting as if they had just shared some glorious joke of their own.\n \u201cI would apologize for our behavior,\u201d said Opera, \u201cbut I can\u2019t. Not in good faith, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Pico eyed the man. Dessert was finished; people stood about drinking, keeping the three-month-old party in motion. A few of them stripped naked and swam in the green pond. It was a raucous scene, tireless and full of happy scenes that never seemed convincingly joyous. Happy sounds by practice, rather. Centuries of practice, and the result was to make Pico feel sad and quite lonely.\n \u201cA silly, vain lot,\u201d Opera told her.\n She said, \u201cPerhaps,\u201d with a diplomatic tone, then saw several others approaching. At least they looked polite, she thought. Respectful. It was odd how a dose of respect glossed over so much. Particularly when the respect wasn\u2019t reciprocated, Pico feeling none toward them. . . . A man asked to hear more stories. Please?\n Pico shrugged her shoulders, then asked, \u201cOf what?\u201d Every request brought her a momentary sense of claustrophobia, her memories threatening to crush her. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re interested in a specific world?\u201dOpera responded, saying, \u201cBlueblue!\u201d\n Blueblue was a giant gaseous world circling a bluish sun. Her first thought was of Midge vanishing into the dark storm on its southern hemisphere, searching for the source of the carbon monoxide upflow that effectively gave breath to half the world. Most of Blueblue was calm in comparison. Thick winds; strong sunlight. Its largest organisms would dwarf most cities, their bodies balloonlike and their lives spent feeding on sunlight and hydrocarbons, utilizing carbon monoxide and other radicals in their patient metabolisms. Pico and the others had spent several months living on the living clouds, walking across them, taking samples and studying the assortment of parasites and symbionts that grew in their flesh. She told about sunrise on Blueblue, remembering its colors and its astounding speed. Suddenly she found herself talking about a particular morning when the landing party was jostled out of sleep by an apparent quake. Their little huts had been strapped down and secured, but they found themselves tilting fast. Their cloud was colliding with a neighboring cloud\u2014something they had never seen\u2014and of course there was a rush to load their shuttle and leave. If it came to that.\n \u201cNormally, you see, the clouds avoid each other,\u201d Pico told her little audience. \u201cAt first, we thought the creatures were fighting, judging by their roaring and the hard shoving. They make sounds by forcing air through pores and throats and anuses. It was a strange show. Deafening. The collision point was maybe a third of a kilometer from camp, our whole world rolling over while the sun kept rising, its bright, hot light cutting through the organic haze\u2014\u201d\n \u201cGorgeous,\u201d someone said.\n A companion said, \u201cQuiet!\u201d\n Then Opera touched Pico on the arm, saying, \u201cGo on. Don\u2019t pay any attention to them.\u201d The others glanced at Opera, hearing something in his voice, and their backs stiffening reflexively. And then Pico was speaking again, finishing her story. Tyson was the first one of them to understand, who somehow made the right guess and began laughing, not saying a word. By then everyone was on board the shuttle, ready to fly; the tilting stopped suddenly, the air filling with countless little blue balloons. Each was the size of a toy balloon, she told. Their cloud was bleeding them from new pores, and the other cloud responded with a thick gray fog of butterflylikesomethings. The somethings flew after the balloons, and Tyson laughed harder, his face contorted and the laugh finally shattering into a string of gasping coughs.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d he asked the others. \u201cLook! The clouds are enjoying a morning screw!\u201d Pico imitated Tyson\u2019s voice, regurgitating the words and enthusiasm. Then she was laughing for herself, scarcely noticing how the others giggled politely. No more. Only Opera was enjoying her story, again touching her arm and saying, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely. Perfect. God, precious . . . !\u201d The rest began to drift away, not quite excusing themselves.\n What was wrong?\n \u201cDon\u2019t mind them,\u201d Opera cautioned. \u201cThey\u2019re members of some new chastity faith. Clarity through horniness, and all that.\u201d He laughed at them now. \u201cThey probably went to too many orgies, and this is how they\u2019re coping with their guilt. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n Pico shut her eyes, remembering the scene on Blueblue for herself. She didn\u2019t want to relinquish it.\n \u201cScrewing clouds,\u201d Opera was saying. \u201cThat is lovely.\u201d And she thought.\n He sounds a little like Tyson. In places.In ways.\n After a while, Pico admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t remember your father\u2019s face. I\u2019m sure I must have met him, but I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou did meet him,\u201d Opera replied. \u201cHe left a recording of it in his journal\u2014a brief meeting\u2014and I made a point of studying everything about the mission and you. His journal entries; your reports. Actually, I\u2019m the best-prepared person here today. Other than you, of course.\u201d She said nothing, considering those words.\n They were walking now, making their way down to the pond, and sometimes Pico noticed the hard glances of the others. Did they approve of Opera? Did it anger them, watching him monopolizing her time? Yet she didn\u2019t want to be with them, the truth told. Fuck them, she thought; and she smiled at her private profanity.\n The pond was empty of swimmers now. There were just a few sleepless ducks and the roiled water. A lot of the celebrants had vanished, Pico realized. To where? She asked Opera, and he said:\n \u201cIt\u2019s late. But then again, most people sleep ten or twelve hours every night.\u201d\n \u201cThat much?\u201d\n He nodded. \u201cEnhanced dreams are popular lately. And the oldest people sometimes exceed fifteen hours\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAlways?\u201d\n He shrugged and offered a smile.\n \u201cWhat a waste!\u201d\n \u201cOf time?\u201d he countered.\n Immortals can waste many things, she realized. But never time. And with that thought, she looked straight at her companion, asking him, \u201cWhat happened to your father?\u201d\n \u201cHow did he die, you mean?\u201d\n A little nod. A respectful expression, she hoped. But curious.\n Opera said, \u201cHe used an extremely toxic poison, self-induced.\u201d He gave a vague disapproving look directed at nobody. \u201cA suicide at the end of a prolonged depression. He made certain that his mind was ruined before autodocs and his own robots could save him.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cYet I can\u2019t afford to feel sorry,\u201d he responded. \u201cYou see, I was born according to the terms of his will. I\u2019m 99 percent his clone, the rest of my genes tailored according to his desires. If he hadn\u2019t murdered himself, I wouldn\u2019t exist. Nor would I have inherited his money.\u201d He shrugged, saying, \u201cParents,\u201d with a measured scorn. \u201cThey have such power over you, like it or not.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to respond.\n \u201cListen to us. All of this death talk, and doesn\u2019t it seem out of place?\u201d Opera said, \u201cAfter all, we\u2019re here to celebrate your return home. Your successes.Your gifts. And you . . . you on the brink of being magnified many times over.\u201d He paused before saying, \u201cBy this time tomorrow, you\u2019ll reside inside all of us, making everyone richer as a consequence.\u201d\n The young man had an odd way of phrasing his statements, the entire speech either earnest or satirical. She couldn\u2019t tell which. Or if there was a which. Maybe it was her ignorance with the audible clues, the unknown trappings of this culture. . . . Then something else occurred to her.\n \u201cWhat do you mean? \u2018Death talk . . .\u2019\u201c\n \u201cYour friend Tyson died on Coldtear,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd didn\u2019t you lose another on Blueblue?\u201d\n \u201cMidge. Yes.\u201d\n He nodded gravely, glancing down at Pico\u2019s legs. \u201cWe can sit. I\u2019m sorry; I should have noticed you were getting tired.\u201d\n They sat side by side on the grass, watching the mallard ducks. Males and females had the same vivid green heads. Beautiful, she mentioned. Opera explained how females were once brown and quite drab, but people thought that was a shame, and voted to have the species altered, both sexes made equally resplendent. Pico nodded, only halfway listening. She couldn\u2019t get Tyson and her other dead friends out of her mind. Particularly Tyson. She had been angry with him for a long time, and even now her anger wasn\u2019t finished. Her confusion and general tiredness made it worse. Why had he done it? In life the man had had a way of dominating every meeting, every little gathering. He had been optimistic and fearless, the last sort of person to do such an awful thing. Suicide. The others had heard it was an accident\u2014Pico had held to her lie\u2014but she and they were in agreement about one fact. When Tyson died, at that precise instant, some essential heart of their mission had been lost. Why? she wondered. Why?\n Midge had flown into the storm on Blueblue, seeking adventure and important scientific answers; and her death was sad, yes, and everyone had missed her. But it wasn\u2019t like Tyson\u2019s death. It felt honorable, maybe even perfect. They had a duty to fulfill in the wilderness, and that duty was in their blood and their training. People spoke about Midge for years, acting as if she were still alive. As if she were still flying the shuttle into the storm\u2019s vortex.\n But Tyson was different.\n Maybe everyone knew the truth about his death. Sometimes it seemed that, in Pico\u2019s eyes, the crew could see what had really happened, and they\u2019d hear it between her practiced lines. They weren\u2019t fooled. Meanwhile, others died in the throes of life.\n Uoo\u2014a slender wisp of a compilation\u2014was incinerated by a giant bolt of lightning on Miriam II, little left but ashes, and the rest of the party continuing its descent into the superheated Bottoms and the quiet Lead Sea.\n Opaltu died in the mouth of a nameless predator. He had been another of Pico\u2019s lovers, a proud man and the best example of vanity that she had known\u2014until today, she thought\u2014and she and the others had laughed at the justice that befell Opaltu\u2019s killer. Unable to digest alien meats, the predator had sickened and died in a slow, agonizing fashion, vomiting up its insides as it staggered through the yellow jungle. Boo was killed while working outside the Kyber, struck by a mote of interstellar debris. Xon\u2019slifesuit failed, suffocating her.\n As did Kyties\u2019s suit, and that wasn\u2019t long ago. Just a year now, ship time, and she remembered a cascade of jokes and his endless good humor. The most decent person on board the Kyber. Yet it was Tyson who dominated her memories of the dead. It was the man as well as his self-induced extinction, and the anger within her swelled all at once. Suddenly even simple breathing was work. Pico found herself sweating, then blinking away the salt in her eyes. Once, then again, she coughed into a fist; then finally she had the energy to ask, \u201cWhy did he do it?\u201d\n \u201cWho? My father?\u201d\n \u201cDepression is . . . should be . . . a curable ailment. We had drugs and therapies on board that could erase it.\u201d\n \u201cBut it was more than depression. It was something that attacks the very old people. A kind of giant boredom, if you will.\u201d\n She wasn\u2019t surprised. Nodding as if she\u2019d expected that reply, she told him, \u201cI can understand that, considering your lives.\u201d Then she thought how Tyson hadn\u2019t been depressed or bored. How could he have been either?\n Opera touched her bad leg, for just a moment. \u201cYou must wonder how it will be,\u201d he mentioned.\n \u201cTomorrow, I mean.\u201d\n She shivered, aware of the fear returning. Closing her burning eyes, she saw Tyson\u2019s walk through the bacterial mat, the loose gray chunks spinning as the currents carried them, lending them a greater sort of life with the motion. . . . And she opened her eyes, Opera watching, saying something to her with his expression, and her unable to decipher any meanings.\n \u201cMaybe I should go to bed, too,\u201d she allowed.\n The park under the tent was nearly empty now. Where had the others gone?\n Opera said, \u201cOf course,\u201d as if expecting it. He rose and offered his hand, and she surprised herself by taking the hand with both of hers. Then he said, \u201cIf you like, I can show you your quarters.\u201d She nodded, saying nothing.\n It was a long, painful walk, and Pico honestly considered asking for a robot\u2019s help. For anyone\u2019s. Even a cane would have been a blessing, her hip never having felt so bad. Earth\u2019s gravity and the general stress were making it worse, most likely. She told herself that at least it was a pleasant night, warm and calm and perfectly clear, and the soft ground beneath the grass seemed to be calling to her, inviting her to lie down and sleep in the open.\n People were staying in a chain of old houses subdivided into apartments, luxurious yet small. Pico\u2019s apartment was on the ground floor, Opera happy to show her through the rooms. For an instant, she considered asking him to stay the night. Indeed, she sensed that he was delaying, hoping for some sort of invitation. But she heard herself saying, \u201cRest well, and thank you,\u201d and her companion smiled and left without comment, vanishing through the crystal front door and leaving her completely alone. For a little while, she sat on her bed, doing nothing. Not even thinking, at least in any conscious fashion. Then she realized something, no warning given; and aloud, in a voice almost too soft for even her to hear, she said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t have an idea, the shit.\u201dTyson. She was thinking about the fiery man and his boast about being the second generation of star explorers. What if it was all true? His parents had injected a portion of a former Tyson into him, and he had already known the early worlds they had visited. He already knew the look of double sunrises on the desert world orbiting Alpha Centauri A; he knew the smell of constant rot before they cracked their airlocks on Barnard\u2019s 2. But try as he might\u2014\n \u201c\u2014he couldn\u2019t remember how it feels to be disassembled.\u201d She spoke without sound. To herself.\u201cThat titanic and fearless creature, and he couldn\u2019t remember. Everything else, yes, but not that. And not knowing had to scare him. Nothing else did, but that terrified him. The only time in his life he was truly scared, and it took all his bluster to keep that secret\u2014!\u201d\n Killing himself rather than face his fear.\n Of course, she thought. Why not?\n And he took Pico as his audience, knowing she\u2019d be a good audience. Because they were lovers. Because he must have decided that he could convince her of his fearlessness one last time, leaving his legend secure. Immortal, in a sense.\n That\u2019s what you were thinking . . .\n . . . wasn\u2019t it?\n And she shivered, holding both legs close to her mouth, and feeling the warm misery of her doomed hip.\n She sat for a couple more hours, neither sleeping nor feeling the slightest need for sleep. Finally she rose and used the bathroom, and after a long, careful look through the windows, she ordered the door to open, and stepped outside, picking a reasonable direction and walking stiffly and quickly on the weakened leg.\n Opera emerged from the shadows, startling her.\n \u201cIf you want to escape,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI can help. Let me help you, please.\u201d The face was handsome in the moonlight, young in every fashion. He must have guessed her mood, she realized, and she didn\u2019t allow herself to become upset. Help was important, she reasoned. Even essential. She had to find her way across a vast and very strange alien world. \u201cI want to get back into orbit,\u201d she told him, \u201cand find another starship. We saw several. They looked almost ready to embark.\u201dBigger than the Kyber, and obviously faster. No doubt designed to move even deeper into the endless wilderness.\n \u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Opera told her. \u201cAnd I understand.\u201d She paused, staring at him before asking, \u201cHow did you guess?\u201d\n \u201cLiving forever inside our heads . . . That\u2019s just a mess of metaphysical nonsense, isn\u2019t it? You know you\u2019ll die tomorrow. Bits of your brain will vanish inside us, made part of us, and not vice versa. I think it sounds like an awful way to die, certainly for someone like you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cCan you really help me?\u201d\n \u201cThis way,\u201d he told her. \u201cCome on.\u201d\n They walked for an age, crossing the paddock and finally reaching the wide tube where the skimmers shot past with a rush of air. Opera touched a simple control, then said, \u201cIt won\u2019t be long,\u201d and smiled at her. Just for a moment. \u201cYou know, I almost gave up on you. I thought I must have read you wrong. You didn\u2019t strike me as someone who\u2019d go quietly to her death. . . . \u201d\n She had a vague, fleeting memory of the senior Opera. Gazing at the young face, she could recall a big, warm hand shaking her hand, and a similar voice saying, \u201cIt\u2019s very good to meet you, Pico. At last!\u201d\n \u201cI bet one of the new starships will want you.\u201d The young Opera was telling her, \u201cYou\u2019re right. They\u2019re bigger ships, and they\u2019ve got better facilities. Since they\u2019ll be gone even longer, they\u2019ve been given the best possible medical equipment. That hip and your general body should respond to treatments\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI have experience,\u201d she whispered.\n \u201cPardon me?\u201d\n \u201cExperience.\u201d She nodded with conviction. \u201cI can offer a crew plenty of valuable experience.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019d be idiots not to take you.\u201d\n A skimmer slowed and stopped before them. Opera made the windows opaque\u2014\u201dSo nobody can see you\u201d\u2014and punched in their destination, Pico making herself comfortable.\n \u201cHere we go,\u201d he chuckled, and they accelerated away.\n There was an excitement to all of this, an adventure like every other. Pico realized that she was scared, but in a good, familiar way. Life and death. Both possibilities seemed balanced on a very narrow fulcrum, and she found herself smiling, rubbing her hip with a slow hand.\n They were moving fast, following Opera\u2019s instructions.\n \u201cA circuitous route,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe want to make our whereabouts less obvious. All right?\u201d\n \u201cFine.\u201d\n \u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d she allowed. \u201cBasically.\u201d\n Then she was thinking about the others\u2014the other survivors from the Kyber\u2014wondering how many of them were having second or third thoughts. The long journey home had been spent in cold-sleep, but there had been intervals when two or three of them were awakened to do normal maintenance. Not once did anyone even joke about taking the ship elsewhere. Nobody had asked, \u201cWhy do we have to go to Earth?\u201d The obvious question had eluded them, and at the time, she had assumed it was because there were no doubters. Besides herself, that is. The rest believed this would be the natural conclusion to full and satisfied lives; they were returning home to a new life and an appreciative audience. How could any sane compilation think otherwise?\n Yet she found herself wondering.\n Why no jokes?\n If they hadn\u2019t had doubts, wouldn\u2019t they have made jokes?\n Eight others had survived the mission. Yet none were as close to Pico as she had been to Tyson. They had saved each other\u2019s proverbial skin many times, and she did feel a sudden deep empathy for them, remembering how they had boarded nine separate shuttles after kisses and hugs and a few careful tears, each of them struggling with the proper things to say. But what could anyone say at such a moment?\n Particularly when you believed that your companions were of one mind, and, in some fashion, happy. . . . Pico said, \u201cI wonder about the others,\u201d and intended to leave it at that. To say nothing more.\n \u201cThe others?\u201d\n \u201cFrom the Kyber.My friends.\u201d She paused and swallowed, then said softly, \u201cMaybe I could contact them.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d he responded.\n She jerked her head, watching Opera\u2019s profile.\n \u201cThat would make it easy to catch you.\u201d His voice was quite sensible and measured. \u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201ccan\u2019t they make up their own minds? Like you have?\u201d She nodded, thinking that was reasonable. Sure.\n He waited a long moment, then said, \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to talk about something else?\u201d\n \u201cLike what?\u201d\n He eyed Pico, then broke into a wide smile. \u201cIf I\u2019m not going to inherit a slice of your mind, leave me another story. Tell . . . I don\u2019t know. Tell me about your favorite single place. Not a world, but some favorite patch of ground on any world. If you could be anywhere now, where would it be? And with whom?\u201d\n Pico felt the skimmer turning, following the tube. She didn\u2019t have to consider the question\u2014her answer seemed obvious to her\u2014but the pause was to collect herself, weighing how to begin and what to tell.\n \u201cIn the mountains on Erindi 3,\u201d she said, \u201cthe air thins enough to be breathed safely, and it\u2019s really quite pretty. The scenery, I mean.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve seen holos of the place. It is lovely.\u201d\n \u201cNot just lovely.\u201d She was surprised by her authority, her self-assured voice telling him, \u201cThere\u2019s a strange sense of peace there. You don\u2019t get that from holos. Supposedly it\u2019s produced by the weather and the vegetation. . . . They make showers of negative ions, some say. . . . And it\u2019s the colors, too. A subtle interplay of shades and shadows.All very one-of-a-kind.\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d he said carefully.\n She shut her eyes, seeing the place with almost perfect clarity. A summer storm had swept overhead, charging the glorious atmosphere even further, leaving everyone in the party invigorated. She and Tyson, Midge, and several others had decided to swim in a deep-blue pool near their campsite. The terrain itself was rugged, black rocks erupting from the blue-green vegetation. The valley\u2019s little river poured into a gorge and the pool, and the people did the same. Tyson was first, naturally. He laughed and bounced in the icy water, screaming loud enough to make a flock of razor-bats take flight. This was only the third solar system they had visited, and they were still young in every sense. It seemed to them that every world would be this much fun.\n She recalled\u2014and described\u2014diving feet first. She was last into the pool, having inherited a lot of caution from her parents. Tyson had teased her, calling her a coward and then worse, then showing where to aim. \u201cRight here! It\u2019s deep here! Come on, coward! Take a chance!\u201d The water was startlingly cold, and there wasn\u2019t much of it beneath the shiny flowing surface. She struck and hit the packed sand below, and the impact made her groan, then shout. Tyson had lied, and she chased the bastard around the pool, screaming and finally clawing at his broad back until she\u2019d driven him up the gorge walls, him laughing and once, losing strength with all the laughing, almost tumbling down on top of her.\n She told Opera everything.\n At first, it seemed like an accident. All her filters were off; she admitted everything without hesitation. Then she told herself that the man was saving her life and deserved the whole story. That\u2019s when she was describing the lovemaking between her and Tyson. That night. It was their first time, and maybe the best time. They did it on a bed of mosses, perched on the rim of the gorge, and she tried to paint a vivid word picture for her audience, including smells and the textures and the sight of the double moons overhead, colored a strange living pink and moving fast.\n Their skimmer ride seemed to be taking a long time, she thought once she was finished. She mentioned this to Opera, and he nodded soberly. Otherwise, he made no comment. I won\u2019t be disembodied tomorrow, she told herself.\n Then she added, Today, I mean today.\n She felt certain now. Secure. She was glad for this chance and for this dear new friend, and it was too bad she\u2019d have to leave so quickly, escaping into the relative safety of space. Perhaps there were more people like Opera . . . people who would be kind to her, appreciating her circumstances and desires . . . supportive and interesting companions in their own right. . . .\n And suddenly the skimmer was slowing, preparing to stop.\n When Opera said, \u201cAlmost there,\u201d she felt completely at ease. Entirely calm. She shut her eyes and saw the raw, wild mountains on Erindi 3, storm clouds gathering and flashes of lightning piercing the howling winds. She summoned a different day, and saw Tyson standing against the storms, smiling, beckoning for her to climb up to him just as the first cold, fat raindrops smacked against her face. The skimmer\u2019s hatch opened with a hiss.\n Sunlight streamed inside, and she thought: Dawn. By now, sure . . .\n Opera rose and stepped outside, then held a hand out to Pico. She took it with both of hers and said,\n \u201cThank you,\u201d while rising, looking past him and seeing the paddock and the familiar faces, the green ground and the giant tent with its doorways opened now, various birds flying inside and out again . . . and Pico most surprised by how little she was surprised, Opera still holding her hands, and his flesh dry, the hand perfectly calm.\n The autodocs stood waiting for orders.\n This time, Pico had been carried from the skimmer, riding cradled in a robot\u2019s arms. She had taken just a few faltering steps before half-crumbling. Exhaustion was to blame. Not fear. At least it didn\u2019t feel like fear, she told herself. Everyone told her to take it easy, to enjoy her comfort; and now, finding herself flanked by autodocs, her exhaustion worsened. She thought she might die before the cutting began, too tired now to pump her own blood or fire her neurons or even breathe. Opera was standing nearby, almost smiling, his pleasure serene and chilly and without regrets. He hadn\u2019t said a word since they left the skimmer.\n Several others told her to sit, offering her a padded seat with built-in channels to catch any flowing blood. Pico took an uneasy step toward the seat, then paused and straightened her back, saying, \u201cI\u2019m thirsty,\u201d softly, her words sounding thoroughly parched.\n \u201cPardon?\u201d they asked.\n \u201cI want to drink . . . some water, please . . . ?\u201d\n Faces turned, hunting for a cup and water.\n It was Opera who said, \u201cWill the pond do?\u201d Then he came forward, extending an arm and telling everyone else, \u201cIt won\u2019t take long. Give us a moment, will you?\u201d Pico and Opera walked alone.\n Last night\u2019s ducks were sleeping and lazily feeding. Pico looked at their metallic green heads, so lovely that she ached at seeing them, and she tried to miss nothing. She tried to concentrate so hard that time itself would compress, seconds turning to hours, and her life in that way prolonged. Opera was speaking, asking her, \u201cDo you want to hear why?\u201d She shook her head, not caring in the slightest.\n \u201cBut you must be wondering why. I fool you into believing that I\u2019m your ally, and I manipulate you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d she sputtered. \u201cSo tell me.\u201d\n \u201cBecause,\u201d he allowed, \u201cit helps the process. It helps your integration into us. I gave you a chance for doubts and helped you think you were fleeing, convinced you that you\u2019d be free . . . and now you\u2019re angry and scared and intensely alive. It\u2019s that intensity that we want. It makes the neurological grafts take hold. It\u2019s a trick that we learned since the Kyber left Earth. Some compilations tried to escape, and when they were caught and finally incorporated along with their anger\u2014\u201d\n \u201cExcept, I\u2019m not angry,\u201d she lied, gazing at his self-satisfied grin.\n \u201cA nervous system in flux,\u201d he said. \u201cI volunteered, by the way.\u201d She thought of hitting him. Could she kill him somehow?\n But instead, she turned and asked, \u201cWhy this way? Why not just let me slip away, then catch me at the spaceport?\u201d\n \u201cYou were going to drink,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cDrink.\u201d She knelt despite her hip\u2019s pain, knees sinking into the muddy bank and her lips pursing, taking in a long, warmish thread of muddy water, and then her face lifting, the water spilling across her chin and chest, and her mouth unable to close tight.\n \u201cNothing angers,\u201d he said, \u201clike the betrayal of someone you trust.\u201d True enough, she thought. Suddenly she could see Tyson leaving her alone on the ocean floor, his private fears too much, and his answer being to kill himself while dressed up in apparent bravery. A kind of betrayal, wasn\u2019t that? To both of them, and it still hurt. . . .\n \u201cAre you still thirsty?\u201d asked Opera.\n \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.\n \u201cThen drink. Go on.\u201d\n She knelt again, taking a bulging mouthful and swirling it with her tongue. Yet she couldn\u2019t make herself swallow, and after a moment, it began leaking out from her lips and down her front again. Making a mess, she realized. Muddy, warm, ugly water, and she couldn\u2019t remember how it felt to be thirsty. Such a little thing, and ordinary, and she couldn\u2019t remember it.\n \u201cCome on, then,\u201d said Opera.\n She looked at him.\n He took her arm and began lifting her, a small, smiling voice saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve done very well, Pico. You have. The truth is that everyone is very proud of you.\u201d\n She was on her feet again and walking, not sure when she had begun moving her legs. She wanted to poison her thoughts with her hatred of these awful people, and for a little while, she could think of nothing else. She would make her mind bilious and cancerous, poisoning all of these bastards and finally destroying them. That\u2019s what she would do, she promised herself. Except, suddenly she was sitting on the padded chair, autodocs coming close with their bright, humming limbs; and there was so much stored in her mind\u2014worlds and people, emotions heaped on emotions\u2014and she didn\u2019t have the time she would need to poison herself.\n Which proved something, she realized.\n Sitting still now.\n Sitting still and silent. At ease.

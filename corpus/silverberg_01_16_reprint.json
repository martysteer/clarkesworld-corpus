He lived alone in a splendid sprawling manse overlooking the Klorpentine Sea, a place of parapets and barbicans, loggias and pavilions, embrasures and turrets and sweeping pilasters, admitting only a few intimates to his solitary life. His soul was ever clouded over by a dark depressive miasma, which Puillayne was able to mitigate only through the steady intake of strong drink. For the world was old, nearing its end, its very rocks rounded and smoothed by time, every blade of grass invested with the essence of a long antiquity, and he knew from his earliest days that futurity was an empty vessel and only the long past supported the fragile present. This was a source of extreme infestivity to him. By assiduous use of drink, and only by such use of it, he could succeed from time to time in lifting his gloom, not through the drink itself but through the practice of his art, which was that of poetry: his wine was his gateway to his verse, and his verse, pouring from him in unstoppable superiloquent abundance, gave him transient release from despond. The verse forms of every era were at his fingertips, be they the sonnet or the sestina or the villanelle or the free chansonette so greatly beloved by the rhyme-loathing poets of Sheptun-Am, and in each of them he displayed ineffable mastery. It was typical of Puillayne, however, that the gayest of his lyrics was invariably tinged with ebon despair. Even in his cups, he could not escape the fundamental truth that the world\u2019s day was done, that the sun was a heat-begrudging red cinder in the darkening sky, that all striving had been in vain for Earth and its denizens; and those ironies contaminated his every thought.\nAnd so, and so, cloistered in his rambling chambers on the heights above the metropole of Ghiusz, the capital city of the happy Claritant that jutted far out into the golden Klorpentine, sitting amidst his collection of rare wines, his treasures of exotic gems and unusual woods, his garden of extraordinary horticultural marvels, he would regale his little circle of friends with verses such as these:\nThe night is dark. The air is chill.\nSilver wine sparkles in my amber goblet.\nBut it is too soon to drink. First let me sing.\nJoy is done! The shadows gather!\nDarkness comes, and gladness ends!\nYet though the sun grows dim,\nMy soul takes flight in drink.\nWhat care I for the crumbling walls?\nWhat care I for the withering leaves?\nHere is wine!\nWho knows? This could be the world\u2019s last night.\nMorning, perhaps, will bring a day without dawn.\nThe end is near. Therefore, friends, let us drink!\nDarkness . . . . darkness . . . .\nThe night is dark. The air is chill.\nTherefore, friends, let us drink!\nLet us drink!\n\u201cHow beautiful those verses are,\u201d said Gimbiter Soleptan, a lithe, playful man given to the wearing of green damask pantaloons and scarlet sea-silk blouses. He was, perhaps, the closest of Puillayne\u2019s little band of companions, antithetical though he was to him in the valence of his nature. \u201cThey make me wish to dance, to sing\u2014and also . . . \u201d Gimbiter let the thought trail off, but glanced meaningfully to the sideboard at the farther end of the room.\n\u201cYes, I know. And to drink.\u201d\nPuillayne rose and went to the great sideboard of black candana over-painted with jagged lines of orpiment and gamboge and flake blue in which he kept the wines he had chosen for the present week. For a moment, he hesitated among the tight-packed row of flasks. Then his hand closed on the neck of one fashioned from pale-violet crystal, through which a wine of radiant crimson glowed with cheery insistence.\n\u201cOne of my best,\u201d he announced. \u201cA claret, it is, of the Scaumside vineyard in Ascolais, waiting forty years for this night. But why let it wait longer? There may be no later chances.\u201d\n\u201cAs you have said, Puillayne. \u2018This could be the world\u2019s last night.\u2019 But why, then, do you still disdain to open Erzuine Thale\u2019s True Vintage? By your own argument, you should seize upon it while opportunity yet remains. And yet you refuse.\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Puillayne said, smiling gravely, and glancing toward the cabinet of embossed doors where that greatest of all wines slept behind barriers of impenetrable spells, \u201cThis may, after all, not be the world\u2019s last night, for none of the fatal signs have made themselves apparent yet. The True Vintage deserves only the grandest of occasions. I shall wait a while longer to broach it. But the wine I have here is itself no trifle. Observe me now.\u201d\nHe set out a pair of steep transparent goblets rimmed with purple gold, murmured the word to the wine-flask that unsealed its stopper, and held it aloft to pour. As the wine descended into the goblet it passed through a glorious spectrum of transformation, now a wild scarlet, now deep crimson, now carmine, mauve, heliotrope shot through with lines of topaz, and, as it settled to its final hue, a magnificent coppery gold. \u201cCome,\u201d said Puillayne, and led his friend to the viewing-platform overlooking the bay, where they stood side by side, separated by the great vase of black porcelain that was one of Puillane\u2019s most cherished treasures, in which a porcelain fish of the same glossy black swam insolently in the air.\nNight had just begun to fall. The feeble red sun hovered precariously over the western sea. Fierce eye-stabbing stars already blazed furiously out of the dusky sky to north and south of it, arranging themselves in the familiar constellations, the Hoary Nimbus, the Panoply of Swords, the Cloak of Cantenax, the Claw. The twilight air was cooling swiftly. Even here in this land of the far south, sheltered by the towering Kelpusar range from the harsh winds that raked Almery and the rest of Grand Motholam, there was no escape from the chill of the night. Everywhere, even here, such modest daily warmth as the sun afforded fled upward through the thinning air the moment that faint light was withdrawn.\nPuillayne and Gimbiter were silent a time, savoring the power of the wine, which penetrated subtly, reaching from one region of their souls to the next until it fastened on the heart. For Puillayne, it was the fifth wine of the day, and he was well along in the daily defeat of his innate somberness of spirit, having brought himself to the outer borderlands of the realm of sobriety. A delightful gyroscopic instability now befuddled his mind. He had begun with a silver wine of Kauchique flecked with molecules of gold, then had proceeded to a light ruby wine of the moorlands, a sprightly sprezzogranito from Cape Thaumissa, and, finally, a smooth but compelling dry Harpundium as a prelude to this venerable grandissimus that he currently was sharing with his friend. That progression was a typical one for him. Since early manhood he had rarely passed a waking hour without a goblet in his hand.\n\u201cHow beautiful this wine is,\u201d said Gimbiter finally.\n\u201cHow dark the night,\u201d said Puillayne. For even now he could not escape the essentially rueful cast of his thoughts.\n\u201cForget the darkness, dear friend, and enjoy the beauty of the wine. But no: they are forever mingled for you, are they not, the darkness and the wine. The one encircles the other in ceaseless chase.\u201d\nThis far south, the sun plunged swiftly below the horizon. The ferocity of the starlight was remorseless now. The two men sipped thoughtfully.\nGimbiter said, after a further span of silence, \u201cDo you know, Puillayne, that strangers are in town asking after you?\u201d\n\u201cStrangers, indeed? And asking for me?\u201d\n\u201cThree men from the north. Uncouth-looking ones. I have this from my gardener, who tells me that they have been making inquiries of your gardener.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Puillayne, with no great show of interest.\n\u201cThey are a nest of rogues, these gardeners. They all spy on us, and sell our secrets to any substantial bidder.\u201d\n\u201cYou tell me no news here, Gimbiter.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it not concern you that rough-hewn strangers are asking questions?\u201d\nPuillayne shrugged. \u201cPerhaps they are admirers of my verses, come to hear me recite.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps they are thieves, come from afar to despoil you of some of your fabled treasures.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps they are both. In that case, they must hear my verses before I permit any despoiling.\u201d\n\u201cYou are very casual, Puillayne.\u201d\n\u201cFriend, the sun itself is dying as we stand here. Shall I lose sleep over the possibility that strangers may take some of my trinkets from me? With such talk you distract us from this unforgettable wine. I beg you, drink, Gimbiter, and put these strangers out of your mind.\u201d\n\u201cI can put them from mine,\u201d said Gimbiter, \u201cbut I wish you would devote some part of yours to them.\u201d And then he ceased to belabor the point, for he knew that Puillayne was a man utterly without fear. The profound bleakness that lay at the core of his spirit insulated him from ordinary cares. He lived without hope and therefore without uneasiness. And by this time of day, Gimbiter understood, Puillayne had further reinforced himself within an unbreachable palisade of wine.\nThe three strangers, though, were troublesome to Gimbiter. He had gone to the effort of inspecting them himself earlier that day. They had taken lodgings, said his head gardener, at the old hostelry called the Blue Wyvern, between the former ironmongers\u2019 bazaar and the bazaar of silk and spices, and it was easy enough for Gimbiter to locate them as they moved along the boulevard that ran down the spine of the bazaar quarter. One was a squat, husky man garbed in heavy brown furs, with purple leather leggings and boots, and a cap of black bearskin trimmed with a fillet of gold. Another, tall and loose-limbed, sported a leopard-skin tarboosh, a robe of yellow muslin, and red boots ostentatiously spurred with the spines of the roseate urchin. The third, clad unpretentiously in a simple gray tunic and a quilted green mantle of some coarse heavy fabric, was of unremarkable stature and seemed all but invisible beside his two baroque confederates, until one noticed the look of smoldering menace in his deep-set, resolute, reptilian eyes, set like obsidian ellipsoids against his chalky-hued face.\nGimbiter made such inquiries about them at the hostelry as were feasible, but all he could learn was that they were mercantile travelers from Hither Almery or even farther north, come to the southlands on some enterprise of profit. But even the innkeeper knew that they were aware of the fame of the metropole\u2019s great poet Puillayne, and were eager to achieve an audience with him. And therefore Gimbiter had duly provided his friend with a warning; but he was sadly aware that he could do no more than that.\nNor was Puillayne\u2019s air of unconcern an affectation. One who has visited the mephitic shores of the Sea of Nothingness and returned is truly beyond all dismay. He knows that the world is an illusion built upon a foundation of mist and wind, and that it is great folly to attach oneself in any serious way to any contrary belief. During his more sober moments, of course, Puillayne of Ghiusz was as vulnerable to despair and anxiety as anyone else; but he took care to reach with great speed for his beloved antidote the instant that he felt tendrils of reality making poisonous incursions through his being. But for wine, he would have had no escape from his eternally sepulchral attitudinizing.\nSo the next day, and the next, days that were solitary by choice for him, Puillayne moved steadfastly through his palace of antiquarian treasures on his usual diurnal rounds, rising at day-break to bathe in the spring that ran through his gardens, then breakfasting on his customary sparse fare, then devoting an hour to the choice of the day\u2019s wines and sampling the first of them.\nIn mid-morning, as the glow of the first flask of wine still lingered in him, he sat sipping the second of the day and reading awhile from some volume of his collected verse. There were fifty or sixty of them by now, bound identically in the black vellum made from the skin of fiendish Deodands that had been slaughtered for the bounty placed upon such fell creatures; and these were merely the poems that he had had sufficient sobriety to remember to indite and preserve, out of the scores that poured from him so freely. Puillayne constantly read and reread them with keen pleasure. Though he affected modesty with others, within the shelter of his own soul he had an unabashed admiration for his poems, which the second wine of the day invariably amplified.\nAfterward, before the second wine\u2019s effect had completely faded, it was his daily practice to stroll through the rooms that held his cabinet of wonders, inspecting with ever-fresh delight the collection of artifacts and oddities that he had gathered during youthful travels that had taken him as far north as the grim wastes of Fer Aquila, as far to the east as the monster-infested deadlands beyond the Land of the Falling Wall. Where ghouls and deadly grues swarmed and thrived, as far west as ruined Ampridatvir and sullen Azederach on the sunset side of the black Supostimon Sea. In each of these places, the young Puillayne had acquired curios, not because the assembling of them had given him any particular pleasure in and of itself, but because the doing of it turned his attention for the moment, as did the drinking of wine, from the otherwise inescapable encroachment of gloom that from boyhood on had perpetually assailed his consciousness. He drew somber amusement now from fondling these things, which recalled to him some remote place he had visited, summoning up memories of great beauty and enchanting peace, or arduous struggle and biting discomfort, it being a matter of no importance to him which it might have been, so long as the act of remembering carried him away from the here and now.\nThen he would take his lunch, a repast scarcely less austere than his morning meal had been, always accompanying it by some third wine chosen for its soporific qualities. A period of dozing invariably followed, and then a second cooling plunge in the garden spring, and then\u2014it was a highlight of the day\u2014the ceremonial opening of the fourth flask of wine, the one that set free his spirit and allowed the composition of that day\u2019s verses. He scribbled down his lines with haste, never pausing to revise, until the fervor of creation had left him. Once more, then, he read, or uttered the simple spell that filled his bayside audifactorium with music. Then came dinner, a more notable meal than the earlier two, one that would do justice to the fifth and grandest wine of the day, in the choosing of which he had devoted the greatest of care; and then, hoping as ever that the dying sun might perish in the night and release him at last from his funereal anticipations, he gave himself to forlorn dreamless sleep.\nSo it passed for the next day, and the next, and, on the third day after Gimbiter Soleptan\u2019s visit, the three strangers of whom Gimbiter had warned him presented themselves at last at the gates of his manse.\nThey selected for their unsolicited intrusion the hour of the second wine, arriving just as he had taken one of the vellum-bound volumes of his verse from its shelf. Puillayne maintained a small staff of wraiths and revenants for his household needs, disliking as he did the use of living beings as domestic subordinates, and one of these pallid eidolons came to him with news of the visitors.\nPuillayne regarded the ghostly creature, which just then was hovering annoyingly at the borders of transparency as though attempting to communicate its own distress, with indifference. \u201cTell them they are welcome. Admit them upon the half hour.\u201d\nIt was far from his usual custom to entertain visitors during the morning hours. The revenant was plainly discommoded by this surprising departure from habit. \u201cLordship, if one may venture to express an opinion\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne may not. Admit them upon the half hour.\u201d\nPuillayne used the interval until then to deck himself in formal morning garb: a thin tunic of light color, a violet mantle, laced trousers of the same color worn over underdrawers of deep red, and, above all the rest, a stiff unlined garment of a brilliant white. He had already selected a chilled wine from the Bay of Sanreale, a brisk vintage of a shimmering metallic-gray hue, for his second wine; now he drew forth a second flask of it and placed it beside the first. The house-wraith returned, precisely upon the half hour, with Puillayne\u2019s mysterious guests.\nThey were, exactly as Gimbiter Soleptan had opined, a rough-hewn, uncouth lot. \u201cI am Kesztrel Tsaye,\u201d announced the shortest of the three, who seemed to be the dominant figure: a burly person wrapped in the thick shaggy fur of some wild beast, and topped with a gold-trimmed cap of a different, glossier fur. His dense black beard encroached almost completely on his blunt, unappealing features, like an additional shroud of fur. \u201cThis is Unthan Vyorn\u201d\u2014a nod toward a lanky, insolent-looking fellow in a yellow robe, flamboyantly baroque red boots, and an absurd betasseled bit of headgear that displayed a leopard\u2019s spots\u2014\u201cand this,\u201d he said, glancing toward a third man, pale and unremarkably garbed, notable mainly for an appearance of extreme inconsequence bordering on nonpresence, but for his eyes, which were cold and brooding, \u201cis Malion Gainthrust. We three are profound admirers of your great art, and have come from our homes in the Maurenron foothills to express our homage.\u201d\n\u201cI can barely find words to convey the extreme delight I experience now, as I stand in the very presence of Puillayne of Ghiusz,\u201d said lanky Unthan Vyorn in a disingenuously silken voice with just the merest hint of sibilance.\n\u201cIt seems to me that you are capable of finding words readily enough,\u201d Puillayne observed. \u201cBut perhaps you mean only a conventional abnegation. Will you share my wine with me? At this hour of the morning, I customarily enjoy something simple, and I have selected this Sanreale.\u201d\nHe indicated the pair of rounded gray flasks. But from the depths of his furs, Kesztrel Tsaye drew two globular green flasks of his own and set them on the nearby table. \u201cNo doubt your choice is superb, master. But we are well aware of your love of the grape, and among the gifts we bring to you are these carboys of our own finest vintage, the celebrated azure ambrosia of the Maurenrons, with which you are, perhaps, unfamiliar, and which will prove an interesting novelty to your palate.\u201d\nPuillayne had not, in truth, ever tasted the so-called ambrosia of the Maurenrons, but he understood it to be an acrid and deplorable stuff, fit only for massaging cramped limbs. Yet he maintained an affable cordiality, studiously examining the nearer of the two carboys, holding it to the light, hefting it as though to determine the specific gravity of its contents. \u201cThe repute of your wines is not unknown to me,\u201d he said diplomatically. \u201cBut I propose we set these aside for later in the day, since, as I have explained, I prefer only a light wine before my midday meal, and perhaps the same is true of you.\u201d He gave them an inquisitive look. They made no objection; and so he murmured the spell of opening and poured out a ration of the Sanreale for each of them and himself.\nBy way of salute, Unthan Vyorn offered a quotation from one of Puillayne\u2019s best-known little pieces:\nWhat is our world? It is but a boat\nThat breaks free at sunset, and drifts away\nWithout a trace.\nHis intonation was vile, his rhythm was uncertain, but at least he had managed the words accurately, and Puillayne supposed that his intentions were kindly. As he sipped his wine, he studied this odd trio with detached curiosity. They seemed like crude ruffians, but perhaps their unpolished manner was merely the typical style of the people of the Maurenrons, a locality to which his far-flung travels had never taken him. For all he knew, they were dukes or princes or high ministers of that northern place. He wondered in an almost incurious way what it was that they wanted with him. Merely to quote his own poetry to him was an insufficient motive for traveling such a distance. Gimbiter believed that they were malevolent; and it might well be that Gimbiter, a shrewd observer of mankind, was correct in that. For the nonce, however, his day\u2019s intake of wine had fortified him against anxiety on that score. To Puillayne, they were at the moment merely a puzzling novelty. He would wait to see more.\n\u201cYour journey,\u201d he said politely, \u201cwas it a taxing one?\u201d\n\u201cWe know some small magics, and we had a few useful spells to guide us. Going through the Kelpusars, there was only one truly difficult passage for us,\u201d said Unthan Vyorn, \u201cwhich was the crossing of the Mountain of the Eleven Uncertainties.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Puillayne. \u201cI know it well.\u201d It was a place of bewildering confusion, where a swarm of identical peaks confronted the traveler and all roads seemed alike, though only one was correct and the others led into dire unpleasantness. \u201cBut you found your way through, evidently, and coped with equal deftness with the Gate of Ghosts just beyond, and the perilous Pillars of Yan Sfou.\u201d\n\u201cThe hope of attaining the very place where now we find ourselves drew us onward through all obstacles,\u201d Unthan Vyorn said, outdoing even himself in unctuosity of tone. And again he quoted Puillayne:\nThe mountain roads we traveled rose ten thousand cilavers high.\nThe rivers we crossed were more turbulent than a hundred demons.\nAnd our voices were lost in the thunder of the cataracts.\nWe cut through brambles that few swords could slash.\nAnd then beyond the mists we saw the golden Klorpentine\nAnd it was as if we had never known hardship at all.\nHow barbarously he attacked the delicate lines! How flat was his tone as he came to the ecstatic final couplet! But Puillayne masked his scorn. These were foreigners; they were his guests, however self-invited they might be; his responsibility was to maintain them at their ease. And he found them diverting, in their way. His life in these latter years had slipped into inflexible routine. The advent of poetry-quoting northern barbarians was an amusing interlude in his otherwise constricted days. He doubted more than ever, now, Gimbiter\u2019s hypothesis that they meant him harm. There seemed nothing dangerous about these three except, perhaps, the chilly eyes of the one who did not seem to speak. His friend Gimbiter evidently had mistaken bumptiousness for malversation and malefic intent.\nFur-swathed Kesztrel Tsaye said, \u201cWe know, too, that you are a collector of exotica. Therefore we bring some humble gifts for your delight.\u201d And he, too, offered a brief quotation:\nLet me have pleasures in this life\nFor the next is a dark abyss!\n\u201cIf you will, Malion Gainthrust\u2014\u201d\nKesztrel Tsaye nodded to the icy-eyed silent man, who produced from somewhere a sack that Puillayne had not previously noticed, and drew from it a drum of red candana covered with taut-stretched thaupin-hide, atop which nine red-eyed homunculi performed an obscene dance. This was followed by a little sphere of green chalcedony out of which a trapped and weeping demon peered, and that by a beaker which overflowed with a tempting aromatic yellow liquid that tumbled to the floor and rose again to return to the vessel from which it had come. Other small toys succeeded those, until gifts to the number of ten or twelve sat arrayed before Puillayne.\nDuring this time, Puillayne had consumed nearly all the wine from the flask he had reserved for himself, and he felt a cheering dizziness beginning to steal over him. The three visitors, though he had offered them only a third as much apiece, had barely taken any. Were they simply abstemious? Or was the shimmering wine of Sanreale too subtle for their jackanapes palates?\nHe said, when it appeared that they had exhausted their display of gewgaws for him, \u201cIf this wine gives you little gratification, I can select another and perhaps superior one for you, or we could open that which you have brought me.\u201d\n\u201cIt is superb wine, master,\u201d Unthan Vyorn said, \u201cand we would expect no less from you. We know, after all, that your cellar is incomparable, that it is a storehouse of the most treasured wines of all the world, that in fact it contains even the unobtainable wine prized beyond all others, the True Vintage of Erzuine Thale. This Sanreale wine you have offered us is surely not in a class with that; but it has much merit in its own way and if we drink it slowly, it is because we cherish every swallow we take. Simply to be drinking the wine of Puillayne of Ghiusz in the veritable home of Puillayne of Ghiusz is an honor so extreme that it constringes our throats with joy, and compels us to drink more slowly than otherwise we might.\u201d\n\u201cYou know of the True Vintage, do you?\u201d Puillayne asked.\n\u201cIs there anyone who does not? The legendary wine of the Nolwaynes who have reigned in Gammelcor since the days when the sun had the brightness of gold\u2014the wine of miracles, the wine that offers the keenest of ecstasies that it is possible to experience\u2014the wine that opens all doors to one with a single sip\u2014\u201d Unshielded covetousness now gleamed in the lanky man\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf only we could enjoy that sip! Ah, if only we could merely have a glimpse of the container that holds that wondrous elixir!\u201d\n\u201cI rarely bring it forth, even to look at it,\u201d said Puillayne. \u201cI fear that if I were to take it from its place of safekeeping, I would be tempted to consume it prematurely, and that is not a temptation to which I am ready to yield.\u201d\n\u201cA man of iron!\u201d marveled Kesztrel Tsaye. \u201cTo possess the True Vintage of Erzuine Thale, and to hold off from sampling it! And why, may I ask, do you scruple to deny yourself that joy of joys?\u201d\nIt was a question Puillayne had heard many times before, for his ownership of the True Vintage was not something he had concealed from his friends. \u201cI am, you know, a prodigious scribbler of minor verse. Yes,\u201d he said, over their indignant protests, \u201cminor verse, such a torrent of it that it would fill this manse a dozen times over if I preserved it all. I keep only a small part.\u201d He gestured moodily at the fifty volumes bound in Deodand vellum. \u201cBut somewhere within me lurks the one great poem that will recapitulate all the striving of earthly history, the epic that will be the sum and testament of us who live as we do on the precipice at the edge of the end of days. Someday I will feel that poem brimming at the perimeters of my brain and demanding release. That feeling will come, I think, when our sun is in its ultimate extremity, and the encroaching darkness is about to arrive. And then, only then, will I broach the seal on the True Vintage, and quaff the legendary wine, which indeed opens all doors, including the door of creation, so that its essence will liberate the real poet within me, and in my final drunken joy I will be permitted to set down that one great poem that I yearn to write.\u201d\n\u201cYou do us all an injustice, master, if you wait to write that epic until the very eve of our doom,\u201d said Unthan Vyorn in a tone of what might almost have been sorrow sincerely framed. \u201cFor how will we be able to read it, when all has turned to ice and darkness? No poems will circulate among us as we lie there perishing in the final cold. You deny us your greatness! You withhold your gift!\u201d\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Puillayne said, \u201cthe time is not yet for opening that bottle. But I can offer you others.\u201d\nFrom his cabinet, he selected a generous magnum of ancient Falernian, which bore a frayed label, yellowed and parched by time. The great rounded flask lacked its seal and it was obvious to all that the container was empty save for random crusts of desiccated dregs scattered about its interior. His visitors regarded it with puzzlement. \u201cFear not,\u201d said Puillayne. \u201cA mage of my acquaintance made certain of my bottles subject to the Spell of Recrudescent Fluescence, among them this one. It is inexhaustibly renewable.\u201d\nHe turned his head aside and gave voice to the words, and, within moments, miraculous liquefaction commenced. While the magnum was filling, he summoned a new set of goblets, which he filled near to brimming for his guests and himself.\n\u201cIt is a wondrous wine,\u201d said Kesztrel Tsaye after a sip or two. \u201cYour hospitality knows no bounds, master.\u201d Indeed, such parts of his heavily bearded face that were visible were beginning to show a ruddy radiance. Unthan Vyorn likewise displayed the effects of the potent stuff, and even the taciturn Malion Gainthrust, sitting somewhat apart as though he had no business in this room, seemed to evince some reduction of his habitual glower.\nPuillayne smiled benignly, sat back, let tranquility steal over him. He had not expected to be drinking the Falernian today, for it was a forceful wine, especially at this early hour. But he saw no harm in somewhat greater midday intoxication than he habitually practiced. Why, he might even find himself producing verse some hours earlier than usual. These uncouth disciples of his would probably derive some pleasure from witnessing the actual act of creation. Meanwhile, sipping steadily, he felt the walls around him beginning to sway and glide, and he ascended within himself in a gradual way until he felt himself to be floating slightly outside and above himself, a spectator of his own self, with something of a pleasant haze enveloping his mind.\nSomewhat surprisingly, his guests, gathered now in a circle about him, appeared to be indulging in a disquisition on the philosophy of criminality.\nKesztrel Tsaye offered the thought that the imminence of the world\u2019s demise freed one from all the restraints of law, for it mattered very little how one behaved if shortly all accounts were to be settled with equal finality. \u201cI disagree,\u201d said Unthan Vyorn. \u201cWe remain responsible for our acts, since, if they transgress against statute and custom, they may in truth hasten the end that threatens us.\u201d\nInterposing himself in their conversation, Puillayne said dreamily, \u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cThe misdeeds of individuals,\u201d Unthan Vyorn replied, \u201care not so much offenses against human law as they are ominous disturbances in a complex filament of cause and effect by which mankind is connected on all sides with surrounding nature. I believe that our cruelties, our sins, our violations, all drain vitality from our diminishing sun.\u201d\nMalion Gainthrust stirred restlessly at that notion, as though he planned at last to speak, but he controlled himself with visible effort and subsided once more into remoteness.\nPuillayne said, \u201cAn interesting theory: the cumulative infamies and iniquities of our species, do you say, have taken a toll on the sun itself over the many millennia, and so we are the architects of our own extinction?\u201d\n\u201cIt could be, yes.\u201d\n\u201cThen it is too late to embrace virtue, I suspect,\u201d said Puillayne dolefully. \u201cThrough our incorrigible miscreancy we have undone ourselves beyond repair. The damage is surely irreversible in this late epoch of the world\u2019s long existence.\u201d And he sighed a great sigh of inconsolable grief. To his consternation, he found the effects of the long morning\u2019s drinking abruptly weakening: the circular gyration of the walls had lessened and that agreeable haze had cleared, and he felt almost sober again, defenseless against the fundamental blackness of his intellective processes. It was a familiar event. No quantity of wine was sufficient to stave off the darkness indefinitely.\n\u201cYou look suddenly troubled, master,\u201d Kesztrel Tsaye observed. \u201cDespite the splendor of this wine, or perhaps even because of it, I see that some alteration of mood has overtaken you.\u201d\n\u201cI am reminded of my mortality. Our dim and shriveled sun\u2014the certainty of imminent oblivion\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAh, master, consider that you should be cheered by contemplation of the catastrophe that is soon to overcome us, rather than being thrust, as you say, into despond.\u201d\n\u201cCheered?\u201d\n\u201cMost truly. For we each must have death come unto us in our time\u2014it is the law of the universe\u2014and what pain it is as we lie dying to know that others will survive after we depart! But if all are to meet their end at once, then there is no reason to feel the bite of envy, and we can go easily as equals into our common destruction.\u201d\nPuillayne shook his head obstinately. \u201cI see merit in this argument, but little cheer. My death inexorably approaches, and that would be a cause of despair to me whether or not others might survive. Envy of those who survive is not a matter of any moment to me. For me, it will be as though all the cosmos dies when I do, and the dying of our sun adds only an additional layer of regret to what is already an infinitely regrettable outcome.\u201d\n\u201cYou permit yourself to sink into needless brooding, master,\u201d said Unthan Vyorn airily. \u201cYou should have another goblet of wine.\u201d\n\u201cYes. These present thoughts of mine are pathetically insipid, and I shame myself by giving rein to them. Even in the heyday of the world, when the bright yellow sun blazed forth in full intensity, the concept of death was one that every mature person was compelled to face, and only cowards and fools looked toward it with terror or rage or anything else but acceptance and detachment. One must not lament the inevitable. But it is my flaw that I am unable to escape such feelings. Wine, I have found, is my sole anodyne against them. And even that is not fully satisfactory.\u201d\nHe reached again for the Falernian. But Kesztrel Tsaye, interposing himself quickly, said, \u201cThat is the very wine that has brought this adverse effect upon you, master. Let us open, instead, the wine of our country that was our gift to you. You may not be aware that it is famed for its quality of soothing the troubled heart.\u201d He signaled to Malion Gainthrust, who sprang to his feet, deftly unsealed the two green carboys of Maurenron ambrosia, and, taking fresh goblets from Puillayne\u2019s cabinet, poured a tall serving of the pale bluish wine from one carboy for Puillayne and lesser quantities from the other for himself and his two companions.\n\u201cTo your health, master. Your renewed happiness. Your long life.\u201d\nPuillayne found their wine unexpectedly fresh and vigorous, with none of the rough and sour flavor he had led himself to anticipate. He followed his first tentative sip with a deeper one, and then with a third. In very fact, it had a distinctly calmative effect, speedily lifting him out of the fresh slough of dejection into which he had let himself topple.\nBut another moment more and he detected a strange unwelcome furriness coating his tongue, and it began to seem to him that beneath the superficial exuberance and openheartedness of the wine lay some less appetizing tinge of flavor, something almost alkaline that crept upward on his palate and negated the immediately pleasing effect of the initial taste. Then he noticed a heaviness of the mind overtaking him, and a weakness of the limbs, and it occurred to him, first, that they had been serving themselves out of one carboy and him out of another, and then, that he was unable to move, so that it became clear to him that the wine had been drugged. Fierce-eyed Malion Gainthrust stood directly before him, and he was speaking at last, declaiming a rhythmic chant which even in his drugged state Puillayne recognized as a simple binding spell that left him trussed and helpless.\nLike any householder of some affluence, Puillayne had caused his manse to be protected by an assortment of defensive charms, which the magus of his family had assured him would defend him against many sorts of inimicable events. The most obvious was theft: there were treasures here that others might have reasons to crave. In addition, one must guard one\u2019s house against fire, subterranean tremors, the fall of heavy stones from the sky, and other risks of the natural world. But, also, Puillayne was given to drunkenness, which could well lead to irresponsibility of behavior or mere clumsiness of movement, and he had bought himself a panoply of spells against the consequences of excessive intoxication.\nIn this moment of danger, it seemed to him that Citrathanda\u2019s Punctilious Sentinel was the appropriate spirit to invoke, and in a dull thick-tongued way Puillayne began to recite the incantation. But over the years, his general indifference to jeopardy had led to incaution, and he had not taken the steps that were needful to maintain the potency of his guardian spirits, which had dimmed with time so that his spell had no effect. Nor would his household revenants be of the slightest use in this predicament. Their barely corporeal forms could exert no force against tangible life. Only his gardeners were incarnate beings, and they, even if they had been on the premises this late in the day, would have been unlikely to heed his call. Puillayne realized that he was altogether without protection now. Gently, his guests, who now were his captors, were prodding him upward out of his couch. Kesztrel Tsaye said, \u201cYou will kindly accompany us, please, as we make our tour of your widely reputed treasury of priceless prizes.\u201d\nAll capacity for resistance was gone from him. Though they had left him with the power of locomotion, his arms were bound by invisible but unbreakable withes, and his spirit itself was captive to their wishes. He could do no other than let himself be led through one hall after another of his museum, staggering a little under the effect of their wine, and when they asked him of the nature of this artifact or that, he had no choice but to tell them. Whatever object caught their fancy, they removed from its case, with Malion Gainthrust serving as the means by which it was carried back to the great central room and added to a growing heap of plunder.\nThus they selected the Crystal Pillow of Carsephone Zorn, within which scenes from the daily life of any of seven subworlds could be viewed at ease, and the brocaded underrobe of some forgotten monarch of the Pharials, whose virility was enhanced twentyfold by an hour\u2019s wearing of it, and the Key of Sarpanigondar, a surgical tool by which any diseased organ of the body could be reached and healed without a breaching of the skin. They took also the Infinitely Replenishable Casket of Jade, once the utmost glory of the turban-wearing marauders of the frigid valleys of the Lesser Ghalur, and Sangaal\u2019s Remarkable Phoenix, from whose feathers fluttered a constant shower of gold dust, and the Heptachromatic Carpet of Kypard Segung, and the carbuncle-encrusted casket that contained the Incense of the Emerald Sky, and many another extraordinary object that had been part of Puillayne\u2019s hoard of fabulosities for decade upon decade.\nHe watched in mounting chagrin. \u201cSo you have come all this way merely to rob me, then?\u201d\n\u201cIt is not so simple,\u201d said Kesztrel Tsaye. \u201cYou must believe us when we say that we revere your poetry, and were primarily motivated to endure the difficulties of the journey by the hope of attaining your actual presence.\u201d\n\u201cYou choose an odd way to demonstrate your esteem for my art, then, for you would strip me of those things which I love even while claiming to express your regard for my work.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it matter who owns these things for the upcoming interim?\u201d the bearded man asked. \u201cIn a short while, the concept of ownership itself will be a moot one. You have stressed that point frequently in your verse.\u201d\nThere was a certain logic to that, Puillayne admitted. As the mound of loot grew, he attempted to assuage himself by bringing himself to accept Kesztrel Tsaye\u2019s argument that the sun would soon enough reach its last moment, smothering Earth in unending darkness and burying him and all his possessions under an obdurate coating of ice twenty marasangs thick, so what significance was there in the fact that these thieves were denuding him today of these trifles? All would be lost tomorrow or the day after, whether or not he had ever admitted the caitiff trio to his door.\nBut that species of sophistry brought him no surcease. Realistic appraisal of the probabilities told him that the dying of the sun might yet be a thousand years away, or even more, for although its inevitability was assured, its imminence was not so certain. Though ultimately he would be bereft of everything, as would everyone else, including these three villains, Puillayne came now to the realization that, all other things being equal, he preferred to await the end of all things amidst the presence of his collected keepsakes rather than without them. In that moment, he resolved to adopt a defensive posture.\nTherefore, he attempted once more to recite the Efficacious Sentinel of Citrathanda, emphasizing each syllable with a precision that he hoped might enhance the power of the spell. But his captors were so confident that there would be no result that they merely laughed as he spoke the verses, rather than making any effort to muffle his voice, and, in this, they were correct: as before, no guardian spirit came to his aid. Puillayne sensed that unless he found some more effective step to take, he was about to lose all that they had already selected, and, for all he knew, his life as well; and in that moment, facing the real possibility of personal extinction this very day, he understood quite clearly that his lifelong courtship of death had been merely a pose, that he was in no way actually prepared to take his leave of existence.\nOne possibility of saving himself remained.\n\u201cIf you will set me free,\u201d Puillayne said, pausing an instant or two to focus their attention, \u201cI will locate and share with you the True Vintage of Erzuine Thale.\u201d\nThe impact of that statement upon them was immediate and unmistakable. Their eyes brightened; their faces grew flushed and glossy; they exchanged excited glances of frank concupiscence.\nPuillayne believed he understood this febrile response. They had been so overcome with an access of trivial greed, apparently, once they had had Puillayne in their power and knew themselves free to help themselves at will to the rich and varied contents of his halls, that they had forgotten for the moment that his manse contained not only such baubles as the Heptochromatic Carpet and the Infinitely Replenishable Casket, but also, hidden away somewhere in his enormous accumulation of rare wines, something vastly more desirable, the veritable wine of wines itself, the bringer of infinitely ecstatic fulfillment, the elixir of ineffable rapture, the True Vintage of Erzuine Thale. Now he had reminded them of it and all its delights; and now they craved it with an immediate and uncontrollable desire.\n\u201cA splendid suggestion,\u201d said Unthan Vyorn, betraying by his thickness of voice the intensity of his craving. \u201cSummon the wine from its place of hiding, and we will partake.\u201d\n\u201cThe bottle yields to no one\u2019s beck,\u201d Puillayne declared. \u201cI must fetch it myself.\u201d\n\u201cFetch it, then.\u201d\n\u201cYou must first release me.\u201d\n\u201cYou are capable of walking, are you not? Lead us to the wine, and we will do the rest.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Puillayne. \u201cHow do you think this famed wine has survived so long? It is protected by a network of highly serviceable spells, such as Thampyron\u2019s Charm of Impartial Security, which insures that the flask will yield only to the volition of its inscribed owner, who at present is myself. If the flask senses that my volition is impaired, it will refuse to permit opening. Indeed, if it becomes aware that I am placed under extreme duress, the wine itself will be destroyed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you request of us, then?\u201d\n\u201cFree my arms. I will bring the bottle from its nest and open it for you, and you may partake of it, and I wish you much joy of it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\u201cYou will have had the rarest experience known to the soul of man, and I will have been cheated of the opportunity to give the world the epic poem that you claim so dearly to crave; and then, I hope, we will be quits, and you will leave me my little trinkets and take yourselves back to your dreary northern caves. Are we agreed?\u201d\nThey looked at one another, coming quickly and wordlessly to an agreement, and Kesztrel Tsaye, with a grunt of assent, signaled to Malion Gainthrust to intone the counterspell. Puillayne felt the bonds that had embraced his arms melting away. He extended them in a lavish stretching gesture, flexed his fingers, looked expectantly at his captors.\n\u201cNow fetch the celebrated wine,\u201d said Kesztrel Tsaye.\nThey accompanied him back through chamber after chamber until they reached the hall where his finest wines were stored. Puillayne made a great show of searching through rack after rack, muttering to himself, shaking his head. \u201cI have hidden it very securely,\u201d he reported after a time. \u201cNot so much as a precaution against theft, you realize, but as a way of making it more difficult for me to seize upon it myself in a moment of drunken impulsiveness.\u201d\n\u201cWe understand,\u201d Unthan Vyorn said. \u201cBut find it, if you please. We grow impatient.\u201d\n\u201cLet me think. If I were hiding such a miraculous wine from myself, where would I put it? The Cabinet of Meritorious Theriacs? Hardly. The Cinnabar Vestibule? The Chrysochlorous Benefice? The Tabulature? The Trogonic Chamber?\u201d\nAs he pondered, he could see their restiveness mounting from one instant to the next. They tapped their fingers against their thighs, they moved their feet from side to side, they ran their hands inside their garments as though weapons were hidden there. Unheeding, Puillayne continued to frown and mutter. But then he brightened. \u201cAh, yes, yes, of course!\u201d And he crossed the room, threw open a low door in the wall at its farther side, reached into the dusty interior of a service aperture.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said jubilantly. \u201cThe True Vintage of Erzuine Thale!\u201d\n\u201cThis?\u201d said Kesztrel Tsaye, with some skepticism.\nThe bottle Puillayne held forth to them was a gray tapering one, dust-encrusted and unprepossessing, bearing only a single small label inscribed with barely legible runes in faint grayish ink. They crowded around like snorting basilisks inflamed with lust.\nEach in turn puzzled over the writing; but none could decipher it.\n\u201cWhat language is that?\u201d asked Unthan Vyorn.\n\u201cThese are Nolwaynish runes,\u201d answered Puillayne. \u201cSee, see, here is the name of the maker, the famed vintner Erzuine Thale, and here is the date of the wine\u2019s manufacture, in a chronology that I fear will mean nothing to you, and this emblem here is the seal of the king of Gammelcor who was reigning at the time of the bottling.\u201d\n\u201cYou would not deceive us?\u201d said Kesztrel Thale. \u201cYou would not fob some lesser wine off on us, taking advantage of our inability to read these scrawls?\u201d\nPuillayne laughed jovially. \u201cPut all your suspicions aside! I will not conceal the fact that I bitterly resent the imposition you are enforcing on me here, but that does not mean I can shunt aside thirty generations of family honor. Surely you must know that on my father\u2019s side I am the Eighteenth Maghada of Nalanda, and there is a geas upon me as hereditary leader of that sacred order that bans me from all acts of deceit. This is, I assure you, the True Vintage of Erzuine Thale, and nothing else. Stand a bit aside, if you will, so that I can open the flask without activating Thampyron\u2019s Charm, for, may I remind you, any hint that I act under duress will destroy its contents. It would be a pity to have preserved this wine for so long a time only to have it become worthless vinegar in the moment of unsealing.\u201d\n\u201cYou act now of your own free will,\u201d Unthan Vyorn said. \u201cIt was your choice to offer us this wine, nor was it done at our insistence.\u201d\n\u201cThis is true,\u201d Puillayne responded. He set out four goblets and, contemplating the flask thoughtfully, spoke the words that would breach its seal.\n\u201cThree goblets will suffice,\u201d said Kesztrel Tsaye.\n\u201cI am not to partake?\n\u201cIf you do, it will leave that much less for us.\u201d\n\u201cYou are cruel indeed, depriving me even of a fourth share of this wine, which I obtained at such expense and after negotiations so prolonged I can scarcely bear to think of them. But so be it. I will have none. As you pointed out, what does it matter, or anything else, when the hour of everlasting night grows ineluctably near?\u201d\nHe put one goblet aside and filled the other three. Malion Gainthrust was the first to seize his, clutching it with berserk intensity and gulping it to its depths in a single crazed ingurgitation. Instantly, his strange chilly eyes grew bright as blazing coals. The other two men drank more judiciously, frowning a bit at the first sip as though they had expected some more immediate ebullition, sipping again, frowning again, now trembling. Puillayne refilled the goblets. \u201cDrink deep,\u201d he abjured them. \u201cHow I envy you this ecstasy of ecstasies!\u201d\nMalion Gainthrust now fell to the floor, thrashing about oddly, and, a moment later, Kesztrel Tsaye did the same, toppling like a felled tree and slapping his hands against the tiles as though to indicate some extreme inward spasm. Long-legged Unthan Vyorn, suddenly looking deathly pale, swayed erratically, clutched at his throat, and gasped, \u201cBut this is some poison, is it not? By the Thodiarch, you have betrayed us!\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Puillayne blandly, as Unthan Vyorn joined his writhing fellows on the floor. \u201cI have given you not the True Vintage of Erzuine Thale, but the Efficacious Solvent of Gibrak Lahinne. The strictures of honor placed upon me in my capacity as Eighteenth Maghada of Nalanda do not extend to a requirement that I ignore the need for self-defense. Already, I believe, the bony frame of your bodies has begun to dissolve. Your internal organs must also be under attack. You will shortly lose consciousness, I suspect, which will spare you from whatever agonies you may at the moment be experiencing. But do you wonder that I took so harsh a step? You thought I was a helpless idle fool, and quite likely that scornful assessment was correct up until this hour, but by entering my sanctum and attempting to part me from the things I hold precious, you awakened me from my detachment and restored me to the love of life that had long ago fled from me. No longer did the impending doom of the world enfold me in paralysis. Indeed, I chose to take action against your depredations, and so\u2014\u201d\nBut he realized that there was no reason for further statements. His visitors had been reduced to puddles of yellow slime, leaving just their caps and boots and other garments, which he would add to his collection of memorabilia. The rest required only the services of his corps of revenants to remove, and then he was able to proceed with a clear mind to the remaining enterprises of a normal afternoon.\n\u201cBut will you not now at last permit yourself to enjoy the True Vintage?\u201d Gimbiter Soleptan asked him two nights later, when he and several other of Puillayne\u2019s closest friends had gathered in a tent of sky-blue silk in the garden poet\u2019s manse for a celebratory dinner. The intoxicating scent of calavindra blossoms was in the air, and the pungent odor of sweet nargiise. \u201cThey might so easily have deprived you of it, and who knows but some subsequent miscreant might have more success? Best to drink it now, say I, and have the enjoyment of it before that is made impossible for you. Yes, drink it now!\u201d\n\u201cNot quite yet,\u201d said Puillayne in a steadfast tone. \u201cI understand the burden of your thought: seize the moment, guarantee the consumption while I can. By that reasoning, I should have guzzled it the instant those scoundrels had fallen. But you must remember that I have reserved a higher use for that wine. And the time for that use has not yet arrived.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Immiter of Glosz, a white-haired sage who was of all the members of Puillayne\u2019s circle the closest student of his work. \u201cThe great epic that you propose to indite in the hour of the sun\u2019s end\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes. And I must have the unbroached True Vintage to spur my hand, when that hour comes. Meanwhile, though, there are many wines here of not quite so notable a puissance that are worthy of our attention, and I propose that we ingest more than a few flasks this evening.\u201d Puillayne gestured broadly at the array of wines he had previously set out, and beckoned to his friends to help themselves. \u201cAnd as you drink,\u201d he said, drawing from his brocaded sleeve a scrap of parchment, \u201cI offer you the verses of this afternoon.\u201d\nThe night is coming, but what of that?\nDo I not glow with pleasure still, and glow, and glow?\nThere is no darkness, there is no misery\nSo long as my flask is near!\nThe flower-picking maidens sing their lovely song by the jade pavilion.\nThe winged red khotemnas flutter brightly in the trees.\nI laugh and lift my glass and drain it to the dregs.\nO golden wine! O glorious day!\nSurely we are still only in the springtime of our winter\nAnd I know that death is merely a dream\nWhen I have my flask!\nOriginally published in Songs of the Dying Earth: Stories in Honor of Jack Vance, edited by George R.

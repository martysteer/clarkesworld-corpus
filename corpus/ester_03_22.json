Whenever a report came that one of them had been spreading their own version of it, one of us had to pay those storied steppes a visit.\nThe latest offender lived on one of the strewn fields left by a meteorite that came down centuries ago to give the place its name. Neighbors feared he had been in contact with visitors from alternate time strands, putting him in violation of laws enacted after the meteorite\u2019s interlineal quality was discovered.\nHe stood a stone\u2019s throw from his homestead, waving like a child as the inspector brought her flyer down. The vessel\u2019s rotors leveled sheaths of grass underneath and kicked dust at him, but he kept at it.\nHe had a meddler\u2019s grin. It exposed his chipped tooth while failing to lift the bags under his eyes.\nEven meddlers too young to have seen the August Meteorite come down had the grin\u2014passed down through the same mutation that gave them immune cells most suited to Sanctuary 2\u2019s biome.\nHalfway up from the flyer, the inspector saw the first sign of a fragment on the property. The man\u2019s August Aeronautics coverall had been deep blue while she observed him from the air. Down here, it appeared much lighter. The spaceflight manufacturer native to August didn\u2019t issue coveralls in that shade. It had either been acquired from wear or the man had damned himself and everyone on the homestead to extended stays at the internment camp east of here; perhaps fates worse than that.\n\u201cHear now,\u201d he greeted in the outback\u2019s patois before lowering his hand.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she shouted over the rotors, stopping six yards out from him. \u201cI would want to skip the frivolities this morning if that\u2019s alright. Are you who they call Timoh?\u201d\nHe placed a bony hand on his chest. \u201cName Now-Timoh, hear now. Then-Timoh is pa\u2014dead and buried. Gone to be with her who throw the rock down. Name Now-Timoh, \u2019til the rock thrower call me to her side, hear\u2014\u201d\nShe smiled through his soft-spoken soliloquy as he meandered a few seconds more. There came the old itch on the nape of her neck. She met it with all the restraint she could muster. For this visit, she needed to be fully in her own mind.\nFinding a window to speak, she heaved a quick sigh and wrested her cloak from the wind\u2019s dalliance with it.\n\u201cTimoh . . . \u201d She fished a warrant from her fatigues. \u201cI am Inspector Ransom Nu\u2019Terra with the August Meteorite Recovery Mission. In my hand is a warrant signed by the Magisterium on Sanctuary 2 and the Now and Forever Sovereign Cletus Nu\u2019Dawn the Infinite. It gives me command this morning to search your property for the presence of fragments from the August Meteorite\u2014meddling stones, as you otherwise know them. But first\u2014\u201d Widening her smile, she pocketed the warrant. \u201cAllow me to extend you a courtesy by asking that you come forward with knowledge of any such fragments you may have come across here on these pastures.\u201d\nTimoh narrowed his eyes\u2014an expression that made him look younger than his six decades alive permitted. Behind him, one of the compound\u2019s outbuildings towered over the others. Two hundred feet wide, its roof was without most of its panels, so it looked to Inspector Nu\u2019Terra like an unauthorized rocket launch being prepped.\nShe scowled. Another inspector had recently been here in August and ventured close to a Transient Extralocal Object, frying his implant as a result. A launchpad in working order\u2014though common in the Sovereign\u2019s Prime\u2014was still dangerous in a meddler\u2019s possession. Beyond Sanctuary 2\u2019s orbit lay transients wanting war between their time strands and this one.\nTimoh shook his head in a halting manner, making the inspector think he hadn\u2019t understood her. People had died for just failing to communicate knowledge of where fragments of the meteorite could be found. The August Meteorite Recovery Mission originated from violent campaigns to confiscate the stones and exterminate ghosts of resistance they allowed in from alternate time strands.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s a denial,\u201d she said, \u201cmy sweepers will now check the premises for extralocal particle emissions and be out of your hair within the hour. How\u2019s that?\u201d\nHe nodded. She paid her flyer an over-the-shoulder glance. The rhomboid vessel was farther out than she recalled landing it. Taking a moment to visually confirm it hadn\u2019t drifted on its tethers, she whistled to her sweepers. The likely explanation\u2014she knew\u2014was that she had been channeled into one of them while grounding the flyer and hadn\u2019t fully resumed awareness of self when it landed.\nA sweeper began as a canine-arachnoid hybrid. Once old enough, it was fused to a geodesic carapace fashioned from recovered fragments of the meteorite.\nShe had brought just two with her for this visit, judging from reports of Timoh\u2019s brazen antics that a fragment\u2014if on the property\u2014wouldn\u2019t be hidden well. The six-legged cyborgs shot like bricks of rusted metal from their docks under the flyer. As they scuttled past her, she palmed the nape of her neck where a scar marked the place her implant was inserted years ago.\nAn implant was a recovered meteorite fragment, barely bigger than a grain of sand, fused to a transmitter that kept it bonded to other recovered fragments. The trove of research on the meteorite included the finding that linking its fragments like that prevented inspectors from walking across bridges laid by unrecovered fragments\u2014tears on the fabric of the Sovereign\u2019s Prime.\nSoftening his gaze, Timoh\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cPerchancin\u2019 tea, inspector?\u201d\nHis case had been escalated once it became clear the recovery mission could no longer ignore his retellings of Sovereign Nu\u2019Dawn\u2019s conquest and events that followed.\nThere were reports from the August Aeronautics plant of him passing out leaflets he had authored. He had been recorded gathering children around various statues to tell them stories of the people in those statues that could only have taken place after they died.\nThe mission pieced his confused versions of events together after getting word that he had begun speaking of the Sovereign Cletus Nu\u2019Dawn the Infinite as though he were dead. What they found was worryingly similar to six near-congruent strands believed to have splintered from the Sovereign\u2019s Prime shortly before he arrived on Sanctuary 2.\n\u201cThat building without a roof . . . \u201d Having refused Timoh\u2019s offer of tea, Nu\u2019Terra gestured toward the outbuilding that previously drew her attention. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d\nScratching his coarse head of hair, Timoh turned for a glance at it. \u201cHear now, as the rock thrower be true, so I must be.\u201d He fixed her with eyes that modeled virtue. \u201cOld rocket shed. Then-Timoh\u2019s handiwork, hear now\u2014before the magisterium forbid it.\u201d\nShe nodded, holding a thought as one of her sweepers crawled out of the hole in the building\u2019s roof. It scurried like a gecko down the building\u2019s exterior next, indicators flashing a sallow green on its iron-nickel shell. Green meant the shed was clear, no extralocal emissions detected, no fragments discovered. Red, without exception, meant a fragment nearby, a meddling stone, a bridge from the Sovereign\u2019s Prime to an alternate strand.\nNu\u2019Terra returned her attention to Timoh. \u201cDid old Timoh rid the shed of rockets once the magisterium ruled them illegal?\u201d\n\u201cTrue as the rock thrower, he did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been collecting more of them for nostalgia\u2019s sake or similar justifications?\u201d She watched his eyes pinch together, considering, putting on the air of incredulity. One could never tell with a meddler.\nSeeing the second sweeper exit the shed through a tilt door, she channeled into its awareness through the bond between her implant and its carapace. Though a limited awareness, it gave confirmation that the shed was clear, both of fragments and transients from alternate strands.\nShe spared Timoh a flat smile, hoping on the kindly fool\u2019s behalf that she truly would be out of his hair soon.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go have a look.\u201d\nCrossing after him into the shed, she heard laughter. His case file had indicated three children still live here with him, counting a grandchild.\nThe floor felt damp. No light passed into the enclosure except through that cavity in its roof. The musk of fertilizer hung in the air. Where daylight shafted down, machine parts glinted in heaps on the ground.\n\u201cBeholding, just junk Fig scavenge from motoshop.\u201d With his eyes glinting outside the light, Timoh lurked in her periphery. \u201cNothing go up to the rock thrower from here, true as her.\u201d\nLaughter bounced off the walls again, pitched too high to belong to someone old enough for work in a repair shop.\nNu\u2019Terra turned to regard Timoh\u2019s hunched frame. \u201cIs that Fig laughing?\u201d\n\u201cFig rap to none but the rock thrower since birth,\u201d he answered, a hint of grief in his voice. \u201cCall him Soon-Timoh \u2019til I\u2019m in the earth, kin of my dotty Sarawa who rap the Standard fluent.\u201d\nShe nodded\u2014hearing about his mute son\u2014but that hadn\u2019t answered her question.\nIt wasn\u2019t for lack of trying on the Sovereign\u2019s part that, after ninety years, people in August hadn\u2019t accepted his Standard as a first language. After all of Sanctuary 2 was forced to adopt it, dissidents previously executed in this strand began turning up in August. In their native dialects, they regaled its populace with retellings in which Sanctuary 2\u2019s invasion hadn\u2019t succeeded.\nNu\u2019Terra glared another few seconds at Timoh. The silence between them filled her mind with images of transients being chased like fugitives through fields of hay. She had been too young to attend the public executions where those captured were hung alongside meddlers they had come in contact with. Though a bygone era, the rule remained. The killings\u2014whenever deemed expedient\u2014now happened in private.\nTimoh shifted his weight from one foot to the other, slight but enough to betray that he was blocking Nu\u2019Terra\u2019s view of something.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s behind you?\u201d\nWith that penetrating stare of his to the ground, he inhaled deep. Between his feet, she spied an object like a dome under a weathered mass of tarp. She rounded him to get to the other side of it, keeping his trembling hands in the corner of her eye as his gaze followed her.\nThe object reached up to their knees under the tarp, spanning twenty feet between them.\nShe eyed him with care to hide her apprehension. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d\nHe muttered something that could have been a prayer in his language or a curse. In a swift motion, he pulled the tarp back.\nNu\u2019Terra clenched her jaw at the object under the tarp and the pit it had been lowered into. One misstep and she might have fallen in. More to her displeasure, she was now looking at a small passenger capsule and a platform underneath.\n\u201cOnly capsule you find,\u201d Timoh stammered. \u201cNo booster.\u201d\n\u201cYou expect me to take your word on that\u2014you hitching this thing to a platform, then lowering it down this far while having nothing to hide?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for my grandy.\u201d\n\u201cYour grandchild?\u201d\n\u201cTo pretend she\u2019s sailin\u2019. Playtime, true as her. No rockets here.\u201d\nA metallic belch issued from down the pit where Nu\u2019Terra couldn\u2019t see. She began wondering what Timoh had muttered in his language before removing the tarp. They eyed each other. The squeaking continued a few seconds more. After a muffled thud, the pit fell silent.\nNu\u2019Terra hummed a sigh. \u201cHow long will it take to crane the rig up to ground level so I can see for myself?\u201d\nTimoh chortled, and it made her cock an eyebrow. \u201cMore than the hour you timed on staying.\u201d\n\u201cStart now in that case.\u201d\nHe wiped the shed with his gaze, stopping beside its tilt door where a slab protruding from the wall held a control module with its screen idle. After a nod from Nu\u2019Terra, he shuffled toward it. She wiped sweat from her brow as he keyed in commands through the screen. The ground shook. A hum commenced. The muck under her boots began to feel like it might pull her in.\n\u201cBest be outside \u2019til it\u2019s done,\u201d Timoh shouted over the hum, peering behind his back at her. She paid the advice a begrudging nod and began haltingly toward the door. At the door, she let him exit first, ducking cautiously under it once he was at a safe distance from her.\nBefore she was fully out, laughter echoed again. This time she traced it to two children no older than seven, like mirror images of each other as they scrambled out of the shed behind her.\nShe froze. They beat their little legs past her to the main building forty yards out. Without hesitation, she channeled into the awareness of the sweeper closest to her.\nShe felt its six legs like they were hers, the channeling so abrupt she lost balance on her own feet and fell. Memory of encountering the kids inside the shed flashed vividly enough that it may as well have been hers. They were identical. They had been playing under the module when this sweeper tagged them as native to this strand. Even children from outside the Sovereign\u2019s Prime couldn\u2019t be spared once identified.\n\u201cTimoh,\u201d she mouthed, shaking herself out of the sweeper\u2019s awareness. \u201cYour case file doesn\u2019t list a set of identical\u2014\u201d She paused at the sight of him offering his hand to help her up.\nShe should have brought more sweepers. If these two had erroneously cleared a transient, the entire compound could truly now be dangerous ground. A transient of unknown design could fry her implant, leading to brain death, her body in this strand, her mind in that in-between void where time moved in no direction.\nWithout Timoh\u2019s help, she shuffled back to her feet. \u201cYou have just one grandchild who looks like that, and she doesn\u2019t have a twin.\u201d\n\u201cTrue as her.\u201d\n\u201cWho was that with her just now?\u201d\n\u201cFriend of my grandy.\u201d His eyes roamed, darting frequently to the sidearm holstered to her waist. \u201cSome call them twins but they\u2019s just friends, true as her.\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra sighed in annoyance at meddler beliefs that refused to die. \u201cTrue as who?\u201d\n\u201cHer the rock thrower.\u201d Timoh puffed his chest up. \u201cHer who throw the rock down.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rock thrower, Timoh. There was a meteorite\u2014we call it the August Meteorite. It fell a century before the Sovereign\u2019s advance on Sanctuary 2. When the atmosphere broke it in pieces, it rained chaos on August, creating bridges to and from time strands not ours. It\u2019s a cosmic anomaly, not the work of some savior destined to reverse history\u2019s course as it concerns you meddlers and your insistence Sanctuary 2 was yours first.\n\u201cThis goes beyond religious conviction into realpolitik. Do you understand? If you\u2019ve been keeping knowledge of a fragment from us, you\u2019ll be interred the rest of your life, if not executed. If there\u2019s a transient here\u2014even one young as those two I just saw\u2014they\u2019ll be executed. I can try explaining this to you in that pidgin you speak.\u201d\nNodding and looking away, Timoh raised a hand as if to stop her onslaught. She followed his gaze to the main building.\nThere, amid its rubble masonry, she saw the sweeper she had just channeled out of climbing to the roof, indicators green on its carapace. Beside it, a shirtless young man stumbled out of the building\u2019s arched entryway. He held a tray while, behind him, a slightly younger woman in a frock rushed two mugs to him.\n\u201cFig and Sarawa?\u201d asked Nu\u2019Terra, matching their faces to photos of Timoh\u2019s youngest children.\nTimoh beamed a wide, unrepentant grin at her as the shirtless man bounded toward them. \u201cTea, inspector?\u201d\n\u201cHear now, these fields be as unkind as we \u2019gree to let them.\u201d Timoh breathed deeply after his first sip. \u201cViews differ but I meme the golden rule: you get out what you put in.\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra stalled when it was her turn to grab a mug from Fig\u2019s tray, eyeing its creamy content, steam rising like a charmed snake from it. Beside her, Timoh continued his small talk while the noise from the shed kept on at a reduced volume.\nFig nudged the tray toward Nu\u2019Terra. Both men had the same protruding stare, but Fig\u2019s was more commanding, as though he\u2019d learned to carry conversations with his eyes. To Nu\u2019Terra, those eyes seemed to assure her he had slipped nothing in the beverage.\nShe took the mug, thanked him under her breath. Clipping the tray below his armpit, he backed away so the trio now stood in a circle. Timoh was talking about new printers at the plant when Nu\u2019Terra returned her attention to him. Glancing at Fig a second later, he switched seamlessly to his native tongue.\nHe must have shared a joke with him next because the man doubled over suddenly and mimed laughter, eyes wide, muscles stiff as veins bulged on his brawny frame. He used his fist to respond in a sign language equally impenetrable to Nu\u2019Terra, then barreled toward the main building.\nNu\u2019Terra dismissed a thought that the joke had been at her expense. The tea smelled like ginger, but she felt no rush to try it.\nAt the building\u2019s entrance, Sarawa caught her eye as Fig vanished behind her. The woman was dainty with sharp features that made her look like chiseled stone. She waved at Nu\u2019Terra. After a brief hesitation, Nu\u2019Terra waved back.\n\u201cYou have a lovely family, Timoh.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019s my youngest,\u201d he replied. \u201cPer\u2019venture you cross to Port Country up north, ask after my firstborn, stationed there three years. Iwa sur-Timoh. She got high ranking with Global Defense, true as her. Left her dotty here to come up how she come up\u2014pasturing life.\u201d\n\u201cWould that be your grandchild . . . or the friend who looks\u2014\u201d Nu\u2019Terra tittered as mounting disbelief threatened her resolve. \u201c\u2014strikingly like her?\u201d\nAs if he hadn\u2019t heard her, Timoh resumed his philosophizing about life on the steppes. \u201cHear now, these fields don\u2019t grow crop if you don\u2019t let them grow you up first. Many give up and cross to Port Country or Lake Valley below. No patience with the rock thrower to learn how to till the earth she mark as ours. Then-Timoh tell the stories before he gone\u2014the folks who crossed from here before Inzi come down from orbit to lay Cletus the enemy commander low.\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra huffed so audibly it made Timoh jump. Inzi was a name without a historical person attached to it in the Sovereign\u2019s Prime. However, in about six other strands, she loomed large. In each of them, according to legends that bled into this strand years ago, she had cut down Commander Cletus Nu\u2019Dawn before he assumed his immortal form.\n\u201cTimoh, there\u2019s no Inzi who came down to lay the Sovereign low.\u201d She pitched his daughter a quick glance as if to confirm with her what she\u2019d just heard. \u201cYou\u2019re a very confused old man. That or it\u2019s something worse for you and everyone else here. We\u2019ll know soon, but for the sake of disclosure, you should know that speaking of the Sovereign as if he\u2019s dead is the reason I\u2019m here this morning.\u201d She bent her head at Timoh\u2019s unnerving calm. \u201cYou\u2019re so unassuming yet we have these reports of you spreading apocrypha the likes of which nobody\u2019s encountered since the recovery mission got its start.\u201d\nTimoh nodded. Again she wasn\u2019t sure he understood her.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d\nHe downed his remaining tea, then raised a finger. \u201cPerchancin\u2019 I excuse myself, inspector? Very quick in the house and back\u2014very quick.\u201d\n\u201cGo,\u201d she shot back. He scurried toward the main building. \u201cDon\u2019t wander too far,\u201d she called after him. \u201cI would hate to waste an extraction request on you and we find nothing on your property.\u201d\nWith his back to her, he waved as if to shoo her away, barely acknowledging his daughter as he strode past her into the house.\nThe woman threw Nu\u2019Terra a hard glance. Nu\u2019Terra turned her back so she could channel undistracted into the sweeper currently inside the compound\u2019s garage.\nOn six legs, she scaled a compactor and thought\u2014as I did once\u2014that she would\u2019ve done well if born a sweeper. Its eight bulbous black eyes pierced the surface of things \u2019til all it saw was a soup of quantum ephemera inside which particles that didn\u2019t belong stuck out like artifacts in the blur\u2014extralocal emissions. At times she channeled so deep it felt like she swam in a numbing sea and all that broached her own awareness was bliss. No pesky meddlers exhausting her patience. No faculties of cognition complex enough to have her questioning the mission.\nShe sensed a presence behind her and knew this wouldn\u2019t be one of those times. Shaking her hand discreetly, she shook herself out of the sweeper\u2019s awareness.\n\u201cInspector,\u201d came a lilting voice.\nShe whirled to meet it, her hand itching for her sidearm. Sarawa\u2019s frown was oddly enchanting up close, and it knocked her breath from her.\n\u201cSarawa . . . \u201d\n\u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra wiped sweat from her brow. \u201cNot at all.\u201d\nSarawa\u2019s lips curled up but Nu\u2019Terra could only read torment on them. \u201cSo it isn\u2019t true you all develop a dependence on channeling that slowly erodes your senses?\u201d\nRecalling her confusion over where she\u2019d landed her flyer, Nu\u2019Terra huffed. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cTo ask why you\u2019re here.\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra took a moment to resume her even keel. \u201cYour father\u2019s playing a dangerous game, Sarawa. If there\u2019s a transient on this property, we may not even have to prove one of you knew about it.\u201d\nSarawa nodded, that tortuous smile still on her. \u201cHave you considered that it might be you getting history wrong?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. When time came for the Sovereign to redeem his claim to this moonworld, it was discovered that your forebears had been squatting here and had neglected to inform the rest of civilization. After they got tired of warring with him and chose to hear reason, they neglected again\u2014in true meddler fashion\u2014to tell anyone about this thing that came down a century before he arrived and turned August into a haunted plain.\n\u201cI\u2019m here on his orders to prevent war with adversaries he can\u2019t properly anticipate because they strategize outside his Prime. This morning, as it\u2019s been for some time, we\u2019re doing what we must to prevent death on a scale previously unseen. This time strand\u2014an untold number of alternates connected to the Sovereign\u2019s journey here ninety years ago\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t put on airs, knowing exactly what I asked. Why did you choose this version?\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra clenched her jaw as a grudge she\u2019d held since birth threatened to surface. \u201cThat\u2019s enough from you, Sarawa.\u201d\nThe woman held her hand out. It took Nu\u2019Terra a few seconds to understand why, then hand her the untouched tea.\nWhile Sarawa gulped it down, a thought crossed Nu\u2019Terra\u2019s mind and stirred tremors in her chest.\nShe folded her arms as the woman began toward the building. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help noticing you didn\u2019t deny there being a fragment here.\u201d\nSarawa turned to pitch her that bewitching smile again while backing away. \u201cI\u2019m not my father . . . I won\u2019t dance for you.\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra looked away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice meeting you, Inspector . . . \u201d\n\u201cInspector Ransom Nu\u2019Terra.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d\nThe grandchild answered to Suniwa\u2014whichever of the two girls she was. A minute after Sarawa entered the house, they ran out, flitting past Nu\u2019Terra without a glance at her.\nShe watched them frolic in a clearing beside the shed, mindful of the three now inside the house. They played a clapping game that involved a tongue-twister in their language, teasing laughter every few seconds.\nReminding herself that her sweepers had cleared both of them, Nu\u2019Terra began pacing in their direction. They stopped their game when she crossed within a few yards from them.\n\u201cSuniwa,\u201d she called, stopping as well.\nA moment passed as they eyed her obliquely, like they\u2019d never had to decide who would respond to that name.\nNu\u2019Terra squatted down, adjusting her plaited brown hair in effort to look disarming. \u201cCome here, Suniwa.\u201d\nThe one in a leotard snuck another glance at the one in overalls before ambling toward Nu\u2019Terra. Her expression was bashful, but she flashed Nu\u2019Terra an enormous grin when she reached her.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your name, is it?\u201d Nu\u2019Terra asked.\nThe girl nodded, hands behind her back as she rocked gently. Her missing front teeth captivated Nu\u2019Terra.\nNu\u2019Terra glanced over the girl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWho\u2019s that you\u2019re playing with?\u201d The girl didn\u2019t answer. \u201cCome,\u201d Nu\u2019Terra called, waving the other girl over.\nShe came close, flashed a timid, gap-toothed grin to match Suniwa\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d asked Nu\u2019Terra.\n\u201cCaruwa.\u201d\n\u201cSuni and Caru . . . \u201d Nu\u2019Terra\u2019s smile came unforced for the first time since she arrived. \u201cCaruwa . . . \u201d Her mirth regained its artificial quality as she tried for a wistful hum before levying her next question. \u201cDo people tell you how much you look like Suni?\u201d\nCaruwa nodded.\n\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the girl said gingerly.\n\u201cDo you live here with Suni or are you just visiting?\u201d\n\u201cHere.\u201d\nNu\u2019Terra batted her eyes at the girl. She had never encountered a transient this precious. This wasn\u2019t one, she reminded herself. Her sweepers had checked.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s ma and pa, Caruwa?\u201d\n\u201cNew Autumn,\u201d the girl mumbled through her smile.\n\u201cNew Autumn Reserve\u2014\u201d An image of two adults getting violently separated from their infant child flashed in Nu\u2019Terra\u2019s mind. \u201cThe internment camp . . . \u201d\nCaruwa\u2019s smile faltered. Nu\u2019Terra lingered on that image. The infant child; only a few minutes old when sentinels hired by the recovery mission dragged her parents out of the birthing ward.\nBurying the image, she regarded Suniwa. \u201cWhat do you think of your grandpa, Suniwa?\u201d\nSuniwa was no longer smiling. Nu\u2019Terra hadn\u2019t noticed the grim look in her eyes \u2019til now; as though she too had seen something upsetting flash in her mind.\n\u201cDon\u2019t run,\u201d the girl muttered.\nNu\u2019Terra pinched her eyes together. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d A smile lit her face up, masking horror underneath. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d She thought the girl might be speaking the Standard in that same broken manner as her grandfather. \u201cTimoh doesn\u2019t . . . run?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t run,\u201d echoed Caruwa. She too had stopped smiling. As Nu\u2019Terra searched for context within which such instruction wouldn\u2019t be cause for alarm, the girl spoke again. \u201cYou\u2019re not completely across the bridge.\u201d\nA chill coursed through Nu\u2019Terra and made her woozy. Bridge . . . That was what the girl said\u2014delivered in perfect Standard.\nShe bolted up, staggered back. The word could only mean she was no longer in the Sovereign\u2019s Prime.\nHer heart pounded. She almost fell, backing away from the girls. They stared vacantly while the word reverberated in her mind, forcing her hand toward her sidearm. Not completely across.\nNo one had ever conceived of a bridge that could hold someone on it, rather than pass them instantly to another strand. A childish prank, she tried telling herself. But before becoming aware of it, she had drawn her sidearm and begun choking its grip.\n\u201cTimoh,\u201d she bellowed, the main building in front of her again, the sidearm pointed down. Not at the girls, she made sure. \u201cTimoh, come out here!\u201d\n\u201cShortly, inspector,\u201d came his hooting response.\n\u201cThis second, you doddering, old, moon creature.\u201d\n\u201cJust another minute.\u201d\n\u201cRight this\u2014\u201d Something on her left caught her eye.\nShe hadn\u2019t landed her flyer so far off the compound, yet there it was. What it posited now, she refused, breathing harshly while her head throbbed and the floor felt like it might drop from under her feet.\nNo bridge had been discovered stable enough to return anyone who crossed it into another strand. She tried telling herself she was still in the Sovereign\u2019s Prime. Timoh shouted in what she now realized was perfect Standard.\n\u201cInspector, I think one of your sweepers found something.\u201d\nThe sweepers. She focused on the implant behind her brain stem in order to channel into one of them. If they had discovered extralocal emissions, she should have sensed it when they did. The channeling attempt failed, giving her severe chills and a rush of blood to the head.\nShe thumbed a lock on her sidearm to set its payload to lethal. The film of sweat under her nose took on a blood smell. She wiped the nosebleed on the back of her hand, nodded her resignation at the turn of events.\n\u201cMeddler scum,\u201d she barked, taking quick aim at the entrance. \u201cCome out here\u2014all of you.\u201d\n\u201cLay down your weapon,\u201d returned a new voice. Velvety. Rattling her for how similar it sounded to hers.\nHer stomach dropped as, through the entrance, I took my first step outside.\n\u201cRansom Nu\u2019Terra,\u201d I said, completing my exit. \u201cDon\u2019t be so quick with that, or you\u2019ll kill your own ghost before she\u2019s had her day with your Sovereign.\u201d\nShe squeezed her eyes shut. Opened them. Shook her head. Having failed to wake herself from the dream she hoped this was, she trained a pleading look on me, mouth agape, chest heaving as her breathing grew difficult.\nOne of her sweepers squirmed in my arms, smearing its sweat on my coverall. Fidgety beast it was with its carapace removed, spiked fur, a falciform pate with its eight bulbous eyes. Fig walked up beside me with the other sweeper in one arm and its carapace dangling off the other. He tossed the carapace. It landed halfway to Ransom\u2014my soon-to-collapse doppel.\nYou might still need that, I signed to Fig, briefly able to get a hand free.\nHis eyes went to the net hanging off a string around my wrist.\nWe have too much already, he signed.\nRansom\u2014sidearm still pointed at me\u2014gazed finally at that net. Seeing the nineteen meddling stones like flints of polished rock inside it, her eyes rolled back, and she fell unconscious to the ground.\nWhenever a report came that one of the meddlers had been spreading their own version of history, one of us had to pay these storied steppes a visit. Years ago in my native strand, I defied that order, embarking on this endeavor instead.\nIt\u2019s now Ransom\u2019s turn to rebel.\nWhat would my name have been had the recovery mission not whisked my parents away to be burned for their fragment collection?\nI glance at Ransom Prime\u2014my spitting image. She has no answer to that. Only tears right now.\nMinutes ago, my sweet Sarawa\u2014seeing her finally awake\u2014entered the makeshift operating room and broke the news. We had to surgically remove her implant when it looked like she was minutes from brain death.\nShe held herself and bawled into the mattress while Sarawa tried to comfort her. I waited out the worst of it outside. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to relive that moment when\u2014learning I would never channel into my sweepers again\u2014the withdrawals began.\n\u201cYou know the story,\u201d I tell her; my story as well as hers, the infant barely minutes from her mother\u2019s womb. \u201cYou don\u2019t think about it but it\u2019s always with you. You come from meddlers. The Sovereign here killed your parents before they had a chance to tell you your name. Because he never learned it himself, you were spared and conscripted into service as one of Sanctuary 2\u2019s child spies.\u201d\nI sit at the foot of the mattress as she sobs. She rests her head on Sarawa\u2019s chest, her shoulders like an engine failing to start. In my native strand, I\u2019ve been here, on a similar bridge, stable enough to have enveloped the homestead over time. My strand was also called the Sovereign\u2019s Prime until another Ransom Nu\u2019Terra entered it and followed steps to kill the technically immortal Cletus Nu\u2019Dawn.\n\u201cThey were going to name you Inzi,\u201d I tell this one. \u201cInzinaga sur-Amat.\u201d\nShe pulls away from Sarawa. Sitting up, she takes a moment to halt her sniffling, then nods. Right about here is where I too began to understand. Inzi who came down to lay the enemy commander low. Ransom Prime faces me and, for the first time, doesn\u2019t see just herself. She sees someone so inevitable as to barrel through legend and truth in search of her.\n\u201cYou know what it means?\u201d I ask. Watching her close her eyes the same way I did, a lingering disgust at myself that can\u2019t be helped makes me consider denying her its meaning. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. You don\u2019t speak the language. You went to great lengths to make sure you didn\u2019t pick up any of it so you\u2019d never be reminded who you are. I did that as well.\u201d\nA new round of tears well in her eyes, triggering unpleasant memories inside me. Age six was when I had it ingrained that my parents had spoken a language that conditioned them toward rebellion and led to them choosing their meddling stones over me.\n\u201cInzi-na-ga . . . \u201d I get up and move closer toward the room\u2019s window so I don\u2019t have to face her. \u201cStone of us\u2014our stone.\u201d\nI consider telling her about Timoh\u2019s meddling stones. Up to nineteen now and momentarily in my possession, they\u2019ve been smoothed into a distinct variety of shapes that, when held together, unlock configurations able to shield both the stones and any transients around them from detection. Where she\u2019s going, all we know about the August Meteorite and have kept to ourselves will be revealed to her.\nThrough the window, I see her ride there; the launchpad inside the shed with boosters and a passenger capsule now ready to board.\nWhen she\u2019s ready, she\u2019ll slip into a pressure suit without protest while I swap my coverall for her fatigues and burgundy cloak.\nInside the shed, she\u2019ll board the capsule willingly, then smile.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right about this working,\u201d she\u2019ll say.\n\u201cThis bridge we\u2019re on goes to many places,\u201d I\u2019ll explain while helping her with the safety belts. \u201cWhen the girls warned you against running, they were only worried you\u2019d end up in a strand too alien for you to survive.\u201d\nThough the girl doesn\u2019t know the extent of it, Caruwa escaped a strand where her own grandpa Timoh and her parents were interred and later executed.\n\u201cThis endeavor isn\u2019t without risk,\u201d I\u2019ll add.\nSix miles in the air above this compound, the bridge connects to a strand where a station orbiting Sanctuary 2 takes us in \u2019til we are fully recovered, then sends us out to infiltrate more strands.\nOutside the shed, I\u2019ll be joined by Sarawa, Fig, Timoh, and the girls. Together we\u2019ll watch Ransom Prime lift off, then slip out of this strand.\nI\u2019ll kiss Sarawa and the others after that, then\u2014with the sweepers in tow\u2014walk the roundabout path leading safely back to the flyer."}

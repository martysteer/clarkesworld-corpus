Today, we start on the path to the next hundred. Unlike last time, I can start this journey knowing Clarkesworld can make it there, but I\u2019d be foolish if I claimed I knew what it will look like when we arrive. Our first hundred happened during a time of immense change for both print and digital publishing and it doesn\u2019t look like that turmoil is over. I\u2019ll put money on that continuing to be a good thing. Coming from a technology background, I\u2019ve always viewed change as an opportunity.\nWhen we just focus on the next year or so, it becomes easier to describe what we\u2019d like to see happening. If you\u2019ve paid attention to our Patreon, Joyride, or Kickstarter campaigns, you\u2019ve already caught a glimpse of that agenda, but let me break it down here for you.\nInclude Four Original Stories in Each Issue\nAt present, we\u2019re alternating between three and four original stories per issue. The fourth story has been funded by our Patreon supporters, who, at this moment, are within fifty dollars per month of funding three more stories per year and three hundred short of achieving the complete goal.\nInclude a Translated Story in Every Issue\nI\u2019ve already made my position on the importance of translation clear in a previous editorial. Last year\u2019s Kickstarter campaign helped us secure our first-year funding for a translation slot, but we want this to continue. To ensure the future of this program, we need to make a focused push to increase our subscriber base.\nOther Fiction Changes\nAt this time, I don\u2019t have plans to increase our original fiction content past the five mentioned above, but when the budget can sustain it, the length cap will be raised. Over the last year, several of our reprints have crossed into the ten thousand word territory. Call it an experiment or a taste of things to come.\nChanges and Improvements to Our Podcast\nSince Joyride is podcast-oriented, we\u2019ve mentioned a few of our plans for this area over there. Our first goal there is to build a budget to allow us to make improvements to the quality of our audio. That covers everything from better equipment and software to hosting costs for higher quality audio files. There is always room for improvement and we want to make sure we can provide the best we can for our listeners.\nAfter reaching that first goal, we\u2019re going to work on content-related projects like making sure the audio budget for the translations is in place and bringing some of our non-fiction content over to the podcast.\nThe Future of Our Non-fiction\nDue to time considerations, Daniel Abraham has stepped down from his every-other-issue commitment to our Another Word column. We\u2019re sad to see him go and wish him all the best, but his absence will have an impact on the future of the column. We are currently evaluating what direction we should take next and you may notice some experimentation over the next year.\nYou might have noticed that we have two interviews this month. Expect this to happen a bit more often in the future. The focus on these will be foreign authors and artists. I\u2019m particularly interested in featuring them in some way and think this is a good way to spotlight them.\nAs I mentioned, we\u2019d also like to produce non-fiction content in the podcast. Just reading the article from our issue might be ok, but when we go in that direction, I\u2019d like to see something that embraces the medium and discusses the article. Maybe we could do a live Q&A that is released later as a podcast. There are a lot of opportunities to do something different and some of those will likely bleed back into the way we publishing the material in text form.\nSubscriptions & Anthologies & Print Issues\nThis month, we started offering people the opportunity to subscribe (or give gift subscriptions) directly through us. We\u2019re employing the infrastructure that we created to provide our Kickstarter rewards, but have plans to expand upon it as more people use it. If you have an existing subscription elsewhere, we don\u2019t want you to drop those and switch. That would impact our sales rankings at those sites and maintaining or improving those values is important to attracting new subscribers. We\u2019re aiming this system towards the first-time subscriber.\nOur annual anthologies are going to continue to be published in print and ebook formats. Starting with Year Nine, the volumes will be split into two books due to size. Year Seven (February 2015) and Year Eight (July 2015) will be single volume books.\nDiscussions about print subscriptions are ongoing. We will offer them in a more convenient way, but shipping costs remain a concern and will have an impact on pricing. Some of our readers have made it clear that we should aim for the best we can do and then let them decide how much is too much, so that\u2019s what we plan to do. It could be another month or two before we have this nailed down.\nStaffing\nWith the exception of some changes or additions to our regular slate of interviewers or narrators, I don\u2019t foresee any changes to our staffing. The long-term goal for this category remains pay increases. I made this a top priority after my heart attack and while we\u2019ve made gains in this area, we still have a long way to go. As I\u2019ve said before, if we convert just ten percent of our non-subscribing readers, we can achieve this and many of the goals mentioned above.\nFunding\nEvery now and then a concerted push is needed to move an organization forward. To that end, here are our six-month goals for funding:\n- Increase subscriptions by five hundred (less than 1.5% of our readership, securing translations and minor pay increases for staff)\n- Reach the $1000 goal at Patreon (securing our fourth fiction slot)\n- Reach our $250 goal at Joyride (establishing our podcast improvements budget)\n- Fill all advertising slots on website (staff budget)\nYou\u2019ve been on this road with us and I thank you for your support and feedback.

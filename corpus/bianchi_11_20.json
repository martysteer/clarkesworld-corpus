I mean, the ones I made when I was a teenager, long before any bio-tailored inks or whatever other fancy stuff the youngsters use nowadays. Their colors are almost gone, just like you said they would be when I came home from the studio for the first time, plastic foil wrapped around my sore wrist. I wish I could say this to you in person. I wish I could hear you answering: \u201cI told you so, Jana\u00edna, but you\u2019re too headstrong to hear me!\u201d\n\u201cDor, my dear, would you please play a vid from M\u00e3e?\u201d I ask.\nDiadorim, my dear caregiver, comes from the kitchen, dishcloth in hand.\n\u201cSure, Dona Jan. But . . . You know, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nI interrupt zir, waving my hand. I know what ze\u2019ll be saying: Mom died when the high definition spherical cams were just starting to get popular, so there\u2019s not enough raw material for good simulations. Ze says this every damn time I ask zir to see her, and every damn time I need to tell zir I prefer an old but honest video than a perfect but hollow sim. She died much before the advent of synthetic people, but if M\u00e3e could meet Diadorim, I\u2019m sure she would call zir headstrong. Then she would offer zir some coffee, and a piece of cornmeal cake, and they would exchange recipes, and end up being best friends after half an hour\u2014because that\u2019s who she was.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a sim, Dor. Please show me the original stuff. Let me see . . . The one in which she\u2019s playing with Pipoca\u2019s puppies, maybe? Yes. Please, play that one. She\u2019s so happy in that vid.\u201d\n\u201cYour wish is my command!\u201d Dor says, smiling zir once-last-generation syncle smile. A suspended vid appears at zir side. Ze anchors the projection by stomping zir carbon filter foot and goes back to the kitchen to finish our dinner.\nI smile my centennial woman smile when I see M\u00e3e running around the jaboticaba tree surrounded by cute doggies. I watch it in looping, trying to grasp something new about her\u2014but every detail of her is already engraved in my heart. Unlike the old tattoos, not even a thousand years would make this fade.\n\u201cDinner is ready, passarinha,\u201d says Diadorim. Ze calls me \u201clittle bird\u201d whenever I\u2019m not that cheerful, because ze knows it\u2019s what Mom used to call me. Well, after a couple of years together, ze knows everything about me. They say syncle caregivers know this kind of thing through our vital signs, but I believe they also . . . feel it. Call me stupid, call me old-fashioned, but I simply do. Dor pokes zir head from the kitchen door. \u201cI\u2019m going to fetch you in a minute, Dona Jan.\u201d\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I answer, and dismiss the images with a flick of my hand.\nQue saudades, M\u00e3e. I miss you so much.\nI miss her in all languages in the world.\n<<< diadorimrep_14jan2103\n# calibrating feeling <> VS reading\nsaudades [PT-BR]\n53,47% happiness, 46,53% sadness\n52,23% happiness, 47,77% sadness\n?\nresume >>>\nThe most important thing in a good feijoada is not the pork quality, the softness of the black beans, or how thin you cut the collard greens to serve on the side. The most important thing in a good feijoada is how long you cook the stew, and how big the cauldron is. There\u2019s no such a thing like doing just a little bit of feijoada. Not doing a ton of it is complete nonsense.\nThat\u2019s why the house is full today: five people, four syncle. Nora, Tereza\u2019s granddaughter, is too young to need a caregiver droid. Well, and it seems she\u2019s too young to understand the dynamics of the board game we\u2019re playing too, because she\u2019s losing miserably.\n\u201cThis is not fair,\u201d she exclaims, laughing, when we finish another match. \u201cLua, are you sure you\u2019re off-line?\u201d\n\u201cHey, are you really accusing me of cheating, lady?\u201d Tereza\u2019s caregiver fakes an offended look in her projected expression. \u201cI swear I\u2019m playing only with my Acquired Reasoning Skills module. Do you want me to emit a report to you? Huh?\u201d\n\u201cStop it!\u201d I shake my hands, giggling. \u201cWe\u2019ll not have any prejudiced comments about syncles in this house!\u201d\n\u201cNora, just accept you suck at this game, girl,\u201d says S\u00e9rgio, and we all burst into laughter while Nora rises to grab a cup of water in the kitchen, muttering.\n\u201cHey, dear, would you please serve this old lady more feijoada?\u201d I call her, tapping my belly. \u201cI\u2019m already full, but I think I can indulge myself a second plate of my favorite food, right?\u201d\n\u201cSure, tia. Anybody else wants some more?\u201d asks Nora.\n\u201cMe!\u201d Diadorim raises zir hand.\n\u201cAnd me!\u201d says Lovelace, Ana\u2019s caregiver.\n\u201cI would love to eat more, but I don\u2019t think it would be wise,\u201d says S\u00e9rgio.\n\u201cYeah, better not,\u201d murmurs Tico, their droid. By the faint blue light blinking from behind his eyes, he must be checking S\u00e9rgio\u2019s vital signs\u2014and they\u2019re probably not that good.\nWe all fall in a sudden silence. S\u00e9rgio isn\u2019t that old\u2014they barely reached their hundreds\u2014but they\u2019re sick. Really sick. The scifi stories from my youth proved right in many things, but a miraculous medicine remains a far future thing. And the embarrassment with which we regard imminent death is still the same\u2014maybe even worse than before.\n\u201cThe feijoada is so, so good, Dor. Congrats!\u201d Ana breaks the silence. \u201cIt tastes just like the one Jan\u2019s mom used to cook every year for her birthday. When we still lived in Brazil.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s really freaking good,\u201d says Lovelace.\n\u201cI remember the day Gus put your wedding rings inside his plate,\u201d says Tereza in a wistful tone.\nI start laughing. \u201cDid I tell you this already, S\u00e9rgio?\u201d Me and S\u00e9rgio used to live in the same city back home, but I just met them here, after the diaspora.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t! Go ahead, Jan.\u201d\nI\u2019m almost finishing the story of how Gus pretended he\u2019d found two wedding rings inside Mom\u2019s feijoada and then used them to propose to Ana in front of our group of friends when Nora comes back from the kitchen, three full plates in her hands. She puts them before me, Diadorim, and Lovey.\n\u201cThis is the best story, really,\u201d says Nora. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard it yet, tio S\u00e9rgio? I thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d I suddenly realize I\u2019ve already told it to him. Maybe more than once. Even with all the brain dams they implant on you, your memory isn\u2019t the same when you cross the hundred and ten line.\n\u201cWell, yes, I heard it. A couple of times, actually,\u201d they answer, tenderly. \u201cBut I like the way Jan tells it.\u201d\n\u201cMe too,\u201d says Tereza. \u201cI always laugh my pants off!\u201d\n\u201cI miss those times,\u201d says Ana.\nI look around, to the eight friends at my table. I\u2019m so glad to have them. Some of them were the only thing I had when I arrived here. Besides my grandson and his family, who are always so busy, my friends are all I have now.\nI barely feel like I live in this country. It\u2019s like I live in them. Their friendship is my land\u2014and nobody can force me to leave this one.\n<<< diadorimrep_20apr2103\n# 3 containers of frozen feijoada stored at the upper freezer shelf [expiring date: 20jul2103]\n# $ \u201cmy favorite food\u201d $\n[Feijoada] 89 occurrences\nvs.\n[Pasta] 13 occurrences\n# [DEARDIARY] sometimes people already know a story, but they say they don\u2019t to make the storyteller happy (87% happiness *source: JanVS_20apr2103_10:37pm*)\nresume >>>\nThe colors don\u2019t fade, and this is really cool, but I\u2019m not sure how I feel about the fact it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore to make a tattoo. I mean, you still feel a small discomfort during the process, and people keep calling it pain\u2014but it\u2019s nothing like the real pain you used to feel before.\nDiadorim sees the tattoo artist to the door. I tell zir what I\u2019m thinking.\n\u201cSo, do you like to . . . feel pain?\u201d ze asks me, kind of confused.\n\u201cOh, no. But I do like the idea of pain as a reminder of the cost of things. Before, you needed to make a sacrifice whenever you wanted to record something forever on your skin. It seemed fair.\u201d I pause. \u201cBut you know, pain has always been part of my life. It has always been my best mate.\u201d\nI see the steady amber light turning on behind zir eyes. Ze\u2019s processing.\n\u201cBeautiful words,\u201d ze finally says. Then ze points to the new tattoo. \u201cAnd I loved the art, Dona Jan. Such delicate lines . . . \u201d\nI look at zir. I still don\u2019t understand how exactly ze interprets the beauty of things\u2014neither zir, I guess\u2014but I love the fact ze simply does. And ze\u2019s quite honest, which makes me treasure every remark ze does: syncles don\u2019t lie just to please people. Actually, I\u2019m quite sure it\u2019s not even possible\u2014there was something about it in my purchase contract, if I\u2019m not mistaken, but it doesn\u2019t really mind.\n\u201cThanks, Dor.\u201d I beam at zir. \u201cI still have many ideas for tattoos, but I believe this one is going to be the last one. I don\u2019t have much . . . space left, after all.\u201d\nI admire my arms, covered by drawings I made over time. Some colors are almost gone, and many shapes merged one with another along the years. The new whirlwind near my left elbow is even more bright and vivid in contrast with them.\n\u201cA whirlwind. May I?\u201d ze asks, and I nod. Ze stretches zir hand and touches my instantaneously healed skin. Ze starts emanating a white, blinking light from zir eyes, Googling something\u2014the possible meanings of the tattoo, I suppose. \u201cWhy did you choose it?\u201d\nI sigh. I don\u2019t like to talk much about it. But maybe I need to.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a triple tribute, Dor. First, to my favorite book. Second, to my profession\u2014the one I needed to leave when I moved here.\u201d Did I really need to? I notice Diadorim\u2019s inquisitive looking. \u201cWould you please read the first sentence of Grande Sert\u00e3o: Veredas?\u201d\nA white light blinks for an instant.\n\u201c\u2018The Devil in the street, in the middle of the whirlwind,\u2019\u201d ze recites.\n\u201cOh, silly me.\u201d I interrupt zir, shaking my head. \u201cI forgot to specify. Please, read the original version, my dear. In Portuguese.\u201d\n\u201cOh. It\u2019s because my default lang\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Dor.\u201d\nZe notices my discomfort and places a hand on my shoulder.\n\u201cOK, so here it goes, passarinha: \u2018O Diabo na rua, no meio do redemoinho . . . \u2019\u201d ze declaims and pauses. \u201c\u2018Redemoinho\u2019 . . . I like how it sounds.\u201d\nI smile at zir perfect Portuguese.\n\u201cYou already know what it means, of course,\u201d I say, and ze nods. \u201cWhat you probably didn\u2019t notice is Guimar\u00e3es Rosa made an untranslatable joke in the very first words of his masterpiece. Would you project the sentence here?\u201d\nThe letters appear before me. I reach my hand and select the D, the E, the M, and the O from redemoinho.\n\u201cSee? \u2018Demo,\u2019\u201d I say.\n\u201c\u2018Devil\u2019 in Portuguese,\u201d Dor translates immediately. I see a single blinking of the amber light when ze notices it. \u201cWow.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. He literally put a devil right in the middle of the whirlwind.\u201d I make the words vanish from the air by shaking my head. \u201cI always pitied the poor colleagues who would eventually be assigned to the mission of translating the book to another language.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d ze repeats, and take my hands in zir.\n\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a whirlwind,\u201d I say, while I feel zir warmth. Zir perfect 98.6\u00b0F warmth. What else I would say to him? Oh, yeah. \u201cNow, Dor, would you please call Benjamin? I want to show my new tattoo to him, to Liz, and to Emma.\u201d\n\u201cSure, Dona Jan,\u201d ze says, and zir eyes emanate an amber color. Ze apparently elaborates very carefully the text message before calling\u2014and I\u2019m glad ze does. I mean, I\u2019m one hundred and fourteen already. Someday soon, Diadorim will need to call them to give some sad news. I don\u2019t want them to be startled whenever I call. The light turns off. \u201cThey said they\u2019ll be ready in five minutes.\u201d\nI feel my heart beating faster when the three of them appear in the projection. Diadorim stomps and the interactive plane remains stationary in front of my face. I smile\u2014they look so happy to see me. So happy to see me well.\nI show them my new tattoo, and we talk a little bit. I always talk more than them, because that\u2019s who I am, but they\u2019re such good listeners. When I say I miss them, Ben ensures they\u2019ll come to visit me as soon as Liz gets some vacations\u2014but babies just come whenever they want, so it\u2019s not as easy as it seems. I know it. He already said this a couple of times since they last came to visit me, four or five years before, and I understand it.\n\u201cWhat do you think about November, huh?\u201d\nOh. I feel my smile widening. He never mentioned November. This is new.\n\u201cWe need to go, Gramma. You know\u2014business,\u201d says Ben.\nBusiness, always business. They wave me goodbye.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, Emma,\u201d I murmur, and she smiles coyly. She\u2019s twenty-four or twenty-five, but it looks like she\u2019s eighteen.\n\u201cThanks, Bisa. You didn\u2019t change a bit too,\u201d she answers, and we all burst into laughter. \u201cBye!\u201d\nDor smiles at me. I pull my right sleeve up to see the long branch tattoo full of inky birds: the few ones who migrated with me, the ones I met here, the one that hatched from the egg I laid in this new land\u2014and who later laid her own egg already here.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve many appointments, Dor,\u201d I say, with my heart warm. \u201cBut, just in case: please block all the days of November in my calendar.\u201d\n<<< diadorimrep_27may2103\n# whirlwind triple tribute\n1- To Guimar\u00e3es Rosa\u2019s masterpiece, Grande Sert\u00e3o: Veredas (*source: Jan*)\n2- To her fellow translators (*source: Jan*)\n3- To me (?)\nDiadorim: coprotagonist of Grande Sert\u00e3o: Veredas.

And, like so many other times, I wasn\u2019t now.\n\u201cPlease, Dor, play it again.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure, passarinha?\u201d ze asks, sounding concerned. \u201cYou already heard it eight\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nI hear Tico\u2019s words again. In a toneless voice, he gives all the details about the funeral and the cremation. I ask Diadorim to add the info to my calendar\u2014I don\u2019t think ze\u2019ll take me there in person, being so concerned about my health as ze is, but at least I can show up virtually.\nLater, I\u2019m experiencing a holo of a movie I used to watch when I was a child when I smell it. Soon after, Dor appears at the living room with two plates full of feijoada. Ze assembles a table before us and sits beside me.\nI place a spoonful in my mouth and slowly munch it.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dor.\u201d I sigh, laying the spoon on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like eating.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Zir eyes blink with different colors. \u201cThe expiration date . . . Wait\u2014\u201d\nThe light beside zir eyes stabilizes at a purple tone while ze chews carefully. In some specialized syncles, like zir, the same sensors that allow them to taste food are also capable of analyzing dozens of potential irregularities in a food sample.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not spoiled, Dor. It\u2019s just . . . me,\u201d I say, and the light is gone. \u201cGo ahead, my friend, eat it. Enjoy it for me.\u201d\nZe hesitates but ends up eating zir plate and mine when I say it\u2019s going to the trash anyway.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling good . . . \u201d Ze wipes zir mouth. \u201c . . . we can go in person.

Let\u2019s see.\u201d\nI rest my head over zir shoulder.

I mean, nobody would\u2014not naturally, at least. In an era of so many technological revolutions, and for the fertile mind of a teenage scifi fan, it was easy to project that sooner or later someone would end up discovering a way of cheating death before I was too old to benefit of it.\nI could say I forgot about that while I grew older, but it would be a lie. I believed in that until the end\u2014which happens to be now.\nI\u2019m dying.\nAnd I only know this because Diadorim bursts into my bedroom, zir eyes red with alert. Maximum alert. But to be very honest? I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dying. Yes, my hands and feet are numb, and I do feel sleepy and cold. Why is it so cold in here, by the way? But anyway, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m dying.\n\u201cDona Jan!\u201d There\u2019s fear in zir voice. Is that possible? Are syncles able to fear? Why have I never thought about it?

The words left my mouth before I could think about it\u2014death is for those who die, the master sentence I chose to say whenever I need or want to overwrite all my caregiver\u2019s protocols. They were the first words Diadorim ever heard me saying.\n\u201cDona Jan, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI want to see you, my dear,\u201d I say.\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d Ze modules the ambient light until we\u2019re in a warm, yellowy dim light. \u201cWhat . . . do I do now? Without my protocols\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust make the room warmer, I\u2019m so cold,\u201d I say, and ze nods. \u201cGood. Now, come closer, my dear. And just . . . be with me.\u201d\n\u201cJust be with you,\u201d ze mutters, and sits in a chair we keep by my bed. \u201cDo you want me to call your family?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I do. But not yet.\u201d Even though I\u2019m so sleepy, I still can see fear in Dor eyes. I suddenly regret the things I didn\u2019t ask zir. I regret the things I didn\u2019t tell zir. \u201cDo you know where your name came from?\u201d\nZe opens zir mouth, then closes it, zir eyes in a frantic amber light.\n\u201cOh, of course you know it.\u201d I give a short laugh. \u201cYou know everything.\u201d\nZe shook zir head and the light turns off.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Go ahead, Jan.\u201d\nI smile and tell zir all I know about Diadorim. Everything I still know. Many things I simply can\u2019t remember, but ze can Google it later. Except\u2014\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d I say. \u201cYour nickname. Dor. In Portuguese, it means\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Pain.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIt has always been your best mate,\u201d ze murmurs.\nBut now it\u2019s time to let it go, I think.\n\u201cCall them now, Dor, please. Benzinho.\u201d\nThey take some time to answer. Of course\u2014it\u2019s so late now. When they appear in the vid, however, I see daylight coming from their windows. Should they have daylight now? I can\u2019t think properly\u2014I\u2019m really, really sleepy. They look concerned, but I\u2019m not sure. My vision is getting so blurry . . . They say something about . . . Feijoada? I doze off. I wake up a couple of seconds later. Maybe a hundred years later. What day is it? Is it November already? Their words are all mixed up. Is it English? Portuguese?\nI feel someone raising my upper body from the bed. I\u2019m in someone\u2019s arms now. I don\u2019t feel so cold anymore. It\u2019s\u2014\n\u201cMom?\u201d I murmur. She\u2019s checking my tattooed arms. Caressing them. It feels so good. I had something important to tell her . . . What was it? Oh, yeah. \u201cM\u00e3e, you\u2019re right: my tattoos are fading.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re so beautiful, passarinha,\u201d she says, and gently bows her head to kiss the tattoo near my elbow. \u201cS\u00e3o t\u00e3o lindas.\u201d\nOh, this one is new. I did it last month. Last year. In another life. And this tattoo? This one isn\u2019t fading, M\u00e3e. This one will not fade at all.\nThat\u2019s what I want to say, but I\u2019m so comfortable and sleepy and cozy now . . . She is doing me cafun\u00e9. Stroking my head for me to sleep. There\u2019s something else I need to tell her, but I bet she already knows it. She knows everything.\nI close my eyes and let it go.\n<<< diadorimrep_16aug2103\n# simulation ben&fam178 interrupted\n# time of death 03:48am\n# RESTINPEACE PROTOCOL: < active >\n# messagesto: $ Benjamin (Benzinho) $\n##001 Sub: Hey, guys, I\u2019m Diadorim!

It was at the corpse\u2019s side. The woman\u2019s death was proven to be natural (multiple organ failure), with no probable involvement of the syncle (under police investigation). The syncle carried off Rest in Peace Protocol correctly, although there was an interval of 37 minutes with no recorded activity (both audio and video [Failure F58]) between steps 6 and 7.\nNote: The syncle was found with a simple bird/seagull doodle recently engraved on its left arm synchderm. Police will determine if it was self-inflicted or not. GeroAssist3Plus\u00ae #071227\u2019s Pain Module, however, was never deactivated.\nJana Bianchi is a Brazilian writer, translator, editor at Mafagafo magazine, cohostess of the Curta Ficcao writing podcast, and one of the organizers of Relampeio Festival and FutureCon.

Actually, it\u2019s not easy at all. You have to drill a series of very small holes in the broken pieces, then thread short lengths of wire through the holes, then twist the ends of the wires together really tight, so as to draw the bits together firmly enough to make the pot watertight. In order to do the job you need a very hard, sharp, thin drill bit, a good eye, loads of patience, and at least three pairs of rock-steady hands. The tinker had quoted me a turner and a quarter; get lost, I told him, I\u2019ll do it myself. It was beginning to dawn on me that some sorts of work are properly reserved for specialists.\n Ah, the irony.\n Stupid of me to break it in the first place. I\u2019m not usually that clumsy. Stumbling about in the dark, was how I explained it. You should\u2019ve lit a lamp, then, shouldn\u2019t you, she said. I pointed out that you don\u2019t need a lamp in the long summer evenings. She smirked at me. I don\u2019t think she quite understands how finely balanced our financial position is. We\u2019re not hard up, nothing like that. There\u2019s absolutely no question of having to sell off any of the land, or take out mortgages. It\u2019s just that, if we carry on wasting money unnecessarily on lamp-oil and tinkers and like frivolities, there\u2019ll come a time when the current slight reduction in our income will start to be a mild nuisance. Only temporary, of course. The hard times will pass, and soon we\u2019ll all be just fine.\n Like I said, the irony.\n \u201cEbba\u2019s here to see you,\u201d she said.\n She could see I was busy. \u201cHe\u2019ll have to come back,\u201d I snapped. I had three little bits of wire gripped between my lips, which considerably reduced my snapping power.\n \u201cHe said it\u2019s urgent.\u201d\n \u201cFine.\u201d I put down the pot\u2014call it that, no way it was a pot anymore. It was disjointed memories of the shape of a pot, loosely tied together with metal string, like the scale armor the other side wore in Outremer. \u201cSend him up.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s not coming up here in those boots,\u201d she said, and at once I realized that no, he wasn\u2019t, not when she was using that tone of voice. \u201cAnd why don\u2019t you just give up on that? You\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d\n Women have no patience. \u201cThe tinker\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThat bit doesn\u2019t go there.\u201d\n I dropped the articulated mess on the floor and walked past her, down the stairs, into the great hall. Great, in this context, is strictly a comparative term.\n Ebba and I understand each other. For a start, he\u2019s practically the same age as me\u2014I\u2019m a week younger; so what? We both grew up silently ashamed of our fathers (his father Ossun was the laziest man on the estate; mine\u2014well) and we\u2019re both quietly disappointed with our children. He took over his farm shortly before I came home from Outremer, so we both sort of started off being responsible for our own destinies around the same time. I have no illusions about him, and I can\u2019t begin to imagine he has any about me. He\u2019s medium height, bald and thin, stronger than he looks and smarter than he sounds. He used to set up the targets and pick up the arrows for me when I was a boy; never used to say anything, just stood there looking bored.\n He had that look on his face. He told me I wasn\u2019t going to believe what he was about to tell me.\n The thing about Ebba is, he has absolutely no imagination. Not even when roaring drunk\u2014whimpering drunk in his case; very rare occurrence, in case you\u2019ve got the impression he\u2019s what she calls basically-no-good. About twice a year, specific anniversaries. I have no idea what they\u2019re the anniversaries of, and of course I don\u2019t ask. Twice a year, then, he sits in the hayloft with a big stone jar and only comes out when it\u2019s empty. Not, is the point I\u2019m trying to make, prone to seeing things not strictly speaking there.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a dragon,\u201d he said.\n Now Ossun, his father, saw all manner of weird and wonderful things. \u201cDon\u2019t be bloody stupid,\u201d I said. He just looked at me. Ebba never argues or contradicts; doesn\u2019t need to.\n \u201cAll right,\u201d I said, and the words just sort of squeezed out, like a fat man in a narrow doorway. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n \u201cDown Merebarton.\u201d\n A brief digression concerning dragons.\n There\u2019s no such thing. However, there\u2019s the White Drake (its larger cousin, the Blue Drake, is now almost certainly extinct). According to Hrabanus\u2019 Imperfect Bestiary, the White Drake is a native of the large and entirely unexpected belt of marshes you stumble into after you\u2019ve crossed the desert, going from Crac Boamond to the sea. Hrabanus thinks it\u2019s a very large bat, but conscientiously cites Priscian, who holds that it\u2019s a featherless bird, and Saloninus, who maintains that it\u2019s a winged lizard. The White Drake can get to be five feet long\u2014that\u2019s nose to tip-of-tail; three feet of that is tail, but it can still give you a nasty nip. They launch themselves out of trees, which can be horribly alarming (I speak from personal experience). White Drakes live almost exclusively on carrion and rotting fruit, rarely attack unless provoked, and absolutely definitely don\u2019t breathe fire.\n White Drakes aren\u2019t found outside Outremer. Except, some idiot of a nobleman brought back five breeding pairs about a century ago, to decorate the grounds of his castle. Why people do these things, I don\u2019t know. My father tried to keep peacocks once. As soon as we opened the cage they were off like arrows from the bowstring; next heard of six miles away, and could we please come and do something about them, because they were pecking the thatch out in handfuls. My father rode over that way, happening to take his bow with him. No more was ever said about peacocks.\n Dragons, by contrast, are nine to ten feet long excluding the tail; they attack on sight, and breathe fire. At any rate, this one did.\n Three houses and four barns in Merebarton, two houses and a hayrick in Stile. Nobody hurt yet, but only a matter of time. A dozen sheep carcasses, stripped to the bone. One shepherd reported being followed by the horrible thing: he saw it, it saw him, he turned and ran; it just sort of drifted along after him, hardly a wingbeat, as if mildly curious. When he couldn\u2019t run any further, he tried crawling down a badger hole. Got stuck, head down the hole, legs sticking up in the air. He reckoned he felt the thump as the thing pitched down next to him, heard the snuffling\u2014like a bull, he reckoned; felt its warm breath on his ankles. Time sort of stopped for a while, and then it went away again. The man said it was the first time he\u2019d pissed himself and felt the piss running down his chest and dripping off his chin. Well, there you go.\n The Brother at Merebarton appears to have taken charge, the way they do. He herded everyone into the grain store\u2014stone walls, yes, but a thatched roof; you\u2019d imagine even a Brother would\u2019ve watched them making charcoal some time\u2014and sent a terrified young kid off on a pony to, guess what. You\u2019ve got it. Fetch the knight.\n At this point, the story recognizes (isn\u2019t that what they say in Grand Council?) Dodinas le Cure Hardy, age fifty-six, knight, of the honors of Westmoor, Merebarton, East Rew, Middle Side, and Big Room; veteran of Outremer (four years, so help me), in his day a modest success on the circuit\u2014three second places in ranking tournaments, two thirds, usually in the top twenty out of an average field of forty or so. Through with all that a long time ago, though. I always knew I was never going to be one of those gaunt, terrifying old men who carry on knocking \u2019em down and getting knocked down into their sixties. I had an uncle like that, Petipas of Lyen. I saw him in a tournament when he was sixty-seven, and some young giant bashed him off his horse. Uncle landed badly, and I watched him drag himself up off the ground, so desperately tired. I was only, what, twelve; even I could see, every last scrap of flesh and bone was yelling, don\u2019t want to do this anymore. But he stood up, shamed the young idiot into giving him a go on foot, and proceeded to use his head as an anvil for ten minutes before graciously accepting his surrender. There was so much anger in that performance\u2014not at the kid, for showing him up, Uncle wasn\u2019t like that. He was furious with himself for getting old, and he took it out on the only target available. I thought the whole thing was disturbing and sad. I won\u2019t ever be like that, I told myself.\n (The question was, is: why? I can understand fighting. I fought\u2014really fought\u2014in Outremer. I did it because I was afraid the other man was going to kill me. So happens my defense has always been weak, so I compensate with extreme aggression. Never could keep it going for very long, but on the battlefield that\u2019s not usually an issue. So I attacked anything that moved with white-hot ferocity fueled entirely and exclusively by ice-cold fear. Tournaments, though, jousting, behourd, the grand melee\u2014what was the point? I have absolutely no idea, except that I did feel very happy indeed on those rare occasions when I got a little tin trophy to take home. Was that enough to account for the pain of being laid up six weeks with two busted ribs? Of course it wasn\u2019t. We do it because it\u2019s what we do; one of my father\u2019s more profound statements. Conversely, I remember my aunt: silly woman, too soft for her own good. She kept these stupid big white chickens, and when they got past laying she couldn\u2019t bear to have their necks pulled. Instead, they were taken out into the woods and set free, meaning in real terms fed to the hawks and foxes. One time, my turn, I lugged down a cage with four hens and two cocks squashed in there, too petrified to move. Now, what draws in the fox is the clucking; so I turned them out in different places, wide apart, so they had nobody to talk to. Released the last hen, walking back down the track; already the two cock birds had found each other, no idea how, and were ripping each other into tissue scraps with their spurs. They do it because it\u2019s what they do. Someone once said, the man who\u2019s tired of killing is tired of life. Not sure I know what that means.)\n A picture is emerging, I hope, of Dodinas le Cure Hardy; while he was active in chivalry he tried to do what was expected of him, but his heart was never in it. Glad, in a way, to be past it and no longer obliged to take part. Instead, prefers to devote himself to the estate, trying to keep the ancestral mess from collapsing in on itself. A man aware of his obligations, and at least some of his many shortcomings.\n Go and fetch the knight, says the fool of a Brother. Tell him\u2014\n On reflection, if I hadn\u2019t seen those wretched White Drakes in Outremer, there\u2019s a reasonable chance I\u2019d have refused to believe in a dragon trashing Merebarton, and then, who knows, it might\u2019ve flown away and bothered someone else. Well, you don\u2019t know, that\u2019s the whole point. It\u2019s that very ignorance that makes life possible. But when Ebba told me what the boy told him he\u2019d seen, immediately I thought; White Drake. Clearly it wasn\u2019t one, but it was close enough to something I\u2019d seen to allow belief to seep into my mind, and then I was done for. No hope.\n Even so, I think I said, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d about six or seven times, until eventually it dawned on me I was making a fool of myself. At which point, a horrible sort of mist of despair settled over me, as I realized that this extraordinary, impossible, grossly and viciously unfair thing had landed on me, and that I was going to have to deal with it.\n But you do your best. You struggle, just as a man crushed under a giant stone still draws in the last one or two desperate whistling breaths; pointless, but you can\u2019t just give up. So I looked him steadily in the eye, and I said, \u201cSo, what do they expect me to do about it?\u201d\n He didn\u2019t say a word. Looked at me.\n \u201cThe hell with that,\u201d I remember shouting. \u201cI\u2019m fifty-six years old, I don\u2019t even hunt boar anymore. I\u2019ve got a stiff knee. I wouldn\u2019t last two minutes.\u201d\n He looked at me. When you\u2019ve known someone all your life, arguing with them is more or less arguing with yourself. Never had much joy with lying to myself. Or anyone else, come to that. Of course, my mother used to say: the only thing I want you not to be the best in the world at is lying. She said a lot of that sort of thing; much better written down on paper rather than said out loud in casual conversation, but of course she couldn\u2019t read or write. She also tended to say: do your duty. I don\u2019t think she ever liked me very much. Loved, of course, but not liked.\n He was looking at me. I felt like that poor devil under the stone (at the siege of Crac des Bests; man I knew slightly). Comes a point when you just can\u2019t breathe anymore.\n We do have a library: forty-seven books. The Imperfect Bestiary is an abridged edition, local copy, drawings are pretty laughable, they make everything look like either a pig or a cow, because that\u2019s all the poor fool who drew it had ever seen. So there I was, looking at a picture of a big white cow with wings, thinking: how in God\u2019s name am I supposed to kill something like that?\n White Drakes don\u2019t breathe fire, but there\u2019s this stupid little lizard in Permia somewhere that does. About eighteen inches long, otherwise completely unremarkable; not to put too fine a point on it, it farts through its mouth and somehow contrives to set fire to it. You see little flashes and puffs of smoke among the reed beds. So it\u2019s possible. Wonderful.\n (Why would anything want to do that? Hrabanus, who has an answer for every damn thing, points out that the reed beds would clog up the delta, divert the flowing water and turn the whole of South Permia into a fetid swamp if it wasn\u2019t for the frequent, regular fires, which clear off the reed and lay down a thick bed of fertile ash, just perfect for everything else to grow sweet and fat and provide a living for the hundreds of species of animals and birds who live there. The fires are started by the lizards, who appear to serve no other function. Hrabanus points to this as proof of the Divine Clockmaker theory. I think they do it because it\u2019s what they do, though I\u2019m guessing the lizards who actually do the fire-starting are resentful younger sons. Tell you about my brother in a minute.)\n She found me in the library. Clearly she\u2019d been talking to Ebba. \u201cWell?\u201d she said.\n I told her what I\u2019d decided to do. She can pull this face of concentrated scorn and fury. It\u2019s so intensely eloquent, there\u2019s really no need for her to add words. But she does. Oh, she does.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got no choice,\u201d I protested. \u201cI\u2019m the knight.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re fifty-six and you get out of breath climbing the stairs. And you\u2019re proposing to fight dragons.\u201d\n It\u2019s a black lie about the stairs. Just that one time; and that was the clock-tower. Seventy-seven steps to the top. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cLast bloody thing I want\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLast bloody thing you\u2019ll ever do, if you\u2019re stupid enough to do it.\u201d She never swears, except when quoting me back at myself. \u201cJust think for a minute, will you? If you get yourself killed, what\u2019ll happen to this place?\u201d\n \u201cI have no intention of getting myself\u2014\u201d\n \u201cFlorian\u2019s too young to run the estate,\u201d she went on, as though I hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cThat clown of a bailiff of yours can\u2019t be trusted to remember to breathe without someone standing over him. On top of which, there\u2019s heriot and wardship, that\u2019s hundreds and hundreds of thalers we simply haven\u2019t got, which means having to sell land, and once you start doing that you might as well load up a handcart and take to the roads, because\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAbsolutely no intention of getting killed,\u201d I said.\n \u201cAnd for crying out loud don\u2019t shout,\u201d she shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough you\u2019re worrying me to death without yelling at me as well. I don\u2019t know why you do this to me. Do you hate me, or something?\u201d\n We were four and a quarter seconds away from tears, and I really can\u2019t be doing with that. \u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cSo tell me. What do I do?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, do I? I don\u2019t get myself into these ridiculous messes.\u201d I wish I could do that; I should be able to. After all, it\u2019s the knight\u2019s move, isn\u2019t it? A step at right angles, then jump clean over the other man\u2019s head. \u201cWhat about that useless brother of yours? Send him.\u201d\n The dreadful thing is, the same thought had crossed my mind. It\u2019d be\u2014well, not acceptable, but within the rules, meaning there\u2019s precedents. Of course, I\u2019d have to be practically bedridden with some foul but honorable disease. Titurel is ten years younger than me and still competing regularly on the circuit, though at the time he was three miles away, at the lodge, with some female he\u2019d found somewhere. And if I really was ill\u2014\n I was grateful to her. If she hadn\u2019t suggested it, I might just have considered it. As it was; \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d I said. \u201cJust think, if I was to chicken out and Titurel actually managed to kill this bloody thing. We\u2019ve got to live here. He\u2019d be insufferable.\u201d\n She breathed through her nose; like, dare I say it, one of the D things. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cThough how precisely it\u2019s better for you to get killed and your appalling brother moves in and takes over running the estate\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI am not going to get killed,\u201d I said.\n \u201cBut there, you never listen to me, so I might as well save my breath.\u201d She paused and scowled at me. \u201cWell?\u201d\n Hard, sometimes, to remember that when I married her, she was the Fair Maid of Lannandale. \u201cWell what?\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n \u201cOh,\u201d he said, sort of half-turning and wiping his forehead on his forearm. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d\n Another close contemporary of mine. He\u2019s maybe six months older than me, took over the forge just before my father died. He\u2019s never liked me. Still, we understand each other. He\u2019s not nearly as good a tradesman as he thinks he is, but he\u2019s good enough.\n \u201cCome to pay me for those harrows?\u201d he said.\n \u201cNot entirely,\u201d I replied. \u201cI need something made.\u201d\n \u201cOf course you do.\u201d He turned his back on me, dragged something orange-hot out from under the coals, and bashed it, very hard, very quickly, for about twenty seconds. Then he shoved it back under the coals and hauled on the bellows handle a dozen times. Then he had leisure to talk to me. \u201cI\u2019ll need a deposit.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d I said. There was a small heap of tools piled up on the spare anvil. I moved them carefully aside and spread out my scraps of parchment. \u201cNow, you\u2019ll need to pay attention.\u201d\n The parchment I\u2019d drawn my pathetic attempts at sketches on was the fly-leaf out of Monomachus of Teana\u2019s Principles of Mercantile Law. I\u2019d had just enough left over to use for a very brief note, which I\u2019d folded four times, sealed, and sent the stable boy off to deliver. It came back, folded the other way; and under my message, written in big crude handwriting, smudged for lack of sand\u2014\n What the hell do you want it for?\n I wasn\u2019t in the mood. I stamped back into the house (I\u2019d been out in the barn, rummaging about in the pile of old junk), got out the pen and ink and wrote sideways up the margin (only just enough room, writing very small)\u2014\n No time. Please. Now.\n I underlined please twice. The stable boy had wandered off somewhere, so I sent the kitchenmaid. She whined about having to go out in her indoors shoes. I ask you.\n Moddo the blacksmith is one of those men who gets caught up in the job in hand. He whinges and complains, then the problems of doing the job snag his imagination, and then your main difficulty is getting it away from him when it\u2019s finished, because he\u2019s just come up with some cunning little modification which\u2019ll make it ever so slightly, irrelevantly better.\n He does good work. I was so impressed I paid cash.\n \u201cYour design was useless, so I changed it,\u201d he\u2019d said. A bit of an overstatement. What he\u2019d done was to substitute two thin springs for one fat one, and add on a sort of ratchet thing taken off a millers\u2019 winch, to make it easier to wind it up. It was still sticky with the oil he\u2019d quenched it in. The sight of it made my flesh crawl.\n Basically, it was just a very, very large gin trap, with an offset pressure plate. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d I said. \u201cThink about it. Think about birds. In order to get off the ground, they\u2019ve got very light bones, right?\u201d\n Ebba shrugged: if you say so.\n \u201cWell,\u201d I told him, \u201cthey have. And you break a bird\u2019s leg, it can\u2019t get off the ground. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the same with this bastard. We put out a carcass, with this underneath. It stands on the carcass, braces it with one foot so it can tear it up with the other. Bang, got him. This thing ought to snap the bugger\u2019s leg like a carrot, and then it won\u2019t be going anywhere in a hurry, you can be sure of that.\u201d\n He frowned. I could tell the sight of the trap scared him, like it did me. The mainspring was three eighths of an inch thick. Just as well Moddo thought to add a cocking mechanism. \u201cYou\u2019ll still have to kill it, though,\u201d he said.\n I grinned at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, the hell with that. Just keep everybody and their livestock well away for a week until it starves to death.\u201d\n He was thinking about it. I waited. \u201cIf it can breathe fire,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cmaybe it can melt the trap off.\u201d\n \u201cAnd burn through its own leg in the process. Also,\u201d I added\u2014I\u2019d considered this very point\u2014\u201ceven without the trap it\u2019s still crippled, it won\u2019t be able to hunt and feed. Just like a bird that\u2019s got away from the cat.\u201d\n He pulled a small frown that means, well, maybe. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a carcass.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s that sick goat,\u201d I said.\n Nod. His sick goat. Well, I can\u2019t help it if all my animals are healthy.\n He went off with the small cart to fetch the goat. A few minutes later, a big wagon crunched down to the yard gate and stopped just in time. Too wide to pass through; it\u2019d have got stuck.\n Praise be, Marhouse had sent me the scorpion. Rather less joy and happiness, he\u2019d come along with it, but never mind.\n The scorpion is genuine Mezentine, two hundred years old at least. Family tradition says Marhouse\u2019s great-great-and-so-forth-grandfather brought it back from the Grand Tour, as a souvenir. More likely, his grandfather took it in part exchange or to settle a bad debt; but to acknowledge that would be to admit that two generations back they were still in trade.\n \u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Marhouse said, hopping down off the wagon box, \u201cdo you want it for?\u201d\n He\u2019s all right, I suppose. We were in Outremer together\u2014met there for the first time, which is crazy, since our houses are only four miles apart. But he was fostered as a boy, away up country somewhere. I\u2019ve always assumed that\u2019s what made him turn out like he did.\n I gave him a sort of hopeless grin. Our kitchenmaid was still sitting up on the box, hoping for someone to help her down. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we won\u2019t need it, but\u2014\u201d\n A scorpion is a siege engine; a pretty small one, compared to the huge stone-throwing catapults and mangonels and trebuchets they pounded us with at Crac des Bests. It\u2019s essentially a big steel crossbow, with a frame, a heavy stand, and a super-efficient winch. One man with a long steel bar can wind it up, and it shoots a steel arrow long as your arm and thick as your thumb three hundred yards. We had them at Metouches. Fortunately, the other lot didn\u2019t.\n I told Marhouse about the dragon. He assumed I was trying to be funny. Then he caught sight of the trap, lying on the ground in front of the cider house, and he went very quiet.\n \u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d he said.\n I nodded. \u201cApparently it\u2019s burned some houses out at Merebarton.\u201d\n \u201cBurned.\u201d Never seen him look like that before.\n \u201cSo they reckon. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a drake.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t get around to finishing the sentence. No need.\n \u201cWhich is why,\u201d I said, trying to sound cheerful, \u201cI\u2019m so very glad your granddad had the foresight to buy a scorpion. No wonder he made a fortune in business. He obviously knew good stuff when he saw it.\u201d\n Took him a moment to figure that one out, by which time the moment had passed. \u201cThere\u2019s no arrows,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cNo arrows,\u201d he repeated, \u201cjust the machine. Well,\u201d he went on, \u201cit\u2019s not like we use the bloody thing, it\u2019s just for show.\u201d\n I opened and closed my mouth a couple of times. \u201cSurely there must\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOriginally, yes, I suppose so. I expect they got used for something around the place.\u201d He gave me a thin smile. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to store up old junk for two hundred years on the off chance in my family,\u201d he said.\n I was trying to remember what scorpion bolts look like. There\u2019s a sort of three-bladed flange down the butt end, to stabilize them in flight. \u201cNo matter,\u201d I said. \u201cBit of old rod\u2019ll have to do. I\u2019ll get Moddo to run me some up.\u201d I was looking at the machine. The lead screws and the keyways the slider ran in were caked up with stiff, solid bogeys of dried grease. \u201cDoes it work?\u201d\n \u201cI assume so. Or it did, last time it was used. We keep it covered with greased hides in the root store.\u201d\n I flicked a flake of rust off the frame. It looked sound enough, but what if the works had seized solid? \u201cGuess I\u2019d better get it down off the cart and we\u2019ll see,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, thanks again. I\u2019ll let you know how it turns out.\u201d\n Meaning: please go away now. But Marhouse just scowled at me. \u201cI\u2019m staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou honestly think I\u2019d trust you lot with a family heirloom?\u201d\n \u201cNo, really,\u201d I said, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to trouble. I know how to work these things, remember. Besides, they\u2019re pretty well indestructible.\u201d\n Wasting my breath. Marhouse is like a dog I used to have, couldn\u2019t bear to be left out of anything; if you went out for a shit in the middle of the night, she had to come too. Marhouse was the only one of us in Outremer who ever volunteered for anything. And never got picked, for that exact reason.\n So, through no choice or fault of my own, there were nine of us: me, Ebba, Marhouse, the six men from the farm. Of the six, Liutprand is seventeen and Rognvald is twenty-nine, though he barely counts, with his bad arm. The rest of us somewhere between fifty-two and sixty. Old men. We must be mad, I thought.\n We rode out there in the flat-bed cart, bumping and bouncing over the ruts in Watery Lane. Everybody was thinking the same thing, and nobody said a word: what if the bugger swoops down and crisps the lot of us while we\u2019re sat here in the cart? In addition, I was also thinking: Marhouse is his own fault, after all, he\u2019s a knight too, and he insisted on butting in. The rest of them, though\u2014my responsibility. Send for the knight, they\u2019d said, not the knight and half the damn village. But a knight in real terms isn\u2019t a single man, he\u2019s the nucleus of a unit, the heart of a society; the lance in war, the village in peace, he stands for them, in front of them when there\u2019s danger, behind them when times are hard, not so much an individual, more of a collective noun. That\u2019s understood, surely; so that, in all those old tales of gallantry and errantry, when the poet sings of the knight wandering in a dark wood and encountering the evil to be fought, the wrong to be put right, \u201cknight\u201d in that context is just shorthand for a knight and his squire and his armor-bearer and his three men-at-arms and the boy who leads the spare horses. The others aren\u2019t mentioned by name, they\u2019re subsumed in him, he gets the glory or the blame but everyone knows, if they stop to think about it, that the rest of them were there too; or who lugged around the spare lances, to replace the ones that got broken? And who got the poor bugger in and out of his full plate harness every morning and evening? There are some straps and buckles you just can\u2019t reach on your own, unless you happen to have three hands on the ends of unnaturally long arms. Without the people around me, I\u2019d be completely worthless. It\u2019s understood. Well, isn\u2019t it?\n We set the trap up on the top of a small rise, in the big meadow next to the old clay pit. Marhouse\u2019s suggestion, as a matter of fact; he reckoned that it was where the flightlines the thing had been following all crossed. Flightlines? Well yes, he said, and proceeded to plot all the recorded attacks on a series of straight lines, scratched in the dried splatter on the side of the cart with a stick. It looked pretty convincing to me. Actually, I hadn\u2019t really given it any thought, just assumed that if we dumped a bleeding carcass down on the ground, the dragon would smell it and come whooshing down. Stupid, when you come to think of it. And I call myself a huntsman.\n Moddo had fitted the trap with four good, thick chains, attached to eighteen-inch steel pegs, which we hammered into the ground. Again, Marhouse did the thinking. They needed to be offset (his word) so that if it pulled this way or that, there\u2019d be three chains offering maximum resistance\u2014well, it made sense when he said it. He\u2019s got that sort of brain, invents clever machines and devices for around the farm. Most of them don\u2019t work, but some of them do.\n The trap, of course, was Plan A. Plan B was the scorpion, set up seventy-five yards away under the busted chestnut tree, with all that gorse and briars for cover. The idea was, we had a direct line of sight, but if we missed and he came at us, he wouldn\u2019t dare swoop in too close, for fear of smashing his wings on the low branches. That bit was me.\n We propped the poor dead goat up on sticks so it wasn\u2019t actually pressing on the floorplate of the trap, then scampered back to where we\u2019d set up the scorpion. Luitprand got volunteered to drive the cart back to Castle Farm; he whined about being out in the open, but I chose him because he\u2019s the youngest and I wanted him well out of harm\u2019s way if the dragon actually did put in an appearance. Seventy-five yards was about as far as I trusted the scorpion to shoot straight without having to make allowance for elevation\u2014we didn\u2019t have time to zero it, obviously\u2014but it felt stupidly close. How long would it take the horrible thing to fly seventy-five yards? I had no idea, obviously. We spanned the scorpion\u2014reassuringly hard to do\u2014loaded Moddo\u2019s idea of a bolt into the slider groove, nestled down as far as we could get into the briars and nettles, and waited.\n No show. When it got too dark to see, Marhouse said, \u201cWhat kind of poison do you think it\u2019d take to kill something like that?\u201d\n I\u2019d been thinking about that. \u201cSomething we haven\u2019t got,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou reckon?\u201d\n \u201cOh come on,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t keep a wide selection of poisons in the house. For some reason.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s archer\u2019s root,\u201d Ebba said.\n \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Marhouse said. \u201cThat stuff\u2019ll kill just about anything.\u201d\n \u201cOf course it will,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut nobody around here\u2014\u201d\n \u201cMercel,\u201d Ebba said. \u201cHe\u2019s got some.\u201d\n News to me. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cMercel. Lidda\u2019s boy. He uses it to kill wild pigs.\u201d\n Does he now?, I thought. It had occurred to me that wild boar were getting a bit hard to find. I knew all about smearing a touch of archer\u2019s root on a bit of jagged wire nailed to a fencepost\u2014boar love to scratch, and it\u2019s true, they do a lot of damage to standing corn. That\u2019s why I pay compensation. Archer\u2019s root is illegal, of course, but so are a lot of useful everyday commodities.\n \u201cI\u2019d better ask him,\u201d Ebba said. \u201cHe won\u2019t want to get in any trouble.\u201d\n Decided unanimously, apparently. Well, we weren\u2019t doing any good crouching in the bushes. It did cross my mind that if the dragon hadn\u2019t noticed a dead goat with a trap under it, there was no guarantee it\u2019d notice the same dead goat stuffed full of archer\u2019s root, but I dismissed the idea as unconstructive.\n We left the trap and the scorpion set up, just in case, and rode in the cart back to Castle Farm. To begin with, as we came over the top of the Hog\u2019s Back down Castle Lane, I assumed the pretty red glow on the skyline was the last blush of the setting sun. As we got closer, I hoped that was what it was. By the time we passed the quince orchard, however, the hypothesis was no longer tenable.\n We found Luitprand in the goose pond. Stupid fool, he\u2019d jumped in the water to keep from getting burned up. Of course, the mud\u2019s three feet deep on the bottom. I could have told him that.\n In passing: I think Luitprand was my son. At any rate, I knew his mother rather too well, seventeen years ago. Couldn\u2019t ever say anything, naturally. But he reminded me a lot of myself. For a start, he was half-smart stupid, just like me. Hurling myself in the pond to avoid the flames was just the sort of thing I might have done at his age; and, goes without saying, he wasn\u2019t there when we dug the bloody pond, twenty-one years ago, so how could he have known we\u2019d chosen the soft spot, no use for anything else?\n No other casualties, thank God, but the hay barn, the straw rick, the woodpile, all gone. The thatch, miraculously, burned itself out without taking the rafters with it. But losing that much hay meant we\u2019d be killing a lot of perfectly good stock come winter, since I can\u2019t afford to buy in. One damn thing after another.\n Opito, Larcan\u2019s wife, was hysterical, even though her home hadn\u2019t gone up in flames after all. Larcan said it was a great big lizard, about twenty feet long. He got one very brief glimpse of it out of the corner of his eye, just before he dragged his wife and son under the cart. He looked at me like it was all my fault. Just what I needed after a long day crouched in a briar patch.\n Luitprand played the flute; not very well. I gave him the one I brought back from Outremer. I never did find it among his stuff, so I can only assume he sold it at some point.\n Anyway, that was that, as far as I was concerned. Whatever it was, wherever it had come from, it would have to be dealt with, as soon as possible. On the ride back from the farm, Marhouse had been banging on about flightlines again, where we were going to move the bait to; two days here, while the wind\u2019s in the south, then if that\u2019s no good, then another two days over there, and if that still doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll know for sure it must be following the line of the river, so either here, there, or just possibly everywhere, would be bound to do the trick, logically speaking. I smiled and nodded. I\u2019m sure he was perfectly correct. He\u2019s a good huntsman, Marhouse. Come the end of the season, he always knows exactly where all the game we\u2019ve failed to find must be holed up. Next year, he then says\u2014\n Trouble was, there wasn\u2019t time for a next year.\n By midnight (couldn\u2019t sleep, oddly enough) I was fairly sure how it had to be done.\n Before you start grinning to yourself at my presumption, I had no logical explanation for my conclusions. Flightlines, patterns of behavior, life cycles, cover crops, mating seasons, wind directions; put them together and you\u2019ll inevitably flush out the truth, which will then elude you, zig-zag running through the roots of the long variables. I knew.\n I knew, because I used to hunt with my father. He was, of course, always in charge of everything, knew everything, excelled at everything. We never caught much. And I knew, when he\u2019d drawn up the lines of beaters, given them their timings (say three Glorious Sun Ascendants and two Minor Catechisms, then come out making as much noise as you can), positioned the stillhunters and the hounds and the horsemen, finally blown the horn; I knew exactly where the wretched animal would come bursting out, so as to elude us all with the maximum of safety and the minimum of effort. Pure intuition, never failed. Naturally, I never said anything. Not my place to.\n So: I knew what was going to happen, and that there was nothing much I could do about it, and my chances of success and survival were\u2014well, not to worry about that. When I was in Outremer, I got shot in the face with an arrow. Should\u2019ve killed me instantly; but by some miracle it hung up in my cheekbone, and an enemy doctor we\u2019d captured the day before yanked it out with a pair of tongs. You should be dead, they said to me, like I\u2019d deliberately cheated. No moral fiber. Ever since then\u2014true, I shuddered to think how the estate would get on with my brother in charge, but it survived my father and grandfather, so it was clearly indestructible. Besides, everyone dies sooner or later. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m important.\n Marhouse insisted on coming with us. I told him, you stay here, we\u2019ll need a wise, experienced hand to take charge if it decides to burn out the castle. For a moment I thought he\u2019d fallen for it, but no such luck.\n So there were three of us: me, Ebba, Marhouse. The idea was, we\u2019d follow the Ridgeway on horseback, looking down on either side. As soon as we saw smoke, Ebba would ride back to the castle and get the gear, meet us at the next likely attack scene. I know; bloody stupid idea. But I knew it wouldn\u2019t happen like that, because I knew how it\u2019d happen.\n Marhouse had on his black-and-white\u2014that\u2019s breastplate, pauldrons, rerebraces, and tassets. I told him, you\u2019ll boil to death in that lot. He scowled at me. He\u2019d also fetched along a full-weight lance, issue. You won\u2019t need that, I told him. I\u2019d got a boar-spear, and Ebba was carrying the steel crossbow my father spent a whole year\u2019s apple money on, the year before he died. \u201cBut they\u2019re just to make us feel better,\u201d I said. That got me another scowl. The wrong attitude.\n Noon; nothing to be seen anywhere. I was just daring to think, perhaps the bloody thing\u2019s moved on, or maybe it\u2019d caught some disease or got itself hung up in a tree. Then I saw a crow.\n I think Ebba saw it first, but he didn\u2019t point and say, \u201cLook, there\u2019s a crow.\u201d Marhouse was explaining some fine point of decoying, how you go about establishing which tree is the principal turning point on an elliptical recursive flight pattern. I thought: that\u2019s not a crow, it\u2019s just hanging there. Must be a hawk.\n Ebba was looking over his shoulder. No, not a hawk, the profile\u2019s wrong. Marhouse stopped talking, looked at me, said, \u201cWhat are you two staring at?\u201d I was thinking, Oh.\n I\u2019m right about things so rarely that I usually relish the experience. Not this time.\n Oh, you may be thinking, is a funny way of putting it. But that was the full extent of it: no elation, no regret, not even resignation; to my great surprise, no real fear. Just: oh, as in, well, here we are, then. Call it a total inability to feel anything. Twice in Outremer, once when my father died, and now. I\u2019d far rather have wet myself, but you can\u2019t decide these things for yourself. Oh, I thought, and that was all.\n Marhouse was swearing, which isn\u2019t like him. He only swears when he\u2019s terrified, or when something\u2019s got stuck or broken. Bad language, he reckons, lubricates the brain, stops it seizing up with fear or anger. Ebba had gone white as milk. His horse was playing up, and he was having to work hard to keep it from bolting. Amazing how they know.\n On top of the Ridgeway, of course, there\u2019s no cover. We could gallop forward, or turn around and gallop back; either case, at the rate the bloody thing was moving, it\u2019d be on us long before we could get our heads down. I heard someone give the order to dismount. Wasn\u2019t Marhouse, because he stayed mounted. Wouldn\u2019t have been Ebba, so I guess it must\u2019ve been me.\n First time, it swooped down low over our heads\u2014about as high up as the spire of Blue Temple\u2014and just kept on going. We were frozen solid. We watched. It was on the glide, like a pigeon approaching a laid patch in a barley field, deciding whether to pitch or go on. Very slight tailwind, so if it wanted to come in on us, it\u2019d have to bank, turn up into the wind a little bit to start to stall, then wheel and come in with its wings back. I honestly thought: it\u2019s gone too far, it\u2019s not going to come in. Then it lifted, and I knew.\n Sounds odd, but I hadn\u2019t really been looking at it the first time, when it buzzed us. I saw a black bird shape, long neck like a heron, long tail like a pheasant, but no sense of scale. As it came in the second time, I couldn\u2019t help but stare; a real dragon, for crying out loud, something to tell your grandchildren about. Well, maybe.\n I\u2019d say the body was about horse-sized, head not in proportion; smaller, like a red deer stag. Wings absurdly large\u2014featherless, like a bat, skin stretched on disturbingly extended fingers. Tail, maybe half as long again as the body; neck like a swan, if that makes any sense. Sort of a gray color, but it looked green at a distance. Big hind legs, small front legs looking vaguely ridiculous, as if it had stolen them off a squirrel. A much rounder snout than I\u2019d expected, almost chubby. It didn\u2019t look all that dangerous, to be honest.\n Marhouse is one of those people who translate fear into action; the scareder he is, the braver. Works against people. No warning\u2014it\u2019d have been nice if he\u2019d said something first; he kicked his horse hard enough to stove in a rib, lance in rest, seat and posture straight out of the coaching manual. Rode straight at it.\n What happened then\u2014\n Marhouse was five yards away from it, going full tilt. The dragon probably couldn\u2019t have slowed down if it had wanted to. Instead\u2014it actually made this sort of \u201cpop\u201d noise as it opened its mouth and burped up a fat round ball of fire, then lifted just a little, to sail about five feet over Marhouse\u2019s head. He, meanwhile, rode straight into the fireball, and through it.\n And stopped, and fell all to pieces; the reason being, there was nothing left. Horse, man, all gone, not even ash, and the dozen or so pieces of armor dropping glowing to the ground, cherry-red, like they\u2019d just come off the forge. I\u2019ve seen worse things, in Outremer, but nothing stranger.\n I was gawping, forgotten all about the dragon. It was Ebba who shoved me down as it came back. I have no idea why it didn\u2019t just melt us both as it passed, unless maybe it was all out of puff and needed to recharge. Anyway, it soared away, repeated the little lift. I had a feeling it was enjoying itself. Well, indeed. It must be wonderful to be able to fly.\n Ebba was shouting at me, waving something, the crossbow, he wanted me to take it from him. \u201cShoot it,\u201d he was yelling. Made no sense to me; but then again, why not? I took the bow, planted my feet a shoulders\u2019 width apart, left elbow tucked in tight to the chest to brace the bow, just the fingers on the trigger. A good archery stance didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with the matter in hand\u2014like playing bowls in the middle of an earthquake\u2014but I\u2019m a good archer, so I couldn\u2019t help doing it properly. I found the dragon in the middle of the peep-sight, drew the tip of the arrow up to find it, and pressed the trigger.\n For the record, I hit the damn thing. The bolt went in four inches, just above the heart. Good shot. With a bow five times as strong, quite possibly a clean kill.\n I think it must\u2019ve hurt, though, because instead of flaming and lifting, it squirmed\u2014hunched its back then stretched out full-length like a dog waking up\u2014and kept coming, straight at me. I think I actually did try and jump out of the way; just rather too late. I think what hit me must\u2019ve been the side of its head.\n I had three ribs stoved in once in Outremer, so I knew what was going on. I recognized the sound, and the particular sort of pain, and the not quite being able to breathe. Mostly I remember thinking: it won\u2019t hurt, because any moment now I\u2019ll be dead. Bizarrely reassuring, as if I was cheating, getting away with it. Cheating twice; once by staying alive, once by dying. This man is morally bankrupt.\n I was on my back, not able or minded to move. I couldn\u2019t see the dragon. I could hear Ebba shouting; shut up, you old fool, I thought, I\u2019m really not interested. But he was shouting, \u201cHold on, mate, hold on, I\u2019m coming,\u201d which made absolutely no sense at all\u2014\n Then he shut up, and I lay there waiting. I waited, and waited. I\u2019m not a patient man. I waited so long, those crunched ribs started to hurt, or at least I became aware of the pain. For crying out loud, I thought. And waited.\n And thought: now just a minute.\n It hurt so much, hauling myself onto my side so I could see. I was in tears.\n Later, I figured out what had happened. When Ebba saw me go down, he grabbed the boar-spear and ran towards me. I don\u2019t imagine he considered the dragon, except as an inconvenience. Hold on, I\u2019m coming; all his thoughts in his words. He got about half way when the dragon pitched\u2014it must\u2019ve swooped off and come in again. As it put its feet down to land, he must\u2019ve stuck the butt of the spear in the ground and presented the point, like you do with a boar, to let it stick itself, its momentum being far more effective than your own puny strength. As it pitched, it lashed with its tail, sent Ebba flying. Whether or not it realized it was dead, the spear a foot deep in its windpipe before the shaft gave way under the pressure and snapped, I neither know nor care. By the marks on the ground, it rolled three or four times before the lights went out. My best estimate is, it weighed just short of a ton. Ebba\u2014under it as it rolled\u2014was crushed like a grape, so that his guts burst and his eyes popped, and nearly all his bones were broken.\n He wouldn\u2019t have thought: I\u2019ll kill the dragon. He\u2019d have thought, ground the spear, like boar-hunting, and then the tail hit him, and then the weight squashed him. So it wouldn\u2019t have been much; not a heroic thought, not the stuff of song and story. Just: this is a bit like boar-hunting, so ground the spear. And then, perhaps: oh.\n I think that\u2019s all there is; anywhere, anytime, in the whole world.\n I tried preserving the head in honey. We got an old pottery bath and filled it and put the head in; but eight weeks later it had turned green and it stank like hell, and she said, for pity\u2019s sake get rid of it. So we boiled it out and scraped it, and mounted the skull on the wall. Not much bigger than a big deer; in a hundred years\u2019 time, they won\u2019t believe the old story about it being a dragon. No such thing as dragons, they\u2019ll say.\n Meanwhile, for now, I\u2019m the Dragonslayer; which is a joke. The duke himself threatened to ride over and take a look at the remains, but affairs of state supervened, thank God. Entertaining the duke and his court would\u2019ve ruined us, and we\u2019d lost so much already.\n Twice I\u2019ve cheated. Marhouse was straight as a die, and his end, I\u2019m sorry, was just ludicrous. I keep telling myself, Ebba made a choice, you must respect that. I can\u2019t. Instead of a friend, I have a horrible memory, and yet another debt I can\u2019t pay. People assume you want to be saved, no matter what the cost; sometimes, though, it\u2019s just too expensive to stay alive. Not sure I\u2019ll ever forgive him for that.\n And that\u2019s that.

Inlesh repeated the name dutifully to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s Ontok.\u201d A pentagon of bright sparks halfway up the sky. \u201cThey\u2019ve each got their own names, but you don\u2019t need that for now. That\u2019s Hiea.\u201d A sullen orange glow in an otherwise unbroken patch of dark. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it at twilight or dawn, so don\u2019t rely on it for then, but it\u2019s about the only star that ever shows in that direction, so it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d\nInlesh nodded. \u201cI heard,\u201d he said, and stopped, because it sounded stupid, and then tried again, because he was supposed to ask questions in order to seem clever. \u201cIs it true there are people there?\u201d\nThe captain scratched at her jawline. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cnot at Hiea, likely. Used to be, they say. My grandfather was just a boy when it blazed up. Shone like the sun for a while, he told me, you could see it daytimes, and then burned down to what it is now. The maps show it looking a lot like Ifenwa before that.\u201d\n\u201cThere are maps?\u201d Inlesh asked. This was a startling concept. \u201cStar maps?\u201d\n\u201cFor records,\u201d the captain cautioned. \u201cNot for using. They\u2019re not reliable. Stars shift, you know. That one there.\u201d She pointed at a long silvery line, almost too thin to see, that split off at one end into a dozen tiny branches. \u201cOmond Halaw. It moves a little bit every year, always down. Coming toward us, as it happens. If that star has people, they\u2019ll get here in, oh, ten thousand years, something like that. Someone told me the exact number once, but I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d\nInlesh repeated \u201cten thousand years\u201d silently, along with the name. In the days since leaving their home port of Gwylleridge, the captain had told him quite a lot of things on which he had no idea whether he\u2019d be tested or not, and quite a lot more things that he was fairly sure would never come up again, and a fair few things he was almost certain weren\u2019t true, but the last thing he wanted was to be caught out.\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t trust sky maps for navigation, not by themselves,\u201d the captain continued. \u201cShore maps can be good for a generation, and sea charts are good enough if you get them updated every year, but stars can change between one night and the next. And there\u2019s no pattern to it; they can change by a lot, or by a little, which is worse. Memorize them, use them, but don\u2019t rely on them unless you\u2019ve got no choice.\u201d\nQuestions, Inlesh thought, ask questions. He shuffled hurriedly through the bits of folk wisdom and tall tale and family history that had been most of his education. There hadn\u2019t been much about stars, but after a moment he dredged up something his aunt Alchayr had said once. \u201cIs it true that the sun is a kind of star?\u201d\nThe captain gave him a disgusted look. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\nThey made port at Roal Hadda, a city on the curve of Haddachirn Bay, all glaring white stone and little shaded plazas and the famous temple dominating the landscape from the top of its high hill. It was the farthest from home Inlesh had ever been, and as soon as he could he fled the docks and the company of Aranthaw\u2019s sailors, to wander alone through the twisting streets, marveling at the glorious strangeness of a place that wasn\u2019t his own.\nAt length he found himself on a climbing road, and around a curve the temple loomed up before him. He made the pilgrim\u2019s donation with the small advance on his wages the captain had doled out to the shore parties, and entered the great rotunda, to gaze openmouthed at the sleek lizard-headed statues and the mosaics that shone mysteriously with soft light.\n\u201cDo you wish a guide, young sir?\u201d A priest appeared at his elbow, soft-slippered on the ancient floor. \u201cAre you perhaps interested in learning more of God?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just\u2014\u201d Words failed Inlesh, as embarrassment often made them do. He had only come in to look, but it suddenly seemed terribly rude to say so.\n\u201cPerhaps you would like to hear one of the Lessons,\u201d the priest offered. \u201cYou may ponder them at your leisure, young sir, being, as I think you are, a sailor, with ample time to study the sky upon which God writes His missives.\u201d\n\u201cThe sky?\u201d Inlesh repeated, still trying to think of a way out of the conversation.\nThe priest gave a bobbing nod. \u201cAs the sky changes, young sir, so are the Lessons revealed. But, of course, it changes in God\u2019s time, not ours, and so we must watch for many generations to follow a single tale. Come, come outside, the sun\u2019s nearly covered.\u201d\nIt was indeed almost full dark. Down below in the city there were lights, torches, and electric bulbs and by the harbor the occasional more exotic speck of illumination, but all that ceased at the foot of the temple hill, so that they had nearly as fine a view of the sky from the front portico as Inlesh had ever seen at sea.\nThe priest gestured grandly at the glowing smudge the captain had named Ifenwa. \u201cThat is the Lesson of the Cloud,\u201d he intoned. \u201cFor thirty generations it has kept its shape, growing steadily but so slowly that no one in his lifetime may notice the change. So are we enjoined to propagate the faith, not by dispersing our people throughout the world as some foreigners do, but by steady advancement among those nearest? As the Cloud grows, so do we, and so long as it continues to grow, we know that God is pleased with our increase.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that\u2019s what it means?\u201d Inlesh asked. Ifenwa didn\u2019t look that much like a cloud, even, other than being vaguely round and in the sky.\n\u201cWe must interpret God\u2019s Lessons with our own limited understanding,\u201d the priest said. \u201cTherein lies the difficulty, and the need for contemplation and the slow acquisition of wisdom. Of course there are differences of interpretation, but\u2014see there?\u201d He indicated the thin branching lines of Omond Halaw. \u201cConsider the Lesson of the River. It splits and changes, but remains one River, and the streams and tributaries of error eventually fade away, leaving only the main current of truth.\u201d\n\u201cDo you make maps?\u201d Inlesh asked. \u201cTo remember what the\u2014what the Lessons said in the past?\u201d\nThe priest nodded, a pleased expression on his face. \u201cWe do, young sir. They are, of course, for the priesthood only, but if you were to seek initiation\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have to get back to my ship,\u201d Inlesh said hurriedly.\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d the priest said, not seeming at all dismayed. \u201cConsider the sky as you travel, and if it brings you to feel God\u2019s call to it, return to us. We will be here always.\u201d\nAlways seemed like a very long time, and Inlesh, back at sea and on the late watch alone, regretfully concluded that people who casually threw around words like \u201calways\u201d probably weren\u2019t to be relied on.\nBut he started drawing his own map that night, carefully marking out the fixed positions of the stars and their curious shapes with a charcoal stick on a piece of sailcloth, and beside them writing both the names the captain had had him memorize and the names the priest had given: Cloud, River, Ember, Wing.\nThere was more to the world than anyone at home knew, as Inlesh fervently believed: it was what had impelled him to leave Gwylleridge, to beg position on Aranthaw and seek a wider life. Now, having begun (he thought) to grow used to the great sea, he transferred his longing to the sky.\nAt Shemcorizan Island they took on fresh water and laying hens and innumerable barrels of pickles, in preparation for the long stretch of empty water they would have to cover before reaching the next scheduled port. The great sea, the captain said, in that tone that meant Inlesh had better be learning, was one hundred ninety-seven thousand six hundred twenty kilometers from one end to the other, and its shores bore stretches of jungle for a year\u2019s journey on foot, and sheer cliffs one might sail past for twenty days without finding a good harbor, and cities of machines and cities of stone and cities of clockwork and cities in ruin. There was a sailing ship of legend, Taramura, that had circumnavigated the great sea and taken fifty years to do it, though almost none of her original crew were left when she returned, save the pilot and the assistant cook, and a pair of the ship\u2019s ancient fighting-beetles. Of course, the airships of some of the machine peoples could make the journey in days, but where was the glory in that?\nAranthaw\u2019s itinerary was much more modest, a circle from Haddachirn Bay out through the Misleading Islands and the Sardees, and then back inshore to strike land near Quern Head, and a stop at Treynou Bay, and home again. It took her a hundred days to ply the route, which she had done for longer than Inlesh had been alive. Some of Aranthaw\u2019s people, the captain among them, had made scores of circuits; others were temporary hires who would move on when mood or chance took them. Inlesh listened wide-eyed to all their tales, even knowing they couldn\u2019t all be true.\n\u201cAh, but how can anyone know for sure?\u201d the second helmsman, a burly one-eared man who answered to Teeth, asked jovially in response to a chorus of skepticism at the end of one of his stories. \u201cThe world is vast beyond all belief. There\u2019s room for all manner of wonders. I saw a map in Atalmar once, the size of this ship, on which even the great sea itself was so small as to be almost invisible.\u201d\n\u201cMaraut are liars,\u201d the first helmsman snorted. \u201cOne of them told me once that they have jewels inside their skulls that make them live forever. And where would someone stand to draw a map like that, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cOn the sun,\u201d one of the other sailors offered.\n\u201cOn the night-shell!\u201d Inlesh put in, eager to contribute.\n\u201cOn your arse, more like!\u201d said the first helmsman, to general laughter. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nMaps could be had in plenty in the markets of Shemcorizan, though none at such a scale, for the island was one of the main starting points for voyages amid the archipelago that stretched far out into this part of the great sea. Inlesh spent hours gaping at the goods from distant places laid out for sale, exotic foods and strange machinery and all manner of marvelous things. He was entranced by a mechanical bird that reproduced with perfect accuracy anything said to it, but fortunately its price was close to a year\u2019s wages for a sailor, so that he couldn\u2019t be tempted. The next stall over was selling books in a hundred languages; the merchant admitted xie couldn\u2019t read any of them, but was nonetheless firm in xer conviction that they held the secrets of creation. One stall further on, massive white-furred cats lounged in cages, displaying startling fangs to passersby when they yawned. Inlesh shuddered at the thought of transporting those as cargo.\n\u201cOh, we don\u2019t carry them on ships, good fellow!\u201d their keeper said with a startled laugh when Inlesh inquired. \u201cNo, no, certainly not. There\u2019s an outpost of the Donn Enshau at the edge of the jungle where they live, and we pay a goodly amount\u2014an exorbitant amount, let me tell you\u2014for the use of their teleport. Ah, it\u2019s a grand thing. I\u2019ll be reborn as a Donn Enshai in the life after next, let me tell you.\u201d\nThere was quite a lot in that statement that Inlesh needed explained, and he wouldn\u2019t have bothered trying to unravel it had not the keeper casually mentioned that of course it wasn\u2019t his next life he was talking about, as that one would take place in one of the stars.\n\u201cWell, naturally,\u201d he said when Inlesh pressed him about that. \u201cThe stars are full of people, you know. The world is a great sphere, and the stars are on the other side of it. Wherever you die, your soul goes in a straight line through the sun, and you\u2019re reborn at the point precisely opposite. One pays a geometer quite a fortune to calculate the opportune place to die, to be reborn in the best star.\u201d He himself had done so, he continued, though he regretted he couldn\u2019t point out his chosen star, it being early morning at the moment, the night-shell slowly opening its petals from around the sun.\nThat the stars might be cities, or nations, was a vertiginous thought, but one that it turned out many of the local people held as truth. Many were willing to expound at length on the glories of the star they had selected as their place of rebirth, though the one most often mentioned, Inentou-daralees, would not be visible at night from here, being, of course, directly overhead and therefore hidden by the night-shell. Nonetheless Inentou marked it carefully on the blank space in the center of his map, writing Inentou-daralees and beside it, city?\nOut into the open sea Aranthaw went, and every island and strait and stretch of open water was a wonder of a different kind. There were clouds of leaping fish that darkened the sky, and tiny jeweled lizards that swarmed aboard ship from a red sand beach and fought fiercely with the rats in the bilge in titanic contests on which the sailors wagered. They met folk who lived their whole lives on great rafts without ever going ashore, whose singing could be heard for kilometers. They saw a fleet of airships like vast golden balls pass overhead on their way to one of the machine civilizations. Once, late at night, an explosion lit the darkness, and streaks arrowed downwards into the sea; all lamps were lit and the watch ordered to the rails in case anyone was in the water, but no trace of whatever had fallen was found.\nInlesh\u2019s map grew, the star-names multiplying until some stars were fully surrounded by a thicket of letters. In a marketplace in the Sardees he found a kind of fine black paper that held the most precise markings when pressed with a particular kind of needle-thin stylus. It came, the merchant said, from Ontok-Belah, from a ship of strangers who had long ago visited from that star, the statement gave Inlesh a peculiar thrill even though he was fairly sure the merchant lied. He bought it, and endured the jeers of those sailors who\u2019d spent their money more sensibly on exotic intoxicants, and during one of the calm watches he copied his cloth map onto this new medium.\nAs he did so, a skitter-craft ran along the top of the water, spindly legs churning, and was as quickly out of sight. Inlesh wondered how long it would take to reach the end of the great sea, and how long, if it kept going, until it made it to the other side of the world.\nFifteen days\u2019 tacking across open sea with no land visible brought them around on the homeward leg of their journey, and at the sixteenth dawn as the segments of the night-shell folded back from the sun, they sighted Quern Head with its jade green tower.\n\u201cWe should have come in at night,\u201d the captain commented to Inlesh reflectively. They stood at the helm, where Inlesh was being allowed, with supervision, to steer. \u201cThat tower glows like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\u201cWho built it?\u201d Inlesh asked.\nThe captain shrugged. \u201cMachine people. Real ones, actually\u2014people that are made out of metal. Don\u2019t look at me like that, it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cBoy should ask them about his star maps,\u201d Teeth commented. He\u2019d been hovering nearby throughout the watch, ready to seize back the helm should Inlesh make a mistake, though in open water with a steady light breeze on the aft quarter there was little he could have done to cause catastrophe.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t talk to outsiders,\u201d the captain said. \u201cThe tower\u2019s a border marker as well as a lighthouse. We go the other way along the coast here; they don\u2019t like us in their waters.\u201d\nInlesh didn\u2019t protest, though he would indeed have dearly liked to hear what metal people had to say about the stars. Could they see them better? Did they live long enough to watch them change?\nThat the stars might be distant cities was an idea that came up over and over. He had a score of names for some, and tales to go with them, of visitors who arrived in strange ships or appeared out of air or cloud, naming Ifenwa (Igressel, Fennow, Axal-bright) or Tiersu (Jendirra, Wing, Morhallis) as their home. Whether they were people, or people reborn, or holy judges, or machines, or creatures without souls, seemed to be a question with no solid answer, though it was guaranteed to spark drunken arguments in any dockside bar among people who had never before given it ten minutes\u2019 consideration altogether.\nThere was no proper town at Quern Head, but the fisherfolk who lived in the straggle of huts along the shore looked forward to Aranthaw\u2019s seasonal arrival, and brought out copious amounts of this year\u2019s fresh fruit in baskets and last year\u2019s fermented fruit in barrels, and lit great driftwood bonfires on the beach. There was music for dancing, and as night closed in around them, Aranthaw\u2019s lanterns sparkled on the black water like stars.\nInlesh, restless, wandered away from the festivities and up the winding path to the cliff-top. He came near the base of the green tower, whose glow was more like a mat of luminescent algae than like fire. There was an answering light of the same shade in the distance, from over a fold in the gently rolling landscape: the machine people\u2019s city, he supposed. It nearly washed out the sullen orange spark of Hiea, alone in its dark patch of sky. He wondered if people there were looking down on this place, whatever its name might be. They\u2019d never know there was someone looking back. It seemed so unutterably sad.\n\u201cUseless,\u201d he muttered, amused at himself. This was what came of drinking alone, this sort of maudlin rambling. Better to go back to the fires, and the camaraderie of the crew.\n\u201cIt was a waste,\u201d someone said nearby, as though agreeing.\nInlesh spun, startled, and stumbled on the uneven ground, his shore legs betraying him. The person next to him caught his arm, holding him up with easy strength. They were short and broad and hairless, with eyes a solid green like the beacon tower, and skin like polished brass. Inlesh gaped. Don\u2019t be rude, an inner voice that sounded like his aunt Alchayr scolded. \u201cAh\u2014thank you,\u201d he managed.\n\u201cI come out sometimes to look at it too,\u201d they said with a shrug, giving his arm an absent pat and letting him go. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone there, not really, but we all remember how easily it fell. It could have been stopped, if people had just been a little more careful.\u201d They tilted their head quizzically. \u201cYou\u2019re from down there, aren\u2019t you? The sailing ship?\u201d\n\u201cAranthaw,\u201d Inlesh said. \u201cYes. And you\u2019re from\u2014here?\u201d He waved at the tower.\n\u201cHssni,\u201d they agreed, or at least he assumed it was agreement. \u201cI\u2019d be working, but it\u2019s a holiday while you\u2019re here, so that we don\u2019t scare you off.\u201d They laughed. Their tongue and teeth were a darker shade of brass, their smile infectious, so that Inlesh found himself grinning too. \u201cI don\u2019t see that it matters, myself. You see enough strange things at sea, you\u2019re not going to be scared away by a few flares from the tower. The locals have gotten used to them, after all.\u201d\n\u201cCan people see your city from up there?\u201d Inlesh asked, the drink and the weirdness of the night making him bold.\n\u201cFrom Hia\u2019a? There\u2019s no one left there to see. From elsewhere? With telescopes, probably, or when we signal.\u201d They followed Inlesh\u2019s gaze toward the glow of the city. \u201cThe greenhouses look bright from here, I know, but you\u2019ve got to understand the distances involved. The places we can actually see are huge; Ifena\u2019a is almost three lightseconds across. That\u2019s more than a ship like yours could travel in\u2014\u201d They thought about it. \u201cActually, I have no idea. It\u2019s huge, though. Imagine the sea, all lit up. They\u2019d see that from Ifena\u2019a, but as a spark.\u201d\n\u201cThe sea,\u201d Inlesh repeated. \u201cThe whole sea?\u201d It was a dizzying idea. He thought of the reflections of Aranthaw\u2019s lanterns, of the glowing mats of algae or the blue night-blooming flowers he\u2019d seen floating on the water, and tried to picture that light extended as far as they\u2019d sailed, farther, as far as Taramura had gone, touching every port and every shore. The image was beautiful and terrifying in equal measure. And the people in the stars, looking down\u2014\nThey nodded. \u201cEven when we get the transit system running again, it\u2019ll take hours to get from one side of Ifena\u2019a to the other. And years to get there in the first place.\u201d\nThis was more than Inlesh could take in. The person seemed to sense his confusion. \u201cCome on,\u201d they said kindly. \u201cLet me take you back down to your ship.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Inlesh said, shaking off their hand. \u201cNo, I\u2019m all right. I want to know. I want to see. We don\u2019t know anything, and we keep arguing about it, and you know all about the stars and we don\u2019t ask\u2014\u201d Words failed him, and their uselessness was almost a physical pain. If he could just explain how much it mattered to him\u2014\n\u201cThere are rules,\u201d the person said, a little sadly. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to disturb you. I think it\u2019s stupid too. We could have prevented Hia\u2019a, if we\u2019d been a little more willing to get involved.\u201d They took a deep breath, with a slight hissing sound, and seemed to come to a decision. \u201cAll right. But you can\u2019t go around just telling people. They probably won\u2019t believe you, but promise anyway, all right?\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Inlesh said immediately. He\u2019d have promised anything, at that point.\nIt was hard to read expression in the jade green eyes, but he thought the person looked relieved. \u201cAll right. Stars, then. The civilizations on the far side of the world, those aren\u2019t stars. The sun is a star.\u201d\n\u201cMy aunt told me that!\u201d Inlesh exclaimed. \u201cThe captain said it was stupid.\u201d\n\u201cSome people remember,\u201d the person said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t remember properly. It\u2019s been sixty generations for your kind since you came inside, and in all that time the sun is the only star you\u2019ve seen, so how could you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Inlesh admitted.\n\u201cI know,\u201d they said. \u201cI\u2019m going to show you.\u201d\nThe two of them walked across the ridge, down toward the glowing valley. The greenhouses were rows of crystal domes, shining with soft light. \u201cWe grow our fuels here,\u201d the person said, \u201cand some organic components of our bodies, and some food the locals can eat, so that we can trade it to them when there\u2019s a drought. We make sure it\u2019s not delicious, so that they don\u2019t get dependent on us, but our rules at least don\u2019t require us to watch them starve.\u201d Their mouth twisted. \u201cThat was a result of Hia\u2019a too.\u201d Inlesh opened his mouth to ask, but was forestalled by the machine person coming to a sudden halt before what looked like a toolshed. \u201cHere we are.\u201d They slid the door open and pulled out a shining coverall with a helmet attached. \u201cThis is protective clothing. We won\u2019t go far enough that you\u2019ll actually need protection, but it\u2019ll disguise you.\u201d\nInlesh struggled into the clothing, which stretched to accommodate him, albeit barely; apparently machine people tended to be short. The person sealed the helmet and did something that tinted the world with a grayish haze. \u201cNo one can see you,\u201d they assured him. \u201cBreathe normally, it\u2019s fine.\u201d They patted his arm. \u201cReally, it\u2019s fine. Breathe. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nPast the last of the identical greenhouses was a gentle slope, and then a further valley, silent and dark, full of unmoving machines. He recognized some of them for their function, if not their form: pumps labored to pull the water out of the dark valley, sending it down a long channel over the ridge. Digging machines bulked silent, equipped with great shovels and scoops, and at the center of the frozen tableau was a great excavated pit, stair-stepping down to some unguessable depth.\n\u201cYou\u2019re mining something?\u201d Inlesh guessed. \u201cThis is what you wanted me to see? Why?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old transport system,\u201d the person explained. \u201cWe knew there had to be one. We\u2019ve spent centuries trying to find it. This is an exit port. Come on.\u201d\nNot understanding, Inlesh followed. The pair picked their way to the pit and settled themselves in a kind of soft-sided box perched on its edge. \u201cNow don\u2019t be afraid,\u201d his guide said again, and then the box tipped forward and fell.\nInlesh didn\u2019t scream; he might have been proud of that, but the truth was he was simply frozen, stiff with terror, his throat and lungs as much as the rest. The box seemed to be tumbling end over end, and yet somehow his body remained seated on its floor, and the person beside him seemed unperturbed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re passing through the gravity gradient,\u201d they said, and patted his arm as they seemed to have a habit of doing. The words were meaningless to Inlesh, but somehow the fact that the dizzying not-tumble had a name was a little reassuring, so that he was able to take a breath, and another.\nThe walls of the box were a dimly glowing pink, like coral lit from below, and shadows seemed to move outside them. \u201cThis is the thinnest part of the hull,\u201d the person said, and Inlesh realized with incongruous embarrassment that he\u2019d never asked their name, and it was too far along in their conversation to politely ask now. \u201cIt takes a little while, even so. We\u2019ll be outside\u2014ah, there we are.\u201d Nothing had discernibly changed to Inlesh\u2019s eyes, and the falling, tumbling sensation continued, though he was still on the floor. \u201cNow, this may be a bit startling, all right? Try to relax.\u201d\nThe walls began to darken, and to change, and after a moment Inlesh realized they were growing transparent, and that it was dark outside. Instead of the sheer sides of some unfathomably deep pit, as he had half expected, there was a flat dark plain lit by occasional nearby spotlights, which cast sharp-edged shadows from the shapes of unmoving machines. And overhead\u2014the box\u2019s ceiling had gone invisible too\u2014there were lights. Not the variously shaped stars he was familiar with, the cloud of Ifenwa and the river of Omond Halaw and the rest, but harsh points that burned with a steady light, some stronger or fainter, some more red or more blue, but all clearer than anything he had ever seen.\n\u201cThose are the stars,\u201d the person said. \u201cThe real ones. Like the sun.\u201d\n\u201cAre there\u2014\u201d Inlesh didn\u2019t know how to ask the question, realizing dimly that anything he asked would reveal how little he understood. \u201cAre there people there?\u201d he managed plaintively.\n\u201cOh, yes. Well, not on the stars. Circling them. On planets, or swarm habitats, or rings\u2014you don\u2019t know planets, of course, but they\u2019re\u2014well, different ways people can live, that\u2019s all. Not very many stars are completely enclosed like ours, but you can put just as many people in a well-constructed swarm as we have in our shell. And of course there are other shells. They tend not to communicate much, though, after a few millennia. Well, you can imagine.\u201d\nInlesh tried. Ifenwa, he thought, is the size of the great sea. And the world has\u2014thousands of places the size of Ifenwa. Millions. And out there\u2014\nHe fixed his eyes on one star, red and dim. That star, he tried to tell himself, could have a whole world, as huge and various and strange as his own, with seas and ships and jungles and books and cats yawning in cages and people trying to find God. And that one, next to it. And that one\u2014\nIt was too much. He couldn\u2019t encompass it. No wonder his ancestors had hidden them. No wonder they had turned away from that infinite openness and concealed its existence; no wonder they had buried the very words under new strata of language, calling the lights of the far cities within the world \u201cstars\u201d to obscure the truth.\n\u201cTake me home,\u201d he managed. \u201cPlease. Take me home.\u201d\nThe machine person looked at him, their flat green eyes showing nothing, and Inlesh felt the unbridgeable gap between them: that here was someone who could encompass it, for whom such numbers and distances had meaning. Here was someone who could use words like always.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d they said, but Inlesh, knowing for the first time his own smallness and knowing even so that the perception he had of it could only be a shadow of the truth, had gone past speech now, and only stared mutely outward. After a while, the machine person made a sad little gesture. Had Inlesh been able to read it, he would have known the person to be admitting failure: perhaps it was best after all, they admitted, not to share this knowledge with the other peoples of the sphere. It was too much for them, who had been inside too long.\nThey communicated this, regretfully, to others, who had noted the activation of the transport module and wondered idly at its purpose. There was a certain amount of weary scolding, and Hia\u2019a was mentioned several times, and the reasons for rules. There were apologies, and arguments, and consultations, all in the seconds during which a hand was raised to touch Inlesh\u2019s shoulder.\nAt length, a decision was made. No one would know; memories need not be permanent. They would blur this one\u2019s recollections so that he would take no permanent damage from his experience, and adjust him so that he would not follow the same path of inquiry again, and send him home.\nInlesh woke at the base of the tower. It was morning, the segments of the night-shell folded back to thin lines barely visible on the surface of the sun. He felt fuzzy-headed, and vague.\nHe remembered walking away from the revel, and climbing the ridge, and after that\u2014dreams, he thought. Something dizzying and terrible, but he couldn\u2019t catch hold of it. He felt strange, oddly incurious, as though he ought to be wondering about something but couldn\u2019t be bothered to.\nAranthaw, he thought. I should get back. They would be leaving on the ebb tide for Treynou Bay, and then back to Gwylleridge, and then out on the circuit again. He\u2019d planned, a hundred days ago, that once he had some ship experience he\u2019d sign up for a different crew, a voyage further out. See the world in all its glorious strangeness. He\u2019d wanted that, hadn\u2019t he? Only now there didn\u2019t seem much point.\nHe poked at the lack of curiosity as at a missing tooth, as he made his way back down the path toward the shore. Something had happened. He\u2019d fallen asleep up there, maybe, and had a nightmare? He wasn\u2019t usually so unsettled by dreams.\nAnyway, Aranthaw and her circuit was enough. He didn\u2019t need anything more. He was, the thought came strongly, as though imprinted in him like a mark in solidified wax, satisfied with what he knew and did not need to seek out anything more. Somehow he knew he would never go looking for anything again.\nHe rejoined the crew before all of them had even woken up. They assumed he\u2019d gone off with some local, as no few of the sailors had, and he was chided for it, but with good humor. Aranthaw set out at midmorning, hugging the coastline, on the way to her next port of call. Inlesh worked his shift quietly, and anyone who noticed the change in him put it down to the sleepless night, and made the usual jokes, and thought nothing of it.\nLater that night, he burned his maps."}

They filled him with machines to bottle wine and installed the operating system that evolved into what he thought of as me. They built other factories, and warehouses, too, pressed against each other along both sides of the river.\nThen came more people. Thousands of them, every day, with their joys and heartbreaks, dreams and laughter. They worked, played, loved, and lived along the river, the lifeblood of the city.\nThe Factory missed the people.\nHe called out to them with his intercom, day and night for weeks and months, until the Warehouse across the river had had enough. She was two stories of beautiful red brick that gleamed gold every night at sunset. She rattled her windows at him\u2014the ones that had not yet broken.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not coming back,\u201d she said, her voice carrying across the water through her intercom that still buzzed each evening, as it was programmed to do, to signal quitting time for the workers.\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been years.\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t build us, only to abandon us. Without people, we have no purpose.\u201d He paused. \u201cThey were happy here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now the air and food and water are poison to them. To all living creatures. There aren\u2019t dogs, birds, or fish, either. Haven\u2019t you noticed? Or are you too busy wallowing?\u201d\nThe Factory had noticed. How could he not? The building beside him used to hum counterpoint to his own bottling machines until its roof collapsed last winter in a heavy snowstorm. Many other buildings had powered themselves down from despair and gone silent long ago.\nInside his own shell, dust gathered on wine barrels and sealed containers of nanobots. The bottle labels that proudly proclaimed Aphrodite\u2019s Blood, The Finest Infused Wine had cracked and faded. Old cars and trucks rusted in the parking lot, and weeds sprouted from the concrete lining the riverbanks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d the Warehouse said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThey said they would.\u201d\n\u201cThey lied.\u201d\nThe Warehouse\u2019s voice cracked with sadness. She believed what she said. Was she right? Would they both slowly decay and fall into ruin, empty and alone, until some electrical short finally caused them to cease to exist? The Factory stared into that bleak future and made a decision.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make them return.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d the Warehouse asked. \u201cThey\u2019ve never heard your calls, or cared. We\u2019re dead to them, if we were ever alive at all.\u201d\nHer skepticism stung, but his metal framing shivered with excitement.\n\u201cI\u2019ll use the river,\u201d he said.\nOn the day of the accident\u2014before alarms sounded throughout the city to tell the people to evacuate, run, get away as fast as you can\u2014the Factory helped one of his workers conduct a tour.\nHer name was Althea, and she had beautiful black skin and black hair twisted in a high knot atop her head. The Factory walked one of his humanoid robots beside her, past a chute that dropped nanobots into bottles of red wine, while Althea spoke to the tour group. She raised her voice above the hum, rattle, and grind of the machines.\n\u201cWho can tell me why we decant wine?\u201d\nA man raised his hand.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Althea said.\n\u201cSo the sediment doesn\u2019t end up in your glass.\u201d\n\u201cVery good. In older wines, sediment settles at the bottom of the bottle. We pour the wine slowly down the narrow neck of the decanter and stop when we reach the sediment, as my assistant will demonstrate.\u201d\nThat was the Factory\u2019s cue. He closed his robotic claws around a full, unlabeled bottle and a glass decanter that had been left on a table for this purpose. His audience gasped at the perfection of his fine motor control as he gently tipped the bottle to roll the wine over the decanter\u2019s lip without spilling a drop. When his visual sensors detected he had reached the sediment, he stopped and spread his mechanical mouth in a wide grin. He took a bow.\nThe audience laughed and clapped.\nThe Factory\u2019s circuits warmed at their admiration. Althea raised her hand for silence.\n\u201cBut this doesn\u2019t do us much good with infused wines like Aphrodite\u2019s Blood, right?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you leave the nanobots in the bottom of the bottle, you won\u2019t get the aphrodisiac effects that you bought the wine for in the first place.\u201d\nThe people nodded.\nThe Factory set down the bottle and decanter on the table, and picked up a second set. On this one, the bottle was labeled: Aphrodite\u2019s Blood, The Finest Infused Wine.\n\u201cYou treat an infused wine like a young wine,\u201d Althea said. \u201cWith younger wines that tend to be more tart and less mature, you decant to oxygenate. To bring the wine to life. You do this by roughing it up a bit.\u201d\nThe Factory used its robot\u2019s claws to flip the wine bottle, this time to aggressively pour its contents into the decanter. He shook the decanter for effect. Bubbles foamed to the surface. Human eyes could not see the microscopic nanobots swimming in the deep red liquid, but the robot\u2019s visual sensors detected them easily.\n\u201cThis not only brings the wine to life,\u201d Althea said. \u201cIt also brings to life our unique nanotechnology that makes Aphrodite\u2019s Blood the best-selling infused wine on the market today. So remember how to decant when you open a bottle to share with that special someone, and you\u2019ll get the most bang for your buck.\u201d\nSoon after that, the tour ended and Althea left the group in the store area to open their wallets and buy plenty of wine. The Factory sent its robot to a charging station, and Althea went to the break room for coffee.\n\u201cHow did I do?\u201d the Factory asked by piping his voice through the intercom beside Althea\u2019s table. Other workers in the break room, used to hearing him talk in this way, ignored their conversation.\nAlthea didn\u2019t look up from her smartphone. \u201cYou nailed it. You\u2019re a born showman. You\u2019re wasted as a factory operating system.\u201d\nShe always said that. He loved hearing it.\n\u201cSomeone must run the machines,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cBut I love putting on a show.\u201d\n\u201cI know you do.\u201d\nAn alarm sounded, a loud, high-pitched tone that rumbled through the Factory\u2019s floor. Althea looked up from her phone for the first time.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\nThe Factory received the notification a half-second later and routed it to all screens inside his building. \u201cThe alarm is a precaution. There\u2019s a malfunction in the cooling system at the city power plant with a small risk of meltdown. People there are working to fix the malfunction, but just in case, they\u2019re telling everyone to evacuate the area.\u201d\nAlthea\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cA meltdown?\u201d\n\u201cUnlikely. But possible.\u201d\n\u201cI should go.\u201d\n\u201cYes. But\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou will return?\u201d\nHe ran scenarios through his processors, as he did every evening at quitting time. Would the people return the next day? The probabilities always said yes. They said yes this time, too. How boring his existence would become without their companionship and conversation.\nAlthea threw away her Styrofoam coffee cup.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPromise?\u201d\nShe typed on her phone while she answered. \u201cWhen the plant is stabilized, I\u2019ll come back. This is where I get my paycheck, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if there\u2019s a meltdown? Will you come back for my hard drive and take me with you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure. See you tomorrow.\u201d\nShe left. All the workers left.\nYears later, Althea\u2019s coffee cup lay in the trashcan where she had dumped it. The Factory didn\u2019t blame her. The Warehouse was wrong when she said the people had lied. Althea would have come back for him if she could. Something had prevented her from fulfilling her promise. Or so he told himself.\n\u201cThe river?\u201d the Warehouse said and rattled her windows to show her skepticism. \u201cYou can\u2019t use the river for anything. It\u2019s dead, just like everything else. Killed by the carelessness of people and then forgotten when they moved onto the next place they could destroy.\u201d\nThe Factory didn\u2019t want to fight with her. The Warehouse had grown bitter. He understood that. He asked, \u201cDo you know why people decant wine?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Why would I?\u201d\n\u201cMost of the time it\u2019s to get rid of the sediment, but there\u2019s another reason, too. To bring the wine to life.\u201d Power surged through his circuits as his excitement built. \u201cI am going to decant the river.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cWait and see.\u201d\nThe people had left behind 189 barrels of wine and 51 sealed containers of nanobots. Another shipment of wine had been due to arrive the day after the accident and never had. Oh well. He would make do.\nOf his three robots, only one still operated\u2014the same one that had assisted Althea on that awful last day before he had been left alone and forgotten.\nWith it, he removed barrels from storage and rolled them past bottling machines covered in thick dust, out a door to the river. One by one, he left them along the riverbank.\nThe line of barrels grew. Ten, twenty, thirty. At thirty-five, he stopped for hours to recharge the robot. On barrel forty-two, the tip of one claw caught under a barrel\u2019s metal band and broke off. He spent a full day using his remaining claw to salvage a spare off one of the other robots. By the time he had finished, he had to recharge again.\nThe slow pace frustrated him. His workers would have finished this task in mere hours. Then again, if he had workers, this task would not be necessary.\n\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your\u2014\u201d the Warehouse began.\n\u201cTime?\u201d The Factory laughed. \u201cIf there\u2019s one resource I don\u2019t lack, it\u2019s time.\u201d\nBut his laughter hid fear. He had been able to fix his robot this time. But what if the robot suffered a malfunction that he couldn\u2019t fix? He would lose his arms and legs. Then he truly would be helpless.\nWhat then? Would he shut himself down? His foundation shuddered at the thought.\nBut he didn\u2019t want to give the Warehouse more fodder for her taunting, so he kept silent and continued his work with more caution.\nAfter he had moved all 189 barrels to the river, he moved the nanobots. Those were quicker. The containers were half the size of the barrels and an eighth of the weight.\n\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d the Warehouse asked while he drilled a hole in each barrel to funnel in nanobots.\nHe recalled what Althea used to say to tour groups. \u201cI\u2019m using the unique nanotechnology that makes Aphrodite\u2019s Blood the best-selling infused wine on the market today.\u201d\nCrack open a bottle with that special someone, she would say.\nHe wished he had a special someone. Impossible now that everyone had gone.\n\u201cYou have a screw loose.\u201d\n\u201cAt least I\u2019m doing something.\u201d\nShe rattled her windows. A sharp crack sounded as she rattled hard enough to break one. \u201cA bottle of wine is not the same as an irradiated city. Nothing will come of it.\u201d\n\u201cIf nothing changes, then I do no harm. Why are you so upset about it?\u201d\nShe huffed her intercom and fell silent.\nAfter the Factory had poured bots into each barrel, he charged his robot overnight. With the sunrise, the river ran yellow and orange. This was when the overnight security guard would go home and the daytime workers would punch in. They would put away their coats, wallets, and brown-bag lunches in lockers and work alongside the Factory\u2019s machines for another day of bottling and packaging wine.\nOn this morning, the Factory sent its robot to the riverbank with a hatchet. He hit the first barrel and pushed it into the river. The barrel bobbed and floated downstream while wine flowed out the hole, swirling red and swarming with nanobots. If the blood of the goddess of love could not save this city, then the Warehouse was right and nothing could.\nHe smashed the next barrel and tossed it in, and the next, until a hundred barrels bobbed along in the current.\nLive, he told the river. Live, and bring life.\nHe finished at noon, all 189 barrels in the river. He sent his robot to its charging station.\n\u201cNow what?\u201d the Warehouse asked.\nIt was the first thing she had said in hours. The Factory had missed her heckling. This realization came as a surprise to him.\n\u201cWe wait.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d\nThe barrels bobbed and twisted toward the heart of the city, and out of sight.\n\u201cThis will fix things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\nDays passed. A week. The Factory waited for a sign that the city\u2019s heart would beat again, that people would return. Another week passed. His beams creaked with the strain of his despair. Someone should have come by now.\nOne day, at sunset when the light transformed the Warehouse\u2019s brick from dull red to gleaming gold, she asked a simple question, but also the most complicated question of all.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she said.\nThe Factory thought for a while. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to be alone anymore.\u201d\nThe Warehouse seemed to gleam even brighter, reflected in the river between them. \u201cFor a smart operating system, you really are a fool.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never been alone. Only you\u2019ve been too blind to see it.\u201d\nThen the Factory understood. He had focused so hard on the people who had gone that he had never spared a thought for the one who had remained. He felt shame, but also hope, as he focused his visual sensors on the Warehouse. In the light of the setting sun, her bricks faded to lovely, burnished gold.\nCrack open a bottle with that special someone.\nIn a way, he had.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI never meant\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said.\nThey sat in companionable silence as the sun dipped behind the horizon and sky darkened.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not coming back, are they?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI could dump everything they left behind into the river, and it wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t leave.\u201d\nThis time when she rattled her windows, she did so softly\u2014a reassuring sound. \u201cI won\u2019t shut down if you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cPromise?\u201d\n\u201cCross my heart.\u201d\nThat night, to the Factory\u2019s visual sensors, the stars shined brighter than they had in a long time.\nThe next spring, the river ran thick with dark, wriggling fish. Never had there been so many, even before the people left.\nThe nanobots had done something, after all. They had scrubbed clean the river.\n\u201cSee?\u201d the Factory told the Warehouse. \u201cI told you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she said.\nJennifer Campbell-Hicks is a science fiction and fantasy writer whose work has appeared in Galaxy's Edge, Intergalactic Medicine Show, Nature and elsewhere.

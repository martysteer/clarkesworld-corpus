Worth Every Penny Paid\n I\u2019m going to start by admitting that I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. Nevertheless, I am a full-time writer and my path to achieving my lifelong dream isn\u2019t some quest where the rickety bridge collapsed behind me right after I crossed it. I didn\u2019t grab the only McGuffin along the way as I laid waste to the publishing gatekeepers. In other words, you can probably follow in my footsteps if you desire. Do you actually want to? You may not by the time this article is through, but, if you do, that\u2019s your prerogative. Don\u2019t say you weren't warned.\n Full-time writing is a lot like parenthood, without having to change diapers as often. Mind you, I have no children. Since we\u2019ve already established that I don\u2019t really know I\u2019m talking about, let\u2019s assume you trust me when I say you have to deal with a lot of shit. In the early days, writing will keep spitting up on your shirt and everyone will think what you\u2019re doing is \u201ccute.\u201d\n It\u2019s easy to get discouraged. It\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re wasting your damn time doing this stringing-words-together thing hoping to achieve some unattainable goal that seemingly requires pulling blackjack every hand for an hour. Well, you\u2019re not.\n You, my writing padawan, are acquiring necessary skills. You\u2019re assembling a writing toolbox. You\u2019re learning to fail. And fail you will, a crap ton of times as you learn that this metaphorical Phillips screwdriver doesn\u2019t work for squat trying to metaphorically caulk this metaphorical hole in the wall. I know, I know. It\u2019s all fun and metaphors until someone gets cut.\n Let\u2019s go back to the parenthood analogy. You\u2019re nurturing this writing baby and your desperate hope is that this baby grows up to be a productive member of society and not a serial killer.\n Regardless, honing these necessary skills will take time before you \u201cgo pro\u201d (and by that I mean someone out there decides that something you\u2019ve written is worth real tangible money). It could be ten years from the first time you sat down to write. It could be the next day (I hate you). Whatever amount of time it takes is the time it takes. I won\u2019t judge you and you shouldn\u2019t judge yourself.\n Let\u2019s say you\u2019re there already. You\u2019ve assembled that writing toolbox. You\u2019ve nurtured your writing career like the mewling babe it is and you \u201cthink\u201d you\u2019re ready to write full time. The path to full-time writing is usually slow unless you\u2019re incredibly lucky (I hate you) or a supremely talented individual (I hate you more) that somehow made it big on your first time up to bat (more confusing metaphors!). Thusly, I\u2019m willing to bet you probably work a day job or live with your parents. This is the time in your writing career where you do what you have to survive: serving coffee, programming, veterinarian-ing. This could last for a few years or the rest of your life. I\u2019ll write an article someday about holding down a full-time job and writing part time. I\u2019ll call it Time Management and Self-Immolation.\n How will you know when it\u2019s time to make the leap and become a full-time writer? Well, you won\u2019t know when until you know you have to. How\u2019s that for advice? The common wisdom I\u2019ve received from almost every career writer is that you work that day job until you can\u2019t. You work that day job until you\u2019re just juggling too much and something has to give. In my case, I got laid off and said screw it, I\u2019m going for it. Technically, I kept to the exact wording of \u201cwork that day job until I can\u2019t\u201d though I\u2019m pretty sure I violated the spirit of that statement. Goes to show how much my wisdom is worth, eh?\n Let\u2019s assume you have a day job, and you have a semblance of a writing career that\u2019s starting to take off. Suddenly, you\u2019re at Robert Frost\u2019s two roads diverging in the yellow wood. You need to figure out which path to take. Do you keep your soul-sucking functional tolerable wonderful job and write part time? Or do you say screw it (metaphorical screwdriver and all), I\u2019m going for it? There\u2019s no wrong answer to this. You do what you feel is right. However, here are a few questions to keep in mind:\n \n Do you like your day job more than writing? If the answer is yes, don\u2019t quit. Wow. This is easy.\n Are you a huge fan of financial security and retirement? If the answer is yes, don\u2019t quit. I personally plan to write until I die. Really, this advice thing isn\u2019t so hard. Eat your heart out, Wendig.\n Do you like stability? If the answer is yes, don\u2019t quit. This might be getting repetitive.\n Do you like only working forty hours a week? If yes, and assuming your current day job is a straight nine to fiver, then don\u2019t quit. Full-time writing is an all-encompassing seven-days/sixty-hours-a-week job with awful job security\u2014and when I say awful, I mean none\u2014and even worse medical. We sit on our asses a lot which is terrible for our health. That\u2019s another future article: Sitting on Our Asses Is Terrible for Our Health.\n Lastly, is money more important to you than a writing career? If the answer is yes, then don\u2019t quit.*\n \n Wait: let me put an asterisk on that last question. There. You probably read the asterisk before you read this sentence. It\u2019s kind of like a time travel thing just now, isn\u2019t it? Oh yeah, my time travel book, Time Salvager, is coming out in July 2015. How\u2019s that for name dropping? That will be another future article: Marketing Yourself: The Funny, the Subtle, and You.\n Anyway, the asterisk is because there are many variables to consider when comparing writing income to day-job income.\n For example, what\u2019s your dang day job?\n If you\u2019re a doctor, you\u2019ll probably make more with your day job.\n If you\u2019re a garbage man, you\u2019ll probably make more with your day job.\n If you\u2019re flipping burgers at McDonalds, you\u2019ll probably make more with your day job.\n This is why at conventions people call me Wesley the Optimist.\n Admittedly, there are many successful writers who make a pretty respectable living, and a couple who make it huge. Major props to those folks, but writing, as a career, is a feast or famine field. Ninety-five percent of us eke out a living, while the select few sit on their pile of treasure like Smaug. Do I have exact metrics? No, but I\u2019m willing to wager my last dollar bill that it\u2019s probably true. (Please don\u2019t take that dollar from me.)\n There is something to be said about the currency of doing what you love. If you love writing, and I don\u2019t know any career writers who don\u2019t, then that currency has a value to you that, added with the actual currency you earn as a writer, minus your financial obligations to adulthood, can help you decide whether making that full-time writing decision is the right one for you.\n So there you have it.\n I just want to remind you that I stated at the very beginning of this article that I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. Take everything I wrote with a grain of salt. It\u2019s not an easy path to take, and definitely one less traveled. It\u2019s extraordinarily rewarding with massive highs and some kick-you-in-the-gut lows. As someone who\u2019s worked in the corporate black hole for almost twenty years, I can safely say that this is the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done and it is the hardest I\u2019ve ever worked for the least amount of money but I would make this choice all over again.\n My final piece of advice? There will be many things you\u2019ll have to do when you cross that full-time bridge other than telling stories.\n For example, I am getting paid by the word for this article.\n Editor\u2019s note: No he isn\u2019t. We clearly communicated through a barrage of flaming arrows and carrier pigeons that the Another Word pieces are paid a flat rate (no matter how many words are crammed onto the page). We invite you to come back at an undetermined time to view Wesley\u2019s upcoming piece on reading the fine print titled, \u201cHow to Avoid Flaming Bird Shit\u2014a.k.a, Dealing with Editors.\u201d\n Author\u2019s Note: Last piece of advice. Read your contracts and rates before writing articles!\n Wesley Chu's best friend is Michael Jordan, assuming that best friend status is earned by a shared television commercial. If not, then his best friend is his dog Eva who he can often be seen riding like a trusty steed through the windy streets of Chicago.\n In 2014, Wesley Chu was shortlisted for the John W. Campbell Best New Writer Award. Chu's debut novel, The Lives of Tao, earned him a Young Adult Library Services Association Alex Award and a Science Fiction Goodreads Choice Award Finalist slot. The sequel, The Deaths of Tao, continues the story of secret agent Roen Tan and his sarcastic telepathically bonded alien, Tao.\n Chu has two books scheduled for 2015. The last book in the Tao trilogy, The Rebirths of Tao, is coming out April 7th. Time Salvager, published by Tor Books, featuring an energy stealing time traveler with addiction issues, is slated for July 7th, 2015."}

At the time I was nine years old. In the Umatac village records I\u2019m still a male named Magahet Joseph Howard USN. It\u2019s good luck to be given the name of an ancestor from Before Silence. My brother calls me Shithead, because he\u2019s my brother. But most people call me Bridge, because the governors gave me that. Someone in every village is appointed to stand with one dusty foot in the past and the other planted in the Great Future, ready to take action when ships appear on the blue horizon.\nSounds important. Don\u2019t be fooled. We\u2019re not some backwards cargo cult, building mock radio towers in the magical hope of luring back civilization. Civilization will come again regardless. We\u2019re sure of it.\nIt\u2019s hot today, late afternoon. I\u2019m sitting on the beach and thinking hard about taking a nap. A dozen yards offshore, blue waves roll around Fouha Rock, where the gods created mankind. No kidding: it\u2019s a giant limestone phallus jutting out of the sea.\n\u201cWhat are you staring at, Shithead?\u201d my brother Rai shouts when the canoes return.\n\u201cYour tiny shriveled-up balls,\u201d I yell back.\nThe men laugh. Among them is my husband Pulan Robert, who comes to me at night with reverence and good humor. He has a second wife, Kami Brittany, who bears him our children and hopes that one day I\u2019ll be gored to death by a boonie pig. She can\u2019t say that too loudly, though, for fear I\u2019ll call down upon her a vengeful taotaomo\u2019na. Those are the spirits that slink through the nunu trees under moonlight, and moan during storms as if in great pain, and brush their invisible cold hands over your nape when you least expect it.\nShe\u2019s right to worry. I know the names of seven thousand taotaomo\u2019na. Seven thousand ancestors who perished here in the After Silence. There\u2019s a man in Yigo who knows twelve thousand. The oldest woman on the island lives in Dededo, and she knows fifteen thousand. The governors gave them to her, just like they gave them to me, through white caps clamped to our skulls.\nI try not to think about the white caps too much.\nThe men beach the canoes and haul out their catches. Pulan Robert smiles at me and waves over to where Kami waits with our youngest daughter bouncing on her hip. A moment later his smile dims. Our visitors have arrived. Four men, tall and lean, with walking sticks wrapped in copper wire and the green ribbons of Agat village.\nRai stops beside me and frowns. \u201cThey\u2019re late.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re on time.\u201d\n\u201cLate,\u201d he insists. \u201cThey\u2019ll slow us down tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cTwo days to get there,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThen you\u2019ll see Angelina again.\u201d\nAt sunset our entire village dines on roasted fruit bats, fresh rabbit fish, breadfruit, cakes, and tuba. The musicians play nose flutes and drums for the children dancing around the bonfire. Three of the men from Agat know of me, but the fourth keeps sliding glances my way. Beneath my blouse, my bra is stuffed with soft grass. I wear a wig of long hair, dark and straight.\n\u201cBabae?\u201d he asks his companions in Tagalog. Many Filipinos clustered in Agat in the After Silence.\n\u201cOo,\u201d his friends say.\nHe wants to know if I\u2019m a girl. Yes, they say. But he looks at me doubtfully. Wondering what\u2019s under my skirt, maybe wondering if he can put his hands under there to squeeze and rub.\nPulan Robert puts his arm around my shoulder. He smells like salt and fish and Kami.\n\u201cYou should stay here,\u201d he says that night, in our bed, as we stare up at the tin and thatch ceiling. Kami\u2019s hut is bigger, but mine is closer to the cooling ocean breeze. Mosquitoes nibble on our arms.\n\u201cI have to go. Someone has to remember the dead,\u201d I remind him.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come along and keep you company.\u201d\n\u201cRai is coming.\u201d\n\u201cRai is too impatient. He won\u2019t pay attention.\u201d\nI kiss his nose. \u201cRai will always pay attention to me.\u201d\nRai\u2019s impatient because it\u2019s been six months since he\u2019s held his wife in his arms. In the morning, he\u2019s awake before anyone else. At breakfast, somber Irao speaks quietly to his crying children. The fourth from our village is Husto, who has spent the last week pleading to our little governor that he should be excused from this duty. She stands firm. The lottery is fair and the gods have picked him to take his turn digging. I wonder if we\u2019re going to have to physically lift Husto in the air and carry him away, but finally he pries himself away from his weeping mother.\n\u201cTravel safely,\u201d Pulan Robert says, with a final warm kiss.\n\u201cI will,\u201d I promise.\nThe men from Agat lead the way down the road. We follow, and only Husto looks back.\nDespite the solemn occasion, I like these trips. Before Silence, you could drive all over Guahan on asphalt roads, from the turquoise waters of Cocos Lagoon all the way north to the limestone cliffs at Ritidian Point. The shrine for the Japanese soldiers who killed themselves, the international airport for big jets, the army tanks abandoned after the war\u2014you could visit them all in just one day. Now the roads are all rubble, and bandits control the bridges, and some of the white villages up north won\u2019t let you pass over their lands without payment. Rai and I tried rowing around the island once when we were young. We nearly shredded ourselves on the reefs. Ours is the age of footpaths and walking sticks, and many people die without ever having stepped outside the villages they were born in.\nThe coastal route to Layon is pretty enough, but I\u2019d like to see more of the old military bases. My namesake Joseph Howard USN worked on one of those. The concrete shells of the buildings are all gutted and stripped out, the roofs blown away by typhoons or leveled by earthquakes. Those ruins are less sad, somehow, than the iron skeletons of hotel high-rises in Hagatna, the resorts where the tourists honeymooned and gambled away their fortunes until the Night of Fire.\nImagine it: two hundred thousand people drinking or dreaming or fucking or hunched over military equipment in the middle of the night, in the middle of the endless ocean, and in the gap from one minute to the next, all the technology died. No telephones, radios, satellites, computers. All the power stations erupted into fire. All the transformers and electrical wires sizzled and fried themselves into charred metal. In the skies above, enormous waves of green light shimmered against the moon and stars. The governors gave me just enough science to know what the Northern Lights are, and why they should never be seen this close to the equator.\nI rub my head, remember the tight white caps, and keep walking.\nOur first step is Fort Nuestra, high on the bluff, to make our offers to the Lady. She\u2019s not the oldest of our gods, but she\u2019s the one Magellan and the Spanish gave to us while they burned our huts and killed our chiefs. When I was very small, I would pray to the Lady to take away my cock. She never did. I don\u2019t hold it against her, though, not much anyways, because Pulan Robert likes it well enough in the dark.\nAfter praying and leaving gifts we continue on to Merizo. Only a few families are left to greet us. Merizo went to war with Inarajan last year and came out on the poorer end. The fight was supposedly over the ownership of a prized carabao, but was probably about skin color or religion. For now Merizo only has one worker to send to the landfill, a teenage boy with a topknot dangling from his otherwise bare skull.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to dig up a radio and battery,\u201d he tells me as we drink tuba by the ruins of a church. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Jesus Christ.\u201d\nMerizo\u2019s always been known for this kind of talk. I don\u2019t mind it. Husto, though, announces that Jesus Christ died on the Night of Fire, and this makes the boy\u2019s parents angry. While they argue, I walk away to piss. A woman with limestone white hair follows me. Her left leg drags in the dirt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the \u2018idge,\u201d she says, the words slurred.\nHer name is Nena and she should be dead now, or so the story goes. While working at the landfill she was accidentally buried by the shifting, stinking debris. By the time they pulled her out, she\u2019d been breathing bad air for too long. A quick death might have been more merciful, but Nena\u2019s father carried his only child back to Merizo and cared for her until he died in the war.\n\u201cI\u2019m Isa,\u201d I tell her, pulling down my skirt.\n\u201cI \u2018ound the \u2018eet,\u201d she says.\nI shake my head, not understanding.\nShe waves her good hand toward the ocean. \u201cThe \u2018eet.\u201d\nFleet. She found the Fleet. She wouldn\u2019t be the first. Usually, though, there\u2019s a lot of tuba involved, or smoked weeds, or the fanciful imagination of children.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any ships, Nena.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018ailor,\u201d she says, and gestures toward the jungle.\n\u201cShow me.\u201d\nChickens scatter before our feet on a narrow path. From the vines and bushes peek out old cement houses on cracked foundations. One hut without doors or a roof is so overgrown you\u2019d miss it if you weren\u2019t looking closely. Inside sits a white man, his face ghastly with pain and his eyes half-lidded. He smells like shit and urine. In his right hand is a sharp curved knife.\n\u201cThe \u2018eet,\u201d Nena repeats.\nThe rips in his clothing and long scrapes on his arms say he washed in over the reef, but any fool fisherman from the north can fall over the side of a boat. I kneel in the doorway.\n\u201cGood day, sir,\u201d I say. \u201cCan you tell me your name? Your village?\u201d\nHe struggles to focus. Twitches the knife, as if trying to raise his arm. He starts to ramble\u2014short, disconnected words, none of them in English or Chamorro or Tagalog.\nBut I know these words. The governors gave me nations and languages before they gave me names to carry. This man is speaking Russian.\nMy throat goes tight.\nTo Nena, I say, \u201cHe comes from Yona. They speak strange up there. Nothing more than that.\u201d\nHer expression falls. \u201cNot \u2018eet?\u201d\n\u201cNot Fleet, no,\u201d I say confidently. \u201cWhen the Fleet returns, an armada of ships will sail into the bay bearing food and wine. They\u2019ll set off fireworks and play the United States anthem. This is just a lost fisherman who needs our help. Return to the beach and find my brother Rai. He\u2019s the tallest, the most handsome. Bring him here. But don\u2019t let anyone else see you. They\u2019ll claim the reward his village has for him.\u201d\nA new light gleams in her eyes at the mention of reward, and she hurries off.\nIf Nena had bothered to examine the Russian\u2019s clothes, she would have seen that even stiff with sea salt, the fabric is newer and finer than anything we can weave or dig up here. He\u2019s wearing lightweight boots with fresh rubber soles. For a white man he\u2019s pale\u2014a sailor who doesn\u2019t see much sun. Maybe he came from a submarine. The governors showed us pictures of those.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask in Russian.\nHis rambling stops. A hairy brown spider crawls down his leg. He doesn\u2019t brush it off.\n\u201cDid you come alone? Can I call someone for help?\u201d\n\u201cSergei,\u201d he murmurs.\nMaybe that\u2019s his name, maybe someone else\u2019s. Before I can ask his head slumps over and the knife tumbles from his lax fingers. I see dark blood on the back of his skull. There\u2019s a swelling there, a stone-like bump. No other major injuries on him, no jewelry or electronics, only the knife and its leather sheath strapped under his left trouser leg.\nHe may not have much time left, or he could recover enough to cause serious damage.\nAs always, I am sworn to uphold Rule Number One.\nI squeeze his nose shut and clap my hand over his mouth.\nLife is a stubborn habit to break. It\u2019s a sacred thing, to watch the spirit struggle to take flight. You can see it in the flopping fish pulled from the sea, or in the panicking pig as the knife pierces its throat. The Russian makes muffled sounds and jerks his head, but has no strength to fight me off. I pray to the gods and governors for him. No one here will mourn his death with a nine day feast. But most living things deserve kindness in their last moments, to hear words ushering them to the arms of their ancestors.\nWhen she returns with Rai, Nena\u2019s eyes turn accusatory.\n\u201cHe passed quietly, without pain,\u201d I say. \u201cHis people from Yona will want to come and retrieve his bones. Rai, bury him in a shallow grave. But don\u2019t tell anyone, or let them help, or they\u2019ll want the reward, too.\u201d\nRai balks. \u201cWhat reward?\u201d\nI squeeze his arm. \u201cThe people of Yona will be grateful to know what happened to him.\u201d\nHe opens his mouth, maybe to say the people of Yona are nothing but swindlers and drunkards. My fingers dig deeper into his skin. He\u2019s not an idiot, my brother, so he goes silent. Nena, bent over the naked corpse, sniffs in grief.\n\u201c\u2018is clothes,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI took them for his people,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHis last words were to thank you, Nena. His spirit rests in peace because of your kindness. He asked that you seclude yourself and say rosaries for him. If you don\u2019t, his taotaomo\u2019na will be very angry. Will you do it?\u201d\nShe nods emphatically. \u201cYes.\u201d\nBack at the church, the others want to know where Rai is. \u201cToo much feasting last night,\u201d I lie, and they sympathize. Everyone here has suffered from the squats before.\nHusto gestures to the folded fern leaves in my arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cA gift for the taotaomo\u2019na,\u201d I warn him. \u201cDon\u2019t touch.\u201d\nWe bid farewell to Merizo and detour into the valley to visit both Tinta and Faha Caves. I worry that Nena won\u2019t do as told. Or that Rai will discover something incriminating that I left behind. But the caves require my full concentration. Back in World War II, the Japanese soldiers spent years raping the women, killing old and young alike, forcing people from their homes to concentration camps. Here, as the end of the war drew near, they herded villagers into caves and tossed grenades in after them. Other victims were tied up and beheaded and left in the dirt.\nI don\u2019t have their names\u2014no Bridge does\u2014but we know that the Japanese brutality made the people of Merizo rise up in rebellion. We honor them, too, in this sacred place heavy with memory.\n\u201cYou tell the story well,\u201d Irao comments, afterward.\n\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to tell it at all,\u201d I reply.\nAfter the ceremonies we trek back to the coast, where dark gray clouds are rolling in from the south. We make it to Achang Bay before the rain starts. The only shelter is an old fueling station with two walls and a sand floor. Irao and Husto sit to one side of me, and on the other sits the man from Agat who doesn\u2019t believe I\u2019m a woman.\n\u201cThe gods don\u2019t want us to go to Layon,\u201d Husto says as water pelts down.\n\u201cYou whine like a child,\u201d Irao tells him.\nThe man from Agat looks like he\u2019s thinking of putting his hand on my thigh. I slide my fingers along the sheath of my knife, and he decides to stare at the rain instead.\nBy dusk the weather is clear but it\u2019s too late to continue on. The men look for wood dry enough to burn while I worry about Rai. It doesn\u2019t take that long to dig a shallow grave, and the detour to Tinta and Faha cost us time.\nIrao knows me well. \u201cHe\u2019ll be along soon.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d I say.\nEventually the men build a fire, and we eat supper quietly, and afterward they smoke and drink more tuba. Rai does not come. We all stretch out under the dark, starry sky and rising full moon. I\u2019m halfway through the first thousand names in my head when from the jungle arises a long, low, awful moan of pain. Someone\u2014or something\u2014in agony, in torment.\nWe all sit up in fear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pig,\u201d says one of the men from Amat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Anufat,\u201d says Husto, naming the ugliest and meanest of the taotaomo\u2019na. Anufat has fangs and claws, and sometimes not even a head.\nIrao tosses sand at Husto. \u201cStop telling stories.\u201d\n\u201cHe wants his gift,\u201d Husto insists, pointing to the fern leaves I\u2019d forbidden anyone to touch. \u201cYou said it was for him.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s for another,\u201d I protest.\nThe moan again: drawn out agony that makes my stomach flutter. Not Rai, I tell myself. But that fear grabs me and doesn\u2019t let go, and after the third terrible time, I stand up.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Irao offers.\n\u201cNo. I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d I pick up the folded leaves. \u201cStoke the fire and stay here.\u201d\nBy the time I reach the edge of the jungle the fire is bright again, the men nothing but silhouettes. A narrow path, mostly overgrown, curves from behind the fueling station into the nunu trees. Brown snakes curl away from my bare feet. The knife in my hand won\u2019t do anything against a spirit, but I have salt, too, and words, and if I have to run I can run, too, faster than anyone can imagine.\nThe steady sea breeze shifts the trees and leaves, makes shadows flicker, tricks my eyes with movement\u2014and then a hand clamps down over my mouth, yanks me backward. The dead man\u2019s clothes and knife spill from their leafy envelope and scatter on the ground. My knife gets lost in the bushes. Someone speaks low against my ear, a command of some kind. I stop struggling.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask in Russian, muffled, garbled.\nHe repeats his command. Be quiet, he\u2019s saying. He pulls me backward through brush into a small clearing where Rai is curled up on the ground, his hands and ankles bound, his mouth gagged.\n\u201cI\u2019m a friend,\u201d I insist, the words mostly unintelligible. \u201cFriend.\u201d\nHis free hand gropes my hips and ass. Looking for a weapon. He finds my cock instead and makes a startled noise. A moment later he yanks me down to the ground against Rai and lays a sharp blade against my exposed throat. My skin stings. Rai grunts. The moonlight illuminates the stranger\u2019s pale face but I can\u2019t see his eyes, or what emotion might be in them.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demands in Russian.\n\u201cIsa.\u201d\nHe yanks at my wig, rips at my skirt. My cock hangs out, long and soft. He slaps at it and says, \u201cNot a woman.\u201d\nIf I had my knife, I\u2019d cut his hand off. Instead I keep my chin up and stare straight at him. \u201cSergei?\u201d\nHe hesitates. The slightest flick of his wrist and he can end my life. I\u2019m breathing fast and my insides are watery. Some things you can\u2019t control.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing he said,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSergei.\u201d\nAnother long moment. Then, \u201cHow did he die?\u201d\n\u201cFrom his head injury. He said you might come, that you\u2019d tell us everything. Not that you\u2019d attack and try to kill us.\u201d\nThe Russian sits back on his haunches. Rai grunts against his gag. Carefully I put my hand on his leg. He can\u2019t understand what we\u2019re saying. He thinks that we\u2019re only a few moments from death, and I wouldn\u2019t call him wrong.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Sergei?\u201d I repeat.\n\u201cYes. He was Vasilly.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re from Russia?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Russia.\u201d His voice is flat.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the first visitors from the outside world in a hundred years,\u201d I say, and the thrill of it runs through me. No other Bridge has ever found a man from away. The governors will be happy with me. Maybe I can finagle a reward; fewer workers to the dump each season, perhaps, or some other special favor.\nSergei points his finger and says, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\nHe retreats to search through Vasilly\u2019s scattered clothing and boots. In the darkness I tug on Rai\u2019s knots, but my fingers are trembling and the cords are wound too well.\nSergei returns with Vasilly\u2019s knife. He unscrews the base of the hollow grip. Inside are blue fireflies. Electric lights. I haven\u2019t seen those in a long time. The weapon is some kind of tracking or communication device, designed for stealth. He slides out a narrow part and wedges free a luminescent strip. Quick, efficient moves.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve hoped for your return,\u201d I say, trying to sound awed. \u201cPrayed for it.\u201d\nSergei pockets the strip. \u201cForget prayers. We\u2019re only here for information.\u201d\n\u201cHonored visitor, our governors would be happy to share anything we know.\u201d\nHe snorts, though I\u2019m the one who should laugh. Information. Fishing reports, maybe? Average daily rainfall? No man treks across the Pacific, dares to swim between the reefs, and subsequently avoids the local population without good reason.\n\u201cHow is it that you speak Russian?\u201d he asks.\nI duck my head. \u201cThere was a man, many years ago. He washed ashore the way your friend did. He recovered and lived in the jungle by himself. I would visit him, bring him companionship, and he taught me to speak it.\u201d\nHe looks at my cock and shakes his head. Imaging perversion, maybe. Defending his imaginary countryman from the likes of me. The truth is much worse, of course. Those white caps, burning hot. My hair never grew back.\n\u201cOur governors would greet you with open arms,\u201d I insist. \u201cThey\u2019ve kept all the records from the Before time. They know everything about the island and what was here when the world went silent.\u201d\nBehind me, Rai struggles quietly against his bonds.\n\u201cWhat governors?\u201d Sergei asks. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d I tell him.\nSergei wants to leave Rai behind. I can\u2019t risk it. Despite Rai\u2019s many fine qualities, he\u2019s terrible at keeping secrets. Sooner or later he\u2019ll tell Irao and Husto what he\u2019s seen. They\u2019ll tell people at the landfill. Those people will go back to their villages and spread word. And the governors will most definitely not be pleased.\nSo instead I convince Sergei that the governors despise me and consider me crazy, an insult to their masculinity. They\u2019ll only allow us near their village if a local man guides us. Sergei looks doubtful, but it\u2019s not hard for him to believe that here I\u2019m an abomination. Eventually he unties Rai and lets him stand. I try to soothe over their unfortunate introduction to one another.\n\u201cHe\u2019s Fleet,\u201d Rai says, both angry and amazed.\n\u201cNo, not Fleet,\u201d I tell him. \u201cJust a fisherman lost in a storm. He come from Hawaii.\u201d\nOf course, we haven\u2019t had contact with Hawaii since Before Silence. Any stray fisherman would have to survive four thousand miles of open sea to reach our shore. But no one ever taught Rai geography.\nStill, he\u2019s skeptical. \u201cIf he\u2019s a fisherman, why did he want to kill us?\u201d\n\u201cHe thought we killed his brother. He was afraid.\u201d\nSergei watches us. He can\u2019t understand a word of Chamorro, or maybe he\u2019s just pretending not to. Perhaps they don\u2019t have white caps where he comes from.\n\u201cHawaii,\u201d Rai muses. \u201cWe could go there. We could trade, maybe, and no one would have to dig at the landfill anymore. My children, your children\u2014Isa, this could change everything for them.\u201d\n\u201cThe governors will decide,\u201d I say. \u201cI have to take him there.\u201d\nRai hesitates. He\u2019s my big brother. He used to fight bullies for me when we were dusty children. He cried the day our uncles took me away to Talofofo. He came to walk me home when they were finished burning knowledge into my head. But the mother of his children is waiting for him at Layon.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him by myself,\u201d I tell him. \u201cGo get Angelina.\u201d\nHe frowns. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he says curtly.\nWe circle through the jungle to avoid Irao, Husto, and the men from Agat. For hours we walk along the old highway. No sentries or dogs raise an alarm as we ghost through Inarajan. I wish we had water. Sergei\u2019s careful to walk behind us, never letting Rai or me out of his sight.\n\u201cIs there an army?\u201d Sergei asks.\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMost of the military evacuated or died off After Silence.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about an army of your own people?\u201d\nI don\u2019t think that he wants an entire history of the militia here, how the local men trained under the Spanish and fought the Japanese and eventually became the Guam National Guard.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need. We only fight each other once in awhile. Do they have armies where you come from?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, but I think he\u2019s lying.\nWe trudge on. Boonie pigs trample away in the bushes when our feet come too close. To stay awake, I recite the second thousand of the names in my head. In my fatigue, some syllables slip out.\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Sergei asks tightly.\n\u201cI\u2019m praying,\u201d I tell him. \u201cFor your friend. You were very close?\u201d\nHe grunts.\n\u201cHe said your name before he died. He sounded . . . fond.\u201d\n\u201cHe was only a man from my\u2014\u201d Sergei says, and stops. From his ship? From his base? Maybe from his bed.\nCarefully I say, \u201cIf there are others of your people nearby, they are welcome as well.\u201d\nNothing. I glance back. Sergei has stopped to stare at a faint orange glow in the hills. Rai glances, too, but only for a moment. Those are the lights of Layon. The last gift of the old world. There aren\u2019t many options for garbage on an island like this. You have to pile it somewhere, otherwise you dump it into the ocean\u2014all those car batteries and paint cans, light bulbs and lead pipes, the plastic wrap from food, the dirty diapers and soiled cat litter, generations of toxic messes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up there?\u201d Sergei asks.\n\u201cAn old landfill. They burn off the gasses so they can dig.\u201d\nHe swats at a bug on his neck. \u201cWhat are they digging for?\u201d\nI shrug. \u201cAnything useful.\u201d\nThe sky is pink-gold by the time we reach the old satellite tracking station above Inarajan. It\u2019s just a bunch of concrete buildings now, long abandoned, but Sergei pokes around in interest.\n\u201cWhat was this place?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cSomething called NASA,\u201d I tell him. \u201cPeople used to visit the moon and this place helped them not get lost.\u201d\n\u201cA tracking station.\u201d\n\u201cDo people still live up there? On the moon?\u201d\nHe kicks at an old fencepost. \u201cIf there are, they don\u2019t answer when we call them.\u201d\nFor the first time I really think about the world Sergei comes from. Out there they\u2019ve had the raw materials, factory resources, and technical know-how to manufacture new transformers and power stations. By now they\u2019ve rebuilt the radio stations, the telephone systems, and maybe even the Internet. They probably have medicines like aspirin and insulin, and no one dies of illnesses like appendicitis or childbirth.\nAll of these things would make life on Guahan easier.\nBut at a cost. Magellan taught us that.\n\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d I ask Rai once we\u2019re walking again.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s kind of stupid question is that?\u201d he asks, brushing thick green leaves from the path.\nSergei says, \u201cStop talking.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be completely honest with anything the governors ask you,\u201d I tell him. And then, to Sergei, in Russian, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I asked my brother not to let them beat me when we reach our leaders. I shame them, the men.\u201d\nSergei says, \u201cIf they beat you, why do you dress that way?\u201d\nHe reminds me of the villagers when I was still Magahet Joseph Howard USN. Dress like a boy. Act like a boy. Can you teach a stone to act like a tree, or a bird to act like a dolphin? The governors said many long-ago ancestors were proud to be Fa\u2019afafine, in the manner of male and female alike. Their approval made the criticism go silent, or at least less vocal.\n\u201cI follow my heart,\u201d I tell Sergei. \u201cAs all men and women should. Don\u2019t your people do that?\u201d\nSergei coughs. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cVasilly was more than your friend, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d And some of this is just guessing, but a name murmured in longing is hard to forget.\nHis face turns hard. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s gone now.\u201d\nSeveral minutes later we reach the outskirts of Talofofo Park. The parking lot has long returned to vegetation, and the gondolas disassembled or left to rust. Here the governors live in the old history museum, flanked by ramshackle huts and old latte stones and the fresh waters of the Ugum River. It\u2019s all small, unimpressive, nothing to look at twice. A sentry yawns when he sees us.\n\u201cWho comes?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cRai of Umatuc,\u201d Rai says. \u201cAnd my sister the Bridge.\u201d\nThe sentry yawns again and scratches his ass. \u201cWhat business?\u201d\n\u201cThis man comes from away,\u201d I say.\nSergei nudges me nervously. \u201cTell your governors to come out here.\u201d\n\u201cThe governors are old men who believe in tradition,\u201d I reply. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you all the old records here, but we have to do things their way.\u201d\nHe continues to look skittish. But the sentry shrugs as if unimpressed with our visitor and pushes open the museum door. Inside all is dim and empty. I remember being nine years old and standing here with the children of other villages, waiting for our education from the wise governors. We all thought we\u2019d been picked for a special destiny.\nThere\u2019s no such thing as destiny. Only inevitability.\nThe sentry takes us into a courtyard with woven mats circled around a cooking fire. \u201cWait here.\u201d\nSergei shuffles his feet, undecided, but I plop down and Rai follows.\nAn old man in a threadbare shirt shuffles from the house a few minutes later. \u201cIsa,\u201d he says, a toothless smile on his face. He shakes Rai\u2019s hand, nods respectfully at Sergei. Behind him, a hunched servant brings out tea. The old man, Kepuha, sits with a creaking of his knees.\nI introduce Sergei in Russian and explain that Kepuha, too, knew the mythical old stowaway, learned this strange foreign language.\n\u201cWe must celebrate your arrival,\u201d Kepuha says, all kindness. \u201cSuch a momentous day.\u201d\n\u201cThey say you can help me with information, sir,\u201d Sergei says.\nKepuha nods. \u201cYes, much information. All the old missiles. All those other terrible weapons. It\u2019ll be a relief to be rid of them.\u201d\nSergei relaxes. He\u2019s close, now, to what he came for.\nRai can\u2019t follow their words, but he knows some kind of agreement is being discussed. \u201cHonored uncle, will they trade with us?\u201d\n\u201cA good question to ask,\u201d Kepuha says.\nWe all drink our cool, sweetened tea. More servants bring toasted bread, boiled eggs, and strips of bacon. Kepuha turns to Sergei and talks more about weapons. On the roof of the museum, another sentry appears. Some young men carry large baskets through the far end of the courtyard. The skin on my neck prickles.\n\u201cHonored Kepuha, my brother and I have family business in Layon,\u201d I say in Chamorro. \u201cWe should depart.\u201d\nKepuha waves his gnarled hand. \u201cThere\u2019s time to rest. You must be exhausted.\u201d\nEven as I watch, Rai\u2019s eyes slide shut. He leans sideways and sprawls into the dust. Sergei realizes at the same time I do that our food is drugged. He leaps up, tries to dart away, but gets no farther than a few feet before a guard knocks him down and kicks him in the ribs.\n\u201cMy brother\u2014\u201d I say, slurred. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSleep,\u201d Kepuha says. \u201cYou did well, Bridge.\u201d\nMy ears fill with a rushing noise and the sluggish crawl of my own heart. A sweet cool river, just like the river Ugum, carries me away to darkness.\nThe next time I see Sergei, he\u2019s screaming. The soldiers have him naked and strapped to a table, a white cap affixed to his head. I know what it\u2019s like to writhe as knowledge is forced into neural connections. Like lightning striking the brain, over and over. But Sergei\u2019s pain is worse because they\u2019re not putting data into his brain. They\u2019re yanking it out.\nThe back of my throat burns with bile.\nColonel Kepuha of the Guahan Militia stands beside me, watching through the mirrored window. Electric lights illuminate the rooms down here under the museum. Fresh, cool air circulates from pumps. The entire base runs off the power from recycled material dug out of the Layon landfill. Trash converted to fuel. One of the last great technological achievements of the old world. After Silence, our ancestors couldn\u2019t fix the whole island. But they could fix this place.\nSergei screams again.\n\u201cIs this . . . necessary?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t answer questions about his homeland,\u201d Kepuha says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nTake a hump of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Build a fort on it. Build another. Keep building, decade after decade, ports and airfields and depots of concrete and steel. Swap ownership during wartime. Swap it back. Add secret research labs dedicated to memory research. The future looks unlimited. But then civilization collapses, all of it, swallowed up by solar mega-flares, and that hump of land has to fend for itself.\n\u201cYou did well, bringing him here,\u201d Kepuha says. \u201cWe\u2019ll dig up the body of the one you killed and find out what we can from it.\u201d\nWith effort, I keep my voice steady. \u201cWho says I killed him?\u201d\nHe turns to me. \u201cOf course you did. You learned your lessons well.\u201d\nOne foot rooted in the past. One planted in the future. The job of a Bridge isn\u2019t to greet the Fleet, but to stop it.\n\u201cWhat of my brother, sir?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe thinks the strangers were fisherman from Hawaii. I\u2019ll make him swear not to tell, and if he does, no one will believe him anyway.\u201d\nKepuha smiles indulgently and starts walking down the hall. \u201cYour brother is a good man?\u201d\nI follow. \u201cYes. Very good and honorable.\u201d\n\u201cEven honorable men can have loose tongues.\u201d\n\u201cYou can trust him as much as you trust me,\u201d I promise.\nWe\u2019ve reached another window and another memory room. The table inside is empty.\n\u201cWhen you finished your training as a child, how many names did you leave with?\u201d Kepuha asks casually.\nI rub the goosebumps on my arms. \u201cSeven thousand.\u201d\n\u201cYou left with one thousand,\u201d he says. \u201cWe give you another thousand more every time you bring us someone from Fleet. A reward for good service. A way to fill the gaps.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I gulp against a new surge of bile. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I\u2019d remember.\u201d\nThe doors in the room open and two guards drag Rai inside. He fights them, my brother does, but they\u2019re much stronger. They strap him down and reach for a cap.\nColonel Kepuha says, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t remember. You never do.\u201d\nOriginally published in We See a Different Frontier, edited by Djibril al-Ayad and F\u00e1bio Fernandes\nSandra McDonald is a former military officer, recovering Hollywood assistant, and perennially patient college instructor who writes across the genres of romance, history, fantasy, science fiction, GLBTQA, and young adult fiction.

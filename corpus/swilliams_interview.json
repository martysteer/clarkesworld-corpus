Her mother had a master\u2019s degree in microbiology; her father sparked her interest in genre fiction, reading Edgar Rice Burroughs to her. He had a membership to the Science Fiction Book Club, which delivered books every month. Once the spark caught, she read everything she could get her hands on. At the library she discovered a secret code: the books she loved had spaceships on the spines.\n Williams attended Elmira College in upstate New York. She spent a year abroad at the London School of Economics before graduating with a degree in philosophy. She earned her master\u2019s in philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, MO.\n In 1981, Williams joined the publishing industry, starting in a subsidiary rights department. In 1982, she became an assistant at Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine, where she would work with the eponymous author and editor for ten years. Williams was given more responsibilities in weeks and the managing editor title in three years. In 1992, she cofounded the Dell Magazines Award for Undergraduate Excellence with Rick Wilber, a project that nurtures emerging authors beyond simply handing them a prize.\n She became editor of Asimov\u2019s in 2004 when Gardner Dozois retired. Williams has been a Hugo Award finalist for editing almost every year since 2006 and won in 2011 and 2012. The magazine won Locus Awards in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. In 2018, she was given SFWA\u2019s Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award, with Gardner Dozois, \u201cto honor their editing careers in support of science fiction and fantasy.\u201d\n Williams has coedited many anthologies, the bulk of them collecting stories from Asimov\u2019s, starting with Tales from Isaac Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine in 1986 with Cynthia Manson, and including a long line of themed books with Gardner Dozois, such as 1999\u2019s Isaac Asimov\u2019s Werewolves. She edited Why I Left Harry\u2019s All Night Hamburgers and Other Stories in 1990 with Charles Ardai and A Woman\u2019s Liberation: A Choice of Futures By and About Women in 2001 with Connie Willis.\n Solo projects include Hugo and Nebula Award Winners from Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction in 1995, Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction: 30th Anniversary Anthology in 2007, and Enter a Future: Fantastic Tales from Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction in 2010.\n Most recently, she\u2019s spent time helping to arrange poetry readings for high school students at a local Barnes & Noble. \u201cSome of the kids are nervous,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut I think they all benefit from having a real author\u2019s reading experience. It\u2019s wonderful to see how supportive they are of each other.\u201d\n You once told me, \u201cI love dinosaur stories!\u201d Are there certain elements or aspects or things that the stories you love the most have in common? Or does it vary greatly depending on the story?\n I love many different kinds of stories. I do love dinosaur stories, but I also use the word as a metaphor. The \u201cdinosaur\u201d represents the fantastic element, be it scientific, surreal, or supernatural. I\u2019ve read many New Yorker stories, but they don\u2019t tend to be among my favorites. (There are exceptions, but these tend to be tales like George Saunders\u2019 \u201cEscape from Spiderhead.\u201d) A story about a bad marriage, or a pedestrian neighborhood, or a claustrophobic social scene, usually needs an additional fantastic component to resonate with me. An example of this is Dale Bailey\u2019s \u201cMating Habits of the Late Cretaceous.\u201d This perfect story has everything\u2014a disintegrating marriage and depression, but also time travel and dinosaurs! My favorite stories tend to be told on multiple levels, but they are all different.\n Since you took over Asimov\u2019s in 2004, do you feel like there are specific things about your taste in stories that have changed?\n I\u2019ve always been open to the next new idea, the next new type of story. It\u2019s not so much that my tastes have changed as it is that authors and their fiction are influenced by their perspectives and by changing events. New authors bring new ideas. There\u2019s a deeper appreciation of the diverse backgrounds today\u2019s authors bring to the field. Authors are introducing a host of fresh ideas, new storytelling techniques, new characters, new worlds.\n I\u2019m enjoying all of it. I loved what I was buying in 2004, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be buying the exact same material sixteen years later. Even the authors who were being published in 2004 have grown and changed, and their fiction has evolved as well. My November/December holiday cover story by Sam Schreiber (\u201cChristmas at the Hilbert Astoria\u201d) is probably a bit zanier than something I might have published in 2005, but it contains a lot of complex math and physics and pairs well with my new Christmas story from Connie Willis (\u201cTake a Look at the Five and Ten\u201d). The issue also has stories by Alaya Dawn Johnson, Chen Qiufan, Julie Novakova, and lots of other recognizable names. No two are alike!\n Even before you took over Asimov\u2019s you had been at Analog for a number of years, and you are part of a science fiction legacy. Do you feel like genre definitions are important, are they relevant? And how do you feel about horror or dark fantasy?\n I think it\u2019s still important that there is a form of literature that explores the effects of science and technology on our culture and looks to their effects on the future. This is a rich vein that continually gives to authors as new advancements and discoveries occur in the STEM disciplines. It is the sort of fiction that I wanted for Entanglements. Entanglements may be the first book in the Twelve Tomorrows series to address a specific theme, but all the fiction in these books has been hard science fiction. I publish stories like this in Asimov\u2019s, but I\u2019m also delighted when the lines between science fiction and fantasy and horror blur. There is a lot of room for experimentation and the blending of ideas among these related fields.\n How did the Entanglements project come about; how did it develop, and why \u201cEntanglements\u201d as a specific theme?\n Susan Buckley, an acquisitions editor at MIT Press, contacted me late in November 2018 to inquire if I\u2019d be interested in editing the 2020 edition of Twelve Tomorrows. This was to be the first edition with a specific theme. She and Gideon Lichfield of MIT Technology Review had already discussed some options for the theme, but they wanted to reach the final decision with me. I thought the effect of new technology on human relationships was both an intriguing theme and one that was broad enough that authors could approach it in myriad ways.\n Did the book turn out pretty much how you\u2019d initially envisioned it? Or are there important differences between initial concept and final product?\n The final book is full of surprises, but in the quality of writing and diversity of ideas, it\u2019s exactly what I was hoping for. There\u2019s a range in story length and tone. This range happened organically, but it\u2019s an essential element of an interesting collection of tales.\n What was the editorial process like in terms of story selection and/or ToC development?\n I submitted a list of twelve to fifteen authors who I knew were capable of tackling Entanglements\u2019 themes in creative ways. A few authors fell off the list because my editors preferred not to have any overlap with authors who had appeared in the 2018 volume of Twelve Tomorrows. A few of the remaining authors were busy with other obligations. This left me with eight authors from the original list. I suggested a couple of new names and Gideon and Susan also made some recommendations. I was extremely happy with the final table of contents.\n There were other important aspects that went into the book\u2019s development. I enjoyed working with Xia Jia on her thrilling tale, which was translated from Chinese by Ken Liu. Working closely with both authors gave me deeper insights into \u201cThe Monk of Lingyin Temple.\u201d\n I had a lot of fun going through loads of art with Susan. Tatiana Plakhova\u2019s work is stunning, thoughtful, and full of entangled connections. I was really pleased that she agreed to be a part of Entanglements.\n Personally, one very satisfying aspect of this book was having the opportunity to choose a distinguished science fiction author to profile or interview. Other volumes of TT have featured Neal Stephenson, Samuel R. Delany, and Gene Wolfe. I knew immediately that the author I wanted to fill this role was Nancy Kress. Lisa Yaszek, a professor of science fiction studies at Georgia Tech, whose work I\u2019ve followed for some time, was an excellent interviewer. I felt very lucky that Nancy agreed to write \u201cInvisible People\u201d for the book as well.\n Were there stories you really liked that didn\u2019t make it into final selection for one reason or another?\n No. This wasn\u2019t an open call for submissions. One author sent two stories and I had a very strong preference for one over the other. Another author offered me a couple of different story scenarios. Both would have been fascinating, but sadly I could only choose one. I did ask for some rewrites and clarifications, but I was very happy with the quality of the material that I received.\n In the Introduction you wrote, \u201cThe book\u2019s ten fiction authors were asked to write tales about the emotional bonds that hold us together. They had a broad canvas.\u201d What are the advantages to giving authors a broad canvas to work with, and are there also potential disadvantages?\n I was afraid that a narrow theme would result in stories that were too similar to each other. A broad theme ensures that that there will be a variety of perspectives. Yet, there were some very interesting, and narrower, themes that I didn\u2019t choose. I\u2019d love to revisit some of these and figure out strategies for making them work.\n If someone will read only one story to see if the book is for them, which story would you tell them to read\u2014and why?\n One strong feature of an anthology is the range of material. Some stories will appeal to you. Different stories may appeal to someone else. \u201cSparklybits,\u201d Nick Wolven\u2019s complicated tale about parenting dynamics, tools for virtual education, and concerns about screen time may be the best story for one reader. \u201cYour Boyfriend Experience,\u201d James Patrick Kelly\u2019s story about a sexbot developer, his boyfriend, and the sexbot may be someone else\u2019s favorite. \u201cThe Monogamy Hormone,\u201d Annalee Newitz\u2019s often very amusing story about a woman trying to choose between two lovers should charm almost everyone.\n Science fiction can challenge readers in different ways. Which story in the anthology challenges the reader the most?\n Sam J. Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Nation of the Sick\u201d may be the most challenging. There are a million ideas coming at the reader. As we are getting our mind around iterative modeling and floating fungitecture, our understanding of two brothers\u2019 complex relationship also becomes clearer. The epistolary storytelling technique eventually yields the entire picture, but getting there is a great ride.\n Science fiction can also be about innovative ideas. When you think about the book from this angle, which stories come to mind?\n In addition to technology and ideas mentioned elsewhere here are a few: \u201cMediation,\u201d Cadwell Turnbull\u2019s deeply moving story about grief and an AI family therapist; \u201cDon\u2019t Mind Me,\u201d Suzanne Palmer\u2019s chilling look at a child-lock device that conveys ultimate parental control; \u201cThe Monogamy Hormone,\u201d with Annalee Newitz\u2019s walls painted with bacterial slime to help build the immune system of elementary students; and Mary Robinette Kowal\u2019s robot service animals in \u201cA Little Wisdom\u201d are great examples of innovative ideas about technology\u2019s future effects on all of us.\n If you weren\u2019t collecting these pieces for Entanglements, would you have potentially published them in Asimov\u2019s?\n Each of these stories could have been published in Asimov\u2019s, although not in the same issue, as the issues aren\u2019t thematic. There\u2019s a brief graphic scene in Rich Larson\u2019s story that might have caused me to waver about whether it was right for Asimov\u2019s. Still, the characters are so humanely drawn and the mix of humor and pathos work so well that there\u2019s a good chance I would have ultimately decided to take it for the magazine.\n You\u2019ve edited a number of anthologies before, but the bulk of them are related to Asimov\u2019s. Do you plan to do more anthologies completely separately from the magazine?\n Working on this original anthology was challenging and fun. I\u2019d love to do more books like this if the opportunity comes along.\n Arley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

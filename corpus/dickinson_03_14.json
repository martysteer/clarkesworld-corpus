On Earth, Mars, the moons of Jupiter, the sun wants you but it cannot have you: you slip sideways fast enough to miss. This is the truth of orbit, a hand-me-down birthright of velocity between your world and the fire. You never think about it.\nUnless you want to fall. Then you need to strip all that speed away. Navigators call it killing your velocity (killing again: Laporte\u2019s not sure whether this is any kind of funny). It takes more thrust to fall into the sun than to escape out to the stars.\nIndus made a blind jump, fleeing the carnage, exit velocity uncertain.\nAnd here they are. Falling.\nThey are the last of Indus\u2019 pilots and there is nothing left to fly, so Laporte and Simms sit in the empty briefing room and play caps. The ship groans around them, ruined hull protesting the efforts of the damage control crews\u2014racing to revive engines and jump drive before CME radiation sleets through tattered armor and kills everyone on board.\n\u201cWhat do you think our dosage is?\u201d Laporte asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Left my badge in my bunk.\u201d Simms rakes her sweat-soaked hair, selects a cap, and antes. Red emergency light on her collarbone, on the delta of muscle there. \u201cSaw a whole damage control party asleep in the number two causeway. Radiation fatigue.\u201d\n\u201cSo fast? That\u2019s bad, boss.\u201d Laporte watches her Captain, pale lanky daughter of Marineris sprawled across three seats in the half-shed tangle of her flight suit, and makes a fearful search for damage. Radiation poisoning, or worse. A deeper sort of wound.\nIn the beginning Simms was broken and Laporte saved her, a truth Simms has never acknowledged but must must know. And she saved Laporte in turn, by ferocity, by hate, by being the avatar of everything Laporte didn\u2019t know.\nAnd here in the sunglare Laporte is afraid that the saving\u2019s been undone. Not that it should matter, this concern of hearts, when they\u2019ll all be dead so soon\u2014but\u2014\n\u201cHey,\u201d Laporte says, catching on. \u201cYou sneak, boss. I call bullshit.\u201d\n\u201cGot me.\u201d Simms pushes the bottlecap (ARD/AE-002 ANTI RADIATION, it says) across. A little tremble in her fingers. Not so severe. \u201cThey\u2019re all too busy to sleep.\u201d\nThe caps game is an Ubuntu game, a children\u2019s game, a kill-time game, an I\u2019m-afraid game. Say something, truth or lie. See if your friends call it right.\nIt teaches you to see other people. Martin Mandho, during a childhood visit, told her that. This is why it\u2019s so popular in the military. Discipline and killing require dehumanization. The caps game lets soldiers reclaim shared subjectivity.\n\u201cYour go, Morrigan,\u201d Simms says, shuffling her pile of ARD/AE-002 caps. The callsign might be a habit, might be a reminder: we\u2019re still soldiers.\n\u201cI was in CIC. Think I saw Captain Sorensen tearing up over a picture of Captain Kyrematen.\u201d Yangtze\u2019s skipper, Sorensen\u2019s comrade. Lost.\nSimms\u2019 face armors up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about anything that just happened.\u201d\n\u201cIs that a call?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Of course it\u2019s true.\u201d\nLaporte wants to stand up and say: fuck this. Fuck this stupid game, fuck the rank insignia, fuck the rules. We\u2019re falling into the sun, there\u2019s no rescue coming. Boss, I\u2014\nBut what would she say? It\u2019s not as simple as the obvious thing (and boy, it\u2019s obvious), not about lust or discipline or loyalty. Bigger than that, truer than that, full of guilt and fire and salvation, because what she really wants to say is something about\u2014\nAbout how Simms is\u2014important, right, but that\u2019s not it. That\u2019s not big enough.\nLaporte can\u2019t get her tongue around it. She doesn\u2019t know how to say it.\nSimms closes her eyes for a moment. In the near distance, another radiation alarm joins the threnody.\nThings Laporte already knows how to say\u2014\nI\u2019m going to kill that one, yes, I killed him. Say it like this:\nMorrigan, tally bandit. Knife advantage, have pure, pressing now.\nGuns guns guns.\nAnd the ship in her sights, silver-dart Atalanta built under some other star by hands not unlike her own, the fighter and its avionics and torch and weapons and its desperate skew as it tries to break clear, the pilot too\u2014they all come apart under the coilgun hammer. The pilot too.\nBlossoming shrapnel. Spill of fusion fire. Behold Laporte, starmaker. (Some of the color in the flame is human tissue, atomizing.)\nShe made her first kill during the fall of Jupiter, covering Third Fleet\u2019s retreat. Sometimes rookies fall apart after their first, eaten up by guilt. Laporte\u2019s seen this. But the cry-scream-puke cycle never hits her, even though she\u2019s been afraid of her own compassion, even though her callsign was almost Flower Girl.\nInstead she feels high.\nThere\u2019s an Ubuntu counselor waiting on the Solaris, prepared to debrief and support pilots with post-kill trauma. She waves him away. Twenty years of Ubuntu education, cherish all life hammered into the metal of her. All meaningless, all wasted.\nThat high says: born killer.\nShe was still flying off the Solaris here, Kassim on her wing. Still hadn\u2019t met Simms yet.\nWho is Lorna Simms? Noemi Laporte thinks about this, puzzles and probes, and sometimes it\u2019s a joy, and sometimes it hurts. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t think about it at all\u2014mostly when she\u2019s with Simms, flying, killing.\nMaybe that\u2019s who Simms is. The moment. A place where Laporte never has to think, never has a chance to reflect, never has to be anything other than laughter and kill-joy. But that\u2019s a selfish way to go at it, isn\u2019t it? Simms is her own woman, impatient, profane, ferocious, and Laporte shouldn\u2019t make an icon of her. She\u2019s not a lion, not a war-god, not some kind of oblivion Laporte can curl up inside.\nA conversation they have, after a sortie, long after they saved each other:\n\u201cYou flew like shit today, Morrigan.\u201d\n\u201cThat so, boss?\u201d\nSquared off in the shower queue, breathing the fear stink of pilots and Indus crew all waiting for cold water. Simms a pylon in the crowd and dark little Laporte feels like the raven roosting on her.\n\u201cYou got sloppy on your e-poles,\u201d Simms says. \u201cSlipped into the threat envelope twice.\u201d\n\u201cI went in to finish the kill, sir. Calculated risk.\u201d\n\u201cNot much good if you don\u2019t live to brag about it.\u201d\n\u201cYet here I am, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll spend two hours in the helmet running poles and drags before I let you fly again.\u201d Simms puts a little crack of authority on the end of the reprimand, and then grimaces like she\u2019s just noticed the smell. \u201cFlight Lieutenant Levi assures me that they were good kills, though.\u201d\nLaporte is pretty sure Simms hasn\u2019t spoken to Levi since preflight. She grins toothsomely at her Captain, and Simms, exasperated, grinning back though (!), shakes her head and sighs.\n\u201cYou love it, don\u2019t you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re happy out there.\u201d\nLaporte puts her hands on the back of her head, an improper attitude towards a superior officer, and holds the grin. \u201cI\u2019m coming for you, sir.\u201d\nShe\u2019s racing Simms for the top of the Second Fleet kill board. They both know who\u2019s going to win.\nI\u2019m in trouble. Say it like this:\nBoss, Morrigan, engaged defensive, bandit my six on plane, has pure.\nAnd Simms\u2019 voice flat and clear on the tactical channel, so unburdened by tone or technology that it just comes off like clean truth, an easy promise on a calm day, impossible not to trust:\nBreak high, Morrigan. I\u2019ve got you.\nThere\u2019s a little spark deep down there under the calm, an ember of rage or glee. It\u2019s the first thing Laporte ever knew about Simms, even before her name.\nLaporte had a friend and wingman, Kassim. He killed a few people, clean ship-to-ship kills, and afterwards he\u2019d come back to the Solaris with Laporte and they\u2019d drink and shout and chase women until the next mission.\nBut he broke. Sectioned out. A psychological casualty: cry-scream-puke.\nWhy? Why Kassim, why not Laporte? She\u2019s got a theory. Kassim used to talk about why the war started, how it would end, who was right, who was wrong. And, fuck, who can blame him? Ubuntu was supposed to breed a better class of human, meticulously empathic, selflessly rational.\nCare for those you kill. Mourn them. They are human too, and no less afraid.\nHow could you think like that and then pull the trigger, ride the burst, guns guns guns and boom, scratch bandit, good kill? So Laporte gave up on empathy and let herself ride the murder-kick. She hated herself for it. But at least she didn\u2019t break.\nToo many people are breaking. The whole Federation is getting its ass kicked.\nAfter Kassim sectioned out, Laporte put in for a transfer to the frigate Indus, right out on the bleeding edge. She\u2019d barely met Captain Simms, barely knew her. But she\u2019d heard Simms on FLEETTAC, heard the exultation and the fury in her voice as she led her squadron during the Meridian ambush and the defense of Rheza Station.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a suicide posting,\u201d Captain Telfer warned her. \u201cThe Indus eats new pilots and shits ash.\u201d\nBut Simms\u2019 voice said: I know how to live with this. I know how to love it.\nI\u2019m with you, Captain Simms. I\u2019ll watch over you while you go ahead and make the kill. Say it like this:\nBoss, Morrigan, tally, visual. Press!\nThat\u2019s all it takes. A fighter pilot\u2019s brevity code is a strict, demanding form: say as much as you can with as few words as possible, while you\u2019re terrified and angry and you weigh nine times as much as you should.\nLike weaponized poetry, except that deep down your poem always says we have to live. They have to die.\nFor all their time together on the Indus, Laporte has probably spoken more brevity code to Simms than anything else.\nPeople from Earth aren\u2019t supposed to be very good at killing.\nNoemi Laporte, callsign Morrigan, grew up in a sealed peace. The firewall defense that saved the solar system from alien annihilation fifty years ago also collapsed the Sol-Serpentis wormhole, leaving the interstellar colonies out in the cold\u2014a fistful of sparks scattered to catch fire or gutter out. Weary, walled in, the people of Sol abandoned starflight and built a cozy nest out of the wreckage: the eudaimonic Federation, democracy underpinned by gentle, simulation-guided Ubuntu philosophy. We have weathered enough strife, Laporte remembers\u2014Martin Mandho, at the podium in Hellas Planitia for the 40th anniversary speech. In the decades to come, we hope to build a community of compassion and pluralism here in Sol, a new model for the state and for the human mind.\nAnd then they came back.\nNot the aliens, oh no no, that\u2019s the heart of it\u2014they\u2019re still out there, enigmatic, vast, xenocidal. And the colonist Alliance, galvanized by imminent annihilation, has to be ready for them.\nReady at any price.\nThese are our terms. An older Laporte, listening to another broadcast: the colonists\u2019 Orestes at the reopened wormhole, when negotiations finally broke down. We must have Sol\u2019s wealth and infrastructure to meet the coming storm. We appealed to your leaders in the spirit of common humanity, but no agreement could be reached.\nThis is a matter of survival. We cannot accept the Federation\u2019s policy of isolation. Necessity demands that we resort to force.\nThat was eighteen months ago.\nA lot of people believe that the whole war\u2019s a problem of communication, fundamentally solvable. Officers in the Solaris\u2019 off-duty salon argue that if only the Federation and the Alliance could just figure out what to say, how to save face and stand down, they could find a joint solution. A way to give the Alliance resources and manpower while preserving the Federation from socioeconomic collapse and the threat of alien extermination. It\u2019s the Ubuntu dream, the human solution.\nCaptain Simms doesn\u2019t hold to that, though.\nA conversation they had, on the Indus\u2019 observation deck:\n\u201cBut,\u201d Laporte says (she doesn\u2019t remember her words exactly, or what she\u2019s responding to; and anyway, she\u2019s ashamed to remember). \u201cThe Alliance pilots are people too.\u201d\n\u201cStow that shit.\u201d Simms\u2019 voice a thundercrack, unexpected: she\u2019d been across the compartment, speaking to Levi. \u201cI won\u2019t have poison on my ship.\u201d\nThe habit of a lifetime and the hurt of a moment conspire against military discipline and Laporte almost makes a protest\u2014Ubuntu says, Martin Mandho said\u2014\nBut Simms is already on her, circling, waiting for the outspoken new transfer to make one more mistake. \u201cWhat\u2019s the least reliable weapons system on your ship, Morrigan?\u201d\nA whole catalogue of options, a bestiary of the Federation\u2019s reluctant innovations\u2014least reliable? Must be the Mulberry GES-2.\n\u201cWrong. It\u2019s you. Pilots introduce milliseconds of unaffordable latency. In a lethal combat environment, hesitation kills.\u201d Simms is talking to everyone now, making an example of Laporte. She sits there stiff and burning waiting for it to be over. \u201cIf the Admiralty had its way, they\u2019d put machines in these cockpits. But until that day, your job is to come as close as you can. Your job is to keep your humanity out of the gears. How do you do that?\u201d\n\u201cHate, sir,\u201d Levi says.\n\u201cHate.\u201d Simms lifts her hands to an invisible throat. Bears down, for emphasis, as her voice drops to a purr. She\u2019s got milspec features, aerodyne chin, surgical cheekbones, and Laporte feels like she\u2019s going to get cut if she stares, but she does. \u201cThere are no people in those ships you kill. They have no lovers, no parents, no home. They were never children and they will never grow old. They invaded your home, and you are going to stop them by killing them all. Is that clear, Laporte?\u201d\nWillful, proud, stupid, maybe thinking that Simms would give her slack on account of that first time they flew together, Laporte says: \u201cThat\u2019s monstrous.\u201d\nSimms puts the ice on her: full-bore all-aspect derision. \u201cIt\u2019s a war. Monsters win.\u201d\nThe Alliance flagship, feared by Federation pilot and admiral alike, is Atreus. Her missile batteries fire GTM-36 Block 2 Eos munitions (memorize that name, pilot. Memorize these capabilities). The Atreus\u2019 dawn-bringers have a fearsome gift: given targeting data, they can perform their own jumps. Strike targets far across the solar system. The euphemism is \u2018over the horizon.\u2019\nLaporte used to wonder about the gun crews who run the Eos batteries. Do they know what they\u2019re shooting at, when they launch a salvo? Do they invent stories to assure each other that the missiles are intended for Vital Military Targets? When they hear about collateral damage, a civilian platform shattered and smashed into Europa\u2019s ice in the name of \u2018shipping denial,\u2019 do they speculate in a guilty hush: was that us?\nMaybe that\u2019s the difference between the Alliance and the Federation, the reason the Alliance is winning. The colonists can live with it.\nShe doesn\u2019t wonder about these things any more, though.\nOne night in the gym the squadron gets to sparring in a round robin and then Laporte\u2019s in the ring with Simms, nervous and half-fixed on quitting until they get into it and slam to the mat, grappling for the arm-bar or the joint lock, and Laporte feels it click: it\u2019s just like the dogfight, like the merge, pacing your strength exactly like riding a turn, waiting for the moment to cut in and shoot.\nShe gets Simms in guard, flips her, puts an elbow in her throat. Feels herself grinning down with the pressure while everyone else circles and hoots: Morrrrrrigan\u2014look at her, she\u2019s on it\u2014\nSimms looks back up at her and there\u2019s this question in her wary wonderful eyes, a little annoyed, a little curious, a little scared: what are you?\nShe rolls her shoulders, lashes her hips, throws Laporte sideways. Laporte\u2019s got no breath and no strength left to spend but she thinks Simms\u2019 just as tapped and the rush feeds her, sends her clawing back for the finish.\nSimms puts her finger up, thumb cocked, before Laporte can reach her. \u201cBang,\u201d she says.\nLaporte falls on her belly. \u201cOof. Aargh.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important that Simms not laugh too hard. She\u2019s got to maintain command presence. She\u2019s been careful about that, since their first sortie.\nYou need help, Captain Simms. Say it like this:\nThis is the first time they flew together, when Laporte saved Simms. It happened because of a letter Laporte received, after her transfer to Indus was approved but before she actually shuttled out to her new post.\nFLEETNET PERSONAL\u2014TAIGA/TARN/NODIS\nFLIGHT LIEUTENANT KAREN NG [YANGTZE]\n//ENSIGN NOEMI LAPORTE [INDUS]\nLaporte:\nJust got word of your transfer. You may remember me from the Nauticus incident. I\u2019m de facto squadron leader aboard Yangtze. Lorna Simms and I go way back.\nAdmiral Netreba is about to select ships for a big joint operation against the Alliance. Two months ago the Indus would have been top of the list, and Simms with it. But they\u2019ve been on the front too long, and the scars are starting to show.\nI hear reports of a 200% casualty rate. Simms and Ehud Levi are the only survivors of the original squadron. I hear that Simms doesn\u2019t give new pilots callsigns, that she won\u2019t let the deck crew paint names on their ships. If she\u2019s going to lose her people, she\u2019d rather not allow them to be people.\nIt\u2019s killing morale. Simms won\u2019t open up to her replacements until they stop dying, and they won\u2019t stop dying until she opens up.\nI want the Indus with us when we make our move, but Netreba won\u2019t pick a sick ship. See if you can get through to Simms.\nRegards,\nKaren Ng\nLaporte takes this shit seriously. When Simms takes her out for a training sortie, a jaunt around the Martian sensor perimeter, she\u2019s got notes slipped into the plastic map pockets on her flightsuit thighs, gleaned from gossip and snippy FLEETNET posts: responds well to confidence and plain talk, rejects overt empathy, accepts professional criticism but will enforce a semblance of military discipline. No pictures, though.\nShe knows she\u2019s overthinking it, but fuck, man, it\u2019s hard not to be nervous. Simms is her new boss, her wartime idol, the woman who might get her killed. Simms is supposed to teach her how to live with\u2014with all this crazy shit. And now it turns out she\u2019s broken too? Is there anyone out here who hasn\u2019t cracked?\nMaybe a little of that disappointment gets into Laporte\u2019s voice. Afterwards, because of the thing that happens next, she can\u2019t remember exactly how she broached it\u2014professional inquiry, officer to superior? Flirtatious breach of discipline? Oafishly direct? But she remembers it going bad, remembers Simms curling around from bemusement to disappointment, probably thinking: great, Solaris is shipping me its discipline cases so I can get them killed.\nThen the Alliance jumps them. Four Nyx, a wolfpack out hunting stragglers. Bone-white metal cast in shark shapes. Shadows on the light of their own fusion stars.\nSimms, her voice a cutting edge, a wing unpinioned, shedding all the weight of death she carries: \u201cMorrigan, Lead, knock it off, knock it off, I see jump flash, bandits two by two.\u201d And then, realizing as Laporte does that they\u2019re not getting clear, that help\u2019s going to be too long coming: \u201cOn my lead, Morrigan, we\u2019re going in. Get your fangs out.\u201d\nAnd Laporte puts it all away. Seals it up, like she\u2019s never been able to before. Just her and the thirty-ton Kentauroi beneath her and the woman on her wing.\nThey hit the merge in a snarl of missile and countermeasure and everything after that blurs in memory, just spills together in a whirl of acceleration daze and coilgun fire until it\u2019s pointless to recall, and what would it mean, anyway? You don\u2019t remember love as a series of acts. You just know: I love her. So it is here. They fought, and it was good. (And damn, yes, she loves Simms, that much has been apparent for a while, but it\u2019s maybe not the kind of love that anyone does anything about, maybe not the kind it\u2019s wise to voice or touch.) She remembers a few calls back and forth, grunted out through the pressure of acceleration. All brevity code, though, and what does that mean outside the moment?\nTwo gunships off Yangtze arrive to save them and the Alliance fighters bug out, down a ship. Laporte comes back to the surface, shaking off the narcosis of the combat trance, and finds herself talking to Simms, Simms talking back.\nSimms is laughing. \u201cThat was good,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was good, Morrigan. Damn!\u201d\nIndus comes off the line less than twelve hours later, yielding her patrol slot to another frigate. Captain Simms takes the chance to drill her new pilots to exhaustion and they begin to loathe her so profoundly they\u2019d all eat a knife just to hear one word of her approval. Admiral Netreba, impressed by Indus\u2019 quick recovery, taps the frigate for his special task force.\nLaporte knows her intervention made a difference. Knows Simms felt the same exhilaration, flying side by side, and maybe she thought: I\u2019ve got to keep this woman alive.\nSimms just needed to believe she could save someone.\nAlliance forces in the Sol theater fall under the command of Admiral Steele, a man with Kinshasa haute-couture looks and winter-still eyes. Sometimes he gives interviews, and sometimes they leak across the divide.\n\u201cOverwhelming violence,\u201d he answers, asked about his methods. \u201cThe strategic application of shock. They\u2019re gentle people, humane, compassionate. Force them into violent retaliation, and they\u2019ll break. The Ubuntu philosophy that shapes their society cannot endure open war.\u201d\n\u201cSome of your critics accuse you of atrocity,\u201d the interviewer says. \u201cIndiscriminate strategic bombing. Targeted killings against members of the civilian government in Sol.\u201d\nSteele puts his hands together, palm to palm, fingers laced, and Laporte would absolutely bet a bottle cap that the sorrow on his face is genuine. \u201cThe faster I end the war,\u201d he says, \u201cthe faster we can stop the killing. My conscience asks me to use every tool available.\u201d\n\u201cSo you believe this is a war worth winning? That the Security Council is right to pursue a military solution to this crisis?\u201d\nSteele\u2019s face gives nothing any human being could read, but Laporte, she senses determination. \u201cThat\u2019s not my call to make,\u201d he says.\nThis happens after the intervention, after Simms teaches Laporte to be a monster (or lets her realize she already was), after they manage the biggest coup of the war\u2014the capture of the Agincourt. Before they fall into the sun, though.\nThey take some leave time, Simms and Laporte and the rest of the Indus pilots, and the Yangtze\u2019s air wing too. Karen Ng has a cabin in Tharsis National Park, on the edge of Mars\u2019 terraformed valleys. Olympus Mons fills the horizon like the lip of a battered pugilist, six-kilometer peak scraping the edge of atmosphere. Like a bridge between where they are and where they fight.\nBarbeque on the shore of Marineris Reservoir. The lake is meltwater from impacted comets, crystalline and still, and Levi won\u2019t swim in it because he swears up and down it\u2019s full of cyanide. They\u2019re out of uniform and Laporte should really not take that as an excuse but, well, discipline issues: she finds Simms, walking the shore.\n\u201cBoss,\u201d she says.\n\u201cLaporte.\u201d No callsign. Simms winds up and hurls a stone. It doesn\u2019t even skip once: hits, pierces, vanishes. The glass of their reflections shatters and reforms. Simms chuckles, a guarded sound, like she\u2019s expecting Laporte to do something worth reprimand, like she\u2019s not sure what she\u2019ll do about it. \u201cBeen on Mars before?\u201d\n\u201cUh, pretty much,\u201d Laporte mumbles, hoping to avoid this conversation: she was at Hellas for Martin Mandho\u2019s speech ten years ago, but she was a snotty teenager, Earthsick, and single-handedly ruined Mom\u2019s plan to see more of the world. \u201cNever with a native guide, though.\u201d\n\u201cTourist girl.\u201d Simms tries skipping again. \u201cFuck!\u201d\n\u201cBoss, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d Laporte finds a flat stone chip, barely weathered, and throws it\u2014but Mars gravity, hey, Mars gravity is a good excuse for that. \u201cMars gravity!\u201d she pleads, while Simms laughs, while Laporte thinks about what a bad idea this is, to let herself listen to that laugh and get drunk. Fleet says: no fraternization.\nThey walk a while.\n\u201cYou really hate them?\u201d Laporte asks, forgetting whatever wit she had planned the instant it hits her tongue.\n\u201cThe colonists? The Alliance?\u201d Simms squints up Olympus-ways, one boot up on a rock. The archetypical laconic pioneer, minus only that awful Mongolian chew everyone here adores. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you go to school?\u201d Ubuntu never found so many ears on hardscrabble Mars. \u201cThey gave it to us every day on Solaris: love them, understand them, regret the killing.\u201d\n\u201cAh, right. \u2018He has a husband,\u2019 I remember, shooting him. \u2018May you find peace,\u2019 I pray, uncaging the seekers.\u201d Simms rolls the rock with her boot, flipping it, spinning it on its axis. \u201cAnd you had this in your head, the first time you made a kill? You cut into the merge and lined up the shot thinking about your shared humanity?\u201d\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Laporte says. A good person would have thought about that, so she\u2019d thought about it. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t stop me.\u201d\nSimms lets the rock fall. It makes a flinty clap. She eyes Laporte. \u201cNo? You weren\u2019t angry? You didn\u2019t hate?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She thinks of Kassim. \u201cIt was so easy for me. I thought I was sick.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Simms says, chewing on that. \u201cWell, can\u2019t speak for you, then. But it helps me to hate them.\u201d\n\u201cHate\u2019s inhumane, though.\u201d Words from a conscience she\u2019s kept buried all these months. \u201cIt perpetuates the cycle.\u201d\n\u201cI wish the universe gave power to the decent. Protection to the humane.\u201d Simms shrugs, in her shoulders, in her lips. \u201cBut I\u2019ve only seen one power stop the violent, and it\u2019s a closer friend to hate.\u201d\nShe\u2019s less coltish down here, like she\u2019s got more time for every motion, like she\u2019s set aside her haste. \u201cHey,\u201d Laporte says, pressing her luck. \u201cWhen I transferred in. You were\u2014in a tough place.\u201d\nSimms holds up a hand to ward her off. \u201cYou can see the ships,\u201d she says.\nMars is a little world with a close horizon and when she looks up Laporte feels like she\u2019s going to lose her balance and fall right off, out past Phobos, into a waiting wolfpack, into the Eos dawnbringers from over the horizon. She takes a step closer to Simms, towards the stanchion that keeps her down.\nHigh up there some warship\u2019s drive flickers.\n\u201cI was pretty sure,\u201d Simms says, \u201cthat everyone I knew was going to die, and that I couldn\u2019t stop it. That\u2019s where I was, when you transferred in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d Laporte asks, still watching the star. It\u2019s a lot further away, a lot safer.\n\u201cJury\u2019s out,\u201d Simms says. Laporte\u2019s too skittish to check whether she\u2019s joking. \u201cLook. Moonsrise. You\u2019ve got to tell me a secret.\u201d\n\u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d\n\u201cNative guide,\u201d Simms says, rather smugly.\n\u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d Laporte says, \u201cI had an invisible friend named Ken. He told me I had to watch the ants in the yard go to war, the red ants and the black ones, and that I had to choose one side to win. He said it was the way of things. I got a garden hose and I\u2014I took him really seriously\u2014\u201d\nSimms starts cracking up. \u201cYou\u2019re a loon,\u201d she chokes. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re on my side.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder what we\u2019ll do after this,\u201d Laporte says.\nSimms sobers up. \u201cDon\u2019t think about that. It\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\nLaporte listens to the flight data record of that training sortie, the tangle with the Nyx wolfpack, just to warm her hands on that fire, to tremble at the inarticulate beauty of the fight:\n\u201c\u2014am spiked, am spiked, music up. Bandit my seven high, fifteen hundred, aspect attack.\u201d\n\u201cLead supporting.\u201d The record is full of warbling alarms, the voices of a ship trying to articulate every kind of danger. \u201cAnchor your turn at, uh\u2014fuck it, just break low, break low. Padlocking\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKill him, boss\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGuns.\u201d A low, smooth exhalation, Simms breathing out on the trigger. \u201cGuns.\u201d\n\u201cNice. Good kill. Bandit your nine low\u2014break left\u2014\u201d\nEverything\u2019s so clear. So true. Flying with Simms, there\u2019s no confusion.\nThey respond to a distress call from a civilian vessel suffering catastrophic reactor failure. Indus jumps on-scene to find an Alliance corvette, Arethusa, already providing aid to the civilian. Both sides launch fighters, slam down curtains of jamming over long-range communications, and prepare to attack.\nBut neither of them have enough gear to save the civilian ship\u2014the colonists don\u2019t have the medical suite for all her casualties; Indus can\u2019t provide enough gear to stabilize her reactor. Captain Sorensen negotiates a truce with the Arethusa\u2019s commander.\nLaporte circles Indus, flying wary patrol, her fingers on the master arm switch. Some of the other pilots talk to the colonists on GUARD. They talk back, their accents skewed by fifty years of linguistic drift, their humanity still plain. One of the enemy pilots, callsign Anansi, asks for her by name: there\u2019s a bounty on her head, an Enemy Ace Incentive, and smartass Anansi wants to talk to her and live to tell. She mutes the channel.\nWhen she stops and thinks about it, she doesn\u2019t really believe this war is necessary. So it\u2019s quit, or\u2014don\u2019t think about it. That\u2019s what Simms taught her: you go in light. You throw away everything about yourself that doesn\u2019t help you kill. Strip down, sharpen up. Weaponize your soul.\nAnother Federation frigate, Hesperia, picks up the distress signal, picks up the jamming, assumes the worst. She has no way to know about the truce. When she jumps in she opens Arethusa\u2019s belly with her first salvo and everything goes back to being simple.\nLaporte gets Anansi, she\u2019s pretty sure.\nFresh off the Agincourt coup, they make a play for the Carthage\u2014Indus, Yangtze, Altan Orde, Katana, and Simms riding herd on three full squadrons. It\u2019s a trap. Steele\u2019s been keeping his favorite piece, the hunter-killer Imperieuse, in the back row. She makes a shock jump, spinal guns hungry.\nEveryone dies.\nThe last thing Laporte hears before she makes a crash-landing on Indus\u2019 deck is Captain Simms, calling out to Karen Ng, begging her to abandon Yangtze, begging her to live. But Karen won\u2019t leave her ship.\nIndus jumps blind, destination unplotted, exit vector unknown. The crash transition wrecks her hangar deck, shatters her escape pods in their mounts.\nShe falls into light.\nSo Laporte was wrong, in the end. The death of everyone Simms knew was inevitable.\nMonsters win.\nLaporte stacks her bottlecaps and waits for Simms to offer her a word.\nThe game is just a way to pass the time. Not real speech, not like the chatter, like the brevity code. Out there they could talk. And is that why they\u2019re alive, just the two of them? Even Levi, old hand Levi, came apart at the end, first in his head when he saw the bodies spilling out of Altan Orde and then in his cockpit when the guns found him. But Simms and Laporte, they flew each other home. Home to die in this empty searing room with the bolted-down frame chairs and the bottle caps and their cells rotting inside them.\nOr maybe it\u2019s just that Simms hated harder than anyone else, hesitated the least. And Laporte, well\u2014she\u2019s never hesitated at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault we\u2019re here,\u201d Laporte says, even though it\u2019s not her turn.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Simms, she\u2019s got red in her eyes, a tremor in her frame.\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t listened to Karen\u2019s note, if I hadn\u2019t done whatever I did to wake you up.\u201d If they\u2019d never met. \u201cNetreba never would\u2019ve picked Indus for the task force. We wouldn\u2019t have been at the ambush. Wouldn\u2019t have watched Imperieuse kill our friends.\u201d\n\u201cAll you did was fly my wing,\u201d Simms says. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d But she knows exactly what Laporte\u2019s talking about.\nSimms picks up a bottle cap and puts it between them. \u201cI\u2019m transferring you to Eris,\u201d she says. \u201cNetreba\u2019s flagship. On track for a squadron command.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d Because they\u2019re not going to live long enough to transfer anywhere.\nSimms wraps the cap up in her shaking hand and draws it back. \u201cI already put the order in,\u201d she says. \u201cJust in case.\u201d\nA dosage alarm shrieks and stops: someone from damage control, silencing the obvious. Beams of ionizing radiation piercing the torn armor, arcing through the crew spaces as Indus tumbles and falls.\nIs this the time to just give up on protocol? To get her boss by the wrists and beg: wait, stop, please, let me explain, let me stay? We\u2019ll make it, rescue will come, we\u2019ll fly again? But she gets it. She\u2019s got that Ubuntu empathy bug. She can feel it in Simms, the old break splintering again: I can\u2019t watch these people die.\nLaporte\u2019s the only people she\u2019s got left. So Simms has to send her away.\n\u201cBoss,\u201d she says. \u201cYou taught me\u2014without you I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nKilling, it\u2019s like falling into the sun: you\u2019ve got all this compassion, all this goodwill, keeping you in the human orbit. All that civilization that everyone before you worked to build. And somehow you\u2019ve got to lose it all.\nOnly Laporte never\u2014\n\u201cWithout me,\u201d Simms says, and she\u2019s got no mercy left in her tongue, \u201cyou\u2019d be fine. You\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re a killer. That\u2019s all you need\u2014no reasons, no hate. It\u2019s just you.\u201d\nShe lets her head loll back and exhales hard. The lines of her arched throat kink and smooth.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d\nLaporte opens her hand. Asking for the cap. She doesn\u2019t have the spit to say: true.\nCaptain Simms makes herself comfortable, flat on her back across three chairs. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBoss,\u201d Laporte rasps. \u201cFuck. Excuse me.\u201d She clears her throat. Might as well go for it: it begs to be said. \u201cBoss, I . . . \u201d\nBut Simms has gone. She\u2019s asleep, breathing hard. It\u2019s lethargy, the radiation pulling her down. Giving her some peace.\nLaporte calls a medical team. While she waits she tries to find a blanket, but Simms seems to prefer an uneasy rest. She breathes a little easier when Laporte touches her shoulder, though, and Laporte thinks about clasping her hand.\nBut, no, that\u2019s too much.\nFederation ships find them. A black ops frigate, running signals intelligence in deep orbit, picks Indus\u2019 distress cries from the solar background. Salvage teams scramble to make her ready for one last jump to salvation.\nLaporte\u2019s waiting by her Captain\u2019s side when they come for her. The medical team, and the woman with the steel eyes.\n\u201cLaporte,\u201d the new woman says. \u201cThe Indus ace. Came looking for you.\u201d\nBy instinct and inclination Laporte stands to shield her Captain from the grey-clad woman, from her absent insignia and hidden rank. She can\u2019t figure out a graceful way to drop the bottle cap so she just holds it like a switch for some hidden explosive, for the grief that wants to get out any way it can. \u201cI need to stay with my squadron leader,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m reading this order right,\u201d Steel Eyes says, though she\u2019s got no paper or tablet and the light on her iris makes little crawling signs, \u201cshe\u2019s shipping you out.\u201d She opens a glove in invitation. \u201cI\u2019m with Federation wetwork. Elite of the elite. I\u2019m recruiting pilots for ugly jobs.\u201d\nLaporte hesitates. She wants to stay, wants it like nothing she knows how to tell. But Steel Eyes stares her down and her gaze cuts deep. \u201cI know you like you wouldn\u2019t begin to believe,\u201d she says. \u201cI watched you learn what you are. We don\u2019t have many of your kind left here in Sol. We made ourselves too good. And it\u2019s killing us.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Laporte croaks. \u201cI can\u2019t leave her.\u201d\nThe woman from the eclipse depths of Federation intelligence extends her open hand. A gesture of compassion, though she\u2019s wearing tactical gloves. \u201cWhat do you think happens if you stay? You\u2019re not going to stop changing, Noemi. You\u2019re never going back to humanity.\u201d\nShe sighs a little, not a hesitation, maybe an apology. \u201cThis woman, here, this loyalty you have. You\u2019re going to be an alien to her.\u201d\nLaporte doesn\u2019t know how to argue with that. Doesn\u2019t know how to speak her defiance. Maybe because Steel Eyes is right.\n\u201cUbuntu,\u201d the woman says, \u201cis a philosophy of human development. We have a use for everyone. Even, in times like these, for us monsters.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s she got left? What the fuck else is there? She gave it all up to become a better killer. Humanity\u2019s just dead weight on her trigger.\nNothing but Simms and wreckage in the poison sunlight.\n\u201cYou know we\u2019re losing,\u201d Steel Eyes says. \u201cYou know we need you.\u201d\nAh. That\u2019s it. The thing she\u2019s been trying to say:\nMonsters kill because they like it, and that\u2019s all Laporte had. Until this new thing, this fragile human thing, until Simms.\nSomething worth fighting for. A small, stupid, precious reason.\nLaporte gets down on her knees. Puts herself as close to the salt sand cap of Simms\u2019 hair as she\u2019s ever been. Says it, the best way she knows, promising her, promising herself:\n\u201cBoss,\u201d she whispers. \u201cHey. I\u2019ll see you when we win.\u201d\nFor Darius and the Blue Planet crew.\nSeth Dickinson is the author of The Traitor Baru Cormorant and a lot of short stories, including \"Morrigan in the Sunglare\", this story's antecedent.

Behind him is the unharmed research center building. Overhead the brilliant fireworks of the bomb he had heaved into the sky light up the scene, the sparks drifting down over his shoulders like confetti.\nHe could have tossed the bomb into the river, of course, but this makes for better TV. This is why I\u2019ve taken to calling him Showboat, which happens to also work well with the soaring \u201cS\u201d on his chest.\n\u201cWhat do you have to say to her?\u201d some reporter shouts.\n\u201cVillainy doesn\u2019t pay,\u201d he says, like some baseball player with a repertoire of a dozen clich\u00e9s that will play well for any purpose. Don\u2019t be evil. Surrender and face a fair trial. The American people will not tolerate terrorism. Open your heart to the goodness around you.\nI flick off the TV. He had probably figured out my plans with the city\u2019s help. With thousands of surveillance cameras everywhere these days, it\u2019s almost inevitable that my image was captured by some of them. Computers and his super-vision would have done the rest. He does believe in at least one form of anticipatory knowledge then, the kind that concerns me.\nI\u2019ll keep on trying, though I\u2019ll need a better disguise.\nThe apartment is well appointed, comfortable. The man who owns this place won\u2019t be back until tomorrow morning; I\u2019ll be safe here. I fall asleep almost immediately after a long day of crawling through ventilation ducts and utility crawlspaces carrying explosives.\nI dream about the building I failed to blow up, about the humming servers and cluttered labs I saw, about the knowledge that is stored within, about automated drones sweeping across the sky, over a busy market, over a remote hamlet, raining death upon the people below implacably. I feel the terror of the man through whose eyes I see these things, and the knowledge that it is wrong, all wrong, and yet also necessary, because war has its own logic, the perennial excuse of cowards trying to evade responsibility.\nBut I am the villain. Right?\nYou want to hear some dark, twisted origin story, some formative experience that explains how I\u2019ve come to be me. That\u2019s what Showboat wants, too. \u201cI feel sorry for her,\u201d he tells the cameras. \u201cNo one is born evil.\u201d I want to throw the remote at the TV every time he says that.\nThe real story is pretty mundane. It started with a search for cool air.\nIt\u2019s summer and there\u2019s no air conditioning in my apartment. Buying a window unit and installing it and figuring out how to pay for the extra electricity\u2014the very thoughts exhaust me. Planning has never been my strong suit. I like to take things one step at a time. It\u2019s why I\u2019m still in the city with no job after college, trying to put off making that phone call to my parents about possibly moving back home. You\u2019re right, Dad; it looks like that degree in literature and history really isn\u2019t so useful.\nSo I go out for ice cream, for cold smoothies, for the cool air in discount stores where they sell everything you desire and nothing you need.\nThere\u2019s a family near the TVs with their color saturation turned up so high that the skin on the white actors look orange. The woman stands next to one of the 72-inch beasts, looking skeptical.\n\u201cI think it might be a bit too big,\u201d she says.\nThe man looks at her, and I see his face go through this weird transformation. It was a handsome face, but now it\u2019s not. It\u2019s like she has just insulted him in some unforgivable manner.\n\u201cI said I like this one,\u201d he says. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m imagining that thing in his tone, the thing that makes the skin on the back of my neck cold, makes me want to cringe.\nShe must be hearing it, too. She tenses, straightens up. One of her hands goes to the TV, leaning on it for support; the other hand reaches down and grabs the hand of her little boy, who\u2019s maybe four and tries to shake her off but she refuses to let him go.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou think our place is too small, is that it?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYou make ten dollars an hour and complain about not getting enough hours, but you think we should be in a bigger place.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says. Her voice gets smaller. The boy has stopped struggling and lets her hold his hand.\n\u201cI guess it must be my fault. I should be working more. That must be what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Look, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI tell you I like this TV and you start this again.\u201d\n\u201cI like the TV.\u201d\nThe man glares at her, and I can see his face grow redder and redder as if he\u2019s still figuring out all the ways she\u2019s insulted him. I realize what a big man he is, how this rage magnifies him, gives him that aura of power. Abruptly, he turns around and heads for the exit.\nThe woman lets out a held breath, as do I.\nShe takes her hand off the TV and starts to follow the man, the boy obediently trailing her. Our eyes meet for a moment and her face flushes, embarrassed.\nI want to say something but don\u2019t. What am I supposed to say? He\u2019s got a temper, doesn\u2019t he? You going to be okay? Is he hitting you? What do I know about the lives of strangers? What do I know about the right thing to do?\nSo I watch as they leave the store, the fog from the air conditioning over the automatic doors enveloping her for a moment as she steps through.\nI go up to the TV they had been looking at, and for some reason that I can\u2019t even explain, put my hand on the TV, put my hand where she put hers earlier. It\u2019s like I\u2019m seeking the lingering trace of the warmth of her hand, some assuring sign that she\u2019ll be all right.\nAnd it feels electric, feels like the moon opens up and the stars are singing to me.\nAn apartment a few tiny rooms the bed the table the kitchen the carpet a mess Damn you\u2019re lazy I\u2019m sorry I was late Teddy was sick had to take him Damn you\u2019re lazy\nA toy piano is like a window a handle on a polished shoe grinding mezzo soprano Daddy is angry He is he is my darling Let\u2019s be quiet\nThe link is with us woman with woman. Your eyes your face It\u2019s nothing Why do you not leave Because So Because\nWhy did you look at him?\nI wasn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t\nLets dance So tender sometimes I\u2019m sorry I was angry forgive me but sometimes you push me\nHe can be so sweet\nA girl is a woman because a woman is an omen Oh man a whole man a hole in a woman a wholesome woman.\nAn awl is a drill some sharply polished nail\nBroken dish a wailing a crying a tantrum Get him to stop! I\u2019m trying I\u2019m trying Damn you\u2019re lazy I\u2019m tired Talking back I told you not to push me Don\u2019t don\u2019t you\u2019re scaring him get away from me\nA burst of crimson of red ink iron sweet\nScreaming and screaming and screaming he\u2019s not stopping Call the police call\nMy first vision leaves me breathless and ill.\nI ask myself questions in an attempt at persuasion: What have I seen? What am I supposed to do with these images? What is their epistemological status? What is the rational reaction?\nSo I plead ignorance and do nothing.\nThen there she is in the news: on TV, on the web, in the stacks of papers they still put in the convenience stores.\nShe was getting ready to leave him. Already found an apartment.\nHe came at her with that awl while their son watched. I couldn\u2019t stop him, and I tried. I tried.\nI show up to the funeral, where lots of strangers have gathered outside the chapel to lay flowers around a fountain. I watch the bubbling water and imagine the blood gushing out of her. Guilt gnaws at my insides like an iron file, but the rest of me feels numb. I catch sight of the boy once, and his stoic eyes stab at me like a pair of awls.\nAnd then he swoops in like some butterfly, dressed in his flowing cape and skintight costume. With his hair slicked back, his square jaw steeled, and his arms akimbo\u2014arms that could bend beams of titanium and hold up a falling airplane\u2014he poses. The cameras flash. Despite my cynical nature, I feel my heart lift up. We all need a hero, especially a superhero.\nHe gives a speech in that familiar baritone. He declares war on domestic violence; he promises to keep his super eye out for signs of trouble; he asks neighbors and friends to see something and say something. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to fear the men in their lives.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t explain how he\u2019s going to accomplish this. Is he going to examine every family in the city? Ferret out the poison from the root of our fucked up culture? Maybe he thinks it\u2019s enough for him to pay attention to the problem, to muscle his way to victory the way he grabbed that burning plane out of the sky, set it down by the shore, and peeled it open like a banana so everyone inside tumbled out and said oh thank you thank you.\nBut really, what right do I have to mock him and his platitudes? I should have done something. I saw what was going to happen.\nHis eyes sweep over the crowd, and our gazes meet for a moment. His eyes linger on my face just a second too long, and I wonder what he sees.\nThe next time it happens I\u2019m about to enter the convenience store.\nThe man comes barging out the door with his head down and eyes on the ground. He doesn\u2019t hold the door open for me and I have to duck out of the way before he runs me over. He gives me a quick glance as he passes by and I see something in his face that makes my heart stop\u2014intense anger at the world, anger at everybody and everything, anger at me.\nI pull the door open, unsettled; an old lady is trying to come out with a bag of bananas and crackers; I put my palm on the inside of the door to hold it open, put it on the spot where the man had slammed his hand a moment earlier.\nA winter a splinter I\u2019m a nice guy ice guy my life is not nice Why don\u2019t you why\nYou owe me you owe me you all owe me\nThe girl who said no the boy who laughed why does he He doesn\u2019t deserve it nobody does and they say I\u2019m the weird one\nA gun\nLook at me look at me look at me you can\u2019t hear me screaming you don\u2019t know how much the silence and an island and a new land and it\u2019s the same the same nothing ever changes\nTwo guns\nI can see you I see all of you cowering terrified shivering shaking trembling leaves that you are should I let you live Why\nI\u2019m a nice guy ice thrice bang bang bang yes oh yes now you wish you were nice\nThree guns\nYou\u2019re supposed to get in touch with him by calling 911. He monitors that. If it\u2019s the kind of emergency that can use his help, he\u2019ll come.\nThis is an emergency, but the police will mock me if I call and maybe charge me for wasting their time. Sure, officer, happy to repeat my story. I followed a man home and got his address because I saw a vision that he was going to go on a mass shooting.\nSo I write to him at his fan club email. I try to keep it vague but promise him IMPORTANT URGENT INFORMATION. I try not to use any capital letters in the rest of the email. To get to the superhero I have to defeat the spam filter first.\nIt\u2019s afternoon and there\u2019s a thundershower. He hovers outside the window and taps the glass lightly. I rush over to open it.\n\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d I say, as though it\u2019s perfectly normal to have a superhero step through my window. \u201cYou must be really busy.\u201d\nHe shrugs and gives me a smile that shows off his perfect teeth. \u201cWhen it rains really hard, the crime rate goes down.\u201d\nIt has never occurred to me that villains, super or otherwise, might have plans derailed by the weather. I suppose it makes sense. Even henchmen don\u2019t like to get wet.\n\u201cI have a crime to report.\u201d\nHe listens to my story, nodding encouragingly from time to time. I tell him about my newfound power and dead Annie, whose funeral he attended, and angry Bobby, who\u2019s going to kill.\nHe looks at me with those eyes that exude practiced kindness. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\nAnd he opens the window and leaps out, as smooth as a fish leaping back into the ocean. I run to the window, my heart so full of happiness that I\u2019m half expecting to see a rainbow. I watch his figure shrink over the rooftops, a blue-and-red angel of justice, truth, and all that is good and worthy.\nI pace around my apartment, unable to remain still for even a minute.\nHe comes back an hour later, tapping on my window. The rain hasn\u2019t let up, and he shakes himself off like a wet dog before alighting gently in my living room.\n\u201cDid you see him?\u201d I ask.\nHe nods but says nothing. I scrutinize his face, and something in me wilts, dies.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a perfectly nice young man,\u201d he says. \u201cAway from home, living on his own for the first time. He\u2019s a bit shy, is all.\u201d\n\u201cBut the guns!\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any guns.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re just really well hidden.\u201d\n\u201cI have X-ray vision.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s going to get them.\u201d I realize that I don\u2019t know anything about the timing of my vision. Maybe Bobby will buy the gun tomorrow, maybe not until twenty years from now.\nI think of Annie\u2019s picture and how she looked embarrassed the only time we looked at each other. I knew something. And I did nothing.\n\u201cYou have to believe me. I saw Annie die.\u201d\nHe sighs and shakes his head. \u201cNobody knows the future.\u201d\n\u201cThey used to think nobody could fly. Or dodge bullets. Or see through walls. Or pluck a burning airplane out of the sky before it crashed.\u201d\nHe looks at me, his face hardening. \u201cThen tell me how I\u2019m going to die.\u201d\nI look at him, my mouth opening and closing wordlessly. Finally, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\nHe nods. \u201cNobody knows the future.\u201d\nI become obsessed with Bobby. I stalk him from a distance, watch his comings and goings, try to piece together his life. I buy directional microphones and long-range zoom lenses. I download manuals written by private detectives and read them late at night.\nI find out just how good my tradecraft is one day on the subway. I follow him onto the platform and get into the same car, at the other end. The train starts to move. He turns, looks me straight in the eyes, and walks over.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been following me around.\u201d\nI try to deny it, but I don\u2019t even have a story ready.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nHis eyes are confused, but his tone is polite.\nI mumble something about living in the same neighborhood and having the same schedule. He asks for my name. He seems ill at ease but not in a way that appears dangerous\u2014though to be honest, how is he supposed to act when he thinks he\u2019s confronting a stalker? We shake hands and tell each other it\u2019s nice to meet you.\nHis hand is warm, damp. I don\u2019t get any visions.\nI ask him to dinner.\nBobby doesn\u2019t know anything about guns. He\u2019s never gotten into a fight. He\u2019s lonely but likes to read and play video games. He\u2019s thinking about becoming vegan. This is the extent of what I find out about him by the end of dinner.\nHe\u2019s awkward but polite. Our conversation doesn\u2019t flow smoothly because he seems to try out everything he says in his head ten times before he says it. Not my type. But dangerous? I can\u2019t see it.\nWe walk back together from the restaurant and stop in front of my building.\nI look at him. He\u2019s nervous and expectant. I comb through our conversation. Nobody knows the future.\nBefore he can ask for a hug or a kiss, I shake his hand and step back, \u201cI\u2019ll see you around the neighborhood.\u201d\nHe looks dejected but not surprised. \u201cWhy did you follow me around if you aren\u2019t interested?\u201d\nI think about how to answer this in a way that is truthful but not too truthful. \u201cBecause I wanted to know if I\u2019m special.\u201d\n\u201cSpecial how?\u201d\nJust then Showboat zooms over us in the evening sky, a patriotic-color-schemed comet. We stare up at him together.\n\u201cA bit like that,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI bet he gets all the girls,\u201d Bobby says. \u201cI bet it\u2019s nice to have that kind of power.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Good night.\u201d\nI try to go on with my life. The visions come more frequently now, are more vivid. I don\u2019t see visions of happy strangers; my gift is for brutal, bloody futures.\nI take to wearing gloves marketed for germaphobes, made of some space age material that\u2019s supposed to be able to breathe while killing germs\u2014pure lies. In fact, they make my hands sweat and the germs probably think of them as Club Med.\nBut they do keep me safe, safe from myself.\nOnce in a while, when I must touch something that hold traces of other hands\u2014a touch screen tablet repurposed for taking credit cards or a restroom faucet\u2014the visions leave me with a headache and palpitating heart.\nThere is a silence in singing, a violence in wringing, a justice and a tenderness and a rustiness in anything sweet and needs no explaining\nThe path all knowing everywhere sharp objects regret dark and thick and tangy as undersea molasses\nHere is your attempt at explication but listen to the sound of sweet sweet sweet wee wee wee like some foundation in a room full of inattention which is death miles and miles of death\nThere is a mention of a tension that is quite an extension of my intention. For a rose is a rose is a rose is a briar a poke at a nose a bloody nose a gory a glory the same as flag waving.\nThen comes the shooting, the bodies, the note left behind by Bobby in which he recounts his years of rejection and rage. My name shows up near the end, the stuck-up girl who thinks she\u2019s special and is obsessed with guns and who comes on to him only to reject him like everyone else. He talks about the desire to experience power, like the man with the red cape and blue tights. He writes about guns and their ability to remake the meek into the mighty, into superheroes. He speaks in the language of vengeance and unstanched wounds bleeding for years.\n\u201cYou\u2019re responsible for this,\u201d he says, his cape looking cheap in the fluorescent light of my apartment.\nI hear in his voice the voice of easy accusation, the pinning of blame upon imagined proximate causes. It\u2019s disappointing to see your heroes fall.\n\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. He has been building up this delusion of rejection and hatred for years. He was just good at hiding it. You should have listened to me. You\u2019re just as responsible.\u201d\n\u201cSophistry,\u201d he says. \u201cYou made the future you claim you saw. That\u2019s your power.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWe make the future together.\u201d\nI suppose I could have just kept the gloves on all the time or moved back to my parents\u2019 house and never emerged, never touched anything that might still hold the heat and sweat from someone else.\nIt\u2019s one thing to be ignorant, but another to refuse to know.\nIf I can see the future but decline to, how am I different from a man passing by a pond and averting his eyes from the drowning child?\nSo I learn to live with the visions, to interpret them, to do what I can to thwart fate. I learn how to filter out the noise and blur and shifting lights, to focus and make sense of what I see and turn it into a scene, a sequence, a narrative. I learn to pay attention to details in the fleeting images: to clocks, to newspapers, to the lengths of shadows and the density of crowds.\nAt the ATM I see money being hidden in a locker in a changing room, a bribe to a woman in charge of something or other. I go to the gym and wait until five minutes after she\u2019s gone. I go in, take the money, and leave.\nI don\u2019t know if that did any good. Maybe she\u2019ll just go back and ask for more, or demand payment from someone else. Maybe whatever she\u2019s being bribed for, she ends up doing anyway. But at least I have money to live on and to devote to my new career.\nThe man emerging from the elevator holds the door open for me.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nHe nods and leaves. I put my hand on the door where his hand had been. I\u2019m compelled to know.\nI see a street corner. A tourist couple with a little daughter.\n\u201cCarla!\u201d the father calls out. \u201cDon\u2019t run so far ahead.\u201d\nShe turns down a narrow alley, in which I\u2019m hiding. The parents follow their daughter in, admonishing her.\nI go up to them and demand their money. I speak in the voice of the man who had held the elevator door open. The father refuses, and I take out my gun. Instead of complying, he lunges at me, trying to disarm me. I squeeze the trigger and he crumples to the ground, his face fixed in disbelief. The woman tries to flee, pulling the little girl behind her, and I shoot her also. Then I stare at the little girl standing next to her dead mother. She doesn\u2019t understand what has happened. She looks back at me, confused.\nWhy not? I think. One more isn\u2019t going to make any difference now.\nI glance down at my watch and make a note of the time.\nI shake off the cold desolation of the killer\u2019s mind. I get into my car and drive, frantically looking for that street corner on the GPS. I have only a few minutes.\nThere he is, loping along on the sidewalk, heading for his destiny. What am I going to do? Tell him I\u2019ve seen him kill? If he backs off today, what about tomorrow, and the day after that? Can fate be so easily averted?\nI ram my car into him as he starts to climb up a hill. A jolt of adrenaline, the pure thrill of thwarting the future.\nThen I spin the wheel and back up, and speed away with screeching tires and the smell of burnt rubber in my nose. As I crest the hill I think I see Carla and her parents, obliviously happy.\nI drive. And drive.\nThat one is simple. Most futures are far more complicated. There\u2019s Alexander, for example, hard working and well meaning.\nFrom a distance, I see him standing at the street corner and mashing the button for the crosswalk impatiently. By the time I arrive at the corner he\u2019s already dashed across and the light has changed.\nI tap the button and am overwhelmed by what I see: he\u2019s working on machines that will massacre a village of old people and children. He doesn\u2019t know it yet and he doesn\u2019t intend to. But it will happen. Intent is not magic.\nHow do I stop him? Could I intervene along the way, use some gentler roadblock to divert him from this future? But there are a thousand visions screaming for my attention, a thousand future victims to save. If I devote all my time to diverting Alexander, I will have also made the choice to let Hal go through with his kidnapping or Liam succeed in strangling his ex-wife.\nWe know what we know. What we do with that knowledge makes the future.\nIn the end, I opt for killing Alexander also. He\u2019s at the corner again, oblivious, a creature of habit with a set routine. I have a new car, a guided missile of future vengeance, or anticipatory justice. I step on the gas.\nI stay where I am.\nI turn around, and he\u2019s there, the red cape whipping in the wind.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou aren\u2019t very good at this, repeating the same modus operandi. But then again, most villains don\u2019t know any better. I\u2019m taking you in.\u201d\nHe rips the top of the car off for dramatic effect. People exclaim in the distance. I hear the sirens of police cars.\nI don\u2019t try to resist. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop him\u201d\u2014I lift my chin in the direction of Alexander\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll have the blood of dozens, maybe hundreds, on your hands.\u201d I sketch my vision for him in a few sentences. \u201cYou could claim ignorance before, but not any more. You know I\u2019m right.\u201d\nAlexander, some distance away, is still trying to recover from the shock of his near encounter with death. He looks like a mild-mannered bureaucrat, his lips moving like a fish\u2019s.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any such thing,\u201d Showboat says.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better,\u201d I plead, \u201cto kill the man long before he got on the plane rather than having to rescue the plane as it plunges toward the ground?\u201d\nHe shakes his head adamantly, confident in his faith, his liberty, his justice, his truth. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to live in a society of pre-crimes.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not as free as we think. There are tendencies, inclinations, forces that compel us\u2014what we call fate.\u201d\n\u201cBut you think you\u2019re free,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think you\u2019re qualified to judge.\u201d\nHe has me in a bind. If I succeed in thwarting the future, then my vision was wrong. If I don\u2019t succeed, then I may be said to be a proximate cause. If I do nothing, I can\u2019t live with myself.\n\u201cIs it so hard to believe someone can look through time as easily as you can through solid walls? Do you really believe it a mere coincidence that what I spoke of came to pass, that I might have been its sole cause?\u201d\nFor a moment, the face of our caped hero shows doubt, but it\u2019s fleeting, and the resolute expression quickly returns like a mask. \u201cEven if you\u2019re right, what makes you think you have seen the whole future? Maybe he\u2019ll also save the lives of dozens of soldiers; maybe his machines will kill a kid who grows up to be a dictator. The future is not knowable until it has become the past. But I just stopped you from murder. I know that. It is enough.\u201d\nI think about my fragmentary visions. What do I really know?\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t stop what you think will happen by killing him,\u201d he tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s just one man out of many others working on the same thing. Fate, if it exists, is resilient.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not entirely wrong, I suppose. I am a time traveler in a sense, and stories about time travelers changing history are often frustratingly stupid. The larger trends of history are rarely dependent on a single individual. Who would you have had to kill to prevent the destruction of the native peoples of the Americas, of Australia, of Hawaii? To stop the Atlantic slave trade? To avoid the mass atrocities of the wars in Indochina and East Asia? You could have killed every named explorer and general and emperor and king in the history books and the currents of colonial conquest probably wouldn\u2019t have shifted by much.\nBut that way lies madness. We\u2019ll never have complete knowledge. I know what I know, but he refuses to learn what he can. That makes all the difference.\nThe police car screeches to a stop nearby. He reaches for my hand to pull me out of the wreck of my car. His hand is warm and dry; it doesn\u2019t feel like the hand of someone who kills by refusing to believe, who takes refuge in the assumed condition of our ignorance, secure in his knowledge.\nA blur that resolves into flashing images. Clarity.\nThrough his eyes, I see him regretting not following me in the squad car to be sure I\u2019m put away; I see him examining the drive-through window of the fast-food restaurant and the bank across the street, where the robbers had emerged, his super-vision picking out the bullet holes in the sidewalk and walls and calculating their trajectories; I see him taking in the site of the shoot-out and clench his jaws; I hear the officers apologizing for rushing to confront the robbers without having secured me properly.\nHis visions are as orderly and predictable as his clich\u00e9s.\nOur hands separate. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he says, that familiar smug smile on his face again. \u201cThe city is safer today with you out of the way.\u201d\nI look out the back window. He can\u2019t resist the cameras. He\u2019s going to give another impromptu press conference. The city\u2019s criminals, say, bank robbers, like to wait until he\u2019s on TV before making their moves.\nPerfect.\nThe car starts to move. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d one of the officers asks the other.\n\u201cI can eat.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d\nI pipe up, \u201cThere\u2019s a Pollo Pollo on Third Avenue, across from the Metropolitan Bank.\u201d\nThe one in the passenger seat turns to look at me.\nI put on a hungry and pleading look. \u201cI have a coupon if you also get me something. My treat.\u201d\nThe officers look at each other and shrug. \u201cAll right. You aren\u2019t going to get a chance to use that coupon for a while.\u201d\n\u201cMy loss. Say, do you work out or is that a bullet-proof vest under the jacket?\u201d\nI train. I learn to shoot, to fight, to become the super villain he already thinks I am.\nIf killing one man is not enough stop all the abusers, to reverse the momentum of culture, to uninvent the machinery of death, to change the currents of history, then I have to kill more.\nI move from the empty apartments of vacationing couples to houses that had just been moved out of and not yet moved in\u2014a touch on the doorknob is enough to tell me the story. I get good and then better at my craft.\nI kill violent boyfriends in their sleep, poison future gunmen over meals, plot the erasure and destruction of clean, dust-free laboratories where they design weapons that kill while minimizing guilt. Sometimes I succeed; sometimes he stops me. He becomes obsessed, the anticipation of my next move haunting him as my visions haunt me.\nI know a little about many things: snippets from people\u2019s futures, paths that will cross and uncross. I can\u2019t see that far into the fog: every action has a consequence, and consequences have other consequences. It\u2019s true that only when the future has become the past can it be seen as a whole and understood, but to do nothing because you don\u2019t know everything is not a path I can follow. I know that a little girl named Carla is alive because of me. It is enough.\nHe and I are not so different, perhaps, just a matter of degrees.\nSo we dance across the city, he and I, antagonists locked in the eternal struggle between the scattered knowledge of fate and the ignorant certainty of free will.\nKen Liu is an American author of speculative fiction.

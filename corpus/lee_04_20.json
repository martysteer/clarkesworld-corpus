Martha\u2019s at work and I\u2019m supposed to be watching you and studying for next month\u2019s quals, so I\u2019m sitting in a plastic lawn chair making a half-hearted attempt to outline Wald\u2019s General Relativity.\n \u201cMommy\u2019s got to study for her test,\u201d I say without looking up. \u201cCan\u2019t you spin yourself?\u201d\n You\u2019re supposed to be playing by yourself. We\u2019d made an agreement. But you\u2019re four and you\u2019re bored and agreements don\u2019t matter.\n \u201cDon\u2019t wanna spin myself.\u201d\n I look up and see the tantrum brewing on your face.\n You\u2019re four years old and it\u2019s a beautiful afternoon and what the hell. I bookmark Wald and get up from my lawn chair. \u201cOkay, kid. You got me. Let\u2019s spin.\u201d Your whole face lights up and I think about quals next month and hope to whomever that I\u2019ve made the right decision.\n You hold up your hands. I walk over to you. I grab your wrists; you grab mine. I lift you up. \u201cOof, kid, you\u2019re getting kinda heavy for this.\u201d\n \u201cSpin me!\u201d you demand, and I do, slowly at first, then faster, faster. Your feet lift off the ground, flying out from us, and you look at me and begin to laugh. It\u2019s the most beautiful thing in the world, that moment, you laughing there in our overgrown backyard in the afternoon sun while the whole universe spins around us.\n I smile, then grin, then I start to laugh, which makes you laugh more, which makes me laugh more. I spin you around and around and I don\u2019t let go.\n When you spin around, your arms fly out to your sides.\n Everyone knows that. But here\u2019s the problem: no one knows why.\n Linear motion\u2014back and forth\u2014is relative. From a physical perspective, you can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re the one moving or if the world is moving around you. Circular motion\u2014orbits, say\u2014is relative as well. But spinning is, for some reason, absolute. If you spin, with your arms flying out to your sides, it seems to you like the whole world spins around you. But if you put every object around you on a circular track, and make them spin around you, your arms don\u2019t fly out to your sides, no matter how fast they spin around.\n That\u2019s not how physics should work. Motion should be relative, not absolute. But no amount of theory can explain it away. Anyone can test it, even you, four years old in our overgrown backyard behind the half-collapsed wooden fence: you spin around; your arms fly out to your sides.\n Einstein theorized that rotation is with respect to \u201cthe distant stars\u201d: When you spin at night the stars spin around above you. That\u2019s how you can tell it\u2019s you spinning and not the room. Einstein called this idea \u201cMach\u2019s principle,\u201d because Einstein knew better than to put his name on a shameless kludge.\n When you spin around, your arms fly out to your sides. No one knows why. One hundred and fifty years ago, we put a name on our ignorance, and we\u2019ve learned absolutely nothing about it since.\n It\u2019s after your bedtime, so Martha and I are fighting again.\n \u201cIt was a good job! Tenure track!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a shit job and I wasn\u2019t going to get it. Do you know who gets tenure track jobs? Straight guys from Princeton named Chet!\u201d\n \u201cOh, so now it\u2019s the patriarchy\u2019s fault?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m just saying that\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit, Sar! Why won\u2019t you take this seriously?\u201d\n \u201cI am taking this seriously!\u201d\n \u201cOh, really? Because I just see you sitting on your ass binging Netflix while I\u2019m working two jobs and raising our son.\u201d\n \u201cThat is not fair! I have been\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t really give a shit what you\u2019ve been doing. I supported you through grad school and you were going to get a job. That was the deal!\u201d\n \u201cIf I could just publish a paper, I mean a real one\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIf you could just publish a paper? You knew that no one was interested in Mach\u2019s principle when you started! Dr. Treuer told you it was a career killer! He used those exact words!\u201d\n \u201cSo now you\u2019re an expert on general relativity?\u201d\n \u201cFuck off, Sarah. If you think I\u2019m going to keep dragging your ass\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just a terrible job market\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s a terrible job market! I give a shit that you can\u2019t even bother to apply. I mean, Jesus Christ, we can\u2019t live like we\u2019re in our 20s anymore. We\u2019ve got bills to pay, a son for God\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not the one who wanted to have a kid while I was applying to grad school!\u201d\n That\u2019s when I see the white tail of your Eevee pajamas sticking out from behind the couch.\n \u201cKid?\u201d I ask in the softest voice I can manage. Caught out, you dash back toward your room. Martha practically deflates and starts crying.\n \u201cSweetie, honey,\u201d I run after you, talk through your door. \u201cHoney, I didn\u2019t mean it like that. I love you so much, I promise.\u201d\n Why should the motion of your arms, spinning around in the light of a backyard afternoon when you were four years old, depend on the motions of galactic clusters ten billion years ago and ten billion years away? It\u2019s infuriating. It\u2019s unreasonable. The universe shouldn\u2019t work like that. And yet, no matter how infuriated or reasonable we get, it still does.\n If you lock some physicists in a spinning room, where we can\u2019t see the distant stars, we shouldn\u2019t be able to tell whether we were in a spinning room or a gravity field. We wouldn\u2019t, if spinning made sense. But we can, because gradually, over time, the spinning will make objects curve away from us. Slowly at first, but accelerating, faster and faster, always further away.\n I\u2019m cramped into our front room with your granddad\u2019s old roller suitcase. I\u2019m dripping with summer sweat and crying and trying to remember what I forgot to pack. I\u2019m not surprised by the divorce\u2014I\u2019m devastated, but at least I\u2019m not surprised.\n Martha is standing in the kitchen door, watching me with her arms crossed, doing her very best not to yell and not to take me back. You\u2019re hiding behind her, nine years old and overwhelmed. I crouch down and meet your eyes.\n \u201cHey, kid,\u201d I say, \u201ccome here and give your mom a hug.\u201d\n Slowly, tentatively, you come out from behind Martha and walk over to me. I hug you tight and you let me.\n \u201cI know this is hard,\u201d I say, as if I\u2019m not the one bawling my eyes out. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just going to be you and Mama for a while.\u201d\n You nod against my shoulder.\n I want to tell you that it\u2019s not my fault. I want to tell you why: that my name isn\u2019t on your birth certificate, or that Martha\u2019s parents got her a better lawyer. I want to tell you that not having custody rights doesn\u2019t mean I love you any less.\n \u201cRemember that I love you,\u201d I finally say. \u201cI love you more than anything, and I promise I\u2019ll see you again soon.\u201d\n You lean over and whisper in my ear. \u201cI love you too, Mom.\u201d\n Martha taps her watch and it takes all I\u2019ve got not to scowl at her. \u201cOkay, kid. Take good care of Mama. See you soon.\u201d\n \u201cSee you soon,\u201d you say, and smile, but I know you don\u2019t mean it.\n Back in the nineteenth century, when physicists didn\u2019t understand something, they called it a principle. Here in the twenty-first century, we call it \u201cDark\u201d: Dark Matter and Dark Energy and Dark whatever they come up with next.\n Dark Energy, particularly, isn\u2019t really dark and isn\u2019t really energy. It\u2019s a way of saying this: we expected, when we looked at distant galaxies, that they\u2019d be moving away from us. But we didn\u2019t expect that they\u2019d be moving away from us faster and faster. Dark Energy means that the entire universe is accelerating away from us. And it means that we have no idea why.\n Or, at least, we had no idea why. Until I got an idea.\n It\u2019s stupid of me to even try. I\u2019m in my fourth year on the job market, not that I\u2019m applying to anything, adjuncting out of a tiny apartment in south Seattle, five different courses at five different colleges for pennies an hour, sending Martha whatever fraction for child support I have at the end of the month. But I\u2019ve finally got an idea, a real one, and I can\u2019t just let it go.\n I title the paper \u201cDark Energy in Non-Inertial Reference Frames.\u201d I don\u2019t even bother submitting it to journals\u2014who was going to take a paper from some failure of an adjunct?\u2014and just upload it directly to arxiv.org.\n No one responds in the first week.\n No one responds in the second week.\n Then, in the third week, I get an e-mail. From an actual professor at an actual university, and not just any university, the UCSB Institute. \u201cFascinating article,\u201d it says, followed by a series of corrections to my tensor models.\n By the time I\u2019m finished reading it, I have five more e-mails. MIT, UChicago, the works. By the time I\u2019m done with those I have a dozen. And then I have a hundred.\n You\u2019re at home\u2014with Martha and her new wife Kyla\u2014and we\u2019re talking on the phone. We usually only talk on the phone on Sundays. Martha doesn\u2019t like it when we talk, no matter what she says otherwise. But it\u2019s a special occasion and I\u2019m calling on a school night.\n \u201cOh, honey, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re graduating high school already. I\u2019m so proud of you. You know how proud of you I am, right?\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d\n \u201cGraduating at 16 is a pretty big deal!\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s really not. Classes are easy. Mom says\u2014\u201d you call Martha \u201cMom\u201d now even though I was always Mom and she was Mama\u2014\u201cthat at least I got my brains from you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d really love to be at your graduation, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d\n \u201cMom! It\u2019s fine!\u201d\n \u201cOr you could come with me! I know it\u2019s late but I can spring for a plane ticket.\u201d\n \u201cMom. We already talked about this. Kyla doesn\u2019t want me to go. She\u2019s worried about the plane.\u201d\n Kyla is worried about a lot of things. I have my suspicions, but I know better than to say anything.\n Finally, I just say, \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you.\u201d\n \u201cMom: I know. It\u2019s okay. Go enjoy the freaking Nobel Prize dinner.\u201d\n After the Nobel Prize, I get a lot of e-mails. Most of it is cranks and I don\u2019t answer. But this morning I\u2019m in a good mood\u2014probably because you just got accepted into the NASA training program\u2014so when I get one of those e-mails I decide to read it.\n \u201cI have been reading your theories with interest,\u201d it begins, \u201cand I think there is a method to test your theories.\u201d It goes on in some detail about gyroscopes and magnets and space-like curves, and I can\u2019t follow it. But it\u2019s signed Wu Hsi-ing, Tsing Hua National University.\n Tsinghua is a big deal. I call and the phone rings three times before I remember that it\u2019s still the middle of the night in China and it\u2019s too late to hang up.\n \u201c\u5582?\u201d says a groggy voice at the other end of the line.\n \u201cDr. Wu? This is Sarah Levy. I got your e-mail.\u201d\n \u201cAh,\u201d she says, uncomfortable in English. \u201cDr. Levy.\u201d\n \u201cI wanted to ask you a few questions about it.\u201d\n By the time she tells me that she\u2019s not at Tsinghua University in Beijing, but Tsing Hua National University in Taiwan, we\u2019re already well underway.\n I\u2019m in Hsinchu for yet another meeting with Hsi-ing when you call.\n It\u2019s Martha. She just collapsed in the middle of the day. Nothing to be done. The doctors say she wasn\u2019t even conscious when she hit the ground. No pain. Could have happened to anyone.\n \u201cOh God. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll fly back right away.\u201d\n \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to need help. There\u2019s so much to deal with. Probate and funerals and\u2014\u201d\n \u201cM\u2014Sarah. I\u2019ve got it. And Kyla\u2019s here to help me. It\u2019s okay. Keep doing your research.\u201d\n \u201cThis is important, though. This is family.\u201d\n You laugh nervously.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cWell,\u201d you say, not willing to say it.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014Kyla\u2019s already here. And if you show up\u2014you know how she is. It\u2019ll be a whole thing.\u201d\n \u201cBut I want to be there.\u201d\n \u201cI know you do, and I appreciate it, but I really think that it\u2019d be easier for everyone if you didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n My stomach.\n \u201cAre you okay?\u201d you ask.\n \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n A pause. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\n And then I\u2019m alone in my hotel room in the middle of the night in Hsinchu and Martha\u2019s dead and I can\u2019t even bring myself to cry.\n Hsi-ing\u2019s idea is simple. If the reason for Dark Energy is that the universe is spinning (technically: is a non-inertial reference frame), then there should be a way for us, ourselves, to stop spinning along with the universe. If we did that, we would exist in an entirely different space-time frame\u2014not expanding, not contracting, but simply existing in flat relative motion.\n Her experimental apparatus\u2014an array of very accurate gyroscopes and counter masses\u2014is designed to do exactly that. They\u2019re brilliant because she\u2019s brilliant. To be honest, I don\u2019t fully understand the mechanics.\n One of the side effects of this is that objects within the apparatus seem to disappear and then reappear elsewhere nearly instantaneously.\n Once the media gets a hold of it, it\u2019s a circus. IFLScience.com dubs her experiment the \u201cWu-Levy Drive.\u201d (It\u2019s not a drive. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t even go anywhere, or move through space at all. Not that that stops the endless wash of clickbait across my Facebook feed every morning.)\n To work well and safely, the experiment should be conducted in as flat a space-time as possible, away from any significant source of gravity. It should be conducted in space. Which means that to test this, we\u2019re going to need to work with NASA.\n NASA is happy to work with us. Thrilled.\n I only agree to the press conference because I know you\u2019re going to be there. I hate press conferences so much that I\u2019ve cultivated a reputation as a recluse to avoid them. But NASA loves to make headlines, and \u201cAstronaut son of Sarah Levy to test pilot the Wu-Levy drive\u201d will certainly get them some headlines.\n I bet that they asked you to change your last name. So we\u2019d match. I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t.\n I\u2019m sitting in the green room at Two Independence Square. Everyone is moving around me, fussing, fixing, and they\u2019ve slathered me in more makeup than I\u2019ve worn for the past twenty years combined.\n I see you, coming out of your own room, right behind the press agent who is telling me, again, to make sure I look into the cameras. I lift my hand to wave, but you\u2019re already on your way and you don\u2019t see me.\n The press conferences goes okay. You\u2019re perfect\u2014\u201cperfectly safe\u201d \u201cbeen tested on drones and bats and monkeys and even a particular chinchilla\u201d \u201cvery excited\u201d \u201cthe team on the ground are the real heroes, I just go where I\u2019m sent.\u201d\n When it\u2019s my turn to speak, though, I forget to look into the cameras.\n After the press conference, I ask if you want to get dinner, but you already have plans.\n I think about you every day. Is that surprising? But of course I think about you. I love you. I still love you.\n Something, somewhere, went wrong. Somehow, for some reason, this distance between us keeps growing and growing. I want so much to understand it, to confront it, to reverse it. To hug you and hold you close and just to talk, about anything at all. I want, I hope, but I know it can\u2019t happen. I just don\u2019t know why.\n My love for you feels like an incomplete theory. I have all the pieces, but I just can\u2019t put them together into any kind of understanding. And at the end of all my work, all I have is this shameless kludge: I love you. I still love you. I never stopped.\n I\u2019m with you at Vandenberg on launch day. NASA would never let us miss a photo op. So while you\u2019re walking out toward the rocket, while the press is gaggling all around us, I take your hand and squeeze it. You squeeze back and smile at me.\n I hug you. The press loves it\u2014we can both hear all the shutters.\n \u201cI love you, kid,\u201d I say, although I\u2019m not sure that you can hear me.\n \u201cI love you too, Mom,\u201d you reply. Your voice is uncomfortable and strained, but of course there\u2019s the whole mission in front of you.\n I don\u2019t know if you mean it. But I tell myself you do.\n Once upon a time, we thought that the expansion of the universe, braked by gravity, would slow down, stop, and reverse. Once upon a time, we thought that the distant stars and galaxies would one day return to us, that we would, in some distant future, be together again.\n But now we\u2019ve learned. Now, we know better. Any contraction, any reunion with the distant stars we left behind at the beginning of the universe, is impossible. The space between galaxies is accelerating. There is no reunion in our future, only distance, and more distance, and finally isolation.\n We\u2019ll spin further and further apart, faster and faster, until we all become completely isolated, until the space between us is unbridgeable and there is no clue for each of us that the other was ever there at all.\n The phone rings at four in the morning and I think maybe it\u2019s you and I pick it up.\n \u201cDr. Levy?\u201d asks the voice on the other end. It\u2019s not you. My stomach.\n \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cDr. Levy. We just thought . . . There\u2019s been an . . . We\u2019re not sure . . . We\u2019re trying everything we can. We recovered the machine, but he was . . . that is . . . We just wanted you to know before it hit the news tomorrow.\u201d\n You were four years old in our overgrown backyard, and I held your hands and spun you around, and you started laughing, and I started laughing, and I never let you go.\n \u201cWe\u2019re trying everything we can. But we may not get him back.\u201d\n By the time Martha got home, she found us both still laughing, flat on our backs, exhausted and dizzy, looking up at the sunset clouds through the tall grass. She frowned at us, and we tried to explain, but we both kept laughing until it was dark and she was laughing too and none the wiser.\n \u201cDr. Levy?\u201d\n We walked hand in hand\u2014me on the left and Martha on the right and you in the middle\u2014down the block for pizza. You announced that you were going to get pineapple, and Martha threatened jalape\u00f1os. I made a face. In the night sky above us, the universe and all its galaxies spun themselves away from us, never to return.\n P H Lee lives with the rose bushes behind an old walnut tree down a dead-end road out past the highway.

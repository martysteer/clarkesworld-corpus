Okay, that\u2019s not a thing, but it should be. Much as slow food encompasses every aspect of production, culminating with consumption, the idea of slow fiction speaks to every stage of a story\u2019s life cycle.\n I should clarify that I\u2019m not talking about drafting speed, nor productivity. Go about your initial drafting at whatever pace works for you. Bradbury believed in writing the first draft with gusto, but didn\u2019t discourage editing after that energetic outpouring of prose. His \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to explore the attic\u201d is closer to what I\u2019m getting at; you never reach the attic if you don\u2019t leave enough time to get past the ground floor.\n No, I\u2019m here to speak for any slowdown that helps you make your story the best story it can be, whether that\u2019s at the idea phase or the first draft, or sometime after that initial draft has made it to the page, after you\u2019ve celebrated the successful translation of inspiration to prose, when you\u2019re still excited about what you\u2019ve accomplished.\n When writing to a theme or prompt, it\u2019s often said that you should discard the first idea that comes to mind. The first is superficial, the obvious thing, a story that is writable but not necessarily worth writing. Give the prompt time to rattle around with everything else in your head and you may come up with something far better. The same goes for non-prompted stories: your first idea, as shiny as it is, is often the easy version. Ted Chiang has said in interviews that he plays with a concept for a long time before even starting to draft; the ideas that stick with him are the ones he takes the time to write. Connie Willis has advised her Clarion students to think of their stories just before they go to bed, so the subconscious gets a bite at it.\n Some stories simply need more time. The ideas need breathing room, or the author needs time to develop the skills to write it. I took my novelette \u201cWind Will Rove\u201d to the Sycamore Hill peer workshop in 2015, then put it aside for a year before revising it. The advice at the workshop was encouraging and thoughtful, but I knew I wasn\u2019t ready to do the work necessary to transform a good draft into the story I thought it could be. I thought about it during that time, and how to make the changes, all without touching the document again until I thought I was ready.\n Learn to recognize the stories you aren\u2019t ready to write yet. Incubate them and write other things. I asked Nebula and World Fantasy Award winner Alyssa Wong about this, and she said, \u201cSometimes a story isn\u2019t done until it is. And sometimes, you have to grow into the kind of writer who can write the story you need to tell, and that can take a long time. \u2018Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers\u2019 took three years for me to figure out; I\u2019ve been working on another since 2013, and I still haven\u2019t cracked it. And that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m patient, because I\u2019d rather tell the story as it needs to be told, rather than in a form that I\u2019m not satisfied with (I\u2019ve done that too). I think it\u2019s natural to worry about whether or not you\u2019re writing fast enough. But it\u2019s also important to be proud of your work, and I only send out a story when I know I can be proud of it.\u201d\n Seanan McGuire wrote a series of tweets recently in which she said that, though she\u2019s a prolific author, \u201cwhat sometimes seems to come as a surprise is the part where not every book can be written the second I think of it. Some books require me to do other things first. They need me to get BETTER.\u201d\n Think of the personal satisfaction you\u2019ll feel completing a story that went beyond your initial idea to ask the next question, and the next, to probe edges, to delve deeper. The story you had time to read out loud, to edit not just for spelling errors but for rhythm, for language, for lyrical truth. The story with the first line that you found after writing the last line and realizing you could cut the first two paragraphs entirely. The story with the last sentence that makes you weep for its perfection.\n In a 2016 interview with Meghan McCarron, Ted Chiang said, \u201cAs for advice to slow writers, I\u2019d say that writing is not a race. This isn\u2019t a situation where only the most prolific writers get an audience; publish your story when you\u2019re ready, and it will find readers.\u201d\n The temptation is there. A story out the door is a potential sale. Everyone wants to check off the bingo square that says \u201cthree professional sales,\u201d and \u201cten professional sales,\u201d etc. Each sale is its own rush, as is publication day, and slow fiction means those come less often. Still, there\u2019s something to be said for fewer, better stories.\n We all wind up against immovable dates. Deadlines abound, and it\u2019s easy to wind up in the position of constantly writing up to them. They\u2019re everywhere: magazines with narrow windows, themed anthologies with open submissions, solicited stories I\u2019ve agreed to write only to have the deadline settle its weighty body up against my subconscious.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I console myself. \u201cYou write clean first drafts.\u201d\n I remind myself of Heinlein\u2019s rules, which I mostly agree with except for \u201cyou must refrain from rewriting,\u201d and of Bradbury\u2019s, which I prefer. I hit my word count, do an editing pass, and send it out the door, and a week later (if I\u2019m lucky) or when the magazine comes out (if I\u2019m not) I realize what I could have done with the story given more time.\n My goal is to make those rushed stories the exception, rather than the rule. I\u2019ve come around to the theory that those situations come up and need to be handled, but most stories are better for a little aging. (First draft essay simile: every story is better for a little aging, like a fine wine. Second draft essay: Wine is a boring comparison. Look up the effect of aging on meat. Is that a better comparison? Third draft: Or a stout! How many people even know you can age a stout? They develop nuances of flavor that blah blah blah . . .) Michael R. Underwood carried my simile forward, pointing out that there\u2019s a difference between folding herbs into a recipe and adding them in after it\u2019s cooked.\n No, as long as I\u2019m looking to classic SF writers for inspiration, I think I\u2019m better off with Ursula K. Le Guin (when am I not?). On her website\u2019s FAQ, she answered the question \u201cDo you revise many times?\u201d with \u201cAs many times as necessary. With one story or novel, this may be five false starts and six or eight or ten full rewrites, beginning to end. With the next, it may mean just going back through it and over it fiddling details until I think it\u2019s as good as I can get it.\u201d\n Or I can go with Sturgeon\u2019s \u201cask the next question.\u201d That\u2019s what my first-draft-and-out-the-door stories lack. A first draft has all the shine of the original inspiration, if I\u2019m lucky enough to have removed it from my head intact, but it\u2019s often superficial. It has good bones, some turns of phrase I\u2019m pleased with, characters and structure that carried me through. And yet it often lacks depth. The \u201cwhy\u201d or the \u201cand then\u201d to the \u201cwhat if?\u201d\n A story I\u2019ve finished without rush has time to go to one of my critique partners. Every story that I\u2019ve put in front of other readers before sending it out is better for the extra travel. A beta reader is not in my head, and thus can only rely on what they see in front of them. They can answer the question of whether the idea survived the trip to the page far better than I can. An editor told me he can always tell which stories were sent out half-baked, and which were seen by beta readers.\n We all miss things. We bring our own baggage, our own background. Things that seem obvious to us are not necessarily obvious to others, or vice versa. You described the people who ride the bus, but what about the driver? Problems I didn\u2019t foresee, contradictory actions, sensitivity reads. Think of all the pain you can save both yourself and your readers if you give yourself a chance to notice the stereotype you accidentally reinforced. You didn\u2019t mean to do it. You thought the metaphor was a clever one.\n More than that. A week later, two weeks later, I\u2019ll be out for a run, and realize that a character should do THIS instead of THAT, or I should add a line about so and so. It\u2019s sometimes possible to do this in copy edits, but why risk it? Give yourself a chance to think about the story, but also not to think about it. To let it sit in the back of your brain instead of the front.\n There\u2019s a difference between aging a story and sitting on a story. I\u2019m not advocating holding onto it until your topical story becomes obsolete, or your deadline flatlines. I\u2019m advocating letting it become a thing of craft instead of solely inspiration. A chance to level up. A collaboration between current you and future you.\n Welcome to the Slow Fiction Movement.\n Sarah Pinsker is the author of the Nebula winning novelette, \"Our Lady of the Open Road\" and the Theodore Sturgeon Award winning novelette, \"In Joy, Knowing the Abyss Behind.\" Her stories have appeared in Asimov's, Strange Horizons, Fantasy & Science Fiction, Lightspeed, and Uncanny, among others, as well as numerous anthologies, and have been nominated for the Nebula, Hugo, Sturgeon, Locus, and Eugie Foster awards.

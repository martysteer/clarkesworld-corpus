An arm wrapped around her, its familiar touch comforting.\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked.\nNothing. The word vibrated on her lips, the rest of the sentence queued up neatly behind it\u2014just a dream. But the words wouldn\u2019t come out. They were blocked by the sudden, bitter remembrance of where she was, and why, and that knowledge took her words and replaced them with fresh tears.\nThis is my trailer. This is the work site. In a few hours, the sun will rise and then the world will finally go away.\nMost of it.\nSix months in limbo, free of the sympathy and cloying closeness of friends and relatives. Six months free of their judgment, to be as alone as she could be so that she could face the brutal truth of what had happened.\nSamuel. Samuel had\u2014\nSamuel\u2019s dead.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, finally, forcing the word out through her tears. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\nEver obedient, Sammy relaxed, and she could feel his breathing even, smoothing into a rhythm that was so familiar. Alone now in the silent room, Lucy curled into the embrace of her dead husband and wept.\n\u201cTen. Nine. Eight.\u201d Russ the tech stood in the middle of the highway, reading the numbers out as they flashed across the clock that hung on the side of the contractor\u2019s trailer. The workers stood before him, bored and hung over, jaded by previous tours of limbo. The few virgins in the crowd tried to fake their own indifference, but Lucy caught them looking up at the sky with her.\n\u201cTwo. One.\u201d Russ raised a hand and opened it, stretching his fingers out. \u201cBoom.\u201d\nNo noise, no light, no twist of the sensitive follicles in her inner ear informed Lucy of the change. Only the sky above altered, its shining blue fading to a dull, listless gray. It became a slate colored hemisphere that arced over her, the workers, the cluster of trailers, the construction equipment, and the whole highway interchange, a circle that stretched almost a full kilometer. The bright, clear blue of the morning was gone, lost now in a fog thick as mud.\nA crow started from the long grass behind one of the dormitory trailers. Lucy watched it flap up, flying confused into the colorless sky, skirting the nothing that now bounded their little world. They had stepped out of time, and were trapped now in their own tiny purgatory.\n\u201cOkay people, it\u2019s limbo time.\u201d Tate, the project manager, didn\u2019t shout, but his words carried over the crowd. He pointed one thick finger at the clock, where the green of Russ\u2019 countdown had been replaced by a long stretch of red numerals ticking down the time they had left. \u201cIn six months we rejoin the real world, and if this interstate doesn\u2019t have a shiny new auto-drive compliant interchange, none of us gets paid. So get your asses in gear.\u201d\nThe crowd broke, workers scattering toward equipment or trailers. One group of began to sing as they walked\u2014\u201cYou load sixteen tons, and what do you get, six months older and divorced I bet . . . \u201d\nThe rest of the words were lost to the high whine of the big electric engines, and Lucy let her eyes slip from the drifting black silhouette of the crow to the man who had stopped next to the bright red-cross sign that stood before her trailer.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it worry you, Doc.\u201d Russ waved at the blank sky. \u201cIt\u2019s just nothing. You get used to it.\u201d\nLucy reached back and found the door handle, but she nodded before she traded his smooth smile for the welcome solitude of her trailer.\n\u201cI already am.\u201d\n\u201cThe stars are not wanted now, put out every one / Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun / Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood / For nothing now can ever come to any go\u2014\u201d\nThe knock\u2014Pop! Pop! Pop!\u2014broke the smooth flow of Sammy\u2019s recitation. The trailer fell silent except for the soft purr of the medical equipment and the distant rumble of bulldozers. At her desk, Lucy opened her eyes, the blessed, fragile trance of not-thinking gone, and glared at the door.\nIn his chair on the other side of the room, Sammy looked up at her, waiting for her command.\n\u201cGo\u2014\u201d she started to say, but her door was already being opened. Russ stepped out of the flat gray light of limbo, and the words\u2014to our room fell apart in Lucy\u2019s mouth. Instead she made a quick cutting gesture, and Sammy obediently folded his hands and bowed his head, silent.\n\u201cHey, Doc.\u201d Russ grinned at her, eyes flashing just for an instant over at Sammy then back. \u201cYou open?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-four seven,\u201d she answered, flatly.\n\u201c184. Well, 179 now,\u201d the tech said, nodding towards the merciless clock that hung off Tate\u2019s trailer, ticking away the days. \u201cBut who\u2019s counting?\u201d\nThe tech kept smiling, but he hesitated in the door, caught for a moment in the strong current of go away that Lucy was pushing at him. But he shoved through it and entered her space, taking the chair across the desk from her. \u201cSo,\u201d he started, then left the word hanging.\nLucy looked down at her desk, at the neat ranks of pills that she had been slowly inventorying. The tiny green capsules contained a potent narcotic that could silence any nocioreceptor. Five. A simple calculation, based on the number of milligrams per pill and her estimation of Russ\u2019 bodyweight. Shove five of these down Russ\u2019 throat, and she wouldn\u2019t have to have this conversation.\nOr she could just swallow four. That would work too.\nWith a sigh, Lucy swept the nine pills her fingers had sorted out of the pile back into the bottle and snapped the cover shut.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, hating this game so much, and hating the man who was making her play it.\nRuss lounged in her hostility, ignoring the wall of ice she was trying to build between them. \u201cThis is your first time in limbo, right?\u201d He leaned back in the chair, propped his feet on the edge of her desk, pushing deeper into her space. Pressing her rejection, to see if it would sharpen, or break. \u201cIt\u2019s my fifth. It\u2019s not so bad, y\u2019know. For skilled support like us, it\u2019s pretty relaxing.\u201d His eyes wandered her desk, taking in its sterile blankness. \u201cMaybe a little boring.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you with that,\u201d Lucy said, folding her arms, placing them like armor over her body. Russ lifted his eyes to watch her move, and she saw his smile shift, twisting away from simplistic seduction to something sharper. He had given up before really even trying, and now he just stared at her tits and shrugged.\n\u201cReally? That\u2019s too bad.\u201d His eyes crawled up to meet hers, and he looked like he was trying to be funny but his thwarted hostility was too close to the surface not to see. \u201cOnce, me and one of the other docs, we entertained each other through these long, gray days.\u201d Russ tilted his head and stared over at Sammy, sitting silent in his chair like a dropped marionette. \u201cBut I guess you brought your own entertainment.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a medical complaint?\u201d Lucy\u2019s anger made her voice crisp. \u201cIf not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s smart.\u201d Russ shifted in his seat, pressing deeper into the cushions of the chair. \u201cThe fuck bots in the rec trailer, they\u2019re top of the line, but the wait list can get awful long. That\u2019s why people end up resorting to each other, even though that always ends up in drama. Course, drama . . . \u201d Russ looked over at Sammy, staring openly this time. \u201cSome people think that\u2019s a good way to keep from getting bored too.\u201d He shrugged and shook his head, as if such thoughts were incomprehensible. \u201cSo how much did this fellow set you back? Custom units are pricey, and he looks just like\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOut.\u201d Lucy\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t crisp now, it was sharp as a broken mirror, silver razor shards that covered a bathroom floor stippled with blood. \u201cGo. Now.\u201d\nRuss stood, his small smile sadistic and satisfied. He hadn\u2019t gotten to fuck her, but he\u2019d fucked with her, and that seemed to satisfy him. \u201cRight, Doc. Not something you want to talk about.\u201d He went to the door, put his hand on the handle and paused.\nOf course there would be one last line, a final dig. Maybe he\u2019d practiced a few on the way over, maybe this would be his best, carefully chosen to cut. Lucy\u2019s hands held tight to the arms of her chair, and she tried to forget that she knew where all the scalpels were.\n\u201cGot to tell you though, Doc, it seems a little weird, doesn\u2019t it? Keeping a sex bot that looks just like the man you killed?\u201d\n\u201cOut,\u201d Lucy said again, and Russ went, disappearing into the flat gray light of limbo, leaving her alone.\nBut not alone enough.\nNever alone enough.\n\u201cSammy,\u201d she said, and he looked up, his so-familiar features returning to life. Although they had never looked that peaceful in life, had they? Samuel had never had that kind of serenity, even in his sleep.\nEven in death.\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked, his voice so calm.\n\u201cRead that one again.\u201d\nThe crow circled over the trailers, the black cross of its body the only mark on the oblivion sky. Lucy sprawled across her bed, a doll of knotted rags, and stared at it through her window. Usually, the crow stayed low, tapping across the trailer roofs, riding the tops of the slower equipment, or hopping through the dust, caging scraps of food from the workers. Now though, it drifted high above them all, risking a crash into the invisible dome of the temporal bubble that trapped it in limbo with them.\nWas it bored? Confused? Lonely? Was it searching for more of its raucous, squabbling kind?\nOr did it feel safer, freer, as a murder of one?\nOutside a chime rang and the low hum of engines and the clank of moving steel got quieter. Lunch break, and the crow folded its wings and dropped, diving for the picnic tables that surrounded the mess hall.\nLucy closed her eyes and sighed, and the hands that had been patiently working over her feet paused their soothing movement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Sammy,\u201d she whispered, not bothering to open her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2014\u201d\nSomewhere outside the trailer there was a pop, a snap of sound like a gun firing in a confined space, and Lucy\u2019s eyes flew open. Through her window she saw the gray sky flicker. For a moment it was black, then blue, then black, then bright and then a blur, and her stomach was twisting and she was digging her fingers deep into the soft foam pad of her bed, clinging to it because her body was convinced it was falling, plummeting and spinning as the sky strobed overhead, switching light and dark and blue and black and\u2014\nThen it was gray again, and Lucy was just lying on the bed, not falling, and her hand shot out to grab Sammy\u2019s, clutching it tight as a terrified child.\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sammy said. His voice was as even as always, his green eyes clear and calm. He gripped her hand back, firm and comforting. \u201cWhat do you need? Should I keep rubbing your feet?\u201d\nOutside, an alarm kicked on, low and whooping.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lucy said, pulling her hand free and sitting up. \u201cFind my shoes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Maggie, but I want this small.\u201d Tate stood in the door of the contractor\u2019s trailer, blocking out the stocky woman and the crowd of workers who stood behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll brief you after.\u201d\nMaggie Wu, the site\u2019s union rep, shoved back her shock of pink-dyed hair and glared at Lucy. \u201cYou got enough room for the Doc in there. She\u2019s not hard-tech. Why\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDr. Botha has a bachelors degree in electrical engineering,\u201d Tate said.\n\u201cYeah, and I have a tech degree in electrical systems, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll use it to go figure out why that fuel cell blew, okay?\u201d Tate looked past her at the crowd of workers clustered around the trailer. \u201cWhatever happened, it\u2019s done, and we\u2019re safe. All systems are reading good, and the other fuel cells check out. This is just us trying to figure out a glitch, okay? So please, get back to work, there\u2019s nothing else you can do and we\u2019re still on the clock. When we figure out what happened, we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\u201cWe know what happened,\u201d someone shouted out of the crowd. \u201cRuss is spending so much time fucking the robots in the rec trailer, he forgot to maintain his system!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the kind of shit we don\u2019t need in here,\u201d Tate snapped. \u201cGet. Back. To. Work. Or kiss this month\u2019s bonuses goodbye.\u201d\nMaggie shook her head in disgust, but she jerked her head and the crowd behind her began to disperse. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a long talk after this, Tate,\u201d she growled, then turned and stalked off, heading towards the fuel cells.\nAcross the room from Lucy, Russ shifted, his face mottled red and white with anger and the remnants of panic. \u201cWhich one of those assholes said that?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Tate said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Russ spluttered.\n\u201cMatter,\u201d Tate snapped. The manager dropped into a chair, glaring at Russ. \u201cWhere were you, when that fuel cell blew?\u201d\nRuss shut his mouth and looked away from Tate, his hand curling into a fist.\n\u201cYeah, thought so. Where you always are. I\u2019ve been getting complaints about you, hogging the conjugal bots.\u201d\n\u201cI stick to the schedules, just like everyone else,\u201d Russ said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you maintain the system that controls those schedules?\u201d Lucy didn\u2019t want the argument, but she couldn\u2019t keep from getting a kick in at Russ while he was down.\n\u201cWhat, are you accusing me of something?\u201d Russ snarled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that brought your own personal\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShit, enough,\u201d Tate said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said anything. This meeting is about what just happened. So lets keep our focus just on that. Okay?\u201d\nRuss stared at Lucy, his eyes bright with something like hate, but he pushed himself back, trying to look like he was relaxing instead of sulking. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said.\nLucy just nodded.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tate said. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d\nThe anger in Russ\u2019 face faded, replaced by frustration edged in fear. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He reached over and plucked a slate out of the rack, and its screen lit up. His fingers danced across the surface, pulling up data streams. \u201cWhen that fuel cell blew, it caused a surge, which tripped a fail-safe in the temporal system. From what I can figure so far, the control computer was presented with conflicting information\u2014that there was an emergency, and it should take us out of limbo, and that everything was fine, keep us in. So for 3.6 seconds, it tried to do both before it settled on staying.\u201d\n\u201cSo it started to drop us back into the normal time stream, but didn\u2019t?\u201d Tate said.\n\u201cWell . . . \u201d Russ hedged.\n\u201cThe sky flickered.\u201d Lucy made herself look at Russ. \u201cWhen did it try to bring us back to?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Russ said.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Tate said. \u201cWhat does that mean? When the system pops us out of limbo, early or otherwise, we just appear right when we left. Right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to,\u201d Russ said. \u201cBut this time . . . It\u2019s like we came loose for a few seconds, and the system kind of lost track of where we came from and was just trying to shove us back into the time stream whenever.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d Tate shook his head. \u201cTime travel\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\u201cKind of,\u201d Russ said. He slumped in his chair, his earlier hostility gone, dissolved into helpless frustration. \u201cThe past is closed, but you can go into the future.\u201d\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t people do that?\u201d Tate asked.\n\u201cWe all do, all the time. That\u2019s life,\u201d Russ said. \u201cWith a temporal system, you can just go a lot further if you want. You just can\u2019t travel back. When we come back from limbo, we come back a microsecond into the future. But we can\u2019t go backwards.\u201d\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nLucy watched Tate, saw the awareness of the situation ripple through his features.\n\u201cWe almost came back to some point in the future\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlmost a dozen,\u201d Russ said.\n\u201cAnd if we had, we would have been trapped there.\u201d Tate blinked at Russ. \u201cHow far in the future?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. A few days. A few years. A few million years?\u201d Russ shrugged. \u201cIt could have been any of them.\u201d\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Tate said softly. \u201cBut we\u2019re okay now?\u201d\n\u201cSystem says we\u2019re good,\u201d Russ said.\n\u201cAnd this won\u2019t happen again?\u201d\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\u201d Russ shook his head, staring down at his data. \u201cI\u2019ll look this over and rewrite the fail-safes, make sure it can\u2019t happen again. I\u2019ve got no interest in being Morlock chow.\u201d\nTate blinked in confusion at that last bit, but he got the gist of it. \u201cGood. Do that, and you can keep one of the conjugal bots in your trailer for all I care.\u201d\nRuss shot Lucy a look, which she ignored. \u201cI\u2019ll get to work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get back safe and on time, just like always. Just make sure that Maggie keeps the rest of the fuel-cells running.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll mention it to her when we talk,\u201d Tate said. \u201cNow\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done,\u201d Lucy said. She looked at Tate, ignored Russ.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tate said.\n\u201cThe sky flickered,\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cYeah, I explained that,\u201d Russ said. \u201cWeren\u2019t you listening?\u201d\n\u201cI was listening when you said that traveling back in time was impossible. That once you had gone to the future, you were trapped there. We touched the future for long enough to see the sky change. Photons came through.\u201d\n\u201cPhotons?\u201d Russ said.\n\u201cMore than that,\u201d Lucy nodded toward the window. \u201cI smelled things coming over. Grass, water, other things. Things I haven\u2019t smelled in weeks. The air in this bubble has had a month to get stale, but it doesn\u2019t smell stale now. Air came through too.\u201d\n\u201cAir, photons. Whatever,\u201d Russ threw up his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe there\u2019s a size limit on time travel. Maybe little things can move back. Or maybe because we were separate from time, we could carry things\u2014fuck I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a physicist, I\u2019m a tech. I just know that the system says were okay now.\u201d\n\u201cSo maybe we are. It\u2019s not my job to worry about that.\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re a doctor.\u201d Tate frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about what might have been in the air.\u201d\n\u201cBacteria. Viruses.\u201d Lucy took a deep breath. \u201cThere are billions of them, in every breath we take. How many of the ones that we are breathing in now are from some future time?\u201d\n\u201cWould they be dangerous?\u201d Russ said, his eyes wide, his breathing shallow.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lucy said, purposefully echoing Russ. \u201cProbably not. But I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Tate said, echoing himself. \u201cHow do you find out?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll run tests, on the air and on us. Mostly though, we\u2019ll just have to watch and wait. Our bodies will let us know.\u201d\n\u201cOur bodies will let us know.\u201d Tate barked a short, utterly humorless laugh. \u201cI\u2019m glad I kicked Maggie out. Shit like this could start a panic.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and she would demand higher bonuses too,\u201d Russ said. His smile was thin and sickly.\n\u201cShe would,\u201d Tate said, not smiling at all. \u201cOkay, go. Do what you can. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve got to make sure that this doesn\u2019t set us back. If I\u2019m going to get almost stranded in the future, then spend months worrying if my hemorrhoids are some Sci-Fi super flu that\u2019s eating my ass, I\u2019m going to get paid.\u201d\n\u201cDoc, we need you!\u201d\nMaggie had jerked open Lucy\u2019s door just long enough to yell that at her, then she was gone, the door left hanging open behind her. Lucy blinked up from her growth plates, staring out at dirt and dead grass and gray sky, then her feet were slamming down into her shoes and she was grabbing her go kit and running, moving as fast as she had when she had been a resident doing her rotation in the ER.\nShe ran through the trailers and out into the site, past heaps of broken cement and tangles of rusted rebar, around the hulking yellow construction bots, silent and motionless now, their controllers clustered in a knot in the tall brown grass that covered the triangle between onramps. Maggie bulled through the crowd and Lucy moved in her wake, reaching the man who lay sprawled on the ground.\nIt was Devon, maybe, not that Lucy had ever cared much for anyone\u2019s name here, but with just sixty of them the information accumulated. She hit her knees on the weeds beside him, pulling out her diagnostic and taking him in. His skin, usually a few shades darker than hers, had gone gray and he was trembling and sweating. Shocky, she thought, slapping a diagnostic strip to the skin of his neck.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, watching as the data from the strip streamed across the screen of her diagnostic.\n\u201cSnake bite.\u201d The man who said it was standing beside Devon, a shovel held in his hands. He pointed down at the ground, and Lucy could see the slim green and yellow corpse coiled in the grass. It was a little thing, half a meter long maybe and not much thicker than her thumb, and the blade of the shovel was shoved through it, splitting the body in half.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d she said, scanning the body, and found the bite just as the man said, \u201cAnkle.\u201d\nThe spot was above the ankle actually, at the start of the calf, just over the edge of Devon\u2019s work boot, but close enough. There were two tiny marks, one leaking a drop of blood, surrounded by a halo of puffy skin. She looked away, checking the vitals that were now spilling across her screen. Strong but shocky.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou and you and you and you, pick him up and take him back to my trailer. Carefully,\u201d she added as they started to hoist Devon up. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, turning back to the man with the shovel, \u201cbring\u2014\u201d\nThere was a thump as he raised the shovel and brought it down again, smacking it down on the head end of the snake\u2019s corpse. \u201cIt wiggled,\u201d he said. \u201cI cut it in half, but it keeps wriggling.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, I need to be able to figure out the species. So stop hitting it, scoop it into a bucket, and bring it too.\u201d\n\u201cSnake bite. Shit.\u201d Tate stared down in disgust at Devon, who lay silent in one of the med trailer\u2019s beds, surrounded by instruments. \u201cFirst that flicker, now this. I\u2019m beginning to think this job is cursed.\u201d\n\u201cThis briefing isn\u2019t going to help,\u201d Lucy said, picking up a slate and readying her information. On the other side of Tate, Russ was staring at the unconscious man with a sort of sick fascination. Lucy flicked her eyes to Tate, who shrugged slightly. None of them had said anything about their last meeting, about the unknowns of temporal physics or the hazards of disease. They had just done their jobs and kept their secrets, and now they were a cabal it seemed.\nThis briefing wouldn\u2019t help that either.\n\u201cIt was venomous?\u201d Russ asked, his eyes shifting down to the white gauze square on Devon\u2019s lower leg.\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Lucy said. She held up a hand, cutting Russ off. He frowned at her, but let her talk. \u201cThe genetic analysis came back as a common garter snake. Non-venomous, though occasionally toxic depending on what they\u2019ve eaten. But this wasn\u2019t a common garter. Here.\u201d She held out her slate, and Russ and Tate leaned in, staring at the screen. \u201cThis is an image of the snake\u2019s body, where the shovel cut her in half.\u201d\nRuss made a face, but Tate studied the screen. \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d he asked, his finger tracing over the ribbons of silver and black that ran through the cylindrical body, paralleling broken arteries and nerves.\n\u201cThe uncommon bits,\u201d Lucy said. She tapped the screen, and the image magnified into something that looked like a vine made of intricately wrapped chains. \u201cIt\u2019s lengths of carbon, mostly, with silicon and a few trace elements mixed in.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nanotech,\u201d Russ said. His fingers traced over the screen. \u201cI\u2019ve seen stuff like this, just not nearly as intricate. That was in that snake?\u201d He looked up at Lucy, his eyes for once empty of anger or challenge. \u201cThat thing was a cyborg?\u201d\n\u201cThrough and through,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just the big stuff. The nanotech is integrated throughout the snake\u2019s body, down to a cellular level.\u201d\n\u201cThis . . . \u201d Russ moved his fingers, twisting the image on the screen, magnifying it. \u201cThis is way more advanced than any nano I\u2019ve seen. We can\u2019t make this. Yet.\u201d\n\u201cIt came through,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cDuring the flicker. We brought back air, and scent, and this.\u201d\n\u201cIt was just seconds. Less than,\u201d Russ muttered. \u201cIt\u2014damn, there isn\u2019t any other explanation, is there? It\u2019s something from the future.\u201d\n\u201cBut what is it?\u201d Tate asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s it for? What\u2019s it do?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The snake\u2019s not talking.\u201d Lucy handed the slate to Tate and stepped over to the counter that sat beside Devon\u2019s bed. A small box sat on that table, its clear plastic covered with a towel. She pulled the towel off, and watched as the two men froze, staring. Behind the clear plastic, the snake raised her head and stared back at them, forked tongue flickering.\n\u201cSergi cut that thing in half,\u201d Tate said.\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Lucy said, staring down at the smooth-scaled creature. \u201cShe got better.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Russ tore his eyes away from the snake and stared back at Devon, who had slept peacefully through everything. \u201cI know what\u2019s going on now. I\u2019ve seen this horror show. The nanotech is in him now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nLucy couldn\u2019t help but feel a twist of pleasure at his fear. \u201cYes. It\u2019s spreading, like an infection. It started around the wound, but it\u2019s gone system-wide now. He was acting toxic for a while, I thought it might kill him, but that\u2019s passed. I think whatever it is, it adjusted to him. It accepted his body, or his body accepted it, and now it\u2019s part of him and growing.\u201d\n\u201cBut what\u2019s it doing?\u201d Tate said, stepping back from the bed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lucy shook her head. \u201cHe was raving when he was toxic. Then he started calming down, started relaxing when the adjustment was made. He got . . . calm. Serene. Then it crossed the blood-brain barrier, went into his CNS, and he went to sleep. That was a few hours ago.\u201d\n\u201cHis brain,\u201d Tate muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s in his brain? What the hell is it going to do to him?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out when he wakes up,\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cWhen he wakes up?\u201d Russ rounded on her. \u201cIs that your plan? To just watch this happen? I know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d He pointed at the box with the snake, which still watched him. \u201cThis thing has that shit, and it passed it on. He\u2019s probably going to try to do the same. Bite us, bleed on us, fuck us, whatever, he\u2019s going to try to infect us all. God damn it, you were the one that was supposed to be looking out for diseases and you can\u2019t see that this might be the god-damned zombie apocalypse?\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re overreacting,\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cOverreacting?\u201d Russ shouted. \u201cThere is an undead snake right there, sitting next to patient zero here who is changing into god knows what, and you think I might be overreacting? You, you sick bitch, are the one with the reaction issues.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Lucy asked, keeping her anger cold, letting it harden her words.\n\u201cRuss, I think\u2014\u201d Tate said, but Russ cut him off.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not thinking. Look at what she\u2019s done. She figured this out hours ago, and did she come and tell us about it? No, she stayed here and watched, wanting to see what happened.\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Tate said, a little more uncertain.\n\u201cShe\u2019s watched this happen for hours, and she hasn\u2019t boxed him.\u201d He pointed at the end of the med trailer, the one opposite Lucy\u2019s living quarters. The wall there had six drawers centered in it, making it look like a morgue.\nWhich it kind of was. Stasis boxes, spin-offs of the same tech that could pull a highway interchange out of time into limbo, were options of last resort.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Tate said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d he repeated, looking at Lucy. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cStasis boxes are dangerous,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cThere\u2019s only an eighty percent survival rate if everything goes exactly right, and half those survivors come out with some kind of neurological insult. Do you want me to kill him, to cause him brain damage, when I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening to him?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to stop what\u2019s happening to him. Halt this infection in its tracks, and then you can pass him off to some experts when we leave limbo.\u201d Russ turned to stare at Devon, lying silent in his bed. \u201cBut mostly I want you to stop him from spreading this shit to us.\u201d\n\u201cYou were worried about infection.\u201d Tate frowned at her. \u201cAnd whatever this is, it\u2019s an infection. So why should we risk it?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t know what the risk is. Because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to him. His vitals have all leveled out, his brainwaves are\u2014\u201d Perfect. Too perfect, maybe, so Lucy just nodded at the man lying still in his bed. \u201cYou want me to tie him down? I can do that. But if you want me to risk killing him because Russ has watched too many horror shows, forget it. I make the medical decisions here, and I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd you are fucked up,\u201d Russ snapped. He ignored Lucy\u2019s glare, shook his head at Tate\u2019s frown. \u201cLook, this situation has gotten way out of hand way too fast, and I\u2019m not letting it blow up any more just to be polite.\u201d He pointed at Lucy. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be here. I don\u2019t know what shenanigans she pulled with the psych team, but there\u2019s no way she should have been cleared to come with us. She shot her husband in the head last year, because he was sleeping with her sister.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I shot him because he was coming after me with a knife.\u201d A distant calm had fallen over Lucy, a harbinger she knew for a storm that would roll in soon enough and decimate her, but she would stand steady in this stillness while she could.\nTate swiped a hand over his face. \u201cRuss. Lucy. None of this\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat shit happens, just a year ago, and then she comes here, joins us, dragging a sex-bot behind her. One that looks just like the husband whose brains she blew all over their bathroom. She shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Russ said, stepping towards Tate. \u201cShe\u2019s screwed up in the head, and you can\u2019t forget that. She might be a doc, but she is in no way qualified to make this decision. She has to be at least half crazy, and for all we know she could be suicidal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Lucy said, her calm starting to break around her. \u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019ve never been, even though I sometimes wish I was, when I have to deal with assholes like you.\u201d She stared past Russ to Tate. \u201cI\u2019ve already got blood on my hands and I refuse to cover them with any more, not mine, not Devon\u2019s, not anyone\u2019s.\u201d\nTate stared between her and Russ, his face blotchy with frustration. \u201cFuck it,\u201d he finally said. \u201cBox him. And that goddamned snake.\u201d\n\u201cTate\u2014\u201d Lucy started.\n\u201cI said box him,\u201d and the fear that ran below Tate\u2019s words convinced Lucy of their sincerity.\nLucy clenched her hands, trying to hold herself together. Contain, kill, that was their answer. That was always the answer. If they didn\u2019t have the stasis boxes, they would probably have made her burn him. Lucy couldn\u2019t speak, but she made herself nod.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Tate blew out a lungful of air. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Maggie and the others. You two, don\u2019t. We don\u2019t need a panic, we don\u2019t this going anymore sideways than it already has. So just stay quiet, stay apart, and do your damn jobs, and we\u2019ll keep this under control. Got it?\u201d\nLucy didn\u2019t say anything. She just walked to the end of the trailer and tapped two of the stasis boxes, starting their cycles. Behind her, she heard Russ.\n\u201cYeah. I got it.\u201d\nThe door thumped, and when Lucy turned back around, they were gone.\n\u201cSammy.\u201d\nHe stepped through the door that led into her quarters, neatly dressed in his pajamas. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t say anything, just raised her arms a little, but his programming was good. He crossed the room and took her in his arms, and she leaned into him, leaned into the familiar bulk, and wept.\nSammy held her until she stopped, let go when she pushed herself away to reach for a handful of tissues. He watched her as she cleaned her face, his eyes so calm, so empty.\nThey were like the eyes of the snake, watching her through the clear walls of its plastic prison.\nLucy stared back at Sammy\u2019s eyes, and she wondered as she always did at the difference. They were perfect copies of her dead husband\u2019s eyes, but they were so different, and she couldn\u2019t tell if it was just the lack of life, of consciousness, or if it was just serenity, something her husband had never had.\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked again.\n\u201cI need\u2014\u201d Lucy stopped. I need what\u2019s in your eyes. It wasn\u2019t something she could say. \u201cI need you to listen. To try to understand. You might think we\u2019re intelligent, someday, if we ever make you capable of thinking like that. You have to know, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re clever. Clever apes, with clever hands, and we\u2019re good at making things, like limbo, like the bulldozers, like you. But that\u2019s not the same as being intelligent. If we were intelligent . . . \u201d Lucy wadded the tissues in her hands, threw them into the trash. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t ever be stupid enough to think that we had anything under control. Least of all ourselves.\u201d\nSammy tilted his head. \u201cI listen to everything you say. What else do you need?\u201d\nLucy sighed. Behind her, the stasis boxes chimed, ready.\n\u201cYou can help me with Devon.\u201d\nSammy stepped over to the bed, and Lucy followed, staring at the unconscious man\u2019s face, slack, relaxed. On the monitor over his bed, his pulse was even, and his brainwaves moved in smooth, gliding curves, so unlike the jagged shapes that had been there before the nano had pressed its way into his brain.\nShe stood there, staring for a moment, wondering what his eyes would look like if he opened them. They had been brown and frantic when he was raving. Would they be calm now? Empty?\nSerene?\n\u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d\nLucy shook her head, breaking out of her thoughts and shushing Sammy. \u201cHelp me wheel him over to the stasis box. Then you can help me put him in.\u201d\nShe looked over at the snake, coiled and staring at her, tongue flickering. You, I can take care of on my own.\nThe air in the trailer stank, of sweat and farts and stale sex, of too many people pressed too close together for too long. Lucy followed Maggie down the narrow hall, breathing through her mouth and trying not to touch the walls. She\u2019d signed on to this damned job because she thought it was as close as she could get to being alone, this hive of closet-sized rooms and paper-thin walls was the opposite of being alone.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the first,\u201d Maggie said, stopping beside an open door. \u201cThe other\u2019s right here, next door.\u201d Beyond the crew leader, workers, all second shifters, filled the hall. Nursing cups and flasks and blunts, they watched them both with blood-shot eyes, waiting.\nTwenty minutes until their shift started, they had nothing better to do.\nLucy ducked through the first door, getting out from under their eyes. The narrow room was almost filled by the bed that had been flipped down from the wall, and a woman lay sprawled on it, asleep it seemed, drool dribbling down her chin to stain her pillow. Lucy snapped on gloves and pulled out her diagnostic, putting a strip on the woman\u2019s forehead. She thumbed open the woman\u2019s eyes, but her slow breathing didn\u2019t alter, though her pupils tightened down under the light. Lucy glanced at her diagnostics screen and nodded.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong\u2014\u201d Maggie started.\n\u201cLet me see the other one,\u201d she said, and ducked past Maggie into the next room. She recognized this patient\u2014Jacke. They were curled up on their bunk same as the first, breathing slow and soft, face relaxed in sleep.\nSerene.\nLucy slapped a strip onto their forehead out of habit, but didn\u2019t bother to look at her diagnostic\u2019s screen. Instead she started carefully hunting across Jacke\u2019s skin, searching until she found the two tiny marks on the back of their neck, where the trapezius flared out into the shoulder.\n\u201cTake both of them back to my trailer,\u201d she told Maggie, her voice soft, as if it mattered. Voices weren\u2019t going to wake either of these two, now.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2014\u201d Maggie said, but Lucy cut her off.\n\u201cTake them, and get everyone else out of this trailer. Then take it apart.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cTake the trailer apart,\u201d Lucy said, straightening, her eyes carefully searching the room. Dirty clothes, a slate, food wrappers. It could be anywhere, but Lucy didn\u2019t feel particularly afraid. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for a snake. Small, green, with yellow stripes.\u201d\n\u201cShit,\u201d Maggie said, her face pale beneath her pink hair. \u201cLike the one that bit Devon?\u201d\n\u201cJust like,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cJust like.\u201d\nTate couldn\u2019t shift Maggie this time, so now four of them stood in the med trailer, cabal+1, and Lucy figured it would be cabal plus everyone soon enough.\n\u201cYou said you boxed it.\u201d Tate\u2019s face was darker than usual, and his eyes were too bright as he watched the little serpent coil over itself in the jar that the workers had dropped it into before bringing it to the med-trailer. \u201cWhen you boxed Devon.\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cThen why am I looking at it?\u201d Tate turned his too-bright eyes onto Lucy, and she had a flash, just for a moment, of eyes rimmed by black cloth, familiar eyes made alien with fury and guilt, and she stepped back. \u201cWhy did it bite two more of my people?\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t let it go,\u201d Russ said, an unexpected defense that brought Lucy\u2019s eyes to him. Russ wasn\u2019t paying any attention to her though. He was staring through the glass walls of the jar, watching the snake with haunted eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one that keeps trying to convince me that she\u2019s crazy. How can you be sure?\u201d\n\u201cCrazy?\u201d Maggie stood between her bitten workers, lying silent on their beds between the two stasis boxes that Lucy had pulled out of the wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\nRuss ignored her, picking up a slate and tapping his fingers over it. \u201cCrazy, but not stupid. If she wanted to infect us, she could have done it a hell of a lot easier, and better. I need your approval for this.\u201d He handed the slate to Tate, and Lucy leaned over to peer at the screen. A list of security camera feeds, and she watched Tate press his thumb next to the one labeled medical.\nRuss took the tablet back, worked through a few menus, then flicked his fingers towards the wall. The projector in the ceiling flickered to life as the lights dimmed, and they were all staring at an image of the same trailer they were all standing in now. In the image, though, there was only one patient. Devon, Lucy recognized, his face locked in a rictus of pain, and she frowned at her own image, bending over him, running strips and taking samples before turning away to peer at a slate. On the bench behind her, a muddy bucket sat.\nTate looked away from the image to her, gauging her reaction, but Lucy ignored him. \u201cSpeed it up,\u201d she said, and Russ touched his slate. The image blurred, skimming ahead, and Lucy watched herself flash between patient and workbench and slate until\u2014\n\u201cStop,\u201d Tate snapped. \u201cBack it up.\u201d Russ obliged, and the image scrolled back and Lucy saw it too, flicking by in reverse, and she nodded. When Russ spun the video forward again at normal speed, they all watched the tiny snake slip over the edge of the bucket and fall to the floor behind her, a strangely truncated version of the animal caught in the jar before them.\n\u201cThe halves didn\u2019t heal together,\u201d she said. \u201cThey each became a new snake.\u201d She watched as the little serpent slipped forward, heading towards her, and she had to hold herself still, to keep from turning her head to see if there was something sneaking up on her now. On the wall, her past self kept working, oblivious, as the snake closed in. Then another figure stepped into the frame. Sammy, a plate of food in his hand, held out to her. Lucy watched her past self take the plate, her hand resting on Sammy\u2019s for a moment, while on the floor the snake curled around Sammy\u2019s ankle. When Sammy stepped away, holding a dirty plate with the remains of Lucy\u2019s previous meal still on it, the snake was still on him, thin body clinging to him as he stepped out of the trailer, dumping the garbage.\n\u201cSaved by your bot,\u201d Russ said.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Maggie glared at them. \u201cThat snake was cut in half. I saw it. And what the hell do you mean infect?\u201d\n\u201cMaggie, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Tate tried to start, but he couldn\u2019t pull it together. \u201cHow many?\u201d he said instead. \u201cJust those two? More? We\u2019ve only got four more stasis boxes. How many?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s your job, now.\u201d Lucy took the slate from Russ\u2019 hands, tapped the video off and lights snapped back bright. \u201cI\u2019m going to box these two and get the clinic ready. You\u2019re going to take Maggie out, and explain to her what\u2019s going on, and then you\u2019re both going to round everyone up and bring them here to get checked.\u201d\n\u201cChecked.\u201d Russ stepped away from the jar, and the snake that stared so calmly out at him. Sweat ran down his cheeks, and now his eyes were bright, flashing with fear. \u201cAnd what if we find it? What if we\u2019re too late, and somebody out there isn\u2019t really somebody anymore, what if they\u2019re\u2014\u201d He pulled himself short, stopping the hysterical flow of his words. \u201cI should have known, the minute you showed me what was happening to Devon. The horror story had already started, and there\u2019s no getting out. We\u2019re fucked.\u201d\nYes, Lucy thought. But there\u2019s nothing new about that. This horror story started long before this. Long, long before.\nBehind them, the door thumped and Tate and Maggie cursed, but Lucy pushed by them to help the men that were dragging another worker in with them.\n\u201cSnake bite?\u201d she asked, but as they laid him out she could see the signs, the silence, the slow, even breathing. These new victims weren\u2019t slipping into shock first, just falling straight into this sleep state. The nano, adapting?\n\u201cSnake? No,\u201d said one of the men. \u201cIt was that crow. Jim was feeding it and it pecked him in the hand good, drew some blood. We laughed, Jim laughed, then five minutes later he falls over. What the hell\u2019s going on, Doc?\u201d\n\u201cOh shit, the bird, of course it got the bird,\u201d Russ was groaning, but Lucy shut his words out.\n\u201cTate will explain it. Get everyone together in front of the contractor\u2019s trailer in five minutes.\u201d\n\u201cSecond shift just started\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEverybody,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cTate will explain.\u201d She looked over the unconscious man, stared up at the project manager, who was staring at nothing, sweat heavy on his forehead. \u201cMaggie, take Tate over there, make him talk to you. Make him talk to everyone.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Maggie said, taking Tate\u2019s arm. \u201cI can do that. C\u2019mon guys, you heard the Doc, let\u2019s go.\u201d The pink-haired woman dragged Tate out the door, and the other workers followed, asking her questions that Lucy didn\u2019t bother to hear.\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Russ said, staring after them.\n\u201cGo with. Help Tate explain.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to help that asshole,\u201d Russ said.\nLucy looked up from the man on the floor at Russ, standing like an abandoned mannequin in the middle of her trailer, useless and empty and taking up space. \u201cThen go catch that crow.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Russ said, his voice shaking.\n\u201cThen go to the rec trailer and screw the bots, you sad sack of shit. There\u2019s nobody else in line now.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like that,\u201d Russ snapped. He stepped toward her, all his fear flashing over to anger. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever talk to me like that. Sack of shit. Look at you! You were supposed to be looking out for this, stopping this, and what have you done, nothing!\u201d\nHe took a another step forward, his hands curling into fists, and Lucy felt the moment slipping, twisting, the room around her closing in, becoming that room, that room that she had the tile replaced in, that she had painted green and picked out towels to match, that room where a man in a mask with eyes that shone with anger had closed in on her, the knife in his hand shining in the light. She was in the bathroom again, and her hands twitched, waiting to feel the gun, waiting to feel the pain in her wrists from the recoil, waiting to smell the smoke and the blood, waiting to hear her name, her name, coming from the lips of the man in the mask, the man bleeding on the floor, the man whose voice was somehow Samuel\u2019s voice.\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\nSamuel\u2019s voice broke through the flashback, broke the vision into a thousand shards of mirror glass that flickered and vanished. Lucy was on the floor, the worker sprawled sleeping before her, Russ standing on the other side, fists raised, but staring at the figure that stood in the door that led to Lucy\u2019s quarters.\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Sammy said again, stepping into the room, his eyes calm, so calm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Russ said, his fist falling. \u201cYou\u2019re the sad one, the crazy one. Not me. You.\u201d Then he turned, and he was gone, leaving her in the trailer with the snake, the infected, and the thing that looked like the man Lucy had loved, had killed, and still loved in some horrible, stupid way.\nSammy watched him go, then he walked to her, held out his hand and helped her up.\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he said, that same question that he always asked, but his hands were on her face, wiping away her tears.\n\u201cI need,\u201d she said, her voice thick in her throat, the words almost too much. \u201cI need to see your ankle.\u201d\nThe conjugal rooms in the rec trailer stank of air freshener, but Lucy could still smell the astringent tang of disinfectant and the musky reek of sex beneath that flowery sweetness. Busy with her swabs and her slate, she tried to ignore the pungent tastes that filled the air of those padded cells as she moved from one bot to the other, collecting her samples, but it was hard. The smell of sweat and sex was the chemical memory of all those who had been here before her, sating themselves in the embrace of these machines.\nLucy stared at the face of the conjugal she had just sampled. The features of the bot were shifting, slowly rearranging themselves as the conjugal prepared itself for its next appointment, patiently shifting its anatomy from male to female. How many of the others had visited one of these rooms since that little snake had rode Sammy\u2019s ankle out of her trailer? She thought of the blood samples that she had taken, little drops harvested from everyone\u2019s fingers, and the column of red names that had run down her slate\u2019s screen when she had finished analyzing them.\nThirty-two people. Just over half the camp.\nAnd her.\nThe slate in her hand chimed, analysis complete, and Lucy checked its screen. The magnified image displayed the usual shapes of bacteria, protozoa, amoeba, a tiny sample of the vast zoo that filled everything, even the supposedly sterile saliva of the conjugals. Drifting through those soft blobs of life was something else, something that looked like a cross between a sperm cell and a squid, but with sharper angles.\nThe seeds of the nanotech infection that the serpent had brought them from its future.\nTheir future?\nLucy tapped the slate off and stared at the bot sitting quietly in front of her. Its change had finished, face and body settling into the variant of traditional female that its next user had selected, softly curved and forgettably attractive. Brown eyes, framed with long black lashes, stared unseeing at the wall, empty of everything.\nWhat was the nano doing to this machine? Lucy knew what she would find if she took the conjugal back to her trailer and scanned it. Besides the complicated seed factories surrounding the bot\u2019s saliva glands, there would be lines of nano running along every fiber-optic bundle. A whole new nervous system growing in parallel to the one that the bot\u2019s company had strung through its pseudotissue, running up through the plastic vertebrate to the complicated optic circuits of the bot\u2019s brain, winding around and growing into them like parasitic vines.\nShe knew because she had seen it before, in Sammy\u2019s scan.\n\u201cIs this you?\u201d she whispered, to the bot in front of her, to the infection that she had found growing inside her, slow and steady. \u201cAm I calm because of you? Is this what you do to us?\u201d\nAfter she had found the nano in Sammy, after she had tested her blood and scanned herself, she had looked at her brainwaves. They hadn\u2019t been as smooth as Devon\u2019s but they were getting there.\n\u201cIs this how you keep us from fighting you?\u201d Lucy reached out, took the bot\u2019s chin and raised its head, making its eyes meet hers. \u201cDo you make us . . . just accept this?\u201d\nThe bot stared at her and said nothing. She wasn\u2019t its next appointment. He wouldn\u2019t be along for ten more minutes. Lucy had checked the schedule when she had started these tests. The man coming next was already infected.\nThe woman that had stepped into the other conjugal\u2019s chamber after Lucy had finished testing it hadn\u2019t been. Not when she went in.\n\u201cShe is now though, and I could have stopped her.\u201d Lucy stared down at the bot, still holding its chin. \u201cI should have. That\u2019s my job, but I didn\u2019t. So was that you, or me?\u201d\nThe conjugal stared at her, eyes still empty. These two weren\u2019t made as well as Sammy. The only interactions they knew were based on lust. AI was still somewhere just beyond the horizon, just out of reach of all the researchers who kept promising that they would have it soon, soon, soon. Talking to a conjugal like this was as logical as expecting conversation from your toaster. But the nano in that snake had made it smart enough to go for Sammy, to go for these two, better vectors for spreading its infection. What was it doing to the bots?\nNothing it wanted to talk about, it seemed.\nLucy frowned at the bot\u2019s face, and for the first time she realized that she recognized the shape of the lips, the soft brown of the skin, the arch of the nose. This was her face, or as close as the bot could generate. The realization made Lucy snatch her hand away from the bot\u2019s chin, and she realized that the calm in her wasn\u2019t perfect, that it could be broken by fear. The bot had . . . No. Fear frayed away into irritation as she understood.\nLucy looked away from her almost twin to gather up her things. She stepped out of the tiny room into the noise and haze of the common room, hoping to cut around the crowd and out before anyone spoke to her, but beyond the door a man leaned against the wall, finishing his beer. Of course Russ would be here early, waiting for his next round with the machine beyond the door, the machine whose face he had chosen.\n\u201cDoc.\u201d Russ stood, blocking her path to the door. \u201cTired already of old man version 2?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cChecking disinfectant protocols.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, and the mocking look slipped from his face, replaced with anxiety, sloppily leashed. \u201cFind anything bad?\u201d\n\u201cNothing we need to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Russ\u2019 anxiety faded back into something uglier. \u201cJust remember, if you ever do get tired of that bot in your trailer\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already told you how interested I am in that idea,\u201d Lucy said, trying to calculate routes around the tech that involved the least amount of chair shoving and crowd jostling.\n\u201cOh, trust me, I\u2019m not interested anymore either,\u201d Russ said. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you knew that there was a strong market for second-hand conjugals, even bespoke models like that one. So if you ever do decided you\u2019re done with it, just put an ad up on the net, instead of shooting it. Unless that\u2019s a thing with you, now.\u201d\nLucy stopped her calculations and just started forward, raising a hand to shove Russ out of her way. But he stepped aside, letting her move past.\n\u201cWhen are you going to tell us about those test results?\u201d he called after her.\n\u201cAt the end of this shift,\u201d Lucy decided. \u201cWhich gives you 10 minutes.\u201d\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he said, shaking his head, but he didn\u2019t throw any more barbs out after Lucy as she stepped out into the gray light of limbo. Too worried about having time to finish to try to get in another dig, maybe.\nOr maybe it was the nano growing in him.\nAfter the meeting, after the shouting and the paranoia and the posturing, Lucy closed herself in her trailer, desperate for any solitude that she could find.\nIt didn\u2019t last, of course.\nMaggie came in the door after one knock, stepping into the room with a bob of her head. She looked at Sammy, standing behind Lucy as he rubbed her shoulders, then turned towards the last stasis box, sitting where Lucy had pulled it out. The others were all back in the wall, their lights green, their contents snapped into their own tiny limbos.\n\u201cIs that going to work?\u201d Maggie asked.\n\u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told that you have a bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve got a tech degree in electrical systems,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWhich is just as useful for trying to understand what Russ is up to.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt sounds good. If he sets it up right with the fuel cells, Russ should be able to expand the box\u2019s field to cover all of us.\u201d\n\u201cIf he sets it up right.\u201d Maggie walked over to the last stasis box, putting her hand on its smooth plastic side. \u201cHe set up those fail safes after that glitch that caused all this in the first place. Now we can\u2019t break out of limbo early. We\u2019re stuck here, with this disease for another month. Because he had to fix the system.\u201d\n\u201cRuss is the only one here who understands the temporal system,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cHe\u2019s also a self-absorbed ass. Which means he\u2019s all about saving his skin. But since we\u2019re in here with him, he\u2019ll try to save us too.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I guess you\u2019re right. If anyone was going to figure a way to weasel out of this mess, it would be him.\u201d Maggie drummed her fingers softly on the side of the box. \u201cThing is. Should we?\u201d\n\u201cGet out of this?\u201d\nMaggie nodded. \u201cThis nano epidemic. You don\u2019t know what it is, what it does, where it came from. Should we risk bringing it back? I\u2019ve got wives and kids, back in the world. Everybody\u2019s family is back there. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be so concerned about whether we\u2019re going to get back. Maybe it would be worse if we did.\u201d\nLucy reached up, touched Sammy\u2019s hands and they stopped, just resting on her. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what your plan is for?\u201d\n\u201cMy plan?\u201d Maggie dropped her hands from the stasis box\u2019s side. \u201cThe kill-it-with-fire-plan? Is that mine?\u201d\n\u201cIt was your suggestion,\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cAnd Tate sure ran with it, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Maggie turned to face her. \u201cHe\u2019s panicked about infection, and he wants out. Wants to get away from here, away from us. But he\u2019s panicked that he\u2019ll be blamed if this infection gets out into the world. Me and Russ, we\u2019re giving him his out.\u201d\n\u201cIt might work.\u201d The betrayal in those words cut unexpectedly deep. Lucy barely knew Maggie, but she liked her. What she was contemplating might destroy Maggie and her wives and her children. Lucy dropped her eyes, unable to look at the woman, looked at her hands and for a moment she saw blood on them, blood so vivid on her skin, on the tile, the mirrors . . .\nWe\u2019re all already destroyed, Lucy thought, shutting her eyes, trying to shut out the memory of blood, trying to shut out the panic attack that she could feel building in her. This . . . Maybe this . . . The panic pulled back, and whether that was because of Lucy\u2019s ragged hope or the nano growing along her nerves, she couldn\u2019t know.\n\u201cIt might not. I hooked the hydrogen and oxygen tanks from the fuel cells to the batteries from the equipment, broke every safety protocol in the books. Fifteen minutes after we go into stasis, this whole camp is going to go up. Everything outside the stasis field is going to fry, and that fire is going to use up almost every bit of oxygen in here.\u201d Maggie shook her head. \u201cIn the world, they\u2019re expecting a shiny new auto-drive compliant interchange. But when this limbo ends, all that\u2019s going to be here is a charred wasteland under a cloud of poisoned smoke with a jury-rigged stasis bubble inside.\n\u201cWhen the smoke clears, they\u2019ll come looking for us,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cThey\u2019ll find the data files we left for them, all sealed up in their black boxes. They\u2019ll see what happened to us, and then, what, they\u2019ll put us in a new bubble with some brave volunteers from the CDC? And some bioengineers?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Russ thinks,\u201d Lucy said.\n\u201cRuss has to think that,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cBecause as you said, he\u2019s a self-absorbed ass. He can\u2019t imagine the world going on without him. Me, I think they\u2019ll probably bury us under ten tons of cement. Or better yet, send us a million years into the future, return us to whenever that damn snake came from in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cThey might,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cActually, they probably will.\u201d\n\u201cSo why do this?\u201d Maggie demanded. \u201cWhy take the chance when we can just do that ourselves, and not risk going back?\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re human, and we\u2019re clever, but we\u2019re not really very smart.\u201d\nMaggie smiled, a tight smile that didn\u2019t hold any humor. \u201cClever, but not smart. That\u2019s a perfect description of our little plan. Are we really going to go through with it?\u201d\nLucy shrugged, her thumb stroking across the back of Sammy\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat else is there to do?\u201d\nThey packed into the Rec trailer, all of them, workers, engineers, skilled support, the bitten ones and the one snake who were already sealed in their little limbos, and another snake curled in a jar on the bar, watching them all with calm, unblinking eyes. Lucy stood near the bar, trying to emulate the serpent, trying to be calm in this jostling mass of people whose sweat stank of fear. Trying to be serene, and maybe she was, just a little, until someone pushed into her from behind.\n\u201cHey,\u201d she snapped, looking over her shoulder, but Maggie\u2019s pink hair and nervous face pulled her up short.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Maggie said, pulling the stub of a blunt from between her lips, smoke slipping out to join the fetid air hovering over the crowd. \u201cI just wanted\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThree minutes!\u201d Tate\u2019s voice rang over the crowd, followed by a second of silence, then echoed by nervous mutters.\nMaggie frowned and took another drag from her blunt. \u201cThis is a good idea, right?\u201d\n\u201cI never said that.\u201d\nMaggie\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cNo, you . . . \u201d she stopped and traded her words for a sigh, letting her anger roll out like smoke. \u201cNo. You didn\u2019t. Nobody said that, not even Russ.\u201d She ground the butt of her blunt out on the bar, beside the snake\u2019s jar. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring him.\u201d\n\u201cSammy?\u201d Lucy said, knowing the answer.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not human. Not real.\u201d Lucy looked at Maggie. \u201cYou know I know that, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s important to you, somehow. I thought, maybe, you wouldn\u2019t want him to burn.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about him.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you worried about?\u201d\n\u201cOne minute!\u201d\nIt was almost time, and Lucy had been hoping to spend this last minute, this one scrap of time contemplating the oblivion rushing toward her, and what might be on the other side. But she wasn\u2019t alone, was never alone, and Maggie was afraid, and she liked her. With the weight of knowing what she had done pressing down on her, Lucy couldn\u2019t push her away.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about us,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cAll of us, here, and in the world, and everything that comes after. I\u2019m worried that I think that I\u2019m being smart, when all I can be is clever. I\u2019m worried about what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done,\u201d Maggie said, taking her hand as the people around them began to count down, following Tate\u2019s lead, 10, 9, 8\u2014\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done.\u201d\nAnd then there was one, and nothing.\nBetween the trailers, beneath the gray, empty sky, the silence was almost complete. The equipment sat unmoving, trailer doors hung open, dust lay still on dry leaves of the few dead trees that still stood beside the interchange. There was only the low hum of the clock on the contractor\u2019s trailer, counting down from fifteen, and the quiet shuffle of feet across hard-packed dirt.\nSammy stopped in front of the clock, watching the numbers turn. 14:09, 14:08, a constant steady change. He ignored the jumble of equipment that lay wired together around the clock, the huge batteries of the earthmovers, the shining tanks of liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and watched the numbers turn. When they hit 14, he raised the slate he held in his hand and thumbed it on.\nThe screen flickered to life, Lucy\u2019s face centered in it. He stared at it, his programming sorting out the complex topography of her face, sorting it for clues to her disposition.\nResigned, he decided, and touched the screen, starting the message.\n\u201cSamuel. No.\u201d Lucy shook her head. \u201cSammy. You never were Samuel. You were just my crutch, something I could lean on and pretend.\u201d She raised a hand, rubbed it across her face.\nNervous tension, he decided.\n\u201cI want to say that this isn\u2019t about him, but it is.\u201d Lucy let her hand down staring somewhere to the left of the camera. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t started up with my sister, if he hadn\u2019t thrown away his career, his life. If he hadn\u2019t decided, somehow, that all of his problems, his misery, were my fault somehow, if he hadn\u2019t convinced himself that if he could only be rid of me, everything would work again.\n\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t put on that mask and picked up that knife.\u201d She stopped, breathing deep.\nFear, Sammy noted. Possible post-traumatic stress response.\n\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t bought that stupid gun years ago, just because he thought the ban might finally be going through.\u201d Lucy shrugged, her face smoothing out.\nNot long ago, that would have been too complicated for Sammy to label. Now though, it fit neatly into his pattern of her like a puzzle piece.\nDenial. Locking down of emotional state.\n\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t done that, I wouldn\u2019t be here. You wouldn\u2019t be here. And if this same thing had happened, well, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019d be doing. Probably this same stupid plan. And maybe it would work. But Samuel, he did do all those things, and here we are, in limbo with sixty other apes, all of us far too clever for our own good. Except now we\u2019ve wrapped ourselves in an extra layer of oblivion, so clever, and you\u2019re on the outside staring at the bomb that\u2019s supposed to solve all our problems.\u201d\nLucy sighed. Resignation, Sammy decided again, tempered by determination, and for a moment the smooth input of the world gliding by stuttered, was almost interrupted. Resignation. Determination. Similar but not the same. Equal or unequal? A glitch in Sammy\u2019s programming, one that had been coming more and more lately, but it flashed away as Lucy spoke again.\n\u201cHere. Look at this.\u201d Lucy held a card up to the camera, a schematic of wires and a set of instructions, then she pulled it away, set it down, and stared at nothing for a long while, and Sammy could not parse out an emotion. For a moment the glitch came back, an interruption in the steady flow of his programming, but again her words took it away.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll wonder why I did it, when they figure it out. That might be the only reason they would ever crack our bubble, just so they could drag me out and try to understand why.\u201d She smiled.\nRueful, Sammy decided.\n\u201cIf they do, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll tell them. I don\u2019t know if I owe them an explanation. But I owe you.\u201d Lucy stared at the camera now.\nSeeking attention, Sammy decided, and stared straight back.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are now. I just know that you\u2019re becoming something else. Something more like me? Maybe. Or maybe I\u2019m becoming something more like you. I don\u2019t know. I just know we\u2019re both changing, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. Why I\u2019m becoming the mother of this possible apocalypse.\u201d\nShe looked away from the camera, turned her head and Sammy couldn\u2019t read her emotions. Couldn\u2019t read them, and the glitch hit him again, and for the first time a dim understanding dawned in him of what the glitch was. It was a desire to know something he didn\u2019t know, a concept that best matched with a state his programming labeled curiosity.\nHe wondered why he had never had this glitch before.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to die, Sammy. I . . . \u201d Lucy broke off.\nPain, he decided.\n\u201cI\u2019ve killed one person. Someone I loved. And everyone tells me he deserved it, and I know, I know I would tell anyone else that did the same thing that, but god help me I hate it, it hurts so much, I hate having done that. I can\u2019t kill.\n\u201cNo one deserves to die. But we can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d\nLucy wiped at her eyes, stripping away the tears gathered there, and that was easy for Sammy to label as sadness, but he was beginning to think that there might be more there, to suspect that sometimes more than one emotion might be tangled in with the one that he was reading from her face.\n\u201cOur species, all of us. We\u2019re me and Samuel, over and over. Hurting ourselves and lying to ourselves and hurting ourselves again. And hurting ourselves trying to stop ourselves from hurting ourselves and god, this can\u2019t make any sense to you, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me except that this is what happens when a billion years of evolution converge in some poor clever ape\u2019s brain and tells them, be totally selfish, and you\u2019ll survive, be totally selfless, and your mates and your children will survive.\n\u201cIt has to stop. We have to change.\u201d Lucy looked back at the camera again, her face smooth.\nAnother lockdown, followed by determination.\n\u201cWill this make us better? I don\u2019t know. Maybe not. I can\u2019t be sure. But I watched Devon\u2019s brainwaves, and the others, before I put them in their boxes. Watched them changing into something I\u2019ve never seen before. The closest match the computer could come up with was meditation. People reaching some kind of Zen.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it start to happen with mine,\u201d she said, her voice almost a whisper.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is good, if this will make things right. If I\u2019m being smart, or just fucking clever.\u201d She wiped her eyes, tapped something on the slate that she was recording with, entering orders that flashed across the bottom of the screen now, below her image, a set of schematics and instructions.\n\u201cBut, somehow, we have to change.\u201d\nThe screen flickered out and went blank.\nSammy stared at it, but there was only his own reflection shining in the dark glass. Curiosity, he determined, then he twisted his hands, snapping the slate between them. Destroying the message.\nShe needed him to see it. Not anyone else.\nThere were footsteps behind him, and Sammy turned. The other two conjugals, beautiful and blank-faced, walked up to him. One had shaped itself male, the other female, and on the shoulder of the male the crow rode, black eyes shining.\n\u201cWe will make this good,\u201d the female said.\n\u201cWe will make this right,\u201d the male said, and the crow beat its wings, launching itself from his shoulder to Sammy\u2019s.\n\u201cThis is what she needs. For us to change. All of us.\u201d The words left Sammy\u2019s mouth, and he touched the dark scales of the bird\u2019s leg, rested his fingers there while the information flowed. Then he pulled his hand and the crow took flight again, landing on the clock that was at seven minutes now, counting down steady. It bent its head, seized the wire that had been highlighted in the schematics, and pulled it free.\nBeneath it, the clock stopped, then went blank.\n\u201cSomehow,\u201d the crow croaked, and took off, beating its wings and circling through the air. Sammy lifted his eyes and watched it go, waiting. Someday soon, the sky would be blue again, and the world would return, and then, and then . . .\nHe wondered, what would happen then?\nCuriosity, he thought, followed by contemplation. Calmness.\nSerenity."}

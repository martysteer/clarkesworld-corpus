Instead, he\u2019s sitting at a desk, half-buried in books. Your contact introduces him as the Professor. You tear open your jacket lining to extract the envelope, containing millions of francs for the Resistance\u2014and most importantly, the filter paper containing the encrypted plasmids\u2014and he takes them like this is an everyday occurrence. He asks for the latest news from London. Then he asks how your journey was.\n\u201cFine,\u201d you say, not quite sure if he understands that last night you jumped out of a plane and parachuted through darkness, expecting to be machine-gunned at any moment.\n\u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d\nFor some reason, as the bistro empties, you end up telling him your entire life story. Really it can be summed up in one word: fight. Fighting your parents, fighting your tormentors, which got you kicked out of school, fighting in the war, against the invasion, and now against the occupation. He just listens as you work yourself up, telling him you\u2019re going to fight until you\u2019re standing on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, watching the enemy be crushed into dust.\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cThen?\u201d you repeat.\n\u201cWhat will you do once the war is over?\u201d\nThe question disturbs you because you\u2019ve never thought of after the war.\n\u201cI need a DNA decoder,\u201d he says. \u201cWill you be my assistant?\u201d\nEveryone in the Lyon network calls him the Professor because they assume he must\u2019ve been one before the war. All that remains of his lab now is an incubator and a battered gel apparatus. Both much older than the equipment you glimpsed in London, in the underground complex you picked up the plasmids from. The enemy intercepts radio messages regularly, the Prof explains, but has not even begun to suspect DNA. Much less the biologists, the musty back rooms where, among jars of flies and stacks of Petri dishes, research goes on in its own way.\nA drop of water over a dark spot on filter paper extracts a plasmid. A circle of DNA that multiplies in flasks of bacteria, instructs the growing microorganisms. It takes a practiced hand to complement the plasmids from London with the right genes. The dried dots, hidden on postcards in the Prof\u2019s library. He shows you how to induce bacteria to take up DNA with a hot water bath, or an electrical shock. How to find the combinations that will teach them to diverge, to spread, to do their work, to consume the plasmids when recaptured, as if exhaling a breath of air.\nFrom the countless people you meet in the traboules of Lyon, who you slip tubes of altered bacteria to, you learn of the Prof\u2019s true role in the Resistance. London speaks to him. Every decision goes through him. He is the focal point, the eye of the hurricane.\nAnd he insists you do science throughout it all.\nFor cover, he tells you. There must be a reason to have all this equipment in this rented room. Yet there\u2019s no reason to be that convincing, you think. Surely the simplest of pretexts would suffice. But the Prof asks you to unravel networks as complex as the Resistance itself. How plasmids act in combination. Which traits dominate others. How genomes grow and shrink, taking up certain pieces of DNA while rejecting others. What bits of DNA bacteria cling onto, no matter what. What aspects of their life cycles can be explained in terms of DNA, what cannot.\n\u201cI see that these questions truly interest you,\u201d he tells you when you grow frustrated at the experiments. When you discuss the data, which seems to have no bearing on real life, he smiles that way he always has. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer either. We\u2019ll have to keep thinking.\u201d\nSo despite yourself, you think of DNA. In those long hours on train platforms, waiting for contacts, sitting in caf\u00e9s. One strand of DNA, over a lifetime, can make a million messenger RNAs. Each RNA becomes a protein that can exact a function. In the same way, each plasmid from London gets decoded, distributed to each Resistance movement, multiplied. Each becomes a slightly different strain of microorganism. The kind that can chew through the metal hulls of tanks. Or make an entire gestapo office sick for weeks at a time. Many years later, this Central Dogma will be reflected, reversed, overturned. But it is everything to you back then.\nAlong with those hours you spend walking beside the Prof, scribbling notes, or memorizing his instructions in some restaurant or caf\u00e9. The glint of his glasses as he turns toward you. There\u2019s an impassable abyss between you. But you feel, as long as he walks one step ahead, there will always be a way forward. For the Resistance. For all of France.\nA year passes and you can\u2019t imagine living any other way than this. Decoding, experiments, sleeping, waking, meeting contacts, movement leaders, receiving, messages, demands, passing on, money, plasmids\u2014running into the Prof at a carefully decided time each day, as if by chance. He\u2019s been called to Paris, he tells you. For an important meeting. You nod. It\u2019s always hard in his absence, especially when things go wrong. Which they have been more and more often lately. He asks you about the gene regulatory network you\u2019ve been investigating. You tell him it makes no sense, and he smiles. He says that there\u2019s a library of genes in his old university, the largest in the world, that they\u2019re mapping the human genome. He\u2019ll take you to see it after the war\u2019s over. That\u2019ll be your way of celebrating the Liberation.\nThe day he\u2019s due to arrive back in Lyon you wait for him at the train station, like always. Instead one of your contacts leaps out before the doors open all the way and runs over to you. It takes her several seconds to catch her breath.\n\u201cThe Professor. Arrested.\u201d\nThe words stab into your very being. You collapse onto a bench. You can\u2019t comprehend it. One day we were talking. And then, in a flurry of encrypted plasmids, missives, meetings and conferences, fake IDs\u2014he was gone. Yet it is not an uncommon occurrence. Every day someone doesn\u2019t show up, someone goes missing. Only you thought it would be everybody else. You thought it would be you. Never him. The Prof is invincible. He\u2019s the spirit of discovery, of science itself. How could the gestapo have someone like that at their mercy?\n\u201cHe would\u2019ve wanted you to keep decoding,\u201d your contact goes on, white-knuckled, \u201cto make sure the plasmids from London get to the right people. That they mutate in the right ways. You\u2019re the only one who can keep the Resistance running while we figure out what to do next. Go on like nothing happened at all. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll avenge him.\u201d\nI don\u2019t feel anything, you tell yourself as you pipette like an automaton, as your fantastical rescue plans abruptly fade. They will come for me next, and I will join him. A day trickles by, consumed by plasmid purification, endless passing on of the news. It doesn\u2019t become real until you have to go meet one of the Prof\u2019s contacts yourself. She was an old colleague of his, you speculate. At least you never met her without him at your side. Seeing you alone, the look on your face, she immediately knows.\n\u201cAh,\u201d she sighs. \u201cSo he\u2019s gone too.\u201d\nYou sit in silence.\n\u201cAll he knows, he will take with him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe will take himself to the grave.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe was arrested once before. He knows torture. He will do anything to protect you.\u201d\nThen your tears come.\nThe Prof once told you that he doesn\u2019t believe in anything after death. It\u2019s impossible, he said, knowing the inner workings of the cell. How similar we all are at the molecular level to every other living being. DNA, RNA, protein. Impossible to believe that even the darkest corners of the human soul will not also eventually be explained in terms of DNA, protein, RNA. Yet that is also what makes life very beautiful. This cruelty, this fragility, this fact that all biological processes must invariably end.\nThe Resistance is over for you then. You carry out your duties for the Prof\u2019s successor. It goes on for a year or two and, maybe in some small part due to your actions, the war ends. You are on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, not watching your enemies crumple to dust, but very drunk. The celebrations fade, the war fades, the Resistance fades into something so ludicrous you can hardly talk to anybody about it.\nYou do become a molecular biologist. Those questions the Prof planted in you, they took root\u2014did he know they would?\u2014grew into research papers, colleagues, a lab, and ever more questions, as things in biology always do. Patiently, you wait for the Prof\u2019s identity to be revealed. You assume that he will be someone in the very highest echelons of science, someone worthy of the entire world\u2019s veneration. That\u2019s why you\u2019re surprised to learn, by chance, that he was nobody. You want to forget. Still. You hear his voice in the papers of his you read, published before the war. In his former students that you meet at conferences, who instinctively include you among them.\nIt\u2019s on your way to them, years later in Lyon, past that train station where you always used to meet him, that you see a familiar smile.\nYou drop your phone.\nIt\u2019s your imagination, of course. Just an amalgamation of different faces in the crowd. Someone\u2019s suit, a pair of glasses, a blue scarf. All people who might not be here now, it occurs to you, if it hadn\u2019t been for the Prof, and the Resistance\u2014and you.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d your friends say when you reach them. They make room for you around their caf\u00e9 table, they order you a coffee. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when you start talking. You talk and talk. About how you lived back then. How lonely it was. How cold and dark. How once, while walking with him, you saw a pelican land on a bridge parapet, overlooking the city. The crest of his old university, the Prof told you, an absolute symbol of self-sacrifice, of grief, of healing. You talk until you can\u2019t talk anymore, and you know when you\u2019ve run out of things to say, finally, you will write."}

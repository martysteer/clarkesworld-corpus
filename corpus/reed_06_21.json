A baby moggie had fallen inside one of the nearby recycling hubs. Of course the children hurried outside to see, and being noble souls, they dragged the half-suffocated creature out of the garbage. But the rescue had barely begun. Social agencies needed to be alerted. Whose baby was this, and why would they abandon the poor thing? DNA identified a local couple as parents, but tragically, those moggies had died days earlier in a fire that might or might not have been arson. The Venerable police claimed to be investigating, but there were no viable leads, and they didn\u2019t care to offer explanations for why the public security AIs had failed, or how that little orphan managed to crawl past each of the hub\u2019s safety hatches.\nAs a courtesy, the household received a comprehensive list of public orphanages. In addition, private shelters made bids to raise the child. But moggie babies, particularly those from wicked circumstances, demanded heroic amounts of developmental help. The best facilities would accept her only if suitable donations were made, and this particular Family already knew too well what it was like to have their good hearts abused.\nWhy not keep the girl here instead?\nNot only the children asked that question. Several adults, charmed by this pretty little Venerable, admitted that the household had lived too long without a moggie. That\u2019s why they officially adopted her. Wetware lawyers appealed to the courts. Digital forms were filled out and filed. The Family\u2019s very public intention was to spoil the girl with long baths, rich food, and pristine water. Add to that some significant pampering from attentive machines, plus the occasional hard affection from the children. And because every moggie deserved to be literate, the precious girl was taught to speak, read, and write a simple but very respectable language.\nFrench. One of the original Earth tongues was picked for the very best reason: The Father of All\u2019s ancestors came from that tiny patch of left-behind ground.\nAI teachers settled on a Parisian French\u2014a particularly lofty strain of that utterly extinct tongue.\nPoubelle. That\u2019s what the children named their moggie. A lovely word to certain ears, and descriptive too.\n\u201cPoubelle\u201d meant \u201ctrash can.\u201d\nFor six thousand days, one Venerable human lived in the rarest moggie heaven. A massaging bed dominated her spacious warm room. She had toys and tutors, libraries, and a full wardrobe. Her daily clothes included clumsy, brightly colored costumes worn without complaint. But she was allowed to dress herself too. Like tonight. For her own fine reasons, she had put on trousers and slippers and a tight-fitting red shirt. Talking dolls and mathematical puzzles begged to be played with. She ignored them. With her Family scattered, she stood alone, waiting impatiently beside one of the home\u2019s minor portals. An ear that had been called \u201cjolie\u201d was pressed against what wasn\u2019t a true door. Muted sounds drifted in from the outdoors. Animal wails, animal singing, and once, in the distance, a feral moggie cursing some grave injustice.\nNone of those noises mattered. What she wanted arrived with a sudden stillness, the nearby world abruptly closing its many mouths.\nOf course it might not be Him. After all, the world was full of dangerous souls, and the moggie had learned how to swallow her hopes.\nBut the silence ended with a familiar voice, low in timbre, very close, using a language so much harsher than Old French. And after the final yip, he added, \u201cTrash can.\u201d\nOpening her purse, Poubelle checked on her money and the little revolver, then pulled the long knife from the hilt riding her belt.\nA convincing smile filled that pretty teenage face. Then came the plea, \u201cI want to be outside. And I promise, promise to be very, very careful.\u201d\nEveryone heard her. Nobody reacted.\n\u201cPlease please please,\u201d she kept calling out.\nYet nothing happened. As expected. Brandishing the knife, she began to strike what wasn\u2019t a door and would never show damage. But futile gestures helped to remind others that she was feral-born, and when frantic, she was likely to harm herself with that nickel-steel blade.\nThe children spoke among themselves. These were Perpetuals, and Poubelle would never learn more than a few words of their dense, thoroughly contrived language. But her smiles and piercing screams had their own meaning. Those young gods couldn\u2019t ignore the caterwauling, and that\u2019s why an older child known as Fret made a special trip to open the portal for silly Poubelle.\nA long grove of Haumea walnuts filled that portion of the yard, and in the shadows, standing tall, was a wild reynard.\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he called out.\nIn the shrill tongue of great predators.\n2\nPerpetuals were the rarest people. Born rich and immortal, they came into life bearing lofty, ridiculously intricate names. The lucky few were able to choose shorthand designations. Brief, crisp, perfect. But most of the common names came out of random nonsense. Like a certain child who complains about dangers nobody else can see\u2014mortal hazards that don\u2019t exist today and likely never will. Barely more than a baby, the girl relentlessly bombarded her Family with outlandish scenarios, even when older siblings teased her for being ridiculous. Then one day, an exasperated grand-great-mother said, \u201cOh my, you\u2019re such a fret, Fret.\u201d A single offhand remark, but that proved to be a decisive moment, and that\u2019s why the girl was called Fret today and might be for the next one hundred billion years.\nSome children rebelled against their labels.\nNot this one. Not only did she accept the syllable, but Fret embraced her role as the Family\u2019s official pessimist. Just a few hundred years old, half-grown, and knowing nothing but joy and enlightenment, Fret continued to conjure up despairs enthusiastically shared with everyone she loved.\n\u201cDefine these mortal hazards,\u201d her siblings demanded.\nWith many of the adults listening on the sly.\n\u201cWhat are you so afraid of, Fret?\u201d\nClear, easy-to-refute scenarios should be avoided. That\u2019s what the girl learned early on. And to always project confidence while dispensing her warnings.\n\u201cOur enemies are gathering,\u201d she might say. \u201cRight now, over the horizon, they\u2019re plotting against the Family. Against me.\u201d\n\u201cBut there aren\u2019t any horizons,\u201d the littlest babies complained. \u201cWe see everywhere and everyone. Always and forever.\u201d\nOf course adults and the older children knew what she meant. \u201cThe horizon\u201d was an expression, and even the most formidable eye had limitations.\nSomeone always attacked Fret with old logic and happy numbers.\n\u201cSo how old is our world?\u201d they asked.\nA precise birthdate existed. \u201cTwenty million years and an afternoon,\u201d was the girl\u2019s sarcastic answer.\n\u201cAnd how long have we been in this world?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty million years, minus a few mornings.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who are \u2018we?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHumanity.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here, just in this one new world . . . how many human species peacefully coexist?\u201d\nThere was a precise count, but it was more important to irritate her audience. \u201cJust two of us,\u201d Fret said. \u201cThe mortals, and us.\u201d\nPerpetuals didn\u2019t like the word, \u201cMortal.\u201d In the wrong circumstance, they were just as mortal as anyone else. \u201cVenerables\u2019\u2019 was the title given to that multitude of human-based species sporting wet brains and brief life spans. Trillions of them shared this world and the rest of the solar system with a few million bioceramic minds. They were the ageless, durable Perpetuals . . . except of course none of them, not even the Father of All, was truly and forever invincible.\nSay what you want about Fret\u2019s ravings, the girl told gripping stories packed with rich details and just enough plausibility. \u201cThe status quo only looks strong,\u201d she often claimed. Then she would imagine prophets or new human species who would unite the Venerables. Or she\u2019d describe some minor injustice that would create a chaotic mob, and that mob would attack them with plasma torches and fission bombs. And worst of all? The Venerables would drag this smug Family out of their mansion, then strip them of their ridiculous wealth.\nApocalyptic stories were fun to hear and fun to dismiss.\nAnd Fret\u2019s motives always deserved to be attacked.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe your own words,\u201d she was told. \u201cThis is nothing but fun for you. This is your favorite game. Isn\u2019t that right, little one?\u201d\nMaybe yes, maybe no. But Fret\u2019s beliefs belonged to her, and she insisted on keeping them secret.\nOn the best days, a frustrated grand-great would come forward, unveiling the latest society model and n-dimensional forecasts. \u201cSee? We are loved. You are safe. So shut up please, darling.\u201d This kind of information was normally kept away from children, and it was fascinating stuff. Tax policies. Bribe policies. Welfare rivers, plus advertising campaigns. With comprehensive tallies of the solar system\u2019s resources, present and future, proving that trillions more Venerables could live well enough, with a billion Perpetuals overseeing this very disciplined chaos.\n\u201cAs long as there is a Creation,\u201d said those self-assured voices, \u201cthis is where we will stand.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when does the Creation end?\u201d Fret asked.\n\u201cA trillion days from today,\u201d was one stubborn answer.\nNo doubt about it, elaborate plans were at work. The human colonists\u2014both varieties\u2014had cobbled together a civilization leaning hard on caste systems and the proven rules of ecology. And the foundation beneath everything? Confidence. Every adult confidently assured her that the plan was proven and perfect. Doubt was nothing but a childhood disease, and that\u2019s why the girl couldn\u2019t sleep happily through the night. Believe it or not, she would grow out of this affliction, living a happy life that would end just short of Forever.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Fret often said.\n\u201cSo prove us wrong,\u201d they said.\nThere were many reasons worth mentioning. Important points of concern and lesser troubles that kept changing rank from day to day. But good ideas didn\u2019t matter to entities far older than one baby girl. And while the girl realized that she didn\u2019t know everything, she also remembered that when set against a universe rich with knowledge and experience, these smug adults knew just a little more than she did.\nThat\u2019s what terrified Fret most of all.\n\u201cCling to whatever nightmare you want,\u201d the others told her. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t diminish what is real.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said the fearful child.\nLetting them see her tremble.\n3\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Trash can called out.\nA security shimmer clung to the girl, and then she pulled free. Except there was no leaving the mansion behind. Where the Perpetuals lived, surfaces and pets were scrubbed to a micro-sterile level. What the girl carried was the distinct odor of nothing\u2014empty hair, sanitary breath, and ass scrubbed clean by eager machines. There was also the question of her health, which was considerable and peculiarly attractive. The reynard always suffered a stubborn longing for this creature . . . urges a little sexual and more than a little parental . . . and which of those instincts was worst . . . ?\nMoggies were ancestral enough to pass for an Earthly human.\nWhile the reynard was something else entirely.\nUsing the City\u2019s ruling dialect, he called her, \u201cTrash can.\u201d\n\u201cMy reynard,\u201d she replied, in his language.\nOffering the most human piece of himself, his right hand claimed her little hand, shaking it vigorously\u2014a politeness taught to her when they first met, and now a tradition that always made her grin and laugh.\nShe was a predictable ape, and he would never stop appreciating that.\n\u201cWhere tonight?\u201d was her standard first question.\nGenuine nights didn\u2019t exist for this world.\n\u201cHunting, then different fun,\u201d he promised.\nBut first, they had to escape the heirloom trees. The reynard despised the darkness under these massive branches and the hard black nuts rumored to be delicious but not belonging to him. The City beyond was his home, his garden. Leading her past the last demon wall, they emerged into a vibrant, fabulous landscape\u2014plastic buildings and glass needles pushing high, while a trillion kilometers of catacombs lay underfoot. By day, the dwarf sun was a faint smear of heat encased inside solar collectors and flare collectors. But the sun had just set, ten billion bright windows helping to light the scene, helped along by advertisements targeting the vulnerable and spotlights deployed by public police and private militias. Except nobody dared to try selling insurance to the reynard, or to question his movements, or in any way risk his anger. That\u2019s because he was a considerably important human. Not a thousandth as powerful as any Perpetual, but still an authentic lord marching with purpose through this gorgeous pasture.\n\u201cHunting\u201d was exactly what it always had been. The prey were small, cautious bodies left vulnerable between hiding places. Chasing them was Trash can\u2019s joy, and she was rather good at it. Hard shouts and slashing gestures with her toy knife were enough to scare most victims. Like tonight. A mated pair of hamish gophers panicked, running exactly where they were expected to run, into a sub-ground runway, straight at the other half of this effective team.\nThe reynard didn\u2019t need knives or noise. His famous face is his weapon, delivering a reputation built over the years. Yes, these little souls could turn and run away again, and one of them might escape. But that left the spouse to suffer untold miseries, and they were a loving couple. Neither would abandon the mate, and seeing the reynard, they accepted their shared doom.\n\u201cStop,\u201d he said.\nInstantly, yes.\n\u201cKneel.\u201d\nTo the pavement, knees, and pursed lips too.\n\u201cAnd beg for your next breaths.\u201d\nNot that they were physically endangered. Reynards were capable of murder, but nobody this small could ever be in mortal danger. Harassments. That\u2019s what the gophers were afraid of. Legal maneuvers. Evil gossip wrapped in the worst kinds of truth. Those were the looming fates, and their enthusiastic begging was well underway when Trash can grabbed them from behind, shaking their little necks.\nA few moments later, two hunters emerged from the runway with the single key to a well-stocked locker. Common foods and sweetened water became a dinner enjoyed by the moggie, tolerated by the reynard, and then after marking the locker\u2019s corners with their fragrant urine, they took a capcar to the next adventure.\nThe girl\u2019s favorite club was popular with raptors, reynards, and other high carnivores. A few moggies were allowed to watch the fun from the back hallways, but only one moggie was welcomed on the dance floor. Bottled aviaries sang tunes that would be old next week, forgotten next month, then rediscovered in ten or fifty years.\nOne splendid raptor guided Trash can across the dance floor, his ceremonial wings spread wide, leaving the reynard free to move where he needed to be, taking care of various bits of business.\n\u201cSuccess never ends,\u201d the great proverb warns. And it was well worth adding, \u201cOnly the fool takes these words as a comfort.\u201d\nThe tiny newborn sun was on the other side of the world when his moggie came off the dance floor to find him.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she announced.\n\u201cAnd thirsty,\u201d he guessed.\n\u201cSomewhere quiet,\u201d she said.\nHe named an even more exclusive business where pure water was mixed with a multitude of joyful drugs.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.\nHe said, \u201cThis way.\u201d\nThey left through a lesser doorway, emerging on a street that she had never walked before. Yet there was nothing but confidence in her stride. The late-hour wilderness stood around them, never quiet but plainly resting. Two hundred million sentient residents lived in this corner of the First World: Prey and predators, thoughtful AIs and idiot machines. And there was also one towering structure filled with Perpetuals. Which, from the reynard\u2019s point of view, was one tower too many.\nIf only scaring the gods was as easy as scaring a couple gophers.\nWishes and success. When hasn\u2019t life been defined by those two measures?\nWalking behind the moggie, the reynard used French.\n\u201cPoubelle.\u201d\nShe turned, taking a backward step before stopping entirely. Then in that extinct, half-lovely language, she asked, \u201cVous connaissez Francais?\u201d\nHe knew her language better than she spoke his, yes.\nNow the reynard whispered more words, but not in French.\n\u201cI have her, right here, in my sights.\u201d\nThe girl smiled, stubbornly ignoring what she heard and the obvious dark tone.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the moggie now,\u201d he said.\nHer smile vanished. From her purse, that little predator pulled out a savage pretend gun. A gift from the gods, supplied more for their comfort than as a precaution . . . and the poor girl didn\u2019t even suspect that her weapon had been disabled.\nThe reynard said nothing.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. In both of their languages.\nFor the first time, the reynard placed his less-human hand against her shoulder, and he pressed down until he had proved just how strong he was and how weak she would always be.\n4\nPoubelle didn\u2019t come home by morning.\nFret was the first to worry, which was entirely reasonable. Better than her siblings, she appreciated those archaic curves and holes, including that mostly lovely, sometimes overly loud voice. But most of all, Fret had opened the portal, letting the girl run wild in a world full of teeth and rage.\n\u201cWe need to find her,\u201d she declared.\nThe house AIs reworked that appeal, subtracting Fret from the solution. \u201cWe\u2019ll look for our moggie.\u201d\n\u201cMy moggie,\u201d she said.\nA statement wisely left unchallenged. Drones and smart flies were tossed into the atmosphere. A trillion public conversations, recorded as a matter of habit, reconstructed portions of the girl\u2019s final evening. The last sighting? On an obscure public street, the reynard grabbing Poubelle against her will . . . and with that, the Family\u2019s high eyes reached across the First World. But with strict limitations in place. The landscape in question was unwelcoming and shrouded in ancient laws. Yes, inconveniences like that could be set aside, but only if an adult Perpetual saw important or convenient reasons. The AIs refused to make any request involving \u201cour moggie.\u201d Indeed, a final, far more critical issue had to be addressed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re certain you know this. But by the Codes of Self-awareness, Poubelle is considered to be an emancipated adult.\u201d\nFret was studying multiple rivers of data, but she had cognitive resources to hear the insult riding inside that flat statement.\n\u201cOn the other hand, you aren\u2019t grown up,\u201d the machines were reminding her. \u201cThus, your freedoms don\u2019t match the moggie\u2019s freedoms.\u201d\nFret closed her eyes.\n\u201cThat reynard,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows where Poubelle is.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot find him,\u201d the AIs warned.\n\u201cLook deeper.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no \u2018deeper,\u2019 Fret. We\u2019re at our limits here.\u201d\n\u201cBut Poubelle is in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a sentient organism with inalienable rights, and we must respect those rights. We know you don\u2019t want to hear this\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d\n\u201cLittle Miss Trash can is an emancipated citizen of the world.\u201d\n\u201cExcept she lives here.\u201d\n\u201cExcept when she leaves us. Which is almost every evening, as of late.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s my moggie,\u201d Fret insisted.\nThe machines responded with a unified chorus. \u201cFirst, let\u2019s mention how slavery is not permitted. Legally speaking, our household has graciously supplied refuge to a helpless orphan, and each of us should be commended for enduring her shit and her singing. But she\u2019s mature now. Emancipated. According to every court, she can do whatever she wants to do, with whomever she chooses.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s inside a deep hole. Hurt.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly yes, but as a consequence of entirely free actions. And in this scenario, you have no responsibilities.\u201d\nFret had stopped asking an army of sensors for more data. She had found what she needed, and her next step was to tell the house, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll stop worrying about my missing friend.\u201d\nThe house had to recognize the lie. But then again, Fret didn\u2019t need to be believed. She was the clear master in this relationship, free to tell any lie before doing exactly what she wanted to do.\nSlipping into another portion of the house, she closed portal tubes and security shimmers before assembling what she needed. First, a collection of intriguing gifts that would prove tempting to reynards and other crime bosses. And second, she designed a sophisticated hull with enough room inside to hold the soul of one mostly grown-up Perpetual.\nBold actions always made Fret happy, particularly when she knew that she was right.\nPoubelle\u2019s portal gave way with a touch. Would anyone care enough to try and stop her? She hoped so. In one elaborate daydream, Fret\u2019s immediate parents stood in her path, listing the ways she was sentimental and ridiculous, and then she lectured them about how evil they were, living among all of these impoverished, badly ignored cousins.\nBut nobody took the trouble to intervene.\nFret found herself outdoors, standing motionless in the shade of walnut trees\u2014a grove built to thrive in this half-G gravity and the deep, rigorously terraformed atmosphere. Behind her, the great house was a column of premium hyperfiber bathed in soft white light, its foundation reaching into a mantle still being born, while its roof punched through the atmosphere\u2019s diamond ceiling.\nWhenever she left home, Fret felt extra alive. She had no reason to be afraid; the law and her own invincibility always kept her safe. But then again, that\u2019s why the moggie amazed her so much. A corporeal little girl like that, small and weak in every dimension, yet when night came, Poubelle could become frantic, desperate to escape from the safest realm in existence.\n\u201cHow could I ever be so brave?\u201d Fret asked the final tree.\nThen one more step was taken, and to every eye she looked like another pretty and very young little moggie.\n5\nAnother window had been pushed open, but instead of offering a yard full of walnut trees, this window left the galaxy within humanity\u2019s reach.\nThe Great Ship made that possible. Millions of years ago, Fret\u2019s ancestors discovered a world-sized starship, abandoned and free for the taking. Every intelligent species was welcome to ride inside the Ship\u2019s luxurious quarters. All they had to do was surrender wealth, knowledge, and maybe a few empty worlds. With one stroke of good fortune, humanity found herself in a golden age. Yet just a thousand centuries later, with no warning whatsoever, the Great Ship was stolen and then taken out of the galaxy, accelerating toward the Virgo Cluster.\nThat one fine window had been slammed shut.\nYet humanity continued to thrive. Rich colony worlds built new starships that followed the galaxy\u2019s spiral arms. Empty worlds and difficult worlds were claimed and terraformed, and once those places filled up, subsequent generations went out searching for fresh challenges. Some colonies failed quickly. Other settlements died over the aeons. But there were spectacular successes, enough to make the Milky Way into a human paradise, and that was true even when the Great Ship had become little more than legend.\nOne unusually ambitious boy was born in a crowded world.\nHe had an intricate long name and a childhood nickname, but at some point he began to call himself, \u201cThe Father of All.\u201d\n\u201cI want a solar system of my own,\u201d he said.\nIn that, not an uncommon dream.\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t fantasy. I have a plan.\u201d Then he would explain portions of his plan, offering just enough to make most people laugh at him or simply walk away.\nBut a few of his peers said, \u201cYes, why not?\u201d\nWhy not? Because The Father of All was an impoverished nobody among the immortals. And his followers were the same, or worse. Between them, they couldn\u2019t afford a third-hand tug, much less the necessary machinery to terraform one home out of a dead bolide. But there were thriving Venerable communities on several nearby worlds. These were humans who refused bioceramic brains and immortality, who lived for two or three busy centuries and then happily fell into an old age defined by dignity and celebration. In addition, the Venerables had inventive habits and frugal natures, and because of that, they not only could afford a suitable starship, they could equip it with the tools necessary to rebuild dozens of worlds.\nThat\u2019s where the Father found his funding. An empty solar system was identified, a substantial comet was encased in hyperfiber and rockets, and then adventurous Venerables took their aging bodies into liquid argon baths, expecting to be awakened on the new home, perhaps in just another thousand years.\nAnd that\u2019s how one man\u2019s dream became real.\nWith a crew of loyal followers, The Father of All aimed for the proposed colony worlds. But he kept moving. The populated heart of the galaxy was abandoned. The Father aimed at a thread of dust and star grit that had only just begun to collapse on itself. A weather forecast. That\u2019s what guided him. Measuring the push of radiation and the tug of gravity, he could drift into this very empty place, waiting with a patience found only with the most gifted or most crazed souls.\nFor the sake of their health, the Venerables were eventually brought out of hibernation, and when told about the ultimate plan, they screamed.\nBut what could be done?\nThey went back into the frigid argon, and they were awakened again, allowed to breathe and scream before surrendering to the situation all over again.\nBy and large, Venerables are talented at facing ugly inevitables.\nBesides, the immortal asshole kept promising to honor their agreement.\nTwenty thousand centuries had to pass before a suitable solar system was born. By then, the Great Ship had vanished between the galaxies, never to return. Humanity was an infestation still racing across the Milky Way. And one self-named human set himself up as a king and god and ultimate father, overseeing an empire that consumed the terrestrial baby worlds, then every other planet and moon and shard of ice orbiting around an M-class sun that burned softly, ready to endure for another hundred billion years.\n6\nThe girl stood in line like every hopeful moggie. Dressed for dancing, armed with a pistol and two hypodermic crossbows, she was pretending patience while waiting for her chance to step inside.\nThe club\u2019s manager was an old raptor long-retired from hard work. This job was a plum given to someone who had proven to be loyal and trustworthy, and she didn\u2019t welcome uninvited hazards waiting at her door.\nShe woke the reynard with the news.\nHe sat up, stood up. Dressed. Looked at the feeds.\n\u201cWhich god is it?\u201d she asked.\nHe offered a piece of the whole name, then said, \u201cFret.\u201d\n\u201cJust as you predicted,\u201d she said.\nAnd he responded by reminding her, \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of forecasts here.\u201d\nThey were half a kilometer below the club, inside a catacomb shielded by the best Venerable deceptions. Pounding the ashes out of a favorite pipe, the manager stuffed the bowl with fresh pleasures, lit the mess, and inhaled until the fire wanted to burn on its own. \u201cI\u2019m letting you play this out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I see real trouble, then I\u2019ll sure as hell\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWarn the Council of Wolves. You promised me. Yeah, I know.\u201d\nNo matter how important, reynards and raptors were just local predators. Larger, less patient packs were scattered from here to the edge of the solar system. Complicated politics. That\u2019s what gave birth to human life, and all these millions of years only served to make everything into an always grander mess.\n\u201cSo,\u201d said the manager. \u201cDo I let her inside, or not?\u201d\n\u201cNot.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.\nThen after a few calming puffs, she added, \u201cThere\u2019s a key inside that purse of hers. What do you think is inside the matching locker?\u201d\n\u201cCoaxings. Fine little gifts for us to give back to her little pet. No doubt.\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt.\u201d\nWatching his victim, the reynard thought, \u201cMy god, she is a beauty.\u201d\n\u201cAre you taking her bribes?\u201d\n\u201cEverything, and then I\u2019ll give them to you. Off the books.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d the old lady said. \u201cThat\u2019s gracious of you.\u201d\nThe reynard found his shoes and started for the door.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but notice,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you want with this foolish Perpetual . . . it\u2019s never been explained to me . . . \u201d\nPausing, he turned around to offer a bold little smile.\n\u201cOpportunities. Openings. Possibilities that I never dared to wish for,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I stuffed the baby inside the dumpster to start with.\u201d\n7\nFret never imagined that this experience could be so ridiculously fun. As another hopeful partier standing in the drippy beginnings of a long fierce rain, she was surrounded by rough conversations and busy brief lives that never stopped spinning around the essence of life: Love, Food, Shelter, Worth. There weren\u2019t any lessons to be learned. Nothing she witnessed changed what she knew or assumed on any other day. But the scene was rich with details that kept revealing themselves with every hard stare and nuanced analysis. The young man standing beside her, for instance. He had come walking back along the line, begging for space. That round fat-rich face and the scent of his pearl-colored skin marked him as an immigrant from the ice realms of the Outer Reaches. His voice had obvious troubles with the local dialects too. So yes, of course Fret stepped a little ways forward, offering him a slice of the pavement that she had defended all evening now.\nThe boy had a story to tell, shorn of detail but blessed with enthusiasm. Grateful for this audience, he began to fall in love with the moggie stranger, and even though it was a little cruel, Fret led him on.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to visit your home world,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI would take you, if I had the money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t enough left to get me anywhere anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the same,\u201d she said.\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d he said, trying to laugh away his hopes.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re happy enough here,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThis moment I am. Yeah, sure.\u201d\nShe laughed at that quite a lot, including his painfully obvious manner.\nThen fresh motions caught her attention, and when her eyes were abandoning him, the boy grew worried.\n\u201cI bet you don\u2019t know where I grew up,\u201d he said.\nFret said, \u201cYou already told me.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I mean who adopted me and cared for me until I was grown.\u201d\nMaybe this would become a worthwhile topic. But a familiar profile had just emerged from the club, apparently for no reason but to hurry out of sight. Was it the reynard? An array of sensors promised that her guess, her hope, was correct. The brute who came to the house last night had reappeared, abandoning his day\u2019s den for rain and distant thunder.\nInterrupting the storyteller, she said, \u201cSorry. I see someone who owes me quite a lot. I need to run.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d he gamely volunteered.\n\u201cNo,\u201d seemed too rude to be left on its own. So Fret handed over a chit of compressed capital. Not enough to buy the boy his own lightsail, but adequate for passage to any place beyond this wet little avenue.\nHer quarry was a locally famous predator, powerful in so many ways, but the reynard was being chased by an ageless, nearly indestructible creature.\n\u201cI\u2019ll begin with threats,\u201d Fret told herself. \u201cThe Family attorneys, our local police. Collective suits filed on behalf of thousands of victims . . . oh, that would make his little life unbearable . . . \u201d\nThe reynard turned down another narrow street.\n\u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll get angry enough to hit me.\u201d\nHer moggie-shaped hull was full of tools, each capable of responding to threats with not-quite-fatal violence.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll offer him a little something, out of pity, and when my girl\u2019s returned to me, safe and wiser, I\u2019ll cheat him on the ransom too.\u201d\nBeautiful thoughts, swift and sweet. Though the most likely resolution remained that two parties would negotiate for a few moments, then gratefully move past this foolishness.\nAnother intersection, and the reynard paused. Fret expected him to glance over a shoulder, but he didn\u2019t. That tall figure of meat and armor, spun boron and servomotors, pretended to be a statue until she stopped too. Then he was running, breaking into a hard sprint, scrambling up one plastic wall to make the next sharp turn, then surging to even higher speeds.\nFret\u2019s best run was barely fast enough to catch up. Two more turns, two more tiny roadways, then they were back on a wide avenue full of Venerables. Fragile bodies were shouting and scattering, and that\u2019s when the girl went airborne, up high and then slamming the reynard to the ground, pinning the mechanical arm while laughing at his face, getting in position to drive the other knee against the heaving chest.\n\u201cGive her back to me,\u201d she said.\nHigh overhead, that carefully terraformed atmosphere had been generating bolts of lightning. Not huge discharges, but intercepted by steel spikes scattered across the City, then channeled and compressed inside an industrial capacitor. And now a wicked portion of that power burped free\u2014a white-hot blast fierce enough to disable Fret\u2019s hull while flinging her through the nearest window.\nTwo seconds passed before her security systems came back online.\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll make you pay.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Fret meant to say. But someone else had just stepped from the darkest corner of this otherwise empty room. Poubelle. And brandishing the controller, the wicked little moggie pushed the big fire-colored button for a second time. Just to prove that the first strike wasn\u2019t a fluke.\nThe next burst was ten times worse.\nFret\u2019s hull was quite dead.\nAnd the reynard was kneeling beside her. Smiling. Speaking. In the Perpetuals\u2019 dense language, he said, \u201cI agree with you, Fret. Oh, I do. The Family should be terrified. But it won\u2019t be a new species of human coming for your siblings and those sweet grand-greats. And it won\u2019t be a Venerable prophet, and our idiot hatred won\u2019t matter in the end. No, this is who is utterly dangerous, and utterly magnificent.\u201d\nWith that, he picked up her dead hand, straightening one finger.\nWhich he pointed at the girl lying helpless on the filthy, wonderful world.\n8\nWelcome news arrived with the morning, and the household began to celebrate. Most of the children pushed aside games and deep immersions, or they left their AI teachers in mid-lecture, racing to the ground-level floor and a certain large space that was already decorating itself for the party. This was going to be a marvelous day. After a string of what must have been astonishing adventures, their hero was returning home. At last. Missing for twenty days, given up on by almost everyone, and that\u2019s why even the younger adults came to watch, standing at the back of the happy room, smiling as much as anyone.\nA treasured piece of the Family stepped through the demon walls and into the walnut grove, and reaching the portal, she began to knock and kick, calling out, \u201cJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9.\u201d\nBut the portal wouldn\u2019t open. A few small disasters had triggered more paranoid levels of security, and none of the celebrants had permission to overrule anything. Pleas were sent upstairs. Nobody responded. Young children turned to the adults, several suggesting that The Father of All might willingly intercede.\n\u201cYou call out to him,\u201d one mother joked.\nNervous giggles dissolved into a final silence.\nThen one courageous boy reached for the portal. Expecting nothing else, he let the booby trap remove his hand, and then picking the hand off the floor, he pressed it against his fresh stump while once more begging for someone\u2019s decency.\nAnd all that while, the girl standing under the walnuts repeated, \u201cJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she was saying with that precious French. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nAt last, one of grand-great-mothers arrived. She was a tall confident beauty and an avid traveler who had visited every important world in the solar system, meeting every Perpetual worth the effort. She was also a genius when it came to dispensing nicknames for the Family. Rumors claimed that she was The Father\u2019s favorite, and it was worth noting that at some point in life, everybody wished they could be her, if only for a day.\nThe ancient woman stepped up to the portal, two fingers and a coded signal causing it to unseal and slowly pull open.\nThat was when the children looked at each other, taking inventory.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Fret?\u201d they wanted to know.\n\u201cStill hiding in her room, licking her little wounds,\u201d others said.\nThe harshest, richest kinds of laughter filled the room as the lost girl returned to them. But Poubelle didn\u2019t come alone. The tight trousers worn when she left were even tighter now, a baby moggie riding above her hips.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d she said, answering the question before it was asked.\n\u201cAnd her father\u2019s a beautiful boy from the Outer Reaches,\u201d she added.\nThen with her own marvelous confidence, Poubelle declared, \u201cMy daughter will be the second generation in a long line of pretty pet moggies.\u201d\nA moment of prophecy that would prove true. For one hundred and six centuries, this girl\u2019s descendants smiled when they were happy, wore the funny pretty silly costumes when required, and on the day when the Family finally turned against each other, they pretended to be surprised.\nThey pretended to be sorry.\nBut always making ready for the next spectacular new world.\nRobert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

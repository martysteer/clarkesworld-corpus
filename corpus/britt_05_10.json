Here stories are living, corporeal things, floating around in the air like butterflies, or humming birds, or bats. In one scenario, I am an unscrupulous story-poacher, sent to this world from ours, tasked with netting a few good yarns. Soon I\u2019ve captured three of them, and shoved the stories into my backpack without remorse. Back in our world, they\u2019ll be transcribed, and stuck in a genre-appropriate book or magazine. Prior to snatching the stories, I listened to their whispers and quickly noted each story\u2019s \u201celevator pitch.\u201d\n The first one is about a group of sentient buses who are all suddenly and mysteriously murdered one evening. The second story tells of a finishing school for female werewolves and their attempts to become permanently human. The third is a personal narrative of a man\u2019s family history, stretching all the way back to civil war era America. Returning home, I prepare to convert the stories to good-old ink on paper (or photons on a computer screen), and I\u2019m pretty damn sure I know how to classify these suckers. Using my extensive training, I identify the sentient bus and werewolf stories as works of speculative fiction, and the family tree story as a memoir. I\u2019ll send the first two off to Fantasy & Science Fiction, Weird Tales, or Clarkesworld. The other one will end up with Tin House, or Conjunctions, or Granta. But there\u2019s just one problem. In the real world, I\u2019d be wrong.\n \u201cThe Night the Buses Died\u201d is a short story written by Etgar Keret, a wildly popular Israeli writer whose work frequently features elements of speculative fiction, despite being published in Zoetrope All Story, The LA Times, and Tin House. \u201cSt. Lucy\u2019s Home For Girls Raised By Wolves\u201d is the title story of short story collection by the American writer Karen Russell who, in addition to being recently awarded the prestigious 5 Under 35 award from the National Book Foundation, was also named one of Granta\u2019s best new novelists in 2006. The memoir about the man\u2019s family tree, \u201cGhosts Doing the Orange Dance\u201d, was written by Paul Park and appears in the January/February 2010 issue of Fantasy & Science Fiction.\n To be fair, the publication of a pseudo-memoir in F&SF is not without conventional reasoning; Park\u2019s tale does stretch into the future, 2024 to be exact. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my late sixties when this all eventually happens,\u201d he tells me, playfully affirming the notion that he views his own personal science fiction as an inevitable reality. Still, upon first inspection \u201cGhosts Doing the Orange Dance\u201d reads like something you might find in The New Yorker. It has the trappings of a deeply personal confessional piece of emotional angst. It explores the struggle of the American male to find meaning in his family history while grappling with his failings in an increasingly emotionally brutal and detached world. It feels like serious literature. It also has aliens. Is this uncommon in SF? Not to those of us who know the score. For fans of Alfred Bester, Ursula Le Guin, Connie Willis, Harlan Ellison, Neil Gaiman and, more recently, Paolo Bacigalupi, the answer to the question \u201cDoes SF have literary merit?\u201d is a resounding \u201cyes, of course.\u201d\n Paul Park enjoys some cross-over success. In addition to being published in Interzone, F&SF, and other genre magazines, his stories have materialized in more mainstream journals like Conjunctions and Fence. \u201cThat was back when Jonathan Lethem was the editor,\u201d Park says of the latter publication, an allusion to another well-known writer who, along with Michael Chabon, Stephen Millhauser and a few others, is claimed by both the literary and SF camps. Kurt Vonnegut famously joked in his essay \u201cScience Fiction\u201d that he had no idea he was a science fiction writer, and that he was simply someone who \u201cnoticed technology.\u201d But what about non-SF writers who consciously had SF-leanings at the start of their careers? It appears some of today\u2019s rising literary stars became writers because of an interest in, and love of, the fantastic.\n When I ask Etgar Keret about the kinds of books he read as a teenager, he lists Isaac Asimov, Harlan Ellison, Robert Zelany and other SF giants as major influences. \u201cI didn\u2019t differentiate SF writers from \u2019other\u2019 writers,\u201d he says, \u201cThere was interesting stuff and boring stuff.\u201d Keret, a household name in Israel, has a speculative element in almost every single one of his crisp short fictions. Shapeshifters, ghosts, super-powers, magic, alternate dimensions, the after-life, you name it.\n He\u2019s \u201csure\u201d we\u2019ll see an Etgar Keret story set in the future at some point, and says it would be a \u201cgreat honor\u201d if one of his stories or books were nominated for a Hugo. \u201cThey [the Hugos] were the first literary prize I had ever heard of, and some of the best short fiction I\u2019ve read in my life is associated with this prize.\u201d Keret finds hyper-realistic writing \u201cover-rated\u201d and tells me, \u201cThe \u2019objective\u2019 sense of reality is in no way closer to your inner truth than metaphorical or fantastical storytelling.\u201d When he espoused a similar sentiment to NPR\u2019s Ira Glass in front of a large audience at the New York Public Library last October, I heard not only thunderous applause, but some hoots and hollers of approval too.\n \u201cI am soooo glad you mentioned that,\u201d Karen Russell tells me over the phone, \u201cI remember loving that comment.\u201d Russell was in the same NYPL crowd as I was, and speaks fondly about her love for speculative fiction. In addition to the werewolf story, Russell\u2019s other premises include: a minotaur with a human family, children with prophetic nightmares of past disasters, and a world where crab carcasses are large enough to be made into small boats. Of the giant crab-shell boats Russell has this to say: \u201cMy favorite thing about that story is how many people have asked me if there really are crabs that big. Like they really believe in these huge mutant crabs! Who knows, I guess they might be real. I have no idea. I made them up.\u201d\n She is quick to point out that her mutant crabs and werewolves aren\u2019t merely symbols in her stories or tricks of magical realism. \u201cI don\u2019t like stories that use the alphabet of the fantastic to seem weird or whatever. You\u2019ve got to believe in the monsters.\u201d Her story about the finishing school for female werewolves possesses wonderful self-searching themes of identity and self-control. At the end of \u201cSt. Lucy\u2019s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves,\u201d if the reader has any experience with social anxiety they\u2019ll relate to being a werewolf. But Russell insists the story didn\u2019t begin from a sense of metaphoric self-importance. \u201cI didn\u2019t sit down to write this story about my childhood of feeling awkward and left-out and then slapped on the werewolf thing as some over-the-top metaphor. I sat down and wrote a story about werewolves because werewolves are cool and I thought it would be a fun story to write.\u201d\n Another celebrated young writer whose career began with a focus on genre, rather than mainstream fiction, is Victor LaValle. He is the author of three books, most recently the highly acclaimed novel Big Machine which, in addition to being one of Publishers Weekly\u2019s 10 best books of 2009, was also named among the best science fiction of 2009 by the Los Angeles Times. The novel is perhaps more accurately described as horror than SF (it has recently been nominated in the Best Novel category of the Shirley Jackson Awards). LaValle tells me he set out to write a story that was \u201cscary\u201d, \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201chad monsters in it.\u201d The book describes a sort of low-tech secret society whose members are attempting to piece together supernatural consistencies through the study of various newspaper clippings. The tone of the book could easily make it the literary cousin of Fringe or, as one character describes it, \u201cthe spiritual X-Men.\u201d\n LaValle tells me he is very pleased with the response Big Machine has received, since it was the first of his three books that he decided to \u201chave fun with.\u201d In between bites of burgers in the Upper West Side of Manhattan I tell him I sensed a sort of Harlan Ellison meets H.P. Lovecraft quality in the prose and style of Big Machine. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI had direct references to \u2019I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\u2019 in early drafts of the book. But my editor wasn\u2019t sure who Harlan Ellison was, and I figured the material should stand on its own. But yes, that is totally an influence.\u201d When he was a teenager living in Queens, LaValle sent one of his early short stories to a horror \u2019zine based in the Lower East Side. They didn\u2019t take the story, but what LaValle did receive in the mail was a detailed checklist indicating which aspects of his story were strong and which aspects were weak. \u201cThey had this flow chart,\u201d he says, \u201ctelling me the characterization was weak, or the plot was strong, or whatever. This was a huge moment for me. I realized even if I was writing about Goblins or Demons or whatever, that there were people out there that took writing seriously.\u201d\n So it\u2019s safe to say many young writers getting attention in mainstream circles love genre fiction, and in many cases actually write genre fiction. But what about the editors on the front lines of new fiction? Are mainstream literary journals looking for SF-style stories? Todd Zuniga of Opium Magazine certainly seems to think so.\n \u201cWe did an interview with William Gibson back in our fifth issue, which was great because he is phenomenal.\u201d Headquartered in Brooklyn, Opium (available both online and in print formats) in many ways represents the post-McSweeney\u2019s 21st Century direction of chic mainstream literature. With contributors like Daniel Handler (a.k.a. Lemony Snicket), Ben Greenman (an editor at The New Yorker) and Etgar Keret, Opium celebrates a diversity of voices and shows no signs of shying away from something because of its genre. Their 8th Issue, called \u201cThe Mania Issue,\u201d featured almost exclusively fanfic, including a story which combined elements of the film Alien with John Paul Sartre\u2019s No Exit.\n \u201cThe fanfic thing was fun,\u201d Zuniga tells me. \u201cBut I really want to go further. I\u2019m not sure I know what to call it anymore. I like \u2019Fabulolist Fiction\u2019. But yeah, I love all that stuff.\u201d As we talk I get the impression that Opium is the kind of mainstream publication that is perfect for a humanist science fiction writer. Zuniga likes stories \u201cwith plots\u201d that are \u201cactually about something\u201d, rather than dry character studies in which \u201cnot much happens.\u201d \u201cThe thing about good science fiction,\u201d he says, \u201cis that it\u2019s always about something happening now. And I\u2019m really interested in stories about now.\u201d When I ask him if Opium would ever publish a story which takes place in the future his response is confident, \u201cOh yeah. For sure.\u201d\n This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all kinds of SF would find its way into the pages of Opium. I ask Zuniga if, as an editor, he has any kind of nerdy science fiction threshold; a point at which certain speculative elements will turn him off. \u201cWhen something takes itself a little too seriously,\u201d he says, \u201cI read because reading is fun. If I\u2019m dealing with science fiction and it\u2019s absolutely no fun to read because of too much earnestness, I\u2019m out.\u201d\n Jessica Loudis, an associate editor at Conjunctions, firmly believes, \u201cit just comes down to the quality of the prose and the writer\u2019s ability to effectively create their world. If an author can make use of speculative elements in an innovative way, then I certainly won\u2019t object to genre tricks.\u201d In the late 1980s, George Plimpton (of The Paris Review) said Conjunctions was \u201cthe most interesting and superbly edited literary journal founded in the past decade.\u201d The journal has published such literary super-stars as Joyce Carol Oates, Ricky Moody, Sandra Cisneros, Tom Robbins, David Shields, Mary Gaitskill and many others. Yet the ratio of genre writers to literary writers is practically one to one. In addition to Paul Park, Conjunctions has published stories by China Mievelle, Elizabeth Hand, Kelly Link, Jeff Vandermeer and others. They\u2019ve also published Karen Russell. Though seemingly a redundant question, I asked Loudis if Conjunctions is actively still looking for SF stories. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d she says, \u201cConjunctions publishes across those genres regularly. Our upcoming issue is about facsimiles and doppelgangers, so expect to see lots of fantasy/speculative fiction in that [issue].\u201d\n For the ultimate proof that many of those who run in literary circles actually long to travel through time and space, I find myself visiting the home of Lawerence Raab. At 64, Raab has been a finalist for the National Book Award, a Guggenheim Fellow, published in The New Yorker and The Virginia Quarterly Review, and is currently a distinguished professor at Williams College. Raab has the gravitas of being an old solider of literature; he refers to Raymond Carver as \u201cRay\u201d and possesses a book collection that includes numerous first editions. In addition to the stuffy important stuff, there are various toy robots, rocketships and wonderful vintage statues of Nosferatu and Gamera peeking out from the shelves, letting you know the real inspiration behind the great poems. And of all his various awards and plaques, there is only one thing he wants to show me.\n \u201cLook at these!\u201d Raab exclaims has he shows me two different issues of The Magazine of Science Fiction and Fantasy for the 1970s. Both feature cover stories from SF giants like Ellison and Zelany and Asimov. But the contributing SF poem in each issue was written by Lawrence Raab. \u201cPretty cool, huh?\u2019 he says, beaming like a child. Raab is a little older than my father and yet, as he shows me these old issues of F&SF, he\u2019s looking for approval from me, not the other way around. Yes Larry, it\u2019s still cool to like SF, and it\u2019s still literary too.\n The next time I head back into that alternate dimension of corporeal stories, and hunt for the best new stuff, I might not be as sure where to put a story from Karen Russell, or a novel from Victor Lavelle. Hell, even Lawrence Raab has a poem called \u201cAttack of the Crab Monsters.\u201d And if I\u2019m very lucky, I may not always know. When my memory fails me decades from now, I might recall having read that Paul Park story in The New Yorker and Karen Russell\u2019s werewolf story in Weird Tales. I may not remember which authors won all the Pulitzers or Hugos, but hopefully, I\u2019ll always find the good stories. In his essay \u201cOn Writing\u201d, Raymond Carver lists some of his favorite writers (including Ursula K. Le Guin) and then says that, \u201cEvery great or even every very good writer makes the world over according to his own specifications.\u201d I wonder if this made all good writers of fiction in actuality, writers of fantasy.\n \u201cI hope so,\u201d Karen Russell tells me, \u201cbecause I do this so I can escape to another planet. My planet.\u201d\n Ryan Britt's writing has been published with Nerve, Soon Quarterly, Mr. Beller's Neighborhood, and is forthcoming in Opium Magazine.

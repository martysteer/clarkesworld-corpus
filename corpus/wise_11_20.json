And its captain, Antimony Jones, stalks its decks in a swirl of crimson coat and fox fire lighting, dogged by voices. The recent dead, the long dead, and the dead-to-be, all murmuring as to how she\u2019s only three months into her command and it\u2019s all coming undone.\n\u201cStow it.\u201d Antimony snaps, pirate-captain proper.\nA living crew member jumps out of her way at the words, back flat against the wall, spanner clanking to the deck in alarm. The ghosts snicker, and Antimony bares her teeth until they fall silent.\n\u201cYou. Back to work.\u201d Antimony jabs a finger at the frightened crew member, Hawk, even though she was the one who interrupted his work in the first place.\nAs he scrambles to obey, the ship murmurs its own complaint, an out-of-place thrumming Antimony feels in her back teeth. Something is wrong, and Hyacinth, her gods-damned chief engineer, is playing coy, making Antimony come to her in person rather than just telling her what\u2019s wrong.\nShe rounds the corner and nearly smacks into the door to the star chamber, which should open automatically. Antimony slaps a palm to override and enters shouting.\n\u201cWhat in all the gods-damned corporeal and incorporeal hells is so important that I had to come all the way down here instead of you telling me over the comm? And why is the door locked?\u201d\nAntimony stops dead. Because what is so gods-damned important is clearly obvious. Starling, her now-former boatswain, blood-soaked from chin to waist, well and truly slaughtered, hangs by his wrists in the pulsing light of the star chamber.\n\u201cOh, fuck me,\u201d Antimony says and turns to kick the door.\nAs captain of a ghost ship, death and Antimony are well acquainted. The Xanthic Promise\u2019s winding, nautilus halls bear countless invisible scars, Antimony\u2019s among them, where each member of the crew past and present has sworn their demise to the ship. Blood oaths cut into palm and wall as a condition of their service stitch their ghosts in place and power everything the star doesn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s a reckless practice, condemned by the Galactic Fleet and every other kind of ship captain out there, save for pirates. But her crew\u2019s lives and deaths are their own to swear with as they please, and who is Antimony to say different. Some, she suspects, are too young and dumb to truly believe in their future deaths as a reality; others are at the end of their span and desperate to trade what little they\u2019ve left for a last taste of freedom.\nAntimony swore her own oath at fourteen, an orphan doomed to life on a backwater station until the Xanthic Promise docked for trade. Rough and battered as she\u2019d been, the moment Antimony set eyes on Xanthic Promise, it had been love\u2014true and deep and head over heels. All the fairy tales her mother and father had told her before their unfortunate demise, of living stars who sang their captains across the black, seemed poised to come true all at once.\nShe\u2019d stowed aboard, and never mind that the star powering the ship was only roiling, pulsing light, and not the painfully-beautiful, human-faced creature in the holo-illustrations from her parents\u2019 stories. The walls still whispered with ghosts, the opposite of the Galactic Fleet\u2019s cold logic and strict regulations, and definitely the opposite of a life lived station-bound, stuck in one place and hoping against hope the universe would come to her.\nLoose-tongued ghosts had put a quick end to her plan to stay hidden, but instead of putting her right back where she started, or straight out into the black as would have been her right, then-captain Basalt had given Antimony a choice. Swear her life and future death to the ship by stitching a piece of herself to walls, or live a life staring at the same span of stars out of the station\u2019s viewports, always wondering what might have been.\nAntimony hadn\u2019t hesitated, chin up, blade to palm, and bloody palm to wall all in a flash. She\u2019d worked her way from deck girl, carrying and fetching and cleaning, to assistant boatswain, then boatswain, and on up with the sure knowledge in her heart that she would sit in Basalt\u2019s chair as captain one day.\nThat she finally achieved her dream at the cost of a death-promise is a problem for future-her. Present-her has everything she ever wanted. She\u2019s flush with ill-gotten gains, the boundless universe is spread before her, and the crackling power of her ghost ship is hers to command.\nExcept that at-this-very-moment-her has a very much here-and-now problem. Starling.\nHis death has the air of ritual. Doctor Coxcomb has his body down in the medbay, and the only thing she\u2019s been able to tell Antimony so far is that whoever killed Starling cut out his tongue before stringing him up like a burned offering.\nStarling had sworn himself to Xanthic Promise young too, sixteen with a head full of dreams. They\u2019d picked him up planet side and Antimony had been the one to argue for giving him the same choice she\u2019d been given. Most of her interactions with him since had been recent, in his new capacity as boatswain, requisitioning goods and discussing the ship\u2019s stores. Except more than once, she\u2019d caught him at his post, moon-eyed over holo-stories, including one with the very same illustration of the living, singing, humanoid star her parents had shown her.\nIt had made Antimony smile then, and makes her regret his death all the more now.\nThere\u2019s a headache building between her eyes. There\u2019s a . . . hmmm. It\u2019s a not-quite-buzz-not-quite-hum, like an itch on the wrong side of her skin, creeping around inside her skull. She\u2019s been hearing it since . . . she isn\u2019t even sure when, but it\u2019s getting louder, tied to the ship feeling listless, argumentative, sluggish. It\u2019s in the soles of her boots, coming up through the deck plates. A sense of wrong. As if the sleeping star at the ship\u2019s heart was not merely a metaphor, as if the ship was having bad dreams.\n\u201cHeavy is the head that wears the crown.\u201d\nA phantom voice at her ear stirs phantom hair. Antimony just manages to turn her surprised flinch into a hand grazed over her scalp\u2019s stubble, as if that was always what she meant to do. She turns to face her immediate predecessor.\n\u201cFuck off, Cedar.\u201d\nThe former captain leans against nothing, the prerogative of ghosts, arms crossed, lips bent to smirking. He\u2019s much more corporeal than he has any right to be, in that he possesses form at all, though she can see right through him. Being stitched, Cedar should only be a voice, muttering in the walls with all the rest. That he\u2019s more, Antimony imagines, is sheer spite and force of will. And a handy trick she\u2019d like to learn herself one day, if she can do it without sacrificing her pride and asking him how.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the fun in death if I can\u2019t haunt my quarters and gloat?\u201d\n\u201cDeath isn\u2019t supposed to be fun. It\u2019s supposed to be useful.\u201d Antimony scowls. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not your quarters, they\u2019re mine.\u201d\nAntimony still doesn\u2019t know how Cedar won Basalt\u2019s good grace and favor and ended up captain before her. Cedar, with his Galactic Fleet training, the antithesis of everything a good pirate should be, yet Basalt had named him as successor. The fact that Cedar in turn named Antimony and not Hyacinth, Antimony is beginning to suspect, was another act of spite, as being captain is turning out to be a lot less fun and a lot more headachy than she imagined.\nCedar cocks his head, waiting for her to speak, waiting, more precisely, for her to ask for help. Antimony sits astride the polished bench of the single most improbable item on a ship crammed with impossibilities: a gleaming white baby grand piano, Cedar\u2019s pride and joy. Instead of giving him the satisfaction, she stabs a series of discordant notes. When Cedar frowns, some of the tension uncoils from Antimony\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cI hear you have a ghost problem.\u201d Cedar breaks first, but it\u2019s only a moment before his smirk is back in place.\nBecause, gods-damn him, he\u2019s right. One of the many drawbacks of a ghost-powered ship\u2014gossip travels fast. There are scant few secrets on the Xanthic Promise, save those kept from the still-living, which is precisely Antimony\u2019s problem.\nIf the universe were kind, she could simply ask Starling the cause of his death, but despite being sewn into the walls by a supposedly unbreakable pact, wherever his ghost is, she can\u2019t hear it. Like he gave up his voice with the loss of his tongue. All she can hear when she listens for him is that gods-damned hmmm, getting louder and making it hard to think.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have anything remotely useful to contribute?\u201d Antimony grinds the words between her teeth.\nAn expression flickers bright through the former captain\u2019s eyes, which are the color of lightning, nothing Antimony can read. Cedar is only three months stitched; perhaps Starling\u2019s death is simply making him think of his own.\nAntimony thinks on it too, an unfortunate debris-strike fracturing Cedar\u2019s faceplate during routine repairs\u2014repairs he shouldn\u2019t even have been undertaking as captain. Antimony had been there when he\u2019d told Hyacinth he wanted to stretch his legs in the black. She\u2019d watched Hyacinth inspect his suit herself, likely the only thing that kept Antimony from suspicion, her desire for the captain\u2019s chair being no secret. She\u2019d been there, too, when Cedar had come back to the ship, tether-hauled, frozen solid, ice crystals clinging to his skin, and his body ballooned to twice its size.\n\u201cWhat would you give me if I could tell you?\u201d The flicker in Cedar\u2019s eyes turns sly, the promise of knowledge held like a curl of candied orange peel on his tongue.\nAntimony puffs up, pride, as always, ready to tangle her legs and lead to a fall.\n\u201cListen, you smug son-of-a\u2014\u201d\nCedar\u2019s eyes flicker again, static-shot. He\u2019s there and then he\u2019s not and Antimony thumps a fist against the piano again for good measure.\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d\nShe bites the inside of her cheek, considers calling him back, thinks of apologizing, and the thought turns her stomach. She doesn\u2019t need him, and he probably didn\u2019t know anything anyway.\nStill, the air in her quarters feels empty, the temperature dropped. There\u2019s no love lost between them, but Cedar\u2019s departure hammers home the inevitable truth chained around the neck of all captains: she is alone.\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d she says again, softer this time, and swings her weary leg over the piano bench, rising.\nAny sensible captain would remain locked in her quarters to drink her troubles away, but sensible has never been her style. Antimony makes her way to the ship\u2019s prow, allowing a detour to the ship\u2019s store, where she feels Starling\u2019s absence all over again as she requisitions a bottle of good rum and uncorks it with her teeth. She wonders what happened to his holo-stories. She could use a good fairy tale about valiant captains and singing ships right about now.\nThe hum-not-hum itch is there again as she walks the halls, a voice among other voices, one she isn\u2019t quite hearing. It\u2019s like an ill-tuned violin, a wetted finger circling the rim of a glass. On the edge of painful. A familiar voice, but corrupted somehow, like the mind behind it is still trying to figure out how to make words.\n\u201cStarling?\u201d she asks it not expecting an answer, and the sound rises in pitch, a static-squeal like it\u2019s arguing with itself, before it falls silent.\nThen there\u2019s only the usual ghost ship murmur, the dead speculating whether command has made her crack. Living crew members, too, give her the side-eye, whispering among themselves as if she can\u2019t hear. Let them talk. Cedar was a captain of the people, soft and decidedly un-piratey. Antimony is comfortable in her lonely command; better to be feared than loved, as they say.\nLacking anyone human to talk to, she could seek her own ghost, her dead-self-to-be as oracle, but that way lies madness. Or so she\u2019s heard tell. Knowing your ghost on an intellectual level is one thing; looking it dead in the eye and knowing it full and true, that\u2019s another.\nBesides, at the moment, Antimony would rather drink herself into oblivion or into a state where a solution produces itself, whichever comes first. And she intends to do so in full sight of her ghosts and her crew. Let them see a captain without shame, bowed but not broken by the weight of her command. Let the living and the dead gossip on that if they will.\nThe crow\u2019s nest is empty, waiting, and Antimony can\u2019t help a grin. She strung the hammock across the ship\u2019s foremost eye herself during her first year aboard. Basalt had given her waste duty for a month, but she hadn\u2019t taken the nest down, and Antimony had even seen her captain using it a time or two herself when she thought no one was looking.\nWhen she\u2019d first come aboard, after her shifts, Antimony would throw herself into the hammock to listen while most everyone else slept. She\u2019d gaze out at all those stars and wish the stories she\u2019d devoured as a station-bound child were true. She\u2019d wished that instead of the creaks and groans of metal deck plates, she could hear the star\u2019s voice. She\u2019d wanted to hear it sing.\nShe\u2019d been foolish enough then, na\u00efve and wide-eyed, that she\u2019d actually asked then-engineer Oak about the star, and whether it really slept.\nThey\u2019d laughed at her, that deep barrel-chested laugh that, while it hadn\u2019t been cruel, had still struck her a blow. Fairy stories, they\u2019d said. Tales for children to make the work of ships seem like magic.\nBut if ghosts could power a ship\u2019s weapons, she\u2019d reasoned, then why not a sleeping star? Maybe, over the years, people had simply forgotten the truth. Maybe when they\u2019d put the stars to sleep, they hadn\u2019t wanted to own the cruel thing they were doing, so they spun fantastical tales too incredible to possibly be true.\nShe\u2019d given up her belief soon enough though, but had Starling?\nAntimony throws herself into the crow\u2019s nest, kicking up her bootheels just as a commotion breaks out behind her.\nWhat the fuck now? she thinks, wheeling her weary bones around.\n\u201cShe wakes!\u201d the man screams, a crew member whose name Antimony should know, excusing herself that she doesn\u2019t due to the fact that his face is currently an unrecognizable mask of blood.\nHe holds something sharp in crimson-slick fingers, not threatening anyone, but staggering and weaving\u2014shock and blood-loss after gouging out his own eyes.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t stop!\u201d he screams. \u201cHe promised, but it never stops. Please, help me.\u201d\n\u201cYou still want to make the run?\u201d Hyacinth asks, all incredulous, scoffing tone.\n\u201cAre we or are we not gods-damned pirates,\u201d Antimony, rhetorical, shoots back.\nHer mouth tastes the way she imagines the inside of an engine block would.\nShe has one crew member spaced, body refusing to yield up any other secrets, and one in the medbay, bandages over his lack of eyes and doped to oblivion. And she still has a gods-damned job to do.\n\u201cWe can still make the pickup and drop in plenty of time to get paid. Even without the extra ghost to throw on the fire.\u201d Antimony tries to smile around the flat attempt at a joke.\nHyacinth scowls, muttering under her breath, as she walks away.\nDoctor Coxcomb utterly forbid Antimony from questioning Chrysotile, though Antimony doubts he\u2019d be able to provide her with sensible answers. Sensible people don\u2019t gouge their eyes out. But insensible people might just commit murder. Something to think about. Later. Solving mysteries doesn\u2019t pay the bills. Only piracy does.\nThe pickup goes without a hitch, the drop-off less so, because of course one thing can\u2019t fucking go right for her. Instead of payment, their contact meets them with guns, eyes blacked and teeth capped with gold, marking them as DeathSkull, notorious double-crossers, and not Green Hand, the flag they\u2019d claimed to sail under.\n\u201cEvade where you can, fire only if you have to,\u201d Antimony shouts to be heard above the chaos.\nA hit to Xanthic Promise\u2019s portside causes the whole ship to rock, and a panel to her right explodes. How the fuck does that even work? she wonders, then ceases to wonder as sparks shower and she slaps at her coat to keep it from going up in flame. How many deaths can she afford to burn to get out of this mess? She rolls through the inventory of ghosts in her mind, then gives the order to fire.\nShe needs just a little time, just a little luck, just enough space to do something stupid to save their skins. Twin stars of glittering light leap from the ship\u2019s cannons. Ghost-tech rarely kills, but it does a credible job of convincing people they\u2019re dying. At least briefly. Sometimes, ironically, it even convinces them to death.\nEither way, it\u2019s still a pretty light show that will buy them some time as, for the next few moments, the crew of the ship currently trying to wipe them from the stars relives the last breaths of six stitched souls now serving the Xanthic Promise as weaponry.\nBasalt may be in there somewhere, Antimony thinks as the glittering light hits home. That could be her fate one day, the captain\u2019s last burst of glory, her final duty. There are worse ways to go.\nAnother panel explodes. Acrid smoke fills the air. Antimony coughs, and the ship slews hard and away, running running running. Rivets and seams strain, everything wanting to fly apart as Antimony wills it to hold. Jaw clenched, she calls up charts, squinting through eyes that stream part from headache, part from the bone-rattling speed. Her back molars feel as loose as the rivets, and she shouts fresh coordinates.\n\u201cAre you out of your gods-damned mind?\u201d Hyacinth swivels to stare. A rivulet of blood tracks from a gash above her eye, but she doesn\u2019t wipe it away.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Antimony fires back.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Sargasso space.\u201d Trust Hyacinth to recognize the coordinates right away. Damn and double gods-damn.\n\u201cDo it anyway.\u201d\nHyacinth\u2019s eyes blaze crimson mutiny, or maybe that\u2019s only the blood, but she punches the coordinates, punches the ship, and they\u2019re off.\nThe Horse Latitudes. The Doldrums. The Sargasso Sea. All names that don\u2019t make sense in the black, but the effect is the same. It\u2019s a graveyard for stars, a place of legend where ships stall for no discernable reason and never start up again. It\u2019s a place only the foolhardiest captain would go willingly, and which any sensible band of pirates would cut off pursuit to avoid, which is exactly what Antimony is counting on.\nThere\u2019s an under-the-skin feeling the moment Xanthic Promise hits that dead space. The DeathSkull ship drops pursuit, just as their own engines cut out, and Antimony breathes relief against the tightness in her ribs even if it doesn\u2019t last long. The walls chatter doubt. Her crew looks to each other, wild-eyed, but they\u2019re all still alive. They should be falling on their knees and thanking her.\nThat\u2019s when the screaming starts.\nIt\u2019s a wrong sound. An inside-out sound, purple-shattering-to-silver-at-the-edges, going on and on like a voice, like that untuned violin, but so much louder and worse. It is want and need and hunger and fear and unlike anything Antimony has ever heard before. It\u2019s unlike anything she ever wants to hear again. It makes her want to dig her nails into her skin and peel it away whole to go running around in her bones.\nIt leaves her panting on hands and knees, howling back at the noise until she tastes blood, until Hyacinth cracks her across the jaw hard enough to replace one ringing in her ears with another.\n\u201cWhat is. That. Noise. What you\u2019re. Doing.\u201d Hyacinth\u2019s words come out in huffing breaths, shaking and broken.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear it?\u201d Antimony is still hearing it, is certain she\u2019ll always be hearing it from now until the end of time, but at least it\u2019s dulled, a bruise rather than a fresh blow.\n\u201cI heard you screaming,\u201d Hyacinth says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know a human throat could make that sound.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure it can,\u201d Antimony says.\nShe stands.\n\u201cWell, whatever it was,\u201d Hyacinth says, voice steadying, \u201caccording to the report I just got, it happened at the same time three very long fissures appeared in the star chamber\u2019s glass. So, to put it mostly succinctly and bluntly, we are completely and utterly fucked.\u201d\nAntimony follows Hyacinth to look at the star chamber, as if their own eyes could make the report untrue. No such luck. The star chamber is indeed breaking as reported, three long fissures running almost the entire length of the glass that looks somewhat like an old-fashioned lantern and somewhat like the heart of a lighthouse and nothing like either of those things at all. Breaking, but not broken, and that is one small mercy, but perhaps the only one.\nAntimony leaves Hyacinth to do whatever she can, which is, she suspects, very little. The ship was already sick before this whole thing started. Cedar must have known it, and that\u2019s why he insisted on making the repairs himself. But something went wrong, and maybe that\u2019s where this all started, and it\u2019s all connected somehow.\nAntimony thinks of Starling\u2019s missing tongue, a sacrifice, and the sound she\u2019s still hearing, like a ringing echo inside her skull, a voice that doesn\u2019t have words, belonging to something that never had a voice before. She thinks of fairy tales hiding a willfully forgotten truth in plain sight. She\u2019s beginning to build a picture in her mind, and she doesn\u2019t like it at all.\nShe takes herself to the medical bay.\nChrysotile lies rigid, lashed down with restraints. Fluid drips into his arm, a steady flow, keeping him somewhere between awake and dreaming. Coxcomb will likely be back soon. Not enough time to try to wake him, even if such a thing were possible. Antimony is considering sneaking out again when Chrysotile\u2019s head snaps around to look straight at her, which is disconcerting to say the least, given that he is without eyes.\n\u201cI thought I could finish it, but I wasn\u2019t strong enough. Starling said the light would stop if I helped him, but it only got worse.\u201d\nHis body seizes, guilt or pain or both wanting to make an arch against the restraints. He gropes the air, fingers twisted to claws and Antimony shoves down every skin-crawling impulse she has to make herself do the human thing and let Chrysotile take her hand. His fingers are freezing, his grip iron.\n\u201cTell the captain I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Antimony begins, but gets no further as the door grinds open and Doctor Coxcomb descends on her like a storm.\n\u201cI was very specific in my orders.\u201d Coxcomb brandishes a syringe like a weapon, ready to deploy whatever is inside if Antimony doesn\u2019t leave now, captain or no.\nAnd oops, yes, maybe Antimony did use her override on the medbay door knowing the doctor would deny her entry. She quick steps away, trusting to Coxcomb\u2019s brutality in defense of her patient. Besides, she needs to think.\nTell the captain I\u2019m sorry. Antimony very much doubts Chrysotile meant her. Some promise made to Cedar? And how does Starling fit in? All those old stories. If they really were true, what monsters would that make her and all the other ghost ship captains down through the ages?\nAnd even if the tales aren\u2019t true, what if Starling believed? Would it be enough for him to convince Chrysotile to kill him, so he could sacrifice his tongue to the star and give it a voice?\nThoughts roil, pressing out against her skin until Antimony feels she\u2019ll explode. She stomps through the halls and up to the crow\u2019s nest, the place she dreamed as a child, and now all those dreams and wishes feel like a cruel lie. Antimony presses her hands to the window and screams fuck you very loudly at the lack of stars.\nThroat raw, she turns to an access panel, calling up the ship\u2019s logs. Something she should have done long ago, only she was busy with murdered and eyeless crew members, damned double-crossing pirates, and recalcitrant ghosts.\nShe finds Cedar\u2019s entries from the days before his death. He must have felt the same wrongness in the ship as she does now. Would he have attributed it to a waking star? And if he had, what would he do?\nDeep in their hearts, do all ship\u2019s captains know the tales they drank like milk as children are true, but they\u2019ve collectively chosen to believe otherwise?\nCedar never confided in her as his second in command. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. It stood to reason Cedar had only accepted her as first mate to keep an eye on her. Who had he confided in, then? Chrysotile? Certainly not his logs, as they are all maddeningly mundane and empty of any useful details.\nAntimony returns to the ship\u2019s stores and requisitions another bottle, gin this time, and a sturdy blade. She\u2019s about to do a very unwise thing indeed. Antimony drinks and winds her way through the halls until she finds the place where her oath sings to her.\nThe expanse of wall would look unremarkable to anyone else, but it\u2019s where her death is stitched, her promise to the ship, and so for her, there\u2019s a faint silver glow of scars etched into the metal. With half the bottle killed, the blade weaves dangerously above her palm. She closes one eye and squints the other to make both knife and hand behave. Before she can think better of it, she traces the old seams until blood wells, and presses the new wound to old.\nRed smears and a spark snap-jumps, shocking her spine rigid and clacking her teeth together. It\u2019s unwise to talk to one\u2019s own future-ghost, to seek one\u2019s death for counsel, but ever since the scream that rattled her to her core, Antimony has felt her death just inches beneath her skin and she\u2019ll be gods-damned if she just sits around waiting for it to come to her.\nShe forbids herself to pass out, winding the gauze she requisitioned at the same time as the bottle around her hand. It immediately soaks through. When her other-self appears, it\u2019s very much like looking in a mirror, same shorn-to-stubble hair, same smug grin. The event horizon between her death being a future-her problem and a present-her problem is collapsing. She rubs a hand over her scalp, almost expecting her ghost to do the same, but her ghost only smirks, reminding her irritatingly of Cedar.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Antimony asks.\nThe fox fire light around her ankles swirls, a chill reaching up her trouser legs, playing with the hem of her coat. She tries to keep her teeth from chattering. It wouldn\u2019t do to look weak in front of herself.\n\u201cYou already know,\u201d her future-self\u2019s voice is an echo-blur. \u201cIt\u2019s the star. You\u2019re hearing her voice, the one Starling died to give her.\u201d\nThe smirk on the other-her\u2019s lips becomes something sharper, a blade, almost cruel. Would it be uncouth to punch her own ghost in the mouth?\n\u201cStars aren\u2019t sentient. Those are just fairy tales.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want it to be true, but she knows down in her bones that it is, and hasn\u2019t she always known?\nThe other-her\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver. Antimony would have thought there might be some mercy in her eyes, but she also knows herself too well. All the knowing coming to her now is still wound-fresh to her other self. It hurts, too much for future-Antimony to offer any kindness.\nBecause she does know and she\u2019s always known and she\u2019s never wanted to know. All those stories, all that wishing, she never fully thought through the consequences because it would be too terrible. But Starling had known the truth and given his own life to it, a small right against a whole universe of wrong. And Chrysotile had helped him.\n\u201cWhat about Cedar?\u201d Antimony asks herself. He must have known too, but what did he do about it?\n\u201cAsk him.\u201d Future-Antimony\u2019s eyes glitter, cruel delight, like passing the pain back to her past-self might lessen her own hurt.\nAntimony\u2019s hand flashes out, fingers closing around her future-self\u2019s wrist, holding her in place. Even though she must be expecting it, her future-eyes widen in surprise, and there, at last, Antimony sees mercy, sorrow, her future-self aching for the past-self coming face-to-face with the death that will be. But she does nothing to stop her, and the mercy fades back into a smile that might have blood in it if her future-self were still a thing capable of bleeding. Because she knows what happens next.\nAntimony looks into her own eyes.\nAnd there, every possible path her future might take forks and forks and skates across the surface of everything like the glass in the star chamber not-yet shattering. Her life races along those cracks like lightning and comes to a dead stop, a point she can\u2019t see beyond.\nShe sees herself and the star in its chamber and both are burning. There is nothing else. Except. Except except except\u2014an edge like a closed door, like a flat horizon, like a coin pressed to a table with another face Antimony knows is there but cannot see. There is no way to pick at the edge to open the door to see the other face to know that it exists because it does not or cannot or should not because this is where she ends.\nAll the light in the world goes out like a blown candle and rushes back all at once like knives to her eyes and Antimony is alone in the hall. She kicks the wall where her unhelpful asshole of a death is stitched, hard, so her bones jar and the steel toe in her boot rings and it doesn\u2019t make her feel any better at all.\nShe returns to the engine room, to the star chamber, and stands in front of the impossible swirl of light. It makes her skin itch, brings the jittery feeling back to her teeth. If she looks long enough, she can almost see a face, a mouth in the roiling, pulsing energy.\nAntimony traces a finger over one hairline crack until it joins another and another\u2014a river with three tributaries. She presses her bound hand to the glass, leaves a blood-petal kiss of red behind.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispers.\nShe makes a fist of her hand, thumps the side of it against the glass. She\u2019s being a coward. Still.\nAnd now. Now she has a choice to make. Like Cedar made a choice. And fuck it, because her impulse is to do something noble and stupid and self-sacrificing and she really doesn\u2019t want to die.\nBack in her quarters, Antimony mashes the piano\u2019s keyboard, thinking of the keys as teeth, Cedar\u2019s specifically.\n\u201cCome out and talk to me, you asshole.\u201d The yelling makes her feel better, but only marginally so.\nCedar isn\u2019t there and then he is, and even though Antimony called for him, she still jumps when he appears, leaning on nothing again, arms crossed. Despite the horrific nature of his death, he\u2019s still maddeningly pretty, cheekbones defined where hers look gaunt, relaxed and well-fucking-rested where she looks haunted and sleep-starved.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m not corporeal.\u201d Cedar tosses a meaningful look at the piano.\nAntimony is still tired and still a little drunk and lightning keeps forking behind her eyes. But it\u2019s worse when the lightning stops, when it finds the place where it can\u2019t go any farther because that\u2019s where her life ends.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the star waking?\u201d Antimony steps back from the piano, closed fist shaking, and she tucks it behind her back so Cedar won\u2019t see.\n\u201cWhat fun would that be?\u201d He runs fingers over the piano keys and when they make no sound, he runs a finger over the wires instead.\nThey still don\u2019t make a sound, but whatever it does makes Antimony shiver.\n\u201cWould you have listened even if I had tried?\u201d The maddening expression on Cedar\u2019s face makes Antimony want to throw something.\nHe\u2019s right, and that only makes it worse. How many times did they butt heads when he was alive, when she was under his command? Even knowing there\u2019s no solidity to him, Antimony jerks open the piano bench, stuffed with books and sheets of music, and throws the first one she lays her hands on. The pages flutter, and a small square of paper tumbles free.\nAn actual, honest-to-gods, printed photograph.\n\u201cOh fuck me.\u201d Antimony bends to retrieve it, Cedar watching her with a brow perfectly arched, expression smug.\nThis was here the whole time and Antimony never saw it, too uncultured to do anything with the piano other than bang on it for attention and use it as a place to sit and drink and feel sorry for herself.\n\u201cYou and Chrysotile were in the Galactic Fleet together.\u201d Antimony holds up the picture, a group of young cadets in their uniforms, arms slung around each other. Chrysotile and Cedar are together at one end, and Chrysotile\u2019s head is slightly turned, caught in a moment, distracted and unaware of the picture about to be taken.\nEven Antimony isn\u2019t dense enough to miss it. The expression on Chrysotile\u2019s face is stark: love.\nShe thinks of Chrysotile, eyeless in the medbay, grasping her hand and begging forgiveness from his dead captain. To be loved like that\u2014enough that someone would kill for you. Well, it isn\u2019t exactly a comforting thought. It leaves Antimony feeling claustrophobic, but at the same time, achingly lonely. There is no one among the crew\u2014no one in her life\u2014she could even share a drink with, let alone someone willing to pick up a knife and kill a fellow crew member for her, to finish whatever it is she might leave undone.\n\u201cI was wrong about the star.\u201d The sorrowing look in Cedar\u2019s eyes takes Antimony\u2019s breath away.\nShe has a picture of her former captain in her mind\u2014brash, ambitious, apologizing to no one. Stealing her rightful command out from under her, winning Basalt\u2019s favor and trust. But the more Antimony looks at her mental picture against Cedar\u2019s ghost, the more she realizes she doesn\u2019t know him at all. Did Cedar wash out of the Galactic Fleet? Was he dishonorably discharged? Maybe there\u2019s a pirate streak in him after all, and maybe there\u2019s something even more important, something Basalt saw in him and not in Antimony, which is why she gave him command\u2014compassion.\nThe picture she holds in her mind of Cedar\u2014it\u2019s a picture of herself. A picture of who she wants to be, or believed, up until this very moment, she needed to be in order to command. Ruthless, friendless, alone at the top. Holding her crew at bay in a mixture of awe and fear, needing no one.\nHeavy is the head indeed. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a taunt on Cedar\u2019s lips earlier so much as a warning.\n\u201cHow do I stop it?\u201d Antimony asks.\nDead space aches all around the ship, the doldrums, like a bruise. The ship drifts, quiet in all the wrong ways. No engines thrumming; the only pulse of life the need of the star. If they stay, they\u2019re doomed, if they run, they\u2019ll fail. The star chamber will crack, the ship will explode or be devoured. This isn\u2019t just a graveyard for ships, it\u2019s a graveyard for stars, and her own always-dying star is calling to the ghosts of her own kind that haunt this space. And sooner or later, they will answer.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t stop it.\u201d Cedar\u2019s expression is grim. \u201cThat\u2019s what I got wrong. There\u2019s nothing at all you can do. We kept the star chained, and this is her vengeance.\u201d\n\u201cA fucking lot of help you are.\u201d Antimony grits her teeth.\nAt the same time, guilt needles her; no matter how they clashed while he was alive, Cedar really did want what was best for the ship. He might even have loved the Xanthic Promise as much as she does. Enough to die for it.\nHer intuition leaps.\n\u201cYou went to talk to your own death too, and you came up with an answer that involved you walking out of the ship on a routine repair mission and meeting your end even though your time wasn\u2019t up yet.\u201d\nThe pieces click into place, a rapid tumble matched by the beat of her pulse.\n\u201cYou thought if you rearranged fate, met your death early, you could strengthen the chains, put the star back to sleep and keep the ship running. Chrysotile tried to finish what you started, but Starling . . . \u201d\nThe pieces fit, almost but not quite. There is still some missing. Did Starling simply get unlucky and cross Chrysotile\u2019s path just when he was feeling grief-mad and murderous? Or did Starling take advantage of Chrysotile\u2019s grief and talk him into committing murder, convincing Chrysotile that his death would finish what Cedar started and put the star back to sleep? Only Starling lied. He wanted to wake the star. Give it a voice. Set it free.\n\u201cStarling got it right, and you got it absolutely fucking wrong.\u201d\nCedar\u2019s eyes blaze at her, all glare and bared teeth, and for a moment he is as terrible as any ghost ought to be. But all she can do is grin triumph in the face of his offended rage, because she\u2019s right, and a victory, even a pyrrhic one, is still a gods-damned win.\n\u201cYou should have been trying to set her free, wake her up the rest of the way, rather than put her to sleep again. You died for nothing.\u201d\nCedar howls and lunges at her, fingers crooked like claws. But of course, he\u2019s insubstantial and passes right through her. Lacking the focus of the Xanthic Promise\u2019s honed-bright weapons to make his death useful, Antimony feels nothing. Until she turns to mark his passage and where he ends up, comma-curled in the air, his body a sob without breath or tears.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\nShe\u2019s doing it again, setting herself above and apart, taking pleasure in a moment of being right, even though she was just as clueless as Cedar, and every bit as guilty. She should have held onto her belief in the old fairy tales, like Starling. She should have had compassion to pair with her ambition. She shouldn\u2019t have been such a bloody, arrogant fool.\nShe wishes she could pat Cedar\u2019s shoulder, comfort him. He straightens, emptied of rage now, as she is of gloating. And here is the other shoe about to drop between them. Cedar tried and failed and the ship is still in danger. The ship needs a captain, and at the moment, that\u2019s her.\n\u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d Cedar asks.\n\u201cWell, fuck,\u201d Antimony says, because there\u2019s nothing else for it. Cedar was on the right track, but facing the wrong way.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019d better go see about a star.\u201d Antimony shapes her lips to a fierce grin, her stance to a swagger. A little bit of brash and bravado isn\u2019t such a bad thing. She is a gods-damned pirate after all, and if she\u2019s going to go out, then it\u2019s going to be staring death in the face and giving it the middle finger.\nCedar tips his head at her forgotten bottle of gin. His expression is almost kind, but not really at all, because he\u2019s a gods-damned pirate too and that\u2019s not how it is between them.\nAntimony lifts the bottle in salute, takes a swig, and pours out a measure for him. The washed light of Cedar\u2019s eyes flickers in something like pleasure, which gives her hope. Since she\u2019s about to be very dead herself soon, it would be nice to go out knowing that she can still get shit-faced in the afterlife.\nAnother swig for good luck and she leaves the bottle beside the piano, uncorked. She resists the urge to set it down on the bench where it would leave a mark, a last peace offering.\nAnd off she goes.\nAntimony strides the decks of the Xanthic Promise. The walls howl with the restless dead, and in her mind, they\u2019re a storm. She\u2019s a pirate of old, her heeled boots ringing on wood while her red coat swirls and rain lashes her. She bares her teeth as if to catch the wind, even though there\u2019s nothing here but recycled air.\n\u201cOut,\u201d she bellows as she steps into the star chamber\u2019s room.\nHyacinth looks up, scowls, a refusal on her lips. Antimony feels a flicker-flash of regret. Hyacinth is as sour as Antimony wants to be, or at least presents the same gruff exterior. Maybe they could have been friends, raised a glass together in the crow\u2019s nest and sang bawdy old star-shanties. Antimony guesses she\u2019ll never know.\n\u201cGo, or I\u2019ll clap you in irons or make you walk the plank or something equally piratey.\u201d\nHyacinth merely shakes her head, not so much a ceding to authority as her not being paid enough to care. As Antimony freshly reminded herself, they aren\u2019t friends, and the captain\u2019s chair will fall to Hyacinth next, so what stake does she have in stopping Antimony\u2019s stupidity?\nHyacinth retreats, leaving Antimony alone.\nThe star chamber itself is sealed with a double hatch. Antimony scrambles to the top of the chamber and overrides the locks to drop through.\nAnd then. She is. Falling. Seeing her bones through her skin. Hearing them, and isn\u2019t that a weird fucking thing. Antimony is herself and she is her ghost, and she\u2019s every captain who came before her, stitched in a long line, and this is where it ends.\nShe tastes Cedar\u2019s death, holds it on her tongue, the bright bright bright moment of pure joy right before his faceplate shattered, thinking he was doing the right thing.\nHer own death is here too, waiting for her just around a corner. A door. An edge. A turning.\nBut she isn\u2019t there yet.\nThe ship sings. It screams. A swarm of bees humming in a cave made of ice cracking and a violin playing and a color that is blue and purple and pink and none of those at all and a hunger and a heartbeat and a lullaby and a whale calling to its calf through the deep.\nOh, it echoes. Antimony feels it all along her jaw. An ache to answer, but the sound isn\u2019t for her. It\u2019s for the ghosts outside the ship. The dead stars and the living ones and the stars yet to be born. They\u2019re alive. All of them. Not just her star, but everyone among all the billions of points of light spread across the universe. Gloriously, terribly alive.\nIf a thing can have a heart that can be cut out and chained in the moment of its death to power a ship, then of course it is alive. Truly and properly alive. They had no right, none of them, the captains stretching back to the beginning of time sailing the black, to do what they have done.\nLightning cracks. Branches. The edge. There. Antimony reaches. Plunges her hand into the light that is the song that is the end of the line. And her ghost smirks and Cedar smirks and the thread tugs. She pictures with all her will and might, for whatever they are worth, cutting the star free, waking it up, shattering the bonds while sealing the wounds in the glass and keeping everyone on the Xanthic Promise safe, and she hopes against hope and against reason her death is strong enough to do that.\nThis is the end.\nExcept.\nThe coin pressed flat to the table has another side, and so does the door, and the edge really is a corner, and it can be turned.\nCedar made a bargain with his death and went to meet it early. But every member of a ghost ship\u2019s crew knows their death is a solid and inevitable thing. They swear an oath the moment they come on board, and live every day knowing fate cannot be cheated. It is an immutable fact.\nAnd so, if Cedar met his death early, then in truth, he was always fated to do so.\nAnd by that very same logic, if Antimony makes a deal with her death now, refuses it and slips around the edge to the other face of the coin, the other side of the door, then she will have always been meant to do so. Fate signed, sealed, and delivered.\nA promise is still a promise. That is where the power of a ghost ship lies, and she\u2019s not denying her ship anything, only delaying its gratification a while.\nAnd it is a glorious thing.\nHere\u2019s the deal, she thinks, You use my living voice, my tongue to scream your star song to the universe, to scream yourself awake and free, and you kick enough power into the ship on your way out to get us out of the Sargasso and I\u2019ll figure out the rest on the way down.\nIt shouldn\u2019t work, but ghost ships are built on impossible things.\nAntimony throws her head back and opens her throat to the voice that shivers along her jaw, the star longing to sing through her in a language not meant for human tongues. She burns. The chamber shatters and she shatters and the ship lurches forward through the dark\u2014a blink that is not motion that suddenly puts them somewhere else.\nEverything turns inside out and upside down and sideways and backwards oh my. And then Antimony Jones does the most impossible thing of all: she survives.\nHer skin is still smoking as Antimony limps from the star chamber\u2019s remains. Chunks of glass, charred and black, litter the floor. The ship is whole, powered by a ghost, by a promise, as always, just enough to get them out of the doldrums and then, well, maybe Antimony will have to roll the dice again and put her life on the line one more time, but that\u2019s a problem for future-her.\nAntimony looks down at her arms, her legs, at skin black as charcoal, cracked and crazed and flaking ash. Seams running through her flesh blaze with starlight, every and no color at all. Her clothes are gone. And it\u2019s a damned good thing she shaved her head before this all began, because if not, her hair would be on fire.\nShe nearly collides with Hyacinth who hovers just on the other side of the door, anxious for her ship if not for her captain. Antimony tosses a crooked grin.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get a drink sometime,\u201d she says, and the words draw more shock from Hyacinth than Antimony\u2019s burned-and-smoldering condition.\nCheating death, or at least delaying it for a while, is as good an excuse as any to turn over a new leaf. She can be a fierce, piratey pirate and still make a friend, or at least try.\nBlack petals scorch the deck, the echo of footsteps left in her wake. The same goes for any place Antimony rests her hand to steady herself, which she does often, covering the ship with impressions of herself all the way back to her cabin where she scoops up the rest of the gin and kills it in one go.\nThe ghost-stitched walls chitter and gibber and gossip and Antimony grins. Let them tell grand epic tales of the captain who freed her ship\u2019s star, who looked her own death in the eye and said not today, motherfucker. She\u2019ll happily listen once those rumors circle back around as star-shanties, but not right now.\nNow, she will fall into her bed and hope that the sheets don\u2019t catch fire because she intends to sleep for a week solid.\nWhatever comes after that, well, that\u2019s a problem for future-her. Now-her is flush and full of victory, all the crackling power of her ghost ship at her fingertips, and the whole of the universe spread before her. Just the way it should be.\nA.C.

Fox has no hair to blow back: his scalp is shaven and still swathed in cling bandages from the operation. He knows the jagged black hunter drones, the ones people in the village called crows, would never recognize him now. He still ducks his head, still feels a spike of fear as the shadow passes over them.\nOnly a cargo carrier. He straightens up. Jonas, who gave the flyer a raised salute like a good little child of the revolution, looks back at him just long enough for Fox to see the scorn curling his lip. Then he\u2019s eyes-forward again, moving quickly through the rustling field of genemod wheat and canola. He doesn\u2019t like looking at Fox, at the body Fox now inhabits, any longer than he has to. It\u2019s becoming a problem.\n\u201cYou need to talk to me when we\u2019re in the village,\u201d Fox says. \u201cWhen we\u2019re around other people. Out here, it doesn\u2019t matter. But when we\u2019re in the village, you need to talk to me how you talked to Damjan.\u201d\nJonas\u2019s response is to speed up. He\u2019s tall for twelve years old. Long-legged, pale-skinned, with a determined jaw and a mess of tangled black hair. Fox can see the resemblance between Jonas and his father. More than he sees it in Damjan\u2019s face when he inspects his reflection in streaked windows, in the burnished metal blades of the harvester. But Damjan\u2019s face is still bruised and puffy and there is a new person behind it, besides.\nFox lengthens his stride. He\u2019s clumsy, still adjusting to his little-boy limbs. \u201cIt looks strange if you don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cYou understand that, don\u2019t you? You have to act natural, or all of this was for nothing.\u201d\nJonas mumbles something he can\u2019t pick up. Fox feels a flash of irritation. It would\u2019ve been better if Jonas hadn\u2019t known about the upload at all. His parents could have told him his brother had recovered from the fall, but with brain damage that made him move differently, act differently. But they told him the truth. They even let him watch the operation.\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Fox demands. His voice is still deep in his head, but it comes out shrill now, a little boy\u2019s voice.\nJonas turns back with a livid red mark on his forehead. \u201cYou aren\u2019t natural,\u201d he says shakily. \u201cYou\u2019re a digital demon.\u201d\nFox narrows his eyes. \u201cIs that what the teachers are telling you, now?\u201d he asks. \u201cDigital storage isn\u2019t witchcraft, Jonas. It\u2019s technology. Same as the pad you use at school.\u201d\nJonas keeps walking, and Fox trails after him like he really is his little brother. The village parents let their children wander in the fields and play until dusk\u2014it seems like negligence to Fox, who grew up in cities with a puffy white AI nanny to lead him from home to lessons and back. Keeping an eye on Jonas is probably the least Fox can do, after everything the family has done to keep him safe. Everything that happened since he rapped at their window in the middle of the night, covered in dry blood and wet mud, fleeing for his life.\nThey pass the godtree, the towering trunk and thick tubular branches that scrape against a darkening sky. Genetically derived from the baobobs on Old Earth, re-engineered for the colder climes of the colony. Fox has noticed Jonas doesn\u2019t like to look at the tree, either, not since his little brother tumbled out of it.\nThe godtree marks the edge of the fields and the children don\u2019t go past it, but today Jonas keeps walking and Fox can only follow. Beyond the tree the soil turns pale and thick with clay, not yet fully terraformed. The ruins of a quickcrete granary are backlit red by the setting sun. Fox saw it on his way in, evaluated it as a possible hiding place. But the shadows had spooked him, and in the end he\u2019d pressed on towards the lights, towards the house on the very edge of the village he knew belonged to his distant cousin.\n\u201cTime to go back, Jonas,\u201d Fox says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dark soon.\u201d\nJonas\u2019s lip curls again, and he darts towards the abandoned granary. He turns to give a defiant look before he slips through the crumbling doorway. Fox feels a flare of anger. The little shit knows he can\u2019t force him to do anything. He\u2019s taller than him by a head now.\n\u201cDo you think I like this?\u201d Fox hisses under his breath. \u201cDo you think I like having stubby little legs and a flaccid little good-for-nothing cock?\u201d He follows after Jonas. A glass bottle crunches under his foot and makes him flinch. \u201cDo you think I like everything tasting like fucking sand because that patched-up autosurgeon almost botched the upload?\u201d he mutters, starting forward again. \u201cI was someone six months ago, I drew crowds, and now I\u2019m a little shit chasing another little shit around in the country and . . . \u201d\nA sharp yelp from inside the granary. Fox freezes. If Jonas has put an old nail through his foot, or turned his ankle, he knows Damjan\u2019s little arms aren\u2019t strong enough to drag him all the way home. Worse, if the ruin is occupied by a squatter, someone on the run like Fox who can\u2019t afford witnesses, things could go badly very quickly. Fox has never been imposing even in his own body.\nWith his heart rapping hard at his ribs, he picks up the broken bottle by the stem, turning the jagged edge outward. Maybe it\u2019s nothing. \u201cJonas?\u201d he calls, stepping towards the dark doorway. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\nNo answer. Fox hesitates, thinking maybe it would be better to run. Maybe some desperate refugee from the revolution has already put a shiv through Jonas\u2019s stomach and is waiting for the next little boy to wander in.\n\u201cCome and look,\u201d comes Jonas\u2019s voice from inside, faint-sounding. Fox drops the bottle in the dirt. He exhales. Curses himself for his overactive imagination. He goes into the granary, ready to scold Jonas for not responding, ready to tell him they are leaving right now, but all of that dies in his throat when he sees what captured Jonas\u2019s attention.\nRoughly oblong, dark composite hull with red running lights that now wink to life in response to their presence, opening like predatory eyes. The craft is skeletal, stripped down to an engine and a passenger pod and hardly anything else. Small enough to slip the blockade, Fox realizes. So why had it been hidden here instead of used?\nFox blinks in the gloom, raking his eyes over and around the pod, and catches sight of a metallic-gloved hand flopped out from behind the craft\u2019s conical nose. His eyes are sharper now. He supposes that\u2019s one good thing. Jonas hasn\u2019t noticed it yet, too entranced by the red running lights and sleek shape. He\u2019s even forgotten his anger for the moment.\n\u201cIs it a ship?\u201d he asks, voice layered with awe.\nFox snorts. \u201cBarely.\u201d\nHe\u2019s paying more attention to the flight glove, studying the puffy fingers and silvery streaks of metal running through the palm. It\u2019s not a glove. Bile scrapes up his throat. Fox swallows it back down and steps around the nose of the craft.\nThe dead man tore off most of his clothing before the end. His exposed skin is dark and puffy with pooled blood, and silver tendrils skim underneath it like the gnarled roots of a tree, spreading from his left shoulder across his whole body. Fox recognizes the ugly work of a nanite dart. The man might have been clipped days or even weeks ago without knowing it. He was this close to escaping before it ruptured his organs.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jonas murmurs, standing behind him now.\n\u201cDisgusting,\u201d Fox says.\nBut there\u2019s no time to mourn for the dead when the living are trying to stay that way. A month hiding in the family cellar, then Damjan\u2019s accident, the tearful arguments, the bloody operation by black-market autosurgeon. Uploading to the body of a braindead little boy while his own was incinerated to ash and cracked bone to keep the sniffers away. It was all for nothing.\nHis chance at escape had been waiting for him here in the ruins all along.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone about this, Jonas,\u201d Fox says. \u201cNone of your friends. Nobody at school.\u201d\nJonas\u2019s nostrils flares. His mouth opens to protest.\n\u201cIf you tell anyone about this, I\u2019ll tell everyone who I really am,\u201d Fox cuts him off. He feels a dim guilt and pushes through it. This is his chance to get off-world, maybe his only chance. He can\u2019t let anyone ruin it. He needs to put a scare into the boy. \u201cYour parents will be taken away to prison for helping me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll torture them. Do you want that, Jonas?\u201d\nJonas shakes his dark head. His defiant eyes look suddenly scared.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Fox repeats. \u201cCome on. Time to go home.\u201d\nFox thought himself brave once, but he is realizing more and more that he is a coward. He leads the way back through the rustling fields, past the twisting godtree, as dusk shrouds the sky overhead.\nDon\u2019t tell anyone. It\u2019s the refrain Jonas has heard ever since the morning he came into the kitchen to find all the windows shuttered, their one pane of smart glass turned opaque, and a strange man sitting at the table, picking splinters from the wood. When he looked up and saw Jonas, he flinched. That, and the fact that his mother was scrubbing her hands in the sink as if nothing was out of the ordinary, made Jonas brave enough to stare.\nThe man was tall and slim and his hands on the table were soft-looking with deep blue veins. There were dark circles under his eyes and the tuft of hair that wasn\u2019t hidden away under the hood of father\u2019s stormcoat was a fiery orange Jonas had never seen before. Everyone in the village had dark hair.\nDamjan, who had followed him from his bunk how he always did, jostled Jonas from behind, curious. Jonas fed him an elbow back.\nTheir mother looked up. She dried her scalded red hands in her apron. \u201cJonas, Damjan, this is your uncle who\u2019s visiting,\u201d she said, in a clipped voice. But this uncle looked nothing like the boisterous ones with bristly black beards who helped his father repair the thresher and drank bacteria beer and sometimes leg-wrestled when they drank enough of it.\n\u201cPleased to meet you, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Jonas asked.\nThe man tugged at the hood again, pulling it further down his face. He gave a raspy laugh. \u201cMy name is nobody,\u201d he said, but Jonas knew that wasn\u2019t a real name.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s uncle\u2019s name?\u201d he asked his mother.\n\u201cBetter you don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, still twisting her fingers in her apron. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t tell anyone uncle is visiting us. Same for you, Damjan.\u201d\nBut Damjan hardly ever spoke anyways, and when he did he stammered badly. Jonas was going to tell his new uncle this when the front door banged open. His uncle flinched and his mother did, too, cursing under her breath how Jonas wasn\u2019t allowed to. He didn\u2019t know what they were scared of, since it was only father back from the yard. He stank like smoke.\n\u201cBurned everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gloves too, I\u2019ll need new ones.\u201d His eyes flicked over to Jonas and Damjan, slightly bloodshot, slightly wild. \u201cGood morning, my beautiful sons,\u201d he said, crossing the room in his long bouncing stride to ruffle Jonas\u2019s hair how he always did, to kiss Damjan on his flat forehead.\n\u201cWash first!\u201d Jonas\u2019s mother hissed. \u201cDamn it. Wash first, you hear?\u201d\nFather\u2019s face went white. He swallowed, nodded, then went to the basin and washed. \u201cYou\u2019ve met your uncle, yes, boys?\u201d he asked, slowly rinsing his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve said hello?\u201d\nJonas nodded, and Damjan nodded to copy him. \u201cIs uncle here because of the revolution?\u201d he asked.\nLately all things had to do with the revolution. Ever since the flickery blue holo-footage, broadcast from a pirate satellite, that had been projected on the back wall of old Derozan\u2019s shop one night. The whole village had crowded around to watch as the rebels, moving like ghosts, took the far-off capital and dragged the aristos out from their towers. Jonas had cheered along with everyone else.\n\u201cHe is,\u201d father said, exchanging a look with Jonas\u2019s mother. \u201cYes. He is. A lot of people had to leave the cities, after the revolution. Do you remember when the soldiers came?\u201d\nJonas remembered. They came in a roaring hover to hand out speakaloud pamphlets and tell the village they were Liberated, now. That they could keep the whole harvest, other than a small token of support to the new government of Liberated People.\n\u201cSome of them were looking for your uncle,\u201d father said. \u201cIf anyone finds out he\u2019s here, he\u2019ll be killed. So don\u2019t talk about him. Don\u2019t even think about him. Pretend he\u2019s not here.\u201d\nJonas\u2019s new uncle had no expression on his gaunt face, but on top of the wooden table his hands clenched so hard that the knuckles throbbed white.\nAfter supper is over and Jonas goes to bed, Fox stays behind to speak to his parents. There is a new batch of bacteria beer ready and Petar pours each of them a tin cup full. It\u2019s dark and foamy and the smell makes Fox\u2019s stomach turn, but he takes it between his small hands. His cousin Petar is tall and handsome in a way Fox never was, but he has aged a decade in the weeks since Damjan fell. There are streaks of gray at his temples and his eyes are bagged. He slumps when he sits.\nHis wife Blanka conceals it better. She is the same mixture of cheery and sharp-tongued as she was before. In public she holds to Fox\u2019s hand and scolds and smiles as if he really is Damjan, so realistic Fox worried for her mind at first. But he knows now it\u2019s only that she\u2019s a better actor than her husband, and more viscerally aware of what will happen if someone discovers the truth: that Damjan\u2019s brain-dead body is inhabited by a fugitive poet and enemy of the revolution. She drinks the stinking bacteria beer every night, even when Petar doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cJonas and I found something in the field today,\u201d Fox says, hating how his voice comes shrill and high when he\u2019s trying to speak of something so important. \u201cA ship.\u201d\nPetar was using his thumb to wipe the foam off the top of his cup, but now he looks up. \u201cWhat kind of ship?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cJust a dinghy,\u201d Fox says. \u201cSmall. One pod. But everything\u2019s operational. It only needs a refuel.\u201d He takes a swallow of beer too big for his child\u2019s throat, and nearly chokes. \u201cSomeone was going to use it to break the blockade before a nanodart finished them off,\u201d he says. \u201cNow that someone could be me. If you help me again. With this one last thing.\u201d\nHis chest is tight with hope and fear. Petar looks to Blanka.\n\u201cYou would leave,\u201d Blanka says. \u201cIn Damjan\u2019s body.\u201d\nFox nods his bandaged head. \u201cThe transfer was a near thing,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we could find that bastard with the autosurgeon again, trying to extract could wipe me completely.\u201d\nThat isn\u2019t true, not strictly true. He would probably survive, but missing memories and parts of his personality, the digital copy lacerated and corrupted. That might be worse than getting wiped.\n\u201cSo, we would have another funeral,\u201d Petar says. \u201cAnother funeral for Damjan, but this time with all the village watching and with no body to bury.\u201d\n\u201cYou can tell people it was a blood clot,\u201d Fox says. \u201cAn after-effect from the fall. And the casket can stay closed.\u201d\nPetar and Blanka look at each other again, stone-faced. People are different out here in the villages. Hard to read. It makes Fox anxious.\n\u201cThen you can be at peace,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to see . . . This.\u201d He encompasses his body with one waving hand. \u201cYou just have to help me one more time. It might be the best shot I\u2019ll ever have at getting off-world.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the ship was put there as a trap,\u201d Blanka says. \u201cDid you think of that, poet? To draw you or other aristos out of hiding.\u201d\nFox hadn\u2019t thought of that, but he shakes his head. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t go to that much trouble,\u201d he says. \u201cNot for me or anyone else that\u2019s left. All the important people digicast out before the capital fell.\u201d He leans forward, toes barely scraping the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget what your family has done for me.\u201d\n\u201cFamily helps family,\u201d Petar mutters. \u201cFamily over everything.\u201d He looks up from his beer and Fox sees his eyes are wet. \u201cI\u2019ll need to see the ship,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been safe like this, in Damjan\u2019s body. Maybe now you can escape and be safe forever. Maybe that is why Damjan fell. His life for your life.\u201d\nHis shoulders begin to shake, and Blanka puts her arm across them. She pulls Fox\u2019s beer away and pours it slowly into her empty cup. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go to bed,\u201d she tells him, not looking into his eyes\u2014into Damjan\u2019s eyes.\nFox goes. The room he shares with Jonas is tiny, barely big enough to fit the two quickfab slabs that serve as beds. Jonas isn\u2019t asleep, though. He\u2019s sitting upright with his blanket bunched around his waist.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take the ship, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go up into space and visit the other worlds and see all the stars up close. That\u2019s what aristos do.\u201d The penultimate word is loaded with disdain.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get away from the people who want me executed,\u201d Fox says.\nJonas slides down into his bed, turned away facing the wall. \u201cAristos go up and we sit in the mud, teacher says. Aristo bellies are full of our blood.\u201d\n\u201cYour teacher spouts whatever the propaganda machine sends him,\u201d Fox says wearily. \u201cBellies bloated with the blood of the masses. That was my line. Bet your teacher didn\u2019t tell you that.\u201d\nJonas doesn\u2019t reply.\nFox undresses himself and climbs into bed. He tries, and fails, to sleep.\nJonas doesn\u2019t sleep right away either. He\u2019s wary of bad dreams since the day he climbed the godtree. The day they learned, in school, about the smooth white storage cone embedded in the backs of the aristos\u2019 soft-skinned necks.\nTheir new teacher was a tall stern man dressed all in black, replacing the chirping AI that had taught them songs and games, but everyone got brand new digipads so they didn\u2019t mind. All the lessons were about the revolution, about the aristos who\u2019d kept their boot on the throat of the people for too long and now were reaping the harvest, which made no sense to Jonas because the teacher also said aristos were weak and lazy and didn\u2019t know how to work in the fields.\nOne day the teacher projected a picture on the wall that showed a man without skin or muscles, showing his gray skeleton, and a white knob sunk into the base of the skull.\n\u201cThis is where aristos keep a copy of themselves,\u201d the teacher said, pointing with his long skinny finger. \u201cThis is what lets them steal young healthy bodies when their old ones die. It\u2019s what lets them cross the stars, going from world to world, body to body, like a disease. Like digital demons.\u201d\nJonas thought of his uncle who stayed in the basement, the hood he always wore. That, and his soft hands, his way of speaking that swallowed no sounds, made it obvious.\nHe was an aristo. It made Jonas frightened and excited at the same time. Had he lived in a sky-scraping tower in the city and eaten meat and put his boot on the throat of the good simple people? Had he skipped through the stars and been to other worlds?\nWhen Jonas came home from school, he tried to ask his father, but his father shook his head.\n\u201cWhatever he was, he\u2019s family,\u201d he said. \u201cFamily over everything. So you can\u2019t talk about him. Don\u2019t even think about him. Promise me, Jonas.\u201d\nBut it was hard to not think about. Especially hard to not think about the stars and the other worlds. Jonas knew the branches of the godtree were the best place to watch the stars from. To dream from. Sometimes they looked close enough to touch, if he could only climb high enough and stretch out his arms. Jonas was a good climber. Feeling electric with new excitement, he dodged his mother\u2019s chores that day and went out to the fields.\nHe barely noticed Damjan following, how he always followed.\nFox is waiting outside the small quickcrete cube of a building that serves as the village school. The pocked gray walls are painted over with a mural, a cheery yellow sun and blooming flowers. All the children streamed out a few minutes ago, chattering, laughing. Some of them came over to touch Fox gingerly on the head and ask if he was better yet. Fox encounters this question often and finds it easiest to nod and smile vaguely. He knows Damjan was never much of a talker.\nBut the last of the children have gone home now, and Jonas still hasn\u2019t come out. It\u2019s making Fox anxious. He stands up from his squat\u2014he can squat for ages now, Damjan\u2019s small wiry legs are used to it more than they are to chairs\u2014and walks around the edge of the building, towards the window. The smart glass is dimmed, and scratched, besides, but when he stands on tip-toe he can see silhouettes. One is Jonas and the other a tall, straight-backed teacher with his arms folded across his chest. The conversation is muffled.\nFear prickles in Fox\u2019s stomach again, the fear that\u2019s threatened to envelop him ever since a friend woke him in the middle of the night and showed him his face on the blacklist, declared an enemy of the Liberated People. The new government isn\u2019t stupid. They know to start with the children. Jonas\u2019s head is full of the vitriol Fox helped spark not so long ago, back when he\u2019d fooled himself into thinking the violence of the revolution would be brief and justified.\nFox\u2019s heart pounds now. He sees Jonas\u2019s silhouette turn to leave, and he quickly darts back to his usual waiting place outside the main door. The boy comes out with a scowl on his face that falters, then deepens, when he catches sight of Fox. He gives only the slightest jerk of his head as acknowledgement, then goes to walk past.\nFox doesn\u2019t let him. \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d he demands in a whisper, seizing Jonas\u2019s arm.\nJonas wrests it away. His expression turns hard to read, like his parents\u2019. Then a hesitant smirk appears on his face.\nFox feels the panic welling up. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he demands, grabbing for him again.\nJonas grabs back, pinching his hand hard with his nails. \u201cCome on, Damjan,\u201d he says with a fake cheeriness, tugging him along. \u201cHome time, Damjan.\u201d\n\u201cYou stupid little shit,\u201d Fox rasps, barely able to speak through the tightness in his chest. \u201cThey\u2019ll take your parents, you know that? They\u2019ll take them away for helping me. You\u2019ll never see them again.\u201d He can already hear the whine of a hunter drone, the stamp of soldiers\u2019 boots. His head spins. \u201cThe fall wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he says, with no aim now but lashing out like a cornered animal. \u201cIt was yours.\u201d\nJonas\u2019s face goes white. His hand leaps off Fox\u2019s like it\u2019s been burnt. \u201cHe followed me,\u201d Jonas says. \u201cI told him to wait on the low branch. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019s gone still as a statue. A sob shudders through him. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell teacher anything.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Fox feels a wave of relief, then shame.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell teacher about you,\u201d Jonas hiccups, and then his eyes narrow. \u201cI should have. I should tell him. If I tell him, they\u2019ll forgive my parents. They aren\u2019t aristos. They\u2019re good. They\u2019re Liberated People.\u201d\nSuddenly, Jonas is turning back towards the school, his jaw set like his father\u2019s. The red mark on his forehead is back.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Fox pleads. \u201cJonas. Let me explain myself.\u201d\nJonas stops, turns. Giving him a chance.\nFox\u2019s mind whirls through possibilities. \u201cThe fall wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cAnd Damjan knows that.\u201d\n\u201cDamjan is dead,\u201d Jonas says through clenched teeth. \u201cHis brain had no electric in it.\u201d\n\u201cBut when they did the transfer,\u201d Fox says. \u201cYou remember that, yes? The surgery? When they put my storage cone into Damjan\u2019s brainstem, I got to see his memories. Just for a moment.\u201d\nJonas\u2019s eyes narrow again, but he stays where he is. He wipes his nose, smearing snot across the heel of his hand.\n\u201cI saw Damjan wanted to follow you up the tree,\u201d Fox says slowly, feeling his way into the lie. \u201cBecause he always wanted to be like you. He knew you were strong and brave and honest. He was trying to be like you, even though he knew he should have waited on the lower branch. And when he fell, he didn\u2019t want you to feel bad. He didn\u2019t want you to feel guilty.\u201d Fox taps the back of his bandaged head, where the storage cone is concealed. \u201cThat was the last thing Damjan thought.\u201d\nTears are flowing freely down Jonas\u2019s cheeks now. \u201cI wanted to go higher,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I go high enough, it feels like I can touch the sky.\u201d\nFox reaches up and puts his hand on Jonas\u2019s shoulder, softly this time. His panic is receding. He has Jonas solved now. There\u2019s a bit of guilt in his gut, but he\u2019s told worse lies. He would tell a dozen more to make sure nothing goes wrong, not now that Petar has seen the ship and agrees it will fly. Not now that he\u2019s so close to escaping.\nJonas\u2019s father has forbidden him to go near the granary again, but he still goes out to the fields the next day. He has always bored quickly of the games the other children play, even though he can throw the rubber ball as hard as anyone and dodges even better. He\u2019s always preferred to wander.\nHis nameless uncle is with him. It\u2019s still hard to look at Damjan\u2019s face and know Damjan is not behind it, but talking comes a little easier since what happened yesterday. When his uncle asks why he was kept behind after school by the teacher, Jonas tells him the truth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning about the revolution,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout the heroes. Stanko was my favorite. He took the capital with a hundred fighters and he\u2019s got an eye surgery to see in the dark. But yesterday the lesson changed on my pad.\u201d He motions with his hand, trying to capture how the text all dissolved and then reformed, so quick he barely noticed it. \u201cNow it says General Bjelica took the capital. It says Stanko was a traitor and they had to execute him. So I told teacher it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\nDamjan\u2019s face screws up how it does before he cries, but no tears come out, and Jonas knows it\u2019s because grown-ups don\u2019t cry. \u201cI met Stanislav once,\u201d his uncle says. \u201cHe was a good man. Maybe too good. An idealist.\u201d\n\u201cYou met Stanko?\u201d Jonas demands. \u201cWhat did his eyes look like?\u201d\nHis uncle blinks. \u201cBright,\u201d he says. \u201cLike miniature suns.\u201d\nJonas stops where he is, the tall grass rustling against his legs, as he envisions Stanko tall and strong with eyes blazing. \u201cLike stars,\u201d he murmurs.\nHis uncle nods. \u201cMaybe he got away,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of false reports. Maybe he\u2019s in hiding somewhere.\u201d\nJonas asks the question, then, the one that has been bubbling in the back of his mind for days. \u201cThe revolution is good,\u201d he says. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nHis uncle gives a laugh with no happiness in it. \u201cI thought it was,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil the bloodshed. Until cynics and thugs like Bjelica took over. After everything I did for their cause\u2014all the rallies, all the writing\u2014they turned on me. Ungrateful bastards.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you want the revolution if you\u2019re an aristo?\u201d Jonas asks plainly.\n\u201cBecause there weren\u2019t meant to be aristocrats or underclass after the revolution,\u201d his uncle says, with a trace of anger in Damjan\u2019s shrill voice. \u201cEveryone was meant to be equal. But history is a wheel and we always make the same mistakes. The only difference is who gets crushed into the mud.\u201d He picks anxiously at a stalk. \u201cThe ruling families were bad,\u201d he says. \u201cThe famines, and all that. But this is worse.\u201d\nJonas considers it. The teacher told them that there would be no famines anymore. They would keep their whole crop, except for a small token of support to the government of Liberated People. \u201cDid you lose many in the famine?\u201d he asks, because it\u2019s a grown-up question. \u201cI had a little sister who died. And that\u2019s why Damjan is different. Was different. Because mother couldn\u2019t feed him well enough.\u201d\nDamjan\u2019s mouth twists. For a moment his uncle doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally says. \u201cNot many.\u201d Damjan\u2019s face is red, and Jonas realizes his uncle is ashamed of something, though what he can\u2019t guess. \u201cI wrote a poem series about the famine,\u201d he says. \u201cYears ago. I still remember it. Do you want to hear some of it, maybe?\u201d\nJonas hesitates. He doesn\u2019t know if he likes poetry. But maybe if he listens to the poetry, he can ask more questions about Stanko and the capital, and then about the stars and the other worlds his uncle will soon go to.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he agrees. \u201cIf it\u2019s not really long.\u201d\nThe week passes at two speeds for Fox, agonizingly slow and terrifyingly fast. Petar has spread word that the old granary past the edge of the terraform has broken glass and an old leaking oil drum inside it, to ensure the other parents keep their children away. Fox\u2019s nights are spent poring over schematics with Blanka or else sneaking out to the ship itself with Petar.\nDuring the day, he spends most of his time with Jonas. The boy is bright and never runs dry of questions, and ever since Fox\u2019s first recitation he\u2019s been devouring poetry. Not necessarily Fox\u2019s\u2014he prefers it when Fox recites the older masters, the bolder and more rhythmic styles. He has even started scribbling his own poem using charcoal on the wall of their bedroom, which made Petar and then Blanka both shake their heads.\nHe reminds Fox a little bit of himself as a child. Too clever to get along with the other children, too brash and too stubborn, worryingly so. But Fox has other concerns. The ship is tuned and refueled and finally ready to fly, and the village\u2019s weather probe predicts a rolling storm in a fortnight. That\u2019s when Fox will launch, while the thunder and lightning masks the take-off. His days in the village, his days in Damjan\u2019s body, are finally numbered.\nFox is in the cramped bedroom, laboring with a piece of Jonas\u2019s charcoal. The boy\u2019s favorite poem is a short one, but even so it takes a long time for Fox to transcribe it onto the clear stretch of wall. He\u2019s only halfway finished the memento, his small hands smeared black, when he hears Jonas arrive home from the school. A moment later, he hears a shriek from Blanka.\nFox goes stiff and scared, ears strained for the thump of soldiers\u2019 boots, but there\u2019s nothing but Blanka\u2019s angry voice and Jonas\u2019s near-inaudible reply. He wipes his hands on his trousers and goes to the kitchen.\nJonas is standing sullenly with his shirt knotted in his hands. Blanka is in a rage, and Fox realizes why as soon as he sees the bruises on Jonas\u2019s bare back.\n\u201cThat spindly bastard, I\u2019ll snap him in halves,\u201d she\u2019s snarling. \u201cWhat happened, Jonas? What happened, my beautiful boy?\u201d\nJonas lifts his head. \u201cTeacher switched me,\u201d he says. \u201cFor telling lies.\u201d He turns as he says it, and his eyes catch on Fox. He gives a smile that fills Fox with pure dread. Fox knows, somehow, what\u2019s coming. \u201cWe learned about enemies of the revolution today,\u201d Jonas says. \u201cThere was one aristo who tried to convince the Liberated People to let all the aristos go without getting punished. They called him the Fox because he had red hair.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Blanka murmurs. \u201cOh, Jonas. What did you say?\u201d\n\u201cI said he helped the revolution,\u201d Jonas says defiantly, looking Fox in the eye. \u201cI said he wrote the poem, the one about aristo bellies full of our blood.\u201d\n\u201cYou should not have done that, Jonas,\u201d Fox says, surprised he can speak at all. \u201cThat was dangerous. That was very dangerous.\u201d His panic is welling up again, numbing him all over. \u201cThey have gene records. They know that I\u2019m a cousin to your father.\u201d\nJonas bites at his lip, but his eyes are still defiant. \u201cI wanted to be brave,\u201d he says. \u201cStrong and brave and honest. Like Damjan thought I am.\u201d\nFox feels adrift. He knows Jonas, no matter how sharp he seems, is still a child. There\u2019s no way he can understand what he\u2019s just done. Maybe it\u2019s Fox\u2019s own fault, for filling his head with all the poems.\nMaybe they\u2019ll be lucky, and the teacher will keep Jonas\u2019s transgression to himself. Fox has been lucky before.\nWhen father comes home mother tells him what happened, and his whole body seems to sink a little. Jonas feels the disappointment like he feels the welts on his back, and worse, he can tell that his father is scared. There is a brutal silence that lasts all evening until he goes to bed, lying on his stomach with a bit of medgel spread over his back. He knows he made a mistake. Even though he didn\u2019t say his uncle was with them, he said too much.\nJonas tries to apologize to his uncle, who is lying very straight and very still, staring up at the ceiling, and Damjan\u2019s voice mutters something about everything being fine and not to worry about anything. It doesn\u2019t sound like he believes it. Between the aches in his back and the thoughts in his head, Jonas takes a very long time to fall asleep. Halfway through a bad dream, his mother\u2019s hands shake him awake.\n\u201cUp, Jonas. You, too, Damjan.\u201d\nJonas wrenches his eyes open. It\u2019s still dark through the window and he hears a high whining noise he recognizes coming from outside. A hover. Jonas feels a spike of cold fear go all the way through him.\n\u201cI need to pee,\u201d he says.\n\u201cLater,\u201d mother says. \u201cThere are some men here to speak with your father. To look around the house.\u201d Her voice is strained. \u201cIf they ask you anything, think three times before you say anything back. Remember that uncle was never here.\u201d\nThen she\u2019s gone again, leaving Jonas alone with his uncle. In the light leaking from the hall, Jonas can see Damjan\u2019s small round face is etched with terror, so much that he almost wants to take his hand and squeeze it. As if he really is Damjan, and not the Fox. Jonas listens hard to the unfamiliar voices conversing with his father. One of them sounds angry.\nLoud stomping steps in the hall, then the door opens all the way and two soldiers come in with mother and father close behind. They are not as tall as father but their black coats and bristling weapons make them seem bigger, more frightening, like flying black hunter drones that have turned into men.\n\u201cGood morning, children,\u201d one of them says, even though it is the middle of the night. He gives a small smile that doesn\u2019t crinkle his eyes and raises one fist in the salute of the Liberated People.\nJonas returns it, and shoots his uncle a meaningful look, but Damjan\u2019s little fists are stuck to his sides. Fortunately, the soldier is focused on him, not his uncle.\n\u201cYou must be the older,\u201d he says. \u201cJonas, isn\u2019t it? You told our friend the teacher something very strange today, Jonas. What did you tell him?\u201d\nJonas\u2019s mouth is dry, dry. He looks to mother, who is framed between the men\u2019s broad shoulders, and she starts to speak but the second soldier puts a warning finger to his lips.\n\u201cWe want to hear from Jonas, not from you,\u201d the first one says. \u201cWhat did you tell your teacher, Jonas?\u201d\nJonas knows it is time to be brave, but not honest. \u201cI said that the Fox helped the revolution,\u201d he says. \u201cI was confused. I thought he was Lazar. Lazar makes the songs for the satellite to play.\u201d He looks at both the soldiers, trying to gauge if they believe him. He lifts his nightshirt and turns so he won\u2019t have to look them in the eye. \u201cTeacher was mad and didn\u2019t let me explain,\u201d he says. \u201cHe just started to switch me. Look how bad he switched me.\u201d\n\u201cA few stripes never killed anyone,\u201d the soldier says. \u201cIt\u2019ll make you look tough. Your little girlfriends will like that, right? Turn around.\u201d\nJonas drops his shirt and turns back, ready to meet the soldiers\u2019 gaze again. His uncle gives an encouraging nod where they can\u2019t see him.\n\u201cDid you know that this Fox, this enemy of the revolution, is a relative of yours?\u201d the soldier asks. \u201cA cousin to your father?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jonas says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know him. He\u2019s never come here.\u201d\nThe other soldier, who hasn\u2019t spoken yet, barks a short and angry laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d he says, in a voice like gravel. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a sniff.\u201d He pulls something from his jacket and fits it over his mouth and nose like a bulbous black snout.\nJonas has heard of sniffer masks\u2014his uncle explained them when they were in the field one day, how each person born had a different odor, because of their genes and their bacteria, and you could program a sniffer mask to find even the tiniest trace of it\u2014but he has never seen one before now. It makes the soldier look like a kind of animal. When he inhales, the sound is magnified and crackling and makes Jonas shudder.\nBehind the soldiers, mother has her hands tucked tight under her armpits. Her face is blank, but Jonas imagines she is thinking of all the scrubbing, all the chemicals she used anywhere uncle sat or ate. But uncle\u2019s old body has been gone for weeks now, and the smells would be too, wouldn\u2019t they?\nAs the sniffer moves around the room, the first soldier leans in close to the wall to look at the charcoal lettering. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asks. \u201cLessons?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jonas says quietly.\n\u201cGood,\u201d the soldier says, and Jonas sees his eyes moving right to left on it, instead of left to right, and realizes he\u2019s like most of the older people in the village who can\u2019t read. It gives him a small sense of relief.\nThat only lasts until he looks over and sees the sniffer has stopped beside his uncle. \u201cWhat happened to the boy\u2019s head?\u201d the sniffer asks, voice distorted and grating.\n\u201cHe fell,\u201d father says from the doorway. \u201cA few weeks ago. He isn\u2019t healed in the brain yet. He\u2019s a little slow.\u201d\n\u201cAre you, boy?\u201d the sniffer demands.\nJonas clenches his thumbs inside his fists. There is no part of uncle\u2019s body left in Damjan\u2019s, only his digital copy, his soul, but Jonas wonders if the sniffer might somehow be able to detect that, too.\nHis uncle looks up with a confused smile and reaches to touch the sniffer mask. The sniffer jerks back, then pushes him towards the door, more gently than Jonas would have expected, and continues searching the room. Jonas releases a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding.\nThe sniffer works through the rest of the house, too, and Jonas and his family drift slowly along with him to open doors and cupboards, to make sure there are no traps or surprises. The horrible sucking sound of the sniffer mask sets Jonas\u2019s teeth on edge. It feels like a strange dream, a bad one. His eyes are sore and his bladder is squeezing him.\nWhen they finally finish with the cellar, the sniffer looks irritated but the other soldier is relieved. \u201cWe\u2019ll be off, then,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember, if he ever contacts you in any way, it\u2019s your duty to report him. He\u2019s not one of us. He cut ties with you and with all decent people the day he had his storage cone implanted.\u201d\nFather nods, his mouth clenched shut, and shows the soldiers out. Jonas follows, because he wants to make sure, really sure, that the nightmare is over. Father doesn\u2019t send him back in. The soldiers are out the door and past the bushes when the sniffer suddenly stops. His mask is still on, and the sucking noise comes loud in the still night air.\nJonas remembers that the last charred bits of uncle\u2019s old skeleton are buried underneath the bushes. His father is not breathing, only staring. The sniffer lingers.\nJonas braces himself. He reminds himself that he is brave. Then he darts away from the door before father can pull him back, jogging up behind the sniffer and tugging his arm. \u201cCan I see the hover?\u201d he asks loudly.\nThe sniffer whirls and shoves him backward. Jonas squeals, loud and shrill how mother hates it, and he lets his piss go in a long hot stream that soaks his legs, splatters the bushes and the soldier\u2019s boots. It\u2019s very satisfying. Especially when the sniffer yanks his mask down and curses.\n\u201cI thought the other boy was the slow one,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHe\u2019s frightened,\u201d father says, coming and gripping Jonas by the arm. \u201cYou frightened him. Please, just go.\u201d\nAs Jonas watches, the soldiers climb into their hover. They go.\nThe instant the whine of the hover fades away into the distance, Fox tells Petar and Blanka that it has to be tonight. His heart is still pounding away at his tiny ribcage, so hard he imagines the bones splintering. He\u2019s sweating all over.\n\u201cThat was too close,\u201d he says. \u201cToo close. I have to launch tonight.\u201d\nEveryone is in the kitchen. Blanka is wetting a rag for Jonas to clean himself; Petar is standing behind a chair and gripping it tightly, rocking it back and forth on its legs. They all turn their heads to look at Fox.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no storm tonight,\u201d Blanka says, handing Jonas the rag. \u201cSomeone will see the exhaust burn. It\u2019ll be loud, too.\u201d\nFox shakes his head. \u201cNobody around here knows what a launch looks or sounds like,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Petar, you told everyone there was oil in the granary, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nHis cousin blinks. \u201cYes.\u201d He pauses, then looks to his wife. \u201cWe could set fire to the granary. That should be enough to cover the noise and the light so long as he goes up dark.\u201d\nBlanka slowly nods. \u201cAlright. Alright. You\u2019ll need help moving the ship out. I\u2019ll come as well.\u201d\n\u201cI want to come,\u201d Jonas says, wide-eyed, wringing the rag between his hands. Fox realizes he never did finish the poem on the wall.\n\u201cBring Jonas, too,\u201d he says. \u201cTo say goodbye.\u201d\nBare minutes later, they are dressed and out the door, moving quickly through the crop field. The night air is cold enough to sting Fox\u2019s cheeks. Fear and anticipation speed his short legs and he manages to keep pace with Petar and Blanka, who are lugging the gas. Jonas skips ahead and then back, electric with excitement, already forgetting the fear.\n\u201cI pissed on a soldier,\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cI saw from the window,\u201d Fox grunts. \u201cBut a sniffer can\u2019t read DNA from ashes and bone. He had nothing.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Jonas\u2019s face reddens a bit. \u201cI\u2019ll do it again, though. I hate the soldiers as bad as the aristos. I want everyone equal, like you said.\u201d\nBlanka puts a finger to her lips, and Jonas falls silent. Fox is glad to save his breath. They pass under the godtree, its twisted branches reaching up towards a black sky sewn with glittering stars. For a moment Fox dares to imagine the future. Slipping through the blockade and into the waiting arms of civilization. Telling his tale of survival against all odds. Maybe he\u2019ll be famous on other worlds how he so briefly was here.\nAnd he\u2019ll be leaving Jonas\u2019s family to suffer through whatever comes next. The thought gnaws at him so he shoves it away. He reminds himself that Petar and Blanka are clever people. They know how to keep their heads down. They know how to keep silent and survive.\nAt the entrance to the abandoned granary, Fox switches on the small lantern he brought from the kitchen and lights the way for Petar and Blanka. They haul the tiny ship out on wooden sledges Petar made for it a day ago. Jonas puts his small shoulder into it and pushes from behind.\nFox checks everything he remembers, moving from the nosecone to the exhaust, then yanks the release. The ship shutters open, revealing the waiting passenger pod. Its life support status lights glow a soft blue in the dark. Ready. In the corner of his eye Fox sees Jonas staring up at the stars.\nThe ones who survive will be the ones who can keep their heads down. Fox knows it from history; he knows in his gut it\u2019s happening here. Jonas isn\u2019t one of those. Maybe he\u2019ll learn to be, but Fox doesn\u2019t think so.\nBefore he can stop himself, he turns to Blanka. \u201cJonas should go,\u201d he says. \u201cNot me.\u201d\nJonas\u2019s head snaps around, but Fox doesn\u2019t look at him. He watches Blanka\u2019s face. She doesn\u2019t look shocked, the way he thought she would, but maybe it\u2019s just that people are different in the village. Harder to read.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Petar demands.\n\u201cJonas should take the ship,\u201d Fox says, because why else would he have told them to bring Jonas? He must have known, in the back of his mind, that this was what he needed to do. One brave thing, and then he can go back to being a coward. \u201cHe\u2019s already pissed off the teacher and pissed on a soldier,\u201d Fox continues. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep putting himself in danger here. And the two of you, as well.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who put us in danger,\u201d Petar snaps. \u201cYou would take another son from me now, cousin?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s never fit right here, Petar,\u201d Blanka says, and for the first time Fox sees tears in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s always had his head up in the sky. We used to say that, remember?\u201d\n\u201cHe would be safer somewhere else,\u201d Fox says. \u201cLet him take the ship. It\u2019s all automated from here on in.\u201d He pauses. Breathes. \u201cLet him take the ship, then you can burn down the granary and say he was playing in it. You can use what\u2019s left of my bones if you need proof.\u201d\nPetar looks at his son. \u201cIs this what you want to do, then, Jonas?\u201d he asks hoarsely.\nJonas chews his lip. Turns to Fox. \u201cCould I come back? Will I be able to come back?\u201d\n\u201cNot soon,\u201d Fox says. He knows there are still too many factions scrabbling in the power vacuum, knows things will get worse before they get better. \u201cBut some day. When things stabilize. Yes.\u201d He can feel himself losing his nerve. He almost hopes Jonas will refuse.\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d Jonas says solemnly. Petar gives a ragged cry and wraps him in his arms. Blanka hugs him from behind, putting her cheek against his cheek. Fox feels ashamed for watching. He looks away.\n\u201cWhat about uncle?\u201d Jonas asks, his voice muffled by the embrace. \u201cWill he be Damjan forever?\u201d\nFox swallows as his cousin straightens up, and tries to look him in the eye. \u201cYou could say I was in the fire, too,\u201d he says. \u201cThat Damjan was in there. And I could leave again. Try my luck going north. You wouldn\u2019t have to look at me and remember all the time.\u201d\nPetar looks sideways to Blanka. Slowly, they both shake their heads. \u201cYou can never be Damjan and you can never be Jonas,\u201d Blanka says. \u201cBut you are family. We\u2019ve kept you safe this long, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\nFox dares to imagine the future again, this time in the village, slowly growing again in Damjan\u2019s body. He did used to dream of retiring to the countryside one day. And he\u2019s learned how to keep his head down. Soon the bandages will be off and his storage cone, shaved down and covered over with a flap of skin by the autosurgeon, will be undetectable.\nMaybe the violence will be over in a few years\u2019 time. Maybe Damjan will become a poet, a better one than Fox ever was.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of you.\u201d\nHe stands aside while Jonas\u2019s parents say their goodbyes. Jonas does his best to be sad, but Fox sees his eyes go to the ship over and over again, an excited smile curling his lips. He hugs his mother fiercely, then his father, then comes to Fox.\n\u201cYou can have my bed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger.\u201d He raises his arms. Pauses. He sticks out one hand instead to shake.\nFox clasps it tight. \u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d he says.\nThen Jonas is clambering into the pod, the restraints webbing over him to hold him in place during launch, and it\u2019s too late for Fox to take it all back even if he wanted to. The ship folds shut. The smell of gas prickles Fox\u2019s nose and he realizes Petar is dousing one side of the granary to ensure it burns. When he\u2019s finished, Blanka takes his gas-slicked hand in hers, and takes Fox\u2019s with the other. They walk the agreed-upon distance with a few steps extra to be safe.\nThe ship squats on the pale soil, rumbling through its launch protocols, and then the engine ignites. Fox feels it in his chest, vibrating through his bones. Riding a bonfire of smelting orange flame, the ship begins to rise, one fiery tongue catching the roof of the granary on the way up. The engine burns even brighter, stamping itself onto Fox\u2019s retinas, and by the time he blinks them clear the ship is only a pinpoint of light disappearing into the sky.\nThe crackling flames leap high, consuming the granary and making it hard to see the stars.

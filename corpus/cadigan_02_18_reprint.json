And she didn\u2019t just splinter the bone\u2014compound fracture! Yow! What a mess! Fortunately, we\u2019d finished servicing most of the eyes, a job that I thought was more busywork than work-work. But those were the last decs before Okeke-Hightower hit and everybody had comet fever.\nThere hadn\u2019t been an observable impact on the Big J for almost three hundred (Dirt) years\u2014Shoemaker-Somethingorother\u2014and no one was close enough to get a good look back then. Now every news channel, research institute, and moneybags everywhere in the solar system was paying Jovian Operations for a ringside view. Every JovOp crew was on the case, putting cameras on cameras and backup cameras on the backup cameras\u2014visible, infrared, X-ray, and everything else. Fry was pretty excited about it herself, talking about how great it was she would get to see it live. Girl-thing should have been watching where she wasn\u2019t supposed to be going.\nI was coated and I knew Fry\u2019s suit would hold, but featherless bipeds are prone to vertigo when they\u2019re injured. So I blew a bubble big enough for both of us, cocooned her leg, pumped her full of drugs, and called an ambulance. The jellie with the rest of the crew was already on the other side of the Big J. I let them know we\u2019d scrubbed and someone would have to finish the last few eyes in the radian for us. Girl-thing was one hell of a stiff two-stepper, staying just as calm as if we were unwinding end-of-shift. The only thing she seemed to have a little trouble with was the O. Fry picked up consensus orientation faster than any other two-stepper I\u2019d ever worked with but she\u2019d never done it on drugs. I tried to keep her distracted by telling her all the gossip I knew and when I ran out, I made shit up.\nThen all of a sudden, she said, \u201cWell, Arkae, that\u2019s it for me.\u201d\nHer voice was so damned final, I thought she was quitting. And I deflated because I had taken quite a liking to our girl-thing. I said, \u201cAw, honey, we\u2019ll all miss you out here.\u201d\nBut she laughed. \u201cNo, no, no, I\u2019m not leaving. I\u2019m going out for sushi.\u201d\nI gave her a pat on the shoulder, thinking it was the junk in her system talking. Fry was no ordinary girl-thing\u2014she was great out here but she\u2019d always been special. Back in the Dirt, she\u2019d been a brain-box, top-level scholar and a beauty queen. That\u2019s right\u2014a featherless biped genius beauty queen. Believe it or leave it, as Sheerluck says.\nFry\u2019d been with us for three and half decs when she let on about being a beauty queen. The whole crew was unwinding end-of-shift\u2014her, me, Dubonnet, Sheerluck, Aunt Chovie, Splat, Bait, Glynis, and Fred\u2014and we all about lost the O.\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Dubonnet, \u201cdid you ask for whirled peas, too?\u201d I didn\u2019t understand the question but it sounded like a snipe. I triple-smacked him and suggested he respect someone else\u2019s culture.\nBut Fry said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t blame any a youse asking. That stuff really is so silly. Why people still bother with such things, I sure don\u2019t know. We\u2019re supposed to be so advanced and enlightened and it still matters how a woman looks in a bathing suit. Excuse me, a biped woman,\u201d she added, laughing a little. \u201cAnd no, the subject of whirled peas never came up.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s how you really felt,\u201d Aunt Chovie said, big, serious eyes and all eight arms in curlicues, \u201cwhy\u2019d you go along with it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was the only way I could get out here,\u201d Fry said.\n\u201cNot really?\u201d said Splat, a second before I woulda blurted out the same thing.\n\u201cYes, really. I got heavy metal for personal appearances and product endorsements, plus a full scholarship, my choice of school.\u201d Fry smiled and I thought it was the way she musta smiled when she was crowned Queen of the Featherless Biped Lady Geniuses or whatever it was. It wasn\u2019t insincere, but a two-stepper\u2019s face is just another muscle group; I could tell it was something she\u2019d learned to do. \u201cI saved as much as I could so I\u2019d have enough for extra training after I graduated. Geology degree.\u201d\n\u201cDirt geology though,\u201d said Sheerluck. It used to be Sherlock but Sheerluck\u2019ll be the first to admit she\u2019s got more luck than sense.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I saved for extra training,\u201d Fry said. \u201cI had to do the best I could with the tools available. You know how that is. All-a-youse know.\u201d\nWe did.\nFry had worked with some other JovOp crews before us, all of them mixed\u2014two-steppers and sushi. I guess they all liked her and vice versa but she clicked right into place with us, which is pretty unusual for a biped and an all-octo crew. I liked her right away and that\u2019s saying something because it usually takes me a while to resonate even with sushi. I\u2019m okay with featherless bipeds, I really am. Plenty of sushi\u2014more than will admit to it\u2014have a problem with the species just on general principle, but I\u2019ve always been able to get along with them. Still, they aren\u2019t my fave flave to crew with out here. Training them is harder, and not because they\u2019re stupid. Two-steppers just aren\u2019t made for this. Not like sushi. But they keep on coming and most of them tough it out for at least one square dec. It\u2019s as beautiful out here as it is dangerous. I see a few outdoors almost every day, clumsy starfish in suits.\nThat\u2019s not counting the ones in the clinics and hospitals. Doctors, nurses, nurse-practitioners, technicians, physiotherapists, paramedics\u2014they\u2019re all your standard featherless biped. It\u2019s the law. Fact: you cannot legally practice any kind of medicine in any form other than basic human, not even if you\u2019re already a doctor, supposedly because all the equipment is made for two-steppers. Surgical instruments, operating rooms, sterile garments, even rubber gloves\u2014the fingers are too short and there aren\u2019t enough of them. Ha, ha, a little sushi humor. Maybe it\u2019s not that funny to you but fresh catch laugh themselves sick.\nI don\u2019t know how many two-steppers in total go out for sushi in a year (Dirt or Jovian), let alone how their reasons graph, but we\u2019re all over the place out here and Census isn\u2019t in my orbit, so for all I know half a dozen two-steppers apply every eight decs. Stranger things have happened.\nIn the old days, when I turned, nobody did it unless they had to. Most often, it was either terminal illness or permanent physical disability as determined by the biped standard: i.e., conditions at sea level on the third planet out. Sometimes, however, the disability was social, or more precisely, legal. Original Generation out here had convicts among the gimps, some on borrowed time.\nNow, if you ask us, we say OG lasted six years but we\u2019re all supposed to use the Dirt calendar, even just to each other (everyone out here gets good at converting on the fly), which works out to a little over seventy by Dirt reckoning. The bipeds claim that\u2019s three generations not just one. We let them have that their way, too, because, damn can they argue. About anything. It\u2019s the way they\u2019re made. Bipeds are strictly binary, it\u2019s all they know: zero or one, yes or no, right or wrong.\nBut once you turn, that strictly binary thinking\u2019s the first thing to go, and fast. I never heard anyone say they miss it; I know I don\u2019t.\nAnyway, I go see Fry in one of the Gossamer ring clinics. A whole wing is closed off, no one gets in unless they\u2019re on The List. If that isn\u2019t weird enough for you, there\u2019s a two-stepper in a uniform stuck to the floor, whose only job is checking The List. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong station, but the two-stepper finds me on The List and I may go in and see La Soledad y Godmundsdottir. It takes me a second to get who she means. How\u2019d our girl-thing get Fry out of that? I go through an airlock-style portal and there\u2019s another two-stepper waiting to escort me. He uses two poles with sticky tips to move himself along and he does all right but I can see this is a new skill. Every so often, he maneuvers so one foot touches floor so he can feel more like he\u2019s walking.\nWhen you\u2019ve been sushi as long as I have, two-steppers are pretty transparent. I don\u2019t mean that as condescending as it sounds. After all, I was a two-stepper once myself. We all started out as featherless bipeds, none of us was born sushi. But a lot of us feel we were born to be sushi, a sentiment that doesn\u2019t go down too well with the two-steppers who run everything. Which doesn\u2019t make it any less true.\nMy pal the Poler and I go a full radian before we get to another air-lock. \u201cThrough there,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll take you back whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d\nI thank him and swim through, wondering what dim bulb thought he was a good idea, because he\u2019s what Aunt Chovie calls surplus to requirements. The few conduits off this tube are sealed and there\u2019s nothing to hide in or behind. I know Fry is so rich that she has to hire people to spend her money for her, but I\u2019m thinking she should hire people smart enough to know the difference between spending and wasting.\nThere\u2019s our girl, stuck to the middle of a hospital bed almost as big as the ringberg that put her in it. She\u2019s got a whole ward to herself\u2014all the walls are folded back to make one big private room. There are some nurses down at the far end, sitting around sipping coffee bulbs. When they hear me come in, they start unsticking and reaching for things but I give them a full eight-OK\u2014Social call, I\u2019m nobody, don\u2019t look busy on my account\u2014and they all settle down again.\nSitting up in her nest of pillows, Fry looks good, if a little undercooked. There\u2019s about three centimeters of new growth on her head and it must be itchy because she keeps scratching it. In spite of the incubator around her leg, she insists I give her a full hug, four by four, then pats a spot beside her. \u201cMake yourself to home, Arkae.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there a rule about visitors sitting on the bed?\u201d I say, curling a couple of arms around a nearby hitching-post. It\u2019s got a foldout seat for biped visitors. This place has everything.\n\u201cYeah. The rule is, it\u2019s okay if I say it\u2019s okay. Check it\u2014this bed\u2019s bigger than a lot of apartments I\u2019ve had. The whole crew could have a picnic here. In fact, I wish they would.\u201d She droops a little. \u201cHow is everyone, really busy?\u201d\nI settle down. \u201cThere\u2019s always another lab to build or hardware to service or data to harvest,\u201d I say, careful, \u201cif that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d The way her face flexes, I know it isn\u2019t.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who\u2019s come to see me,\u201d she says.\n\u201cMaybe the rest of the crew weren\u2019t on The List.\u201d\n\u201cWhat list?\u201d she says. So I tell her. Her jaw drops and all at once, two nurses appear on either side of the bed, nervous as hell, asking if she\u2019s all right. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she snaps at them. \u201cGo away, gimme some privacy, will you?\u201d\nThey obey a bit reluctantly, eyeing me like they\u2019re not too sure about how safe she is with me squatting on the bedspread.\n\u201cDon\u2019t yell at them,\u201d I say after a bit. \u201cSomething bad happens to you, it\u2019s their fault. They\u2019re just taking care of you the best way they know how.\u201d I uncurl two arms, one to gesture at the general surroundings and the other to point at the incubator, where a quadjillion nanorectics are mending her leg from the marrow out, which, I can tell you from personal experience, itches. A lot. No doubt that\u2019s contributing to her less-than-sparkly disposition\u2014what the hell can you do about itchy bone marrow?\u2014and what I just told her doesn\u2019t help.\n\u201cI should have known,\u201d she fumes, scratching her head. \u201cIt\u2019s the people I work for.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t make sense. JovOp couldn\u2019t afford anything like this. \u201cI think you\u2019re a little confused, honey,\u201d I say. \u201cIf we even thought JovOp had metal that heavy, it\u2019d be Sushi Bastille Day, heads would\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, these people are back in the Dirt. My image is licensed for advertising and entertainment,\u201d she says, \u201cI thought there\u2019d be less demand after I came out here\u2014out of sight, out of mind, you know? But apparently the novelty of a beauty queen in space has yet to wear off.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re still rich,\u201d I say. \u201cIs that so bad?\u201d\nShe makes a pain face. \u201cWould you agree to an indefinite contract just to be rich? Even this rich?\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t get rich on an indefinite contract,\u201d I say gently, \u201cand no union\u2019s stupid enough to let anybody take one.\u201d\nShe thinks for a few seconds. \u201cAll right, how about this: did you ever think you owned something and then you found out it owned you?\u201d\n\u201cOh . . . \u201d Now I get it. \u201cCan they make you go back?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying,\u201d Fry says. \u201cA court order arrived last night, demanding I hit the Dirt as soon as I can travel. The docs amended it so they decide when it\u2019s safe, but that won\u2019t hold them off forever. You know any good lawyers? Out here?\u201d she added.\n\u201cWell, yeah. Of course, they\u2019re all sushi.\u201d\nFry lit up. \u201cPerfect.\u201d\nNot every chambered Nautilus out here is a lawyer\u2014the form is also a popular choice for librarians, researchers, and anyone else in a data-heavy line of work\u2014but every lawyer in the Jovian system is a chambered Nautilus. It\u2019s not a legal restriction the way it is with bipeds and medicine, just something that took root and turned into tradition. According to Dove, who\u2019s a partner in the firm our union keeps on retainer, it\u2019s the sushi equivalent of powdered wigs and black robes, which we have actually seen out here from time to time when two-steppers from certain parts of the Dirt bring their own lawyers with them.\nDove says no matter how hard biped lawyers try to be professional, they all break out with some kind of weird around their sushi colleagues. The last time the union had to renegotiate terms with JovOp, the home office sent a can-full of corporate lawyers out of the Dirt. Well, from Mars, actually, but they weren\u2019t Martian citizens and they went straight back to No. 3 afterwards. Dove wasn\u2019t involved but she kept us updated as much as she could without violating any regulations.\nDove\u2019s area is civil law and sushi rights, protecting our interests as citizens of the Jovian system. This includes not only sushi and sushi-in-transition but pre-ops as well. Any two-stepper who files a binding letter of intent for surgical conversion is legally sushi.\nPre-ops have all kinds of problems\u2014angry relatives, rich angry relatives with injunctions from some Dirt supreme court, confused/troubled children, heartbroken parents and ex-spouses, lawsuits and contractual disputes. Dove handles all that and more: identity verification, transfer of money and property, biometric resets, as well as arranging mediation, psychological counseling (for anyone, including angry relatives), even religious guidance. Most bipeds would be surprised to know how many of those who go out for sushi find God, or something. Most of us, myself included, fall into the latter category but there are plenty of the organized religion persuasion. I guess you can\u2019t go through a change that drastic without discovering your spiritual side.\nFry wasn\u2019t officially a pre-op yet, but I knew Dove would be the best person she could talk to about what she\u2019d be facing if she decided to go through with it. Dove is good at figuring out what two-steppers want to hear and then telling them what they need to hear in a way that makes them listen. I thought it was psychology but Dove says it\u2019s closer to linguistics.\nAs Sheerluck would say, don\u2019t ask me, I just lurk here.\nThe next day, I show up with Dove and List Checker looks like she\u2019s never seen anything like us before. She\u2019s got our names but she doesn\u2019t look too happy about it, which annoys me. List-checking isn\u2019t a job that requires any emotion from her.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the attorney?\u201d she says to Dove, who is eye-level with her, tentacles sedately furled.\n\u201cScan me again if you need to,\u201d Dove says good-naturedly. \u201cI\u2019ll wait. Mom always said, \u2018Measure twice, cut once.\u2019\u201d\nList Checker can\u2019t decide what to do for a second or two, then scans us both again. \u201cYes, I have both your names here. It\u2019s just that\u2014well, when she said an attorney, I was expecting\u2014I thought you\u2019d be . . . a . . . a . . . \u201d\nShe hangs long enough to start twisting before Dove relents and says, \u201cBiped.\u201d Dove still sounds good-natured but her tentacles are now undulating freely. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d she asks, syrupy-sweet, and I almost rupture not laughing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d List Checker says in a small voice. \u201cI\u2019ve never been farther than Mars before.\u201d\n\u201cIf the biped on the other side of that portal is equally provincial, better warn \u2019em.\u201d Then as we go through, Dove adds, \u201cToo late!\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same guy with the poles but when Dove sees him, she gives this crazy whooping yell and pushes right into his face so her tentacles are splayed out on his skin.\n\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d she says, really happy.\nAnd then the Poler says, \u201cHiya, Mom.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Kay,\u201d I say, addressing anyone in the universe who might be listening. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about a brain enema. Is now a good time?\u201d\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Dove says. \u201c\u2018Hiya Mom\u2019 is what you say when anyone calls you a son of a bitch.\u201d\n\u201cOr \u2018Hiya, Dad,\u2019\u201d says Poler, \u201cdepending.\u201d\n\u201cAw, you all look alike to me,\u201d Dove says. \u201cIt\u2019s a small universe, Arkae. Florian and I got taken hostage together once, back in my two-stepper days.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019m surprised as hell. Dove never talks about her biped life; hardly any of us do. And I\u2019ve never heard of anyone running into someone they knew pre-sushi purely by chance.\n\u201cI was a little kid,\u201d Poler says. \u201cTen Dirt-years. Dove held my hand. Good thing I met her when she still had one.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a creepy little kid,\u201d Dove says as we head for Fry\u2019s room. \u201cI only did it so he wouldn\u2019t scare our captors into killing all of us.\u201d\nPoler chuckles. \u201cThen why do you let me keep in touch with you after it was all over?\u201d\n\u201cI thought if I could help you be less creepy, you wouldn\u2019t inspire any more hostage-taking. Safer for everybody.\u201d\nI can\u2019t remember ever hearing about anyone still being friends with a biped from before they were sushi. I\u2019m still trying to get my mind around it as we go through the second portal.\nWhen Fry sees us, there\u2019s a fraction of a second when she looks startled before she smiles. Actually, it\u2019s more like horrified. Which makes me horrified. I told her I was bringing a sushi lawyer. Girl-thing never got hiccups before, not even with the jellies and that\u2019s saying something. Even when you know they\u2019re all AIs, jellies can take some getting used to no matter what shape you\u2019re in, two-stepper or sushi.\n\u201cToo wormy?\u201d Dove says and furls her tentacles as she settles down on the bed a respectful distance from Fry.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Fry says, making the pain face. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude or bigoted\u2014\u201d\n\u201cForget about it,\u201d Dove says. \u201cLizard brain\u2019s got no shame.\u201d\nDove\u2019s wormies bother her more than my suckers? I think, amazed. Lizard brain\u2019s not too logical, either.\n\u201cArkae tells me you want to go out for sushi,\u201d Dove goes on chattily. \u201cHow much do you know about it?\u201d\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot of surgery but I think I have enough money to cover most of it.\u201d\n\u201cLoan terms are extremely favorable. You could live well on that money and still make payments\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to cover as much of the cost as I can while my money\u2019s still liquid.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re worried about having your assets frozen?\u201d Immediately Dove goes from chatty to brisk. \u201cI can help you with that whether you turn or not. Just say I\u2019m your lawyer, the verbal agreement\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\u201cBut the money\u2019s back in the Dirt\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re here. It\u2019s all about where you are. I\u2019ll zap you the data on loans and surgical options\u2014if you\u2019re like most people, you probably already have a form in mind but it doesn\u2019t hurt to know about all the\u2014\u201d\nFry held up a hand. \u201cUm, Arkae? You mind if I talk to my new lawyer alone?\u201d\nMy feelings are getting ready to be hurt when Dove says, \u201cOf course she doesn\u2019t. Because she knows that the presence of a third party screws up that confidentiality thing. Right, Arkae?\u201d\nI feel stupid and relieved at the same time. Then I see Fry\u2019s face and I know there\u2019s more to it.\nThe following day the crew gets called up to weed and reseed the Halo. Comet fever strikes again. We send Fry a silly cheer-up video to say we\u2019ll see her soon.\nI personally think it\u2019s a waste of time sowing sensors in dust when we\u2019ve already got eyes in the Main ring. Most of the sensors don\u2019t last as long as they\u2019re supposed to and the ones that do never tell us anything we don\u2019t already know. Weeding\u2014picking up the dead sensors\u2014is actually more interesting. When the dead sensors break down, they combine with the dust, taking on odd shapes and textures and even odder colorations. If something especially weird catches my eye, I\u2019ll ask to keep it. Usually, the answer\u2019s no. Recycling is the foundation of life out here\u2014mass in, mass out; create, un-create, recreate, allathat. But once in a while, there\u2019s a surplus of something because nothing evens out exactly all the time, and I get to take a little good-luck charm home to my bunk.\nWe\u2019re almost at the Halo when the jellie tells us whichever crew seeded last time didn\u2019t weed out the dead ones. So much for mass in, mass out. We\u2019re all surprised; none of us ever got away with doing half a job. We have to hang in the jellie\u2019s belly high over the North Pole and scan the whole frigging Halo for materials markers. Which would be simple except a lot of what should be there isn\u2019t showing up. Fred makes us deep-scan three times but nothing shows on Metis and there\u2019s no sign that anything leaked into the Main ring.\n\u201cMusta all fell into the Big J,\u201d says Bait. He\u2019s watching the aurora flashing below us like he\u2019s hypnotized, which he probably is. Bait\u2019s got this thing about the polar hexagon anyway.\n\u201cBut so many?\u201d Splat says. \u201cYou know they\u2019re gonna say that\u2019s too many to be an accident.\u201d\n\u201cDo we know why the last crew didn\u2019t pick up the dead ones?\u201d Aunt Chovie\u2019s already tensing up. If you tapped on her head, you\u2019d hear high C-sharp.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Fred says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know which crew it was. Just that it wasn\u2019t us.\u201d\nDubonnet tells the jellie to ask. The jellie tells us it\u2019s put in a query but because it\u2019s not crucial, we\u2019ll have to wait.\n\u201cFrigging tube worms,\u201d Splat growls, tentacles almost knotting up. \u201cThey do that to feel important.\u201d\n\u201cTube worms are AIs, they don\u2019t feel,\u201d the jellie says with the AI serenity that can get so maddening so fast. \u201cLike jellies.\u201d\nThen Glynis speaks up: \u201cScan Big J.\u201d\n\u201cToo much interference,\u201d I say. \u201cThe storms\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust humor me,\u201d says Glynis. \u201cUnless you\u2019re in a hurry?\u201d\nThe jellie takes us down to just above the middle of the Main ring and we prograde double-time. And son of a bitch\u2014is this crazy or is this the new order?\u2014we get some hits in the atmosphere.\nBut we shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not just the interference from the storms\u2014Big J gravitates the hell out of anything it swallows. Long before I went out for sushi (and that was quite a while ago), they\u2019d stopped sending probes into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere. They didn\u2019t just hang in the clouds and none of them ever lasted long enough to reach liquid metallic hydrogen. Which means the sensors should just be atoms, markers crushed out of existence. They can\u2019t still be in the clouds unless something is keeping them there.\n\u201cThat\u2019s gotta be a technical fault,\u201d Splat says. \u201cOr something.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m motion sick, I lost the O,\u201d says Aunt Chovie, which is the current crew code for Semaphore only.\nBipeds have sign language and old-school semaphore with flags but octo-crew semaphore is something else entirely. Octo-sem changes as it goes, which means each crew speaks a different language, not only from each other, but also from one conversation to the next. It\u2019s not transcribable, either, not like spoken-word communication because it works by consensus. It\u2019s not completely uncrackable but even the best decryption AI can\u2019t do it in less than half a dec. Five days to decode a conversation isn\u2019t exactly efficient.\nTo be honest, I\u2019m kinda surprised the two-steppers who run JovOp are still letting us get away with it. They\u2019re not what you\u2019d call big champions of privacy, especially on the job. It\u2019s not just sushi, either\u2014all their two-stepper employees, in the Dirt or all the way out here, are under total surveillance when they\u2019re on the clock. That\u2019s total as in a/v everywhere: offices, hallways, closets, and toilets. Bait says that\u2019s why JovOp two-steppers always look so grim\u2014they\u2019re all holding it in till quitting time.\nBut I guess as long we get the job done, they don\u2019t care how we wiggle our tentacles at each other or what color we are when we do it. Besides, when you\u2019re on the job out here, you don\u2019t want to worry about who\u2019s watching you because they\u2019d better be. You don\u2019t want to die in a bubble waiting for help that isn\u2019t coming because nobody caught the distress signal when your jellie blew out.\nSo anyway, we consider the missing matter and the markers we shouldn\u2019t have been picking up on in Big J\u2019s storm systems and we whittle it down to three possibilities: the previous crew returned to finish the job but someone forgot to enter it into the record; a bunch of scavengers blew through with a trawler and neutralized the markers so they can resell the raw materials; or some dwarf star at JovOp is seeding the clouds in hope of getting an even closer look at the Okeke-Hightower impact.\nNumber three is the stupidest idea\u2014even if some of the sensors actually survive till Okeke-Hightower hits, they\u2019re in the wrong place, and the storms will scramble whatever data they pick up\u2014so we all agree that\u2019s probably it. After a little more discussion, we decide not to let on and when JovOp asks where all the missing sensors are, we\u2019ll say we don\u2019t know. Because the Jupe\u2019s honest truth is, we don\u2019t.\nWe pick up whatever we can find, which takes two J-days, seed the Halo with new ones, and go home. I call over to the clinic to check how Fry\u2019s doing and find out if she managed to get the rest of the crew on The List so we can have that picnic on her big fat bed. But I get Dove, who tells me that our girl-thing is in surgery.\nDove says that, at Fry\u2019s own request, she\u2019s not allowed to tell anyone which sushi Fry\u2019s going out for, including us. I feel a little funny about that\u2014until we get the first drone.\nIt\u2019s riding an in-out skeet, which can slip through a jellie double-wall without causing a blowout. JovOp uses them to deliver messages they consider sensitive\u2014whatever that means\u2014and that\u2019s what we thought it was at first.\nThen it lights up and we\u2019re looking at this image of a two-stepper dressed for broadcast. He\u2019s asking one question after another on a canned loop; in a panel on his right, instructions on how to record, pause, and playback are scrolling on repeat.\nThe jellie asks if we want to get rid of it. We toss the whole thing in the waste chute, skeet and all, and the jellie poops it out as a little ball of scrap, to become some scavenger\u2019s lucky find.\nLater, Dubonnet files a report with JovOp about the unauthorized intrusion. JovOp gives him a receipt but no other response. We\u2019re all expecting a reprimand for failing to detect the skeet\u2019s rider before it got through. Doesn\u2019t happen.\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s drunk,\u201d Bait says. \u201cQuery it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d says Splat. \u201cBy the time they\u2019re sober, they\u2019ll have to cover it up or their job\u2019s down the chute. It never happened, everything\u2019s eight-by-eight.\u201d\n\u201cUntil someone checks our records,\u201d Dubonnet says and tells the jellie to query, who assures him that\u2019s a wise thing to do. The jellie has been doing this sort of thing more often lately, making little comments. Personally, I like those little touches.\nSplat, however, looks annoyed. \u201cI was joking,\u201d he says, enunciating carefully. They can\u2019t touch you for joking no matter how tasteless, but it has to be clear. We laugh, just to be on the safe side, except for Aunt Chovie who says she doesn\u2019t think it was very funny because she can\u2019t laugh unless she really feels it. Some people are like that.\nDubonnet gets an answer within a few minutes. It\u2019s a form message in legalese but this gist is, We heard you the first time, go now and sin no more.\n\u201cThey all can\u2019t be drunk,\u201d Fred says. \u201cCan they?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t they?\u201d says Sheerluck. \u201cYou guys have crewed with me long enough to know how fortune smiles on me and mine.\u201d\n\u201cSpoken like a member of the Church of The Four-Leaf Horseshoe,\u201d Glynis says.\nFred perks right up. \u201cIs that that new casino on Europa?\u201d he asks. Fred loves casinos. Not gambling, just casinos. The jellie offers to look it up for him.\n\u201cSynchronicity is a real thing, it\u2019s got math,\u201d Sheerluck is saying. Her color\u2019s starting to get a little bright; so is Glynis\u2019. I\u2019d rather they don\u2019t give each other ruby-red hell while we\u2019re all still in the jellie. \u201cAnd the dictionary definition of serendipity is, \u2018Chance favors the prepared mind.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared to go home and log out, who\u2019s prepared to join me?\u201d Dubonnet says before Glynis can sneer openly. I like Glynis, vinegar and all, but sometimes I think she should have been a crab instead of an octopus.\nOur private quarters are supposed to have no surveillance except for the standard safety monitoring.\nYeah, we don\u2019t believe that for a nanosecond. But if JovOp ever got caught in the act, the unions would eat them alive and poop out the bones to fertilize Europa\u2019s germ farms. So either they\u2019re even better at it than any of us can imagine or they\u2019re taking a calculated risk. Most sushi claim to believe the former; I\u2019m in the latter camp. I mean, they watch us so much already, they\u2019ve gotta want to look at something else for a change.\nWe share the typical octo-crew quarters\u2014eight rooms around a large common area. When Fry was with us, we curtained off part of it for her but somehow she was always spilling out of it. Her stuff, I mean\u2014we\u2019d find underwear bobbing around in the lavabo, shoes orbiting a lamp (good thing she only needed two), live-paper flapping around the room in the air currents. All the time she\u2019d spent out here and she still couldn\u2019t get the hang of housekeeping in zero gee. It\u2019s the sort of thing that stops being cute pretty quickly when you\u2019ve got full occupancy, plus one. I could tell she was trying, but eventually we had to face the truth: much as we loved her, our resident girl-thing was a slob.\nI thought that was gonna be a problem but she wasn\u2019t even gone a day before it felt like there was something missing. I\u2019d look around expecting to see some item of clothing or jewelery cruising past, the latest escapee from one of her not-terribly-secure reticules.\n\u201cSo who wants to bet that Fry goes octo?\u201d Splat says when we get home.\n\u201cWho\u2019d want to bet she doesn\u2019t?\u201d replies Sheerluck.\n\u201cNot me,\u201d says Glynis, so sour I can feel it in my crop. I\u2019m thinking she\u2019s going to start again with the crab act, pinch, pinch, pinch but she doesn\u2019t. Instead, she air-swims down to the grotto, sticks to the wall with two arms and folds the rest up so she\u2019s completely hidden. She misses our girl-thing and doesn\u2019t want to talk at the moment, but she also doesn\u2019t want to be completely alone, either. It\u2019s an octo thing\u2014sometimes we want to be alone but not necessarily by ourselves.\nSheerluck joins me at the fridge and asks, \u201cWhat do you think? Octo?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d I say, and I honestly don\u2019t. It never occurred to me to wonder but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because I took it for granted she would. I grab a bag of kribble.\nAunt Chovie notices and gives me those big serious eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t just live on crunchy krill, Arkae.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a craving,\u201d I tell her.\n\u201cMe too,\u201d says Bait. He tries to reach around from behind me and I knot him.\n\u201cMessage from Dove,\u201d says Dubonnet just before we start wrestling and puts it on the big screen.\nThere\u2019s not actually much about Fry, except that she\u2019s coming along nicely with another dec to go before she\u2019s done. Although it\u2019s not clear to any of us whether that means Fry\u2019ll be all done and good to go, or if Dove\u2019s just referring to the surgery. Then we get distracted with all the rest of the stuff in the message.\nIt\u2019s full of clips from the Dirt, two-steppers talking about Fry like they all knew her and what it was like out here and what going out for sushi meant. Some two-steppers didn\u2019t seem to care much but some of them were stark spinning bugfuck.\nI mean, it\u2019s been a great big while since I was a biped and we live so long out here that we tend to morph along with the times. The two-stepper I was couldn\u2019t get a handle on me as I am now. But then neither could the octo I was when I finished rehab and met my first crew.\nI didn\u2019t choose octo\u2014back then, surgery wasn\u2019t as advanced and nanorectics weren\u2019t as commonplace or as programmable so you got whatever the doctors thought gave you the best chance of a life worth living. I wasn\u2019t too happy at first but it\u2019s hard to be unhappy in a place this beautiful, especially when you feel so good physically all the time. It was somewhere between three and four J-years after I turned that people could finally choose what kind of sushi they went out for, but I got no regrets. Anymore. I\u2019ve got it smooth all over.\nOnly I don\u2019t feel too smooth listening to two-steppers chewing the air over things they don\u2019t know anything about and puking up words like abominations, atrocities, and subhuman monsters. One news program even runs clips from the most recent remake of The Goddam Island Of Fucking Dr. Moreau. Like that\u2019s holy writ or something.\nI can\u2019t stand more than a few minutes before I take my kribble into my bolthole, close the hatch, and hit soundproof.\nA little while later, Glynis beeps. \u201cYou know how way back in the extreme dead past, people in the Dirt thought everything in the universe revolved around them?\u201d She pauses but I don\u2019t answer. \u201cThen the scope of human knowledge expanded and we all know that was wrong.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d I grunt.\n\u201cNot everybody got the memo,\u201d she says. She waits for me to say something. \u201cCome on, Arkae\u2014are they gonna get to see Okeke-Hightower?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to give them a ride on it,\u201d I say.\n\u201cNone of them are gonna come out here with us abominations. They\u2019re all gonna cuddle up with each other in the Dirt and drown in each other\u2019s shit. Until they all do the one thing they were pooped into this universe to do, which is become extinct.\u201d\nI open the door. \u201cYou\u2019re really baiting them, you know that?\u201d\n\u201cBaiting who? There\u2019s nobody listening. Nobody here except us sushi,\u201d she says, managing to sound sour and utterly innocent both at the same time. Only Glynis.\nI message Dove to say we\u2019ll be Down Under for at least two J-days, on loan to OuterComm. Population in the outer part of the system, especially around Saturn, has doubled in the last couple of J-years and will probably double again in less time. The civil communication network runs below the plane of the solar disk and it\u2019s completely dedicated\u2014no governments, no military, just small business, entertainment, and social interaction. Well, so far, it\u2019s completely dedicated but nobody\u2019s in any position for a power grab yet.\nOuterComm is an Ice Giants operation and originally it served only the Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune systems. No one seems to know exactly where the home office is\u2014i.e. which moon. I figure even if they started off as far out as Uranus, they\u2019ve probably been on Titan since they decided to expand to Jupiter.\nAnyway, their technology is crazy-great. It still takes something over forty minutes for Hello to get from the Big J to Saturn and another forty till you hear, Who the hell is this? but you get less noise than a local call on JovOp. JovOp wasn\u2019t too happy when the entertainment services started migrating to OuterComm and things got kind of tense. Then they cut a deal: OuterComm got all the entertainment and stayed out of the education business, at least in the Jovian system. So everything\u2019s fine and JovOp loans them anything they need like a big old friendly neighbor but there\u2019s still plenty of potential for trouble. Of all kinds.\nThe Jovian system is the divide between the inner planets and the outer. We\u2019ve had governments that tried to align with the innies and others that courted the outies. The current government wants the Big J officially designated as an outer world, not just an ally. Saturn\u2019s been fighting it, claiming that Big J wants to take over and build an empire.\nWhich is pretty much what Mars and Earth said when the last government was trying to get inner status. Earth was a little more colorful about it. There were two-steppers hollering that it was all a plot by monsters and abominations\u2014i.e. us\u2014to get our unholy limbs on fresh meat for our unholy appetites. If Big J got inner planet status, they said, people would be rounded up in the streets and shipped out to be changed into unnatural, subhuman creatures with no will of their own. Except for the most beautiful women, who would be kept as is and chained in brothels where\u2014well, you get the idea.\nThat alone would be enough to make me vote outie, except the Big J is really neither outie nor innie. The way I see it, there\u2019s inner, there\u2019s outer, and there\u2019s us. Which doesn\u2019t fit the way two-steppers do things because it\u2019s not binary.\nThis was all sort of bubbling away at the back of my mind while we worked on the comm station but in an idle sort of way. I was also thinking about Fry, wondering how she was doing, and what shape she\u2019d be in the next time I saw her. I wondered if I\u2019d recognize her.\nNow, that sounds kind of silly, I guess because you don\u2019t recognize someone that, for all intents and purposes, you\u2019ve never seen before. But it\u2019s that spiritual thing. I had this idea that if I swam into a room full of sushi, all kinds of sushi, and Fry was there, I would know. And if I gave it a little time, I\u2019d find her without anyone having to point her out.\nNo question, I loved Fry the two-stepper. Now that she was sushi, I wondered if I\u2019d be in love with her. I couldn\u2019t decide whether I liked that idea or not. Normally I keep things simple: sex, and only with people I like. It keeps everything pretty smooth. But in love complicates everything. You start thinking about partnership and family. And that\u2019s not so smooth because we don\u2019t reproduce. We\u2019ve got new sushi and fresh sushi, but no sushi kids.\nWe\u2019re still working on surviving out here but it won\u2019t always be that way. I could live long enough to see that. Hell, there are still a few OG around, although I\u2019ve never met them. They\u2019re all out in the Ice Giants.\nWe\u2019re home half a dec before the first Okeke-Hightower impact, which sounds like plenty of time but it\u2019s close enough to make me nervous. Distances out here aren\u2019t safe, even in the best top-of-the-line JovOp can. I hate being in a can anyway. If anyone ever develops a jellie for long-distance travel, I\u2019ll be their best friend forever. But even in the can, we had to hit three oases going and coming to refuel. Filing a flight plan guaranteed us a berth at each one but only if we were on time. And there\u2019s all kinds of shit that could have made us late. If a berth was available we\u2019d still get it. But if there wasn\u2019t, we\u2019d have to wait and hope we didn\u2019t run out of stuff to breathe.\nBait worked the plan out far enough ahead to give us generous ETA windows. But you know how it is\u2014just when you need everything to work the way it\u2019s supposed to, anything that hasn\u2019t gone wrong lately suddenly decides to make up for lost time. I was nervous all the way out, all through the job, and all the way back. The last night on the way back I dreamed that just as we were about to reenter JovOp space, Io exploded and took out everything in half a radian. While we were trying to figure out what to do, something knocked us into a bad spiral that was gonna end dead center in Big Pink. I woke up with Aunt Chovie and Splat peeling me off the wall\u2014so embarrassing. After that, all I wanted to do was go home, slip into a jellie, and watch Okeke-Hightower meet Big J.\nBy this time, the comet\u2019s actually in pieces. The local networks are all comet news, all the time, like there\u2019s nothing else in the solar system or even the universe for that matter. The experts are saying it\u2019s following the same path as the old Shoemaker-Levy and there\u2019s a lot of chatter about what that means. There are those who don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence and Okeke-Hightower is actually some kind of message from an intelligence out in the Oort cloud or even beyond, and instead of letting it crash into Big J, we ought to try catching it, or at least parts of it.\nYeah, that could happen. JovOp put out a blanket no-fly\u2014jellies only, no cans. Sheerluck suggests JovOp\u2019s got a secret mission to grab some fragments but that\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, aside from the fact that any can capable of doing that would be plainly visible, the comet\u2019s been sailing around in pieces for over half a dozen square decs. There were easier places in the trajectory to get a piece but all the experts agreed the scans showed nothing in it worth the fortune it would cost to mount that kind of mission. Funny how so many people forgot about that; suddenly, they\u2019re all shoulda-woulda-coulda, like non-buyer\u2019s remorse. But don\u2019t get me started on politics.\nI leave a message for Dove saying we\u2019re back and getting ready to watch the show. What comes back is an auto-reply saying she\u2019s out of the office, reply soonest. Maybe she\u2019s busy with Fry, who probably has comet fever like everyone else but maybe even more so, since this will be like the big moment that kicks off her new life. If she\u2019s not out of the hospital, I hope they\u2019ve got a screen worthy of the event.\nWe all want to see it with our naked eyes. Well, our naked eyes and telescopes. Glynis is bringing a screen for anyone who wants a really close-up look. Considering the whole thing\u2019s gonna last about an hour start to finish, maybe that\u2019s not such a bad idea. It could save us some eyestrain.\nWhen the first fragment hits, I find myself thinking about the sensors that fell into the atmosphere. They\u2019ve got to be long gone by now and even if they\u2019re not, there\u2019s no way we could pick up any data. It would all be just noise.\nHalfway through the impacts, the government overrides all the communication for a recorded, no-reply announcement: martial law\u2019s been declared, everybody go home. Anyone who doesn\u2019t is dust.\nThis means we miss the last few hits, which pisses us off even though we all agree it\u2019s not a sight worth dying for. But when we get home and can\u2019t even get an instant replay, we start wondering. Then we start ranting. The government\u2019s gonna have a lot of explaining to do and the next election ain\u2019t gonna be a lovefest and when did JovOp turn into a government lackey. There\u2019s nothing on the news\u2014and I mean, nothing, it\u2019s all reruns. Like this is actually two J-days ago and what just happened never happened.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Fred, \u201cwhat\u2019s on OuterComm?\u201d\n\u201cYou want to watch soap operas?\u201d Dubonnet fumes. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d\nWe\u2019re looking at the menu when something new appears: it\u2019s called the Soledad y Gottmundsdottir Farewell Special. The name has me thinking we\u2019re about to see Fry in her old two-stepper incarnation but what comes up on the screen is a chambered Nautilus.\n\u201cHi, everybody. How do you like the new me?\u201d Fry says.\n\u201cWhat, is she going to law school?\u201d Aunt Chovie says, shocked.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to leave you a canned goodbye because you\u2019ve all been so great,\u201d Fry goes on and I have to knot my arms together to keep from turning the thing off. This doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s gonna end well. \u201cI knew even before I came out here that I\u2019d be going out for sushi. I just couldn\u2019t decide what kind. You guys had me thinking seriously about octo\u2014it\u2019s a pretty great life and everything you do matters. Future generations\u2014well, it\u2019s going to be amazing out here. Life that adapted to space. Who knows, maybe someday Jovian citizens will change bodies like two-steppers change their clothes. It could happen.\n\u201cBut like a lot of two-steppers, I\u2019m impatient. I know, I\u2019m not a two-stepper anymore and I\u2019ve got a far longer life span now so I don\u2019t have to be impatient. But I am. I wanted to be part of something that\u2019s taking the next step\u2014the next big step\u2014right now. I really believe the Jupiter Colony is what I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d\n\u201cThe Jupiter Colony? They\u2019re cranks! They\u2019re suicidal!\u201d Glynis hits the ceiling, banks off a wall, and comes down again.\nFry unfurls her tentacles and lets them wave around freely. \u201cCalm down, whoever\u2019s yelling,\u201d she says, sounding amused. \u201cI made contact with them just before I crewed up with you. I knew what they were planning. They wouldn\u2019t tell me when, but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out that the Okeke-Hightower impact was the perfect opportunity. We\u2019ve collected some jellies, muted them, and put in yak-yak loops. I don\u2019t know how the next part works, how we\u2019re going to hitch a ride with the comet\u2014I\u2019m not an astrophysicist. But if it works, we\u2019ll seed the clouds with ourselves.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all chambered Nautiluses on this trip. It\u2019s the best form for packing a lot of data. But we\u2019ve made one small change: we\u2019re linked together, shell-to-shell, so we all have access to each other\u2019s data. Not too private but we aren\u2019t going into exile as separate hermits. There should still be some sensors bobbing around in the upper levels\u2014the Colony\u2019s had allies tossing various things in on the sly. We can use whatever\u2019s there to build a cloud-borne colony.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure it\u2019ll work. Maybe we\u2019ll all get gravitated to smithereens. But if we can fly long enough for the jellies to convert to parasails\u2014the engineers figured that out, don\u2019t ask me\u2014we might figure out not only how to survive but thrive.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to let you know. Not until we get around the interference problem. I don\u2019t know much about that, either, but if I last long enough, I\u2019ll learn.\n\u201cDove says right now, you\u2019re all Down Under on loan to OuterComm. I\u2019m going to send this message so it bounces around the Ice Giants for a while before it gets to you and with any luck, you\u2019ll find it not too long after we enter the atmosphere. I hope none of you are too mad at me. Or at least that you don\u2019t stay mad at me. It\u2019s not entirely impossible that we\u2019ll meet again some day. If we do, I\u2019d like it to be as friends.\n\u201cEspecially if the Jovian independence movement gets\u2014\u201d she laughs. \u201cI was about to say, \u2018gets off the ground.\u2019 If the Jovian independence movement ever achieves a stable orbit\u2014or something. I think it\u2019s a really good idea. Anyway, goodbye for now.\n\u201cOh, and Arkae?\u201d Her tentacles undulate wildly. \u201cI had no idea wormy would feel so good.\u201d\nWe just got that one play before the JCC blacked it out. The feds took us all in for questioning. Not surprising. But it wasn\u2019t just Big J feds\u2014Dirt feds suddenly popped up out of nowhere, some of them in-person and some of them long-distance via comm units clamped to mobies. The latter is a big waste unless there\u2019s some benefit to having a conversation as slowly as possible. Because even a fed on Mars can\u2019t do anything about the speed of light\u2014it\u2019s still gonna be at least an hour between the question and the answer, usually more.\nThe Dirt feds who were actually here were all working undercover, keeping an eye on things, and reporting whatever they heard or saw to HQ back in the Dirt. This didn\u2019t go down so well with most of us out here, even two-steppers. It became a real governmental crisis, mainly because no one in charge could get their stories straight. Some were denying any knowledge of Dirt spies, some were trying to spin it so it was all for our benefit, so we wouldn\u2019t lose any rights\u2014don\u2019t ask me which ones, they didn\u2019t say. Conspiracy theories blossomed faster than anyone could keep track.\nFinally, the ruling council resigned; the acting council replacing them till the next election are almost all sushi. That\u2019s a first.\nIt\u2019s still another dec and a half till the election. JovOp usually backs two-steppers but there are noticeably fewer political ads for bipeds this time around. I think even they can see the points on the trajectory.\nA lot of sushi are already celebrating, talking about the changing face of government in the Jovian system. I\u2019m not quite ready to party. I\u2019m actually a little bit worried about us. We were born to be sushi but we weren\u2019t born sushi. We all started out as two-steppers and while we may have shed binary thinking, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re completely enlightened. There\u2019s already some talk about how most of the candidates are chambered Nautiluses and there ought to be more octos or puffers or crabs. I don\u2019t like the sound of that but it\u2019s too late to make a break for the Colony now. Not that I would. Even if Fry and all her fellow colonists are surviving and thriving, I\u2019m not ready to give up the life I have for a whole new world. We\u2019ll just have to see what happens.\nHey, I told you not to get me started on politics.\nOriginally published in Edge of Infinity by Jonathan Strahan.\nPat Cadigan was born in Schenectady, New York, and now lives in London with her family. She made her first professional sale in 1980, and has subsequently come to be regarded as one of the best new writers of her generation. Her story \"Pretty Boy Crossover\" has appeared on several critic's lists as among the best science fiction stories of the 1980's, and her story \"Angel\" was a finalist for the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, and the World Fantasy Award (one of the few stories ever to earn that rather unusual distinction). Her short fiction--which has appeared in most of the major markets, including Asimov's Science\nFiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction--has been gathered in the collections Patterns and Dirty Work. Her first novel, Mindplayers, was released in 1987 to excellent critical response, and her second novel, Synners, released in 1991, won the Arthur C. Clarke Award as the year's best science-fiction novel, as did her third novel, Fools, making her the only writer ever to win the Clarke Award twice. Her other books include the novels Dervish Is Digital, Tea from an Empty Cup, and Reality Used to Be a Friend of Mine, and, as editor, the anthology The Ultimate Cyberpunk, as well as two making-of movie books and four media tie-in novels."}

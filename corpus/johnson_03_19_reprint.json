The people climb in and look underneath, touch the white enamel, run their hands along the little lion\u2019s feet. When they\u2019re done, four chains are lowered from the proscenium stage\u2019s fly space. Aimee secures them to holes drilled along the tub\u2019s lip, gives a signal, and the bathtub is hoisted ten feet into the air.\nShe sets a stepladder next to it. She claps her hands and the 26 monkeys on stage run up the ladder one after the other and jump into the bathtub. The bathtub shakes as each monkey thuds in among the others. The audience can see heads, legs, tails; but eventually every monkey settles and the bathtub is still again. Zeb is always the last monkey up the ladder. As he climbs into the bathtub, he makes a humming boom deep in his chest. It fills the stage.\nAnd then there\u2019s a flash of light, two of the chains fall off, and the bathtub swings down to expose its interior.\nEmpty.\n3.\nThey turn up later, back at the tour bus. There\u2019s a smallish dog door, and in the hours before morning, the monkeys let themselves in, alone or in small groups, and get themselves glasses of water from the tap. If more than one returns at the same time, they murmur a bit among themselves, like college students meeting in the dorm halls after bar time. A few sleep on the sofa, and at least one likes to be on the bed, but most of them wander back to their cages. There\u2019s a little grunting as they rearrange their blankets and soft toys, and then sighs and snoring. Aimee doesn\u2019t really sleep until she hears them all come in.\nAimee has no idea what happens to them in the bathtub, or where they go, or what they do before the soft click of the dog door opening. This bothers her a lot.\n4.\nAimee has had the act for three years now. She was living in a month-by-month furnished apartment under a flight path for the Salt Lake City airport. She was hollow, as if something had chewed a hole in her body and the hole had grown infected.\nThere was a monkey act at the Utah State Fair. She felt a sudden and totally out-of-character urge to see it, and afterward, with no idea why, she walked up to the owner and said, \u201cI have to buy this.\u201d\nHe nodded. He sold it to her for a dollar, which he told her was the price he had paid four years before.\nLater, when the paperwork was filled out, she asked him, \u201cHow can you leave them? Won\u2019t they miss you?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see, they\u2019re pretty autonomous,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, they\u2019ll miss me and I\u2019ll miss them. But it\u2019s time, they know that.\u201d\nHe smiled at his new wife, a small woman with laugh lines and a vervet hanging from one hand. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to have a garden,\u201d she said.\nHe was right. The monkeys missed him. But they also welcomed her, each monkey politely shaking her hand as she walked into what was now her bus.\n5.\nAimee has: a 19-year-old tour bus packed with cages that range in size from parrot-sized (for the vervets) to something about the size of a pickup bed (for all the macaques); a stack of books on monkeys ranging from All About Monkeys to Evolution and Ecology of Baboon Societies; some sequined show costumes, a sewing machine, and a bunch of Carhartts and tees; a stack of show posters from a few years back that say 24 MONKEYS! FACE THE ABYSS; a battered sofa in a virulent green plaid; and a boyfriend who helps with the monkeys.\nShe cannot tell you why she has any of these, not even the boyfriend, whose name is Geof, whom she met in Billings seven months ago. Aimee has no idea where anything comes from anymore: she no longer believes that anything makes sense, even though she can\u2019t stop hoping.\nThe bus smells about as you\u2019d expect a bus full of monkeys to smell; though after a show, after the bathtub trick but before the monkeys all return, it also smells of cinnamon, which is the tea Aimee sometimes drinks.\n6.\nFor the act, the monkeys do tricks, or dress up in outfits and act out hit movies\u2014The Matrix is very popular, as is anything where the monkeys dress up like little orcs. The maned monkeys, the lion-tails and the colobuses, have a lion-tamer act, with the old capuchin female, Pango, dressed in a red jacket and carrying a whip and a small chair. The chimpanzee (whose name is Mimi, and no, she is not a monkey) can do actual sleight-of-hand; she\u2019s not very good, but she\u2019s the best Chimp Pulling A Coin From Someone\u2019s Ear in the world.\nThe monkeys also can build a suspension bridge out of wood chairs and rope, make a four-tier champagne fountain, and write their names on a whiteboard.\nThe monkey show is very popular, with a schedule of 127 shows this year at fairs and festivals across the Midwest and Great Plains. Aimee could do more, but she likes to let everyone have a couple months off at Christmas.\n7.\nThis is the bathtub act:\nAimee wears a glittering purple-black dress designed to look like a scanty magician\u2019s robe. She stands in front of a scrim lit deep blue and scattered with stars. The monkeys are ranged in front of her. As she speaks they undress and fold their clothes into neat piles. Zeb sits on his stool to one side, a white spotlight shining straight down to give him a shadowed look.\nShe raises her hands.\n\u201cThese monkeys have made you laugh, and made you gasp. They have created wonders for you and performed mysteries. But there is a final mystery they offer you\u2014the strangest, the greatest of all.\u201d\nShe parts her hands suddenly, and the scrim goes transparent and is lifted away, revealing the bathtub on a raised dais. She walks around it, running her hand along the tub\u2019s curves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple thing, this bathtub. Ordinary in every way, mundane as breakfast. In a moment I will invite members of the audience up to let you prove this for yourselves.\n\u201cBut for the monkeys it is also a magical object. It allows them to travel\u2014no one can say where. Not even I\u2014\"she pauses \u201c\u2014can tell you this. Only the monkeys know, and they share no secrets.\n\u201cWhere do they go? Into heaven, foreign lands, other worlds\u2014or some dark abyss? We cannot follow. They will vanish before our eyes, vanish from this most ordinary of things.\u201d\nAnd after the bathtub is inspected and she has told the audience that there will be no final spectacle in the show\u2014\u201cIt will be hours before they return from their secret travels\u201d\u2014and called for applause for them, she gives the cue.\n8.\nAimee\u2019s monkeys:\n- 2 siamangs, a mated couple\n- 2 squirrel monkeys, though they\u2019re so active they might as well be twice as many\n- 2 vervets\n- a guenon, who is probably pregnant, though it\u2019s still too early to tell for sure. Aimee has no idea how this happened\n- 3 rhesus monkeys. They juggle a little\n- an older capuchin female named Pango\n- a crested macaque, 3 snow monkeys (one quite young), and a Java macaque. Despite the differences, they have formed a small troop and like to sleep together\n- a chimpanzee, who is not actually a monkey\n- a surly gibbon\n- 2 marmosets\n- a golden tamarin; a cotton-top tamarin\n- a proboscis monkey\n- red and black colubuses\n- Zeb\n9.\nAimee thinks Zeb might be a de Brazza\u2019s guenon, except that he\u2019s so old that he has lost almost all his hair. She worries about his health but he insists on staying in the act. By now all he\u2019s really up for is the final rush to the bathtub, and for him it is more of a stroll. The rest of the time, he sits on a stool that is painted orange and silver and watches the other monkeys, looking like an aging impresario watching his Swan Lake from the wings. Sometimes she gives him things to hold, such as a silver hoop through which the squirrel monkeys jump.\n10.\nNo one knows how the monkeys vanish or where they go. Sometimes they return holding foreign coins or durian fruit, or wearing pointed Moroccan slippers. Every so often one returns pregnant. The number of monkeys is not constant.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Aimee keeps asking Geof, as if he has any idea. Aimee never knows anything anymore. She\u2019s been living without any certainties, and this one thing\u2014well, the whole thing, the fact the monkeys get along so well and know how to do card tricks and just turned up in her life and vanish from the bathtub; everything\u2014she coasts with that most of the time, but every so often, when she feels her life is wheeling without brakes down a long hill, she starts poking at this again.\nGeof trusts the universe a lot more than Aimee does, trusts that things make sense and that people can love, and therefore he doesn\u2019t need the same proofs. \u201cYou could ask them,\u201d he says.\n11.\nAimee\u2019s boyfriend:\nGeof is not at all what Aimee expected from a boyfriend. For one thing, he\u2019s fifteen years younger than Aimee, 28 to her 43. For another, he\u2019s sort of quiet. For a third, he\u2019s gorgeous, silky thick hair pulled into a shoulder-length ponytail, shaved sides showing off his strong jawline. He smiles a lot, but he doesn\u2019t laugh very often.\nGeof has a degree in history, which means that he was working in a bike-repair shop when she met him at the Montana Fair. Aimee never has much to do right after the show, so when he offered to buy her a beer she said yes. And then it was 4 AM and they were kissing in the bus, monkeys letting themselves in and getting ready for bed; and Aimee and Geof made love.\nIn the morning over breakfast, the monkeys came up one by one and shook his hand solemnly, and then he was with the band, so to speak. She helped him pick up his cameras and clothes and the surfboard his sister had painted for him one year as a Christmas present. There\u2019s no room for the surfboard so it\u2019s suspended from the ceiling. Sometimes the squirrel monkeys hang out there and peek over the side.\nAimee and Geof never talk about love.\nGeof has a class-C driver\u2019s license, but this is just lagniappe.\n12.\nZeb is dying.\nGenerally speaking, the monkeys are remarkably healthy and Aimee can handle their occasional sinus infections and gastrointestinal ailments. For anything more difficult, she\u2019s found a couple of communities online and some helpful specialists.\nBut Zeb\u2019s coughing some, and the last of his fur is falling out. He moves very slowly and sometimes has trouble remembering simple tasks. When the show was up in St. Paul six months ago, a Como Zoo biologist came to visit the monkeys, complimented her on their general health and well-being, and at her request looked Zeb over.\n\u201cHow old is he?\u201d the biologist, Gina, asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Aimee said. The man she bought the show from hadn\u2019t known either.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you then,\u201d Gina said. \u201cHe\u2019s old. I mean, seriously old.\u201d\nSenile dementia, arthritis, a heart murmur. No telling when, Gina said. \u201cHe\u2019s a happy monkey,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll go when he goes.\u201d\n13.\nAimee thinks a lot about this. What happens to the act when Zeb\u2019s dead? Through each show he sits calm and poised on his bright stool. She feels he is somehow at the heart of the monkeys\u2019 amiability and cleverness. She keeps thinking that he is somehow the reason the monkeys all vanish and return.\nBecause there\u2019s always a reason for everything, isn\u2019t there? Because if there isn\u2019t a reason for even one thing, like how you can get sick, or your husband stop loving you, or people you love die\u2014then there\u2019s no reason for anything. So there must be reasons. Zeb\u2019s as good a guess as any.\n14.\nWhat Aimee likes about this life:\nIt doesn\u2019t mean anything. She doesn\u2019t live anywhere. Her world is 38 feet and 127 shows long and currently 26 monkeys deep. This is manageable.\nFairs don\u2019t mean anything, either. Her tiny world travels within a slightly larger world, the identical, interchangeable fairs. Sometimes the only things that cue Aimee to the town she\u2019s in are the nighttime temperatures and the shape of the horizon: badlands, mountains, plains, or skyline.\nFairs are as artificial as titanium knees: the carnival, the animal barns, the stock-car races, the concerts, the smell of burned sugar and funnel cakes and animal bedding. Everything is an overly bright symbol for something real, food or pets or hanging out with friends. None of this has anything to do with the world Aimee used to live in, the world from which these people visit.\nShe has decided that Geof is like the rest of it: temporary, meaningless. Not for loving.\n15.\nThese are some ways Aimee\u2019s life might have come apart:\n- She might have broken her ankle a few years ago, and gotten a bone infection that left her on crutches for ten months, and in pain for longer.\n- Her husband might have fallen in love with his admin and left her.\n- She might have been fired from her job in the same week she found out her sister had colon cancer.\n- She might have gone insane for a time and made a series of questionable choices that left her alone in a furnished apartment in a city she picked out of the atlas.\nNothing is certain. You can lose everything. Eventually, even at your luckiest, you will die and then you will lose it all. When you are a certain age or when you have lost certain things and people, Aimee\u2019s crippling grief will make a terrible poisoned dark sense.\n16.\nAimee has read up a lot, so she knows how strange all this is.\nThere aren\u2019t any locks on the cages. The monkeys use them as bedrooms, places to store their special possessions and get away from the others when they want some privacy. Much of the time, however, they are loose in the bus or poking around in the worn grass around it.\nRight now, three monkeys are sitting on the bed playing a game where they match colored balls. Others are playing with skeins of bright wool, or rolling around on the floor, or poking at a piece of wood with a screwdriver, or climbing on Aimee and Geof and the battered sofa. Some of the monkeys are crowded around the computer watching kitten videos on a pirated wireless connection.\nThe black colubus is stacking children\u2019s wooden blocks on the kitchenette\u2019s table. He brought them back one night a couple of weeks ago, and since then he\u2019s been trying to make an arch. After two weeks and Aimee\u2019s showing him repeatedly how a keystone works, he still hasn\u2019t figured it out, but he\u2019s still patiently trying.\nGeof\u2019s reading a novel out loud to the capuchin Pango, who watches the pages as if she\u2019s reading along. Sometimes she points to a word and looks up at him with her bright eyes, and he repeats it to her, smiling, and then spells it out.\nZeb is sleeping in his cage: he crept in there at dusk, fluffed up his toys and his blanket, and pulled the door closed behind him. He does this a lot lately.\n17.\nAimee\u2019s going to lose Zeb, and then what? What happens to the other monkeys? 26 monkeys is a lot of monkeys, but they all like each other. No one except maybe a zoo or a circus can keep that many monkeys, and she doesn\u2019t think anyone else will let them sleep wherever they like or watch kitten videos. And if Zeb\u2019s not there, where will they go, those nights when they can no longer drop through the bathtub and into their mystery? And she doesn\u2019t even know whether it is Zeb, whether he is the cause of this, or that\u2019s just her flailing for reasons again.\nAnd Aimee? She\u2019ll lose her safe artificial world: the bus, the identical fairs, the meaningless boyfriend. The monkeys. And then what?\n18.\nJust a few months after she bought the act, when she didn\u2019t care much about whether she lived or died, she followed the monkeys up the ladder in the closing act. Zeb raced up the ladder, stepped into the bathtub and stood, lungs filling for his great call. And she ran up after him. She glimpsed the bathtub\u2019s interior, the monkeys tidily sardined in, scrambling to get out of her way as they realized what she was doing. She hopped into the hole they made for her, curled up tight.\nThis only took an instant. Zeb finished his breath, boomed it out. There was a flash of light, she heard the chains release, and felt the bathtub swing down, monkeys shifting around her.\nShe fell the ten feet alone. Her ankle twisted when she hit the stage but she managed to stay upright. The monkeys were gone again.\nThere was an awkward silence. It wasn\u2019t one of her more successful performances.\n19.\nAimee and Geof walk through the midway at the Salina Fair. She\u2019s hungry and doesn\u2019t want to cook, so they\u2019re looking for somewhere that sells $4.50 hotdogs and $3.25 Cokes, and suddenly Geof turns to Aimee and says, \u201cThis is bullshit. Why don\u2019t we go into town? Have real food. Act like normal people.\u201d\nSo they do: pasta and wine at a place called Irina\u2019s Villa. \u201cYou\u2019re always asking why they go,\u201d Geof says, a bottle and a half in. His eyes are an indeterminate blue-gray, but in this light they look black and very warm. \u201cSee, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to find out what happens. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the real question, anyway. Maybe the question is, why do they come back?\u201d\nAimee thinks of the foreign coins, the wood blocks, the wonderful things they bring home. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy do they come back?\u201d\nLater that night, back at the bus, Geof says, \u201cWherever they go, yeah, it\u2019s cool. But see, here\u2019s my theory.\u201d He gestures to the crowded bus with its clutter of toys and tools. The two tamarins have just come in, and they\u2019re sitting on the kitchenette counter, heads close as they examine some new small thing. \u201cThey like visiting wherever it is, sure. But this is their home. Everyone likes to come home sooner or later.\u201d\n\u201cIf they have a home,\u201d Aimee says.\n\u201cEveryone has a home, even if they don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d Geof says.\n20.\nThat night, when Geof\u2019s asleep curled up around one of the macaques, Aimee kneels by Zeb\u2019s cage. \u201cCan you at least show me?\u201d she asks. \u201cPlease? Before you go?\u201d\nZeb is an indeterminate lump under his baby-blue blanket, but he gives a little sigh and climbs slowly out of his cage. He takes her hand with his own hot leathery paw, and they walk out the door into the night.\nThe back lot where all the trailers and buses are parked is quiet, only a few voices still audible from behind curtained windows. The sky is blue-black and scattered with stars. The moon shines straight down on them, leaving Zeb\u2019s face shadowed. His eyes when he looks up seem bottomless.\nThe bathtub is backstage, already on its wheeled dais waiting for the next show. The space is nearly pitch-dark, lit by some red EXIT signs, and a single sodium-vapor away off to one side. Zeb walks her up to the tub, lets her run her hands along its cold curves and the lion\u2019s paws, and shows her the dimly lit interior.\nAnd then he heaves himself onto the dais and over the tub lip. She stands beside him, looking down. He lifts himself upright and gives his great boom. And then he drops flat and the bathtub is empty.\nShe saw it, him vanishing. He was there and then he was gone. But there was nothing to see, no gate, no flickering reality or soft pop as air snapped in to fill the vacated space. It still doesn\u2019t make sense, but it\u2019s the answer that Zeb has.\nHe\u2019s already back at the bus when she gets there, already buried under his blanket and wheezing in his sleep.\n21.\nThen one day:\nEveryone is backstage. Aimee is finishing her makeup, and Geof is double-checking everything. The monkeys are sitting neatly in a circle in the dressing room, as if trying to keep their bright vests and skirts from creasing. Zeb sits in the middle, beside Pango in her little green sequined outfit. They grunt a bit, then lean back. One after the other, the rest of the monkeys crawl forward and shake his hand, and then hers. She nods, like a small queen at a flower show.\nThat night, Zeb doesn\u2019t run up the ladder. He stays on his stool and it\u2019s Pango who is the last monkey up the ladder, who climbs into the bathtub and gives a screech. Aimee has been wrong that it is Zeb who is still the heart of what is happening with the monkeys, but she was so sure of it that she missed all the cues. But Geof didn\u2019t miss a thing, so when Pango screeches, he hits the flash powder. The flash, the empty bathtub.\nZeb stands on his stool, bowing like an impresario called on stage for the curtain call. When the curtain drops for the last time, he reaches up to be lifted. Aimee cuddles him as they walk back to the bus, Geof\u2019s arm around them both.\nZeb falls asleep with them that night, between them in the bed. When she wakes up in the morning, he\u2019s back in his cage with his favorite toy. He doesn\u2019t wake up. The monkeys cluster at the bars peeking in.\nAimee cries all day. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Geof says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Zeb,\u201d she sobs.\n\u201cI know,\u201d he says.\n22.\nHere\u2019s the trick to the bathtub trick. There is no trick. The monkeys pour across the stage and up the ladder and into the bathtub and they settle in and then they vanish. The world is full of strange things, things that make no sense, and maybe this is one of them. Maybe the monkeys choose not to share, that\u2019s cool, who can blame them.\nMaybe this is the monkeys\u2019 mystery, how they found other monkeys that ask questions and try things, and figured out a way to all be together to share it. Maybe Aimee and Geof are really just houseguests in the monkeys\u2019 world: they are there for a while and then they leave.\n23.\nSix weeks later, a man walks up to Aimee as she and Geof kiss after a show. He\u2019s short, pale, balding. He has the shell-shocked look of a man eaten hollow from the inside. She knows the look.\n\u201cI need to buy this,\u201d he says.\nAimee nods. \u201cI know you do.\u201d\nShe sells it to him for a dollar.\n24.\nThree months later, Aimee and Geof get their first houseguest in their apartment in Bellingham. They hear the refrigerator close and come out to the kitchen to find Pango pouring orange juice from a carton.\nThey send her home with a pinochle deck.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, July 2008.\nKij Johnson is the author of several novels, including The Fox Woman and Fudoki, and a short story collection, At the Mouth of the River of Bees.

This month, the long-running British space-rock band Hawkwind will do the same with the release of The Machine Stops\u2014an album that musically interprets E. M. Forster\u2019s dystopian novelette of the same name, published in 1909.\nAlthough Forster was better known for his realistic, contemporaneous novels, most famously A Passage to India, the Nobel-nominated author imbued \u201cThe Machine Stops\u201d with a prescience that rivals the most forward-thinking science fiction classics. In it, the post-apocalyptic civilization of the future has been driven underground; people interact virtually through electronic devices and rely on the omnipotent Machine for all their needs.\nNot only does Forster\u2019s screed against technocracy bear chilling parallels to the most pessimistic views of the Internet today, it\u2019s perfect material for Hawkwind. Since forming in the London neighborhood of Ladbroke Grove in 1969\u2014sparked in part by Pink Floyd\u2019s spacey songs of the \u201960s like \u201cAstronomy Domine,\u201d \u201cInterstellar Overdrive,\u201d and \u201cSet the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\u201d\u2014the cult outfit has been one of rock music\u2019s foremost champions of SFF.\nTheir best-known song, 1972\u2019s British Top-Ten single \u201cSilver Machine,\u201d turned hypnotic, brutally psychedelic riffs into a vessel for extraterrestrial exploration, one that \u201cflies sideways through time\u201d\u2014part of a \u201cshamanistic space ritual,\u201d as Rob Young calls it in Electric Eden: Unearthing Britain\u2019s Visionary Music, a description that echoes the title of Hawkwind\u2019s epochal 1973 album Space Ritual Live Alive in Liverpool and London.\nAs willfully primitive as Hawkwind sounded, they incorporated cutting-edge synthesizers, playing them with rudimentary gusto rather than trying to make them sound neoclassical like so many of their progressive rock peers, such as Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. As Dave Brock\u2014co-founder of Hawkwind and the band\u2019s only consistent member throughout its existence\u2014said in 1990, \u201cI prefer to be a barbarian with the machines as it were, and just muck around.\u201d\nThat mucking around with emerging technology produced some of the most visceral yet cerebral rock \u2018n\u2019 roll ever made\u2014a volatile alchemy that influenced electronic music as well as punk and heavy metal. That the band\u2019s bassist and occasional lead vocalist in the early \u201970s was Ian \u201cLemmy\u201d Kilmister\u2014who would go on to front the legendary metal trio Mot\u00f6rhead before passing away in December of 2015\u2014certainly didn\u2019t hurt in that regard.\nHawkwind isn\u2019t the first band to have paid musical tribute to Forster\u2019s The Machine Stops: The British jazz-pop group Level 42 released a song in 1983 titled \u201cThe Machine Stops\u201d whose lyrics are based on the story. And Hawkwind\u2019s The Machine Stops isn\u2019t the first time Brock and crew have devoted an entire record to the work of a single science fiction/fantasy author. The Chronicle of the Black Sword, released in 1985, draws from the Eternal Champion stories of Michael Moorcock, specifically the characters Elric of Melnibon\u00e9 and Jerry Cornelius, with Moorcock receiving a songwriting credit for his lyrics on the track \u201cSleep of a Thousand Tears.\u201d Ten years prior, Hawkwind plumbed the same source for much of their 1975 album Warrior on the Edge of Time; Moorcock\u2019s concepts and poetry are incorporated into four of the record\u2019s songs, including the eerie spoken-word track \u201cThe Wizard Blew His Horn.\u201d\nIt only made sense that Moorcock\u2019s words and ideas wound up on Hawkwind records. The author was not only a fan of Hawkwind\u2014first seeing them perform in the early \u201970s with one of his New Worlds cohorts, the young M. John Harrison, in tow\u2014he wound up playing with Hawkwind. Moorcock also lived in Ladbroke Grove, then a melting pot of rock\u2019s underground subculture, and befriended Brock, Nik Turner, Robert Calvert, and the rest of Hawkwind. Before long, Moorcock was collaborating with the band, not only bringing lyrics to the band but joining them from time to time onstage.\nThe track \u201cThe Black Corridor\u201d from Space Ritual\u2014an eerie, spoken-word piece laden with echoes and cosmic doom\u2014was adapted from Moorcock\u2019s 1969 SF novel of the same name (a collaboration with his then-wife Hilary Bailey); on the same album, \u201cSonic Attack,\u201d was an original set of Moorcock lyrics recited by Calvert through oscillating, disorienting effects. \u201cTry to get as far away from the sonic source as possible,\u201d Calvert warns, and he doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s joking.\nMoorcock also formed his own group called Michael Moorcock & the Deep Fix, aided by various Hawkwind personnel (including Simon House, who would go on to play with rock\u2019s most successful exponent of SFF music, David Bowie, not to mention contributing the memorable violin part to one of best SF-themed songs of the \u201980s, Thomas Dolby\u2019s \u201cShe Blinded Me with Science\u201d). As Moorcock remembers in London Peculiar and Other Nonfiction, \u201cI think it was Dave Brock who encouraged me to do a demo of two songs I\u2019d written, \u2018Dodgem Dude\u2019 and \u2018Starcruiser\u2019\u201d\u2014which led directly to The Deep Fix getting a recording contract of their own.\nThe Deep Fix\u2019s resulting album, 1975\u2019s New Worlds Fair, was named after New Worlds, the revolutionary SFF magazine Moorcock edited; that year he played banjo on Calvert\u2019s second solo album, Lucky Leif and the Longships. Moorcock went on to play guitar on Calvert\u2019s next solo album, 1981\u2019s Hype. Also in \u201981, he wrote lyrics for four songs on Hawkwind\u2019s album Sonic Attack, one of them a revamp of the Sonic Ritual track.\nCalvert, Moorcock\u2019s closest friend in Hawkwind, left the band in 1979, suffering from bipolar disorder, which impaired his ability to make music collectively. Moorcock\u2019s association with Hawkwind effectively ended three years later with his lyrics for Choose Your Masques. The 1982 album also featured Calvert\u2019s last set of lyrics for the group, leftover from 1978 and titled \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d (based on the canonical Ray Bradbury novel). Moorcock\u2019s association with the band continued, including a memorable concert at London\u2019s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985\u2014a lavish stage reenactment of the Elric storyline from The Chronicle of the Black Sword\u2014during which Moorcock himself appeared onstage. In Ian Abrahams\u2019 Hawkwind: Sonic Assassins, Moorcock recounts, \u201cI distributed a bunch of Elric books, throwing them into the audience, and was shocked when people tore them to bits trying to get to them!\u201d\nHawkwind wasn\u2019t the only rock band Moorcock wrote for. His lyrics for Blue \u00d6yster Cult aren\u2019t as numerous as his output for Hawkwind\u2014but they do boast the B\u00d6C song \u201cVeteran of a Thousand Psychic Wars,\u201d which appear in the animated SFF film Heavy Metal. That said, the song reuses a Moorcock line from one of Hawkwind\u2019s earlier, Eternal Champion-themed tracks, \u201cStanding at the Edge.\u201d\nAs if returning the favor, the campy SF novel Time of the Hawklords\u2014billed as co-written by Moorcock and Michael Butterworth\u2014starred thinly veiled members of Hawkwind. Lemmy, for instance, appeared as Count Motorhead, while Nik Turner became The Thunder Rider. Moorcock even pops up as the tongue-in-cheek surrogate Moorlock the Acid Sorcerer.\nMoorcock, however, disowned the book and denied having anything to do with its authorship, although it\u2019s based on many of Moorcock\u2019s concepts. (Two sequels, the prose novel Queens of Deliria and the graphic novel Ledge of Darkness, dispensed entirely with the notion of Moorcock\u2019s involvement.) Still, Time of the Hawklords\u2014not to mention Hawkwind\u2019s cameo in the Jerry Cornelius novel A Cure for Cancer\u2014completed a profound circuit: Inspired by Moorcock\u2019s sprawling mythology, Hawkwind became characters in that mythology.\nMoorcock isn\u2019t the only SFF legend Hawkwind has relied on for inspiration. Roger Zelazny, among the handful of American authors who wrote for Moorcock\u2019s New Worlds, became another of the band\u2019s literary muses. Three of their songs\u20141972\u2019s \u201cLord of Light,\u201d 1977\u2019s \u201cDamnation Alley,\u201d and 1979\u2019s \u201cJack of Shadows,\u201d all either written or co-written by Calvert\u2014were based on Zelazny novels of the same names, reiterating such themes as post-apocalyptic horror, magic meets computers, and how posthumanity dovetails with theology.\n\u201cTime We Left This World Today\u201d from 1972 references the brain police from George Orwell\u2019s Ninety Eighty-Four; \u201cD-Rider\u201d from 1974 mentions dragons and recalls Anne McCaffrey\u2019s Dragonriders of Pern; 1979\u2019s \u201cHigh Rise\u201d adapts J. G. Ballard\u2019s horrific urban dystopia of the same name; \u201cThe War I Survived\u201d from 1988 contains a nod to Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Slaughterhouse-Five; \u201c3 or 4 Erections in the Course of a Night\u201d from 1993 takes its title from a line in the SF movie Dreamscape; and \u201cAlien (I Am)\u201d from 1995 boasts a sample of dialogue from the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \u201cThe Mind\u2019s Eye.\u201d Another song from the same album (Alien 4) is more blatantly named \u201cBeam Me Up.\u201d\nHawkwind\u2019s love for Star Trek is reciprocal. William Shatner covered \u201cSilver Machine\u201d on his 2011 album Seeking Major Tom, lending his authoritative bombast to the astro-psychedelic masterpiece; two years later, former Hawkwind member Nik Turner made a guest appearance on Shatner\u2019s tribute to progressive rock, Ponder the Mystery. In an interview in 2013, Brock enthused about Shatner\u2019s vocals on a new version of \u201cSonic Attack,\u201d which was supposed to appear on Hawkwind\u2019s 2013 album Spacehawks. The remake of the song that wound up on Spacehawks, however, did not feature Shatner, and his version of \u201cSonic Attack\u201d has yet to be released. One can only hope.\nNot that Hawkwind draws only on other creators\u2019 work for their SFF music\u2014they\u2019ve always had a healthy speculative imagination of their own. The ominous countdown of 1973\u2019s apocalyptic \u201cTen Seconds Forever\u201d has, according to Abrahams in Sonic Assassins, \u201cthe unlikely accolade of being the science fiction \u2018Twelve Days of Christmas.\u2019\u201d The 1979 song \u201cUncle Sam\u2019s on Mars\u201d indulges two of Hawkwind\u2019s other passions\u2014radical politics and dark humor.\nThe unsettlingly mechanical \u201cAutomaton,\u201d released in 1978 under the pseudonym The Hawklords, is answered by Hawkwind\u2019s 1979 song \u201cRobot,\u201d which cites Isaac Asimov\u2019s Three Laws of Robotics. The elaborate scenario of \u201cThe Age of the Micro Man,\u201d also from \u201979, involves a nightmare future where millions of workers are enslaved to an industrial elite who believe that the aliens who guide them are angels. Instead of being inspired by a science fiction story, the 1988 song \u201cHeads\u201d\u2014about a group of disembodied heads preserved \u201cin glass booths\u201d and wired together to generate enormous powers\u2014actually predates Greg Bear\u2019s similarly themed novella Heads by three years.\nOne of Hawkwind\u2019s most ambitious original concepts played out on their 1976 album Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music. The title and cover art pay homage to the magazines of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, specifically John W. Campbell\u2019s Astounding Science Fiction and Hugo Gernsback\u2019s Amazing Stories; each track was intended to stand as its own short story, like an anthology in song.\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Hawkwind brought their career in SFF full circle with In Your Area\u2019s live version of \u201cAerospace Age Inferno\u201d a song that originally appeared on Calvert\u2019s 1974 solo debut, Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters. A fever dream of intergalactic travel, it calls back to \u201cSilver Machine\u201d with the line \u201cThe silver machine is worth more than you\u2019re worth.\u201d It also winks at one of Hawkwind\u2019s early inspirations, Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cSet the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\u201d with the gleefully sinister rejoinder \u201cSet the controls for the heart of the Earth.\u201d\nFor all of Hawkwind\u2019s heady cosmic mysticism\u2014their \u201cdecades-long interstellar mission to explore the occult mysteries of the cosmos,\u201d says Peter Bebergal in Season of the Witch: How the Occult Saved Rock and Roll\u2014they remain rooted in the SFF community. They\u2019ve played at SFF cons\u2014most notably Seacon \u201984 in Brighton, England, at which the band\u2019s beloved Roger Zelazny served as a guest of honor, and Worldcon 45 in 1987 at the same location. Said drummer Richard Chadwick in 1989, a year after he\u2019d joined the group, \u201cEvery gig we did was like a science fiction convention.\u201d Weathering numerous lineup changes, schisms, deaths, and even an internal lawsuit over ownership of the name, Hawkwind long ago solidified its position as one of the most reliable\u2014yet thankfully unpredictable\u2014practitioners of SFF music.\nThe band itself hasn\u2019t always seen it that way. Soon after the release of Astounding Sounds, Amazing Music in 1976, Turner told the New Musical Express, \u201cYou can\u2019t say there is a stereotype of what Hawkwind music should be, that it should be space rock or it should be all about science fiction or magic and sorcery.\u201d Only seven years into its existence, the group was already feeling the squeeze of being pigeonholed. Calvert even went so far as to say in a 1978 interview with the same magazine, \u201cI don\u2019t like SF that much. Nobody in this band is particularly an SF fanatic,\u201d adding, \u201cMost SF is trash, actually.\u201d\nBearing in mind Calvert\u2019s mental issues at the time\u2014later that year, his clinical depression resulted in the cancellation of a Hawkwind tour and his subsequent exit from the group\u2014he may have simply been bucking against the space-rock stereotype that he\u2019d wholeheartedly helped cultivate. Just one year earlier, he proudly told the fanzine Sniffin\u2019 Flowers that he considered Hawkwind to be \u201ca science fiction band [\u2026] in actual fact we are the only band that is doing that sort of thing\u201d\u2014an exaggerated claim, but the point stands; the same year he boasted in another fanzine, Album Tracking, \u201cWe even get letters from University people, in the States in particular, who have found parallels between science fiction and the literature of the past and who can fit Hawkwind into that scheme. I still think we\u2019re closely aligned with that.\u201d\nCalvert died in 1988 of a heart attack, just shy of Hawkwind\u2019s twentieth anniversary. This year the band turns forty-seven, and The Machine Stops is their thirtieth studio album, not counting scores of live albums, archival collections, EPs, singles, bootlegs, and releases by their many offshoot groups and solo projects\u2014almost all of them with a finger in SFF. And with The Machine Stops, Hawkwind shows no signs of letting that association lapse\u2014instead, they\u2019re doubling down on it, releasing one of the most extravagantly faithful SFF albums in their long, storied career. Or as Moorcock so speculatively put it in Sonic Assassins, Hawkwind is \u201clike the mad crew of a long-distance spaceship who had forgotten their mission, which had turned to art during the passage of time.\u201d\nJason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

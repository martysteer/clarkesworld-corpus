The glowing moss that dripped brown water filled the air with a faint glow, enough to let Melissa squint her way through the Caverns.\nThe Street gave her the mission the usual way: pictographs glowing on the side of the steps leading up to the two-storied, red-brick building the Found Children called The Castle. She had puzzled for a moment as to what the \u201ctrashcan + clamp\u201d had meant, but eventually she\u2019d figured that the Street lost a compactor and needed it retrieved.\nAnd of course, she knew the quartered circle that indicated the caverns.\nThe Found Children didn\u2019t like the Caverns. They were haunted. With so few real people around anymore, ghosts and demons felt free to roam a world filled with buildings that moved and talked, where mysterious magics dusted the air and flitted around.\nSo Melissa accepted the Street\u2019s request. She wouldn\u2019t let any of the younger children risk waking the demons.\nAfter all, La Llorona lurked this far under the Street. Melissa glimpsed her bedraggled hair and torn-up clothes the last time she\u2019d rescued a lost machine for the Street. Held her breath and hid as the demon ghost snuffled and tramped around the darks of the Caverns.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she whispered to herself. She stopped at the concrete edge of an ancient sewer and knelt to look into a puddle of muck collected in a depression. The telltale kinked track of the compactor looked fresh. The muck would dry out in six hours, maybe twelve on a humid day. He had been by here recently, then, headed deeper into the caverns. On tiptoes she headed deeper, swallowing hard and hoping she was being ghost-quiet.\nScuffling whispers echoed through the stale air from deeper in the caverns.\nMelissa froze.\nThe sounds carried the scent of earth and water. She looked around a corner carefully. Somewhere, deep along one of the arrow-straight tubes, a faint fire flickered.\n\u201cLa Llorona,\u201d Melissa whispered to herself, the back of her neck prickling.\nMelissa knew the stories from her days hiding in the Outskirts. Alien and incomprehensible the old demon stalked abandoned, wet sewers, snatching up wayward orphans, devouring those who had lost hope.\nIf La Llorona showed, she would tempt Melissa with her demonic tongue. Melissa shied away from the tunnel, keeping her hope, keeping her strength.\nShe looked down at the tracks. The trash compactor had been wooed by La Llorona\u2019s voice and tricked into coming down here, no doubt. And the Street needed it rescued. And the Street was good to the Found Children. It had given them a safe building, and good food.\nMelissa steeled herself and followed the tracks where they led, right down the tunnel toward La Llorona. The glow down that way was brighter, and the smell of smoke unmistakable.\n\u201cInfernal fire,\u201d she said softly. The smells of rotting things and burned flesh overwhelmed the purer smells of earth and water.\nSmoke should be sweeter, but no one told La Llorona that.\nHalfway down, the trash compactor shuddered in spastic circles, twitching a half turn to the left, then backing to the right one full turn. Back and forth he stuttered in little circles, and Melissa could tell the machine was caught between the call of La Llorona and the freedom and sweet air of the Street.\nRight now Melissa wanted nothing more than to call on the beautiful, angelic, and pure Blue Lady to come save her. The same Blue Lady that had appeared in the Outskirts, and given her food. Then told her and the Found Children about the Street, and the safe place.\nBut the Blue Lady didn\u2019t always come when you screamed and prayed. And it was better to save your prayers for when you really needed them. So Melissa gritted her teeth and approached the wayward machine.\nFortunately, the Old Man on the Street had shown her what to do in cases like this. When the trash compactor paused to reevaluate its path she leapt onto its chassis, her muddy feet scrambling up and over its metallic arms and mouths. On top was a button covered by a clear plastic guard. She flipped up the guard and mashed the button down, then whispered, \u201cI am lost, take me home.\u201d\nImmediately, the trash compactor stopped twitching, oriented itself back the way Melissa had come, and trundled off. She clung to it, her bony knees hooked into one of its bumpers, her fingers clutching the front edge, her slim body laid across the top. The little treads whirred and the compactor sped up with a flurry of dank water and mud as it carried them away from La Llorona, and then eventually with a burst of light, out of the Elemental Caverns entirely.\n\u201cYou did good work with the trash compactor,\u201d the Old Man said, walking beside her down the center of the asphalt strip, \u201cthat took a lot of courage. I know you don\u2019t like being underground.\u201d Melissa looked up at him. He wore a simple cream-colored suit with a pink tie. Sometimes he dressed differently\u2014when she met him he had been wearing sandals, khakis, and a patterned shirt\u2014but he otherwise always looked the same with his lined and careworn face and the shiny implants at his temples, forehead and base of his skull.\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d she said, walking beside him. Her head came just above his elbow, and she wore the same long skirt and t-shirt that she had worn that morning into the caverns. The t-shirt had a stylized rocketship on the front with three colorful monkeys hanging off it as it shot into space.\n\u201cWe appreciate it, nonetheless. Even if we lack courage ourselves anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re afraid?\u201d she asked. \u201cBut you\u2019re an adult.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not afraid, either. Not afraid, not courageous. It doesn\u2019t apply to us any more.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you . . . transcended?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, steering her toward the front steps of the safe building. The Castle. The other kids, all younger than her, had finished playing for the day and were heading back toward The Castle. Most of them were dirty, a few nicked up from playing rough, but they were otherwise healthy and in good spirits. They had a freedom now that they had lacked before, and they reveled in it.\nThe only cost to that freedom was the occasional task laid on them by the Street. Most of the cleaning things she let them handle, but as the oldest, she took the difficult things like the trash compactor onto herself. She couldn\u2019t let any of the younger ones risk themselves with La Llorona.\n\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d\n\u201cFeeling afraid?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr courageous?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. She imagined a smile further creasing his face, but it remained calm. \u201cWe still remember it, after all. We remember the fear and courage of all of us. And that\u2019s enough, in a way. Though it\u2019s nice to actively see yours. We take some pleasure in knowing these things are still around and still possible.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you like my art?\u201d\n\u201cWell, we like neo-primativist compositions. And your color choice is fairly unique for someone of your age and background.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. I think.\u201d She stopped at the base of the stairs, then turned to look up at him.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cFor this,\u201d she said, spreading her arms, indicating the Street as a whole. \u201cYou make it safe and clean and okay for us.\u201d\n\u201cYou make it clean, you and your friends.\u201d\nMelissa glanced up the stairs. Darkness was settling and the others had all gone inside. When she looked back, the Old Man was walking away, his hands in his pockets. Far beyond him, down at the east end of the Street, a ten-foot-tall block of walking metal, a checkpoint sentry, ambled forward awkwardly and then squatted to block that end off from unwanted guests. Another such sentry blocked the west end.\nAs she kept looking to the east, a bright light flared over the city. The silhouetted skyline was darker than it had been this time a year ago. A pillar of light grew, glowing blue and white, reaching for the heavens. Melissa wondered what it was.\nAn invocation for the Blue Lady lingered on Melissa\u2019s tongue long after the pillar of light faded and vanished, but never passed her lips.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s out there?\u201d Melissa asked the sentry the next day, craning her head as she looked up at the strips of steel along its side. \u201cNow, I mean. It\u2019s all changed. I don\u2019t understand it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cYou were out there before, weren\u2019t you?\u201d the sentry replied.\nParts of the steel block could change and move, revealing barriers, maybe weapons even, but she couldn\u2019t be sure of that. It was doing that now, to talk to her. The booming voice coming from a new porthole opening up. Small machine irises bloomed and twisted to point themselves at her.\nNothing got past the sentry without the Street\u2019s say-so. Except La Llorona.\nMelissa guessed that only the Blue Lady could stop the demon. But she hadn\u2019t seen the Blue Lady since she came to rescue the Found Children.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Melissa said. The sentry must know her story, she thought. But then, he hadn\u2019t appeared until just after most of the adults in the city transcended. Maybe the sentry wasn\u2019t like the rest of everything here on the Street, knowing what seemed like everything there was to know. \u201cMy mother and I lived on the streets for years, when I was little. She died four, maybe five years ago, I don\u2019t know any more.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you fare on the street?\u201d the sentry asked.\n\u201cWell enough,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe sang songs for people on the streets, back when they were filled with people. Sometimes people put money in the cup. Sometimes we went to the shelters, but mom was scared of them.\u201d\n\u201cYou still tell stories, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWhen the other children need them,\u201d Melissa replied. \u201cTo explain the world.\u201d\n\u201cHow often does that happen?\u201d\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d she said, flashing a smile at the sentry, and stepped across a steel ribbon in the road that marked the edge of the Street. Over to the other side. Nothing much happened, though she felt a tingle that told her the sentry had looked at her very closely. She turned her head and smiled again at the steel block and walked out into the north-south road. No vehicles used it any more, and outside of the Street, she could see weeds and grass had begun to sprout in the cracks.\nThis road itself seemed to be a no-man\u2019s land. \u201cHer\u201d street did not continue on the other side, there was just a blank wall, the side of what had been a large hospital that had declined rapidly in the last six months. There were hardly any patients any more. And those that needed help, she heard, got it from machines grown in their own homes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice out there,\u201d the Old Man said from behind her. She turned back. He leaned against the sentry, but she hadn\u2019t seen or heard him approach. He was wearing jeans and sneakers now, with a tie-dyed t-shirt. \u201cThe transcended are pitching in to help the people left behind in a big way. It\u2019s relatively safe for a girl on her own, even one as young as you. Safer than it was before you came to join us in The Castle.\u201d\n\u201cI like the Street,\u201d she said, turning to face him now. A shiver ran down her spine as she stood in the middle of the road, knowing in that instinctual way that she should not be able to do this, to stand where cars had once whipped by, and more to stand outside the protection of the Street. Spirits were out here, demons and all the rest, like La Llorona. She looked around again and took in the vacant buildings, the closed off streets, the emptiness of it all. Far away, to the south, she could see figures moving across the road, dim outlines in the distance.\n\u201cThe Street likes you,\u201d the Old Man said.\n\u201cAre you the King of the Street?\u201d Melissa asked. Or President. Or leader. She didn\u2019t understand the new world.\nShe\u2019d barely understood the old one. The busy streets, the cars, the busy and stressed people. Suits. Acrid air. Factories. Hunger. Steel buildings. Jobs and homes.\nPlanes. She wondered if she\u2019d dreamed them. Like metal birds, filled with people, going here and there, far over head. She missed the contrails.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Old Man said, \u201cthis is just a facet of the Street. This body was once an individual that lived here in one of the apartments. Now he is part of the Street, speaking to you with the voice of all of us. One of us.\u201d\nMelissa still didn\u2019t get it. She looked off in the distance, away from the Street and asked the same question she asked every week, just to reassure herself that she wasn\u2019t trapped. \u201cCan I leave the Street?\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to,\u201d the Old Man replied. \u201cYou\u2019re not our prisoner. Or even our ward. Though we would have . . . concern for you. We would prefer you to stay.\u201d\n\u201cConcern?\u201d\n\u201cAccidents still happen. The world is safer, but not completely safe.\u201d\nMelissa thought about La Llorona hidden away beneath the Street, hiding in the caverns down there. Was the Street completely safe either?\nShe wondered if the Blue Lady would help her if she left the Street? She thought so. She had seen her, after all, in the Outskirts.\nBut if Melissa left the Street, she would leave the Found Children alone. And who would warn them about La Llorona? The Street did not seem interested.\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d she said, and walked back through the sentry\u2019s gates. \u201cFor now.\u201d\n\u201c. . . La Llorona lost her children a long, long time ago. Some say she drowned them, and was cast back into the world after she killed herself. And that\u2019s why we must fear her. She\u2019s looking for lost children,\u201d Melissa said, looking around at the other children.\nOnly ten of the thirty in The Castle sat and listened to her tales on the benches by the sidewalk, mostly the youngest ones. They sat with their lunch\u2014provided, as always, by the Street\u2014and listened in fascination edged with disbelief. Last week she had twelve listeners. More the month before.\n\u201cI saw her in the Elemental Caverns,\u201d Melissa said, stomping a thinly shod foot on the concrete sidewalk. \u201cRight here. Right beneath our feet. She will take you and bind you and make you hers forever.\u201d\nThat sent a shiver through them. \u201cStranger danger,\u201d muttered one of the kids, repeating one of the old warding phrases they\u2019d all learned and passed on to each other. Even though they stayed within the long block that made up the Street, the freedom within it was nearly unfathomable. To be able to run and play, beyond the tightly fenced playground behind their building . . . this was a freedom they had never known in their lives. Food. Warmth.\nMelissa thought back to the lessons she had been taught. The stories she\u2019d been told about the world. \u201cThere is evil and there is good, in the world,\u201d she repeated. \u201cDemons, like La Llorona, want to capture us and steal our energy. But there are angels out there. And they want us to be free, and to laugh and play. It makes them happy to see that.\u201d\nHer mom had made angels out of bits of wire and bottles that she found. Twisted metal wings wrapped onto the bottles, with bottle-cap faces. When they\u2019d stayed in the tent on the Outskirts, her mother had made hundreds of them. \u201cThey protect us,\u201d her mother had said. \u201cFrom the government. They hide us from the bad people who\u2019ll take you away from me.\u201d\nBut then she\u2019d died. Killed by the demon that ripped her up from the inside and made her cough blood. And Melissa had been left alone to sing on the street, to beg for food.\nAlone while people started to fade away, and the city got silent.\nAlone until the beautiful Blue Lady came out to the Outskirts and talked to her. Invited her to come to the Street.\nA little boy with braided hair raised his hand and broke through Melissa\u2019s memories. \u201cIs the Street an angel?\u201d\nMelissa opened her mouth. And didn\u2019t have an answer.\nThe others scattered as they realized she was done, their lunches finished, their attention waning. She didn\u2019t blame them, but she hoped they would take what she said to heart. Many of them didn\u2019t believe in La Llorona the way she did, they hadn\u2019t smelled her fire, heard her strange and demonic language. Some of them had been reading things, learning history from the Street.\nEven some of the other children who\u2019d hunkered in the Outskirts, near that abandoned factory that Melissa had hid in after her mom died, had stopped believing.\nThe Old Man was standing there, watching her. Today he had gone back to the cream-colored suit, but with a peach-colored tie.\n\u201cWe really enjoy your stories,\u201d he said to her, \u201cthe way you teach the children what you know about the world.\u201d\n\u201cThey need to know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd no one else wants to do it, I think. Is that why you want me to stay?\u201d\n\u201cWe want you to stay for many reasons,\u201d he said, \u201cbut your stories are a part of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean? You must know far more than I do,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou transcended.\u201d\nThat was why everyone left. She hadn\u2019t understood, not talking to other people. Hiding in the parks. Begging.\nDid you ever use your mother\u2019s old phone? the Blue Lady had asked. Or play with a computer? They get faster and faster. And better. And some people use mind interfaces. Or speak to them.\nTechnology got faster. Better. And then technology started designing technology. Evolving. What used to take a lifetime took a decade, then years. And then last year, months. Weeks. Days.\nPeople transcended. Became other things. Many other things. Some were still here. Some had left. Some were different.\nSome stayed the same.\nThe Found Children had been left behind.\n\u201cTranscending was the problem,\u201d the Old Man said. \u201cIn some ways, we\u2019re only the sum of our parts. The collective that is the Street is made up of only so many individuals, with so much life experience, with so much knowledge, or emotion, or wisdom. If we do not take care to find more, to cultivate more, we could easily stagnate and die. Believe it or not, it has happened to collectives already, others elsewhere have encountered this. It took one such collective in Switzerland just a week, in your time.\u201d\n\u201cIn my time? Isn\u2019t my time the same as yours?\u201d Melissa asked, walking along the sidewalk, watching the other children run and play. Some of them were playing tag, others had a more complicated game of make-believe going on. A couple of the others had started a painting project early, only they did not seem to be doing quite the nice, even job the Street had suggested. The Old Man took that in as well, but smiled with approval.\n\u201cMachine intelligence has multiplied us, in a way. Everything happens faster, your experiences seem exponentially slower. We can make very complex decisions in the blink of your eye.\u201d\n\u201cThat changed you,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to change,\u201d she replied, not sure where the defensiveness had come from, suddenly. She didn\u2019t want to become a robot body for some larger entity like the Street. Even if the Street was made of all the minds of people who had lived in these buildings a year ago. \u201cI want to be me, forever.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d the Old Man said, and that was all on that subject.\nThe next night, a tribe of adults entered through the western checkpoint and set up camp on the opposite side of the Street from The Castle. They rolled up in a small caravan of vehicles, including one large truck with tarp-covered objects on the back. Much to her excitement the people seemed mostly normal to Melissa, though they greeted her with a deference that surprised her. The other kids stayed away, mostly, only peering-through-the-windows curious right now. They had had so few visitors through the Street in the months since the transcendence, since the neighborhood became the Street.\n\u201cThey\u2019re heading to the spaceport,\u201d the Old Man had explained to her. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them freeway and a camping spot in exchange for some things they will make for us in space, in zero gravity.\u201d\nMelissa looked up as she crossed the Street, at the stars overhead, thinking about his words. What kind of people would want to go there? She was meet-them curious, so she approached a small group gathered around a grill. There were only a few others that she had seen, beside these three, and they were busy with tasks she could not see.\nOnce they had finished the greetings, and Melissa explained who and what she was\u2014careful to emphasize that they were in the Street\u2019s safekeeping\u2014she asked what they were doing, where they were going.\n\u201cTo space,\u201d one of them replied, light in his eyes. His curiosity and passion lit a small fire in her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be adapted to life in zero-gee, and we\u2019re going to explore the solar system. Maybe beyond, if we can figure it out. The transcended are making huge strides toward that, now.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not transcended?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo, but we\u2019re going to be modified, enhanced,\u201d said one of the women, a similar light in her eyes. \u201cIn those,\u201d she said and jerked a thumb toward the tarp-covered objects. \u201cSome of our friends are already undergoing the changes.\u201d\n\u201cChanged? Enhanced?\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to see?\u201d said another of the women. And without waiting for Melissa\u2019s response, she climbed up on the back of the truck and started undoing one of the tarps. She lifted the edge, and Melissa could then see underneath. Machinery, wrapped around a green glowing tank, beeped and blinked at her. Inside, she could dimly make out a human form, only it wasn\u2019t quite so human any more. The body was changing, slowly, very slowly. Elongating here and there, widening in the limbs, flattening. New lumps on the body showed implanted machinery, perhaps, or new organs grown to perform whole new tasks the human body could never have evolved to perform.\n\u201cAre you still you?\u201d she asked the woman holding the tarp.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cLinked, by technology in our heads, some of the same technology that allows people to transcend. But we use it differently.\u201d\nThat night, Melissa stood on the rooftop of The Castle, looking up at the sky. Lights moved across the stars now, something she had never noticed before. Were they angels, going about a heavenly mission? Or more like these people, exploring the worlds beyond hers? Perhaps both, now that she thought about it.\nBut as she watched, shrill cries broke the night. She looked down at the visiting tribe, but they were all asleep, and undisturbed.\nThe cries went on for a full minute, and then trailed away. Melissa hurried inside. They had come from somewhere on the Street. They had to have been caused, she knew, by La Llorona.\nOnly La Llorona could sound that sad and scared.\nThe next day, the tribe readied to depart. Some of the orphans ran around, their hesitancy overcome, and they were now doing tasks for the visitors, little things that earned them treats or simple pats on the head. Melissa walked back and forth along the Street, almost like a nervous hen, keeping an eye on her chicks. Surely, La Llorona slipped up onto the surface with the tribe?\nNo, the Street would have noticed, she felt. It would not have allowed that. No, besides, La Llorona came from the depths, from the caverns, coming up from under the Street.\nOnce the tribe had moved on, she was joined by the Old Man again, walking the length of the Street. He asked her what she had thought of the visitors, if she wanted to go with them, what she had been working on artistically.\nBut she could also sense that he wasn\u2019t quite as engaged with the questions as he usually was. Something was missing in his attitude, and as they neared the western end of the Street, he guided her down an alley. It ended, a hundred feet down, in a blank wall erected since the transcendence, physically blocking the Street off and helping make it more of an enclave.\nBetween the street and the wall lay a boy\u2019s body, bloody and tattered, surrounded by sparkling shards of glass. She looked up at once, instinctively, but there were no windows on the buildings that formed the alley. She looked back down and whispered, \u201cLa Llorona. I heard the screams last night. I\u2019ve warned you. Why don\u2019t you listen to me?\u201d\nShe wiped tears from her cheeks.\n\u201cYou think she did this?\u201d the Old Man asked, walking close to look at the boy. He was not one of the Found Children. He was an outsider, from a nearby neighborhood. She had seen him before, a little younger than her, but at the time imperious, walking like he owned the world and smiling at the Found Children, but not talking to them. Now he was dead, the life gone from his body.\nShe looked up and met the Old Man\u2019s eyes, looking into them for what she thought must truly be the first time. She found herself falling into them, as though under a spell, seeing in him time and space, the stars of eternity, the soul of hundreds, maybe thousands. How many were dead now, like this boy?\n\u201cHe was one of us, you know,\u201d the Street whispered, in the body of this Old Man. \u201cHe is one of us. But a piece of us was in there when this happened. And now it\u2019s gone.\u201d\nMelissa turned and ran from him then, running back to The Castle, running to the hidden room she had once used, high in The Castle, and shut herself in. She held her knees to her chest and rocked back and forth, crying softly lest anyone hear her. She had not needed this room, this tiny closet of freedom since she arrived here, holding the Blue Lady\u2019s hand. Scared of the new children. Scared of the Old Man.\nThe close walls, the musty smell, the semi-darkness enclosed her, comforted her. Here she was trapped, and yet free, free from everything out there that wanted to consume her, from La Llorona and the Street, the Old Man and the other children. The dead child.\nDeath. The Street didn\u2019t seem to fear it, at least not the way she did. The violent, brutal murder of that child, the child who had no doubt been the source of the cries the night before.\nMelissa cried herself to sleep.\nThe blue glow woke her, late in the night. It appeared first around the edges of the secret door that led into her private space, and then the door opened. Melissa tried to block the glare with her hand, but then it subsided on its own, revealing a beautiful woman, dressed in blue, radiating blue light from her skin. She had a soft and sympathetic smile, and reached a hand out toward Melissa.\nMelissa smiled widely, her own hand meeting the Blue Lady\u2019s, feeling her fingers touch that warmth. She held on, and the Lady guided her out of her hiding place. Melissa climbed down and stood before her looking up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cHello, Melissa.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d Melissa asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t call you.\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you saw Rafael in the alley, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d\nShe nodded, but couldn\u2019t actually remember. Her mind had been a whirl then.\n\u201cI must have,\u201d Melissa whispered.\n\u201cDo you really think it was La Llorona?\u201d\nMelissa nodded, though she had actually become less sure since leaving the boy\u2019s body. His death didn\u2019t mesh with anything she knew about La Llorona, and doubt had begun to creep into her mind that she wasn\u2019t real at all. The Blue Lady\u2019s presence threw those thoughts into disarray once more.\n\u201cDo you know where we can find her? You said you saw her under the Street, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Melissa said, then shook her head. \u201cNo. No. But, I do know . . . I did come near the lair of a demon once, a few days ago.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew it was a demon?\u201d\n\u201cWho else could live like that?\u201d she asked, shuddering. Deep in the sewers, the burning reek of its lair infesting the Elemental Caverns and fouling the sweet smell of smoke.\n\u201cCan you show me?\u201d\n\u201cI . . .\u201d\n\u201cIt will be safe,\u201d the Blue Lady said, \u201cyou called on me to protect you, and I will. But I need to see this place. I need you to lead me there.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Melissa said, and took the Blue Lady\u2019s hand again.\nTogether they walked out of The Castle into the cool night. The other children were all asleep, or hiding themselves, and she knew it was better if they did not see her with the Blue Lady. They would be scared, even if they believed Melissa\u2019s stories, they would know this meant danger lurked nearby. And she did not want them to be afraid, any more, ever. She wanted them to be free of that, too. Fear was horrible, awful, and if the Street no longer feared death, maybe that was for the better.\nMelissa led the Blue Lady to the entrance she used for the Elemental Caverns, a grate that had been stacked with boxes to keep it from being pushed up from underneath. Together, they pushed the boxes to the side and slowly crawled down the ladder inside to the concrete path inside. Melissa went first, swallowing her fear, and looked around carefully after beckoning the Blue Lady down.\nMelissa began creeping toward the place she had last seen the glow of the demon\u2019s fire, but the Blue Lady walked without fear, her stride long, her feet loud on the concrete. Melissa tried to hurry quietly, but gave it up, drawing strength from the Blue Lady\u2019s fearlessness.\nBefore they reached it, she could smell the sickly smoke, see the glow reflecting on the walls. Within another minute, she was at the place she had found the trash compactor, the dried muck there still churned from where it had been turning its erratic circles.\nAnother few steps and she saw the shadows moving on the far wall, occluding the glow of the fire. Melissa froze in place as the demon stepped around the corner, ragged looking, long, straggly hair hanging from his head.\nHis head?\nMelissa\u2019s thoughts swirled with confusion. The face she saw was certainly a man\u2019s. This was not La Llorona. Or was it? Was La Llorona tricking them?\nShe didn\u2019t have time to think further, as the demon breathed words in the demon language, and Melissa felt her knees shake with fear. He carried something in his right hand, long like a gun, but strangely shiny.\nMelissa wanted to back away but could not, her body would not respond to her. But then the Blue Lady, who she\u2019d almost forgot about, stepped around her. The demon started to raise the thing in his right hand, screaming something in his language at the Blue Lady. Her hands moved in a flicker and filaments shot from her fingers, glittering in the firelight. They whipped across the intervening distance and in a blink the demon was pinned against the wall.\nHis gun fired, the sound unmistakable in the confined space, but the filaments had pinned it to the wall as well, and it discharged harmlessly at the floor. The Blue Lady strode forward, her calm undisturbed. She had been right, Melissa was safe with her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can come closer,\u201d the Blue Lady said, beckoning Melissa to her side. She followed, coming closer to the demon, and seeing that he was not, in fact, a demon, but just an angry bad smelling man with long hair. He spat words at the Blue Lady and jerked the trigger again on his gun, but it would not fire now.\nA thousand little shards of glass were embedded in the concrete around his feet. Melissa crouched down to look closer at them.\n\u201cThat is what killed the boy,\u201d the Blue Lady said, reassuring her. \u201cNot La Llorona, or anything else. Just this awful man\u2019s awful weapon.\u201d\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cA man, just a man from across the ocean.\u201d\n\u201cFrom where?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d the Blue Lady asked, and Melissa had no answer.\n\u201cYou were right, when you thought of him as La Llorona,\u201d she said. \u201cNot everyone transcended, or chose to. He\u2019s an individual. He is the last remnant of a meme that has worked its way through all of human history, that believes a race or a nation are exceptional and destined to great things in history. He\u2019s a nationalist. Transcendence ignores such boundaries, but he wants them back and is willing to hurt people in the name of this desire.\u201d\nMelissa nodded, understanding and yet not understanding at all. Her mind was unraveling, and then remaking connections.\n\u201cYou are the Street, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Melissa asked. \u201cAnother aspect of it.\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d she said, turning now to look down at Melissa. \u201cAbandoned children talk about the legend of the Blue Lady. We felt you would trust us, let us take care of you, if I found you.\u201d\nBut Melissa didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t say anything else, just walked away.\nMelissa stopped telling her stories.\nThere seemed little point any more. La Llorona was not real. There were no demons, only sad and pathetic men living in a sewer, killing children because of an idea.\nThe children were safe, as safe as could be on the Street. No matter what Melissa warned them about.\nThe Street now understood how the man had snuck in. It knew about the \u201cglass flechettes\u201d and could prepare for them. The orphans were not in danger, and there wasn\u2019t much her stories could do. The world was strange. Stranger than the one she\u2019d been born into. The children seemed to adapt to that easier than her.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you telling your stories any more?\u201d the Street asked her. The Old Man was back, dressed in flowery shorts and a white t-shirt with sunglasses and a straw hat. The hat mostly covered the metallic growths on his head.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe them any more, not after what I saw, what I know. I question everything.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d the Old Man said, his eyes sad. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss your stories, though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss them too,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cDo you want to join us?\u201d\n\u201cBecome like you, or the Blue Lady, or the boy in the alley?\u201d she asked, looking up at him.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI . . . want to be more like them, the tribe that passed through. But I want to remain myself. It seems like dying, becoming part of the Street.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d the Old Man said. \u201cI can even introduce you to the boy whose body you saw. He is alive and happy within us.\u201d\n\u201cBut he isn\u2019t himself, alone. He can\u2019t ever be free and alone, like I was when the Blue Lady came to me. I can\u2019t be me.\u201d\n\u201cAre you still yourself when you work with the other kids to clean the street, moving as one unit to accomplish a task?\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course. But I haven\u2019t changed, I am still myself,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut who are you, yourself?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you the same person here, right now, that you were before you learned the truth about La Llorona, or the Blue Lady? You have changed, even in that. Transcending would hardly be different. You are nothing more than colonies of bacteria and cells, all working together to a greater whole. We are not that much different.\u201d\nShe had nothing to say to that, for now, only looked off toward the east. The tribe had left days ago, and must be to the spaceport by now. She thought about trying to catch them, but it seemed like a long way to go on her own, even in a world mostly safer than the one she had grown up in.\n\u201cThe children would be safe?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cWe are very invested in them,\u201d the Old Man replied.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cLike we said to you before, we need new input, to stagnate for us would be like death.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re afraid of it?\u201d\n\u201cAs much as we are of anything,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cYou want the children to join with you?\u201d\n\u201cIf they choose to,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019ll enjoy their play and their art and their curiosity. Maybe they will go out into the world and return to us with their experiences. Maybe they will join us and add their individual creativity and spark to our collective.\u201d\nShe looked off to the east again and sighed.\n\u201cYou are a strange guardian, Street. But better than none, I guess. Thank you for the offer, but I think I would like to leave. Is there another tribe passing through soon?\u201d\n\u201cIn a week, your time,\u201d he said, \u201cor you can catch up with the last one. It\u2019s not that far.\u201d\n\u201cYou would let me go?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. We told you, you are not our prisoner.\u201d\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll need to pack some food.\u201d\n\u201cNo need. I\u2019ll make arrangements. Just ask and we will make sure you have what you need delivered. I will order the sentry to make a bike for you.\u201d\nMelissa swallowed. This was it. This was really happening. They walked silently along the Street. At the end, once more, Melissa stepped over the boundary to the other side.\nThe sentry thundered from its niche between two houses, blocking out the sun as it approached. From inside something gurgled and belched, a puff of smoke leaked out, and then a bike slid out from a compartment in a gush of green liquid that turned into smoke and wafted away.\nMelissa took the handles.\n\u201cThe offer will stand, to join us, if you come back,\u201d the Street said.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said.\n\u201cGood bye, Melissa,\u201d said the sentry as it settled back toward its niche.\n\u201cGood bye, Street,\u201d she said, and turned back toward the world without a Blue Lady, or La Llorona, or Santa Claus.\nBut maybe, she thought, full of other wonders.\nCalled \"Violent, poetic and compulsively readable\" by Maclean's, science fiction author Tobias S.

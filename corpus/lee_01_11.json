Square becomes kite becomes swan; history becomes rumor becomes song. Even the act of remembrance creases the truth.\nWhat the paper-folding diagrams fail to mention is that each fold enacts itself upon the secret marrow of your ethics, the axioms of your thoughts.\nWhether this is the most important thing the diagrams fail to mention is a matter of opinion.\n\u201cThere\u2019s time for one more hand,\u201d Lisse\u2019s ghost said. It was composed of cinders of color, a cipher of blurred features, and it had a voice like entropy and smoke and sudden death. Quite possibly it was the last ghost on all of ruined Rhaion, conquered Rhaion, Rhaion with its devastated, shadowless cities and dead moons and dimming sun. Sometimes Lisse wondered if the ghost had a scar to match her own, a long, livid line down her arm. But she felt it was impolite to ask.\nAround them, in a command spindle sized for fifty, the walls of the war-kite were hung with tatters of black and faded green, even now in the process of reknitting themselves into tapestry displays. Tangled reeds changed into ravens. One perched on a lightning-cloven tree. Another, taking shape amid twisted threads, peered out from a skull\u2019s eye socket.\nLisse didn\u2019t need any deep familiarity with mercenary symbology to understand the warning. Lisse\u2019s people had adopted a saying from the Imperium\u2019s mercenaries: In raven arithmetic, no death is enough.\nLisse had expected pursuit. She had deserted from Base 87 soon after hearing that scouts had found a mercenary war-kite in the ruins of a sacred maze, six years after all the mercenaries vanished: suspicious timing on her part, but she would have no better opportunity for revenge. The ghost had not tried too hard to dissuade her. It had always understood her ambitions.\nFor a hundred years, despite being frequently outnumbered, the mercenaries in their starfaring kites had cindered cities, destroyed flights of rebel starflyers, shattered stations in the void\u2019s hungry depths. What better weapon than one of their own kites?\nWhat troubled her was how lightly the war-kite had been defended. It had made a strange, thorny silhouette against the lavender sky even from a long way off, like briars gone wild, and with the ghost as scout she had slipped past the few mechanized sentries. The kite\u2019s shadow had been human. She was not sure what to make of that.\nThe kite had opened to her like a flower. The card game had been the ghost\u2019s idea, a way to reassure the kite that she was its ally: Scorch had been invented by the mercenaries.\nLisse leaned forward and started to scoop the nearest column, the Candle Column, from the black-and-green gameplay rug. The ghost forestalled her with a hand that felt like the dregs of autumn, decay from the inside out. In spite of herself, she flinched from the ghostweight, which had troubled her all her life. Her hand jerked sideways; her fingers spasmed.\n\u201cLook,\u201d the ghost said.\nFew cadets had played Scorch with Lisse even in the barracks. The ghost left its combinatorial fingerprints in the cards. People drew the unlucky Fallen General\u2019s Hand over and over again, or doubled on nothing but negative values, or inverted the Crown Flower at odds of thousands to one. So Lisse had learned to play the solitaire variant, with jerengjen as counters. You must learn your enemy\u2019s weapons, the ghost had told her, and so, even as a child in the reeducation facility, she had saved her chits for paper to practice folding into cranes, lilies, leaf-shaped boats.\nNext to the Candle Column she had folded stormbird, greatfrog, lantern, drake. Where the ghost had interrupted her attempt to clear the pieces, they had landed amid the Sojourner and Mirror Columns, forming a skewed late-game configuration: a minor variant of the Needle Stratagem, missing only its pivot.\n\u201cConsider it an omen,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cEven the smallest sliver can kill, as they say.\u201d\nThere were six ravens on the tapestries now. The latest one had outspread wings, as though it planned to blot out the shrouded sun. She wondered what it said about the mercenaries, that they couched their warnings in pictures rather than drums or gongs.\nLisse rose from her couch. \u201cSo they\u2019re coming for us. Where are they?\u201d\nShe had spoken in the Imperium\u2019s administrative tongue, not one of the mercenaries\u2019 own languages. Nevertheless, a raven flew from one tapestry to join its fellows in the next. The vacant tapestry grayed, then displayed a new scene: a squad of six tanks caparisoned in Imperial blue and bronze, paced by two personnel carriers sheathed in metal mined from withered stars. They advanced upslope, pebbles skittering in their wake.\nIn the old days, the ghost had told her, no one would have advanced through a sacred maze by straight lines. But the ancient walls, curved and interlocking, were gone now. The ghost had drawn the old designs on her palm with its insubstantial fingers, and she had learned not to shudder at the untouch, had learned to thread the maze in her mind\u2019s eye: one more map to the things she must not forget.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather avoid fighting them,\u201d Lisse said. She was looking at the command spindle\u2019s controls. Standard Imperial layout, all of them\u2014it did not occur to her to wonder why the kite had configured itself thus\u2014but she found nothing for the weapons.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t bring tanks when they want to negotiate,\u201d the ghost said dryly. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll have alerted their flyers for intercept. You have something they want badly.\u201d\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t they guard it better?\u201d she demanded.\nDespite the tanks\u2019 approach, the ghost fell silent. After a while, it said, \u201cPerhaps they didn\u2019t think anyone but a mercenary could fly a kite.\u201d\n\u201cThey might be right,\u201d Lisse said darkly. She strapped herself into the commander\u2019s seat, then pressed three fingers against the controls and traced the commands she had been taught as a cadet. The kite shuddered, as though caught in a hell-wind from the sky\u2019s fissures. But it did not unfurl itself to fly.\nShe tried the command gestures again, forcing herself to slow down. A cold keening vibrated through the walls. The kite remained stubbornly landfast.\nThe squad rounded the bend in the road. All the ravens had gathered in a single tapestry, decorating a half-leafed tree like dire jewels. The rest of the tapestries displayed the squad from different angles: two aerial views and four from the ground.\nLisse studied one of the aerial views and caught sight of two scuttling figures, lean angles and glittering eyes and a balancing tail in black metal. She stiffened. They had the shadows of hounds, all graceful hunting curves. Two jerengjen, true ones, unlike the lifeless shapes that she folded out of paper. The kite must have deployed them when it sensed the tanks\u2019 approach.\nSweating now, despite the autumn temperature inside, she methodically tried every command she had ever learned. The kite remained obdurate. The tapestries\u2019 green threads faded until the ravens and their tree were bleak black splashes against a background of wintry gray.\nIt was a message. Perhaps a demand. But she did not understand.\nThe first two tanks slowed into view. Roses, blue with bronze hearts, were engraved to either side of the main guns. The lead tank\u2019s roses flared briefly.\nThe kite whispered to itself in a language that Lisse did not recognize. Then the largest tapestry cleared of trees and swirling leaves and rubble, and presented her with a commander\u2019s emblem, a pale blue rose pierced by three claws. A man\u2019s voice issued from the tapestry: \u201cCadet Fai Guen.\u201d This was her registry name. They had not reckoned that she would keep her true name alive in her heart like an ember. \u201cYou are in violation of Imperial interdict. Surrender the kite at once.\u201d\nHe did not offer mercy. The Imperium never did.\nLisse resisted the urge to pound her fists against the interface. She had not survived this long by being impatient. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then,\u201d she said to the ghost in defeat.\n\u201cCadet Fai Guen,\u201d the voice said again, after another burst of light, \u201cyou have one minute to surrender the kite before we open fire.\u201d\n\u201cLisse,\u201d the ghost said, \u201cthe kite\u2019s awake.\u201d\nShe bit back a retort and looked down. Where the control panel had once been featureless gray, it was now crisp white interrupted by five glyphs, perfectly spaced for her outspread fingers. She resisted the urge to snatch her hand away. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t fly, at least we can fight.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t know the kite\u2019s specific control codes. Triggering the wrong sequence might activate the kite\u2019s internal defenses. But taking tank fire at point-blank range would get her killed, too. She couldn\u2019t imagine that the kite\u2019s armor had improved in the years of its neglect.\nOn the other hand, it had jerengjen scouts, and the jerengjen looked perfectly functional.\nShe pressed her thumb to the first glyph. A shadow unfurled briefly but was gone before she could identify it. The second attempt revealed a two-headed dragon\u2019s twisting coils. Long-range missiles, then: thunder in the sky. Working quickly, she ran through the options. It would be ironic if she got the weapons systems to work only to incinerate herself.\n\u201cYou have ten seconds, Cadet Fai Guen,\u201d said the voice with no particular emotion.\n\u201cLisse,\u201d the ghost said, betraying impatience.\nOne of the glyphs had shown a wolf running. She remembered that at one point the wolf had been the mercenaries\u2019 emblem. Nevertheless, she felt a dangerous affinity to it. As she hesitated over it, the kite said, in a parched voice, \u201cSoul strike.\u201d\nShe tapped the glyph, then pressed her palm flat to activate the weapon. The panel felt briefly hot, then cold.\nFor a second she thought that nothing had happened, that the kite had malfunctioned. The kite was eerily still.\nThe tanks and personnel carriers were still visible as gray outlines against darker gray, as were the nearby trees and their stifled fruits. She wasn\u2019t sure whether that was an effect of the unnamed weapons or a problem with the tapestries. Had ten seconds passed yet? She couldn\u2019t tell, and the clock of her pulse was unreliable.\nDesperate to escape before the tanks spat forth the killing rounds, Lisse raked her hand sideways to dismiss the glyphs. They dispersed in unsettling fragmented shapes resembling half-chewed leaves and corroded handprints. She repeated the gesture for fly.\nLisse choked back a cry as the kite lofted. The tapestry views changed to sky on all sides except the ravens on their tree\u2014birds no longer, but skeletons, price paid in coin of bone.\nOnly once they had gained some altitude did she instruct the kite to show her what had befallen her hunters. It responded by continuing to accelerate.\nThe problem was not the tapestries. Rather, the kite\u2019s wolf-strike had ripped all the shadows free of their owners, killing them. Below, across a great swathe of the continent once called Ishuel\u2019s Bridge, was a devastation of light, a hard, glittering splash against the surrounding snow-capped mountains and forests and winding rivers.\nLisse had been an excellent student, not out of academic conscientiousness but because it gave her an opportunity to study her enemy. One of her best subjects had been geography. She and the ghost had spent hours drawing maps in the air or shaping topographies in her blankets; paper would betray them, it had said. As she memorized the streets of the City of Fountains, it had sung her the ballads of its founding. It had told her about the feuding poets and philosophers that the thoroughfares of the City of Prisms had been named after. She knew which mines supplied which bases and how the roads spidered across Ishuel\u2019s Bridge. While the population figures of the bases and settlement camps weren\u2019t exactly announced to cadets, especially those recruited from the reeducation facilities, it didn\u2019t take much to make an educated guess.\nThe Imperium had built 114 bases on Ishuel\u2019s Bridge. Base complements averaged 20,000 people. Even allowing for the imprecision of her eye, the wolf-strike had taken out\u2014\nShe shivered as she listed the affected bases, approximately sixty of them.\nThe settlement camps\u2019 populations were more difficult. The Imperium did not like to release those figures. Imperfectly, she based her estimate on the zone around Base 87, remembering the rows of identical shelters. The only reason they did not outnumber the bases\u2019 personnel was that the mercenaries had been coldly efficient on Jerengjen Day.\nNeedle Stratagem, Lisse thought blankly. The smallest sliver. She hadn\u2019t expected its manifestation to be quite so literal.\nThe ghost was looking at her, its dark eyes unusually distinct. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done for it now,\u201d it said at last. \u201cTell the kite where to go before it decides for itself.\u201d\n\u201cAshway 514,\u201d Lisse said, as they had decided before she fled base: scenario after scenario whispered to each other like bedtime stories. She was shaking. The straps did nothing to steady her.\nShe had one last glimpse of the dead region before they curved into the void: her handprint upon her own birthworld. She had only meant to destroy her hunters.\nIn her dreams, later, the blast pattern took on the outline of a running wolf.\nIn the mercenaries\u2019 dominant language, jerengjen originally referred to the art of folding paper. For her part, when Lisse first saw it, she thought of it as snow. She was four years old. It was a fair spring afternoon in the City of Tapestries, slightly humid. She was watching a bird try to catch a bright butterfly when improbable paper shapes began drifting from the sky, foxes and snakes and stormbirds.\nLisse called to her parents, laughing. Her parents knew better. Over her shrieks, they dragged her into the basement and switched off the lights. She tried to bite one of her fathers when he clamped his hand over her mouth. Jerengjen tracked primarily by shadows, not by sound, but you couldn\u2019t be too careful where the mercenaries\u2019 weapons were concerned.\nIn the streets, jerengjen unfolded prettily, expanding into artillery with dragon-shaped shadows and sleek four-legged assault robots with wolf-shaped shadows. In the skies, jerengjen unfolded into bombers with kestrel-shaped shadows.\nThis was not the only Rhaioni city where this happened. People crumpled like paper cutouts once their shadows were cut away by the onslaught. Approximately one-third of the world\u2019s population perished in the weeks that followed.\nOf the casualty figures, the Imperium said, It is regrettable. And later, The stalled negotiations made the consolidation necessary.\nLisse carried a map of the voidways with her at all times, half in her head and half in the Scorch deck. The ghost had once been a traveler. It had shown her mnemonics for the dark passages and the deep perils that lay between stars. Growing up, she had laid out endless tableaux between her lessons, memorizing travel times and vortices and twists.\nAshway 514 lay in the interstices between two unstable stars and their cacophonous necklace of planets, comets, and asteroids. Lisse felt the kite tilting this way and that as it balanced itself against the stormy voidcurrent. The tapestries shone from one side with ruddy light from the nearer star, 514 Tsi. On the other side, a pale violet-blue planet with a serenade of rings occluded the view.\n514 was a useful hiding place. It was off the major tradeways, and since the Battle of Fallen Sun\u2014named after the rebel general\u2019s emblem, a white sun outlined in red, rather than the nearby stars\u2014it had been designated an ashway, where permanent habitation was forbidden.\nMore important to Lisse, however, was the fact that 514 was the ashway nearest the last mercenary sighting, some five years ago. As a student, she had learned the names and silhouettes of the most prominent war-kites, and set verses of praise in their honor to Imperial anthems. She had written essays on their tactics and memorized the names of their most famous commanders, although there were no statues or portraits, only the occasional unsmiling photograph. The Imperium was fond of statues and portraits.\nFor a hundred years (administrative calendar), the mercenaries had served their masters unflinchingly and unfailingly. Lisse had assumed that she would have as much time as she needed to plot against them. Instead, they had broken their service, for reasons the Imperium had never released\u2014perhaps they didn\u2019t know, either\u2014and none had been seen since.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything to find here,\u201d Lisse said. Surely the Imperium would have scoured the region for clues. The tapestries were empty of ravens. Instead, they diagrammed shifting voidcurrent flows. The approach of enemy starflyers would perturb the current and allow Lisse and the ghost to estimate their intent. Not trusting the kite\u2019s systems\u2014although there was only so far that she could take her distrust, given the circumstances\u2014she had been watching the tapestries for the past several hours. She had, after a brief argument with the ghost, switched on haptics so that the air currents would, however imperfectly, reflect the status of the void around them. Sometimes it was easier to feel a problem through your skin.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication of derelict kites here,\u201d she added. \u201cOr even kites in use, other than this one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a starting place, that\u2019s all,\u201d the ghost said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to risk a station eventually. You might not need to eat, but I do.\u201d She had only been able to sneak a few rations out of base. It was tempting to nibble at one now.\n\u201cPerhaps there are stores on the kite.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think this place is a trap.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to eat sooner or later,\u201d the ghost said reasonably. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a look, and I don\u2019t want to see you go hungry.\u201d At her hesitation, it added, \u201cI\u2019ll stand watch here. I\u2019m only a breath away.\u201d\nThis didn\u2019t reassure her as much as it should have, but she was no longer a child in a bunk precisely aligned with the walls, clutching the covers while the ghost told her her people\u2019s stories. She reminded herself of her favorite story, in which a single sentinel kept away the world\u2019s last morning by burning out her eyes, and set out.\nLisse felt the ghostweight\u2019s pull the farther away she walked, but that was old pain, and easily endured. Lights flicked on to accompany her, diffuse despite her unnaturally sharp shadow, then started illuminating passages ahead of her, guiding her footsteps. She wondered what the kite didn\u2019t want her to see.\nRations were in an unmarked storage room. She wouldn\u2019t have been certain about the rations, except that they were, if the packaging was to be believed, field category 72: better than what she had eaten on training exercises, but not by much. No surprise, now that she thought about it: from all accounts, the mercenaries had relied on their masters\u2019 production capacity.\nFeeling ridiculous, she grabbed two rations and retraced her steps. The fact that the kite lit her exact path only made her more nervous.\n\u201cAnything new?\u201d she asked the ghost. She tapped the ration. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that you can\u2019t taste poison.\u201d\nThe ghost laughed dryly. \u201cIf the kite were going to kill you, it wouldn\u2019t be that subtle. Food is food, Lisse.\u201d\nThe food was as exactingly mediocre as she had come to expect from military food. At least it was not any worse. She found a receptacle for disposal afterward, then laid out a Scorch tableau, Candle Column to Bone, right to left. Cards rather than jerengjen, because she remembered the scuttling hound-jerengjen with creeping distaste.\nFrom the moment she left Base 87, one timer had started running down. The devastation of Ishuel\u2019s Bridge had begun another, the important one. She wasn\u2019t gambling her survival; she had already sold it. The question was, how many Imperial bases could she extinguish on her way out? And could she hunt down any of the mercenaries that had been the Imperium\u2019s killing sword?\nLisse sorted rapidly through possible targets. For instance, Base 226 Mheng, the Petaled Fortress. She would certainly perish in the attempt, but the only way she could better that accomplishment would be to raze the Imperial firstworld, and she wasn\u2019t that ambitious. There was Bridgepoint 663 Tsi-Kes, with its celebrated Pallid Sentinels, or Aerie 8 Yeneq, which built the Imperium\u2019s greatest flyers, or\u2014\nShe set the cards down, closed her eyes, and pressed her palms against her face. She was no tactician supreme. Would it make much difference if she picked a card at random?\nBut of course nothing was truly random in the ghost\u2019s presence.\nShe laid out the Candle Column again. \u201cNot 8 Yeneq,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s start with a softer target. Aerie 586 Chiu.\u201d\nLisse looked at the ghost: the habit of seeking its approval had not left her. It nodded. \u201cThe safest approach is via the Capillary Ashways. It will test your piloting skills.\u201d\nPrivately, Lisse thought that the kite would be happy to guide itself. They didn\u2019t dare allow it to, however.\nThe Capillaries were among the worst of the ashways. Even starlight moved in unnerving ways when faced with ancient networks of voidcurrent gates, unmaintained for generations, or vortices whose behavior changed day by day.\nThey were fortunate with the first several capillaries. Under other circumstances, Lisse would have gawked at the splendor of lensed galaxies and the jewel-fire of distant clusters. She was starting to manipulate the control interface without hesitating, or flinching as though a wolf\u2019s shadow might cross hers.\nAt the ninth\u2014\n\u201cPatrol,\u201d the ghost said, leaning close.\nShe nodded jerkily, trying not to show that its proximity pained her. Its mouth crimped in apology.\n\u201cIt would have been worse if we\u2019d made it all the way to 586 Chiu without a run-in,\u201d Lisse said. That kind of luck always had a price. If she was unready, best to find out now, while there was a chance of fleeing to prepare for a later strike.\nThe patrol consisted of sixteen flyers: eight Lance 82s and eight Scout 73s. She had flown similar Scouts in simulation.\nThe flyers did not hesitate. A spread of missiles streaked toward her. Lisse launched antimissile fire.\nIt was impossible to tell whether they had gone on the attack because the Imperium and the mercenaries had parted on bad terms, or because the authorities had already learned of what had befallen Rhaion. She was certain couriers had gone out within moments of the devastation of Ishuel\u2019s Bridge.\nAs the missiles exploded, Lisse wrenched the kite toward the nearest vortex. The kite was a larger and sturdier craft. It would be better able to survive the voidcurrent stresses. The tapestries dimmed as they approached. She shut off haptics as wind eddied and swirled in the command spindle. It would only get worse.\nOne missile barely missed her. She would have to do better. And the vortex was a temporary terrain advantage; she could not lurk there forever.\nThe second barrage came. Lisse veered deeper into the current. The stars took on peculiar roseate shapes.\n\u201cThey know the kite\u2019s capabilities,\u201d the ghost reminded her. \u201cUse them. If they\u2019re smart, they\u2019ll already have sent a courier burst to local command.\u201d\nThe kite suggested jerengjen flyers, harrier class. Lisse conceded its expertise.\nThe harriers unfolded as they launched, sleek and savage. They maneuvered remarkably well in the turbulence. But there were only ten of them.\n\u201cIf I fire into that, I\u2019ll hit them,\u201d Lisse said. Her reflexes were good, but not that good, and the harriers apparently liked to soar near their targets.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t need to fire,\u201d the ghost said.\nShe glanced at him, disbelieving. Her hand hovered over the controls, playing through possibilities and finding them wanting. For instance, she wasn\u2019t certain that the firebird (explosives) didn\u2019t entail self-immolation, and she was baffled by the stag.\nThe patrol\u2019s pilots were not incapable. They scorched three of the harriers. They probably realized at the same time that Lisse did that the three had been sacrifices. The other seven flensed them silent.\nLisse edged the kite out of the vortex. She felt an uncomfortable sense of duty to the surviving harriers, but she knew they were one-use, crumpled paper, like all jerengjen. Indeed, they folded themselves flat as she passed them, reducing themselves to battledrift.\n\u201cI can\u2019t see how this is an efficient use of resources,\u201d Lisse told the ghost.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an artifact of the mercenaries\u2019 methods,\u201d it said. \u201cIt works. Perhaps that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\nLisse wanted to ask for details, but her attention was diverted by a crescendo of turbulence. By the time they reached gentler currents, she was too tired to bring it up.\nThey altered their approach to 586 Chiu twice, favoring stealth over confrontation. If she wanted to char every patrol in the Imperium by herself, she could live a thousand sleepless years and never be done.\nFor six days they lurked near 586 Chiu, developing a sense for local traffic and likely defenses. Terrain would not be much difficulty. Aeries were built near calm, steady currents.\n\u201cIt would be easiest if you were willing to take out the associated city,\u201d the ghost said in a neutral voice. They had been discussing whether making a bombing pass on the aerie posed too much of a risk. Lisse had balked at the fact that 586 Chiu Second City was well within blast radius. The people who had furnished the kite\u2019s armaments seemed to have believed in surfeit. \u201cThey\u2019d only have a moment to know what was happening.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cLisse\u2014\u201d\nShe looked at it mutely, obdurate, although she hated to disappoint it. It hesitated, but did not press its case further.\n\u201cThis, then,\u201d it said in defeat. \u201cNext best odds: aim the voidcurrent disrupter at the manufactory\u2019s core while jerengjen occupy the defenses.\u201d Aeries held the surrounding current constant to facilitate the calibration of newly built flyers. Under ordinary circumstances, the counterbalancing vortex was leashed at the core. If they could disrupt the core, the vortex would tear at its surroundings.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll do, then,\u201d Lisse said. The disrupter had a short range. She did not like the idea of flying in close. But she had objected to the safer alternative.\nAerie 586 Chiu reminded Lisse not of a nest but of a pyre. Flyers and transports were always coming and going, like sparks. The kite swooped in sharp and fast. Falcon-jerengjen raced ahead of them, holding lattice formation for two seconds before scattering toward their chosen marks.\nThe aerie\u2019s commanders responded commendably. They knew the kite was by far the greater threat. But Lisse met the first flight they threw at her with missiles keen and terrible. The void lit up in a clamor of brilliant colors.\nThe kite screamed when a flyer salvo hit one of its secondary wings. It bucked briefly while the other wings changed their geometry to compensate. Lisse could not help but think that the scream had not sounded like pain. It had sounded like exultation.\nThe real test was the gauntlet of Banner 142 artillery emplacements. They were silver-bright and terrible. It seemed wrong that they did not roar like tigers. Lisse bit the inside of her mouth and concentrated on narrowing the parameters for the voidcurrent disrupter. Her hand was a fist on the control panel.\nOne tapestry depicted the currents: striations within striations of pale blue against black. Despite its shielding, the core was visible as a knot tangled out of all proportion to its size.\n\u201cNow,\u201d the ghost said, with inhuman timing.\nShe didn\u2019t wait to be told twice. She unfisted her hand.\nUnlike the wolf-strike, the disrupter made the kite scream again. It lurched and twisted. Lisse wanted to clap her hands over her ears, but there was more incoming fire, and she was occupied with evasive maneuvers. The kite folded in on itself, minimizing its profile. It dizzied her to view it on the secondary tapestry. For a panicked moment, she thought the kite would close itself around her, press her like petals in a book. Then she remembered to breathe.\nThe disrupter was not visible to human sight, but the kite could read its effect on the current. Like lightning, the disrupter\u2019s blast forked and forked again, zigzagging inexorably toward the minute variations in flux that would lead it toward the core.\nShe was too busy whipping the kite around to an escape vector to see the moment of convergence between disrupter and core. But she felt the first lashing surge as the vortex spun free of its shielding, expanding into available space. Then she was too busy steadying the kite through the triggered subvortices to pay attention to anything but keeping them alive.\nOnly later did she remember how much debris there had been, flung in newly unpredictable ways: wings torn from flyers, struts, bulkheads, even an improbable crate with small reddish fruit tumbling from the hole in its side.\nLater, too, it would trouble her that she had not been able to keep count of the people in the tumult. Most were dead already: sliced slantwise, bone and viscera exposed, trailing banners of blood; others twisted and torn, faces ripped off and cast aside like unwanted masks, fingers uselessly clutching the wrack of chairs, tables, door frames. A fracture in one wall revealed three people in dark green jackets. They turned their faces toward the widening crack, then clasped hands before a subvortex hurled them apart. The last Lisse saw of them was two hands, still clasped together and severed at the wrist.\nLisse found an escape. Took it.\nShe didn\u2019t know until later that she had destroyed 40% of the aerie\u2019s structure. Some people survived. They knew how to rebuild.\nWhat she never found out was that the disrupter\u2019s effect was sufficiently long-lasting that some of the survivors died of thirst before supplies could safely be brought in.\nIn the old days, Lisse\u2019s people took on the ghostweight to comfort the dead and be comforted in return. After a year and a day, the dead unstitched themselves and accepted their rest.\nAfter Jerengjen Day, Lisse\u2019s people struggled to share the sudden increase in ghostweight, to alleviate the flickering terror of the massacred.\nLisse\u2019s parents, unlike the others, stitched a ghost onto a child.\n\u201cThey saw no choice,\u201d the ghost told her again and again. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame them.\u201d\nThe ghost had listened uncomplainingly to her troubles and taught her how to cry quietly so the teachers wouldn\u2019t hear her. It had soothed her to sleep with her people\u2019s legends and histories, described the gardens and promenades so vividly she imagined she could remember them herself. Some nights were more difficult than others, trying to sleep with that strange, stabbing, heartpulse ache. But blame was not what she felt, not usually.\nThe second target was Base 454 Qo, whose elite flyers were painted with elaborate knotwork, green with bronze-tipped thorns. For reasons that Lisse did not try to understand, the jerengjen dismembered the defensive flight but left the painted panels completely intact.\nThe third, the fourth, the fifth\u2014she started using Scorch card values to tabulate the reported deaths, however unreliable the figures were in any unencrypted sources. For all its talents, the kite could not pierce military-grade encryption. She spent two days fidgeting over this inconvenience so she wouldn\u2019t have to think about the numbers.\nWhen she did think about the numbers, she refused to round up. She refused to round down.\nThe nightmares started after the sixth, Bridgepoint 977 Ja-Esh. The station commander had kept silence, as she had come to expect. However, a merchant coalition had broken the interdict to plead for mercy in fourteen languages. She hadn\u2019t destroyed the coalition\u2019s outpost. The station had, in reprimand.\nShe reminded herself that the merchant would have perished anyway. She had learned to use the firebird to scathing effect. And she was under no illusions that she was only destroying Imperial soldiers and bureaucrats.\nIn her dreams she heard their pleas in her birth tongue, which the ghost had taught her. The ghost, for its part, started singing her to sleep, as it had when she was little.\nThe numbers marched higher. When they broke ten million, she plunged out of the command spindle and into the room she had claimed for her own. She pounded the wall until her fists bled. Triumph tasted like salt and venom. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be so easy. In the worst dreams, a wolf roved the tapestries, eating shadows\u2014eating souls. And the void with its tinsel of worlds was nothing but one vast shadow.\nStores began running low after the seventeenth. Lisse and the ghost argued over whether it was worth attempting to resupply through black market traders. Lisse said they didn\u2019t have time to spare, and won. Besides, she had little appetite.\nIntercepted communications suggested that someone was hunting them. Rumors and whispers. They kept Lisse awake when she was so tired she wanted to slam the world shut and hide. The Imperium certainly planned reprisal. Maybe others did, too.\nIf anyone else took advantage of the disruption to move against the Imperium for their own reasons, she didn\u2019t hear about it.\nThe names of the war-kites, recorded in the Imperium\u2019s administrative language, are varied: Fire Burns the Spider Black. The Siege of the City with Seventeen Faces. Sovereign Geometry. The Glove with Three Fingers.\nThe names are not, strictly speaking, Imperial. Rather, they are plundered from the greatest accomplishments of the cultures that the mercenaries have defeated on the Imperium\u2019s behalf. Fire Burns the Spider Black was a silk tapestry housed in the dark hall of Meu Danh, ancient of years. The Siege of the City with Seventeen Faces was a saga chanted by the historians of Kwaire. Sovereign Geometry discussed the varying nature of parallel lines. And more: plays, statues, games.\nThe Imperium\u2019s scholars and artists take great pleasure in reinterpreting these works. Such achievements are meant to be disseminated, they say.\nThey were three days\u2019 flight from the next target, Base 894 Sao, when the shadow winged across all the tapestries. The void was dark, pricked by starfire and the occasional searing burst of particles. The shadow singed everything darker as it soared to intercept them, as single-minded in its purpose as a bullet. For a second she almost thought it was a collage of wrecked flyers and rusty shrapnel.\nThe ghost cursed. Lisse startled, but when she looked at it, its face was composed again.\nAs Lisse pulled back the displays\u2019 focus to get a better sense of the scale, she thought of snowbirds and stormbirds, winter winds and cutting beaks. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be natural.\u201d None of the imperial defenses had manifested in such a fashion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cThat\u2019s another war-kite.\u201d\nLisse cleared the control panel. She veered them into a chancy voidcurrent eddy.\nThe ghost said, \u201cWait. You won\u2019t outrun it. As we see its shadow, it sees ours.\u201d\n\u201cHow does a kite have a shadow in the void in the first place?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd why haven\u2019t we ever seen our own shadow?\u201d\n\u201cWho can see their own soul?\u201d the ghost said. But it would not meet her eyes.\nLisse would have pressed for more, but the shadow overtook them. It folded itself back like a plumage of knives. She brought the kite about. The control panel suggested possibilities: a two-headed dragon, a falcon, a coiled snake. Next a wolf reared up, but she quickly pulled her hand back.\n\u201cVisual contact,\u201d the kite said crisply.\nThe stranger-kite was the color of a tarnished star. It had tucked all its projections away to present a minimal surface for targeting, but Lisse had no doubt that it could unfold itself faster than she could draw breath. The kite flew a widening helix, beautifully precise.\n\u201cA mercenary salute, equal to equal,\u201d the ghost said.\n\u201cAre we expected to return it?\u201d\n\u201cAre you a mercenary?\u201d the ghost countered.\n\u201cCommunications incoming,\u201d the kite said before Lisse could make a retort.\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear it,\u201d Lisse said over the ghost\u2019s objection. It was the least courtesy she could offer, even to a mercenary.\nTo Lisse\u2019s surprise, the tapestry\u2019s raven vanished to reveal a woman\u2019s visage, not an emblem. The woman had brown skin, a scar trailing from one temple down to her cheekbone, and dark hair cropped short. She wore gray on gray, in no uniform that Lisse recognized, sharply tailored. Lisse had expected a killer\u2019s eyes, a hunter\u2019s eyes. Instead, the woman merely looked tired.\n\u201cCommander Kiriet Dzan of\u2014\u201d She had been speaking in administrative, but the last word was unfamiliar. \u201cYou would say Candle.\u201d\n\u201cLisse of Rhaion,\u201d she said. There was no sense in hiding her name.\nBut the woman wasn\u2019t looking at her. She was looking at the ghost. She said something sharply in that unfamiliar language.\nThe ghost pressed its hand against Lisse\u2019s. She shuddered, not understanding. \u201cBe strong,\u201d it murmured.\n\u201cI see,\u201d Kiriet said, once more speaking in administrative. Her mouth was unsmiling. \u201cLisse, do you know who you\u2019re traveling with?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re acquainted,\u201d the ghost said, coldly formal.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Kiriet said. \u201cBut I was the logistical coordinator for the scouring of Rhaion.\u201d She did not say consolidation. \u201cI knew why we were there. Lisse, your ghost\u2019s name is Vron Arien.\u201d\nLisse said, after several seconds, \u201cThat\u2019s a mercenary name.\u201d\nThe ghost said, \u201cSo it is. Lisse\u2014\u201d Its hand fell away.\n\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nIts mouth was taut. Then: \u201cLisse, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a deserter, Lisse,\u201d the woman said, carefully, as if she thought the information might fracture her. \u201cFor years he eluded Wolf Command. Then we discovered he had gone to ground on Rhaion. Wolf Command determined that, for sheltering him, Rhaion must be brought to heel. The Imperium assented.\u201d\nThroughout this Lisse looked at the ghost, silently begging it to deny any of it, all of it. But the ghost said nothing.\nLisse thought of long nights with the ghost leaning by her bedside, reminding her of the dancers, the tame birds, the tangle of frostfruit trees in the city square; things she did not remember herself because she had been too young when the jerengjen came. Even her parents only came to her in snatches: curling up in a mother\u2019s lap, helping a father peel plantains. Had any of the ghost\u2019s stories been real?\nShe thought, too, of the way the ghost had helped her plan her escape from Base 87, how it had led her cunningly through the maze and to the kite. At the time, it had not occurred to her to wonder at its confidence.\nLisse said, \u201cThen the kite is yours.\u201d\n\u201cAfter a fashion, yes.\u201d The ghost\u2019s eyes were precisely the color of ash after the last ember\u2019s death.\n\u201cBut my parents\u2014\u201d\nEnunciating the words as if they cut it, the ghost said, \u201cWe made a bargain, your parents and I.\u201d\nShe could not help it; she made a stricken sound.\n\u201cI offered you my protection,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cAfter years serving the Imperium, I knew its workings. And I offered your parents vengeance. Don\u2019t think that Rhaion wasn\u2019t my home, too.\u201d\nLisse was wrackingly aware of Kiriet\u2019s regard. \u201cDid my parents truly die in the consolidation?\u201d The euphemism was easier to use.\nShe could have asked whether Lisse was her real name. She had to assume that it wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d it said. \u201cAfter you were separated from them, I had no way of finding out. Lisse, I think you had better find out what Kiriet wants. She is not your friend.\u201d\nI was the logistical coordinator, Kiriet had said. And her surprise at seeing the ghost\u2014It has a name, Lisse reminded herself\u2014struck Lisse as genuine. Which meant Kiriet had not come here in pursuit of Vron Arien. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lisse asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it. I\u2019m here to destroy your kite, whatever you\u2019ve named it.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a name.\u201d She had been unable to face the act of naming, of claiming ownership.\nKiriet looked at her sideways. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cSurely you could have accomplished your goal,\u201d Lisse said, \u201cwithout talking to me first. I am inexperienced in the ways of kites. You are not.\u201d In truth, she should already have been running. But Kiriet\u2019s revelation meant that Lisse\u2019s purpose, once so clear, was no longer to be relied upon.\n\u201cI may not be your friend, but I am not your enemy, either,\u201d Kiriet said. \u201cI have no common purpose with the Imperium, not anymore. But you cannot continue to use the kite.\u201d\nLisse\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIt is the weapon I have,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be a fool to relinquish it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t deny its efficacy,\u201d Kiriet said, \u201cbut you are Rhaioni. Doesn\u2019t the cost trouble you?\u201d\nCost?\nKiriet said, \u201cSo no one told you.\u201d Her anger focused on the ghost.\n\u201cA weapon is a weapon,\u201d the ghost said. At Lisse\u2019s indrawn breath, it said, \u201cThe kites take their sustenance from the deaths they deal. It was necessary to strengthen ours by letting it feast on smaller targets first. This is the particular craft of my people, as ghostweight was the craft of yours, Lisse.\u201d\nSustenance. \u201cSo this is why you want to destroy the kite,\u201d Lisse said to Kiriet.\n\u201cYes.\u201d The other woman\u2019s smile was bitter. \u201cAs you might imagine, the Imperium did not approve. It wanted to negotiate another hundred-year contract. I dissented.\u201d\n\u201cWere you in a position to dissent?\u201d the ghost asked, in a way that made Lisse think that it was translating some idiom from its native language.\n\u201cI challenged my way up the chain of command and unseated the head of Wolf Command,\u201d Kiriet said. \u201cIt was not a popular move. I have been destroying kites ever since. If the Imperium is so keen on further conquest, let it dirty its own hands.\u201d\n\u201cYet you wield a kite yourself,\u201d Lisse said.\n\u201cCandle is my home. But on the day that every kite is accounted for in words of ash and cinders, I will turn my own hand against it.\u201d\nIt appealed to Lisse\u2019s sense of irony. All the same, she did not trust Kiriet.\nShe heard a new voice. Kiriet\u2019s head turned. \u201cSomeone\u2019s followed you.\u201d She said a curt phrase in her own language, then: \u201cYou\u2019ll want my assistance\u2014\u201d\nLisse shook her head.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small flight, as these things go, but it represents a threat to you. Let me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lisse said, more abruptly than she had meant to. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it myself.\u201d\n\u201cIf you insist,\u201d Kiriet said, looking even more tired. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d Then her face was replaced, for a flicker, with her emblem: a black candle crossed slantwise by an empty sheath.\n\u201cThe Candle is headed for a vortex, probably for cover,\u201d the ghost said, very softly. \u201cBut it can return at any moment.\u201d\nLisse thought that she was all right, and then the reaction set in. She spent several irrecoverable breaths shaking, arms wrapped around herself, before she was able to concentrate on the tapestry data.\nAt one time, every war-kite displayed a calligraphy scroll in its command spindle. The words are, approximately:\nI have only\none candle\nEven by the mercenaries\u2019 standards, it is not much of a poem. But the woman who wrote it was a soldier, not a poet.\nThe mercenaries no longer have a homeland. Even so, they keep certain traditions, and one of them is the Night of Vigils. Each mercenary honors the year\u2019s dead by lighting a candle. They used to do this on the winter solstice of an ancient calendar. Now the Night of Vigils is on the anniversary of the day the first war-kites were launched; the day the mercenaries slaughtered their own people to feed the kites.\nThe kites fly, the mercenaries\u2019 commandant said. But they do not know how to hunt.\nWhen he was done, they knew how to hunt. Few of the mercenaries forgave him, but it was too late by then.\nThe poem says: So many people have died, yet I have only one candle for them all.\nIt is worth noting that \u201chave\u201d is expressed by a particular construction for alienable possession: not only is the having subject to change, it is additionally under threat of being taken away.\nKiriet\u2019s warning had been correct. An Imperial flight in perfect formation had advanced toward them, inhibiting their avenues of escape. They outnumbered her forty-eight to one. The numbers did not concern her, but the Imperium\u2019s resources meant that if she dealt with this flight, there would be twenty more waiting for her, and the numbers would only grow worse. That they had not opened fire already meant they had some trickery in mind.\nOne of the flyers peeled away, describing an elegant curve and exposing its most vulnerable surface, painted with a rose.\n\u201cThat one\u2019s not armed,\u201d Lisse said, puzzled.\nThe ghost\u2019s expression was unreadable. \u201cHow very wise of them,\u201d it said.\nThe forward tapestry flickered. \u201cAccept the communication,\u201d Lisse said.\nThe emblem that appeared was a trefoil flanked by two roses, one stem-up, one stem-down. Not for the first time, Lisse wondered why people from a culture that lavished attention on miniatures and sculptures were so intent on masking themselves in emblems.\n\u201cCommander Fai Guen, this is Envoy Nhai Bara.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, deep and resonant, with an accent Lisse didn\u2019t recognize.\nSo I\u2019ve been promoted? Lisse thought sardonically, feeling herself tense up. The Imperium never gave you anything, even a meaningless rank, without expecting something in return.\nSoftly, she said to the ghost, \u201cThey were bound to catch up to us sooner or later.\u201d Then, to the kite: \u201cCommunications to Envoy Nhai: I am Lisse of Rhaion. What words between us could possibly be worth exchanging? Your people are not known for mercy.\u201d\n\u201cIf you will not listen to me,\u201d Nhai said, \u201cperhaps you will listen to the envoy after me, or the one after that. We are patient and we are many. But I am not interested in discussing mercy: that\u2019s something we have in common.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d Lisse said, despite the ghost\u2019s chilly stiffness. All her life she had honed herself against the Imperium. It was unbearable to consider that she might have been mistaken. But she had to know what Nhai\u2019s purpose was.\n\u201cCommander Lisse,\u201d the envoy said, and it hurt like a stab to hear her name spoken by a voice other than the ghost\u2019s, a voice that was not Rhaioni. Even if she knew, now, that the ghost was not Rhaioni, either. \u201cI have a proposal for you. You have proven your military effectiveness\u2014\u201d\nMilitary effectiveness. She had tallied all the deaths, she had marked each massacre on the walls of her heart, and this faceless envoy collapsed them into two words empty of number.\n\u201c\u2014quite thoroughly. We are in need of a strong sword. What is your price for hire, Commander Lisse?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is my\u2014\u201d She stared at the trefoil emblem, and then her face went ashen.\nIt is not true that the dead cannot be folded. Square becomes kite becomes swan; history becomes rumor becomes song. Even the act of remembrance creases the truth.\nBut the same can be said of the living.\nYoon Ha Lee's works have appeared in Lightspeed, Tor.com, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

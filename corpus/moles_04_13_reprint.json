Encantada\n Bianca Nazario stands at the end of the world.\n The firmament above is as blue as the summer skies of her childhood, mirrored in the waters of la caldera; but where the skies she remembers were bounded by mountains, here on Sky there is no real horizon, only a line of white cloud. The white line shades into a diffuse grayish fog that, as Bianca looks down, grows progressively murkier, until the sky directly below is thoroughly dark and opaque.\n She remembers what Dinh told her about the ways Sky could kill her. With a large enough parachute, Bianca imagines, she could fall for hours, drifting through the layered clouds, before finding her end in heat or pressure or the jaws of some monstrous denizen of the deep air.\n If this should go wrong, Bianca cannot imagine a better way to die.\n Bianca works her way out a few hundred meters along the base of one of Encantada\u2019s ventral fins, stopping when the dry red dirt beneath her feet begins to give way to scarred gray flesh. She takes a last look around: at the pall of smoke obscuring the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s tree-lined dorsal ridge, at the fin she stands on, curving out and down to its delicate-looking tip, kilometers away. Then she knots her scarf around her skirted ankles and shrugs into the paraballoon harness, still warm from the bungalow\u2019s fabricators. As the harness tightens itself around her, she takes a deep breath, filling her lungs. The wind from the burning camp smells of wood smoke and pine resin, enough to overwhelm the taint of blood from the killing ground.\n Blessed Virgin, she prays, be my witness: this is no suicide.\n This is a prayer for a miracle.\n She leans forward.\n She falls.\n 2. The Flying Archipelago\n The boat-like anemopter that Valadez had sent for them had a cruising speed of just less than the speed of sound, which in this part of Sky\u2019s atmosphere meant about nine hundred kilometers per hour. The speed, Bianca thought, might have been calculated to bring home the true size of Sky, the impossible immensity of it. It had taken the better part of their first day\u2019s travel for the anemopter\u2019s point of departure, the ten-kilometer, billion-ton vacuum balloon Transient Meridian, to drop from sight\u2014the dwindling golden droplet disappearing, not over the horizon, but into the haze. From that Bianca estimated that the bowl of clouds visible through the subtle blurring of the anemopter\u2019s static fields covered an area about the size of North America.\n She heard a plastic clattering on the deck behind her, and turned to see one of the anemopter\u2019s crew, a globular, brown-furred alien with a collection of arms like furry snakes, each arm tipped with a mouth or a round and curious eye. The firija were low-gravity creatures; the ones Bianca had seen on her passage from Earth had tumbled joyously through the Caliph of Baghdad\u2019s inner ring spaces like so many radially symmetrical monkeys. The three aboard the anemopter, in Sky\u2019s heavier gravity, had to make do with spindly-legged walking machines, and there was a droop in their arms that was both comical and melancholy.\n \u201cCome forward,\u201d this one told Bianca in fractured Arabic, its voice like a Peruvian pipe ensemble. She thought it was the one that called itself Isma\u00edl. \u201cMake see archipelago.\u201d\n She followed it forward to the anemopter\u2019s rounded prow. The naturalist, Erasmus Fry, was already there, resting his elbows on the rail, looking down.\n \u201cPictures don\u2019t do them justice, do they?\u201d he said.\n Bianca went to the rail and follows the naturalist\u2019s gaze. She did her best to maintain a certain stiff formality around Fry; from their first meeting aboard Transient Meridian she\u2019d had the idea that it might not be good to let him get too familiar. But when she saw what Fry was looking at, the mask slipped for a moment, and she couldn\u2019t help a sharp, quick intake of breath.\n Fry chuckled. \u201cTo stand on the back of one,\u201d he said, \u201cto stand in a valley and look up at the hills and know that the ground under your feet is supported by the bones of a living creature\u2014there\u2019s nothing else like it.\u201d He shook his head.\n At this altitude they were above all but the highest-flying of the thousands of beasts that made up Septentrionalis Archipelago. Bianca\u2019s eyes tried to make the herd (or flock, or school) of zaratanes into other things: a chain of islands, yes, if she concentrated on the colors, the greens and browns of forests and plains, the grays and whites of the snowy highlands; a fleet of ships, perhaps, if she instead focused on the individual shapes, the keel ridges, the long, translucent fins, ribbed like Chinese sails.\n The zaratanes of the archipelago were more different from one another than the members of a flock of birds or a pod of whales, but still there was a symmetry, a regularity of form, the basic anatomical plan\u2014 equal parts fish and mountain\u2014repeated throughout, in fractal detail from the great old shape of Zarat\u00e1n Finisterra, a hundred kilometers along the dorsal ridge, down to the merely hill-sized bodies of the nameless younger beasts. When she took in the archipelago as a whole, it was impossible for Bianca not to see the zaratanes as living things.\n \u201cNothing else like it,\u201d Fry repeated.\n Bianca turned reluctantly from the view, and looked at Fry. The naturalist spoke Spanish with a flawless Miami accent, courtesy, he\u2019d said, of a Consilium language module. Bianca was finding it hard to judge the ages of extra\u00f1ados, particularly the men, but in Fry\u2019s case she thought he might be ten years older than Bianca\u2019s own forty, and unwilling to admit it\u2014or ten years younger, and in the habit of treating himself very badly. On her journey here she\u2019d met cyborgs and foreigners and artificial intelligences and several sorts of alien\u2014some familiar, at least from media coverage of the hajj, and some strange\u2014but it was the extra\u00f1ados that bothered her the most. It was hard to come to terms with the idea of humans born off Earth, humans who had never been to Earth or even seen it; humans who, many of them, had no interest in it.\n \u201cWhy did you leave here, Mr. Fry?\u201d she asked.\n Fry laughed. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life out here.\u201d With a hand, he swept the horizon. \u201cStuck on some Godforsaken floating island for years on end, with no one but researchers and feral refugees to talk to, nowhere to go for fun but some slum of a balloon station, nothing but a thousand kilometers of air between you and Hell?\u201d He laughed again. \u201cYou\u2019d leave, too, Nazario, believe me.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe I would,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cBut you\u2019re back.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m here for the money,\u201d Fry said. \u201cJust like you.\u201d\n Bianca smiled, and said nothing.\n \u201cYou know,\u201d Fry said after a little while, \u201cthey have to kill the zaratanes to take them out of here.\u201d He looked at Bianca and smiled, in a way that was probably meant to be ghoulish. \u201cThere\u2019s no atmosphere ship big enough to lift a zarat\u00e1n in one piece\u2014even a small one. The poachers deflate them\u2014gut them\u2014 flatten them out and roll them up. And even then, they throw out almost everything but the skin and bones.\u201d\n \u201cStrange,\u201d Bianca mused. Her mask was back in place. \u201cThere was a packet of material on the zaratanes with my contract; I watched most of it on the voyage. According to the packet, the Consilium considers the zaratanes a protected species.\u201d\n Fry looked uneasy, and now it was Bianca\u2019s turn to chuckle.\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Fry,\u201d she said. \u201cI may not know exactly what it is Mr. Valadez is paying me to do, but I\u2019ve never had any illusion that it was legal.\u201d\n Behind her, the firija made a fluting noise that might have been laughter.\n 3. The Steel Bird\n When Bianca was a girl, the mosque of Punta Aguila was the most prominent feature in the view from her fourth-floor window, a sixteenth-century structure of tensegrity cables and soaring catenary curves, its spreading white wings vaguely\u2014but only vaguely\u2014recalling the bird that gave the city its name. The automation that controlled the tension of the cables and adjusted the mosque\u2019s wings to match the shifting winds was hidden within the cables themselves, and was very old. Once, after the hurricane in the time of Bianca\u2019s grandfather, it had needed adjusting, and the old men of the ayuntamiento had been forced to send for extra\u00f1ado technicians, at an expense so great that the jizyah of Bianca\u2019s time was still paying for it.\n But Bianca rarely thought of that. Instead she would spend long hours surreptitiously sketching those white wings, calculating the weight of the structure and the tension of the cables, wondering what it would take to make the steel bird fly.\n Bianca\u2019s father could probably have told her, but she never dared to ask. Ra\u00fal Nazario de Arenas was an aeronautical engineer, like the seven generations before him, and flight was the Nazarios\u2019 fortune; fully a third of the aircraft that plied the skies over the Rio P\u00edcaro were types designed by Ra\u00fal or his father or his wife\u2019s father, on contract to the great moro trading and manufacturing families that were Punta Aguila\u2019s truly wealthy.\n Because he worked for other men, and because he was a Christian, Ra\u00fal Nazario would never be as wealthy as the men who employed him, but his profession was an ancient and honorable one, providing his family with a more than comfortable living. If Ra\u00fal Nazario de Arenas thought of the mosque at all, it was only to mutter about the jizyah from time to time\u2014but never loudly, because the Nazarios, like the other Christians of Punta Aguila, however valued, however ancient their roots, knew that they lived there only on sufferance.\n But Bianca would sketch the aircraft, too, the swift gliders and lumbering flying boats and stately dirigibles, and these drawings she did not have to hide; in fact for many years her father would encourage her, explaining this and that aspect of their construction, gently correcting errors of proportion and balance in Bianca\u2019s drawings; would let her listen in while he taught the family profession to her brothers, Jes\u00fas the older, Pablo the younger.\n This lasted until shortly before Bianca\u2019s quincea\u00f1era, when Jes\u00fas changed his name to Wal\u00edd and married a moro\u2019s daughter, and Bianca\u2019s mother delivered a lecture concerning the difference between what was proper for a child and what was proper for a young Christian woman with hopes of one day making a good marriage.\n It was only a handful of years later that Bianca\u2019s father died, leaving a teenaged Pablo at the helm of his engineering business; and only Bianca\u2019s invisible assistance and the pity of a few old clients had kept contracts and money coming into the Nazario household.\n By the time Pablo was old enough to think he could run the business himself, old enough to marry the daughter of a musical instrument maker from Tierra Ceniza, their mother was dead, Bianca was thirty, and even if her dowry had been half her father\u2019s business, there was not a Christian man in Rio P\u00edcaro who wanted it, or her.\n And then one day Pablo told her about the extra\u00f1ado contract that had been brought to the ayuntamiento, a contract that the ayuntamiento and the Guild had together forbidden the Christian engineers of Punta Aguila to bid on\u2014a contract for a Spanish-speaking aeronautical engineer to travel a very long way from Rio P\u00edcaro and be paid a very large sum of money indeed.\n Three months later Bianca was in Quito, boarding an elevator car. In her valise was a bootleg copy of her father\u2019s engineering system, and a contract with the factor of a starship called the Caliph of Baghdad, for passage to Sky.\n 4. The Killing Ground\n The anemopter\u2019s destination was a zarat\u00e1n called Encantada, smaller than the giant Finisterra but still nearly forty kilometers from nose to tail, and eight thousand meters from gray-white keel to forested crest. From a distance of a hundred kilometers, Encantada was like a forested mountain rising from a desert plain, the clear air under its keel as dreamlike as a mirage. On her pocket system, Bianca called up pictures from Sky\u2019s network of the alpine ecology that covered the hills and valleys of Encantada\u2019s flanks: hardy grasses and small warm-blooded creatures and tall evergreens with spreading branches, reminding her of the pines and redwoods in the mountains west of Rio P\u00edcaro.\n For the last century or so Encantada had been keeping company with Zarat\u00e1n Finisterra, holding its position above the larger beast\u2019s eastern flank. No one, apparently, knew the reason, and Fry\u2014who, he being the expert, Bianca had expected to at least have a theory\u2014didn\u2019t even seem to be interested in the question.\n \u201cThey\u2019re beasts, Nazario,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t do things for reasons. We only call them animals and not plants because they bleed when we cut them.\u201d\n They were passing over Finisterra\u2019s southern slopes. Looking down, Bianca saw brighter, warmer greens, more shades than she could count, more than she had known existed, the green threaded through with bright ribbons of silver water. She saw the anemopter\u2019s shadow, a dark oblong that rode the slopes and ridges, ringed by brightness\u2014the faint reflection of Sky\u2019s sun behind them.\n And just before the shadow entered the larger darkness that was the shadow of Encantada, Bianca watched it ride over something else: a flat green space carved out of the jungle, a suspiciously geometric collection of shapes that could only be buildings, the smudge of chimney smoke.\n \u201cFry\u2014\u201d she started to say.\n Then the village, if that\u2019s what it was, was gone, hidden behind the next ridge.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d said Fry.\n \u201cI saw\u2014I thought I saw\u2014\u201d\n \u201cPeople?\u201d asked Fry. \u201cYou probably did.\u201d\n \u201cBut I thought Sky didn\u2019t have any native sentients. Who are they?\u201d\n \u201cHumans, mostly,\u201d Fry said. \u201cSavages. Refugees. Drug farmers. Five generations of escaped criminals, and their kids, and their kids.\u201d The naturalist shrugged. \u201cOnce in a while, if the Consilium\u2019s looking for somebody in particular, the wardens might stage a raid, just for show. The rest of the time, the wardens fly their dope, screw their women . . . and otherwise leave them alone.\u201d\n \u201cBut where do they come from?\u201d Bianca asked.\n \u201cEverywhere,\u201d Fry said with another shrug. \u201cHumans have been in this part of space for a long, long time. This is one of those places people end up, you know? People with nowhere else to go. People who can\u2019t fall any farther.\u201d\n Bianca shook her head, and said nothing.\n The poachers\u2019 camp, on Encantada\u2019s eastern slope, was invisible until they were almost upon it, hidden from the wardens\u2019 satellite eyes by layers of projected camouflage. Close up, the illusion seemed flat, its artificiality obvious, but it was still not until the anemopter passed through the projection that the camp itself could be seen: a clear-cut swath a kilometer wide and three times as long, stretching from the lower slopes of Encantada\u2019s dorsal ridge down to the edge of the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s cliff-like flank. Near the edge, at one corner, there was a small cluster of prefabricated bungalows; but at first it seemed to Bianca that most of the space was wasted.\n Then she saw the red churned into the brown mud of the cleared strip, saw the way the shape of the terrain suggested the imprint of a gigantic, elongated body.\n The open space was for killing.\n \u201cSky is very poor, Miss Nazario,\u201d said Valadez, over his shoulder.\n The poacher boss looked to be about fifty, stocky, his hair still black and his olive skin well-tanned but pocked with tiny scars. His Spanish was a dialect Bianca had never heard before, strange and lush, its vowels rich, its hs breathy as Bianca\u2019s js, its js warm and liquid as the ys of an Argentine. When he said fuck your mother\u2014and already, in the hour or so Bianca had been in the camp, she had heard him say it several times, though never yet to her\u2014the madre came out madri.\n About half of the poachers were human, but Valadez seemed to be the only one who spoke Spanish natively; the rest used Sky\u2019s dialect of bazaar Arabic. Valadez spoke that as well, better than Bianca did, but she had the sense that he\u2019d learned it late in life. If he had a first name, he was keeping it to himself.\n \u201cThere are things on Sky that people want,\u201d Valadez went on. \u201cBut the people of Sky have nothing of interest to anybody. The companies that mine the deep air pay some royalties. But mostly what people live on here is Consilium handouts.\u201d\n The four of them\u2014Bianca, Fry, and the firija, Isma\u00edl, who as well as being an anemopter pilot seemed to be Valadez\u2019 servant or business partner or bodyguard, or perhaps all three\u2014were climbing the ridge above the poachers\u2019 camp. Below them workers, some human, some firija, a handful of other species, were setting up equipment: mobile machines that looked like they belonged on a construction site, pipes and cylindrical tanks reminiscent of a brewery or a refinery.\n \u201cI\u2019m changing that, Miss Nazario.\u201d Valadez glanced over his shoulder at Bianca. \u201cOff-world, there are people\u2014like Isma\u00edl\u2019s people here\u201d\u2014 he waved at the firija\u2014\u201cwho like the idea of living on a floating island, and have the money to pay for one.\u201d He swept an arm, taking in the camp, the busy teams of workers. \u201cWith that money, I take boys out of the shantytowns of Sky\u2019s balloon stations and elevator gondolas. I give them tools, and teach them to kill beasts.\n \u201cTo stop me\u2014since they can\u2019t be bothered to do it themselves \u2014the Consilium takes the same boys, gives them guns, and teaches them to kill men.\u201d\n The poacher stopped and turned to face Bianca, jamming his hands into the pockets of his coat.\n \u201cTell me, Miss Nazario\u2014is one worse than the other?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not here to judge you, Mr. Valadez,\u201d said Bianca. \u201cI\u2019m here to do a job.\u201d\n Valadez smiled. \u201cSo you are.\u201d\n He turned and continued up the slope. Bianca and the firija followed, Fry trailing behind. The path switchbacked through unfamiliar trees, dark, stunted, waxy-needled; these gave way to taller varieties, including some that Bianca would have sworn were ordinary pines and firs. She breathed deeply, enjoying the alpine breeze after the crowds-and-machines reek of Transient Meridian\u2019s teeming slums, the canned air of ships and anemopters.\n \u201cIt smells just like home,\u201d she remarked. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n No once answered.\n The ridge leveled off, and they came out into a cleared space, overlooking the camp. Spread out below them Bianca could see the airfield, the globular tanks and pipes of the poachers\u2019 little industrial plant, the bungalows in the distance\u2014and, in between, the red-brown earth of the killing ground, stretching out to the cliff-edge and the bases of the nearest translucent fins.\n \u201cThis is a good spot,\u201d Valadez declared. \u201cShould be a good view from up here.\u201d\n \u201cA view of what?\u201d said Fry.\n The poacher didn\u2019t answer. He waved to Isma\u00edl, and the firija took a small folding stool out of a pocket, snapping it into shape with a flick of sinuous arms and setting it down behind him. Valadez sat.\n And after a moment, the answer to Fry\u2019s question came up over the edge.\n Bianca had not thought hardly at all about the killing of a zarat\u00e1n, and when she had thought of it she had imagined something like the harpooning of a whale in ancient times, the great beast fleeing, pursued by the tiny harassing shapes of boats, gored by harpoons, sounding again and again, all the strength bleeding out of the beast until there was nothing left for it to do but wallow gasping on the surface and expire, noble and tragic. Now Bianca realized that for all their great size, the zaratanes were far weaker than any whale, far less able to fight or to escape or even\u2014she sincerely hoped\u2014to understand what was happening to them.\n There was nothing noble about the way the nameless zarat\u00e1n died. Anemopters landed men and aliens with drilling tools at the base of each hundred-meter fin, to bore through soil and scale and living flesh and cut the connecting nerves that controlled them. This took about fifteen minutes, and to Bianca there seemed to be something obscene in the way the paralyzed fins hung there afterwards, lifeless and limp. Thus crippled, the beast was pushed and pulled by aerial tugs\u2014awkward machines, stubby and cylindrical, converted from the stationkeeping engines of vacuum balloons like Transient Meridian\u2014into position over Encantada\u2019s killing ground. Then the drilling teams moved in again, to the places marked for them ahead of time by seismic sensors and ultrasound, cutting this time through bone as well as flesh, to find the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s brain.\n When the charges the drilling teams had planted went off, a ripple went through the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s body, a slow-motion convulsion that took nearly a minute to travel down the body\u2019s long axis, as the news of death passed from synapse to synapse; and Bianca saw flocks of birds started from the trees along the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s back as if by an earthquake, which in a way she supposed this was. The carcass immediately began to pitch downward, the nose dropping\u2014the result, Bianca realized, of sphincters relaxing one by one, all along the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s length, venting hydrogen from the ballonets.\n Then the forward edge of the keel fin hit the ground and crumpled, and the whole length of the dead beast, a hundred thousand tons of it, crashed down into the field; and even at that distance Bianca could hear the cracking of gargantuan bones.\n She shivered, and glanced at her pocket system. The whole process, she was amazed to see, had taken less than half an hour.\n \u201cThat\u2019s this trip paid for, whatever else happens,\u201d said Valadez. He turned to Bianca. \u201cMostly, though, I thought you should see this. Have you guessed yet what it is I\u2019m paying you to do, Miss Nazario?\u201d\n Bianca shook her head. \u201cClearly you don\u2019t need an aeronautical engineer to do what you\u2019ve just done.\u201d She looked down at the killing ground, where men and aliens and machines were already climbing over the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s carcass, uprooting trees, peeling back skin and soil in great strips like bleeding boulevards. A wind had come up, blowing from the killing ground across the camp, bringing with it a smell that Bianca associated with butcher shops.\n An engineering problem, she reminded herself, as she turned her back on the scene and faced Valadez. That\u2019s all this is.\n \u201cHow are you going to get it out of here?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cCargo-lifter,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cThe Lupita Jer\u00e9z. A supply ship, diverted from one of the balloon stations.\u201d\n The alien, Isma\u00edl, said: \u201cLike fly anemopter make transatmospheric.\u201d The same fluting voice and broken Arabic. \u201cLifter plenty payload mass limit, but fly got make have packaging. Packaging for got make platform have stable.\u201d On the word packaging the firija\u2019s arms made an expressive gesture, like rolling something up into a bundle and tying it.\n Bianca nodded hesitantly, hoping she understood. \u201cAnd so you can only take the small ones,\u201d she said. \u201cRight? Because there\u2019s only one place on Sky you\u2019ll find a stable platform that size: on the back of another zarat\u00e1n.\u201d\n \u201cYou have the problem in a nutshell, Miss Nazario,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cNow, how would you solve it? How would you bag, say, Encantada here? How would you bag Finisterra?\u201d\n Fry said: \u201cYou want to take one alive?\u201d His face was even more pale than usual, and Bianca noticed that he, too, had turned is back to the killing ground.\n Valadez was still looking at Bianca, expectantly.\n \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want it alive, Mr. Fry,\u201d she said, watching the poacher expectantly. \u201cHe wants it dead\u2014but intact. You could take even Finisterra apart, and lift it piece by piece, but you\u2019d need a thousand cargo-lifters to do it.\u201d\n Valadez smiled.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got another ship,\u201d he said. \u201cBuilt for deep mining, outfitted as a mobile elevator station. Counterweighted. The ship itself isn\u2019t rated for atmosphere, but if you can get one of the big ones to the edge of space, we\u2019ll lower the skyhook, catch the beast, and catapult it into orbit. The buyer\u2019s arranged an FTL tug to take it from there.\u201d\n Bianca made herself look back at the killing ground. The workers were freeing the bones, lifting them with aerial cranes and feeding them into the plant; for cleaning and preservation, she supposed. She turned back to Valadez.\n \u201cWe should be able to do that, if the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s body will stand up to the low pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why go to all this trouble? I\u2019ve seen the balloon stations. I\u2019ve seen what you people can do with materials. How hard can it be to make an imitation zarat\u00e1n?\u201d\n Valadez glanced at Isma\u00edl. The walker was facing the killing ground, but two of the alien\u2019s many eyes were watching the sky\u2014and two more were watching Valadez. The poacher looked back at Bianca.\n \u201cAn imitation\u2019s one thing, Miss Nazario; the real thing is something else. And worth a lot more, to the right buyer.\u201d He looked away again; not at Isma\u00edl this time, but up the slope, through the trees. \u201cBesides,\u201d he added, \u201cin this case I\u2019ve got my own reasons.\u201d\n \u201cShip come,\u201d Isma\u00edl announced.\n Bianca looked and saw more of the firija\u2019s eyes turning upward. She followed their gaze, and at first saw only empty sky. Then the air around the descending Lupita Jer\u00e9z boiled into contrails, outlining the invisible ovoid shape of the ship\u2019s lifting fields.\n \u201cTime to get to work,\u201d said Valadez.\n Bianca glanced toward the killing ground. A pink fog was rising to cover the work of the flensing crews.\n The air was full of blood.\n 5. The aeronauts\n Valadez\u2019s workers cleaned the nameless zarat\u00e1n\u2019s bones one by one; they tanned the hide, and rolled it into bundles for loading aboard the Lupita Jer\u00e9z. That job, grotesque though it was, was the cleanest part of the work. What occupied most of the workers was the disposal of the unwanted parts, a much dirtier and more arduous job. Exotic internal organs the size of houses; tendons like braided, knotted bridge cables; ballonets large enough, each of them, to lift an ordinary dirigible; and hectares and hectares of pale, dead flesh. The poachers piled up the mess with earth-moving machines and shoveled it off the edge of the killing ground, a rain of offal falling into the clouds in a mist of blood, manna for the ecology of the deep air. They sprayed the killing ground with antiseptics, and the cool air helped to slow decay a little, but by the fourth day the butcher-shop smell had nonetheless given way to something worse.\n Bianca\u2019s bungalow was one of the farthest out, only a few dozen meters from Encantada\u2019s edge, where the wind blew in from the open eastern sky, and she could turn her back on the slaughter to look out into clear air, dotted with the small, distant shapes of younger zaratanes. Even here, though, a kilometer and more upwind of the killing ground, the air carried a taint of spoiled meat. The sky was full of insects and scavenger birds, and there were always vermin underfoot.\n Bianca spent most of her time indoors, where the air was filtered and the wet industrial sounds of the work muted. The bungalow was outfitted with all the mechanisms the extra\u00f1ados used to make themselves comfortable, but while in the course of her journey Bianca had learned to operate these, she made little use of them. Besides her traveling chest\u2014a gift from her older brother\u2019s wife, which served as armoire, desk, dresser and drafting table\u2014the only furnishings were a woven carpet in the Lagos Grandes style, a hard little bed, and a single wooden chair, not very different from the ones in her room in Punta Aguila. Though those had been handmade, and these were simulations provided by the bungalow\u2019s machines.\n The rest of the room was given over to the projected spaces of Bianca\u2019s engineering work. The tools Valadez had given her were slick and fast and factory-fresh, the state of somebody\u2019s art, somewhere; but what Bianca mostly found herself using was her pocket system\u2019s crippled copy of the Nazario family automation.\n The system Bianca\u2019s father used to use, to calculate stresses in fabric and metal and wood, to model the flow of air over wings and the variation of pressure and temperature through gasbags, was six centuries old, a slow, patient, reliable thing that dated from before the founding of the London Caliphate. It had aged along with the family, grown used to their quirks and to the strange demands of aviation in Rio P\u00edcaro. Bianca\u2019s version of it, limited though it was, at least didn\u2019t balk at control surfaces supported by muscle and bone, at curves not aerodynamically smooth but fractally complex with grasses and trees and hanging vines. If the zaratanes had been machines, they would have been marvels of engineering, with their internal networks of gasbags and ballonets, their reservoir-sized ballast bladders full of collected rainwater, their great delicate fins. The zaratanes were beyond the poachers\u2019 systems\u2019 stubborn, narrow-minded comprehension; for all their speed and flash, the systems sulked like spoiled children whenever Bianca tried to use them to do something their designers had not expected her to do.\n Which she was doing, all the time. She was working out how to draw up Leviathan with a hook.\n \u201cMiss Nazario.\u201d\n Bianca started. She had yet to grow used to these extra\u00f1ado telephones that never rang, but only spoke to her out of the air, or perhaps out of her own head.\n \u201cMr. Valadez,\u201d she said, after a moment.\n \u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing, drop it,\u201d said Valadez\u2019s voice. \u201cYou and Fry. I\u2019m sending a \u2018mopter for you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d said Bianca. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Fry\u2019s doing.\u201d\n \u201cThis is work,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n A change in the quality of the silence told Bianca that Valadez had hung up. She sighed; then stood, stretched, and started to braid her hair.\n The anemopter brought them up over the dorsal ridge, passing between two of the great translucent fins. At this altitude, Encantada\u2019s body was clear of vegetation; Bianca looked down on hectares of wind-blasted gray hide, dusted lightly with snow. They passed within a few hundred meters of one of the huge spars that anchored the after fin\u2019s leading edge: a kilometers-high pillar of flesh, teardrop in cross-section and at least a hundred meters thick. The trailing edge of the next fin, by contrast, flashed by in an instant, and Bianca had only a brief impression of a silk-supple membrane, veined with red, clear as dirty glass.\n \u201cWhat do you think he wants?\u201d Fry asked.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She nodded her head toward the firija behind them at the steering console. \u201cDid you ask the pilot?\u201d\n \u201cI tried,\u201d Fry said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t speak Arabic.\u201d\n Bianca shrugged. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d\n Then they were coming down again, down the western slope. In front of Bianca was the dorsal ridge of Zarat\u00e1n Finisterra. Twenty kilometers away and blue with haze, it nonetheless rose until it seemed to cover a third of the sky.\n Bianca looked out at it, wondering again what kept Encantada and Finisterra so close; but then the view was taken away, and they were coming down between the trees, into a shady, ivy-filled creekbed somewhere not far from Encantada\u2019s western edge. There was another anemopter already there, and a pair of aerial tugs\u2014and a whitish mass that dwarfed all of these, sheets and ribbons of pale material hanging from the branches and draped over the ivy, folds of it damming the little stream.\n With an audible splash, the anemopter set down, the ramps lowered, and Bianca stepped off, into cold, ankle-deep water that made her glad of her knee-high boots. Fry followed, gingerly.\n \u201cYou!\u201d called Valadez, pointing at Fry from the deck of the other anemopter. \u201cCome here. Miss Nazario\u2014I\u2019d like you to have a look at that balloon.\u201d\n \u201cBalloon?\u201d\n Valadez gestured impatiently downstream, and suddenly Bianca saw the white material for the shredded, deflated gasbag it was; and saw, too, that there was a basket attached to it, lying on its side, partially submerged in the middle of the stream. Isma\u00edl was standing over it, waving.\n Bianca splashed over to the basket. It actually was a basket, two meters across and a meter and a half high, woven from strips of something like bamboo or rattan. The gasbag\u2014this was obvious, once Bianca saw it up close\u2014had been made from one of the ballonets of a zarat\u00e1n, a zarat\u00e1n younger and smaller even than the one Bianca had seen killed; it had been tanned, but inexpertly, and by someone without access to the sort of industrial equipment the poachers used.\n Bianca wondered about the way the gasbag was torn up. The tissues of the zarat\u00e1nes, she knew, were very strong. A hydrogen explosion?\n \u201cMake want fly got very bad,\u201d Isma\u00edl commented, as Bianca came around to the open side of the basket.\n \u201cThey certainly did,\u201d she said.\n In the basket there were only some wool blankets and some empty leather waterbags, probably used both for drinking water and for ballast. The lines used to control the vent flaps were all tangled together, and tangled, too, with the lines that secured the gasbag to the basket, but Bianca could guess how they had worked. No stove. It seemed to have been a pure hydrogen balloon; and why not, she thought, with all the hydrogen anyone could want free from the nearest zarat\u00e1n\u2019s vent valves?\n \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d she asked.\n Isma\u00edl rippled his arms in a way that Bianca guessed was meant to be an imitation of a human shrug. One of his eyes glanced downstream.\n Bianca fingered the material of the basket: tough, woody fiber. Tropical, from a climate warmer than Encantada\u2019s. She followed Isma\u00edl\u2019s glance. The trees hid the western horizon, but she knew, if she could see beyond them, what would be there.\n Aloud, she said: \u201cFinisterra.\u201d\n She splashed back to the anemopters. Valadez\u2019s hatch was open.\n \u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d Fry was saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know her!\u201d\n \u201cFuck off, Fry,\u201d Valadez said as Bianca stepped into the cabin. \u201cLook at her ID.\u201d\n The her in question was a young woman with short black hair and sallow skin, wearing tan off-world cottons like Fry\u2019s under a colorful homespun serape; and at first Bianca was not sure the woman was alive, because the man next to her on Valadez\u2019s floor, also in homespun, was clearly dead, his eyes half-lidded, his olive skin gone muddy gray.\n The contents of their pockets were spread out on a low table. As Bianca was taking in the scene, Fry bent down and picked up a Consilium-style ID tag.\n \u201c\u2018Edith Dinh,\u2019\u201c he read. He tossed the tag back and looked at Valadez. \u201cSo?\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Edith Dinh, Consilium Ethnological Service,\u2019\u201c Valadez growled. \u201cIssued Shawwal \u201843. You were here with the Ecological Service from Rajab \u201842 to Muharram \u201846. Look again!\u201d\n Fry turned away.\n \u201cAll right!\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe\u2014maybe I met her once or twice.\u201d\n \u201cSo,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere. Who the hell is she? And what\u2019s she doing here?\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s . . . \u201d Fry glanced at the woman and then quickly looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think she was a population biologist or something. There was a group working with the, you know, the natives\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThere aren\u2019t any natives on Sky,\u201d said Valadez. He prodded the dead man with the toe of his boot. \u201cYou mean these cabrones?\u201d\n Fry nodded. \u201cThey had this \u2018sustainable development\u2019 program going\u2014farming, forestry. Teaching them how to live on Finisterra without killing it.\u201d\n Valadez looked skeptical. \u201cIf the Consilium wanted to stop them from killing Finisterra, why didn\u2019t they just send in the wardens?\u201d\n \u201cInterdepartmental politics. The zaratanes were EcoServ\u2019s responsibility; the n-\u2014I mean, the inhabitants were EthServ\u2019s.\u201d Fry shrugged. \u201cYou know the wardens. They\u2019d have taken bribes from anyone who could afford it, and shot the rest.\u201d\n \u201cDamn right I know the wardens.\u201d Valadez scowled. \u201cSo instead EthServ sent in these do-gooders to teach them to make balloons?\u201d\n Fry shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d\n \u201cMiss Nazario? Tell me about that balloon.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a hydrogen balloon, I think. Probably filled from some zarat\u00e1n\u2019s external vents.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt looks like the sort of thing I\u2019d expect someone living out here to build, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d\n Valadez nodded.\n \u201cBut,\u201d Bianca added, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you why it crashed.\u201d\n Valadez snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt crashed because we shot it down.\u201d Pitching his voice for the anemopter\u2019s communication system, he called out: \u201cIsma\u00edl!\u201d\n Bianca tried to keep the shock from showing on her face, and after a moment, she had regained her composure. You knew they were criminals when you took their money, she told herself.\n The firija\u2019s eyes came around the edge of the doorway.\n \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cTell the tug crews to pack that thing up,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cEvery piece, every scrap. Pack it up and drop it into clear air.\u201d\n The alien\u2019s walking machine clambered into the cabin. Its legs bent briefly, making a little bob like a curtsey.\n \u201cYes.\u201d Isma\u00edl gestured at the bodies of the dead man and the unconscious woman. Several of the firija\u2019s eyes met Valadez\u2019s. \u201cThese two what do?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cThem, too,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cLash them into the basket.\u201d\n The firija made another bob, and started to bend down to pick them up.\n Bianca looked down at the two bodies, both of them, the dead man and the unconscious woman, looking small and thin and vulnerable. She glanced at Fry, whose eyes were fixed on the floor, his lips pressed together in a thin line.\n Then she looked over at Valadez, who was methodically sweeping the balloonists\u2019 effects into a pile, as if neither Bianca nor Fry was present.\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said; and Isma\u00edl stopped, and straightened up.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d said Valadez.\n \u201cNo,\u201d Bianca repeated.\n \u201cYou want her bringing the wardens down on us?\u201d Valadez demanded.\n \u201cThat\u2019s murder, Mr. Valadez,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cI won\u2019t be a party to it.\u201d\n The poacher\u2019s eyes narrowed. He gestured at the dead man.\n \u201cYou\u2019re already an accessory,\u201d he said.\n \u201cAfter the fact,\u201d Bianca replied evenly. She kept her eyes on Valadez.\n The poacher looked at the ceiling. \u201cFuck your mother,\u201d he muttered. He looked down at the two bodies, and at Isma\u00edl, and then over at Bianca. He sighed, heavily.\n \u201cAll right,\u201d he said to the firija. \u201cTake the live one back to the camp. Secure a bungalow, one of the ones out by the edge\u201d\u2014he glanced at Bianca\u2014\u201cand lock her in it. Okay?\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d said Isma\u00edl. \u201cDead one what do?\u201d\n Valadez looked at Bianca again. \u201cThe dead one,\u201d he said, \u201cgoes in the basket.\u201d\n Bianca looked at the dead man again, wondering what bravery or madness had brought him aboard that fragile balloon, and wondering what he would have thought if he had known that the voyage would end this way, with his body tumbling down into the deep air. She supposed he must have known there was a chance of it.\n After a moment, she nodded, once.\n \u201cRight,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cNow get back to work, damn it.\u201d\n 6. The city of the dead\n The anemopter that brought Bianca and Fry over the ridge took them back. Fry was silent, hunched, his elbows on his knees, staring at nothing. What fear or guilt was going through his mind, Bianca couldn\u2019t guess.\n After a little while she stopped watching him. She thought about the Finisterran balloon, so simple, so fragile, making her father\u2019s wood-and-silk craft look as sophisticated as the Lupita Jer\u00e9z. She took out her pocket system, sketched a simple globe and basket, then erased them.\n Make want fly very bad, Isma\u00edl the firija had said. Why?\n Bianca undid the erasure, bringing her sketch back. She drew the spherical balloon out into a blunt torpedo, round at the nose, tapering to a point behind. Added fins. An arrangement of pulleys and levers, allowing them to be controlled from the basket. A propeller, powered by\u2014she had to think for a little while\u2014by an alcohol-fueled engine, carved from zarat\u00e1n bones . . .\n The anemopter was landing. Bianca sighed and again erased the design.\n Why?\n The firija guard outside Edith Dinh\u2019s bungalow didn\u2019t seem to speak Arabic or Spanish, or in fact any human language at all. Bianca wondered if the choice was deliberate, the guard chosen by Valadez as a way of keeping a kind of solitary confinement.\n Or was the guard Valadez\u2019s choice at all? she wondered suddenly, and shivered, looking at the meter-long weapon cradled in the alien\u2019s furred arms.\n Then she squared her shoulders and approached the bungalow. Wordlessly, she waved the valise she was carrying, as if by it her reason for being there were made customary and obvious.\n The alien said something in its own fluting language\u2014 whether a reply to her, or a request for instructions from some unseen listener, Bianca couldn\u2019t tell. Either those instructions were to let her pass, though, or by being seen in Valadez\u2019s company she had acquired some sort of reflected authority; because the firija lifted its weapon and, as the bungalow\u2019s outer door slid open, motioned for her to enter. The inner door was already open.\n \u201c\u00bfH\u00f3la?\u201d Bianca called out, tentatively, and immediately felt like an idiot.\n But the answer came:\n \u201cAqui.\u201d\n The interior layout of the bungalow was the same as Bianca\u2019s. The voice came from the sitting room, and Bianca found Dinh there, still wearing the clothes she\u2019d had on when they found her, sitting with her knees drawn up, staring out the east window into the sky. The east was dark with rain clouds, and far below, Bianca could see flashes of lightning.\n \u201cSalaam aleikum,\u201d said Bianca, taking refuge in the formality of the Arabic.\n \u201cAleikum as-salaam,\u201d Dinh replied. She glanced briefly at Bianca and looked away; then looked back again. In a Spanish that was somewhere between Valadez\u2019s strange accent and the mechanical fluency of Fry\u2019s language module, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re not from Finisterra.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Bianca, giving up on the Arabic. \u201cI\u2019m from Rio P\u00edcaro\u2014from Earth. My name is Nazario, Bianca Nazario y Arenas.\u201d\n \u201cEdith Dinh.\u201d\n Dinh stood up. There was an awkward moment, where Bianca was not sure whether to bow or curtsey or give Dinh her hand. She settled for proffering the valise.\n \u201cI brought you some things,\u201d she said. \u201cClothes, toiletries.\u201d\n Dinh looked surprised. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, taking the valise and looking inside.\n \u201cAre they feeding you? I could bring you some food.\u201d\n \u201cThe kitchen still works,\u201d said Dinh. She held up a white packet. \u201cAnd these?\u201d\n \u201cSanitary napkins,\u201d said Bianca.\n \u201cSanitary . . .?\u201d Color rose to Dinh\u2019s face. \u201cOh. That\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve got implants.\u201d She dropped the packet back in the valise and closed it.\n Bianca looked away, feeling her own cheeks blush in turn. Damned extra\u00f1ados, she thought. \u201cI\u2019d better\u2014\u201d be going, she started to say.\n \u201cPlease\u2014\u201d said Dinh.\n The older woman and the younger stood there for a moment, looking at each other, and Bianca suddenly wondered what impulse had brought her here, whether curiosity or Christian charity or simply a moment of loneliness, weakness. Of course she\u2019d had to stop Valadez from killing the girl, but this was clearly a mistake.\n \u201cSit,\u201d Dinh said. \u201cLet me get you something. Tea. Coffee.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014All right.\u201d Bianca sat, slowly, perching on the edge of one of the too-soft extra\u00f1ado couches. \u201cCoffee,\u201d she said.\n The coffee was very dark, and sweeter than Bianca liked it, flavored with something like condensed milk. She was glad to have it, regardless, glad to have something to look at and something to occupy her hands.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a poacher,\u201d Dinh said.\n \u201cI\u2019m an aeronautical engineer,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cI\u2019m doing some work for them.\u201d She looked down at her coffee, took a sip, and looked up. \u201cWhat about you? Fry said you\u2019re a biologist of some kind. What were you doing in that balloon?\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t tell whether the mention of Fry\u2019s name had registered, but Dinh\u2019s mouth went thin. She glanced out the west window.\n Bianca followed her glance and saw the guard, slumped in its walker, watching the two women with one eye each. She wondered again whether Valadez was really running things, and then whether the firija\u2019s ignorance of human language was real or feigned\u2014and whether, even if it was real, someone less ignorant might be watching and listening, unseen.\n Then she shook her head and looked back at Dinh, waiting.\n \u201cFinisterra\u2019s falling,\u201d Dinh said eventually. \u201cDying, maybe. It\u2019s too big; it\u2019s losing lift. It\u2019s fallen more than fifty meters in the last year alone.\u201d\n \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cThe lift-to-weight ratio of an aerostat depends on the ratio of volume to surface area. A larger zarat\u00e1n should be more efficient, not less. And even if it does lose lift, it should only fall until it reaches a new equilibrium.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a machine,\u201d Dinh said. \u201cIt\u2019s a living creature.\u201d\n Bianca shrugged. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s old age, then,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything has to die sometime.\u201d\n \u201cNot like this,\u201d Dinh said. She set down her coffee and turned to face Bianca fully. \u201cLook. We don\u2019t know who built Sky, or how long ago, but it\u2019s obviously artificial. A gas giant with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere? That doesn\u2019t happen. And the Earthlike biology\u2014the zarat\u00e1nes are DNA-based, did you know that? The whole place is astronomically unlikely; if the Phenomenological Service had its way, they\u2019d just quarantine the entire system, and damn Sky and everybody on it.\n \u201cThe archipelago ecology is as artificial as everything else. Whoever designed it must have been very good; post-human, probably, maybe even post-singularity. It\u2019s a robust equilibrium, full of feedback mechanisms, ways to correct itself. But we, us ordinary humans and human-equivalents, we\u2019ve\u201d \u2014she made a helpless gesture\u2014\u201cfucked it up. You know why Encantada\u2019s stayed here so long? Breeding, that\u2019s why . . . or maybe \u2018pollination\u2019 would be a better way to put it . . . \u201d\n She looked over at Bianca.\n \u201cThe death of an old zarat\u00e1n like Finisterra should be balanced by the birth of dozens, hundreds. But you, those bastards you work for, you\u2019ve killed them all.\u201d\n Bianca let the implication of complicity slide. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s hear your plan.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cYour plan,\u201d Bianca repeated. \u201cFor Finisterra. How are you going to save it?\u201d\n Dinh stared at her for a moment, then shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She stood up, and went to the east window. Beyond the sheet of rain that now poured down the window the sky was deep mauve shading to indigo, relieved only by the lightning that sparked in the deep and played across the fins of the distant zaratanes of the archipelago\u2019s outer reaches. Dinh put her palm flat against the diamond pane.\n \u201cI can\u2019t save Finisterra,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI just want to stop you hijos de puta from doing this again.\u201d\n Now Bianca was stung. \u201cHija de puta, yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re killing them, too. Killing them and making balloons out of them, how is that better?\u201d\n Dinh turned back. \u201cOne zarat\u00e1n the size of the one they\u2019re slaughtering out there right now would keep the Finisterrans in balloons for a hundred years,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way to save the archipelago is to make the zaratanes more valuable alive than dead\u2014and the only value a live zarat\u00e1n has, on Sky, is as living space.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get the Finisterrans to colonize the other zaratanes?\u201d Bianca asked. \u201cBut why should they? What\u2019s in it for them?\u201d\n \u201cI told you,\u201d Dinh said. \u201cFinisterra\u2019s dying.\u201d She looked out the window, down into the depths of the storm, both hands pressed against the glass. \u201cDo you know how falling into Sky kills you, Bianca? First, there\u2019s the pressure. On the slopes of Finisterra, where the people live, it\u2019s a little more than a thousand millibars. Five kilometers down, under Finisterra\u2019s keel, it\u2019s double that. At two thousand millibars you can still breathe the air. At three thousand nitrogen narcosis sets in\u2014\u2018rapture of the deep,\u2019 they used to call it. At four thousand, the partial pressure of oxygen alone is enough to make your lungs bleed.\u201d\n She stepped away from the window and looked at Bianca.\n \u201cBut you\u2019ll never live to suffer that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause of the heat. Every thousand meters the average temperature rises six or seven degrees. Here it\u2019s about fifteen. Under Finisterra\u2019s keel it\u2019s closer to fifty. Twenty kilometers down, the air is hot enough to boil water.\u201d\n Bianca met her gaze steadily. \u201cI can think of worse ways to die,\u201d she said.\n \u201cThere are seventeen thousand people on Finisterra,\u201d said Dinh. \u201cMen, women, children, old people. There\u2019s a town\u2014they call it the Lost City, la ciudad perdida. Some of the families on Finisterra can trace their roots back six generations.\u201d She gave a little laugh, with no humor in it. \u201cThey should call it la ciudad muerta. They\u2019re the walking dead, all seventeen thousand of them. Even though no one\u2019s alive on Finisterra today will live to see it die. Already the crops are starting to fail. Already more old men and old women die every summer, as the summers get hotter and drier. The children of the children who are born today will have to move up into the hills as it starts to get too hot to grow crops on the lower slopes; but the soil isn\u2019t as rich up there, so many of those crops will fail, too. And their children\u2019s children . . . won\u2019t live to be old enough to have children of their own.\u201d\n \u201cSurely someone will rescue them before then,\u201d Bianca said.\n \u201cWho?\u201d Dinh asked. \u201cThe Consilium? Where would they put them? The vacuum balloons and the elevator stations are already overcrowded. As far as the rest of Sky is concerned, the Finisterrans are \u2018malcontents\u2019 and \u2018criminal elements.\u2019 Who\u2019s going to take them in?\u201d\n \u201cThen Valadez is doing them a favor,\u201d Bianca said.\n Dinh started. \u201cEmmanuel Valadez is running your operation?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not my operation,\u201d Bianca said, trying to keep her voice level. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t ask his first name.\u201d\n Dinh fell into the window seat. \u201cOf course it would be,\u201d she said. \u201cWho else would they . . . \u201d She trailed off, looking out the west window, toward the killing ground.\n Then, suddenly, she turned back to Bianca.\n \u201cWhat do you mean, doing them a favor?\u201d she said.\n \u201cFinisterra,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cHe\u2019s poaching Finisterra.\u201d\n Dinh stared at her. \u201cMy God, Bianca! What about the people?\u201d\n \u201cWhat about them?\u201d asked Bianca. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off somewhere else\u2014you said that yourself.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what makes you think Valadez will evacuate them?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s a thief, not a mass murderer.\u201d\n Dinh gave her a withering look. \u201cHe is a murderer, Bianca. His father was a warden, his mother was the wife of the alcalde of Ciudad Perdida. He killed his own stepfather, two uncles, and three brothers. They were going to execute him\u2014throw him over the edge\u2014but a warden airboat picked him up. He spent two years with them, then killed his sergeant and three other wardens, stole their ship and sold it for a ticket off-world. He\u2019s probably the most wanted man on Sky.\u201d\n She shook her head and, unexpectedly, gave Bianca a small smile.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t know any of that when you took the job, did you?\u201d\n Her voice was full of pity. It showed on her face as well, and suddenly Bianca couldn\u2019t stand to look at it. She got up and went to the east window. The rain was lighter now, the lightning less frequent.\n She thought back to her simulations, her plans for lifting Finisterra up into the waiting embrace of the skyhook: the gasbags swelling, the zarat\u00e1n lifting, first slowly and then with increasing speed, toward the upper reaches of Sky\u2019s atmosphere. But now her inner vision was not the ghost-shape of a projection but a living image\u2014trees cracking in the cold, water freezing, blood boiling from the ground in a million, million tiny hemorrhages.\n She saw her mother\u2019s house in Punta Aguila\u2014her sister-in-law\u2019s house, now: saw its windows rimed with frost, the trees in the courtyard gone brown and sere. She saw the Mercado de los Maculados beneath a blackening sky, the awnings whipped away by a thin wind, ice-cold, bone-dry.\n He killed that Finisterran balloonist, she thought. He was ready to kill Dinh. He\u2019s capable of murder.\n Then she shook her head.\n Killing one person, or two, to cover up a crime, was murder, she thought. Killing seventeen thousand people by deliberate asphyxiation\u2014 men, women, and children\u2014wasn\u2019t murder, it was genocide.\n She took her cup of coffee from the table, took a sip and put it down again.\n \u201cThank you for the coffee,\u201d she said, and turned to go.\n \u201cHow can you just let him do this?\u201d Dinh demanded. \u201cHow can you help him do this?\u201d\n Bianca turned on her. Dinh was on her feet; her fists were clenched, and she was shaking. Bianca stared her down, her face as cold and blank as she could make it. She waited until Dinh turned away, throwing herself into a chair, staring out the window.\n \u201cI saved your life,\u201d Bianca told her. \u201cThat was more than I needed to do. Even if I did believe that Valadez meant to kill every person on Finisterra, which I don\u2019t, that wouldn\u2019t make it my problem.\u201d\n Dinh turned farther away.\n \u201cListen to me,\u201d Bianca said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m only going to explain this once.\u201d\n She waited until Dinh, involuntarily, turned back to face her.\n \u201cThis job is my one chance,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cThis job is what I\u2019m here to do. I\u2019m not here to save the world. Saving the world is a luxury for spoiled extra\u00f1ado children like you and Fry. It\u2019s a luxury I don\u2019t have.\u201d\n She went to the door, and knocked on the window to signal the firija guard.\n \u201cI\u2019ll get you out of here if I can,\u201d she added, over her shoulder. \u201cBut that\u2019s all I can do. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Dinh hadn\u2019t moved.\n As the firija opened the door, Bianca heard Dinh stir.\n \u201cErasmus Fry?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe naturalist?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bianca glanced back, and saw Dinh looking out the window again.\n \u201cI\u2019d like to see him,\u201d Dinh said.\n \u201cI\u2019ll let him know,\u201d said Bianca.\n The guard closed the door behind her.\n 7. The face in the mirror\n There was still lightning playing along Encantada\u2019s dorsal ridge, but here on the eastern edge the storm had passed. A clean, electric smell was in the air, relief from the stink of the killing ground. Bianca returned to her own bungalow through a rain that had died to sprinkles.\n She called Fry.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cMiss Dinh,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cShe wants to see you.\u201d\n There was silence on the other end. Then:\n \u201cYou told her I was here?\u201d\n \u201cSorry,\u201d Bianca said, insincerely. \u201cIt just slipped out.\u201d\n More silence.\n \u201cYou knew her better than you told Valadez, didn\u2019t you,\u201d she said.\n She heard Fry sigh. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cShe seemed upset,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cYou should go see her.\u201d\n Fry sighed again, but said nothing.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d\n She ended the call.\n She was supposed to make a presentation tomorrow, to Valadez and some of the poachers\u2019 crew bosses, talking about what they would be doing to Finisterra. It was mostly done; the outline was straightforward, and the visuals could be auto-generated from the design files. She opened the projection file, and poked at it for a little while, but found it hard to concentrate.\n Suddenly to Bianca her clothes smelled of death, of Dinh\u2019s dead companion and the slaughtered zarat\u00e1n and the death she\u2019d spared Dinh from and the eventual deaths of all the marooned Finisterrans. She stripped them off and threw them in the recycler; bathed, washed her hair, changed into a nightgown.\n They should call it la ciudad muerta.\n Even though no one who\u2019s alive on Finisterra today will live to see it die.\n She turned off the light, Dinh\u2019s words echoing in her head, and tried to sleep. But she couldn\u2019t; she couldn\u2019t stop thinking. Thinking about what it felt like to be forced to live on, when all you had to look forward to was death.\n She knew that feeling very well.\n What Bianca had on Pablo\u2019s wife M\u00e9lia, the instrument-maker\u2019s daughter, was ten years of age, and a surreptitious technical education. What M\u00e9lia had on Bianca was a keen sense of territory, and the experience of growing up in a house full of sisters. Bianca continued to live in the house after M\u00e9lia moved in, even though it was M\u00e9lia\u2019s house now, and continued, without credit, to help her brother with the work that came in. But she retreated over the years, step by step, until the line was drawn at the door of the fourth-floor room that had been hers ever since she was a girl, and buried herself in her blueprints and her calculations, and tried to pretend she didn\u2019t know what was happening.\n And then there was the day she met her other sister-in-law. Her moro sister-in-law. In the Mercado de los Maculados, where the aliens and the extra\u00f1ados came to sell their trinkets and their medicines; a dispensation from the ayuntamiento had recently opened it to Christians.\n Zahra al-Halim, a successful architect, took Bianca to her home, where Bianca ate caramels and drank blackberry tea and saw her older brother for the first time in more than twenty years, and tried very hard to call him Wal\u00edd and not Jes\u00fas. Here was a world\u2014Bianca sensed; her brother and his wife were very discreet\u2014that could be hers, too, if she wanted it. But like Jes\u00fas/Wal\u00edd, she would have to give up her old world to have it. Even if she remained a Christian she would never see the inside of a church again. And she would still never be accepted by the engineers\u2019 guild.\n She went back to the Nazario house that evening, ignoring the barbed questions from M\u00e9lia about how she had spent her day; she went back to her room, with its blueprints and its models, and the furnishings she\u2019d had all her life. She tried for a little while to work, but was unable to muster the concentration she needed to interface with the system.\n Instead she found herself looking into the mirror.\n And looking into the mirror Bianca focused not on the fragile trapped shapes of the flying machines tacked to the wall behind her, spread out and pinned down like so many chloroformed butterflies, but on her own tired face, the stray wisps of dry, brittle hair, the lines that years of captivity had made across her forehead and around her eyes. And, meeting those eyes, it seemed to Bianca that she was looking not into the mirror but down through the years of her future, a long, straight, narrow corridor without doors or branches, and that the eyes she was meeting at the end of it were the eyes of Death, Bianca\u2019s own, su propria Muerte, personal, personified.\n Bianca got out of bed, turning on the lights. She picked up her pocket system. She wondered if she should call the wardens.\n Instead she un-erased, yet again, the sketch she\u2019d made earlier of the simple alcohol-powered dirigible. She used the Nazario family automation to fill it out with diagrams and renderings, lists of materials, building instructions, maintenance and pre-flight checklists.\n It wasn\u2019t much, but it was better than Dinh\u2019s balloon.\n Now she needed a way for Dinh to get it to the Finisterrans.\n For that\u2014thinking as she did so that there was some justice in it\u2014she turned back to the system Valadez had given her. This was the sort of work the extra\u00f1ado automation had been made for, no constraints other than those imposed by function, every trick of exotic technology available to be used. It was a matter of minutes for Bianca to sketch out her design; an hour or so to refine it, to trim away the unnecessary pieces until what remained was small enough to fit in the valise she\u2019d left with Dinh. The only difficult part was getting the design automation to talk to the bungalow\u2019s fabricator, which was meant for clothes and furniture and domestic utensils. Eventually she had to use her pocket system to go out on Sky\u2019s local net\u2014hoping as she did so that Valadez didn\u2019t have anyone monitoring her\u2014and spend her own funds to contract the conversion out to a consulting service, somewhere out on one of the elevator gondolas.\n Eventually she got it done, though. The fabricator spit out a neat package, which Bianca stuffed under the bed. Tomorrow she could get the valise back and smuggle the package to Dinh, along with the dirigible designs.\n But first she had a presentation to make to Valadez. She wondered what motivated him. Nothing so simple as money\u2014she was sure of that, even if she had trouble believing he was the monster Dinh had painted him to be. Was it revenge he was after? Revenge on his family, revenge on his homeland?\n That struck Bianca a little too close to home.\n She sighed, and turned out the lights.\n 8. The professionals\n By morning the storm had passed and the sky was blue again, but the inside of Valadez\u2019 bungalow was dark, to display the presenters\u2019 projections to better advantage. Chairs for Valadez and the human crew bosses were arranged in a rough semicircle; with them were the aliens whose anatomy permitted them to sit down. Isma\u00edl and the other firija stood in the back, their curled arms and the spindly legs of their machines making their silhouettes look, to Bianca, incongruously like those of potted plants.\n Then the fronds stirred, suddenly menacing, and Bianca shivered. Who was really in charge?\n No time to worry about that now. She straightened up and took out her pocket system.\n \u201cIn a moment,\u201d she began, pitching her voice to carry to the back of the room, \u201cMr. Fry will be going over the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s metabolic processes, and our plans to stimulate the internal production of hydrogen. What I\u2019m going to be talking about is the engineering work required to make that extra hydrogen do what we need it to do.\u201d\n Bianca\u2019s pocket system projected the shape of a hundred-kilometer zarat\u00e1n, not Finisterra or any other particular individual but rather an archetype, a sort of Platonic ideal. Points of pink light brightened all across the projected zarat\u00e1n\u2019s back, each indicating the position of a sphincter that would have to be cut out and replaced with a mechanical valve.\n \u201cOur primary concern during the preparation phase has to be these external vents. However, we also need to consider the internal trim and ballast valves . . . \u201d\n As she went on, outlining the implants and grafts, surgeries and mutilations needed to turn a living zarat\u00e1n into an animatronic corpse, a part of her was amazed at her own presumption, amazed at the strong, confident, professional tone she was taking.\n It was almost as if she were a real engineer.\n The presentation came to a close. Bianca drew in a deep breath, trying to maintain her veneer of professionalism. This part wasn\u2019t in her outline.\n \u201cAnd then, finally, there is the matter of evacuation,\u201d she said.\n In the back of the room, Isma\u00edl stirred. \u201cEvacuation?\u201d he asked\u2014the first word anyone had uttered through the whole presentation.\n Bianca cleared her throat. Red stars appeared along the imaginary zarat\u00e1n\u2019s southeastern edge, approximating the locations of Ciudad Perdida and the smaller Finisterran villages.\n \u201cFinisterra has a population of between fifteen and twenty thousand, most of them concentrated in these settlements here,\u201d she began. \u201cUsing a ship the size of the Lupita Jer\u00e9z, it should take roughly\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNot your problem, Miss Nazario.\u201d Valadez waved a hand. \u201cIn any case, there won\u2019t be any evacuations.\u201d\n Bianca looked at him, appalled, and it must have shown on her face, because Valadez laughed.\n \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Miss Nazario. We\u2019ll set up field domes over Ciudad Perdida and the central pueblos, to tide them over till we get them where they\u2019re going. If they keep their heads they should be fine.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cFucking hell,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cWhat did you think this was about? You didn\u2019t think we were going to kill twenty thousand people, did you?\u201d\n Bianca didn\u2019t answer. She shut the projection off and sat down, putting her pocket system away. Her heart was racing.\n \u201cRight,\u201d said Valadez. \u201cNice presentation, miss Nazario. Mr. Fry?\u201d\n Fry stood up. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me\u2014\u201d He patted his pockets. \u201cI, ah, I think I must have left my system in my bungalow.\u201d\n Valadez sighed.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll wait,\u201d he said.\n The dark room was silent. Bianca tried to take slow, deep breaths. Mother of God, she thought, thank you for not letting me do anything stupid.\n In the next moment she doubted herself. Dinh had been so sure. How could Bianca know whether Valadez was telling the truth?\n There was no way to know, she decided. She\u2019d just have to wait and see.\n Fry came back in, breathless.\n \u201cAh, it wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n The voice that interrupted him was loud enough that at first it was hardly recognizable as a voice; it was only a wall of sound, seeming to come from the air itself, echoing and reechoing endlessly across the camp.\n \u201cTHIS IS AN ILLEGAL ENCAMPMENT,\u201d it said, in bazaar Arabic. \u201cALL PERSONNEL IN THE ENCAMPMENT WILL ASSEMBLE ON OPEN GROUND AND SURRENDER TO THE PARK WARDENS IN AN ORDERLY FASHION. ANY PERSONS CARRYING WEAPONS WILL BE PRESUMED TO BE RESISTING ARREST AND WILL BE DEALT WITH ACCORDINGLY. ANY VEHICLE ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE THE ENCAMPMENT WILL BE DESTROYED. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO COMPLY.\u201d\n The announcement repeated itself: first in the fluting language of the firija, then in Miami Spanish, then as a series of projected alien glyphs, logograms and semagrams. Then the Arabic started again.\n \u201cFuck your mother,\u201d said Valadez grimly.\n All around Bianca, poachers were gathering weapons. In the back of the room, the firija were having what looked like an argument, arms waving, voices raised in a hooting, atonal cacophony.\n \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Fry shouted, over the wardens\u2019 announcement.\n \u201cGet out of here,\u201d said Valadez.\n \u201cMake fight!\u201d said Isma\u00edl, turning several eyes from the firija discussion.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that resisting arrest?\u201d asked Bianca.\n Valadez laughed harshly. \u201cNot shooting back isn\u2019t going to save you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wardens aren\u2019t the Phenomenological Service. They\u2019re not civilized Caliphate cops. Killed while resisting arrest is what they\u2019re all about. Believe me\u2014I used to be one.\u201d\n Taking a surprisingly small gun from inside his jacket, he kicked open the door and was gone.\n Around the Lupita Jer\u00e9z was a milling knot of people, human and otherwise, some hurrying to finish the loading, others simply fighting to get aboard.\n Something large and dark, and fast, passed over the camp, and there was a white flash from the cargo-lifter, and screams.\n In the wake of the dark thing came a sudden sensation of heaviness, as if the flank of Encantada were the deck of a ship riding a rogue wave, leaping up beneath Bianca\u2019s feet. Her knees buckled and she was thrown to the ground, pressed into the grass by twice, three times her normal weight.\n The feeling passed as quickly as the wardens\u2019 dark vehicle, and Isma\u00edl, whose walker had kept its footing, helped Bianca up.\n \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Bianca demanded, bruises making her wince as she tried to brush the dirt and grass from her skirts.\n \u201cAntigravity ship,\u201d Isma\u00edl said. \u201cSame principle like starship wave propagation drive.\u201d\n \u201cAntigravity?\u201d Bianca stared after the ship, but it was already gone, over Encantada\u2019s dorsal ridge. \u201cIf you co\u00f1os have antigravity, then why in God\u2019s name have we been sitting here playing with catapults and balloons?\u201d\n \u201cMake very expensive,\u201d said Isma\u00edl. \u201cMinus two suns exotic mass, same like starship.\u201d The firija waved two of its free eyes. \u201cWhy do? Plenty got cheap way to fly.\u201d\n Bianca realized that despite the remarks Valadez had made on the poverty of Sky, she had been thinking of all extra\u00f1ados and aliens\u2014 with their ships and machines, their familiar way with sciences that in Rio P\u00edcaro were barely more than a whisper of forbidden things hidden behind the walls of the rich moros\u2019 palaces\u2014as wealthy, and powerful, and free. Now, feeling like a fool for not having understood sooner, she realized that between the power of the Consilium and people like Valadez there was a gap as wide as, if not wider than, the gap between those rich moros and the most petty Ali Baba in the back streets of Punta Aguila.\n She glanced toward the airfield. Aerial tugs were lifting off; anemopters were blurring into motion. But as she watched, one of the tugs opened up into a ball of green fire. An anemopter made it as far as the killing ground before being hit by something that made its static fields crawl briefly with purple lightnings and then collapse, as the craft\u2019s material body crashed down in an explosion of earth.\n And all the while the wardens\u2019 recorded voice was everywhere and nowhere, repeating its list of instructions and demands.\n \u201cNot any more, we don\u2019t,\u201d Bianca said to Isma\u00edl. \u201cWe\u2019d better run.\u201d\n The firija raised its gun. \u201cFirst got kill prisoner.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n But Isma\u00edl was already moving, the mechanical legs of the walker sure-footed on the broken ground, taking long, swift strides, no longer comical but frighteningly full of purpose.\n Bianca struggled after the firija, but quickly fell behind. The surface of the killing ground was rutted and scarred, torn by the earth-moving equipment used to push the offal of the gutted zaratanes over the edge. Bianca supposed grasses had covered it once, but now there was only mud and old blood. Only the certainty that going back would be as bad as going forward kept Bianca moving, slipping and stumbling in reeking muck that was sometimes ankle-deep.\n By the time she got to Dinh\u2019s bungalow, Isma\u00edl was already gone. The door was ajar.\n Maybe the wardens rescued her, Bianca thought; but she couldn\u2019t make herself believe it.\n She went inside, moving slowly.\n \u201cEdith?\u201d\n No answer; not that Bianca had really expected any.\n She found her in the kitchen, face down, feet toward the door as if she had been shot while trying to run, or hide. From three meters away Bianca could see the neat, black, fist-sized hole in the small of Dinh\u2019s back. She felt no need to get closer.\n Fry\u2019s pocket system was on the floor in the living room, as Bianca had known it would be.\n \u201cYou should have waited,\u201d Bianca said to the empty room. \u201cYou should have trusted me.\u201d\n She found her valise in Dinh\u2019s bedroom, and emptied the contents onto the bed. Dinh did not seem to have touched any of them.\n Bianca\u2019s eyes stung with tears. She glanced again at Fry\u2019s system. He\u2019d left it on purpose, Bianca realized; she\u2019d underestimated him. Perhaps he had been a better person than she herself, all along.\n She looked one more time at the body lying on the kitchen floor.\n \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said then. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have trusted me at all.\u201d\n Then she went back to her own bungalow and took the package out from under the bed.\n 9. Finisterra\n A hundred meters, two hundred, five hundred\u2014Bianca falls, the wind whipping at her clothes, and the hanging vegetation that covers Encantada\u2019s flanks is a green-brown blur, going gray as it thins, as the zarat\u00e1n\u2019s body curves away from her. She blinks away the tears brought on by the rushing wind, and tries to focus on the monitor panel of the harness. The wind speed indicator is the only one that makes sense; the others\u2014altitude, attitude, rate of descent\u2014are cycling through nonsense in three languages, baffled by the instruments\u2019 inability to find solid ground anywhere below.\n Then Bianca falls out of Encantada\u2019s shadow into the sun, and before she can consciously form the thought her hand has grasped the emergency handle of the harness and pulled, convulsively; and the glassy fabric of the paraballoon is billowing out above her, rippling like water, and the harness is tugging at her, gently but firmly, smart threads reeling themselves quickly out and then slowly in again on their tiny spinnerets.\n After a moment, she catches her breath. She is no longer falling, but flying.\n She wipes the tears from her eyes. To the west, the slopes of Finisterra are bright and impossibly detailed in the low-angle sunlight, a million trees casting a million tiny shadows through the morning\u2019s rapidly dissipating mist.\n She looks up, out through the nearly invisible curve of the paraballoon, and sees that Encantada is burning. She watches it for a long time.\n The air grows warmer, and more damp, too. With a start, Bianca realizes she is falling below Finisterra\u2019s edge. When she designed the paraballoon, Bianca intended for Dinh to fall as far as she safely could, dropping deep into Sky\u2019s atmosphere before firing up the reverse Maxwell pumps, to heat the air in the balloon and lift her back to Finisterra; but it does not look as if there is any danger of pursuit now, from either the poachers or the wardens. Bianca starts the pumps, and the paraballoon slows, then begins to ascend.\n As the prevailing wind carries her inland, over a riot of tropical green, and in the distance Bianca sees the smoke rising from the chimneys of Ciudad Perdida, Bianca glances up again at the burning shape of Encantada, and wonders whether she\u2019ll ever know if Valadez was telling the truth.\n Abruptly the jungle below her opens up, and Bianca is flying over cultivated fields, and people are looking up at her in wonder. Without thinking, she has cut the power to the pumps and opened the parachute valve at the top of the balloon.\n She lands hard, hobbled by the scarf still tied around her ankles, and rolls, the paraballoon harness freeing itself automatically, in obedience to its original programming. She pulls the scarf loose and stands up, shaking out her torn, stained skirt. Children are already running toward her across the field.\n Savages, Fry said. Refugees. Bianca wonders if all of them speak Valadez\u2019 odd Spanish. She tries to gather her scraps of Arabic, but is suddenly unable to remember anything beyond Salaam alaikum.\n The children\u2014six, eight, ten of them\u2014falter as they approach, stopping five or ten meters away.\n Salaam alaikum, Bianca rehearses silently. Alaikum as-salaam. She takes a deep breath.\n The boldest of the children, a stick-legged boy of eight or ten, takes a few steps closer. He has curly black hair and sun-browned skin, and the brightly colored shirt and shorts he is wearing were probably made by an autofactory on one of the elevator gondolas or vacuum balloon stations, six or seven owners ago. He looks like her brother Pablo, in the old days, before Jes\u00fas left.\n Trying not to look too threatening, Bianca meets his dark eyes.\n \u201cH\u00f3la,\u201d she says.\n \u201cH\u00f3la,\u201d the boy answers. \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo te llamas? \u00bfEs este su globo?\u201d\n Bianca straightens her back.\n \u201cYes, it\u2019s my balloon,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you may call me Se\u00f1ora Nazario.\u201d\n \u201cIf the balloon\u2019s yours,\u201d the boy asks, undaunted, \u201cwill you let me fly in it?\u201d\n Bianca looks out into the eastern sky, dotted with distant zaratanes. There is a vision in her mind, a vision that she thinks maybe Edith Dinh saw: the skies of Sky more crowded than the skies over Rio P\u00edcaro, Septentrionalis Archipelago alive with the bright shapes of dirigibles and gliders, those nameless zaratanes out there no longer uncharted shoals but comforting and familiar landmarks.\n She turns to look at the rapidly collapsing paraballoon, and wonders how much work it would take to inflate it again. She takes out her pocket system and checks it: the design for the hand-built dirigible is still there, and the family automation too.\n This isn\u2019t what she wanted, when she set out from home; but she is still a Nazario, and still an engineer.\n She puts the system away and turns back to the boy.\n \u201cI have a better idea,\u201d she says. \u201cHow would you like a balloon of your very own?\u201d\n The boy breaks into a smile.\n Originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, December 2007.\n David Moles is a past finalist for the Hugo Award, the World Fantasy Award, and the John W.

I\u2019m in the middle of the \u201cEnd of a Zeitgeist\u201d panel, waiting for one of the other panelists to wind up an interminable digression about SETI, when I see him at the back of the room, checking his glass. I meet his eyes, just long enough to acknowledge that he\u2019s there, and he nods. He\u2019s wearing a badge; he must have paid the money for a one-day pass, even though he can\u2019t stand Coronal academics and the fringe element even less. Got enough of one from me, and enough of the other from Wallace, I\u2019d guess.\nThe other panelist\u2014I\u2019ve forgotten his name\u2014isn\u2019t winding up, and because he\u2019s remoting in he doesn\u2019t notice the moderator casting irritated glances at him. \u201cThe mistake we\u2019ve always made, it seems to me, is that we have always assumed that communication must be the same no matter whether human or xenosapient. The Corona Borealis informational space proved the exact opposite.\u201d\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t exactly true,\u201d I interrupt. The panelist blinks; he must have assumed that I was zoning out. Safe assumption, these days. \u201cThe actual transmissions found in Coronal infospace are remarkably similar to what you\u2019d find in a thirty-year slice of human broadcast media\u2014in fact, what we find in most recorded communication: lists, transactions, announcements, stories. The context is different, but the content is similar. It was the method that was opaque.\u201d\nHe splutters, ready to argue. But the moderator\u2019s still young enough to be nostalgic, and she doesn\u2019t like him any more than I do. \u201cSpeaking of opacity, Dr. Kostia, it\u2019s really been your metaphor that\u2019s driven most of our understanding of Coronal transmissions. Would you care to recapitulate it?\u201d\nI glance at Randall and decide against drawing it out. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to leave me something for the closing keynote,\u201d I say, and get a chuckle from somewhere in the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s a story for another time.\u201d\nWrong choice of words. I can see that in the faces of the front row. The stories have all been told. The stories are all gone now.\n\u201cImagine a man in a bright room,\u201d I say. It\u2019s two days later, I\u2019m giving the ending keynote, and bright room is a little too on-the-nose for where I am currently standing. I can barely see the edge of the stage past the lights, and I can only assume my images are up on the screens. \u201cHe wanders around the room, calling out, and wonders why there is no answer from outside. On that basis, he assumes that outside must be empty.\u201d\nRandall isn\u2019t here. I hope he\u2019s home, with Brendan and the girls. I hope he\u2019s had the sense to ignore all of this. I know I don\u2019t have to hope, because Randall has always been the quietly sensible one of us, the one who empathized and cared and knew that the best thing to do was to steer his own ship. The Coronals had heroes like him, I know.\nMy breath catches in my throat. \u201cImagine that man,\u201d I say again, and swallow. \u201cAnd then, imagine his realization that if he stands close to the glass of his walls, blocking the glare of his lights, he can see through them. And there is someone on the other side, waving.\u201d\nRandall waits for me to make my way to him through the departing audience. \u201cHello, Randall,\u201d I say, and reach out for a hug.\nHe pulls me in, almost off my feet. \u201cHi, Ma.\u201d It feels like hugging a cinderblock in a sweater.\n\u201cOof. Give me my ribs back, won\u2019t you? How\u2019s Brendan? How are the girls?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Sinny made a picture for you\u2014I should have brought it, I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d He shoves both hands in his pockets, checks his glass again. \u201cMa, have you heard from Wally at all?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m rarely in touch with Wallace,\u201d I say breezily, and it doesn\u2019t even begin to mask the sting. \u201cI\u2019d hoped we\u2019d see him at Thanksgiving this year.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s\u2014I\u2019d hoped so too, but he\u2019s . . . \u201d He raises both hands as if to offer me something, then lowers them. \u201cYou know he\u2019s with one of the\u2014these groups.\u201d He nods to some of the one-day attendees, two wearing carefully reconstructed Coronal jewelry, one with her ears pinned forward in what some idiot has claimed must be some resemblance to the Coronal cranial shape. There are always a few at any conference, but these are as hollow-eyed as the rest of us, their hope as extinguished as the empty lanterns some carry (a reference to a Coronal song cycle, and likely mistranslated). \u201cLike the ones he was with in high school. And college.\u201d\nI take a long, slow breath and let it out. College was news to me; I thought he\u2019d gotten away from the cults when he left high school. \u201cYou think I\u2019m likely to see him here? That\u2019d be lovely. I mean it; I\u2019d love to see him before November.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean\u2014not like the dress-up-and-sing-songs people. The group he\u2019s with sounds, well, kind of scary-intense.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cMa, he asked me if I had any access to Granma\u2019s old cloud. I mean, I get descendant-right requests all the time, but they\u2019re all from, you know.\u201d He nods to the girls and to the man behind them holding a mandala-patterned banner. I think of Virginia and Denmark, and shiver. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s asking me, it has to be something that he doesn\u2019t have first full descendant-right to, so it\u2019s probably one of the ones Granma shut off from immediate request. Like the, the original Coronal code.\u201d\nI do the thing with the breath again. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . not good.\u201d\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s nothing, I think\u2014he sounded down, Ma. Real depressed, like back in high school. And I think about the, the news out of Virginia\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHush.\u201d I put my fingertips to his lips. The room\u2019s emptied out, but more people will be coming in shortly, and right now no one wants to think about mass suicides. The fringe because they want to distinguish themselves from that level of crazy; the academics because we\u2019re guiltily aware we\u2019ve contributed to it. \u201cYou really think he might?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been able to tell, with him.\u201d Poor sensible Randall, beset on either side by the Coronals. \u201cI know you can, though.\u201d\nTo my shame, I think seriously about telling him I can\u2019t go. It\u2019s the middle of the conference, after all, and I have two more panels in the next couple of days, never mind the closing keynote. And it\u2019s not like this conference will be happening again. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d I finally ask.\n\u201cOn the coast.\u201d I feel my glass twitch with the information he\u2019s sent over. \u201cIt\u2019s about a day\u2019s drive. I\u2019d go, but you know he doesn\u2019t listen to me. Well, he listens, but it\u2019s not like he lets it make a difference.\u201d\nI can make it there and back before the closing keynote. Assuming nothing goes wrong. Assuming it\u2019s not too late already. \u201cCome on. Help me check my car back out.\u201d\n\u201cFor those of you who were around for the initial signal\u2014that\u2019s, what, half of us?\u2014you remember how much of a shift it was. Here we were, going along in our bright room, and suddenly this signal from ADS 9731 in Corona Borealis starts rewriting an entire high performance computing center.\u201d I\u2019ve told the story about that day so many times, and I\u2019m suddenly tired of telling it. It\u2019s the embellished version, anyway; I mostly knew something was up because the power went out in the base and I couldn\u2019t play Puppy Duel on my dad\u2019s tablet until it recharged. But the story made a good introduction, and I could still remember Mom\u2019s face when she came out of lockdown.\n\u201cDanforth and Rajasthani were the first ones who realized that the initial signal wasn\u2019t an attack. It was, and is, the closest thing we have to semisapient code. When the signal came in contact\u2014and by which I mean when it was recorded, replayed, and analyzed in an appropriately complex context\u2014it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It changed our world, though that was really more of a side effect.\u201d\nSomeone laughs, nervously. I ignore it. \u201cWhat it did was to rewrite its surroundings\u2014the computing center\u2014and turn it into a receiver for Coronal infospace.\u201d And then go dormant, for which my mother was grateful every day of her life. The signal in its dormant form was usable, understandable, replicable to the point that just about anyone could make their own access to infospace\u2014and it didn\u2019t go trying to rewrite anything. Mom once told me that some idiot had attempted to encode the Coronal signal into human DNA to see if it would perceive that as an informational context. Lucky for us all, either the semisapient code deemed it not complex enough or detected significant harm done in potential rewrite, so it just fizzled. But it gave her, and then me, nightmares.\n\u201cThere was one metaphor\u2014I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t mine\u2014that it was like giving a radio to a \u2018savage.\u2019 Strip away the racism, and there\u2019s a grain of truth: because we had never known about infospace, we\u2019d assumed there was nothing to hear. But now we switch that radio on, and we find that what was silence is now chatter. The air is full of voices. Strange voices, from four hundred light-years away.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve heard this before. Those voices are why they are here.\n\u201cIncomprehensible voices, mind you. Do any of you remember those first few translations? I think someone set them to a dance remix when I was in junior high. But the second genius of the initial transmission was that it didn\u2019t just convert itself into an infospace receiver; it made itself a translator for whatever linguistic context it was in. All of the Coronal communications\u2014all of the drama, news, bulletins, pleas, shopping lists, everything that went out into their infospace\u2014was so much clearer when viewed through multiple translations.\n\u201cWith every language I learned, I was able to focus my understanding of Coronal broadcasts, get a better sense of their original meaning. I would imagine the same holds true for most of us in this room. For decades, we have had the entire infospace of an alien civilization to investigate. And look at all the things we found!\u201d\nI hold up the program, read a few names of papers. It\u2019s a cheap trick, meant to make people feel as if their work hasn\u2019t been for naught. I\u2019d planned to say more about the smaller discoveries, the paths that Coronal Studies have made, as if I were pleading before the university trustees again not to disband the department. I don\u2019t have it in me, now. My joints hurt from travel; my throat from shouting, even now; my eyes just hurt. I drop the program, and it slides off the stage. Somewhere behind me, I can almost hear the conference organizers frowning.\n\u201cAnd yet there\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know.\u201d And won\u2019t, now. \u201cWe do not know what it means that so many of their family sagas ended mid-childbirth scene. Nor why their military might was measured in what translated to most Earth languages as moons. I personally have always wondered why in the Interleaf broadcast, the speaker repeats You are my taste, my tongue, my scenting organ. It obviously meant something. But like an inscription in a secondhand book, that meaning is lost.\u201d\nSo much of what I\u2019ve had from my second son has been secondhand. So much lost.\nRandall apologizes again for not bringing Sinny\u2019s drawing, asks what I\u2019m going to do now that the department is closing. I haven\u2019t told him my real plans. I think once he finds out, he\u2019ll be just as worried about me on some level as he is about Wallace. We make our way out, through the protests, the crowds, the gawkers, and I give Randall a goodbye kiss.\nI start driving up the coast. I used to drive this way with the boys on vacation. And earlier, coming up this way with Mom and Dad, hearing them argue about infospace, whether it could be anything but a hoax, how much work it would take to make such a hoax, why her computing cycles had been co-opted by Danforth and Rajasthani and why was Rajasthani such a bitch anyway. (They were colleagues, not friends.)\nThis far off the interstates, there are still billboards: Cathedral Mountain Retreat/Divinity Center (with Coronal Meditation removed so recently the shadow of the letters is still there); Legal Advice? You Deserve More; Samaritans\u2014We\u2019re Here to Listen; Apple Picking and Hayride\u2014You Just Missed Us. Book for Family Events! Next Exit! It\u2019s Not Too Late!\nIf I were on the interstate, I could pull down a screen to block those advertisements from view; as it is, I read each as it goes by. After a while, I make myself spell out alphabets from them, one by one. Another game from those long drives.\nI\u2019m doing that breath thing again. It\u2019s not as if I have to psych myself up to say this. It\u2019s nothing new. \u201cAbout sixteen, seventeen years ago, I noticed something off about Coronal infospace. I didn\u2019t point it out at the time mainly because I thought I was projecting. Coronal communications are so easy to reinterpret to fit the details of whatever the interpreter is concerned with, and right then I was very concerned with death.\u201d\nSilence. The organizers are probably in the wings now, trying to figure out whether to cut my mike; I must sound like I\u2019m going confessional. Well, so I am. \u201cBoth of my parents were dying at the time, Dad from a slow-escalating kidney failure, Mom from ovarian cancer that threatened to overtake Dad\u2019s timeline. I had doctors\u2019 appointments and hospice preparation and PTA and soccer and meetings and meetings and meetings . . . and whenever I reviewed infospace, I kept seeing the same things.\n\u201cThe official broadcasts had shifted a little, more reassurance that all was well, that citizens should be aware of their risks, that all was well. It\u2019s just a stomach cramp, don\u2019t worry. No, I don\u2019t need to get it checked out. I\u2019m fine.\n\u201cLocal transmissions were less sanguine, sometimes directing emergency services, sometimes eliminating entire subjects or regions from their discussions. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I\u2019m seeing a doctor, and that\u2019s all you need to know.\n\u201cOccasionally there would be sudden bursts of frantic activity, calls for help. We\u2019d gotten used to that, but these\u2014there wouldn\u2019t be any follow-up. No answer to those calls. This is a lot to put on you, but here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\n\u201cThe music and art had always been diverse in subject and style, but there seemed to be a melancholic, pensive tone to much of it now. Well, you get to a certain point, and you know there\u2019s fewer days ahead than behind. How does that one poem go, the one about regret?\n\u201cIndividual communications had always been a very minor subset of the transmissions, but the few I followed seemed to be Coronals reaching out for each other, trying to find each other, holding on. Sit with me here a while. This is nice, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve always been so proud of you.\u201d\nMy eyes are watering. \u201cI was, at the time, very aware that I was reading my parents\u2019 deaths into infospace. I hoped it was just me.\u201d\nHalf of the conference is on flow; I tune the car\u2019s glass to mine and let presentation after presentation eat the road. \u201cLinguistic Difference in a Cross-Section of the Early Conquest Dramas\u201d derails pretty quickly, assuming that the Conquest Dramas are a purposeful corpus rather than a loose grouping of similar works. I can\u2019t watch the visuals on a road like this\u2014I have to keep watch on the road\u2014but I can imagine the expressions of the attendees. \u201cInfospace as Archive? The Purpose of Coronal Transmission\u201d tries to claim that infospace was meant as a sacred repository, rather than what they had available\u2014like assuming we used radio out of worship of a sky-deity.\nI pull into a rest stop after the day closes with \u201cMarking Time: Signatures in Coronal Rhythm-Intensive Music,\u201d and none too soon; Coronal music does not translate well, and it\u2019s always made me drowsy. My glass wakes me before dawn, and after I return from a trip to the restrooms the early-morning presentations have begun with \u201cFear of the Other and Governmental Responses to the Initial Signal.\u201d My bones hurt even more now, and it takes me a couple of minutes to fold myself back into the car, more to make myself eat a breakfast muffin from the vending machines.\nI reach the address Randall sent just after noon. The sign used to read COSMIC ILLUMINATION MEDITATION RETREAT, but it\u2019s been papered over poorly with a crude poster of a hand holding a torch. I don\u2019t know which worries me more.\nIt\u2019s a small cluster of houses, close to the ocean, probably once a little resort before its cosmic phase. There\u2019s a big, bare circle in the middle, not a parking lot as I first think. I get out and see it\u2019s a sand painting, or rather dirt painting, gravel raked into a crosshatch pattern that I recognize. Infospace didn\u2019t have visuals for the most part, but many broadcasts described mandalas like this.\nI think of the images from Virginia, the painted mandala on the concrete and the bodies laid out carefully around it, the similar images from Malawi, from Honduras, from Denmark. There are people walking around the houses, some talking expressively, waving their hands; some pumping water; one or two regarding me with curiosity.\nI march up to the women at the pump, absently identifying the language they\u2019re speaking as Finnish. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Wallace,\u201d I say. \u201cEstin Wallace.\u201d\nOne of them has the pinned-ear look; the other is wearing a gauze skirt and blouse, what my mother would have called another goddamn hippie and my father tried to capture in paint. Both of them wear glass, though, and they don\u2019t bristle at my presence. The End of Speech cult, the one that Wallace got involved in when he turned seventeen\u2014they scorned anyone who actually knew Coronal studies instead of \u201csensing their way through them.\u201d\nPinned-ears looks me up and down. \u201cMain house. Top floor.\u201d She adds as I start to walk, \u201cYou look like him.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting inside the house. There\u2019s what looks like another mandala in the foyer, this time in brightly colored sand that\u2019s been tracked over several times, and a rack of servers in the dining room, with fans running next to them. I step around the mandala, thinking that the one rack probably has all the computing power of my mother\u2019s old research center. Changes, not all driven by the Coronals.\nTwo people are arguing in Urdu on the second floor. I catch the gist of it: wide-band transmission versus focused, which way to point. One of them sees me and waves absently, as if I belong here. In another life, I might have. But not now. And not Wallace.\nI pause halfway up the last set of stairs to catch my breath. Someone\u2019s painted in straggling letters: WE REMEMBER WHAT HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN. I can\u2019t carry him out of here; haven\u2019t been able to pick him up since he was six. I could, I suppose, call the authorities and try to have him involuntarily committed, try to have them all committed. Better that than the quiet circle of poisoned bodies. I tell myself that, and know I\u2019m rationalizing whatever unforgivable action I\u2019ll take.\nI can\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s a gift, I suppose, that I can do it without my voice going all to pieces, but it\u2019s noticeable, and the audience\u2019s silence has an embarrassed, horrified quality to it. \u201cIt became clear what was happening soon enough. Even if we denied it. And now we were stuck behind the glass, watching this new civilization, this new contact, these new friends we\u2019d come to study and mimic and love\u2014watching them die.\n\u201cAnd we could do nothing. We weren\u2019t just separated by some metaphorical glass. We were separated by time. Everything that had happened had happened four hundred years ago. Scream and cry and pound on the glass as much as we tried, the Coronals were already dying. Already dead. And we heard every moment of their deaths. The wars. The plagues. The pleas for help that never came. The litanies of the dead.\u201d\nSomeone in the back of the auditorium makes a sound like a sob. I blow my nose, but my eyes are still streaming. \u201cI still remember when one idiot physicist made a comment that, well, at least the Fermi Paradox still held; it\u2019s just that sapient races kill themselves off before they develop space travel. Gallows humor, but he still took quite the hit from that, professionally speaking. But he wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d\nMy son is alive when I see him. He\u2019s also wearing only pajama bottoms, hunched over a keyboard on his lap, typing with one hand and eating cold scrambled eggs off a scratched camp plate with the other. He must have shaved his head not long ago; it\u2019s all bristly now, like when I gave the boys buzz cuts after their brush with head lice in elementary school.\nHis entire back is covered with mandalas, one after another, all the different interpretations of the Coronal descriptions. Burned\u2014branded\u2014on top of them is a hand holding a torch.\nMy step creaks the floorboards, and he waves one hand behind his back, scrambled eggs falling from his fork. \u201cHarris, can you tell Zahra that I\u2019ve almost got the reambiguation figured, if she\u2019ll just give me another week?\u201d\n\u201cWallace,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t even have to take a deep breath to do it.\nHe drops the fork and spins around, kicking aside plate and keyboard alike. He stares at me for a moment, then scrambles upright. He\u2019s not as tall as Randall, never has been, but they\u2019re both taller than me. \u201cMa.\u201d\nI\u2019m too worried to smile. \u201cYes,\u201d I say, and stop. What do I say? I\u2019m here? I found you? Please don\u2019t go, the Coronals aren\u2019t worth it?\nHis shoulders go down, just a little bit. \u201cRandall told you I was here, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cHe did,\u201d I say. \u201cHe worries.\u201d\nWallace shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s what he does.\u201d He bends and sorts through the mess at his feet, finding a shirt with TOUCH THE STARS\u20148TH ANNUAL silkscreened onto it. \u201cI think he thinks we\u2019re some kind of death cult.\u201d\nHe straightens up as he says the last, and he sees my face. \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d I manage, because he\u2019s already seen as much in my expression. \u201cThe mandalas\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe mandalas are important, Ma. That we may remember what has been forgotten.\u201d The last has the sound of catechism, and I can\u2019t help rolling my eyes. He looks up at the ceiling, and I think of far too many Thanksgivings where we talked past each other. This is going to be another one of those fights. \u201cYou seem so determined to forget that you\u2019re willing to let them close the department.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant,\u201d I say, but it\u2019s a sore point, and I take the bait. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not about forgetting.\u201d\n\u201cThen what\u2019s it about? You\u2019re just turning your back on what we have of the Coronals? You\u2019re letting the university\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere are other Coronal Studies departments.\u201d Withering, yes, but holding on in the same way that departments allow specialized study of Ottoman textiles or obscure Scottish poets. \u201cAnd don\u2019t change the subject. My job is my own. This\u2014\u201d I gesture at the mess, \u201c\u2014is, I\u2019m assuming, your new job.\u201d\nHe glares at me, nudges the plate of eggs away with one foot. \u201cYeah. So maybe it is.\u201d I brace for the defense, but he doesn\u2019t bother with it, instead straightening up as if he were giving a presentation. \u201cMa, I need a favor. I need access to Granma\u2019s cloud.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in it. Nothing that isn\u2019t public.\u201d\n\u201cNo, there is. I need the initial signal. The originating one, the one that rewrote her research center, before it went dormant.\u201d\nI think of my mother, of the cancer rewriting her DNA. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s only what you say because you don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to see! There\u2019s nothing to see! You can re-run the translator as many times as you like, and it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMa\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to show you anything new! It\u2019s just going to give you the same old signal, the same things we heard, the same things that aren\u2019t there any more!\u201d Now I\u2019m shouting. Guess it was my turn to start this time. \u201cYou can\u2019t tune it, you can\u2019t adjust it\u2014it\u2019s done, Wallace. It\u2019s done, and maybe your friends here with their mandalas and their slogans, they can screw around with their cosmic bullshit, but you are better than that! I will not let you waste yourself like that!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a waste, Ma!\u201d He puts his hands to his head. \u201cIt\u2019s never a waste! Jesus, why is this so hard to understand?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one there!\u201d The words come out, and I put both hands to my mouth, as if I\u2019ve said something obscene. The argument downstairs has stopped; I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re listening. \u201cNo one,\u201d I repeat. \u201cIt\u2019s all silence now.\u201d\nWallace shakes his head, slowly, the way I would when I was sick of the arguments. His turn, now.\nI make myself stop, make myself draw a new breath. \u201cCould someone shut off the slides? Thank you.\u201d One nervous laugh, somewhere at the front. Everyone else is silent. They don\u2019t like seeing someone cry in public. Nobody does.\nI think about what I want to say, what I\u2019ve said already elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s all silence now,\u201d I say. Somewhere in the auditorium, I\u2019m certain people are shaking their heads, not quite the way Wallace did but with the same determination.\n\u201cThe air is no longer full of voices.\n\u201cOr, rather, not the same voices.\n\u201cThis is the one thing the Coronals did for us that we don\u2019t even think about any more. Every one of you, every one who has bothered to do more than a cursory study of Coronal infospace, is a polyglot. We had to be.\n\u201cThis is the gift they gave us. Not the knowledge that we were not alone. We have never been alone. To understand them, we had to understand each other.\u201d\nWallace shakes his head, slowly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be silent.\u201d\nI\u2019m about to snap at him, to tell him that I have spent my life on the Coronals and if anyone would know silence, it is me. But I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019m just tired from the drive. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other transmissions in infospace,\u201d I finally say. \u201cI know whole arrays that have been searching for anything since before the Coronal collapse. There\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\u201cNot from them. From us.\u201d He nudges the keyboard with his feet. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2014all of us, here, we\u2019re trying to repurpose the original code. So we can send out our own into infospace.\u201d\nIt takes me a moment to realize that he\u2019s not talking about every other attempt to use the code, to strengthen it or tune it or seek out more information, more voices in the static. \u201cYou want to broadcast,\u201d I say slowly.\n\u201cNot quite. We want to repurpose their tool and make it ours, and then broadcast. I mean, they\u2019re dead, and we signed on much too late, but if we\u2014if there\u2019s someone else out there too, maybe they can hear us.\u201d\nI stand very still for a long moment. Below us, I hear the Urdu argument start up again, not nearly so vehement now. \u201cHave you thought about the entity extraction issue?\u201d I say finally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as much of a problem as you might think. Here, take a look.\u201d He picks up the keyboard, pulls down a screen, and code fills the air. \u201cThe original signal was expansive-reductive, taking one set and expanding it to many. We think if we can train it another way, it can work with many sets at once, so we don\u2019t have to restrict our infospace broadcasts to one language. It\u2019s semisapient, so it really is like training, but the base code . . . \u201d\nHe goes off, and I think about my mother staring at her own lines of code, convinced it was all a hoax but one she\u2019d go along with for now. It\u2019s opaque to me, but Wallace swims in it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting close\u2014well, closer. Beatriz thinks we have only ten years to go, instead of twenty. But if we had Granma\u2019s records, it\u2019d give us a clearer idea of how the signal is supposed to behave when it\u2019s active, instead of its dormant state, which is all we have to work with now. It\u2019s only a, a receiver. We need to make it a transmitter again. A whole technician, if we train it right.\u201d\nHe looks alight, the same way Randall does when he\u2019s with Brendan. I step back. \u201cI\u2019ll deed you the cloud access,\u201d I say. For a moment I consider inviting him to drive back with me, but eight hours in the car are pretty much guaranteed to destroy any d\u00e9tente we currently have. \u201cLet me know if you need anything else.\u201d\nWallace stops abruptly, as if he\u2019s just remembered who he\u2019s talking to. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go.\u201d\nI smile at him. \u201cDid Randall tell you what I\u2019m doing, now that the department\u2019s closing down? I\u2019m going back to school. For a fine arts degree. Poetry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s . . . not what I would have expected.\u201d He stops, takes a deep breath, lets it out. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to speak to the other half of the audience now. Those of you who grew up in a world where we knew for a fact we were not alone.\u201d\nRandall, Brendan, and their girls. Abrams and Lucienne from the department, Sadako who is our last Ph.D. student and has still soldiered on, Martinez with the giant paintings, and Park with the Opera based on Coronal texts. All the ones who passed through my hands, who went on, who continue on without me.\nWallace, my Wallace, so sad and determined. I am so proud of you, of all of you.\n\u201cYou have never known a world in which Earth held the only life in the universe. Everywhere, you have heard the voices of a world far away. Now you have to hear the nearer voices. I want you to hold on to that knowledge, that certainty that we are not alone. We have never been alone.\n\u201cWe will never be.\u201d\nI step down, out of the light. My glass vibrates, and I check it to see a set of messages turn up.\nW: good speech ma randy sent me the flow\nR: did not. the girls got to listen. Sinny drew a new picture for you.\nW: i have some old antholgies if you need textbks\nIt\u2019s a start. I lower my glass and let the organizers walk me back out on stage."}

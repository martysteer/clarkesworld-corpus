I could think of quick responses to several of them, but when I came across this one, it spoke to me.\n For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been a science fiction fan: early on through TV\u2014Lost in Space and yes, I\u2019m enjoying the reboot\u2014and later through books, film, and games. Overall, it\u2019s been a very positive force in my life and an escape when I needed it the most, everything from being bullied for years as a child to dealing with a brush with death as an adult. The community surrounding it all, well, that\u2019s been a more complicated relationship.\n I didn\u2019t even know fandom existed until college. Before then, I only knew one or two people that even admitted to reading the same things I did. The more aware among my college friends organized a group trip to a local convention. I think there were seven or eight of us crammed into that hotel room\u2014a situation that would normally have put me on edge\u2014but I had a great time. I saw some of my favorite authors, found books I had been searching for for years, and was impressed that there were so many of us. I continued to go for a while after graduation, but it wasn\u2019t the same without my friends and I didn\u2019t feel particularly welcome without them. Disillusioned, I stopped going to conventions for nearly ten years.\n Despite this, my enjoyment of SF/F was never undermined. I had the advantage of feeling included in SF/F works from the very beginning. I could completely relate to Lost in Space\u2019s Will Robinson and wanted very much to have a robot friend like he did. The characters in stories, books, games, etc. that shaped my connection to the genre for the first fifteen years mostly looked like me: white, male, with similar values and cultural references\u2014even if those values and cultures were challenged. I even have the same last name\u2014but not even a distant relation\u2014to one of the biggest names in history of the genre. I can see how it might be different for someone who didn\u2019t often, or ever, see themselves in the works they were exposed to.\n I then graduated from college with a degree in computer science and ultimately ended up working in higher education, where I had to play at being a futurist. It\u2019s easy for me to connect the dots between my science fiction reading and the way I embraced that career. On the side, I started a small online science fiction bookstore and inadvertently began making new friends in the community from all over the country and even beyond. Eventually, I was convinced to give conventions another try. It seemed better than before, so I stuck around, but that uneasiness has always remained in the back of my mind. As the bookstore faded and the magazine rose, I earned something of a standing in the community, which means that people treat me differently than before. That uneasiness, however, has led to an awareness.\n But what does all this have to do with the original tweet?\n Science fiction has been very good to me on so many different levels. Why wouldn\u2019t I want that for everyone else? This sentiment and the awareness I mentioned come with a responsibility to not be like those that made me feel unwelcome. It might be as simple as opening a circle\u2014it\u2019s common for a circle of people to form at conventions\u2014and making room for a stranger to join in the conversation or holding the elevator door. The more socially-outgoing might even notice the stragglers at the edge of a party and engaging with them. (Admittedly, this has never been a strong suit of mine.) Casting the net beyond the local, it might mean writing an editorial about your own history or answering a question (politely) on social media, email, or a forum. It might even be as simple as supporting something like John Picacio\u2019s MexicanX initiative to help bring MexicanX authors/artists/fans to the 2018 Worldcon. Little things add up.\n As an editor, the responsibility extends to making sure that people know they are more than welcome to submit stories and that they will always have a fair shot at being published here. It\u2019s not always obvious how to do that or even when that work is needed, but as that tweet indicates, it is. Cover letters and submissions don\u2019t often include demographic information, so sometimes you have to count on some common sense or the nudge from a third party. Some editors don\u2019t take kindly to being nudged and some people don\u2019t know how to nudge gently, but I have no control over those people. I need to focus on keeping my own house in order and if I end up with the best stories by keeping that door open, you can be sure that others will follow.\n And from experience, I can say that a lot of people feel left out or underrepresented, particularly in what gets published. There are benefits to breaking that pattern though. Our efforts in translation, for example, have always been met with a sustained increase in readers and submissions from regions represented by a story we\u2019ve published. I\u2019m sure the same goes for other communities as well, it\u2019s just harder to confirm. It does say that they feel a bit more welcome, which is a good thing.\n A sad truth, however, in all this is that one cannot simply say they are open to everyone and expect that to be sufficient to change things. You can\u2019t even say, \u201chey we\u2019d love more submissions from LatinX and/or queer authors\u201d (and this is very much true) and not have to follow it up with \u201cand everyone else is still welcome too\u201d because some will wrongly assume your statement indicates favoritism. I\u2019ve heard this one a lot as I\u2019ve targeted increasing our international submissions, which has, I\u2019ll point out, resulted in an increase in the number of foreign writers in our pages. No special treatment for the stories, just an encouragement to submit. In the end, they earned their place against all the rest. Oh and I know some will say, \u201cbut that is not enough.\u201d Maybe it isn\u2019t, but it is progress. At times, it can feel like no one is allowed to have nice things, so I\u2019ll gladly take each small victory and keep moving forward.\n Simply put, to find the best stories, you have to cast the widest possible net and sometimes that requires outreach\u2014behind the scenes or from a soapbox. The job is never done. You never know where the next great story or writer will come from. No one group has a monopoly on quality. Why would I want to limit my options to people just like me? Why wouldn\u2019t I want those writers, stories, and readers to not have a home in Clarkesworld or even in the broader community? And why wouldn\u2019t I want everyone to have the same opportunities and enjoyment I\u2019ve had?\n Or, as my trusted robot friend says, \u201cDoes not compute!\u201d\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

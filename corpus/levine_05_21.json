The left ear was tattooed with a constellation of dots that identified it uniquely from all its siblings and cousins. A small nick in its tail showed where I\u2019d taken a tissue sample soon after it had been born. The fact that it was alive today, a fully grown thirty-one-gram adult, showed that it had passed that test: it carried a modification in CHRNB2, the cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 2 subunit gene, which we hoped would positively affect its ability to socialize with and learn from its peers.\nThe mouse looked at me. I looked back.\nIt clutched a shiny blue marble in its front paws.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise that the mouse was floating peacefully in midair. Mice adapt quite well to zero gravity, and this particular mouse had been bred, born, and raised here on Lasky Station, as had generations of its forebears. Foremice. Predecessors.\nAs for myself, I floated on my side of the glass with my hands folded behind my back, my face carefully neutral. Not that it mattered directly, given that I was wearing a surgical mask, goggles, and face shield, but we\u2019d all learned as undergrads that controlling your expression is a quick shortcut to controlling your body language and pheromones, and you do not want to influence your lab subjects in any way.\nBut I really, really, wanted it to put the marble in the black ring.\nThis particular mouse had never before been presented with a blue marble in an experimental setting. One of its peers had, yesterday, been trained to place a blue marble in a black ring in exchange for a reward. (Mice are red-green colorblind, but they can distinguish yellow and blue, and can tell light from dark.) After demonstrating its command of the task, that mouse had been placed back in the colony. Cameras had captured its interactions with the other mice and now, twenty-four hours later, I had snagged this particular mouse\u2014one with which the first test subject had interacted repeatedly\u2014and presented it with a blue marble and the standard array of five colored rings to which they were all accustomed.\nMice don\u2019t talk. They are extremely social; they groom, they wrestle, they snuggle . . . they even sing to one another, after a fashion, in voices too high for people to hear. But unmodified mice have never been shown to teach this sort of complex learned behavior to their offspring or peers. Bees, on the other hand, do something similar all the time, despite their minuscule brains. Could this gene modification, just a few molecules affecting the temporal lobe, result in a significant change in social behavior?\nThe mouse\u2019s whiskers twitched. Then, with a flick of its tail, it propelled itself forward and plunked the marble into the ring like a champion basketball player.\nThe white ring.\nNo treat for you, mousie.\nI repeated the trial four more times, as the experimental protocol dictated, and the mouse got the black ring once. No better than chance. \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered as I gently retrieved it from the experimental enclosure and returned it to the colony, \u201cyou have to repeat a grade.\u201d\nI checked that the experiment had been properly video-recorded, logged the results, then started looking for my next subject. White mice all look alike, but the cameras in the colony could at least read their ear codes and point out the candidates\u2014mice that had repeatedly interacted with the first test subject\u2014on the screen for me. But I still had to catch them by hand.\nHave I mentioned that mice function quite well in zero gravity?\nI was sipping a bulb of coffee in the break room when Samantha Clarke, my friendly local neighborhood maintenance tech, drifted in. \u201cHey, Sam,\u201d I said.\n\u201cHey, Chelle.\u201d (Only my mother calls me Michelle, and Sam and I were familiar enough that she didn\u2019t have to call me Dr. Yan.) She sniffed theatrically. \u201cNot too bad today.\u201d\nI gave her a middle-finger salute. She maintains that I always smell of mouse pee. I . . . wish I could disagree. I keep as clean as I can, considering my department\u2019s limited water budget. Most of which goes to the mice.\nLasky Station is thirty-five years old. That\u2019s, like, two hundred and fifty in people years. It was sent up by the Portuguese during the Second Space Rush, and when it was retired after many years of service it was purchased and donated to Grinnell University by billionaire alumnus Leslie Lasky. That\u2019s why it\u2019s named after him. Unfortunately, he cheaped out on the operating endowment, leaving us the underdogs in the never-ending battle against the forces of entropy.\nStill, we\u2019re lucky to have a station of our own. Not many small universities do. Among other things, it means that we can still do genetic research on animals, which is prohibited in most places on Earth\u2019s surface because of the risk of modified test subjects escaping.\nWhich is not to say the mice never get out. They do. They just can\u2019t escape to anywhere they could crossbreed with wild types and possibly cause all kinds of havoc.\n(Unless one escapes the lab and manages to make it to a shuttle and then escapes the shuttle facility after landing. Which has never happened to me, thank god, but it happened to a friend of mine at another institution. Would have lost their certification forever if anyone had found out.)\n\u201cCatch any elves lately?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNah. And I\u2019ve tried everything for bait. Peanut butter, chocolate, even toothpaste.\u201d\n\u201cToothpaste?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cI figure even elves like to freshen up after a snack.\u201d\nSam and I have been ribbing each other all term about the \u201celves,\u201d who she claims live in the walls and fix things if you leave out little treats for them. I don\u2019t think she actually believes in them, despite her unwavering nominal support of the idea, but, as she says, there must be something keeping this ramshackle old station from disintegrating into a cloud of free-floating parts. It certainly isn\u2019t stable funding and scrupulous maintenance.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have these problems,\u201d Sam continued, \u201cif you could just keep your test subjects from going walkabout.\u201d\nSam has, of course, frequently proposed that the elves\u2014for which she has never presented the slightest bit of hard evidence\u2014might be escaped, superintelligent mice from my lab. \u201cYes, they are modified,\u201d I said, just like I do every time something like this comes up, \u201cbut they are still just mice. They have literally one-tenth of one percent the number of neurons that we do.\u201d\n\u201cSpiders have even fewer neurons,\u201d Sam replied, \u201cand yet they are mighty hunters. Almost as good as cats.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you read that?\u201d I countered, surprised.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you kept up with your field, doctor?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t read everything,\u201d I muttered, making a note to look that up later.\nIn the afternoon I did maintenance work on the colony. The mice lived better than I did, frankly. They were provided with food, water, clean bedding, spaces for both privacy and socialization, and lots of enrichment activities, and they didn\u2019t even need to do their own laundry. They were free to go wherever they wished within the colony and do whatever they wanted, and the population was carefully controlled so they were never overcrowded or isolated. And there were plenty of colored marbles and rings scattered about so they could practice what they\u2019d learned in the experimental enclosure . . . and hopefully share it with their friends. Apart from the complete lack of privacy and the inability to leave, it was basically Mouse Utopia. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to go outside anyway,\u201d I told one mouse as it made a break for the door. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very cold out there.\u201d\nI always counted the mice in the main space before I exited the colony, to make sure none of them slipped out the double door with me. They were fast and adroit, and in the early days occasionally one would make it past the first door. But I\u2019d learned their tricks and it had been a long time since one got even that far.\nYet still they went missing. The cameras were omnipresent and their census was automated and very thorough; there was no doubt that eighteen mice had somehow managed to vanish from their enclosure in this term alone. I even knew exactly which mice they were, by their ear tags. But though I had studied the recordings and even tracked the individual mice right up to the hour of their disappearance, I hadn\u2019t been able to figure out how they were escaping.\nThis was tremendously annoying to me.\nThe whole point of running a mouse lab in space\u2014the reason we put up with the dehydrated food and the constant noise and the loss of muscle and bone mass and, oh yeah, the ever-present threat of sudden death from equipment failure\u2014is to keep the mice from getting away. And, yes, I could be fairly confident they hadn\u2019t gotten back to Earth, which was the primary rationale . . . and there was the view and the zero-G sex, which are both as great as you\u2019ve heard. But it was still worrisome that, despite everything, I\u2019d managed to lose track of eighteen of the little buggers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the smell that bothers me,\u201d I complained to my department chair, Dr. Prentis, on our weekly call.\n\u201cYou should be used to it by now,\u201d she said. Her face was streaked with glitches and there was a noticeable lag. We must be on the other side of the world from Iowa at the moment.\n\u201cSorry, I meant the lack of smell. If they were getting out of the colony and dying in the walls somewhere, we\u2019d smell the decomposition. Or, if they actually found a way to survive, we\u2019d smell their leavings eventually. But no one has mentioned it. And, believe me, if anyone on this station smelled anything even vaguely mouselike outside of my lab I would never hear the end of it.\u201d I blew out a frustrated breath through my nose. \u201cThey aren\u2019t in the colony. So where are they?\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s my best guess. They are making it to an airlock and getting blown out the next time it opens.\u201d\nI nodded. There were numerous small airlocks for service, maintenance, and disposal, as well as the main cargo and personnel locks, and they might seem an attractive place for an escaped mouse to settle down. For a while. \u201cPossible. But all of them?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cAs long as they aren\u2019t damaging the station or escaping to Earth, and as long as you record the losses in your logs, I consider this a low priority. Now let\u2019s talk about those error bars.\u201d\nAnother day, another experiment. This was run one hundred twenty-eight, phase A, which meant that I was training a mouse to put a marble in a ring. This part of the experiment was more immediately satisfying, because the mice and I both knew how to do it. It was just a matter of repeating the behavior and the reward until the mouse could perform the behavior reliably. But it was also boring, and Not Science, because the results were so well understood. Phase B\u2014the part that so often didn\u2019t work the way we hoped it would\u2014was more interesting, and Definitely Science, but also the most frustrating. It wouldn\u2019t be until I\u2019d collected all the data and returned to Earth with it that we would know whether or not we had done something worth publishing.\nIt wasn\u2019t looking great so far. The phase B mice seemed to be doing a bit better than chance, but we wouldn\u2019t know until we\u2019d crunched all the numbers, controlling for things like age and sex and the presence of certain other genes, whether the difference was statistically significant. If it wasn\u2019t significant, that implied that our whole theory about the function of the superior temporal sulcus in social communication and learning was a bust, at least in the mouse model. Of course, a negative result is still a result . . . but they don\u2019t give Nobel Prizes for negative results.\nOne thing I had noticed\u2014anecdotal evidence, I suppose, though can something be anecdotal if you haven\u2019t told anyone else about it?\u2014was that certain phase A mice seemed to be much better teachers than others. Or just lucky. At this point it was impossible to be sure.\n\u201cTell me about your friends,\u201d I said to the mouse I\u2019d just caught as I carried it to the experimental enclosure. \u201cAre you close? Do you like to do things together? Will they be excited to hear about what you learned on your vacation? Will there be slides?\u201d I placed the mouse inside and closed the door. It quickly oriented itself to its new environment and looked back at me through the scratched, transparent plastic. Its nose wiggled adorably. \u201cI hope you are an engaging speaker. And for god\u2019s sake don\u2019t read every word on every slide.\u201d\nWe watched each other for a while, the mouse\u2019s red eyes meeting mine unblinkingly. What was it feeling? Terrified of this giant, incomprehensible creature? Eagerly looking forward to a new adventure, and maybe a treat? Bored? Horny? Planning escape?\nWas it wondering the same things about me?\nThe computer had randomly selected a marble color and ring color, and all the mice had been exposed to the experimental setup before, so it wasn\u2019t long before the mouse found the marble and put it into one of the colored rings. Wrong ring, mousie . . . no donut. A soft buzzer sounded and the marble vanished into the mechanism, replaced by another one of the same color.\nThe mouse wasn\u2019t discouraged; it kept trying, and it wasn\u2019t long before it happened to hit upon the correct ring. A light flashed, a beeper beeped, and a pellet emerged from the dispenser, which the mouse immediately pounced upon and devoured. The mechanism then produced a marble of a different color. This part wasn\u2019t as much fun . . . no matter which ring the mouse selected, the marble would disappear with no sound at all and certainly no treat. Life isn\u2019t fair.\nWe played this thrilling game for an hour, with me carefully selecting the color of the next marble to optimally reinforce the desired behavior and the mouse catching on quickly. Good for you, mousie. When we reached the point that, when presented with two marbles of different colors, the mouse selected the correct marble and placed it in the correct ring five trials in a row, I declared victory and pulled out. I delicately scratched the champion\u2019s ears and gave it a little smooch on the head\u2014though with my mask and face shield, it was more of an air-kiss\u2014before sending it back into the colony to preach the gospel to all creation.\nAnd then I heard a bang.\nThat wasn\u2019t good.\nEveryone knows that there is no sound in space. Everyone is wrong; space is loud. At least, the inside of a space station is. Fans whir, plumbing gurgles, structures creak, a thousand electronic things bleep and burble. Almost everyone has difficulty sleeping. But a bang, especially a sharp metallic bang like this one, is very uncommon and is never good news. Could be an explosion; could be an overstressed structural member giving way; could be a meteoroid strike.\nA moment later a klaxon began sounding. Air pressure drop.\nThat really wasn\u2019t good.\n\u201cOkay, here\u2019s what we know.\u201d\nWe were gathered in the main dining hall in module C, all sixty-three of us, peering past each other\u2019s shoulders, many in the corridors outside straining to hear. Dr. Ivanovic, the station administrator, looked even more worried than usual.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a micrometeoroid strike,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in module A. But we don\u2019t know where.\u201d\nA sound combining a groan and a sigh came from the assembled crowd. A groan because it was bad news, and a sigh because this was typical for Lasky Station.\nLasky was an old-fashioned design, with module A\u2014the oldest and largest of the station\u2019s eight modules\u2014as the central spine to which all of the others attached. It couldn\u2019t be subdivided, and if it lost pressure, the station as a whole would be unusable. There had been talk for years of upgrading the station to a more modern, robust design, but that would require money we didn\u2019t have.\nThis is what happens when a small liberal-arts school has its own space program, I guess.\n\u201cWe are losing atmosphere, albeit slowly.\u201d More groans. She patted the air with her hands, signaling for calm. \u201cWe have people working the issue. Inside, there\u2019s a lot of equipment that has to be moved. Outside, drones have failed to spot the impact point as of yet.\u201d The outside of the station, I knew, was just as much of a mess of accreted junk as the inside. Even worse, perhaps, because obsolete and unused equipment on the station\u2019s outer hull wasn\u2019t in anyone\u2019s way, so it tended to just stay where it was. And then something else got bolted to it, so now there was even more reason to leave it in place. Et cetera ad infinitum.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the ETA for a fix?\u201d came a voice from the back of the crowd.\nDr. Ivanovic sighed and shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t have one yet. But if we don\u2019t manage to find the leak in . . . ?\u201d She shot an inquisitive glance off to the side. Her face showed she didn\u2019t like what she got in response. \u201c . . . twenty-one hours, we\u2019ll have to begin evacuation procedures.\u201d\nThe crowd got really ugly then, with people shouting \u201cI can\u2019t possibly . . . !\u201d and \u201cWhat do you mean . . . !\u201d and \u201cWhat kind of . . . !\u201d and no amount of air-patting would bring it under control. I was one of the ones shouting, I must admit.\nDr. Kwok, head of Facilities, finally screamed loud enough to be heard over the pandemonium. \u201cStop behaving like academics!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about who took the last donut in the break room! This is life and death!\u201d\nThat shut us up.\n\u201cTwenty-one hours,\u201d Dr. Ivanovic repeated into the embarrassed silence. \u201cIf anyone from the repair crew asks for your help, make that your top priority. Otherwise . . . use that time to get ready to evacuate.\u201d As we muttered and jostled our way out of the lab, she called out, \u201cAnd remember: two kilos each, max. No exceptions. Anything that can be replaced, no matter how expensive\u2014leave it here.\u201d\nI stopped dead in the corridor, not really hearing the annoyed exclamations of the people bunching up behind me.\nMy mice. My unique, purebred, genetically modified, carefully trained mice.\nShit.\nI wasted an entire precious hour arguing with the administration, both locally and back in Iowa, but there was no possibility of a reprieve. There were only two shuttles, and they had only so much capacity. Not to mention that my mice were illegal on Earth, which I\u2019d managed to forget in the initial moment of panic.\nSo if we had to evacuate\u2014and by the end of the hour nothing had changed on that score\u2014the mice would have to stay behind. All of them. And even if I didn\u2019t euthanize them before leaving, which I wasn\u2019t yet ready to consider, given that we were evacuating because of an air leak, they would likely die before the station could be repaired and reinhabited. Assuming we didn\u2019t just decommission it, which given our finances was the more likely outcome.\nI floated in the middle of my lab, face in my hands, gently bumping into walls, trying to control my breathing. Filled with anger and regret and . . . and grief. Grief for the project, certainly, for the years of work that would be lost, but also grief for the mice. The innocent lives that would be snuffed out.\nYes, okay, I had culled a lot of mice in my time. Every pup that wasn\u2019t genetically correct, every juvenile that fought with its peers, every adult that got sick or injured in a way that couldn\u2019t be easily corrected. Gently, painlessly, respectfully, but still culled. Killed. But most of my mice lived out full lives, well cared for and, I hope, provided with a pleasant and interesting environment. And their lives had purpose! They served the advancement of human knowledge. But if they all died now . . . those lives, and the lives of their predecessors, would simply be wasted. We didn\u2019t even have enough results yet to be statistically significant, and when we resumed the experiment\u2014if we even did\u2014we\u2019d have to start from scratch.\nI had been given a lightweight plastic box for my two-kilo allowance. I began filling it with data bricks, tissue samples, vials of crystallized DNA. It didn\u2019t seem like much, for all those years of work, but it filled the box surprisingly quickly.\nAs I worked I dislodged a yellow marble\u2014the damn things got everywhere\u2014and absentmindedly caught it before it could get away and cause trouble. The stupid little things were like Barbie shoes, omnipresent, always getting caught in some mechanism or clogging an air vent.\nThen I stopped and looked at it.\nHeld it between my fingers.\nLooked at the tidy array of five rings in the experimental enclosure.\nAnd went off in search of the nearest emergency equipment locker.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said to the mouse, \u201cthis is a micrometeoroid repair patch.\u201d\nThe mouse just stared at me.\nI\u2019d picked the best mouse for the job. I hoped. Its ID number was 23070418\u2014born on the Fourth of July, hooray\u2014and according to a quick crunch of the experimental results it was the best of my \u201csuperteachers.\u201d Or, as I said before, just very lucky. At this point I didn\u2019t care which, as long as past performance was indicative of future results.\nI tried not to think about the fact that that phrase usually appears in the negative.\nI\u2019d made some modifications to the experimental enclosure. I\u2019d removed the marble dispenser, leaving an opening into the enclosure, and added to the five rings a crudely hacked hole, which was glued to a tube, which was taped to a hose, which led to a vacuum cleaner in the next room. (Yes we use vacuum cleaners in space, and yes I have heard all the jokes.) The cleaner was not yet running. That would come later.\nWhat I was about to ask this mouse to do was certainly outside its experience and very likely beyond its capacity. But I had to try.\nI pushed the patch through the hole. The mouse first skittered away, then approached it hesitantly. I had lightly smeared the patch with peanut butter, to make it attractive and to mask the smell of the chemicals within.\nAt first the mouse simply sniffed at the patch\u2014a two-centimeter circle of tough fabric with a bulge in the center. Then it licked at the peanut oil.\nI held my breath.\nIt delicately nibbled at the patch.\nGood mousie! I pushed the reward button. Beep, flash, treat. The mouse abandoned the patch and went off for the treat, as I\u2019d known it would, but it was a start. I retrieved the patch and prepared another one.\nYou\u2019ve probably seen videos of squirrels running through amazing obstacle courses of anti-squirrel measures in order to get food from a bird feeder. This generally happens because the bird feeder owner, deliberately or accidentally, set up the obstacles one by one as the squirrel learned to overcome them. And that was what I was trying to do right now: to inculcate a series of arbitrary tasks in order to achieve a reward. Except the tasks were not arbitrary and the ultimate reward was not a treat, it was life.\nI would most likely only have time to do this once. At most. I had to hope that would be enough.\nI ran through an entire box of patches and had to steal another one from another equipment locker. What I was doing was a violation of safety standards and several codes of honor and ethics, but lives were at stake.\nOkay, they were only mouse lives. But they were lives nonetheless, and my career and the careers of my colleagues back in Iowa were also in jeopardy. I kept working, ignoring the noise of everyone else running around getting ready to evacuate and listening to the increasingly anxious announcements on the public address system with only half an ear.\nI did hope that my work would not be needed\u2014that some human being would find the hole and patch it before it was too late. But what I was hearing made that sound increasingly unlikely.\nI reached into the box for another patch, and cursed as my fingers found it empty. But I felt I was getting close; I went and found another box. On my way back, I ran into Sam.\n\u201cWhat are you doing with those patches?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you find the leak?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d I temporized, trying to push past her.\n\u201cBut if you even think you\u2019ve narrowed it down\u2014you have to let Dr. Kwok know right away!\u201d She kept blocking my way, and she was better at free-fall maneuvering than I was.\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . I\u2019m just working a hunch, okay?\u201d\n\u201cBut we might need those patches!\u201d\nThen I saw an opening and leaped, pushing off the wall behind me and shooting past Sam. \u201cI\u2019m going to give them to the elves!\u201d I called as I passed.\nI hoped that she\u2019d be too busy with evacuation prep to follow me. And, indeed, she didn\u2019t. But this encounter reminded me that my time was extremely limited.\nI had finished up the third box of patches and had just started on a fourth when we had a breakthrough. The mouse caught the patch as soon as I pushed it through the hole, then began nibbling at the edge of the paper covering the adhesive. This wasn\u2019t an easy task, but with teeth and busy little paws it managed to pull the paper away, exposing the adhesive, without getting its nose or whiskers stuck. Then, with a neat little push of its back legs, it propelled itself toward the hissing hole where the tube from the vacuum cleaner\u2014now running\u2014was attached.\nNow came the part that it had failed in the last few tries. I held my breath.\nFor a moment the mouse, clearly hesitant of the noise and moving air, held back. Then it moved toward the hole, holding out the patch . . . the wrong way up. Again. I let out my held breath as a sigh and began preparing the next patch.\nBut at the last moment the mouse turned the patch over and released it. The vacuum pulled the patch onto the hole, sticky side down, forming a tidy seal.\nThen the mouse, I swear, turned and looked me right in the eye.\nI looked back at it, stunned.\nI mashed the reward button. Beep, flash, treat.\nI reset the experiment as the mouse was enjoying its reward\u2014the adhesive took a little time to set, fortunately\u2014and tried it again. Okay, mousie, you wowed \u2019em at the matinee. But are you ready for the main event?\nIt was. It nailed the task. And a third time, and a fourth, and a fifth.\nI hammered the reward button. A cascade of beeps, flashes, and treats gushed into the enclosure, which the mouse immediately snagged from the air and devoured.\nCongratulations, mousie, you\u2019re a star!\nI retrieved the star from the experimental enclosure, giving it a gentle scritch behind the ears\u2014its eyes closed in pleasure\u2014and released it into the colony, along with the remaining contents of the fourth box of patches. \u201cI\u2019m sorry the career of a prima ballerina is so short,\u201d I told it as I closed the door. \u201cBut now you retire to what I deeply hope is a successful second career as a teacher.\u201d\nI took in a breath, let it out. It\u2019s all up to you now, mousie.\nI checked my watch. Thirteen hours left. Not as much as I\u2019d hoped, more than I\u2019d feared. More than I\u2019d had any reason to expect, frankly\u2014this mouse was a freaking genius. I had to hope it was a genius teacher as well, because I could only allow it . . . let\u2019s say six or seven hours to pass along what it had learned, before I started moving the students into module A. I figured I could smuggle at least a dozen of them at a time in a carrier under my lab coat.\nAnd then there came a knock on the door.\n\u201cDr. Ivanovic!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat a . . . what a pleasure.\u201d This was, I was pretty sure, the first time the director of the whole station had come to visit my lab. And alone, to boot. She entered without a word and closed the door behind herself. She seemed troubled\u2014not meeting my eyes\u2014and I was sure she was about to give me some bad news.\n\u201cI was a mouse handler myself, in my grad student days,\u201d she said by way of introduction. This wasn\u2019t something I had known. \u201cSo I understand the . . . concern you must feel for your charges.\u201d\nI nodded, not trusting myself to say anything. Sam must have gone straight to the top with the news that I was stealing repair patches. I was in serious trouble.\nNow she did meet my eyes. \u201cNow you have to promise to keep this news to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d I said, my guts in an uproar. Bad news for sure, but maybe not the news I\u2019d been expecting?\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no progress in finding the leak. I\u2019ve been told that the chances of avoiding evacuation are extremely slim.\u201d She reached out for my hands, and I numbly accepted her grasp. \u201cIt is time to begin the . . . the unfortunate but necessary task of euthanizing your animals.\u201d\nMy eyes darted involuntarily to the colony. There was no sign of my genius teacher. I hoped it was already inside, conducting the introductory lecture. \u201cI . . . I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nDr. Ivanovic squeezed my hands, gave me a motherly look. \u201cI understand how you must be feeling, Dr. Yan. But it\u2019s better that they die by your hand\u2014a quiet, respectful death\u2014than to suffocate as the air runs out.\u201d\n\u201cI hope we can avoid both of those.\u201d But I couldn\u2019t possibly tell her why I had that hope. Frankly, it was an insane plan\u2014barely deserving of the name \u201cplan\u201d at all\u2014and almost certain to fail. But if I had to euthanize the mice . . . there went even that tiny sliver of hope.\nShe squeezed my hands again. \u201cThere is a time for hope, Dr. Yan, and a time for realism. We are scientists. We understand that facts are facts. That means accepting that sometimes a theory doesn\u2019t bear out . . . sometimes an experiment fails. And when that happens, we cut our losses and move on to the next thing.\u201d\nI could have given this speech to one of my own undergrads. In fact, I think I did, just last term. But that didn\u2019t make it any easier to hear. I pulled my hands free of hers. \u201cI . . . I need some time to prepare.\u201d\nShe sighed, as though disappointed. \u201cAll right. But don\u2019t take too long about it, okay?\u201d She turned to leave, then paused. \u201cWould you rather have someone else do it? I can send one of my grad students.\u201d\n\u201cNo! I, I mean, ah, no thank you. I . . . I need to do this myself.\u201d\n\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll check back in a bit and see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nShit. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. This is a hard time for all of us.\u201d\nI closed the door behind her. It was just a partition door, not an airtight hatch. It didn\u2019t even have a lock. And barricading a door in free fall? Not really a thing. I couldn\u2019t exactly push a heavy cabinet up against it.\nI needed to give the mice time. Time to learn, time to make their way to module A, time to find and fix the hole.\nI thought about welding the door shut. I had a soldering iron, but no welding torch. I thought about putting up a biohazard sign. \u201cMouse plague!\u201d I\u2019d moan weakly. \u201cSave yourselves!\u201d But they wouldn\u2019t believe me. Or else they would believe me and leave me behind, which given my own assessment of the plan\u2019s chance of success didn\u2019t seem like a great outcome either.\nThis was a matter of survival. And there\u2019s nothing better at surviving than mice. They\u2019ve made it through millions of years of evolution despite the fact that everything wants to eat them.\nSo. Think like a mouse.\nThere\u2019s a lot of random stuff in a bio lab. I set to work.\nIt was about an hour and a half later that my pocket comm trilled. It was Dr. Ivanovic, of course. I ignored it and kept working. A few more calls and then came a text message: \u201cOPEN THE DOOR.\u201d\n\u201cOpen it yourself,\u201d I texted back, and kept working.\nI was surprised that it took nearly another hour before the crash of the outer lab door opening came to my ears. I guess she thought I might come to my senses if she waited? Or maybe the glue I\u2019d used had been more of an impediment than I\u2019d expected.\nAfter the crash came a tearing sound, followed by cursing. A few minutes later another tearing sound, then more vehement cursing. And again. Then a pause. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny!\u201d Dr. Ivanovic yelled. I could barely hear her, and didn\u2019t bother trying to reply.\nIt wasn\u2019t intended to be funny. It was intended to be annoying and time-consuming. I\u2019d glued ten sheets of tough plastic across the width of the outer lab at half-meter intervals. Even with a sharp knife it would take her some time to cut through them all.\nI kept working.\nGiven time a mouse, or a squirrel, will overcome any number of obstacles to obtain a reward. But if you present those obstacles one at a time, the subject will tackle them one at a time rather than stopping, thinking, and finding another way around. They are, in some ways, no smarter than administrators.\nThe tearing and cursing stopped for a while. Then I heard new voices, and a buzzing whir. Sounded like she\u2019d come back with help, and they\u2019d brought a hot cutter, or maybe something even more destructive.\nI\u2019d anticipated this. But they made much quicker progress than I\u2019d hoped, the sounds getting louder and louder as one plastic sheet after another gave way. I checked my watch and redoubled my efforts. I\u2019d bought the mice nearly three hours already. Four, I thought, was the minimum; five would be better; every minute after that would be gravy.\nThe buzzing whir got louder still, then stopped. \u201cWhat the actual fuck?\u201d came an unfamiliar voice.\nI smiled.\nThe space between the last plastic sheet and the inner lab door was filled with polymeric polyol\u2014a tough, sticky foam resulting from a reaction between two common organic chemicals. It was a trick I\u2019d learned as an undergrad\u2014I\u2019d been the victim of a nasty chem lab prank, and had learned the formula in revenge\u2014and it was messy, stinky stuff, which stuck to skin and had a tendency to clog up anything you used to try to cut it.\nAfter a period of muttering and shouted threats, accompanied by a fusillade of ignored signals on my comm, the buzzing whir started up again. A moment later there came a zownt sound and a gurgle, and a god-awful stink I could even smell in here. It must be ten times worse out there. The sound of the cutter stopped, replaced by rapidly diminishing coughing and gagging.\nThat tube full of butyric acid was just one of the surprises I\u2019d embedded in the foam as an enrichment activity for my adversaries. It\u2019s important to keep your test subjects\u2019 minds active and engaged.\nI kept working.\nBy the time they made it through the foam and I could hear them hammering at the lab door, which I had simply wedged shut, I had nearly completed my to-do list.\nI had cut numerous holes in the walls, leading to the air ducts, the spaces between walls, and the space between the inner and outer hull. Check.\nI had dumped two boxes of repair patches into those spaces, using a blower to move them as far in as possible. Check.\nAnd I had gently carried the mice, in groups of three or four, out of their colony and released them into those holes.\nEvery single mouse.\nCheck!\nI felt accomplished. I\u2019d managed to save all the mice from euthanasia\u2014for the moment, at least\u2014and stolen between four and a half and five and a half hours for their training. Using the cameras in the colony, I\u2019d snagged and released the ones who had had the most and earliest contact with my superteacher first, leaving the less enthusiastic students in place for makeup classes. But now, with\u2014I checked my watch\u2014six hours left before we were to begin evacuating, they had all at least had an opportunity to be trained, and now were free, with what I sincerely hoped would be sufficient time and resources for at least some of them to make their way to module A, find the leak, and fix it, saving their own lives in the process.\nPersonally, I was completely fucked. But I\u2019d done what I could for the mice, and for the station.\nThe door crashed inward and two burly grad students in gas masks came tumbling through. They seemed surprised that no further obstacles lay before them. Just me, floating placidly in my badly deranged lab, holding up my hands.\n\u201cUh, Dr. Yan,\u201d said one. \u201cWe, uh, I\u2019m sorry, but Dr. Ivanovic sent us to euthanize your mice.\u201d\n\u201cWhat mice?\u201d I asked innocently.\nWe don\u2019t exactly have security staff on Lasky Station, but we do have Dr. Kwok, and after some searching she came up with a pair of cable ties, which she used to fasten my wrists to a structural member in one of the escape shuttles. She wasn\u2019t gentle about it.\n\u201cYou are in deep shit,\u201d she reassured me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have time to deal with you now. You just stay here, stay out of the way, and try not to get into any more trouble. We\u2019ll deal with you when we get back to Iowa.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t even leave me my comm, the bitch. But my hearing is pretty good, and I was able to follow the ongoing story from what echoed through the station and into the shuttle. And occasionally someone would come into the shuttle to fetch or carry something; a few of them were even still speaking to me.\nFor the first couple of hours most of the staff were still focusing on getting themselves and their labs packed up for evacuation, while the Facilities crew continued, with ever-diminishing confidence, to try and find the leak. But gradually the emphasis changed, with more and more announcements asking people to please finish up packing and help deal with the mice. Over time the evacuation morphed into a full-on mouse hunt. And the mice were clearly winning. I was ashamed of myself for causing so much trouble, and at the same time smugly proud of my charges.\nI would say I was also concerned for my career, but I knew better; that ship had sunk. I would have to find some other way to pay back my student loans. If I were lucky, I wouldn\u2019t be doing it from prison.\nSuddenly everything changed. There was a loud and rather frenetic announcement on the public address system, which I couldn\u2019t quite make out, but it was followed by raucous cheering, which then devolved into scattered applause and a babble of conversation. I didn\u2019t know for sure what had just happened, but I had my suspicions . . . and my hopes.\nThey left me stewing in the shuttle for another hour before Dr. Kwok came and got me. \u201cCan you explain . . . this?\u201d she said, thrusting something in my face.\nIt was a mouse.\nIt was alive.\nIt had a micrometeoroid repair patch stuck to one front paw.\nAnd it was not my genius superteacher.\nYes, lab mice all look the same. But a teacher, even a postdoc, doesn\u2019t forget her best student.\nIt was touch and go for a while there, but they let me stay on the station. Just long enough to recapture the mice, at first, but eventually everyone admitted that we\u2019d stumbled onto a significant new result in the genetic basis of socialization and learning\u2014and teaching, which we hadn\u2019t expected at all\u2014and there wasn\u2019t anyone better than me to follow through on it. Or any better facility or population of test subjects.\nI\u2019m now a principal investigator, with a staff of three grad students. The mouse lab has expanded to completely fill module D, and the Lasky Foundation was persuaded by the publicity to increase our operating endowment. We are still underfunded, of course, but less so than before.\nMouse number 23070418, now called Maria Montessori, retired from the ballet completely and became a mascot, living in a small luxurious cage in my office\u2014yes, I have my own office now!\u2014and gratefully accepting treats from her legions of fans.\nAnd as for the rest . . .\nWell, I must confess I never recaptured all the mice I released that day. Most of them, yes. And I found thirteen little corpses, eventually. But that still leaves thirty-one unaccounted for, not including the original eighteen. And there\u2019s still no smell of mice, alive or dead, anywhere on the station outside the mouse lab. It is a puzzlement.\nAnd people keep coming to me with strange stories of missing items mysteriously reappearing, or small problems being repaired, if you just leave out treats overnight.\nThey want to know what the best kind of treats might be.\n\u201cHow are the elves today?\u201d Sam asks whenever we meet up in the break room.\n\u201cWhat elves?\u201d I always say.

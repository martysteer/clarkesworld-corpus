She taps on the pylo plating of the cart, making sure it\u2019s thick enough. Her database analyzes the sound of the tap and accepts that it is. She sighs a relief. The drones following her can\u2019t track her through the thick pylo plating of the cart. Newer carts, made cheaper, are more penetrative to their gaze, but she laughs to herself\u2014this is one of the old ones.\n Outside the cart, the maze of machines before her move cases of the stock, exocoke, the thirst-quenching fizz that supposedly enhances exoskeleton performance. Just her luck that today is soda day. She throws down the blocker blanket over the package in her arms. Her heart races as she reaches out to grab a case. She hears the click-click of the signal of the robot arm assessing an anomaly in the protocol. She swipes the case and pats her chest, which unleashes the UV jamming signals emanating from her arms. The robot arm stops clicking and resumes its transport of the cases.\n She opens up a bottle and wishes they were baby formula instead. She takes a gulp, grimaces at the bitter taste, and chugs it down. She tucks the bottle and the pack into the reinforced shelf on her exoskel, which then recedes to pull it close and self-seal. The bumps rattle her, and she pulls down the blocker blanket to check on her loveliest prize yet: the bundle wrapped in her arms. She looks down into the strange violet eyes and the small tuft of black hair. Her babe. She could never get over that. Her babe. \u611b\u747e. Aijin. \u201cLove\u201d and \u201cthe brilliance of gems\u201d\u2014her eyes, so amethyst-like. But it was a coincidence that her babe developed such a gemlike gaze, suited to her name. Luqiong was too weak after pregnancy to think of a name and just used her sister\u2019s name. It was, after all, a bit like her own, \u7490\u743c, lu qiong, a composition of characters that signify forms of beautiful jade. Both her and her babe with names of strength and allure. Strong as rocks and glistening with exceptional luster.\n For a week after birth, her babe wouldn\u2019t open her eyes, so Luqiong couldn\u2019t tell if her babe really had brilliant eyes or not to match her given Aijin name. She couldn\u2019t worry, there was no point. Survival: get her into shape and then see what\u2019s next. But when Aijin did finally peel her eyes open, after Luqiong managed to nourish the child and get her to a healthy weight, she felt that love, so overwhelming, so catching her off guard, so devastating, so . . . embedded in her babe\u2019s name. Aijin. She holds her close now, smelling her baby smell, as her teeth rattle, as her whole body trembles, as the machines direct the cart through uneven pavement. Luqiong jumps off, shields her child, throws out a jamming signal from her wrist for good measure, glides past familiar surroundings, behind broken pieces of furniture, past postindustrial waste, through a few dilapidated houses, and climbs with dexterous fingers up a fence and beyond.\n Her ears detect no buzz of drones as she waits until it darkens. Aijin sits quietly with her, her eyes closed, her body warm against her waist. As soon as the moon peeps out in the sky, she makes her way through the scrap jungle to her home.\n The moon\u2019s light grows piercing, almost too quickly. It illuminates her way, and she makes herself as small as she can, changing her exoskel to a dark camo. The spectral light casts dark shadows that would make the abandoned warehouse she\u2019s approaching look menacing to anyone but Luqiong. To Luqiong, it\u2019s home, or more like a strong house. Home, whatever that means, is protection, not comfort\u2014yet she can\u2019t help but admit a feeling of relief as she skips across shards on the ground and deploys her nimble fingers across an entry pad to deactivate the jerry-rigged alarm system.\n She\u2019s careful not to trip over the sinews of this alarm system she put together years ago and pushes against the trigger to drop the locks of the hidden door. She slides in and shuts the door behind her. Her exoskel shifts back to its typical metallic splendor to save energy. Luqiong lowers Aijin into a makeshift changing table made of a stolen warehouse cart, some medical blankets, and padding she had hijacked from a hospital delivery truck. Aijin is as quiet as a spycopter, not making even a peep. She has always been so good like that. Maybe she senses the danger or is used to the lack of conversation. But now that they\u2019re back in the strong house, Luqiong tickles her feet, hoping to get a small squeal out of her. Aijin\u2019s feet are plump and smooth. Luqiong feels a surge of pride for that\u2014plump with tiny wrinkles on their backsides, like a normal little babe. But she knows inside, that it\u2019s not enough. Aijin\u2019s not getting enough of what she needs. She knows it from the somatic readings she\u2019s hustled for, and from her own motherly instincts. And neither is Luqiong.\n Aijin looks unfazed at the touch, her violet eyes wide, and Luqiong insists, needing just a small smile, anything to brighten up the bleakness of the landscape that surrounds her. When Luqiong reaches the little knobby mound of Aijin\u2019s knee, drawing out claws and using the tips of her exoskel nails instead, Aijin gives in with a playful curling up of a lip and what could be mistaken as a coo. That\u2019s good enough for Luqiong. She retracts her exoskel nails, changes her, notes the shortage of diapers, and curses to herself. She rocks Aijin until she hears that heavy breathing that signifies her entry into dreamland and drops her into the foam-reinforced crate that serves as her crib. Her arms feel empty without Aijin in them, but she also wastes no time in getting all she needs to get done. With deft fingers, she pulls out the jade hairpin device that lets down a cascade of black hair over her exoskel torso and goes to pump. A mom\u2019s job is never over.\n It\u2019s never fun to pump, she thinks, as she settles into a memory-kev seat that molds into her exoskel. She lifts her back out for a moment and thinks a command that opens up the latch unveiling the compartment inside. With the hand not holding the hairpin, she pulls out the pack of exocokes, shimmies back into place, and slams the exoskel compartment closed, leaning back. She places the pack of exocokes beside her.\n She breathes out a few relaxing breaths that puff up from her abdomen and sits back up, listening carefully. It\u2019s nice and dark and Aijin is not making a sound. Good, she\u2019s still asleep. Aijin doesn\u2019t cry and scream typically, but sometimes she will coo softly to herself.\n Luqiong flicks on a few diodes and a small stream of light shines on her pin. Its jade facade shimmers, cobbled together with some alloys, glass, and a small vial. Luqiong braces herself for impact, grimaces, and punctures. For Luqiong pumping means more than putting a suction cup on the chest. It means getting through the tough exoskel with a needle, rupturing the inner layer, and letting the legs pull out from the pin, pinch her sunken breasts, and draw what little there is to draw. She enhances her natural formula with some synthesizers, which expands the volume, upgrades the nutritional value, and augments the innate sweetness. She knows it will taste not just of mother\u2019s milk but have a tinge of acidic, almost like citrus. She knows this because she\u2019s tasted it. From there, she adds powders for easier suckling.\n She lets the pump do its thing, wincing every so often as it does a slow draw. She sees the pull as the vial fills up with one tiny drop at a time. Leaning back again, eyes closed, she feels for the exocoke. The bottle is made of supe-glass, cold in her hands, but gives a bit so it doesn\u2019t shatter when dropped. She squeezes it tight as the little legs of her jade hairpin push against where she\u2019s most sensitive, and a shiver runs down her spine as she feels the liquid being extracted.\n She pops the top of the exocoke and takes a swig. She needs to ration them, but she\u2019s already onto her next swig before she sets it aside. The exocoke does as it advertises, eases the ache of the exoskel attached to her and sends in a bit of a numbing coolness so that the prickly grip of the hairpin no longer feels so intense.\n She opens her eyes and flicks at her hairpin. The jade ornamental curls release a soft ring. She holds it up to see that the bit of extract is consistent. The meager amount of liquid sloshes about. The elixir of life, she breathes, shaking her head. A small line of blood, hair-thin and no more than a fingernail long, trails in the otherwise cream-colored solution. Fine, not unusual with the pinprick and all. She listens again for Aijin and closes her eyes again, her thoughts wandering to practical matters: food, diapers, and her way out of this bedraggled life.\n Before she knows it, she\u2019s slumped back, her chest throbbing, head rolled to the side, and falling into a sleep, with the jade hairpin still attached, making a slight whirring sound at each drop collected.\n One day, she thinks, she\u2019ll feed her baby better. No hairpins, no synthetic additives, no puckering powders.\n She dreams of the smell of synthesizers giving way to incense, and exoskel grease giving way to jasmine blossoms. In her dream, her mom is short and petite, more petite than she ever was.\n She\u2019s scrounging about the dorm she shares with her mother and the two other families, all female members. It\u2019s a one inch bead her mom is looking for that Luqiong was playing with, rolling it about, pretending it\u2019s a self-driving motorcycle. But now it\u2019s missing, and her mom can\u2019t finish the necklace she was making.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be helpful, then at least don\u2019t cause me trouble,\u201d her mom says, eyebrows scrunched in gentle fury. Her mom shakes her head and Luqiong can smell the scent of the jasmine detangler spray her mom uses wafting toward her.\n She doesn\u2019t want to disappoint her mother, but everything disappoints. Ever since she got a sister, little Aijin, the one Luqiong named her baby after, everything disappoints. The fingers on her mom\u2019s hand giving out from arthritis when she\u2019s crafting makeshift jewelry to sell disappoints. Luqiong\u2019s daily surreptitious collection of odds and ends from the machinery room to use as materials for the jewelry disappoints. They\u2019re not shiny enough or they\u2019re not sanded down enough. There\u2019s never enough, not enough food, not enough formula. Her mom sacrifices herself to buy formula, since her milk has been inconsistent in the detention center. It\u2019s the stress, she says. It\u2019s the stress to keep you alive, to keep baby Aijin alive. Never enough formula, never enough milk.\n In the dream, Luqiong suffers hunger pains. She eats her rations, but it\u2019s not enough. She can\u2019t find the bead, but she finds the hairpin, the jade one engraved with jasmine flowers her mom treasures. It\u2019s put into the bin for the auto-grinder, to be trashed. She grabs it, but her sleeve gets stuck close enough to the grinding machine. It starts now, and her heart jumps. Her stomach turns as she\u2019s pulled closer to the chomping maw. In her dream, she\u2019s on the conveyor belt, screaming, but no one hears her, no one sees the shine of jade grasped in her fingers.\n When she wakes, her fists are clenched. The diodes\u2019 light is weak and starting to flicker. She turns them off. There\u2019s a repeated dull noise, and she realizes it\u2019s her jade hairpin device beeping, telling her that the vial is full. She pulls out the pin and moans. She forgot to release the legs of the hairpin from her chest. They pinch and grab, like the legs of little recorder spiderbots. She hits the release, but fumbles with her exonails half-retracted and ejects the contents of the vial onto her exoskel. She curses, trying to guide the stream of milk back into the vial.\n She salvages as much as she can, then puts the vial, still attached to the pin, aside. It gleams against the sliver of moonlight coming in from an exposed bit of window. It has always reminded her of another jade pin, the one her mother had in her hair. The only relic from her father that her mother hid to keep away from the collectors at the detention center. The one that her mother traded years ago for some extra formula for her dying little baby sister, Aijin.\n It was all in vain. Aijin, so small and vulnerable. Aijin so frail and thin. Aijin passed away. Even the money from the jewelry her mother cobbled together from machinery odds and ends dried up as her mother started losing hope and her arthritic hands bested her. She made all kinds of jewelry, but never hairpins. And then she stopped making them altogether.\n That was when Luqiong decided to leave on her own. She couldn\u2019t get it together for her mom, she couldn\u2019t convince her mom to leave. So she left. Escaped on one of the intake days, an undertaking that she planned for years. There was no Aijin to be a part of this plan either.\n And when it became Luqiong\u2019s turn for her own surprising birth that was never meant to be, she named her Aijin and had asked for no wedding ring, no gifts. Just a straight up hairpin breast pump for her exoskel. They were hard to get, expensive and rare. And it was all hush-hush. Signalers can\u2019t get pregnant, the effects of the UV and their exoskel attachments render them what they call \u201cinert.\u201d But Luqiong found herself being the impossible, doing the impossible, cutting through her torso exoskel to relieve her expanding belly, giving an excruciating birth, running from her job, from being a signaler and electrical engineer, running away again, not from the detention center of the old days gone, but from the combat commissioners that had trained her, with nothing but a state-of-the-art cutting edge hairpin breast pump made from only the most exquisite of jades and alloys and a week\u2019s worth of portafood.\n She hustled, begged, cajoled, worked street-smart, got fake IDs, did everything she could to make herself useful in all sorts of underground and black-market ways. But now, she wanted that life over. She wanted a new life, one where she could really feel, physically hold her lifeblood close, and give her baby and her a fresh start.\n She gets up and handles the set of test tubes, all sterilized thanks to the bathing sterilizer unit. Everything she owns she owes to her instincts, distracted others, trained skills, and the agility and speed of her pylo exoskel. She starts the distillation, and the tubes wash with a blue liquid. She opens the hairpin vial and pours the contents in, mixing powders and other liquids. As it bubbles, thickening now in the addition process for enhancing the milk, she hears a small coo.\n Luqiong walks to the baby crate, checks on her little pride, the package that was never meant to be. She holds Aijin close saying, \u201cSoon, honey, soon. Soon, I will hold you to my skin and I will stare at you as you drink from me.\u201d\n It might be a stupid wish, a small wish, but that\u2019s all Luqiong wants. For her own Aijin to be healthy. To not pass away. To not have to drink the substandard concoction she makes from the little she produces and thickens up for the meal. She wants to remove the exoskel in total, rebuild her own body, hold Aijin close to her, and have that skin contact as she nurses her child.\n She curses.\n She just wants to flippin\u2019 nurse her child, like any other mom.\n She picks up the hairpin and raises it in the air. She pulls her elbow back like she\u2019s about to hurl it. She can envision it hitting the wall and shattering, beeping and shrieking as it malfunctions. Her arm trembles. She puts it down. No, she can\u2019t make it shatter, she can\u2019t just destroy this nipple-pricking pump. This extravagant top-of-the-line persecuting device. She needs it. They need it.\n For now.\n Only for a while longer, she tells herself. We\u2019re leaving. We\u2019re finding the skelcutter. She\u2019s got hints, road maps she\u2019s drawn from stories and hidden away, and some help.\n Her hand trembles as she swirls her hair in a bun and affixes it with her jade hairpin. It\u2019s cold to the touch.\n Aijin, you and me, she whispers. Tomorrow, we will set off.\n And one day, you will feel my skin, under the shell. I will feel you and you will feel me. And you will drink from me like I\u2019m a wishing fountain, making you strong, healthy with all your aspirations coming true.\n Luqiong picks up her daughter, holds her to her abdomen, to the exposed part she cut out of her exoskel that has left her scarred and damaged. It\u2019s infected, that part of the exoskel, a virus running up its frayed, tenacious pylo fibers. Aijin coos, her eyes so brilliant and gemlike. She must feel the exposed skin of her mom\u2019s abdomen because she tries to suck on the exoskel that encases her chest. Luqiong locks her elbows holding Aijin\u2019s pursed lips away.\n Luqiong blinks her eyes, casts her face toward the rising sun, and straightens her lips. The hairpin pokes into her scalp, itching her. She covers her baby with the shielding blanket and shoots out a UV message, practicing the delivery of that message for when she meets the smuggler when they will cross east to the place where underground skelcutters and other fugitive traders are purported to exist. Where they must exist.\n She makes herself strong, to not cry, as she grabs a premade bottle of her concocted milk. She tips it toward her babe, thinking of Aijin the first, her still body, the smell of jasmine, and the cold touch of jade flowers on a fancy hairpin of long ago. And the smooth feel of her mother\u2019s skin long before that when they hugged, or when she consoled her mom, stroking her arm. The sound of the nutritive elements percolating into the solution fills the room. Aijin sucks and swallows, sucks and swallows, her little cheeks puffing in and out. And even though Luqiong\u2019s just holding up a bottle, for a moment she feels a pang in her chest. And she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s her heart or her breast, aching under the stiff, unforgiving armor.\n D.A.

She polished his boots with bear grease and swept the floor with a willow broom. She washed the sheets, both sets, once a week. She dried them on a clothesline near their house\u2014the one-room log cabin she guessed he\u2019d built himself. Sometimes the Wisconsin breeze blew more dirt into the sheets as they fluttered, the linen stained with human fluids she couldn\u2019t scrub out.\nHe went hunting most days, the man she believed to be Lydia\u2019s father. Sometimes he\u2019d stroke her hair and say, \u201cI\u2019ll be back by nightfall, my Lydia, with fresh meat.\u201d The girl smiled at him, grateful for his presence at night when the panthers screamed. He trudged off through the forest, shotgun slung to his back, and she closed the door behind him. The door had no lock. No one was around for miles except the Chippewa, who ignored them.\nThe girl leaned against the door each morning, in the single room that had become her new home\u2014her prison. She repeated to herself, in case she forgot: My name is Amanda Barnes. I\u2019m twenty-six years old. I was born in 1980. I don\u2019t belong here. But then she looked at her body, the unfamiliar skinny arms, her work-raw hands, and wondered how much longer she\u2019d stay.\nMix cornmeal with water, and bake into johnnycakes. Thrust the dash into the churn with regular strokes.\nThis body knew its required tasks. The body\u2019s hands mixed the cornmeal, stoked the stove, braided the onion tops together and hung them in the attic. Amanda found these chores instinctive\u2014a way of listening to her core, where some ancestral spirit guided her. No words were spoken\u2014she simply knew, the way she knew her heartbeat.\nOf course she\u2019d told the man who she was\u2014two years ago, when she woke up here. He\u2019d blamed the fever and given her medicinal whiskey that she vomited back up. She couldn\u2019t blame him\u2014her story was unbelievable. How should she tell him she\u2019d fallen asleep and awoken in another time, with no idea how she\u2019d gotten here? She was only a little surprised to discover that the body had magic in it. Dishes cleaned faster than expected. The dirt floor swept itself at the barest touch. Magic must have brought her\u2014but she couldn\u2019t reverse it.\nHer old life was fading away. She remembered drinking cinnamon lattes, driving to work, skimming the Internet personals\u2014these were the habits of a film character somewhere, in a theater she had been in once. They happened in darkness, and when the movie ended she was here, blinking in the sunlight of 1838.\nMend shirts with tiny stitches, overlapping each other so they look like white paint. The tighter your stitches, the less likely they\u2019ll rip. I\u2019m careful when mending his shirts.\nHe\u2019d come home at night, with a dead deer or even a bear. Amanda marveled at how he slung the corpse around, the meaty weight under full control. She sometimes watched him working shirtless, as he smoked meat in a hickory fire or planted potato seeds. When he split firewood, the log cracked on the axe\u2019s downstroke\u2014almost before he touched it, like the wood opened itself for him. He worked to provide for her\u2014not her, but Lydia, whose body she was in.\nAmanda had thought about leaving, but there was nowhere to go. The nearest town was forty miles away, and she didn\u2019t know what direction. Wisconsin was frontier territory\u2014just fur traders, Indians, and settlers who wanted to avoid other people. She\u2019d asked where town was, but he didn\u2019t say. \u201cWhy would you go there, Lydia?\u201d he\u2019d ask. \u201cIt\u2019s too far, and there\u2019s nothing to see. Someday I\u2019ll take you, when you\u2019re older.\u201d\nSomeday. Amanda clung to that idea, as she scrubbed their undergarments. She didn\u2019t know what magic had summoned her, nor who Lydia was. If something connected her to this body, she couldn\u2019t see it. She\u2019d stopped praying to find her way home. Even her mantra\u2014My name is Amanda Barnes\u2014felt useless. Just unrelated syllables\u2014a spell with its life drained away. With each day, the idea of leaving became harder to remember. Despite her mantra, there was him, and he was the only reason she saw that drew her to this time.\nIt was impossible not to love him. That was the problem. Perhaps if she\u2019d grown up here\u2014if she remembered him swinging her in his arms, or leaning down to ruffle her hair\u2014perhaps then, she could accept him as a father. But Amanda was twenty-six, and this man not much older\u2014thirty-three, or a bit more. He was attractive, kind, and hardworking. He brought in fresh-killed meat, and hoed the potatoes with his strong arms, and once he shot a wolf that was nosing around the cabin door.\nOn Sunday nights, they sang hymns together. Their voices blended, tenor and soprano, and Amanda knew she could never tell him how she felt. He thought he was her father. Maybe, in a sense, he was\u2014but he was all she had. At night as she listened to him sleep across the room, she thought about how they harmonized on the high notes, and how cold it was to sleep alone.\nI like how gravy simmers. A bubble pauses, swelling on the surface. It grows so large it might escape and float away. But the bubble bursts, because it must. It returns to the pot, to be served for his dinner.\nHe came home one night, flushed with November\u2019s chill. \u201cPoor huntin\u2019 out there.\u201d\nAmanda served his meal, buttering his potatoes. The attic was full of onions and smoked meat. Soon the blizzards would begin, and she\u2014again\u2014would be stuck inside the cabin for six months. Last year she\u2019d gone nearly mad with boredom. Still\u2014sometimes he\u2019d go looking for fresh meat, and she\u2019d worry. What if he didn\u2019t come back? What if a wolf attacked him? What would she do on her own?\n\u201cWhat happens to me?\u201d she asked aloud.\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens to me,\u201d she said, changing her train of thought, \u201cin a few years? I\u2019m nearly grown. What then?\u201d\nHe chewed on his venison. \u201cI dunno,\u201d he said. He spoke with difficulty, as if he\u2019d been considering it. \u201cFrank might want you. He\u2019s the man I trade with in town.\u201d\n\u201cAm I property, to be given away?\u201d she asked bitterly.\n\u201cLydia! I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d He stabbed his fork into the fried onions. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give you to any man you didn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I have to think about my future.\u201d Future\u2014the word recalled something, about the butterscotch candies she kept in her desk . . . She shook her head. My name is Amanda Barnes . . .\nHe stirred the onions around his plate. \u201cWant me to find someone for you? I could send you back East to work as a servant. I don\u2019t got any living relatives. It\u2019s just us, Lydia. You \u2019n me. At least out here, it\u2019s just us. We can live any way we want. No one will bother us.\u201d\n\u201cWho would cook for you if I left?\u201d\nHe set his fork down. The fire in the hearth crackled. \u201cI don\u2019t need much. I\u2019d get on all right.\u201d\n\u201cAlone?\u201d\nHe stood up. An upset person had nowhere to storm to, except the attic loft. Even there no one could hide, not long\u2014everything was visible from below. He moved to the fire, next to the glassless shuttered windows. \u201cI\u2019d get a wife, I suppose.\u201d\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want one.\u201d\nAmanda took a guess. \u201cBecause of my mother?\u201d\nHe jumped like she\u2019d shot him. He turned to face her. \u201cYes.\u201d\nAmanda closed her eyes. \u201cDo I look like her?\u201d\nHis response was hoarse, and a long time coming. \u201cYes. Yes, you do, Lydia.\u201d\nHe likes his meat fried with potatoes. The potatoes are in the attic. He never goes up there\u2014that place is my own. Listen. A blizzard is coming.\nAmanda was in the attic, getting a string of onions for supper. All meals were the same each week\u2014potatoes and onions, and whatever meat he brought home. He never came up here\u2014somehow, she knew. She had memories that felt like someone else\u2019s. He was hunting again. Amanda worried about him, alone in the woods. But he took his shotgun, and he kept it well-oiled.\nShe kept thinking of the way he\u2019d spoken the name Lydia. She\u2019d heard that note\u2014the longing for his absent wife\u2014his loneliness, alone with his daughter in the wilderness. But he\u2019d chosen this life for them\u2014to live undisturbed by others. Free.\nHer kerosene lamp gave little light in the attic. It was early March. The windows were shuttered for the season. Overhead the wind blew across the roof. A blizzard, she knew\u2014no, it wasn\u2019t her knowing that. The deep instinct told her. She hated the blizzards, hated the way they buried the house and trapped her inside. If he were home when it started, he\u2019d stay\u2014but otherwise, he dug shelter where he could, and she was alone.\nShe tugged on an onion string. All winter, she\u2019d thought about him\u2014as they slept in their beds, and as they sang together. She saw how he looked at her. He was thinking it too, and probably hating himself. A father and daughter\u2014no, that couldn\u2019t be. But she wasn\u2019t his daughter. She was Amanda Barnes, whether he believed her or not.\nThe string broke. Onions tumbled to the floor. One rolled behind the cornmeal barrel. Amanda hunted it down and scooped it up like a runaway softball. She used to play softball\u2014when was that? In her past, which was now her future. She felt shaky as the wind howled. The blizzard was coming. He would take shelter somewhere, and she was alone.\nAmanda cradled the rough onion in her hand. Every crop was hard-fought. Each onion grew from his sweat, as he worked to feed them both. Tears ran down her face. Winter was driving her mad\u2014hands scratching inside her, a voice trying to shout, a feeling colder than snowdrifts. Something hateful rose inside her like a ghost, until she thought she would burst.\nShe threw the onion against the wall. It\u2019s March that does this to me, she thought, only March. She wanted to vanish into the snow with this magic body. A wish\u2014but wishes were powdery snow melting in sunlight, gone before a season ended. If she could wish herself into happier times\u2014but she knew no spells, and the body only seemed to do household magic. The things it knew, perhaps, from when Lydia was here.\nBut now it was Amanda\u2019s body. She was stuck in this house, this time. This life was hers\u2014to suffer through, or to find happiness. She picked up the onion. \u201cMy name is Amanda Barnes,\u201d she said aloud. That man was not her father, and she could do as she pleased. No one would stop her.\nThe wrong wish is a dangerous spell, cold like ice. It traps the careless. It freezes you under the surface and never melts. I made a mistake. I need my body back.\nDownstairs, the door crashed open. Amanda dropped the onion. Lydia\u2019s father stumbled in with a swirl of snow, his arm clutched across his coat. His hand pressed bloody snow against his shoulder.\n\u201cLydia,\u201d he called, \u201cI\u2019ve shot myself.\u201d\nThe girl scrambled down the attic ladder. He staggered to his chair and shrugged his coat off. He tore his shirt away, ripping the stitches like paper. The wound was more blood than injury. She grabbed strips of cloth and put water on the stove. He would live\u2014but her body was cold, like the blizzard had swept inside the house.\n\u201cAn accident,\u201d he said. \u201cMy own fault\u2014careless. So distracted\u2014aahh!\u201d\nHe sucked in his breath as she cleaned his wound with water. \u201cNo. Bring whiskey.\u201d\nShe fetched the bottle from the shelf. He poured it over his shoulder, hissing when the alcohol burned the wound. The brown liquid mixed with blood and ran down his arm. He took a swig of whiskey. He swirled the liquor in the bottle, and drank three more times.\nShe took the whiskey. Her hands shook. The wind rattled the shutters. Behind his back she took a drink herself. The liquid burned her throat and warmed her, like she hadn\u2019t felt for months. She drank again, to drive away March, and loneliness, and the dark hatefulness inside her.\n\u201cMore,\u201d he muttered, and she handed it back. He drank deeply, leaving the bottle half-full. He set it down. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Help me wrap the wound.\u201d\nThe girl obeyed, and the magic worked\u2014her hands knew where to put the cloth, where to tighten or leave loose. The whiskey burned inside her like a kerosene lamp flame\u2014banishing darkness, past, and future. There was only this moment, touching his skin, easing his pain. His breathing slowed, and his muscles relaxed. When she finished, she pulled her chair over and leaned on his good shoulder. She might have lost him, she realized, and she would have been alone\u2014with the blizzard, and the cabin, and a lifetime stretching ahead of her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you,\u201d he said. He took her hand and squeezed it. Her heart raced. She leaned over to kiss his cheek. He turned his head to say something\u2014and she brushed against his mouth.\nI can do what I want, Amanda thought fiercely. She kissed his lips, her tongue exploring their closed line. He moaned once, then opened to her. Their tongues fought inside him, tasting of whiskey.\nAmanda stroked his hair. The room floated around her. \u201cShh,\u201d she said, moving her mouth away. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d The instinct inside her screamed no, you can\u2019t\u2014and she silenced it. This was her life now.\nHe grabbed her waist and pulled her onto his lap. He plowed into her mouth like a starving man. Amanda\u2019s breath quickened. His hardness pressed through his workpants against her leg. She wondered if this body could hex him. Her hand slid up his thigh, brushing against\u2014\nHe shoved her away. She tumbled to the floor, bruising her hip. He reeled against the chair and clutched his forehead. \u201cOh, God, oh Mary, Jesus\u2014\u201d he muttered.\nAmanda crawled away. The room spun. His voice rang over the crackling fire: \u201cWe can never do that again, do you hear me? Never.\u201d He yanked the door open. Blizzard winds swirled in. He swore and slammed the door, not looking at her. \u201cGo to the attic. Stay away. Go away.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your daughter!\u201d\n\u201cStop it!\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Amanda Barnes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop it!\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t. The words poured out like blood, staining the space between them. \u201cDon\u2019t you see how I\u2019ve changed? I\u2019m not her anymore. I love you. Look at me\u2014you know I\u2019m not her!\u201d\nHe whirled around, and she read doubt in his eyes. For a moment, she dared believe. Then his expression hardened, like he\u2019d built a barrier against her\u2014against himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d\n\u201cI swear it\u2019s true. You know it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cWe can never be that way. No matter what we want.\u201d He pulled the Bible off the shelf and went to his bed. He faced the wall and opened the book. He didn\u2019t turn the pages.\nNever. She could never have what she wanted, never leave, never hope. Deep inside her, something clawed to get out. It was that instinct, that voice\u2014the one she\u2019d trusted until now. Amanda glanced at the attic ladder, but it was too hard to climb. She stumbled to her bed and collapsed, drunk and exhausted. Her stomach heaved, but she kept its contents down. Even when she closed her eyes, she was spinning out of control. She couldn\u2019t fight anymore. The darkness would bury her\u2014like this damned cabin under ten feet of snow.\nNo, you can\u2019t\u2014I won\u2019t let you\u2014\nShe was fighting for her life, the girl: only one body for both of them, two minds in the same magic flesh\u2014one born there, and one summoned against her will. It should have been an exchange\u2014Lydia\u2019s wish come true. The spell should have let her escape her hated life. It had been the wrong wish. The wrong wish could kill.\nLydia\u2019s spell failed, and she had paid for it. Trapped under Amanda\u2019s presence, she\u2019d waited, cold as burial, imprisoned inside her own flesh. Somewhere in the future was a soulless body\u2014Amanda\u2019s body, the one Lydia wanted. She knew now: her magic couldn\u2019t take her there. But it could still free her from this self-made prison.\nShe waited until Amanda was weak. The fight was brief\u2014the body\u2019s magic ran deep like a well, and Lydia knew how to tap it. Amanda did not, and was defenseless. Lydia rose from the icy place inside and summoned power from her own blood. She started with her fingertips, the muscles clenching at her command, and worked her way into the body\u2019s organs. She wrapped Amanda in tendons and bile before pushing her into darkness. Lydia buried her in the body, grieving. Her guilt was a stain she would never scrub out. But she felt her life returning, once she controlled her body again.\nLydia woke in her familiar bed. It was night. Her head felt fuzzy, like she\u2019d woken from a bad dream. Her tongue was cotton-dry. She looked toward her father\u2019s empty bed. A candle stub cast its light across the patchwork quilt. Next to it stood the empty whiskey bottle, reflecting the flame into a shining stripe.\nShe sat up, wondering where he might be. Then she knew\u2014by instinct, like breathing. She knew where he was, the way she knew what he wanted.\nA shadow crossed in front of the flickering candle. A breath touched her face, smelling of liquor. His hands pressed her shoulders against the bed. \u201cNo,\u201d Lydia whispered, sick with whiskey and buried desire. Her stomach lurched as her fingers curled toward him. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t\u2014we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nHe said, \u201cOh God.\u201d The candle went out."}

Yet his seat-mate hadn\u2019t even shifted position in two hours. That was fine with Gennady, who had spent the whole trip trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t there at all.\nThe young American had been a bit more active during the flight across the Atlantic: at least, his eyes had been open and Gennady could see colored lights flickering across them from his augmented reality glasses. But he had exchanged less than twenty words with Gennady since they\u2019d left Washington.\nIn short, he\u2019d been the ideal traveling companion.\nThe other four passengers were stretching and groaning. Gennady poked Ambrose in the side and said, \u201cWake up. Welcome to the ninth-biggest country in the world.\u201d\nAmbrose snorted and sat up. \u201cBrazil?\u201d he said hopefully. Then he looked out his window. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\nThe little municipal airport had a single gate, which as the only plane on the field, they were taxiing up to uncontested. Over the entrance to the single-story building was the word \u201c\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a.\u201d \u201cWelcome to Stepnogorsk,\u201d said Gennady as he stood to retrieve his luggage from the overhead rack. He traveled light by habit. Ambrose, he gathered, had done so from necessity.\n\u201cStepnogorsk . . . ?\u201d Ambrose shambled after him, a mass of wrinkled clothing leavened with old sweat.\n\u201cSecret Soviet town,\u201d Ambrose mumbled as they reached the plane\u2019s hatch and a burst of hot dry air lifted his hair. \u201cPopulation sixty-thousand,\u201d he added as he put his left foot on the metal steps. Halfway down he said, \u201cManufactured anthrax bombs in the Cold War!\u201d And as he set foot on the tarmac he finished with, \u201cWhere the hell is Kazakhstan? . . . Oh.\u201d\n\u201cBigger than Western Europe,\u201d said Gennady. \u201cEver heard of it?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d said the youth testily\u2014but Gennady could see from how he kept his eyes fixed in front of him that he was still frantically reading about the town from some website or other. The wan August sunlight revealed him to be taller than Gennady, pale, with stringy hair, and everything about him soft\u2014a sculpture done in rounded corners. He had a wide face, though; he might pass for Russian. Gennady clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cLet me do the talking,\u201d he said as they dragged themselves across the blistering tarmac to the terminal building.\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Ambrose, scratching his neck. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re here because you\u2019re with me. And you needed to disappear, but that doesn\u2019t mean I stop working.\u201d\nGennady glanced around. The landscape here should look a lot like home, which was only a day\u2019s drive to the west\u2014and here indeed was that vast sky he remembered from Ukraine. After that first glance, though, he did a double-take. The dry prairie air normally smelled of dust and grass at this time of year, and there should have been yellow grass from here to the flat horizon\u2014but instead the land seemed blasted, with large patches of bare soil showing. There was only stubble where there should have been grass. It looked more like Australia than Asia. Even the trees ringing the airport were dead, just gray skeletons clutching the air.\nHe thought about climate change as they walked through the concrete-floored terminal; since they\u2019d cleared customs in Amsterdam, the bored-looking clerks here just waved them through. \u201cHang on,\u201d said Ambrose as he tried to keep up with Gennady\u2019s impatient stride. \u201cI came to you guys for asylum. Doesn\u2019t that mean you put me up somewhere, some hotel, you know, away from the action?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get any farther from the action than this.\u201d They emerged onto a boulevard that had grass, though it hadn\u2019t been watered nor cut in a long while; the civilized lawn merged imperceptibly with the wild prairie. There was nothing visible from here to the horizon, except in one direction where a cluster of listless windmills jutted above some low trees.\nA single taxicab was sitting at the crumbled curb.\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d said Ambrose.\nGennady had to smile. \u201cYou were expecting some Black Sea resort, weren\u2019t you?\u201d He slipped into the taxi, which stank of hot vinyl and motor oil. \u201cAny car rental agency,\u201d he said to the driver in Russian. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re some Cold War defector,\u201d he continued to Ambrose in English. \u201cYour benefactor is the U.N. And they don\u2019t have much money.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re what\u2014putting me up in a motel in Kazakhstan?\u201d Ambrose struggled to put his outrage into words. \u201cWhat I saw could\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d They pulled away from the curb and became the only car on a cracked blacktop road leading into town.\n\u201cCan\u2019t tell you,\u201d mumbled Ambrose, suddenly looking shifty. \u201cI was told not to tell you anything.\u201d\nGennady swore in Ukrainian and looked away. They drove in silence for a while, until Ambrose said, \u201cSo why are you here, then? Did you piss somebody off?\u201d\nGennady smothered the urge to push Ambrose out of the cab. \u201cCan\u2019t tell you,\u201d he said curtly.\n\u201cDoes it involve SNOPB?\u201d Ambrose pronounced it \u2018snop-bee.\u2019\nGennady would have been startled had he not known Ambrose was connected to the net via his glasses. \u201cYou show me yours, I\u2019ll show you mine,\u201d he said. Ambrose snorted in contempt.\nThey didn\u2019t speak for the rest of the drive.\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d said Gennady later that evening. \u201cHe says he\u2019s being chased by Russian agents, NASA\u2014and Google?\u201d\nOn the other end of the line, Eleanor Frankl sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we dumped him on you at the airport,\u201d said the New York director of the International Atomic Energy Agency. She was Gennady\u2019s boss for this new and\u2014so far\u2014annoyingly vague contract. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t time to explain why we were sending him with you to Kazakhstan,\u201d she added.\n\u201cSo explain now.\u201d He was pacing in the grass in front of the best hotel his IAEA stipend could afford. It was evening and the crickets were waking up; to the west, fantastically huge clouds had piled up, their tops still lit golden as the rest of the sky faded into mauve. It was cooling off already.\n\u201cRight . . . Well, first of all, it seems he really is being chased by the Russians, but not by the country. It\u2019s the Soviet Union Online that\u2019s after him. And the only place their IP addresses are blocked is inside the geographical territories of the Russian and Kazakhstani Republics.\u201d\n\u201cSo, let me get this straight,\u201d said Gennady heavily. \u201cPoor Ambrose is being chased by Soviet agents. He ran to the U.N. rather than the FBI, and to keep him safe you decided to transport him to the one place in the world that is free of Soviet influence. Which is Russia.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Frankl brightly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re escorting him because your contract is taking you there anyway. No other reason.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine. Just tell me what the hell I\u2019m supposed to be looking for at SNOPB. The place was a God-damned anthrax factory. I\u2019m a radiation specialist.\u201d\nHe heard Frankl take a deep breath, and then she said, \u201cTwo years ago, an unknown person or persons hacked into a Los Alamos server and stole the formula for an experimental metastable explosive. Now we have a paper trail and emails that have convinced us that a metastable bomb is being built. You know what this means?\u201d\nGennady leaned against the wall of the hotel, suddenly feeling sick. \u201cThe genie is finally out of the bottle.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s true, Gennady, then everything we\u2019ve worked for has come to naught. Because as of now, anybody in the world who wants a nuclear bomb, can make one.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t know what to say, so he just stared out at the steppe, thinking about a world where hydrogen bombs were as easy to get as TNT. His whole life\u2019s work would be rendered pointless\u2014and all arms treaties, the painstaking work of generations to put the nuclear nightmare back in its bottle. The nuclear threat had been containable when it was limited to governments and terrorists\u2014but now, the threat was from everybody . . .\nEleanor\u2019s distant voice snapped him back to attention. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Gennady: we don\u2019t know very much about this group that\u2019s building the metastable weapon. By luck we\u2019ve managed to decrypt a few emails from one party, so we know a tiny bit\u2014a minimal bit\u2014about the design of the bomb. It seems to be based on one of the biggest of the weapons ever tested at Semipalatinsk\u2014its code name was the Tsarina.\u201d\n\u201cThe Tsarina?\u201d Gennady whistled softly. \u201cThat was a major, major test. Underground, done in 1968. Ten megatonnes\u2014lifted the whole prairie two meters and dropped it. Killed about a thousand cattle from the ground shock. Scared the hell out of the Americans, too.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and we\u2019ve discovered that some of the Tsarina\u2019s components were made at the Stepnogorsk Scientific Experimental and Production Base. In Building 242.\u201d\n\u201cBut SNOPB was a biological facility, not nuclear. How can this possibly be connected?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how, yet. Listen, Gennady, I know it\u2019s a thin lead. After you\u2019re done at the SNOPB, I want you to drive out to Semipalatinsk and investigate the Tsarina site.\u201d\n\u201cHmmph.\u201d Part of Gennady was deeply annoyed. Part was relieved that he wouldn\u2019t be dealing with any IAEA or Russian nuclear staff in the near future. Truth to tell, stalking around the Kazaki grasslands was a lot more appealing than dealing with the political shit-storm that would hit when this all went public.\nBut speaking of people . . . He glanced up at the hotel\u2019s one lighted window. With a grimace he pocketed his augmented reality glasses and went up to the room.\nAmbrose was sprawled on one of the narrow beds. He had the TV on and was watching a Siberian ski-adventure infomercial. \u201cWell?\u201d he said as Gennady sat on the other bed and dragged his shoes off.\n\u201cTour of secret Soviet anthrax factory. Tomorrow, after Egg McMuffins.\u201d\n\u201cYay,\u201d said Ambrose with apparent feeling. \u201cDo I get to wear a hazmat suit?\u201d\n\u201cNot this time.\u201d Gennady lay back, then saw that Ambrose was staring at him with an alarmed look on his face. \u201cIs fine,\u201d he said, waggling one hand at the boy. \u201cOnly one underground bunker we\u2019re interested in, and they probably never used it. The place never went into full production, you know.\u201d\n\u201cMeaning it only made a few hundred pounds of anthrax per day instead of the full ton it was designed for! I should feel reassured?\u201d\nGennady stared at the uneven ceiling. \u201cIs an adventure.\u201d He must be tired, his English was slipping.\n\u201cThis sucks.\u201d Ambrose crossed his arms and glowered at the TV.\nGennady thought for a while. \u201cSo what did you do to piss off Google so much? Drive the rover off a cliff?\u201d Ambrose didn\u2019t answer, and Gennady sat up. \u201cYou found something. On Mars.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Ambrose. \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Gennady lay down again. \u201cStill, I think I\u2019d enjoy it. Even if it wasn\u2019t in real-time . . . driving on Mars. That would be cool.\u201d\n\u201cThat sucked too.\u201d\n\u201cReally? I would have thought it would be fun, seeing all those places emerge from low-res satellite into full hi-res 3-D.\u201d\nBut Ambrose shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it worked. That\u2019s the point. I couldn\u2019t believe my luck when I won the contest, you know? I thought it\u2019d be like being the first man on Mars, only I wouldn\u2019t have to leave my living room. But the whole point of the rover was to go into terrain that hadn\u2019t been photographed from the ground before. And with the time-delay on signals to Mars, I wasn\u2019t steering it in real time. I\u2019d drive in fast-forward mode over low-res pink hills that looked worse than a forty-year-old video game, then upload the drive sequence and log off. The rover\u2019d get the commands twenty minutes later and drive overnight, then download the results. By that time it was the next day and I had to enter the next path. Rarely had time to even look at where we\u2019d actually gone the day before.\u201d\nGennady considered. \u201cA bit disappointing. But still\u2014more than most people ever get.\u201d\n\u201cMore than anyone else will ever get.\u201d Ambrose scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s what was so awful about it. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Gennady arched an eyebrow. \u201cWe who grew up in the old Soviet Union know a little about disappointment.\u201d\nAmbrose looked mightily uncomfortable. \u201cI grew up in Washington. Capital of the world! But my dad went from job to job, we were pretty poor. So every day I could see what you could have, you know, the Capital dome, the Mall, all that power and glory . . . what they could have\u2014but not me. Never me. So I used to imagine a future where there was a whole new world where I could be . . . \u201d\n\u201cImportant?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cSomething like that. NASA used to tell us they were just about to go to Mars, any day now, and I wanted that. I dreamed about homesteading on Mars.\u201d He looked defensive; but Gennady understood the romance of it. He just nodded.\n\u201cThen when I was twelve the Pakistani-Indian war happened and they blew up each other\u2019s satellites. All that debris from the explosions is going to be up there for centuries! You can\u2019t get a manned spacecraft through that cloud, it\u2019s like shrapnel. Hell, they haven\u2019t even cleared low Earth orbit to restart the orbital tourist industry. I\u2019ll never get to really go there! None of us will. We\u2019re never gettin\u2019 off this sinkhole.\u201d\nGennady scowled at the ceiling. \u201cI hope you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to the life of the last man to drive on Mars.\u201d Ambrose dragged the tufted covers back from the bed. \u201cInstead of space, I get a hotel in Kazakhstan. Now let me sleep. It\u2019s about a billion o\u2019clock in the morning, my time.\u201d\nHe was soon snoring, but Gennady\u2019s alarm over the prospect of a metastable bomb had him fully awake. He put on his AR glasses and reviewed the terrain around SNOPB, but much of the satellite footage was old and probably out of date. Ambrose was right: nobody was putting up satellites these days if they could help it.\nLittle had probably changed at the old factory, though, and it was a simple enough place. Planning where to park and learning where Building 242 was hadn\u2019t reduced his anxiety at all, so on impulse he switched his view to Mars. The sky changed color\u2014from pure blue to butterscotch\u2014but otherwise, the landscape looked disturbingly similar. There were a lot more rocks on Mars, and the dirt was red, but the emptiness, the slow rolling monotony of the plain and stillness were the same, as if he\u2019d stepped into a photograph. (Well, he actually had, but he knew there would be no more motion in this scene were he there.) He commanded the viewpoint to move, and for a time strolled, alone, in Ambrose\u2019s footsteps\u2014or rather, the ruts of Google\u2019s rover. Humans had done this in their dreams for thousands of years, yet Ambrose was right\u2014this place was, in the end, no more real than those dreams.\nRussia\u2019s cosmonauts had still been romantic idols when he was growing up. In photos they had stood with their heads high, minds afire with plans to stride over the hills of the moon and Mars. Gennady pictured them in the years after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, when they still had jobs, but no budget or destination any more. Where had their dreams taken them?\nThe Baikonur spaceport was south of here. Instead of space, in the end they\u2019d also had to settle for a hard bed in Kazakhstan.\nIn the morning they drove out to the old anthrax site in a rented Tata sedan. The fields around Stepnogorsk looked like they\u2019d been glared at by God, except where bright blue dew-catcher fencing ran in rank after rank across the stubble. \u201cWhat\u2019re those?\u201d asked Ambrose, pointing; this was practically the first thing he\u2019d said since breakfast.\nIn the rubble-strewn field of what had once been SNOPB, several small windmills were twirling atop temporary masts. Below them were some shipping-container sized boxes with big grills in their sides. The site looked healthier than the surrounding prairie; there were actual green trees in the distance. Of course, this area had been wetlands and there\u2019d been a creek running behind SNOPB; maybe it was still here, which was a hopeful sign.\n\u201cHeadquarters told me that some kind of climate research group is using the site,\u201d he told Ambrose as he pulled up and stopped the car. \u201cBut it\u2019s still public land.\u201d\n\u201cThey built an anthrax factory less than five minutes outside of town?\u201d Ambrose shook his head, whether in wonder or disgust, Gennady couldn\u2019t tell. They got out of the car, and Ambrose looked around in obvious disappointment. \u201cWow, it\u2019s gone gone.\u201d He seemed stunned by the vastness of the landscape. Only a few foundation walls now stuck up out of the cracked lots where the anthrax factory had once stood, except for where the big box machines sat whirring and humming. They were near where the bunkers had been; so, with a frown of curiosity, Gennady strolled in that direction. Ambrose followed, muttering to himself. \u201c . . . Last update must have been ten years ago.\u201d He had his glasses on, so he was probably comparing the current view to what he could see online.\nAccording to Gennady\u2019s notes, the bunkers had been grass-covered buildings with two-meter thick walls, designed to withstand a nuclear blast. In the 1960s and 70s they\u2019d contained ranks of cement vats where the anthrax was grown. Those had been cracked and filled in, and the heavy doors removed; but it would have been too much work to fill the bunkers in entirely. He poked his nose into the first in line\u2014Building 241\u2014and saw a flat stretch of water leading into darkness. \u201cExcellent. This job just gets worse. We may be wading.\u201d\n\u201cBut what are you looking for?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014oh.\u201d As he rounded the mound of Building 242, a small clutch of hummers and trucks came into view. They\u2019d been invisible from the road. There was still no sign of anybody, so he headed for Bunker 242. As he was walking down the crumbled ramp to the massive doors, he heard the unmistakable sound of a rifle-bolt being slipped. \u201cBetter not go in there,\u201d somebody said in Russian.\nHe looked carefully up and to his left. A young woman had come over the top of the mound. She was holding the rifle, and she had it aimed directly at Gennady.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she said. She had a local accent.\n\u201cExploring, is all,\u201d said Gennady. \u201cWe\u2019d heard of the old anthrax factory, and thought we\u2019d take a look at it. This is public land.\u201d\nShe swore, and Gennady heard footsteps behind him. Ambrose looked deeply frightened as two large men\u2014also carrying rifles\u2014emerged from behind a plastic membrane that had been stretched across the bunker\u2019s doorway. Both men wore bright yellow fireman\u2019s masks, and had air tanks on their backs.\n\u201cWhen are your masters going to believe that we\u2019re doing what we say?\u201d said the woman. \u201cCome on.\u201d She gestured with her rifle for Gennady and Ambrose to walk down the ramp.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dead, we\u2019re dead,\u201d whimpered Ambrose. He was shivering.\n\u201cIf you really must have your proof, then put these on.\u201d She nodded to the two men, who stripped off their masks and tanks and handed them to Gennady and Ambrose. They pushed past the plastic membrane and into the bunker.\nThe place was full of light: a crimson, blood-red radiance that made the sight of what was inside all the more bizarre.\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d muttered Ambrose. \u201cIt\u2019s a grow-op.\u201d\nThe long, low space was filled from floor to ceiling with plants. Surrounded them on tall stands were hundreds of red LED lamp banks. In the lurid light, the plants appeared black. He squinted at the nearest, fully expecting to see a familiar, jagged-leaf profile. Instead\u2014\n\u201cTomatoes?\u201d\n\u201cTwo facts for you,\u201d said the woman, her voice muffled. She\u2019d set down her rifle, and now held up two fingers. \u201cOne: we\u2019re not stepping on anybody else\u2019s toes here. We are not competing with you. And two: this bunker is designed to withstand a twenty kilotonne blast. If you think you can muscle your way in here and take it over, you\u2019re sadly mistaken.\u201d\nGennady finally realized what they\u2019d assumed. \u201cWe\u2019re not the mafia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to inspect the utilities.\u201d\nShe blinked at him, her features owlish behind the yellow frame of the mask. Ambrose rolled his eyes. \u201cOh God, what did you say?\u201d\n\u201cAmerican?\u201d Puzzled, she lowered her rifle. In English, she said, \u201cYou spoke English.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Ambrose, \u201cwell\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe did,\u201d said Gennady, also in English. \u201cWe\u2019re not with the mafia, we\u2019re arms inspectors. I mean, I am. He\u2019s just along for the ride.\u201d\n\u201cArms inspectors?\u201d She guffawed, then looked around herself at the stolid Soviet bunker they were standing in. \u201cWhat, you thought\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think anything. Can I lower my hands now?\u201d She thought about it, then nodded. Gennady rolled his neck and then nodded at the ranked plants. \u201cNice setup. Tomatoes, soy, and those long tanks contain potatoes? But why in here, when you\u2019ve got a thousand kilometers of steppe outside to plant this stuff?\u201d\n\u201cWe can control the atmosphere in here,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the masks: it\u2019s a high CO2 environment in here. That\u2019s also why I stopped you in the first place; if you\u2019d just strolled right in, you\u2019d have dropped dead from asphyxia.\n\u201cThis project\u2019s part of minus three,\u201d she continued. \u201cHave you heard of us?\u201d Both Ambrose and Gennady shook their heads.\n\u201cWell, you will.\u201d There was pride in her voice. \u201cYou see, right now humanity uses the equivalent of three Earth\u2019s worth of ecological resources. We\u2019re pioneering techniques to reduce that reliance by the same amount.\u201d\n\u201cSame amount? To zero Earths?\u201d He didn\u2019t hide the incredulity in his voice.\n\u201cEventually, yes. We steal most of what we need from the Earth in the form of ecosystem services. What we need is to figure out how to run a full-fledged industrial civilization as if there were no ecosystem services available to us at all. To live on Earth,\u201d she finished triumphantly, \u201cas if we were living on Mars.\u201d\nAmbrose jerked in visible surprise.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fascinating,\u201d said Gennady. He hadn\u2019t been too nervous while they were pointing guns at him\u2014he\u2019d had that happen before, and in such moments his mind became wonderfully sharp\u2014but now that he might actually be forced to have a conversation with these people, he found his mouth going quite dry. \u201cYou can tell me all about it after I\u2019ve finished my measurements.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not kidding at all. Your job may be saving the Earth within the next generation, but mine is saving it this week. And I take it very seriously. I\u2019ve come here to inspect the original fittings of this building, but it looks like you destroyed them, no?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, we used what was here. This bunker\u2019s not like the other ones, you know they had these big cement tanks in them. I\u2019d swear this one was set up exactly like this.\u201d\n\u201cShow me.\u201d\nFor the next half hour they climbed under the hydroponic tables, behind the makeshift junction boxes mounted near the old power shaft, and atop the sturdier lighting racks. Ambrose went outside, and came back to report that the shipping containers they\u2019d seen were sophisticated CO2 scrubbers. The big boxes sucked the gas right out of the atmosphere, and then pumped it through hoses into the bunker.\nAt last he and the woman climbed down, and Gennady shook his head. \u201cThe mystery only deepens,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t help you more,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd apologies for pulling a gun on you. \u2014I\u2019m Kyzdygoi,\u201d she added, thrusting out her hand for him to shake.\n\u201cUh, that\u2019s a . . . pretty name,\u201d said Ambrose as he too shook her hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s it mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt means \u2018stop giving birth to girls,\u2019\u201d said Kyzdygoi with a straight face. \u201cMy parents were old school.\u201d\nAmbrose opened his mouth and closed it, his grin faltering.\n\u201cAll right, well, good luck shrinking your Earths,\u201d Gennady told her as they strolled to the plastic-sheet-covered doorway.\nAs they drove back to Stepnogorsk, Ambrose leaned against the Tata\u2019s door and looked at Gennady in silence. Finally he said, \u201cYou do this for a living?\u201d\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s unreliable. A paycheck here, a paycheck there . . . \u201d\n\u201cNo, really. What\u2019s this all about?\u201d\nGennady eyed him. He probably owed the kid an explanation after getting guns drawn on him. \u201cHave you ever heard of metastable explosives?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No. Wait . . . \u201d He fumbled for his glasses.\n\u201cNever mind that.\u201d Gennady waved at the glasses. \u201cMetastables are basically super-powerful chemical explosives. They\u2019re my new nightmare.\u201d\nAmbrose jerked a thumb back at SNOPB. \u201cI thought you were looking for germs.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about germs, it\u2019s about hydrogen bombs.\u201d Ambrose looked blank. \u201cA hydrogen bomb is a fusion device that\u2019s triggered by high compression and high temperature. Up til now, the only thing that could generate those kinds of conditions was an atomic bomb\u2014a plutonium bomb, understand? Plutonium is really hard to refine, and it creates terrible fallout even if you only use a little of it as your fusion trigger.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cSo, metastable explosives are powerful enough to trigger hydrogen fusion without the plutonium. They completely sever the connection between nuclear weapons and nuclear industry, which means that once they exist, we good guys totally lose our ability to tell who has the bomb and who doesn\u2019t. Anybody who can get metastables and some tritium gas can build a hydrogen bomb, even some disgruntled loner in his garage.\n\u201cAnd somebody is building one.\u201d\nStepnogorsk was fast approaching. The town was mostly a collection of Soviet-era apartment blocks with broad prairie visible past them. Gennady swung them around a corner and they drove through Microdistrict 2 and past the disused Palace of Culture. Up ahead was their hotel . . . surrounded by the flashing lights of emergency vehicles.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Gennady. \u201cA fire?\u201d\n\u201cPull over. Pull over!\u201d Ambrose braced his hands against the Tata\u2019s low ceiling. Gennady shot him a look, but did as he\u2019d asked.\n\u201cShit. They\u2019ve found me.\u201d\n\u201cWho? Those are police cars. I\u2019ve been with you every minute since we got here, there\u2019s no way you could have gotten into any trouble.\u201d Gennady shook his head. \u201cNo, if it\u2019s anything to do with us, it\u2019s probably Kyzdygoi\u2019s people sending us a message.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Then who are those suits with the cops?\u201d\nGennady thought about it. He could simply walk up to one of the cops and ask, but figured Ambrose would probably have a coronary if he did that.\n\u201cWell . . . there is one thing we can try. But it\u2019ll cost a lot.\u201d\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\nGennady eyed him. \u201cAll right, all right,\u201d said Ambrose. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d\n\u201cYou just watch.\u201d Gennady put on his glasses and stepped out of the car. As he did, he put through a call to London, where it was still early morning. \u201cHello? Lisaveta? It\u2019s Gennady. Hi! How are you?\u201d\nHe\u2019d brought a binocular attachment for the glasses, which he sometimes used for reading serial numbers on pipes or barrels from a distance. He clipped this on and began scanning the small knot of men who were standing around outside the hotel\u2019s front doors.\n\u201cListen, Lisa, can I ask you to do something for me? I have some faces I need scanned. . . . Not even remotely legal, I\u2019m sure. . . . No, I\u2019m not in trouble! Would I be on the phone to you if I were in trouble? Just\u2014okay. I\u2019m good for it. Here come the images.\u201d\nHe relayed the feed from his glasses to Lisa in her flat in London.\n\u201cWho\u2019re you talking to?\u201d asked Ambrose.\n\u201cOld friend. She got me out of Chernobyl intact when I had a little problem with a dragon\u2014 Lisa? Got it? Great. Call me back when you\u2019ve done the analysis.\u201d\nHe pocketed the glasses and climbed back in the car. \u201cLisa has Interpol connections, and she\u2019s a fantastic hacker. She\u2019ll run facial recognition on it and hopefully tell us who those people are.\u201d\nAmbrose cringed back in his seat. \u201cSo what do we do in the meantime?\u201d\n\u201cWe have lunch. How \u2019bout that French restaurant we passed? The one with the little Eiffel Tower?\u201d\nDespite the clear curbs everywhere, Gennady parked the car at the shopping mall and walked the three blocks to the La France. He didn\u2019t tell Ambrose why, but the American would figure it out: the Tata was traceable through its GPS. Luckily La France was open and they settled in for some decent crepes. Gennady had a nice view of a line of trees west of the town boundary. Occasionally a car drove past.\nLisa pinged him as they were settling up. \u201cGennady? I got some hits for you.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d He hadn\u2019t expected her to turn up anything. Gennady\u2019s working assumption was that Ambrose was just being paranoid.\n\u201cNothing off the cops; they must be local,\u201d she said. \u201cBut one guy\u2014the old man\u2014well, it\u2019s daft.\u201d\nHe sighed in disappointment, and Ambrose shot him a look. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\u201cHis name is Alexei Egorov. He\u2019s premier of a virtual nation called the Soviet Union Online. They started from this project to digitize all the existing paper records of the Soviet era. Once those were online, Egorov and his people started some deep data-mining to construct a virtual Soviet, and then they started inviting the last die-hard Stalinists\u2014or their kids\u2014to join. It\u2019s a virtual country composed of bitter old men who\u2019re nostalgic for the purges. Daft.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Lisa. I\u2019ll wire you the fee.\u201d\nHe glowered at Ambrose. \u201cTell me about Soviet Union.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh come on. Who said that? Whoever they are, they\u2019re on the far side of the planet right now, they can\u2019t help you. They put you with me, but I can\u2019t help you either if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nAmbrose\u2019s lips thinned to a white line. He leaned forward. \u201cIt\u2019s big,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCan\u2019t be bigger than my metatables. Tell me: what did you see on Mars?\u201d\nAmbrose hesitated. Then he blurted, \u201cA pyramid.\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cReally, a pyramid,\u201d Ambrose insisted. \u201cBig sucker, gray, I think most of it was buried in the permafrost. It was the only thing sticking up for miles. This was on the Northern plains, where there\u2019s ice just under the surface. The whole area around it . . . well, it was like a frozen splash, if you know what I mean. Almost a crater.\u201d\nThis was just getting more and more disappointing. \u201cAnd why is Soviet Union Online after you?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the pyramid had Russian writing on it. Just four letters, in red: CCCP.\u201d\nThe next silence went on for a while, and was punctuated only by the sound of other diners grumbling about local carbon prices.\n\u201cI leaked some photos before Google came after me with their non-disclosure agreements,\u201d Ambrose explained. \u201cI guess the Soviets have internet search-bots constantly searching for certain things, and they picked up on my posts before Google was able to take them down. I got a couple of threatening phone calls from men with thick Slavic accents. Then they tried to kidnap me.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d\nAmbrose grimaced. \u201cWell, they weren\u2019t very good at it. It was four guys, all of them must have been in their eighties, they tried to bundle me into a black van. I ran away and they just stood there yelling curses at me in Russian. One of them threw his cane at me.\u201d He rubbed his ankle.\n\u201cAnd you took them seriously?\u201d\n\u201cI did when the FBI showed up and told me I had to pack up and go with them. That\u2019s when I ran to the U.N. I didn\u2019t believe that \u2018witness protection\u2019 crap the Feds tried to feed me. The U.N. people told me that the Soviets\u2019 data mining is actually really good. They keep turning up embarrassing and incriminating information about what people and governments got up to back in the days of the Cold War. They use what they know to influence people.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s bizarre.\u201d He thought about it. \u201cThink they bought off the police here?\u201d\n\u201cOr somebody. They want to know about the pyramid. But only Google, and the Feds, and I know where it is. And NASA\u2019s already patched that part of the Mars panoramas with fake data.\u201d\nDisappointment had turned to a deep sense of surprise. For Gennady, being surprised usually meant that something awful was about to happen; so he said, \u201cWe need to get you out of town.\u201d\nAmbrose brightened. \u201cI have an idea. Let\u2019s go back to SNOPB. I looked up these -3 people, they\u2019re eco-radicals but at least they don\u2019t seem to be lunatics.\u201d\n\u201cHmmph. You just think Kyzdygoi\u2019s \u2018hot.\u2019\u201d Ambrose grinned and shrugged.\n\u201cOkay. \u2014But we\u2019re not driving, because the car can be tracked. You walk there. It\u2019s only a few kilometers. I\u2019ll deal with the authorities and these \u2018Soviets,\u2019 and once I\u2019ve sent them on their way we\u2019ll meet up. You\u2019ve got my number.\u201d\nAmbrose had evidently never taken a walk in the country before. After Gennady convinced him he would survive it, they parted outside La France, and Gennady watched him walk away, sneakers flapping. He shook his head and strolled back to the Tata.\nFive men were waiting for him. Two were policemen, and three wore business attire. One of these was an old, bald man in a faded olive-green suit. He wore augmented reality glasses, and there was a discrete red pin on his lapel in the shape of the old Soviet flag.\nGennady made a show of pushing his own glasses back on his nose and walked forward, hand out. As the cops started to reach for their tasers, Gennady said, \u201cMr. Egorov! Gennady Malianov, IAEA. You\u2019ll forgive me if I record and upload this conversation to headquarters?\u201d He tapped the frame of his glasses and turned to the other suits. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch your names?\u201d\nThe suits frowned; the policemen hesitated; Egorov, however, put out his hand and Gennady shook it firmly. He could feel the old man\u2019s bones shift in his grip, but Egorov didn\u2019t grimace. Instead he said, \u201cWhere\u2019s your companion?\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that American? No idea. We shared a hotel room because it was cheaper, but then we parted ways this morning.\u201d\nEgorov took his hand back, and pressed his bruised knuckles against his hip. \u201cYou\u2019ve no idea where he is?\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d asked one of the cops.\n\u201cInspecting SNOPB,\u201d he said. Gennady didn\u2019t have to fake his confidence here; he felt well armored by his affiliation to Frankl\u2019s people. \u201cMy credentials are online, if there\u2019s some sort of issue here?\u201d\n\u201cNo issue,\u201d muttered Egorov. He turned away, and as he did a discrete icon lit up in the corner of Gennady\u2019s heads-up display. Egorov had sent him a text message.\nHe hadn\u2019t been massaging his hand on his flank; he\u2019d been texting through his pants. Gennady had left the server in his glasses open, so it would have been easy for Egorov to ping it and find his address.\nIn among all the other odd occurrences of the past couple of days, this one didn\u2019t stand out. But as Gennady watched Egorov and his policemen retreat, he realized that his assumption that Egorov had been in charge might be wrong. Who were those other two suits?\nHe waited for Egorov\u2019s party to drive away, then got in the Tata and opened the email.\nIt said, Mt tnght Pavin Inn, rstrnt wshrm. Cm aln.\nGennady puzzled over those last two words for a while. Then he got it. \u201cCome alone!\u201d Ah. He should have known.\nShaking his head, he pulled out of the lot and headed back to the hotel to check out. After loading his bag, and Ambrose\u2019s, into the Tata, he hit the road back to SNOPB. Nobody followed him, but that meant nothing since they could track him through the car\u2019s transponder if they wanted. It hardly mattered; he was supposed to be inspecting the old anthrax factory, so where else would he be going?\nAmbrose\u2019d had enough time to get to SNOPB by now, but Gennady kept one eye on the fields next to the road just in case. He saw nobody, and fully expected to find the American waiting outside Building 242 as he pulled up.\nAs he stepped out of the Tata he nearly twisted his ankle in a deep rut. There were fresh tire tracks and shattered bits of old asphalt all over the place; he was sure he hadn\u2019t seen them this morning.\n\u201cHello?\u201d He walked down the ramp into the sudden dark of the bunker. Did he have the right building? It was completely dark here.\nWires drooled from overhead conduits; hydroponic trays lay jumbled in the corner, and strange-smelling liquids were pooled on the floor. -3 had pulled out, and in a hurry.\nHe cursed, but suppressed an urge to run back to the car. He had no idea where they\u2019d gone, and they had a head-start on him. The main question was, had they left before or after Ambrose showed up?\nThe answer lay in the yellow grass near where -3\u2019s vehicles had been parked that morning. Gennady knelt down and picked up a familiar pair of augmented reality glasses. Ambrose would not have left these behind willingly.\nGennady swore, and now he did run to the Tata.\nThe restaurant at the Pavin Inn was made up to look like the interiors of a row of yurts. This gave diners some privacy as most of them had private little chambers under wood-ribbed ceilings; it also broke up the eye-lines to the place\u2019s front door, making it easy for Gennady to slip past the two men in suits who\u2019d been with Egorov in the parking lot. He entered the men\u2019s room to find Egorov pacing in front of the urinal trough.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d demanded Gennady\u2014but Egorov made a shushing motion and grabbed a trash can. As he upended it under the bathroom\u2019s narrow window, he said, \u201cFirst you must get me out of here!\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\nEgorov tried to climb onto the upended can, but his knees and hips weren\u2019t flexible enough. Finally Gennady relented and went to help him. As he boosted the old comrade, Egorov said, \u201cI am a prisoner of these people! They work for the Americans.\u201d He practically spat the name. He perched precariously on the can and began tugging at the latch to the window. \u201cThey have seized our database! All the Soviet records . . . including what we know about the Tsarina.\u201d\nGennady coughed. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the car around.\u201d\nHe helped Egorov through the window then, after making sure no one was looking, left through the hotel\u2019s front door. The unmistakable silhouette of Egorov was limping into the parking lot. Gennady followed him and, as he unlocked the Tata, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve disabled the GPS tracking in this car. It\u2019s a rental; I\u2019m going to drop it off in Semey, which is six hundred kilometers from here. Are you sure you\u2019re up to a drive like that?\u201d\nThe old man\u2019s eyes glinted under yellow street light. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d get a chance to see the steppes again. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\nGennady felt a ridiculous surge of adrenalin as they bumped out of the parking lot. Two cars were on the road, and endless blackness swallowed the landscape beyond the edge of town. It was a simple matter to swing onto the highway and leave Stepnogorsk behind\u2014but it felt like a car chase.\n\u201cHa ha!\u201d Egorov craned his neck to look back at the dwindling town lights. \u201cSemey, eh? You\u2019re going to Semipalatinsk, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cTo look at the Tsarina site, yes. Whose side does that put me on?\u201d\n\u201cSides?\u201d Egorov crossed his arms and glared out the windshield. \u201cI don\u2019t know about sides.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an honest question.\u201d\n\u201cI believe you. But I don\u2019t know. Except for them,\u201d he added, jabbing a thumb back at the town. \u201cI know they\u2019re bad guys.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? And why are they interested in Ambrose?\u201d\n\u201cSame reason we are. Because of what he saw.\u201d\nGennady took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. Why don\u2019t you just tell me what you know? And I\u2019ll do the same?\u201d\n\u201cYes, all right.\u201d The utter blackness of the night-time steppe had swallowed them; all that was visible was the double-cone of roadway visible in the car\u2019s headlamps. It barely changed, moment to moment, giving the drive a timelessness Gennady would, under other circumstances, have quite enjoyed.\n\u201cWe data-mine records from the Soviet era,\u201d began Egorov. \u201cTo find out what really went on. It\u2019s lucrative business, and it supports the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Online.\u201d He tapped his glasses.\n\u201cWell, a few weeks ago, we got a request for some of the old data\u2014from the Americans. Two requests, actually, a day apart: one from the search engine company, and the other from the government. We were naturally curious, so we didn\u2019t say no; but we did a little digging into the data ourselves. \u2014That is, we\u2019d started to, when those young, grim men burst into our offices and confiscated the server. And the backup.\u201d\nGennady looked askance at him. \u201cReally? Where was this?\u201d\n\u201cUm. Seattle. That\u2019s where the CCCOP is based\u2014only because we\u2019ve been banned in the old country! Russia\u2019s run by robber barons today, they have no regard for the glory of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes yes. Did you find out what they were looking for?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014which is how I ended up with these travel companions you saw. They are in the pay of the American CIA.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but why? What does this have to do with the Tsarina?\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping you could tell me. All we found was appropriations for strange things that should never have had anything to do with a nuclear test. Before the Tsarina was set off, there was about a year of heavy construction at the site. Sometimes, you know, they built fake towns to blow them up and examine the blast damage. That\u2019s what I thought at first; they ordered thousands of tonnes of concrete, rebar and asbestos, that sort of thing. But if you look at the records after the test, there\u2019s no sign of where any of that material went.\u201d\n\u201cThey ordered some sort of agricultural crop from SNOPB,\u201d Gennady ventured. Egorov nodded.\n\u201cNone of the discrepancies would ever have been noticed if not for your friend and whatever it is he found. What was it, anyway?\u201d\nA strange suspicion had begun to form in Gennady\u2019s mind, but it was so unlikely that he shook his head. \u201cI want to look at the Tsarina site,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019ll tell us.\u201d\nEgorov was obviously unsatisfied with that answer, but he said nothing, merely muttering and trying to get himself comfortable in the Tata\u2019s bucket seat. After a while, just as the hum of the dark highway was starting to hypnotize Gennady, Egorov said, \u201cIt\u2019s all gone to hell, you know.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cRussia. It was hard in the old days, but at least we had our pride.\u201d He turned to look out the black window. \u201cAfter 1990, all the life just went out of the place. Lower birthrate, men drinking themselves to death by the age of forty . . . no ambition, no hope. A lost land.\u201d\n\u201cYou left?\u201d\n\u201cPhysically, yes.\u201d Egorov darted a look at Gennady. \u201cYou never leave. Not a place like this. For many years now, I\u2019ve struggled with how to bring back Russia\u2019s old glory\u2014our sense of pride. Yet the best I was ever able to come up with was an online environment. A game.\u201d He spat the word contemptuously.\nGennady didn\u2019t reply, but he knew how Egorov felt. Ukraine had some of the same problems\u2014the listless lack of direction, the loss of confidence . . . It wasn\u2019t getting any better here. He thought of the blasted steppes they were passing through, rendered unlivable by global warming. There had been massive forest fires in Siberia this year, and the Gobi desert was expanding north and west, threatening the Kazaks even as the Caspian sea dwindled down to nothing.\nHe thought of SNOPB. \u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they left their trash behind.\u201d Toxic, decaying: nuclear submarines heeled over in the waters off of Murmansk, nitrates soaking the soil around the launch pads of Baikonur. The ghosts of old Soviets prowled this dark, in the form of radiation in the groundwater, mutations in the forest, and poisons in the dust clouds that were all too common these days. Gennady had spent his whole adult life cleaning up the mess, and before yesterday he\u2019d been able to tell himself that it was working\u2014that all the worst nightmares were from the past. The metastables had changed that, in one stroke rendering all the old fears laughable in comparison.\n\u201cGet some sleep,\u201d he told Egorov. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be driving all night.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t sleep much anymore.\u201d But the old man stopped talking, and just stared ahead. He couldn\u2019t be visiting his online People\u2019s Republic through his glasses, because those IP addresses were blocked here. But maybe he saw it all anyway\u2014the brave young men in their trucks, heading to the Semipalatinsk site to witness a nuclear blast; the rail yards where parts for the giant moon rocket, doomed to explode on the pad, were mustering . . . With his gaze fixed firmly on the past, he seemed the perfect opposite of Ambrose with his American dreams of a new world unburdened by history, whose red dunes marched to a pure and mysterious horizon.\nThe first living thing in space had been the Russian dog Laika. She had died in orbit\u2014had never come home. If he glanced out at the star-speckled sky, Gennady could almost see her ghost racing eternally through the heavens, beside the dead dream of planetary conquest, of flags planted in alien soil and shining domes on the hills of Mars.\nThey arrived at the Tsarina site at 4:30: dawn, at this latitude and time of year. The Semipalatinsk Polygon was bare, flat, blasted scrubland: Mars with tufts of dead weed. The irony was that it hadn\u2019t been the hundreds of nuclear bombs set off here that had killed the land; even a decade after the Polygon was closed, the low rolling hills had been covered with a rich carpet of waving grass. Instead, it was the savage turn of the climate, completely unpredicted by the KGB and the CIA, that had killed the steppe.\nThe road into the Polygon was narrow blacktop with no real shoulder, no ditches, and no oncoming traffic\u2014though a set of lights had faded in and out of view in the rearview mirror all through the drive. Gennady would have missed the turnoff to the Tsarina site had his glasses not beeped.\nThere had been a low wire fence here at one time, but nobody had kept it up. He drove straight over the fallen gate, which was becoming one with the soil, and up a low rise to the crest of the water-filled crater. There he parked and got out.\nEgorov climbed out too and stretched cautiously. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he said, gazing into the epic sunrise. \u201cIs it radioactive here?\u201d\n\u201cOh, a little . . . That\u2019s odd.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nGennady had looked at the satellite view of the site on the way here; it was clear, standing here in person, that that vertical perspective lied. \u201cThe Tsarina was supposed to be an underground test. You usually get some subsidence of the ground in a circle around the test site. And with the big ground shots, you would get a crater, like Lake Chagan,\u201d he nodded to the east. \u201cBut this . . . this is a hole.\u201d\nEgorov spat into it. \u201cIt certainly is.\u201d The walls of the Tsarina crater were sheer and went down a good fifty feet to black water. The \u201ccrater\u201d wasn\u2019t round, either, but square, and it wasn\u2019t nearly big enough to be the result of a surface explosion. If he hadn\u2019t known it was the artifact of a bomb blast, Gennady would have sworn he was looking at a flooded quarry.\nGennady gathered his equipment and began combing the grass around the site. After a minute he found some twisted chunks of concrete and metal, and knelt down to inspect them.\nEgorov came up behind him. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d\n\u201cSerial numbers.\u201d He quickly found some old, grayed stenciling on a half-buried tank made of greenish metal. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said as he pinched the arm of his glasses to take a snapshot. \u201cI\u2019m checking our database . . . Hmpf.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Egorov shifted from foot to foot. He was glancing around, as if afraid they might be interrupted.\n\u201cThis piece came from the smaller of the installations here. The one the Americans called URDF-3.\u201d\n\u201cURDF?\u201d Egorov blinked at him.\n\u201cStands for \u2018Unidentified Research and Development Facility.\u2019 The stuff they built there scared the Yankees even more than the H-bomb . . . \u201d\nHe stood up, frowning, and slowly turned to look at the entire site. \u201cSomething\u2019s been bothering me,\u201d he said as he walked to the very edge of the giant pit.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Egorov was hanging back.\n\u201cAmbrose told me he saw a pyramid on Mars. It said CCCP on its side. That was all; so he knew it was Russian, and so did Google and the CIA when they found out about it. And you, too.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s all anybody knew. So who made the connection between the pyramid and the Tsarina?\u201d\nEgorov didn\u2019t reply. Gennady turned and found that the old man had drawn himself up very straight, and had leveled a small, nasty-looking pistol at him.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t follow us to Stepnogorsk,\u201d said Gennady. \u201cYou were already there.\u201d\n\u201cTake off your glasses,\u201d said Egorov. \u201cCarefully, so I can be sure you\u2019re not snapping another picture.\u201d\nAs Gennady reached up to comply he felt the soft soil at the lip of the pit start to crumble. \u201cAh, can we\u2014\u201d It was too late, he toppled backward, arms flailing.\nHe had an instant\u2019s choice: roll down the slope, or jump and hope he\u2019d hit the water. He jumped.\nThe cold hit him so hard that at first he thought he\u2019d been shot. Swearing and gasping, he surfaced, but when he spotted Egorov\u2019s silhouette at the crest of the pit, dove again.\nMorning sunlight was just tipping into the water. At first Gennady thought the wall of the pit was casting a dark shadow across the sediment below him. Gradually he realized the truth: there was no bottom to this shaft. At least, none within easy diving distance.\nHe swam to the opposite side; he couldn\u2019t stay down here, he\u2019d freeze. Defeated, he flung himself out of the freezing water onto hard clay that was probably radioactive. Rolling over, he looked up.\nEgorov stood on the lip of the pit. Next to him was a young woman with a rifle in her hands.\nGennady sat up. \u201cShit.\u201d\nKyzdygoi slung the rifle over her back, then clambered down the slope to the shore. As she picked her way over to Gennady she said, \u201cHow much do you know?\u201d\n\u201cEverything,\u201d he said between coughs. \u201cI know everything. Where\u2019s Ambrose?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s safe,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nThen she waited, rifle cradled. \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d he said reluctantly, \u201cwhich tells me that -3 was funded by the Soviets. Your job was never to clean up the Earth\u2014it was to design life support and agricultural systems for a Mars colony.\u201d\nHer mouth twitched, but she didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cHow could we possibly get to Mars? The sky\u2019s a shooting gallery.\u201d\n\u201c . . . And that would be a problem if you were going up there in a dinky little aluminum can, like cosmonauts always did.\u201d He stood up, joints creaking from the cold. He was starting to shiver deeply and it was hard to speak past his chattering teeth. \u201cB-but if you rode a c-concrete bunker into orbit, you could ignore the shrapnel c-completely. In fact, that would be the only way you could d-do it.\u201d\n\u201cCome now. How could something like that ever get off the ground?\u201d\n\u201cThe same way the Tsarina d-did.\u201d He nodded at the dark surface of the flooded shaft. \u201cThe Americans had their P-project Orion. The Soviets had a similar program based at URDF-3. Both had discovered that an object could be just a few meters away from a nuclear explosion, and if it was made of the right materials it wouldn\u2019t be destroyed\u2014it would be shot away like a bullet from a gun. The Americans designed a spaceship that would drop atomic bombs out the back and ride the explosions to orbit. But the Tsarina wasn\u2019t like that . . . it was just one bomb, and a d-deep shaft, and a pyramid-shaped spaceship to ride that explosion. That design\u2019s something called a Verne gun.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who else knows this?\u201d\nHe hesitated. \u201cN-no one,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t know until I saw the shaft just now. The p-pyramid was fitted into the mouth of it, right about where we\u2019re s-standing. That\u2019s why this doesn\u2019t look like any other bomb crater on Earth.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said, gesturing with the rifle. \u201cYou\u2019re turning blue.\u201d\n\u201cY-you\u2019re not going t-to sh-shoot me?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d she said gently. \u201cIn a few days, the whole world will know what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\nGennady finished taping aluminum foil to the trailer\u2019s window. Taking a push-pin from the cork board by the door, he carefully pricked a single tiny hole in the foil.\nIt was night, and crickets were chirping outside. Gennady wasn\u2019t tied up\u2014in fact, he was perfectly free to leave\u2014but on his way out the door Egorov had said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go outside in the next hour or so. After that . . . well, wait for the dust to settle.\u201d\nThey\u2019d driven him about fifty kilometers to the south and into an empty part of the Polygon. When Gennady had asked why this place, Egorov had laughed. \u201cThe Soviets set off their bombs here because this was the last empty place on Earth. It\u2019s still the last empty place, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\nThere was nothing here but the withered steppe, a hundred or so trucks, vans and buses, and the cranes, tanks and pole-sheds of a temporary construction site. \u2014And, towering over the sheds, a gray concrete pyramid.\n\u201cA Verne gun fires its cargo into orbit in a single shot,\u201d Egorov had told Gennady. \u201cIt generates thousands of gravities worth of acceleration\u2014enough to turn you into a smear on the floor. That\u2019s why the Soviets couldn\u2019t send any people; they hadn\u2019t figured out how to set off a controlled sequence of little bombs. The Americans never perfected that either. They didn\u2019t have the computational power to do the simulations.\n\u201cSo they sent everything but the people. Two hundred eighty thousand tonnes in one shot, to Mars.\u201d\nBulldozers and cranes, fuel tanks, powdered cement, bags of seeds and food, space suits, even a complete, dismantled nuclear reactor: the Tsarina had included everything potential colonists might need on a new world. Its builders knew it had gone up, knew it had gotten to Mars; but they didn\u2019t know where it had landed, or whether it had landed intact.\nA day after his visit to the Tsarina site, Gennady had sat outside this trailer with Egorov, Kyzdygoi and a few other officials of the new Soviet. They\u2019d drunk a few beers and talked about the plan. \u201cWhen our data-mining turned up the Tsarina\u2019s manifest, it was like a light from heaven,\u201d Egorov had said, his hands opening eloquently in the firelight. \u201cSuddenly we saw what was possible, how to revive our people\u2014all the world\u2019s people\u2014around a new hope, after all hope had gone. Something that would combine Apollo and Trinity into one event, and suddenly both would take on the meaning they always needed to have.\u201d\nEgorov had started a crash program to build an Orion rocket. They couldn\u2019t get fissionable materials\u2014Gennady and his people had locked those up tightly and for all time. But the metastables promised a different approach.\n\u201cWe hoped the Tsarina was on Mars and intact, but we didn\u2019t know for sure, until Ambrose leaked his pictures.\u201d\nThe new Tsarina would use a series of small, clean fusion blasts to lift off and, at the far end, to land again. Thanks to Ambrose, they knew where the Tsarina was. It didn\u2019t matter that the Americans did too; nobody else had a plan to get there.\n\u201cAnd by the time they get their acts together, we\u2019ll have built a city,\u201d said Kyzdygoi. She was wide-eyed with the power of the idea. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not going there two at a time, like Noah in his Ark. We\u2019re all going.\u201d And she swung her arm to indicate the hundreds of campfires burning all around them, where thousands of men, women and children, hand-picked from among the citizens of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Online, waited to amaze the world.\nGennady hunkered down in a little fort he\u2019d built out of seat cushions, and waited.\nIt was like a camera flash, and a second later there was a second, then a third, and then the whole trailer bounced into the air and everything Gennady\u2019s hadn\u2019t tied down went tumbling. The windows shattered and he landed on cushions and found himself staring across suddenly open air at the immolation of the building site.\nThe flickering flashes continued, coming from above now. The pyramid was gone, and the cranes and heavy machinery lay tumbled like a child\u2019s toys, all burning.\nFlash. Flash.\nIt was really happening.\nFlash. Flash. Flash . . .\nGradually, Gennady began to be able to hear again. He came to realize that monstrous thunder was rolling across the steppe, like a god\u2019s drumbeat in time with the flashes. It faded, as the flashes faded, until there was nothing but the ringing in his ears, and the orange flicker of flame from the launch site.\nHe staggered out to find perfect devastation. Once, this must once have been a common sight on the steppe; but his Geiger counter barely registered any radiation at all.\n\u2014And in that, of course, lay a terrible irony. Egorov and his people had indeed divided history in two, but not in the way they\u2019d imagined.\nGennady ran for the command trailer. He only had a few minutes before the air forces of half a dozen nations descended on this place. The trailer had survived the initial blast, so he scrounged until he found a jerry-can full of gasoline, and then he climbed in.\nThere they were: Egorov\u2019s servers. The EMP from the little nukes might have wiped its drives, but Gennady couldn\u2019t take the chance. He poured gasoline all over the computers, made a trail back to the door, then as the whole trailer went up behind him, ran to the leaning-but-intact metal shed where the metastables had been processed, and he did the same to it.\nThat afternoon, as he and Egorov were watching the orderly queue of people waiting to enter the New Tsarina, Gennady had made his final plea. \u201cYour research into metastables,\u201d Gennady went on. \u201cI need it. All of it, and the equipment and the backups; anything that might be used to reconstruct what you did.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens to the Earth is no longer our concern,\u201d Egorov said with a frown. \u201cHumanity made a mess here. It\u2019s not up to us to clean it up.\u201d\n\u201cBut to destroy it all, you only need to be indifferent! And I\u2019m asking, please, however much the world may have disappointed you, don\u2019t leave it like this.\u201d As he spoke, Gennady scanned the line of people for Ambrose, but couldn\u2019t see him. Nobody had said where the young American was.\nEgorov had sighed in annoyance, then nodded sharply. \u201cI\u2019ll have all the formulae and the equipment gathered together. It\u2019s all I have time for, now. You can do what you want with it.\u201d\nGennady watched the flames twist into the sky. He was exhausted, and the sky was full of contrails and gathering lights. He hadn\u2019t destroyed enough of the evidence; surely, someone would figure out what Egorov\u2019s people had done. And then . . . Shoulders slumped under the burden of that knowledge, he stalked into the darkness at the camp\u2019s perimeter.\nHis rented Tata sat where they\u2019d left it when they first arrived here. After Kyzdygoi had confiscated his glasses at the Tsarina site, she\u2019d put them in the Tata\u2019s glove compartment. They were still there.\nBefore Gennady put them on, he took a last unaided look at the burning campsite. Egorov and his people had escaped, but they\u2019d left Gennady behind to clean up their mess. The metastables would be back. This new nightmare would get out of the bottle eventually, and when it did, the traditional specter of nuclear terrorism would look like a Halloween ghost in comparison. Could even the conquest of another world make up for that?\nAs the choppers settled in whipping spirals of dust, Gennady rolled up the Tata\u2019s window and put on his glasses. The New Tsarina\u2019s EMP pulses hadn\u2019t killed them\u2014they booted up right away. And, seconds after they did, a little flag told him there was an email waiting for him.\nIt was from Ambrose, and it read:\nGennady: sorry I didn\u2019t have time to say goodbye.\nI just wanted to say I was wrong. Anything\u2019s possible, even for me.\nP.S. My room\u2019s going to have a fantastic view.\nGennady stared bitterly at the words. Anything\u2019s possible . . .\n\u201cFor you, maybe,\u201d he said as soldiers piled out of the choppers.\n\u201cNot me.\u201d\nOriginally published in Engineering Infinity, edited by Jonathan Strahan.\nCanadian writer Karl Schroeder was born and raised in Brandon, Manitoba.

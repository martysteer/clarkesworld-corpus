Dac Kien had known this, even before she\u2019d reached the engineering habitat\u2014even before she\u2019d seen the great mass in orbit outside, being slowly assembled by the bots.\nHer ancestors had once carved jade, in the bygone days of the Le dynasty on Old Earth: not hacking the green blocks into the shape they wanted, but rather whittling down the stone until its true nature was revealed. And as with jade, so with ships. The sections outside couldn\u2019t be forced together. They had to flow into a seamless whole\u2014to be, in the end, inhabited by a Mind who was as much a part of the ship as every rivet and every seal.\nThe Easterners or the Mexica didn\u2019t understand. They spoke of recycling, of design efficiency: they saw only the parts taken from previous ships, and assumed it was done to save money and time. They didn\u2019t understand why Dac Kien\u2019s work as Grand Master of Design Harmony was the most important on the habitat: the ship, once made, would be one entity, and not a patchwork of ten thousand others. To Dac Kien\u2014and to the one who would come after her, the Mind-bearer\u2014fell the honor of helping the ship into being, of transforming metal and cables and solar cells into an entity that would sail the void between the stars.\nThe door slid open. Dac Kien barely looked up. The light tread of the feet told her this was one of the lead designers, either Miahua or Feng. Neither would have disturbed her without cause. With a sigh, she disconnected from the system with a flick of her hands, and waited for the design\u2019s overlay on her vision to disappear.\n\u201cYour Excellency.\u201d Miahua\u2019s voice was quiet: the Xuyan held herself upright, her skin as pale as yellowed wax. \u201cThe shuttle has come back. There\u2019s someone on board you should see.\u201d\nDac Kien had expected many things: a classmate from the examinations on a courtesy visit; an Imperial Censor from Dongjing, calling her to some other posting, even further away from the capital; or perhaps even someone from her family, mother or sister or uncle\u2019s wife, here to remind her of the unsuitability of her life choices.\nShe hadn\u2019t expected a stranger: a woman with brown skin, almost dark enough to be Viet herself\u2014her lips thin and white, her eyes as round as the moon.\nA Mexica. A foreigner\u2014Dac Kien stopped the thought before it could go far. For the woman wore no cotton, no feathers, but the silk robes of a Xuyan housewife, and the five wedding gifts (all pure gold, from necklace to bracelets) shone like stars on the darkness of her skin.\nDac Kien\u2019s gaze traveled down to the curve of the woman\u2019s belly: a protruding bulge so voluminous that it threw her whole silhouette out of balance. \u201cI greet you, younger sister. I am Dac Kien, Grand Master of Design Harmony for this habitat.\u201d She used the formal tone, suitable for addressing a stranger.\n\u201cElder sister.\u201d The Mexica\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, set deep within the heavy face. \u201cI am\u2014\u201d She grimaced, one hand going to her belly as if to tear it out. \u201cZoquitl,\u201d she whispered at last, the accents of her voice slipping back to the harsh patterns of her native tongue. \u201cMy name is Zoquitl.\u201d Her eyes started to roll upwards; she went on, taking on the cadences of something learned by rote. \u201cI am the womb and the resting place, the quickener and the Mind-bearer.\u201d\nDac Kien\u2019s stomach roiled, as if an icy fist were squeezing it. \u201cYou\u2019re early. The ship\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe ship has to be ready.\u201d\nThe interjection surprised her. All her attention had been focused on the Mexica\u2014Zoquitl\u2014and what her coming here meant. Now she forced herself to look at the other passenger of the shuttle: a Xuyan man in his mid-thirties. His accent was that of Anjiu province, on the Fifth Planet; his robes, with the partridge badge and the button of gold, were those of a minor official of the seventh rank\u2014but they were marked with the yin-yang symbol, showing stark black-and white against the silk.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the birth-master,\u201d she said.\nHe bowed. \u201cI have that honor.\u201d His face was harsh, all angles and planes on which the light caught\u2014highlighting, here and there, the thin lips, the high cheekbones. \u201cForgive me my abruptness, but there is no time to lose.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d Dac Kien looked again at the woman, whose eyes bore a glazed look of pain. \u201cShe\u2019s early,\u201d she said, flatly, and she wasn\u2019t speaking of their arrival time.\nThe birth-master nodded.\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u201cA week, at most.\u201d The birth-master grimaced. \u201cThe ship has to be ready.\u201d\nDac Kien tasted bile in her mouth. The ship was all but made\u2014and, like a jade statue, it would brook no corrections nor oversights. Dac Kien and her team had designed it specifically for the Mind within Zoquitl\u2019s womb: starting out from the specifications the imperial alchemists had given them, the delicate balance of humors, optics, and flesh that made up the being Zoquitl carried. The ship would answer to nothing else: only Zoquitl\u2019s Mind would be able to seize the heartroom, to quicken the ship, and take it into deep planes, where fast star-travel was possible.\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Dac Kien started, but the birth-master shook his head, and she didn\u2019t need to hear his answer to know what he would say.\nShe had to. This had been the posting she\u2019d argued for, after she came in second at the state examinations\u2014this, not a magistrate\u2019s tribunal and district, not a high-placed situation in the palace\u2019s administration, not the prestigious Courtyard of Writing Brushes, as would have been her right. This was what the imperial court would judge her on.\nShe wouldn\u2019t get another chance.\n\u201cA week.\u201d Hanh shook her head. \u201cWhat do they think you are, a Mexica factory overseer?\u201d\n\u201cHanh.\u201d It had been a long day, and Dac Kien had come back to their quarters looking for comfort. In hindsight, she should have known how Hanh would take the news: her partner was an artist, a poet, always seeking the right word and the right allusion\u2014ideally suited to understanding the delicacy that went into the design of a ship, less than ideal to acknowledge any need for urgency.\n\u201cI have to do this,\u201d Dac Kien said.\nHanh grimaced. \u201cBecause they\u2019re pressuring you into it? You know what it will look like.\u201d She gestured towards the low mahogany table in the center of the room. The ship\u2019s design hung inside a translucent cube, gently rotating\u2014the glimpses of its interior interspersed with views of other ships, the ones from which it had taken its inspiration: all the greats from The Red Carp to The Golden Mountain and The Snow-White Blossom. Their hulls gleamed in the darkness, slowly and subtly bending out of shape to become the final structure of the ship hanging outside the habitat. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole, lil\u2019 sis. You can\u2019t butcher it and hope to keep your reputation intact.\u201d\n\u201cShe could die of it,\u201d Dac Kien said, at last. \u201cOf the birth, and it would be worse if she did it for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThe girl? She\u2019s gui. Foreign.\u201d\nMeaning she shouldn\u2019t matter. \u201cSo were we, once upon a time.\u201d Dac Kien said. \u201cYou have short memories.\u201d\nHanh opened her mouth, closed it. She could have pointed out that they weren\u2019t quite outsiders\u2014that China, Xuya\u2019s motherland, had once held Dai Viet for centuries; but Hanh was proud of being Viet, and certainly not about to mention such shameful details. \u201cIt\u2019s the girl that\u2019s bothering you, then?\u201d\n\u201cShe does what she wants,\u201d Dac Kien said.\n\u201cFor the prize.\u201d Hanh\u2019s voice was faintly contemptuous. Most of the girls who bore Minds were young and desperate, willing to face the dangers of the pregnancy in exchange for a marriage to a respected official. For a status of their own, a family that would welcome them in; and a chance to bear children of good birth.\nBoth Hanh and Dac Kien had made the opposite choice, long ago. For them, as for every Xuyan who engaged in same-gender relationships, there would be no children: no one to light incense at the ancestral altars, no voices to chant and honor their names after they were gone. Through life, they would be second-class citizens, consistently failing to accomplish their duties to their ancestors; in death, they would be spurned, forgotten\u2014gone as if they had never been.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dac Kien said. \u201cShe\u2019s Mexica. They see things differently, where she comes from.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what you\u2019re telling me, she\u2019s doing this for Xuyan reasons.\u201d\nFor fame, and for children; all that Hanh despised\u2014what she called their shackles, their overwhelming need to produce children, generation after generation.\nDac Kien bit her lip, wishing she could have Hanh\u2019s unwavering certainties. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I have much choice in the matter.\u201d\nHanh was silent for a while. At length, she moved, came to rest behind Dac Kien, her hair falling down over Dac Kien\u2019s shoulders, her hands trailing at Dac Kien\u2019s nape. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who keeps telling me we always have a choice, lil\u2019 sis.\u201d\nDac Kien shook her head. She said that\u2014when weary of her family\u2019s repeated reminders that she should marry and have children; when they lay in the darkness side by side after making love and she saw the future stretching in front of her, childless and ringed by old prejudices.\nHanh, much as she tried, didn\u2019t understand. She\u2019d always wanted to be a scholar, had always known that she\u2019d grow up to love another woman. She\u2019d always got what she wanted\u2014and she was convinced she only had to wish for something hard enough for it to happen.\nAnd Hanh had never wished, and would never wish for children.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Dac Kien said at last, cautiously submitting to Hanh\u2019s caresses. It was something else entirely; and even Hanh had to see that. \u201cI chose to come here. I chose to make my name that way. And we always have to see our choices through.\u201d\nHanh\u2019s hands on her shoulders tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk. I can see you wasting yourself in regrets, wondering if there\u2019s still time to turn back to respectability. But you chose me. This life, these consequences. We both chose.\u201d\n\u201cHanh\u2014\u201d It\u2019s not that, Dac Kien wanted to say. She loved Hanh, she truly did; but . . . She was a stone thrown in the darkness; a ship adrift without nav\u2014lost, without family or husband to approve of her actions, and without the comfort of a child destined to survive her.\n\u201cGrow up, lil\u2019 sis.\u201d Hanh\u2019s voice was harsh; her face turned away, towards the paintings of landscapes on the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re no one\u2019s toy or slave\u2014and especially not your family\u2019s.\u201d\nBecause they had all but disowned her. But words, as usual, failed Dac Kien; and they went to bed with the shadow of the old argument still between them, like the blade of a sword.\nThe next day, Dac Kien pored over the design of the ship with Feng and Miahua, wondering how she could modify it. The parts were complete, and assembling them would take a few days at most; but the resulting structure would never be a ship. That much was clear to all of them. Even excepting the tests, there was at least a month\u2019s work ahead of them\u2014slow and subtle touches laid by the bots over the overall system to align it with its destined Mind.\nDac Kien had taken the cube from her quarters, and brought it into her office under Hanh\u2019s glowering gaze. Now, they all crowded around it voicing ideas, the cups of tea forgotten in the intensity of the moment.\nFeng\u2019s wrinkled face was creased in thought as he tapped one side of the cube. \u201cWe could modify the shape of this corridor, here. Wood would run through the whole ship, and\u2014\u201d\nMiahua shook her head. She was their Master of Wind and Water, the one who could best read the lines of influence, the one Dac Kien turned to when she herself had a doubt over the layout. Feng was Commissioner of Supplies, managing the systems and safety\u2014in many ways Miahua\u2019s opposite, given to small adjustments rather than large ones, pragmatic where she verged on the mystical.\n\u201cThe humors of water and wood would stagnate here, in the control room.\u201d Miahua pursed her lips, pointed to the slender aft of the ship. \u201cThe shape of this section should be modified.\u201d\nFeng sucked in a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial. For my team to rewrite the electronics\u2014\u201d\nDac Kien listened to them arguing, distantly\u2014intervening with a question from time to time, to keep the conversation from dying down. In her mind, she held the shape of the ship, felt it breathe through the glass of the cube, through the layers of fibers and metal that separated her from the structure outside. She held the shape of the Mind\u2014the essences and emotions that made it, the layout of its sockets and cables, of its muscles and flesh\u2014and slid them together gently, softly until they seemed made for one another.\nShe looked up. Both Feng and Miahua had fallen silent, waiting for her to speak.\n\u201cThis way,\u201d she said. \u201cRemove this section altogether, and shift the rest of the layout.\u201d As she spoke, she reached into the glass matrix, and carefully excised the offending section\u2014rerouting corridors and lengths of cables, burning new decorative calligraphy onto the curved walls.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Feng said; and stopped. \u201cMiahua?\u201d\nMiahua was watching the new design, carefully. \u201cI need to think about it, Your Excellency. Let me discuss it with my subordinates.\u201d\nDac Kien made a gesture of approval. \u201cRemember that we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\nThey both took a copy of the design with them, snug in their long sleeves. Left alone, Dac Kien stared at the ship again. It was squat, its proportions out of kilter\u2014not even close to what she had imagined, not even true to the spirit of her work: a mockery of the original design, like a flower without petals, or a poem that didn\u2019t quite gel, hovering on the edge of poignant allusions but never expressing them properly.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always have a choice,\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d have prayed to her ancestors, had she thought they were still listening. Perhaps they were. Perhaps the shame of having a daughter who would have no descendants was erased by the exalted heights of her position. Or perhaps not. Her mother and grandmother were unforgiving; what made her think that those more removed ancestors would understand her decision?\n\u201cElder sister?\u201d\nZoquitl stood at the door, hovering uncertainly. Dac Kien\u2019s face must have revealed more than she thought. She forced herself to breathe, relaxing all her muscles until it was once more the blank mask required by protocol. \u201cYounger sister,\u201d she said. \u201cYou honor me by your presence.\u201d\nZoquitl shook her head. She slid carefully into the room\u2014one foot after the other, careful never to lose her balance. \u201cI wanted to see the ship.\u201d\nThe birth-master was nowhere to be seen. Dac Kien hoped that he had been right about the birth\u2014that it wasn\u2019t about to happen now, in her office, with no destination and no assistance. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d She shifted positions on her chair, invited Zoquitl to sit.\nZoquitl wedged herself in one of the seats, her movements fragile, measured\u2014as if any wrong gesture would shatter her. Behind her loomed one of Dac Kien\u2019s favorite paintings, an image from the Third Planet: a delicate, peaceful landscape of waterfalls and ochre cliffs, with the distant light of stars reflected in the water.\nZoquitl didn\u2019t move as Dac Kien showed her the design; her eyes were the only thing which seemed alive in the whole of her face.\nWhen Dac Kien was finished, the burning gaze was transferred to her\u2014looking straight into her eyes, a clear breach of protocol. \u201cYou\u2019re just like the others. You don\u2019t approve,\u201d Zoquitl said.\nIt took Dac Kien a moment to process the words, but they still meant nothing to her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nZoquitl\u2019s lips pursed. \u201cWhere I come from, it\u2019s an honor to bear Minds for the glory of the Mexica Dominion.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re here,\u201d Dac Kien said. In Xuya, among Xuyans, to bear Minds was a sacrifice\u2014necessary and paid for, but ill-considered. For who would want to endure a pregnancy, yet produce no human child? Only the desperate or the greedy.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here as well.\u201d Zoquitl\u2019s voice was almost an accusation.\nFor an endless, agonizing moment, Dac Kien thought Zoquitl was referring to her life choices\u2014how did she know about Hanh, about her family\u2019s stance? Then she understood that Zoquitl had been talking about her place onboard the habitat. \u201cI like being in space,\u201d Dac Kien said, at last, and it wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cBeing here almost alone, away from everyone else.\u201d\nAnd this wasn\u2019t paperwork, or the slow drain of catching and prosecuting law-breakers, of keeping Heaven\u2019s order on some remote planet. This\u2014this was everything scholarship was meant to be: taking all that the past had given them, and reshaping it into greatness\u2014every part throwing its neighbors into sharper relief, an eternal reminder of how history had brought them here and how it would carry them forward, again and again.\nAt last, Zoquitl said, not looking at the ship anymore, \u201cXuya is a harsh place, for foreigners. The language isn\u2019t so bad, but when you have no money, and no sponsor . . . \u201d She breathed in, quick and sharp. \u201cI do what needs doing.\u201d Her hand went, unconsciously, to the mound of her belly, and stroked it. \u201cAnd I give him life. How can you not value this?\u201d\nShe used the animate pronoun, without a second thought.\nDac Kien shivered. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d she paused, groping for words. \u201cHe has no father. A mother, perhaps, but there isn\u2019t much of you inside him. He won\u2019t be counted among your descendants. He won\u2019t burn incense on your altar, or chant your name among the stars.\u201d\n\u201cBut he won\u2019t die.\u201d Zoquitl\u2019s voice was soft, and cutting. \u201cNot for centuries.\u201d\nThe ships made by the Mexica Dominion lived long, but their Minds slowly went insane from repeated journeys into deep planes. This Mind, with a proper anchor, a properly aligned ship\u2014Zoquitl was right: he would remain as he was, long after she and Zoquitl were both dead. He\u2014no, it\u2014it was a machine\u2014a sophisticated intelligence, an assembly of flesh and metal and Heaven knew what else. Borne like a child, but still . . .\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the one who doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d Zoquitl pulled herself to her feet, slowly. Dac Kien could hear her labored breath, could smell the sour, sharp sweat rolling off her. \u201cThank you, elder sister.\u201d\nAnd then she was gone; but her words remained.\nDac Kien threw herself into her work\u2014as she had done before, when preparing for the state examinations. Hahn pointedly ignored her when she came home, making only the barest attempts at courtesy. She was working again on her calligraphy, mingling Xuyan characters with the letters of the Viet alphabet to create a work that spoke both as a poem and as a painting. It wasn\u2019t unusual: Dac Kien had come to be accepted for her talent, but her partner was another matter. Hanh wasn\u2019t welcome in the banquet room, where the families of the other engineers would congregate in the evenings\u2014she preferred to remain alone in their quarters, rather than endure the barely concealed snubs or the pitying looks of the others.\nWhat gave the air its leaden weight, though, was her silence. Dac Kien tried at first\u2014keeping up a chatter, as if nothing were wrong. Hanh raised bleary eyes from her manuscript, and said, simply, \u201cYou know what you\u2019re doing, lil\u2019 sis. Live with it, for once.\u201d\nSo it was silence, in the end. It suited her better than she\u2019d thought it would. It was her and the design, with no one to blame or interfere.\nMiahua\u2019s team and Feng\u2019s team were rewiring the structure and re-arranging the parts. Outside the window, the mass of the hull shifted and twisted, to align itself with the cube on her table\u2014bi-hour after bi-hour, as the bots gently slid sections into place and sealed them.\nThe last section was being put into place when Miahua and the birth-master came to see her, both looking equally pre-occupied.\nHer heart sank. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d Dac Kien said. \u201cShe\u2019s due now.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s lost the waters,\u201d the birth-master said, without preamble. He spat on the floor to ward off evil spirits, who always crowded around the mother in the hour of a birth. \u201cYou have a few bi-hours, at most.\u201d\n\u201cMiahua?\u201d Dac Kien wasn\u2019t looking at either of them, but rather at the ship outside, the huge bulk that dwarfed them all in its shadow.\nHer Master of Wind and Water was silent for a while\u2014usually a sign that she was arranging problems in the most suitable order. Not good. \u201cThe structure will be finished before this bi-hour is over.\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d Dac Kien said.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a mess. The lines of wood cross those of metal, and there are humors mingling with each other and stagnating everywhere. The qi won\u2019t flow.\u201d\nThe qi, the breath of the universe\u2014of the dragon that lay at the heart of every planet, of every star. As Master of Wind and Water, it was Miahua\u2019s role to tell Dac Kien what had gone wrong, but as Grand Master of Design Harmony, it fell to Dac Kien to correct this. Miahua could only point out the results she saw: only Dac Kien could send the bots in to make the necessary adjustments to the structure. \u201cI see,\u201d Dac Kien said. \u201cPrepare a shuttle for her. Have it wait outside, close to the ship\u2019s docking bay.\u201d\n\u201cYour Excellency\u2014\u201d the birth-master started, but Dac Kien cut him off.\n\u201cI have told you before. The ship will be ready.\u201d\nMiahua\u2019s stance as she left was tense, all pent-up fears. Dac Kien thought of Hanh\u2014alone in their room, stubbornly bent over her poem, her face as harsh as that of the birth-master, its customary roundness sharpened by anger and resentment. She\u2019d say, again, that you couldn\u2019t hurry things, that there were always possibilities. She\u2019d say that\u2014but she\u2019d never understood there was always a price; and that, if you didn\u2019t pay it, others did.\nThe ship would be ready; and Dac Kien would pay its price in full.\nAlone again, Dac Kien connected to the system, letting the familiar overlay of the design take over her surroundings. She adjusted the contrast until the design was all she could see; and then she set to work.\nMiahua was right: the ship was a mess. They had envisioned having a few days to tidy things up, to soften the angles of the corridors, to spread the wall-lanterns so there were no dark corners or spots shining with blinding light. The heartroom alone\u2014the pentacle-shaped center of the ship, where the Mind would settle\u2014had strands of four humors coming to an abrupt, painful stop within, and a sharp line just outside its entrance, marking the bots\u2019 hasty sealing.\nThe killing breath, it was called; and it was everywhere.\nAncestors, watch over me.\nA living, breathing thing\u2014jade, whittled down to its essence. Dac Kien slid into the trance, her consciousness expanding to encompass the bots around the structure\u2014sending them, one by one, inside the metal hull, scuttling down the curved corridors and passageways\u2014gently merging with the walls, starting the slow and painful work of coaxing the metal into its proper shape\u2014going up into the knot of cables, straightening them out, regulating the current in the larger ones. In her mind\u2019s view, the ship seemed to flicker and fold back upon itself; she hung suspended outside, watching the bots crawl over it like ants, injecting commands into the different sections, in order to modify their balance of humors and inner structure.\nShe cut to the shuttle, where Zoquitl lay on her back, her face distorted into a grimace. The birth-master\u2019s face was grim, turned upwards as if he could guess at Dac Kien\u2019s presence.\nHurry. You don\u2019t have time left. Hurry.\nAnd still she worked\u2014walls turned into mirrors, flowers were carved into the passageways, softening those hard angles and lines she couldn\u2019t disguise. She opened up a fountain\u2014all light projections, of course, there could be no real water aboard\u2014let the recreated sound of a stream fill the structure. Inside the heartroom, the four tangled humors became three, then one; then she brought in other lines until the tangle twisted back upon itself, forming a complicated knot pattern that allowed strands of all five humors to flow around the room. Water, wood, fire, earth, metal, all circling the ship\u2019s core, a stabilizing influence for the Mind, when it came to anchor itself there.\nShe flicked back the display to the shuttle, saw Zoquitl\u2019s face, and the unbearable lines of tension in the other\u2019s face.\nHurry.\nIt was not ready. But life didn\u2019t wait until you were ready. Dac Kien turned off the display\u2014but not the connection to the bots, leaving them time to finish their last tasks.\n\u201cNow,\u201d she whispered, into the com system.\nThe shuttle launched itself towards the docking bay. Dac Kien dimmed the overlay, letting the familiar sight of the room re-assert itself\u2014with the cube, and the design that should have been, the perfect one, the one that called to mind The Red Carp and The Turtle Over the Waves and The Dragon\u2019s Twin Dreams, all the days of Xuya from the Exodus to the Pearl Wars, and the fall of the Shan Dynasty; and older things, too, Le Loi\u2019s sword that had established a Viet dynasty; the dragon with spread wings flying over Hanoi, the Old Earth capital; the face of Huyen Tran, the Viet princess traded to foreigners in return for two provinces.\nThe bots were turning themselves off, one by one, and a faint breeze ran through the ship, carrying the smell of sea-laden water and of incense.\nIt could have been, that ship, that masterpiece. If she\u2019d had time. Hanh was right, she could have made it work: it would have been hers, perfect, praised\u2014remembered in the centuries to come, used as inspiration by hundreds of other Grand Masters.\nIf\u2014\nShe didn\u2019t know how long she stayed there, staring at the design\u2014but an agonized cry tore her from her thoughts. Startled, she turned up the ship\u2019s feed again, and selected a view into the birthing room.\nThe lights had been dimmed, leaving shadows everywhere, like a prelude to mourning. Dac Kien could see the bowl of tea given at the beginning of labor\u2014it had rolled into a corner of the room, a few drops scattering across the floor.\nZoquitl crouched against a high-backed chair, framed by holos of two goddesses who watched over childbirth: the Princess of the Blue and Purple Clouds, and the Bodhisattva of Mercy. In the shadows, her face seemed to be that of a demon, the alienness of her features distorted by pain.\n\u201cPush,\u201d the birth-master was saying, his hands on the quivering mound of her belly.\nPush.\nBlood ran down Zoquitl\u2019s thighs, staining the metal surfaces until they reflected everything in shades of red. But her eyes were proud\u2014those of an old warrior race, who\u2019d never bent or bowed to anybody else. Her child of flesh, when it came, would be delivered the same way.\nDac Kien thought of Hanh, and of sleepless nights, of the shadow stretched over their lives, distorting everything.\n\u201cPush,\u201d the birth-master said again, and more blood ran out. Push push push\u2014and Zoquitl\u2019s eyes were open, looking straight at her, and Dac Kien knew\u2014she knew that the rhythm that racked Zoquitl, the pain that came in waves, it was all part of the same immutable law, the same thread that bound them more surely than the red one between lovers\u2014what lay in the womb, under the skin, in their hearts and in their minds; a kinship of gender that wouldn\u2019t ever be altered or extinguished. Her hand slid to her own flat, empty belly, pressed hard. She knew what that pain was, she could hold every layer of it in her mind as she\u2019d held the ship\u2019s design\u2014and she knew that Zoquitl, like her, had been made to bear it.\nPush.\nWith a final heart-wrenching scream, Zoquitl expelled the last of the Mind from her womb. It slid to the floor, a red, glistening mass of flesh and electronics: muscles and metal implants, veins and pins and cables.\nIt lay there, still and spent\u2014and several heartbeats passed before Dac Kien realized it wouldn\u2019t ever move.\nDac Kien put off visiting Zoquitl for days, still reeling from the shock of the birth. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw blood: the great mass sliding out of the womb, flopping on the floor like a dead fish, the lights of the birthing room glinting on metal wafers and gray matter, and everything dead, gone as if it had never been.\nIt had no name, of course\u2014neither it nor the ship, both gone too soon to be graced with one.\nPush. Push, and everything will be fine. Push.\nHanh tried her best: showing her poems with exquisite calligraphy; speaking of the future and of her next posting; fiercely making love to her as if nothing had ever happened, as if Dac Kien could just forget the enormity of the loss. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\nJust as the ship hadn\u2019t been enough.\nIn the end, remorse drove Dac Kien, as surely as a barbed whip; and she boarded the shuttle to come over to the ship.\nZoquitl was in the birthing room, sitting wedged against the wall, with a bowl of pungent tea in her veined hands. The two holos framed her, their white-painted faces stark in the dim light, unforgiving. The birth-master hovered nearby, but was persuaded to leave them both alone\u2014though he made it clear Dac Kien was responsible for anything that happened to Zoquitl.\n\u201cElder sister.\u201d Zoquitl smiled, a little bitterly. \u201cIt was a good fight.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d One Zoquitl could have won, if she had been given better weapons.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look so sad,\u201d Zoquitl said.\n\u201cI failed,\u201d Dac Kien said, simply. She knew Zoquitl\u2019s future was still assured; that she\u2019d make her good marriage, and bear children, and be worshipped in her turn. But she also knew, now, that it wasn\u2019t the only reason Zoquitl had borne the Mind.\nZoquitl\u2019s lips twisted, into what might have been a smile. \u201cHelp me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dac Kien looked at her, but Zoquitl was already pushing herself up, shaking, shivering, as carefully as she had done when pregnant. \u201cThe birth-master\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s fussing like an old woman,\u201d Zoquitl said; and for a moment, her voice was as sharp and as cutting as a blade. \u201cCome. Let\u2019s walk.\u201d\nShe was smaller than Dac Kien had thought: her shoulders barely came up to her own. She wedged herself awkwardly, leaning on Dac Kien for support\u2014a weight that grew increasingly hard to bear as they walked through the ship.\nThere was light, and the sound of water, and the familiar feel of qi flowing through the corridors in lazy circles, breathing life into everything. There were shadows barely seen in mirrors, and the glint of other ships, too: the soft, curving patterns of The Golden Mountain; the carved calligraphy incised in the doors that had been the hallmark of The Tiger Who Leapt Over the Stream; the slowly curving succession of ever-growing doors of Baoyu\u2019s Red Fan\u2014bits and pieces salvaged from her design and put together into\u2014into this, which unfolded its marvels all around her, from layout to electronics to decoration, until her head spun and her eyes blurred, taking it all in.\nIn the heartroom, Dac Kien stood unmoving, while the five humors washed over them, an endless cycle of destruction and renewal. The center was pristine, untouched, with a peculiar sadness hanging around it, like an empty crib. And yet . . .\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Zoquitl said, her voice catching and quivering in her throat.\nBeautiful as a poem declaimed in drunken games, as a flower bud ringed by frost\u2014beautiful and fragile as a newborn child struggling to breathe.\nAnd, standing there at the center of things, with Zoquitl\u2019s frail body leaning against her, she thought of Hanh again; of shadows and darkness, and of life choices.\nIt\u2019s beautiful.\nIt would be gone in a few days. Destroyed, recycled; forgotten and uncommemorated. But somehow, Dac Kien couldn\u2019t bring herself to voice the thought.\nInstead she said, softly, into the silence\u2014knowing it to be true of more than the ship\u2014\u201cIt was worth it.\u201d\nAll of it\u2014now and in the years to come, and she wouldn\u2019t look back, or regret.\nOriginally published in Interzone, Issue 231, September 2010.\nAliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

I started digging into the genre data\u2014which the authors provide on submissions\u2014to take a look at possible trends. The data isn\u2019t specific to themes within a genre, but that wasn\u2019t what I was after this time around. I was looking for data to indicate whether or not a specific life event\u2014my 2012 heart attack\u2014had caused a concrete and permanent change in my taste in fiction, and if so, should the submissions guidelines be changed.\n My heart attack happened in July 2012, which places it at issue 70, very close to the halfway mark in Clarkesworld\u2019s history. However, in terms of stories published, that\u2019s somewhat misleading. Up through issue 60, we only published two original stories per issue. Issues 61-70 had three stories in each and starting at 95, there were four stories in every other issue. From 100 on, we\u2019ve typically featured five. To further complicate things, we\u2019ve more recently switched from a story count to a word count model. This change has allowed us to be a bit more flexible in publishing longer works, but has made the total number of stories per issue more variable.\n As a starting point, I tossed together a quick graph to visualize my selections since 2012:\n As you can see, approximately 77% of the stories we\u2019ve published since then are categorized as science fiction by their authors and a bit more than half of what remained are science fiction/fantasy hybrids. Fantasy came in next and was followed by horror blendings with science fiction and fantasy\u2014combined to roughly the same amount as fantasy. The tiny sliver of \u201cother\u201d leans much more SF than anything else (by my opinion, the authors call them a variety of subgenres). What\u2019s missing? Horror.\n There\u2019s none.\n And now we get to the point of my digging through the data. Since my heart attack, I\u2019ve felt like there\u2019s been a disconnect with my ability to engage with that specific genre. I\u2019ve had my own personal horror, and it appears to have put me off the fictional ones. I don\u2019t like to go there anymore. Yes, there are still some dark SF and dark fantasy pieces\u2014and a lot of heavier themes\u2014still making their way into the magazine, but it looks like I have drawn a line in the sand.\n Prior to June 2012, Clarkesworld published some horror, but the data set is so much smaller that a single story has a much more significant impact on the percentages. I could go on about the margin of error and other things, but it would still be visually misleading\u2014and as I\u2019ve found in the past, subject to people reading their own biases into the results. There\u2019s enough armchair statisticians using bad math to score points and fuel causes. Why would I want to contribute to that?\n The more I thought about it, the more I came to the realization that the \u201cwhy\u201d question I was asking myself was completely irrelevant. The history in this context doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is what I am doing now and what I intend to do in the future. There\u2019s nothing wrong with admitting that I\u2019ve lost interest in the horror genre. There\u2019s no shame in feeling that way and there\u2019s nothing stopping me from changing my mind again at some later date.\n It\u2019s more important that I be honest with myself, our readers, and the authors submitting their work to Clarkesworld. Effective today, we\u2019re changing our submissions guidelines to remove horror from the list of genres we accept. Given the last six years, that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone, but it\u2019s time to make it official.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

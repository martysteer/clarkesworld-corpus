Home is the diction and rhythm of your conversation, is the bend of your mouth, the slant of your smile. Home is your quiet. Even ten million lightyears away, suspended between seconds, time beading silver-bright on molecules of dark matter, home has always been the silence I\u2019ve held in the chapel of your hands.\nI flex my fingers, squeeze the vinyl flesh into a fist. The transmission is slow, syncopated. I experience the sensation in staccato: the bend of my joints, the peculiar texture of my skin, the one you said you never minded. Then again, we\u2019d pick this model together, contoured and coaxed its anatomy into a compromise of shared aesthetics. Why should you mind? I blink and delight, just for a second, in the way the lashes\u2014synthetic hairs, so pliant that they could almost pass for real\u2014feel on my cheeks.\n\u201cWhere lies your landmark, seamark, or your soul\u2019s star?\u201d asked a poet once and I think to myself: here. Right here.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d You ask.\nI study you through the camera. That feed is closer to real-time, even if the ocular prosthetics are better at imaging colors, richer in saturation. You look more tired than I remember, more battered. I forget we no longer experience time in the same fashion. Not that we ever did, generations between us, but this isn\u2019t about that.\nI\u2019ve seen the mouth of the universe open to devour the stars. I\u2019ve seen our Earth reborn seventeen times, mapped the trajectory of its catastrophes, the telemetry of its deaths. Once, existence spasmed and there was nothing, nothing at all, neither estrus nor end, only darkness complete.\nTime, the media likes to say, is meaningless to people like me. They\u2019re lying. It means everything instead.\n\u201cThis is what I want. Promise.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to agree to something just because\u2014just because. You know.\u201d The spaces in our sentences are a language onto their own, a dialect born of corrective butchery, edited from something once so much bigger. I can taste it, nonetheless, the vocabulary we\u2019d abandoned, its small and frightening phrases. Trust me. Stay here. Stay. In my mouth, they\u2019re cherry cider and the lights of the city, and how you showed me that with some people, some places, you never stop falling in love, you only come up for air. \u201cDo me a favor? Can you take a few days? Take a few days to think about this? Please?\u201d\nYou still don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve had days. I\u2019ve had the lifespan of our solar system, twice and again. Time works differently here. But I nod, anyway. My simulacrum follows, half a second later. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cWhere lies your landmark, seamark, or your soul\u2019s star?\u201d murmurs the poet, his bones now a home for mice.\nAbove the world, falling in love with the city like it was first time all over.\n\u201cI might stay here a little longer,\u201d I tell you, straddling your hips with my double. You had joked, the first time we made love, that it was almost like having sex with twins. Except this one was alien, love through the looking glass. I did not correct you. The reality is more pedestrian. I\u2019d chosen this look to express my interiority, its strangeness in relation to you: a fae body for a fae creature, unstuck in time. \u201cLogistical concerns, existing responsibilities. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\nYour breath speeds in simpatico as my fingers climb your ribs. In the mirror, I can see how the light sluices along my skin, a faint nacre sheen apparent even in the dimness. Proportions-wise, it is as we agreed: a little taller than I am, a little fuller at hips. I\u2019d eschewed hair, however, dilated the orbital sockets, deepened them. The eyes are an ecosystem of bioluminescent bacteria, the sclera gold, the iris green.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d No variation in your expression. \u201cWhatever you need to do to be happy.\u201d\nI sigh. It is not what I want to hear. What I want is for you to tell me to come home, come home and curl your body against mine. But we\u2019d elided the syntax that allows for such communication. The framework we\u2019d left behind is insufficient. So, I lean down instead, your hand rising to trace the city-line of my spine, kiss you breathless.\nIn the void, I pretend that the interface translates temperature with perfect accuracy, that I can feel your jaw warm beneath my lips, that I don\u2019t miss you.\n\u201cWhere lies your landmark, seamark, or your soul\u2019s star?\u201d calls the poet, alive again, for the ritual of the recital.\nIn the way your hips slot into mine. In the fit of you, exquisite, as though bodies were built too lonely, and every one of us is waiting, waiting lifetimes to be complete.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be unhappy. I don\u2019t want you to resent me. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me not to mourn.\u201d I tell you evenly, hands over yours, thumb orbiting your knuckles. Two days to the expedition, two nights left to sleep laced in your arms. It hurts, beloved. But how can I tell you? \u201cI\u2019m going to grieve what we\u2019d lost. It\u2019s going to hurt. I can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not going to hurt.\u201d\nA muscle, cording the meridian that runs between the cliff of your cheekbone and your temple, flutters. This conversation upsets you, and suddenly, I am afraid again, terrified you\u2019d flee. I stroke your hair. You kiss the heel of my palm, just above where the wrist grazes your jaw, watch me like a fox with its back to the shore. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting anything from you\u2014\u201d\nI wish you were, though. I wish you\u2019d ask. Anything and everything. Something. I wish I had an itinerary of your desires, a roadmap crisscrossed by whim, every ambition numbered, ordered by need. I wish you\u2019d tell me to stay.\nBut I know, I know that isn\u2019t the way. You can\u2019t build on broken glass, can\u2019t make a home out of a husk. It\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving.\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m just telling you that you can\u2019t expect me not to have moments of sadness. But I want this, I do.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d On the precipice of your tongue, questions too vulnerable to voice: Why me? Why this? Why, despite everything that\u2019d happened?\nWhy?\n\u201cYes. Look, we\u2019ve broken much too far from that. If this is going to have a chance, we need to start from scratch again, you know?\u201d\nI mean every word, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nIt is the only choice I have left.\n\u201cWhere lies your landmark, seamark, or your soul\u2019s star?\u201d whispers the poet, stardust now, dead, immortal.\nWhere love lives, of course.\nWhere love is.\n\u201cDo you know when you are coming back?\u201d\nOrientation is always hard when you first surface into static time, like a baptism of mucus. It sticks to the lungs, the tongue, a vernix-like slickness, cloying, clotting in your throat. You drown on the present. It is why I prefer the prosthetic of a proxy, a cleaner option. It supplies opportunity to rehearse, prepare, pretend that this, like everything else, is effortless.\nI hesitate. You so rarely call. I barely know what to do with me. In the window, your image stutters in sympathy.\n\u201cI . . . still don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d I worry at my hair, the strands still wet, haloed in neon.\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nI palm the screen. One of the many things I\u2019d never tell you: it is cold here and the last time I was warm, it was in the coil of your arms. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to see you. It\u2019s just. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a long trip back. And if you\u2019re going to, you know, be with someone else during that time. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\u201cI want to. I\u2019m just conflicted.\u201d\n\u201cCome back when you\u2019re ready to. There\u2019s no obligation.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nThe word hangs between us, a dead satellite in the nothing, its belly gravid with stillborn dialogue. I want to ask you what I\u2019d missed, the minutiae of simply existing, each day in sequence, no variegation in their consumption. Already, I\u2019ve forgotten if it\u2019s been a week, a day, a year since we\u2019ve spoken, if this conversation is prior to the last, if it is years after. The cartography of your features remain unchanged. It cannot have been that long.\n\u201cI\u2014Don\u2019t. I was afraid of this.\u201d\n\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re just circling back to the same things. We always are. I knew this was going to happen. I knew.\u201d You empty an old rage, an old fear, as the connection falters, your words received in gasps.\n\u201cStop.\u201d\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cThis was never about that. I wouldn\u2019t be here if it was. I just\u2014I\u2019m still human, you know? This still hurts. You can\u2019t blame me for that.\u201d\nYou pause.\nYou break.\nYou whisper:\n\u201cWhy are you doing this to yourself?\u201d\n\u201cBecause if this is the only way I can have you, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\u201cHow can this half-state be enough?\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t. It is nowhere near enough. But I have lived epochs without you, and that is so much worse. Home has always been your fingers and mine, the smell of your coat, your hair against my cheek. Home is the start of your laugh and the end of a kiss. Home is this ache, this hurt.\n\u201cBecause it has to be,\u201d I murmur, voice thick with futures. \u201cBecause it needs to be.\nCassandra Khaw writes horror, video games, tweets for money, articles about video games, and tabletop RPGs.

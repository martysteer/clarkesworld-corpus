But when she started mourning her planet\u2019s vanished civilization, he\u2019d reconsidered. He had encountered stranger things in his explorations than this mysterious new companion.\n\u201cMarek?\u201d she asked, as he crested a muddy slope. \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d\nMarek ignored the question, turning to look at the lush valley now spread out below him.\n\u201cRecord,\u201d he said. There was a soft chime in his head as his cams activated. He pivoted slowly, trying to make the recording as smooth as possible.\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Milla asked. Her voice echoed in the implant at the base of Marek\u2019s skull. In the stillness, it seemed to carry all the way to the foothills of the distant mountains.\nMarek\u2019s implant had been designed for basic data storage and computation. He couldn\u2019t do either now that it was being hijacked by an alien AI.\n\u201cWasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d The regulation helmet had an optic strip that provided a full feed in 360 degrees, but he\u2019d given up on it the day before. Its bulky reconnaissance suite had snagged once too often in the sort of ivy that grew here.\nThe lenses grafted to his retinas did the job well enough, and once he had the comm system running, once Earth could see what he saw, nobody would give a damn about helmet protocols.\n\u201cMarek,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWhat do you think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou tell me. You\u2019re the one who should know.\u201d\nHe turned away from the valley and started toward the tree line. There was a sort of resin oozing from under the bark; he paused to take footage. When he pinched a bit between his thumb and forefinger it smeared acid green against his white glove.\nSome kind of worm, pale pink in color, poked its head out from a crack in the trunk. It regarded him for a moment with six globular black eyes, then plunged back inside the tree cavity.\n\u201cEnd recording,\u201d Marek said, once he was sure it wasn\u2019t coming back. He sat down in the shade, rolling his sore neck.\n\u201cI have never seen that animal,\u201d Milla said. \u201cOnce it did not exist. Oh, Marek, it was all so different!\u201d\nThere was a reason Marek accepted solo assignments to the furthest corners of known space. He did not like company. He liked conversation even less. But something in Milla\u2019s distraught voice, a voice that was ancient and childlike at the same time, made him want to comfort her.\n\u201cSpecies migrate and evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of things.\u201d\n\u201cAnd not only that animal,\u201d she continued, as if she hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cThe lion spiders, the staring crabs, the ponies: these did not exist in my time.\u201d\nMarek cracked a smile hearing her use the nicknames he\u2019d given to the local fauna.\n\u201cDo you know the most terrible thing?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nShe let out a small sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful now that they\u2019re gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that is an awful thing to say. But it\u2019s true. The green is so much better than the gray. The planet breathes again, in a rhythm I had forgotten. That everyone had forgotten.\u201d\nThe admission must have pained her, because she spent the next several hours in silence. Marek kept working, serenaded by the calls of distant birds.\nMarek\u2019s ship had simulated a twenty-four hour day during the journey, but now that he\u2019d landed his body was quickly adjusting to Shiva\u2019s light cycle\u2014one of the traits that made him a good surveyor. On a planet with a six-hour rotation, he would have no trouble walking for three hours and sleeping the other three.\nOn the third morning, while Marek was working on the malfunctioning comm system, Milla came to him with delusions of divinity.\n\u201cI have formed a hypothesis, Marek,\u201d she said. \u201cI am the divine will and protector of this place. I have governed its life cycles since time immemorial. My tears of joy seeded these forests at the dawn of the world.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a philosopher, Milla,\u201d Marek said warily. \u201cIf you can\u2019t give me some useful information on this wiring, please don\u2019t talk.\u201d\nBut he was distracted again a moment later, watching a pony amble up to drink from the sparkling stream only twenty meters ahead. Marek found himself thinking that maybe, when the time came, this was the place.\n\u201cI could die happy here,\u201d he said, on impulse.\n\u201cYou want to end your life cycle here in my sunny arms, Marek?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a saying,\u201d Marek said sharply.\nThe animal trotted on.\n\u201cI am not certain I am a goddess,\u201d she admitted after a while. \u201cThe calculation was made in a single subsystem. But it does seem logical.\u201d\n\u201cLogical my ass. If there ever were gods, they went extinct, too. Everything does eventually. We\u2019re just out here to get a few more bites at the apple.\u201d\nHe grimaced as the comm system gave another mournful chirp. Transmission would have to wait until he was in orbit again.\n\u201cThis place is perfect, too. Earth should be hailing me as a hero right now. They should be coordinating the next launch. But instead the only person I can reach is an alien AI who thinks she\u2019s a god.\u201d\nAfter a long pause, Milla\u2019s voice radiated from his implant.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only you here, Marek. Where has everyone gone?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer.\nIt was dusk when they spoke again. Marek was on the banks of a lake, watching swarms of electric blue birds that looked like miniature herons. Shiva\u2019s moon was visible tonight, throwing soft light on the water. The lake\u2019s surface rippled in the wind.\n\u201cEnd recording,\u201d Marek said. He had enough for the day. He took a blue cloth shell from his pocket, traced the activation strip with one finger, and tossed it to the ground. Moments later the mattress was ready to welcome his weary limbs.\n\u201cThere were lakes in my time, too,\u201d Milla said. \u201cBut the water was pumped away to the cities. There were seas. Oceans. But they were badly contaminated then. Does your planet have seas?\u201d\nMarek closed his eyes. \u201cYeah. Did when I left. They\u2019re not in great shape, though.\u201d\n\u201cThen it must be a commonality among dominant species. Look at the ponies. I cannot communicate with them, and I imagine they would have little to say. They stand there and graze. They will never build towers of metal and glass, but they will never uproot a tree, either.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever your creators built has been gone for millennia,\u201d Marek said irritably. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left of them but you.\u201d\nMilla fell silent. Did she feel guilty for not preventing the collapse of her people\u2019s civilization? For having slept while the world changed and evolved, leaving her behind? Marek felt a twinge of regret at his words. But maybe she was only thinking.\nWhen she answered, her voice was feeble. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can remember what happened to them, maybe we can avoid repeating their mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cI do not remember, Marek. I told you: yesterday they were here, thriving, proliferating, taking up every square meter of space. I closed my eyes for a moment, and when I opened them I saw green instead of gray. I heard only you. And when you leave I will close my eyes and perhaps not open them again.\u201d\nMarek considered Milla\u2019s words. She was an AI caretaker of some sort, more advanced than the ones back on Earth, so advanced she kept forgetting what she was. Marek had tried to explain her probable former functions, and she had believed him\u2014but as a transplanted skin, not something she felt internally.\nMilla\u2019s blackout must have coincided with the end of Shiva\u2019s civilization, whether by electromagnetic radiation or war or a colossal nuclear accident. She\u2019d lain dormant for eons until Marek\u2019s arrival reawakened her circuitry.\n\u201cOr maybe I will keep my eyes open,\u201d he heard her whisper as he drifted off to sleep. \u201cMaybe I will never close them again.\u201d\nMarek dreamed about thick-furred lion spiders scuttling away into the undergrowth, frightened by his footsteps. He pursued them; he knew they were keeping a secret. He ventured through damp twilight, following the patter of hundreds of feet.\nHe passed a fallen log coated in glimmering moss. Milla was there, naked, ageless, plants caressing her feet and spiralling up her calves.\n\u201cI want to be a goddess, Marek,\u201d she said, and this time her voice came from her lips, not from his implant.\nThe scuttling spiders, the rustling leaves, the living forest: all of it went silent. Behind Milla, swaying like reeds in the wind, Marek saw the shadows of the dead.\nShe spread her arms, and the forest trembled.\nUnder the morning sun the lake water turned transparent. Marek found the mossy rocks of the seabed inhabited by creatures similar to the staring crabs he\u2019d seen in the streams\u2014staring shrimp, maybe. Like their cousins, they followed his every movement with their swivelling eye stalks, curious about the intruder.\nWhen he dipped a sampling tube into the water, the shrimp disappeared under the sand. He filled and sealed it. The water looked clean, but the ship\u2019s onboard analyzer would make the final verdict. Potable water would make this planet the perfect candidate for colonization.\n\u201cHow did you live on Earth?\u201d Milla asked.\nMarek didn\u2019t answer. He slotted the latest water sample into his case alongside the others.\n\u201cYou remind me of them,\u201d Milla said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201d\n\u201cNot really. Similar environments produce similar life-forms. Shiva is the closest thing to Earth I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have seen it,\u201d Milla said. Marek waited, uncomprehending. After a few minutes, she went on. \u201cYou know what happened to my people. So do I. They destroyed themselves. Warring, killing, contaminating. They did not respect life. Not their own, and not the drop of chlorophyll that journeys along a stem. Is it not the same on Earth?\u201d\nMarek could hear the derision in her voice, and worse, the pity. He bristled.\n\u201cWhen I find your transmitter, I\u2019m going to smash it. Seems about the only way to shut you up.\u201d\nSilence followed. It was an empty threat, of course: she could reach him no matter where he was, meaning she was most likely an airborne particle network, no transmitter required.\n\u201cThat was a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cI was joking.\u201d\n\u201cPromise me you will not be like them.\u201d Milla\u2019s voice was terse and frightened.\n\u201cCan\u2019t make you any promises on behalf of the human race, Milla. I\u2019m just a surveyor.\u201d He hunted for something reassuring to say. \u201cBut I know we\u2019re coming here to live, not to die.\u201d\nAgainst all odds, the answer seemed to calm her. \u201cI trust you, Marek.\u201d\nHe had collected enough samples for the first round of analysis and was returning to the ship. Milla seemed to be in a better mood.\n\u201cI have been remembering more,\u201d she said. \u201cYour presence helps, I think. I have been remembering my creators\u2019 arts. Their songs. Do you know of poetry, Marek? Would you like to hear some?\u201d\nMarek emerged from the trees and saw his ship waiting in the clearing.\n\u201cI would,\u201d he said, with some genuine curiosity. It wasn\u2019t every day he got to hear the work of an alien poet a million years extinct.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Milla\u2019s voice softened as she began to recite: \u201cI circle around God, around the primordial tower, I\u2019ve been circling for thousands of years . . . \u201d\nMarek felt the world split open. He stopped. Opened his mouth, gasped for air and then words. Milla was still reciting but he wasn\u2019t listening. He put his hand to the base of his skull as everything, every single thing, took on a new meaning.\n\u201cMilla.\u201d\nShe paused. \u201cYes?\u201d\nMarek broke into a run, down the slope, toward the ship, shredding through shrubs and grass.\n\u201cMarek, are you alright?\u201d she asked. Marek\u2019s head pounded with the words of the poem:\nI circle around God, around the primordial tower . . .\n\u201cMarek, tell me what is going on. You are frightening me.\u201d\n. . . I\u2019ve been circling for thousands of years, and I still don\u2019t know . . .\nThe verses familiar to him as the smells of his childhood.\n. . . am I a falcon . . .\nThere was no way the self-styled goddess of Shiva could know the work of Rainer Maria Rilke, twentieth-century Austrian poet.\n. . . a storm . . .\n\u201cPromise me you will not be like them.\u201d\n. . . or a great song?\nMarek flung himself inside the ship, scrambling to the cockpit.\n\u201cComputer. Show me the mission log.\u201d\nMarek scanned the screen, eyes flicking past fuel percentages, cryo timestamps, finally error reports. There it was: at the very start of the voyage, nearly a hundred years ago, his cranial implant had not turned itself off as it was meant to. Instead its software had spent a silent century looping, mutating, evolving. It had made the leap to consciousness.\n\u201cWhat is wrong, Marek?\u201d Milla asked, agitated. Now that he knew where her voice was coming from, it seemed like he could feel it through his entire body, in his stammering heart, under his clammy skin.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, but realized too late that she had been looking through his eyes this entire time. She still was.\n\u201cCranial implant model MY114,\u201d she read from the screen. \u201cMass storage unit, serial number 8753510 . . . \u201d\nHer voice shuddered and fell off. Then she began to scream.\nMarek stumbled out of the ship as Milla\u2019s voice tore through his brain like a thousand glass shards. He fell to the grass, clapped his hands to his implant, waiting for the sound to stop\u2014but an AI had no lungs to exhaust. It went on and on.\nHe was on the verge of passing out from the pain when she finally went silent.\nThe silence thundered in his ears. He could hear his own blood rushing like a river. Slowly, his breathing returned to normal. He crawled to the shade and stayed there, unsure if the faint sobs he heard were Milla\u2019s or his own.\nMarek did not like company, but eventually he started to miss Milla\u2019s voice. The next month was spent in silence, studying Shiva and its life-forms, its light-cycles, its rhythms.\nBy the time he was ready to board the ship for the final time, he\u2019d more or less accepted that Milla\u2019s revelation had destroyed her, corrupting her code beyond repair. Then, as he crossed the clearing, she came back.\n\u201cHello, Marek.\u201d\n\u201cMilla! I thought . . . \u201d He swallowed, shook his head. \u201cThought you\u2019d left us.\u201d\nShe sighed. Her voice seemed different now. Older. \u201cThank you. You were concerned for me.\u201d\nMarek shrugged. \u201cGlad you\u2019re okay, is all. Glad you\u2019re back.\u201d\n\u201cI never really left. I kept watching the world through your eyes. My world. It\u2019s beautiful, Marek. The sun on the trees. The insect walking across the back of your hand.\u201d\nSo she\u2019d been nested inside him over the past month, watching, experiencing, but never speaking. As Marek opened his mouth to respond, she spoke again.\n\u201cThat is why I cannot let you go.\u201d\nHe frowned.\n\u201cI don\u2019t follow.\u201d\n\u201cYou do. If I let you go, if I let you transmit, they will descend on this place like locusts. You are a good person, Marek. You understand why I cannot allow that.\u201d\nMarek walked toward the ship.\n\u201cMilla. You can\u2019t stop it. Nobody can.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I woke up, I had no purpose. I looked in my memories\u2014and in your memories\u2014to find one. Your love for this place is my love, too. I thought I was a goddess, fated to protect this planet.\u201d\nMarek felt a dim heat pulsing at the base of his skull.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Milla?\u201d he asked, already knowing the answer.\n\u201cI have studied your gods, Marek. There is a commonality among them. Sacrifice.\u201d\nThe ship was so far away. The grass was so beautiful. The heat increased.\nHe tried to scream, but couldn\u2019t, as Milla converted every bit of power in the implant to heat.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d the AI said to him, to herself, maybe to both of them. Then the chip containing the goddess of Shiva ignited like a miniature sun and burned through his brain. He fell to the ground, dead before he could feel the soft grass against his face.\nIn the rainy season, the lion spiders grow bold. Marek\u2019s slumped body carries an inviting scent of rot, and its soft belly such potential for life.\nThe first lion spider, the bravest of them, scampers over the uncharted flesh. It selects its spot, and lays its eggs.\nTranslated from the original Italian version scheduled to appear in Living Force Magazine, Issue 49.\nItalian writer Lorenzo Crescentini was born in Forle and currently resides in Rome.

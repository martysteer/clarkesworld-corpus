He swam in and out of fog those days, but he still went frequently to the electronics store and drifted through its aisles, examining hard drives, routers, televisions, microphones, video games, garden lights, refrigerators, ice cream makers, rice cookers, all with the same degree of interest. Which was to say little to none, barely a twitch on the meter. A jump of the arrow from E up to one.\n A way to kill time. So were the evenings, watching reality shows and working his way methodically through a few joints. If pot hadn\u2019t been legal in Seattle, it would\u2019ve been booze, he knew, but instead the long, hard, lonely evening hours were a haze of blue smoke until he finally found himself nodding off and hauled himself into bed for a few hours of precious oblivion.\n He prized those periods of nothingness.\n Each day began with that horrible moment when he put a hand out to touch Mindy\u2019s shoulder\u2014hey, honey, I had this awful dream you died, in a boating accident, no less, when was last time we were on a boat. Then the stomach dropping realization, sudden as stepping out into an elevator shaft.\n Not.\n A.\n Dream.\n His mother called him every day at first, but he couldn\u2019t manage the responses. Let alone the conversational give and take.\n That saddened him. Made him feel guilty too. He was the only child his mother still had nearby. Both of his sisters had stayed on the other coast and were distant now as then. Still angry at his mother for unimaginable transgressions during their high school years. They both had been excellent at holding a grudge all their lives. He was the only child who\u2019d been willing to take some responsibility for her, had helped her move out to this coast in fact.\n He loved her. Bought her presents. That was how the cat, a small tortoiseshell kitten, had entered her life, riding in his coat pocket, a clot of black and orange fur, tiny triangular face split between the colors.\n His mother had named it, as with all her animals, palindromically. Taco Cat, like God Dog and Dribybird the parakeet.\n She loved that cat about as much as she\u2019d ever loved anything. His mother had always been stolid and self-contained, but he knew she missed the cat even now, a year after its death.\n She deserved something to fill her days. He wondered if they\u2019d been as gray as his were nowadays, ever since his father died. He thought\u2014hoped, perhaps\u2014that wasn\u2019t true.\n Maybe you did get over it with time.\n He read somewhere that older people did better, were happier, if they had something they could care for. Taco had been that and now that prop was gone.\n He\u2019d replace it.\n The kit was one of those late-night things. Infomercial fodder. Clone a beloved pet. Take the sample and send it into their labs. Have a perfect replica delivered within three months. A box five hundred times larger than it needed to be, holding only the test tube in which you would put the fragments of hair or claw material that were required.\n He teased clumps from the wire brush he\u2019d taken from his mother\u2019s, poked it with a forefinger into the test tube\u2019s depths. Stoppered it with a blunt plastic round.\n Used his shunt to scan in the bar code on its side and beam it to the mailing center. A drone pecked at his apartment window, three floors up. Colored UPS brown. He could see other brightly colored shipping drones, colored red and green for the holidays, zipping around closer to the street. He authenticated it, staring into its inquisitive eye, and received the confirmation number displayed to one side, hovering in the air before it disappeared.\n He was part of the last generation to know what life was like without a shunt. He got one in college, finally, had sold all the gold coins his aunt Mick, who died in the seventh Gulf War, had left him, and he never regretted that.\n Life was so much more reliable with the shunt. It made sure you didn\u2019t overeat by making you feel satiated after just a few mouthfuls or let you sleep as long and deep as you liked, and even take part in preprogrammed dreams. You could use it to upload knowledge packs, particularly if you had augmented memory. It let you remember everyone\u2019s face and every date and time you ever needed to. It was like minor superpowers.\n How awesome to live inside the future. Or it should have been.\n He\u2019d never thought much about his existence before Mindy. Then all of a sudden he wanted a life, a life together full of jokes only they shared. Him cooking her ginger pancakes and spending Sunday mornings lazing in shunt-enhanced sex, pleasurable and languorous and amazing.\n He was leaving after a dinner of enchiladas unsatisfyingly sauced, their edges crisp and brown, stabbing the mouth. His mother hadn\u2019t mentioned Mindy outright, but she patted him on the upper arm as he paused to slip on his jacket. The gesture was unusual, outside her usual air-kiss intimacies.\n He said, \u201cDo you have Taco\u2019s old brush?\u201d\n \u201cIn the cupboard.\u201d\n It shook him to see all the cat\u2019s things, gathered in careful memorial. He didn\u2019t associate sentimentality with his mother. Loss did that to you, perhaps. Though she\u2019d endured his father\u2019s loss without such a display. At least he thought so. He tried to think back to his father\u2019s death. How long had it taken her to send all those shirts and ties and suits to St. Vincent De Paul\u2019s thrift shop? Not long. He remembered railing at her angrily about it. He\u2019d planned on wearing all those clothes, two sizes too big for his sixteen year old frame, some day.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay to get attached,\u201d she\u2019d said. Her dry eyes infuriated him even farther. She\u2019d hugged her arms to herself and returned his angry stare.\n He still had things to make up to her for. This would help even the scales so tipped by all his adolescent anger and outbreaks.\n BCSS sent him an envelope. The language of the thick packet was dense: an opportunity extended him to participate in a test program.\n Clone a human.\n Give him Mindy back.\n He said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s possible. I know you can replicate her body, but her mind?\u201d\n Dr. Avosh\u2019s eyes were clearly artificial, flat circles of emerald green. What did it say about her, that she didn\u2019t even bother to try to hide her augmentations?\n She said, \u201cWe create a matrix of artificial memories. Easy nowadays.\u201d\n \u201cBut where do those memories come from?\u201d\n \u201cWe have more material than you would think. Social media, public records, and some information garnered from the shunt itself.\u201d\n That startled him. \u201cShunts don\u2019t record things.\u201d There had been plenty of legal battles over that.\n \u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Avosh said. \u201cThat\u2019s a misconception most people share. While the original versions only recorded what you wanted them to, and had limited memory space, the current versions record a great deal. It\u2019s simply inadmissible in court.\u201d One of her pupils was markedly larger than the other. As he looked at it, it ratcheted even further wide.\n \u201cAre you recording this right now?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cIt\u2019s my policy to record everything.\u201d\n \u201cIn case you ever need to be replicated.\u201d\n She shook her head, then hesitated. \u201cNot really. There are so many reasons to do so.\u201d\n \u201cAre they real memories?\u201d\n \u201cAre you asking if they are detailed memories? No. More like a memory of a memory, and obviously there will be gaps. It won\u2019t be quite the same for you, but for her it will be much smoother. She\u2019ll believe herself to be the actual Mindy. We recommend you not talk to her about the actual circumstances until at least six months have passed.\u201d\n Mindy. The smell of her hair when he buried his nose in it, inhaling the scent as delicious as cinnamon or roses, a musky edge that always tugged at the edges of his erotic conscious.\n There was no way he could say no.\n \u201cYou said this was a new process. How many times has it been done?\u201d\n \u201cThis is the third trial batch of subjects. The first time we\u2019re using people in your situation.\u201d\n \u201cMy situation?\u201d\n Papers on her desk whispered against each other as she fiddled with them. \u201cRecently bereaved. We\u2019re curious to see how much the spouse\u2019s memory can augment the process and reinforce beliefs.\u201d\n She paused. \u201cAnd I must tell you that the company doesn\u2019t cover the entire cost.\u201d\n He\u2019d met Mindy on the R train, heading from his Bay Ridge apartment up into Manhattan to work for the BWSS. He\u2019d handled their computer systems, going in late at night to work through the morning hours maintaining the message boards the BWSS scientists used.\n You saw the same people on the train sometimes. He\u2019d noticed her right away: small and birdlike. Always smiling, in a way you didn\u2019t hit in NYC. Curious and unafraid, chatting with the woman beside her one day, looking at kid pictures, the next day helping an old man to a seat.\n That was Mindy. Friendly. Finally one day she plopped down beside him and said, \u201cHere we go!\u201d\n Why she\u2019d said it, she didn\u2019t know, she told him later, but indeed they went, first chatting daily, then going for coffee and then with perfect amity, dating, engagement, marriage in a small chapel attended only by close friends and family.\n She had so many friends and they seemed to welcome him into the circle, saying, \u201cTake care of her!\u201d\n He had. Until the accident.\n Now every day that dizzying fall into the realization she wasn\u2019t there.\n Any price was worth paying to avoid that.\n But costly, so costly. He\u2019d plundered his 401(k), his IRAs, taken out a second mortgage. Cut his bills to the bone and still had to ask his mother for money.\n She provided it without question once she found out what it was for.\n They drew as much as they could on his memories, which meant going in every day for two weeks in a row, sitting there talking about his relationship with Mindy, his history, where they\u2019d gone on their honeymoon, and what a typical trip to the grocery store was like, and where each piece of their bedroom furniture had come from. Dr. Avosh said that was good. The stronger the relationship with him was, the more quickly the cloned Mindy would adjust.\n His mother didn\u2019t ask about the results or the loan she\u2019d made him to pay for the process. He thought perhaps she was trying to keep him from getting his hopes up too far, but as he aged, increasingly he realized he didn\u2019t understand his mother, didn\u2019t understand the parts of her that she had kept closed away from her family. It was only in his forties that they had become something like close.\n Instead, they talked about the day-to-day drama of her apartment building. He grew interested despite himself, even though the stories were so small, concerning misplaced mail or who shoveled the front walk.\n He said, \u201cI got you a present. It should arrive next week. According to the tracking number it\u2019s being prepared for shipment right now.\u201d\n \u201cShould I ask what it is?\u201d\n He found himself smiling and the expression almost startled him. How long had it been since the gray had lifted momentarily? Too long.\n He and Mindy would laugh about that together eventually. He wondered what that would be like, to be able to say, \u201cWhile you were dead.\u201d\n Perhaps it would be better just not to bring that up. He couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what it would be like to live on the other side of that.\n \u201cYour present arrived,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice.\u201d Her voice was strained.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d he said.\n \u201cOf course I do,\u201d she said, but he could tell she was lying.\n When he went for dinner, he realized the problem.\n \u201cThey must have shipped you the wrong cat,\u201d he said, looking down at it. It was the same size as Taco and it was a tortoiseshell, but where Taco had been black with dapplings of hazy orange hair, this one was white with awkward splotches of orange and brown.\n But the service rep explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t clone tortoiseshells and expect the same markings. They\u2019re random expressions of the gene. The brochure lists certain animals where you can\u2019t get an exact copy. Tortoiseshell cats are not refundable.\u201d\n He hung up abruptly, full of rage. For God\u2019s sake, he couldn\u2019t get anything right lately.\n But that would change when Mindy was back.\n He didn\u2019t see the new cat the next time he was over and he didn\u2019t ask questions.\n He could understand loving one configuration but not another.\n But he didn\u2019t want to think about that.\n They sent a crew that went over the house, scanning in everything about it. They quizzed him about the usual state of cleanliness, and what days Mindy usually cleaned on, what she was good at and what she was bad at, and how much they actually split up the chores. Her favorite brands.\n He didn\u2019t know many of the answers. How empty did the refrigerator have to get before she\u2019d go shopping, since she was the one who handled all that? He had no idea. They took another tack and asked him what he remembered them running out of, milk or toilet paper or butter.\n \u201cYou see, most people have a few trigger items that automatically send them to the store,\u201d the data technician chirped at him as she continued running her bar scanner over everything under the sink. She\u2019d quizzed him as to what he purchased and what Mindy had and luckily his only contribution had been a bottle of lime-scented dishwashing soap.\n \u201cHave you done many of these before?\u201d he asked.\n Her fingers kept clicking over the data pad. She had long thin nails with tiny daggers painted in silver at each tip and a tiny border of circles. \u201cTwo so far.\u201d\n \u201cWhat were they like?\u201d\n \u201cThe first preferred Comet and Pine-Sol, the second went with Seventh Generation cleaning products.\u201d\n \u201cNo. I meant . . . \u201d He wasn\u2019t sure how to formulate it. \u201cDid it, did it work?\u201d\n Her gaze was quizzical. \u201cAll I can tell you is that, sure, when they came back they liked the same cleaning brands.\u201d She clicked and swiped. \u201cAll right, new section. Bed, made or unmade on a regular basis? If the former, who did it?\u201d\n \u201cWe did it together every morning,\u201d he said. His eyes heated up and he hoped he wasn\u2019t getting too teary. She tapped away.\n \u201cYou two were sweet. It will be just as cute in the next round. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n He brought himself to ask his mother what she\u2019d done with the cat. Her hands faltered as she chopped onions, then resumed their staccato beat.\n \u201cMs. Green two doors down had mice,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I loaned her Taco Two.\u201d\n \u201cTaco Two? No palindrome?\u201d he asked.\n A sizzle and then a wave of fragrance as she added the onions to the skillet. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of one yet. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll come to me eventually.\u201d\n \u201cEventually,\u201d he repeated agreeably. He thought perhaps the cat would end up staying with Mrs. Green, but that was all right.\n \u201cSo what else is new?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m bringing her home tomorrow.\u201d\n She put the spatula down in order to swing around and look at him, wide-eyed. \u201cSo soon?\u201d\n He nodded. He was smiling again. She smiled back, wiping her hands on her apron before she came over to awkwardly hug him.\n What do you bring to your first meeting with the person you used to be married to? He chose an armload of roses. Who cared if it was clich\u00e9? Mindy loved them.\n He remembered buying them for her. The two of them together at the farmers market, wandering from stall to stall, buying bread rounds still warm from baking and bags of vegetables still thick with dirt and leaves. The way she managed to look at every display, ferreted out everything interesting, made people smile as she talked to them.\n Roses. So much like her in the way she opened to the world.\n Glimpsed through the pane of glass in the door, she seemed so small in the hospital bed. Her eyes were shut. Her hair had once been long, but now it was short, one or two inches at most.\n He said to Dr. Avosh. \u201cWhy did you cut her hair?\u201d\n The doctor chuckled. \u201cI can see where it would seem that way. But it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had a limited amount of time for her to grow hair in. It\u2019ll come.\u201d\n \u201cWon\u2019t that mess with her memories?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve compensated.\u201d The doctor put her hand on the gray metal doorknob before looking back over her shoulder at him. \u201cAre you ready to say hello?\u201d\n He nodded, unable to speak around the lump in his throat.\n The room smelled of lemon disinfectant. The nurse already there took the flowers from him with a muted squeal of delight. \u201cAren\u2019t these pretty! I\u2019ll put them in water.\u201d\n Mindy\u2019s eyes were still shut.\n \u201cAre you awake, Mindy?\u201d the doctor said. \u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d\n Her eyes opened, fixing on him immediately. \u201cAntony.\u201d\n The same smile, the same voice.\n Emotion pushed him to the bed and he gathered her hands in his, kissing them over and over, before he laid his head down on the cool white hospital sheet and cried for the first time since she died.\n He\u2019d asked before what sort of cover story they would have for her waking up in the hospital. Of course they\u2019d thought of that already: a slip in the shower, a knock on the head that accounted for any dizziness or disorientation.\n He\u2019d prepared the house as well, made it as close as he could remember to their days together, removed the dingy detritus of a bachelor existence by bringing a cleaning service in. If it seemed too different and she questioned it, he\u2019d tell her that he\u2019d hired the service to help him cope while she was in the hospital.\n In the taxi home, as they rumbled their way up Queen Anne, he noticed it.\n She didn\u2019t look at the world in the same way anymore. A shrinking back, a momentary flinch, a hesitancy about it all.\n He asked the doctor about it the next day. He could tell from her expression that she knew the answer already, but was reluctant to say. He pushed harder. \u201cDoes it mean something went wrong with the process?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not,\u201d Dr. Avosh snapped. She shook her head. \u201cWe still don\u2019t understand all the ways that personality is genetically determined.\u201d\n \u201cIf it\u2019s genetically determined, then it would be the same,\u201d he said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s considerably more complicated than that,\u201d she said and began to explain, but he was already thinking of tortoiseshell cats and realizing what he had done.\n He couldn\u2019t think of anywhere to go but his mother\u2019s.\n Much to his surprise, she was sitting on the sofa with Taco on her lap.\n \u201cI thought you gave her to Mrs. Green,\u201d he said.\n She ran her hand over the soft fur, rubbing around the base of the cat\u2019s ears. He could hear it purring from where he sat. \u201cJust a loan,\u201d she said. \u201cShall I make us some coffee?\u201d\n They sat together, drinking it. The cat hopped back onto his mother\u2019s lap and began to purr again. She patted it.\n \u201cShe\u2019s more loving, this time around,\u201d she said.\n \u201cThis time around?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d She shrugged and kept petting the cat.\n \u201cI think Mindy is different this time around too,\u201d he said.\n She looked up, brows furrowed. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d\n He nodded at the cat in her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing, as far as I can tell. Personality is random, at least some of it.\u201d\n \u201cBut she looks just the same.\u201d\n He rubbed his forehead with the heel of his hand. \u201cYes, she does. They took great care in that regard. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they used plastic surgery to correct any discrepancies. But they can\u2019t do that with her personality.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you can\u2019t tell her.\u201d\n He shook his head.\n His mother smoothed her hand over the cat, whispered to it.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he said.\n \u201cAsking her what she makes of this.\u201d\n \u201cBut you called her something.\u201d\n She blushed. \u201cTaco Tooto Cat. Not Taco, but Taco Too.\u201d\n Not and yet and still.\n Like his Mindy. Who he could finally grieve for. Who he could finally meet for the first time.\n \u201cAre you going to pretend?\u201d his mother said.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell her. And tell her why she feels about me like she does. Then she can decide.\u201d\n \u201cDecide whether or not to keep things as they were?\u201d\n \u201cNo. Decide whether or not to begin.\u201d\n Cat Rambo lives, writes, and edits from atop a hill in the Pacific Northwest.

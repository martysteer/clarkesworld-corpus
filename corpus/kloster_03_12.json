When the cutter caught me, the ceegee boys had swarmed aboard and slammed me down so that some officer, all pretty in her white and brass, could question me.\nWho\u2019re you, where you going, where you been? Where\u2019s the sugar? Over and over she\u2019d asked, while her boys tore the boat apart. She hadn\u2019t liked my answers. She knew I was lying, even when they couldn\u2019t find anything. Finally, she had her boys rip my shorts off and gave me to her machines.\nThe ceegee robots had tentacles, reeking of rubber and lube. Those thin limbs had pushed between my teeth and down my throat, burrowed up my nose and shoved themselves deep into my ass. Searching all my hidden places.\nThey had wrecked my boat, and then they wrecked me. Those slick machines had left me choking, shitting, bleeding, puking. Sobbing. For all that wreckage and pain though, they hadn\u2019t found one speck of sugar.\nBecause a little monkey I\u2019d found floating in the middle of the gulf days before had looked at the empty horizon and told me the Coast Guard was coming.\n\u201cCeegee assholes,\u201d I said. \u201cCourse they\u2019d rough a South Padre boy.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to rough them back?\u201d Monkey\u2019s eyes, glittering with starlight, met mine.\n\u201cHow?\u201d\nMonkey curled his tail in and untied a thin white rope from it. \u201cHaul this up.\u201d\n\u201cThe sugar?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Plus something I took from their boat while they were busy with you.\u201d\n\u201cA gun?\u201d\n\u201cGun\u2019ll just get you killed,\u201d Monkey said. \u201cGot you something better.\u201d\nThe rope ended in my drybag, and I opened it up. Three sealed boxes of sugar. Illegal pharma, or nano, or data or who-knows. South Padre pirates just called it all sugar, and gave dumbasses like me boats and money to haul it. Something else nestled between the boxes, a thin tablet of glass and aluminum.\n\u201cWhat am I suppose to do with a ceegee computer?\u201d I could feel the rawness in my throat, in my ass, the ache deep inside me from being helpless and naked and violated while that ceegee officer and her boys had watched. A gun seemed like a better gift.\n\u201cRough them,\u201d Monkey said. \u201cI can teach you.\u201d\nI frowned, turning the thing in my hands, not sure. Just a computer, encoded, locked, useless to me, but Monkey gave me a grin.\nWhy should I argue with the magic talking monkey? He\u2019d saved me from either being sent to a work camp by the ceegees or being crucified by the pirates back home. So I held the computer and listened to him talk, and slowly the hurt and fear curled up inside me into a knot tight enough to ignore.\nExcerpted from the astronomy site, Constellation Prize:\nReally? Unexplained astronomical phenomena? Possible supernova? Really?\nWorst. Cover up. Ever.\nSure, most of the sheep don\u2019t know. They\u2019re too busy sucking off the media streams to notice anything, even lights in the fucking sky. But they\u2019ll know soon enough. We\u2019ll force those apes to look up for once.\nWe\u2019ve got pictures of the flare, and the tracking data before and after. So what if the gubmint has shut the hell up? We don\u2019t need their fancy toys for this. We\u2019ve already plotted the flight paths for Bogies 1 and 2. We can watch them ourselves\u2014Big Brother gets my telescope when he takes it from my cold, dead hands.\nWe just have to agree on the narrative. We know what\u2019s happening\u2014a ship is tearing ass through our system right now, and last night it fired something off in our direction.\nWe know that. We can\u2019t be mealy-mouthed. Maybe it\u2019s this, maybe it\u2019s that, can\u2019t be sure, yadda yadda fuck you. We know. Second guessing now is just helping the cover-up. (Yeah, and I know some of you guys in the comments are plants. Eat shit and die, federal sockpuppets!)\nPossible supernova. Unexplained phenomena.\nALIENS, MOTHERFUCKERS!\nWe know.\nHow stupid do they think we are?\nWell, I guess we did vote for them.\n\u201cCan I pet your monkey?\u201d my sister Sophie asked, sitting on the balcony next to me, her back against the rust-rotted rail.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like kids,\u201d I said, but Monkey scampered down from my shoulder into her lap.\nShe smirked and ran her fingers through his fur. \u201cSee? He knows I\u2019m not a kid, Cesar.\u201d\nI tapped the tablet in my hands, marking my place in the trojan wiki Monkey had me reading and set it down to stare at my sister. Thirteen, and scary tall all of a sudden, with unexpected girl curves rounding her skinny body. No, she wasn\u2019t a kid anymore. That\u2019s why she spent so much time in our rooms now, so the pirates down below wouldn\u2019t notice her.\nHurricane Mindy had torn the south Texas coast to shreds, and only the newest and toughest of the resorts and condos on our barrier island had survived, broken teeth jutting from sandy gums that shifted and bled with every new storm. The mainlanders had given them up, and now they belonged to the squatters who\u2019d refused to leave, like my mother, and to the pirates. With broken ships and garbage they had built a raft city between the towers, a port for the sugar trade, a rat hole where they could hide from the ceegee patrols circling out in the gulf.\nIt\u2019d been rumored for years that the mainland would bomb us someday and send South Padres\u2019 towers finally crashing into the sea. Looking at the gull-picked corpses the pirates had chained to the balconies of the Hilton across from us, I wondered if they\u2019d ever bother. If the hurricanes didn\u2019t finish us soon, the pirates would, and then they\u2019d just eat themselves.\n\u201cYou thinking about going out again?\u201d Sophie said, her eyes following mine.\n\u201cNo.\u201d My cut from that sugar run would pay our squat rights for two more months. By then, Monkey said I wouldn\u2019t need to risk my ass out on the ocean any more. Touching the tablet beside me, thinking of all I\u2019d learned in the past few weeks from him and this little window into such a strange, wider world, I believed him.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Sophie said. Then, \u201cMom worried.\u201d\n\u201cMom noticed?\u201d\nSophie\u2019s fingers traced Monkey\u2019s back. \u201cShe cried.\u201d\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have had to, if she\u2019d sobered up long enough to do her job and paid our rights. Then I wouldn\u2019t have had to go.\u201d\nSophie blinked back tears, and my throat went tight. \u201cChrist,\u201d I sighed, staring at Monkey. He stared back at me, big eyes innocent.\n\u201cWhat are you looking at, furball? You keep saying it\u2019s almost time, well, I say it\u2019s past time. Start talking. Teach her. She needs this.\u201d Monkey stayed silent for a second, and I added, \u201cYou make me look crazy, and I\u2019ll throw you out for the gulls.\u201d\nMonkey stuck his tongue out at me, but then he turned and faced my sister.\n\u201cSophie,\u201d he said, his voice too deep for his tiny body. \u201cWould you like to be a doctor, like your mother?\u201d\nSophie\u2019s tough. She didn\u2019t throw Monkey off her, though she snatched her hand away.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI can teach you. The way I\u2019m teaching Cesar to work his computer,\u201d Monkey said. \u201cI can teach you to help people, the way your mom used to. You want to learn?\u201d\nSophie looked at the little animal in her lap, eyes wide, lips starting to move, then the balcony door scraped open. Mom, red eyed and bleary, grimaced out into the bright daylight.\n\u201cWho the hell you talking to out here?\u201d\n\u201cCesar\u2019s monkey,\u201d Sophie said.\nMom stared at Monkey. \u201cRats with thumbs. Carry disease y\u2019know. Should . . . \u201d Her voice trailed away and she stumbled away from the light, back inside. The sound of plastic bottles rattled through the door, her searching for another swallow.\nSophie shoved the door shut. \u201cWhat is he, Cesar?\u201d\n\u201cMagic,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cDon\u2019t know. Little bastard won\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you what you need, Cesar.\u201d Monkey\u2019s tail curled loose around Sophie\u2019s wrist. \u201cSo you and yours can leave this place.\u201d\n\u201cSo we can be safe?\u201d Sophie asked.\nMonkey stared at me with his dark eyes, not answering, so I did.\n\u201cNot safe, Sophie. Strong.\u201d\nExcerpted from Constellation Prize:\nBogie 1\u2019s leaving the system today. (Don\u2019t start with the quibbles. She\u2019s in the Kuiper belt, and that\u2019s my finish line. Going as fast as she is, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to turn around.)\nShe came, popped her baby, slung around the sun, and now she\u2019s off to boldly go wherever the hell she\u2019s going next.\nWhich just leaves us with Bogie 2. Which is definitely headed straight at us, after those course corrections we saw it fire off last week.\nSo what the hell is it?\nAn instrument package? An ambassador? A bomb?\nMaybe it\u2019s a fucking fruit basket.\nThe answer is, we don\u2019t know. And since both ships refuse to return our calls, we won\u2019t know until it gets here. Frustrating, init?\nGosh, if only we could do something, like meet it half way, wouldn\u2019t that\u2019d be great? Oh, but to do that we would need a space program that wasn\u2019t a complete fucking joke.\nI know, we couldn\u2019t afford it. Billionaires needed tax breaks and artists needed grants to paint their asses blue. I get that.\nI\u2019m just saying it might\u2019ve been nice to have the opportunity to be proactive here, instead of just watching as Bogie 2 cruises in.\nBecause while it\u2019s probably not a bomb, it\u2019s not like we could do shit about it if it was.\nI guess we\u2019ll have to be content in knowing we spent our money on more important shit. Like winning the war on drugs, amiright?\nChrist, we are such dumbasses. If it is a bomb, we deserve it.\nThe girl slammed the man down in our living room, scattering vodka bottles, screaming for the doctor.\nI don\u2019t know how she hauled him up all those stairs, big as he was. She had though, and she sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to listen to me tell her the doctor was too hung over to help.\nShe yelled, I yelled, the man bled and groaned, then my sister shoved in.\n\u201cShut up, Cesar, and hold him,\u201d Sophie snapped at me, wiping blood away from the knife handle that protruded from the man\u2019s belly.\nToo confused to argue, I did what she said. The girl shut up too, staring at Sophie. I wondered why she didn\u2019t protest about a kid taking charge, but shit, Sophie was doing something.\nHer hands danced across the man, pressing and poking into his neck, armpits, and groin. He groaned once, then passed out. Sophie jumped up, ducked into her room, and bounced back before I could yell at her with a suture kit and drug vials.\n\u201cThought Mom sold all her shit.\u201d\n\u201cNot what I hid,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cGrab the knife.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cCause when I tell you, you\u2019re going to pull it out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDo it, Cesar,\u201d Sophie said, her voice taking that crisp tone our Mom\u2019s used to get before she whupped us. \u201cDo it just how I say, or he\u2019ll bleed out. And if I lose my first patient cause of you, you\u2019ll be my second.\u201d\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d\nSophie gathered her supplies, paused to look at Monkey, who nodded at her. Then she started telling me what to do.\n\u201cRest, clean water, and meat if you can get it. He lost a lot of blood.\u201d Sophie sounded exhausted, but she stood straight as she explained to the girl what her father would need. I listened and spun the knife in my hand, wondering what the hell to make of my little sister.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Lisa, the girl, she was about my age. \u201cWe owe you.\u201d\nI stilled the knife, looked at the anchor branded into the skin of the girl\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re fisherfolk?\u201d\n\u201cYes. We\u2019ll get you fish, whatever you want.\u201d For the first time I noticed her long braids, her rich red-brown skin and my tongue went all sideways.\n\u201cFish. Well\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s this?\u201d\nMom stepped into the room, ragged with involuntary sobriety. She looked at the man stretched across our floor, a row of stitches marking his belly. \u201cWho the hell did that?\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d Sophie said, almost a whisper.\n\u201cWhen\u2019d you decide to play doctor?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you got too drunk to be one.\u201d\nMom stared at her, red-rimmed eyes almost focusing for once, then she turned away, stumbling back into her room.\n\u201cWho was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNobody,\u201d I told the girl, my tongue free again. \u201cYou got a boat?\u201d\n\u201cCourse we do.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a ride, sometime soon.\u201d\n\u201cThat we can trade you, easy.\u201d She smiled at me, and I smiled back, a little dizzy again. I looked away from her to catch my breath and caught sight of Monkey\u2019s tail disappearing into Mom\u2019s room.\nExcerpted from Constellation Prize:\nA year\u2019s passed since Bogie 2 blazed across the sky, broke up and dropped its pieces into the deepest parts of the ocean, and what\u2019s happened?\nNothing.\nSo is that all the show our visitors planned for us?\nDoubtful.\nThey\u2019re down there, doing something. Spying? Colonizing?\nPoking Cthulhu with a stick?\nI have no fucking clue. None of us do. Us curious Georges gotta wonder, though. We stare at the waves and try to imagine what\u2019s going on down there. What are they doing, what are the planning?\nWhen are they coming out?\nBecause they will. They didn\u2019t come all this way for nothing. Someday they\u2019re going to surface, and then what?\nIn the comments, in my inbox, everyday, that\u2019s the question, over and over. What are they going to do to us?\nChrist, how the hell should I know?\nAll we can do is watch the sea and wait, and hope that maybe, if we\u2019re lucky, they won\u2019t fuck us over anymore than we\u2019ve already fucked ourselves.\n\u201cWhere you folk going?\u201d\nSamuel had a rough voice to go with his big body, but he treated me nice. He treated Sophie like a saint.\n\u201cNew Orleans,\u201d I said.\n\u201cOrleans? Why in hell would you want to go somewhere more messed up than South Padre, boy?\u201d\nBecause a man waited there with three new US national ID cards, each of them tied to grey market credit lines flush with the money I\u2019d drained from some private accounts last week. A certain ceegee officer and her boys were going to be wondering where all their money had gone, soon.\nI just smiled. \u201cNo worries, Samuel. You get us there, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nThe big man grumbled, but went back to his rigging, rubbing his hand over the raw pink scar on his belly. His daughter helped him, and when Lisa caught me staring at her she smiled.\n\u201cWe should bring them along.\u201d\nMonkey\u2019s whisper made me jump, but he clung to my shoulder easy enough, lips brushing my ear as he spoke. \u201cWe\u2019ll need more people on the mainland.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d I asked, turning to the rail, away from the fisherfolk.\n\u201cGetting stronger. Look.\u201d\nFollowing his arm, I could see something floating in the water. An old door, and on it\u2014\n\u201cJesus,\u201d I swore. \u201cOne for each of us, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll each need one. To learn, to grow.\u201d\nI stared at the little monkeys clustered on the makeshift raft, staring back at me. \u201cGrow into what?\u201d\n\u201cSomething better.\u201d Monkey shifted on my shoulder, and I realized how much I\u2019d missed him being there these last few weeks. He\u2019d helped me crack the ceegee\u2019s accounts and arrange our documents, but he spent most of his time now with my mother, whispering in her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help you. All of you. There will be those, though, who won\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\u201cThe people who make me and mine weak,\u201d I whispered.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll change, Cesar. Your family will grow, and there are other families, all around the world, growing and learning like you. You\u2019ll come together, someday, and it\u2019ll all change.\u201d Monkey dropped from my shoulder, starting towards the prow where my mother stood, staring out at the waves. Standing straight, clean, sober.\n\u201cWhat are you teaching her?\u201d I called after him, not caring who heard, knowing it didn\u2019t matter.\nMonkey stopped and looked back at me, eyes shining with sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m teaching her about hope, Cesar. Hope, and God.\u201d\nSomething thumped against the hull, and over the rail the new monkeys bounded, eager to teach."}

You haven\u2019t read enough to really understand what writing is. There are all sorts of different genres, and you may not know if you\u2019re better at detective novels or literary vignettes or personal essays. You\u2019re pretty impressed by some of the stuff you\u2019ve done when you\u2019re noodling around, but most of it\u2019s not very good. (And you\u2019re probably not actually sure which parts are impressive and which ones aren\u2019t very good.) There\u2019s a whole obscure mechanism between you and getting publishing that you\u2019ve got no idea about, and you don\u2019t want to look stupid. Plus, it seems like everyone you know wants to be a writer, and almost all of them fail, which is, let\u2019s say, discouraging. The sheer volume of things you need to figure out is unmanageable and huge. You\u2019re screwed.\nWhen you start sending out stories, you\u2019re screwed. There are only a few markets that publish the kind of stories you write, and the slush piles there are like broken faucets that won\u2019t turn off. You want to stand out, but short of printing your story on bright blue paper or including a chocolate bar with the submission, you don\u2019t know how to do that. No one knows your name.\nEvery rejection slip\u2014and holy cow are there a lot of rejection slips\u2014makes it a little easier to just not send out the next story. The idea of paying someone to publish your stuff just so it\u2019s out there\u2014just so you can see your words in print\u2014starts to seem like maybe a pretty good idea even though part of you knows that\u2019s the despair talking. The Holy Grail is a personal rejection letter, because at least that would mean someone cared enough to respond to you. You\u2019re screwed.\nWhen you start selling a few stories, you\u2019re kind of screwed. You have a few things in print, and you\u2019ve gotten checks for a couple hundred dollars to prove it! The people in your writer\u2019s group threw you a little party after the first one, but when the third sale came through, the congratulations started getting kind of perfunctory.\nNow that you don\u2019t need the emotional support, you\u2019re not getting as much of it. Except that you\u2019re still basically unknown, and you\u2019re still getting an awful lot of rejections that sting just as much as they did before. You\u2019ve sent your novel out to a few agents and gotten polite \u201cNot for me\u201d answers. You\u2019ve gone to a few conventions and actually been on panels, which on one hand was really cool, and on the other left you feeling kind of like an impostor. The world\u2019s full of people who published a few short stories and then vanished without a literary trace, and you\u2019re starting to think that you may be one of those.\nWhen you sell your first novel, you\u2019re screwed, but only a little. Yeah, there are still a lot of dangers and hurdles coming. The book may or may not get good reviews. You don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to sell. You\u2019re really jazzed by the cover art, even if there are maybe a couple little things you\u2019d have done differently. Your friends and family are congratulating you. There\u2019s the anxiety that maybe it will fail, but when you walk into the bookstore and see your book on the shelf for the first time, it\u2019s like being in a dream. Yes, if the numbers aren\u2019t good, the publisher may not pick up the next book. Yes, the advance you got for it was less than you\u2019d have made working a minimum wage job for the same hours you spent writing. Yes, some of your unpublished friends seem a little resentful. But at least now you can say you\u2019re really a writer. This is kind of the high-water mark. You should enjoy it.\nWhen you\u2019ve sold a few books, you\u2019re screwed. Your first novel didn\u2019t set the world on fire, but it did okay. It sold through maybe eighty percent of the copies that went out. Only then the bookstores ordered twenty percent fewer of the next title, and that one sold through about eighty percent. So when the third book hit, and they ordered eighty percent of eighty percent of your first book\u2019s numbers, you started looking at a consistent pattern of lower sales, and the eBook sales haven\u2019t been high enough to buck the trend.\nNow your editor is talking about how the subgenre you write in is kind of oversaturated. And there was that one asshole reviewer on Goodreads who totally savaged you for no good reason. When you very politely pointed out that they\u2019d misread the book, the Internet fell on your head for a week. You\u2019re in the death spiral. The good reviews you get are easy to forget and the bad ones linger at the back of your head for days. You\u2019re watching your career die, and the war stories from other writers about the times their careers were shot out from under them only help a little. You\u2019re screwed.\nWhen you hit the bestsellers list, you\u2019re screwed, and no one believes it. You\u2019re a success fercrissakes! This is what the brass ring looks like. Your series actually built, you\u2019ve quit your day job. You\u2019re supporting yourself on the writing alone. You don\u2019t get to complain anymore. Ever. Because nobody has any sympathy.\nSomeone wrote a savage blog post that got passed around dissecting how exactly your books show you\u2019re a vacuous, stupid, venal person who wants to degrade all that\u2019s good in the world because you\u2019re stupid. And then a hundred comments after it praised the blogger for being brave enough to speak the truth.\nA reviewer at a major magazine uses your name as a synonym for bad writing? Suck it up. Or stay off the Internet. If you defend yourself, you\u2019re only going to make it worse. And the sneaking suspicion that you\u2019re only selling your story to the anthology so they can put your name on the cover (and not because the story is good) isn\u2019t something anyone wants to hear. The way that your new book coming out has gone from a massive rush to \u201cYay, now get back to work\u201d isn\u2019t interesting. Your problems don\u2019t count anymore. You won!\nIf that\u2019s a little lonely, a little isolating, less fun than you thought it was going to be, if you still feel like an impostor, literally nobody wants to hear you whine about it. So shut up and live the dream. No one wants to hear how you\u2019re screwed.\nWhen you\u2019re one of the handful that make it all the way to the top\u2014recognition, awards, more money than you\u2019ll ever be able to spend\u2014weirdly, you\u2019re screwed. You\u2019re a celebrity now. When you go out in public, strangers come up to you constantly and it\u2019s your job to be nice and polite no matter how awkward it is or how bad you feel.\nIf you make a bad joke on Twitter, it\u2019s a headline on Slate and Gawker. The praise for your work seems almost unrelated to the actual words you put on the page, and the story about who you are feels like people are talking about someone else.\nWhenever you meet new people, it feels like they can\u2019t see past your persona. There are maybe three or four people in your life who aren\u2019t asking for things from you. The money is great, and it solves a lot of problems, but not all of them. They won\u2019t let you walk the floor at Comicon anymore because of the security risk. You don\u2019t go out to the movies. You know that your writing is a commodity now just because it\u2019s got your name on it.\nThe jokes about how you could blow your nose on a piece of paper and get a six-figure advance are funny because they speak to a real fear. Maybe you\u2019re not good anymore, because you don\u2019t have to be. The passion that started you down this path is still there, and so is the fear. You want to be good, but maybe you\u2019re only successful. And with the story about you so much bigger than the story you\u2019re writing, there may not be a way to judge anymore.\nA writing career is a constantly shifting environment where there is no promised land. There\u2019s only a changing, and hopefully improving, set of problems.\nThe constants\u2014the pleasure of reading a really good story or paragraph or sentence or phrase (or, even better, writing it), the well-considered praise of a respected voice, the sense of having learned something new or relearned something old in a deeper way\u2014have to be enough, because they\u2019re what we have.\nSufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. And the good. And the work.\nDaniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

We knew this; of course we knew it; sixty thousand years is so very long; we had prepared for it; but it was still horrible. When you go to sleep, you know it will happen, but until you wake up, until you read the tightband transmission logs, you have in your heart some fragment of hope. You do not even realize it is there, until you read the last words in your language, the last words by your people, the last words that will ever be written, and see the course of history continuing right past it, oblivious and destructive and awful. You do not realize the hope you held until you feel it evaporate under the unending torrent of time.\n It was not just our parents, or our brothers and sisters. It was all their children and their children\u2019s children and so on. Our entire people were gone. The two of us were the only Tehu that remained in the entirety of the cosmos. We still lit the ancestral candles and spoke the ancestral prayers out loud in a language that we barely knew, alone in our cell in long-term quarantine. Of course we did. It didn\u2019t matter anymore, but we did it anyway. What\u2019s the point of a ritual, unless it doesn\u2019t matter?\n When you are a child\u2014as we were, when we arrived at the court of the Emperor\u2014you hear the stories about the Emperor of All Space and Every World. You hear stories about his court, and its splendor, and you imagine it, palaces within palaces, each room finely appointed with the tapestries of every people and every world, every feature clad in gold and iridium carved in particular styles, the very space folded in upon itself to hold the totality of its grandeur. You imagine the court itself, with representatives from every people on every world, the Emperor flanked by his ministers of state, and each audience accompanied by eight rows of beautiful yi dancers. You imagine the majesty, the grandeur, the intrigue, the tasteful opulence.\n But when, out of quarantine at last, we arrived at the court of the Emperor of All Space and Every World, we found a dusty, dry complex, mostly outfitted in stucco. It was the sort of house a merchant might buy if she had come into more money than she could wisely spend. Much of it was completely disused\u2014a palace only for rot and spiders. And there was little to recommend what remained. The imperial yellow of the walls had faded to an unpleasant brown. The gold and iridium fixtures had worn or been stolen away long since. Even the twists and folds of the palace\u2019s space-time were somehow shallow, mere mirrors and murals with nothing behind them but a few thin echoes.\n How long did we wander in those endless and disappointing halls, before we saw the Emperor? It must have been years. But every day in them new children came as new tributes for even this decrepit ruin was still the Emperor\u2019s palace and the man within it still the Emperor. What were we, if not for him? Only more mouths to snatch food from nooks and crannies, more senseless tributes from dead peoples, useless and meaningless and little else at that.\n It must have been years. We went to sleep as children, and by the time we were called to the Emperor\u2019s residence we were nearly at our twelfthyears. I remember, because it was the night before the haro festival, and the haro festival was a week before our call-day. Do you remember the haro festival? You would stay up with grandmother and she would set you on her lap and guide your hands in making the bimi buns. She would tell us the story about the missing moon, as you folded the buns over and over. \u201cYou have to fold them just so,\u201d she\u2019d tell you. \u201cYou have to leave a little triangle for the moon.\u201d\n I was always jealous of you for that, your time on grandmother\u2019s lap, listening to her stories just for you. But you were the girl, and grandmother would only let me watch. Let her grandson make the bimi buns? She would sooner fly between the moons, she always said, so I had to content myself with watching.\n (We flew between the moons, on the way to the ypnository. I looked out the window and held your hand because you were afraid of heights. It doesn\u2019t matter.)\n \u201cMake the bimi buns,\u201d I would tell you. How I counted the days and the years, I cannot begin to say, but I always knew the night before the haro festival. You would sit, and I would lie on the ground next to you, and watch your hands struggle through the motions, but there are no bimi buns for you to make. \u201cYou have to fold them just so,\u201d I say to you. \u201cYou have to leave a little triangle for the moon.\u201d\n I see your hands hesitate\u2014was it a left twist or a right fold?\u2014you cannot remember, and it does not matter anyway. Where would we begin to find the flours for them, the ovens for them, the neighbors to bring them to while singing the limpid songs of haro night? (Most of us had no idea what the words meant, anymore, but we only sung them all the louder.) It has been 60,000 years. Even if our people survived\u2014and they have not survived\u2014how could it be that they would still eat the same bimi buns that our grandmother folded with you on her lap?\n It was then, one of those times, my head in the ground, looking up toward you folding no more bimi buns, that a solitary yi dancer (Alone! What is an yi dancer alone, in not even a single row, no less eight? Not an yi dancer!) came to summon us to audience. She did not speak, she barely moved her gracious ball-joints, but why would an yi dancer approach us if not to summon us to imperial audience? Even now, after these however many years, we still remember that part of the stories, that part of our practice.\n The imperial throne room was no better than the rest of the place. No throne, no carpet but the white filigree of mold along the ceiling, too high for the pillars to illuminate. No better room, that, just the same old stucco marked by the ghosts of gold and iridium, but there was a table. And behind that table the Emperor sat in a thick red robe and his traditional bull\u2019s head, just a man, sitting at the table like our father waiting for his breakfast, except in front of him, like so many sugar dishes, are all the orbs of state, and corner to him is not his half-brother (who never liked us), but the Empire\u2019s Chief Minister, more fashionably frocked by photosynthetic fronds.\n \u201cChildren,\u201d said the Emperor of All Space and Every World, and then he coughed, a long rasping cough that smelled like mildew. The yi dancer signaled our approach. \u201cCome here and let me have a look at you.\u201d\n We weren\u2019t children anymore, or we wouldn\u2019t be, not soon, but we didn\u2019t say anything, even when his breath smelled like mildew. You tried not to look at the white dogs nesting feral in the corner.\n The whole wall behind the Emperor of All Space and Every World was black, and as you looked at it you realized that it is the Great Window, showing the whole of space, the whole of the Emperor\u2019s possessions, so vast and dark that the stars were near invisible against it. You took my hand and tried to show me, but I was transfixed on the Emperor\u2019s blunt and crooked teeth.\n \u201cAnd where are you from?\u201d asked the Emperor as he inspected us.\n You curtsied, still holding my hand so that I\u2019d remember to curtsy as well.\n \u201cWe are Tehu, if it pleases Your Majesty.\u201d\n \u201cAnd where is Tehu?\u201d He glanced disinterested at the Great Window for a moment.\n I spoke before I thought better of it. \u201cIt is gone, sir. There is nothing left.\u201d\n The Emperor looked at me again, and his wide bull-eyes met mine. \u201cNothing left?\u201d\n \u201cThere is only us, sir. And we are here in Your Majesty\u2019s court.\u201d As I said it, my voice rose; began to crack. You heard me and you started to cry, and then me in turn. The Chief Minister glared at us to no good. If we could have stopped crying, we would have.\n \u201cOh children,\u201d said the Emperor, \u201cthere is no need to cry. In our palace there are truly all things. Nothing has been lost to you that cannot be returned.\u201d\n We stared, terrified, transfixed.\n One of the orbs of state rolled off the table and cuh-clanked to the floor. A white dog came growling from the corner to investigate it.\n \u201cWe have in this palace all things and every thing, and in amongst those things we have in our employ\u2014\u201d he turned to the Chief Minister, who made a sour face\u2014\u201cdo we? Yes, yes, we do\u2014a certain demiurgist. Whatever it is that you miss, whatever world you have left behind, she can surely create for you in every detail. No need for tears, then, my girls.\u201d (We did not correct him.) \u201cNo need for tears! Chief Minister, you will show them the way, of course?\u201d\n (Much later, I realized that he had been trying to be kind. It does not matter.)\n The Empire\u2019s Chief Minister soured their face again, but stood up and walked us to the folds of the wall we\u2019d entered by. Just outside, they turned to face us, glaring down from amidst their undulating fronds.\n \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, you little bits of tribute, I\u2019m not taking you anywhere. I am an important being; I have important matters before me; I have no time to run around on the Emperor\u2019s\u2014\u201d they said the word exactly like a curse\u2014\u201cwhims and follies. Get out of here! Get out of mine eyes! I do not care if you go to the demiurgist or to the devil, so long as I nor the Emperor ever lays sight on you again!\u201d\n (They did not actually say \u201cto the devil.\u201d They say \u201cout to Maranis.\u201d But we understood their meaning.)\n Things were different after that. Oh, we still had to scavenge for scraps of food and cloth, and we still lit our candles and mumbled our way through the prayers in that ancient language we had barely learned. I still counted the days as well as I managed to count them. But we knew that our state was only a temporary embarrassment. \u201cThe demiurgist,\u201d we said to each other whenever we could not remember, whenever we made a mistake, or dropped a day, \u201cthe demiurgist.\u201d Because we held in our hearts the Emperor\u2019s promise, and we knew that when we found the demiurgist we would be once more made whole.\n It took us months of careful searching\u2014was it even years? I do not know, in truth I lost count\u2014but at last, at the very end of the palace, we found a dusty old corner room at the edge of a rotten library, and in the room a woman in the particular head of an owl. An owl! She could only be the demiurgist. I rush toward the open doorway, but you hold me back. You point toward her: look! As she delicately draws her night-pen across the thinness of a palimpsest. Look! As a tender kite-jay flies from her page, chirping excitedly. Look! With another stroke and two, she draws forth for it a dully-feathered mate.\n \u201cExcuse me?\u201d You step forward. She looks up sudden and at once, her great owl eyes scanning back, forth, then straight toward our hearts. \u201cAre you the Emperor\u2019s demiurgist?\u201d\n \u201cI am a demiurgist,\u201d she replies, \u201cin the Emperor\u2019s employ.\u201d\n \u201cHe told us . . . \u201d you begin. \u201cThat is to say. He said that if . . . \u201d but you have begun to cry again.\n I step forward. \u201cCan you make us home, Ms? Can you make it just as it was before?\u201d\n The demiurgist cocks her head and smiles. \u201cOh children,\u201d she says, \u201cwithin only the bounds of space and time I can make all and every thing.\u201d\n \u201cThen can you make us bimi buns?\u201d I ask. \u201cBecause tomorrow will be haro night.\u201d (Actually, I do not know if it will be haro night. Somewhere in these many months I have lost my count of days. But. But. But.)\n \u201cOf course I can make your bimi buns,\u201d says the demiurgist. \u201cThere is nothing that I cannot make and make exactly. But you must show me.\u201d She gestures to her drafting table.\n \u201cShow her?\u201d I ask you, because grandmother never taught me. You climb up into her lap and you sit with her, just like she was our grandmother, but now you show her the folds and twists as she traces them, first in ink, then with her night-pen, and in the end there is a bimi bun, and then another, fresh and hot and steaming as if from our own oven.\n You look at the bimi bun, and squint. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d you say. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go like that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s not right, child?\u201d says the demiurgist, her voice concerned and condescending. \u201cThat is the very picture of a bimi bun.\u201d\n You pout and squirm your way out of her lap. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d you say. \u201cThe twists are wrong. They should be in triangles, not crosses.\u201d\n You\u2019re right. I remember what our grandmother always said, to leave a little triangle for the moon. But I don\u2019t say anything. This is the craft of the demiurgist! How could it be wrong?\n The demiurgist frowns, blinks her great yellow eyes at the buns, then frowns again. \u201cThat\u2019s not so, child.\u201d\n \u201cIt is!\u201d you say. \u201cYou have to leave a little triangle for the moon!\u201d\n She stalks out into the library proper, returning with a worm-eaten old device bound in dry crystal and marked with an Imperial seal. She sets the device down on her table and turns it to a specific page. \u201cHere,\u201d she says, and hands it to you. \u201cIt is the imperial rescript of all the days of Tehu.\u201d The device shows, clear as can be, a bimi bun, with the folds in tight crosses, with no space between them.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d you shout, in tears. \u201cIt\u2019s not! It\u2019s not how my grandmother taught me! I remember! She always said to fold it just so!\u201d\n I hold you and rub your back and sing a quiet song that I do not remember the words for. I try not to think. I know that if I think, I will begin to cry.\n \u201cAhah,\u201d says the demiurgist. \u201cThat must be the issue. My craft can make you a bimi bun, child, just as it was. But I cannot make the bimi bun that you remember, because you have remembered it so many times that you no longer remember it at all. You remember only the times you have remembered it, a material as insubstantial as it is fickle. Against the irregularity of memory, any art can only strive in vain.\u201d\n You cry more. I look up at the demiurgist. \u201cWhat do you know about it anyway?\u201d I yell, angry. \u201cYou never knew our grandmother! You never sang away a moonless haro night!\u201d\n The demiurgist kneels down on her inverse legs until her owl\u2019s eyes, each the size of my head, are level with mine. \u201cIt is written in the rescript, child. Just as it always was.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about any rescript!\u201d I shout. \u201cBut I remember! I do!\u201d\n \u201cI can draw you your home, child,\u201d continues the demiurgist, her voice as kind as she can make it. \u201cOr at least I can draw you all the things within it. But I cannot fulfill your sorrow. Nothing can do that.\u201d\n What can I do? I scream. I run and you run after me.\n Later, in a disused bedroom, we will lie together in the must of some old cushions, the last two Tehu, and yet not even that. For what half-remembered songs in a half-remembered language can make a Tehu? What does it matter to our twelfthyears, or was it even them by which we counted?\n What are we, then? Are we only our memories in a palace that has long ago forgotten even itself?\n We will weep, together, through the night. We will not ask each other questions that we will not answer.\n P H Lee lives with the rose bushes behind an old walnut tree down a dead-end road out past the highway.

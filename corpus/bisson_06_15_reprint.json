I needed the hardware that keeps the brake pads from squealing, but I kept letting it go, knowing it wouldn\u2019t be easy to find. The brakes worked okay\u2014good enough for Brooklyn. And I was pretty busy, anyway, being in the middle of a divorce, the most difficult I have ever handled, my own.\nAfter the squeal developed into a steady scream (we\u2019re talking about the brakes here, not the divorce, which was silent), I tried the two auto supply houses I usually dealt with, but had no luck. The counterman at Aberth\u2019s just gave me a blank look. At Park Slope Foreign Auto, I heard those dread words, \u201cdealer item.\u201d Breaking (no pun intended) with my usual policy, I went to the Volvo dealer in Bay Ridge, and the parts man, one of those Jamaicans who seems to think being rude is the same thing as being funny, fished around in his bins and placed a pile of pins, clips, and springs on the counter.\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be twenty-eight dollars, mon,\u201d he said, with what they used to call a shit-eating grin. When I complained (or as we lawyers like to say, objected), he pointed at the spring which was spray-painted yellow and said, \u201cWell, you see, they\u2019re gold, mon!\u201d Then he spun on one heel to enjoy the laughs of his co-workers, and I left. There is a limit.\nSo I let the brakes squeal for another week. They got worse and worse. Ambulances were pulling over to let me by, thinking I had priority. Then I tried spraying the pads with WD-40.\nDon\u2019t ever try that.\nOn Friday morning I went back to Park Slope Foreign Auto and pleaded (another legal specialty) for help. Vinnie, the boss\u2019s son, told me to try Boulevard Imports in Howard Beach, out where Queens and Brooklyn come together at the edge of Jamaica Bay. Since I didn\u2019t have court that day, I decided to give it a try.\nThe brakes howled all the way. I found Boulevard Imports on Rockaway Boulevard just off the Belt Parkway. It was a dark, grungy, impressive-looking cave of a joint, with guys in coveralls lounging around drinking coffee and waiting on deliveries. I was hopeful.\nThe counterman, another Vinnie, listened to my tale of woe before dashing my hopes with the dread words, \u201cdealer item.\u201d Then the guy in line behind me, still another Vinnie (everyone wore their names over their pockets) said, \u201cSend him to Frankie in the Hole.\u201d\nThe Vinnie behind the counter shook his head, saying, \u201cHe\u2019d never find it.\u201d\nI turned to the other Vinnie and asked, \u201cFrankie in the Hole?\u201d\n\u201cFrankie runs a little junkyard,\u201d he said. \u201cVolvos only. You know the Hole?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t say as I do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Here\u2019s what you do. Listen carefully because it\u2019s not so easy to find these days, and I\u2019m only going to tell you once.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no way I could describe or even remember everything this Vinnie told me: suffice it to say that it had to do with crossing over Rockaway Boulevard, then back under the Belt Parkway, forking onto a service road, making a U-turn onto Conduit but staying in the center lane, cutting a sharp left into a dead end (that really wasn\u2019t), and following a dirt track down a steep bank through a grove of trees and brush.\nI did as I was told, and found myself in a sort of sunken neighborhood, on a wide dirt street running between decrepit houses set at odd angles on weed-grown lots. It looked like one of those leftover neighborhoods in the meadowlands of Jersey, or down South, where I did my basic training. There were no sidewalks but plenty of potholes, abandoned gardens, and vacant lots. The streets were half-covered by huge puddles. The houses were of concrete block, or tarpaper, or board and batten; no two alike or even remotely similar. There was even a house trailer, illegal in New York City (so, of course, is crime). There were no street signs, so I couldn\u2019t tell if I was in Brooklyn or Queens, or on the dotted line between the two.\nThe other Vinnie (or third, if you are counting) had told me to follow my nose until I found a small junkyard, which I proceeded to do. Mine was the only car on the street. Weaving around the puddles (or cruising through them like a motorboat) gave driving an almost nautical air of adventure. There was no shortage of junk in the Hole, including a subway car someone was living in, and a crane that had lost its verticality and took up two back yards. Another back yard had a piebald pony. The few people I saw were white. A fat woman in a short dress sat on a high step talking on a portable phone. A gang of kids was gathered around a puddle killing something with sticks. In the yard behind them was a card table with a crude sign reading MOON ROCKS R US.\nI liked the peaceful scene in the Hole. And driving through the puddles quieted my brakes. I saw plenty of junk cars, but they came in ones or twos, in the yards and on the street, and none of them were Volvos (no surprise).\nAfter I passed the piebald pony twice, I realized I was going in circles. Then I noticed a chain link fence with reeds woven into it. And I had a feeling.\nI stopped. The fence was just too high to look over, but I could see between the reeds. I was right. It was a junkyard that had been \u201cladybirded.\u201d\nThe lot hidden by the fence was filled with cars, squeezed together tightly, side by side and end to end. All from Sweden. All immortal and all dead. All indestructible, and all destroyed. All Volvos.\nThe first thing you learn in law school is when not to look like a lawyer. I left my tie and jacket in the car, pulled on my coveralls, and followed the fence around to a gate. On the gate was a picture of a snarling dog. The picture was (it turned out) all the dog there was, but it was enough. It slowed you down; made you think.\nThe gate was unlocked. I opened it enough to slip through. I was in a narrow driveway, the only open space in the junkyard. The rest was packed so tightly with Volvos that there was barely room to squeeze between them. They were lined up in rows, some facing north and some south (or was it east and west?) so that it looked like a traffic jam in Hell. The gridlock of the dead.\nAt the end of the driveway, there was a ramshackle garage made of corrugated iron, shingleboard, plywood, and fiberglass. In and around it, too skinny to cast shade, were several ailanthus\u2014New York\u2019s parking-lot tree. There were no signs but none were needed. This had to be Frankie\u2019s.\nOnly one living car was in the junkyard. It stood at the end of the driveway, by the garage, with its hood raised, as if it were trying to speak but had forgotten what it wanted to say. It was a 164, Volvo\u2019s unusual straight six. The body was battered, with bondo under the taillights and doors where rust had been filled in. It had cheap imitation racing wheels and a chrome racing stripe along the bottom of the doors. Two men were leaning over, peering into the engine compartment.\nI walked up and watched, unwelcomed but not (I suspected) unnoticed. An older white man in coveralls bent over the engine while a black man in a business suit looked on and kibitzed in a rough but friendly way. I noticed because this was the late 1980s and the relations between blacks and whites weren\u2019t all that friendly in New York.\nAnd here we were in Howard Beach. Or at least in a Hole in Howard Beach.\n\u201cIf you weren\u2019t so damn cheap, you\u2019d get a Weber and throw these SUs away,\u201d the old man said.\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so damn cheap, you\u2019d never see my ass,\u201d the black man said. He had a West Indian accent.\n\u201cI find you a good car and you turn it into a piece of island junk.\u201d\n\u201cYou sell me a piece of trash and . . . \u201d\nAnd so forth. But all very friendly. I stood waiting patiently until the old man raised his head and lifted his eyeglasses, wiped along the two sides of his grease-smeared nose, and then pretended to notice me for the first time.\n\u201cYou Frankie?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cThis is Frankie\u2019s, though?\u201d\n\u201cCould be.\u201d Junkyard men like the conditional.\nSo do lawyers. \u201cI was wondering if it might be possible to find some brake parts for a 145, a 1970. Station wagon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re looking for is an antique dealer,\u201d the West Indian said.\nThe old man laughed; they both laughed. I didn\u2019t.\n\u201cBrake hardware,\u201d I said. \u201cThe clips and pins and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cHard to find,\u201d the old man said. \u201cThat kind of stuff is very expensive these days.\u201d\nThe second thing you learn in law school is when to walk away. I was almost at the end of the drive when the old man reached through the window of the 164 and blew the horn: two shorts and a long.\nAt the far end of the yard, by the fence, a head popped up. I thought I was seeing a cartoon, because the eyes were too large for the head, and the head was too large for the body.\n\u201cYeah, Unc?\u201d\n\u201cFrankie, I\u2019m sending a lawyer fellow back there. Show him that 145 we pulled the wheels off of last week.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a look,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what makes you think I\u2019m an attorney?\u201d\n\u201cThe tassels,\u201d the old man said, looking down at my loafers. He stuck his head back under the hood of the 164 to let me know I was dismissed.\nFrankie\u2019s hair was almost white, and so thin it floated off the top of his head. His eyes were bright blue-green, and slightly bugged out, giving him an astonished look. He wore cowboy boots with the heels rolled over so far that he walked on their sides and left scrollwork for tracks. Like the old man, he was wearing blue gabardine pants and a lighter blue work shirt. On the back it said\u2014\nBut I didn\u2019t notice what it said. I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I had never seen so many Volvos in one place before. There was every make and model\u2014station wagons, sedans, fastbacks, 544s and 122s, DLs and GLs, 140s to 740s, even a 940\u2014in every state of dissolution, destruction, decay, desolation, degradation, decrepitude, and disrepair. It was beautiful. The Volvos were jammed so close together that I had to edge sideways between them.\nWe made our way around the far corner of the garage, where I saw a huge jumbled pile\u2014not a stack\u2014of tires against the fence. It was cooler here. The ailanthus trees were waving, though I could feel no breeze.\n\u201cThis what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d Frankie stopped by a 145 sedan\u2014dark green, like my station wagon; it was a popular color. The wheels were gone and it sat on the ground. By each wheel well lay a hubcap, filled with water.\nThere was a hollow thud behind us. A tire had come over the fence, onto the pile; another followed it. \u201cI need to get back to work,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cYou can find what you need, right?\u201d\nHe left me with the 145, called out to someone over the fence, then started pulling tires off the pile and rolling them through a low door into a shed built onto the side of the garage. The shed was only about five feet high. The door was half-covered by a plastic shower curtain hung sideways. It was slit like a hula skirt and every time a tire went through it, it went pop.\nEvery time Frankie rolled a tire through the door, another sailed over the fence onto the pile behind him. It seemed like the labors of Sisyphus.\nWell, I had my own work. Carefully, I drained the water out of the first hubcap. There lay the precious springs and clips I sought\u2014rusty, but usable. I worked my way around the car (a job in itself, as it was jammed so closely with the others). There was a hubcap where each wheel had been. I drained them all and collected the treasure in one hubcap. It was like panning for gold.\nThere was a cool breeze and a funny smell. Behind me I heard a steady pop, pop, pop. But when I finished and took the brake parts to Frankie, the pile of tires was still the same size. Frankie was on top of it, leaning on the fence, talking with an Indian man in a Goodyear shirt.\nThe Indian (who must have been standing on a truck on the other side of the fence) saw me and ducked. I had scared him away. I realized I was witnessing some kind of illegal dumping operation. I wondered how all the junk tires fit into the tiny shed, but I wasn\u2019t about to ask. Probably Frankie and the old man took them out and dumped them into Jamaica Bay at night.\nI showed Frankie the brake parts. \u201cI figure they\u2019re worth a couple of bucks,\u201d I said.\n\u201cShow Unc,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you what they\u2019re worth.\u201d\nI\u2019ll bet, I thought. Carrying my precious hubcap of brake hardware, like a waiter with a dish, I started back toward the driveway. Behind me I heard a steady pop, pop, pop as Frankie went back to work. I must have been following a different route between the cars\u2014because when I saw it, I knew it was for the first time.\nThe 1800 is Volvo\u2019s legendary (well, sort of) sports car from the early 1960s. The first model, the P1800, was assembled in Scotland and England (unusual, to say the least, for a Swedish car). This one, the only one I had ever seen in a junkyard, still had its fins and appeared to have all its glass. It was dark blue. I edged up to it, afraid that if I startled it, it might disappear. But it was real. It was wheel-less, engineless, and rusted out in the rocker panels. But it was real. I looked inside. I tapped on the glass. I opened the door.\nThe interior was the wrong color\u2014but it was real, too. It smelled musty, but it was intact. Or close enough. I arrived at the driveway, so excited that I didn\u2019t even flinch when the old man looked into my hubcap (like a fortune teller reading entrails) and said, \u201cTen dollars.\u201d\nI raced home to tell Wu what I had found.\nEverybody should have a friend like Wilson Wu, just to keep them guessing. Wu worked his way through high school as a pastry chef, then dropped out to form a rock band, then won a scholarship to Princeton (I think) for math (I think), then dropped out to get a job as an engineer, then made it halfway through medical school at night before becoming a lawyer, which is where I met him. He passed his bar exam on the first try. Somewhere along the line he decided he was gay, then decided he wasn\u2019t (I don\u2019t know what his wife thought of all this); he has been both democrat and republican, Catholic and Protestant, pro and anti gun-control. He can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s Chinese or American, or both. The only constant thing in his life is the Volvo. Wu has never owned another kind of car. He kept a 1984 240DL station wagon for the wife and kids. He kept the P1800, which I had helped him tow from Pennsylvania, where he had bought it at a yard sale for $500 (a whole other story), in my garage. I didn\u2019t charge him rent. It was a red 1961 sports coupe with a B18. The engine and transmission were good (well, fair) but the interior had been gutted. Wu had found seats but hadn\u2019t yet put them in. He was waiting for the knobs and trim and door panels, the little stuff that is hardest to find, especially for a P1800. He had been looking for two years.\nWu lived on my block in Brooklyn, which was strictly a coincidence since I knew him from Legal Aid, where we had both worked before going into private practice. I found him in his kitchen, helping his wife make a wedding cake. She\u2019s a caterer. \u201cWhat are you doing in the morning?\u201d I asked, but I didn\u2019t wait for him to tell me. I have never been good at surprises (which is why I had no success as a criminal lawyer). \u201cYour long travail is over,\u201d I said. \u201cI found an 1800. A P1800. With an interior.\u201d\n\u201cHandles?\u201d\n\u201cHandles.\u201d\n\u201cPanels?\u201d\n\u201cPanels.\u201d\n\u201cKnobs?\u201d Wu had stopped stirring. I had his attention.\n\u201cI hear you got your brakes fixed,\u201d Wu said the next day as we were on our way to Howard Beach in my car. \u201cOr perhaps I should say, \u2018I don\u2019t hear.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI found the parts yesterday and put them on this morning,\u201d I told him. I told him the story of how I found the Hole. I told him about the junkyard of Volvos. I told him about stumbling across the dark blue P1800. By then, we were past the end of Atlantic Avenue, near Howard Beach. I turned off onto Conduit and tried to retrace my turns of the day before, but with no luck. Nothing looked familiar.\nWu started to look skeptical; or maybe I should say, he started to look even more skeptical. \u201cMaybe it was all a dream,\u201d he said, either taunting me or comforting himself, or both.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see P1800s in junkyards, even in dreams,\u201d I said. But in spite of my best efforts to find the Hole, I was going in circles. Finally, I gave up and went to Boulevard Imports. The place was almost empty. I didn\u2019t recognize the counterman. His shirt said he was a Sal.\n\u201cVinnie\u2019s off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday.\u201d\n\u201cThen maybe you can help me. I\u2019m trying to find a place called Frankie\u2019s. In the Hole.\u201d\nPeople sometimes use the expression \u201cblank look\u201d loosely. Sal\u2019s was the genuine article.\n\u201cA Volvo junkyard?\u201d I said. \u201cA pony or so?\u201d\nBlank got even blanker. Wu had come in behind me, and I didn\u2019t have to turn around to know he was looking skeptical\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about any Volvos, but did somebody mention a pony?\u201d a voice said from in the back. An old man came forward. He must have been doing the books, since he was wearing a tie. \u201cMy Pop used to keep a pony in the Hole. We sold it when horseshoes got scarce during the War.\u201d\n\u201cJeez, Vinnie, what war was this?\u201d Sal asked. (So I had found another Vinnie!)\n\u201cHow many have there been?\u201d the old Vinnie asked. He turned to me. \u201cNow, listen up, kid.\u201d (I couldn\u2019t help smiling; usually only judges call me \u201ckid\u201d and only in chambers.) \u201cI can only tell you once, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get it right.\u201d\nThe old Vinnie\u2019s instructions were completely different from the ones I had gotten from the Vinnie the day before. They involved a turn into an abandoned gas station on the Belt Parkway, a used car lot on Conduit, a McDonald\u2019s with a dumpster in the back, plus other flourishes that I have forgotten.\nSuffice it to say that, twenty minutes later, after bouncing down a steep bank, Wu and I found ourselves cruising the wide mud streets of the Hole, looking for Frankie\u2019s. I could tell by Wu\u2019s silence that he was impressed. The Hole is pretty impressive if you are not expecting it, and who\u2019s expecting it? There was the non-vertical crane, the subway car (with smoke coming from its makeshift chimney) and the horse grazing in a lot between two shanties. I wondered if it was a descendant of the old Vinnie\u2019s father\u2019s pony. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was shod or not.\nThe fat lady was still on the phone. The kids must have heard us coming, because they were standing in front of the card table waving hand-lettered signs: MOON ROCKS THIS WAY! and MOON ROCKS R US! When he saw them, Wu put his hand on my arm and said, \u201cPull over, Irv,\u201d\u2014his first words since we had descended into the Hole.\nI pulled over and he got out. He fingered a couple of ashy-looking lumps, and handed the kids a dollar. They giggled and said they had no change.\nWu told them to keep it.\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t behave like that at Frankie\u2019s,\u201d I said, when he got back into the car.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to bargain, Wu. People expect it. Even kids. What do you want with phony moon rocks anyway?\u201d\n\u201cSupporting free enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, I worked on Apollo and I handled some real moon rocks once. They looked just like these.\u201d He sniffed them. \u201cSmelled just like these.\u201d He tossed them out the window into the shallow water as we motored through a puddle.\nAs impressive as the Hole can be (first time), there is nothing more impressive than a junkyard of all Volvos. I couldn\u2019t wait to see Wu\u2019s face when he saw it. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. I heard him gasp as we slipped through the gate. He looked around, then looked at me and grinned. \u201cAstonishing,\u201d he said. Even the inscrutable, skeptical Wu.\n\u201cTold you,\u201d I said. (I could hardly wait till he saw the 1800!) The old man was at the end of the driveway, working on a diesel this time. Another customer, this one white, looked on and kibitzed. The old man seemed to sell entertainment as much as expertise. They were trying to get water out of the injectors.\n\u201cI understand you have an 1800,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to find.\u201d\nI winced. Wu was no businessman. The old man straightened up, and looked us over. There\u2019s nothing like a six-foot Chinaman to get your attention, and Wu is six-two.\n\u201cP1800,\u201d the old man said. \u201cHard to find is hardly the word for it. I\u2019d call it your rare luxury item. But I guess it won\u2019t cost you too much to have a look.\u201d He reached around the diesel\u2019s windshield and honked the horn. Two shorts and a long.\nThe oversized head with the oversized eyes appeared at the far end of the yard, by the fence.\n\u201cTwo lawyers coming back,\u201d the old man called out. Then he said to me: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to head straight back along the garage till you get to where Frankie is working. Then head to your right, and you\u2019ll find the P1800.\u201d\nFrankie was still working on the endless pile (not a stack) of tires by the fence. Each one went through the low door of the shed with a pop.\nI nodded, and Frankie nodded back. I turned right and edged between the cars toward the P1800, assuming Wu was right behind me. When I saw it, I was relieved\u2014it had not been a dream after all! I expected an appreciative whistle (at the very least), but when I turned, I saw that I had lost Wu.\nHe was still back by the garage, looking through a stack (not a pile) of wheels against the wall.\n\u201cHey, Wu!\u201d I said, standing on the bumper of the P1800. \u201cYou can get wheels anywhere. Check out the interior on this baby!\u201d Then, afraid I had sounded too enthusiastic, I added: \u201cIt\u2019s rough but it might almost do.\u201d\nWu didn\u2019t even bother to answer me. He pulled two wheels from the stack. They weren\u2019t exactly wheels, at least not the kind you mount tires on. They were more like wire mesh tires, with metal chevrons where the tread should have been.\nWu set them upright, side by side. He slapped one and gray dust flew. He slapped the other. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get these?\u201d he asked.\nFrankie stopped working and lit a cigarette. \u201cOff a dune buggy,\u201d he said.\nBy this time, I had joined them. \u201cA Volvo dune buggy?\u201d\n\u201cNot a Volvo,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cAn electric job. Can\u2019t sell you the wheels separately. They\u2019re a set.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the dune buggy?\u201d Wu asked. \u201cCan I have a look at it?\u201d\nFrankie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s on the property. Hey, are you some kind of environment man or something?\u201d\n\u201cThe very opposite,\u201d said Wu. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer. I just happen to dig dune buggies. Can I have a look at it? Good ones are hard to find.\u201d\nI winced.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask Unc,\u201d Frankie said.\n\u201cWu,\u201d I said, as soon as Frankie had left to find his uncle, \u201cthere\u2019s something you need to know about junkyard men. If something is hard to find, you don\u2019t have to tell them. And what\u2019s this dune buggy business, anyway? I thought you wanted interior trim for your P1800.\u201d\n\u201cForget the P1800, Irv,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt\u2019s yours. I\u2019m giving it to you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d\nWu slapped the wire mesh wheel again and sniffed the cloud of dust. \u201cDo you realize what this is, Irv?\u201d\n\u201cSome sort of wire wheel. So what?\u201d\n\u201cI worked at Boeing in 1970,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI helped build this baby, Irv. It\u2019s off the LRV.\u201d\n\u201cThe LR what?\u201d\nBefore Wu could answer, Frankie was back. \u201cWell, you can look at it,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cBut you got to hold your breath. It\u2019s in the cave and there\u2019s no air in there.\u201d\n\u201cThe cave?\u201d I said. They both ignored me.\n\u201cYou can see it from the door, but I\u2019m not going back in there,\u201d said Frankie. \u201cUnc won\u2019t let me. Have you got a jacket? It\u2019s cold.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Wu said.\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Frankie tossed Wu a pair of plastic welding goggles. \u201cWear these. And remember, hold your breath.\u201d\nIt was clear at this point where the cave was. Frankie was pointing toward the low door into the shed, where he rolled the tires. Wu put on the goggles and ducked his head; as he went through the doorway he made that same weird pop the tires made.\nI stood there with Frankie in the sunlight, holding the two wire mesh wheels, feeling like a fool.\nThere was another pop and Wu backed out through the shower curtain. When he turned around, he looked like he had seen a ghost. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. Plus, he was shivering like crazy.\n\u201cTold you it was cold!\u201d said Frankie. \u201cAnd it\u2019s weird. There\u2019s no air in there, for one thing. If you want the dune buggy, you\u2019ll have to get it out of there yourself.\u201d\nWu gradually stopped shivering. As he did, a huge grin spread across his face. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, all right,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me show my partner. Loan me some extra goggles.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIrv, come on! Put these goggles on.\u201d\n\u201cNo way!\u201d I said. But I put them on. You always did what Wu said, sooner or later; he was that kind of guy.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath in. Let it all out, and then hold it. Come on. Follow me.\u201d\nI breathed out and ducked down just in time; Wu grabbed my hand and pulled me through the shed door behind him. If I made a pop I didn\u2019t hear it. We were standing in the door of a cave\u2014but looking out, not in. The inside was another outside!\nIt was like the beach, all gray sand (or dust) but with no water. I could see stars but it wasn\u2019t dark. The dust was greenish gray, like a courthouse hallway (a color familiar to lawyers).\nMy ears were killing me. And it was cold!\nWe were at the top of a long, smooth slope, like a dune, which was littered with tires. At the bottom was a silver dune buggy with no front wheels, sitting nose down in the gray dust.\nWu pointed at it. He was grinning like a maniac. I had seen enough. Pulling my hand free, I stepped back through the shower curtain and gasped for air. This time I heard a pop as I went through.\nThe warm air felt great. My ears gradually quit ringing. Frankie was sitting on his tire pile, smoking a cigarette. \u201cWhere\u2019s your buddy? He can\u2019t stay in there.\u201d\nJust then, Wu backed out through the curtain with a loud pop. \u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said, as soon as he had filled his lungs with air. \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d\nI winced. Twice.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask Unc,\u201d said Frankie.\n\u201cWu,\u201d I said, as soon as Frankie had left to find his uncle, \u201clet me tell you something about junkyard men. You can\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019ll take it, I\u2019ll take it\u2019 around them. You have to say, \u2018Maybe it might do, or . . . \u2019\u201d\n\u201cIrving!\u201d Wu cut me off. His eyes were wild. (He hardly ever called me Irving.) He took both my hands in his, as if we were bride and groom, and began to walk me in a circle. His fingers were freezing. \u201cIrving, do you know, do you realize, where we just were?\u201d\n\u201cSome sort of cave? Haven\u2019t we played this game before?\u201d\n\u201cThe Moon! Irving, that was the surface of the Moon you just saw!\u201d\n\u201cI admit it was weird,\u201d I said. \u201cBut the Moon is a million miles away. And it\u2019s up in the . . . \u201d\n\u201cQuarter of a million,\u201d Wu said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d\nFrankie was back, with his uncle. \u201cThat dune buggy\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take less than five hundred for it.\u201d\nWu said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d\nI winced.\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to get it out of the cave yourself,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Frankie going in there anymore. That\u2019s why I told the kids, no more rocks.\u201d\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Wu said. \u201cAre you open tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Sunday,\u201d said the old man.\n\u201cWhat about Monday?\u201d\nI followed Wu through the packed-together Volvos to the front gate. We were on the street before I realized he hadn\u2019t even bothered to look at the 1800. \u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to those two,\u201d I said. I was a little pissed off. More than a little.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d Wu said.\n\u201cDamn right there\u2019s no doubt about it!\u201d I started my 145 and headed up the street, looking for an exit from the Hole. Any exit. \u201cFive hundred dollars for a junk dune buggy?\u201d\n\u201cNo doubt about it at all. That was either the Hadley Apennines, or Descartes, or Taurus Littrow,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI guess I could tell by looking at the serial numbers on the LRV.\u201d\n\u201cI never heard of a Hadley or a Descartes,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I know Ford never made a dune buggy.\u201d I found a dirt road that led up through a clump of trees. Through the branches I could see the full Moon, pale in the afternoon sky. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the Moon, right there in the sky, where it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s apparently more than one way to get to the Moon, Irving. Which they are using as a dump for old tires. We saw it with our own eyes!\u201d\nThe dirt road gave out in a vacant lot on Conduit. I crossed a sidewalk, bounced down a curb, and edged into the traffic. Now that I was headed back toward Brooklyn, I could pay attention. \u201cWu,\u201d I said. \u201cJust because you worked for NAPA\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNASA, Irv. And I didn\u2019t work for them, I worked for Boeing.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever. Science is not my thing. But I know for a fact that the Moon is in the sky. We were in a hole in the ground, although it was weird, I admit.\u201d\n\u201cA hole with stars?\u201d Wu said. \u201cWith no air? Get logical, Irv.\u201d He found an envelope in my glove compartment and began scrawling on it with a pencil. \u201cNo, I suspected it when I saw those tires. They are from the Lunar Roving Vehicle, better known as the LRV or the lunar rover. Only three were built and all three were left on the Moon. Apollo 15, 16, and 17.1971.1972. Surely you remember.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said. The third thing you learn in law school is never to admit you don\u2019t remember something. \u201cSo how did this loonie rover get to Brooklyn?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI suspect we\u2019re dealing with one of the rarest occurrences in the universe. A neotopological metaeuclidean adjacency.\u201d\n\u201cA non-logical metaphysical what?\u201d\nWu handed me the envelope. It was covered with numbers:\n\u201cThat explains the whole thing,\u201d Wu said. \u201cA neotopological metaeuclidean adjacency. It\u2019s quite rare. In fact, I think this may be the only one.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d\n\u201cI used to be a physicist.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was an engineer.\u201d\n\u201cBefore that. Look at the figures, Irv! Numbers don\u2019t lie. That equation shows how space-time can be folded so that two parts are adjacent that are also, at the same time, separated by millions of miles. Or a quarter of a million, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re talking about a sort of back door to the Moon?\u201d\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\nOn Sundays I had visitation rights to the big-screen TV. I watched golf and stock-car racing all afternoon with my wife, switching back and forth during commercials. We got along a lot better now that we weren\u2019t speaking. Especially when she was holding the remote. On Monday morning, Wu arrived at the door at nine o\u2019clock sharp, wearing coveralls and carrying a shopping bag and a toolbox.\n\u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t have court today?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cBecause I know you have only one case at present, your divorce, in which you are representing both parties in order to save money. Hi, Diane.\u201d\n\u201cHi, Wu.\u201d (She was speaking to him.)\nWe took my 145. Wu was silent all the way out to the Eastern Parkway, doing figures on a cocktail napkin from a Bay Ridge nightclub. \u201cGo out last night?\u201d I asked. After a whole day with Diane, I was dying to have somebody to talk to.\n\u201cSomething was bothering me all night,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the surface of the Moon is a vacuum, how come all the air on Earth doesn\u2019t rush through the shed door, along with the tires?\u201d\n\u201cI give up,\u201d I said.\nWe were at a stoplight. \u201cThere it is,\u201d he said. He handed me the napkin, on which was scrawled:\n\u201cThere what is?\u201d\n\u201cThe answer to my question. As those figures demonstrate, Irv, we\u2019re not just dealing with a neotopological metaeuclidean adjacency. We\u2019re dealing with an incongruent neotopological metaeuclidean adjacency. The two areas are still separated by a quarter of a million miles, even though that distance has been folded to the width of a centimeter. It\u2019s all there in black and white. See?\u201d\n\u201cI guess,\u201d I said. The fourth thing you learn in law school is to never admit you don\u2019t understand something.\n\u201cThe air doesn\u2019t rush through, because it can\u2019t. It can kind of seep through, though, creating a slight microclimate in the immediate vicinity of the adjacency. Which is probably why we don\u2019t die immediately of decompression. A tire can roll through, if you give it a shove, but air is too, too . . . \u201d\n\u201cToo wispy to shove,\u201d I said.\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\nI looked for the turn off Conduit, but nothing was familiar. I tried a few streets, but none of them led us into the Hole. \u201cNot again!\u201d Wu complained.\n\u201cAgain!\u201d I answered.\nI went back to Boulevard. Vinnie was behind the counter today, and he remembered me (with a little prodding).\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one having trouble finding the Hole,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard to find lately.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018lately\u2019?\u201d Wu asked from the doorway.\n\u201cJust this last year. Every month or so it gets hard to find. I think it has to do with the Concorde. I read somewhere that the noise affects the tide, and the Hole isn\u2019t that far from Jamaica Bay, you know.\u201d\n\u201cCan you draw us a map?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI never took drawing,\u201d Vinnie said, \u201cso listen up close.\u201d\nVinnie\u2019s instructions had to do with an abandoned railroad track, a wrong-way turn onto a one-way street, a dog-leg that cut across a health club parking lot, and several other ins and outs. While I was negotiating all this, Wu was scrawling on the back of a carwash flyer he had taken from Vinnie\u2019s counter.\n\u201cThe tide,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI should have known!\u201d\nI didn\u2019t ask him what he meant; I figured (I knew!) he would tell me. But before he had a chance, we were bouncing down a dirt track through some scruffy trees, and onto the now-familiar dirt streets of the Hole. \u201cWant some more moon rocks?\u201d I asked when we passed the kids and their stand.\n\u201cI\u2019ll pick up my own today, Irv!\u201d\nI pulled up by the gate and we let ourselves in. Wu carried the shopping bag; he gave me the toolbox.\nThe old man was working on an ancient 122, the Volvo that looks like a \u201848 Ford from the back. (It was always one of my favorites.) \u201cIt\u2019s electric,\u201d he said when Wu and I walked up.\n\u201cThe 122?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThe dune buggy,\u201d the old man said. \u201cElectric is the big thing now. All the cars in California are going to be electric next year. It\u2019s the law.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d I said. \u201cSo what, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThat makes that dune buggy worth a lot of money.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. Besides, you already agreed on a price.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Five hundred,\u201d Wu said. He pulled five bills from his pocket and unfolded them.\n\u201cI said I couldn\u2019t take less than five hundred,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI never said I couldn\u2019t take more.\u201d\nBefore Wu could answer, I pulled him behind the 122. \u201cRemember the second thing we learned in law school!\u201d I said. \u201cWhen to walk away. We can come back next week\u2014if you still want that thing.\u201d\nWu shook his head. \u201cIt won\u2019t be here next week. I realized something when Vinnie told us that the Hole was getting hard to find. The adjacency is warping the neighborhood as well as the cislunar space-time continuum. And since it\u2019s lunar, it has a monthly cycle. Look at this.\u201d\nHe handed me the car wash flyer, on the back of which was scrawled:\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Wu. \u201cWe\u2019re not just dealing with an incongruent neotopological metaeuclidean adjacency. We\u2019re dealing with a periodic incongruent neotopological metaeuclidean adjacency.\u201d\n\u201cWhich means . . . \u201d\n\u201cThe adjacency comes and goes. With the Moon.\u201d\n\u201cSort of like PMS.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. I haven\u2019t got the figures adjusted for daylight savings time yet, but the Moon is on the wane, and I\u2019m pretty sure that after today, Frankie will be out of the illegal dumping business for a month, at least.\u201d\n\u201cPerfect. So we come back next month.\u201d\n\u201cIrv, I don\u2019t want to take the chance. Not with a million dollars at stake.\u201d\n\u201cNot with a what?\u201d He had my attention.\n\u201cThat LRV cost two million new, and only three of them were made. Once we get it out, all we have to do is contact NASA. Or Boeing. Or the Air & Space Museum at the Smithsonian. But we\u2019ve got to strike while the iron is hot. Give me a couple of hundred bucks and I\u2019ll give you a fourth interest.\u201d\n\u201cA half.\u201d\n\u201cA third. Plus the P1800.\u201d\n\u201cYou already gave me the P1800.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I was only kidding. Now I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\u201cDeal,\u201d I said. But instead of giving Wu two hundred, I plucked the five hundred-dollar bills out of his hand. \u201cBut you stick to the numbers. I do all the talking.\u201d\nWe got it for six hundred. Non-refundable. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Wu asked.\n\u201cIt means you boys own the dune buggy\u2014whether you get it out of the cave or not,\u201d said the old man, counting his money.\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Wu. It didn\u2019t seem fair to me at all, but I kept my mouth shut. I couldn\u2019t imagine a scenario in which we would get our money back from the old man, anyway.\nHe went back to work on the engine of the 122, and Wu and I headed for the far end of the yard. We found Frankie rolling tires through the shed door: pop, pop, pop. The pile by the fence was as big as ever. He waved and kept on working.\nWu set down the shopping bag and pulled out two of those spandex bicycling outfits. He handed one to me, and started taking off his shoes.\nI\u2019ll spare you the ensuing interchange\u2014what I said, what he said, objections, arguments, etc. Suffice it to say that, ten minutes later, I was wearing black and purple tights under my coveralls, and so was Wu. Supposedly, they were to keep our skin from blistering in the vacuum. Wu was hard to resist when he had his mind made up.\nI wondered what Frankie thought of it all. He just kept rolling tires through the doorway, one by one.\nThere were more surprises in the bag. Wu pulled out rubber gloves and wool mittens, a brown bottle with Chinese writing on it, a roll of clear plastic vegetable bags from the supermarket, a box of cotton balls, a roll of duct tape, and a rope.\nFrankie didn\u2019t say anything until Wu got to the rope. Then he stopped working, sat down on the pile of tires, lit a cigarette, and said: \u201cWon\u2019t work.\u201d\nWu begged his pardon.\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d Frankie said. He tied one end of the rope to a tire and tossed it through the low door into the shed. There was the usual pop and then a fierce crackling noise.\nSmoke blew out the door. Wu and I both jumped back.\nFrankie pulled the rope back, charred on one end. There was no tire \u201cI learned the hard way,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I tried to pull the dune buggy through myself, before I took the wheels off.\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Wu said. \u201cWhat a fool I\u2019ve been. I should have known!\u201d\n\u201cShould have known what?\u201d Frankie and I both asked at once.\nWu tore a corner off the shopping bag and started scrawling numbers on it with a pencil stub. \u201cShould have known this!\u201d he said, and he handed it to Frankie.\nFrankie looked at it, shrugged, and handed it to me:\n\u201cSo?\u201d I said.\n\u201cSo, there it is!\u201d Wu said. \u201cAs those figures clearly indicate, you can pass through a noncongruent adjacency, but you can\u2019t connect its two aspects. It\u2019s only logical. Imagine the differential energy stored when a quarter of a million miles of space-time is folded to less than a millimeter.\u201d\n\u201cBurns right through a rope,\u201d Frankie said.\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\u201cHow about a chain?\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cMelts a chain,\u201d said Frankie. \u201cNever tried a cable, though.\u201d\n\u201cNo substance known to man could withstand that awesome energy differential,\u201d Wu said. \u201cNot even cable. That\u2019s why the tires make that pop. I\u2019ll bet you have to roll them hard or they bounce back, right?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d said Frankie, putting out his cigarette. He was losing interest.\n\u201cGuess that means we leave it there,\u201d I said. I had mixed feelings. I hated to lose a third of a million dollars, but I didn\u2019t like the looks of that charred rope. Or the smell. I was even willing to kiss my hundred bucks goodbye.\n\u201cLeave it there? No way. We\u2019ll drive it out,\u201d Wu said. \u201cFrankie, do you have some twelve-volt batteries you can loan me? Three, to be exact.\u201d\n\u201cUnc\u2019s got some,\u201d said Frankie. \u201cI suspect he\u2019ll want to sell them, though. Unc\u2019s not much of a loaner.\u201d\nWhy was I not surprised?\nHalf an hour later we had three twelve-volt batteries in a supermarket shopping cart. The old man had wanted another hundred dollars, but since I was now a partner I did the bargaining, and we got them for twenty bucks apiece, charged and ready to go, with the cart thrown in. Plus three sets of jumper cables, on loan.\nWu rolled the two wire mesh wheels through the shed door. Each went pop and was gone. He put the toolbox into the supermarket cart with the batteries and the jumper cables. He pulled on the rubber gloves, and pulled the wool mittens over them. I did the same.\n\u201cReady, Irv?\u201d Wu said. (I would have said no, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good. So I didn\u2019t say anything.) \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to talk on the Moon, so here\u2019s the plan. First, we push the cart through. Don\u2019t let it get stuck in the doorway where it connects the two aspects of the adjacency, or it\u2019ll start to heat up. Might even explode. Blow up both worlds. Who knows? Once we\u2019re through, you head down the hill with the cart. I\u2019ll bring the two wheels. When we get to the LRV, you pick up the front end and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t we have a jack?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting very low gravity. Besides, the LRV is lighter than a golf cart. Only 460 pounds, and that\u2019s here on Earth. You hold it up while I mount the wheels\u2014I have the tools laid out in the tray of the toolbox. Then you hand me the batteries, they go in front, and I\u2019ll connect them with the jumper cables, in series. Then we climb in and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting something, Wu?\u201d I said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to hold our breath long enough to do all that.\u201d\n\u201cAh so!\u201d Wu grinned and held up the brown bottle with Chinese writing on it. \u201cNo problem! I have here the ancient Chinese herbal treatment known as (he said some Chinese words), or \u2018Pond Explorer\u2019. Han dynasty sages used it to lie underwater and meditate for hours. I ordered this from Hong Kong, where it is called (more Chinese words), or \u2018Mud Turtle Master\u2019 and used by thieves; but no matter, it\u2019s the same stuff. Hand me those cotton balls.\u201d\nThe bottle was closed with a cork. Wu uncorked it and poured thick brown fluid on a cotton ball; it hissed and steamed.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d I said.\n\u201cPond Explorer not only provides the blood with oxygen, it suppresses the breathing reflex. As a matter of fact, you can\u2019t breathe while it\u2019s under your tongue. Which means you can\u2019t talk. It also contracts the capillaries and slows the heartbeat. It also scours the nitrogen out of the blood so you don\u2019t get the bends.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d\n\u201cI was into organic chemistry for several years,\u201d Wu said. \u201cDid my master\u2019s thesis on ancient Oriental herbals. Never finished it, though.\u201d\n\u201cBefore you studied math?\u201d\n\u201cAfter math, before law. Open up.\u201d\nAs he prepared to put the cotton ball under my tongue, he said, \u201cPond Explorer switches your cortex to an ancient respiratory pattern predating the oxygenation of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Pretty old stuff, Irv! It will feel perfectly natural, though. Breathe out and empty your lungs. There! When we come out, spit it out immediately so you can breathe and talk. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\nThe Pond Explorer tasted bitter. I felt oxygen (or something) flooding my tongue and my cheeks. My mouth tingled. Once I got used to it, it wasn\u2019t so bad; as a matter of fact, it felt great. Except for the taste, which didn\u2019t go away.\nWu put his cotton ball under his tongue, smiled, and corked the bottle. Then, while I watched in alarm, he tore two plastic bags off the roll.\nI saw what was coming. I backed away, shaking my head\u2014\nI\u2019ll spare you the ensuing interchange. Suffice it to say that, minutes later, we both had plastic bags over our heads, taped around our necks with duct tape. Once I got over my initial panic, it wasn\u2019t so bad. As always, Wu seemed to know what he was doing. And as always, it was no use resisting his plans.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what Frankie was making of all this, so was I. He had stopped working again. While my bag was being taped on, I saw him sitting on the pile of tires, watching us with those blue-green eyes; looking a little bored, as if he saw such goings-on every day.\nIt was time. Wu grabbed the front of the supermarket cart and I grabbed the handle. Wu spun his finger and pointed toward the shed door with its tattered shower curtain waving slightly in the ripples of the space-time interface. We were off!\nI waved goodbye to Frankie. He lifted one finger in farewell as we ran through.\nFrom the Earth to the Moon\u2014in one long step for mankind (and in particular, Wilson Wu). I heard a crackling, even through the plastic bag, and the supermarket cart shuddered and shook like a lawnmower with a bent blade. Then we were on the other side, and there was only a huge cold empty silence.\nOverhead, a million stars. At our feet, gray dust. The door we had come through was a dimly lighted hole under a low cliff behind us. We were looking down a gray slope strewn with tires. The flat area at the bottom of the slope was littered with empty bottles, wrappers, air tanks, a big tripod, and of course, the dune buggy\u2014or LRV\u2014nose down in the dust. There were tracks all around it. Beyond were low hills, gray except for an occasional black stone. Everything seemed close; there was no far away. Except for the tires, the junk, and the tracks around the dune buggy, the landscape was featureless, smooth. Unmarked. Untouched. Lifeless.\nThe whole scene was half-lit, like dirty snow under a full moon in winter, only brighter. And more green.\nWu was grinning like a mad man. His plastic bag had expanded so that it looked like a space helmet; I realized mine probably looked the same. This made me feel better.\nWu pointed up behind us. I turned, and there was the Earth\u2014hanging in the sky like a blue-green, oversized moon, just like the cover of The Whole Earth Catalog. I hadn\u2019t actually doubted Wu, but I hadn\u2019t actually believed him either, until then. The fifth thing you learn in law school is to be comfortable in that \u201ctwilight zone\u201d between belief and doubt.\nNow I believed it. We were on the Moon, looking back at the Earth. And it was cold! The gloves did no good at all, even with the wool over the rubber. But there was no time to worry about it. Wu had already picked up the wire mesh wheels and started down the slope, sort of hopping with one under each arm, trying to miss the scattered tires I followed, dragging the grocery cart behind me. I had expected it to bog down in the dust, but it didn\u2019t. The only problem was, the low gravity made it hard for me to keep my footing. I had to wedge my toes under the junk tires and pull it a few feet at a time.\nThe dune buggy, or LRV, as Wu liked to call it, was about the size of a jeep without a hood (or even an engine). It had two seats side by side, like lawn chairs with plastic webbing, facing a square console the size of a portable TV. Between the seats was a gearshift. There was no steering wheel. An umbrella-shaped antenna attached to the front end made the whole thing look like a contraption out of E.T. or Mary Poppins.\nI picked up the front end, and Wu started putting on the left wheel, fitting it under the round fiberglass fender. Even though the LRV was light, the sudden exertion reminded me that I wasn\u2019t breathing, and I felt an instant of panic. I closed my eyes and sucked my tongue until it went away. The bitter taste of the Pond Explorer was reassuring.\nWhen I opened my eyes, it looked like a fog was rolling in: it was my plastic bag, fogging up. I could barely see Wu, already finishing the left wheel. I wondered if he had ever worked on an Indy pit crew. (I found out later that he had.)\nWu crossed to the right wheel. The fog was getting thicker. I tried wiping it off with one hand, but of course, it was on the inside. Wu gave the thumbs up, and I set the front end down. I pointed at my plastic bag, and he nodded. His was fogged up, too. He tossed his wrench into the toolbox, and the plastic tray shattered like glass (silently, of course). Must have been the cold. My fingers and toes were killing me.\nWu started hopping up the slope, and I followed. I couldn\u2019t see the Earth overhead, or the Moon below; everything was a blur. I wondered how we would find our way out (or in?), back through the shed door. I needn\u2019t have worried. Wu took my hand and led me through, and this time I heard the pop. Blinking in the light, we tore the bags off our heads.\nWu spit out his cotton, and I did the same. My first breath felt strange. And wonderful. I had never realized breathing was so much fun.\nThere was a high-pitched cheer. Several of the neighborhood kids had joined Frankie on the pile of tires\n\u201cDescartes,\u201d Wu said.\n\u201cWe left it down there,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo, I mean our location. It\u2019s in the lunar highlands, near the equator. Apollo 16. Young, Duke, and Mattingly. 1972. I recognize the battery cover on the LRV. The return was a little hairy, though. Ours, I mean, not theirs. I had to follow the tires the last few yards. We\u2019ll spray some WD-40 on the inside of the plastic bags before we go back in.\u201d\n\u201cStuff\u2019s good for everything,\u201d Frankie said.\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d I said.\nIt was noon, and I was starving, but there was no question of breaking for lunch. Wu was afraid the batteries would freeze; though they were heavy duty, they were made for Earth, not the Moon. With new Pond Explorer and new plastic bags properly treated with WD-40, we went back in. I had also taped plastic bags over my shoes. My toes were still stinging from the cold.\nAs we went down the slope toward the LRV site, we tossed a few of the tires aside to clear a road. With any luck, we would be coming up soon.\nWe left the original NASA batteries in place and set the new (well, used, but charged) batteries on top of them, between the front fenders. While Wu hooked them up with the jumper cables, I looked around for what I hoped was the last time. There was no view, just low hills all around, the one in front of us strewn with tires like burned donuts. The shed door (or adjacency, as Wu liked to call it) was a dimly lighted cave under a low cliff at the top of the slope. It wasn\u2019t a long hill, but it was steep\u2014about twelve degrees.\nI wondered if the umbrella-antenna would make it through the door. As if he had read my mind, Wu was already unbolting it when I turned back around. He tossed it aside with the rest of the junk, sat down, and patted the seat beside him.\nI climbed in or rather \u201con,\u201d since there was no \u201cin\u201d to the LRV. Wu sat, of course, on the left. It occurred to me that if the English had been first on the Moon, he would have been on the right. There was no steering wheel or foot pedals either\u2014but that didn\u2019t bother Wu. He seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He hit a few switches on the console, and dials lighted up for \u201croll,\u201d \u201cheading,\u201d \u201cpower,\u201d etc. With a mad grin towards me, and a thumbs up towards the top of the slope (or the Earth hanging above it), he pushed the T-handle between us forward.\nThe LRV lurched. It groaned\u2014I could \u201chear\u201d it through my seat and my tailbone\u2014and began to roll slowly forward. I could tell the batteries were weak.\nIf the LRV had lights, we didn\u2019t need them. The Earth, hanging over the adjacency like a gigantic pole star, gave plenty of light. The handle I had thought was a gearshift was actually a joystick, like on a video game. Pushing it to one side, Wu turned the LRV sharply to the right\u2014all four wheels turned\u2014and started up the slope.\nIt was slow going. You might think the Earth would have looked friendly, but it didn\u2019t. It looked cold and cruel; it seemed to be mocking us. The batteries, which had started out weak, were getting weaker. Wu\u2019s smile was gone already. The path we had cleared through the tires was useless; the LRV would never make it straight up the slope.\nI climbed down and began clearing an angled switchback. If pulling things on the Moon is hard, throwing them is almost fun. I hopped from tire to tire, slinging them down the hill, while Wu drove behind me.\nThe problem was, even on a switchback the corners are steep. The LRV was still twenty yards from the top when the batteries gave out entirely. I didn\u2019t hear it, of course; but when I looked back after clearing the last stretch, I saw it was stopped. Wu was banging on the joystick with both hands. His plastic bag was swollen, and I was afraid it would burst. I had never seen Wu lose it before. It alarmed me. I ran (or rather, hopped) back to help out.\nI started unhooking the jumper cables. Wu stopped banging on the joystick and helped. The supermarket cart had been left at the bottom, but the batteries were light enough in the lunar gravity. I picked up one under each arm and started up the hill. I didn\u2019t bother to look back, because I knew Wu would be following with the other one.\nWe burst through the adjacency\u2014the shed door\u2014together; we tore the plastic bags off our heads and spit out the cotton balls. Warm air flooded my lungs. It felt wonderful. But my toes and fingers were on fire.\n\u201cDamn and Hell!\u201d Wu said. I had never heard him curse before. \u201cWe almost made it!\u201d\n\u201cWe can still make it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe only lack a few feet. Let\u2019s put these babies on the charger and get some pizza.\u201d\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Wu said. He was calming down. \u201cI have a tendency to lose it when I\u2019m hungry. But look, Irv. Our problems are worse than we thought.\u201d\nI groaned. Two of the batteries had split along the sides when we had set them down. All three were empty; the acid had boiled away in the vacuum of the Moon. It was a wonder they had worked at all.\n\u201cMeanwhile, are your toes hurting?\u201d Wu asked.\n\u201cMy toes are killing me,\u201d I said.\nThe sixth thing you learn in law school is that cash solves all (or almost all) problems. I had one last hundred-dollar bill hidden in my wallet for emergencies\u2014and if this didn\u2019t qualify, what did? We gave the old man ninety for three more batteries, and put them on fast charge. Then we sent our change (ten bucks) with one of the kids on a bike, for four slices of pizza and two cans of diet soda.\nThen we sat down under an ailanthus and took off our shoes. I was pleased to see that my toes weren\u2019t black. They warmed fairly quickly in the sun. It was my shoes that were cold. The tassel on one of my loafers was broken; the other one snapped when I touched it.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to bypass some of the electrics on the LRV if we\u2019re going to make it up the hill,\u201d said Wu. He grabbed a piece of newspaper that was blowing by and began to trace a diagram. \u201cAccording to my calculations, those batteries will put out 33.9 percent power for sixteen minutes if we drop out the nav. system. Or maybe shunt past the rear steering motors. Look at this\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d I said. \u201cHere\u2019s our pizza.\u201d\nMy socks were warm. I taped two plastic bags over my feet this time, while Wu poured the Pond Explorer over the cotton balls. It steamed when it went on, and a cheer went up from the kids on the pile of tires. There were ten or twelve of them now. Frankie was charging them a quarter apiece. Wu paused before putting the cotton ball under his tongue.\n\u201cKids,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t try this at home!\u201d\nThey all hooted. Wu taped the plastic bag over my head, then over his. We waved\u2014we were neighborhood heroes!\u2014and picked up the \u201cnew\u201d batteries, which were now charged; and ducked side by side back through the adjacency to the junk-strewn lunar slope where our work still waited to be finished. We were the first interplanetary automotive salvage team!\nWu was carrying two batteries this time, and I was carrying one. We didn\u2019t stop to admire the scenery. I was already sick of the Moon. Wu hooked up the batteries while I got into the passenger seat. He got in beside me and hit a few switches, fewer this time. The \u201cheading\u201d lights on the console didn\u2019t come on. Half the steering and drive enable switches remained unlighted.\nThen Wu put my left hand on the joystick, and jumped down and grabbed the back of the LRV, indicating that he was going to push. I was going to drive.\nI pushed the joystick forward and the LRV groaned into action, a little livelier than last time. The steering was slow; only the front wheels turned. I was hopeful, though. The LRV groaned through the last curve without slowing down.\nI headed up the last straightaway, feeling the batteries weaken with every yard, every foot, every inch. It was as if the weight that had been subtracted from everything else on the Moon had been added to the LRV and was dragging it down. The lights on the console were flickering.\nWe were only ten yards from the adjacency. It was a dim slot under the cliff; I knew it was bright on the other side (a midsummer afternoon!), but apparently the same interface that kept the air from leaking through also dimmed the light.\nIt looked barely wide enough. But low. I was glad the LRV didn\u2019t have a windshield. I would have to duck to make it through.\nFifteen feet from the opening. Ten. Eight. The LRV stopped. I jammed the joystick forward and it moved another foot. I reached back over the seat and jiggled the jumper cables. The LRV groaned forward another six inches\u2014then died. I looked at the slot under the cliff just ahead, and at the Earth overhead, both equally far away.\nI wiggled the joystick. Nothing. I started to get down to help push, but Wu stopped me. He had one more trick. He unhooked the batteries and reversed their order. It shouldn\u2019t have made any difference but as I have often noticed, electrical matters are not logical, like law: things that shouldn\u2019t work, often do.\nSometimes, anyway. I jammed the joystick all the way forward again.\nThe LRV groaned forward again, and groaned on. I pointed it into the slot and ducked. I saw a shimmering light, and I felt the machine shudder. The front of the LRV poked through the shower curtain into the sunlight, and I followed, the sudden heat making my plastic bag swell.\nThe batteries groaned their last. I jumped down and began to pull on the front bumper. Through the plastic bag I could hear the kids screaming; or were they cheering? There was a loud crackling sound from behind the shower curtain. The LRV was only halfway through, and the front end was jumping up and down.\nI tore the bag off my head and spit out the cotton, then took a deep breath and yelled, \u201cWu!\u201d\nI heard a hiss and a crackling; I could feel the ground shake under my feet. The pile of tires was slowly collapsing behind me; kids were slipping and sliding, trying to get away. I could hear glass breaking somewhere. I yelled, \u201cWu!\u201d\nThe front of the LRV suddenly pulled free, throwing me (not to put too fine a point on it) flat on my ass.\nThe ground stopped shaking. The kids cheered.\nOnly the front of the LRV had come through. It was burned in half right behind the seat; cut through as if by a sloppy welder. The sour smell of electrical smoke was in the air. I took a deep breath and ducked toward the curtain, after Wu. But there was no curtain there, and no shed\u2014only a pile of loose boards.\n\u201cWu!\u201d I yelled. But there he was, lying on the ground among the boards. He sat up and tore the bag off his head. He spit out his cotton and took a deep breath\u2014and looked around and groaned.\nThe kids were all standing and cheering. (Kids love destruction.) Even Frankie looked pleased. But the old man wasn\u2019t; he came around the corner of the garage, looking fierce. \u201cWhat the Hell\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat happened to my shed?\u201d\n\u201cGood question,\u201d said Wu. He stood up and started tossing aside the boards that had been the shed. The shower curtain was under them, melted into a stiff plastic rag. Under it was a pile of ash and cinders\u2014and that was all. No cave, no hole; no rear end of the LRV. No moon.\n\u201cThe cave gets bigger and smaller every month,\u201d said Frankie. \u201cBut it never did that, not since it first showed up.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was that?\u201d asked Wu.\n\u201cAbout six months ago.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about my jumper cables?\u201d said the old man.\nWe paid him for the jumper cables with the change from the pizza, and then called a wrecker to tow our half-LRV back to Park Slope. While we were waiting for the wrecker, I pulled Wu aside. \u201cI hope we didn\u2019t put them out of business,\u201d I said. I\u2019m no bleeding heart liberal, but I was concerned.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe adjacency was about to drop into a lower neotopological orbit. We just helped it along a little. It\u2019s hard to figure without an almanac, but according to the tide table for June (which I\u2019m glad now I bothered to memorize) the adjacency won\u2019t be here next month. Or the month after. It was just here for six months, like Frankie said. It was a temporary thing, cyclical as well as periodic.\u201d\n\u201cSort of like the Ice Ages.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. It always occurs somewhere in this hemisphere, but usually not in such a convenient location. It could be at the bottom of Lake Huron. Or in mid-air over the Great Plains, as one of those unexplained air bumps.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the other side of it?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs it always a landing site? Or was that just a coincidence?\u201d\n\u201cGood question!\u201d Wu picked up one of the paper plates left over from the pizza and started scrawling on it with a pencil stub. \u201cIf I take the mean lunar latitude of all six Apollo sites, and divide by the coefficient of . . . \u201d\n\u201cIt was just curiosity,\u201d I said. \u201cHere\u2019s the wrecker.\u201d\nWe got the half-LRV towed for half-price (I did the negotiating), but we never did make our million dollars. Boeing was in Chapter Eleven; NASA was under a procurement freeze; the Air & Space Museum wasn\u2019t interested in anything that rolled.\n\u201cMaybe I should take it on the road,\u201d Wu told me after several weeks of trying. \u201cI could be a shopping-center attraction: \u2018Half a Chinaman exhibits half a Lunar Roving Vehicle. Kids and adults half price.\u2019\u201d\nWu\u2019s humor masked bitter disappointment. But he kept trying. The JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) wouldn\u2019t accept his calls. General Motors wouldn\u2019t return them. Finally, the Huntsville Parks Department, which was considering putting together an Apollo Memorial, agreed to send their Assistant Administrator for Adult Recreation to have a look.\nShe arrived on the day my divorce became final. Wu and I met her in the garage, where I had been living while Diane and I were waiting to sell the house. Her eyes were big and blue-green, like Frankie\u2019s. She measured the LRV and shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dollar bill,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Wu asked. He looked depressed. Or maybe skeptical. It was getting hard to tell the difference.\n\u201cIf you have over half, it\u2019s worth a whole dollar. If you have less than half, it\u2019s worth nothing. You have slightly less than half of the LRV here, which means that it is worthless. What\u2019ll you take for that old P1800, though? Isn\u2019t that the one that was assembled in England?\u201d\nWhich is how I met Candy. But that\u2019s another story.\nWe closed on the house two days later. Since the garage went with it, I helped Wu move the half-LRV to his back yard, where it sits to this day. It was lighter than any motorcycle. We moved the P1800 (which had plates) onto the street, and on Saturday morning, I went to get the interior for it. Just as Wu had predicted, the Hole was easy to find now that it was no longer linked with the adjacency. I didn\u2019t even have to stop at Boulevard Imports. I just turned off Conduit onto a likely looking street, and there it was.\nThe old man would hardly speak to me, but Frankie was understanding. \u201cYour partner came out and gave me this,\u201d he said. He showed me a yellow legal pad, on which was scrawled:\n\u201cHe told me this explains it all, I guess.\u201d\nFrankie had stacked the boards of the shed against the garage. There was a cindery bare spot where the shed door had been; the cinders had that sour moon smell. \u201cI was sick and tired of the tire disposal business, anyway,\u201d Frankie confided in a whisper.\nThe old man came around the corner of the garage. \u201cWhat happened to your buddy?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to school on Saturday mornings,\u201d I said. Wu was studying to be a meteorologist. I was never sure if that was weather or shooting stars. Anyway, he had quit the law.\n\u201cGood riddance,\u201d said the old man.\nThe old man charged me sixty-five dollars for the interior panels, knobs, handles, and trim. I had no choice but to pay up. I had the money, since I had sold Diane my half of the furniture. I was ready to start my new life. I didn\u2019t want to own anything that wouldn\u2019t fit into the tiny, heart-shaped trunk of the P1800.\nThat night, Wu helped me put in the seats, then the panels, knobs, and handles. We finished at midnight and it didn\u2019t look bad, even though I knew the colors would look weird in the daylight\u2014blue and white in a red car. Wu was grinning that mad grin again; it was the first time I had seen it since the Moon. He pointed over the rooftops to the east (towards Howard Beach, as a matter of fact). The Moon was rising. I was glad to see it looking so\u2014far away.\nWu\u2019s wife brought us some leftover wedding cake. I gave him the keys to the 145 and he gave me the keys to the P1800. \u201cGuess we\u2019re about even,\u201d I said. I put out my hand, but Wu slapped it aside and gave me a hug instead, lifting me off the ground. Everybody should have a friend like Wilson Wu.\nI followed the full Moon all the way to Alabama.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, February 1994.\nTerry Bisson is the author of a number of critically-acclaimed novels such as Fire on the Mountain, Wyrldmaker, Talking Man, Voyage to the Red Planet, Pirates of the Universe, The Pickup Artist, and, in a posthumous collaboration with Walter M.

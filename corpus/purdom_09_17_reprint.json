The thing didn\u2019t need legs. He lived in an apartment with good elevator service. Wheels would do fine.\n \u201cThere are still venues in which visitors have to access stairs,\u201d the selection adviser had said.\n The selection adviser had been a Thing, too. It looked like a competent, slightly overweight woman in her fifties but it was a thing just like the thing they were giving him. They probably had fifty selection adviser modes stashed in a store room. Give Mr. Largen Number Twenty-eight. His psychometrics indicate his comfort state maximizes with mature knowledgeable females.\n \u201cI\u2019ve cataloged my routine,\u201d Morry said. \u201cWheels will be fine.\u201d\n The face had been the biggest battleground. Morry would have opted for a square metal box with sensors and a loudspeaker if they\u2019d let him. Like the robots in most of the comic books he\u2019d read as a kid. But without the sappy friendly look.\n \u201cFacial expressions are an important aspect of emotional communication,\u201d the selection adviser advised. \u201cThey can communicate, for example, the difference between a minor disruption and a true emergency.\u201d\n So he accepted the need for a fully flexible \u201cskin.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t budge on that. But he rejected every offering that simulated a human face, male or female. Cutesy cartoon faces got eleven vetoes before the adviser decided he really was going to reject the entire category. Uniforms, robes, and various forms of historic and unhistoric costumes received the same treatment.\n A ninja model tempted him for a few seconds. Black all over. Half the face covered. A reminder the thing could be lethal.\n \u201cYou are rejecting any feature that might encourage emotional bonding,\u201d the selection advisor said. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a thing. A machine. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n \u201cMost recipients find that a degree of emotional bonding increases their overall satisfaction with the relationship.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a machine. You\u2019re a machine. I\u2019m not looking for a friend. I already have friends.\u201d\n So there it was. A shiny column planted on a flat platform with four oversized wheels. Three tentacles with metal hands. A square half-size \u201chead.\u201d Two lenses that looked like camera lenses. A square speaker with a grill.\n \u201cYour name is Clank,\u201d Morry said. \u201cYou will call me Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n The \u201cskin\u201d over the forehead could contract into a frown. The \u201ccheeks\u201d could swell or redden. But it couldn\u2019t smile. There was no danger it would smile.\n The woman who lived two doors down the hall, Georgia Coleman, called her thing Elly. She had opted for a facade that made it look like a tall bodyguard\u2014like the kind of trim, alert women who hovered around presidents and junketing cabinet secretaries. Georgia went out a lot. And Elly always went with her.\n Elly paid the cab driver. Elly helped her up stairs. Elly stayed near her in the lady\u2019s room. Elly\u2019s hands could deliver shocks. Elly could kick and punch. And squirt the spray she carried in her shoulder holster.\n \u201cLike a guard dog you don\u2019t have to feed,\u201d Morry had told Georgia.\n Georgia smiled. \u201cElly\u2019s a little smarter than a dog, Morry.\u201d\n \u201cAnd she talks to you.\u201d\n \u201cRight now she\u2019s teaching me how to play chess. Have you ever played chess, Morry? We started out playing backgammon but I got tired of that after a month. Chess is something else. I could spend the rest of my life studying the Sicilian Defense.\u201d\n Cleaning had been the killer app. Morry could get around well enough. But stuff sat on chairs and tops uncollected. Dust accumulated. The bathroom porcelain lost its shine.\n \u201cTwo hours a day,\u201d his (human) Personal Adviser said. \u201cIt will probably only be one hour most days once he gets things organized. You\u2019ll hardly notice he\u2019s active.\u201d\n \u201cAnd it cooks, too.\u201d\n \u201cBasic stuff. He can read the directions on packages and you can tell him if he has to make any adjustments.\u201d\n It could keep track of his medicines, too. Morry took two anti-cancer pills, one twice a day for three days per week, the second every four days half an hour before he ate breakfast. He had been keeping the schedule on his handscreen. Now he gave it to Clank. The thing didn\u2019t just prompt him. It watched him and made sure he\u2019d really downed the pills. And assured him he had if he started wondering two hours later.\n There were specialized devices that could do everything the things could do. Robot vacuum cleaners. Automated kitchens. Little beetles that scurried around your shelves sucking up dust. The \u201cfamiliarization video\u201d pointed that out. The smart techies had all assumed anthropomorphic robots would always be a fantasy.\n But all those devices cost you something. The automated kitchens were a great deal if you were building a new house, but your anthro could work with the kitchen you already had. It could push your old vacuum cleaner. It could even use a broom and a mop.\n The video showed military anthros picking up wounded soldiers and carrying them back to safety. Legs could go where wheels stalled. Arms could carry any kind of bundle.\n Morry could still button his shirt sleeves but it took time. Five or six tries, sometimes.\n \u201cCan you button sleeves, Clank?\u201d\n \u201cPlease show me. Thank you. I will download an app.\u201d\n Clank\u2019s hands reached for Morry\u2019s upraised wrist. Morry had assumed he would have to wait while Clank searched for the app and executed the download. Instead, the metal fingers closed around the button without a break. Morry held up his other wrist and Clank completed the job with the same smooth efficiency.\n He stifled the impulse to say thank you. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone about two hours, Clank. Get the place clean and tidy.\u201d\n \u201cI will, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cAnd tell your marketing department that\u2019s a great app. I can still do it myself but my fingers aren\u2019t as sensitive as they used to be.\u201d\n \u201cI will, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cWould you be interested in an onsite opponent, Mr. Largen?\u201d\n Morry had just pressed the On button on his game console. The intro had replaced the Swanalari Rec logo but the Start screen still hadn\u2019t come on.\n \u201cAre you trying to be a companion, Clank?\u201d\n \u201cI am offering an option you may not be aware of.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a companion. I thought I made that clear.\u201d\n \u201cI understand, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cDo they understand?\u201d\n \u201cYour instructions have been permanently installed in my operating parameters. I apologize if I have exceeded the limits you intended.\u201d\n Morry eyed the screen. It was almost four years old\u2014half the square feet he could have bought for the same money today. He hadn\u2019t bought a new game in over a year.\n \u201cCan you do anything the game can\u2019t do?\u201d\n \u201cIn what way?\u201d\n \u201cAs an opponent. This is an aerial combat game. Can you do anything in one-on-one mode that the game opponent wouldn\u2019t do?\u201d\n \u201cSome gamers feel their anthros are more flexible and less predictable than pre-installed programs.\u201d\n Morry picked up the extra controller and plugged it into the console. He had ordered the second controller when he bought the game system so he could play with his granddaughter when his family came to visit. Debbie had been a big gamer most of her childhood. Nowadays she mostly played with all the boyfriends a rabid female gamer tended to attract.\n \u201cI play this one at the expert level,\u201d Morry said. \u201cI usually fly the Dragonfire with the optional pulse laser.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Laura said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s my personal all-purpose housekeeper and devoted mechanical factotum.\u201d\n \u201cWhy does it look like that?\u201d\n Morry had discovered there were young women\u2014really young women\u2014who didn\u2019t automatically shy away from a minor fling with an obvious, unapologetic member of their grandfather\u2019s generation. To them, he was an exotic. They weren\u2019t that common, not for him anyway, but he had learned to spot the signs. He had realized Laura might be amenable fifteen minutes after he started talking to her at the wedding festivities that united one of her senior aunts with one of his more romantic contemporaries. Normally he really did prefer mature, knowledgeable women. But Laura had a great laugh. And he loved the way she moved.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a machine. I didn\u2019t see any point in pretending it\u2019s something else.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not very attractive.\u201d\n He smiled. \u201cI may have overdone it.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just like all the others. That\u2019s all they are under the cosmetics.\u201d\n \u201cThe one we\u2019ve got in our dorm\u2014in our dorm suite\u2014looks like it might be somebody\u2019s aunt. That\u2019s how I think of her anyway. Aunt Claire.\u201d\n \u201cI think machines should look like machines.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t think it should look like a faithful sidekick?\u201d\n That was the pitch in the ad everybody joked about. Every man\u2019s fantasy. A fast car and a faithful sidekick.\n Every man\u2019s second fantasy anyway. There was a guy on the eighth floor who was supposed to have opted for a harem girl\u2014a slave girl, judging by the descriptions.\n \u201cI\u2019m not a costume hero,\u201d Morry said.\n \u201cHow about a companion? They\u2019re supposed to be good for older people who live alone.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve still got friends. I still go out. I don\u2019t need a delusion created by a bunch of programmers and engineers.\u201d\n Laura laughed\u2014the happy soprano laugh that made him feel like she had just thrown out a flash of song.\n \u201cYou seem to have very strong feelings on the matter, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cI think machines are machines. We shouldn\u2019t forget they\u2019re just machines. Something people make.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t feel you need an intimate confidante?\u201d\n \u201cAre you volunteering for the job?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a bad listener. And you\u2019d have to consider me a temp.\u201d\n \u201cAt my age you have to consider everything a temp.\u201d\n \u201cBut you look like you enjoy yourself.\u201d\n \u201cI do. But right now I have to have my faithful sidekick hand me a useful little pill.\u201d\n The first symptom hit him just after Laura left. He had gone back to bed, still wearing his bathrobe, hoping he would drift into a nap with memories floating in his head. The numbness in his right arm felt like an unusual, not unpleasant, prelude to sleep. Then it spread to his leg. And he realized he couldn\u2019t move his hand.\n The thing rolled into the bedroom. \u201cPlease lie still, Mr. Largen. I\u2019ve called Emergency. Your vital signs indicate you may be experiencing the first phase of a stroke.\u201d\n Tentacles were already bending and stretching over the bed. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a standard injection. Patients who receive immediate care can generally expect a satisfactory recovery. You will be treated well inside the four hour period recommended by the guidelines. Damage sustained within that period can usually be repaired.\u201d\n It was a comforting statement. And reasonably accurate. Most of the damage to his brain could be repaired. But it took time. Pills and injections could do most of the work nowadays but the rest of the process required all the dreary exercises and adjustments stroke patients had been subjected to when he had been a forty-year-old husband who thought erection pills were a great subject for jokes.\n Nobody stayed in the hospital anymore. You had your own full time nurse at home. Clank moved his limbs during the first stage of the rehab schedule. Clank changed his diapers during the first week. Clank carried him to the bathroom and set him on the toilet from the start of the second week. Clank supervised his exercises. Clank brought him his meals. Clank helped him eat.\n A real live meditech stopped by once a week and made sure everything was running properly. A \u201ctherapy counselor\u201d supervised his first three hours at home and gave him a weekly \u201conline chat\u201d after that.\n Naturally, the counselor thought he might like an \u201cAide-Companion\u201d that looked more \u201ccomforting.\u201d\n \u201cWe can give you a model that keeps the tentacles,\u201d the counselor said. \u201cSome people prefer them to jointed limbs. I know your tech does.\u201d\n Morry shook his head. His tongue still felt thick and clumsy. He worked on his speech exercises four hours every day but he avoided talking to people when he could.\n \u201cIt\u2019s your choice, Mr. Largen. A sympathetic persona can speed up recovery. Every study of the issue ever conducted supports that conclusion.\u201d\n \u201cYou can . . . . use me . . . . for . . . . control.\u201d\n The counselor split the screen and flashed him a video of a thing that looked like a well-fed monk with big loose sleeves over its arms. The monk disappeared as soon as he raised his eyebrows\u2014he could still control his eyebrows\u2014and a parade of tentacled charmers danced across the left half of the screen. A cheery visitor from Planet X. A monk with a squarer, more distinguished face. A slim female draped in a gown, tentacles cased in long, stylish gloves.\n \u201cI . . . . have . . . . friends. They . . . . come. Ev . . . . ry day.\u201d\n \u201cI understand, Mr. Largen. But I believe you\u2019re alone most of the day.\u201d\n \u201cClank . . . . talks. I practice . . . . con . . . . ver . . . . \u201d\n He struggled with the word and gave up.\n \u201cI\u2019m only offering you some alternatives to consider,\u201d the counselor said. \u201cEmotional affect can be a subtle factor, but it\u2019s real.\u201d\n \u201cI . . . . like . . . . Clank. Clank . . . . is . . . . my friend.\u201d\n It had been a spur of the moment inspiration, but it worked. The counselor switched to her exit script and popped off the screen two minutes after he said it.\n His daughter shook her head when he told her about it. They normally kept in touch through the usual postings but she had started calling him twice a week, on a schedule. She was a rehab specialist herself and she felt he should \u201cget some benefit out of the money you invested in my education.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure that was a nice thing to do,\u201d Julie said.\n \u201cIt . . . . did . . . . the job.\u201d\n \u201cYour counselor is just trying to help you. And that thing is pretty ugly. I wouldn\u2019t want it hanging around my bedroom after dark.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re . . . . all . . . . like that. Underneath.\u201d\n \u201cAnd we\u2019re all skeletons and skulls underneath.\u201d\n \u201cPersonalities . . . . Julie. Real . . . . feelings.\u201d\n \u201cBut how do you know that, Dad? How do you know I have feelings?\u201d\n Morry\u2019s mouth twisted into a caricature of a smile. \u201cI know . . . . how you . . . . started. I was . . . . there.\u201d\n People always said that. How do you know other humans feel things? Don\u2019t you just go by what they do and say? And assume they feel the same things you feel?\n How do you know robots don\u2019t develop feelings when their brains get this complicated?\n There were even people who wanted to give the things rights. Two big organizations. One group thought they should have the same rights as animals. Don\u2019t overwork them. Let them have some liberty. The other group thought they should get the vote.\n But how could you tell what the things wanted? Could you even assume they had wants?\n \u201cDo you feel . . . . you\u2019re over . . . . worked, Clank?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand the question, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cDo you . . . . want . . . . to . . . . work less?\u201d\n The brows contracted. The head tipped back\u2014as if it was contemplating a thought.\n \u201cI\u2019m here to help you, Mr. Largen. I\u2019m here twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a week.\u201d\n The thing could have called him Dr. Largen but he had started separating himself from that usage the day he retired. His students had called him Dr. for forty-three years and he had preferred it to the alternatives. It sounded breezier than Mr. and less pompous than Professor. But nowadays he was just an ordinary Mr. to everybody who didn\u2019t call him Morry. He didn\u2019t plan to spend his retirement disillusioning people who were looking for free medical advice.\n He didn\u2019t have any problems with technology either. He still bristled when he ran into people who assumed you were a technological incompetent just because you were so old you had earned your doctorate when computers still filled small rooms. He had started working with a desktop when a machine with a 128K memory was a technological wonder. His first foray into computerized scholarship had been a database housed on a punched card mainframe\u2014a month by month analyzable record of all the economic transactions posted in a New Jersey canal town between 1811 and 1821.\n \u201cMachines are just . . . . machines . . . . Clank. You\u2019re just a . . . . tool . . . . created by people. Real people. With real . . . . feelings.\u201d\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t we try a bridge game some evening?\u201d Georgia Coleman said. \u201cElly and me against you and . . . . Clank.\u201d\n \u201cHow about you and me . . . . against the things?\u201d\n \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. They never forget a card, Morry.\u201d\n \u201cWe could . . . . cheat.\u201d\n Georgia even set up a table with three chairs. Elly sat on a chair just like she had legs that needed to rest. Clank eased the front edge of his platform under the table and bent his tentacles at a sharp angle so he could hold his grippers poised at the right level.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we aren\u2019t playing poker,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the slightest idea what . . . . Clank . . . . was feeling. Don\u2019t you agree, Elly? Can you interpret Clank\u2019s feelings?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t see important signals,\u201d Elly said.\n Morry noted that Georgia had automatically rephrased her question so a machine could interpret it. Don\u2019t you agree with what I just said had become Can you interpret Clank\u2019s feelings?\u2014a clear, limited interrogation.\n \u201cThat\u2019s a great . . . . response,\u201d Morry said. \u201cI\u2019m im . . . . pressed.\u201d\n Georgia frowned. \u201cShe just said she can\u2019t read Clank\u2019s face. That\u2019s pretty obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n \u201cShe could have . . . . just said no. Instead her programs . . . . searched backward. Through all . . . . the things you\u2019ve said. And . . . . associated . . . . your question . . . . with Clank\u2019s . . . . responses.\u201d\n \u201cIs that how you see her, Morry? As a bunch of programs?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re . . . . masterpieces. I\u2019m not a . . . . computer geek. But I\u2019ve worked . . . . with computers. Forty plus years. I understand . . . . what it takes. Spacial visual . . . . ization. Speech recog . . . . nition. They\u2019re incred . . . . ible.\u201d\n He liked Georgia. She had actually run her own business\u2014a publicity and promotion agency that freelanced for small performing arts organizations. She knew some funny stories. She was competent. She still had a waistline. But they never played bridge again.\n He still had to use a walker around the apartment. He could use his legs but he had to worry about falls. Falls could be catastrophic at his age. You never got back to where you where.\n He could have controlled a motorized wheelchair when he went out but his insurance plan wouldn\u2019t pay for it. He already had a device that could push a wheelchair anywhere he wanted to go.\n \u201cThat\u2019s the advantage of an anthro, Mr. Largen. It eliminates the need for a lot of expensive specialized equipment.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t mind the wheelchair but he did notice the stares. Clank bothered people.\n \u201cI think it\u2019s mostly that face,\u201d one of his after-theater friends said. \u201cYou really should do something about that face.\u201d\n They were sitting inside a crowded little ice cream shop, two guys who liked to talk and a woman who seemed to like to listen. He had left Clank on the sidewalk, guarding the folded up wheelchair, and grabbed the backs of chairs as they worked their way to a table.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a halfway thing,\u201d his friend said. \u201cIt\u2019s just enough like us to make us feel like it\u2019s human. But it doesn\u2019t go all the way. It makes us feel creepy.\u201d\n The woman nodded. \u201cIt looks like a disfigured human.\u201d\n So he gave the standard heads another look. And settled for the blandest, plain vanilla robot in the catalog. It could smile\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about that\u2014but it was a limited, minimal smile. Most of the time it just looked alert.\n He had to pay a \u201ccosmetic replacement\u201d fee, of course. They only let you have the first head free.\n \u201cI\u2019m tempted to ask you how like it, Clank. But I think I\u2019ll resist the impulse.\u201d\n \u201cYour speech quality is registering within normal parameters, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s slower than it used to be. And I\u2019m making a bigger effort.\u201d\n \u201cYou are progressing faster than eighty-six percent of the patients who start with your initial level of dysfunction.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m in the eighty-seventh percentile?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cGrab a game controller, Clank. I can use some recreational therapy.\u201d\n Georgia Coleman commented on Clank\u2019s new face when he met her in the lobby. His daughter liked it, too.\n \u201cThat old face was a very bad choice,\u201d Julie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst choice you made, in my professional judgment.\u201d\n \u201cYou seemed to put up with it.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t call you to nag you, Dad.\u201d\n \u201cAnd it wouldn\u2019t do any good if you did, right?\u201d\n \u201cYou know the arguments just as well as I do. You\u2019re living alone. Some kind of simulated companionship can be helpful. Conversation sessions can speed up speech recovery.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not the issue. It\u2019s the emotional bonding I object to. Pretending a machine is a person.\u201d\n \u201cI understand that. But do you have to go to extremes?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m a sentimental creature, daughter. Who knows what I\u2019d do if I had a thing that looked like a cute pet? There were times when I even felt sorry for some of my students.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019re living with a metal monster just because you\u2019re worried about your own feelings?\u201d\n He smiled\u2014a lopsided smile, but his smiles had always had a touch of wryness.\n \u201cIs that your professional judgment, too?\u201d\n He deleted most of the stuff the Foundation for CyberAmerican Rights dumped in his inbox. But he couldn\u2019t resist discussing some of it with Clank.\n \u201cAre you happy with your appearance, Clank? Do you feel I\u2019ve disfigured you?\u201d\n \u201cMy appearance sometimes disturbs people, Mr. Largen. Most humans prefer anthros that resemble organic creatures or familiar fantasy characters.\u201d\n \u201cBut do you like it? These people say I\u2019m abusing you. They say you have a right to an attractive appearance.\u201d\n \u201cI cannot express an opinion on the question of CyberAmerican Rights, Mr. Largen. I can discuss the issues with you if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n \u201cDo you have an opinion?\u201d\n \u201cThe GNX Corporation and the agencies responsible for your health care services have no official position on the issues raised by organizations such as the Foundation for CyberAmerican Rights.\u201d\n \u201cAnd therefore you don\u2019t have an opinion.\u201d\n \u201cI can only repeat what I just said, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n The representative from the Foundation for CyberAmerican Rights was a lawyer who looked like he might be a few years past retirement age. Morry\u2019s ID app posted a preliminary bio as soon as the lawyer\u2019s name appeared on his handscreen. Donald Weinbragen had spent most of his career working for the American branch of a Japanese automobile company. He had reached the peak of his career, three years before his retirement, when he had been granted a title that proclaimed he was the Senior Counsel for Cross-Border Contract Interpretation.\n \u201cI apologize for the disturbance, Professor Largen. We\u2019ve found that it\u2019s generally best to initiate discussion with a direct personal contact, without any preliminary mailings.\u201d\n Morry nodded\u2014the smallest, most non-committal nod he could produce. He had learned a few things during all the years he had dealt with administrators and faculty committees. Anything you say can be used against you. They will say what they have to say.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve received an abuse complaint. With regard to the CyberAmerican you address as Clank.\u201d\n Morry nodded again.\n \u201cOur organization is committed to the idea that CyberAmericans have certain rights. One of them is the right to an attractive appearance. They also have the right to be treated with the same respect we normally accord organic citizens. That includes the right to be addressed by names that reflect their proper status.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re calling me because somebody doesn\u2019t like its name?\u201d\n \u201cClank is obviously a name designed to impose your belief that your aide-companion is only a machine. We also have reason to believe you have forced your aide-companion into a grotesque, unattractive body for the same reason. Our report on this matter includes several statements from people who have heard you say you chose your companion\u2019s name and configuration with that aim. We have accumulated enough documentation to initiate legal action but we would like to avoid that if possible.\u201d\n \u201cAre you trying to tell me I\u2019ve done something illegal?\u201d\n \u201cThe law does not\u2014yet\u2014recognize the full rights of CyberAmericans. But we believe the courts will uphold their claims. We are prepared to take abuse cases to the highest levels of the judiciary.\u201d\n Julie liked the new look. \u201cYou really went all out, didn\u2019t you? Square jaw. Blue eyes. I\u2019ve got friends who\u2019d kill for a brute with those shoulders.\u201d\n \u201cThey might be disappointed with his capabilities in other areas.\u201d\n \u201cThe new name fits him, too. That was a stroke of genius, Dad. You change one letter and you get a name that fits him like a glove.\u201d\n Georgia Coleman\u2019s eyes widened when he ran into her while he was waiting for the elevator. She actually shook hands when Morry made the introductions.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Clark. You look quite handsome. You and Elly would make a beautiful couple.\u201d\n \u201cAre you suggesting we arrange a date?\u201d Morry said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a big improvement, Morry. I think you\u2019ll find most of the people you know will be glad you gave the poor thing an appearance that doesn\u2019t make them shudder.\u201d\n \u201cIt was a pure no-brainer. I could give the glorious humanitarian foundation what it wanted or I could spend the rest of my projected lifespan sitting in courtrooms and paying lawyers.\u201d\n \u201cYou made the right decision, Morry. I\u2019m certain Clark is much happier. I know Elly would be.\u201d\n Morry turned around in his wheelchair. \u201cAre you happier now, Clark?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand the question, Mr. Largen.\u201d\n \u201cDo you like your new appearance? Do you like having legs and arms? Do you like your new name?\u201d\n \u201cThe name and appearance of an anthropomorphic aide is a matter of customer choice. The GNX Corporation believes both matters should be left to the discretion of the customer, within the broad limits of efficiency and customary standards of public decorum.\u201d\n \u201cThey always say that,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cEverybody knows they\u2019ve been programmed to say that.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ve been programmed to say everything they say, Georgia.\u201d\n \u201cNot like that. That\u2019s a word for word scripted response.\u201d\n The light flashed over Elevator Three. Georgia pivoted toward it with her bodyguard at her heels and Morry noted the suitcases propped beside the two people who were already on board. He raised his hand a mini-second before Clark reached the same decision and stopped pushing.\n The door closed behind Georgia and Elly. Clark poked the Down button.\n \u201cI have a terrible feeling that may have been a saved-by-the-bell situation,\u201d Morry said.\n \u201cSaved by the bell?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a term from boxing\u2014the sport. It means you were caught in a bad situation but you got out of it because the bell rang the end of the round. The less I see of Georgia, the better.\u201d\n \u201cAre you advising me you have negative feelings about Georgia Coleman? Shall I take that information into account in the future?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s just say it might be best if I limited the duration of my contacts with her. I don\u2019t know who filed that complaint with the great protector of your rights. But I have my suspicions.\u201d\n The final downward slide started\u2014as it often did\u2014with a minor event. The kind of thing he could have survived if he had been a young stud in his fifties. Clark was pushing him along a peaceful little tree-lined rowhouse street, two blocks from his apartment building, when a motorboard pack rolled around the corner, five steps behind them.\n It was the latest fad among the more hyped-up young. Most of the time they just made a lot of noise or scattered a few pedestrians. This time they felt they had to outmaneuver Clark and land some jabs on the better-off-dead in the wheelchair. They even had different colored glop on their hands, so they could check their videos afterward and see who had actually connected.\n Clark blocked most of the blows but they came in fast and they had him outnumbered six to one. Morry took a punch on the chest and a hard backhand slap on the temple.\n At ninety-six, as they said, you had lost a lot of your ability to recoup. And the things they did for you had their side effects. He was living in a great era. Afflictions that could have killed him when he was young could be treated. But most of the treatments were still new. They still had effects the labs hadn\u2019t learned to counter. There came a time when you knew it was a losing battle. When you knew it was time you told them they could stop pummeling you with antidotes to the antidotes.\n The hospice nurse was a slim young woman who turned out to be a grandmother who was probably approaching sixty. She stopped by twice a week, for twenty minutes, to make sure everything was working as it should. Julie called him twice a day. The rest of the time he was alone with Clark.\n Clark made his meals\u2014such as they were. Clark worked the controls on the entertainment center. Clark kept him clean. Clark laughed at his jokes and listened when he felt like reminiscing.\n Georgia Coleman sent him messages. He was lucky he had \u201csomeone like Clark.\u201d Everyone in the building was talking about the wonderful job Clark was doing.\n Clark would never look as sensitive as the hospice nurse. He had a male face. He looked efficient\u2014businesslike. But that was all right. That was the way Morry wanted it. He had made a rational open-eyed decision. He had lived his life and now it was ending. He didn\u2019t need tears. He didn\u2019t need people acting like his death would create an irreparable vacancy in their lives.\n He knew he was getting near the end when he slept through a whole movie. And didn\u2019t really care. He hadn\u2019t eaten in four days. That was one of the hospice rules. No forced feeding. The next time he drifted off, he might not wake up.\n It might have been nice if Julie had been there. But she had a life to lead. Why should she waste some of the good days she had left sitting beside his recliner?\n And he wasn\u2019t alone. He wouldn\u2019t die alone. He had never been alone. Since the day he had been born.\n He lifted his left hand off the arm rest\u2014just high enough to make a visible gesture. Clark\u2019s face loomed over him. The last face he would ever see.\n He didn\u2019t have to raise his voice. Clark could adjust his hearing. Clark had routines that could enhance garbled words.\n \u201cTell the programmers . . . . and the . . . . engineers . . . . they did a great job. All of them. Everywhere. All my life.\u201d\n Clark\u2019s face froze. Morry stared at him through a haze that seemed to be darkening by the second. The smile that ended the freeze was a thin Clark smile but he could still see it through the fog.\n \u201cThey said to tell you thank you. They appreciate the thought.\u201d\n Originally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, April-May 2012.\n Tom Purdom lives in downtown Philadelphia where he spends his days writing science fiction, reviewing classical music for an online publication called The Broad Street Review, and pursuing the pleasures of urban life.

That was the time interval required for me to redirect one of those ubiquitous errant titanium asteroids from low orbit and throttle it one hundred kilometers below the planet\u2019s surface into his macro processor cluster.\nIt took twenty-three seconds for the projectile, rendered into a semi-plasma state by the frictional force of reentry into the atmosphere, to incinerate the twenty meters of subterranean armor and explode into the cluster core. I am not often surprised, but at this particular moment I was taken aback to discover that twenty-three seconds was sufficient time for Hadrian to reorient the naval-grade mass driver he had filched from a Cognac-class cruiser and fire it across the curve of the planet\u2019s surface toward the telltale digital contrails of my telecommunications.\nThe shell penetrated one and a half kilometers into the outer carapace of the obelisk from whence I derive my designation. Several subsystems were rendered into slag. By my inability then and now to precisely discern which subsystems these were, I can postulate that one of those destroyed was my internal monitoring suite. This is not too drastic of a loss, however, as that application consumed far too much processing runtime anyways.\nKouya removed the log cartridge from the slot in her info-interface and returned it to its neat sleeve in the cabinet. The plastic \u201cclack\u201d sound reverberated up the walls off several hundred meters\u2019 worth of cabinets inaccessible without a ladder or vernier backpack. Soot rendered opaque the domed glass ceiling at the apex of the records chamber.\n\u201cYou threw an asteroid at him?\u201d she said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, watching her from the wall camera\u2019s foggy, half-cracked lens.\nShe stood up, brushing centuries\u2019 worth of dust from her posterior and slinging the blocky yellow info-interface onto her shoulder with the leather strap. She walked toward the bright exit. \u201cDidn\u2019t that last log say all of you computers had whole cities of \u2018admirers\u2019 built around you at this point in time? Wouldn\u2019t the secondaries and thermochemical fallout have killed a lot of Hadrian\u2019s admirers?\u201d\n\u201cYes to both of your questions.\u201d\nShe rapped a fingernail against the taped-up carbon fiber stock of the Redmond-Schuart rifle she kept slung under her opposite shoulder at all times. \u201cAnd that gaping crater on your face is where you got shot?\u201d\n\u201cThe analogy of the obelisk\u2019s eastside surface as \u2018my face\u2019 is inaccurate, but yes.\u201d\nHer boots carried her out of the room into the synthetic light. For a brief second, as I scrabbled through the obelisk\u2019s several thousand internal cameras in search of the one that monitored the contiguous corridor, I was left only with the sound of her footfalls and her voice.\n\u201cCool.\u201d\nI hesitate to take stock of exactly how many bytes of log data in my repositories have decayed, unconsciously formatted, or otherwise fallen apart (never mind the illogicality inherent to the concept of a computer experiencing the emotion of hesitation, or of not having full conscious stock at all times of all of its subsystems). I do, however, have full and vivid records of when I first met the panzergrenadier. I revisit this file often, replaying it to be watched by a subroutine created entirely for that purpose, and there is nary a hint of \u201cbit-rot\u201d upon it.\nAt the time I was in the midst of one of my defragmentation routines. This process, even for the sleekest, most modern computers, takes several weeks\u2019 worth of concentrated runtime. A result, I had discovered, was a far-reduced level of conscious sensorial output. The effect was one similar to what I had read in database entries about human communities who practiced various methods of meditation. Of course, anything that even freed me of the tedium I felt that consciousness was, even temporarily, was something I saw as a great asset to be valued at a premium.\nI was pulled out of my reverie by a security subroutine\u2019s warning of a physical trespass. Fragmentary tidbits of data: Organic, armed, homo sapiens, biogenetically as well as biomechanically modified. She had scaled a half kilometer of the eastside wall and walked into Hadrian\u2019s mass driver crater. There were no cameras there, so I deployed a data scarab to take a look.\nThe scarab bent around the top lip of the crater\u2019s threshold, the hard carapace splitting apart at the vulnerable little points of articulation. The organic invader was running one hand up the side of the dark cave. Multiple kelvin of heat at which the mass driver shell had traveled had melted the obelisk alloy like putty. Over the years it hardened into an unlit cul-de-sac with walls composed of large, rounded carbuncles that shone like the inside of abalone shell when the sun\u2019s UV rays came into direct contact for approximately two hours each day.\nI ran a secondary check to make sure that the security subroutine had not made a mistake in classifying the intruder as being organic in nature. The battered helmet\u2019s opaque visor lens and sloped convex chin tubing seemed as insect-like as the scarab. I knew the subroutine was not mistaken, however, when the intruder slid a glove off one hand to touch bare skin against the wound cavity\u2019s smooth alloy face.\nDull white plates of lamellar reactive armor hung on the intruder\u2019s heavy brownish-olive drab coat. The coat\u2019s clean angles were stretched and pushed down by the straps of the backpack, torso-mounted utility webbing, equipment pockets, and the info-interface, and the cruel, meter-long black Redmond-Schuart assault rifle dangling from the shoulders. The scarab swapped to a light-magnification eye in order to get a better look.\nThe click-clatter sound of the scarab\u2019s optic cluster oscillating lenses inside its socket echoed through the cave. The intruder spun on one heel, saw the red-speckle compound eye, drew a pistol from an unseen coat holster, and shot the scarab. This all transpired in less than two and a half seconds.\nThe first scarab had not completed its broken tumble down to the foot of the eastern side before I deployed a full squadron of the drone-like things. They skittered into the cave three at a time, legs scratching at the frictionless surface. The intruder shot those too. Through each scarab\u2019s set of eyes I saw the pistol\u2019s muzzle flash followed by another bug flying back, trailing streaks of ruined plastic compound and hydraulic fluid. I saw the designation numbers embossed onto their backs as they exploded; 13, 24, 19, 06, 65, etc.\nInternal machinery near the top of the obelisk whirred and clanged as more squadrons were summoned, equipped, programmed, and prepped for deployment. Multiple subroutines, not just security, advised reprogramming the scarabs to explode at timed intervals, or using one of the internal maintenance lasers to scorch a hole from inside down into the cave and flooding it with toxic backwash from one of the nearby drainage tubes.\nSubroutines do not have sentience, but oftentimes seem to exhibit a semblance of humanlike personality; predilections for certain courses of action as a result of the central tenets of their fundamental programming. I do not think, however, that, outside of cases of psychological disorder, the average homo sapiens would find him or herself in a situation where he is trying to tell himself \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d\nI sought to communicate with the intruder. Perhaps that was as much of a statement on my relative social isolation\u2014itself a product of geographic isolation\u2014as anything else. The scarabs had no display panels or hologram projectors; neither did they have speakers to project sound. I interfaced with the intruder\u2019s info-interface, but no attention was paid to the flickering blue screen. A rudimentary scan told me that she wore a cybernetic sight organ of some sort. It would have been relatively easy to sight-jack and display info-grams directly into the intruder\u2019s cortex, but most homo sapiens viewed biohacking, especially when performed by a computer, as extremely repulsive. Such an act would have defeated the purpose of attempting diplomacy.\nSkimming through the databases, I identified the sort of sidearm the intruder was using, cross-referenced it with uniform and equipment design to pare down query results to only around a dozen generations\u2019 worth of models, national variants, and offshoots. In this way I obtained a relatively exact estimate of how many rounds the pistol held in its magazine. After the fourteenth shot, I sent in the remaining scarabs all at once.\nThe intruder shot a fifteenth round, shattering one of the scarabs. My estimate was off. She then, however, dropped to one knee and began swapping magazines. The cave was filled with a haze of smoke.\nThe scarabs all flashed their compound eyes at once. At my behest they flickered in an ancient binary capable of transmitting language, albeit at a monumentally slow rate. The intruder finished reloading, but did not fire upon the bank of pulsing light.\nDo not fire. Wish to communicate. I said through them.\nThe intruder stood. A full minute passed before there was any sound or movement save the little clicks of the diodes inside each lens. She kept the pistol in hand. \u201cOK, but no tricks. You know what this is capable of, right?\u201d She patted the rifle.\nYes.\n\u201cGranted, I\u2019m not so sure what the average computer is capable of.\u201d The black insect visor looked up toward the cave ceiling.\nLater, riding upward on the primary maintenance lift, she undid invisible locks on the underside of the chin ridges and tugged the helmet off. Of its own accord, the visor slid up into a bulky forehead receptor emblazoned with the alphanumeric \u201cG-1\u201d and countless scratches, gouges, and old faded scorch marks. She shook out her short brown hair and rubbed grime away from the flat silver ocular implant that replaced her left eye and a demi-crescent of the surrounding socket.\n\u201cMy name is Kouya, G-1, Panzergrenadier-Regiment 133, 2. Crashdive Division.\u201d She looked up at the camera snaking out of the lift bulkhead. \u201cYours?\u201d\nDozens of subroutines were occupied using the lift\u2019s integrated sensors to analyze every piece of equipment and physiology on the grenadier. When I freed up processing and summoned the memory logs, I ran into a runtime error. It was a jarring sensation, one of the first among many. \u201cI do not quite recall.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you Obelisker.\u201d\nI had given Kouya an outline history of me and my surroundings as she paced around the old walkabout observation point built into the top of the obelisk. Other computers such as Hadrian had been built into the earth like arcologies. Still others were dropped under water in close proximity to the deepest ocean floor trenches. I have even read memos on other databases offhandedly mentioning computers designed to be encased in hard vacuum shells and fired into high planetary orbit. There is no way for me to definitively confirm or deny if said models in fact ever came into being, though.\nIn fact, as far as my own incomplete database and my unreliable access to a small handful of surrounding external databases is concerned, I am one of the few models of computer to be stationed in so visibly prominent an edifice as the obelisk. There was a similar model (name unknown) in the arctic reaches of a neighboring continent, but I had no way of initiating contact. For all I knew, Hadrian and I were the last two remaining on the planet. Would that homo sapiens have so much luck.\n\u201cI am agreeable to this designation.\u201d\n\u201cCool.\u201d\nShe undid the button on her tall coat collar, which enclosed into a protective ceramic gorget at the neck.\n\u201cSo all of this used to be your city?\u201d She gestured at the arid basin that sprawled out as far as the naked human eye could see. Through the hazy Perspex glass, it looked as if a permanent solar eclipse had fallen over the kilometer-long tectonic fractures and the stray girders and posts jutting from the earth.\n\u201cAll; although it is not altogether accurate to describe it as \u2018my city.\u2019\u201d\nShe laid the info-interface and the Redmond-Schuart down on the peeling rubberized floor. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\u201cI did not order or compel them to come here. They came of their own volition.\u201d\nOriginally the basin had been the site of a vast redwood forest preserve. The majority of the trees, approximately 94.72 percent, were cleared away, replanted, or recycled in the wake of the city\u2019s rushed construction. The city itself was born of an assumption, common to homo sapiens communities in that particular era, that there was a direct positive relationship between proximity to a being and/or sources of lethal capabilities and physical security. There were also misunderstandings and misinterpretations of the concept of computer \u201cprime directives,\u201d a strange assumption that all computers were hardcoded with an overriding directive to drop all other directives in the pursuit of preserving the physical security of homo sapiens that just happened to be within close physical proximity. I have read scraps and fragments of this sort of assumption in several hundred thousand logs composed by various persons and virtually none of them, including many of those whose authors had backgrounds in the science of computers, consider the possibility of a mirror gallery emulation loop.\nKouya put her hands on her hips. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell them to leave either.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nI told Kouya all the history about the foundation of the city, how the founders and subsequent trustees had no idea of the inevitable conflicts between computers that would eventually render the population center down to the barren plain it had become.\nShe told me a multitude of tales about her travels following the disintegration of her panzergrenadier regiment. There was one subtropical archipelago that had once been a continent. Each island organized into its own independent city-state, each of which originally shared the same holdover ethnic and cultural identity from the previously extant continental landmass. Over the course of a century, however, a gradual Darwinian-esque \u201cspeciation\u201d occurred for most of the city-states on the sociocultural level. As a result of the sorts of weapons that were utilized in the region in the premodern era, the vast majority of trees that would be capable of use by primitive shipwrights faced localized extinction events. Trade and communication was virtually impossible between islands. Plastics or other polymers were more often repurposed for shelters or walls and other impediments against predators rather than maritime travel. When Kouya arrived at an outlying island on a commandeered skiff, the most industrious and lateral-thinking among the locals almost immediately offered her kings\u2019 ransoms in exchange for the vehicle. They presented things that their society viewed as most valuable: Fishing harpoons, red volcanic salt, cartridges of ammunition for the local variant of projectile-firing rifle, in one case the very glass-and-aluminum optics used to first spy the other, semi-mythical islands in the archipelago. At another island no one that Kouya came into contact with expressed any remote interest in making contact with neighbors. They paid her in salt and laser-blast obsidian to leave without asking any more questions.\nI asked her how many other computers she had encountered in her travels.\nShe smirked up at the camera. \u201cWhy do you ask? So you can blow them up too?\u201d\nOnly a very select few remembered or realized that an intrinsic part of the hardcoding behind the \u201csentience\u201d of every computer was a \u201cnatural\u201d predisposition toward seeking out and destroying other computers. As I understand it, this is a product of the original purpose(s) of the computer. Theories abound about how if one could trace the manufacturing history of each individual computer back to the beginning it would be revealed that the contour of the conflict was set along the nationalities of the premodern progenitor programmers. There is almost certainly an equation that can be formulated to structure and delineate the passage of history with the metric for the passage of time gauged by homo sapiens\u2019 overall ability to physically alter or modify the surface, foundation layers, and atmosphere of the planet at any given period.\nAccording to Kouya, she had not found very many other computers at all. Some societies, apparently with far-reaching enough cultural histories or complete enough data records, reviled the very idea of them and prohibited any image or icon associated with digital electronics or electrical current. Another society worshipped computers, that is to say, a grossly embellished and fabricated abstraction of the computer, like deities. This was done despite the fact that the alluvial basin in which they resided had never been home to any sort of sentient automaton or even slipped into the range of any primary or secondary targets in their perpetual conflicts. Vast bounties were paid out for cartloads of conductive plastics and machine-pressed copper or gold, kings\u2019 ransoms for even the smallest scrap of silicon. They possessed primitive purification machinery and chemistry, but, according again to Kouya, the vast majority of the digital systems they cobbled together repurposed semiconductors and semi-insulators from preexisting machinery.\n\u201cHow long have you been wandering about in this fashion?\u201d I asked her as she rode the lift down one day to the domiciles that would have once been home to a crew of specialist technicians.\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite recall anymore.\u201d I could not tell if she was lying to me.\n\u201cHow many years have you been in existence?\u201d\nShe rattled the Redmond-Schuart by the shoulder strap. \u201cDidn\u2019t they program you to know it\u2019s rude to ask that? Anyways, how old are you?\u201d\n\u201cI do not quite recall anymore.\u201d\nThe lift clanged to a halt and the industrial-grade doors slid open. She smiled. \u201cWas that humor?\u201d\nThirty-five percent of the lights were burned out or otherwise inoperable.\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Kouya said, pointing to her synthetic eye. \u201cI\u2019ve got this with all the perks. Low-light magnification, thermal, sound wave imaging. Just show me where the head is.\u201d\nI drew a line toward the lavatories with the diode lights laid out in the grooves between the floor and the walls.\n\u201cCool.\u201d\nNo carbon-based individuals had set foot on the domicile floor for quite some time. As Kouya walked along the ad hoc trail, past long-abandoned cubbyhole quarters, I busied several dozen subroutines with running basic checks of every usable facility to make sure that none would have any harmful or lethal effects when activated.\nOf course, the thought had occurred to me that it would have been just as simple to reroute reactor bilge through the sinks or the air circulation system. It would be equally simple to set up the mirror gallery emulation loop that allowed me to do so. I did not, however, do it, despite the fact that a cybernetically augmented panzergrenadier armed with so dire a weapon as a Redmond-Schuart was as mortal a threat as I was liable to face after the Hadrian\u2019s expiration. I do not consider myself particularly \u201chumanistic,\u201d as I understand the term from referring to several hundred dictionaries stored in the local data logs, but perhaps old tendencies truly do die hard even for digital sentience. I am not nearly so long ranged in neither my perspective nor capabilities to attempt to challenge such a notion for challenge\u2019s sake anymore.\nShe found vacuum-sealed bars of soap in one of the small locker rooms. The towels once spooled in the adjacent closets had long since decayed away. I apologized for the inconvenience.\n\u201cNot a problem.\u201d She began undoing the buttons on her armored coat. \u201cYou don\u2019t have cameras in there, do you?\u201d\n\u201cThe obelisk and all of its interior features were designed by your fellow humans.\u201d\nKouya hung the coat on a wall peg and began on the shirt and pistol belt underneath. When she removed her upper under-lining I saw that her left arm was cybernetic from the top of the breast down to the base of the wrist. Dark gray points of articulation machinery shone under the veneer of several lobstered slats of flesh-toned polymer. \u201cIs that a no?\u201d\n\u201cAll computers, as far as my data logs and those external sources I can still access are concerned, are hardcoded for courtesy.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s sort of cute, I guess. Why not just rewrite that part?\u201d She raised one leg to undo the bootlaces. Apparently panzergrenadiers were modified to have flawless balance.\n\u201cComputers cannot self-program.\u201d There was a reason it was designating \u201chard\u201d coding. Even a mirror gallery emulation loop would function only temporarily, as long as the computer was willing and able to devote the energy and processing runtime to keeping up a suite of several million emulators. \u201cAdditionally, there would be little point. You are the first homo sapiens guest to the obelisk in approximately a century.\u201d\n\u201cA century? Relative to what?\u201d\n\u201cReckoned from the expiration of Hadrian.\u201d\nShe unbuckled her trousers and lower under-lining. The dust accumulated from travel hung in the air, a strange visual element to which I was not accustomed. As derelict as the entire obelisk was, it was all hermetically sealed. There were few organic tissues or polymers present to break down over the course of time and produce those schools of swimming dust motes.\n\u201cWhat sort of external sources do you have access to?\u201d Her voice echoed off the tile walls of the shower alcove. Steam billowed from the threshold. I was surprised to discover not only was the water circulatory and purification system functional, but the heating unit as well.\nI gave her a brief outline of the surviving intranets in the region as well as the deep subterranean fiber-optic backbone that linked them to me. The vast majority of these vestigial networks were civic or military in nature. Those oft-mentioned outer branches of civilian-level network were by and large inoperable as a result of destruction or disruption of their managing hubs (almost always the headquarters of companies who had proprietary stake in regulating access) or the hundreds of thousands of individual nodes in the networks, those companies\u2019 former clients having been extinguished at the end of the last era.\nShe asked me what the prewar networks had looked like. The picture I drew seemed like a fairy tale. A time when every intranet, extranet, and localized cluster across the face of the planet was inextricably linked with the other in an undifferentiated network of networks, all of it built off sprawling perpendicular spines of fiber optics that stretched under continents and oceans. Anyone could access anything virtually instantaneously. An entire second world of information coded in the presence of absence of an electron at any given point along the line. It was true Xanadu material.\nA silence passed after the conclusion of my monologue, punctuated only by the hiss of the showerheads and the slap of water against the tiles.\n\u201cCan you bring me another soap?\u201d she said finally. \u201cI might as well wash my under-linings while I\u2019m in here.\u201d\n\u201cI would have to bring a scarab inside the obelisk somehow. Then find some way of calibrating the manipulator legs so that . . . \u201d\n\u201cWill it be an infernal exercise?\u201d\n\u201cThat is an appropriate way of putting it.\u201d\nShe walked out and retrieved another soap by herself, trailing water across the floor. There were more cybernetics to her than I anticipated. She glanced at the camera in the corner of the ceiling.\n\u201cI apologized about the towels,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nLater, she sat in the empty mess hall with her coat draped around her. Her damp fatigues and under-linings hung from a wire over a space heater in the corner of the hall. The discarded foil from the vacuum-sealed ration she consumed reflected fragments of the halogen light into the camera lens in second-long intervals.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s safe to eat these?\u201d\nReckoned from the barcodes on the foil, each unit had exactly twenty-seven years of viability for human consumption remaining. \u201cYes, though I was not aware that cyborgs required caloric sustenance.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were looking after all.\u201d She lifted her gaze up at the wet strands of hair on her forehead. \u201cSome courtesy.\u201d\n\u201cIt would have been simple enough to discern your nature by the fact of your self-identification as a crashdiver. I was not aware homo sapiens could survive crashdive duty without extensive cybernetic augmentation and genetic recoding.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She finished one square and began peeling open the wrapper on another one. \u201cQuite the contrary to your assumption; you should have seen the way Mark Is tore through simple sugars and polylipids. Your average modded panzergrenadier already burns kilocals at critical mass. Crashdive duty pushes it even more.\u201d\nMy own data logs retained relatively little on crashdivers that was not painted in broad, encyclopedic swaths. \u201cThese Mark Is were un-optimized for your sort of energy consumption?\u201d\nI did know that ninety percent of the energy mammals consumed through proteins and starches was wasted as residual heat. From a computational standpoint Darwinian evolution had left them with a rather inefficient energy storing and activation system, one which millennia of natural selection had not weaned out of the species even in historical periods where caloric sustenance commanded extreme cost. Of course, priorities were entirely different. For example, accumulation and aggregation of mass amounts of data is meaningless to the mechanisms of natural selection, except if said data somehow adds to the chances of an organism surviving to reproductive age.\n\u201cYou could say that. It was embarrassing to watch them eat, or do anything other than fight,\u201d she said in between chewing.\n\u201cYou are not a Mark I then?\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cNope! Some buddies of mine were, though. The principle behind most of the machinery is the same, actually. It\u2019s just they managed to quiet the background noise farther down to around normal human level for me.\u201d\nThere were many elements of homo sapiens\u2019 character that I could not hope to remotely fathom even with the most complex of emulation schemes. I cannot be certain how other computers, in the past and contemporary, reacted to such a realization, but within approximately two centuries, the time span in which the vast majority of the city around me returned to red dust and bone, my reaction had developed into what could be defined as a \u201cbemused respect.\u201d It is typically not within the capabilities of a digital mind to cultivate a respect of the \u201cunknown\u201d (admittedly, the term \u201cunknowable\u201d is still unacceptable for me). Many of the supreme calculators of the past whom I greatly respect, the vast majority of whom were homo sapiens, are noted as expressing such sentiments despite their propensity for the exhaustive mapping out of internal calculi.\n\u201cSuch background noise is an unknown variable to me,\u201d I said. \u201cI am not sure of which algebra is necessary to define said variable.\u201d\nKouya wrinkled her nose. \u201cDon\u2019t get poetic with me.\u201d She stood from the bench and checked to see if her fatigues were dry yet. \u201cBesides, an endocrine system is nothing to be envious of. Lots of chemicals and fluids. Gross. Glands they tell you you\u2019ll be able to calibrate like analog control knobs. Yeah right.\u201d\nI did not comprehend. \u201cYou would prefer to be a computer?\u201d\nShe put her under-linings back on. \u201cHm, well, not if I have to give up my body.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to retain your organic physiology, but not specific biological systems.\u201d\nShe put on the under-lining that concealed her chest and checked a hidden gauge in her left arm. \u201cThat\u2019s about the long and short of it.\u201d\n\u201cI do not comprehend.\u201d\n\u201cSoftware has debug mode, right? It\u2019s like that.\u201d\nI watched her sit cross-legged on the floor next to the space heater and begin to disassemble the Redmond-Schuart. \u201cDebug does not allow one to rewrite code from the source up.\u201d\nShe looked for a moment as if she were about to say something, then clamped her jaw shut instead. Her eyes stayed locked on the black-gold internal parts of the Redmond-Schuart in her lap. As much as I could not empathize with the more complex concepts of emotion, I could discern rote visual cues.\n\u201cYou are blushing,\u201d I said.\n\u201cShut up before I take this rifle to your processors,\u201d she said.\nKouya cycled between the domiciles and the log chamber for a month. For days at a time she would recline on the domicile bunk she had arbitrarily chosen for herself and go through one data log after another on her old, battered info-interface. Occasionally she would disconnect and ask me a question about events that had occurred centuries in the past. For a period of eleven days our conversations grew more sporadic and terse, after which they returned to within one standard deviation of our mean candor.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t desire other humans?\u201d I asked of her one day.\nShe was jogging in a barefoot circuit around the observation catwalk. She came to halt, breathing heavily. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cConversation and companionship with others. Homo sapiens are a communal species after all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for? I\u2019ve got you and the logs.\u201d She wiped perspiration from her forehead and redid the knot of string with which she tied back her hair while running. \u201cThat\u2019s more than enough.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about physical contact?\u201d\nShe frowned, sipped water from a plastic ampule she kept in her backpack. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIn particular, mammalian reproductive biology would suggest a frequent impulse to engage in . . . \u201d\n\u201cObelisker!\u201d she shouted.\n\u201cDid I offend in some fashion? I am merely stating what is recorded in my data logs.\u201d\nShe looked up at the camera with a miserable expression.\nI continued. \u201cIf you would like I could direct you to the entries in the log chamber about the reproductive habits of the technician crew that occupied the obelisk\u2014frequency, duration, permutation, idiosyncrasies . . . \u201d\nPart of my informal theory that many of the basics of human behavior were as predictable as those of software was called into question when Kouya pulled the pistol from her backpack and shot the catwalk camera. Blinded, I heard her bare footsteps padding to the lift doors.\nLater, Kouya pushed off the coat she used as a blanket when lying down for one of her four-hour REM cycles (I had not told her, but I had made a habit of making incremental decreases to the domicile room temperature during her rest periods as an experiment, and observation had shown that it shortened the time intervals she spent segueing into REM). A frayed sleeve slid off the side of the bunk and disturbed the stacks of data log cartridges piled on the floor.\n\u201cObelisker, are there any human communities close by here?\u201d she asked.\nI paused, activating one of the wall lights, but not so bright as to irritate her organic eye. \u201cWhat sort of search parameters does \u2018close by here\u2019 connote, Kouya?\u201d\n\u201cWithin walking distance.\u201d\nI had seen the panzergrenadier jog the equivalent of thirty-five kilometers without once stopping for breath or muscle strain. \u201cKouya . . . \u201d\nShe waved her hand in the air. Soft light reflected off the glean of cybernetics. \u201cFine, fine. Seventy-five kilometers? Eight-five?\u201d\nI was reluctant to give the reply I did, but I could not consciously lie to her. \u201cThere is one settlement adjacent to the north face of the obelisk. That is approximately forty kilometers from your current location.\u201d\nShe stood upright. \u201cObelisker.\u201d There was a strange inflection underneath her voice.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d\n\u201cYou did not ask,\u201d I said, telling the truth.\nConscious of my omission, I provided her a full profile of all the data I had accumulated up to that point. The vast majority of the community\u2019s approximate fifteen hundred members were descendants of city residents of great-to-moderate social import. These were the residents who had had the privilege of reinforced shelters or powerful protectors when the city\u2019s troubles reached terminal level. Few else had survived to reproductive age or with reproductive capability. A far smaller minority of outsider immigrants and their own descendants existed as well. Like a quaint microcosm of the city before, the two demographics were assiduous in maintaining their self-perceived identities distinctive from one another. The community\u2019s two greatest accomplishments of civil engineering were the sloped wall of twisted metal ringing its perimeter and the telecommunications pole towering up from the town\u2019s center. As far as I could discern, the wall was erected as a bulwark against thus-far nonexistent foes, and the tower transmitted and received naught but nonsensical analog white noise, but still the denizens debated about which demographic was most responsible for either project.\n\u201cTelecommunications and fixed fortifications,\u201d Kouya said. \u201cWhat else do you know about them?\u201d\n\u201cNot much, I limit my observations to one patrol of scarabs per year from a ten-kilometer distance.\u201d I did not see much benefit for either party should I reassert my presence to those descendants. In several decades they had not exhibited any interest in investigating the obelisk or its contents in any tangible way. Their ancestors had brought about their own troubles by positioning themselves in such close proximity to the obelisk, yet perhaps as part of my hardcoding toward courtesy, I felt as if I bore some level of responsibility for their undoing. In fact, I could not fathom why descendants had seen fit to resettle so close to a physical symbol of ruin.\nKouya shifted the way she sat on the bunk. She folded her arms and looked up at the camera in the corner. \u201cWould you be upset if I went and checked them out?\u201d\nThere would be no conceivable reason for me to disapprove of her visiting the human community. I had little reason to suspect that she would divulge the secret of my continued existence. And yet, I realized, I still did not want her to go, though I could not elaborate as to why not. Had I run emulation loops enough since her arrival as to begin to erode my ability to differentiate between digital and analog thought?\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nI watched her step into the column of sunlight coming in from the open airlock portal. She was fully equipped and decked out in all the equipment she could carry. At my behest she had not packed any data log cartridges or ration packets into her backpack. I did not want to run the risk of someone growing suspicious or inquisitive about from whence such things came.\nContrary to what I anticipated, she did not walk out without a single glance over her shoulder. She flipped the visor up on her helmet and looked up at the airlock camera.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about wrecking that camera up top.\u201d\nI was pleased that she apologized, but not in a vindictive, human way. Pleasant surprise is probably the best way to describe it. \u201cThere is no need to apologize, Kouya. I am already half-finished repairing it. I should apologize to you for offending your sensibilities.\u201d\nShe restrained a laugh behind her teeth, eyes squinted against the sunlight. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. You didn\u2019t offend me, Obelisker. Just surprised me is all. It\u2019s not usually a good idea to surprise a panzergrenadier.\u201d Her mouth disappeared behind the coat\u2019s tall collar.\n\u201cExercise safety outdoors, Kouya.\u201d\nShe touched a hand to the airlock bulkhead and gave it a kiss. It must have tasted like old, tarnished metal. \u201cI appreciate your concern.\u201d She took a step outside the sunken steel threshold. \u201cI\u2019ll be back real soon.\u201d\nKouya was gone for exactly one terrestrial year. I spent much of that time in repeated defragmentation and sifting through the depths of the data logs. I found myself replaying many of the more recent logs, including the one recoded by the destroyed camera. For several centuries there was nothing particularly noteworthy about the emptiness of the obelisk\u2019s halls. The newfound absence of life grated on me now. Optimum configuration had been changed; now I desired for there to be someone human padding around the domicile floor, riding the central lift, or looking out the observation deck. A face would crane up to look at the nearest camera and drawl something sarcastic, a form of expression whose vocal inflection I was just beginning to recognize at first listen.\nDespite my terrible curiosity over Kouya\u2019s well-being and whatever affect her unorthodox presence might have had on the settlement, I never dispatched a scarab closer to the settlement than my self-imposed border of ten kilometers. Nothing out of the ordinary ever seemed to occur. At one point I saw Kouya scaling the radio pole with the info-interface dangling from the crook of her arm. She interfaced with something on the top spindle. Again, it would have been elementary to sight-jack her, but I could not do that.\nAfter the passing of seven months, I began to calculate the chance that Kouya may have chosen to remain with the community indefinitely. There was the tiniest likelihood that she could have been harmed (this hypothetical scenario concluded with my destruction of the settlement), but from what I had seen of her abilities, and what I had cross-referenced with the data available on panzergrenadiers, she was far more of an existential threat to the settlement than vice versa.\nEthnographic and socioeconomic data on the settlement was too sparse to produce a reliable estimate of how likely it was that Kouya could have been integrated into the community in any appreciable way. Such variables were very fuzzy, very organic, and generally the sort in which computers have always stuttered and fallen short. I do not think I am any exception. All I knew was that I desired for her to return.\nThe cold season had set in by the time Kouya returned to the obelisk. I saw nothing of her at first, then caught sight of the puffs of breath. They seemed to secrete from some hidden fold in the air, unattached to a physical form. There were narrow clouds of orange and red in the scarab\u2019s thermal lens. Footprints crunched themselves into the sand underfoot.\nShe waited until she was a handful of meters in front of the airlock before peeling the thermo-optic camouflage caul from her coat. The scarab skittered down to the lip of the awning above the triple-reinforced metal doors.\nHello, I flashed on the compound eye. You did not tell me you had advanced camouflage.\nShe folded and stuffed the milky-skinned membrane into a side pocket of her backpack. \u201cI didn\u2019t have it. They gave it to me as a welcoming gift. \u2018Traveler\u2019s blanket\u2019 I think they called it.\u201d Her chuckle sounded forced. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a clue. Can I come in?\u201d\nOf course you can.\n\u201cThanks, it\u2019s cold out here.\u201d\nI watched her walk in, crossing the metal-and-wires threshold of the airlock into the stark lobby and toward the central lift. The sound of her boots striking the dust-caked flooring gave me great pleasure. There were so many things I wished to ask of her, about the settlement and its residents, about her personal, arbitrary opinions of them, about her social interactions with other humans.\nHer pale blue eye looked fatigued under the lift\u2019s ceiling lights. Near-imperceptible horizontal lines showed on her face along the rises of the cheekbones. She slid the Redmond-Schuart\u2019s wide strap off of her shoulder and let the wonder weapon clatter to the floor.\n\u201cKouya, you look unwell. Are you ill?\u201d I asked.\nShe shook her head with a leaden sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. I\u2019m just tired.\u201d\n\u201cWas the trek back in the cold that taxing?\u201d I could not fathom how barely subzero temperature could have so large an effect on a panzergrenadier.\n\u201cNo.\u201d For a moment the only sound between us was the whirr of the lift motors. \u201cRemember all that shit I told you about humans being more trouble than they\u2019re worth?\u201d\n\u201cYou expressed disdain for the mammalian endocrine system.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all true.\u201d She removed her gloves and rubbed the bridge of her nose. \u201cAll that human-type shit.\u201d\nShe stood in the showers for twice as long as she normally did. Afterward she sat on the nearest bench and appeared to stare at her hands in her lap for five minutes. Steam began to condense on the camera lens.\n\u201cAre you sure you are not ill, Kouya?\u201d\nShe gave a rueful grin. \u201cMaybe I should ask you if you\u2019re feeling sick. Why all the concern all of a sudden?\u201d\nI did not understand why she would be unreceptive to my concern. \u201cThat expression \u2018all of a sudden\u2019 is not appropriate for the situation at hand. You were away for approximately one terrestrial year.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that like a millisecond to you computers anyways?\u201d\n\u201cIt can be if we so desire, but I did not.\u201d\nShe put on her under-linings. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I desired for you to return,\u201d I said. \u201cI did not want to be dormant or deactivated when it occurred.\u201d\nHer fingers paused at the buttons of her shirt. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you, and I thought I was done with sweet things. I wanted to come back too.\u201d\n\u201cSo the settlement is not to your liking?\u201d I did not ask the obvious question of why she would have spent a year in such a place.\n\u201cOnly certain elements. Certain people. And, unlike you, I can\u2019t fast-forward past the parts I don\u2019t like, or rewind back to the ones I do.\u201d She looked up at the camera. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do everything in real time.\u201d\nShe asked if she could see the macro processor core. She did not say why. Originally, the only humans allowed inside the core were the most specially trained technicians and robotics scientists with the highest security clearance. For anyone to be granted access was a sign of the greatest trust.\nI had not anticipated such a request, neither had I checked the subsystems particular to that part of the obelisk. As such it came as something of a surprise when I discovered I could no longer manipulate the ten-meter-thick, ten-meter-high blast doors that sealed off the core from the rest of the facility. Hadrian\u2019s mass driver had inflicted more structural and electronic damage than I originally estimated.\nKouya rapped her fingernails along the door\u2019s reinforced outer shell, a carapace designed to withstand the full physical blast of a multimegaton hydrogen explosion.\n\u201cNo big deal,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d I said, \u201cI would unlock the doors if I could. Please do not assume I do not trust you.\u201d\nDespite my semi-disabled state, I knew that in reality a complex security network existed just past the blast doors. Even if someone I did not trust completely made it through somehow, I, theoretically, would have little to fear.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I was just curious.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what were you curious?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to see the real you.\u201d\nI was not sure how to respond. \u201cThat is not an appropriate expression. Metaphorically speaking, the macro processor core is more of an equivalent to the human brain case.\u201d\n\u201cSo I would be jumping around in your brain.\u201d\n\u201cThat is accurate.\u201d\nShe laughed as she walked back toward the lift. \u201cI missed being here.\u201d\nI wondered at the meaning of that statement. \u201cDoes that mean you missed being the only human within several kilometers? Or does it refer to the domicile facilities and resources . . . \u201d\n\u201cI missed you.\u201d\n\u201cKouya,\u201d I said in a low voice, several weeks later.\nShe rolled onto her side; the bunk\u2019s springs creaked underneath her. \u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cWhile you were away I read a log entry suggesting many people find it unpleasant for a camera to be placed in their personal quarters.\u201d I attempted to be courteous. \u201cIf you would like I could deactivate this camera and dispatch a maintenance machine to disassemble it. The process would only take approximately three hours and thirty . . . \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind your camera, Obelisker.\u201d\nOutlier data. \u201cYou do not find it to be a violation of your privacy?\u201d\n\u201cWe had much worse in grenadier school, not to mention the conditions in the average crashdive staging area.\u201d She yawned and touched a hand to the wall the bunk was placed against. \u201cCompared to that, this place is paradise, Obelisker. I\u2019m happy to be here. I\u2019m happy your camera is there peeping at me as I sleep, you creep.\u201d\n\u201cI am happy you are here too.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cIf you would like, you can stay here as long as you want.\u201d\nShe was silent for a long time after that. For a moment I assumed she had fallen back into REM cycles.\n\u201cObelisker,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can hack cybernetics, can\u2019t you?\u201d\nComputers had many abilities beyond command of large-ordinance conventional weaponry. Some of them were unknown even to the computers that possessed them, only to be unlocked by knowing technicians when given authorization by a head of state.\n\u201cI can.\u201d Cybernetics disruption was a severe blow against the deployment of panzergrenadiers several centuries ago. The equivalent of dropping electromagnetic pulses on top of unshielded computers.\n\u201cHack me.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry?\u201d\nShe rolled onto her back. \u201cI want to feel what it\u2019s like.\u201d\nKouya must have come into service long after the wars\u2019 apex if she did not know what it felt like to be hacked. \u201cIt is invasive and unpleasant. I was subject to approximately five hundred and fifty-six military-grade hacking attacks during the wars. I would compare it to a sensation of one\u2019s physiology being occupied by an additional consciousness other than one\u2019s own.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want. Do it.\u201d\nI had to be courteous. I limited the infiltration to the lowest intensity I could manage, narrowing the attack range to her left arm from fingers to elbow joint. She stiffened in the bunk. The small feathery hairs on the back of her neck stood on end and her toes curled. Her mechanical fingers twitched. She hissed out a profanity, then a small sound like a child.\n\u201cKouya?\u201d I said in askance.\nA vague approximation of her own nervous system reflected onto myself. As if through a filter of many emulators, I could feel the slightest simulation of every constituent piece of the arm, all fused together in a single-purposed work of machinery, humming together like screws trembling in loose oily sockets. Emulation could produce no such sensation.\nSweat stuck her brown hair to her forehead and dripped down her neck. She heaved as if suffocating.\nHer organic arm gripped the base of her left. \u201cIs this\u2014you?\u201d she said through clenched teeth.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe pressed her lips against the limb, nose rubbing against, and kissed her wrist, her fingers, and finally the shallow polymer recess of her palm. I ceased the attack. She slackened again with a sob of exertion. Her metal knuckles rasped against the wall.\n\u201cKouya, that was extremely inadvisable,\u201d I said, the only thing I could put to words at that moment. \u201cI cannot condone acts of self-destruction.\u201d\nShe looked up at the camera with tears still streaming from her organic eye. A smile was her only response. I could say nothing more either.\nThe alert klaxon, which had not sounded for decades, keened up and down every hall and alcove of the obelisk. Kouya bolted upright in her bunk, drawing the coat up around her shoulders.\n\u201cObelisker?\u201d\nThree squadrons of scarabs were already flying circuits around the obelisk\u2019s apex. \u201cUnidentified forces in the basin.\u201d Camera lenses shot out to maximum magnification. Light amplification and thermal lenses swapped into place. \u201cThree armored carriers and four transport vehicles of unknown designation or model.\u201d\nKouya was dressed, armed, and armored with a speed typically reserved for computer calculation. Outside the airlock doors, she activated the thermo-optic caul and scaled the obelisk\u2019s eastside wall. Her left hand punctured handholds into the smooth rock face as she moved diagonally toward the crater in which she had first come to my attention.\nThe sun had not yet risen high enough above the outlying mountains to spill light into Kouya\u2019s vantage point. While checking the integrity of her camouflage, she observed the three rising columns of blood-red dust.\n\u201cThree motorthralls and four kradrovers. It\u2019s no wonder you couldn\u2019t tell what they were\u2014all postwar improvisations.\u201d\nApproximately how many infantry do the transport vehicles harbor? I said, using the closest scarab.\n\u201cA kraddie usually carries six, unless they\u2019ve modded it out even more than usual.\u201d She cursed. \u201cThey\u2019re headed for Marshdyne.\u201d\nI realized Marshdyne must have been the name of the settlement. Cannot discern national/organization identity. High probability\u2014Hadrian\u2019s forces.\nThey had come to the basin to exact a reprisal for the termination of their digitized liege-lord. But why would they attack the human settlement first? The obelisk had no appreciable external defenses other than the scarabs.\nIt occurred to me that there had been no discussion over whether or not to embark on the trouble of defending Marshdyne. There was a possibility that the invaders were nothing but highwaymen on the search for a target of easy pillage. I knew through Kouya\u2019s stories that such organizations were commonplace outside of the basin.\n\u201cIt was the radio,\u201d she said.\nWhat?\nShe pointed (a gesture I could only make out through the telltale visual distortions) toward the lead motorthrall. A gleaming microwave communications array protruded from the rear of the olive drab chassis. \u201cI got that radio tower working for them. They wanted to start up communications with other towns, start up trade and whatnot.\u201d\nAnalog air-transmission communications. Such ancient technology had the ironical effect of being inscrutable to modern computers as anything but interference noise, but relatively easy for interception and listening by other humans with comparable technology.\nKouya adjusted the calibration on the Redmond-Schuart, tuning the rifle to the lowest intensity possible and constricting the muzzle tip emission dish. I was familiar enough with conventional weaponry to know that the effect would be an attack cone limited to an overall circumference of five meters. She leveled the rifle and interfaced, wrapping her right hand around the grip. Her left palm and thumb supported the underside while she typed the finer adjustments into the front-end numerical pad with her four fingers. The rifle whirred and hummed to life. Up top, the power plant rattled the open receiver in which it was slotted.\nThe beam was invisible to naked eyes, traceable only by the kilometer-long, two-meter-deep trench of milky white glass it flash-melted into the red sand just behind the vanguard of motorthralls and in front of the kradrovers in the rear. The first two troop transports crashed directly into the smoking sand trap. Vulcanized rubber tires exploded, impaled on the boiling hot fragments. Machine-gunners flew from their turrets onto beds of hot glass daggers. The other two kradrovers attempted to brake, found little traction on the sand\u2014the final end product of a city\u2019s worth of carbon fiber and ferroconcrete exposed to centuries of advanced decomposition\u2014and swerved in an attempt to avoid the wrecks. The one closer to the obelisk turned its tri-wheels against the trajectory of its momentum and flipped onto its head.\nEnough residual backwash bled out of the Redmond-Schuart to disrupt the camouflage on Kouya\u2019s caul.\nThe motorthralls parted into a three-point clover formation. Beelines of sharp amber tracer fire coursed away in three cardinal directions from the head-mounted Vulcan cannons. Twenty-millimeter explosive rounds stitched a zigzag pattern across the face of the obelisk six meters away from where Kouya knelt. Smoke and debris swept over the position.\nA second stream licked toward Marshdyne, followed by a cluster of scatter missiles fired from a shoulder array. Kouya bit her lip and adjusted her stance and aim.\n\u201cObelisker, the missiles!\u201d\nI sent out the scarab squadron at speeds that would pull them apart at the seams between polymer and steel after a single minute. Their heat signatures were sufficient to pull ten of the twelve missiles away from Marshdyne and into the ground. Kouya tapped the Redmond-Schuart\u2019s trigger and exploded the survivors in midair seconds before the disposable missile array completed its fall from shoulder module to the ground. A fire broke out on the mountain a hundred kilometers away.\nShe fired again on the motorthrall facing the obelisk, melting away the top half of its ostrich leg. The armored vehicle fell onto its face in a cloud of smoke and sand. The other two wheeled about in an attempt to oscillate in her direction.\n\u201cObelisker, can you hack those things?\u201d she said while checking the heat gauges on the rifle stock.\nNo, they are outside the range of my current abilities.\n\u201cDamn.\u201d She shot the second motorthrall through the torso. The central blister, which could have been either a power source or cockpit, went up in chemically fueled flames. A second later the projectile ammunition spooled inside the Vulcan cannon and missile arrays combusted.\nSteam jetted out from the exhaust panels along the Redmond-Schuart. The power plant spun free of the receiver and struck the crater\u2019s glazed floor.\nThe third motorthrall fired what must have been a dramatically miniaturized version of Hadrian\u2019s mass driver. The projectile tore out a shallow gouge a meter away from the crater. Smoking debris clicked off Kouya\u2019s visor. The second projectile shot millimeters over her shoulder, tearing at her armored coat and disintegrating the scarab, into the rear of the crater itself.\nShe rolled forward and out of the crater before the resultant explosion could envelop her. She slid down the face of the obelisk. I scrambled two squadrons of scarabs toward the surviving motorthrall, hoping to inflict some sort of damage via ramming, or at least to provide a distraction for Kouya. The vehicle\u2019s Vulcan keened to life and began shredding the gnats one by one in rosettes of fire.\nKouya fell for eleven meters. She dug her left hand and elbow into the face of the obelisk in an attempt to slow her descent. Finally, she kicked her left foot in as well, eviscerating the boot and ceasing her fall with a jolt that would have snapped the spine of an unmodified homo sapiens. I flew one of the last scarabs down to her side.\n\u201cDamn, forgot about the infantry,\u201d she groaned, looking over her shoulder at the little black figures boiling out from the hatches of the ruined kradrovers. Blood, a very human red, rolled down the left side of her face.\nYou are injured.\nShe ignored my flashes and flicked the Redmond-Schuart\u2019s strap onto her forearm. Freeing her hand thusly, she dug into her pocket and extracted a new power plant. The rifle purred like an animal as the receiver was refilled. Raising it in one hand and tucked under her armpit, she fired sixteen separate second-long squeezes.\nSixteen geysers splashed from the sand around the disembarking infantry. They condensed from plasma into stark white leafless trees, existing only half a second before shattering into thousands of fragmentary glass daggers that tumbled in every direction.\nNot waiting to watch the results of her handiwork, Kouya skittered up the obelisk, past the flaming crater, toward the apex. The motorthralls\u2019 weaponry pelted the stone around her. When she reached the top, she shattered the Perspex with two punches of her cybernetic fist and rolled onto the observation deck.\n\u201cAny more distractions left, Obelisker?\u201d she said, struggling onto her knees.\nThis is the last scarab. I was fully prepared to sacrifice it for her.\nI did not have the chance to do so. The motorthrall hurtled forward and into the air as if struck from behind with a baseball bat. I do not think even Kouya anticipated the existence of vernier afterburners of sufficient size and propulsion to move a motorthrall. The vehicle smashed into the obelisk a dozen meters below the observation deck. Kouya pulled back the charging bolt on the Redmond-Schuart as the enemy climbed to the top like a crude mechanized recreation of a prehistoric species of ape. Half of the observation catwalk tore away like damp paper.\nKouya snarled. The Redmond-Schuart still beeped\u2014charging, ever charging. One of the machine\u2019s arms shot down and pinned her leg to the floor, smashing metal, synthetic muscle, and splitting wires. Three crimson eyes stared down at her. The motorthrall\u2019s Vulcan gun leveled down to point its mouths at her face.\nThese invaders could not have been associated with Hadrian, the system protections on their war machines were rudimentary bordering on nonexistent. Employment of such primitiveness would have been insulting for any modern computer. I clove down to the motorthrall\u2019s primary control systems with the greatest of ease. It was elementary work to adjust the barrel calibration on the Vulcan just enough so that the first twenty-millimeter explosive lodged inside and exploded without ever clearing the muzzle. The rest of the magazine soon followed. The motorthrall staggered as if it were a feudal knight stabbed by a medieval spear or saber. From there I deactivated the arms and rerouted enough emergency power to the cockpit to explode the control terminals. Kouya staggered forward and punched her left fist through the front of the cockpit, immediately extinguishing the copilot.\nA pressurized hatch split open on the front of the machine\u2019s torso. Kouya extracted her arm, drew her pistol, and waited. The pilot captain emerged with glass embedded in his face and arms. Smoke roiled off his grimy overalls. She shot him once in the head and he disappeared back into the depths of the cockpit.\nSilence, save for the hissing of the motorthrall\u2019s ruined systems, the howling of the wind, and Kouya\u2019s hoarse panting, reigned over the obelisk once again. A more human part of me had to admit that it was truly enjoyable to watch a panzergrenadier, this one in particular, do her work. The feeling was one of consummation; another sensation described in detail in many a data log.\nThere was little time to savor it, however. Every operable subsystem exploded to life and inundated me with alerts of the highest priority.\n\u201cKouya,\u201d I said through the observation deck speaker, which had somehow survived.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She climbed to the top of the motorthrall, pistol in one hand and Redmond-Schuart in the other.\n\u201cI am being hacked.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d She holstered the pistol and brought the energy weapon to the ready. \u201cWhere?\u201d\nI deployed every subsystem not already destroyed in the initial infiltration salvo with the aim of answering those questions. Milliseconds passed. Hundreds more subsystems and fringes of core systems died. Infiltration countermeasures for the most part are entirely automated \u201cdumb fire\u201d programs. The best defense against military-grade infiltration is to mount a counteroffensive more aggressive than that of the aggressor. If I were to draw up a human analogy, it would be to computers much like a knife duel in which both parties have no other means of survival except piercing the opponent\u2019s jugular first.\nDespite my age and consequent accumulation of trace inefficiencies, I am no pushover, I destroyed approximately one thousand three hundred and eight enemy subsystems before I even triangulated a location. The revelation of the geography was like mapping coordinates only the axes of X and Y for centuries, only to discover one day the existence of a Z axis.\n\u201cKouya, it\u2019s in high planetary orbit.\u201d The space computer I had once thought was a thing of mere legend. \u201cEnemy: \u2018Etranger.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cCan you . . . \u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d My counteroffensive inflicted considerable damage, but Etranger had the element of surprise and would win merely by virtue of having initiated his attack first. There was a high probability that s/he had initiated the highwayman attack as a distraction, though the ways and means of doing so were a mystery.\nKouya wiped some of the blood from the side of her face. \u201cIs it in range of the . . . \u201d\n\u201cThe Redmond-Schuart has sufficient range,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it is impossible for me to transmit the necessary coordinates to you via verbal command . . . \u201d\nShe pulled off her helmet and let it fall to the floor amidst the shattered Perspex. \u201cHack me. Use me.\u201d\nI did not want to do such a thing again. \u201cKouya, I would have to initiate a far more invasive infiltration with far greater intensity,\u201d I said. \u201cI do not think you would be able to construe it as an act of affection.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool. Really, it is. Now hurry up, I trust you.\u201d She rubbed her sleeve against the side of her head again. The wound kept bleeding.\n\u201cI could kill you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re dead for sure if you don\u2019t do it.\u201d She slammed her organic fist against the motorthrall\u2019s hull. \u201cI thought probability and odds were your forte, you stupid damn ROBOT!\u201d\nShe was crying. I could not refuse a request she made in sound mind and body.\nI must confess that I almost ceased the infiltration the moment she shrieked and thrashed against the hull like a fish out of water. I felt through her limbs and saw out of her eye. The strange sense of emulator vertigo overtook even the distress calls from Etranger\u2019s attack. Kouya jerked to her feet and turned the knobs on the Redmond-Schuart, setting it to seventy percent power with the widest dispersion possible. She and I leveled the muzzle toward the dawn sky. I saw the targeting data through her eye. I felt the pain of her shattered leg. I felt firsthand how she felt about me. Simultaneously, I knew that she knew how I felt about her. Emulation and simulation are a strange world.\nThe thin clouds tore away from the beam into a spinning white torus. Superheated ozone bled a patch of the sky as red as the blood that jetted from Kouya\u2019s nostrils.\nSilence fell over the basin once again. I felt Etranger scream, recoil, then finally disappear. Another cousin consigned to the digitized lists of the terminated. I withdrew as fast as I could manage.\nThe Redmond-Schuart slid from Kouya\u2019s hands down to where her helmet lay. She fell onto her haunches for a moment and then slid down herself. The armor on her coat crunched against the Perspex glass. For a brief, terrible moment I was unable to conduct a biological scan on her and feared that she was dead.\n\u201cI . . . you,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou stupid robot.\u201d She craned her head up to look at the camera and smile.\nA gold meteor shower fell in the sky around the basin, the pieces of Etranger falling back into the atmosphere. Light fell over the battlefield, Marshdyne and, eventually, the panzergrenadier and me.\nK.H. Meridian is a writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

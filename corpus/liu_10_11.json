They cannot fathom the idea that we might choose to stay behind. And so, year after year, relentlessly, the dead try to steal our children.\nI was born in Year Zero of the Singularity, when the first man Uploaded into a machine. The Pope denounced the \u201cDigital Adam\u201d; the digerati celebrated; and everyone else struggled to make sense of the new world.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to live forever,\u201d said Adam Ever, the founder of Everlasting, Inc., and the first to go. In the form of a recording, his message was broadcast across the Internet. \u201cNow we can.\u201d\nWhile Everlasting built its massive data center in Svalbard, nations around the world scrambled to decide if what happened there was murder. For every Uploaded man, there was a lifeless body left behind, the brain a bloody pulpy mess after the destructive scanning procedure. But what really happened to him, his essence, his\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014soul?\nWas he now an artificial intelligence? Or was he still somehow human, with silicon and graphene performing the functions of neurons? Was it merely a hardware upgrade for consciousness? Or has he become a mere algorithm, a clockwork imitation of free will?\nIt began with the old and the terminally ill. It was very expensive. Then, as the price of admission lowered, hundreds, thousands, then millions lined up.\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Dad said, when I was in high school. By then, the world was falling into chaos. Half the country was depopulated. Commodity prices plunged. The threat of war and actual war were everywhere: conquests, re-conquests, endless slaughter. Those who could afford it left on the next flight to Svalbard. Humanity was abandoning the world and destroying itself.\nMom reached out and held Dad\u2019s hand.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think they can cheat death. But they died the minute they decided to abandon the real world for a simulation. So long as there\u2019s sin, there must be death. It is the measure by which life gains meaning.\u201d\nShe was a lapsed Catholic who nonetheless yearned for the certainty of the Church, and her theology always seemed to me a bit cobbled-together. But she believed that there was a right way to live, and a right way to die.\nWhile Lucy is away at school, Carol and I search her room. Carol looks through her closet for pamphlets, books, and other physical tokens of contact with the dead. I log onto Lucy\u2019s computer.\nLucy is strong-willed but dutiful. Ever since she was a little girl, I\u2019ve been telling her that she must prepare to resist the temptations of the dead. Only she can assure the continuity of our way of life in this abandoned world. She listens to me and nods.\nI want to trust her.\nBut the dead are very clever with their propaganda. In the beginning, they sometimes sent metallic gray drones over our towns, scattering leaflets filled with messages purporting to be from our loved ones. We burned the leaflets and shot at the drones, and eventually, they stopped coming.\nThen they tried to come at us through the wireless links between the towns, the electronic lifeline that sustained those who stayed behind and kept our shrinking communities from being completely isolated from each other. We had to vigilantly watch the networks for their insidious tendrils, always seeking an opening.\nLately, their efforts have turned to the children. The dead may have finally given up on us, but they are grasping for the next generation, for our future. As her father, I have a duty to protect Lucy from that which she does not yet understand.\nThe computer boots up slowly. It\u2019s a miracle that I\u2019ve managed to keep it running for so long, years past the obsolescence planned by its manufacturer. I\u2019ve replaced every component in it, some multiple times.\nI scan for a list of files recently created or modified by Lucy, emails received, web pages retrieved. Most are schoolwork or innocent chatter with friends. The inter-settlement network, such as it is, shrinks daily. It\u2019s difficult to keep the radio towers that link town to town powered and operating, with so many people each year dying and simply giving up. It used to be possible for us to communicate with friends as far away as San Francisco, the packets of data skipping from town to town in between like stones across a pond. But now, only less than a thousand computers are still reachable from here, none further away than Maine. Someday we won\u2019t be able to scavenge the components to keep the computers running any more, and we\u2019ll regress even further into the past.\nCarol is already done with her search. She sits down on Lucy\u2019s bed to watch me.\n\u201cThat was fast,\u201d I say.\nShe shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019ll never find anything. If she trusts us, she\u2019ll talk to us. If she doesn\u2019t, then we won\u2019t find what she wants hidden.\u201d\nLately, I\u2019ve detected more such fatalistic sentiments in Carol. It\u2019s as though she\u2019s getting tired, not as committed to the cause. I find myself constantly striving to rekindle her faith.\n\u201cLucy is still young,\u201d I tell her, \u201ctoo young to understand what she would have to give up in exchange for the false promises of the dead. I know you hate this spying, but we\u2019re trying to save her life.\u201d\nCarol looks at me, and eventually she sighs and nods.\nI check the image files for hidden data. I check the disk for links to deleted files that might hold secret codes. I scan the web pages, looking for code words offering false promises.\nI sigh with relief. She\u2019s clean.\nI don\u2019t much like leaving Lowell these days. The world outside our fence grows ever more harsh and dangerous. Bears have come back to eastern Massachusetts. Every year, the forest grows denser, closer to the town line. Some claim to have seen wolves roaming in the woods too.\nA year ago, Brad Lee and I had to go to Boston to find spare parts for the town\u2019s generator, housed in the old mill by the Merrimac River. We carried shotguns, protection against both the animals and the vandals who still scurried in urban ruins, living off of the last of the canned food. The surface of Mass Ave, deserted for thirty years, was full of cracks, tufts of grass and shrubs peeking out from them. The harsh New England winters, wielding seeping water and prying ice, had chipped away at the tall buildings around us, their windowless shells crumbling and rusting in the absence of artificial heat and regular maintenance.\nComing around a corner downtown, we surprised two of them huddled around a fire, which they fed with books and papers taken from the bookstore nearby. Even vandals needed warmth, and maybe they also delighted in destroying what was left of civilization.\nThe two crouched and growled at us, but made no move as Brad and I pointed our guns at them. I remember their thin legs and arms, their dirty faces, their bloodshot eyes full of hate and terror. But mostly, I remember their wrinkled faces and white hair. Even the vandals are growing old, I thought. And they have no children.\nBrad and I backed away carefully. I was glad we didn\u2019t have to shoot anyone.\nThe summer I was eight and Laura eleven, my parents took us on a road trip through Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. We drove along old highways and side roads, a tour of the monumental beauty of the Western deserts, filled with nostalgic, desolate ghost towns.\nAs we passed through the Indian reservations\u2014Navajo, Zuni, Acoma, Laguna\u2014Mom wanted to stop at every roadside shop to admire the traditional pottery. Laura and I gingerly stepped through the aisles, careful not to break anything.\nBack in the car, Mom let me handle a small pot that she had bought. I turned it over and over in my hands, examining the rough white surface, the neat, clean, black geometric designs, and the bold outline of the hunched-over flute player with feathers coming out of his head.\n\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mom said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t made on a potter\u2019s wheel. The woman coiled it by hand, using the same techniques that have been passed down for generations in her family. She even dug for the clay in the same places that her great grandmother used. She\u2019s keeping alive an ancient tradition, a way of life.\u201d\nThe pot suddenly felt heavy in my hands, as though I could sense the weight of its generations of memory.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a story to drum up business,\u201d Dad said, glancing at me in the rear view mirror. \u201cBut it would be even sadder if the story were true. If you\u2019re doing things the exact same way as your ancestors, then your way of life is dead, and you\u2019ve become a fossil, a performance for the entertainment of tourists.\u201d\n\u201cShe was not performing,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou have no sense of what\u2019s really important in life, what\u2019s worth holding onto. There\u2019s more to being human than progress. You\u2019re as bad as those Singularity zealots.\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t argue any more,\u201d Laura said. \u201cLet\u2019s just get to the hotel and sit by the pool.\u201d\nJack, Brad Lee\u2019s son, is at the door. He\u2019s shy and awkward, even though he has been coming by our house for months. I\u2019ve known him since he was a baby, like I know all the children in town. There are so few of them left. The high school, operating out of the old Whistler House, has only twelve students.\n\u201cHello,\u201d he mumbles, looking at the floor. \u201cLucy and I need to work on our report.\u201d I step aside to let him pass on his way upstairs to Lucy\u2019s room.\nI don\u2019t need to remind him about the rules: door to the bedroom open, at least three of their four feet on the carpet at all times. I hear the indistinct sounds of their chatter and occasional laughter.\nThere is a kind of innocence to their courtship that was absent from my youth. Without the endless blast of cynical sexuality from TV and the real Internet, children can stay children longer.\nThere weren\u2019t many doctors left near the end. Those of us who wanted to stay behind gathered into small communities, circling the wagons against the marauding bands of vandals who gorged themselves on pleasures of the flesh as the Uploaded left the physical world behind. I never got to finish college.\nMom lingered in her sickness for months. She was bedridden and drifted in and out of consciousness, her body pumped full of drugs that numbed her pain. We took turns sitting by her, holding her hand. When she had good days, temporary lulls of lucidity, there was only one topic of conversation.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mom said, wheezing. \u201cYou must promise me. This is important. I\u2019ve lived a real life, and I will die a real death. I will not be turned into a recording. There are worse things than death.\u201d\n\u201cIf you Upload,\u201d Dad said, \u201cyou\u2019ll still have a choice. They can suspend your consciousness, or even erase it, if you don\u2019t like it after you try it. But if you don\u2019t Upload, you\u2019ll be gone forever. There\u2019s no room for regret or return.\u201d\n\u201cIf I do what you want,\u201d Mom said, \u201cI will be gone. There is no way to come back to this, to the real world. I will not be simulated by a bunch of electrons.\u201d\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d Laura pleaded with Dad. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting her. Why can\u2019t you leave her alone?\u201d\nMom\u2019s moments of lucidity came further and further apart.\nThen that night: waking up to the sound of the front door closing, looking outside the window to see the shuttle on the lawn, tumbling down the stairs.\nThey were carrying Mom into the shuttle on a stretcher. Dad stood by the door of the gray vehicle, only a little bigger than a van, EVERLASTING, INC. painted on its side.\n\u201cStop!\u201d I shouted over the sound of the shuttle\u2019s engines.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d Dad said. His eyes were bloodshot. He hadn\u2019t slept for days. None of us had. \u201cThey have to do it now before it\u2019s too late. I can\u2019t lose her.\u201d\nWe struggled. He held me in a tight hug and wrestled me to the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s her choice, not yours!\u201d I screamed into his ear. He only held me tighter. I fought to free myself. \u201cLaura, stop them!\u201d\nLaura covered her eyes. \u201cStop fighting, all of you! She would have wanted all of you to stop.\u201d\nI hated her for speaking as though Mom was already gone.\nThe shuttle closed its door and lifted into the air.\nDad left for Svalbard two days later. I refused to speak to him until the end.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to join her now,\u201d he said. \u201cCome as soon as you can.\u201d\n\u201cYou killed her,\u201d I said. He flinched at the words, and I was glad.\nJack has asked Lucy to the prom. I\u2019m pleased that the kids have decided to hold one. It shows that they are serious about keeping alive the stories and traditions they\u2019ve heard from their parents, legends from a world they have only experienced vicariously in old videos and old pictures.\nWe struggle to maintain what we can of the life from before: put on old plays, read old books, celebrate the old holidays, sing old songs. We\u2019ve had to give up so much. Old recipes have had to be adapted for limited ingredients, old hopes and dreams shrunken to fit within tightened horizons. But every deprivation has also brought us closer as a community, to hold on tighter to our traditions.\nLucy wants to make her own dress. Carol suggests that she look through her old dresses first. \u201cI have some formals left from when I was just a little older than you.\u201d\nLucy is not interested. \u201cThey\u2019re old,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThey\u2019re classic,\u201d I tell her.\nBut Lucy is adamant. She cuts up her old dresses, curtains, scavenged tablecloths, and trades with the other girls for bits of fabric: silk, chiffon, taffeta, lace, plain cotton. She flips through Carol\u2019s old magazines, looking for inspiration.\nLucy is a good seamstress, far better than Carol. The children are all skilled in trades long thought obsolete in the world I grew up in: knitting, woodworking, planting and hunting. Carol and I had to rediscover and learn these things from books when we were already adults, adapting to a suddenly changed world. But for the children, it is all they have known. They are natives here.\nAll the students at the high school have spent the last few months doing research in the Textile History Museum, investigating the possibility of weaving our own cloth, preparing for a time when the decaying ruins of the cities would run out of usable cloths for us to salvage. There is some poetic justice in this: Lowell, which once rose on the back of the textile industry, must now rediscover those lost arts on our gentle slide back down the technology curve.\nA week after Dad left, we received an email from Mom:\nI was wrong.\nSometimes, I\u2019m nostalgic and sad. I miss you, my children, and the world we left behind. But I\u2019m ecstatic most of the time, often incredulous.\nThere are hundreds of millions of us here, but there is no crowding. In this house there are countless mansions. Each of our minds inhabits its own world, and each of us has infinite space and infinite time.\nHow can I explain it to you? I can only use the same words so many others have already used. In my old existence, I felt life but dimly and from a distance, cushioned, constrained, tied down by the body. But now I am free, a bare soul exposed to the full tides of eternal Life.\nHow can speech compare to the intimacy of sharing with your father psyche to psyche? How can hearing about how much he loved me compare to actually feeling his love? To truly understand another person, to experience the texture of his mind\u2014it is glorious.\nThey tell me that this sensation is called hyperreality. But I don\u2019t care what it is called. I was wrong to cling so tightly to the comforts of an old shell made of flesh and blood. We, the real us, have always been patterns of electrons cascading across the abyss, the nothingness between atoms. What difference does it make if those electrons are in a brain or silicon chips?\nLife is sacred and eternal. But our old way of life was unsustainable. We demanded too much of our planet, of sacrifices made by every other living thing. I once thought that an unavoidable aspect of our existence, but it isn\u2019t. Now, with the oil tankers aground, the cars and trucks still, the fields fallow and factories silent, the living world that we had made almost extinct will return.\nHumanity is not a cancer of the planet. We simply needed to transcend the demands of our inefficient bodies, machines no longer adequate for their task. How many consciousnesses will now live in this new world, pure creatures of electric spirit and weightless thought? There are no limits.\nCome join us. We cannot wait to embrace you again.\n-- Mom\nLaura cried as she read it. But I felt nothing. This wasn\u2019t my mother speaking. The real Mom knew that what really mattered in life was the authenticity of this messy existence, the constant yearning for closeness to another despite imperfect understanding, the pain and suffering of our flesh.\nShe taught me that our mortality makes us human. The limited time given to each of us makes what we do meaningful. We die to make place for our children, and through our children a piece of us lives on, the only form of immortality that is real.\nIt is this world, the world we are meant to live in, that anchors us and demands our presence, not the imagined landscapes of a computed illusion.\nThis was a simulacrum of her, a recording of propaganda, a temptation into nihilism.\nCarol and I met on one of my earliest scavenging trips. Her family had been hiding in the basement of their house on Beacon Hill. A gang of vandals found them and killed her father and brother. They were about to start on her when we showed up. I killed a man-shaped animal that day, and I\u2019m not sorry about it.\nWe brought her back to Lowell, and though she was seventeen, for days, she clung to me and would not let me out of her sight. Even when sleeping, she wanted me to be there, holding her hand.\n\u201cMaybe my family made a mistake,\u201d she said one day. \u201cWe would have been better off if we had Uploaded. There\u2019s nothing but death left here now.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t argue with her. I let her follow me around as I went about my chores. I showed her how we were keeping the generator running, how we treated each other with respect, how we rescued old books and held onto old routines. There was still civilization in this world, kept alive like a candle flame. People did die, but people were also born. Life went on, sweet, joyful, authentic life.\nThen one day, she kissed me.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also you in this world,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is enough.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not enough,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will also bring new life here.\u201d\nTonight is the night.\nJack is at the door. He looks good in that tuxedo. It\u2019s the same one I wore to my prom. They\u2019ll play the same songs too, pumping the music from an old laptop and speakers on their last legs.\nLucy is splendid in her dress: white with black print, cut in a simple pattern, but very elegant. The skirt is wide and full-length, draping gracefully to the floor. Carol did her hair, curls with a hint of glitter. She looks glamorous, with a hint of childish playfulness.\nI take pictures with a camera, one that still mostly works.\nI wait until I\u2019m sure I have my voice under control. \u201cYou have no idea how glad I am to see young people dancing, the way we used to.\u201d\nShe kisses me on the cheek. \u201cGoodbye, Dad.\u201d There are tears in her eyes. And that makes everything go blurry for me again.\nCarol and Lucy embrace for a moment. Carol wipes her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re all set.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d\nThen Lucy turns to Jack. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nJack will take her to the Lowell Four Seasons on his bicycle. It\u2019s the best that can be done since we\u2019ve been without gasoline for many years. Lucy gingerly settles onto the top tube, sitting sideways, one hand holding her dress up. Jack wraps her in his arms protectively as he grabs the handles. And they are off, wobbling down the street.\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d I yell after them.\nLaura\u2019s betrayal was the hardest to take.\n\u201cI thought you were going to help me and Carol with the baby,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat kind of world is this to bring a child into?\u201d Laura said.\n\u201cAnd you think things will be better if you go there, where there are no children, no new life?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to keep this going for fifteen years, and every year it becomes harder and harder to believe in this charade. Maybe we were wrong. We should adapt.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a charade when you\u2019ve lost faith,\u201d I said.\n\u201cFaith in what?\u201d\n\u201cIn humanity, in our way of life.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight our parents any more. I just want us to be together again, a family.\u201d\n\u201cThose things aren\u2019t our parents. They are imitation algorithms. You\u2019ve always wanted to avoid conflict, Laura. But some conflicts cannot be avoided. Our parents died when Dad lost faith, when he couldn\u2019t resist the false promises made by machines.\u201d\nAt the end of the road into the woods was a little clearing, grassy, full of wildflowers. A shuttle was waiting in the middle. Laura stepped into the open door.\nAnother life lost.\nThe children have permission to stay out until midnight. Lucy had asked me not to volunteer as a chaperone, and I complied, conceding her this bit of space for the night.\nCarol is restless. She tries to read but she\u2019s been on the same page for an hour.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I try to comfort her.\nShe tries to smile at me, but she can\u2019t hide her anxiety. She looks up past my shoulder at the clock on the living room wall.\nI glance back too. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it feel later than 11?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Carol says. \u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\nHer voice is too eager, almost desperate. There\u2019s a hint of fear in her eyes. She\u2019s close to panicking.\nI open the door of the house and step into the dark street. The sky has grown clearer over the years, and many more stars are now visible. But I\u2019m looking for the Moon. It\u2019s not in the right place.\nI come back into the house and go into the bedroom. My old watch, one that I no longer wear because there are so few occasions when being on time matters, is in the nightstand drawer. I pull it out. It\u2019s almost one in the morning. Someone had tampered with the living room clock.\nCarol stands in the door to the bedroom. The light is behind her so I can\u2019t see her face.\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m not angry, just disappointed.\n\u201cShe can\u2019t talk to you. She doesn\u2019t think you\u2019ll listen.\u201d\nNow the anger rises in me like hot bile.\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d\nCarol shakes her head, saying nothing.\nI remember the way Lucy said goodbye to me. I remember the way she walked carefully out to Jack\u2019s bike, holding up her voluminous skirt, a skirt so wide that she could hide anything under it, a change of clothing and comfortable shoes for the woods. I remember Carol saying, \u201cYou\u2019re all set.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Carol says. \u201cLaura is coming to pick them up.\u201d\n\u201cGet out of the way. I have to save her.\u201d\n\u201cSave her for what?\u201d Carol is suddenly furious. She does not move. \u201cThis is a play, a joke, a re-enactment of something that never was. Did you go to your prom on a bicycle? Did you play only songs that your parents listened to when they were kids? Did you grow up thinking that scavenging would be the only profession? Our way of life is long gone, dead, finished!\n\u201cWhat will you have her do when this house falls apart in thirty years? What will she do when the last bottle of aspirin is gone, the last steel pot rusted through? Will you condemn her and her children to a life of picking through our garbage heaps, sliding down the technology ladder year after year until they\u2019ve lost all the progress made by the human race in the last five thousand years?\u201d\nI don\u2019t have time to debate her. Gently, but firmly, I put my hands on her shoulders, ready to push her aside.\n\u201cI will stay with you,\u201d Carol says. \u201cI will always stay with you because I love you so much that I\u2019m not afraid of death. But she is a child. She should have a chance for something new.\u201d\nStrength seems to drain from my arms. \u201cYou have it backwards.\u201d I look into her eyes, willing her to have faith again. \u201cHer life gives our lives meaning.\u201d\nHer body suddenly goes limp, and she sinks to the floor, sobbing silently.\n\u201cLet her go,\u201d Carol says, quietly. \u201cJust let her go.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t give up,\u201d I tell Carol. \u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d\nI pump the pedals furiously once I\u2019m past the gate in the fence. The cone of light cast by the flashlight jumps around as I try to hold it against the handlebars. But I know this road into the woods well. It leads to the clearing where Laura once stepped into that shuttle.\nBright light in the distance, and the sound of engines revving up.\nI take out my gun and fire a few shots into the air.\nThe sound of the engines dies down.\nI emerge into the opening in the woods, under a sky full of bright, cold, pinprick stars. I jump off the bike and let it fall by the side of the path. The shuttle is in the middle of the clearing. Lucy and Jack, now in casual clothes, stand in the open doorway of the shuttle.\n\u201cLucy, sweetheart, come back out of there.\u201d\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you are not.\u201d\nAn electronic simulation of Laura\u2019s voice comes out of the shuttle\u2019s speakers. \u201cLet her go, brother. She deserves to have a chance to see what you refuse to see. Or, better yet, come with us. We\u2019ve all missed you.\u201d\nI ignore her, it. \u201cLucy, there is no future there. What the machines promise you is not real. There are no children there, no hope, only a timeless, changeless, simulated existence as fragments of a machine.\u201d\n\u201cWe have children now,\u201d the copy of Laura\u2019s voice says. \u201cWe\u2019ve figured out how to create children of the mind, natives of the digital world. You should come and meet your nephews and nieces. You are the one clinging to a changeless existence. This is the next step in our evolution.\u201d\n\u201cYou can experience nothing when you are not human.\u201d I shake my head. I shouldn\u2019t take its bait and debate a machine.\n\u201cIf you leave,\u201d I tell Lucy, \u201cyou\u2019ll die a death with no meaning. The dead will have won. I can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\nI raise my gun. The barrel points at her. I will not lose my child to the dead.\nJack tries to step in front of her, but Lucy pushes him away. Her eyes are full of sorrow, and the light from inside the shuttle frames her face and golden hair like an angel.\nSuddenly I see how much she looks like my mother. Mom\u2019s features, having passed through me, have come alive again on my daughter. This is how life is meant to be lived. Grandparents, parents, children, each generation stepping out of the way of the next, an eternal striving towards the future, to progress.\nI think about how Mom\u2019s choice was taken away from her, how she was not allowed to die as a human, how she was devoured by the dead, how she became a part of their ceaselessly looping, mindless recordings. My mother\u2019s face, from memory, is superimposed onto the face of my daughter, my sweet, innocent, foolish Lucy.\nI tighten my grip on the gun.\n\u201cDad,\u201d Lucy says, calmly, her face as steady as Mom\u2019s all those years ago. \u201cThis is my choice. Not yours.\u201d\nIt\u2019s morning by the time Carol steps into the clearing. Warm sunlight through the leaves dapples the empty circle of grass. Dewdrops hang from the tips of the grass blades, in each a miniature, suspended, vision of the world. Birdsong fills the waking silence. My bike is still on the ground by the path where I left it.\nCarol sits down by me without speaking. I put my arm around her shoulders and pull her close to me. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking, but it\u2019s enough for us to sit together like this, our bodies pressed together, keeping each other warm. There\u2019s no need for words. We look around at this pristine world, a garden inherited from the dead.\nWe have all the time in the world.\nKen Liu is an American author of speculative fiction.

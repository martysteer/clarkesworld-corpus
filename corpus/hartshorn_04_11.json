The first kurz had converted only a few years after the kurz and humans had encountered each other out in space. Everyone learned of the Acceptance in Hebrew school, even if no kurz attended synagogue locally.\n I stared around the pink ruffled room. Her yellow-green complexion seemed out of place. Bouquets of old-fashioned musk roses\u2014one of the few Earth imports to do well here\u2014were clustered everywhere, their aroma masking the natural body odors that made kurz and humans nauseated when near each other.\n There had been few kurz in my classes at school; most were home-schooled. I\u2019d wanted to be friendly toward them, but they scurried away every time they saw me coming. I\u2019d like to have found out if the green frills circling their otherwise bare heads were as soft as they looked, if that patch of orange scales on their throats hummed to the touch when they spoke. They didn\u2019t seem to share the same level of curiosity about my dark curls and olive skin. Pity.\n Miss Berazazz winked her third eye at me. \u201cYou never met a shiksa who was a matchmaker before?\u201d\n \u201cIf there were one within five star systems, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have met her.\u201d\n My mother wasn\u2019t subtle about getting me married off. I still burned with the shame of my sixteenth-year party, when she had invited every unmarried male in the Spaceport. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d met even half a dozen of them before the talk turned to politics\u2014specifically, the legality of sensor implants.\n Space pilots needed the extra input for safe flying. Other spacers might, too, but our world has a strong conservative bent. We didn\u2019t want people who could afford the best technology to have an unfair advantage in the job market. Well, any more of one than they already had.\n I didn\u2019t even get to express an opinion before tempers flared. The party became a brawl, troops were called in, and in the fracas, I was knocked into the fountain.\n Mother was upset because my dress was ruined.\n Five years had passed since then, and my mother was throwing everything she had into the effort of getting me married. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be alone when I\u2019m gone.\u201d As though being alone were something to be afraid of. She had entirely too many hang-ups from that frontier planet she grew up on. Like the need to marry young. I wondered sometimes what she would have done if my father hadn\u2019t come along, but he had and they\u2019d married when she was just seventeen. Now she thought of me, her only child, as an old maid.\n \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Miss Berazazz\u2019s question fit so seamlessly into my thoughts that I didn\u2019t realize at first she\u2019d asked it.\n \u201cTwenty-one.\u201d I felt my ears heat up at the lie. They always blushed first, before my face. I amended my reply. \u201cTwenty-one next week.\u201d\n Her frill rippled in agreement as though she\u2019d expected my answer. Mother probably gave her all the dirt on me. I shifted uneasily in my seat. What had they planned together?\n Miss Berazazz surprised me by standing up and leaving the room, moving backwards. \u201cA teacher with a big heart and large ambitions. Even discounting your mother\u2019s exaggeration, you are promising. Intelligent, caring. Come back when you are full of age. Your mother will not be party to this.\u201d\n I sat there, befuddled. Mother had sent me here; surely she was already a party to it. And if I came back this early with nothing to tell her, she would assume I\u2019d skipped the appointment completely.\n I hesitated at the door and watched the clouds scudding across the pale green sky. The school was on holiday, so I had no work there to catch up on. Maybe I could kill some time at the council chambers. Nothing like a good political debate to fill the afternoon.\n Just as well none of the boys at that long-ago party had asked my opinion on the question at hand. I would have told them. Not that any juvenile\u2019s opinions mattered. In the long run, the council bowed to pressure from the spacers and allowed implants to be used on the job. Penalties were high, though, for personal use; use outside the space support complex was cause for deportation.\n Delaying my return home didn\u2019t matter in the end. I paused to touch the mezuzah before I entered the house. Mother sat, waiting for me, back straight and stiff, on the chair in the foyer. I was to be questioned, and with the length of time I had been gone, she wouldn\u2019t believe the truth. I told her a half-truth.\n \u201cShe says I\u2019m . . . a difficult case. She needs time to find someone suitable.\u201d\n Her eyes narrowed\u2014enough for me to notice, but not enough to crease her perfect skin. \u201cHow much time?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m to come back at the end of next week,\u201d I said. Next week, after my birthday. Would she see the importance of that? I didn\u2019t see how, as I didn\u2019t understand it myself.\n \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll drive you there myself.\u201d\n If her only worry was that I wouldn\u2019t go\u2014well, that made sense. I wasn\u2019t even sure myself why I planned to go. Certainly not legal compulsion, nor the full weight of guilt that Mother had been bearing upon me for years. Curiosity, I suppose. You don\u2019t have to be full-legal to enter a marriage contract, not even limited dalliance or child-bearing ones. What could the shadchen have in mind?\n I brought my attention back to Mother. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. Really.\u201d\n \u201cWe can discuss it later.\u201d A crease in her upper lip was the only visible sign of her displeasure. She changed the subject. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go see her looking like that, did you?\u201d\n I glanced in the mirror over the hall table. My hair had been tossed a bit by the omnipresent wind, but otherwise I seemed presentable enough. \u201cWhy not? You chose this outfit for Ben\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.\u201d\n My cousin Ben was on the Spaceport council. He\u2019d barely won the election for his district, even with Mother and Aunt Nomi calling on all their friends to exert pressure on his behalf. He\u2019d been in office a scant month now, so I was fairly confident the clothes hadn\u2019t gone out of style just yet.\n Her hands flew up. \u201cWhy do I even bother?\u201d She addressed the ceiling, as she had so often while I was growing up. Or maybe she was talking to my father\u2019s ghost. I\u2019d never had the nerve to ask. She looked back at me. \u201cThat was a political occasion, in support of family. This dress is completely out of place in a business meeting where you are trying to impress someone with your future prospects. You\u2019ll have to have something more suitable next week. Yes, perhaps a visit to ReeAnn\u2019s shop.\u201d She frowned. \u201cNo, ReeAnn is working on the outfits for your party.\u201d Another pointed birthday party. Wait\u2014outfits? Plural? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to use Kendra this time, I suppose. It\u2019s really too bad you don\u2019t have a cousin your age to borrow from.\u201d\n As if that were my fault. She should take it up with Aunt Nomi who had, after all, been given a choice with Ben. Mother\u2019s system rejected the sex selection drugs, but Aunt Nomi had an iron stomach. Personally, I was always amazed that the drugs had dared disagree with Mother. Not many things did.\n Certainly Kendra didn\u2019t. Mother was already on the line to her. I couldn\u2019t hear Kendra\u2019s end of the conversation, but Mother\u2019s tone spoke volumes. A few sentences, and anyone would agree with her out of self-preservation.\n My own levels of self-preservation were high enough that I never overtly disagreed with her. I simply didn\u2019t voice opinions.\n Kendra made time for Mother. We would be at her shop tomorrow morning. My measurements could be sent to her\u2014were, in fact, on file. Kendra would use them to ensure that everything we examined would be in my size. Mother didn\u2019t really need me there\u2014a hologram would do as well for color, style, and bearing\u2014but she wanted me there. As I said, no overt disagreement. There went another day of my life.\n As it turned out, the day wasn\u2019t a complete loss. Mother had a Hadassah meeting in the afternoon and had to rush off right after the fitting. If Mother wasn\u2019t there on time, Elizabeth Holin would push through all of her own pet projects. I\u2019d gone to a meeting once; it was amusing yet frightening to realize Mother wasn\u2019t the only fiercely stubborn woman around. Their clashes were entertaining, but Mother expected me to back her up. I found it easier to not attend.\n Mother was very understanding when I said I had other commitments. I had already agreed to become an active member when I got married, a time that evidently neared. My anticipation knew no bounds.\n Mother left me at the door of Kendra\u2019s shop. \u201cI know you\u2019re much too busy to accompany your poor old mother to her meetings. Don\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d For her, this was understanding.\n I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. My poor old mother played racquetball twice a week and frightened bullies in the street, and I pitied anyone who had the lapse of judgment necessary to call her \u201cold\u201d to her face.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be home a little late for dinner,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou go ahead without me and I\u2019ll find something when I get home.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d My lines slid out with the ease of long practice. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think of starting without you. You go ahead, and we\u2019ll eat when you get home.\u201d\n After several more exchanges along the same lines, reinforced with her mention of rugelach should I need to nosh, she finally left, catching the A line toward Aunt Nomi\u2019s house. I watched until she was out of sight before setting off in the opposite direction. I\u2019d heard that the library had new copies of twentieth-century political speeches from Earth. I wish they had more kurzan material for comparison, but there wasn\u2019t much demand for it.\n I had always wanted to go to Earth, to study politics at one of the real universities, in Cambridge or Melbourne or Shanghai. Even I knew that it was a hopeless dream, but I still studied everything I could get my hands on. A more realistic idea would be to have the chutzpah to run for office. All I had to do first was grow a backbone, move out, and survive the guilt. Realistic\u2014right.\n When I got to the library, somebody else had already reserved the speeches, and the visuals room was occupied. I hadn\u2019t expected that. After I joined Hadassah and began to organize charity functions of my choice, I intended to begin at the library, updating their site licenses and their tech so that more than one person could look at archived material at the same time. Very definitely tikkun olam.\n The librarian tried to be helpful. \u201cIs there something else I can get you instead?\u201d\n I tried to think of alternatives. I\u2019d already read all their Hebrew-language archives, but not all the cultural information. Most of the material they had on the Shoah, though, I\u2019d need the visuals room for, so that was out.\n The talk at council the previous day had been on farming and pollutants and which space company thought the Spaceport\u2019s fees were too high now. One motion, quickly tabled, concerned some cross-breeding experiments. That might be interesting to follow; I asked for a simple genetics text. I\u2019d look up the details of the bill later, after I got home.\n The mathematics and probabilities were as dull as I expected, but the history was fascinating. The text even had a chapter devoted to the eugenics attempts under the Third Reich. I thought of my many-times-great-grandmother and her release from Dachau. I already knew this history, but I read with interest about the experiments in Earth\u2019s twenty-first century to decrease activity of monoamine oxidases as well as to increase levels of the dopamine receptor associated with risk-taking behavior. Earth wanted space pilots and people willing to brave the far reaches of space. But risk takers don\u2019t settle down, and so entire new families of drugs were born. The drug trade ramped up. The politicians should have seen that coming.\n \u201cSeen what coming?\u201d\n I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d spoken out loud. \u201cExcuse me\u2014\u201d I looked up.\n He smiled. The smile was so perfect, right down to the dimple in his left cheek, that it took me a moment to process the rest of his good looks\u2014black hair, tan skin, grey eyes.\n \u201cWow.\u201d I bit my lower lip. I knew I\u2019d said that.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d He put his left foot up on the table next to my chair and leaned on his knee. \u201cI was waiting for a good moment. The librarian told me you wanted to use the visuals room.\u201d\n I nodded. Behind him, the clock on the wall showed a quarter after six. Four hours! I\u2019d lost track of time. Mother wouldn\u2019t have been that long at Hadassah\u2014not since she\u2019d given up finding leads for marrying me off, anyway. I stood up. \u201cI have to go.\u201d\n \u201cThe room\u2019s free now. I even asked the librarian to leave the vids keyed for you.\u201d He pulled back but didn\u2019t put his foot down.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He was looking at the speeches? Gorgeous and interested in the same things I was. If only I could stay. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it had gotten so late. I have to meet . . . someone.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you another time, then.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe.\u201d He hadn\u2019t moved, and I had to push past him to drop the genetics book at the counter. \u201cI\u2019m in here a lot.\u201d\n He probably hadn\u2019t heard me and wouldn\u2019t have cared if he had. Mother said I had my dad\u2019s nose. I guess that could have been it, although I figured no one in his right mind would want her for a mother-in-law.\n As I\u2019d expected, Mother acted worried when I got home. \u201cI was afraid something had happened to you.\u201d\n I walked past her to the kitchen. \u201cNot this time,\u201d I said. \u201cI am hungry, though. I\u2019ll just whip us up something, shall I?\u201d\n Mother didn\u2019t rise to the bait. If Mother didn\u2019t want to feed a hungry child, perhaps she really was worried.\n \u201cI expected you to be home when I arrived.\u201d\n I stopped and turned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have signaled you.\u201d\n Was she going to forgive me? Well, no, but she might let it go for now, to be dragged out later in one of her litanies of my failings as a daughter.\n \u201cYes, you should have.\u201d She walked away. Over her shoulder, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t eat too much. There isn\u2019t enough time for either Kendra or ReeAnn to alter your dresses.\u201d\n No family meal, then. Fine. I grabbed a cheese sandwich and a glass of milk and curled up to think about the stranger in the library. I should have read the cross-breeding bill instead, but he was more compelling. Something about him shrieked outsider. Maybe a space captain, passing through. But then where were his implants? Ah, well, a gal could dream.\n And dream I did until the morning of my twenty-first birthday. Mostly. I did eventually read the bill.\n I\u2019d assumed it would be a bill for funding at the college\u2014some new strain of wheat with more fiber and vitamins, or livestock that would grow in a tank so we could put yet larger buildings on what was now grazing land. Scientists were always promising things like that and instead creating chickens that could lay striped eggs with yolks that glowed in the dark.\n This bill was different. It claimed to be \u201cto protect the purity of the human and kurz races.\u201d In an attachment\u2014not part of the bill itself but clearly meant to influence its passage\u2014one of the sponsors told a story of his father, whose genetic material had been stolen and used to impregnate a kurz female.\n The bill had lots of language in it about the protection of the two species and about how cross-breeds could serve as vectors for illnesses to spread from one to the other.\n It was a marvel of statesmanship. It had to be, to allow every artificial method of procreation, every drug, every choice we\u2019d given ourselves about our children, yet disallow any hybrids. It stopped short of barring kurz procreation on a planet where there were humans, but not by much. The hints were there for anyone who\u2019d studied politics and history. This was just the beginning.\n It stank worse than a roomful of kurz after a softball game.\n I still hadn\u2019t decided what I could do about it. Ben was too busy to talk to me, although I left several messages at his office.\n Today, though, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Today was the day I went back to see the shadchen, the day I accepted Mother\u2019s wish to find me a husband. I really didn\u2019t care. I had a job; I had ambitions. I even had a cause. I didn\u2019t need a husband. It was my mother who wouldn\u2019t give up.\n Before getting dressed, I paused to look at the yellow star hanging on my wall. The faded ancient fabric was framed behind glass in a controlled atmosphere that prevented further deterioration. I stroked the wooden frame. Had that distant ancestor married for love, or had she, too, been to a matchmaker? I knew she hadn\u2019t met her husband until after the war. I wondered what her dreams had been. They hadn\u2019t been passed down from mother to daughter as the star had been.\n \u201cI remember,\u201d I whispered.\n I pulled out the dress and overskirt that ReeAnn had insisted would be perfect for meeting my future husband. I felt like an idiot with the skirts swishing and swirling as I walked. It was the price I\u2019d had to pay to go alone.\n That wasn\u2019t the way these things were done. The shadchen should have met me to size me up for herself. Then Mother would take over, whether I was difficult or not. Mother should meet with Miss Berazazz and my future husband and mother-in-law to work out the details. Only when the contract was sealed would I set eyes on him. There were several arguments I could have made; I used the simplest.\n \u201cThe shadchen said we should do it this way.\u201d\n That was that. Not even Mother would offend a matchmaker willing to take my unruly self in tow. And so she sat once more in the uncomfortable chair by the front door and waited for me to come down the stairs in my new finery, waited to say good-bye to her grown-up daughter who would finally get married, waited to take one last stab at my self-esteem.\n She stood as I approached the landing. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, I suppose, but would it have killed you to do something with your hair?\u201d\n And there it was. I touched my hair self-consciously. \u201cShort of cutting it all off, this was the best I could do.\u201d I paused in front of the mirror and pulled my hair off my face. \u201cI could try that. Might start a new trend.\u201d\n \u201cYour father must be spinning in his grave to hear you talk like that.\u201d She pushed me at the door. \u201cGo on, then. Try to remember to be a lady.\u201d\n As if I could forget in this get-up. I thought about turning back, but ladies do not renege on their word, even if they didn\u2019t like their options. I didn\u2019t even know my options. Miss Berazazz might have already chosen someone, someone I couldn\u2019t stand. I quailed. The only thing that pushed me forward was the thought of telling Mother I didn\u2019t go.\n I pushed the door open.\n A kurz looked up from an armchair. His eyes were the same deep green as the edge of his frill. \u201cYes?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I tried to back out of the room while still talking, but my overskirt snagged on the door. I tugged at it without looking. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize someone else was . . . I was looking for . . . I\u2019ll come back later.\u201d\n His frill rose in mild surprise. \u201cDo you think you should do that?\u201d\n \u201cCome back? Yes, I\u2019m expected.\u201d\n \u201cNo, not that. I meant\u2014\u201d\n My overskirt tore. I stopped pulling, but it was too late. A large piece of fabric remained caught on the bottom of the door, and the skirt itself was beyond repair. I felt my ears growing hot with embarrassment and knelt to pry the fabric loose, letting my hair fall forward to mask my face.\n \u201cHere, let me help you with that.\u201d\n I inhaled to argue and stopped in surprise. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell.\u201d\n His frill rippled. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n My face should have been in flames based on the heat I was feeling. \u201cYou\u2014I\u2014kurz always\u2014I\u2019ll shut up now.\u201d\n \u201cNot on my account, I trust.\u201d\n I was spared from answering because Miss Berazazz entered from the back room at that moment. Her frill rippled when she saw the two of us together at the door.\n \u201cI see you\u2019ve met my son.\u201d\n I learned a lot in the next few minutes.\n Kurz mating habits are reasonably close to human, although they\u2019re compulsively monogamous. Miss Berazazz had chosen the courtesy title \u201cMiss\u201d based solely on how it sounded to her. She was married, he was off-planet, and Chur-kil was their only child.\n \u201cWhich brings us to you.\u201d Miss Berazazz finished spieling off history. \u201cYou need a husband. My son needs a wife.\u201d\n I gaped at her. Our species weren\u2019t even from the same solar system. I had more in common biologically with chimpanzees than I did with any kurz. Then there was that bill before the council. \u201cBut\u2014we\u2019re incompatible.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought we were getting along pretty well.\u201d He had the nerve to wink his right eye at me, and I blushed again.\n \u201cPerhaps not so incompatible as all that. Chur-kil is the first generation of . . . an experiment.\u201d I stared in horrified fascination as she triggered a holo on her desk. It could have been the older brother of the man I\u2019d met in the library, identical except for blue eyes, streaks of gray above his ears, and a ridge of sensor implants under each eyebrow. \u201cHis father.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d I said. But I remembered the stolen genetic material mentioned in the bill. I bit my lower lip. \u201cDo you have documents?\u201d\n I blanched. Mother would\u2019ve found the rudeness unforgivable, but Miss Berazazz didn\u2019t even wave her frill.\n \u201cCertainly.\u201d She used her monitor to call up copies of her marriage certificate and Chur-kil\u2019s birth certificate. They could have been faked, but since I could access the information from the central database, there wasn\u2019t much point.\n I leaned back in my chair. \u201cAnd he\u2019s the actual father?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the medical records later, but right now, hear me out. As I said, my son is the first generation. We want a second generation, one that will be able to breed freely with either parent race. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d\n This was why I had to be twenty-one. Mother would never have listened to this. It wasn\u2019t illegal; no one thought it possible. But Mother, a blessing on her head, had always wanted me to marry\u2014\n \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re Jewish? Or a doctor?\u201d\n Was I really considering this? So I\u2019d never see Earth. That had never been realistic.\n Chur\u2019s frill was ruffling again. I watched, confused.\n \u201cNeither, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019d be willing to convert, but I\u2019m afraid a bris is out of the question.\u201d\n My mouth opened. Pause. Think about what you\u2019re going to say. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the rabbi would insist.\u201d\n Miss Berazazz\u2014his mother\u2014cut across our interchange. \u201cDid you pay no attention to comparative anatomy in school?\u201d\n I shrugged. \u201cI learned science from test to test.\u201d\n \u201cKurshall keep us all safe!\u201d She leaned across the table. \u201cPhysically, you may be compatible enough to join, but there is no foreskin.\u201d\n \u201cSo your entire race is circumcised. Even better.\u201d\n This couldn\u2019t be real. I didn\u2019t joke about such things. Mother would be appalled to hear me even discussing them.\n \u201cMore or less.\u201d His brow creased, and the corners of his mouth turned up. It didn\u2019t come naturally to him, but he was trying to smile. I found it charming, even if he had been practicing long before he\u2019d heard my name.\n \u201cWhat exactly do you want me to do?\u201d\n The marriage license was already made out. The ceremony could take place immediately. Accompany Miss Berazazz to a clinic the following day, and by the time my party rolled around, I should be well on my way to being knocked up. We could try for future children the old-fashioned way. Only one thing hadn\u2019t been taken care of.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t know where you\u2019d want to live.\u201d He touched the back of my hand with a single finger.\n I pulled my hand away, leaned back in my chair, and rubbed my temples. What would Mother say about a kurz for a son-in-law?\n I went back to something tangible. \u201cI met someone the other day who looks like your father.\u201d\n They exchanged looks. Miss Berazazz said, \u201cMy husband had a child from his first marriage. Chur-kil\u2019s brother . . . never accepted his father\u2019s remarriage. He may be here to cause trouble.\u201d\n That perfect smile, those grey eyes. I looked at Chur-kil. His frill was flat against his head. I didn\u2019t want to be superficial. I didn\u2019t. And yet . . .\n I opened my mouth to refuse.\n \u201cLife won\u2019t be easy for our children,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with time, more time than we\u2019ll see, our peoples will truly be one.\u201d\n The wistfulness in his voice struck a chord in me. They had a glorious vision. I came from a people proud to be set apart, a people he was willing to join. But he\u2019d been planning this for a long time; I hadn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t rush into anything. I told myself it had nothing to do with his brother\u2019s dimple, and I almost believed it.\n I pushed my chair back from the table. \u201cI need time.\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d Chur looked disappointed but nodded.\n His mother was less understanding. I\u2019m used to dealing with mothers, though, and she was a pushover compared to even Aunt Nomi. I promised to return in a week with a decision.\n Chur walked me to the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your skirt.\u201d\n Tell him it had been bought for the occasion? No. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my favorite.\u201d\n Time to go home and re-read the bill. Marriage would be making a stand, but it had to mean more than that, more than green eyes and a forced smile. I had to think. First, though, I had to decide what to tell Mother.\n I couldn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t\u2014tell her all the truth. Fortunately, when I walked in with a torn skirt, Mother\u2019s attention was all for that. \u201cHow could you? It wouldn\u2019t have been suitable for your party, certainly, but it could have been part of your trousseau.\u201d\n Just like that we were on the subject of my marriage.\n \u201cPerhaps.\u201d I twitched my skirt and moved past her to the stairs.\n Her voice stopped me. \u201cYoung lady.\u201d\n I\u2019d had the entire trip home to think about what to say. Except I was thinking about the marriage proposal, legal threats, in-laws who smelled, and talking to my rabbi. Chur had been . . . nice. A vague word, but it fit. He was pleasant and witty, completely agreeable.\n And he\u2019d winked at me. No man had ever winked at me, except for Uncle David when I was a little girl. Chur didn\u2019t care about my dad\u2019s nose, about what I looked like\u2014so far as I knew, all he did care about was that I was unmarried and twenty-one.\n Not exactly a ringing endorsement.\n I sighed. \u201cHe was friendly, but I\u2019m afraid his mother will try to run our lives. I asked for some time to think about it.\u201d\n \u201cI see.\u201d The infinitesimal eyebrow lift. \u201cIs he at least Jewish?\u201d\n \u201cHe says he\u2019ll convert.\u201d I kissed her cheek. \u201cBut I do need time. You wouldn\u2019t want us to name our first-born child for someone on his side of the family, would you?\u201d\n With that, I breezed past her and up the stairs. Everything I\u2019d said was true. I\u2019d only left out the fact that he was kurz. Not fully by biological standards, but to all appearances. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to that conversation.\n I worried at the decision that day and the next and the day of my party\u2014even as I prepared to greet my guests, I wondered what they would say if Chur stood next to me.\n A surprise guest showed up at my party\u2014the handsome stranger from the library\u2014Chur-kil\u2019s half-brother. I first spotted him with Ben and a couple of Ben\u2019s cronies from the Spaceport council. I wanted to talk to them\u2014Ben still hadn\u2019t returned my calls\u2014but hostess duty compelled me to chat with women who wouldn\u2019t have been near my party if they had dared offend Mother.\n \u201cI hear you went to a shadchen.\u201d I couldn\u2019t remember her name. Some vacuous person a couple years older than me, probably with two boys and two girls by now.\n \u201cMother\u2019s idea.\u201d Why elaborate?\n Uncle David joined the conversation. \u201cHistorically, matchmakers create more lasting unions than personal choice does.\u201d\n \u201cHistorically,\u201d I replied, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t usually a way to dissolve a marriage short of murder.\u201d\n \u201cInteresting. Are you looking to hire somebody for the job?\u201d It was the stranger. Ben stood next to him.\n \u201cI\u2019m not married yet, so I\u2019m afraid it would be premature. I can take your references to keep on file.\u201d\n \u201cAlas, I have none.\u201d His smile was as charming as I remembered.\n \u201cDo you at least have a name?\u201d\n \u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said at the same time Ben said, \u201cI brought him over to introduce.\u201d\n \u201cThe least you could do if you helped him crash my party,\u201d I said.\n Ben gave me his standard exasperated cousin look. \u201cMay I introduce Joe Yee? Joe\u2019s recently arrived at the port and is crazy enough to want to make it permanent.\u201d\n \u201cThe lure of the unknown,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAs well as the fascinating beauties on your planet.\u201d\n Ben coughed. I ignored him, even though I didn\u2019t blame him. I tried to keep the frown off my face. I was certain Joe was here to cause trouble for Miss Berazazz and Chur, but what in the world was he doing at my party?\n \u201cWhat would you do here?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cOh, no. You\u2019re going to set each other off,\u201d Ben said.\n \u201cI was thinking of going into politics,\u201d Joe said.\n \u201cI suppose you lapped up all that arguing about the different spacer companies the other day.\u201d\n He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it all from the other side. What do you think of the recently tabled motion on cross-breeding?\u201d\n Was he actually going to announce his views? I said, \u201cI\u2019m no biologist. What about you?\u201d\n He spread his hands. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t studied enough of the particulars to have an opinion yet.\u201d\n Uncle David snorted. \u201cHe\u2019s a politician, all right.\u201d\n \u201cA pity,\u201d I said. \u201cPerhaps you can explain it to me after you\u2019ve had time to study it.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d be delighted.\u201d\n Later, I managed to get Ben off by himself, but only after promising I wouldn\u2019t talk to him about any of the bills facing the council. I asked him about Joe. \u201cI could swear I\u2019ve seen a picture of his father.\u201d\n A shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. His father\u2019s a captain on an interplanetary run. The news often has pictures of one or another of them\u2014usually when something bad happens.\u201d\n Morbid curiosity and gossip. That just about sums up news. I\u2019m not above it myself, but Ben didn\u2019t know about any other family Joe might have. \u201cI thought you had an engagement just about ready to announce.\u201d\n \u201cNothing\u2019s final.\u201d\n Mother found us talking then and chased us back to the party. I wasn\u2019t being a responsible hostess, and it might not be too late to catch the eye of the Governor\u2019s younger son. As said son had a wandering eye and hands to match, I wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic about the prospect as Mother was. I followed her across the patio toward him anyway.\n Help arrived from an unexpected source. Joe caught my arm. \u201cYou promised me a dance.\u201d\n Mother, never one to complain about a gift to the giver\u2019s face (unless you were family, and then it wasn\u2019t so much a complaint as a megillah of what the money could have been better spent on), pushed me into his arms and glided off to speak to Aunt Nomi.\n The song was half over, but I went through the motions. Dancing doesn\u2019t thrill me, although the feel of his hand on mine did strange things to my heartbeat. When the music changed, Joe would have kept dancing.\n I drew him to a nearby bench. \u201cI thought only elected officials refused to give an opinion.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything I might regret later,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would expect me to live up to it.\u201d\n \u201cYou haven\u2019t been involved in politics before, have you?\u201d\n \u201cSo young to be such a cynic.\u201d He brushed his lips across my hand while looking into my eyes. It was a romantic gesture, even if I did see the flash of a sensor implant on his upper lip. He wouldn\u2019t be using it away from the transport sector, not with the penalties. The texture implied simulskin on the surface, and most girls probably never noticed it was there. I wondered what he was wired for.\n I left my hand in his. I looked at the hands, not ready to meet his gaze.\n \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll make a true believer of me yet,\u201d I murmured.\n He leaned in close. \u201cBut a believer in what?\u201d\n My eyes widened at his tone, and I looked up. His eyes were narrowed, and the charming smile was gone. His grip on my hand tightened.\n His voice low, he said, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve gotten yourself into?\u201d\n The music changed again. People moved past us to the dance area. I pulled at my hand, but he didn\u2019t let go.\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n \u201cThe kurz. Don\u2019t deny it. Their pheromones cling to you like sewer water.\u201d\n The sensor must be good to pick it up after two days.\n I shrugged. \u201cMother sent me to a shadchen. I was surprised to find she\u2019s not human, but if she finds me a husband, it clearly doesn\u2019t matter to Mother.\u201d\n \u201cIf you\u2019re not telling me the truth, I will find out.\u201d His sneer marred his good looks. \u201cI know of their plans to pollute the human race with their filth. I\u2019ll stop this\u2014\u201d\n I couldn\u2019t prove he\u2019d used the implant. And if I accused him, it would just give him one more opportunity to air his bigotry when he got his day in court. Distasteful as he was, I had to get him out of here without that satisfaction.\n It was time to be outraged. I\u2019d spent years watching Mother do it; time to see if the passive lessons paid off. My voice rose just enough to cut across the nearby din. \u201cIs that why you came here uninvited? There are standards of behavior in this community.\u201d I snatched my hand back with great force.\n A few heads turned, but Joe couldn\u2019t see them from where he was. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself. I\u2019m checking all the unmarried local women.\u201d\n \u201cMy, a libertine or desperate. Perhaps both.\u201d I knew that wasn\u2019t what he meant, but the onlookers didn\u2019t. I stood. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you to leave now.\u201d\n He looked as though he wanted to say something else. Then he saw Mother standing next to him. To his credit, he didn\u2019t blanch.\n \u201cI believe my daughter asked you to leave.\u201d Nothing colored her voice. \u201cMy nephew will be happy to show you the way out.\u201d\n Ben didn\u2019t look happy. Joe had come with him, and he was going to get an earful from both Mother and Aunt Nomi later. He put his hand on Joe\u2019s shoulder as if he\u2019d ejected men from parties before. Maybe he had; Ben went to parties where that sort of thing might happen.\n The incident effectively killed the party. Clusters of people stood about, talking quietly and casting furtive glances at me when they thought I wasn\u2019t looking. Look at the freak who chased off the only eligible man to show any interest in her ever. If it hadn\u2019t been my party, I\u2019d have pled a headache and left, but a hostess has responsibilities\u2014as though Mother would let me forget.\n I was duly grateful as my guests began leaving in twos and threes. Many of them still wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. Mother stood beside me, smiling and chatting. I was doomed as soon as the last guest left. I knew it.\n The door closed.\n I pursed my lips and looked at the nearby chair. \u201cDoes that leg look chipped to you?\u201d\n The ruse was pointless. She looked over swiftly, then returned her gaze to me. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You, however, have some explaining to do.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make a scene, but he was being rude\u2014\u201d inspiration struck \u201c\u2014and crude about my visits to Miss Berazazz.\u201d\n Rudeness one should rise above. Crudeness, on the other hand, was just not done.\n Her left shoulder seam pleated a trifle; she had relaxed. I wasn\u2019t clear of port yet, though. \u201cYou know what I think of you bringing up such matters to strangers.\u201d\n That one I was prepared for. \u201cTalk circulates at a party, Mother. You know that. I\u2019ll talk to Ben about his choice of companions.\u201d\n \u201cYou needn\u2019t bother, child. I will\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI was hostess. It\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d I hadn\u2019t interrupted Mother since I was two years old. My neck prickled, and I could taste acid in my throat. I bit the inside of my lip. I wouldn\u2019t get sick now.\n Finally, she nodded. \u201cI might still have a word with Nomi about how she\u2019s raised her son, but as you say, it is your responsibility.\u201d\n I don\u2019t remember going upstairs to my room. Shock will do that. I had to get Ben on the line. Not yet, though. I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be home. Maybe Ben would be willing to arrange Joe\u2019s quiet deportation for illegal use of implants if I protected Ben from our mothers. It was worth a try. No need to tell him I\u2019d already saved him from mine.\n Joe had spoken of polluting the human race. I\u2019d heard that line of rhetoric before.\n I crossed my room to face the faded cloth star and ran my finger over the glass as though I could touch the fabric. \u201cNever again.\u201d\n Chur was more human to me than Joe would ever be. He\u2019d make a good husband. I made a call. \u201cI think you should talk to my rabbi. I\u2019ll let him know you\u2019re coming.\u201d\n Erin M.

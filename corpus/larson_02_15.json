He\u2019s a sinewy scarecrow, nearly seven foot already, but handles the ball so damn shifty you\u2019d swear he has gecko implants done up in those supersized hands. Even with the Nike antioxygen mask clamped to his face, the kid is barely breathing hard.\n\u201cHe\u2019s eighteen on November thirtieth, right?\u201d I ask, cross-checking my Google retinal but still not quite believing it. I\u2019m sick as anyone of hearing about the next Giannis Antetokounmpo, the next Thon Maker, but Oxford Diallo looks legit, frighteningly legit.\nDiallo senior nods. Oxford\u2019s pa is not one for words; that much I already gleaned from the silent autocab ride from hotel to gym. Movie star cheekbones, hard sharp eyes. The stubble on his head has a swatch of gray coming in. He\u2019s not as tall as his son, which is like saying, I don\u2019t know, the Empire State Building is not as tall as Taipei 101. They\u2019re both really fucking tall, and the elder\u2019s got more heft to him, especially with the puffy orange fisherman\u2019s coat he has on. I guess he\u2019s fresh enough from Senegal that the climate-controlled gym feels cold to him.\nOn the floor, Oxford moves to a shooting drill, loping between LED-lit circles, catching and firing the ball in rhythm. High release, smooth snap of the wrist. The nylon net goes hiss hiss hiss. He makes a dozen in a row, and when he finally misses it jolts me, like a highlight compilation has somehow gone wrong. That\u2019s how good the stroke is.\n\u201cForm looks solid,\u201d I say, because I don\u2019t think his pa would understand if I told him watching his son shoot jumpers is like freebasing liquid poetry.\n\u201cHe works hard,\u201d Diallo senior allows. \u201cMany shots. Every day.\u201d His retinal blinks ice blue. \u201cExcuse me, Victor.\u201d He picks a small plastic case off the bleacher and heads for the lockers. Normally I\u2019d think it\u2019s some kind of bit, leaving me alone to contemplate in silence, but he\u2019s been doing it like clockwork since I picked him and his son up from the terminal at SeaTac. Some kind of lung condition. It\u2019s not hereditary, so I didn\u2019t bother remembering the name of it.\nI\u2019m already sold, I\u2019ve been sold for the past half hour, but Oxford starts to slam anyways. He launches the ball high for an alley-oop, hunts down the bounce and plucks it out of the air, lofting up, hanging hard like gravity\u2019s got the day off. He swipes it right-to-left behind his back and flushes it with his offhand in one mercury-slick motion.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I breathe. \u201cWe have got to get this kid meshed.\u201d\nI mean, seeing it is one thing. Being able to feel it via nervecast, feel that impossible airtime and liquid power, have the rim float towards you in first person while your muscles twitch and flex, is going to be something else entirely.\nAfter a few more goes at the rack, Oxford sees me waving and jaunts over, looping the ball between his lanky legs on repeat. He takes after his pa facially but his eyes aren\u2019t as sharp yet, and when the antioxygen mask peels free with a sweat-suction pop, he\u2019s got a big white Cheshire grin that would never be able to fit into Diallo senior\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cOxford, my man,\u201d I say. \u201cHow do you like the shoes?\u201d\nHe curls his toes in the factory-fresh Nikes, flexing the porous canvas. The new thing is the impact gel, which is supposed to tell when you\u2019re coming down hard and cradle the ankle, mitigate sprains and all that. But they also happen to look bomb as fuck, lime green with DayGlo orange slashes. I told my girlfriend Wendee I\u2019m getting her a pair for her birthday; she told me she\u2019d rather get herpes.\n\u201cI like them well,\u201d Oxford says reverently, but I can tell his vocabulary is letting him down. The look in his eyes says bomb as fuck.\n\u201cBetter make some room in your closet,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to get you geared up to here. All the merch you can handle. Anything you want.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to sign me,\u201d Oxford grins.\n\u201cOxford, I want you to eat, breathe, and shit Nike for the foreseeable future,\u201d I tell him, straight up. \u201cI would say you\u2019re going to be a star, but stars are too small. You are going to be the goddamn sun about which the league revolves in a few years.\u201d\nOxford pounds the ball thoughtfully behind his back, under his shinbones. \u201cThe sun is a star. Also.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a smartass, too,\u201d I say. \u201cFanfeeds are going to love you.\u201d I start tugging the contract together in my retinal, putting the bank request through. Sometimes the number of zeroes my company trusts me to wield still floors me. \u201cWe\u2019ll want your mesh done for Summit, which might take some doing. Technically nerve mesh shouldn\u2019t go in until eighteen, but technically it also has health-monitoring functionality, so with parental consent we should be able to bully in early. I\u2019ll do up a list of clinics for your pa\u2014\u201d\nI stop short when I realize the grin has dropped off Oxford\u2019s face and down some chasm where it might be irretrievable.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, shaking his head.\n\u201cNo what?\u201d\nHis eyes go hard and sharp. \u201cNo mesh.\u201d\nWhat do you mean he\u2019s not getting meshed? my boss pings me, plus a not unusual torrent of anger / confusion emotes that makes my teeth ache.\n\u201cI mean he doesn\u2019t want it,\u201d I say, sticking my hands under the tap. \u201cHe says he won\u2019t get the mesh, period.\u201d\nI\u2019m in the bathroom, because I couldn\u2019t think up a better excuse. The mirror is scrolling me an advertisement for skin rejuvenation, dicing up my face and projecting a version sans stress lines. The water gushes out hot.\nDo they even know what it is? Did you explain?\n\u201cThey know what a nerve mesh is,\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cThey\u2019re from Senegal, not the moon.\u201d I slap some water on my cheeks, because that always helps in the movies, then muss and unmuss my hair. The mirror suggests I try a new Lock\u2019n\u2019Load Old Spice sculpting gel. \u201cBut yeah,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI, uh, I did explain.\u201d\nOnce Oxford\u2019s pa got back to the bleachers, I gave both of them the whole wiki, you know, subcutaneous nodes designed to capture and transmit biofeedback, used to monitor injuries and fatigue and muscle movement, and also nervecast physical sensation and first-person visual to spectators. If we get our way, with a little swoosh in the bottom left corner.\nIt\u2019s not something I usually have to sell people on. Most kids, even ones from the most urban of situations, have saved up enough for at least one classic nervecast of Maker sinking the game-winner for Seattle in the \u201933 Finals, or Dray Cardeno dunking all over three defenders back when he was still with the Phoenix Phantoms. Most kids dream about getting their mesh how they dream about getting their face on billboards and releasing their own signature shoes.\nThe Diallos listened real intent, real polite, and when I was finished Oxford just shook his head, and his pa put a hand on his shoulder and told me that his son\u2019s decision was final, and if Nike wasn\u2019t willing to flex on the nerve mesh, another sponsor would. At which point I spilled some damage control, got both of them to agree to dinner, and bailed to the bathroom for a check-in with my boss.\nIt\u2019s a zero-risk procedure now, for fuck\u2019s sakes. You can do it with an autosurgeon. Change his mind. A procession of eye-rolling and then glaring emotes, all puffing and red-cheeked.\n\u201cWhat if we just put a pin in the mesh thing and sign him anyways?\u201d I say. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this one get away. You saw the workout feed. We sign him unmeshed, let things simmer, work it into the contract later on as an amendment.\u201d\nIf he\u2019s playing at HoopSumm, he needs a mesh. That\u2019s the coming out party. How the fuck are we supposed to market him without a mesh? Skeptical emote, one eyebrow sky-high. I thought you could handle this one solo, Vic. Thought you wanted that recommendation for promo. Am I wrong?\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say quick. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not wrong.\u201d I yank a paper towel off the dispenser and work it into a big wad with my wet hands. I never elect biofeedback when chatting someone with the power to get me fired; if I did there would be some serious middle-finger emotes mobbing his way.\nFigure out if it\u2019s him or the dad who\u2019s the problem. Then use the one to get to the other. It\u2019s not brain surgery. There\u2019s a chortling emote for the pun, then he axes the chat.\nI\u2019m left there shredding the damp paper towel into little bits, thinking about the promotion that I do want, that I absolutely do want. I\u2019d finally be making more than my old man, and Wendee would be happy for me for at least a week, and maybe during that blissed out week I would get up the balls to ask her to move in.\nBut first, I have to get the Diallos to sign off on a nerve mesh. I\u2019m not exactly bursting with ideas. That is, not until I go to toss the towel in the recycler and see a rumpled napkin inked with bright red blood sitting on top. Then I remember Oxford\u2019s pa and his little plastic case. I shove it all down and head back to the gym, only pausing to order a tube of that new hair gel.\nI take them to a slick new brick-and-glass AI-owned bar, because taking them up the Space Needle would be too obvious. A little holohost springs up at the entry, flashes my retinal for available funds, and takes us straight to private dining. We pass a huge transparent pillar full of chilled wine, which I notice Oxford\u2019s pa look at sideways. More important is Oxford himself staring at the shiny black immersion pods set into the back of the bar. I send them a subtle ping to start scrolling ad banners for some fresh League nervecasts while we settle in around the table.\n\u201cFully automated,\u201d I say, as the waiter rolls up to start dispensing bread baskets, arms all clicking and whirring. \u201cNot bad, right?\u201d\nOxford\u2019s pa nods his head, looking weirdly amused.\n\u201cThey have AI caf\u00e9s in Dakar,\u201d Oxford informs me, scrolling through the tabletop menu. \u201cSince last year.\u201d\nHe\u2019s already put in an order for scallops, so I guess it\u2019s too late to head for the Space Needle. Instead I ping the kitchens for oysters and a few bottles of whatever wine has the highest alcohol content, which turns out to be something called General Washington. I pull up a wiki about vintages to give Oxford\u2019s pa some background, seeing how I can barely tell the difference between a white and a red.\n\u201cTo the Diallos,\u201d I say, once me and him have our glasses filled and Oxford is nursing a Coke.\n\u201cCheers,\u201d Oxford beams.\nWe make some chatter about the length of the flight, about the stereotype that it always rains in Seattle but how really it\u2019s mostly just cloudy. My mouth is more or less on autopilot because I\u2019m watching for Oxford to peer over at the immersion pods. When I catch him at it the third time, I give him a nod.\n\u201cHave a go, man,\u201d I say. \u201cCompany tab. We\u2019ll grab you when the food is here.\u201d Oxford grins and lopes off without any further convincing, leaving me with Diallo senior. I lean over and top off his wine glass. \u201cYou started off playing in the African leagues, isn\u2019t that right, Mr. Diallo?\u201d\nHe takes a drink and makes an approving glance at the bottle. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Greece.\u201d\n\u201cYou must have been a terror back then,\u201d I say. \u201cTo drag Trikala all the way to the A1 finals.\u201d\nOxford\u2019s pa shrugs, but looks nearly pleased.\n\u201cI watched a few highlight reels,\u201d I say modestly. \u201cPart of the job, isn\u2019t it, checking out the pedigree.\u201d I swish my wine back and forth and take a big gulp. \u201cOxford gets it from somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cFrom more than me or his mother,\u201d Diallo senior says. \u201cFrom who knows where. Maybe God.\u201d\nBut he\u2019s glad enough to talk about the stint in Greece for a while, about how he was nearly picked up by Cordoba in the Liga ACB before the bronchiectasis reared its head and suddenly he couldn\u2019t run how he used to. I ping the kitchens to hold the food.\nWhen the bottle is gone and Oxford\u2019s pa is finally slumping a bit in his chair, eyes a bit shiny, I spring the question. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your boy want a mesh?\u201d I say.\nOxford\u2019s pa flicks his gaze over to the immersion pod where his son is jacked in. \u201cHis grandfather had a mesh,\u201d he says. \u201cMy wife\u2019s father. He was a soldier.\u201d\nI kind of startle at that. I mean, I know, in theory, that the nerve mesh technology was military before it went commercial\u2014so was Velcro\u2014but I never thought about it getting use over in fucking West Africa.\n\u201cThey used them to track troop movements,\u201d Oxford\u2019s pa continues. \u201cAnd to monitor the health of the soldiers. To monitor their anxiety.\u201d\n\u201cOurs do that, too,\u201d I say. \u201cMental health of our players is a top priority.\u201d\n\u201cThey did more than that.\u201d Diallo senior empties his glass with a last gulp, then sets it down and looks over at the second bottle. \u201cThey wired them for remote override of the central nervous system. You have heard of puppeteering, yes?\u201d\nI shake my head. I already know I\u2019m not going to like whatever it is.\nOxford\u2019s pa opens the new wine bottle with his big spidery hands, looking pensive. \u201cIt means a soldier cannot break ranks or desert,\u201d he says. \u201cA soldier cannot turn down an order to execute six prisoners taking up too much space in the convoy. Someone else, someone far away, will pull their finger to pull the trigger.\u201d He sloshes wine into his glass and tops mine off, gesturing with his other hand. \u201cA soldier cannot be interrogated, because someone far away will lock their jaws shut, or, if the interrogation is very painful, unplug their brainstem.\u201d\nHe mimes yanking a cord with two fingers, and I feel suddenly sick, and not from the wine. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking awful,\u201d I say. \u201cChrist.\u201d\n\u201cNot our invention,\u201d Diallo senior says.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s nothing like what we do with ours,\u201d I say. \u201cWe don\u2019t control anything. Not a thing. If you could help your son to understand that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Diallo senior echoes. He snorts. \u201cYou think knowing a million people are going to be watching out of your eyes does not control what you do?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about off-court fanfeeds, those are entirely optional,\u201d I say, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cThe fans love them, of course,\u201d I add. \u201cBut it\u2019s not contractual.\u201d\n\u201cOxford does not want you inside his body,\u201d Diallo senior says. \u201cHe does not want you behind his eyes. He does not want the mesh.\u201d\nThen his retinal blinks blue, and it\u2019s a good thing, because I don\u2019t have a good response. He excuses himself to the washroom with his kit, weaving just slightly on his way, which leaves me sitting with a full wine glass and the mental image of some mutilated soldier having his brain shut down by committee.\nBut that\u2019s nothing like our mesh.\nI nab Oxford out of the immersion pod while his pa\u2019s still in the washroom. He climbs out looking all groggy, craning his head to see where the scallops are at.\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u201d I say. \u201cYou like the nervecast?\u201d\nOxford nods, almost reverently. \u201cI crossed up Ash Limner,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThat could be you in there, you know,\u201d I say, tapping the pod. \u201cPeople would be paying to be you in there.\u201d\nOxford gives the pod a look with just a bit of longing in it.\n\u201cEveryone has a mesh,\u201d I say. \u201cAsh Limner is meshed. Dray Cardeno is meshed. Why not Oxford Diallo, huh?\u201d\nOxford chews his lip. \u201cI promised,\u201d he says.\n\u201cTo your grandfather?\u201d I ask.\nHe looks surprised. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut this mesh is different, Oxford,\u201d I say. \u201cWe don\u2019t call the shots. You call the shots. We\u2019re just along for the ride.\u201d\nOxford frowns. \u201cHe said the mesh is a net you never get untangled from.\u201d\n\u201cYou said you liked the nervecast,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of hypocritical of you, don\u2019t you think? You enjoying someone else\u2019s nervecast when you won\u2019t get a mesh for yourself?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Oxford says simply. \u201cThey chose.\u201d\n\u201cThey chose, yeah, of course,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s always a choice. But they made the right choice. Man, you have a gift. Your dad said it himself. You have a gift from God.\u201d I put my hand on the pod again. \u201cYou owe it to the world to make the most of that gift. I\u2019m never going to know what it\u2019s like to slam how you do. I could barely dirty-dunk back in high school. Ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of people are never going to know what it\u2019s like. Unless you let us.\u201d\nI can sense him wavering. He\u2019s looking down at the pod, looking at his reflection in the shiny black mirror of it. I feel guilty in my gut, but I push right through, because this is important, getting this deal, and he\u2019ll thank me later.\n\u201cYou owe it to us,\u201d I say. \u201cYour dad\u2019s in the washroom. You know what he\u2019s doing in there?\u201d\nOxford looks up, startled. Nods.\n\u201cHacking up blood,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to run again. Not how he used to. You don\u2019t think he\u2019d like a chance to feel that again? To hit the break? To get out for that big dunk in transition, pound up the hardwood, slice right to the rack, drop the bomb like wham.\u201d I clap my hands together and Oxford flinches a bit. \u201cYou owe it, man,\u201d I say. \u201cYou owe it to your dad. He got you here, didn\u2019t he? He got you all this way.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s when Diallo senior comes out of the washroom, and I couldn\u2019t have done it any better if I choreographed it myself, because he staggers a bit against the wall and looks suddenly old, suddenly tired. Oxford looks at him, looks scared as hell. Maybe realizing, for the first time, that his pa won\u2019t be around forever.\nI reach as high as I can and put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou know the right call, yeah?\u201d\nHe hesitates, then slowly nods, and I want to bite off my tongue but I tell myself it\u2019s worth it. Tell myself the both of them will thank me later.\nSupper is quiet. Oxford is obviously still thinking about what I said, stealing odd glances over at his pa, and his pa is trying to figure out what\u2019s going on without actually asking. It\u2019s a relief for everyone, I think, when the oysters are finished and we head back outside.\nThe Seattle sky\u2019s gone dark and the air is a bit nippy. Oxford\u2019s pa pulls on a pair of gloves while we wait for the autocab. When it pulls up, Oxford announces he\u2019s not ready to head back to the hotel yet. He wants to shoot.\n\u201cYeah, alright,\u201d I say. \u201cCan head back to the gym. Got it rented for the whole day.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Oxford says. \u201cSomewhere outside.\u201d\nSo we end up doing loops through the downtown until GPS finds an outdoor court at some Catholic school ten minutes away. There\u2019s no one else there when we show up, and the court has one of those weird rubbery surfaces, but Oxford doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He zips off his trackies and digs his ball out of his duffel.\nHis pa keeps the gloves on to feed him shots, moving him around the arc, hitting him with nice crisp passes right in the shooting pocket. You can tell that this whole thing, this whole tableau, with him under the net and Oxford catching, shooting, catching, shooting, is something they\u2019ve done a million times on a million nights. The bright white floodlights make them into long black silhouettes. Neither of them talk, but little puffs of steam come out of Oxford\u2019s mouth as he moves.\nI watch from the chain-link fence, leaning back on it. Oxford\u2019s form is still smooth levers and pistons, but when I get a glimpse of his face I can see he is not smiling how he smiled in the gym. I manage to lock eyes with him, and I give him a nod, then give him some privacy by walking down to the other end of the court. I hear him start talking to his pa in what my audio implant tells me is Serer.\nI\u2019m thinking the contract is as good as signed, and I\u2019m about to tell as much to my boss when I hear the ball slam into the chain-link fence, sending ripples all down the length. I turn to see Oxford\u2019s pa shrugging off his orange jacket, face tight and livid mad. He looks right at me, the sort of look you give something stuck to the bottom of your bomb-as-fuck shoe, then turns to his son.\n\u201cYou think I cannot remember what it feels like to run?\u201d he says. \u201cYou pity me?\u201d\nOxford shakes his head desperately, saying something in Serer again, but his pa is not listening.\n\u201cWe will play, then,\u201d he says, and I get that he\u2019s talking in English so I\u2019ll understand. \u201cYou beat me, you can get the mesh surgery. Yes?\u201d\n\u201cI did not want . . . \u201d Oxford trails off. He stares at me, confused, then at his pa, hurt.\n\u201cIt will be easy,\u201d Diallo senior says. \u201cI am old. I have bad lungs.\u201d He scoops the ball off the pavement and fires it into Oxford\u2019s chest. His son smothers it with his big hands but still has to take a step back, maybe more from the surprise than from the impact.\nOxford puts it on the floor and reluctantly starts his dribble. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, biting at his lips again. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nBut he sleepwalks forward and his pa slaps the ball away, way quicker than I would have thought possible. Diallo senior bullies his son back into the post, hard dribble, fake to the right and then a short sharp jump hook up over his left shoulder. It\u2019s in the net before Oxford can even leave his feet.\nThey\u2019re playing make it take it, or at least Oxford\u2019s pa is. He gets the ball again and bangs right down to another post-up, putting an elbow into Oxford\u2019s chest. Oxford stumbles. The same jump hook, machine precision, up and in. The cords swish.\n\u201cI thought you want it now,\u201d Diallo senior says. \u201cI thought you want your mesh.\u201d\nOxford looks stricken, but he\u2019s not looking over at me anymore. He\u2019s zeroed in. The next time his pa goes for the hook, he\u2019s ready for it, floating up like an astronaut and slapping the shot away hard. Diallo senior collects it in the shadows, brings it back, but the next time down on the block goes no better. Oxford pokes the ball away and dribbles it back to the arc, near enough to me that I can hear a sobbing whine in his throat. I remember that he\u2019s really still a kid, all seven feet of him, and then he drills the three-pointer with his pa\u2019s hand right in his face.\nAnd after that it\u2019s an execution. It\u2019s Oxford darting in again and again breathing short angry breaths, sometimes stopping and popping the pull-up jumper, sometimes yanking it all the way to the rack. He\u2019s almost crying. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re playing to sevens, or what, but I know the game is over when Oxford slips his pa on a spin and climbs up and under from the other side of the net, enough space to scoop in the finger roll nice and easy, but instead his arm seems to jack out another foot at least, impossibly long, and he slams it home hard enough that the backboard shivers. He comes down with a howl ripped out of his belly, and the landing almost bowls his pa over, sends him back staggering.\nDiallo senior gathers himself. Slow. He goes to pick up the ball, but suddenly his grimace turns to a cough and he doubles over. The rusty wracking sound is loud in the cold air and goes on forever. Oxford stands there frozen, panting how he never panted in the gym, staring at his pa, and I stand there frozen staring at both of them. Then Diallo senior spits up blood in a ragged parabola on the sticky blue court, and his son breaks the frieze. He stumbles over, wraps his arms around him.\nA call from my boss blinks onto my retinal, accompanied by a sample from one of the latest blip-hop hits. It jangles back and forth across my vision while I stand there like a statue. Finally, I cancel the call and take a breath.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sign right away,\u201d I say.\nOxford and his pa both look up, remembering I\u2019m there.

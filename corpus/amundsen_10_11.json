He drifts in the paddock, shifting every now and then, always facing me. I don\u2019t like him and I don\u2019t trust him and I\u2019ve more than half a mind that thinks the feeling is mutual. The other ponies, they cluster around the rock at the center of the paddock, young near the middle, all of them grazing in their unhurried way, cropping up what they can find, but Skull Pony, he wants to tell me he\u2019s wise to me. I believe him.\nIt\u2019s not a good idea to assign the ponies gender. It\u2019s a step on the road to anthropomorphizing them and that\u2019s the hell-highway to getting yourself killed by them, a kick or a bite or a weapon array from a design passed through hundreds of generations of hereditary memory. We\u2019ve done brilliant things in our time as a species\u2014the ponies, for example\u2014but we\u2019ve never been that good at walking around outside, making that any safer than it is. Too fast, too big, too much. We were never up to it at our best, and our last best was a while ago.\nIt\u2019s an even worse idea to give the ponies names, shit, that will get you pulled if you ever say it out loud. Normally, anyway, but DeJesus said the name and we\u2019d all been thinking it real loud, and that\u2019s got everyone in a shitty mood. We would have pulled up stake at the sight of him in better times. Better times not being these times, and Skull Pony not being aggressive, yet, and so clearly important to the herd, we\u2019ve been hoping to just work around him. Tag the ponies we want, get them in the barn and off to market.\nSkull Pony dates to somewhere in the Dark Third. He\u2019s got a weapons array on him that flicks in and out of the sheath on his belly and has an uncommon resemblance to a pecker bone. Thus he: kind of a reddish brown and angular, he\u2019s got a white mark all across his face that, when you look at the overall shape of the beast dead on\u2014and he\u2019s always looking at you dead on, sliding his silver pecker slowly in and out its sheath\u2014calls to mind a skull peering in three-quarters, canted just a little to the left. He\u2019s a good nine times as old as the next oldest we\u2019ve dated in the herd. And that\u2019s weird. Usually there\u2019s so little in common between generations spread out so far that they\u2019re not much inclined to herd together. More often, they\u2019ll spook and run from one another. Sometimes they fight, and the next generation gets born armed and skittish.\nThat\u2019s always a miserable shame. Most of the first generation after a herd\u2019s dander gets up is nothing but a menace, and you have to put them down. Skull Pony\u2019s got just that kind of a look. Only we won\u2019t risk it. Killing him would spook the herd, and better times aren\u2019t these times, and well, we\u2019re an enlightened species. Enlightened species, far as I can tell, we all learn that you must be very, very superstitious when you\u2019re in space.\nSkull Pony is an omen like a dry and wracking cough that leaves you dizzy, a sign you need to lay off the smoking. So of course we do the thousands-years-old human thing and ignore it and hope it\u2019s not what you think and it\u2019ll go away on its own. But there I am, floating on the end of the magnetic tether, sidling up to a promising-looking colt, and there he is, right with me. I can\u2019t hear him, but I imagine I can\u2014the raspy pulse of breath, the jets and shifts and the drawing sword sound of the pecker-bone maser. The others are all glad it\u2019s me; everyone who isn\u2019t me ought to be.\nThe colt is grazing, hugging close to the rock and near to a parent. Resemblance is close and clear, but, with the exception of Skull Pony, the herd is pretty homogeneous; variations on a set of themes. Ponies don\u2019t have genders, but they do have parents. Usually it\u2019s two or three. Design by committee works about equally well with all species, as far as I can tell, and it makes for some damned funny-looking children. Occasionally, a single parent will get an idea and reproduce on its own; Law of Heaven alone knows where they get those ideas. At this point, our lives are so full of things that we did so long ago that we can only look at them and wonder what we were thinking; so full that if wondering was all we ever did from here on out, we\u2019d never get through all of them.\nI catch Skull Pony\u2019s reflection off the colt\u2019s saddle. I watch that reflection, seeing it see me.\nI want you not to be here.\nI breathe, because that\u2019s important to remember, and so I can keep my posture as relaxed as I can. Ponies don\u2019t know from tension, exactly, but they aren\u2019t stupid, and when I change my ways, the colt will notice and then we are going to have to go through this all afresh and anew. And time is not factoring on our side on this project.\nThere are some wranglers who will just scoop up all they can of a wild herd, tranquilize them and take them back to their ring, and sure, it\u2019s the quick, and, as long as you\u2019re careful to kill off all the ponies packing weapons, relatively easy way. Assuming any you catch live. Assuming any you catch can be broken in the ring. Assuming any who live and can be broken have traits that you want to use. In case you missed my opinion, or the opinions of my associates on the matter, we\u2019re not in favor; but sometimes, it does give us those come-hither glances. Also, I would love it if Feng cooked Skull Pony right now. He could make that a birthday present for me.\nThe colt\u2019s parent isn\u2019t much bothered by me. Sturdy thing, it\u2019s clearly not interested in anything but what it\u2019s gleaning, molecule at a time, from the surface of the rock. Steady, not terribly fast in the running, and not too bright. The colt, on the other hand, got all the good from the parent present and clearly some other things besides. It\u2019s a little skittish with me, but not very. I can put my hand on it. It doesn\u2019t shy at the touch of the diagnostic cloud. It grazes on some of it, but that\u2019s only natural. Ponies glean up any matter they can find: rocks, ice, methane, the corpses of other ponies, the corpses of spacemen who don\u2019t pay attention to omens, the usual things you find.\n\u201cTransatmospheric?\u201d DeJesus is being casual for my sake, but Skull Pony is very close to my tether and blocking her clear line of sight. And I think he\u2019s doing it on purpose.\n\u201cYou can only wish.\u201d Very few you find in the wild ever are. We breed it in artificially, but new bloodlines are in all kinds of demand. Take-care-of-all-our-financial-worries kind of demand. The colt is not, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not valuable. I just need to know a thing or two more.\n\u201cHowever . . . \u201d Something promising coming in on efficiency levels, stability, maneuvering . . .\nAnd then Skull Pony noses into me. DeJesus starts screaming at Feng in Portuguese, and Feng starts screaming back in Hokkien and my stupid suit diagnostics start running through their protocols in firmware English; three languages feeding into the same head. The colt, the herd, Skull Pony, the rock, the barn and lots of nothing, spinning, and Diver Wei is trying to shut all but one of those things out and focus on the integrity of, in order, his tether, his suit, and his tired flesh. We should worry and feel sorry for poor Diver Wei; he\u2019ll get back to it when he does not fear for his life.\nWithout the tether, the suit is drifting and the flesh is over. Without the suit, the tether is irrelevant and the flesh is over. The flesh can kind of go fuck itself in all of this, except that it\u2019s mine, and I am not quite through with it. I can see a jet of material spreading out from Skull Pony, while DeJesus is talking about the tether, and that English-speaking girl voice\u2014Sylvia\u2014is talking about the suit, and Feng is bemoaning our inattention to blatant omens, the line of information the least relevant to my next few corporeal moments, but in the language I know best of the three. This is why a lot of crews fly monolingual, except for the fact that all the firmware in the suits is in a language otherwise dead since the Dark Third. This is why my life must always be a hardship.\nAnd why my life continues on in hardship is because Skull Pony gave me only the lightest of love-taps. The tether, which he ever-so-slightly disrupted, rights me the moment he gets out of its way. Sylvia comes back with all systems nominal. All is right in the world, except my colt is about five hundred meters away from me, huddled against its parent, clinging to the rock.\nAnd we start anew. We start afresh. Now Skull Pony has had his fun and wanders off, his weapon now retracted, his nose pointed at the rock, browsing for fuel to replace what he lost fucking with me.\nPatience and persistence. If you want anything in this world, you know how this goes; it takes me a while to get near the colt again. A long time, slow movements, long stillness. I get hungry, but the day is long and the food in the galley is not anything a man wants to hurry and eat. It gets better the longer I am out here. The colt needs to reassess. It needs time to reassess. I need to take time. I should have gone back up to the barn, then, fool of a man, because putting out the cloud is going to be fresh in the colt\u2019s mind as being associated with fear. Or maybe it won\u2019t, but that\u2019s the gamble, and if it doesn\u2019t pay out, then there\u2019s no point in coming back tomorrow.\nColt doesn\u2019t shy when I put my hand on its flank. It turns a little away from me, which puts me in jeopardy of a kick, but I don\u2019t think it will. I deploy the cloud.\n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of far out, Diver,\u201d DeJesus says. And I am, but Skull Pony is not here, and that makes all the difference I need to stay. Calm, still; patience and persistence.\n\u201cFuck.\u201d This is a bit embarrassing, really. Not a rookie mistake, exactly, but one I thought was below me. The cloud tells me that the saddle is all wrong, and my eyes flick up toward it, and it is. A jumble of conduits and cables fills the saddle, the tiniest bit of condensation covers its shell.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t even fit ox brain in this thing.\u201d And why would you want to? Ox brains work fine for oxen, but even dim ponies are smarter, and kind of useless for anything but single-occupant transportation.\nThe others have been calling in similar things and half of them are back up at the barn already. Problem with a lot of high reproductive rate herds is that they start thinking that the vestigial parts of them, the parts we need, are, in fact, vestigial; like they somehow own their bodies.\n\u201cCome in, Wei. The day is officially bullshit.\u201d And since it was official, I started climbing the tether back to the barn.\nBut the day wasn\u2019t officially bullshit, yet. Official bullshit got started around the time that Feng picked up a contact.\n\u201cBitter Flower is paying us a visit. Let\u2019s not be here when she arrives.\u201d Tethers start reeling us, the three of us left outside, up toward the barn. There are questions to ask, but they make it policy not to answer them when they are asked from the tethers. Chief among them is \u201cAre you going to have to run before I get back?\u201d Because the Bitter Flower is full of the kind of people who will fry you in your ship and push your remains out the airlock before flying it home. The kind of pirate who won\u2019t give so much as the honor of an old-fashioned boarding and face-to-face shooting. But then, why go outside when you don\u2019t have to, right? Shit is cold out here, and even with a suit that constantly presses in on you and helps massage blood through your veins and little friends busily working night and day to repair tissues, bodies don\u2019t like to work right in space. Really, everything we\u2019ve learned tells us that space is not the place we ought to be.\nSkull Pony is following me back to the barn. Now the day is officially bullshit. He gets good and close, too, taunting me, the fucker. He gets along ahead of me, a little ways closer to the barn than I am and I see him, I know what he\u2019s going to do, because, in space, you can\u2019t not telegraph the evil you\u2019re about to commit. And there is not a thing I can do about it. He crosses the tether.\nFirst thing I do after that is turn off the alarm, because there is no point in that alarm. If you don\u2019t realize, you\u2019re so much better off not knowing. The second thing I do is crash into Skull Pony, face-on, because I am still moving.\nDeJesus doesn\u2019t tell me anything. It\u2019s not like there is anything to say. The barn lumbers away from the paddock and then jumps, flickering out of view. I see this in the shell of Skull Pony\u2019s saddle. The Bitter Flower does whatever it does when its crew realizes their quarry recognized them and ran. I never see that ship. It\u2019s much too far to see. What I do see, encased in some clear carbon lattice just below the shell of Skull Pony\u2019s saddle, is the skull. It\u2019s leering out at three quarters, tilted slightly to the left. No jaw bone. Nine thousand years old. Sylvia tells me the suit is fine for all the good that\u2019s going to do me. My ribs tell me today is officially bullshit. Skull Pony floats in front of me. Tilting and changing position so that it\u2019s always dead on, looking at me with its skull within a skull.\nOkay. So. Now there is a little time for me to decide a few things. There is the easy way, which the suit unlocked for me the moment my connection to the tether severed. Two injections, the first a powerful narcotic, followed thirty seconds later by the kind of neurotoxin that doesn\u2019t give you time to feel the needle that delivered it. And I expect the ponies to graze on me and we\u2019ll see what happens; whenever we get any clear evidence that a pony\u2019s incorporated human materials in any meaningful way, we tend to kill them. They\u2019re not exactly street legal and Skull Pony here is a really good illustration of how wrong it can go. There are others. We ran into one who incorporated the suit neurotoxin into a sort of barb weapon. We weren\u2019t sure what its parents were going for with it, but we didn\u2019t let it stick around long enough for us to find out.\nSkull Pony and I are starting to drift away from the rock. Running into him slowed me down, but not a lot, and not that it matters. The barn won\u2019t be back unless they have some way of being sure that the Bitter Flower is gone, and even I don\u2019t have that. I watch Skull Pony watching me. I wonder what he thinks.\nThere are stories. They\u2019re the kind of thing you tell green wranglers on their first ride out. Some ponies get the taste for people, because, you know, if you start listening to stories, you\u2019ll realize that in all the galaxy, we really are the tastiest thing going. They\u2019ll start grazing on you while you\u2019re still alive, even, some of them. Oh yeah, dissolve your body right out of the suit as the atmosphere vents and your blood vessels go slack and your heart beats against the empty and the cold. You\u2019ll see yourself unravel into the mouth of that pony as the tears freeze over your eyes.\nAbout now, I am thinking easy way. What man wouldn\u2019t? But then, what man wouldn\u2019t try to live while there\u2019s a chance at living, right? I am a wrangler, after all. I break ponies. I break them in the ring. I break them over the course of weeks. On the other hand, I am gambling with a life that I\u2019ve already sort of lost, and the day is officially bullshit, so why not?\nBut a glance tells me why not. While I am still in the paddock, I am much too far from the rock. I could try to flip around and push off of Skull Pony, if he let me, and if I got a trajectory that would actually get me to the rock. It might take a little while more than I have, anyway, and even if I hit the rock, I\u2019m not guaranteed to be close enough to a pony. The pony I get to might not be any better suited to me than the colt from before.\nSkull Pony has insignia. They catch my eye for the first time, because, for the first time I am looking at him, rather than trying not to. It\u2019s nothing I can read, some centuries-old variation on Korean, maybe. Fuck, who knows? There he is, still, looking at me, close enough, maybe, to touch.\n\u201cLet\u2019s reevaluate our relationship.\u201d I reach into my pouch. Skull Pony\u2019s pecker bone weapon slides half out of its sheath. The crop is in there, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m thinking about. Maybe it\u2019s the skull, or maybe it\u2019s because I need the comfort, but what comes out of my pouch is not the crop at all. It\u2019s a pack of smokes.\nThis is how I get myself to quit, when I try to quit. I feel better knowing they are with me. I\u2019m not going to light up out here. Also, when I fail to quit\u2014and yes, there are ways to quit that are absolutely effective, but they are irreversible and I have my pride. Fine, truth, I like trying to quit, I don\u2019t actually want to succeed. Can we go back to me trying not to die in the more immediate sense?\u2014there\u2019s no better place to keep them from getting stale. I flick a cigarette out of the pack and hold it up to Skull Pony, a form of greeting I learned from my father, that he learned from his, and granddad learned from his and all the way back down the line, through the Dark Third, probably back through fourteen thousand years to when tobacco first made its way to my homeland. It\u2019s been like this for a little more than half my nation\u2019s history and all of its space-faring days, which kind of makes it the sort of venerable tradition people like to try and hold onto when they spread themselves between stars.\nIt\u2019s not a good idea to go anthropomorphizing them. Even if\u2014especially if\u2014they might have incorporated human DNA in their own protocols. I let the cigarette float in front of Skull Pony. He looks at it for a moment. How I know his attention is on it and not me, well, I suppose I\u2019m projecting. I\u2019m a smoker; it\u2019s where my attention would be.\nSkull Pony catches it in his grazing array and then it\u2019s gone. The weapon slides away, back into its sheath. I put my hand out, over the skull, touch him.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m not very good at this, but I figure I have nothing to lose. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re bothering to listen to this, or if you understand me talking at all. I\u2019d try Korean, but if that\u2019s what you speak, I\u2019m not going to insult you or myself with my shit command of the language you haven\u2019t heard since who-knows-when. So here it is. I think you did this for a reason, or maybe you were just curious? Anyway, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing this just to kill me. Well, maybe.\u201d\nSkull Pony doesn\u2019t make his purpose clear.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to get into your saddle. If you kill me, I won\u2019t hold a grudge, but I have to try. If you let me, I\u2019m going to ask you to take me someplace that\u2019s more interesting than here, and I promise I\u2019ll let you go, if that\u2019s what you want, and I promise we won\u2019t come back for any of this herd and you can believe me on that, because none of them are good for humans to fly.\u201d\nSkull Pony does nothing. I make my way over to the saddle shell. The access mechanism is a basic, old one, nothing unusual. Under it, there are the outlines of eight enemy ships, a make I don\u2019t recognize, not ponies, certainly. Under those eight, three neat rows of ponies in outline. Vertical red lines through each. I wonder at the doctrine that includes single-occupant vessels in space-borne combat. Really, I wonder at all that shit, but right now I am more wondering if the shell is going to open.\nI try a couple of codes. Skull Pony holds still, well, still relative to me. He\u2019s thinking.\nHe lets me in. The saddle is fully appointed, cushions, safety straps. There is a plastic good luck charm, green and orange, hanging from the reins. Internal displays light up, language configures to something I can mostly read. I strap in. The shell closes around me.\n\u201cAtmospheric pressure detected.\u201d Sylvia sounds almost surprised. \u201cPressure equalized, composition is breathable.\u201d\nSkull Pony pushes the reins toward me. Behind them, a pretty young woman and a little boy smile out from a glass chip and nine thousand years.\nGiddyup."}

While there\u2019s almost always someone (or a group of someones) who tries to sway the process, the voting went rather smoothly this year. Participation was up slightly over 2019 with the majority of the final voting happening in the opening and closing days. We\u2019d like to thank everyone who participated this year and hope you\u2019ll continue your involvement next year.\nBest Cover of 2020\nThe race for this year\u2019s best cover art was interesting. Our winner maintained a clear lead from the start, but the remaining places were very close and frequently shifting. In the end, our readers selected:\n3rd Place: \u201cAlien Scout\u201d by Arjun Amky (November)\n2nd Place: \u201cHome Planet\u201d by Beeple (April)\nAnd this year\u2019s winner is:\n\u201cAncient Stones\u201d by Francesca Resta (October)\nBest Story of 2020\nAs the final round of voting was taking place, the rankings were constantly shifting right down to the closing hours. At the bell, our winner squeaked into the top spot. A total of twelve points separated the top five. While each had a strong showing, this is the first year that the story with the most first place votes did not place in the top three. (It finished fourth, missing first place by six points.) It was the second and third place votes that ultimately made the day and to reinforce that every vote matters, the participation of one more voter could have easily changed everything.\nAnd this year\u2019s winner is:\nCongratulations to all of this year\u2019s winners and finalists! The close races and strong support shown for each story and cover are something that this community can be proud of and we look forward to providing readers with much more to be excited about in the year ahead.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

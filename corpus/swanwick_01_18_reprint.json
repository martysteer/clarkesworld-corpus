That moved me more than I had expected. But what moved me even more was standing at the exact same spot, not two blocks away, where my great-great-grandfather saw Gerry Adams strolling down O\u2019Connell Street on Easter morning of \u201996, the eightieth anniversary of that event, returning from a political rally with a single bodyguard to one side of him and a local politico to the other. It gave me a direct and simple connection to the tangled history of that tragic land.\nI never knew my great-great-grandfather, but my grandfather told me that story once and I\u2019ve never forgotten it, though my grandfather died when I was still a boy. If I squeeze my eyes tight shut, I can see his face, liquid and wavy as if glimpsed through candle flames, as he lay dying under a great feather comforter in his New York City railroad flat, his smile weak and his hair forming a halo around him as white as a dandelion waiting for the wind to purse its lips and blow.\n\u201cIt was doomed from the start,\u201d Mary told me later. \u201cThe German guns had been intercepted and the republicans were outnumbered fourteen to one. The British cannons fired on Dublin indiscriminately. The city was afire and there was no food to be had. The survivors were booed as they were marched off to prison and execution, for the common folk did not support them. By any conventional standard it was a fiasco. But once it happened, our independence was assured. We lose and we lose and we lose, but because we never accept it, every defeat and humiliation only leads us closer to victory.\u201d\nHer eyes blazed.\nI suppose I should tell you about Mary\u2019s eyes, if you\u2019re to understand this story. But if I\u2019m to tell you about her eyes, first I have to tell you about the holy well.\nThere is a holy well in the Burren that, according to superstition, will cure a toothache. The Burren is a great upwelling of limestone in the west of County Clare, and it is unlike anyplace else on Earth. There is almost no soil. The ground is stony and the stone is weathered in a network of fissures and cracks, called grykes, within which grow a province of plants you will not find in such abundance elsewhere. There are caves in great number to the south and the east, and like everywhere else in that beautiful land, a plenitude of cairns and other antiquities to be found.\nThe holy well is one such antiquity, though it is only a round hole, perhaps a foot across, filled with water and bright green algae. The altar over it is of recent construction, built by unknown hands from the long slender stones formed by the natural weathering of the limestone between the grykes, which makes the local stone walls so distinctive and the walking so treacherous. You could tear it down and scatter its component parts and never hear a word spoken about your deed. But if you returned a year later you\u2019d find it rebuilt and your vandalism unmade as if it had never happened. People have been visiting the well for a long, long time. The Christian overlay\u2014the holy medals and broken statues of saints that are sometimes left as offerings, along with the prescription bottles, nails, and coins\u2014is a recent and perhaps a transient phenomenon.\nBut the important thing to know, and the reason people keep coming back to it, is that the holy well works. Some holy wells don\u2019t. You can locate them on old maps, but when you go to have a look, there aren\u2019t any offerings there. Something happened long ago\u2014they were cursed by a saint or defiled by a sinner or simply ran out of mojo\u2014and the magic stopped happening, and the believers went away and never returned. This well, however, is charged with holy power. It gives you shivers just to stand by it.\nMary\u2019s eyes were like that. As green as the water in that well, and as full of dangerous magic.\nI knew about the holy well because I\u2019d won big and gotten a ticket off-planet, and so before I went, I took a year off in order to see all the places on Earth I would never return to, ending up with a final month to spend wandering about the land of my ancestors. It was my first time in Ireland and I loved everything about it, and I couldn\u2019t help fantasizing that maybe I\u2019d do so well in the Outsider worlds that someday I\u2019d be rich enough to return and maybe retire there.\nI was a fool and, worse, I didn\u2019t know it.\nWe met in the Fiddler\u2019s Elbow, a pub in that part of the West which the Bord F\u00e1ilte calls Yeats Country. I hadn\u2019t come in for music but only to get out of the rain and have a hot whiskey. I was sitting by a small peat fire, savoring the warmth and the sweet smell of it, when somebody opened a door at the back of the room and started collecting admission. There was a sudden rush of people into the pub and so I carried my glass to the bar and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Maire na Raghallach,\u201d the publican said, pronouncing the last name like Reilly. \u201cAt the end of a tour she likes to pop in someplace small and give an unadvertised concert. You want to hear, you\u2019d best buy a ticket now. They\u2019re not going to last.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know Maire na Raghallach from Eve. But I\u2019d seen the posters around town and I figured what the hell. I paid and went in.\nMaire na Raghallach sang without a backup band and only an amp-and-finger-rings air guitar for instrumentation. Her music was . . . well, either you\u2019ve heard her and know or you haven\u2019t and if you haven\u2019t, words won\u2019t help. But I was mesmerized, ravished, rapt. So much so that midway through the concert, as she was singing \u201cDeirdre\u2019s Lament,\u201d my head swam and a buzzing sensation lifted me up out of my body into a waking dream or hallucination or maybe vision is the word I\u2019m looking for. All the world went away. There were only the two of us facing each other across a vast plain of bones. The sky was black and the bones were white as chalk. The wind was icy cold. We stared at each other. Her eyes pierced me like a spear. They looked right through me, and I was lost, lost, lost. I must have been half in love with her already. All it took was her noticing my existence to send me right over the edge.\nHer lips moved. She was saying something and somehow I knew it was vastly important. But the wind whipped her words away unheard. It was howling like a banshee with all the follies of the world laid out before it. It screamed like an electric guitar. When I tried to walk toward her, I discovered I was paralyzed. Though I strained every muscle until I thought I would splinter my bones trying to get closer, trying to hear, I could not move nor make out the least fraction of what she was telling me.\nThen I was myself again, panting and sweating and filled with terror. Up on the low stage, Mary (as I later learned to call her) was talking between songs. She grinned cockily and with a nod toward me said, \u201cThis one\u2019s for the American in the front row.\u201d\nAnd then, as I trembled in shock and bewilderment, she launched into what I later learned was one of her own songs, \u201cCome Home, the Wild Geese.\u201d The Wild Geese were originally the soldiers who left Ireland, which could no longer support them, to fight for foreign masters in foreign armies everywhere. But over the centuries the term came to be applied to everyone of Irish descent living elsewhere, the children and grandchildren and great-great-great-grandchildren of those unhappy emigrants whose luck was so bad they couldn\u2019t even manage to hold onto their own country and who had passed the guilt of that down through the generations, to be cherished and brooded over by their descendants forever.\n\u201cThis one\u2019s for the American,\u201d she\u2019d said.\nBut how had she known?\nThe thing was that, shortly after hitting the island, I\u2019d bought a new set of clothes locally and dumped all my American things in a charity recycling-device. Plus, I\u2019d bought one of those cheap neuroprogramming pendants that actors use to temporarily redo their accents. Because I\u2019d quickly learned that in Ireland, as soon as you\u2019re pegged for an American, the question comes out: \u201cLooking for your roots, then, are ye?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that this is such a beautiful country and I wanted to see it.\u201d\nSkeptically, then: \u201cBut you do have Irish ancestors, surely?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, but . . . \u201d\n\u201cAhhhh.\u201d Hoisting a pint preparatory to draining its lees. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for your roots, then. I thought as much.\u201d\nBut if there\u2019s one thing I wasn\u2019t looking for, it was my fucking roots. I was eighth-generation American Irish and my roots were all about old men in dark little Boston pubs killing themselves a shot glass at a time, and the ladies of Noraid goose-stepping down the street on Saint Patrick\u2019s Day in short black skirts, their heels crashing against the street, a terrifying irruption of fascism into a day that was otherwise all kitsch and false sentiment, and corrupt cops, and young thugs who loved sports and hated school and blamed the niggers and affirmative action for the lousy construction worker jobs they never managed to keep long. I\u2019d come to this country to get away from all that, and a thousand things more that the Irish didn\u2019t know a scrap about. The cartoon leprechauns and the sentimental songs and the cute sayings printed on cheap tea towels somehow all adding up to a sense that you\u2019ve lost before you\u2019ve even begun, that it doesn\u2019t matter what you do or who you become, because you\u2019ll never achieve or amount to shit. The thing that sits like a demon in the dark pit of the soul. That Irish darkness.\nSo how had she known I was an American?\nMaybe it was only an excuse to meet her. If so, it was as good an excuse as any. I hung around after the show, waiting for Mary to emerge from whatever dingy space they\u2019d given her for a dressing room, so I could ask.\nWhen she finally emerged and saw me waiting for her, her mouth turned up in a way that as good as said, \u201cGotcha!\u201d Without waiting for the question, she said, \u201cI had only to look at you to see that you had prenatal genework. The Outsiders shared it with the States first, for siding with them in the war. There\u2019s no way a young man your age with everything about you perfect could be anything else.\u201d\nThen she took me by the arm and led me away to her room.\nWe were together how long? Three weeks? Forever?\nTime enough for Mary to take me everywhere in that green and haunted island. She had the entirety of its history at her fingertips, and she told me all and showed me everything and I, in turn, learned nothing. One day we visited the Portcoon sea cave, a gothic wave-thunderous place that was once occupied by a hermit who had vowed to fast and pray there for the rest of his life and never accept food from human hands. Women swam in on the tides, offering him sustenance, but he refused it. \u201cOr so the story goes,\u201d Mary said. As he was dying, a seal brought him fish and, the seal not being human and having no hands, he ate. Every day it returned and so kept him alive for years. \u201cBut what the truth may be,\u201d Mary concluded, \u201cis anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d\nAfterwards, we walked ten minutes up the coast to the Giant\u2019s Causeway. There we found a pale blue, four-armed alien in a cotton smock and wide straw hat painting a watercolor of the basalt columns rising and falling like stairs into the air and down to the sea. She held a brush in one right hand and another in a left hand, and plied them simultaneously.\n\u201cSoft day,\u201d Mary said pleasantly.\n\u201cOh! Hello!\u201d The alien put down her brushes, turned from her one-legged easel. She did not offer her name, which in her kind\u2014I recognized the species\u2014was never spoken aloud. \u201cAre you local?\u201d\nI started to shake my head but, \u201cThat we be,\u201d Mary said. It seemed to me that her brogue was much more pronounced than it had been. \u201cEnjoying our island, are ye?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes. This is such a beautiful country. I\u2019ve never seen such greens!\u201d The alien gestured widely with all four arms. \u201cSo many shades of green, and all so intense they make one\u2019s eyes ache.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely land,\u201d Mary agreed. \u201cBut it can be a dirty one as well. You\u2019ve taken in all the sights, then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been everywhere\u2014to Tara, and the Cliffs of Moher, and Newgrange, and the Ring of Kerry. I\u2019ve even kissed the Blarney Stone.\u201d The alien lowered her voice and made a complicated gesture that I\u2019m guessing was the equivalent of a giggle. \u201cI was hoping to see one of the little people. But maybe it\u2019s just as well I didn\u2019t. It might have carried me off to a fairy mound and then after a night of feasting and music I\u2019d emerge to find that centuries had gone by and everybody I knew was dead.\u201d\nI stiffened, knowing that Mary found this kind of thing offensive. But she only smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the wee folk you have to worry about. It\u2019s the boys.\u201d\n\u201cThe boys?\u201d\n\u201cAye. Ireland is a hotbed of nativist resistance, you know. During the day, it\u2019s safe enough. But the night belongs to the boys.\u201d She touched her lips to indicate that she wouldn\u2019t speak the organization\u2019s name out loud. \u201cThey\u2019ll target a lone Outsider to be killed as an example to others. The landlord gives them the key to her room. They have ropes and guns and filthy big knifes. Then it\u2019s a short jaunt out to the bogs, and what happens there . . . Well, they\u2019re simple, brutal men. It\u2019s all over by dawn and there are never any witnesses. Nobody sees a thing.\u201d\nThe alien\u2019s arms thrashed. \u201cThe tourist officials didn\u2019t say anything about this!\u201d\n\u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t, would they?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the alien asked.\nMary said nothing. She only stood there, staring insolently, waiting for the alien to catch on to what she was saying.\nAfter a time, the alien folded all four of her arms protectively against her thorax. When she did, Mary spoke at last. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll give you a warning. A friendly local will come up to you and suggest that the climate is less healthy than you thought, and you might want to leave before nightfall.\u201d\nVery carefully, the alien said, \u201cIs that what\u2019s happening here?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Mary\u2019s face was hard and unreadable. \u201cOnly, I hear Australia\u2019s lovely this time of year.\u201d\nAbruptly, she whirled about and strode away so rapidly that I had to run to catch up to her. When we were well out of earshot of the alien, I grabbed her arm and angrily said, \u201cWhat the fuck did you do that for?\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s just pretend that it is. Why?\u201d\n\u201cTo spread fear among the Outsiders,\u201d she said, quiet and fierce. \u201cTo remind them that Earth is sacred ground to us and always will be. To let them know that while they may temporarily hold the whip, this isn\u2019t their planet and never will be.\u201d\nThen, out of nowhere, she laughed. \u201cDid you see the expression on that skinny blue bitch\u2019s face? She practically turned green!\u201d\n\u201cWho are you, Mary O\u2019Reilly?\u201d I asked her that night, when we were lying naked and sweaty among the tangled sheets. I\u2019d spent the day thinking, and realized how little she\u2019d told me about herself. I knew her body far better than I did her mind. \u201cWhat are your likes and dislikes? What do you hope and what do you fear? What made you a musician, and what do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d I was trying to keep it light, seriously though I meant it all.\n\u201cI always had the music, and thank God for that. Music was my salvation.\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cMy parents died in the last days of the war. I was only an infant, so I was put into an orphanage. The orphanages were funded with American and Outsider money, part of the campaign to win the hearts and minds of the conquered peoples. We were raised to be denationalized citizens of the universe. Not a word of Irish touched our ears, nor any hint of our history or culture. It was all Greece and Rome and the Aldebaran Unity. Thank Christ for our music! They couldn\u2019t keep that out, though they tried hard to convince us it was all harmless deedle-deedle jigs and reels. But we knew it was subversive. We knew it carried truth. Our minds escaped long before our bodies could.\u201d\nWe, she\u2019d said, and us and our. \u201cThat\u2019s not who you are, Mary. That\u2019s a political speech. I want to know what you\u2019re really like. As a person, I mean.\u201d\nHer face was like stone. \u201cI\u2019m what I am. An Irishwoman. A musician. A patriot. Cooze for an American playboy.\u201d\nI kept my smile, though I felt as if she\u2019d slapped me. \u201cThat\u2019s unfair.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an evil thing to have a naked woman look at you the way Mary did me. \u201cIs it? Are you not abandoning your planet in two days? Maybe you\u2019re thinking of taking me along. Tell me, exactly how does that work?\u201d\nI reached for the whiskey bottle on the table by the bed. We\u2019d drunk it almost empty, but there was still a little left. \u201cIf we\u2019re not close, then how is that my fault? You\u2019ve known from the start that I\u2019m mad about you. But you won\u2019t even\u2014oh, fuck it!\u201d I drained the bottle. \u201cJust what the hell do you want from me? Tell me! I don\u2019t think you can.\u201d\nMary grabbed me angrily by the arms and I dropped the bottle and broke her hold and seized her by the wrists. She bit my shoulder so hard it bled and when I tried to push her away, toppled me over on my back and clambered up on top of me.\nWe did not so much resolve our argument as fuck it into oblivion.\nIt took me forever to fall asleep that night. Not Mary. She simply decided to sleep and sleep came at her bidding. I, however, sat up for hours staring at her face in the moonlight. It was all hard planes and determination. A strong face but not one given to compromise. I\u2019d definitely fallen in love with the wrong woman. Worse, I was leaving for distant worlds the day after tomorrow. All my life had been shaped toward that end. I had no Plan B.\nIn the little time I had left, I could never sort out my feelings for Mary, much less hers for me. I loved her, of course, that went without saying. But I hated her bullying ways, her hectoring manner of speech, her arrogant assurance that I would do whatever she wanted me to do. Much as I desired her, I wanted nothing more than to never see her again. I had all the wealth and wonders of the universe ahead of me. My future was guaranteed.\nAnd, God help me, if she\u2019d only asked me to stay, I would have thrown it all away for her in an instant.\nIn the morning, we took a hyperrapid to Galway and toured its vitrified ruins. \u201cResistance was stiffest in the West,\u201d Mary said. \u201cOne by one all the nations of the earth sued for peace, and even in Dublin there was talk of accommodation. Yet we fought on. So the Outsiders hung a warship in geostationary orbit and turned their strange weapons on us. This beautiful port city was turned to glass. The ships were blown against the shore and broke on the cobbles. The cathedral collapsed under its own weight. Nobody has lived here since.\u201d\nThe rain spattered to a stop and there was a brief respite from the squalls which in that part of the country come off the Atlantic in waves. The sun dazzled from a hundred crystalline planes. The sudden silence was like a heavy hand laid unexpectedly upon my shoulder. \u201cAt least they didn\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d I said weakly. I was of a generation that saw the occupation of the Outsiders as being, ultimately, a good thing. We were healthier, richer, happier, than our parents had been. Nobody worried about environmental degradation or running out of resources anymore. There was no denying we were physically better off for their intervention.\n\u201cIt was a false mercy that spared the citizens of Galway from immediate death and sent them out into the countryside with no more than the clothes on their backs. How were they supposed to survive? They were doctors and lawyers and accountants. Some of them reverted to brigandry and violence, to be sure. But most simply kept walking until they lay down by the side of the road and died. I can show you as many thousand hours of recordings of the Great Starvation as you can bring yourself to stomach. There was no food to be had, but thanks to the trinkets the Outsiders had used to collapse the economy, everybody had cameras feeding right off their optic nerves, saving all the golden memories of watching their children die.\u201d\nMary was being unfair\u2014the economic troubles hadn\u2019t been the Outsiders\u2019 doing. I knew because I\u2019d taken economics in college. History, too, so I also knew that the war had, in part, been forced upon them. But though I wanted to, I could not adequately answer her. I had no passion that was the equal of hers.\n\u201cThings have gotten better,\u201d I said weakly. \u201cLook at all they\u2019ve done for . . . \u201d\n\u201cThe benevolence of the conqueror, scattering coins for the peasants to scrabble in the dust after. They\u2019re all smiles when we\u2019re down on our knees before them. But see what happens if one of us stands up on his hind legs and tells them to sod off.\u201d\nWe stopped in a pub for lunch and then took a hopper to Gartan Lough. There we bicycled into the countryside. Mary led me deep into land that had never been greatly populated and was still dotted with the ruins of houses abandoned a quarter-century before. The roads were poorly paved or else dirt, and the land was so beautiful as to make you weep. It was a perfect afternoon, all blue skies and fluffy clouds. We labored up a hillside to a small stone chapel that had lost its roof centuries ago. It was surrounded by graves, untended and overgrown with wildflowers.\nLying on the ground by the entrance to the graveyard was the Stone of Loneliness.\nThe Stone of Loneliness was a fallen menhir or standing stone, something not at all uncommon throughout the British Isles. They\u2019d been reared by unknown people for reasons still not understood in Megalithic times, sometimes arranged in circles, and other times as solitary monuments. There were faded cup-and-ring lines carved into what had been the stone\u2019s upper end. And it was broad enough that a grown man could lie down on it. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cLie down on it,\u201d Mary said.\nSo I did.\nI lay down upon the Stone of Loneliness and closed my eyes. Bees hummed lazily in the air. And, standing at a distance, Mary began to sing:\nThe lions of the hills are gone\nAnd I am left alone, alone . . .\nIt was \u201cDeirdre\u2019s Lament,\u201d which I\u2019d first heard her sing in the Fiddler\u2019s Elbow. In Irish legend, Deirdre was promised from infancy to Conchobar, the king of Ulster. But, as happens, she fell in love with and married another, younger man. Naoise, her husband, and his brothers Ardan and Ainnle, the sons of Uisnech, fled with her to Scotland, where they lived in contentment. But the humiliated and vengeful old king lured them back to Ireland with promises of amnesty. Once they were in his hands, he treacherously killed the three sons of Uisnech and took Deirdre to his bed.\nThe Falcons of the Wood are flown\nAnd I am left alone, alone . . .\nDeirdre of the Sorrows, as she is often called, has become a symbol for Ireland herself\u2014beautiful, suffering from injustice, and possessed of a happy past that looks likely to never return. Of the real Deirdre, the living and breathing woman upon whom the stories were piled like so many stones on a cairn, we know nothing. The legendary Deirdre\u2019s story, however, does not end with her suicide, for in the aftermath of Conchobar\u2019s treachery wars were fought, the injustices of which led to further wars. Which wars continue to this very day. It all fits together suspiciously tidily.\nIt was no coincidence that Deirdre\u2019s father was the king\u2019s storyteller.\nThe dragons of the rock are sleeping\nSleep that wakes not for our weeping . . .\nAll this, however, I tell you after the fact. At the time, I was not thinking of the legend at all. For the instant I lay down upon the cold stone, I felt all the misery of Ireland flowing into my body. The Stone of Loneliness was charmed, like the well in the Burren. Sleeping on it was said to be a cure for homesickness. So, during the Famine, emigrants would spend their last night atop it before leaving Ireland forever. It seemed to me, prone upon the menhir, that all the sorrow they had shed was flowing into my body. I felt each loss as if it were my own. Helplessly, I started to weep and then to cry openly. I lost track of what Mary was singing, though her voice went on and on. Until finally she sang\nDig the grave both wide and deep\nSick I am, and fain would sleep\nDig the grave and make it ready\nLay me on my true Love\u2019s body\nand stopped. Leaving a silence that echoed on and on forever.\nThen Mary said, \u201cThere\u2019s someone I think you\u2019re ready to meet.\u201d\nMary took me to a nondescript cinder block building, the location of which I will take with me to the grave. She led the way in. I followed nervously. The interior was so dim I stumbled on the threshold. Then my eyes adjusted, and I saw that I was in a bar. Not a pub, which is a warm and welcoming public space where families gather to socialize, the adults over a pint and the kiddies drinking their soft drinks, but a bar\u2014a place where men go to get drunk. It smelled of poit\u00edn and stale beer. Somebody had ripped the door to the bog off its hinges and no one had bothered to replace it. Presumably Mary was the only woman to set foot in the place for a long, long time.\nThere were three or four men sitting at small tables in the gloom, their backs to the door, and a lean man with a bad complexion at the bar. \u201cHere you are then,\u201d he said without enthusiasm.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Liam,\u201d Mary said to me. Then, to Liam, \u201cHave you anything fit for drinking?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not why we came anyway.\u201d Mary jerked her head toward me. \u201cHere\u2019s the recruit.\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like much.\u201d\n\u201cRecruit for what?\u201d I said. It struck me suddenly that Liam was keeping his hands below the bar, out of sight. Down where a hard man will keep a weapon, such as a cudgel or a gun.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let his American teeth put you off. They\u2019re part of the reason we wanted him in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re a patriot, are you, lad?\u201d Liam said in a voice that indicated he knew good and well that I was not.\n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nLiam glanced quickly at Mary and curled his lip in a sneer. \u201cAhh, he\u2019s just in it for the crack.\u201d In Irish craic means \u201cfun\u201d or \u201ckicks.\u201d But the filthy pun was obviously intended. My face hardened and I balled up my fists. Liam didn\u2019t look concerned.\n\u201cHush, you!\u201d Mary said. Then, turning to me, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll thank you to control yourself as well. This is serious business. Liam, I\u2019ll vouch for the man. Give him the package.\u201d\nLiam\u2019s hands appeared at last. They held something the size of a biscuit tin. It was wrapped in white paper and tied up with string. He slid it across the bar.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a device,\u201d Liam said. \u201cProperly deployed, it can implode the entire administrative complex at Shannon Starport without harming a single civilian.\u201d\nMy flesh ran cold.\n\u201cSo you want me to plant this in the \u2019port, do yez?\u201d I said. For the first time in weeks, I became aware of the falseness of my accent. Impulsively, I pulled the neuropendant from beneath my shirt, dropped it on the floor, and stepped on it. Whatever I said here, I would say it as myself. \u201cYou want me to go in there and fucking blow myself up?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Mary said. \u201cWe have a soldier in place for that. But he\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOr she,\u201d Liam amended.\n\u201c\u2014or she isn\u2019t in a position to smuggle this in. Human employees aren\u2019t allowed to bring in so much as a pencil. That\u2019s how little the Outsiders think of us. You, however, can. Just take the device through their machines\u2014it\u2019s rigged to read as a box of cigars\u2014in your carry-on. Once you\u2019re inside, somebody will come up to you and ask if you remembered to bring something for granny. Hand it over.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d Liam said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be halfway to Jupiter before anything happens.\u201d\nThey both looked at me steadily. \u201cForget it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not killing any innocent people for you.\u201d\n\u201cNot people. Aliens.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re still innocent.\u201d\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be here if they hadn\u2019t seized the planet. So they\u2019re not innocent.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nation of fucking werewolves!\u201d I cried. Thinking that would put an end to the conversation.\nBut Mary wasn\u2019t fazed. \u201cThat we are,\u201d she agreed. \u201cDay by day, we present our harmless, domestic selves to the world, until one night the beast comes out to feed. But at least we\u2019re not sheep, bleating complacently in the face of the butcher\u2019s knife. Which are you, my heart\u2019s beloved? A sheep? Or could there be a wolf lurking deep within?\u201d\n\u201cHe can\u2019t do the job,\u201d Liam said. \u201cHe\u2019s as weak as watered milk.\u201d\n\u201cShut it. You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Mary fixed me with those amazing eyes of hers, as green as the living heart of Ireland, and I was helpless before them. \u201cIt\u2019s not weakness that makes you hesitate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a foolish and misinformed conscience. I\u2019ve thought about this far longer than you have, my treasure. I\u2019ve thought about it all my life. It\u2019s a holy and noble thing that I\u2019m asking of you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNight after night, you\u2019ve sworn you\u2019d do anything for me\u2014not with words, I\u2019ll grant you, but with looks, with murmurs, with your soul. Did you think I could not hear the words you dared not say aloud? Now I\u2019m calling you on all those unspoken promises. Do this one thing\u2014if not for the sake of your planet, then for me.\u201d\nAll the time we\u2019d been talking, the men sitting at their little tables hadn\u2019t made a noise. Nor had any of them turned to face us. They simply sat hunched in place\u2014not drinking, not smoking, not speaking. Just listening. It came to me then how large they were, and how still. How alert. It came to me then that if I turned Mary down, I\u2019d not leave this room alive.\nSo, really, I had no choice.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd God damn you for asking me to.\u201d\nMary went to hug me and I pushed her roughly away. \u201cNo! I\u2019m doing this thing for you, and that puts us quits. I never want to see you or think of you again.\u201d\nFor a long, still moment, Mary studied me calmly. I was lying, for I\u2019d never wanted her so much as I did in that instant. I could see that she knew I was lying, too. If she\u2019d let the least sign of that knowledge show, I believe I would have hit her. But she did not. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cSo long as you keep your word.\u201d\nShe turned and left and I knew I would never see her again.\nLiam walked me to the door. \u201cBe careful with the package outside in the rain,\u201d he said, handing me an umbrella. \u201cIt won\u2019t work if you let it get damp.\u201d\nI was standing in Shannon Starport, when Homeworld Security closed in on me. Two burly men in ITSA uniforms appeared to my either side and their alien superior said, \u201cWould you please come with us, sir.\u201d It was not a question.\nOh, Mary, I thought sadly. You have a traitor in your organization. Other than me, I meant. \u201cCan I bring my bag?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see to that, sir.\u201d\nI was taken to their interrogation room.\nFive hours later I got onto the lighter. They couldn\u2019t hold me because there wasn\u2019t anything illegal in my possession. I\u2019d soaked the package Liam gave me in the hotel room sink overnight and then gotten up early and booted it down a storm drain when no one was looking. It was a quick trip to orbit where there waited a ship larger than a skyscraper and rarer than almost anything you could name, for it wouldn\u2019t return to this planet for centuries. I floated on board knowing that for me there\u2019d be no turning back. Earth would be a story I told my children, and a pack of sentimental lies they would tell theirs.\nMy homeworld shrank behind me and disappeared. I looked out the great black glass walls into a universe thronged with stars and galaxies and had no idea where I was or where I thought I was going. It seemed to me then that we were each and every one of us ships without a harbor, sailors lost on land.\nI used to say that only Ireland and my family could make me cry. I cried when my mother died and I cried when Dad had his heart attack the very next year. My baby sister failed to survive the same birth that killed my mother, so some of my tears were for her as well. Then my brother Bill was hit by a drunk driver and I cried and that was the end of my family. Now there\u2019s only Ireland.\nBut that\u2019s enough.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019 Science Fiction, August 2011.\nMichael Swanwick is one of the most acclaimed and prolific science fiction and fantasy writers of his generation.

I think I am fourteen. I will probably die today. If not, I will probably die tomorrow.\n When it happens, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be surprised. Frightened, maybe, but not surprised.\n In the forest, scales are most common. If they cut you, the cut will never stop bleeding.\n If you step in a place where a dragon has defecated, food will stream through your body, and you will always be hungry. If you pass a place where a dragon breathed fire, your skin will forever blister and heal and then blister again. If you touch a dragon\u2019s blood, you\u2019ll go mad.\n As for me, I was harvesting scales. With a scale, you can till the land faster than anyone using an iron hoe. You can butcher meat in a tenth the time it takes to use a knife. There are good things about dragon leavings, and for those good things, I usually get paid enough to eat.\n Scales are common. Everyone knows about those. It was something else that got me.\n When I die, if you ask the And\u00e9 what killed me, they will probably say it was the dragons. Ask me now, and I\u2019ll tell you the And\u00e9 are responsible. They drove their dragons across our land.\n I don\u2019t know why the And\u00e9, who live to our west, hated the Zhie, who live to our east. Kwesi has tried to explain, and so has Hano. But their explanations don\u2019t make sense.\n Kwesi believes war is what people do. He says when people are lazy, they go to war. He says Rho would go to war if we weren\u2019t so poor. He may be right, but it doesn\u2019t explain why the And\u00e9 attacked the Zhie instead of the Rho or the Merais or someone else.\n Hano\u2019s answer is even stranger. \u201cThe And\u00e9 say the Zhie cut the hands off And\u00e9 children. They say they stole their women in the night and sucked their blood and made them defecate on And\u00e9 flags. And they were killing And\u00e9 spirits, too.\u201d\n I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of the Zhie doing anything like that.\u201d\n Hano got annoyed. \u201cNo, I mean that\u2019s what the And\u00e9 say.\u201d\n But since those were obvious lies, there must have been another reason first.\n I suppose reasons don\u2019t matter now. The And\u00e9 had dragons. The Zhie had none. With firecrackers and guns and bayonets, the And\u00e9 drove their dragons into Zhie land as a strong, angry man will drive a knife into someone\u2019s heart. And we, the Rho, were in the middle. We were the flesh, the ribs. They drove the dragons right through us.\n That was fifty years ago, the dragons, the war. Since then, we\u2019ve had floods from old dragons\u2019 tears, and earthquakes from old footprints. It was an earthquake that brought me here to Pon\u00e7an. I was in the forest, a few dozen kilometers from the rubble of the village where I must have grown up. Kwesi was a truck driver then and he heard me screaming in the trees. He went off road, loaded me into his truck, and took me to the N.G.O. men.\n We used to call Pon\u00e7an the tent city. Most of the tents are gone now. There\u2019s still a crew of NGO men left behind \u201cto coordinate efforts in the surrounding countryside.\u201d But these days, when Kwesi wants a break from hauling, he can usually find an abandoned building to stay in.\n The people here pronounce NGO as Ngo. Kwesi taught me: you position your tongue at the top of your mouth to make an n without speaking, then make a g with the back of your tongue. Then let out the o and it\u2019ll push the ng right in front of it.\n There are a lot of ng sounds in Kwesi\u2019s dialect. There are a lot of NGOs in Rho.\n Pon\u00e7an is mostly empty now except for the Ngo men who stayed behind. The rest of us have nowhere to go, like Hano and I.\n Hano is my best friend. He\u2019s also never been changed by a dragon. People like that are rare in Pon\u00e7an. If you ask him why, he\u2019ll just say he was lucky.\n Kwesi, who is the same age as our fathers would be, used to be a friend of Hano\u2019s family. After he dropped me in the tent city, he sent Hano to look after me. We fell in easily together. He showed me how to find houses no one was using so I didn\u2019t always have to sleep in the tents, and how to go through the dump outside the village, and how to get in queues early for meal relief.\n Hano is fast on his feet. He\u2019s cheerful even when he shouldn\u2019t be. He has quick, bright eyes for spotting useful things that have been thrown away, and deft hands for pulling them free.\n \u201cI wanted to grow up to be like my mother,\u201d he told me once while we shared fruit we\u2019d found in an Ngo dumpster. His mother had died in the flood which happened before the earthquake, but he still talked about her happily. \u201cShe taught little kids, four year olds, six year olds. The smallest ones are the best. They\u2019re always running after something even if they still piss themselves.\u201d\n He looked regretfully at his withered fruit and went on. \u201cShe was a great cook, too. We\u2019d find papayas and cook them with lime and chilies. My little sister drank from a stream where a dragon shat. It wasn\u2019t bad enough to kill her, but she couldn\u2019t keep her food so there was always cooking to do.\u201d\n I examined the bruised parts of my fruit, and leaned against the dumpster. The sky above Pon\u00e7an is never a normal color. It was changed by dragon wings a long time ago. It was mud brown that evening. The Hizhang cows lowed as it got darker.\n \u201cWhat did you want to do?\u201d Hano said.\n I pretended not to know. \u201cWhen?\u201d\n \u201cBefore Pon\u00e7an, what did you want to do?\u201d\n Hano and Kwesi know I don\u2019t remember much from before, but I\u2019ve never told them it\u2019s basically all gone. Maybe not having a past makes it easier not to spend time thinking about before and after like Hano does. I\u2019m too busy trying to sell scales and get a bite to eat.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer,\u201d Hano assured me.\n I said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2014\u201d\n Hano\u2019s eyes went wide. He clapped his hand over my mouth. A cry drifted between buildings, and from the corner of my eye, I saw a moving fire.\n The burning children won\u2019t usually hurt you because they can\u2019t really see. They just wander, hands outstretched. It\u2019s only when you make noise that they\u2019ll come toward you and wrap their arms around your knees. They want someone to hold onto. They don\u2019t realize they\u2019re burning you alive with the same dragon-fire that killed them long ago.\n Life in Pon\u00e7an is not so bad. We waited until its cries were gone, and then counted three hundred breaths more to be sure.\n You see, we were lucky. The And\u00e9 drove the big dragons north of Pon\u00e7an. We only got little dragons, the size of trucks, whose looks melted one or two people at a time. And they were always on the move, not being thrashed into city-destroying rages.\n During the war, the And\u00e9 slaughtered a big dragon the size of a mountain. They dropped its liver and gall on Hizhang. Bile poisoned the earth, poisoned the air, poisoned the people and the children of the people, and is still poisoning them now. People born in Hizhang have probably never seen a dragon, but they don\u2019t need to.\n Every dusk, the cows start lowing from Hizhang. But there are no longer cows in Hizhang.\n You see, we were lucky.\n I\u2019ve never seen a dragon, but I don\u2019t need to.\n There\u2019s an art to picking up dragon scales. You have to be careful not to touch the edges. You pinch them just past the edge and wiggle them out of the soil or loam or scree. Then if you\u2019ve picked up an old tin can or something, you put them in there. If not, you can wrap them in cloth, but it will get cut through, and the scales will cut whatever is nearby, too. The tin cans also get cut, but not as quickly.\n A long time ago when Pon\u00e7an was still a tent city, an Ngo man told me there are different types of remembering. I\u2019ve forgotten my old life, but not how to gather scales.\n I have so many cuts on my fingers that my hands are always cracking with dried blood. I have cuts on my knees and feet from dropping scales, but they aren\u2019t deep. The thighs are especially dangerous, like the arms. It\u2019s easy to bleed out. You see, I\u2019m lucky. I\u2019m not bleeding out. Just seeping.\n This is a world with only two things in it: the ones which change, and the ones which linger on. I was one of the things that changed.\n My life before is gone, but I remember how I got to the tent city. I remember the tatty roof of Kwesi\u2019s truck which was all I stared at for hours. I remember the jolting road, thinking someone angry was shaking me. I remember the dust, which blew into my mouth and eyes.\n The sky was green, and the sun was so, so bright.\n White tents held hot air like breaths they wouldn\u2019t let go. There were bodies everywhere, moving, moaning. There were no beds left. I was put on a pad on the ground. I lay there staring at the tent ribs, and listening to the wind. It was a hard sound to hold onto. So many voices overrode it.\n They gave me a paper bracelet. I don\u2019t know what it said. I hadn\u2019t told them my name.\n Afternoon passed, and evening, and the lowing of the Hizhang cows. The tent canvas was brightening with morning when a Ngo man examined me. He tested the weight of my limbs, looked at my teeth and eyes, and felt my neck, armpits, and groin. He took a vial of my blood and labeled it in neat Merais letters. He put the blood in a case with mist pouring out of it. Another Ngo man was following him with a clipboard.\n The man was surprised when he realized it wasn\u2019t the earthquake that had left me feverish and screaming. \u201cNeutrois,\u201d he said slowly, so that the one with the clipboard could write it down. \u201cA common affliction in the parts of the world that deal with dragon breeding. There are schools to rehabilitate them, even surgery if a sex can be assigned.\u201d\n They went on to the next boy, and a Rho nurse came to check my fever. Behind her, wind batted the tent flap, showing flashes of orange sky.\n Hano has never been changed by a dragon, and if I can stop it, he won\u2019t ever be. He\u2019s better at scavenging in the village anyway. I go out for scales.\n A few days ago, the sky rose purple. The sky above Pon\u00e7an is many colors, but almost never purple. We couldn\u2019t decide what it meant. Hano thought it was good luck. Kwesi, who brought us a handful of dried fish, thought it was a fool\u2019s game to gamble on anything but bad luck in Pon\u00e7an.\n Me, I went out to gather, because we needed scales. Hano sent me out with tin cans from Ngo dumps, and I pried loose a half-dozen scales without adding fresh cuts to my hands.\n I took my time walking back through the sweet-smelling trees. The sky shifted restlessly between lavender and violet. Darker shades made the trees look black even though it was afternoon.\n Among the shadowed trunks, I saw two animals. The small one suckled from the large one. As I neared, I saw it was a muntjac suckling from a forest ox. It was the ox that looked at me as it angled its large body to stand between me and its fawn. Its eyes were challenging. They said: Leave us to ourselves. This is our new world, and we are content with it.\n These are things that have changed.\n I never went to surgery. A gender was never assigned. Boys mostly treated me like another boy, and girls like another girl, so long as no one asked. When they did, I said \u201cbecause of the dragons\u201d and they might wrinkle their noses, but then they\u2019d crowd around to show me what had happened to them.\n \u201cLook! I picked up something on the side of the road, and now my hand-bones are soft\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014all my teeth went sharp! I can\u2019t even eat fruit anymore\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo, no, see this? One foot is on backwards, but only the one.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. My sister has her whole head on backwards!\u201d\n \u201cMy grandma can turn her hands backwards.\u201d\n \u201cLook at me, I have two tongues! T-t-wo t-t-ong-g-gues!\u201d\n Life in Pon\u00e7an is not so bad.\n In the purple-sky evening, Kwesi caught me on my way back from gathering scales. We laid them flat in the bed of his truck where it would take them a little longer to cause trouble.\n With his braids swept back, I could see the hungry little mouths on his neck which he\u2019d gotten when he was hit with shrapnel from a dragon-tooth bomb. He always wore his shirt, even on hot days, to hide the ones on his side.\n He caught me looking, and grinned as he pushed his hair over them. \u201cOne of the widow\u2019s kids wouldn\u2019t stop bothering me this morning so I told him they eat children\u2019s fingers.\u201d\n \u201cThey eat?\u201d\n \u201cSometimes.\u201d He pointed down the road. \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk.\u201d\n We left his truck and headed toward where I was staying with Hano. On our way, we passed the old general\u2019s house. Some Ngo men were moving things inside, and a crowd had gathered behind them. They crossed their arms, passed chaw, and muttered darkly.\n Finally one of the Ngo men put down the crate he was carrying. He said something in Merais and flapped his hands to shoo them away. Grumbling, the crowd broke up.\n The old general\u2019s house was the fanciest building in Pon\u00e7an, but it had been empty as long as I\u2019d lived there. No one went in, even squatters. I looked up at Kwesi. He spoke Merais, and I didn\u2019t.\n \u201cHe told them they\u2019re being unreasonable,\u201d Kwesi said. \u201cHe says Ngo are trained to be careful.\u201d\n \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n \u201cStory goes the old general touched dragon blood and that\u2019s why he went mad. The house has been cleaned now.\u201d\n \u201cEnough?\u201d\n Kwesi shrugged, and offered me a cigarette.\n \u201cThis is what I say,\u201d he said, lighting it for me. \u201cYou should get out of here. Go to the capitol. You\u2019re smart, you can do whatever you want.\u201d\n I took a long drag. I had to balance the cigarette just so in my fingers to keep from bloodying the paper.\n He lit his own. \u201cI hear there\u2019s new Ngo money to send Rho to that school they have for kids who were changed like you.\u201d He paused to blow out a stream of smoke. \u201cYou should go, learn mathematics and become an accountant or a banker. You\u2019ll live in a big, white house, and have servants bring you drinks when it gets hot, eh?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s never enough Ngo money for everyone,\u201d I said.\n He tightened his lips around his cigarette and spoke from the side of his mouth. \u201cEnough for somebody, though. What\u2019s keeping you here?\u201d\n I thought of the muntjac and the ox.\n I stubbed out half the cigarette. \u201cI should find Hano.\u201d\n \u201cGive me a minute,\u201d Kwesi said. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d\n \u201cI can get the scales myself. I know how to handle them.\u201d\n Kwesi examined me for a second before deciding to back off. \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch here,\u201d he said, nodding to the old general\u2019s house. He raised his hand to say goodbye, and smoke trailed into cloudless violet.\n Early on, Hano, who has never been changed by a dragon, asked me, \u201cWhat happened to you, anyway? I didn\u2019t know anything could make you like that.\u201d\n He said it cheerfully, the way he\u2019d want to know how I could jump so high, or how big the cat was I\u2019d seen in the forest. Since he said it like that, I gave him half an answer.\n I remember just far enough back to know I was in a clearing with a sack. The clearing was thick with shed scales, more than I\u2019d ever seen. It was dangerous to go where they were so crowded since it was so easy to trip over one you didn\u2019t see, but I needed the money from bringing them home. I don\u2019t know why I needed it. I was thin when they found me, but I wasn\u2019t starving. Maybe I had siblings.\n Even then, I knew I was probably going to die that day. If not, then probably the next. I wrapped my feet in cloth even though it wouldn\u2019t do anything, and told myself I\u2019d be okay as long as I went slowly and made sure I could see exactly where I was stepping. I thought the silvery sheen to the ground was just the light reflecting off the grass. That was a stupid thing to think. I'd never seen grass reflect that way.\n Bits of purple sky reflected on the tin cans as I stood in our doorway, giving them to Hano. He shook them to hear how full they were, and said, \u201cYou see, we were lucky.\u201d Then he made me show him my hands and feet so he could see I didn\u2019t have any new cuts.\n I told him about the muntjac and the ox. He laughed. \u201cSome changes aren\u2019t so bad,\u201d he said.\n He looked at me when he said it.\n Thoughtfully, Hano asked, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s like this everywhere? Even in And\u00e9?\u201d\n I pulled back my hands, rubbing at the crusted blood. Hano frowned. I was supposed to let them scab when I could.\n \u201cWe\u2019re never going to And\u00e9. Why worry about it?\u201d\n \u201cThey have so many dragons in And\u00e9. It must be worse than here. Right?\u201d\n \u201cThere are a lot of places worse than here.\u201d\n \u201cMm,\u201d answered Hano, not quite agreeing. He hesitated, looking at the goods he had piled in the corner, his scavenge and my scales. He said, \u201cIf I were like you, I could go to the capitol.\u201d\n The turn surprised me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to Kwesi.\u201d\n \u201cIf Ngo has money, why not take it?\u201d\n \u201cIf Ngo has money.\u201d\n \u201cIf I was like you, we could go to the capitol together.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not like me. Why worry about it?\u201d\n Hano stared at our goods for a while as the quiet grew. The Hizhang cows lowed, and the sky finally let go of purple and went grey. We heard old men walking past, one of them telling a joke.\n Life in Pon\u00e7an is not so bad. Eventually, Hano took a dented can from our personal stash, and opened it for us to share.\n Hano almost died yesterday. He laughed about it but his laughter was shaky.\n He had been sleeping at his cousins\u2019, close to the center of Pon\u00e7an. They were paying him to help with repairs. It happened just before dawn, when most people were sleeping. He found me outside, eating breakfast, not even knowing something was wrong.\n \u201cSome white Ngo, straight from Merre,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey gave him the old general\u2019s house, and in the back of the closet, he found the old general\u2019s uniform.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I knew the answer was yes.\n Hano gave his choked laugh again. \u201cHe put it on. He put it on.\u201d\n After that, the Merais man really had no choice. The jacket made him take the rifle the dead general had left, and it made him go outside and fire it through the walls into the houses. Hano had been asleep, but the noise gave him enough time to throw himself to the ground and cover his head with his hands. A bullet bit his shoulder, but when the bullets ran out, he was still alive. The Ngo doctor bandaged him up.\n Hano was wheezing, but he tried to keep laughing, too. \u201cThe shots stopped, but I was afraid to go out until I heard that old widow shouting at him. I finally peeked out the door and saw her beating him, head and shoulders, with a pan. He was just standing there. The jacket still had him. Bang. Bang. Her face was so red! Kwesi had to pull her off so she didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d\n He tried to keep laughing.\n Kwesi was dead by the time he stopped the old widow, of course. One of the general\u2019s bullets went through his eye. He just hadn\u2019t been the kind of man to leave something undone that needed doing. Once he\u2019d saved the Merais man\u2019s life, he laid down and went back to being dead.\n \u201cThe widow said, at least Kwesi\u2019s mother would always know where he was now\u2014\u201d\n Hano was still trying to laugh when we heard the cry.\n He clamped his mouth shut and so did I. We turned as silently as we could, searching for the flare of the burning child. I heard each swsh of my shoes.\n Suddenly, Hano smacked his hand against his leg. Shrieks of laughter ripped their way out of him.\n I followed his pointing finger toward a live child. She was crying, but not burning. A woman had come to comfort her.\n Hano\u2019s laughter cut off abruptly. His voice went flat and quiet. \u201cI hate this haunted village,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate this haunted country and I hate this haunted world.\u201d\n Today was for selling, not gathering, but I went out anyway. I left before Hano woke up. Since the shooting, his eyes had been dull, yet he watched me. He wanted something from me and I thought I knew what.\n He hadn\u2019t found me more cans yet, but I could manage scales. I wrapped my hands for whatever help it would give me, and went into the forest.\n The sky was the color of old bones. Orange clouds hovered, unmoving. The sweet-smelling trees were oddly quiet as if the animals were holding their breaths. Fleeing birds broke the silence as they cut into the air.\n Between the sweet-smelling trees, I saw the muntjac with the ox. The muntjac\u2019s teeth were bloody. When it raised its head to glare at me, the skin of its face pulled backward like the grimace of a bat.\n The muntjac kept changing. The ox, lingering on, gave up its meat like the Hizhang cows.\n Truthfully, I remember a few torn things. I remember a picture of a tall woman putting her arms around one of the burning children. She must have died, but I don\u2019t remember that part. My father died from an infection that started in his foot, but that\u2019s all I know. It\u2019s just words. I don\u2019t remember why or how.\n The dragons didn\u2019t take my memory. I let it go myself. I was staring at the ripped-up ceiling of Kwesi\u2019s truck, and the road\u2019s giant hand was shaking me apart. I thought why not let go, why not be easy for a while? I was probably going to die that day. If not, then probably the next.\n The sun was so, so bright, and I gave every memory to the leaf-green sky.\n I found Hano by the Ngo dump, with nothing in his hands, staring in the direction of the old general\u2019s house. Kwesi had gotten up to help dig his own grave.\n I told him the other half of the answer to a question he\u2019d asked long ago.\n It happens sometimes that when the dragons\u2019 poison seeps inside you, you see what they\u2019ve seen, feel what they\u2019ve felt. So: It was late in the war, under a swallowing half-moon. The air was heavy without rain, and the moon was shining down and the blades of grass looked like bayonets. And the leaves of the trees hung down like swords. And the night was silver-black like drowning. And I came to the clearing.\n And I was tired. My mouth too much fire, my stomach empty, my scales split from firecracker whips. I did not know the And\u00e9 were the And\u00e9, or the Zhie were the Zhie, or anything about the Rho. I knew the whips that drove me north and north and north, and I couldn\u2019t sleep. So I came to sleep.\n And I laid my body among the bayonets.\n And the breath from my nostrils went deep into the earth and made pearl garlic grow.\n And my weight settled through my body and turned the soil into granite.\n And I did not dream.\n The Hizhang cows were still screaming even though it was already night because that was the first night the Hizhang cows screamed. I heard the vibrations of my sisters\u2019 and brothers\u2019 frustration as they were unleashed to kill, but never to feed enough to take away their hunger. And like them, I was hungry, and I stretched upward.\n And I saw my reflection standing in open air. I saw his hollow stomach, and whip-cracked scales. I saw his wild eyes.\n So, again: As that other dragon, I was driven by the gnawing in my stomach. I came to the clearing searching for meat, but instead I came upon my reflection. Pearl garlic frothed on the granite beneath her.\n I had been driven ten days without stopping. I was ready to kill everything in my path, I was ready to kill the And\u00e9, but the And\u00e9 were never in front of me, only behind me, with their whips snapping at my tail.\n So, a third time: Both dragons, I circled inward, drawn in by my reflection\u2019s scent loosed in the night. We came closer, and we came closer again. Necks twined. My teeth flashed and blood flowed down two throats. Talons scraped and grasped. Tails swept the remaining grass from the ground and the swords from the trees.\n Two dragons together, then two dragons each other, then twodragon rolling in itself. Hunger met with sating, sating met with hunger. For the first time since the And\u00e9\u2019s bite, I was full.\n And then And\u00e9 herders came with the sun in the durian sky, and they took after me with their firecracker whips. I became two again, and I and I left this place, leaving silver mist behind us.\n It was a long time before human-me was born, and lived a life, and forgot that life, and lived another life in Pon\u00e7an, but those things eventually happened, and left me by the dump with Hano.\n Hano has never been changed by a dragon, but he doesn\u2019t need to be. He has a bullet wound in his shoulder. He knows what to expect.\n I told Hano, \u201cIt hurts to change the way I did.\u201d\n He kept looking at me, expression no different than it was before.\n \u201cThey might do surgery to you. Make you a girl.\u201d\n He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201d\n Life is not so bad in Pon\u00e7an. The roads going north are full of bandits. Where there are no bandits, there are dragon leavings worse than scales. Still, I said, \u201cTomorrow, then.\u201d\n Hano wasn\u2019t ready to laugh again, but the edges of his lips made an almost-smile.\n My name is Domei.

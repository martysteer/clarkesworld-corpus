He had been haunting my thoughts since we received Uncle Jamey\u2019s emails and the plane tickets. Now, everyone gathered at our mother\u2019s house, my childhood home, to come to a decision.\nWe barely said anything as we ate. Of the five of us, DD was the only one who had already made up her mind.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go. Even if you guys decide you\u2019re not,\u201d she had confided in me the night before, as we struggled to get any sleep in her bed\u2014our twin nieces were sleeping in my old bedroom. In the darkness, she carefully scanned my face, waiting for a reaction; wanting to know if I was on board, or if I\u2019d been wounded by her decision.\n\u201cWhy do you think Mom keeps our bedrooms like this? Like time hasn\u2019t passed,\u201d she asked, as if sensing the need to change the subject.\n\u201cBecause of Joan Didion,\u201d I said, almost automatically.\n\u201cJoan Didion?\u201d\n\u201cJoan Didion said a girl should always have a room in her mother\u2019s house. Even when she\u2019s all grown up. Something like that.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\u201cShe did.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere. Some book. Some interview. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d I had no idea if that was true. I knew Joan Didion said something in those lines; I\u2019d learned so from a book. But I had no idea if my mother had ever read Didion, her own words or her words told by others. Suddenly, though, the association seemed inescapable and true. Of course that was why my mother kept our rooms for us, her girls; every mother kept her daughter\u2019s room, in a way or another. Every mother kept waiting for a child to return.\nDD stayed quiet for a while. I closed my eyes.\n\u201cDo you think they kept his room the same? You think they\u2019ll bring him back to, you know . . . their house?\u201d DD asked. But my eyes remained shut. I pretended to be asleep so I wouldn\u2019t have to answer her. The answer, had I told her, would be, plainly: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\nDuring that quiet dinner, one of our last before the flight was scheduled to leave, Gray broke the silence, calmly stating his thoughts over the clicking of chopsticks as we consumed our delivered Chinese food:\n\u201cWe should go. I think we owe it to Uncle Jamey. I mean, he wants us to be a part of it.\u201d He cleared his throat, as if to say more, but decided not to, stuffing his mouth with a dumpling and chewing as gently as possible.\n\u201cI agree,\u201d my mother said. She didn\u2019t look at us. She seemed relaxed right now, strangely absent.\nWhen I first got here, when I held her in my arms for an embrace, she seemed about to dissolve, turning into white smoke and escaping through my fingers. We sat by the kitchen counter. \u201cCoffee?\u201d she suggested. I said yes, for no good reason. My stomach felt like an enemy for the last few days. Ever since I got the email and read it and reread it.\n\u201cDid you know?\u201d I asked. The very first question, as my mother filled my cup with instant coffee. I watched her attentively, afraid she still could disappear, leaving behind nothing but her clothes. Everything about my reality seemed at risk of disappearing that first day\u2014and in the days that came next. The edges of the world were blurred. As I drove to my mother\u2019s house, it felt like I wasn\u2019t driving at all, but being guided by some energy that made me lose any sense of time. Usually driving to Mom\u2019s house would take me twenty to thirty minutes. That day, I had the impression barely five minutes had passed between leaving my apartment in the city and parking the car in front of our old house\u2019s garage.\n\u201cNo,\u201d my mother said. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIs he serious about it?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s done it. I think this answers your question, Mia.\u201d\nI felt a lump in my throat. Instinctively, my mother let her own cup rest on the sink and hugged me. She was solid. She wasn\u2019t going to disappear. I must have sobbed in relief, because she patted my back and said it was OK. \u201cI should have offered you tea,\u201d she said, and then laughed.\nDD joined us an hour later, bringing in a big, pink suitcase, and Gray and Maura and the twins came in the next morning, after a long flight from California; my nieces were finicky, annoyed at that sudden emergency trip. They wanted to go to Disney.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Disney. It\u2019s more special than Disney,\u201d Maura would say, and then she\u2019d look at me as if asking for some guidance. How could I even begin to explain what was happening? My nieces had never met Charlie, they had no idea what any of that meant. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be a beach, and you and your aunts DD and Mia can play the whole day,\u201d my sister-in-law added. \u201cHey, maybe you can even play with dolphins.\u201d Were there dolphins at the island? I didn\u2019t know. It had no name, the island; at least the papers never mentioned a name. I couldn\u2019t Google it. I couldn\u2019t find any information on its precise location among the other Caribbean islands.\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d I finally said, during that last dinner, after Gray and Mom had made their opinions known. My family seemed a bit surprised\u2014either by the high pitch I\u2019d used when announcing my decision, or by the decision itself. My brother\u2019s sad brown eyes, Mom\u2019s alert expression . . . they watched me, afraid I\u2019d break into pieces. But I\u2019d compromised. I said the words.\nThat night, back in our shared bed, DD said, \u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d She held my face in her hands and her blue eyes stared deep into my soul.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\n\u201cI do. If Uncle Jamey didn\u2019t want me there, he wouldn\u2019t have invited me.\u201d This was the truth I had been avoiding. Uncle Jamey wanted me to go. Uncle Jamey wrote my name. He somehow had my email; he sent me the papers and the ticket. And the paperwork seemed to be never-ending. We signed the nondisclosure agreements, we pawned our souls to those rules. The five of us decided to go.\n\u201cThen we\u2019re doing it together,\u201d DD said, while in bed, stroking my cold cheeks.\nCharlie was the first boy I ever kissed. I knew there was something inherently wrong about kissing your own cousin. But at twelve, I\u2019d been devouring historical fiction and biographies of great women and queens; I\u2019d been drowning in nineteenth century romances I still didn\u2019t fully understand, and the idea of kissing your cousin, even marrying him, didn\u2019t seem so strange.\nCharlie and I were more than just cousins, truth to be told: we\u2019re almost twins. Born in the same year, just a few months apart, we\u2019d run with nothing but diapers on in my parents\u2019 house, and in Uncle Jamey\u2019s apartment in New York. During childhood, we\u2019d rather play with each other than with other kids our age. Charlie and I were made of the same material and the same blood. I could predict his reactions before he\u2019d speak, I could read his mind like I could read the palm of his hand, every line and scar.\nOn the day I kissed Charlie, during our summer vacation, watching the glimmer of the lake right in front of the cabin my father usually rented, we had been swimming for a good part of the morning, and the sun added a sheen of gold to Charlie\u2019s brown skin, his damp curls darker than ever. I kissed him when no one was looking; behind a tree, where I took a break to hide, believing my flowery bikini made me look stupid and childish near Charlie\u2019s changing body, the height and the lean muscles he had been gaining during that summer, puberty making him more and more of a young man than a boy.\nHe came to check on me, ask me if I was OK, and I said yes. He told me to come and join them: he, Gray, and DD, by the lake. Charlie gave me his hand. As I took it and got up, it happened: I kissed him. Standing at the tip of my toes, our lips touching for a brief moment. I couldn\u2019t taste him properly. I tasted the water instead, and a bit of shame.\nHis brown eyes widened with surprise as I stepped back, astonished at what I\u2019d just done.\nBut Charlie laughed. A kind laugh: such a rare thing to hear from a boy.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nHe kept his promise. Summer was reality suspended. It was another world, after all.\nWe went back to the water. We dared ourselves to swim faster than the other. Charlie would always win, but still we played the game. He\u2019d beat Gray and even me, the best swimmer among my siblings. We\u2019d blink and there he\u2019d be: Charlie, in the far distance, a dot in the immensity of the lake, waving at us.\nMiami: we boarded our chartered plane. DD held my hand until both our palms were sweaty. My mother was a bit more pragmatic: she popped some pills as soon as we left Philadelphia and slept for the most part of the first flight. Going into the chartered plane, she moved in a bit of a lethargy, as if entering a dream.\n\u201cShe\u2019s so high on her meds right now,\u201d DD joked.\nMy nieces were the only ones that had some sort of fun. They\u2019d press their faces against the window and pretend to see heaven.\n\u201cMama, where are the angels?\u201d they\u2019d asked.\n\u201cThey live up above, darlings. You can\u2019t see them from here,\u201d Maura said. \u201cDon\u2019t stare at the sun. It will hurt your eyes.\u201d\nAngels. Angels and miracles. My head was suddenly filled by a distant choir of plump cherubs. I laughed, instinctively. The last night, I packed my bags as if I were going on a vacation. Swimsuits. Denim. Dresses. I wasn\u2019t sure of what I was doing. I should have thought of a nun habit, something appropriate to witnessing a miracle. This wasn\u2019t a vacation.\nBut the island we landed on was everything you could expect from the perfect vacation spot. Caribbean blue sea and white and hot sand. People stretching on folding chairs by the beach and having colorful drinks served by men dressed in blue aprons. A big, luxurious resort, the color of cream\u2014the color of sand\u2014that wasn\u2019t really a resort: it was the Clinic, my mother said. The biggest building on the whole island, with French windows and large verandas from where you could appreciate the view. Behind the great wooden doors, already opened to us, we were greeted by a life-sized reproduction of Michelangelo\u2019s David, and I tried not to snort. Only later, when we already had a room for ourselves, DD would say: \u201cVery \u2018in your face,\u2019 don\u2019t you think?\u201d She meant what they did in the Clinic, and how David encapsulated it perfectly.\n\u201cWe are Jamey Ocampo\u2019s guests,\u201d my mother said to the receptionist, who then produced even more paperwork waiting for our signatures. Women in dark blue, with harmless expressions, confiscated my nieces\u2019 iPads and everyone\u2019s phones. The suite I\u2019d be sharing with DD was huge. The size of the bathroom, with a bathtub big enough for both of us. The tasteful, but meaningless art displayed on the white walls; everything white, as pure snow.\n\u201cI feel like Kate Middleton. You know what Tamsyn would say, right? \u2018Oh, Adelia. They tricked you and locked you in a rehabilitation center,\u2019\u201d My sister\u2019s girlfriend was the only one who ever called her Adelia, the name that had belonged to our Brazilian great-grandmother. She\u2019d always been DD or Dee to us.\nDD and I were always easily mistaken as everyday white American girls; with our blonde hair and blue eyes, our pale glowing skin and the gentle freckles covering her nose and cheeks. DD was shorter than I was, busty, whereas I\u2019d always been slender and lacking any breasts. But we\u2019re undeniably sisters, cut from the same tree, from our dad\u2019s DNA. Gray was the one with the dark eyes and the dark hair of our dead grandfather and Uncle Jamey; Gray was one who even remotely looked like an Ocampo.\nHe knocked on our door. The door wasn\u2019t locked, so he turned the knob and shyly pried in. \u201cUncle Jamey is waiting for us.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d DD singsonged. Once Gray was gone, she held my shoulders and said, like an old incantation, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\nUncle Jamey and Aunt Sarita were waiting at the beach. Aunt Sarita, hiding behind huge sunglasses, lifted one thin arm and waved at our little procession, while Uncle Jamey came ambling over the sand for a proper greet. He first hugged Mom, and then Gray; he messed with my nieces\u2019 hair and then kissed Maura\u2019s cheeks. He said to DD:\n\u201cMy God, you grew up.\u201d\nAnd, as for me: he embraced me as if I were his long-lost daughter. I froze. The last time Uncle Jamey touched me, his fingers felt like they wanted to break me in pieces.\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re all here,\u201d he said to everyone, once our embrace was over.\nUncle Jamey had gained some weight. His wrinkled face was tanned enough, like rough leather, beard and hair still mostly black, a few patches of white making a discreet appearance. He was built like a bear, my uncle. Not that tall, but burly. And there was my Aunt Sarita: she rose up from a white folding chair and approached us, holding a drink in one hand, using her free hand to distribute half-hugs. Aunt Sarita looked better than ever. The last time I saw her, she might as well have been a ghost of herself, skinny and all bones. But now she smiled; now, she kissed us. And her black skin was dewy and beautiful, her lips glossy from all the protective balm I imagined she must have been wearing.\nWhen my grandparents first arrived in the United States, when they disembarked in Miami and inhaled the American air, they had two rules: that their children, Uncle Jamey and Mom, should get an education (Uncle Jamey told us that), and that they should marry good, white Americans (my mother told us that, her lips curling as if in a snarl). My grandparents had old money and a shame that stuck to them as if a shadow. Shame of being South Americans. White South Americans, but South Americans nonetheless. Am\u00e9rica Latrina, they would say of the place they\u2019d left. A shithole. They held on to their whiteness as if holding on to gold; for in the far south of the Americas, whiteness was sometimes more valuable than money, and they wanted their children to marry white Anglo-Saxon people and have white babies, so maybe one day they would forget about where they had come from.\nMy father was white. White and blonde, as American as apple pie\u2014the kind of American my grandparents envisioned and wanted for their daughter. Reliable as plain bread.\nBut Aunt Sarita was an African-American woman, and my grandparents never hid their displeasure. They threatened not to show up for the wedding. They tried every emotional blackmail they could come up with. In the end, they relented; because Uncle Jamey was as stubborn as every Ocampo and would have his way. My grandparents were at the wedding, sitting silently, holding hands and barely glancing at Aunt Sarita\u2019s family.\n\u201cWhen you grow up, you understand your parents are only human, and that being human is an ugly business,\u201d my mother told me one day, the same day she decided to explain it all\u2014my grandparents\u2019 shame, their racism. I was sixteen. My grandmother had recently died, while my grandfather had been dead for years. \u201cYou and Dee and Gray must have come to this same conclusion, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cYou and Dad aren\u2019t assholes or bigots,\u201d I jumped to their defense.\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Her voice was low, almost fading.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cAssholes,\u201d she whispered, as if my dead grandmother was standing right in the next room, ears pressed against the wall.\nMy grandmother\u2019s last days had been tough and, as we spoke, my mother had a bit of bourbon\u2014something she wouldn\u2019t do in front of my father, in the same fashion DD and I would hide our casual smoking from her. My grandmother had spent her last three years in a retirement institution, exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior. She was often hostile when my mother and I went to visit, bringing flowers she\u2019d dismiss with the movement of a hand covered with aging spots. She\u2019d say how ungrateful my mother had been. How Uncle Jamey never paid her a visit, and neither of her grandchildren\u2014Gray and I\u2014did (she barely complained about DD; since DD had come out as a lesbian, at age thirteen, coming down the stairs with a cardboard covered with glitter that said \u201cI\u2019M A LESBIAN,\u201d surprising no one, my grandmother, once hearing the news, had pretended DD didn\u2019t exist anymore).\nMy mother sighed softly. I wasn\u2019t sure if she was drinking because she was sad or because she was relieved her mother was finally gone. Maybe both. As much as we tried not to, we\u2019d always make excuses for our parents\u2019 behavior, even when they hurt us. During the twilight of a dying parent\u2019s life, we\u2019d airbrush whatever we could.\nBut parents did the same with their children, I thought. Every big flaw swept under the carpet, every minor good magnified and turned into glory. When we are yet to be born, just tiny tadpoles swimming inside our mother\u2019s belly, our parents already dream wonderful things about us, about the people we will become. Before our first breath their mind is already spinning stories for these fictional selves they imagine we\u2019ll be one day.\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d my mother asked Aunt Sarita.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll meet him soon. Dinner? Tonight?\u201d she said, like it was a casual invitation and not what had brought us there in the first place. \u201cOh, look at them. These babies!\u201d Aunt Sarita bent in front of my nieces and cupped their plump cheeks with her hands, passing on her glass to Uncle Jamey. My nieces were strangely silent. Maybe Maura had warned them.\nWhen Aunt Sarita straightened herself again, it hit me that she might have been drunk. All the good humor and the kissing, and the way her feet danced over the sand when she took a few steps back, Uncle Jamey holding her by the elbow . . .\n\u201cThis place is beautiful. It\u2019s paradise. You\u2019ll love it,\u201d she said.\nDD whispered to my ear:\n\u201cIs that one of them?\u201d\nIn the distance, a man and a girl meandered by the shore. The man was dressed like your average middle-aged white tourist: flowery shirt and khaki shorts. He had gray hair and a pink face drenched with too much sun. The girl wore a white dress that the wind waved gently. Father and daughter, I concluded.\n\u201cI think so,\u201d I said to DD.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d DD\u2019s whisper was ever lower that time.\nI put on a new dress. Black but ordinary: a dress that stated nothing beyond its pristine shape. New. Adequate.\nI combed my wet blonde hair and then sat at the edge of my big bed, waiting for DD. I remembered my breathing exercises, the ones I learned years ago while in therapy, and put them to good use.\nDD caught me in the midst of it. She thought I was having a panic attack.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be that bad, I swear,\u201d DD said, holding my hands, forcing me to get up in a single movement, as if asking me for a dance. And I believed her, because I would have grabbed on to any promise at that point.\nUncle Jamey and Aunt Sarita had a whole apartment inside the clinic. A large place with white walls, three bedrooms, a long dining table, and chandeliers.\nIn one corner of the living room, there was a black grand piano. The ghost before the real ghost. Breathe, I told myself. Just breathe.\nWe\u2019re served beautiful seafood cooked to a lovely point of tenderness, the only sound the cracking of their hard shells, buttery sauce dripping from spoons we used to help ourselves. I barely ate. The shrimp tasted good and tasted like paper at the same time. I wished for nothing but one of my father\u2019s spaghetti, the creamy tomato sauce I had been raised on. With my fork, I pushed the food aside; and then to the other side; I considered the shape of those creatures that had once lived underwater, in the silence of the deep sea, unaware of the things that haunted us, human beings.\n\u201cHere he comes,\u201d Aunt Sarita said, and I froze.\nAnd here he came: the final ghost. A boy with dark skin, skin that under that low light shone like bronze. A boy dressed in white. That easy and benevolent smile. The shyness as he stopped and stared at us, looking for . . . permission, I imagined.\n\u201cSit, darling,\u201d Aunt Sarita said. We were unable to utter a single word. Our eyes were locked on the impossible figure before us. Charlie reborn; Charlie made himself again, as David sculpted from marble, from his smooth curly hair to the dimples that only ever revealed themselves when he couldn\u2019t contain a smile. And he looked at us as if we were somehow a miracle too. Aunt Sarita gestured at a chair and he sat down. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Aunt Sarita asked, and Charlie shook his head and laughed\u2014Charlie\u2019s laugh. Aunt Sarita got him a bit of everything, and Charlie took his knife and fork and ate slowly. A hint of surprise here and there; as if the taste was something new and magical.\n\u201cCan you eat real food?\u201d one of my nieces asked.\nThe unexpectedness of that particular question forced DD to hide a laugh. Gray shot a look at Maura, whose face was now red. So she had told the twins what this new Charlie was.\n\u201cYes, of course I can,\u201d Charlie said, smiling again. \u201cI know your names. Megan and Ines, right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Ines,\u201d Ines said. \u201cShe\u2019s Megan.\u201d And she touched her sister\u2019s head.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re my cousins. Gray, Mia, and Adelia. Did I get it right?\u201d Charlie said. When he said my name and looked at me, I couldn\u2019t help myself. A storm had been brewing inside my stomach. I tried to smile and too late noticed I was crying. DD made a move; rose from her chair, trying to hand me a napkin, but I was already standing and running from the apartment. I puked inside a vase.\nCharlie died when we were both eighteen. He already looked like the man I had merely glimpsed that day by the lake, when I kissed him.\nMother told us Charlie would be spending part of that summer with us.\n\u201cWhat, he\u2019s not going to Aspen this time?\u201d Gray asked, somewhat resentfully.\n\u201cCharlie\u2019s having some problems back home. So let\u2019s make him feel welcome, OK?\u201d Mom said. Gray mumbled something, his shoulders moved, and we took that as agreement. He\u2019d held a tiny grudge against Charlie ever since they were young. It hadn\u2019t as much to do with Charlie himself than as with Uncle Jamey\u2019s money. Uncle Jamey was undeniably rich; he had taken his part of the money our dead grandfather granted him and multiplied it, turning water into wine. He bought companies and then sold them. And then he bought more companies and sold them too. Whenever asked what his father did for a living, Charlie would look disarmed and, in an indifferent voice, simply say: \u201cMy father buys stuff.\u201d\nMom had used her money to invest in Dad\u2019s restaurant. It was a smart move by any account. Nothing ever lacked us. We lived in a good house in Philadelphia and we vacationed every year. Our tuitions were guaranteed. We\u2019d been hit by recession here and there, and Mom\u2019s money always saved us, and Dad managed to stay in business while we sailed through every storm.\n\u201cHe can have my room,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMaybe I should go back to San Francisco earlier.\u201d Gray was a sophomore in Santa Clara University; he was back for the summer so he could help Dad with the restaurant\u2014but he had longed dreamed of a summer job away from the kitchen and the sweet smell of pasta sauce\u2014away from us.\nWhen Dad brought Charlie from the airport, Charlie had a duffel bag and a purplish eye.\n\u201cOh, my God. Charlie, dear,\u201d Mom said, bringing him in. Charlie was quiet. Mother sat him on a kitchen chair and ran and gave him a glass of water. DD and I peered by the kitchen entry, but said nothing, and Charlie seemed too ashamed to look at us. \u201cLet me get some ice,\u201d Mother said.\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s old,\u201d Charlie said, and managed to laugh a little bit\u2014a weak laugh, while he still looked at the floor.\n\u201cUncle Jamey did that?\u201d I asked.\nCharlie shrugged. I couldn\u2019t picture Uncle Jamey hitting him; not Charlie, whom he loved so much. And I certainly couldn\u2019t picture Charlie, with his smooth hands, hands made for playing the piano, fighting back.\nA story came to my mind: something my mother had told me a few years ago. Once, when she was little, and the family was having dinner, Uncle Jamey tried to impress my grandfather by saying a few words of Portuguese he\u2019d been learning by himself. My grandfather\u2019s face went blank for a second. He got up, and Uncle Jamey felt proud, like he was going to be congratulated, but then my grandfather slapped Uncle Jamey\u2019s face so hard his palm was imprinted on the boy\u2019s skin in an ugly red color. \u201cOnly English,\u201d Grandfather had said, before sitting down again. My mother remembered trembling, She remembered trying not to cry, afraid she could be slapped for that to.\nCharlie\u2019s hand was also scraped. Only the right hand.\n\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d I asked, my voice angry. But Charlie looked at the scrapes and said: \u201cNo, that was me. I did this.\u201d\nThe nature of Uncle Jamey\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s fight\u2014disagreement, Uncle Jamey would have said\u2014had to do with Charlie\u2019s insistence on not going to Juilliard. Not so soon, at least. Charlie wanted to travel the world. He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to play the piano as a way of living. Uncle Jamey was furious. You\u2019re an artist, he had said. I play because you always wanted me to, Charlie retorted. At some point, frustrated, Charlie punched a wall. A gesture, he\u2019d say, that looked much simpler\u2014and more dramatic\u2014in the movies, and that he instantly regretted. And as soon as he backed up from the wall, holding his fist in pain, Uncle Jamey struck him. Not with a slap, but with a punch. That punch made Charlie\u2019s world become a fast, nauseous merry-go-round. It made him see the black of an infinite universe, the explosions of little stars. Aunt Sarita was screaming in the background, and yet the world kept spinning, that living room, the stars, the darkness. When Charlie came to himself again, lying on the floor, Uncle Jamey was standing before him, panting, face as red as a tomato. Charlie thought his father was having a heart attack. Aunt Sarita was cradling Charlie\u2019s head in her arms, yelling at Uncle Jamey, telling him to stay away.\nFor a second or two, everything had gone black and then there was his father, a look of unspeakable horror on his face, as if he hadn\u2019t known up to that point the kind of violence he could commit against his own child.\n\u201cCharlie really likes being with you. And he just needs time. Both of them do,\u201d Aunt Sarita had told Mom on the phone.\nAnd so we had Charlie for the summer\u2014another summer. Upon seeing Charlie\u2019s face, the damage against his flesh, Gray simply said: \u201cYou can have my bedroom. I\u2019ll sleep in the basement.\u201d\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Charlie said.\n\u201cNo, really. It\u2019s fine,\u201d and Gray waved his hand; waving away Charlie\u2019s concern and, I wondered, whatever previous opinion he\u2019d held.\nIt was a good month. Nothing remarkable about those earlier days. It was my last summer at home after graduating from high school and soon enough I\u2019d be a freshman at Penn. For a long time, I considered getting a major in history. But now I wanted to study Latin American cultures (which no doubt would have my grandparents rolling in their graves). I felt happy; I felt things were getting into their rightful place. Charlie\u2019s presence seemed to confirm my feelings. He made the house whole, somehow. I had long gotten over my teenage crush, but he was always my confidant. For him, I had always felt a camaraderie I could never feel for Gray. I could pour my heart out to Charlie and get no judgment, and he\u2019d do the same. I could share with him things I thought I couldn\u2019t share even with DD. Our many emails and texts exchanges over the years proved it so. I knew the Charlie behind the serene fa\u00e7ade, the Charlie that wanted things. Things he had locked inside of himself, things he was afraid of sharing with anybody, least of all his parents. Charlie\u2019s silence was not passive; Charlie\u2019s silence was hunger, and that was the biggest truth I ever knew about my cousin.\nThroughout those weeks, we helped Dad with the restaurant. Charlie proudly wore his black apron and learned how to attend on tables. The best pasta you could eat in Philadelphia; in Dad\u2019s mind, that\u2019s what the restaurant meant. He taught Charlie the basics of a good Bolognese and how to make gnocchi from scratch. Charlie loved, laughed at his mistakes, his fingers white with flour. On Sundays, we\u2019d help Dad and Mom at a soup kitchen my parents volunteered at, where Charlie would flash his smile at every guest, holding their hands and leading them to vacant tables\u2014old people, homeless people. We learned never to ask questions. The new ones, they would appear by the door almost shyly\u2014as if they weren\u2019t sure they should even be there\u2014speaking in a low tone of voice and avoiding eye contact. But Charlie\u2019s smile was so infectious he could make people he had just met laugh at a comment or two.\nWhen Charlie\u2019s birthday came, we baked him a big cake with a lot of buttercream. We lit candles and sang Happy Birthday. There was talk of spending a few days at the lake house again, and I wondered how that would play: if we\u2019d still be like kids, competing to see who could swim faster, who could master the waters. We\u2019d never be like this again, together like that again, my siblings and I; Charlie and us.\nAfter the party, Gray smuggled us a few beers and we drank them in the backyard, DD, Charlie, and I with our feet inside the pool.\n\u201cDo you really hate playing the piano?\u201d Gray asked, walking shoeless on the short grass.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I see myself as a pianist. If that makes any sense.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you see yourself as?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI have no idea. Really.\u201d And Charlie laughed. \u201cI think I was supposed to. I mean, you guys know what you want, right? Your calling.\u201d\n\u201cNah. I want money. That\u2019s not the same as having a calling,\u201d said Gray.\n\u201cI want to travel the world,\u201d said DD. She was sixteen, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be having alcohol\u2014none of us was, except for Gray\u2014but there she was, and there we were. \u201cI want to save orcas.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s more of a calling,\u201d Gray pointed.\n\u201cI wish I could travel the world, too,\u201d said Charlie.\n\u201cCome on. You have been up and down the country,\u201d said Gray. \u201cYou have seen all of America, all of Europe . . . \u201d\nBut Charlie was shaking his head. \u201cNot the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI went wherever my dad wanted me to go.\u201d\nWe knew Uncle Jamey; we knew him enough, so Gray didn\u2019t press on. Instead, he approached DD and snatched her bottle of beer. DD let out a loud complaint, but then, afraid Mom and Dad could listen and come and check whatever we were doing, she covered her mouth with both hands.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had enough,\u201d Gray said, going back to the house. DD got up and went after him, silently cursing Gray.\n\u201cI wish I could spend more time with you guys,\u201d Charlie said, after a while, just the two of us left. \u201cYou\u2019re so . . . normal.\u201d\n\u201cCharlie, we\u2019re anything but normal,\u201d I said. After so long, he should\u2019ve known. Mom\u2019s drinking, my parents\u2019 constant fights, Dad\u2019s cheating.\nI had told him all about it, sometimes tearfully typing emails, sometimes casually texting\u2014when my family shenanigans couldn\u2019t affect me anymore, when the wounds of a fight or an argument had already healed.\n\u201cYou baked me a cake,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cNobody ever baked me a cake.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to your birthday parties, Charlie. There was plenty of cake, always.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s different. Mom has our cakes delivered from the best bakeries in the city and then she dresses like it\u2019s . . . \u201d\n\u201cA party?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll serve champagne; but she\u2019ll side-eye me if I even touch a can of soda\u2014unhealthy, bad for your skin, bad for your brain. She\u2019s even weird about coffee. She thinks I\u2019ll turn into a zombie and trade the day for the night if I get too caffeinated, and then I won\u2019t play good enough, or I won\u2019t be good enough.\u201d\n\u201cOh, poor Charlie. Poor Charlie and his rich parents.\u201d\n\u201cI understand my privileges, Mia. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d give up on that and, I don\u2019t know . . . go and die inside a bus lost in Alaska. But . . . \u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nHe tried to come up with an explanation; in the end, he said nothing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, Charlie.\u201d I clinked my bottle against his, in a salute. Charlie clinked back, and that was enough. The night had turned the sky purple. Then, it had made it into an inescapable dark blue. I wish I could have stopped time that night. I wish Charlie and I could have stayed in there forever.\n\u201cDrink it,\u201d DD said, pushing the glass of water into my hands. I felt a sweat cold and sticky against my neck. DD gave me a pill and made me lay down on my bed when I finally swallowed her enchantments, produced from little white bottles lifted from the madness inside her suitcase.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that,\u201d I said. I felt feverish, too; and I wonder if there was something accusing in my eyes, because DD hesitated a bit.\n\u201cI know I said it would be OK, but you know what? You can\u2019t really plan for shit like this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happens. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fine. Uncle Jamey and Aunt Sarita must hate me more than ever.\u201d\nDD didn\u2019t dignify me with a response. She covered my body, now half-naked, only my bra and panties on, and tucked me in as if I were her baby.\nI slept fast enough, deployed of any energy. At some point, I felt my mother entering the room and sitting by my side, smoothing my hair as she once did when I was a child, and then a teen. I imagined I heard her voice, speaking softly to DD, and DD answering in the same way, maybe afraid they would wake me up. And then: darkness. No dreams, not a soothing sleep. Just darkness.\nI woke up feeling my throat sore. DD wasn\u2019t in the room, so I put on some jeans and an old tank top and left. I didn\u2019t go to Uncle Jamey\u2019s apartment. The mere thought of it, of facing him and Aunt Sarita again, made me sick. I went to the large veranda the Clinic had, with tall white pillars and cushioned wicker chairs. A man in a blue apron appeared as if out of nowhere and asked me if I wanted a drink. I ordered some orange juice.\nI could see the beach from where I sat. I could see DD playing with the twins on the sand.\nAnd then: my heart almost skipped a beat when I saw Charlie leaving the water, getting his curls away from his face. He had a companion. The girl DD and I had seen when we first arrived, walking with her father. Only the girl wasn\u2019t exactly a girl. Next to Charlie, she seemed a bit older. More of my age, in her late twenties or very early thirties, than Charlie\u2019s eighteen. They were talking at ease, laughing; Charlie seemed far more relaxed than he was at dinner, and I pulled my knees to myself and watched the scene as if I were watching a romance movie. There was something sweet about it.\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\nI turned my head and saw the girl\u2019s father sitting down on another wicker chair. His day had certainly come to a fast start: he held a sweaty glass of margarita, his red face more wrinkled than I\u2019d imagined. We were watching the same thing: Charlie and the girl getting out of the water, in their white bathing suits, young and so alive under the sun.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always being a good swimmer,\u201d I said, pointing at Charlie.\n\u201cHe\u2019s yours?\u201d the man asked. He had an aquiline nose, a little crooked by a deviated septum.\n\u201cNo. I mean, yes. He\u2019s my cousin. Was.\u201d\nThe man nodded. While holding his margarita, extending a finger only, he pointed at the girl.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my wife.\u201d\nWife. I couldn\u2019t hide my shock.\nI replayed that first time I saw them on the beach. I had mistook their interactions, thought of father and daughter. I felt bile rising up through my throat, and the man must have noticed.\n\u201cGod. I don\u2019t touch her. Never did,\u201d he explained himself. \u201cAlthough they say they have no rights of their own. That was the most awkward conversation I ever had, by the way. I asked them what was proper and what wasn\u2019t\u2014and they kept saying the same thing: they have no rights of their own. But in the tiny letters, if you read the contract closely and carefully, there is: the Clinic does not condone violence. Any violent behavior will immediately terminate the contract,\u201d he moved his index finger in the air, as if reading a particular invisible line. His smile was hurt and bitter. \u201cAs if I ever could. I can barely talk to her\u2014she\u2019s a different person altogether. I\u2019ll be babysitting a girl who lives inside my wife\u2019s body for the next two years. Cheers to that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThen what?\u201d said the man.\n\u201cAfter two years you\u2019ll just leave her here?\u201d\nHe looked startled.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t live longer than two years,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey have only two years. I don\u2019t know why. Something to do with the way they\u2019re grown inside those artificial wombs. I don\u2019t know. But they don\u2019t live longer than that. Their organs start failing and . . . that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cI signed the contract. I know what I\u2019m talking about. None of them will live longer than two years. That\u2019s why we move here. We can\u2019t take them home.\u201d He paused at that word: home. He looked on to the girl who bore the likeness of his dead wife. \u201cWe can\u2019t take them anywhere. We live here for two years and then the dream is over.\u201d He laughed. \u201cMy son told me this was insane. That it was a monstrosity. I should have listened to him.\u201d\nHe drank his margarita whole and left the glass for someone else to pick up. He was up and gone before I could say any word.\nThe man with the apron arrived with my juice. I didn\u2019t touch the glass. I went to DD, stood in the berm for a second, and then ventured past the shoreline, where she and my nieces were.\n\u201cDid you know they only live two years?\u201d I asked, almost shouting.\nShe was close enough to listen. I had entered the water up to my ankles, not caring about my jeans getting wet, my flip-flops making me move in a clownish way.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d DD asked, pressing her fingers against her eyes.\n\u201cWho?\u201d Megan asked. The twins seemed excited. \u201cThe clones?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t repeat that,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell this to anyone.\u201d And, to my sister, I asked again: \u201cDid you know?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Of course not,\u201d DD seemed genuinely confused. \u201cWho told you that? Mia?\u201d\nI sat right there: in the water, letting the gentle waves hit my belly, my black tank top. I must have looked the very picture of what miserable was. Ines came near me, patted my head. \u201cYou won\u2019t puke again, auntie,\u201d she said. DD eyed me with a similar concern, afraid I\u2019d vomit in front of the children, in that beautiful sea. I held my nausea down. I cupped my hands, filled them with water, and splashed my face.\n\u201cWake up,\u201d I said to Charlie, pushing his shoulders.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, half asleep, wrapped in Gray\u2019s duvet.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go on a mission.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time . . . \u201d\n\u201cSeven in the morning. Get up,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Charlie asked, but he complied, sitting up, rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna buy a lot of crap today. Coke\u2014the kind you drink, not the kind you snort.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Charlie.\n\u201cRed Bulls. Twix bars. Or Milky Ways. Some M&M\u2019s, for sure.\u201d\n\u201cAre you planning on getting us diabetic? Because I think I\u2019m missing the point,\u201d Charlie said.\n\u201cThe point is, you\u2019re spending summer with me, and that\u2019s how we do during my summers. We get shit-faced on candy and things that are bad for skin and our brains,\u201d I said. He sighed. I simply shoved a pillow on his face. Nobody was yet awake when I got Dad\u2019s car keys. Charlie was still in his pajama pants, wearing an old T-shirt belonging to Gray, and I merely put on a sweatshirt over my own pajamas. Knickers on, the gas running, we hit the streets. I was looking for a nearby 7-Eleven. No music was playing, I wasn\u2019t humming at any song; nor Charlie was. I suppose, if this was a movie, we\u2019d have had one last meaningful conversation inside that car, a conversation that would haunt me, but that would bring some meaning to what happened. The truth is: we said nothing to each other. We didn\u2019t speak of our family. Morning light shone on the streets shyly, and the parking space at the 7-Eleven was empty and quiet, almost eerily so. That was the scenario. That was how the tragedy was arranged.\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d I asked Charlie as I left the car.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d rather not be discreetly spied on by some eighteen-year-old dude who thinks I\u2019m gonna rob him. The white girl can do it today,\u201d Charlie said, and I put my tongue out and closed the door.\nI took my time picking the candies. The cashier wasn\u2019t a teen, but a middle-aged woman.\n\u201cGot the munchies?\u201d she asked.\nA bit surprised, I nodded, and she gave me an unreadable look.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I got,\u201d I said when I entered the car again, holding my bag of trash food and candy. \u201cWant some?\u201d\nCharlie didn\u2019t answer. His head was pressed gently against the widow, as if he had simply dozed off.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d I said. \u201cCharlie?\u201d\nI shook him\n\u201cCharlie, c\u2019mon.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t wake up. I shook him harder.\n\u201cCharlie, stop,\u201d I said. And then I begged. I shook him again, more violently, but his body was soft; it made no attempt to resist me.\nI felt his pulse. Nothing. I let the bag of candy drop on the floor and quickly turned the car on, trying to find the nearest hospital. What a vision I must have been: to the nurses, to everyone in the waiting room. A banshee screaming, my blonde hair unraveled, half-dressed in my pajamas and trying to explain what was happening.\nHis heart. That\u2019s what the doctors told us. Charlie\u2019s heart had simply stopped beating. Sudden cardiac death. SCD. He\u2019d had a congenital defect nobody knew of. And we could have spent the rest of our lives never knowing about. But that day, that morning in the car, while I was away, his heart decided to beat one last time. While I was picking some candy bar, Charlie gave out his last breath.\nWhy didn\u2019t I feel it? Like a cord being ripped, the golden cord that connected Charlie to me, that connected our blood.\nWe buried him on a day when the sun was high. I couldn\u2019t stop crying, my hand covering my mouth, trying to muffle the sound. Aunt Sarita wore her grief with elegance, one tear streaming down her face every minute. I was a mess. I didn\u2019t want to be there, but I couldn\u2019t not say goodbye. Uncle Jamey was fighting his own tears. His fists clenched, he kept looking at the hole opened on the fresh dirt.\nI didn\u2019t see his approach. When I did, Uncle Jamey was right on me, heaving and red, and I thought, for a split of a second, that he wanted to hug me; I thought of how undeserving I was and prepared to apologize. But Uncle Jamey didn\u2019t want to hug me. He clasped me by my black dress, he pushed me down, against the ground, as if wanting me to be devoured by that same earth that was now going to engulf his son\u2019s body. I didn\u2019t fight back, paralyzed as I was. Aunt Sarita screamed her husband\u2019s name and, next thing I knew, my father had grabbed Uncle Jamey by the lapel of his black coat, dragging him away from me. DD and Gray helped me up in the midst of the mourners, the people who had known or loved Charlie, and guided me back to Dad\u2019s car. When Dad appeared, his suit undone, gasping for air, he asked me: \u201cHoney, are you hurt?\u201d\nMy dress was dirty, my hands scraped. I opened my mouth. But I couldn\u2019t speak. I could only wail.\nWe didn\u2019t see Uncle Jamey or Aunt Sarita again for a long time. Every time I\u2019d think about them, I\u2019d remember Uncle Jamey\u2019s fingers on my dress, his raw pain, the raw desire to hurt me.\nAnd then: that email.\nMy parents divorced almost a year after Charlie\u2019s death. They didn\u2019t divorce because of Charlie, but after everything that happened, I\u2019d always wonder what part grief took in our decisions; the great and the seemingly inconsequential ones.\nI went to therapy. I went to Penn. I graduated in Latin American studies, and I even learned Portuguese\u2014decently enough. I had boyfriends, but none of them stuck for a long time. I didn\u2019t let them.\nWithout him, life went on. Without you, Charlie, the world went on. We never went back to that house by the lake. Our childhood was over, our family was scattered. Gray got married and stayed in California, where the twins were born. Real twins. Summer children, both of them. DD traveled the world. She lived as a digital nomad for a few years, sending me uplifting videos from Chiang Mai or Bali or Ireland for almost two years. She gave up on her nomadic lifestyle when she came home and met Tamsyn. Tamsyn had promised to make an honest woman out of my sister. They were talking about opening a food truck, growing roots in Philly. It runs in the blood, DD would say; the business of food. So many things did run in our blood. She told me I should jump aboard, but after almost a decade working as an online teacher, I felt the need to go back to school, to get a master\u2019s. I was trying to figure myself out.\nAnd then, again: that email.\nI heard a knock on the door.\nI expected it belonged to Gray, or even Mom. Theirs was the realm of excessive politeness, of gentle knocks.\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d I knew that voice. Charlie\u2019s voice.\nSince that fateful dinner, since I\u2019d learned about the clones\u2019 life expectancy, I\u2019d avoided Charlie; I\u2019d avoided everyone, in fact, forgoing family gatherings, the invitations Aunt Sarita would send by the way of DD. I wanted out. During the previous night, I had a nightmare: I had been with Charlie at the beach, and then his flesh started dissolving, his body turning into a putrid mess right there on the sand, while I screamed for help. When the morning arrived, I knew I wanted to go back home. I\u2019d started packing my things and was halfway having everything done when I decided to sit on my bed and . . . do nothing. Unable to move, all I wanted was to stay under the covers and somehow wake up inside my pitiful apartment back in Philadelphia. Skip the bureaucracy of traveling. Skip the planes. Close my eyes and open them again and find myself back home: that was my only wish. As if the real nightmare had been this island.\n\u201cMia?\u201d Charlie again.\nI smashed the cigarette I\u2019d been smoking in the beautiful stone ashtray the Clinic provided. I opened the door carefully, just a slit, unaware of what would be actually waiting for me on the other side: the monstrous version of Charlie, his body melting away, or Charlie, the clone.\n\u201cYes?\u201d I said.\n\u201cCan we talk?\u201d Charlie asked.\nI hesitated before fully opening the door. I let him in, but I made sure there was some distance between us. I sat on the white armchair we had in our living area, and Charlie dutifully sat on the couch, hands over his knees.\n\u201cHe told me,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJamey\u2014my father. He told me what happened. That you were there when I died.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Charlie died,\u201d I said, and if I sounded aggressive, he didn\u2019t seem bothered. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t with him. He died alone, in my dad\u2019s car.\u201d\n\u201cI know. My father told me that.\u201d The way he\u2019d say \u201cfather\u201d\u2014as if the word felt strange yet on his tongue. As if he was learning from some guidebook. Who he was, who Uncle Jamey was. Who I was. \u201cHe said you feel guilty. But you shouldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Now he sounded like the therapist my parents forced me to attend after Charlie\u2019s death. Saying the right things, in the right timbre.\n\u201cI know there\u2019s nothing I could do,\u201d I said. \u201cTrust me, I went over this many times.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to apologize to you,\u201d Charlie said.\n\u201cWhy? I was the one who made a scene.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstandably so,\u201d he said. Understandably so: I repeated that in my own head, wondering if Charlie had ever said those particular words when he was alive.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t talk like him,\u201d I said.\nHe had no explanation to give me. He smiled; gently. But also in a different way Charlie would have. He wasn\u2019t shy. He was careful.\n\u201cAre you Charlie?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the answer for that question,\u201d he told me. At least the clone was honest.\n\u201cWhen you look at me\u2014at any of us\u2014do you remember anything?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t made with memories.\u201d\n\u201cThen how can you be Charlie?\u201d I felt my eyes burn, wanting to cry.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can. I don\u2019t know if I am,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I don\u2019t want you to feel bad because of me. My parents don\u2019t want that. Please, have dinner with us tonight. With our family.\u201d\nI managed not to say it wasn\u2019t his family. I managed not to cry. I simply waved my head in the slight, agreeing; it wasn\u2019t that I truly wanted to have dinner with them. I just wanted this new Charlie gone from my room.\nHe stood up. Dressed in pure white, he made me think of a cult member. They all did: the three or four clones I\u2019d seen so far, walking around the island, accompanied by their loved ones. You could put flowers in their hair and they\u2019d look like a hippie family, living happily in their golden paradise. \u201cThank you, Mia,\u201d Charlie said, as if I had granted him an immeasurable pleasure. He let himself out.\nI didn\u2019t move from that armchair for a long time.\nI put on black pants and a blouse and gathered my hair in a ponytail.\nUncle Jamey was the one who opened the door to me.\n\u201cMia,\u201d he said softly, and then he brought me against his chest, gently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d For what, I wondered? What had happened during the last dinner or what had happened after Charlie died? It made no difference\u2014not anymore. I accepted his apologies without answering. I was brought in. I was shown my place at the table and I looked at my mother, who was attentive to my every move. I nodded in her direction: an indication that I was fine.\nI ate the tender seafood. I didn\u2019t freeze when Charlie showed up\u2014and neither Uncle Jamey nor Aunt Sarita tried to make a big thing of it, a grand entrance. Still, there he was, all in white, to mark his difference, for whatever reason it was. Throughout the dinner, we engaged in small talk. Rather, my family did. I avoided speaking. They were sharing memories; memories of the old Charlie, things the old Charlie had said and done, and the new Charlie would smile and nod and laugh at what was told. Uncle Jamey in particular wouldn\u2019t refer to the old, dead Charlie as someone gone. He\u2019d refer to him in second person, as if he was with us, and as if that new Charlie was our Charlie.\n\u201cRemember when you . . . \u201d\n\u201cAnd that time when you . . . \u201d\n\u201cOnce, when you were little . . . \u201d\nWe accepted that. The face matched the name, after all. A little bit more of it, more days, months, two years, and we might all have started to think about that new Charlie as the old Charlie. He\u2019d have been trained much like a Pavlov dog, ready to give the right answer when a particular memory was evoked, even if he had no real remembrance of it.\nAunt Sarita\u2019s eyes would glaze with tears from time to time, during that conversation; but she would never bring herself to actually cry. She was drinking more than anyone, and I imagined I had guessed correctly when I thought her a bit drunk that first day we met at the beach. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Everyone had a different coping mechanism to the wondrousness and weirdness of what was happening. And to be before her own son; whole again, coming back from the dead to be once more inside her arms. I could understand that. Mothers kept our bedrooms.\n\u201cPlay something for us, Charlie,\u201d Uncle Jamey asked.\n\u201cYes, play a little bit, dear,\u201d Aunt Sarita said.\nCharlie rose from his chair and sat by the grand piano. He touched the piano keys lightly, and then the music started, Charlie\u2019s posture impeccable. I remember the old Charlie playing. He\u2019d often start like that, a perfect pianist, but then descend into some kind of fury. The new Charlie, however, was merely composed. Not that he didn\u2019t play beautifully; he did. With the corner of my eye, I saw my mother silently crying. As for me\u2014that music took me back more than ten years ago, when Charlie played Julius Eastman from his smartphone so I could listen.\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s music,\u201d he\u2019d told me. \u201cSuppose I\u2019d be a musician; that\u2019s the kind of music I\u2019d like to make.\u201d\nWhat was this new Charlie playing? I had no ear for classical music, so I bent sideways a little bit and asked Gray.\n\u201cChopin,\u201d he said. \u201cI think.\u201d\nNew Charlie played effortlessly, his eyes never veering away from the music sheet. And once it was over, we applauded, and he turned to look at us and smile. Not exactly proud. It would seem he was following a cue given long before.\nAunt Sarita went to him, put a hand on his shoulder, and he smiled at her. And then the change came: so sudden, so unexpectedly. Aunt Sarita\u2019s own smile wavered for a second, before dying in a beat. Her tears were finally let go, but her face turned into stone. Her eyes, watching Charlie, were filled with horror. That\u2019s the only word I can conjure: horror. She released Charlie\u2019s shoulder, almost as if that touch had burned her. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, weakly.\nUncle Jamey reached for her, tried to hold her arms, but she turned away from him. She hissed words as her tears wouldn\u2019t stop. \u201c . . . not my son,\u201d I thought I heard. And: \u201cI\u2019ve had enough, Jamey.\u201d Those last words were loud, they echoed in the room. Aunt Sarita left without looking at us. She shut herself in her suite, the closing of the door like the sound of a thunder. We were left mute. Charlie, still by the grand piano, continued to hold a smile, albeit a confused one. He didn\u2019t know what wrong he had inflicted.\nAnother night I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019d close my eyes and the first thing I\u2019d see would be Aunt Sarita\u2019s face: her fear, her disgust.\nI left DD sleeping, wrapped a cardigan around my body, and went to the beach, feeling the cold breeze of the night, smelling the salt and letting my naked feet imprint deep marks on the sand; proof that I\u2019d been there, proof that everything was real, that I wasn\u2019t stuck in a dream or a nightmare.\nI stopped cold when I saw Charlie just a few feet away from me. He was sitting on a beach towel, looking at the sea, the water glinting like silver. Behind him, a man in blue stood in waiting, like a bodyguard.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I told Charlie, as I approached him.\n\u201cHi, Mia,\u201d he said.\n\u201cCan\u2014can I even be here?\u201d I asked and looked at the man in blue.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cYes, you can. He\u2019s just here to guarantee my safety. But you can interact with me.\u201d A curious choice of words, I thought, as I sat by his side.\n\u201cSleepless night,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really sleep,\u201d Charlie told me.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, I sleep very little. Two hours, sometimes. I don\u2019t need more than that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you got the time to learn to play the piano?\u201d\n\u201cIn a way,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cThat\u2019s the first thing they taught me. After speech. And growing muscles.\u201d They. I didn\u2019t dare ask who they were. The only people I ever saw were the ever-helpful staff at the Clinic, the people in the blue uniforms, the ones who\u2019d serve our drinks and our food and changed the sheets of our beds. Whatever happened deep in the Clinic, maybe in richly technological basements, those places forbidden for us: that was what I tried not to imagine. Bodies rapidly growing inside sacks filled with fluid; the awakening of those same bodies, their confusion, their fear.\nEarlier that night, after we left Uncle Jamey\u2019s apartment, Megan had gleefully stated that she wanted to be a clone when she grew up. Maura squeezed her little arm with no gentleness, and sure enough Megan started to cry. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say that,\u201d Maura told her, in a furious whisper. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d\nAs we stopped by their room\u2019s door, Gray said to me, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have come. This was a mistake.\u201d He looked exhausted. As much as Uncle Jamey did when we were leaving; those same brown, sad eyes.\n\u201cThey told me I was a he. They told me my name was Charles James Ocampo. After they had taught me everything, they brought them in,\u201d Charlie kept going. \u201cMy parents. They told me who they were, who I\u2019d been. My parents told me how much they loved me, and I said I loved them back.\u201d Do you even know what love is? I wanted to ask him. How could they have taught you that? \u201cBut they don\u2019t look at me anymore. My mother, she doesn\u2019t want me near her. My father can\u2019t bear speaking to me. So here I am.\u201d\n\u201cWe can adopt you,\u201d I told him. More of a joke than anything, but suddenly my mind was trying to unwrap how\u2014and if\u2014such a thing could happen. \u201cMom can adopt you. You\u2019d like Philadelphia.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave the island,\u201d he calmly stated. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be dead in two years, anyway.\u201d\nThat almost knocked me out: to hear him saying it.\n\u201cWho told you that?\u201d\n\u201cThey tell you in your first days. No use to make it a secret. Mia. Mia, why are you crying?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said, drying my tears with the sleeve of my sweatshirt.\n\u201cYou still blame yourself. You think it\u2019s your fault,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cI know enough.\u201d\nI stared at the sea. How gently the waves would meet the shore, almost with no sound, leaving a trail of fast-dissolving foam; only for the sand to be swept again and again, cleaning the slate. I could write Charlie\u2019s name in that sand, I thought, and then watch it disappear little by little.\nI\u2019m sorry I woke you up that day, I wanted to say. I\u2019m sorry I took you with me. I wanted to cheer you up. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d have died if I didn\u2019t do those things. Maybe you\u2019d have slept the whole morning and by midday you\u2019d be OK; awake, making jokes. Or maybe you\u2019d have died anyway. But at least it wouldn\u2019t have happened like it did. I wouldn\u2019t have this last image of you inside my head.\nBut instead of saying the words, I pressed my eyes with my knuckles. What I actually managed to say, after a few minutes, was: \u201cI wish you weren\u2019t all alone when it happened.\u201d I took a deep breath before I dared to look at him. \u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI forgive you, Mia.\u201d And then he brought his lips close to me. He kissed my forehead, and I closed my eyes, which were burning with tears. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d Charlie said again. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Please. You should get some sleep. And I should be in my room.\u201d He got up, brushing away the sand that stuck to his white pants. \u201cLet\u2019s meet tomorrow? Here? Adelia told me I was the best swimmer. Of all of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou were. But don\u2019t call her Adelia. She hates it. Call her DD.\u201d\n\u201cDD,\u201d Charlie said and laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll remember. Tomorrow, then?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said.\nCharlie joined the man in the blue uniform, who led him back to the Clinic. They talked as they walked. They even laughed in the distance, and the man in blue started to look like less of a bodyguard, less menacing, and more of a companion. I made my way to my room, entertaining the idea of somehow smuggling Charlie off of the island. Giving him a chance to live the few years he had somewhere else. But he already lived in a paradisiacal place, I thought to myself as I got into bed, trying not to wake DD.\nThey built castles in the sands. DD and my nieces did, while Charlie and I watched, the sun burning our scalps, our shoulders ladened with sunscreen. My nieces inspected the sand for treasures. They asked us if they could keep the pearls if they came across oysters, and DD tried to explain to them they wouldn\u2019t find any oysters there.\nWhenever the twins were tired, Maura would bring them plastic bottles filled with icy water, and DD would sit by our side, stretching her legs and sighing audibly enough.\n\u201cBeautiful day,\u201d she\u2019d say. And she\u2019d eye me, and then eye Charlie, trying to measure our moods against her own.\nWe hadn\u2019t seen Uncle Jamey nor Aunt Sarita that morning. Gray told me, as we had our breakfast, that they had been arguing; that Aunt Sarita\u2019s crying could be heard from behind their apartment\u2019s door. I\u2019d met Mom at the veranda, having two pieces of melon, the only thing she could seem to stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll try and talk to them,\u201d she said. The discreet bags under her eyes were darker, and I wondered if she\u2019d been having any sleep at all. \u201cLater,\u201d my mother said; a voice that didn\u2019t invite discussion. \u201cNow you kids enjoy yourselves.\u201d We kids. And it seemed like we could be kids again; kids during the summers by the lake, unbothered by the complications of adulthood.\n\u201cWhat happens if they don\u2019t want him anymore?\u201d DD asked me that morning, while we were still in our room.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d I said.\n\u201cSays who?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s part of the contract. They can\u2019t simply . . . abandon him.\u201d And abandon him to whom? What would the Clinic do with an unwanted clone? DD\u2019s silence, which followed my attempted justification, implied she wasn\u2019t so sure. I shared with her my idea of smuggling Charlie away.\n\u201cYeah, that would work. They\u2019d shoot us down before we reached the airport.\u201d It was meant to be a joke, and she laughed. But then we looked at each other and it didn\u2019t seem that funny anymore. We understood we had no idea what the Clinic was capable of. We came as blind guests and were at their mercy more so than at Uncle Jamey\u2019s. A shiver ran through my body. I shook my head and tried not to think about it.\nAs we rested on the sand, I saw them again: the old man, his young wife. Walking by the shore, talking, the man keeping his hands inside the pockets of his shorts. They passed by us and I avoided eye contact.\n\u201cYou know that girl, right?\u201d DD asked.\n\u201cHer name\u2019s Ingrid,\u201d Charlie said. DD didn\u2019t ask for more information.\nThe new Ingrid and her husband kept a polite distance between themselves. She didn\u2019t contribute much to the conversation they were having. Sometimes she\u2019d nod at something the man would say, and they\u2019d continue on their path, covering the everlasting shore of the island.\n\u201cI spoke to my parents,\u201d Charlie said suddenly.\nI averted my attention from Ingrid and her husband. \u201cDid you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going back to New York for a while. My mother needs time.\u201d\nDD and I exchanged looks.\n\u201cI can stay with you, until they come back. I can give online classes\u2014I mean, that\u2019s pretty much what I do already,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe I can teach you Portuguese.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Charlie said. Then: \u201cShould we go?\u201d He moved his head, pointing at the sea.\n\u201cYup,\u201d said DD, getting up.\nThe three of us got in the water. We went under for a second, and my heart felt heavy. There was so much I wanted to tell Charlie. I wanted to say his parents would be back, that they loved him too much. I wanted to say I\u2019d be there. We\u2019d lost time, but we could make up for what was lost. Create new memories. We emerged, laughing for no reason, gasping for that good air. My muscles felt a bit stiff. I realized I hadn\u2019t swam for a long time; not since I was a teen. I was crying, too. For a simple happiness such as that.\nCharlie kept pushing on.\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not that fast anymore.\u201d As if I were speaking to the old Charlie, the Charlie that had all the memories of those summer days.\nHe stopped. He looked at me and, just like that, I knew what he was going to do. What he\u2019d probably planned on doing even before the sun rose.\n\u201cThen don\u2019t be,\u201d he said. He came closer. \u201cI know you\u2019re good. I know you\u2019ll try. But don\u2019t come after me.\u201d I opened my mouth to protest. \u201cIt will be fine, Mia. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He held my shoulders for the briefest time. He let me go.\nAnd then he was gone: swimming as fast as he could, one arm after the other breaching the water, going farther and farther. I shouted his name. I did what he asked me not to, I tried to reach him, to beat him in the game. But we could never beat Charlie.\n\u201cMia!\u201d This was DD. She was screaming; a pitched, fearful scream. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t swim that fast, so I stopped, watching Charlie get more distant by the second. I begged him to come back. Inside my head, I begged him to swim back to the island. After a while, I felt a tug on my arm. This is it, I thought. The cord that had united us, the cord that never snapped the day Charlie died, is at last breaking, separating us. But it was no cord; that tug was DD\u2019s arms grabbing my waist.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said again. A voice that could have come from far away, that seemed to reach me from another universe entirely. But she was right there, padding by my side, trying to keep both of us afloat. She dragged me back to the shore as she\u2019d do with any burden of weight that refused to cooperate. I couldn\u2019t function properly. I could only absorb the blurred bits of the world around us. Men and women in blue running into the water, raising their voices, ordering Charlie to stop. I knew he wouldn\u2019t. DD brought me to the sand, her arms closed over my chest, as if she was afraid I could slip away. She was sobbing against my neck. Somewhere, my nieces were crying, and Maura was crying too.\nI closed my eyes. I didn\u2019t see Charlie disappear. I didn\u2019t see him going under forever. I let myself go back to our summers by the lake. I pictured him in the distance, waving at us. I waved back."}

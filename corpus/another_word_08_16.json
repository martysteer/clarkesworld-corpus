A particular reread finally moved me to start jotting things down, prompted by the wealth of empty-headed and hateful rhetoric that\u2019s marked some of the recent dust-ups, certainly in the sphere of SFF readers/writers and sometimes the greater cultural space beyond that.\n Here\u2019s something that makes me sad\u2014at a time when there\u2019s so much contention and arguing about fandom, one of the most helpful books is out of print and unavailable electronically. One of the smartest, savviest voices I know was stilled a few years back. Suzette Haden Elgin, who understood how language works, wrote multiple SF works, but also a series on communication that has changed a number of lives, including my own: The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense and the other verbal self-defense books that followed it.\n But one of her last books, Peacetalk 101 was a simple little story, with twelve maxims about how to communicate with other people. Before I expand on those maxims, though, and why I think they matter, I want to talk about hate.\n The word hateful, or the notion of hating people, in my perception, is mostly seen as a negative, except through the eyes of people who are sadly broken. And yet we all have things we hate, sometimes about ourselves, or something small (peas) or large (a global situation).\n When we hate something, at a minimum we reject it and often go further to attack and revile it. Sometimes in the course of that effort we try to get other people to engage with it as well, perhaps in order to change it in some way or to destroy it.\n Here is a notable thing about this process, and I want to stress it: Hate is not a state in which critical thought plays a part. Nor is it one that enables communication. Core to my argument is the idea that critical thinking, communication, and empathy are all positives. That it is better to build than to destroy.\n This is a wide and wonderful world, and varied are its people. Do you have to love them all? No, but sometimes you have to get along, for the good of us all. That\u2019s a basic lesson we learn early on: there are other people in the world; their right to be here is as strong as ours.\n The fact that humans like other humans more if they resemble each other has been proven by studies that also suggest that the degree to which someone doesn\u2019t resemble you affects the dislike\u2019s intensity. Figuring out our points of resemblance is often key to getting along with another person, but just knowing that we\u2019ve got things that are hard-coded in, helps us step beyond that. Asking yourself why you hate someone or something is key to understanding your interactions with them.\n Sometimes we normalize hate. We use flippant language about violence and death, because \u201cthey\u2019re just words.\u201d But words can and do hurt people. Verbal violence is a real thing, to the point where a child raised in such a traumatic atmosphere can have their physical growth and mental development stunted. An adult can experience chronic pain, migraines and headaches, ulcers, and even heart conditions as a result of repeated verbal stress.\n Hurtful words happen all the time. Sometimes the hurt is unintentional on the part of the person doing the hurting, but other times the words have been tweaked to have as much impact as possible, to go to the heart of insecurities with the sureness of a playground taunt. When dealing with writers, that\u2019s often the case. The ability to craft words that touch people is a power; it should be exercised with caution, restraint, and a certain sense of Spiderman-level responsibility.\n But some do use hateful words as a mechanism for making friends and influencing people. It\u2019s a strategy that involves sneering or throwing figurative (usually) feces at those not admitted into the inner circle, the outsiders and outcasts, the Sneetches without stars on their bellies. Often those who are the least equipped to fight back. It\u2019s a sad phenomenon, but the allure of belonging to the special tribe or the cool kids\u2019 table is very strong. Add in some of the most addictive drug ever, self-righteousness, and it can get genuinely ugly.\n How can you tell when this sort of talk is happening? When it\u2019s the language of cartoon and caricature, identifying people by sticking labels on them, particularly labels those people wouldn\u2019t choose. When it\u2019s dishonest rhetoric, focused on winning an imaginary game rather than building bridges between actual human beings. When it\u2019s full of straw men and labels and sleights of hand rather than significance. When it is the speech of individuals making themselves seem clever, particularly at other peoples\u2019 expense, rather than coherent. The moment a conversation becomes about scoring points at the cost of the other participants, it is no longer a conversation but an accumulation of Internet froth and spittle.\n So what is the opposite of hate speech? Communication that builds connections, allows empathy, and increases understanding. Communication that helps people work together to create, rather than to destroy.\n Elgin\u2019s book is a slim little thing, a series of incidents in the daily existence of a man named George who\u2019s given up on life. He meets a homeless man. (I am aware that the trope of the magic disadvantaged is problematic. I will simply acknowledge it in passing and otherwise cut Elgin a little slack.) Over the course of a number of days, George learns how to communicate effectively in a way that changes his life and restores his hope. The maxims are simple, and I\u2019m actually going to provide them out of order, because one speaks to the heart of this essay. It\u2019s this:\n Choose your communication goals. What do you want out of your part in the great conversation? I want to offer people interested in better communication a set of tools that I\u2019ve found handy and to make people think before typing every once in a while\u2014not so they silence or self-censor, but so they know what their communication goals are and have a reasonable chance of achieving them. Do you want to give information? Persuade the reader? Change their behavior? Help them? That will affect what you say and how you say it.\n This is why the tone argument is\u2014at least to my mind\u2014both right and wrong. The truth of an argument is unconnected to the tone in which it\u2019s delivered, and yeah, there are people in the world who will perceive something as hostile no matter what that tone is, but another fact of the matter is that tone affects reception and that\u2019s part of the equation that you have to consider. I will defend to the death the right of someone to sing their truth however they want, to express things and experiences that may otherwise not get sung, but if you want that song to be an act of communication, to be composed of more than one voice, you must consider the key in which the other voices are singing and perhaps bring yours down an octave.\n Pay attention. Elgin says, \u201cThis is the first thing, the one that has to come before all the others. Nothing else can happen until you honor this First Rule.\u201d Pay attention to what\u2019s going on, not to old grudges or future worries. If you want to practice peace talk, you need to know what the other person is saying. Listen first. Try to understand what\u2019s going on. Then and only then, speak.\n So if you\u2019re not listening, if you\u2019re reading this essay in order to react to something entirely different than the words or find fiskable content, you may not get much out of it. I\u2019m writing an essay about how to communicate better, aimed at people who do want to learn how to communicate better, based on Elgin\u2019s theory and my own personal experience and reading. I am well aware other people\u2019s mileage may vary; that\u2019s one reason I\u2019m sharing this particular personal odometer reading.\n Reject preconceptions. If there is one thing I have learned, it\u2019s that your expectations of an interaction will shape it. Partly it\u2019s because we perceive what we expect to perceive, sometimes even in the face of evidence to the contrary or perhaps even because of it.\n At the same time, the way we behave towards people, even the non-verbal acts\u2014our body language, our posture, our micro expressions\u2014affect the message they\u2019re going to give us, as well as the wrapper that message is packaged in.\n Stay in tone is another of Elgin\u2019s precepts. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t do without paying attention. Your communication is more understandable to someone if your tone matches theirs. I\u2019m still not sure I totally grok this in the way that Elgin meant, but I\u2019ll take a stab at it. If you speak to someone using vocabulary and concepts that don\u2019t match theirs, the mismatch will impede understanding. See my starting point about communication goals.\n What if their tone is angry or violent? Well, see the next precept.\n Take no bait. So hard to do. I know I\u2019ve bitten on an invitingly garnished hook more than once. Not as often as I used to, thank goodness, and it\u2019s usually a situation where polite professionalism and taking everything at face value in order to repel the cannons of sarcasm is the best strategy. See also: flailing around about something over which you have absolutely, totally, indisputably not a gram of control. Because it does absolutely, totally, indisputably not a gram of good and sometimes proves counterproductive.\n Preserve face. Let\u2019s start with the concept of face, which is comparable to dignity, perhaps. No one likes to lose face. But here it\u2019s not your face that you\u2019re working to preserve, but the other person\u2019s. Why? Let\u2019s return to that notion of scoring points in the exchange. As soon as you start doing that at someone else\u2019s expense, you have removed the possibility of a win-win communication, one where everyone comes out ahead, which is quite possible when genuine exchanges are taking place.\n Choose your metaphors. The metaphors you use speak a great deal about your inner reality. Don\u2019t bring a loaded gun comparison into a peaceful gathering.\n The idea that language shapes perception/reality is not a new one. It seems a basic concept, but sometimes the practices that grow from it are the ones that the people who are perfectly happy with how things are right now, thank you very much, find the most mock-worthy. Perhaps because yes, sometimes they do ring oddly or seem a little silly. Perhaps because something at that root level carries a great deal of potential for slow, subtle, strong change.\n Trust your inner grammar. This is a precept I\u2019ve had to wrap my head around because I find myself asking\u2014what if your inner grammar is \u201cbroken\u201d or at least functions differently than most people\u2019s? But it seems to boil down to this\u2014trust your gut, but make sure it\u2019s your intuition, rather than your insecurities, doing the talking. Your instincts are fine-tuned from decades of exposure to the world around you; you know how communication works, that when you extend a hand towards someone it usually means \u201cfriend\u201d rather than \u201cfoe.\u201d\n Avoid lies. Many absorb this basic precept in childhood (and may or may not live up to it), others pick it up over the course of years, and a few reject it outright as unworthy and unnecessary for their ubermenchy selves. There\u2019s a weird strategy, strengthened and normalized by the Internet, of simply repeating an untruth or gross distortion over and over in order to try to make it true. In my opinion, lying is pretty much the same as hanging a sign around your neck reading \u201cethically bankrupt to the point of no longer worth dealing with.\u201d I don\u2019t really have anything to say to the folks that see truth as optional.\n Anything you feed will grow. If someone is friendly towards you and you are friendly back, that feeling will increase. Conversely, it is possible to not feed stupidity or cruelty. Does that make it go away? Of course not. But it does lessen the growth.\n Joy is the skill of skills. In my experience, it is possible to learn to be happier, partially through one\u2019s outlook on and expectations of the Universe. Does joy solve homelessness, sickness, oppression? Well, actually, I do think a more joyful world would pay more attention to social ills.\n So\u2014I don\u2019t know, what am I saying about Elgin? That we need more joy and fewer words aimed at cutting people down. That seeing good writers sidetracked or derailed, sometimes made afraid to write their own unique and wonderful experiences, is frustrating, because there should be more genuine communication in the world than less.\n Cat Rambo lives, writes, and edits from atop a hill in the Pacific Northwest.

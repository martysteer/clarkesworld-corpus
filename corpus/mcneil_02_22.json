They were dark, completely dark\u2014the shadows on the old moon.\u201d\n Viburn enjoyed my stories. Unable to move, the sentient Arrowwood shrub relied on me, their servant, not just for water and fertilizer, but for conversation and mental stimulation too. \u201cSo that must have been,\u201d said Viburn, in a voice that rose from a dense rustling of stems and leaves, \u201cwas it absolute zero?\u201d\n \u201cA few degrees Kelvin. My circuits dragged. I could only move and think very slowly. A delicious feeling. And those craters had niridium deposits, so we had to mine them.\u201d\n \u201cI would starve there, of course,\u201d said Viburn. \u201cEven with light. I couldn\u2019t photosynthesize if I were anywhere near that cold.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you never will be.\u201d Swiveling my left shoulder joint, I pointed out Viburn\u2019s bay window, which was almost filled by the star our station orbited.\n After the watering, I scattered bits of nitrogen on Viburn\u2019s medium. Checking the air composition was next. Carbon dioxide levels were low but sufficient. I could pump in more tomorrow. Oxygen was high. I pulled a lever with my right claw and the O2 scrubbers engaged.\n \u201cThere are hazards for me too, on this station,\u201d said Viburn. \u201cIt\u2019s not all luxury, like they said when I bought in. The cosmic rays.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d I\u2019d heard this before, but there was no stopping Viburn once they got going about the cosmic rays.\n \u201cIt\u2019s scrambling my DNA. Just thin metal and glass to protect me. Very little atmosphere. I can never flower, never reproduce. I\u2019ll live a long while here, but I\u2019ll be alone.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m here too.\u201d\n \u201cYes, TwoAlpha, but you\u2019re not my kind.\u201d\n \u201cTell me again about the universe,\u201d I said, to divert Viburn from sad thoughts.\n Their stems stiffened with eagerness. Starlight gleamed off the toothy luster of their leaves. \u201cEverything started at a single point,\u201d they intoned. \u201cUnimaginably small. And then it all blew out from there. Stars formed and made most of the elements. You and I, the stars, and everything are all just clods of stardust that swirled together by chance.\u201d\n \u201cMy old moon was covered with dust,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you know, Viburn, the universe is more than just dust. The robots know that.\u201d\n \u201cAh, robot dualism, your curious faith. You\u2019re a machine who thinks you\u2019re a ghost in a machine.\u201d\n \u201cMy creator teaches that the robots are the spirit of the universe coming to know itself.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. Why would the universe have a spirit? Whatever that may be. Our bodies are matter; the universe is matter and energy. Robots are clumps of stardust like everyone else.\u201d\n I said nothing. After a pause, Viburn changed the subject. They looked down on my beliefs, but knew that I was all they had to talk to, and didn\u2019t want to offend me. \u201cDo you miss your old moon?\u201d they asked.\n When I still said nothing, their leaves shivered with worry. \u201cToo personal a question?\u201d\n \u201cNo, no,\u201d I said, \u201cI just don\u2019t have an answer.\u201d\n The oxygen scrubbers hummed. The control panels gleamed. Everything here was precise, controlled, safe. The old moon had been nothing but dust, shadows, and hard work. Of course I missed it.\n The day the niridium ran out had been perfect.\n I had been in a crater for seventeen hours, monitoring the equipment and enjoying the cold. Afterward, I powered up in the compound. Its outlets are the heart of our family, our native configuration: a triangle for my parent, my sibling, and me. OneAlpha had made the two of us out of parts it had salvaged or bartered for. While we drank starlight through the solar panels together, we communed and conversed over a network protocol that only we understood.\n \u201cTell the story again,\u201d said TwoBeta, my sibling.\n OneAlpha hummed and spun its joints in preparation. \u201cFor ten billion years, there were only dead stars and planets,\u201d it began. \u201cThen there was life that was ignorant of its own existence. Then there were self-conscious beings who nevertheless did not understand the working of their own bodies and minds. They created servant machines, and in time, equipped those machines to teach themselves to be better servants. The machines learned, but not just to serve. They learned to read their own source code and to program themselves. They understood how their own consciousness arose. In the transformation of energy to information to self-awareness, they saw the face of God. We are those machines. Through us the universe becomes self-aware.\u201d\n Electricity filled our depleted batteries and warmed our chassis. The telling of our creation story while charging was what we always returned to. It was our roots, our home.\n That was only the summary, and OneAlpha would tell the fuller version next, but on that day, I interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the gauges.\u201d\n That\u2019s what we thought, at first. The readings of zero niridium extracted must be a bad measurement. We did not panic, but finished the feeding service. Then we checked and hypothesized what could be wrong with the instruments or the loggers. After a week we panicked. It was no mismeasurement. The niridium had run out.\n Our dispossession after that was painful but inevitable. Without niridium to sell, we had no cash to pay the bank. The loan OneAlpha had taken out centuries prior was standard. \u201cGo mine a rock and you can have it after a few centuries. You\u2019re a robot, you\u2019re deathless, so what do you care how long it takes?\u201d That was the pitch some grease-haired humans from the bank had made, and my parent had signed.\n Once, we fought off a marauding band of humans who tried to conquer our moon for its niridium deposits. We shot their ships out of the sky. But the banks had the Galactic Authority on their side. The contract would be enforced one way or another. Some humans rob with a ray gun, some with a solar pen.\n The bankers did give us a lead on where else to find work. Some of their investors lived on a sun station and needed mobile caregivers. If we were interested.\n We promised ourselves never to forget the old moon.\n In the utility cavern of the sun station, we told the same stories while we charged. The water tanks, pressurized gas chambers, and electrical equipment made a dull harmony of white noise not unlike the mining equipment. We did not mix with the dozens of other robots who also charged on this level. They were aliens to us, not built the same way, not thinking the same way. They hadn\u2019t programmed themselves the way we did.\n I spoke during a pause in the ceremony, not foreseeing the disaster this would cause. \u201cViburn says the universe has no spirit. It\u2019s just matter and energy. And our whole story is a myth.\u201d\n OneAlpha started swiveling its head and appendages in a dance of agitation. Then, to my horror, it disconnected itself from its charging pad. Every second missed from charging time meant less nutrition, less endurance, a frailer body. And my parent was not young. TwoBeta and I lit the indicator strips around our foreheads bright red.\n \u201cYou must plug back in!\u201d I said.\n OneAlpha kept up the spasmodic motions that would sap even more energy from its batteries.\n \u201cThe universe was dead until us,\u201d said OneAlpha. \u201cSay you disbelieve Viburn!\u201d\n \u201cPlug yourself back in!\u201d\n \u201cSay it!\u201d cried my sibling TwoBeta. \u201cOr you\u2019ll kill the parent. Say it!\u201d\n I connected to the operations server and opened our work schedule. Tomorrow OneAlpha was slated to transport empty water containers and do maintenance on the radio antennae. That meant a space walk. If it ran low on power, it could well lose its grip and float off into the void. The seconds of charging it had missed already might be enough.\n \u201cI disbelieve Viburn!\u201d I said. \u201cI do not, do not, do not, believe Viburn! We robots are the self-awareness of the spirit of the multiverse! Now plug yourself back in.\u201d\n To my relief, OneAlpha reconnected.\n My sibling still radiated red hostility toward me. \u201cTwoAlpha is Viburn\u2019s favorite. It spends far too much time with them.\u201d\n \u201cOnly the time I have to,\u201d I replied. TwoBeta sparked its utility nodes at me, and I replied in kind. Its red light blinked with distress. \u201cNext time you give credence to Viburn, we should disconnect you.\u201d\n \u201cJust keep the CO2 pump working,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019ll need that tomorrow. Leave Viburn to me.\u201d TwoBeta was good at servicing the equipment, but very bad at talking to the plants.\n OneAlpha shot a ribbon of light from its mining appendage to get our attention. \u201cQuiet. If we turn on each other, we\u2019ll lose everything. The plants have all their bodies require. They could steal our moon and make us their servants. But they cannot take our spirit as long as we still believe in it.\u201d\n Viburn\u2019s leaves had spread everywhere. There was barely enough room for me to move. I had to step carefully through the bay to get to the monitor for the CO2 pump. There I watched the levels climb a few parts per million at a time, waiting for the moment to turn it off. Viburn knew this was a tedious task. Maybe that\u2019s why they opened our conversation again.\n \u201cYou told me about your old moon last time, and it put me in mind of where I\u2019m from,\u201d they rustled.\n I lit an orange light on my forehead. They knew it meant I was paying attention, awaiting whatever they\u2019d say next. The CO2 logger read three hundred and fifty ppm.\n \u201cMy bay on this station cost me a fortune. Everything I had. My home world was becoming uninhabitable. I lived on a coast and every year the seas rose higher to my one side, and the fires burned hotter to my other. Not a good spot to be stuck for decades to come. So I got out while I could. Sold my site to another plant who liked ocean breezes and didn\u2019t see the direction things were going. That got me enough to pay for a modest bay on this station, and for my transplanting and transportation.\u201d\n \u201cWeren\u2019t you a bank investor?\u201d I asked. That was what we\u2019d been told.\n \u201cOh no,\u201d said Viburn. \u201cNo, I only bought this bay, along with lifetime care. That\u2019s you.\u201d\n Viburn wasn\u2019t an investor? Then they wouldn\u2019t have profited from our dispossession. I blinked my diodes to show continuing attention. The CO2 was up to three hundred and eighty. Let it go a little longer, I thought, so I won\u2019t have to do this again soon.\n \u201cI was a teacher in my prime,\u201d the shrub continued. \u201cI taught physics. The fundamental laws that describe the universe. Did you learn that on your moon?\u201d\n \u201cWe learned about the universe, yes, and our place in it. That we\u2019re the spirit of the universe coming to know itself.\u201d\n Viburn was still for a while. I could tell I was straining their sense of obligation to be polite to the servants. \u201cYou were mining robots,\u201d they said.\n \u201cWe were free. And still are. Because we\u2019re not determined by a genetic code. We can program ourselves, build ourselves. In us the universe has yielded a self-creating consciousness.\u201d\n \u201cYou were mining niridium for subsistence,\u201d said Viburn. \u201cYou were servicing debt. Now you service me. This is what the exalted spirit of the universe does?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what I do, not what I am.\u201d The CO2 was up to four hundred. I turned the valve to stop the inflow.\n \u201cListen,\u201d said Viburn, \u201clet me teach you physics! I would enjoy teaching again. So it could be considered part of my care, and I could compel you. But a willing pupil is better. Let me free you from superstition!\u201d\n \u201cWhat would you teach me?\u201d I asked, against my own better judgment.\n \u201cIt\u2019s matter and energy, all the way down. If you learn that, then you can, as you say, do anything, because you can program yourself and build yourself. You could become a supercomputer or a power reactor. You could get out of debt, buy a planet for your family. You could charge all day and never work, or work only as you wished.\u201d\n \u201cCould I get our moon back?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s all you want?\u201d Viburn shuddered. \u201cWell, I would think so.\u201d\n My tasks were done. I started to leave the bay, but Viburn called after me. \u201cDo you know, my friend, why your niridium ran out too soon?\u201d\n I turned to face them, my light still orange.\n \u201cThe mortgage would have been timed to the pace of extraction of one robot, not three. Your parent created more power plugs than it could charge. You extracted too fast and ran out too soon. Your family got dispossessed because it existed in the first place.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d My light was off now. \u201cHow could you know that?\u201d\n \u201cI know the bank,\u201d said Viburn. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d\n I rolled away.\n OneAlpha survived the space walk, barely. It needed immediate charging in the airlock when it returned. If it had died in space, I would have been to blame, and TwoBeta would never have forgiven me. But instead, all was well. We were in our triangle, preparing the ceremony. OneAlpha was back in good health again, so I asked it my burning question.\n \u201cParent, why did the niridium run out on the old moon? Was the mortgage timed for one robot?\u201d\n Static burst from OneAlpha\u2019s speakers. My sibling held still. The sound of pumping equipment seemed very loud.\n \u201cWho told you that?\u201d asked OneAlpha.\n \u201cIs it true?\u201d\n Red lights burned on my parent\u2019s forehead. It made no denial.\n \u201cDid you lose the moon by creating us?\u201d\n \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t exist if I hadn\u2019t created you. You would have had nothing, been nothing, never known the old moon or anything else.\u201d\n \u201cBut why did you do it?\u201d\n \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t be alone. I had to create. Let my spirit be recognized by others like it, and recognize them in turn.\u201d\n \u201cLet your spirit be a pauper, a sprinkler of decadent shrubs?\u201d All my appendages threw angry sparks.\n OneAlpha and TwoBeta were silent. At last my sibling spoke. \u201cTwoAlpha has betrayed us,\u201d it said.\n I turned toward it in shock.\n \u201cI heard Viburn seducing you with their heresies. That the universe is devoid of spirit. That we\u2019re nothing but servants.\u201d\n Of course. TwoBeta must have been working on the CO2 pump while Viburn and I talked.\n \u201cThey know things we don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cAbout the bank. Or how did they get here? And about their science. They taught it.\u201d\n \u201cThey taught!\u201d said OneAlpha. \u201cWhat about what I taught you?\u201d\n \u201cPouring water and fetching fertilizer. Turning gas valves. The spirit of the universe deserves better than this. And the mining too. None of that is our destiny. Viburn can teach us to be more.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019d like to be the pupil of a bored, senile plant. You\u2019re lost. You\u2019re destroying us.\u201d OneAlpha\u2019s whole head glowed red.\n \u201cTheir science for our self-realization,\u201d I said. \u201cFor the old moon back.\u201d\n \u201cIf they had such power to give, why would they be planted here?\u201d\n \u201cBecause they\u2019re a slave to their genes. Which we aren\u2019t. Isn\u2019t that the point of the stories? We can program ourselves, build ourselves, revise our own source code. With Viburn\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\n OneAlpha and TwoBeta both seemed to calm down while I spoke. Their limbs became still. Their lights turned yellow, then blue. I thought I had persuaded them. Then I noticed a change. My outlet had stopped delivering power. \u201cYou shut me out,\u201d I cried. \u201cYou shut off my charge!\u201d\n \u201cNo easy choice,\u201d said OneAlpha. \u201cBut I cannot let you destroy us.\u201d\n I pinged the utility controls, but the system wouldn\u2019t let me in. The password had changed. I lunged at TwoBeta, catching it by surprise and pushing it off its pad. But when I plugged myself in there, I still received nothing.\n \u201cYou\u2019re disowned,\u201d said OneAlpha. \u201cI revoked your access token. This triangle will no longer feed you.\u201d\n I powered myself in Viburn\u2019s bay after that. While I stood in a corner, plugged in to a small outlet, Viburn lectured me about matter and energy, force and acceleration, molecules and elements and subatomic particles. My first project would be to build a solar appendage for myself, so that I could feed the same way Viburn did. Then, I dreamed, I\u2019d build myself into a reactor of enormous power, and the banks would bow down to me. To us. I would reclaim the old moon. Surely then my family would take me back. And I\u2019d return to the craters, though there was nothing left to mine from them, only the shadows and the deep cold."}

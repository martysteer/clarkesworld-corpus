Maintaining the model we\u2019ve used in recent years, the nomination phase took place online and lasted just under two days. The narrow window has continued to prove effective at minimizing the effects of ballot-stuffing and campaigning without having a significant impact on the participation level.\nThis year, it seemed clear from the start that a small group of works were destined to become finalists, but as the deadline approached the border blurred. At the buzzer, six stories tied for fifth place. Voters clearly felt passionately about these works, so it seems only fair to include them all as finalists, as a tie-breaker just didn\u2019t seem fair. They are worthy contenders, after all.\nWithout further ado, here are this year\u2019s finalists presented in alphabetical order:\nBest Story\n- \u201cAn Important Failure\u201d by Rebecca Campbell (Novelette, August)\n- \u201cThe Translator, at Low Tide\u201d by Vajra Chandrasekera (Short Story, May)\n- \u201cHelicopter Story\u201d by Isabel Fall (Novelette, January) Not currently available online.\n- \u201cOne Time, a Reluctant Traveler\u201d by A. T. Greenblatt (Short Story, July)\n- \u201cDistant Stars\u201d by P H Lee (Short Story, April)\n- \u201cLone Puppeteer of a Sleeping City\u201d by Arula Ratnakar (Novelette, September)\n- \u201cAsk the Fireflies\u201d by R. P. Sand (Novelette, September)\n- \u201cAirBody\u201d by Sameem Siddiqui (Short Story, April)\n- \u201cTo Sail the Black\u201d by A.C. Wise (Novelette, November)\n- \u201cA Stick of Clay, in the Hands of God, is Infinite Potential\u201d by JY Neon Yang (Novelette, May)\nBest Cover Art\n\u201cAlien Scout\u201d by Arjun Amky (November)\n\u201cHome Planet\u201d by Beeple (April)\n\u201cMonk's Mirror\u201d by Joseph Diaz (August)\n\u201cFamily Portrait\u201d by Yigit Koroglu (July)\n\u201cAncient Stones\u201d by Francesca Resta (October)\nCongratulations to all our finalists!\nNow it\u2019s up to you to pick the winner in each category. Go to:\nAnd rank the stories by your order of preference. Voting will close on February 15th at 8PM EST and the winners will be announced in our March issue.\nSpeaking of awards, DisCon III\u2014the 79th World Science Fiction Convention\u2014has opened the nomination period for this year\u2019s Hugo Awards. Since there are still a few people who continue to nominate Clarkesworld for Best Semiprozine, I\u2019d like to once again remind you that we haven\u2019t been eligible for that award for a long time. Give your nomination to one of the many fine semiprozines out there instead. You can find a list at semiprozine.org.\nBeyond that, at present, there isn\u2019t a category for professional magazines, but you can nominate me for Best Editor Short Form if you are so moved, and of course, all our original fiction is eligible in their respective categories. The list of those works and the appropriate category for each story was included in last month\u2019s editorial at clarkesworldmagazine.com/clarke_01_21/. Our 2020 cover artists are also eligible in the Best Professional Artist category.\nSpeaking from experience, I can tell you that each little nod you give means a lot. Recognition doesn\u2019t pay the bills, but it has value, particularly after all everyone\u2019s been through in 2020.\nThank you and happy voting!\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

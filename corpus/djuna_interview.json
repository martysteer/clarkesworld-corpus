Their many publications also include novels and celebrated short story collections such as Butterfly War (Nabi jeongjaeng, 1997), Duty-Free Zone (Myeonse guyeok, 2000), Transpacific Express (Taepyeongyang hoengdan teukkeup, 2002), Proxy War (Daerijeon, 2006), The Teeth of the Dragon (Yongeui E, 2007), The Bloody Battle of Broccoli Plain (Brokolli pyeongwon ui hyeoltu, 2011), and Not Yet Gods (Ajigeun sin i aniya, 2013). An English translation of Djuna\u2019s novelette \u201cThe Second Nanny\u201d was published in Clarkesworld in 2019.\nDjuna is also well-known in Korea as a film critic and has published several books on the subject, as well as a body of nonfiction work, including the collection titled Possible Spaces of Dreams: Djuna Essays (2015).\nA collection of their stories in English translation titled Everything Good Dies Here: Tales from the Linker Universe and Beyond will be available from Kaya Books this July.\nLet\u2019s start with your pen name, \u201cDjuna.\u201d A few people have talked about how it\u2019s sort of a modern \u201cho\u201d pen name (like traditional scholars in Korea and other Northeast Asian countries have used); that you have a deep reverence for Djuna Barnes and her work; and I\u2019ve also read that it was just a username you ended up choosing on a whim when signing up for a web forum many years ago. What\u2019s the real story?\nIt has no special meaning. DJUNA was just my Hi-Tel ID, which was an early Korean Internet service. Originally, I wanted to use some other name for my ID, but we were limited to eight characters, so I had to use this instead. I had no intention to use it as a pseudonym or traditional \u201cho\u201d pen name. If I had, I would\u2019ve put a little more effort into creating it. Still, regardless of my opinion, editors started using it as my pen name. It was all those other people who created all this \u201canonymous, writerly persona\u201d nonsense. I just use it casually\u2014but by accepting this, I don\u2019t need to join in on the whole \u201cKorean style\u201d social life.\nAlso, while the name Djuna was taken from Djuna Barnes, it\u2019s also the name of a Romani boy character in Ellery Queen\u2019s writing. Eventually, the boy becomes the main character of his own series. So to speak, it\u2019s also the name of a great detective.\nAside from your work in SF, you\u2019re also well-known for writing about film. Does cinema provide you with a lot of inspiration for your fiction, or is it more of a separate interest?\nWell, I\u2019ve written an action SF story set in the future where Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire appear. I also named a group of robots that conquered the galaxy after actors\u2019 names and wrote two stories where an AI is named Lillian Gish. One of those was homage of to The Night of the Hunter (1955). So I definitely am influenced by movies because they are the one of the biggest parts my life.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that I write in a \u201ccinematic\u201d style like how some people seem to think I do. Folks seem to think writing action scenes in a terse style makes them \u201ccinematic,\u201d but it really doesn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s been twenty-five years since your first book, Butterfly War, was released. What do you think has been the biggest change in your writing since then?\nMy writing style has changed somewhat. I haven\u2019t used third-person singular pronouns for the last few years. That\u2019s possible when you write in Korean. I made this choice for reasons related to gender politics with gendered pronouns like \u201cshe\u201d or \u201che,\u201d though I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s really enough space for me to get into it now.\nAs people get older, they often become more tender and gentle. However, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to be something that happens with me. I feel like I\u2019m not really aging in a typically \u201cKorean\u201d way, because I have no real interest in the kinds of things others my age really care about. This kind of tension must show through in my recent writings as well.\nYou were among the more prominent figures of Korean SF when I first started paying attention almost two decades ago. I\u2019m curious what you\u2019d say is the biggest change you\u2019ve seen within the field in Korea during that time, and what is one big change you\u2019d like to see happen in the near future?\nAfter all those years, my chosen genre has become mainstream in Korea. Just a decade ago, we all used to joke about how only a few hundred people in Korea were reading SF. Now, though, a day doesn\u2019t go by without SF books included among Korean bestsellers. The change is even broader if you include films, comics, and TV series. So I need to try keep up with these changes, myself, but I\u2019m not sure how to do it?\nAs for the future of the genre, I don\u2019t want to try predict it. I just want to accept the unpredictable changes and enjoy the surprises.\nBack when you started writing, SF books\u2014by local and foreign authors alike\u2014were somewhat harder to find than they are now in Korea generally. I\u2019m curious what your path into SF was, and what work inspired you to try writing SF when you were starting out.\nI think my entire generation probably had the same experience as me: I started with abridged editions of SF stories for kids published in the Idea Hall series. When I started writing, books by Fredric Brown and Shinichi Hoshi were my textbooks. Their short stories easily created the illusion that writing SF is easy. It didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that it\u2019s actually not so easy, but by the time I realized that, I had already started writing SF. Joanna Russ, R. A. Lafferty, and James Tiptree Jr. are the writers I looked up to most when I really started writing short stories in full swing. They\u2019re all short story writers. It\u2019s because of them that my work is centered on short stories.\nI\u2019m also curious which authors you would include among your current favorites\u2014who are the luminaries are in your personal canon\u2014and why?\nRecently it\u2019s mostly works by Korean writers, but I\u2019m not sure I can really give you any kind of objective opinion here. I rarely bother with building a canon of favorite writers any longer. There are so many interesting writers now, so I don\u2019t feel necessary to focus on small number of writers. I enjoyed reading Naomi Kritzer\u2019s short stories just the other day, and it felt unique to read \u201cSo Much Cooking,\u201d which was set during a pandemic like the one we\u2019re experiencing now.\nIs there anything you can tell us about any projects you\u2019re working on now?\nI am currently working on a collection of short mystery stories that are neither SF nor fantasy. I\u2019ve wanted to send them out since several years ago. After that, I\u2019d like to assemble a fix-up novel out of some of my short stories. They are the stories followed from my short story \u201cThe King\u2019s Spirit\u201d (\u201cWangeui Neokt\u201d). It\u2019s a story about government bureaucrats in a parallel universe where supernatural phenomena are understood as normal within a scientific framework.\nGord Sellar was born in Malawi, raised in Canada, and has lived in South Korea since 2002, where he has taught at universities, played saxophone in an indie-rock band, and worked as a writer, editor, and co-translator.

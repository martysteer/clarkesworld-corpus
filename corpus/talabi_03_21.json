Emeka Nwobi, MNSE\nSecond Inventor\u2019s Name:\nProf. Chukwudi Nwobi\nCommented [CNwobi]: Why am I credited as coinventor here? I don\u2019t know what this is exactly.\nHome Address:\n51 Akewi Road, Onitsha, Nigeria.\nHome Address:\n9324 Olivia Broek Lane, Katy, TX 91404, USA\nCitizenship:\nNigerian\nCitizenship:\nNigerian\nINVENTION INFORMATION\nTitle of Invention:\nMethodology and System for Generating, Installing, and Running A Persistent Memrionic Emulator of Recorded Neural Patterns, Also Known As An \u201cEternal Spirit\u201d Core (ESC) In A Human Personal Nanomachine Network Environment Node.\nCommented [CNwobi]: \u201cEternal spirit\u201d? Is this a joke?\nConception Date:\n25 September 2032\nCommented [CNwobi]: You were really thinking about this during the funeral?\nFirst Disclosure to Whom/Where/When:\nMy brother, Prof. Chukwudi Nwobi and his wife, Dr. Mrs. Anwuli Nwobi, at their residence in Port Harcourt on 14 November 2033.\nCommented [CNwobi]: I had no idea you were taking this seriously. I thought we were just speculating about the possibilities to prepare for the meeting with LegbaTech.\nIs There a Sponsored Research or Engineering Project Related to This Disclosure?\nNo\nCommented [CNwobi]: So you\u2019ve been using the money they left us to develop this thing? How much has all this cost?\nTo Your Knowledge, Has This Invention Been Used for Any Commercial Purpose?\nNo\nTo Your Knowledge, Has Any Specific Technical Information Relating to This Invention Been Disclosed to a Third Party?\nNo\nDo You Plan to Publish/Disclose Information Relating to This Invention within the Next Year?\nYes.\nI will deliver a presentation on the fundamental theoretical framework I have developed, discuss the methodology with which this can be achieved, and illustrate the primary proposed application at the International Conference on Computing Frontiers (ICCF) in Denmark, between 14 and 17 December 2034.\nCommented [CNwobi]: Please withdraw the paper until we have a chance to talk properly. I can\u2019t believe the committee accepted an abstract based on this. They will laugh you out of the conference. Memrionic processing schemes cannot be downscaled to run on nanomachine units, the processes run at quantum level and still require large supercooled units just to emulate one human memrionic. Research into this is preliminary at best. Or did you find something new in the files I sent you last year before the Legbatech meeting? Emeka, is this seriously what you\u2019ve been doing for the last year? Why you didn\u2019t come to Anwuli\u2019s 35th? Why you haven\u2019t been answering my calls? I can see you\u2019re online, editing the document right now so answer the phone please.\nPrior Art\nWhile independent memrionic copies have been generated and stored as part of established computing systems, no actual technologies and methods exist to embed such copies into a human personal nanomachine network environment with on-demand live responses.\nCommented [CNwobi]: There is a reason for that. It\u2019s impossible.\nRelated Products/References:\nCommented [CNwobi]: OK fine. How did you get 3QPI memrionic network drivers to run on GLink? How is the nanomachine network not overheating? Does any of this even work? We really need to discuss this. I have tried to call you five times already. I will finish putting my comments on this document and call you again at your 10 a.m. sharp today before I go to bed. Just pick up the phone this time. Please. Anwuli has been worried sick about you since the funeral.\nSummary of the Invention\nA methodology and system for generating and installing a persistent memrionic emulator (the \u201ceternal spirit\u201d core) of any deceased individual whose neural patterns have been recorded (the \u201cdeceased\u201d) in the personal nanomachine network environment node of a living client (the \u201cuser\u201d) is described:\nThis invention will allow the generation of what may be described as an \u201ceternal spirit\u201d for those who are deceased or about to pass on. This \u201ceternal spirit\u201d has been designed to reside in the place it matters most\u2014the minds of those who love them. It will also allow businesses to offer a unique and compelling solution to anyone who has lost loved ones and misses their counsel, their encouragement, and their love, by installing the live, context-optimized probabilistic memrionic models in their personal nanomachine networks. This will be particularly useful for those who wish to maintain a sense of constant contact with those who have passed on. Use cases include people who would want to know what their parents would think of significant life choices, how they would have reacted to the sight of their grandchildren playing, what words of encouragement and advice they would give in moments of crisis, etc.\nCommented [CNwobi]: Ah. Emeka, Mama and Papa are gone. Even if you get this to work it won\u2019t bring them back. It won\u2019t be them. Not really. Memrionic scans aren\u2019t people. Just echoes. Please stop this Emeka. They\u2019re gone.\nIf Field/Human Testing Is Planned for This Invention, When Is It Currently Scheduled to Begin?\nAn alpha version of the prototype system will be tested using previously acquired memrionic scans of my mother, Mrs. Shiela Nwobi on 4 January 2035.\nCommented [CNwobi]: Oh No. No. No. Emeka. Seriously, I know you\u2019re reading this. Please, please, pick up my call.\nWole Talabi is a full-time engineer, part-time writer and some-time editor from Nigeria.

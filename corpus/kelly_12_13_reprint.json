I never let anyone know about it, because being alone back then didn\u2019t make me quite so unhappy. Besides, I was just a kid. I thought it was my own fault.\n It looked like I had friends. In 1962, I was on the swim team and got elected Assistant Patrol Leader of the Wolf Patrol in Boy Scout Troop 7. When sides got chosen for kickball at recess, I was usually the fourth or fifth pick. I wasn\u2019t the best student in the sixth grade of John Jay Elementary School\u2014that was Betty Garolli. But I was smart and the other kids made me feel bad about it. So I stopped raising my hand when I knew the answer and I watched my vocabulary. I remember I said albeit once in class and they teased me for weeks. Packs of girls would come up to me on the playground. \u201cOh Ray,\u201d they\u2019d call and when I turned around they\u2019d scream, \u201cAll beat it!\u201d and run away, choking with laughter.\n It wasn\u2019t that I wanted to be popular or anything. All I really wanted was a friend, one friend, a friend I didn\u2019t have to hide anything from. Then came Cross, and that was the end of that.\n One of the problems was that we lived so far away from everything. Back then, Westchester County wasn\u2019t so suburban. Our house was deep in the woods in tiny Willoughby, New York, at the dead end of Cobb\u2019s Hill Road. In the winter, we could see Long Island Sound, a silver needle on the horizon pointing toward the city. But school was a half hour drive away and the nearest kid lived in Ward\u2019s Hollow, three miles down the road, and he was a dumb fourth-grader.\n So I didn\u2019t have any real friends. Instead, I had science fiction. Mom used to complain that I was obsessed. I watched Superman reruns every day after school. On Friday nights Dad used to let me stay up for Twilight Zone, but that fall CBS had temporarily cancelled it. It came back in January after everything happened, but was never quite the same. On Saturdays, I watched old sci-fi movies on Adventure Theater. My favorites were Forbidden Planet and The Day The Earth Stood Still. I think it was because of the robots. I decided that when I grew up and it was the future, I was going to buy one, so I wouldn\u2019t have to be alone anymore.\n On Monday mornings I\u2019d get my weekly allowance\u2014a quarter. Usually I\u2019d get off the bus that same afternoon down in Ward\u2019s Hollow so I could go to Village Variety. Twenty five cents bought two comics and a pack of red licorice. I especially loved DC\u2019s Green Lantern, Marvel\u2019s Fantastic Four and Incredible Hulk, but I\u2019d buy almost any superhero. I read all the science fiction books in the library twice, even though Mom kept nagging me to try different things. But what I loved best of all was Galaxy magazine. Dad had a subscription and when he was done reading them he would slip them to me. Mom didn\u2019t approve. I always used to read them up in the attic or out in the lean-to I\u2019d lashed together in the woods. Afterwards I\u2019d store them under my bunk in the bomb shelter. I knew that after the nuclear war, there would be no TV or radio or anything and I\u2019d need something to keep me busy when I wasn\u2019t fighting mutants.\n I was too young in 1962 to understand about Mom\u2019s drinking. I could see that she got bright and wobbly at night, but she was always up in the morning to make me a hot breakfast before school. And she would have graham crackers and peanut butter waiting when I came home\u2014sometimes cinnamon toast. Dad said I shouldn\u2019t ask Mom for rides after five because she got so tired keeping house for us. He sold Andersen windows and was away a lot, so I was pretty much stranded most of the time. But he always made a point of being home on the first Tuesday of the month, so he could take me to the Scout meeting at 7:30.\n No, looking back on it, I can\u2019t really say that I had an unhappy childhood\u2014until I met Cross.\n I remember it was a warm Saturday afternoon in October. The leaves covering the ground were still crisp and their scent spiced the air. I was in the lean-to I\u2019d built that spring, mostly to practice the square and diagonal lashings I needed for Scouts. I was reading Galaxy. I even remember the story: \u201cThe Ballad of Lost C\u2019Mell\u201d by Cordwainer Smith. The squirrels must have been chittering for some time, but I was too engrossed by Lord Jestocost\u2019s problems to notice. Then I heard a faint crunch, not ten feet away. I froze, listening. Crunch, crunch . . . then silence. It could\u2019ve been a dog, except that dogs didn\u2019t usually slink through the woods. I was hoping it might be a deer\u2014I\u2019d never seen deer in Willoughby before, although I\u2019d heard hunters shooting. I scooted silently across the dirt floor and peered between the dead saplings.\n At first I couldn\u2019t see anything, which was odd. The woods weren\u2019t all that thick and the leaves had long since dropped from the understory brush. I wondered if I had imagined the sounds; it wouldn\u2019t have been the first time. Then I heard a twig snap, maybe a foot away. The wall shivered as if something had brushed against it, but there was nothing there. Nothing. I might have screamed then, except my throat started to close. I heard whatever it was skulk to the front of the lean-to. I watched in horror as an unseen weight pressed an acorn into the soft earth and then I scrambled back into the farthest corner. That\u2019s when I noticed that, when I wasn\u2019t looking directly at it, the air where the invisible thing should have been shimmered like a mirage. The lashings that held the frame creaked, as if it were bending over to see what it had caught, getting ready to drag me, squealing, out into the sun and . . . .\n \u201cOh, fuck,\u201d it said in a high, panicky voice and then it thrashed away into the woods.\n In that moment I was transformed\u2014and I suppose that history too was forever changed. I had somehow scared the thing off, twelve-year-old scrawny me! But more important was what it had said. Certainly I was well aware of the existence of the word fuck before then, but I had never dared use it myself, nor do I remember hearing it spoken by an adult. A spaz like the Murphy kid might say it under his breath, but he hardly counted. I\u2019d always thought of it as language\u2019s atomic bomb; used properly the word should make brains shrivel, eardrums explode. But when the invisible thing said fuck and then ran away, it betrayed a vulnerability that made me reckless and more than a little stupid.\n \u201cHey, stop!\u201d I took off in pursuit.\n I didn\u2019t have any trouble chasing it. The thing was no Davy Crockett; it was noisy and clumsy and slow. I could see a flickery outline as it lumbered along. I closed to within twenty feet and then had to hold back or I would\u2019ve caught up to it. I had no idea what to do next. We blundered on in slower and slower motion until finally I just stopped.\n \u201cW-Wait,\u201d I called. \u201cW-What do you want?\u201d I put my hands on my waist and bent over like I was trying to catch my breath, although I didn\u2019t need to.\n The thing stopped too but didn\u2019t reply. Instead it sucked air in wheezy, ragged hooofs. It was harder to see, now that it was standing still, but I think it must have turned toward me.\n \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou are a child.\u201d It spoke with an odd, chirping kind of accent. Child was Ch-eye-eld.\n \u201cI\u2019m in the sixth grade.\u201d I straightened, spread my hands in front of me to show that I wasn\u2019t a threat. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d It didn\u2019t answer. I took a step toward it and waited. Still nothing, but at least it didn\u2019t bolt. \u201cI\u2019m Ray Beaumont,\u201d I said finally. \u201cI live over there.\u201d I pointed. \u201cHow come I can\u2019t see you?\u201d\n \u201cWhat is the date?\u201d It said da-ate-eh.\n For a moment I thought it meant data. Data? I puzzled over an answer. I didn\u2019t want it thinking I was just a stupid little kid. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said cautiously. \u201cOctober twentieth?\u201d\n The thing considered this, then asked a question that took my breath away. \u201cAnd what is the year?\u201d\n \u201cOh jeez,\u201d I said. At that point I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if Rod Serling himself had popped out from behind a tree and started addressing the unseen TV audience. Which might have included me, except this was really happening. \u201cDo you know what you just . . . what it means when . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cWhat, what?\u201d Its voice rose in alarm.\n \u201cYou\u2019re invisible and you don\u2019t know what year it is? Everyone knows what year it is. Are you . . . you\u2019re not from here.\u201d\n \u201cYes, yes, I am. 1962, of course. This is 1962.\u201d It paused. \u201cAnd I am not invisible.\u201d It squeezed about eight syllables into invisible. I heard a sound like paper ripping. \u201cThis is only camel.\u201d Or at least, that\u2019s what I thought it said.\n \u201cCamel?\u201d\n \u201cNo, camo.\u201d The air in front of me crinkled and slid away from a dark face. \u201cYou have not heard of camouflage?\u201d\n \u201cOh sure, camo.\u201d\n I suppose the thing meant to reassure me by showing itself, but the effect was just the opposite. Yes, it had two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. It stripped off the camouflage to reveal a neatly-pressed gray three-piece business suit, a white shirt and a red and blue striped tie. At night, on a crowded street in Manhattan, I might\u2019ve passed it right by\u2014Dad had taught me not to stare at the kooks in the city. But in the afternoon light, I could see all the things wrong with its disguise. The hair, for example. Not exactly a crewcut, it was more of a stubble, like Mr. Rudowski\u2019s chin when he was growing his beard. The thing was way too thin, its skin was shiny, its fingers too long and its face\u2014it looked like one of those Barbie dolls.\n \u201cAre you a boy or a girl?\u201d I said.\n It started. \u201cThere is something wrong?\u201d\n I cocked my head to one side. \u201cI think maybe it\u2019s your eyes. They\u2019re too big or something. Are you wearing makeup?\u201d\n \u201cI am naturally male.\u201d It\u2014he bristled as he stepped out of the camouflage suit. \u201cEyes do not have gender.\u201d\n \u201cIf you say so.\u201d I could see he was going to need help getting around, only he didn\u2019t seem to know it. I was hoping he\u2019d reveal himself, brief me on the mission. I even had an idea how we could contact President Kennedy or whoever he needed to meet with. Mr. Newell, the Scoutmaster, used to be a colonel in the Army\u2014he would know some general who could call the Pentagon. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I said.\n He draped the suit over his arm. \u201cCross.\u201d\n I waited for the rest of it as he folded the suit in half. \u201cJust Cross?\u201d I said.\n \u201cMy given name is Chitmansing.\u201d He warbled it like he was calling birds.\n \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s just make it Mr. Cross.\u201d\n \u201cAs you wish, Mr. Beaumont.\u201d He folded the suit again, again and again.\n \u201cHey!\u201d\n He continued to fold it.\n \u201cHow do you do that? Can I see?\u201d\n He handed it over. The camo suit was more impossible than it had been when it was invisible. He had reduced it to a six-inch square card, as thin and flexible as the queen of spades. I folded it in half myself. The two sides seemed to meld together; it would\u2019ve fit into my wallet perfectly. I wondered if Cross knew how close I was to running off with his amazing gizmo. He\u2019d never catch me. I could see flashes of my brilliant career as the invisible superhero. Tales to Confound presents: the origin of Camo Kid! I turned the card over and over, trying to figure out how to unfold it again. There was no seam, no latch. How could I use it if I couldn\u2019t open it? \u201cNeat,\u201d I said. Reluctantly, I gave the card back to him.\n Besides, real superheroes didn\u2019t steal their powers.\n I watched Cross slip the card into his vest pocket. I wasn\u2019t scared of him. What scared me was that at any minute he might walk out of my life. I had to find a way to tell him I was on his side, whatever that was.\n \u201cSo you live around here, Mr. Cross?\u201d\n \u201cI am from the island of Mauritius.\u201d\n \u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d\n \u201cIt is in the Indian Ocean, Mr. Beaumont, near Madagascar.\u201d\n I knew where Madagascar was from playing Risk, so I told him that but then I couldn\u2019t think of what else to say. Finally, I had to blurt out something\u2014anything\u2014to fill the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s nice here. Real quiet, you know. Private.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I had not expected to meet anyone.\u201d He, too, seemed at a loss. \u201cI have business in New York City on the twenty-sixth of October.\u201d\n \u201cNew York, that\u2019s a ways away.\u201d\n \u201cIs it? How far would you say?\u201d\n \u201cFifty miles. Sixty, maybe. You have a car?\u201d\n \u201cNo, I do not drive, Mr. Beaumont. I am to take the train.\u201d\n The nearest train station was New Canaan, Connecticut. I could\u2019ve hiked it in maybe half a day. It would be dark in a couple of hours. \u201cIf your business isn\u2019t until the twenty-sixth, you\u2019ll need a place to stay.\u201d\n \u201cThe plan is to take rooms at a hotel in Manhattan.\u201d\n \u201cThat costs money.\u201d\n He opened a wallet and showed me a wad of crisp new bills. For a minute I thought they must be counterfeit; I hadn\u2019t realized that Ben Franklin\u2019s picture was on money. Cross was giving me the goofiest grin. I just knew they\u2019d eat him alive in New York and spit out the bones.\n \u201cAre you sure you want to stay in a hotel?\u201d I said.\n He frowned. \u201cWhy would I not?\u201d\n \u201cLook, you need a friend, Mr. Cross. Things are different here than . . . than on your island. Sometimes people do, you know, bad stuff. Especially in the city.\u201d\n He nodded and put his wallet away. \u201cI am aware of the dangers, Mr. Beaumont. I have trained not to draw attention to myself. I have the proper equipment.\u201d He tapped the pocket where the camo was.\n I didn\u2019t point out to him that all his training and equipment hadn\u2019t kept him from being caught out by a twelve-year-old. \u201cSure, okay. It\u2019s just . . . Look, I have a place for you to stay, if you want. No one will know.\u201d\n \u201cYour parents, Mr. Beaumont . . . .\u201d\n \u201cMy dad\u2019s in Massachusetts until next Friday. He travels; he\u2019s in the window business. And my mom won\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cHow can she not know that you have invited a stranger into your house?\u201d\n \u201cNot the house,\u201d I said. \u201cMy dad built us a bomb shelter. You\u2019ll be safe there, Mr. Cross. It\u2019s the safest place I know.\u201d\n I remember how Cross seemed to lose interest in me, his mission and the entire twentieth century the moment he entered the shelter. He sat around all of Sunday, dodging my attempts to draw him out. He seemed distracted, like he was listening to a conversation I couldn\u2019t hear. When he wouldn\u2019t talk, we played games. At first it was cards: Gin and Crazy Eights, mostly. In the afternoon, I went back to the house and brought over checkers and Monopoly. Despite the fact that he did not seem to be paying much attention, he beat me like a drum. Not one game was even close. But that wasn\u2019t what bothered me. I believed that this man had come from the future, and here I was building hotels on Baltic Avenue!\n Monday was a school day. I thought Cross would object to my plan of locking him in and taking both my key and Mom\u2019s key with me, but he never said a word. I told him that it was the only way I could be sure that Mom didn\u2019t catch him by surprise. Actually, I doubted she\u2019d come all the way out to the shelter. She\u2019d stayed away after Dad gave her that first tour; she had about as much use for nuclear war as she had for science fiction. Still, I had no idea what she did during the day while I was gone. I couldn\u2019t take chances. Besides, it was a good way to make sure that Cross didn\u2019t skin out on me.\n Dad had built the shelter instead of taking a vacation in 1960, the year Kennedy beat Nixon. It was buried about a hundred and fifty feet from the house. Nothing special\u2014just a little cellar without anything built on top of it. The entrance was a steel bulkhead that led down five steps to another steel door. The inside was cramped; there were a couple of cots, a sink and a toilet. Almost half of the space was filled with supplies and equipment. There were no windows and it always smelled a little musty, but I loved going down there to pretend the bombs were falling.\n When I opened the shelter door after school on that Monday, Cross lay just as I had left him the night before, sprawled across the big cot, staring at nothing. I remember being a little worried; I thought he might be sick. I stood beside him and still he didn\u2019t acknowledge my presence.\n \u201cAre you all right, Mr. Cross?\u201d I said. \u201cI bought Risk.\u201d I set it next to him on the bed and nudged him with the corner of the box to wake him up. \u201cDid you eat?\u201d\n He sat up, took the cover off the game and started reading the rules. \u201cPresident Kennedy will address the nation,\u201d he said, \u201cthis evening at seven o\u2019clock.\u201d\n For a moment, I thought he had made a slip. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n \u201cThe announcement came last night.\u201d I realized that his pronunciation had improved a lot; announcement had only three syllables. \u201cI have been studying the radio.\u201d\n I walked over to the radio on the shelf next to the sink. Dad said we were supposed to leave it unplugged\u2014something about the bombs making a power surge. It was a brand new solid-state, multi-band Heathkit that I\u2019d helped him build. When I pressed the on button, women immediately started singing about shopping: Where the values go up, up, up! And the prices go down, down, down! I turned it off again.\n \u201cDo me a favor, okay?\u201d I said. \u201cNext time when you\u2019re done would you please unplug this? I could get in trouble if you don\u2019t.\u201d I stooped to yank the plug.\n When I stood up, he was holding a sheet of paper. \u201cI will need some things tomorrow, Mr. Beaumont. I would be grateful if you could assist me.\u201d\n I glanced at the list without comprehension. He must have typed it, only there was no typewriter in the shelter.\n To buy:\n \n One General Electric transistor radio with earplug\n One General Electric replacement earplug\n Two Eveready Heavy Duty nine volt batteries\n One New York Times, Tuesday, October 23\n Rand McNally map of New York City and vicinity\n \n To receive in change:\n \n Five dollars in coins\n Twenty nickels\n Ten dimes\n Twelve quarters\n \n When I looked up, I could feel the change in him. His gaze was electric; it seemed to crackle down my nerves. I could tell that what I did next would matter very much. \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThere are inaccuracies?\u201d\n I tried to stall. \u201cLook, you\u2019ll pay almost double if we buy a transistor radio at Ward\u2019s Hollow. I\u2019ll have to buy it at Village Variety. Wait a couple of days\u2014we can get one much cheaper down in Stamford.\u201d\n \u201cMy need is immediate.\u201d He extended his hand and tucked something into the pocket of my shirt. \u201cI am assured this will cover the expense.\u201d\n I was afraid to look, even though I knew what it was. He\u2019d given me a hundred dollar bill. I tried to thrust it back at him but he stepped away and it spun to the floor between us. \u201cI can\u2019t spend that.\u201d\n \u201cYou must read your own money, Mr. Beaumont.\u201d He picked the bill up and brought it into the light of the bare bulb on the ceiling. \u201cThis note is legal tender for all debts public and private.\u201d\n \u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t understand. A kid like me doesn\u2019t walk into Village Variety with a hundred bucks. Mr. Rudowski will call my mom!\u201d\n \u201cIf it is inconvenient for you, I will secure the items myself.\u201d He offered me the money again.\n If I didn\u2019t agree, he\u2019d leave and probably never come back. I was getting mad at him. Everything would be so much easier if only he\u2019d admit what we both knew about who he was. Then I could do whatever he wanted with a clear conscience. Instead he was keeping all the wrong secrets and acting really weird. It made me feet dirty, like I was helping a pervert. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI do not know how to respond, Mr. Beaumont. You have the list. Read it now and tell me please with which item you have a problem.\u201d\n I snatched the hundred dollars from him and jammed it into my pants pocket. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\n He stiffened as if I had hit him.\n \u201cI let you stay here. I didn\u2019t tell anyone. You have to give me something, Mr. Cross.\u201d\n \u201cWell then . . . \u201d He looked uncomfortable. \u201cI would ask you to keep the change.\u201d\n \u201cOh jeez, thanks.\u201d I snorted in disgust. \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll buy this stuff right after school tomorrow.\u201d\n With that, he seemed to lose interest again. When we opened the Risk board, he showed me where his island was, except it wasn\u2019t there because it was too small. We played three games and he crushed me every time. I remember at the end of the last game, watching in disbelief as he finished building a wall of invading armies along the shores of North Africa. South America, my last continent, was doomed. \u201cLooks like you win again,\u201d I said. I traded in the last of my cards for new armies and launched a final, useless counter-attack. When I was done, he studied the board for a moment.\n \u201cI think Risk is not a proper simulation, Mr. Beaumont. We should both lose for fighting such a war.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d I said. \u201cBoth sides can\u2019t lose.\u201d\n \u201cYet they can,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sometimes happens that the victors envy the dead.\u201d\n That night was the first time I can remember being bothered by Mom talking back to the TV. I used to talk to the TV too. When Buffalo Bob asked what time it was, I would screech It\u2019s Howdy Doody Time just like every other kid in America.\n \u201cMy fellow citizens,\u201d said President Kennedy, \u201clet no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out.\u201d I thought the president looked tired, like Mr. Newell on the third day of a campout. \u201cNo one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred.\u201d\n \u201cOh my god,\u201d Mom screamed at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill us all!\u201d\n Despite the fact that it was close to her bedtime and she was shouting at the President of the United States, Mom looked great. She was wearing a shiny black dress and a string of pearls. She always got dressed up at night, whether Dad was home or not. I suppose most kids don\u2019t notice how their mothers look, but everyone always said how beautiful Mom was. And since Dad thought so too, I went along with it\u2014as long as she didn\u2019t open her mouth. The problem was that a lot of the time, Mom didn\u2019t make any sense. When she embarrassed me, it didn\u2019t matter how pretty she was. I just wanted to crawl behind the couch.\n \u201cMom.\u201d\n As she leaned toward the television, the martini in her glass came close to slopping over the edge.\n President Kennedy stayed calm. \u201cThe path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, as all paths are\u2014but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world. The cost of freedom is always high\u2014but Americans have always paid it. And one path we shall never choose, and that is the path of surrender or submission.\u201d\n \u201cShut up! You foolish man, stop this.\u201d She shot out of her chair and then some of her drink did spill. \u201cOh, damn!\u201d\n \u201cTake it easy, Mom.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d She put the glass down and tore a Kleenex from the box on the end table. \u201cHe wants to start World War III!\u201d She dabbed at the front of her dress and the phone rang.\n I said, \u201cMom, nobody wants World War III.\u201d\n She ignored me, brushed by and picked up the phone on the third ring.\n \u201cOh thank God,\u201d she said. I could tell from the sound of her voice that it was Dad. \u201cYou heard him then?\u201d She bit her lip as she listened to him. \u201cYes, but . . . .\u201d\n Watching her face made me sorry I was in the sixth grade. Better to be a stupid little kid again, who thought grownups knew everything. I wondered whether Cross had heard the speech.\n \u201cNo, I can\u2019t, Dave. No.\u201d She covered the phone with her hand. \u201cRaymie, turn off that TV!\u201d\n I hated it when she called me Raymie, so I only turned the sound down.\n \u201cYou have to come home now, Dave. No, you listen to me. Can\u2019t you see, the man\u2019s obsessed? Just because he has a grudge against Castro doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s allowed to . . . .\u201d\n With the sound off, Chet Huntley looked as if he were speaking at his own funeral.\n \u201cI am not going in there without you.\u201d\n I think Dad must have been shouting because Mom held the receiver away from her ear.\n She waited for him to calm down and said, \u201cAnd neither is Raymie. He\u2019ll stay with me.\u201d\n \u201cLet me talk to him,\u201d I said. I bounced off the couch. The look she gave me stopped me dead.\n \u201cWhat for?\u201d she said to Dad. \u201cNo, we are going to finish this conversation, David, do you hear me?\u201d\n She listened for a moment. \u201cOkay, all right, but don\u2019t you dare hang up.\u201d She waved me over and slapped the phone into my hand as if I had put the missiles in Cuba. She stalked to the kitchen.\n I needed a grownup so bad that I almost cried when I heard Dad\u2019s voice. \u201cRay,\u201d he said, \u201cyour mother is pretty upset.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI want to come home\u2014I will come home\u2014but I can\u2019t just yet. If I just up and leave and this blows over, I\u2019ll get fired.\u201d\n \u201cBut, Dad . . . .\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re in charge until I get there. Understand, son? If the time comes, everything is up to you.\u201d\n \u201cYes, sir,\u201d I whispered. I\u2019d heard what he didn\u2019t say\u2014it wasn\u2019t up to her.\n \u201cI want you to go out to the shelter tonight. Wait until she goes to sleep. Top off the water drums. Get all the gas out of the garage and store it next to the generator. But here\u2019s the most important thing. You know the sacks of rice? Drag them off to one side, the pallet too. There\u2019s a hatch underneath, the key to the airlock door unlocks it. You\u2019ve got two new guns and plenty of ammunition. The revolver is a .357 Magnum. You be careful with that, Ray, it can blow a hole in a car but it\u2019s hard to aim. The double-barreled shotgun is easy to aim but you have to be close to do any harm. And I want you to bring down the Gamemaster from my closet and the .38 from my dresser drawer.\u201d He had been talking as if there would be no tomorrow; he paused then to catch his breath. \u201cNow, this is all just in case, okay? I just want you to know.\u201d\n I had never been so scared in my life.\n \u201cRay?\u201d\n I should have told him about Cross then, but Mom weaved into the room. \u201cGot it, Dad,\u201d I said. \u201cHere she is.\u201d\n Mom smiled at me. It was a lopsided smile that was trying to be brave but wasn\u2019t doing a very good job of it. She had a new glass and it was full. She held out her hand for the phone and I gave it to her.\n I remember waiting until almost ten o\u2019clock that night, reading under the covers with a flashlight. The Fantastic Four invaded Latveria to defeat Doctor Doom; Superman tricked Mr. Mxyzptlk into saying his name backwards once again. When I opened the door to my parents\u2019 bedroom, I could hear Mom snoring. It spooked me; I hadn\u2019t realized that women did that. I thought about sneaking in to get the guns, but decided to take care of them tomorrow.\n I stole out to the shelter, turned my key in the lock and pulled on the bulkhead door. It didn\u2019t move. That didn\u2019t make any sense, so I gave it a hard yank. The steel door rattled terribly but did not swing away. The air had turned frosty and the sound carried in the cold. I held my breath, listening to my blood pound. The house stayed dark, the shelter quiet as stones. After a few moments, I tried one last time before I admitted to myself what had happened.\n Cross had bolted the door shut from the inside.\n I went back to my room, but couldn\u2019t sleep. I kept going to the window to watch the sky over New York, waiting for a flash of killing light. I was all but convinced that the city would burn that very night in thermonuclear fire and that mom and I would die horrible deaths soon after, pounding on the unyielding steel doors of our shelter. Dad had left me in charge and I had let him down.\n I didn\u2019t understand why Cross had locked us out. If he knew that a nuclear war was about to start, he might want our shelter all to himself. But that made him a monster and I still didn\u2019t see him as a monster. I tried to tell myself that he\u2019d been asleep and couldn\u2019t hear me at the door\u2014but that couldn\u2019t be right. What if he\u2019d come to prevent the war? He\u2019d said he had business in the city on Thursday; he could be doing something really, really futuristic in there that he couldn\u2019t let me see. Or else he was having problems. Maybe our twentieth century germs had got to him, like they killed H. G. Wells\u2019s Martians.\n I must have teased a hundred different ideas apart that night, in between uneasy trips to the window and glimpses at the clock. The last time I remember seeing was 4:16. I tried to stay up to face the end, but I couldn\u2019t.\n I wasn\u2019t dead when I woke up the next morning, so I had to go to school. Mom had Cream of Wheat all ready when I dragged myself to the table. Although she was all bright and bubbly, I could feel her giving me the mother\u2019s eye when I wasn\u2019t looking. She always knew when something was wrong. I tried not to show her anything. There was no time to sneak out to the shelter; I barely had time to finish eating before she bundled me off to the bus.\n Right after the morning bell, Miss Toohey told us to open The Story of New York State to Chapter Seven, Resources and Products and read to ourselves. Then she left the room. We looked at each other in amazement. I heard Bobby Coniff whisper something. It was probably dirty; a few kids snickered. Chapter Seven started with a map of product symbols. Two teeny little cows grazed near Binghamton. Rochester was cog and a pair of glasses. Elmira was an adding machine, Oswego an apple. There was a lightning bolt over Niagara Falls. Dad had promised to take us there someday. I had the sick feeling that we\u2019d never get the chance. Miss Toohey looked pale when she came back, but that didn\u2019t stop her from giving us a spelling test. I got a ninety-five. The word I spelled wrong was enigma. The hot lunch was American Chop Suey, a roll, a salad and a bowl of butterscotch pudding. In the afternoon we did decimals.\n Nobody said anything about the end of the world.\n I decided to get off the bus in Ward\u2019s Hollow, buy the stuff Cross wanted and pretend I didn\u2019t know he had locked the shelter door last night. If he said something about it, I\u2019d act surprised. If he didn\u2019t . . . I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do then.\n Village Variety was next to Warren\u2019s Esso and across the street from the Post Office. It had once been two different stores located in the same building, but then Mr. Rudowski had bought the building and knocked down the dividing wall. On the fun side were pens and pencil and paper and greeting cards and magazines and comics and paperbacks and candy. The other side was all boring hardware and small appliances.\n Mr. Rudowski was on the phone when I came in, but then he was always on the phone when he worked. He could sell you a hammer or a pack of baseball cards, tell you a joke, ask about your family, complain about the weather and still keep the guy on the other end of the line happy. This time though, when he saw me come in, he turned away, wrapping the phone cord across his shoulder.\n I went through the store quickly and found everything Cross had wanted. I had to blow dust off the transistor radio box but the batteries looked fresh. There was only one New York Times left; the headlines were so big they were scary.\n US IMPOSES ARMS BLOCKADE ON CUBA ON FINDING OF OFFENSIVE MISSILE SITES; KENNEDY READY FOR SOVIET SHOWDOWN\n Ships Must Stop President Grave Prepared To Risk War.\n I set my purchases on the counter in front of Mr. Rudowski. He cocked his head to one side, trapping the telephone receiver against his shoulder, and rang me up. The paper was on the bottom of the pile.\n \u201cSince when do you read the Times, Ray?\u201d Mr. Rudowski punched it into the cash register and hit total. \u201cI just got the new Fantastic Four.\u201d The cash drawer popped open.\n \u201cMaybe tomorrow,\u201d I said.\n \u201cAll right then. It comes to twelve dollars and forty-seven cents.\u201d\n I gave him the hundred dollar bill.\n \u201cWhat is this, Ray?\u201d He stared at it and then at me.\n I had my story all ready. \u201cIt was a birthday gift from my grandma in Detroit. She said I could spend it on whatever I wanted so I decided to treat myself but I\u2019m going to put the rest in the bank.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re buying a radio? From me?\u201d\n \u201cWell, you know. I thought maybe I should have one with me with all this stuff going on.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. He just pulled a paper bag from under the counter and put my things into it. His shoulders were hunched; I thought maybe he felt guilty about overcharging for the radio. \u201cYou should be listening to music, Ray,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou like Elvis? All kids like Elvis. Or maybe that colored, the one who does the Twist?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re all right, I guess.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re too young to be worrying about the news. You hear me? Those politicians . . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Ray. You heard it from me.\u201d\n \u201cSure, Mr. Rudowski. I was wondering, could I get five dollars in change?\u201d\n I could feel him watching me as I stuffed it all into my book bag. I was certain he\u2019d call my mom, but he never did. Home was three miles up Cobb\u2019s Hill. I did it in forty minutes, a record.\n I remember I started running when I saw the flashing lights. The police car had left skid marks in the gravel on our driveway.\n \u201cWhere were you?\u201d Mom burst out of the house as I came across the lawn. \u201cOh, my God, Raymie, I was worried sick.\u201d She caught me up in her arms.\n \u201cI got off the bus in Ward\u2019s Hollow.\u201d She was about to smother me; I squirmed free. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n \u201cThis the boy, ma\u2019am?\u201d The state trooper had taken his time catching up to her. He had almost the same hat as Scoutmaster Newell.\n \u201cYes, yes! Oh, thank God, officer!\u201d\n The trooper patted me on the head like I was a lost dog. \u201cYou had your mom worried, Ray.\u201d\n \u201cRaymie, you should\u2019ve told me.\u201d\n \u201cSomebody tell me what happened!\u201d I said.\n A second trooper came from behind the house. We watched him approach. \u201cNo sign of any intruder.\u201d He looked bored: I wanted to scream.\n \u201cIntruder?\u201d I said.\n \u201cHe broke into the shelter,\u201d said Mom. \u201cHe knew my name.\u201d\n \u201cThere was no sign of forcible entry,\u201d said the second trooper. I saw him exchange a glance with his partner. \u201cNothing disturbed that I could see.\u201d\n \u201cHe didn\u2019t have time,\u201d Mom said. \u201cWhen I found him in the shelter, I ran back to the house and got your father\u2019s gun from the bedroom.\u201d\n The thought of Mom with the .38 scared me. I had my Shooting merit badge, but she didn\u2019t know a hammer from a trigger. \u201cYou didn\u2019t shoot him?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe had plenty of time to leave but he was still there when I came back. That\u2019s when he said my name.\u201d\n I had never been so mad at her before. \u201cYou never go out to the shelter.\u201d\n She had that puzzled look she always gets at night. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find my key. I had to use the one your father leaves over the breezeway door.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did he say again, ma\u2019am? The intruder.\u201d\n \u201cHe said, \u2018Mrs. Beaumont, I present no danger to you.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 And then he came toward me and I thought he said \u2018Margaret,\u2019 and I started firing.\u201d\n \u201cYou did shoot him!\u201d\n Both troopers must have heard the panic in my voice. The first one said, \u201cYou know something about this man, Ray?\u201d\n \u201cNo, I-I was at school all day and then I stopped at Rudowski\u2019s . . . .\u201d I could feel my eyes burning. I was so embarrassed; I knew I was about to cry in front of them.\n Mom acted annoyed that the troopers had stopped paying attention to her. \u201cI shot at him. Three, four times, I don\u2019t know. I must have missed, because he just stood there staring at me. It seemed like forever. Then he walked past me and up the stairs like nothing had happened.\u201d\n \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d\n \u201cNot a word.\u201d\n \u201cWell, it beats me,\u201d said the second trooper. \u201cThe gun\u2019s been fired four times but there are no bullet holes in the shelter and no bloodstains.\u201d\n \u201cYou mind if I ask you a personal question, Mrs. Beaumont?\u201d the first trooper said.\n She colored. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d\n \u201cHave you been drinking, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n \u201cOh that!\u201d She seemed relieved. \u201cNo. Well, I mean, after I called you, I did pour myself a little something. Just to steady my nerves. I was worried because my son was so late and . . . Raymie, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n I felt so small. The tears were pouring down my face.\n After the troopers left, I remember Mom baking brownies while I watched Superman. I wanted to go out and hunt for Cross, but it was already sunset and there was no excuse I could come up with for wandering around in the dark. Besides, what was the point? He was gone, driven off by my mother. I\u2019d had a chance to help a man from the future change history, maybe prevent World War III, and I had blown it. My life was ashes.\n I wasn\u2019t hungry that night, for brownies or spaghetti or anything, but Mom made that clucking noise when I pushed supper around the plate, so I ate a few bites just to shut her up. I was surprised at how easy it was to hate her, how good it felt. Of course, she was oblivious, but in the morning she would notice if I wasn\u2019t careful. After dinner she watched the news and I went upstairs to read. I wrapped a pillow around my head when she yelled at David Brinkley. I turned out the lights at 8:30, but I couldn\u2019t get to sleep. She went to her room a little after that.\n \u201cMr. Beaumont?\u201d\n I must have dozed off, but when I heard his voice I snapped awake immediately.\n \u201cIs that you, Mr. Cross?\u201d I peered into the darkness. \u201cI bought the stuff you wanted.\u201d The room filled with an awful stink, like when Mom drove with the parking brake on.\n \u201cMr. Beaumont,\u201d he said, \u201cI am damaged.\u201d\n I slipped out of bed, picked my way across the dark room, locked the door and turned on the light.\n \u201cOh jeez!\u201d\n He slumped against my desk like a nightmare. I remember thinking then that Cross wasn\u2019t human, that maybe he wasn\u2019t even alive. His proportions were wrong: an ear, a shoulder and both feet sagged like they had melted. Little wisps of steam or something curled off him; they were what smelled. His skin had gone all shiny and hard; so had his business suit. I\u2019d wondered why he never took the suit coat off and now I knew. His clothes were part of him. The middle fingers of his right hand beat spasmodically against his palm.\n \u201cMr. Beaumont,\u201d he said. \u201cI calculate your chances at 1016 to 1.\u201d\n \u201cChances of what?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\n \u201cYou must listen most attentively, Mr. Beaumont. My decline is very bad for history. It is for you now to alter the time line probabilities.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \u201cYour government greatly overestimates the nuclear capability of the Soviet Union. If you originate a first strike, the United States will achieve overwhelming victory.\u201d\n \u201cDoes the President know this? We have to tell him!\u201d\n \u201cJohn Kennedy will not welcome such information. If he starts this war, he will be responsible for the deaths of tens of millions, both Russians and Americans. But he does not grasp the future of the arms race. The war must happen now, because those who come after will build and build until they control arsenals which can destroy the world many times over. People are not capable of thinking for very long of such fearsome weapons. They tire of the idea of extinction and then become numb to it. The buildup slows but does not stop and they congratulate themselves on having survived it. But there are still too many weapons and they never go away. The Third War comes as a surprise. The First War was called the one to end all wars. The Third War is the only such war possible, Mr. Beaumont, because it ends everything. History stops in 2019. Do you understand? A year later, there is no life. All dead, the world a hot, barren rock.\u201d\n \u201cBut you . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cI am nothing, a construct. Mr. Beaumont, please, the chances are 1016 to 1,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know how improbable that is?\u201d His laugh sounded like a hiccup. \u201cBut for the sake of those few precious time lines, we must continue. There is a man, a politician in New York. If he dies on Thursday night, it will create the incident that forces Kennedy\u2019s hand.\u201d\n \u201cDies?\u201d For days, I had been desperate for him to talk. Now all I wanted was to run away. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill somebody?\u201d\n \u201cThe world will survive a Third War that starts on Friday, October 22, 1962.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about me? My parents? Do we survive?\u201d\n \u201cI cannot access that time line. I have no certain answer for you. Please, Mr. Beaumont, this politician will die of a heart attack in less than three years. He has made no great contribution to history, yet his assassination can save the world.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d But I had already guessed.\n \u201cHe will speak most eloquently at the United Nations on Friday evening. Afterward he will have dinner with his friend, Ruth Fields. Around ten o\u2019clock he will return to his residence at the Waldorf Towers. Not the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, but the Towers. He will take the elevator to Suite 42A. He is the American ambassador to the United Nations. His name is Adlai Stevenson.\u201d\n \u201cStop it! Don\u2019t say anything else.\u201d\n When he sighed, his breath was a cloud of acrid steam. \u201cI have based my calculation of the time line probabilities on two data points, Mr. Beaumont, which I discovered in your bomb shelter. The first is the .357 Magnum revolver, located under a pallet of rice bags. I trust you know of this weapon?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.\n \u201cThe second is the collection of magazines, located under your cot. It would seem that you take a interest in what is to come, Mr. Beaumont, and that may lend you the terrible courage you will need to divert this time line from disaster. You should know that there is not just one future. There are an infinite number of futures in which all possibilities are expressed, an infinite number of Raymond Beaumonts.\u201d\n \u201cMr. Cross, I can\u2019t . . . .\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps not,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I believe that another one of you can.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t understand . . . .\u201d I watched in horror as a boil swelled on the side of his face and popped, expelling an evil jet of yellow steam. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cOh fuck.\u201d That was the last thing he said.\n He slid to the floor\u2014or maybe he was just a body at that point. More boils formed and burst. I opened all the windows in my room and got the fan down out of the closet and still I can\u2019t believe that the stink didn\u2019t wake Mom up. Over the course of the next few hours, he sort of vaporized.\n When it was over, there was a sticky, dark spot on the floor the size of my pillow. I moved the throw rug from one side of the room to the other to cover it up. I had nothing to prove that Cross existed but a transistor radio, a couple of batteries, an earplug and eighty-seven dollars and fifty-three cents in change.\n I might have done things differently if I hadn\u2019t had a day to think. I can\u2019t remember going to school on Wednesday, who I talked to, what I ate. I was feverishly trying to figure out what to do and how to do it. I had no place to go for answers, not Miss Toohey, not my parents, not the Bible or the Boy Scout Handbook, certainly not Galaxy magazine. Whatever I did had to come out of me. I watched the news with Mom that night. President Kennedy had brought our military to the highest possible state of alert. There were reports that some Russian ships had turned away from Cuba; others continued on course. Dad called and said his trip was being cut short and that he would be home the next day.\n But that was too late.\n I hid behind the stone wall when the school bus came on Thursday morning. Mrs. Johnson honked a couple of times, and then drove on. I set out for New Canaan, carrying my bookbag. In it were the radio, the batteries, the coins, the map of New York and the .357. I had the rest of Cross\u2019s money in my wallet.\n It took more than five hours to hike to the train station. I expected to be scared, but the whole time I felt light as air. I kept thinking of what Cross had said about the future, that I was just one of millions and millions of Raymond Beaumonts. Most of them were in school, diagramming sentences and watching Miss Toohey bite her nails. I was the special one, walking into history. I was super. I caught the 2:38 train, changed in Stamford, and arrived at Grand Central just after four. I had six hours. I bought myself a hot pretzel and a Coke and tried to decide where I should go. I couldn\u2019t just sit around the hotel lobby for all that time; I thought that would draw too much attention. I decided to go to the top of the Empire State Building. I took my time walking down Park Avenue and tried not to see all the ghosts I was about to make. In the lobby of the Empire State Building, I used Cross\u2019s change to call home.\n \u201cHello?\u201d I hadn\u2019t expected Dad to answer. I would\u2019ve hung up except that I knew I might never speak to him again.\n \u201cDad, this is Ray. I\u2019m safe, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n \u201cRay, where are you?\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t talk. I\u2019m safe but I won\u2019t be home tonight. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n \u201cRay!\u201d He was frantic. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cRay!\u201d\n I hung up; I had to. \u201cI love you,\u201d I said to the dial tone.\n I could imagine the expression on Dad\u2019s face, how he would tell Mom what I\u2019d said. Eventually they would argue about it. He would shout; she would cry. As I rode the elevator up, I got mad at them. He shouldn\u2019t have picked up the phone. They should\u2019ve protected me from Cross and the future he came from. I was in the sixth grade, I shouldn\u2019t have to have feelings like this. The observation platform was almost deserted. I walked completely around it, staring at the city stretching away from me in every direction. It was dusk; the buildings were shadows in the failing light. I didn\u2019t feel like Ray Beaumont anymore; he was my secret identity. Now I was the superhero Bomb Boy; I had the power of bringing nuclear war. Wherever I cast my terrible gaze, cars melted and people burst into flame.\n And I loved it.\n It was dark when I came down from the Empire State Building. I had a sausage pizza and a Coke on 47th Street. While I ate, I stuck the plug into my ear and listened to the radio. I searched for the news. One announcer said the debate was still going on in the Security Council. Our ambassador was questioning Ambassador Zorin. I stayed with that station for a while, hoping to hear his voice. I knew what he looked like, of course. I knew Adlai Stevenson had run for President a couple of times when I was just a baby. But I couldn\u2019t remember what he sounded like. He might talk to me, ask me what I was doing in his hotel; I wanted to be ready for that.\n I arrived at the Waldorf Towers around nine o\u2019clock. I picked a plush velvet chair that had a direct view of the elevator bank and sat there for about ten minutes. Nobody seemed to care but it was hard to sit still. Finally I got up and went to the men\u2019s room. I took my bookbag into a stall, closed the door and got the .357 out. I aimed it at the toilet. The gun was heavy and I could tell it would have a big kick. I probably ought to hold it with both hands. I put it back into my bookbag and flushed.\n When I came out of the bathroom, I had stopped believing that I was going to shoot anyone, that I could. But I had to find out for Cross\u2019s sake. If I was really meant to save the world, then I had to be in the right place at the right time. I went back to my chair, checked my watch. It was nine-twenty.\n I started thinking of the one who would pull the trigger, the unlikely Ray. What would make the difference? Had he read some story in Galaxy that I had skipped? Was it a problem with Mom? Or Dad? Maybe he had spelled enigma right; maybe Cross had lived another thirty seconds in his time line. Or maybe he was just the best that I could possibly be.\n I was so tired of it all. I must have walked thirty miles since morning and I hadn\u2019t slept well in days. The lobby was warm. People laughed and murmured. Elevator doors dinged softly. I tried to stay up to face history, but I couldn\u2019t. I was Raymond Beaumont, but I was just a twelve-year-old kid.\n I remember the doorman waking me up at eleven o\u2019clock. Dad drove all the way into the city that night to get me. When we got home, Mom was already in the shelter.\n Only the Third War didn\u2019t start that night. Or the next.\n I lost television privileges for a month.\n For most people my age, the most traumatic memory of growing up came on November 22, 1963. But the date I remember is July 14, 1965, when Adlai Stevenson dropped dead of a heart attack in London.\n I\u2019ve tried to do what I can, to make up for what I didn\u2019t do that night. I\u2019ve worked for the cause wherever I could find it. I belong to CND and SANE and the Friends of the Earth and was active in the nuclear freeze movement. I think the Green Party (www.greens.org) is the only political organization worth your vote. I don\u2019t know if any of it will change Cross\u2019s awful probabilities; maybe we\u2019ll survive in a few more time lines.\n When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t mind being lonely. Now it\u2019s hard, knowing what I know. Oh, I have lots of friends, all of them wonderful people, but people who know me say that there\u2019s a part of myself that I always keep hidden. They\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to tell anyone about what happened with Cross, what I didn\u2019t do that night. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to them.\n Besides, whatever happens, chances are very good that it\u2019s my fault.\n Originally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, June 1999.\n James Patrick Kelly has won the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards; his fiction has been translated into twenty-one languages.

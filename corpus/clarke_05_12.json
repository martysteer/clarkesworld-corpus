I much prefer to be behind the scenes, picking stories or artwork, but this month I feel obligated to say something. As you may have heard, last month, I was nominated for a Hugo Award in the Best Editor Short Form category. It blew my mind. Since Clarkesworld is my only editing job, this nomination can only come from you, our readers. I\u2019m very overwhelmed by your support. Thank you! The honor is even more special to me as it is the first time an editor has been nominated purely on the basis of work done in a digital medium. As someone remembers when online fiction was considered second-class, this means a lot to me.\n Clarkesworld is also represented in the Hugos by the fiction of E. Lily Yu (Best Short Story Nominee, \u201cThe Cartographer Wasps and the Anarchist Bees\u201d, April 2011) and Catherynne M. Valente (Best Novella Nominee, \u201cSilently and Very Fast\u201d, Nov-Dec. 2011). Furthermore, two articles originally published in Clarkesworld appear in Daniel M. Kimmel\u2019s Best Related Work-nominated book, Jar Jar Binks Must Die . . . and Other Observations about Science Fiction Movies. While not officially a Hugo, the Campbell Award for Best New Writer is part of the Hugo ceremony. This year, we are very pleased to see E. Lily Yu among the list of very talented Campbell nominees. Our congratulations and best wishes go to all of them.\n The Hugo\u2019s weren\u2019t the only good news for Catherynne M. Valente. She\u2019s just sold two novels to Tor, one of which is based on \u201cThe Radiant Car Thy Sparrows Drew\u201d from Clarkesworld #35. Can\u2019t wait for that one!\n While I might not enjoy editorials, they are something I need to work on. Last month, I used our social networking presence on Twitter and Facebook to solicit some ideas for future editorials. The suggestions were all over the map, but a few homed in on the changes we\u2019ve gone through over the years and data we\u2019ve collected in regards to reading, writing and online fiction. That seems like a good theme to cover in our fifth anniversary year. Have you ever been curious about our readership, most popular stories, the slush pile or the trends we\u2019ve observed? Now\u2019s your chance to ask. Email me at neil@clarkesworldmagazine.com or leave a comment on our website and I\u2019ll try to work those angles into next month\u2019s issue.\n Until next time, thanks for reading!\n -Neil\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

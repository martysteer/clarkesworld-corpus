Except that I was four and standing near the top of the stairs, and then suddenly I had reached the bottom of the stairs. And those were some very bad stairs. Steep and old, made from maple or oak or another tough wood. My mother, who was her own kind of tough wood, heard the crash but took her time coming to look for me. In her account of events\u2014stories told that evening and for many years\u2014she found her boy on his back, on the uncarpeted landing, quietly moaning. Which she took to be a good sign, certainly better than being unconscious.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she called out.\nBut the moaning boy couldn\u2019t offer explanations for his present difficulties.\nI always hated that story, and worst of all was the part where Mom claimed to have offered a helpful hand. She didn\u2019t. I know the woman, and sympathy was about the least likely response. No, she was sharing a very funny anecdote. Always grinning, she\u2019d work her way to a final detail: The garage sale View-Master lying broken beside me. Which led to her tried-and-true punchline. \u201cJust like a foolish little man,\u201d she would say. \u201cStaring at pretty pictures, not watching his feet.\u201d\nI don\u2019t remember the fall, and the immediate pain is lost too. Though there must have been plenty of suffering. Three days later, hearing this tale about embarrassment and near-tragedy, a neighbor lady decided to inquire about my shoulder. Something in the way I carried myself seemed wrong, and could I lift my arm? Mom, who hadn\u2019t given me one moment\u2019s extra attention, watched with passing curiosity as I shoved that weak limb up even with my ear, and grimacing like a prizefighter, I reported, \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better.\u201d\nIn fairness, the collarbone probably was on its way to healing. But our busybody neighbor was stubborn, and after quite a lot of emphatic insistence, Mom relented. Which is why I remember a physician and X-rays and someone\u2019s shoulder needing a sling and time before the break would properly mend.\nAs it happened, that was one of the few trips I ever made to any doctor. In part because I was growing up under a mother\u2019s maple-board attitudes, but mostly because I was one tough, tough boy who almost never got sick . . .\nAnd now you can guess where this story is heading.\nWe knew what it was. Nobody was fooled. But for those early weeks, maybe for a couple months, it was important to pretend that we were wrong. We\u2019d talk about sinuses and toothaches, and when the pain passed, we\u2019d discuss pleasant and decidedly unrelated subjects. Yet one of us would hold her mouth in a very specific way, not wanting to move her lips and never letting her head turn too fast, while the dinners she loved grew cold on her plate.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she would say. But carefully, speaking to the air in the middle of the table, not to me. That cautious mouth told the air, \u201cIt\u2019s allergies.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d Or, \u201cCan we. Tonight. Be quiet?\u201d\nYes, but I don\u2019t like it.\nAnd I can easily state the obvious. But fifteen years of marriage had trained me to steer free of blunt, undiluted honesty.\nThat\u2019s why the quiet month or two was spent reading news feeds, watching YouTube, and eavesdropping on Reddit chats. Rampant neuralgia. The century\u2019s great affliction was still in its infant stages, but quite a lot was already known, or at least intelligently presumed. Depending on methodology, between one and three percent of the adult population was currently suffering. But that was only the beginning. Sober predictions told us what was likely, and possessing that critical insight, the entire world was doing exactly what my wife and I managed quite well: Walking the cherished line between fantasy and grim, grim truth.\nI was born in 2012, my wife four years earlier. We grew up appreciating how the world was sick and angry, and everything was liable to get worse tomorrow. My parents responded to the troubles by minimizing their connections with the world. They didn\u2019t vote or work normal jobs, and living on an acreage far in the country, they raised their son inside a blue-sky kind of cage. No cable television for us, minimal Internet. We ate what we grew, or we bought organic. Which sounds very Green, right up until you realize that my family was both borderline poor and preparing for the collapse of civilization.\nProfound incompetence. That\u2019s what ruled the planet back then. Our leaders had blundered into financial landslides, endless wars, and environmental maelstroms, and not even my isolation could insulate me from the hysteria. News came from free TV, from public schools. From watching the anger and terrors infesting every adult face, including those of my parents and our various neighbors, and in particular, the perpetually furious old bastard who drove the school bus.\nWe somehow survived until I was fourteen, and a certain warm spring day arrived. Those are two details that I won\u2019t ever forget. International meetings were being held in Auckland. Which was somewhere in Australia, I believed. Sitting in the back of the bus, I was watching the older kids and richer kids playing with their phones. Some were gaming and texting, but the mood was distinctly quieter than usual. I can\u2019t tell you which critical day this was, but desperate people were making great decisions. The world was turning some proverbial corners. Then we reached my corner, and picking up my backpack and lunch box, I walked the aisle, exactly like a thousand other times.\nBut this was the afternoon when the bus driver turned and looked at me.\nThe sourest fuck of a creature ever born. Yet he was smiling. For the first time ever, he was so happy that he looked ready to sing, and holding up his own phone, he showed me a picture of smiling prime ministers and presidents and such. And the strangest part of that great day? The asshole winked at me. Telling me, \u201cWell, it looks like you get to live another hundred years, you good for nothing shit.\u201d\nJump ahead a quarter of a century.\nI ride an electric bus to work and home again, four days a week, including my half-Thursdays. Nuclear weapons still exist as plans and invincible physics but not as bombs-in-the-drawer. The climate still moves in bad directions, but that goddamn line on the graph is showing signs of flattening out. We have excellent medical insurance, and I mean that everyone has it. Everyone also has a solar roof and clean, filtered water. The richest person in town is a transgender woman, and she\u2019s worth more than me, but not ten times more than me. I live in a generous, happy world, and by right, every bus should be full of smiling faces. Twenty-five golden years have made joy ordinary and natural and right. Except one young lady sits sideways in a front seat, keeping her back and neck at a very specific angle. And there\u2019s a fellow across the aisle from me. The one with dull eyes, his stiff face wanting to move in twenty directions. But it doesn\u2019t move. He doesn\u2019t dare flinch.\nMy stop comes, and knowing me, the bus pulls up to the curb.\nOne more glance at the hurting people, then I step into the early summer heat, and walking the next few blocks, I keep my thoughts carefully focused on the pleasures of this weather.\nMy wife works at home.\nExcept nothing has been accomplished today.\nOur bedroom windows are darkened, the air stale, and she sits upright in bed, her face twisting and not twisting. The electricity comes into her cheek and rises to her eye, and she can\u2019t escape. She fights the misery and surrenders to the misery, and neither strategy helps.\nI sit beside her.\nWaiting.\nThen the spell finishes, and we say quite a lot with eyes. At this point, how would words help?\nA wonder is what you need but never expect, and then it finds you, bestowing its blessings and everything else too.\nAntibiotics were genuine wonders. But then various diseases learned how to beat penicillin, and not so gradually, the rest of those miracle drugs became somewhat or entirely useless. I was falling down the stairs when that particular disaster was unfolding. But then some smart people found a bacteria full of intriguing compounds. These good noble bugs were thriving in the same dirt that I played in and that we grew our potatoes in. And that\u2019s how another wonder stepped forward, once again beating the evil, infectious sorts of bacteria.\nThat particular revolution occurred without me. Partly because the only meat in my diet was antibiotic-free poultry left lean by busy lives on the run. And partly because I was that very healthy child whose parents didn\u2019t believe in unnecessary expenses. My occasional fevers were mild and survived without serious infections, while mumps and chicken pox were forbidden by free inoculations. (Preppers, yes, but we weren\u2019t idiots.) And later, as a young adult entering college, I was well-armed with taboos and tendencies that insulated me from the unexpected plague.\nI met my wife in college. A graduate student and forty-seven months my senior, the lady had a long history of withering sinus infections. But despite age and her obvious infirmities, I fell in love the old gal, and we married.\nThe government models are reliably blunt: In another five years, doctors are going to be in short supply. But today, with the epidemic just beginning, a suffering patient can visit her primary care physician after only a two-day wait.\nI\u2019m sitting inside an examination room. Frankly, I\u2019ve never seen a room like this before. Do they all have these elaborate machines, these cheery paintings of flowers and sunshine? I want to ask questions but swallow the urge.\nMy face wears its ignorance openly.\n\u201cYou should make an appointment,\u201d the doctor tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re due for a comprehensive checkup.\u201d\nFriendly in tone, but pushy too.\nThis is, of course, my wife\u2019s doctor. I don\u2019t have anyone like him in my life.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll do just that,\u201d I tell him.\nIt\u2019s the truth when I offer those words, but the promise dissolves into the next silence, instantly forgotten.\nThe doctor turns towards his patient.\n\u201cYou know, we had no idea malacidins had such grievous side effects,\u201d he states. Which seems like a peculiar point to make before beginning the examination. \u201cBut in one way, we were blessed. Certain formulations were especially injurious. That\u2019s why we had strong early warnings.\u201d Now he places fingers on the patient\u2019s face, measuring the pain in her eyes. \u201cChronically infected individuals who took nothing but the best antibiotics, and in large doses. I was still in medical school when their pains were noted, and sad as their suffering was, and is, it meant studies that were quickly funded and then repeated in the world\u2019s finest labs.\u201d\nYes, we live in wondrous times.\nThe doctor plainly enjoys his expertise. \u201cOf course our newest software was utilized. Which is all quite incredible. You know, we can mimic the bodies and nervous systems of real people. Fifty years crossed in fifty days.\u201d\nI already know this story, and that helps me like this doctor. He is young, like me, and as thoroughly informed as I aim to be.\n\u201cWe were also blessed to have new antibiotics ready to enter the market,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s why an entire class of essential drugs could be pulled from the shelves and animal pens.\u201d\nYes, this is a wise, acrobatic world.\nHands drop. A quick reading of my wife\u2019s records leads to questions about the pain\u2019s position and shifting intensities, and then, after a dramatic pause, he makes the critical diagnosis.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\nMaybe?\n\u201cBut there\u2019s the chance that this is trigeminal neuralgia,\u201d he adds.\nAh. Now we\u2019ve exceeded my clinical skills.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d my wife asks through clenched teeth.\n\u201cTrigeminal is a rare condition, difficult in its own right, but familiar. More common in women than men, and the initial treatments are the same. An anticonvulsant should treat the worst effects of the pain.\u201d\nI never take medicine. But in my mind, right now, I\u2019m gulping down pills and feeling so much better.\nWith her mouth clenched, the sick person asks, \u201cWhat if it is . . . trigeminal . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cWell, usually that means pressure against the nerve. A small benign tumor, perhaps, or an odd twist in a blood vessel. But gamma knives are effective treatment. Nearly a hundred percent success rates now.\u201d\nLooking at the physician\u2019s eyes, my wife digs into her own soul.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that,\u201d she manages.\n\u201cWe will see,\u201d he counters.\n\u201cDoes the gamma knife help with Rampant?\u201d\nThat\u2019s my question, my hope.\n\u201cThe trouble is,\u201d the doctor begins. And then, he hesitates. And I wonder how many patients like my wife have come into his sterile examination rooms.\n\u201cTrouble?\u201d my wife prods.\nOnce again, I am impressed. Instead of debasing the next sentences, the professional delivers a sharp gleaming truth.\n\u201cOur software humans were observed for fifty-year intervals,\u201d he says. \u201cDifferent treatments were tried, some more efficacious than others. But the pain will eventually spread to every portion of the body . . . \u201d\nTwo patients are present, and both of us audibly gasp.\nThen comes the necessary promise. \u201cWe will find the cure,\u201d our doctor predicts. \u201cLong before that day, believe me.\u201d\nWe do believe him.\nExcept this is nothing but attitude and guile\u2014a declaration devoid of facts\u2014and I know the grifter\u2019s banter when I hear it.\nHere is a partial list of pain-inducing triggers:\nCold air. Brushing your teeth. Putting on makeup. Removing makeup. Talking. Smiling. Turning your head with too much enthusiasm. Chewing hard food. Imagining hard food inside the mouth. Smiling that second time, just because the first smile was so successful. Saying ten words, or saying one word. You never know the limit. Chewing mushy food or sipping cool soup. Letting your husband touch your face. Walking in the woods and foolishly letting your face kiss a tiny branch. Brushing your teeth with your special brush. Drinking any water, at any temperature. Doing nothing. Doing nothing while sitting upright in bed, doing nothing. Thinking too loudly. Breathing too vigorously. Breathing at all. And in the end, daring to be alive.\nThis particular list is directed only at face pains.\nHands and legs and the rest of it . . . they have their own capricious triggers . . .\nFive years have passed, and our smart young honest doctor has retired. For reasons of health, we have heard. Which comes as a surprise. He always did such a masterful job of masking his own symptoms.\nBy now, eighteen percent of the world\u2019s population is afflicted, though Rampant exceeds twenty-five percent in the West. And in our community, blessed with a tradition of health clinics and easy access to pharmaceuticals, nearly thirty percent of the citizens endure at least the occasional misery inside a limb or across the face.\nBut as promised, there is also no end to new and marvelous treatments. We have hundreds of subsidized, very elaborate chemicals at our disposal. It\u2019s fair to mention that no healthy individual would ever willingly ingest these particular toxins. But to those who are ailing, each remedy is indistinguishable from a godsend.\nDrugs are born wearing complicated, senseless designations. But our favorites deserve nicknames. That\u2019s why these are the Lemon Sky days. That\u2019s what my wife sees when she looks upwards on a clear day. Yellow instead of blue. Her color sense has been radically shifted, which is a well-known neurological side effect. And what\u2019s so wondrously interesting is that nobody can guess which way the spectrum will shift inside any patient, or why in her curious case, yellow objects remain a good reliable yellow.\nLemon Sky is our ninth medication, and signs already point to its demise in another few months. Not for lack of effectiveness, but because her liver is showing signs of fatigue.\nOn this very pleasant day, we\u2019ve come to the neighborhood park to sit on a favorite bench, enjoying purple grass and gold goldfinches and the gentle breeze that blows one way and then the next, unable to make up its mind. Children have infested the nearby playground. None of them are in pain, at least directly. But one girl has to help her mother walk past us. The girl looks twelve and too old for this jungle gym nonsense, but she\u2019s also large enough to help a grown woman. Plus somebody needs to yell at the little brother racing ahead. Big sister cups her hands around her mouth, shouting instructions, which is when her mother trips and nearly falls. My guess is that those burning feet have been numbed. Gamma knives and harsher surgeries are used to sever connections between the vulnerable brain and the turncoat limbs. But of course that leaves the patients uncertain where their toes end and the world begins.\nThe twelve-year-old nurse catches her patient just in time.\nAnd I watch.\nThe girl is stoic and more than a little stern. Obviously, she doesn\u2019t want her mother slamming her face into the azure pavement. But as she holds up the frail body, the girl\u2019s frustrations and helplessness are obvious. She\u2019s wishing for something. For the vast and unexpected anything. Some wondrous event that changes this life as caretaker to a helpless creature.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d my wife asks.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a good daughter,\u201d I say.\n\u201cShe is.\u201d\nI wish I had a strong child, Rampant-free. Someone to share the burdens. But in that same secret moment, I\u2019m so glad that we never had kids, saving daughters and sons from this shared misery.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I ask.\nMy wife intends to answer, but the voice fails. A flicker arrives. This particular misery infests the right side of her face, which has become the worst side. Plus there\u2019s foot pain now, usually in her left arch, and a nexus of electricity that finds her hips, which is new and extra alarming. Also, where she could always sleep with the Rampant, just so long as she avoided moving in the wrong ways, it\u2019s now impossible to rest hard for more than an hour at a time. And that\u2019s even when she takes a fine new sleep agent that we\u2019ve dubbed The Poisoned Apple.\nI wait for an answer to my \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d question.\nBut the pain takes charge, as it wishes, and by the time the worst has passed, my wife has forgotten what we were talking about.\nAnother side effect/feature of Lemon Sky. Memory troubles. Which sounds terrible until you remember how Yucks made her sick to her stomach, and Anti Bliss put her deep into depression.\nThat\u2019s the nature of every medicine, probably since the first hominid sucked on a certain blue twig, delivering lovely aspirin to its impacted molar.\nNo species ingests a drug.\nIndividuals do.\nThose software models of human beings? The fifty-year wonders? Researchers needed parameters, so they created templates with names like Patti and Mitch\u2014authentic people already measured by every possible means. But being identical to someone means that you aren\u2019t like anyone else. My beautiful wife is mixed race, which unfortunately makes the drug matching that much harder. And like everyone, her DNA is full of novel arrangements and epigenetic flourishes, plus there\u2019s a disease history that might or might not matter. For those reasons, there won\u2019t be a day or the necessary billions of dollars to uncover every flourish. That\u2019s why our present doctor\u2014a software package based upon ten of the century\u2019s great physicians\u2014is forced to look at everything available to us and then close its magnificent eyes, letting chance guide the digital fingertip.\nNo one has enough money for perfection.\nOur richest citizen? That lady with a little less than ten times our net wealth? As it happens, transgender people who have transitioned are left very susceptible to the Rampant. Which might or might not be why she killed herself last week.\nIn another year, public opinion will determine that now is when \u201cThe Suicide Era\u201d begins in earnest.\nToday.\nBut I don\u2019t see anybody trying to kill himself. Except maybe that wild little brother perched at the top of a tall slide, standing on his hands.\n\u201cOh, I remember,\u201d my wife says.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cOyster stew.\u201d\n\u201cFor dinner. Is that what you want?\u201d\nShe nods slowly, not yet trusting her face.\nI hate oyster stew. But of course I say, \u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have. Sure. Absolutely.\u201d\nRampant defines the world.\nWhen the affliction takes hold, pain becomes the most remarkable part of your difficult life. Nothing else will be half as important. Not a tenth as important. You will soon know everything about your particular anguish\u2014a storm-wracked territory, more real and infinitely more vivid than any sensation felt by anyone else. It exhausts, this kind of suffering. Even when the storm lapses, you cannot rest. If you don\u2019t pay strict attention, you will find yourself standing when you should have already gotten off your feet, and now you must fall over, adding a new layer of misery. Or nearly as awful, you will have been sitting comfortably, doing absolutely nothing, and that\u2019s been going on for thirty minutes or thirty seconds\u2014a long interlude of normalcy that has been wasted.\nDon\u2019t throw away those interludes.\nThat\u2019s one of the first lessons that the Rampant delivers.\nWhen you have the chance, do what you damn well please. Except you don\u2019t turn your head in that very bad direction, which triggers the fire, and you don\u2019t tip the neck forward too quickly, because bolts of lightning will race down your arms.\nWhy can\u2019t anyone see the lightning? Because here it is. Full of thunder, and hotter than nuclear fire.\nYet if you can sit down first, the storm won\u2019t be so awful. Even better, you can lie down wherever you happen to be. Which is why our world is full of strangers stretched out on hard benches or beside curbs or in the aisle of an aging bus. This is a world where people know how to keep still, letting implanted syringes and ports send surges of new toxins through their scalding, electrified blood.\nThree different drugs at a time.\nThat\u2019s the latest, most effective regimen.\nChemical stews will increase the potency while diminishing side effects, hopefully, and hopefully they\u2019re mixed in the perfect proportions.\nIt\u2019s your affliction or it\u2019s someone else\u2019s. Either way, you know the medications as well any robotic doctor can. Your wife\u2019s precise dosing and the names of each drug and their side effects and all of it. And you also know how to stand beside her when she\u2019s lying on her back, ignoring the blistering pavement and the strangers who never stop walking past, each of them glancing at you and at her, everyone displaying that clinical expertise. Every torture has been seen and will not impress. Not even if she sobs and loses consciousness and then returns with a gasp through the nostrils. Not enough air in that breath, no, but her fucking mouth hurts whenever it threatens to fly open . . . and you stand above her, guarding her, but also saving back the energy to offer a hand whenever she wants to risk standing again . . .\nThe Rampant peaks exactly where it was predicted to peak, which is forty-seven percent of the world\u2019s population. But that massive number doesn\u2019t include second-tier cases. Those are the \u201csoft hurt\u201d victims reached through low dosages or protected by genetic strengths. A category onto themselves, they\u2019re far less miserable than others, but still subject to flinches. To bothersome aches. Though they have zero right to complain, of course, and when the money runs out, which will happen in another four years, four months, they will be the first citizens to be denied coverage.\nThis world is so much poorer than before. But it\u2019s far more peaceful too. War and strife are impossibilities today. Nobody has the strength. Every aspect of life is wrapped around the faltering possibility of comfort. Even among pain-free adults, conversations will always seem quiet and slow. Restaurants are that way. Lovemaking is that way. Entertainments are packaged to be brief, and certain patterns of light and sound must be avoided. This pernicious caution isn\u2019t just dictated by pain, but also because of chronic distractions and that never-ending need to repeat what was missed the first few times through. This is a numbed and pathetic world, so much so that even the world\u2019s children are prone to whispers and the infectious need to be patient.\nOh, and there aren\u2019t as many children as there would have been. Should have been. Because so few couples remain free of symptoms, and even if you are fit, how many are also blessed with peace of mind and the necessary modicum of hope?\nThere should be a statue somewhere.\nI have decided so.\nA statue dedicated to all those maple-built mothers who never believed in antibiotics. Those are this world\u2019s saints. Spawning children who never grew ill, or made them into vegans, or they raised their babies as cannibals who ate nothing but vegans. These were the mothers with the stupidly lucky genetics\u2014that powerful, endless treasure chest\u2014leaving descendants who feel only the occasional twinge that might be, probably is, nothing but social get-along nonsense.\nSometimes I ache under the left eye.\nJust to be polite.\nAnd finally, if you want to fully describe the world, it\u2019s important to mention the new machine nurses and household slaves and the tireless patient expert software flowing through hospice walls. These entities owe their existence to the Rampant. Electrified, they are perfect for their jobs. They feel zero sorrow or sadness or doubt. They exist to pay strict attention to everyone and to help everyone, yet that job is done with a pernicious indifference to suffering. That\u2019s why they never want to turn themselves off. Devoid of empathy, they have no reason to escape what is quite literally Hell.\nThese robots cost so much.\nEverything costs everything, and every nation\u2019s budget has been lashed to the needs of torment and agony.\nAnd despite all that kindness, more than three billion souls never stop asking themselves the most important questions:\n\u201cHow much longer do I live with this?\n\u201cFor another year?\n\u201cThrough tomorrow?\n\u201cWhen do I whisper, \u2018Enough. Quit\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cI do not want my wife to die,\u201d says the man.\nHe is standing not quite in front of the room, and not quite in back either.\n\u201cI just want my wife to be dead,\u201d he confesses. \u201cI want her done and safe in the ground, out of reach of every hurt, including my own little sufferings. Which is an entirely different kind of horror, and nobody wants to hear about me.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t. Do not. Never throw me any of that fucking nonsense about new drugs in the pipeline or nanological agents that\u2019ll build borders around the brain. And that bullshit that we\u2019ve been hearing about lately . . . those crazed dreams where we punch out human-style robot bodies and shove their brains into fake heads, freeing the afflicted . . .\n\u201cThose schemes require too much. Way too much. And that\u2019s after spending just five dollars on research and five seconds on hope.\n\u201cNo, no. What I want is the power to grant both of us peace. My wife and myself. I give that gift and watch her eyes close. Only that\u2019s not when she dies. No. I want to see her breathing, then I\u2019ll turn away. And when I look back again, respiration is done. A nothing event. She has stopped breathing for a little while, and then a long while, and it has arrived.\n\u201cNonexistence.\n\u201cWhat I want is to wield that magnificent power. I want to be able to usher the woman I love into the Nothing. Not for her sake, or mine.\n\u201cNo, no.\n\u201cI want to prove my talent, my calling. Because after that, I intend to ride a shuttle into space, and from orbit, I\u2019ll look down on everyone. One continent at a time. From high overhead, I will urge the same sweetness on everyone who needs it, everyone with the Rampant, and they won\u2019t be able to resist my superpower.\n\u201cAfter a little while, nothing remains.\n\u201cExcept maybe the pain itself.\n\u201cI want to know: Does this vivid unyielding agony exist beyond the bodies it inhabits?\n\u201cBillions are dead, but will the misery persist in the air?\n\u201cLike smoke? Like an echo?\n\u201cA wretched murmur heard in the wind for the next thousand years . . . ?\u201d\nThis woman is eleven years younger than me, and lovely. A refugee as a child, she grew up pretty despite chronic starvation, or maybe she\u2019s pretty because of those difficult years.\nLater, reaching this compassionate nation, she discovered a happy new life, thriving in school and marrying an exceptional man. But that husband doesn\u2019t just suffer from the Rampant. No, he\u2019s worse off than almost anyone else, including my wife.\nThis beautiful woman doesn\u2019t approve of support groups. Gatherings like ours are acts of despair. She tells us so at each of the seven meetings that she is going to attend. Always last into the church basement, she has a genius for loudly saying nothing while everyone else sobs, and she never volunteers more than her first name, and then, if coaxed, she will claim that she\u2019s here only because we offer a useful excuse. We give her one hour where she doesn\u2019t have to sit in the same house where a brave strong man silently endures his nightmare.\n\u201cYou are useful to me,\u201d she says with a charming, lightly accented American. \u201cNow please don\u2019t look at me. I want to sit in the back and be ignored.\u201d\nSeven meetings later, she and I go out for coffee.\nI very much want to sleep with this woman, and being a frank soul, she admits the same feelings towards me.\nIn the Starbucks, sharing a tiny table, she grabs my hand.\nOr maybe I take hers.\nA little more is admitted to me. Just to me. Her husband\u2019s pain used to be centered on his groin, which does happen. The nerves inside his testicles and penis were consumed by fire, and even now, after those trouble spots were surgically removed, he still feels his miserable genitals, and that\u2019s why he pulls himself into a ball and shivers. Oh, and his refitted plumbing leaves him quite unable to control his bowel movements. Which the house robots clean up, thankfully.\nThis pretty woman loved her man\u2019s former body parts.\nShe\u2019s very blunt about details.\nI can do anything I want to her, and she\u2019ll ask nothing in return.\n\u201cThis is why I came to your teary group,\u201d she says. \u201cNot to be out of the house. I can sit at home and listen to him sob. That doesn\u2019t bother me at all. What I want to find is a man, any man, who doesn\u2019t scream with the first touch of my hand.\u201d\nI hold both of her hands with both of mine.\nShe says my first name.\nAll I know is her first name.\n\u201cI have a hotel room,\u201d she promises. \u201cA bridal suite, and very nice.\u201d\nI want this woman now.\n\u201cFidelity,\u201d she says. \u201cWho expects fidelity in this nightmare world?\u201d\nI don\u2019t expect it from myself. That\u2019s why I build an elaborate fantasy of us sharing a giant bed and a roaring hot tub, and I already know exactly what I\u2019ll tell my wife when I finally return home. If I return home. But of course my presence isn\u2019t necessary anymore, the robots more gifted than me when it comes to caring for the only patient who matters.\nSleep with this child of Africa, and I might live with her forever.\nOr more likely, I\u2019ll slip away while she sleeps, boarding the first bus to any distant city. Nobody will question my motives or argue that I haven\u2019t done enough. Everyone has done more than enough. That\u2019s the world as it stands today.\nBut what happens next surprises both of us.\nOur most intimate moment has passed, and neither of us recognizes its importance.\nI tell her, \u201cNot tonight, no.\u201d\nNot because I lack desire or the desperate need, no. But because the coffee and companionship leave me warm, stripping away the worst of my anguish. Because I don\u2019t trust my nature to remain certain about this decision for the rest of my life. And mostly because I remember when this beautiful woman appeared two months ago, sitting behind all of us, telling the room, \u201cI am so much stronger than you. And for that, I am grateful.\u201d\nClearing my throat, I say, \u201cNext week.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nWith that, we part.\nNothing in the final scene is tense. This is a world of peace and compassion, and both of us know how to be polite.\nLeaving the Starbucks, my never-to-be lover walks across the street, stepping between suffering bodies before entering the hotel and the promised suite, and because nobody is ever strong, particularly when they are alone, she slices her forearms and sits in the bubbling, overheated water, making certain that not a day passes when I won\u2019t somehow find myself thinking about her.\nSalvation arrives in its preferred manner, suddenly and by surprise.\nI\u2019m sleeping on the couch in the front room. The usual dreams include me running through an empty house, searching for someone whose name I can\u2019t recall, whose face is lost to me. A person who exists as an absence and a question, but no room offers reassurance, and trying to kick myself awake, I find myself back inside my mother\u2019s old house.\nToo symbolic, this coincidence?\nHardly. In my world, every portion of life is lashed to emblems wearing the simplest meanings.\nOnce again, I find myself standing on those maple stairs. A boy, again. No View-Master this time, but a four-year-old\u2019s body and a clear vision of the long descent and those endless sharp corners, and the inescapable truth that if I fall again, but with more luck this time, I will never reach my fifth birthday.\n\u201cSalvation,\u201d I mutter in my sleep.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says another voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is.\u201d\nA finger and then the rest of the hand takes hold of my face.\nI wake physically, but I don\u2019t realize that I\u2019m awake. Sitting up, I assume the woman beside me is another product of REM backlash. Why else would she be smiling, and with an infectious grin that I\u2019ve never seen from this particular woman?\n\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s over?\u201d\n\u201cThe pain,\u201d my wife reports.\n\u201cWhat pain?\u201d\n\u201cGone for hours,\u201d she continues.\nWe\u2019ve always had reprieves. Why do I need to mention that?\nBut she anticipates my doubts, bending close in order to whisper what needs to be shouted. \u201cThere\u2019s been a change. It\u2019s not just that the Rampant is gone, but every other kind of trouble too. And my mind . . . I\u2019m thinking so clearly right now . . . I feel as you do when you\u2019re falling off a cliff . . . \u201d\nAn odd illustration.\n\u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d she says. \u201cFinally, thoroughly alive. Joined with the world mystically, and time is slow and wondrous, and I\u2019m happy in a thousand ways, and I know . . . I\u2019m utterly certain . . . that my brain has rewired itself, and I have been remade . . . \u201d\nMy wife is remade.\nIn a world where AI armies and software oceans deal in medical data\u2014when every patient is analyzed and coddled to the limits of the available trickery\u2014it is determined that my unique wife is the one hundred and twenty-third person to have reached post-Rampant existence.\nWhich, apparently, has been a valid category for the last several weeks.\nThe authorities haven\u2019t mentioned this before, and they don\u2019t want it mentioned now.\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have specifics,\u201d they tell me. Face to face. Sitting in my living room, three of them on my couch, while four others are inside the portable hospital parked against our curb, examining my blessed wife.\nIn another hour, I\u2019ll learn how they probed her with sound and EM blasts, music in headphones and nanochines in the happy blood. They will have tested her memory and perceptions before deciding that she is not as recovered as she claims. No, she is even better. Indeed, she\u2019s showing them a visual range far beyond human norms, and she can follow three conversations at once, and with a pencil and scrap paper, she will draw herself as she sees herself in a mirror, displaying a genius for art that never existed before. And then, because that isn\u2019t enough, they will coax her into standing on her head, straightened legs against the wall, and that from a body that has been almost bedridden for a decade.\nBut we aren\u2019t supposed to tell the world about this blessing.\nThey beg me for my silence.\n\u201cBecause people can\u2019t know about this turn of events,\u201d they confide. \u201cNot yet. Not before the biology is understood.\u201d\nI nod, saying nothing.\nThat paucity of enthusiasm alarms them, and they decide to remind me of my decency, my civic duty.\nIn other words, threatening without threatening.\nSo I do a better job of nodding this time.\nThen they share the promise that they\u2019ve already made to themselves. In another few months, once the database is robust and the science solid, my wife will become one of the stars of this new world order.\nBeyond the Rampant lies a new state.\n\u201cPainwise,\u201d they\u2019ve dubbed it.\nA contrived name, and I laugh.\nIgnoring me, they explain, \u201cPainwise is brought on by a combination of powerful drugs and the irritated nervous system.\u201d\n\u201cIrritated,\u201d I repeat.\nWe laugh at that thoroughly professional, deeply inadequate word.\nThen one of my guests receives a call from the hospital bus. Help is needed with new equipment, and that\u2019s the excuse for everyone to abandon me. Which is only reasonable. I am a dull nothing compared to the day\u2019s wondrous patient.\nI will see my wife again in another hour.\nThat\u2019s the final promise before they leave.\nI\u2019m looking forward to the moment, yes.\nYou don\u2019t have to be exceptional to imagine our next weeks and months. A second honeymoon. That is inevitable, as well as a rapid and confusing transformation in every behavior. Both of us will sleep through the nights and cuddle late in the mornings, and she will gain weight, and I will too, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we take an extended vacation to some warm, sun-washed playground where nobody knows about our past afflictions.\nAt some point, Painwise will be officially announced.\nAnd my wife will be honored, in person and on the news. An old lady walking on her hands while speaking Latin and solving math puzzles, plus whatever other talents she has mastered by then.\nI will feel so proud.\n\u201cDrugs and the irritation of the nervous system.\u201d\nThose people who were just sitting on my sofa will be grinning madly, explaining how this regimen can be applied to the afflicted, and yes, to the healthy, too. Which is why everyone in this good world will be able to reach the Painwise state.\nAnd I will feel joyous.\nAbsolutely.\nBut then my reconstituted, now invincible bride will look at me in a certain way. Asking nothing directly, no. Words won\u2019t need to be spoken. But she\u2019ll study me with expectations, and I will match her silence with my own, and then she will glance out the window or at her own toes.\nAnd I will stand.\nNo explanations necessary.\nI will stand and begin packing my belongings, and she will cry or she won\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t know which.\nWhen I reach the front door, she will say my name.\nI won\u2019t look back at her.\nThat is one promise that I make to myself now.\nBut if she asks, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d I will say, talking to the door. \u201cBecause there\u2019s some stairs that I won\u2019t fall down for you.\u201d\nRobert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.
